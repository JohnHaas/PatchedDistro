Rainbow Theatre

The Rainbow Theatre (originally Astoria Theatre) is a Grade II*-listed building in Finsbury Park, London, England. Built as a cinema in 1930, it later became well known as a music venue and is now a Pentecostal church.
History.
Former Stage Manager, Rick Burton has published a website with a detailed history of who has performed at the theatre and when.
Cinema.
When it opened in 1930, the Astoria Cinema was one of the largest in the world. Standing at the junction of Isledon Road and Seven Sisters Road on an island site, it was the fourth of the famous London suburban Astoria Theatres built by film exhibitor Arthur Segal. It was opened on 29 September 1930: there were three other Astorias, Streatham, Old Kent Road and Brixton. It was in use as a cinema until September 1971 when it was permanently given over to live music - although rock concerts had been a feature throughout the 1960s.
The plain faience exterior, designed by Edward A. Stone, acted as a foil to a lavish 'atmospheric interior' by Somerford & Barr, with decoration carried out by Marc-Henri and G. Laverdet. A Moorish foyer with a goldfish-filled fountain (which survives today) led to an auditorium recalling an Andalucian village at night, with seating for 3,040. The stage, deep and spanned by a proscenium arch, was equipped with a twin-console Compton 3-manual/13-rank theatre organ (opened by G. T. Pattman). Backstage, there were 12 dressing rooms. The opening night, 29 September 1930, featured Ronald Colman in "Condemned" and a Gala Stage Spectacle, with artists from the other Astoria Theatres making a special engagement on the stage.
In December 1930, the Astoria was taken over by Paramount Pictures. It was taken over again, on 27 November 1939, by Oscar Deutsch's Odeon Theatres Ltd.
Music venue: 1960s.
One-night concerts were held on the stage in the 1960s, with the building becoming one of the premier music venues in the capital.
It was at this theatre that Jimi Hendrix first burnt a guitar, with the collusion of his manager Chas Chandler and a journalist from "NME". Press agent Tony Garland was dispatched to purchase lighter fluid and Jimi proceeded to set fire to his Fender Stratocaster guitar on 31 March 1967 on the opening night of the Walker Brothers tour, resulting in a hospital appointment for Jimi's burnt fingers and a moment that set the precedent for rock performances. Jimi later repeated the stunt at Monterey. Frank Zappa was given the burnt Astoria guitar by ex-Hendrix roadie 'H' at Miami, he had apparently acquired the guitar at some point and was then working for Zappa. When Jimi left the stage at The Finsbury Astoria, the guitar was intact apart from burns. The guitar handed to Frank Zappa in Miami was also intact, but the neck was removed later and ended up badly rotted after years left exposed to damp at Zappa's house.
The Beach Boys' album, "Live In London", was recorded here in 1968.
Music venue: 1970s-80s.
Renamed "Odeon" on 17 November 1970, the theatre was closed by the Rank Organisation on 25 September 1971 with Bill Travers in "Gorgo" and Hayley Mills in "Twisted Nerve".
The Odeon was converted into the Rainbow Theatre from 4 November 1971, when The Who performed the first concert in the newly named theatre. The Who later wrote and recorded the song "Long Live Rock", which celebrates the theatre.
The Osmonds made their debut appearance in London at the Rainbow Theatre in the early 1970s.
Pink Floyd played a four-night stand at the venue during the beginning of their Eclipsed Tour, on which its main set is mostly known as the "pre-"Dark Side Of The Moon"" set, from 17–20 February 1972. The last night performance was partially broadcast on BBC Radio. The band also played two benefit concerts at the Rainbow on 4 November 1973 for Robert Wyatt, who had been recently paralyzed from a fall.
Yes filmed their concerts on 15 and 16 December 1972 at the Rainbow for the 1975 film release "Yessongs". These are not necessarily the same recordings used for the triple live album "Yessongs" which was recorded from February through December 1972 and released in 1973. However, the two performances that are the same on the album and the film are "Close to the Edge" and "Würm".
June 1, 1974 is date of the collaborative performance at the Rainbow Theatre by Kevin Ayers, John Cale, Nico and Brian Eno. Other well-known musicians, including Mike Oldfield and Robert Wyatt, also contributed to the concert.
Queen recorded a concert at the Rainbow on 19th and 20th November 1974 called "Live At The Rainbow"; released on VHS in 1992 box set called: "Box Of Tricks". 
Genesis performed many times at the Rainbow over their career. Their concert of 20 October 1973 was recorded and released as "Live at the Rainbow Theatre". The concert recording was included on the first Genesis Archive set, released in 1998.
The Sweet also appeared at the Rainbow Theatre on 21 December 1973 and subsequently released a live album called "Live At The Rainbow 1973".
Eric Clapton recorded a concert there in January 1973. Featured artists who played with him were Pete Townshend, Stevie Winwood, Ron Wood, Rich Grech, Jim Capaldi, Jimmy Karstein & Rebop.
Van Morrison performed two nights at this venue in July 1973, with his band at the time The Caledonia Soul Orchestra. The second of the performances was broadcast in May 1974, as the first ever simultaneous broadcast, on BBC 2 and Radio 2. The concert was voted by Q magazine readers as one of the top live performances of all time. Several of the songs featured in the two concerts were included in Morrison's 1974 double live album "It's Too Late to Stop Now".
Kool & the Gang recorded three live tracks at the Rainbow for their "Love & Understanding" album, released in 1976.
In 1977, the Ramones played two gigs at the venue, on 31 December and 1 January 1978. The New Year's Eve concert was recorded and released as the "It's Alive" album.
On 1–4 August 1977 Little Feat played 4 nights there, with the Tower of Power horn section. The concerts were recorded and some material was later released on "Waiting for Columbus". Mick Taylor was guest guitarist on the third night and played on two songs, "A Apolitical Blues" & "Teenage Nervous Breakdown".
Bob Marley & the Wailers played on 1, 2, 3 and 4 June 1977 at The Rainbow Theatre, as part of the Exodus Tour. The last show of the tour was released as the album "Bob Marley and the Wailers Live! at the Rainbow". Thanks largely to this album Bob Marley was established as the Third World's first superstar , a legacy that survives thirty years after the album's release. In the UK alone it stayed on the chart for 56 consecutive weeks and birthed 3 hit singles. In July 1991 a video documentary, "Bob Marley and the Wailers: Live! At the Rainbow" directed by Keef, was released in the UK. On 16 October 2001 Tuff Gong released five songs from the 4th of June 1977 Rainbow Theatre performance on disc two of "Exodus (Deluxe Edition)".
Thin Lizzy recorded part of their "Live and Dangerous" album at the Rainbow in 1977. "Classic Rock" magazine readers voted it the best live rock album of all time.
The Jacksons played at the Rainbow Theatre on 6, 7, 8, 9, 23 and 24 February 1979 as part of their Destiny World Tour to support the "Destiny" album, which had been released the previous year.
Secret Affair played the Rainbow on 8 December 1979.
Part of Stiff Little Fingers' first live album, "Hanx!" was recorded at the Rainbow in 1980.
Iron Maiden recorded a video "Live at Rainbow Theatre" released in 1981.
Iron Maiden also recorded their first music video "Women in Uniform", directed by Doug Smith and released in 1980, here.
The building had been the subject of a preservation order in the 1970s and the management company that operated the venue was unable to maintain it to the required standard. The building was closed permanently in 1982, although there were plans for its conversion to a bingo hall.
In 1995, the building was bought by the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God and is now used for religious ceremonies.
Occasional films were screened, including "Jimi Plays Berkley" in January 1972, the World Premiere of the Leonard Cohen film "Bird on a Wire" on 5 July 1974, and Paul McCartney's "Wings", which was the last film to be screened at the Rainbow Theatre, on 10 August 1979. The venue should have hosted the premiere of "Pink Floyd at Pompeii" on 25 November 1972. It was cancelled at the last minute by the theatre's owner, Rank Strand. Their eventual explanation was that the film didn't have a certificate from the British Board of Film Censors and they wouldn't allow the Rainbow Theatre, which was a music venue, to be a venue for showing a film and thus could be seen to be in competition with their other established cinemas.
The dramatic climax to the 1980 British film "Breaking Glass" was shot here. Directed by Brian Gibson, it starred Hazel O'Connor, Phil Daniels and Jonathan Pryce.
Boxing venue.
Following the closure of the Rainbow Theatre on 24 December 1981, it was designated a listed building, but lay empty and largely disused for the next 14 years. It was used occasionally in unlicensed boxing matches, most notably in April 1986 when Lenny McLean beat Roy Shaw in a dramatic first round knockout.
Church.
In 1995, the building was taken over by its current owners, the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, a controversial Brazilian Pentecostal church. They began work restoring the building and turning it into a church. The auditorium restoration was the last phase to be completed, in 1999, and the theatre is now the main base for UCKG in the UK.

Khalaf Al-Enezi

Khalaf Al-Enezi is a member of the Kuwaiti National Assembly, representing the second district. Born in 1952, Al-Enezi worked at the National Council before being elected to the National Assembly in 1981. Al-Enezi is an Independent deputy and is on good terms with the royal family. 
Defended Education Minister Nouria al-Subeih.
On January 22, 2008, the parliament voted 27-19, with two abstentions, against the impeachment of Education Minister Nouria al-Subeih. 
In the lead-up to the vote, MPs Ali Al-Daqbaashi, Musallam AlـBarrak, Saleh Ashour and Hussein Muzyed spoke against the minister while Al-Enezi, Ali Al-Rashid, Mohammed Al-Sager, and Adel Al-Saraawi spoke in her defense.
Subeih had to defend herself against allegations that she had attempted to deceive the nation when she denied a press report that three male students had been sexually assaulted by an Asian worker at a state school. She explained she had been misinformed and issued an apology.
Islamist lawmaker Saad al-Shreih also accused Subeih of not showing enough respect for Islam when she did not punish a 14-year-old girl who had allegedly drawn a cross on her religion text book and scribbled notes on it that she hated Islam. The minister told the house there was no evidence the girl had actually done that and so she was just referred to counseling. Shreih, however, still managed to gather the requisite signatures of ten lawmakers to force the no-confidence vote.
Supports Increase in Minimum Wage.
Al-Enezi and Sadoon Al-Otaibi have both dismissed past wage increases as “too small” and not enough to meet the steep hikes in consumer prices. On February 21, the parliament approved a 120 dinar ($440) monthly pay rise for nationals in the public and private sectors after inflation hit 7.3%, a 15-year high. It also decided to raise by 50 dinars ($183) the pay of foreigners employed by the government. In response, Al-Enezi said, “We reject this increase because it is well below expectations. We urge the government to review its decision." 
The average monthly salary of Kuwaiti employees is more than 1,000 dinars ($3,650), but lower for expatriates.
Dispute with MP Al-Mulaifi.
On September 4, 2008, Al-Enezi blasted opposition MP Ahmed Al-Mulaifi for criticizing Prime Minister Nasser Mohammed Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah. Al-Mulaifi had attacked the Prime Minister for planning a trip to the United States and the United Nations at a time when "there are plenty of tense and complicated issues domestically."
Supports Project Kuwait.
Al-Enezi supports Project Kuwait.

The Ascent of Money

The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World is Harvard professor Niall Ferguson's tenth book, published in 2008, and an adapted television documentary for Channel 4 (UK) and PBS (US). It examines the long history of money, credit, and banking.
Documentary.
The book was adapted into a six(6)-part television documentary with the new full title "Ascent of Money: Boom and Bust" for Channel 4 in the UK. It also aired on TVB Pearl in Hong Kong and ABC1 in Australia. In the US, an edited two-hour version was aired in January 2009 by PBS.
A newer, reorganized four-hour version with the original full title "The Ascent of Money: The Financial History of the World" was aired in July 2009 by PBS. Both versions can still be viewed online at the link below.
Episodes - Original Version.
Ep. 1: Dreams of avarice.
From Shylock's pound of flesh to the loan sharks of Glasgow, from the "promises to pay" on Babylonian clay tablets to the Medici banking system. Professor Ferguson explains the origins of credit and debt and why credit networks are indispensable to any civilization.
Ep. 2: Human bondage.
How did finance become the realm of the masters of the universe? Through the rise of the bond market in Renaissance Italy. With the advent of bonds, war finance was transformed and spread to north-west Europe and across the Atlantic. It was the bond market that made the Rothschilds the richest and most powerful family of the 19th century.
Ep. 3: Blowing bubbles.
Why do stock markets produce bubbles and busts? Professor Ferguson goes back to the origins of the joint stock company in Amsterdam and Paris. He draws telling parallels between the current stock market crash and the 18th century Mississippi Bubble of Scottish financier John Law and the 2001 Enron bankruptcy. He shows why humans have a herd instinct when it comes to investment, and why no one can accurately predict when the bulls might stampede.
Ep. 4: Risky business.
Life is a risky business – which is why people take out insurance. But faced with an unexpected disaster, the state has to step in. Professor Ferguson travels to post-Katrina New Orleans to ask why the free market can't provide some of the adequate protection against catastrophe. His quest for an answer takes him to the origins of modern insurance in the early 19th century and to the birth of the welfare state in post-war Japan.
Ep. 5: Safe as houses.
It sounded so simple: give state-owned assets to the people. After all, what better foundation for a property-owning democracy than a campaign of privatisation encompassing housing? An economic theory says that markets can't function without mortgages, because it's only by borrowing against their assets that entrepreneurs can get their businesses off the ground. But what if mortgages are bundled together and sold off to the highest bidder?
Ep. 6: Chimerica.
Niall Ferguson investigates the globalisation of the Western economy and the uncertain balance between the important component countries of China and the US. In examining the last time globalisation took hold – before World War One, he finds a notable reversal, namely that today money is pouring into the English-speaking economies from the developing world, rather than out.

Jakugo

, or of a kōan is a proof of solution of the case riddle, but not the solution itself. In Zen Buddhism, kōan is used both as a meditation device and as an expression of – a radical experiential insight into the nature of things and the self alike. A capping phrase is supposedly an articulation of such enlightening experience, most of the time in verse.
V. Sōgen Hori describes the process of the kōan training as follows:
"Rinzai monasteries in Japan vary in the way they conduct kōan practice, but in the Myōshin-ji–Daitoku-ji branch, when a monk has passed a kōan the Zen teacher will instruct him to bring a “capping phrase” ... The monk selects a verse or phrase that expresses the insight he has had while meditating on the kōan. He searches for this capping phrase in one of the several Zen phrase books that have been especially compiled for this purpose. If the monk continues into advanced stages of the Rinzai Zen kōan curriculum, he will receive further literary assignments: the writing of explanations in Japanese, called "kakiwake" 書き分け, and the composition of Chinese-style poetry, called "nenrō"　拈弄... The research and writing required to complete "kakiwake" and "nenrō" writing assignments can consume considerable amounts of time during the later stages of a monk’s stay in the monastery."

NATO Architecture Framework

The NATO Architecture Framework is an Enterprise Architecture framework by the NATO derived from the DoDAF Enterprise architecture.
The current NATO C3 System Architecture Framework v2 (NAF v2), issued by NATO in September 2004 provides guidance on describing communication and information systems. Revision 3 of the NATO Architecture Framework (NAF), promulgated in November 2007, is identical to MODAF at its core, but extends the framework by adding views for Bandwidth Analysis, SOA and standard configurations.

The documentation of the NAF Rev 3 views (Chapter 4) does not always align well with the NAF Meta Model (Chapter 5).

Some NAF users find it useful to first of all refer the official MODAF Documentation - [http://www.mod.uk/modaf].

In the Shadow of a Thousand Suns

In the Shadow of a Thousand Suns is the debut album by American black metal band Abigail Williams. It was released on October 28, 2008 on Candlelight Records. The album peaked at #35 on "Billboard"'s Top Heatseekers chart.
The album was reissued on January 12, 2010 as a deluxe edition that included a second disc featuring five previously unreleased tracks. The vinyl pressing of the reissue was limited to 1,000 copies.
History.
The album was produced by James Murphy (former guitarist of Death, Obituary, Testament, and Cancer). Trym Torson, of Emperor and Enslaved, played drums on the majority of the album, excluding the tracks "Floods," "Acolytes," and "Empyrean." Most of the songs were written by vocalist Ken Sorceron while the band was on hiatus in 2007. The album took more than six months to record.
Abigail Williams released the deluxe edition of "In the Shadow of a Thousand Suns" on January 12, 2010, which included a second disc featuring four new songs, one unreleased demo of "Floods," and the music video for "Into the Ashes." Demo versions of these tracks were made available on the digital download "Tour 2009 EP", released November 9, 2009. The EP consisted of "I Am (God)," "In Death Comes the Great Silence," the instrumental "Waiting for the Rain," "Infernal Divide," and "Floods." The demo version of "Floods" was included on the new release because, as Sorceron stated, "it captures the vibe of the song better than the album track; perhaps due to the work of original drummer Zack Gibson."
"Into the Ashes" music video.
Concept.
The music video for "Into the Ashes" intercuts a brief tale of a girl and a man with the band performing the song in a catacomb setting. The dark ambiance and characters' period dress creates a gothic feel over the entire video, although the band members remain in contemporary apparel, including t-shirts and jeans.
The story begins during the instrumental introduction of the song. A girl sets a dining room table in a dark room lit only with two candles. A man appears from off screen and sits down opposite the girl. In the next sequence, the two of them are shown dancing within the catacombs, shown in silhouette and shadow. As the girl steps into the light, the man lets her go and walks away. The song jumps into its heavy, fast-tempo riffs, and the video repeatedly cuts between shots of the guitarists and drummer while the girl slowly walks back into the shadows.
As Sorceron begins singing, the element of camera shake is introduced. The girl wanders emotionally through rooms of paraphernalia, her face always remaining dark or covered by her hands. The video begins focusing on the band members' performances, cutting between guitars, drums, keyboards, and singing, infrequently using strobing lights to emphasize the double-bass rhythm.
A close-up of the girl's face, now sleeping, reveals make-up smeared from tears. The song breaks down into a slower, heavier bridge, and the girl is shown looking in a mirror, applying lipstick. In the dark area of the mirror, a man's face appears, disappearing immediately as she turns around in surprise. The man is seen in silhouette, walking away from a single chair. As he walks around the corner, the song reverts to its faster riffs and a single shot of the man and girl together appears briefly. The video cuts to the girl sleeping, and the man's hand reaches out to her from offscreen. She wakes up, and the two characters are reunited.
Production.
"Into the Ashes" was directed by Khaled Lowe and Ben Caird and edited by Lowe. Cinematography was done by Kathinka Minthe, who shot the video on the DVCPRO HD format. Visual effects work was done by Alex Arpaillange.
Cameo lighting was incorporated throughout the entire video, although the story portion of the video altered its single point of light to achieve both chiaroscuro and silhouette effects. The band was almost consistently lighted from the "front" (behind the camera), with varying degrees of brightness, at times revealing the subterranean backdrop. The band was shown in complete silhouette only briefly during strobed sequences.
Filming took place beneath the London Bridge immediately after the band had returned from eight weeks of touring. Sorceron described the location as, " dungeon-like area that they used to store dead bodies in. We felt right at home, minus the smell, of course." The video is anachronistic in that the band lineup changed drastically after its release. Sorceron is the only member in the video to remain in Abigail Williams.
"Into the Ashes" had its television premiere on MTV's "Headbangers Ball" on December 6, 2008, although the video was posted online prior to this.

Vienna Concert

Vienna Concert is a live solo piano album by American pianist Keith Jarrett, released on the ECM label in 1992. It was recorded in concert on July 13, 1991 at the Vienna Staatsoper in Vienna, Austria. Many listeners regard this album as Jarrett's masterpiece. It has a forty-two-minute arch-like opening movement that exhibits a much greater debt to classical music than Jarrett's earlier improvised concerts. Jarrett himself wrote in the liner notes to this album: "I have courted the fire for a very long time, and many sparks have flown in the past, but the music on this recording speaks, finally, the language of the flame itself."
Reception.
The Allmusic review by Richard S. Ginell awarded the album 4 stars stating "Jarrett's exalted judgment is close to the mark; though more Eurocentric than ever, these are his most impressive solo performances since Sun Bear. ".

Toni Leviste

Marie Antoinette Sarangaya "Toni" Leviste (born August 5, 1973), is a Filipina equestrian athlete. Leviste represented the Philippines in international competitions, such as the FEI World Cup Show, the Southeast Asian Games, the Asian games and the Summer Olympics. Leviste has also been awarded the Philippine Sportswriters Association (PSA) Rider of the Year award from 1992 until 2005.
Career.
Toni Leviste first gained local media attention in 1999 when she won third place in the little-known Sunshine tour grand prix which was held in Jerez de la Frontera, Spain. In the same year, she competed at the World Cup Showjumping Finals, held at Goteborg, Sweden. During this time, she was the first equestrian to represent a country within the Southeast Asian region in the World Cup. Leviste then went on to represent her country in the 2000 Summer Olympics at Sydney, Australia, though eventually finishing at 61st place and failing to medal, she noted that it was more important for her during that time to take part in the games rather than winning. Leviste competed again in the 2008 summer games and is currently preparing for a final run at the 2012 London Olympics. At the 2002 Asian games, Leviste alongside Mikee Cojuangco-Jaworski won team silver in the team jumping event. She has also won several regional tournaments, such as winning the 2004 Globe Platinum Cup in Manila, the 2004 Merdeka Masters in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, the 2005 Sony Ericsson Cup in Manila and the 2005 Malaysian Open in Kuwang, Malaysia. Her last major tournament win was in 2008 when she won first place in the CSI-Dinard young horse competition in Dinard, France. In 2010 she was initially named to the Philippines team for the Asian Games in Guangzhou, China, but she did not compete because the Philippine Olympic Committee decided not to field an equestrian team in order to avoid the high cost of transporting horses to the games.
Equestrian park.
Leviste opened a 10-hectare Equestrian park in the outskirts of Lipa city, Batangas. The facility, which Leviste describes as a "horse spa", includes a "European-style" barn and grass paddocks where horses can graze individually or communally. The facility also has a manor in which athletes can be housed while training in the facility.
Personal life.
Toni Leviste is the daughter of detained former Batangas Governor Antonio Leviste and his first wife Celia Sarangaya. She has been a practicing Muslim since 2004 and has been active in the World Islamic Economic Forum since 2010. Leviste has also been featured as an image model for local Philippine clothing brands such as Bayo, Freeway, Tango and other popular brands like Globe Telecom, Sony Ericsson, Cebuana Lhullier and Clinique.

Mandatory Retirement Age for Teachers.
On November 28, 2008, MP Abdullah Al-Roumi joined MPs Bin Essa, Hassan Johar, Musallam Al-Barrak, and Marzouq AlـHubaini Al-Azmi in formulating a bill to extend the mandatory retirement age for Kuwaiti teaching staff at Kuwait University from 65 to 70 years. Al-Roumi argued that Item 32 of Law no. 15/1979 has denied the country services of able and intelligent academicians by restricting retirement age of Kuwaitis to 65 years. He recommended that a clause be added to the law such that the retirement age can become 70 years and can further be extended to 75 years.

Ma'ale Akrabim massacre

The Ma'ale Akrabim massacre was an attack on an Israeli civilian passenger bus, carried out on 17 March 1954, in the middle of the day. Eleven passengers were shot dead by the attackers who ambushed and boarded the bus. Four passengers survived, 2 of whom had been injured by the gunmen.
Background.
Scorpions Pass (, "Ma'ale Akrabim") is a narrow, winding grade on the old road connecting Eilat and Beersheba, just south of Makhtesh Katan, and roughly 60 miles south of Beersheba. The pass was on the primary route between Eilat and central Israel in 1954.
The 1948 Arab–Israeli war ended with the signing of several armistice agreements between Israel and her neighboring Arab states, but border clashes began almost immediately after the signing agreements. On the Israeli-Jordanian border lines, infiltrations, unarmed (71%) and armed (29%), were not infrequent from both sides. According to Israeli sources, between June 1949 and the end of 1952, a total of 57 Israelis, mostly civilians, were killed by infiltrators from Jordan. The Israeli death toll for the first 9 months of 1953 was 32. Over roughly the same time (November 1950 – November 1953), the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan/Israel Mixed Armistice Commission (HJK/IMAC) condemned Israeli military reprisal actions 44 times and claimed that it suffered 629 killed and injured from Israeli incursions. Similar attacks, carried out largely by Palestinian commandos likely with some Egyptian support, originated from across the Egyptian border and the Gaza strip. Israel historian Benny Morris states that between 1949 and 1956 between 200 and 250 Israelis were killed by infiltrators and a similar number of Israeli soldiers were killed in action. Other sources give a total of 1,300 killed over this period. Between 2,700 and 5,000 infiltrators were killed in the same period, the great majority of whom were unarmed. A group named as the "Black Hand", composed of predominantly Bedouin from 'Azazme and Tarrabin tribes living within the al-Auja Demilitarised zone, were known to be carrying out 'revenge raids' principally against other Bedouin, informers in the area but also against Israeli targets.
In the Negev, Israel embarked on development projects, which became the target of theft by Bedouins. Israeli security forces' shooting of these Bedouin had created blood feuds in the area.
The attack.
On the night of 16 March, a bus operated by the Egged Israel Transport Cooperative Society on an unscheduled journey carrying 14 passengers made its way from Eilat to Tel Aviv. As it was climbing up the steep grade, it was ambushed by gunmen who shot and killed the driver as well as passengers who tried to escape; they then proceeded to board the bus and shoot and pilfer from the remaining passengers. The male driver, Efraim Firstenberg, was killed, along with eight male passengers and two female passengers. The four survivors were two Israeli soldiers, a woman, and a five-year-old girl, Miri Firstenberg (whose parents were both killed in the attack), after one of the soldiers riding the bus defended her with his body.
Tracking.
The next day, Israeli trackers assisted by police dogs and accompanied by UN observers followed the attackers' tracks to a point 6 miles west of the Jordanian border, where the tracks were lost. Relying on informants, Israeli intelligence sources named 3 suspects from the Jordanian village of Safi as the perpetrators and Lt. Colonel Shalev passed the names to Elmo Hutchison. The Jordanians continued in their endeavours to discover the perpetrators of the attack.
Aftermath.
Despite public outcry and call for military retaliation against Jordan, Israel's prime minister Moshe Sharett called for restraint and diplomatic measures, as less than six months before the events, Unit 101 had attacked the village of Qibya as part of Israel's retaliation policy, which resulted in the deaths of 69 people and worldwide condemnation.
Israel requested that the Jordan–Israel Mixed Armistice Commission (HJK/IMAC) denounce Jordan for the crime. Jordan's representative to the HJK/IMAC pointed out the possibility of the atrocity being carried out by Israeli Bedouin, and HJK/IMAC Chairman, Commander Hutchinson abstained as there was no conclusive proof, resulting in no decision. As a result, Israel left the HJK/IMAC.
Hutcheson suggested that the attackers were either Gaza Bedouin or Israeli Bedouin. John Bagott Glubb suggested that the culprits were from Gaza. This theory gained credibility when, in 1956, an ID from the Ma’ale Akrabim incident was found in Gaza. Many believe that Glubb had been right and Israel wrong, and that the Ma'ale Akrabim killers had indeed come from Egyptian-controlled territory rather than Jordan.
The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs cited the Ma'ale Akrabim incident as evidence that Arab terrorist attacks preceded the 1967 Six Day War, in which Israel gained territory that included the West Bank and Gaza Strip. In 2007, a reconstructed bus was placed in the Eilat City Museum.

Family and education.
Joseph Francisco was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, on March 26, 1955. He was born to Lucinda and Joe Francisco.,Sr but grew up in Beaumont, Texas with his grandmother Sarah Walker. As he was growing up in Beaumont, Texas, his possibilities were limited because of who he was and what he looked like. His life consisted of day-to-day tasks and was never about future planning. College was a far-fetched dream, so he never paid much attention to it. Despite the uncertainty, his grandmother, Sarah Walker, who was a strong woman and a great role model for him—was supportive and encouraged him to get an education. He attended Forest Park High School.
Dr. Richard B. Price Of Lamar University who he had met by chance encouraged him to pursue a college education. In 1973, he entered the University of Texas, Austin and graduated in 1977. He entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), as a graduate student (PhD, and graduated in 1983). In 1983, at age 27, Francisco decided to travel to pursue and obtain his Postdoctoral research Fellow in Cambridge University, England. In 1992, Francisco married Priya, and has three daughters. He currently resides in Indiana with his family.
Career.
Academic chemist.
As a researcher, Francisco has made important contributions in many areas of Atmospheric Chemistry. His research revolutionized our understanding of chemical processes in the atmosphere.
Francisco and his colleague Marsha Lester, the University of Pennsylvania's Edmund J. Kahn Distinguished Professor have discovered an unusual molecule that is essential to the atmosphere's ability to break down pollutants, especially the compounds that cause acid rain. It's the unusual chemistry facilitated by this molecule, however, that will attract the most attention from scientists.
Somewhat like a human body metabolizing food, the Earth's atmosphere has the ability to "burn," or oxidize pollutants, especially nitric oxides emitted from sources such as factories and automobiles. What doesn't get oxidized in the atmosphere falls back to Earth in the form of acid rain.
"The chemical details of how the atmosphere removes nitric acid have not been clear," Francisco says. "This gives us important insights into this process. Without that knowledge we really can't understand the conditions under which nitric acid is removed from the atmosphere.
Francisco says the discovery will allow scientists to better model how pollutants react in the atmosphere and to predict potential outcomes.A technical paper describing the molecule is published in a special edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of science.
Francisco's laboratory focuses on basic studies in spectroscopy, kinetics, and photochemistry of novel transient species in the gas phase. Joe has published more than 400 journal articles, written nine book chapters and co-authored the textbook, Chemical Kinetics and Dynamics.

Minority governments in Canada

In Canada's parliamentary system of responsible government, minority governments occur when no party has a majority of seats in the legislature, and the party with a plurality forms government. In a minority situation, governments must rely on the support of other parties to stay in power, providing less stability than a majority government. In Canada, political parties rarely form official coalition governments to form a majority.
Canada's plurality voting system means that minority governments are relatively rare in comparison with countries that have a proportional representation voting system. There have, however, been several minority governments at the federal level and in nine of Canada's ten provinces at various times. 
Federal level.
Canada has had thirteen different minority governments, most recently experiencing its longest period of minority government with three successive minority governments between 2004 and 2011.
Provincial level.
Of Canada`s ten provinces, only Alberta has never had a minority government. The territories of Northwest Territories and Nunavut do not have political parties and are instead governed under the consensus government system.

Mohammed Al-Sager

Mohammed Jassem Al-Sager (born 18 June 1951; ) is an award-winning journalist, former member of the National Assembly of Kuwait, and former chairman of the Arab Parliament.
Background.
Al-Sager received a Bachelor's degree in economics from Whittier College (California, US) in 1975. He then worked for five years at the Industrial Bank of Kuwait, where he became Corporate Finance Manager. In 1980, he left the bank to become Chairman and Managing Director of Coast Investment & Development Co.
Journalism.
In 1983 he began working as a journalist, serving as editor-in-chief of "Al-Qabas" (English: "The Firebrand"), a daily newspaper. He continued in the role until his election to Parliament in 1999. In 1992 he was awarded the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists "for courageous reporting on political and human rights issues in the face of government threats of censorship and prosecution".
Along with colleague Ibrahim Marzouk, he was sentenced to six months in prison in 1998 on charges of "insulting the essence of the Divine Being", following the publication of a joke on "Al-Qabas"'s "Entertainment" page: "Why did God expel Adam and Eve from paradise? Because they did not pay the rent." The newspaper was also closed for one week. The Committee to Protect Journalists protested the men's sentences, which were overturned by an appeals court in January 1999.
Political career.
Al-Sager served in the National Assembly of Kuwait from 1999 to 2009. While political parties are technically illegal in Kuwait, Al-Sager affiliates with the liberal National Democratic Alliance party. In 2006, he and Musallam Al-Barrak opposed Minister of Information Mohammed Al-Sanousi's re-appointment, due to the limits they said he had placed on freedom of the press. Al-Sanousi resigned on 17 December 2006, one day before he was due to be grilled by parliament. Al-Barrak suggested Al-Sanousi had been forced to quit, calling it "a victory for the constitution, democracy and freedom". 
From 2005 to 2009, he also served as Chairman of the Arab Parliament, in which role he worked with King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt to promote a reconciliation between battling Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah. Al-Sager is also a member of the General Secretariat of the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations.
In May 2009, Al-Sager joined several other Kuwaiti MPs in declining to run for re-election to the Kuwaiti National Assembly. Al-Sager stated that he believed the next parliament would "also fail to implement the awaited reforms", these being an economic stimulus bill and a boost to the country's infrastructure.

Defended Education Minister Nouria al-Subeih.
On January 22, 2008, the parliament voted 27-19, with two abstentions, against the impeachment of Education Minister Nouria al-Subeih.
In the lead-up to the vote, Saleh Ashour, Ali Al-Daqbaashi, Musallam AlـBarrak and Hussein Muzyed spoke against the minister while Al-Saraawi, Khalaf Al-Enezi, Ali Al-Rashid, and Mohammed Al-Sager spoke in her defense.
Subeih had to defend herself against allegations that she had attempted to deceive the nation when she denied a press report that three male students had been sexually assaulted by an Asian worker at a state school. She explained she had been misinformed and issued an apology.
Islamist lawmaker Saad al-Shreih also accused Subeih of not showing enough respect for Islam when she did not punish a 14-year-old girl who had allegedly drawn a cross on her religion text book and scribbled notes on it that she hated Islam. The minister told the house there was no evidence the girl had actually done that and so she was just referred to counseling. Shreih, however, still managed to gather the requisite signatures of ten lawmakers to force the no-confidence vote.
Resignation of Oil Minister.
On June 25, 2007, Al-Saraawi, Abdullah Al-Roumi, Musallam Al-Barrak accused Oil Minister Sheik Ali Al Jarrah Al-Sabah of using his influence when he was chief executive officer of Kuwait's Burgan Bank to open accounts at the request of his cousin, in the names of paper companies so that they could be used for siphoning the stolen money. Minister Al-Sabah, who is a member of the royal family, resigned before a vote of no-confidence could be held against him. Transportation Minister Sharedah al-Mawashergi resigned in solidarity with the Oil Minister.
Supports Government Funds for College Tuition.
On September 28, 2008, Al-Saraawi, along with MPs Abdullah Al-Roumi, Ali Al-Rashid, and Marzouq Al-Ghanem have proposed a draft law which suggests that the government fund Kuwaiti students' higher education at private colleges. According to the bill, the government would bear half of the expenses for students enrolled in private universities in Kuwait, excluding Kuwait University.
Debate over Future Generations Fund.
In November 2008, Al-Saraawi submitted a request for an expanded debate on the impact of the global financial crisis on Kuwaiti investments abroad, specifically the Future Generations Fund and the State Reserves Fund. The two funds are managed by Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA), the country's sovereign wealth fund, mostly in the United States and Europe. Its assets were estimated at close to $300 billion before the outbreak of the global crisis. Saraawi said that it is no secret that there is a direct impact from the global financial meltdown on Kuwaiti investments. He added that MPs also want to know the extent of this impact on the country's financial surpluses in the past few years. A number of top officials, including the finance minister and the governor of the Central Bank, have explicitly said that Kuwaiti foreign holdings have been impacted by the crisis but stressed that the effect has so far been "small."

Socapex

Socapex is a brand of electrical connectors, known in the entertainment industry primarily for their 19-pin electrical connectors, commonly known as Socapex connectors, and used in film, television, and stage lighting to terminate the ends of a multicable. They are wired with six hot/live pins, six neutral pins, six ground/earth pins, and a final central pin used to aid alignment of the male end of the connector with a female receptacle. The Socapex was first created by a company called Socapex in 1961, which later on became Amphenol Socapex. "Socapex" became a brand name owned by Amphenol Socapex, the term is now often applied to similar off-brand connectors as a genericized trademark. "Breakouts" are used to connect the fixtures to the cable. The breakout consists of a male Socapex connector with six "tails" with female Edison plug, stage pin connector, IEC 60309 16 A, NEMA L5-20P 'twist-lock' or BS 546 15 A connectors. A "breakin" is the opposite, consisting of "tails" with male Edison, stage pin connectors, IEC 60309 16 A, NEMA L5-20R 'twist-lock' or BS 546 connectors feeding a female socapex connector. These are used to connect Socapex cables to dimmer packs that do not have Socapex outputs.
Amphenol Socapex is still manufacturing and selling the original Socapex. The company also manufacturers a wider range of robust multi-way electrical connectors available in various standard and custom configurations. These are used for other high-current applications within live events; commonly for trunk cables to connect PA speakers or stage wedges to amplifiers, usually using breakin and breakout cables to NL2/NL4/NL8 or EP5. While some companies use Socapex as a rigging motor power cable, this is generally not recommended as differences in voltage (i.e., 400 V vs. 230 V) can be misinterpreted, causing extensive equipment damage.
Please note that the image above displays CEEP connectors who were the first company to introduce the mono piece backshell into the market many years ago.

William Shelton (Chief)

William Shelton (1869-1938) was the last hereditary chief of the Snohomish in Tulalip, Washington. He was also an author, a notable sculptor, and an emissary between the Snohomish people and the United States government.
Shelton was one of the few Snohomish to speak both English (which he learned when he enrolled himself in a mission school) and Lushootseed, the language of the Coast Salish.
During his lifetime, Shelton carved a number of story poles (often mistakenly called totem poles), very few of which still remain. One of those remaining story poles was cut in half after it began to rot. The top half now stands on the grounds of the Tulalip Elementary School. Historical photos of the complete pole exist in the digitized holdings of the nearby Everett Public Library.)
Shelton's 1925 book "The Story of the Totem Pole or Indian Legends" is subtitled "Early Indian Legends As Handed Down From Generation To Generation Are Herewith Recorded By Chief William Shelton Of Tulalip, Washington." The book is the only record of many legends of the Coast Salish people. At a time when the US government sought to destroy all vestiges of Native American culture in the Pacific Northwest, Shelton was able to work out a deal with Washington State governor Roland Hartley wherein he was permitted to carve a story pole in exchange for his willingness to create a written record of the oral legends behind the figures he wished to carve on the pole.
At the time of Shelton's death in 1938, the 71-foot pole was still unfinished. Members of the tribe finished carving the pole on his behalf. That pole stood on the grounds of the state capitol campus in Olympia, Washington, until November 3, 2010, when it was removed due to safety concerns.
Shelton was married to Ruth Sehome Shelton (Siastenu), who survived him by 20 years, until Oct. 4, 1958. Ruth was a fluent speaker of Chinook, a trade lingo derived from French, English, and Native American languages.

Adoptive immunity

Adoptive immunity acts in a host after his immunological components are withdrawn, their immunological activity is modified extracorporeally, and then reinfused into the same host. This process in its former part is analogous to adoption: a child is once adopted out from his home, grown up, and then returned to his home of birth. Transferred immunological components include immune cells such as T lymphocytes or tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes, NK cells, macrophages, or B cells.
There seems to be some variation in usage of this term.
The term is used almost synonymously for "passive immunity" in some situations, however, passive immunity acts among xenogeneic hosts; for example, in snake venom immunotherapy, antivenom IgG is obtained from sensitized horse and inoculated to men.
Immunological terms with an adjective ""adoptive"".
The following terms might indicate procedures involving similar immunological transfer processes.

Supports Increase in Minimum Wage.
Al-Otaibi and Khalaf Al-Enezi have both dismissed past wage increases as “too small” and not enough to meet the steep hikes in consumer prices. On February 21, the parliament approved a 120 dinar ($440) monthly pay rise for nationals in the public and private sectors after inflation hit a 15-year high. It also decided to raise by 50 dinars ($183) the pay of foreigners employed by the government. In response, Al-Otaibi said, “The pay raise announced by the government is very disappointing and too small. It will do nothing in the face of the excessive rise in prices of consumer goods...We will pass a law to add at least another 50 dinars ($183)."
The average monthly salary of Kuwaiti employees is more than 1,000 dinars ($3,650), but lower for expatriates.

Doctor Nemesis

Doctor Nemesis is the name of two characters from Marvel Comics.
Publication history.
The first Doctor Nemesis was a derivative version of the eponymous Golden Age character that originally appeared in Ace Magazines' "Lightning Comics". He is a co-creator of the original Human Torch android, and appears in "Uncanny X-Men" as a member of the X-Club. Doctor Nemesis will appear in "Cable and X-Force", a new series by writer Dennis Hopeless and artist Salvador Larroca and set to debut in December 2012.
Doctor Nemesis is also the alias used by Michael Stockton, an enemy of Henry Pym's who uses Pym Particles.
Fictional character biography.
James Bradley.
Although primarily trained as a medical physician, Dr. James Bradley began working in the late 1930s with Professor Phineas T. Horton in developing the original android Human Torch of World War II. While mostly a silent partner in this endeavor, Dr. Bradley began building a second android during this time.
The two scientists were unable to correct the design flaw that would cause their android to burst into flames upon exposure to oxygen. Bradley had preferred they resolve this issue before revealing their work to the public. However, Horton, eager for both fame and further financial backing held a press conference in late 1939 debuting their work. This turned into a public relations disaster, as Bradley had predicted, when the android caught on fire, causing the press to label it a menace. Bradley broke off their partnership thereafter and took his unfinished second android with him.
Sometime before 1941, Bradley completed his work and the second android acted as the superhero Volton, the Human Generator, from late 1941 to early 1942. Unaware of its artificial origins, Bradley led Volton to believe it was a scientist named Guy Newton who had discovered how to utilize his body's power to generate static electricity. Around this time, Bradley also decided to become a masked crimefighter, too. While working by day at Mercy Hospital in New York City, he would don a surgical mask and arm himself with a hypodermic gun to fight corruption and crime as Doctor Nemesis.
After a number of adventures, Doctor Nemesis was approached by agents of the Third Reich to form a group of costumed beings. Signifying a change in tactics, Bradley changed his alter-ego to Dr. Death and recruited Human Meteor, Spider Queen, Strongman and Volton for the group, Battle-Axis. The members of Battle-Axis did not, necessarily, agree with the Nazi policies and agenda but, for a variety of reasons, sought to force the United States to pull out of World War II. Doctor Death started work on "Project Mojave". Using an experimental device called an oscillotron, Battle-Axis would cause a severe earthquake on the U.S. west coast. Besides causing much damage to American cities, it would destroy the war industry plants and release poison gas from underground storage. With such devastation, the U.S. would be forced to withdraw from the war in order to deal with its homefront crisis.
On June 22, 1942, Battle-Axis made their public debut protecting a German U-Boat from the Invaders attack. The two teams battled several times as the Invaders slowly unraveled Doctor Death's secret plans. Doctor Death kidnapped the Blue Bullet (John Goldstein) to employ him in his Project Mojave, and his brother Jacob was obliged to obey his orders in exchange for John's life. Jacob was forced, as the Golem, to attack the Invaders in Doctor Death's plan to force the USA out of involvement in World War II. When the Invaders attacked Doctor Death's base, the Golem remained neutral to keep from putting his brother in danger. John escaped during the battle, but was shot by Sky Shark. Though the Invaders were able to stop Doctor Death's plan, the Blue Bullet died.
In their final confrontation, Doctor Death was able to get the oscillotron activated when he was struck down by Volton. The android had learned of its origins and Doctor Death's own role in keeping it secret. The Sub-Mariner was able to shutdown the machine and Doctor Death was left for dead.
Somehow surviving the attack, Bradley returned to New York City. Apparently repentant, he assumed his original costumed persona of Doctor Nemesis. Continuing on his war on crime, he became engaged to his co-worker, Nurse Mary Strong. The majority of his wartime activities remain unchronicled.
After the war, Doctor Nemesis moved to Buenos Aires, Argentina to hunt down any Nazi superscientists and any of their clones.
Many years later, Doctor Nemesis was approached by Beast and Angel to help assist in undoing M-Day. Doctor Nemesis had no interest in undoing the "spell" that turned off the X-gene. But after defeating two Super Nazis, he agrees to join McCoy's science team. They later locate and recruit Madison Jeffries (formerly of Alpha Flight). When they return to San Francisco, they are joined by Dr. Kavita Rao. The X-team later time-travel back to turn-of-the-century San Francisco in order to obtain genetic samples for study, from the biological parents of one of the first of the modern (20th century) wave of mutants. The mutant in question is actually Doctor Nemesis himself, who reveals to the rest of the team his power of "self-evolved intellect", which allowed him to greatly extend his longevity through his own invented serums. His father is a brilliant radical inventor who actually manages to invent a self-powered electric light bulb, and his mother is her husband's bodyguard. Doctor Nemesis' father is killed when he helps the X-Club stop the Hellfire Club's first-ever Sentinel from ravaging across San Francisco. Nemesis' mother later dies in childbirth, as she is already in a weakened condition from the trauma of losing her spouse. Unknown to the rest of the X-Men, Dr. Nemesis delivered himself as he secretly traveled back in time again to be the Doctor of his own mother. The X-Club are ultimately unable to obtain the couple's genetic samples as it appears that they are being deliberately blocked by the Dreaming Celestial (because they would not have survived the time-jump back to the present, they were buried in a cryogenic capsule in Golden Gate Park) as part of some grand cosmic plan.
After rescuing Beast and Professor X from Norman Osborn's prison, Doctor Nemesis and the rest of the X-Club join the X-Men on the risen Asteroid M, renamed Utopia, where they mourn the death of Yuriko Takiguchi shortly afterward.
After the arrival of Hope Summers leads to an attack by Bastion, Nemesis and the rest of the X-Club are led to a trap that takes them out of Utopia, where Bastion creates an energy sphere blocking out the entire San Francisco area from the outside world, despite help from the Avengers, they are unable to breach the barrier.
Michael Stockton.
Michael Craig Stockton was a scientist who was inventing a way to look into and study the subatomic worlds. He succeeded and stumbled onto one that was ruled by the tyrant Tim Boo Ba.
At some point, Michael was associated with A.I.M and stationed in a laboratory that was somewhere near Henry Pym's home and laboratory. He plotted to steal Henry Pym's technology and involved himself in the plot of a criminal named M'Sieu Tete. While Dr. Curt Connors was out of town, Michael and M'Sieu Tete's gang kidnapped Billy Connors in a plot to make Curt surrender the narcotics that Curt was working with Henry on. Ant-Man and Spider-Man ended up having to deal with M'Sieu Tete's gang until M'Sieu Tete injected them with a virus to gain their cooperation. Ant-Man and Spider-Man defeated M'Sieu Tete's gang and took the antidote. Unfortunately, Ant-Man was trapped in small size as a side effect of the virus. During this time, Michael managed to pilfer Henry Pym's lab and build a costume for himself using the size-changing circuitry of Ant-Man's helmet and Henry Pym's old Giant-Man costume.
Michael became Doctor Nemesis and captured Ant-Man and Wasp. He did managed to cure Ant-Man of the virus that trapped him in small form. However, he kept Wasp in a weakened state where she would die unless she got further treatments. Doctor Nemesis then forced Henry Pym to take him to Avengers Mansion where he planned to pilfer the scientific secrets there. Doctor Nemesis then had Ant-Man lower the shields around the mansion. Once the shields were down, Ant-Man attacked Doctor Nemesis and defeated him using his greater size-changing experience.
Doctor Nemesis begins to seek his revenge by infiltrating Wasp's mansion where she was throwing a party. Once inside the mansion, Doctor Nemesis donned a suit of miniature adamantium armor which hasn't been worn by Henry Pym. He then ambushed Wasp and attempted to use the armors weapons to shrink Wasp out of existence. Wasp was assisted by the Micronauts (who were trapped on Earth at the time). Doctor Nemesis used the beam on some of the Micronauts before the beam was turned on him by Acroyear. Although those who were hit by the beam ended up in the Microverse, Doctor Nemesis continued to shrink. The effects of the shrinking wore off and Doctor Nemesis returned to normal size.
Henry Pym assisted in the investigation of several Los Angeles crimes that involved size-changing abilities. Henry Pym suspected that Doctor Nemesis was behind this as the places he robbed were New Centuries Labs, the Entwiler Family jewels, and Morgan-Stern Electronics. Henry Pym then deduced that the next place that Doctor Nemesis might rob is Eckman's Electronics where Henry Pym encountered Doctor Nemesis. Although Henry Pym lacked his size-changing abilities at the time, he did managed to tear open Doctor Nemesis' suit while he was in giant form and managed to shrink him back to size upon losing his connection with his helmet. When Doctor Nemesis was back at normal size, Henry Pym then punched him out.
Under the alias of Dr. Stockton, Doctor Nemesis was employed at Stane International and headed a project that developed the M.A.U. (short for Mass Acquisition Unit). He was assisted on the project by Dr. Edward Hawkins and Bill Foster (since Henry Pym was unavailable at the time) who assisted in the evaluation of the Pym Particles. During this time, the M.A.U. overloaded and causes everything in the area to grow to giant size until Bill Foster (who became Giant-Man) shut it down. Giant-Man then discussed the M.A.U. with Edward stating that it would be too dangerous and would act as a warhead. When Giant-Man attempted to shut the operation down, Dr. Stockton revealed his true identity of Doctor Nemesis and attacked Giant-Man using his size-changing abilities. When Giant-Man started to overpower Doctor Nemesis, Goliath arrived to assist Doctor Nemesis where Goliath overpowered Giant-Man. Doctor Nemesis then attempts to make a deal with Edward Hawkins to assist him. Upon recovering, Giant-Man questions Edward Hawkins who revealed that he planned to stop Doctor Nemesis. When they confronted him, they demanded that Doctor Nemesis desists. Edward Hawkins threatens to turn Doctor Nemesis over to the US Government. Goliath delayed Giant-Man while Doctor Nemesis loads the M.A.U. onto his airplane to escape. This time, Giant-Man defeated Goliath while Edward Hawkins delayed Doctor Nemesis enough for him and Giant-Man to board Doctor Nemesis' airplane. Doctor Nemesis activates the M.A.U. in mid-flight before being knocked out by Giant-Man. Hawkins managed to make a few alterations to the M.A.U. and then had Giant-Man flood it with Pym shrinking particles. After the M.A.U. device was destroyed by Giant-Man, Doctor Nemesis and Goliath were sent to prison.
When the Creatures from Kosmos began attacking Earthlings that had Pym Particles, Doctor Nemesis shrunk himself down to microscopic size where he ended up on Tim Boo Ba's world. He was captured and tortured Tim Boo Ba and his minions before returning to normal size and escaping. While incarcerated at the Big House, Doctor Nemesis attempted to warn the others of Tim Boo Ba. None would listen to him and he even sent an E-Mail to Elsa Bloodstone. When Tim Boo Ba began his rampage in New York, Elsa sent Doctor Nemesis an E-Mail stating that he was right.
Doctor Nemesis was at the Bar with No Name in New York City where he was among the villains watching a fight between Spider-Man and the "Basher" on YouTube. He was among those that placed their bet with the Bookie. When the real Spider-Man arrived after the Spider-Man that fought Basher was actually Screwball in disguise, Doctor Nemesis was among the villains that fought Spider-Man until the bartender Deke broke up the battle telling them that the Bar With No Name is a sanctuary for those on the run from the law.
Powers and abilities.
The first Doctor Nemesis possesses the mutant powers of having a self-described "self-evolved" intellect, making him an instinctively-intuitive scientific & technological genius (like his fellow X-Man, the mutant shaman/inventor Forge). He has delayed his own aging and enhanced his own immune system, leading to a prolonged lifespan. He has also enhanced his eyesight, allowing him to see genetic anomalies, including the Nazi clones he primarily hunted before joining the X-Club, over a distance of . Dr. Nemesis is a polymath who has made major advances in handheld weaponry, medicine, chemistry, genetics, interdimensional travel, computer programming, and robotics.
He arms himself with twin handguns that fire hypodermic projectiles containing dangerous narcotics. The projectiles were tailored to pierce body armor. He developed a sedating truth serum for use as an investigator. He created androids, including the sentient and superhuman android, Volton. He perfected a "dimension smasher" which teleported beings from other dimensions. His oscillotron device can trigger major eathquakes. He is an accomplished investigator and hand to hand combatant.
The costume of the second Doctor Nemesis possessed a device that enabled him to access the Pym Particles that enabled him to grow and shrink in size.
Other versions.
Age of X.
In the "Age of X" reality, Doctor Nemesis is seen in a hidden room built unknown to Magneto himself at the center of the fortress. He is frozen and distorted as he is not completely in this reality. Gambit notices he's looking at some brain scans, probably Legion's.

Jim Holperin

Jim Holperin is an American Democratic politician and administrator.
Holperin served as a member of the Wisconsin State Senate, representing the 12th District in northern Wisconsin from 2009 to 2013. Previously, he was Secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Tourism from 2003 to 2007 and a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly, serving the 34th District from 1982 through 1994. He is the only state legislator in history to face a recall twice — in April 1990 for supporting Native American treaty rights, and in August 2011 as a backlash against Democratic efforts to thwart Governor Scott Walker's attempt to strip public employees of collective bargaining rights. Holperin retained his seat both times.
Early life, education, and early career.
Holperin was born in Eagle River, Wisconsin on December 18, 1950 and grew up there. In 1969, he graduated from Eagle River High School. In 1973, he earned a B.S. from the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater. He also served for nine years as the director of Trees For Tomorrow, a natural resources specialty school focused primarily on conservation education for young people.
Wisconsin legislature.
Assembly.
In 1982, he successfully ran for the 46th District seat in the Wisconsin State Assembly representing Oneida and Vilas Counties. He served on the budget committee and the Joint Committee on Finance. After redistricting based on the 1980 Census, Holperin's district was re-designated as the 34th. In 1990, Holperin faced a recall effort due to his support for Native American treaty rights. At the center of the dispute was the controversy over the treaties between the federal government and the Chippewa tribe, in which the tribe ceded vast lands in northern Wisconsin in exchange for spearfishing, hunting, and timber harvesting rights. Holperin won the recall election handily, winning 61% of the vote. He retired in 1994. He was succeeded by Republican Joe Handrick.
Senate.
In 2003, Governor Jim Doyle appointed him as Secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Tourism. In 2008, he ran to become a State Senator when incumbent Democrat Wisconsin State Senator Roger Breske decided to retire after four-plus terms (1990–2008). He defeated Republican nominee Tim Tiffany with 51% of the vote.
2011 Union protests.
During the 2011 protests in Wisconsin, Holperin, along with the 13 other Democratic State Senators, left the state on February 17 to deny the State Senate a quorum on Governor Scott Walker's controversial budget repair bill. On March 9, Republicans in the State Senate declared that they had removed all fiscal provisions from the fiscal repair bill and passed it without needing a quorum. On March 12, Holperin and the rest of the Democratic Senators returned to Wisconsin.
2011 attempted recall.
Holperin was one of three Democratic state senators facing recall as a result of the 2011 Wisconsin protests. On February 22, 2011, the "Jim Holperin Recall Committee" officially registered with the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board. 15,960 valid signatures of electors residing within the 12th District were required by April 25, 2011 to generate a recall election.
On March 10, 2011, supporters of the recall effort against Holperin complained of intimidation by his supporters. On April 21, 2011, Holperin recall supporters filed about 23,300 signatures on recall petitions. 
Holperin and Kim Simac faced off in the general recall election on August 16, 2011. Holperin won, keeping his seat.
Election 2012.
In March 2012, with his district having been drastically revised by the Republican-controlled legislature, Holperin announced he would not seek re-election in 2012. He was succeeded in the new 12th District by Republican Tom Tiffany.

Weabonga, New South Wales

Weabonga is a small village on Swamp Oak Creek, about 37 km south west of Walcha, 33 km south-southeast of Limbri, New South Wales, Australia. It is in the ridges of the Great Dividing Range and is part of the Tamworth Regional Council local government area and Parry County.
The winding Limbri road to Weabonga follows Swamp Oak Creek, which continues on to just northeast of Kootingal where it joins the Cockburn River. Weabonga, situated 749 metres above sea level, has a temperate climate and an average rainfall of 750 to 850 mm per annum.
The countryside varies from open undulating valleys to steep hills. Some abandoned mines may be seen in the region. Native apples, box trees ("Eucalyptus melliodora"), gums, ironbark, peppermint and stringybark ("Eucalyptus caliginosa") trees are common across the area.
History.
Weabonga, meaning "swampgum", was previously named Rywung, the "resting place", or Swamp Oak. 
By 1848 Peter Brodie held a depasturing licence for the Swamp Oak Creek run which had an estimated carrying capacity of 1,000 cattle and 8,000 sheep. In 1851 this licence was transferred to his wife and following Peter’s death it went to John Gill. Swamp Oak Creek run’s head station was where Limbri now stands. As usual other outstations were utilised for the day to day management and raising of the sheep. The natural geographic features of this country made it sound grazing country for sheep and there was plenty of shelter for the protection of young lambs.
Some alluvial gold was found on the Mulla Creek and Rywung (now Weabonga) on Swamp Oak Creek in the early 1850s. The Tamworth Observer, of 5 August 1890, reported that about 25 men were working for gold on Swamp Oak and Mulla Creeks and Spring Gully. The three main reefs in the Swamp Oak field were ‘the Alpine, the Rainbow and the Storm King lines of reefs’ (Town and Country Journal, 10 January 1891). Up to 50 shafts were sunk into the ground around here and there were 400 to 500 people working here in January 1891. 
During December 1890 Swamp Oak Creek Station shore their 20,000 sheep to produce a high quality clip. In January 1891 more miners and their families began to move into the gold diggings further up this creek to Top Station (an outstation of the old Swamp Oak run and now known as Rywung) and Bungendore (another outstation of Swamp Oak run). The mining onslaught then necessitated the removal of the livestock from this region. 
Swamp Oak, also known as Rywung, was gazetted as a township on 24 January 1891. Three stores, two butcheries, a bakery, blacksmith and several boarding houses were operating before the end of January 1891. During the following month a post office opened and a mail service was commenced. The 1891 census recorded that there were 130 dwellings, 188 males and 24 females in the town. A police station and Court of Petty Sessions was established at Swamp Oak in 1891. The Rywung public school was completed in December 1891. In 1892 a slaughter yard was built by Charles Rowlings at Swamp Oak to provide meat for the miners and their families. Thirty-nine crushing plants were operating at Swamp Oak in 1897.
Most of the gold mining here was in quartz reefs, which necessitated the miners making holes for blasting in the walls and ceiling of mine shafts using a steel rod drill and sledgehammer. Packing the holes with gunpowder, they attached long fuses before igniting the explosives from a safe distance. After rock was blasted from the mine face, miners raised the rock to the surface with a hand-operated windlass before placing it into a crusher to be processed. Gold was mined here until at least 1922 when 3 ounces was recorded as having been found by three miners. It was all heavy tiresome work, often for little reward. Manganese and rhodonite were also mined in significant amounts in the Weabonga area. 
In 1912 the Weabonga Church of England was built and dedicated as St George’s. From 1914 to 1929 the NSW Bush Nursing Association formed a branch at Swamp Oak and provided a qualified nurse to administer assistance as required. A public hall was erected in 1916 after fund raising during World War I produced enough money to complete the construction. In 1917 the name of the township of Swamp Oak was changed to Weabonga. There were 120 electors for Weabonga and the surrounding district recorded in the 1928 Tamworth Electoral Roll. A timber Catholic Church was constructed in 1929. The police station was closed in 1944 and the policing is now under the Walcha Road patrol. Rural power was connected to eight Weabonga consumers in 1966. In 1968 the Weabonga (formerly Rywung) school closed owing to a dwindling population. 
Some devastating flood damage occurred in the upper reaches of Mulla Creek and around Weabonga when the area was flooded on 28 November 2008, just hours after these photos were taken. The Limbri to Weabonga Road is still cut at the Limbri end and two bridges have been bypassed owing to damage. The Sherrin Bridge bridge on this road was very badly damaged.
Sports.
Tennis courts were erected below the Royal Standard Hotel in 1893 for the local players. Two public courts were also constructed in the 1920s, but have since fallen into disrepair.
Cricket teams played against local villages from 1891. A jockey club was formed at Swamp Oak in January 1893 and racing was held at several locations in the region. 
The village has the Weabonga Hall and Recreation Ground Committee, caring for the hall and recreation ground. The area is served by the Weabonga Rural Fire Service.
It is now an agricultural based village, with sheep and cattle breeding the main pursuits.

International matrimonial law

International matrimonial law is an area of private international law (or conflict of laws in the United States). The area specifically deals with relations between spouses and former spouses on issues of marriage, divorce and child custody. In the last 50 years, the States Members of the Hague Conference on Private International Law have attempted to harmonize domestic matrimonial laws and judicial rulings across international borders in these areas.
Marriage.
Hague Marriage Convention.
The Hague Convention that harmonizes different marriage laws, the Convention on the Celebration and Recognition of the Validity of Marriages, was concluded at The Hague on 14 March 1978 and entered into force on 1 May 1991. Article 9 of the Convention holds that, “A marriage validly entered into under the law of the State of celebration or which subsequently becomes valid under that law shall be considered as such in all Contracting States, subject to the provisions of this Chapter.” In short, one Contracting State must recognize a marriage legally performed in another contracting state. Currently only three states (Australia, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands) have ratified the Convention. Another three (Egypt, Finland, and Portugal) have signed it. One of the reasons that the Convention may have so few Contracting States is that states have long observed the principle of comity which has been defined in the United States as the “recognition that one nation allows within its territory to the legislative, executive or judicial acts of another nation, having due regard both to the international duty and convenience and to the rights of its own citizens who are under the protection of its laws.”
Implications for Same-Sex Marriage.
The principle of comity and the Hague Marriage Convention itself may be put to the test on the issue of same-sex marriage. One of the current Contracting States, the Netherlands, recognizes same-sex marriage while none of the other Contracting States or signatories do. A simple fix to this solution would seem to be the Convention’s Article 14. This article states, “A Contracting State may refuse to recognize the validity of a marriage where such recognition is manifestly incompatible with its public policy.” Nevertheless, there are those who feel that the Convention requires Contracting States to recognize same-sex marriages entered into in jurisdictions where such unions are valid. They argue that because the writers of the convention rejected limiting marriage to heterosexual marriage and because the writers called for recognition of marriage in its “broadest, international sense,” same-sex marriage is clearly included in the marriages that the Convention compels Contracting States to recognize. Those who argue that states need not recognize same-sex marriages invoke Article 14 and maintain that because only a small number of states and jurisdictions perform and recognize same-sex marriages, then these unions cannot be considered to conform to any “broad” or “international” view of marriage. 
In 2004, the Australian Parliament passed the Marriage Amendment Act 2004. The effect of this legislation was to amend Australia’s Marriage Act 1961 and to define marriage as “the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life.” In doing so, the references to marriage in the part of the Marriage Act which enshrined the Marriage Convention into Australian law were also defined, thus enabling Australia to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages performed legally abroad.
In France Senator Masson (question number 20257 page 2829 of the official journal) asked the French minister of justice a parliamentary question on whether France would recognise a same sex marriage from Holland. The minister invoked the Hague convention 14 March 1978 stating that if the marriage was legal in the country of those nationals then it would produce effects in France. French nationals who performed a same sex marriage abroad would not have their marriage recognised since their national law did not allow it.
Divorce.
Hague Convention of 1970.
The Hague Convention that compels Contracting States to recognize divorces and legal separations obtained legally in another contracting state is the Hague Convention on the Recognition of Divorces and Legal Separations concluded on 1 June 1970 and entered into force 24 August 1975. Article 1 of the Convention states, “ The present Convention shall apply to the recognition in one Contracting State of divorces and legal separations obtained in another Contracting State which follow judicial or other proceedings officially recognized in that State and which are legally effective there.” The Convention makes clear that it does not apply to any determinations about property or child custody that may accompany a divorce. Only the state of being divorced or legally separated must be recognized. There are certain exceptions. According to the Convention a divorce need not be recognized if both parties were nationals of a state which did not provide for divorce at the time of the divorce (Article 7), if the respondent in a divorce proceeding was not given an adequate chance to present his or her case (Article 8), if to do so would be “incompatible” with a previous determination as to the status of the spouses in the State where they are seeking recognition (Article 9), or if to recognize such a divorce would be manifestly incompatible with the state’s public policy (Article 10). In addition, Article 20 of the Constitution allows a Contracting State to file a reservation stating that that state will not recognize a divorce if at the date of the divorce, “one of the spouses was a national of a state whose laws did not provide for divorce.” 
There are 19 states that are parties the Convention, all of which are in Europe. Many states, including the United States, which is not a Contracting State to the Convention, recognize divorces obtained abroad through the above-mentioned legal principle of comity. The convention also applies to Hong Kong, to which it was extended before its transfer from the United Kingdom to China.
Property Issues.
As the Convention on the Recognition of Divorces and Legal Separations does not deal with matrimonial property in a divorce, the Hague Conference concluded a separate convention on 14 March 1978. The Convention on the Law Applicable to Matrimonial Property Regimes, which entered into force on 1 September 1992, allows spouses in a marriage to decide which jurisdiction’s laws will apply to their property. The Convention provides that they may select the laws of any State of which one of the spouses is a national of at the time of selection, the laws of any state in which one of the spouses has his or her “habitual residence” at the time of selection, or the law of the first state in which one of the spouses establishes a new habitual residence after the marriage. If no such selection is made, the laws of the first state in which the couple had their habitual residence after marriage govern the property. 
The convention has only been ratified by three states (France, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands) and signed by another two (Austria and Portugal). As such, international divorce cases that take place outside of the authority of the convention are not clear-cut. For instance, questions arise when assets are held in trust in a country that neither spouse has an actual connection to through residence or nationality and neither the state in which the trust is located nor the state in which suit is brought (the state of nationality or residence) is a member of the Convention. Some courts have found ways around the jurisdictional issue at hand (i.e. that they have no jurisdiction in another country) especially if the assets are marital and under the control of only one spouse. Such was the case in the New York case of Riechers v. Riechers. In this case the husband had used marital assets to fund a Cook Islands trust; even though the New York court had no jurisdiction over the trust money, they ordered the wife’s share of that money paid from other assets.
The European Union.
Not all efforts to deal with and harmonize the matrimonial aspects of private international law take place at the global level or amongst the members of the Hague Conference. The European Union has been moving towards a common divorce law. The European Commission promulgated the so-called Brussels II regulation in March 2001 in an effort to settle the conflict of laws relating to divorce between the members of the European Union. The regulation, amended in 2005, determines which courts will have jurisdiction over what matters. But even with this regulation, which binds all member states save Denmark, within the EU large differences in divorce laws exist. As one legal scholar has noted: “The substantive law pertaining to legal separation continues to differ widely between the Member States: from Maltese law where there is a prohibition of divorce to Finnish of Swedish law where no actual grounds of divorce are required.” In addition, legal culture in these countries is different on issues of divorce and marital property. Observers note that the generosity of settlements and alimony differ from state to state. With Brussels II holding that the first valid court to process a filing for divorce is the court that will have jurisdiction, it can matter a great deal where in the EU a ruling is made. This is true also in divorces that take place between a European Union citizen and a citizen of another country. High-profile divorce cases such as the one between American pop-star Madonna and her British husband Guy Ritchie, must deal with such issues, especially if one party stands to gain by filing in a certain jurisdiction. (In this case, Ritchie, who is comparatively less well off, would benefit from filing in Britain where settlements tend to be larger and alimony more generous).
Several EU countries have further harmonized their choice of law provisions regarding divorse in the European Union Divorce Law Pact, which entered into force in 2012. Also this regulation does not provide substantive law provisions. 
Child Custody.
While the Hague conference has not concluded any agreements specifically on the issue of child custody, it has dealt with two incidental issues: parental child abduction and child support (or maintenance) payments.
Parental Child Abduction.
The Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction was concluded on 25 October 1980 and entered into force on 1 December 1983. Its goal is to provide that if a child is removed from his habitual residence and custodial status to another country, the child can be returned to the country of his habitual residence thus maintaining the custodial status quo prior to the removal. 
One of the primary issues with this convention is the vagueness of the term “habitually resident.” Because the term is open to interpretation by national courts, the Convention is not necessarily applied uniformly amongst the Contracting States. For example, although a plain-text reading of the convention seems to support the notion that a child is habitually resident in the state he or she lived in prior to abduction, some courts have disagreed. For example, in the 2001 case of Mozes v. Mozes where the wife and children had travelled to the United States from Israel for a period of fifteen months with the consent of the father, during which time the wife obtained a divorce and temporary custody of the children in Los Angeles, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that habitual residence can change. It found that the United States had supplanted Israel as the children’s habitual residence, rejecting the father’s petition for return of the children under the convention.
Child Support.
Among the more recent Hague conventions is the Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and Other Forms of Family Maintenance concluded on 23 November 2007, which entered into force in 2013. This Convention complements the United Nations Convention on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance of 1956. Child support was an area where comity was not always observed, even after the entry into force of the UN convention. There were few signatories of the convention and many people were able to avoid child support payments by moving overseas. The Hague Convention would attempt to solve this problem at least among the Contracting States. It would compel individuals who moved from one Contracting State to another to continue to remit payment by forcing the second Contracting State to enforce the child support agreement from the first. Currently the Convention has signed the entire European Union, plus Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Norway, Ukraine and the United States . In the message he sent to the United States Senate asking them to ratify the treaty, United States President George W. Bush called on the body to act quickly citing the increasing number of 15 million US child support cases that involved “parties who live in different nations.”

Scedosporium prolificans

Scedosporium prolificans is an emerging opportunistic fungal pathogen that causes a wide variety of infections in immunocompetent and immunosuppressed people and animals. Originally named "Lomentospora prolificans" in 1974, it was transferred to the genus "Scedosporium" in 1991. It is resistant to most antifungal drugs and infections are often fatal. Successful control of disseminated "Scedosporium prolificans" infection can be obtained with a combination of voriconazole and terbinafine, but some strains are resistant to this treatment. Drugs that might also be of help are posaconazole, miltefosine and albaconazole. Albaconazole is in Phase III clinical trials.
History.
The genus "Lomentospora" was erected by G. Hennebert and B.G. Desai in 1974 to accommodate a culture obtained from greenhouse soil originating from a forest in Belgium. The fungus, which they named "Lomentospora prolificans", was thought incorrectly to be related to the genus "Beauveria" - a group of insect-pathogenic soil fungi affiliated with the Order Hypocreales. The genus name "Lomentospora" referred to the shape of the apex of the spore-bearing cell, which the authors interpreted to be a rachis resembling a bean pod of the sort constricted at each seed. The species epithet "prolificans" derived from the prolific nature of the mold's sporulation. The fungus was later independently described as "Scedosporium inflatum" by Malloch and Salkin in 1984 from a bone biopsy of the foot of a boy who had stepped on a nail. The species epithet "inflatum" referred to the characteristically swollen base of the spore-bearing cell which they recognized correctly to be an annelide. Malloch and Salkin did not observe a sexual state, however they recognized the fungus to be associated with the family Microascaceae, and suspected it to be allied with the genus "Pseudallescheria". In 1991, Guého and De Hoog re-examined a set of cultures of "Scedosporium"-like fungi from clinical cases by careful morphological examination and the evaluation of DNA-DNA reassociation complementarity. Along with two strains from their own work, they found the cultures of Hennebert & Desai and Malloch & Salkin to constitute a single species which they confirmed to belong in the genus "Scedosporium". "Lomentospora prolificans" was then transferred to "Scedosporium" as "S. prolificans", and "Scedosporium inflatum" became a synonym. This synonymy has since been confirmed by phylogenetic analysis of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer regions. Despite this change, and even as recently as 2012, the name "Scedosporium inflatum" has continued to appear in the medical literature.
Appearance.
"Scedosporium prolificans" produces small, delicate annellides with a distinct basal swelling peculiar to this species and absent in the closely related species, "Scedosporium apiospermum". Annellides necks become long and distinctly annellated with age. Annellides occur individually or in clusters irregularly along undifferentiated hyphae, frequently exhibiting a pronounced penicillate arrangement in older cultures. Conidia are smooth-walled, light to dark brown, 3–7 x 2–3 µm, accumulating in slime droplets at annelide apices. Colonies of "S. prolificans" are grey to brownish, spreading, with scant, cobweb-like aerial mycelium recalling a moth-eaten woolen garment. This species is sensitive to cycloheximide. As this species may be slow to emerge from clinical materials, specimens in which this agent is suspected often require an extended period of culture incubation (e.g., up to 4 weeks).
Ecology.
"Scedosporium prolificans" is a soil fungus, and has been found in the soils of ornamental plants and greenhouse plants. Along with other fungi, "S. prolificans" has been isolated from soils of "Ficus benjamina" and "Brassaia actinophylla" plantings in hospitals, suggesting that these materials have potential to serve as reservoirs of nosocomial fungal pathogens.
Human disease.
"Scedosporium prolificans" has been recognized as an agent of opportunistic human disease since the 1990s. This species is primarily associated with subcutaneous lesions arising from injury following "traumatic implantation" of the agent via contaminated splinters or plant thorns. The majority of "S. prolificans" infections in immunologically normal people remain localized, characteristically with bone or joint involvement. Disseminated infections from "S. prolificans" are largely limited to people with pre-existing immune impairment. Notably, "S. prolificans" exhibits varying tolerance to all currently available antifungal agents. This is particularly true of strains recovered from disseminated infections, and these infections carry a high mortality. "Scedosporium prolificans" has also been known to cause disseminated disease secondary to myeloblastic leukemic and following lung transplant. In otherwise healthy people, it has been recorded as a cause of corneal infection following a lawn trimmer mishap, and bone infection following trauma.
Drug resistance.
Infections caused by "S. prolificans" are recognized to be difficult to treat due to the tendency of this species to exhibit resistance to many commonly used antifungal agents. Successful control of disseminated "Scedosporium prolificans" infection can be obtained with a combination of voriconazole and terbinafine, but some strains are resistant to this treatment. Drugs that might also be of help are posaconazole, miltefosine and albaconazole. Albaconazole is in Phase III clinical trials.

Sunshine, Louisiana

Sunshine is a northern neighborhood of the city of St. Gabriel in Iberville Parish, Louisiana, United States. Located approximately 15 miles south of Baton Rouge along the Mississippi River, the community was originally named Forlorn Hope by inhabitants but was given its current name by business owners Matilda Hickman and Maurice Broussard in 1944. The community was annexed to St. Gabriel in 1987.
The "Sunshine" type of vetiver grass, whose roots have long been used in Louisiana as an insect repellent, was given that name by the USDA in 1989 for Sunshine, Louisiana, where Eugene LeBlanc grew a heritage clone given to his grandparents by Felix Perilloux, who in turn had acquired it from his wife Myrthee Froisy Perilloux in the 1860s. Vetiver was clonally introduced throughout the tropics in the 19th century, and DNA fingerprinting has shown that almost all the vetiver grown worldwide for perfumery, agriculture, and bioengineering is essentially the same nonfertile cultigen as Sunshine. This type of essential-oil vetiver is known by various names in different locations (e.g., 'Monto' in Australia), but because "Sunshine" was the earliest name used in modern times, that is how it is collectively known throughout the world today.

Brent Metcalf

Brent Metcalf (born July 14, 1986) is an American amateur wrestler currently competing in the international circuit for the United States of America. 
Biography.
As a prep wrestler, Metcalf went undefeated with a career record of 228-0, won four consecutive Michigan state titles, and earned six junior national titles. After originally committing to Virginia Tech, Metcalf would ultimately transfer to the University of Iowa following his redshirt year, to follow coach Tom Brands, who was switching head coaching positions from Virginia Tech to the University of Iowa also. Tom Brands and Metcalf both switched to the same schools. Due to Virginia Tech's desire not to release him, Metcalf was forced to sit out the entire 2006-2007 season. In the fall of 2007, as sophomore, Metcalf finally began his wrestling career. During the course of his first competitive season, he captured the Big Ten and National Championships at 149 lbs.
Metcalf joined past Iowa State star Cael Sanderson as the only sophomore to win the Dan Hodge Trophy as the best collegiate wrestler in the United States. He was also named the Jesse Owens Big Ten Male Athlete of the Year, beating out athletes in more high profile sports like football and basketball. Metcalf was additionally named Outstanding Wrestler of the Big Ten and NCAA Tournaments, and honored as Big Ten Wrestler of the Year.
Personal.
Raised in Davison, Michigan, Brent Metcalf is the son of Tom and Lynn Metcalf. His mother was an all-state gymnast and state champion in track and field. Brent is currently a sociology major at the University of Iowa. He was high school teammates with 3x All American and 1x National Champion Paul Donahoe and 3x All American and 1x National Champion Jon Reader, all coached under Roy Hall.
His older brother, Chase Metcalf, was also a very successful wrestler, but lost his life in a car accident in his University years. Roy Hall's son Chase Langdon Hall was named after Brent Metcalf's brother Chase Metcalf.
Brent married Iowa City native Kristin Metcalf (née Knipper).
High school.
Metcalf finished his prep career with a 228-0 career record, tallying 156 pins. A four-time state individual champion, Metcalf also led his team to four consecutive state titles. As a senior, he was named Michigan's "Mr. Wrestler" in 2005, was selected as second-team ASICS all-American (behind rival Dustin Schlatter), Wrestling USA all-American and a Wrestling USA scholastic all-American.
A two-time FILA Junior World national champion, Metcalf captured the Most Outstanding Wrestler award in 2004 and was named the Outstanding Wrestler at 2005 Junior Freestyle Nationals. He defeated Pennsylvania wrestler Matt Dragon in the finals. He also wrestled Dragon in the Dapper Dan beating him in a 8-7 win. A six-time Junior National champion, he was also three-time Junior National Greco-Roman and Freestyle champion en route to earning double Most Outstanding Wrestler awards in 2005. He completed his senior season as a 2005 Dave Schultz High School Excellence regional award winner. Metcalf was also a cadet greco-roman national champion and freestyle runner-up.
College.
2005 - 2006.
After committing to coach Tom Brands at Virginia Tech, Metcalf used the 2005-2006 season as his redshirt year.
2006 - 2007.
On April 9, 2006, past NCAA Champion and former Iowa Hawkeye Tom Brands was named the head coach of the Iowa Wrestling program. Shortly after Brands accepted Iowa's offer, the five Virginia Tech wrestlers requested to transfer to Iowa pursuant to the NCAA’s "one-time transfer exception." Virginia Tech chose not to grant their release, and despite their issuing a lawsuit against Virginia Tech, the wrestlers were unable to successfully transfer without losing one year of eligibility.
During this season of lost eligibility, Metcalf competed in both folkstyle and freestyle competitions. He competed unattached in three open college tournaments, winning all three en route to compiling a 14-0 record at 149 pounds. He won Omaha's Kaufman-Brand Open, an event that included a number of top Division I teams.
2007 - 2008.
Metcalf entered the 2008 NCAA Wrestling Championships as the number one seeded wrestler in the 149 pound weight class. He had only one loss on the year getting pinned in a spladle in the first period by NC State wrestler Darrion Caldwell during the dual meet. He opened his tournament in dominant style with a first period fall on Will Rowe of Oklahoma, his only pin of the tournament, and he won the 2008 NCAA wrestling championships by defeating Bubba Jenkins, future 2011 NCAA Champion from Penn State 14-8. He gave up the first two takedowns in the first period before coming back for the victory. He had defeated Jordan Burroughs, future World Champion and Olympic gold medalist of Nebraska in the semi-finals 6-3. He also defeated returning All American Lance Palmer of Ohio State in the quarterfinals. For his efforts he was named the tournament's most outstanding wrestler. For his achievements Metcalf was named the winner of the 2008 Dan Hodge Trophy, awarded annually to the nation's best college wrestler.
2008 - 2009.
Metcalf entered the 2009 NCAA Wrestling Championships with an unblemished 37-0 record and again garnered the number one seed for the 149 pound weight class. He lost in the finals to Darrion Caldwell of NC State 11-6. Before time expired in the match, Caldwell went to do a celebratory backflip and Metcalf continued to wrestle until time expired. Both parties issued apologies after the incident.
2009 - 2010.
Metcalf went undefeated during the regular season at 149 lb. Brent then lost to Lance Palmer from Ohio State in the Big 10 Championships when Metcalf, down by one considering riding time, failed to finish a deep single and was instead put to his back late in the third after a wild scramble. Palmer, a fellow 4x HS State Champion, had met and lost to Metcalf in 4 prior matches. Metcalf would later avenge the loss by defeating Palmer 3-2 in the NCAA Finals to capture his second NCAA National Championship. Metcalf finished his collegiate career with a record of 108-3 (.973).

106th Cavalry Regiment

The 106th Cavalry Group (later reorganized as a regiment) was a mechanized cavalry unit of the United States Army in World War II. The 106th Cavalry Group had previously been known as the 1st Regiment Illinois Volunteer Cavalry during the Spanish American War and World War I and was constituted in 1921 as part of the Illinois National Guard. It underwent a number of reorganizations before World War II. Like other guard units during the inter-war years, the 106th held monthly drills and yearly training. Readiness for war in 1940 led to the mechanization of the unit and induction into Federal Service at Camp Livingston, Louisiana on 25 November 1940.
After the Pearl Harbor attack, the 106th trained at Camp Hood, Texas until the spring of 1944 when they deployed to Europe. Upon arriving in England, the group was reorganized into the 106th and 121st Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadrons along with a Group Headquarters. After arriving in Europe, they were often in the lead of other units. Lightly armed, they scouted ahead to fix enemy locations. For the next year and a half, they fought through France, Luxembourg, Germany and Austria, earning five campaign streamers and the Croix de guerre from Charles de Gaulle, President of the Provisional French government. The Regiment lead the Allied advance across the Rhine, and were the first unit to attack a town south of the Siegfried Line or West Wall.
In late 2006, the 33rd Brigade Combat Team of the Illinois Army National Guard was formed and the 106th Cavalry Squadron was included in the reorganization.

Background
The coat of arms was originally approved for the 106th Cavalry Regiment, Illinois and Michigan National Guard on 17 December 1930. The description wording was modified on 30 December 1932 to show the unit's correct period of service on the Mexican Border. The unit was redesignated as the 106th Heavy Tank Battalion, Illinois and Michigan National Guard on 3 October 1949. The shield was amended to delete the crest for organizations of the Michigan National Guard on 6 October 1949. Four years later, on 19 October 1953 the unit was redesignated as the 106th Tank Battalion, Illinois National Guard. The insignia was redesignated for the 106th Armor Regiment, Illinois National Guard on 13 December 1960. It was redesignated once again as the 106th Cavalry Regiment, Illinois Army National Guard on 7 January 1965. It was amended to change the symbolism of the shield of the coat of arms on 7 October 1969.

The 106th Cavalry was before World War II a National Guard unit based in Chicago, Illinois. Prior to World War I and the Spanish-American War it had been known as the 1st Illinois Volunteer Cavalry. The 106th underwent a number of different reorganizations until 1 September 1940, when it was redesignated the 1st Squadron, 106th Cavalry (Horse-Mechanized). The 106th was inducted into federal service on 25 November 1940 in Chicago. The Regiment moved to Camp Livingston, Louisiana on 3 January 1941 under command of V Corps.
The Black Horse Troop.
From 1929–1940, Troop E of the Regiment was known as "The Black Horse Troop" and participated in parades and ceremonies as a horse mounted unit. Businessman Samuel Insull raised funds to outfit the Troop and their Mounted Band. The Troop wore a dress uniform of blue shell jackets.
World War II.
Along with other National Guard units, the regiment was federalized in 1940.
At the beginning of World War II, most of the members of the regiment were given the opportunity to enroll in officers school. A core group of about 60 men chose to stay with the unit. The Regiment was assigned to the Third Army on 12 January 1942, and to IV Corps on 1 May 1942. In spring 1942 the Regiment became fully mechanized. The regiment participated in several maneuvers at Hineston, Kinisatchie, and Dry Creek, Louisiana; and in the Louisiana Maneuver Area through the beginning of November 1942.
They were assigned to XV Corps on 1 March 1943 and transferred to Burkeville, Texas, on 25 June 1943, after which it was sent to Camp Hood, Texas on 25 August 1943 under the Tank Destroyer Command. The Regiment staged at Camp Shanks, New York from 20 February 1944 until 27 February when it departed the New York Port of Embarkation for England.
Campaign summary.
The 106th served in the European campaign. The unit comprised approximately fifteen hundred men and was given various typical mechanized cavalry missions later recognized by the French nation with award of two Croix de guerre. The unit finished its wartime duty with the 7th Army, XV Corps.
As a forward cavalry force, the 106th provided the first American troops to enter Salzburg, Austria. The 121st Squadron of the 106th received information that the Germans were holding the King of the Belgians and his family prisoner in a chateau near Strobl, Austria. Captain Benning, the commander of B Troop of the 121st Squadron, led some cavalrymen of his unit, including those who spoke German, on a rescue party. The group later served as Honor Guards for the King of the Belgians and his consort. The 106th secured a truce from the defending German Army on 7 May, the day before the German High Command surrendered to the Allies on 8 May 1945.
Organization and tactics.
The 106th Cavalry Group's purpose was to act as the "eyes and ears" of a field army or army group, scouting ahead of slower and heavier-equipped armored and infantry formations to locate the enemy and shield friendly units from ground detection. Whenever enemy forces were found, the cavalry was designed to determine opposing size and positions using reconnaissance-by-fire tactics, and report this information to higher command. The group was too lightly armed to engage in sustained combat, and regular infantry or armor was utilized if the opposition proved beyond cavalry-group capabilities. Another routine aspect of its reconnaissance duties involved employment of the cavalry group to fill measurable gaps separating frontline Allied units. The cavalry group was also assigned missions requiring rapid movement to bypass enemy forces, if opportune weaknesses or uncovered terrain was discovered by mechanized reconnaissance methods.
Equipment and armament.
The 106th Cavalry was lightly equipped to allow it to move quickly and deploy rapidly. They fought mounted in mobile Bantam Jeeps and M8 armored cars. Each squadron's complement of troops and vehicles consisted of a headquarters troop that included communication, administrative, mess, maintenance, transportation, and supply support, a medical detachment, a cavalry assault gun troop, and three reconnaissance troops, lettered A, B, and C. A squadron of about 760 men was about the equivalent of a typical Army battalion in numbers, though Cavalry units were typically smaller.
The three reconnaissance troops were each equipped with Bantam jeeps with a bracket-mounted .30 caliber machine gun, manned by a soldier sitting in the front passenger seat. A second Bantam jeep was mounted with a 60mm mortar manned by two soldiers. Sometimes the Bantam was mounted with a .50 caliber machine gun. Each troop was usually equipped with a mixture of the three vehicles. To maximize speed and maneuverability on the battlefield, the Bantams were not given extra armor protection. The only modifications the 106th made was to add a wire cutter. They mounted a steel pole on the front bumper that extended above the driver's head because the Germans would sometimes stretch piano wire over roads with the intention of injuring or decapitating the driver.
The third vehicle used was the six-wheeled, light-weight M8 Greyhound armored car, mounted with a 37 mm gun in a movable turret that could swing a full 360 degrees. It also featured a .30 caliber coaxial machine gun that could move independently of the turret. The M8 was equipped with powerful FM radios to enable battlefield communications.
E Troop, the Squadron's mobile artillery, was the Cavalry Assault Gun Troop and consisted of three assault gun platoons. Each platoon was equipped with assault guns, short-barreled howitzers in an open turret on an M8 chassis. They also utilized two halftracks to carry their headquarters unit and an ammunition section. Two gun sections used an M8 Greyhound.
F Troop consisted of five light tank companies. Early in the war, each company had three light tank platoons, consisting of five 37mm M5A1 Stuart light tanks. While fast and maneuverable, the Stuart's armor plating and its cannon were soon found to be no match against the German tanks. In February 1945, they were replaced with the more heavily armed 75 mm M24 Chaffee light tank.
The M5 Stuart light tank was capable of speeds up to on the road, while the M24 Chaffee could travel at speeds up to on paved surfaces. The M8 armored car was capable of speeds of up to , while the Bantams could exceed . The officers usually rode with their enlisted men in the Bantams, while the squadron's support troops used a variety of vehicles including the Bantams, military trucks, and armored halftracks. At times, the men would dismount from their light vehicles and take on infantry roles, digging in to create a stronger defensive line.
Patrols were undertaken both on foot or mounted as the circumstances dictated. In this capacity, the cavalrymen would go into combat with M1 rifles and carbines, hand grenades, Thompson machine guns, and newly developed bazookas. When facing heavily fortified enemy positions or, later in the war, against the heaviest German tanks, the 106th was accompanied with supporting units, usually in the form of a small number of tank destroyers. However, the mission of reconnaissance units was not to kill all of the enemies encountered, but to summon the slower moving and better equipped infantry and armored units whose job it was to fix and destroy the heavily armored enemy.
The headquarters, maintenance, mess, supply and medical units were equipped with a variety of military trucks, M8 Armored cars, halftracks, and Bantam jeeps.
Arrival in England.
The regiment arrived at Glasgow, Scotland on 9 March 1944, was moved to Doddington Hall camp in England, and six days later was reorganized as the HHT 106th Cavalry Group (Mechanized), comprising the 106th and 121st Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadrons along with a Group Headquarters. Half of its officers and non-commissioned soldiers formed the basis of the newly created 121st Cavalry Squadron. The 33rd Aviation Battalion of the Illinois National Guard was reorganized as Troop A. After three months of training, the 106th sailed for France on 29 June 1944. While crossing the English Channel to Europe, the Squadron was transported on two Liberty ships. The Liberty ship carrying A Troop of the 121st Squadron hit a mine shortly after leaving England. Fortunately, a Red Cross LST came quickly alongside and all the men were safely evacuated back to England for another 19 days before new transportation to France could be found.
European operations.
The cavalry group served in the European campaign and at various stages screened the advance of the US Third Army, US Seventh Army and US Sixth Army Group. The 106th as a scouting force provided the first American troops to enter Salzburg, Austria and accepted its surrender.
Normandy.
The 106th Cavalry Group arrived in France under the command of Colonel Vennard Wilson, a Regular Army officer. They were first committed to combat on 2 July 1944 with the VIII Corps. Its first mission was to assist in the reduction of German forces previously isolated during the VIII Corps advance in the Normandy Peninsula. The next mission was an offensive screening mission, which led from Normandy south through St. James, Isigny, La Haye-du-Puits, Manche, Basse-Normandie, Coutance, and Avaranches, to Rennes. With the quick advance, gaps appeared between VIII and XV Corps, and General George S. Patton plugged the gap between Louvigne and Rennes with the 106th Cavalry Group.
When VIII Corps turned west to mop up and secure the Brittany Peninsula, the 106th Regiment was reassigned once again to XV Corps. As the XV Corps raced east towards Le Mans, the 106th provided reconnaissance and a screening force. Members of the 106th were among the first to enter Le Mans on 8 August. The German front in the Battle of Normandy had collapsed, and the XV Corps turned north to help close the Falaise Pocket and the 106th provided flank screening security.
Northern France.
The XV Corps then turned north towards the Seine and Paris. With the pocket closed, the 106th reconnoitered east through Alençon, Sarthe, Nogent, and Mantes-Gassicourt. On 15 August they covered the to Dreux, just west of Paris, in a single day. They remained there covering the XV Corps' flank until 27 August. This mission helped protect XV Corps against German remnants attempting to escape the Falaise Pocket. The advance east from Auxerre to Gondrecourt was very fast against diminishing German resistance. Their screening mission took them along a front from the left to the right flank of the Third Army.
The group was then transferred under the command of and assigned to protect the right flank of XII Corps for twelve days carrying out reconnaissance as that corps advanced east. In mid-September it was reassigned to XV Corps at Joinville. This marked a two-month and trek across France as they moved in to protect the right flank of U.S. Third Army during their rapid advance from Joinville au Marne to Charmes au Moselle. During this advance, the 106th along with the 2nd French Armored Division assisted in eradicating the effective combat power of the German 16th Infantry Division.
The 106th's commanding officer, Colonel Vennard Wilson, later described the unit's action:
Eastern France.
In late September, the U.S. Army transferred the XV Corps from General Patton's Third Army, 12th Army Group to Seventh Army, 6th Army Group. Reassigned with the XV Corps, the 106th—without moving positions—switched from guarding the Third Army's right flank to guarding the Seventh Army's left flank and maintaining contact between the Third and Seventh Armies.
The 106th was then tasked with reconnaissance in front of the XV Corps. They led the XV Corps from the Moselle River to Lunéville, and supported by the 813th Tank Destroyer Battalion, attacked northeast into the wooded Forêt de Parroy, northeast of Lunéville, France. For two months they fought as infantrymen, dismounted alongside the 79th and 44th Infantry Divisions, enduring winter weather and minefields. Major General Wade H. Haislip characterized Forêt de Parroy as being "in reality a jungle."
During what was said to be the worst winter in 30 years, the 1500 men of the 106th held up to of the front. Staying in contact with the XII Corps right flank to its north was difficult because its lines were so thinly spread. Maintaining relatively static lines from 20 September through 5 November, they took the opportunity to rotate the two squadrons in and out of the line as trench foot took its toll on the soldiers. On several occasions the 106th was ordered to counter German probing attacks. The 121st Cavalry Squadron was later awarded the Croix de guerre with Palm for its combat participation during this extended period.
When the XV Corps' infantry attacked the German defensive line, the 106th, once again supported by the 813th Tank Destroyer Battalion, preceded the 2nd French Armored Division in maneuvering through the Vosges Mountains to within of the Rhine River. The 106th screened the north advance, leading the attack on Sarrebourg and then advancing to the east to seize the Saverne Gap. Once through the Gap, the 106th guarded the northwest flank near Sarrebourg as the rest of the Corps advanced east another to capture Strasbourg.
On the American's Thanksgiving Day, 23 November 1944, one of the most élite units in the entire German army, the well-rested and refitted Panzer-Lehr-Division counterattacked, trying to recapture the Saverne Gap and cut off the XV Corps from its supply lines. The 106th was forced back (militarily credited with the usual propaganda of "completing a brilliant delaying action") but the retreat gave XV Corps Commander Major General Wade H. Haislip enough time to reinforce and the counter German advance.
Two weeks later, on 16 December 1944, the Germans launched the Ardennes Offensive (Battle of the Bulge). The 106th was placed in a dismounted (infantry) patrol mode north of Sarrebourg to scout German forces.
On 23 December the Group relieved the 6th Cavalry Group of Third Army in its zone to the north. The 106th Squadron relieved the 28th Squadron near St. Avold and the 121st Squadron relieved the 6th Squadron near Freyming-Merlebach. The 106th Cavalry Group maintained position on the shoulder of the bulge, helping maintain contact with Third Army and check the German attack.
Ardennes offensive.
As the Ardennes Offensive faltered, the Germans launched Operation Nordwind just before midnight on New Year's Eve to try to relieve pressure on its troops in the Ardennes. They once again sought to recapture the Saverne Gap and join up with the German 19th Army, enveloping seven American divisions along the Rhine River. The Germans attacked the right center of the Regiment and the group temporarily withdrew. The bitterly cold winter weather made fighting more difficult, but the 106th finally forced the Germans to retreat.
When the Ardennes Offensive was stopped, the Seventh Army and the French First Army resumed the offensive on 29 January 1945. The 106th continued to patrol until 11 February 1945, when it was relieved by the 101st Cavalry Group. The regiment moved outside of Merlebach for rest, refitting, and equipment maintenance. They were outfitted with the new M-24 'Chaffee' light tank with its improved 75 mm gun mount, a huge improvement over the M5A1's 37 mm gun. Upon receiving the tanks in mid-February 1945, soldiers said, "The light tank companies of both squadrons turned in their 37mm gun-toting M5A1's and drew the new M24's Armed with a 75 mm cannon and twice the size of the precursors, these tanks seemed beautiful to us. Our tankers itched to try them out. On 15 March, they got their chance. We were back in the line."
Rhineland.
After just over a month's break, the 106th Cavalry Group returned to the front lines. From 15 to 26 March it led XV Corps' offensive through the Siegfried Line near Saarbrücken. Leading the advance across the Rhine were A and B Troops of the 121st Squadron, the first to attack a town south of the West Wall. Finally reaching the Rhine River, on 27 March 1945 the 106th crossed the river and cleared and secured Salzbach. The Group then covered the advance of XV Corps to Aschaffenburg am Main. The 106th secured the Corps' left flank and maintained contact with the 44th and 45th Infantry Divisions and the 2nd Cavalry Division.
From 1 to 5 April, the regiment assisted the 2nd Cavalry Group, advancing north to Bad Orb, Germany and secured an Allied Prisoner of War camp. The Regiment's 121st Squadron was then charged with reconnoitering the main road to Neustadt.
In the next eight days, the group moved northeast into Germany, rapidly cleared the towns of Alsberg, Siedensroth, Steinau, Schlüchtern and Flieden. From 5 to 13 April, the regiment cleared the enemy eastward to the Main River, a tributary of the Rhine River, covering the advance of the 45th Infantry Division into Lauda-Königshofen and then on 20 April the capture of Nuremberg.
On 21 April A Troop of the 106th Squadron was charged with leading the 2nd Battalion, 179th Infantry Regiment, 5th Infantry Division about south to the Danube River, and to secure and hold a crossing near Neuberg.
During the next two days, the 106th Cavalry Group fought its final major engagement. From Neuberg, the unit attacked southward towards Augsburg. Leading the 45th Infantry Division rapidly east down the autobahn towards Munich as it tried to locate the rapidly retreating Germans, Troop C along with two light tanks from Company F, drew a concentrated attack from German forces only from their objective. The German self-propelled guns, tanks, and small arms fire left four dead and destroyed four armored M8 vehicles and four Bantams.
On 29 April, during the assault towards Munich, the 3rd Battalion, 157th Infantry Regiment, 45th Division liberated the Dachau Concentration Camp. The 45th Infantry Division for which the 106th had reconnoitered for several months, battled diehard Nazi troops and took Munich on 30 April 1945. After helping to capture Munich, the 106th lead the XV Corps into Austria. On 2 May, they received orders to capture Salzburg. En route, they captured the remnants of the Hungarian 9th Infantry Brigade, about 8,800 men, who were retreating eastward, fighting the advancing Soviet Marshall Rodion Malinovsky's 2nd Ukrainian Front. Salzburg surrendered on 4 May, and the local German commander offered a truce.
Austria.
The group's final mission involved the release of the King of Belgium Held in internal exile by the Germans since his small nation had withstood a German attack for three weeks in May 1940, German-speaking members of a small recon party of the 106th learned while searching the towns of St. Wolfgang and Strobl that King Leopold was under guard in a villa in Strobl. Travelling in a six-wheeled Mercedes previously owned by Germany's Foreign Minister Von Ribbentrop, the troops located the villa. The S.S. Guards were still present, and the men of the 106th disarmed them without any resistance, freeing King Leopold.
Decorations.
Colonel Vennard Wilson was awarded the Legion of Merit, Legion of Honor, and Croix de guerre for his outstanding leadership of this unit. Lieutenant Benjamin S. Hill of the 121st Squadron was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross.
The 121st Cavalry Squadron was awarded the Fourragère. For its action at Lunéville, the 121st Cavalry Squadron was recognized with the Croix de guerre with Palm, and the Croix de guerre with Palm was awarded to entire 106th Cavalry Regiment for their gallantry and action at Caen-Falaise.
General Charles de Gaulle's citation praised the 106th Cavalry Group's action fighting alongside the 2nd French Division into the Vosges Mountains:
Address from Colonel Vennard Wilson, Troop Commander at End of War.

St. Wolfgang, Austria
Address to Members of 
106 Cavalry Group
Memorial Day, 30 May 1945
by Vennard Wilson 
Colonel, Cavalry Commanding 
"This is our National Memorial Day. It is fitting that we set aside a few moments to pay honor to our comrades who, by their supreme sacrifices, have made possible the triumph of our forces.
It is our custom on this day to pay honor to all the dead of all the wars of the American Armies. We salute them.
Yet this is also a special occasion for those of us who have just completed a long and arduous campaign, and who by the accidents of chance still live to tell the story of those who are no longer with us. We cannot but feel a special reverence for those comrades whom we knew intimately, whom we saw while their blood was still warm, men who did not let us down in a fight.
Let me briefly review our accomplishments. Our regiment, approximately fifteen hundred men, rather small as a major combat unit, has carried its full share of the action from Normandy to Austria. We landed in Normandy on 2 July 1944, learned combat in the famous hedgerow fighting there, learned to make swift advances in the initial breakthrough to Avranches. Then came our first open runs, from Avranches to the Seine. We were ready, and took up the gallop for fifty- and sixty-mile runs, leading the pack all the way. When the Third Army paused for supplies, we covered its right flank for a length of one hundred and fifteen miles.
The advance began again and we were told to lead the XV Corps from the vicinity of Neufchateau to Charmes. That, from a tactical standpoint, was one of the most interesting and successful of our accomplishments. An entire German division—the 16th Infantry Division—was in front of us. Our communications and technique were then developed to such a high standard that our infantry following us hardly lost an hour.
We used five of our six troops to contain those Germans, slipped around to their north, delivered our infantry on their objective at five in the afternoon after a fifty-mile advance. I wish to pay special tribute to B Troop 106th Squadron and their gallant troop commander, Captain Park, in this operation. This troop was one hundred miles in rear of us when the advance was ordered, came up during the night, arrived at the starting point after the other troops had departed, kept moving as rear troop during the day, and were sent into action late in the afternoon after I had committed the five other troops. Captain Park used on of his platoons on side blocking and reconnaissance missions, and when I arrived at Charmes we had only Captain Park, two platoons, and a platoon of tanks. It was enough to do the job.
Our next phas was the advance to Luneville. The Corps paused a few days at Charmes, on the Moselle. Our technique was so well developed that we were already in contact on the objective when the advance started.
Then came the foot-slogging days of the Forest of Parroy. We became infantry for a solid month, and slugged it out alongside the 79th Division. That was far from a pleasant campaign.
Then the days of the Vosges Mountains, the fight with the 130th Panzer (Lehr), the best fighting Germans we have ever fought against. The fight at Wimmenau, not one of our best. The winter campaign at Ludweiler, where we lost two hills but still retained the position. We were not at our top form then, far from it. But we rebuilt the outfit without withdrawing from combat, and the attack at Schaffhausen by A Troop 106th Squadron smacked them over like professionals.
Then the rest at Merlebach, the arrival of the new tanks, the finest present a man could have, and we were ready again. When the advance was begun to the Siegfried Line, I think that this outfit was absolutely at its top form. It was ferocious. I went in with A Troop 121st Squadron when it and B Troop 121st Squadron attacked the first town south of the Siegfried Line. Never could a man be prouder than to feel the weight of such an attack as you put on then. I know that nothing could possibly stop you.
Next, the advance to and across the Rhine, to the Main, to Nurnburg, to the Danube, to Munich, and finally to Austria. During this period, we worked with two of the finest fighting divisions of the American Army, the 3rd and 45th Infantry Divisions. They are both fast-moving and hard-hitting. We gained their respect and admiration.
One of the most interesting advances was the one on to Salzburg, and beyond. We were attached to the 3rd Division at the time. There was only one road available, and no room for us. The 3rd Division leading elements were delayed by a blown bridge some ten kilometers forward of Salzburg. The 121st Squadron was halted some forty kilometers west of Salzburg in read of a bad by-pass. During the night, the Division Commander gave me permission to use a northern road, and the Squadron took off at midnight. Led by B Troop 121st Squadron, with its troop commander, Captain Benecke, on the point bantam, it accepted the surrender of Salzburg early in the morning, beating the infantry by a very short time. When I informed the Division Commander of what you had done, his comment was "Fine, I didn't think you could do it!" He did not know you men as well as I did.
I have mentioned four troops merely because they happened to fit into the story. The others have also had their day. There was C Troop 106th Squadron in a brilliant final drive to Munich, there was C Troop 121st Squadron which played the major share in the Ludweiler Campaign, the assault gun troops who supported us constantly, and those tankers, God bless them, who made the most of our fights successful, those supply men who fed us, those mechanics who kept us rolling, those medics who saved many of us, make us feel that every man played his part.
I feel a pride in this regiment. It is always a proud feeling to belong to an outfit which can take its place with the best, which is definitely placed by its Corps Commander and by the infantry commanders with which it has worked, as a first-class fighting unit.
Those exploits of ours were not without cost. You cannot whip the enemy unless you take your share of the losses. They were accomplished through the willingness of our comrades to get out and feel his fire, to give back plenty of it, and to make the necessary sacrifice to dominate him. To our fifteen hundred men, there have been 1,195 Purple Hearts issued, and 194 of these will never again go into combat. They are our honored dead who lie buried on foreign soil; the men to whom we pay special tribute today.
We owe a certain debt to these dead. They have aided us in the defeat of a powerful, savage, warlike nation. We must so conduct ourselves in the future that their victory will be complete, that the peace for which they died will be permanent."
Kappelman photographic collection.
T/5 Glenn Kappelman was among replacements who joined the unit on 1 February 1944, and he was able to take about 750 pictures of the unit's action during the remainder of the war. Against orders, Kapplelman had secreted a Kodak 616 camera in his gas mask during embarkation inspection in New York. Because he was a common soldier and not a professional photographer, and since cameras and film were rare among troops in combat, the photographs depict a soldier's everyday experience and are relatively unique among war photography.
Traveling in an M8 armored car, he stashed film in empty ammunition boxes, shooting nearly 100 rolls of film. On one occasion during the winter of 1945 near Lunéville, his M8 was damaged and his squadron was forced to hastily retreat. Unable to carry his boxes of film, he hid them in a nearby home under a table covered by a long tablecloth. He returned two days later to find the ammunition boxes undisturbed.
Fifty years later, he began to produce large format prints of selected images and donated copies to the United States Cavalry Museum at Ft. Riley, Kansas, and other collections. He also gave a set to the King of Belgium who had been 15 years old when he was rescued by Kappelman's unit from German captivity in 1945. Kappelman and fellow 106th veteran Art Barkis narrated a largely self-financed video documentary titled "Through My Sights: A Gunner's View of WWII" of the photographic collection in 1999. In 2003 he followed that with a book of the same name featuring a large number of the photos interspersed with his personal recollections 50 years later, along with excerpts from his wartime letters and diaries.
Kappelman reprinted the unit's 1945 history, "The 106th Cavalry Group in Europe 1944-1945" in 1999. He added additional information to the captions of some photographs.
Occupation duty.
The 106th remained in Austria as an occupation force until October 1945. Part of their responsibility were acting as an Honor Guard for King Leopold. The King was at the time a controversial figure because of his stand during the war and refusal to flee and set up a government in exile, but surrendered to the Germans. The 106th were billeted in Pension Appesbach next door to the King's chateau. They assisted with Military Police duties but otherwise relaxed, playing sports, swimming, boating, and sightseeing. Ironically, one member of B Troop, T/5 Myron Ricketts, having survived the war, died in a drowning accident during occupation duties.
In a speech to the Cavalry Group on Memorial Day, 30 May 1945, commanding officer Colonel Vennard Wilson described the Group's and specifically Troop B's accomplishments:
Post World War II.
The 106th Cavalry Regiment departed Austria for the United States on 1 October 1945 via New York and was inactivated in Urbana, Illinois on 24 October 1945. In 1952 Companies A and C of the 106th Tank Battalion were headquartered at Camp Lincoln in Illinois.
Modern era.
Reorganized 1 February 1968 to consist of Troop E, an element of the 33d Infantry Brigade. Troop E 106 Cavalry was constituted as a scout element for the 33rd Separate Infantry Brigade, in Streator, IL, as a unit of the Illinois Army National Guard. Unit won several best unit citations during annual training with the 33rd SIB in the late 1980s. It served with distinction during a call up for Mississippi River floods in 1993. Deactivated in 1995 and reconstituted as an air defense artillery unit.
In late 2006, the 33rd Brigade Combat Team of the Illinois Army National Guard was formed. A, B, and C Troops of 106th Cavalry Squadron along with its Headquarters Troop were included in the reorganization, forming the 33rd's Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition squadron. Like their predecessors, they are responsible for reconnaissance, engaging the enemy with scout vehicles and anti-armor weapons, identifying and reporting enemy locations and activity, and providing enemy targeting information.
On 2 and 16 August 2008, about 100 Soldiers of the Headquarters and Headquarters Troop and Troop C, 2nd Squadron, 106th Cavalry were honored in a deployment ceremony prior to their deployment in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, to Afghanistan. As part of the 33rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, they acted as mentor teams. They trained both the Afghan Army and Afghan National Police, conducting patrol and security missions. This deployment was a part of Combined Joint Task Force Phoenix VIII.
Current units.
The Squadron currently consists of a Headquarters Troop and three cavalry troops:

FC Machida Zelvia

History.
Machida is known as "Brazil of Tokyo" due to the popularity of football in the city; it has, in fact, produced the second-largest number of J. League players though its football school. Originally formed in 1977 by Machida's football federation, this school is well known for its development of young talent into professional players. In 1989, in order to retain that talent in Machida, F.C. Machida established its own top team, which, at that time, played in the Tokyo Prefecture League. 
In 2003 they became a polideportivo under the name Athletic Club Machida., and in 2005 were promoted to the Kanto League, having won the Tokyo Prefectural League (First Division). They came first in the Kanto league (Second Division) the following year, and were promoted to First Division, where they stayed until promotion to Japan Football League as champions of the Regional Promotion Playoff Series in 2008.
In 2009, they adopted the current nickname "Zelvia," a portmanteau of the Portuguese words "zelkova" (Machida city's official tree) and "salvia" (a grassy plant commonly used in football pitches).
The same year, the club declared its intent to be promoted to J. League's 2nd division, and its status of semi-affiliatiate was officially approved by the J. League. However, its home stadium capacity and light specifications did not meet the J. League's requirements, average attendance did not reach 3,000, and the team's final result of 6th place did not allow for Zelvia's promotion to the J.League.
In 2010, Machida Zelvia appointed Naoki Soma, a former star player who played in the 1998 FIFA World Cup, as its new head coach. The stadium's lighting was renewed, and club added several J. League players to its roster. Zelvia also announced its partnership with Major League Soccer's DC United, which became the first historic partnership between a Japanese and American football club. The reborn team beat , its arch rival from the J. League, in the Emperor's Cup, but was knocked out by Albirex Niigata in the third round. Soma left at the end of the season and was replaced by Ranko Popović, former coach of Oita Trinita.
The stadium's capacity and conditions were still short of fulfilling J. League criteria, so the club completed another renovation between the end of the 2010 and start of the 2011 seasons. Machida Zelvia finished the 2011 season in third place after beating Kamatamare Sanuki in the final match of that season, thereby granting them promotion to J-League (Second Division).
Stadium.
Machida Zelvia currently plays at Machida Municipal Athletic Stadium (Nozuta Stadium). Capacity until 2011 was 6,200, including grassy areas, and has had lighting for night games since 2009. Between the 2010 and 2011 seasons the stadium was upgraded and is now all-seated. Although the minimum seating requirement for J2 is 10,000, Nozuta still falls short of that number. However, under an agreement made with J-League officials, home games where a large attendance is expected will be played at other stadia leased specifically for the purpose, and future upgrades to Nozuta will be made in order to meet the 10,000 capacity requirement.
Current roster.

Charles R. Scott

Charles Ray Scott (January 13, 1904–May 12, 1983) was an American lawyer and judge. 
Scott was born in Adel, Iowa. He received his LL.B. from Valparaiso University School of Law in 1934. In 1925, he was title clerk at the Chicago Title & Trust Company in Chicago. From 1926 to 1960, he was in private practice in Jacksonville, Florida. He served as a circuit judge of the 4th Judicial Circuit of Florida from 1960 to 1966. 
President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Scott to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida on October 11, 1966, to a new seat created by 80 Stat. 75. Confirmed by the Senate on October 20, 1966, he received commission on November 3, 1966. Andrew McClurg, a noted professor of torts, was a law clerk to Scott.
Scott incurred the ire of Florida Governor Claude R. Kirk, Jr. in 1970 for issuing busing orders for Volusia County schools; Kirk denounced Scott on television and called for his impeachment. In 1980, Scott approved the settlement of a civil rights suit filed by state prison inmates, setting a cap on the state prison population and sparking a prison reform effort for inmate health care.
Scott assumed senior status on November 12, 1976. He remained on the court until his death in 1983 at age 79. He died at Memorial Medical Center in Savannah, Georgia.

The Pasadena City Council is the governing body of the city of Pasadena, California. It meets regularly on Mondays at 8:00 PM, except on holidays or if decided by a special resolution not to meet.
The Council is composed of seven members elected from single-member districts for four-year terms. While the mayor is elected by voters at-large, the Vice Mayor is elected by the council to a term of one year (though it is customary for him or her to serve multiple terms).
Past City Governments.
Indiana Colony (1874-1886).
Between 1874 and 1886, the Indiana Colony, as Pasadena was then known, was privately owned and had no formal government, though most consider Daniel Berry to be the "de facto" leader.

The Buddha and His Dhamma

The Buddha and His Dhamma, a treatise on Lord Buddha's life and Buddhism, was the last work of Indian statesman and scholar B. R. Ambedkar. The book is treated as a holy text by Indian Buddhists. It was first published in 1957 after Ambedkar's death.
It was again Published in 1979 by the Education Department of the Government of Maharashtra as the eleventh volume of Ambedkar's collected writings and speeches, with a list of sources and an index.
Written in English, the book has been translated to many languages including Hindi, Gujarati,Telugu, Tamil, Marathi, Malayalam, and Kannada.
History.
While explaining purpose of writing the book Ambedkar writes:
The urge to write this book has a different origin. In 1951 the Editor of the Mahabodhi Society's Journal of Calcutta asked me to write an article for the Vaishak Number. In that article I argued that the Buddha's Religion was the only religion which a society awakened by science could accept, and without which it would perish. I also pointed out that for the modern world Buddhism was the only religion which it must have to save itself. That Buddhism makes slow advance is due to the fact that its literature is so vast that no one can read the whole of it. That it has no such thing as a bible, as the Christians have, is its greatest handicap. On the publication of this article, I received many calls, written and oral, to write such a book. It is in response to these calls that I have undertaken the task.
Contents.
Introduction.
The book is written as an answer to questions modern students of buddhism face. In introduction the author lists out the four questions:
The first problem relates to the main event in the life of the Buddha, namely, Parivraja. Why did the Buddha take Parivraja? The traditional answer is that he took Parivraja because he saw a dead person, a sick person and an old person. This answer is absurd on the face of it. The Buddha took Parivraja at the age of 29. If he took Parivraja as a result of these three sights, how is it he did not see these three sights earlier? These are common events occurring by hundreds, and the Buddha could not have failed to come across them earlier. It is impossible to accept the traditional explanation that this was the first time he saw them. The explanation is not plausible and does not appeal to reason. But if this is not the answer to the question, what is the real answer? 
The second problem is created by the four Aryan Truths. Do they form part of the original teachings of the Buddha? This formula cuts at the root of Buddhism. If life is sorrow, death is sorrow, and rebirth is sorrow, then there is an end of everything. Neither religion nor philosophy can help a man to achieve happiness in the world. If there is no escape from sorrow, then what can religion do, what can Buddha do, to relieve man from such sorrow which is ever there in birth itself? The four Aryan Truths are a great stumbling block in the way of non-Buddhists accepting the gospel of Buddhism. For the four Aryan Truths deny hope to man. The four Aryan Truths make the gospel of the Buddha a gospel of pessimism. Do they form part of the original gospel, or are they a later accretion by the monks? 
The third problem relates to the doctrines of soul, of karma and rebirth. The Buddha denied the existence of the soul. But he is also said to have affirmed the doctrine of karma and rebirth. At once a question arises. If there is no soul, how can there be karma? If there is no soul, how can there be rebirth? These are baffling questions. In what sense did the Buddha use the words karma and rebirth? Did he use them in a different sense than the sense in which they were used by the Brahmins of his day? If so, in what sense? Did he use them in the same sense in which the Brahmins used them? If so, is there not a terrible contradiction between the denial of the soul and the affirmation of karma and rebirth? This contradiction needs to be resolved. 
The fourth problem relates to the Bhikkhu. What was the object of the Buddha in creating the Bhikkhu? Was the object to create a perfect man? Or was his object to create a social servant devoting his life to service of the people and being their friend, guide and philosopher? This is a very real question. On it depends the future of Buddhism. If the Bhikkhu is only a perfect man he is of no use to the propagation of Buddhism, because though a perfect man he is a selfish man. If, on the other hand, he is a social servant, he may prove to be the hope of Buddhism. This question must be decided not so much in the interest of doctrinal consistency but in the interest of the future of Buddhism.

.450 Adams

The .450 Adams was a British black powder centrefire revolver cartridge, initially used in converted Beaumont-Adams Revolvers, in the late 1860s. Officially designated .450 Boxer Mk I, and also known variously as the .450 Revolver, .450 Colt, .450 Short, .450 Corto and .450 Mark III, and in America as the .45 Webley, it was the British Army's first centrefire revolver round.
History.
The .450 was adopted for the Adams revolver in November 1868, and served until it was replaced in service in 1880 by the .476 Enfield (in the Enfield Mark 1 and 2), which was in turn supplanted by the .455 Webley cartridge in 1887.
Originally loaded with of black powder over a bullet, it was later also offered in a smokeless powder loading. Despite the different designations, the .450 may be fired in any weapon chambered for .455 Webley, .455 Colt, or .476 Enfield.
While not considered a suitable military round, 450 Mark III cartridges did serve in reserve for the British armed forces as late as the First World War. 
The .450 Adams also proved popular among civilian users of Webley RIC and British Bulldog revolvers, being loaded in Europe, and persisting in the United States until around 1940. Both Colt's and Smith & Wesson offered revolvers in .450 Adams.
It was roughly similar in power to the contemporary .38 S&W, .41 Colt, or .44 S&W American. 
Handloaded ammunition can be made from shortened .455 Webley brass.

<doc id="20495880" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20495880" title="Coronary ischemia">
Coronary ischemia

Coronary ischemia is a medical term for not having enough blood through the coronary arteries. Coronary ischemia is linked to heart disease as well as heart attacks.It is also known as cardiac ischemia.
Causes.
Coronary artery disease (CAD) occurs when fatty substances get stuck to the walls of coronary arteries, which narrows the arteries and constricts blood flow. This causes a lack of oxygen and blood to the heart, which can result in a myocardial infarction (heart attack). CAD leads to constricted arteries, which leads to a lack of blood flowing through the arteries as well as oxygen, a process called atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is the most common cause of coronary ischemia.
CAD can be contracted over time. Certain factors play into this, for example, a family history of CAD. Other factors include smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes,obesity, inactive lifestyle and high cholesterol.
Symptoms.
The symptoms of coronary ischemia can last for a short period of time. The other symptoms that last for a longer period of time may suggest a myocardial infarction.
Symptoms of coronary ischemia can be classified as typical or atypical.
Typical Symptoms.
Chest pain is a major indication of coronary ischemia. If chest pain occurs while exercising, or during sex, but it doesn't persist after rest, it may be coronary ischemia. Some people characterize the pain they feel as though an elephant is sitting on their chest.
Other typical symptoms include diaphoresis which is sweaty palms, and clammy skin, nausea or vomiting, or shortness of breath.
Atypical Symptoms.
Most atypical symptoms are seen in woman, diabetics, and the elderly more than anyone else.
These type of symptoms include stomach pain, and simply fatigue. It can also include heartburn and anxiety.
If no symptoms are present it is called silent ischemia.
Diagnosis.
If there is a suspicion that one may have coronary ischemia, a doctor will administer a series of tests to confirm the diagnosis.. The most common tests today are an electrocardiogram, an exercise stress test, and a coronary angiography.
The doctor will also ask a series of questions to determine the medical history of the patient, including past incidences of chest pain or shortness of breath. He may also inquire about the duration of symptoms, how often they occur and any measures taken in attempts to relieve them.
Electrocardiogram.
When a doctor performs an electrocardiogram (ECG) s/he places small sensors on the arms, chest and legs.
These sensors detect any abnormal rhythms that the heart may be producing. This test is painless and it helps detect insufficient blood flow to the heart.
An ECG can also detect any damage that has been done in the past to the heart. This test can also detect any thickening in the walls of the left ventricles as well as any defects in the electrical impulses of the heart.
It is quick and provides the Physician with the P/PR, Hear Rate, QRS, QT/QTcF, P/QRS/T, and axis results.
Exercise stress test.
A stress test, is just that, a test to put stress on the heart through exercise. A doctor will put a patient through a series of exercises to measure the tolerance for stress on the heart. This test uses an ECG to detect the electrical impulses of the heart during physical exertion.
During this test a patient is put on a treadmill or a stationary bike. The incline or resistance of the bike are steadily increased until the patient reaches the target heart rate for the patients age and weight.
An exercise stress test is not always accurate in determining if one has a blockage in the arteries. Those who are young and are women may show abnormalities on their test even though no signs of coronary ischemia or CAD are present.
Coronary angiography.
A coronary angiography is performed only after a stress test or ECG shows a sign of coronary ischemia or CAD. This test is very important in finding where the blockages are in the arteries.
This test helps determine if an angioplasty or bypass surgery is needed.
During this test the doctor makes a small incision in the patient's groin (femoral) or wrist (radial) and inserts a catheter. The catheter has a very small video camera on the end of it so that the doctor can find the arteries.
Once he has found the arteries, he injects a dye in them so that he/she can detect any blockages in the arteries. The dye is able to be seen on a special x-ray machine.
The test takes one to two hours.
Side Effects.
Coronary ischemia has some serious side effects if it is not treated. It can cause the increased risk of high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. If not treated, these can both lead to a heart attack.
When the coronary arteries become constricted, it can lead to a heart attack. One can suffer temporary chest pain or angina. A heart attack can cause arrythmias, as well as permanent damage to the heart muscle.
If left untreated, coronary ischemia can also lead to a stroke.
Treatment and prevention.
Coronary ischemia can be treated but not cured.
By changing lifestyle, further blockages can be prevented. A change in lifestyle mixed with prescribed medication, can greatly improve health.
Smoking.
A study showed that those who quit smoking reduced their risk of being hospitalized over the next two years.
Smoking increases blood pressure, as well as increases the risk of high cholesterol. Quitting can lower blood pressure, and triglyceride levels.
Secondhand smoke is also bad for the heart health.
Healthy diet.
Diet is a very important factor in getting coronary ischemia or coronary artery disease and preventing it.
A heart healthy diet is low in saturated fat and cholesterol and high in complex carbohydrates.
Complex carbohydrates include fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. These food choices can reduce the risk of a heart attack or any other congestive heart failure event.
A heart healthy diet also includes low sodium intake and a higher potassium intake. A low potassium intake raises blood pressure, as does a diet high in sodium.
Physical activity.
By increasing physical activity it's possible to manage body weight, reduce blood pressure, and relieve stress. 
The Center for Disease Control recommends 30 minutes of physical activity a day.
Instead of 30 minutes a day at one time, short bursts of physical activity for 8–10 minutes three times a day are also suitable. Exercising this way can reduce the risk of getting heart disease or coronary ischemia, if it is performed at moderate intensity.

Durham Performing Arts Center

The Durham Performing Arts Center opened November 30, 2008 as the largest performing arts center in the Carolinas at a cost of $48 million. DPAC hosts over 200 performances a year including touring Broadway productions, high-profile concert and comedy events, family shows and the American Dance Festival. Operated under the direction of Nederlander and Professional Facilities Managaement (PFM), DPAC has twice been listed as the #1 performing arts organization in the Triangle region by the Triangle Business Journal. 
Listed three times in the top 50 in Pollstar magazine's worldwide theater attendance ranking, in 2011 DPAC was the #1 U.S. Theater in the listing with a capacity under 4,000 and #4 ranked Theater among all U.S. Theaters.
Costs and history.
The theater was developed by the American Center for the Performing Arts Associates, a joint venture between Philip Szostak Associates and Garfield Traub Development of Dallas, Texas. The architect was Szostak Design Inc. of Chapel Hill, NC.
The theater holds 2,712. The first event on opening night was a concert given by B.B. King. The theater is owned by the city of Durham. After talks with ClearChannel fell through, the City negotiated a theater operating agreement with Nederlander Organization and Professional Facilities Management. The operator guarantees a minimum of 100 event performances per year on a rolling three-year average and absorbs any losses for the first five years of operation, at which time the operator could return the management back to the City or negotiate the terms of continued third party management of the theater with the City. 
The City borrowed $33.7 million for the center's construction through Certificates of Participation ("COPs"), instruments commonly used to finance municipal facilities. Debt service payments on COPs are subject annual appropriation the City, and as such are considered an annual operating expense rather than a long-term capital obligation. Accordingly, a voter referendum was not required for the issuance of the COPs. Additional sources of funds for the project include facility naming rights, a Duke University contribution, an operator loan, and several other sources. The Duke University contribution equaled $7.5 million. The theater hosts, on favorable rental terms, the seven-week American Dance Festival summer series, which had previously been presented in the 1,232-seat Page Auditorium at Duke University The cost to the city for the $33.7 million in bonds will be almost $70 million over 28 years.
Naming rights were budgeted to bring in $800,000 annually, but in 2007 when the project was $400,000 under that estimate, the city agreed to draw up to $200,000 a year from its general fund to partially make up the difference. The Durham city council agreed to an additional $200,000 request in April 2009 for video and trash facility installation. While the City has had some success with naming rights, securing major naming rights sponsorships has been challenging due to current economic conditions. 
However, the theater has far exceeded projections for attendance, activity, gross revenue, net income after operating expenses. Both the City's 40% share of theater net income and income to the City from ticket facility fee surcharges have far exceeded projections. At more than $1.2 million, the City's 40% share of theater net income in fiscal year 2009-2010 was over five times more than originally projected. 
Further, the theater has had far greater fiscal and economic impacts than the $7 million to $11 million original annual projections of the City's independent consultant and the Durham Convention and Visitor's Bureau ("DCVB"). The DCVB estimates that the theater had a $10.9 million economic impact to the City in just the first seven months of operation. In the 2009-2010 fiscal year, the City of Durham reported that the theater had a citywide economic impact of over $24 million.
The Durham Performing Arts Center has been credited with benefiting the restaurant business in downtown Durham, in spite of the 2008 - 2010 recession. Five downtown restaurants opened in downtown Durham in proximity to the theater since its opening, significantly supported by pre- and post-show seatings generated by the theater. The theater was cited in a CNN Money and Fortune Magazine article ranking the City of Durham as number one in its list of "25 Best Places to Retire." 
In spite of the sharpest decline in the travel and leisure sector in a generation due to the recent recession, the State of North Carolina ranked as the third highest state in hospitality job growth according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The Durham Performing Arts Center was cited as contributing "to the growth of leisure and hospitality jobs in North Carolina over the past five years" by the Triangle Business Journal.
In 2004, the chairman of the board of what was to be DPAC's primary local booking, the American Dance Festival, said that the goals of DPAC and the goals of the festival were at odds. Although the supporters of DPAC's construction mentioned the dance festival as a primary reason for building the theatre, the festival's request for a small black box theatre was not granted. However, in 2009, the festival said that the larger theatre had solved many complaints about the festival's previous space at Duke University.
Controversies.
Concerns have consistently been raised by Triangle arts supporters that the Durham theatre could hurt the nearby Carolina Theatre (also owned by the city of Durham) or the Progress Energy Center for the Performing Arts in Raleigh.
However, contrary to these concerns, the DPAC has actually benefited the Carolina Theatre through co-promotion opportunities and other policies and activities. On July 16, 2012, less than three years after the grand opening of DPAC, it was announced that the Carolina Theatre was ranked among the top 100 theaters in the world in attendance for the first time in its history. 
Former Durham City Council member Thomas Stith objected when city employee Mark Greenspan lobbied the city council on behalf of the theatre's eventual contractor, Skanska, and then went to work for Skanska four months after the contract was awarded. Stith called for a "cooling-off period" for city employees, similar to those enacted by state and federal governments. The Durham City Council rejected the measure in April 2007.
Performances.
The theater will host primarily national touring acts. Local bookings have included a Triangle production of "A Christmas Carol" and the biggest-name acts of the 2009 edition of the American Dance Festival. Its first performance, which was sold out, was B.B. King.

Paul Müller-Kaempff

Paul Müller-Kaempff (16 October 1861, Oldenburg – 5 December 1941, Berlin), was a German painter, illustrator and lithographer. He is associated with the Düsseldorf school of painting.
He received his first training from 1883-86 at the Düsseldorf Academy of Fine Arts, then at the Academy of Karlsruhe under Gustav Schönleber (1851–1917) and finally at the Berlin Academy in the studio of Hans Gude (1825–1903). Another of Gude's student during this period was Georg Müller vom Siel (1865–1939).
In 1905 he married his student, Else Schwager, and was appointed professor a year later. From 1908 he lived in Hamburg, later becoming a member of the Hamburg Artists Association. In 1904 he and his wife were founder members of the Oldenburg Art Society.
Müller-Kaempff was a successful landscape artist. He produced watercolours, pastels and drawings as well as furniture designs and a multitude of postcards. He was also an accomplished lithographer and produced bird illustrations for the revised edition of Naumann's ""Naturgeschichte der Vögel Mitteleuropas"". During his lifetime his works are acquired by museums in Rostock, Oldenburg, Kiel and Hamburg, and bought by numerous private collectors as far afield as Argentina and China. Prince Eitel Friedrich, the second son of Emperor Wilhelm II, acquired several of Müller-Kaempff's pieces for the imperial court in 1908. Müller-Kaempff stayed in touch with his fomer fellow-student, Georg Müller vom Siel, and visited him at Dötlingen in June 1908. 
On a hike in 1889 with his friend, Oskar Frenzel (1855–1915), they discovered the secluded fishing village of Ahrenshoop. Müller-Kaempff was so inspired by the isolated hamlet that he moved there, built himself a house in 1892, and started the painting school of St. Lucas in 1894. Fellow artists followed his lead, and soon the artists' colony was home to Anna Gerresheim (1852–1921), :de:Elisabeth von Eicken (1862–1940), :de:Friedrich Wachenhusen (1859–1925), :de:Fritz Grebe (1850–1924), :de:Heinrich Schlotermann, :de:Theobald Schorn and Hugo Richter-Lefensdorf (1854–1904).

World War II in popular culture

There is a wide range of ways in which people have represented World War II in popular culture. Many works were created during the years of conflict and many more have arisen from that period of world history.
Some well-known examples of books about the war, like Nobel laureate Kenzaburō Ōe's "Okinawa Notes," could only have been crafted in retrospect.
Games.
One relatively new development of the "World War II media franchise" is that of video games. They are an extremely lucrative aspect of the gaming industry, and many titles are usually released every year. Some established games series about World War II include "Battlefield 1942", "Medal of Honor", "Call of Duty", "Close Combat", "Day of Defeat", "", "Brothers in Arms", "Wolfenstein 3D", arguably the highest acclaimed Submarine simulator franchise so far - "Silent Hunter" ", the Commandos" series, as well as the grand strategy game "Hearts of Iron II". An RTS game was released based on America's western campaign called "Company of Heroes". In 2001, a massively multiplayer online game MMORG "World War II Online" was introduced, and has thousands of players refighting the 1940 Western Europe campaign. There are however also much older games about the war, the arcade game "1942" being one of many examples.
Traditional board wargaming has replicated World War II from the tactical to the grand strategic levels. "Axis & Allies" and other such games continue to be popular. Avalon Hill and other wargame companies produced such complex games as "Squad Leader" and "PanzerBlitz" in the 1970s. Other popular World War II games still in production include Australian Design Group's "World In Flames" and Decision Games reproductions of SPI World War II games.
World War II has also been replicated through miniatures tabletop wargaming. Games like "Flames of War", "Command Decision", "Spearhead", "BlitzkriegCommander" and others have become popular among historical miniature wargamers. A novelty is the upcoming of free internet based wargames in high quality such as "Final Round".
Art.
The years of warfare were the backdrop for art which is now preserved and displayed in such institutions as the Imperial War Museum in London and the National Maritime Museum at Greenwich.
Remembrance.
Iconic memorials created after the war are designed as symbols of remembrance and as carefully contrived works of art.
Literature.
The war also figures prominently in many thousands of novels and other works of literature, including many published in the 1990s and 2000s (decade).
Movies and television.
Social historians regard the works of popular culture from the World War II era as documents that mirror and define crucial issues and concerns during that time. Individual combatants and those on the home fronts during World War II experienced the war through newspaper reports, radio broadcasts, films, stage plays, books and popular music—all become noteworthy aspects of understanding the period and its impact on what happened afterward.
World War II has provided material for many films, television programmes and books, beginning during the war. The film aspect had reached its peak by the 1960s, with films such as "The Longest Day" (which had been adapted from a book), "The Great Escape", "Patton" and "Battle of Britain". In the UK the actor Sir John Mills became particularly associated with war dramas, such as "The Colditz Story" (1954), "Above Us the Waves" (1955) and "Ice Cold in Alex" (1958), and was seen as the personification of Britain at war, conveying heroism and humility.
Movies about World War II continued for the rest of the 20th century and into the 21st century, though less in number and included "Schindler's List (1993 film)" " The boy in the Striped Pajamas (2009 film)"The Thin Red Line" (1998), "Saving Private Ryan" (1998), "Flags of Our Fathers" (2006) and Red Tails (2012) about the African American Air Fighter pilots of the Tuskegee Airmen. Movies and television programs about the war continued to be made into the 21st century, including the television mini-series "Band of Brothers", "The Pacific" and "Dunkirk". The majority of World War II films are portrayed from the Allied perspective (increasingly being limited to that of the Americans). Some exceptions include "Das Boot", "Der Untergang", "Letters from Iwo Jima", "Stalingrad", "Joy Division", and "Cross of Iron". World War II used to provide most of the material for the USA TV channel, the History Channel. Mel Brooks used the theme in the fictitious musical "Springtime for Hitler" and in his 1968 film and 2001 musical, "The Producers".
A number of television comedy sitcoms are based on the war, e.g. "Hogan's Heroes" from America, which follows the actions of a group of Allied POWs involved in covert activities. Three British sitcoms from David Croft are "'Allo 'Allo!" which makes fun of the French Resistance forces; "Dad's Army" which satirizes the British Home Guard, an anti-invasion force of men who are old or in poor health so cannot join the forces; and "It Ain't Half Hot Mum" about a Forces Concert Party entertaining troops in India and Burma. In the sixth episode of Fawlty Towers, Basil Fawlty (played by John Cleese) bases his comical routine on the paramount need that he and his staff be polite and ""don't mention the War!"" to their German guests, a task in which he signally and repeatedly fails himself. In 2009, an anime adaptation of the webcomic was released and parodies the characters as countries and their transactions in the war through social adult issues.
Many non-war-related TV shows in the USA such as The Simpsons, South Park, Family Guy, The Looney Tunes Show and Seinfeld frequently make reference to World War II-related persons and subjects, such as Adolf Hitler, Franklin Roosevelt, battles during the war, The Holocaust and the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. During the war several Donald Duck shorts were also propaganda films.
Holocaust films.
Also some films and TV series in an attempt to show and educate the future generation about the horror of racism and discrimination when taken into a national frenzy by making films based on the Holocaust and other German war crimes atrocities committed by the Germans. Movies like Schindler's List, , Life Is Beautiful, The Devil's Arithmetic, The Pianist, The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas and many other films depict the hardship the Jews had endured in Auschwitz and other concentration camps.
Eastern Asia.
Due to the still sensitive subject between China, Japan and Korea, the War in the Pacific and the Second Sino-Japanese War is hardly made into any historical war films intended for entertainment use in these countries. However, reference about the ongoing war as a background setting is heavily used as a setpiece to drive the storyline on. For example, Hong Kong martial arts films have used the "cartoon villain" portrayal of Japanese soldiers or generals being defeated by the Chinese lead character in an attempt to stop the Japanese from using biological weapons or stealing Chinese treasures (films like Fist of Fury, Millionaire's Express and Fist of Legend). Some films that depict Japanese war crimes were also made, such as the controversial exploitation film Men Behind the Sun.
More serious documentary style films have also been made such as the German made documentary "Nanking". However the depiction of the Defense of Sihang Warehouse was made in 1938, one year after the actual Battle of Shanghai, probably one of the earliest Sino-Japanese war film intended for entertainment and moral boosting propaganda. Also recently, to celebrate the Chinese Red Army first victory (out of two major battles the Communists actually fought) over the Japanese, a heavy-handed propaganda film that depict the Battle of Pingxingguan was made in 2005 to commemorate the 60th anniversary. However it was heavily criticised by the government of Taiwan, accusing the PRC government for hiding the truth by discrediting the Nationalist Revolutionary Army who took the brunt of the battles as it was they who did most of the fighting against the invaders in more than twenty battles. Actually, the PRC has made several films focusing on battles fought by Nationalist soldiers, such as the Battle of Taierzhuang and Battle of Kunlun Pass.
South Korea, which still has strong anti-Japanese sentiments, recently made a TV series about the Japanese assassination of Empress Myeongseong and the unfair treatment of the Korean people, also several films based on Kim Du-han as a freedom fighter were made.
The Soviet Union and Russia.
The Soviet Union incurred the heaviest casualties in World War II, and its history gave rise to an impressive number of films, poetry and prose, both in Russian and in many other languages of the country. The cultural homage to the Soviet soldiers and victims of World War II has been brought for decades; films about the war are shot in modern-day Russia up to present day. 
A few pinnacles of the Soviet cinema dedicated to World War Two include:
The Cranes Are Flying by Mikhail Kalatozov, 
Ivan's Childhood by Andrei Tarkovsky,
The Alive and the Dead by Aleksandr Stolper,
A zori zdes tikhie by Stanislav Rostotsky. In 2001, French director Jean-Jacques Annaud produced "Enemy At The Gates", detailing the exploits of sniper Vasily Zaytsev during the Battle of Stalingrad.
Poetry: the Cranes by the renowned Dagestani poet Rasul Gamzatov,
Wait for me by Konstantin Simonov,
I am Goya by Andrei Voznesensky,
“It has snowed for three days” by Mustai Karim, a Bashkir poet.
Sensitive Issues.
In 1970, Ōe wrote in "Okinawa Notes" that members of the Japanese military had coerced masses of Okinawan civilians into committing suicide during the Allied invasion of the island in 1945. In 2005, two retired Japanese military officers sued Ōe for libel; and in 2008, the Osaka District Court dismissed the case because, as the judge explained, "The military was deeply involved in the mass suicides". Ōe commented succinctly by saying, "The judge accurately read my writing."
Pop culture reference.
The war has also influenced footballing (soccer) rivalries. Most notably, the subject of World War II is used as chants by fans of the English football team. One such chant is "2 World Wars and 1 World Cup, do dah, do dah."
Campaigns, battles and so on have been commemorated throughout the 20th century and into the 21st century, mostly by veterans of the war and people that lived through it. In 2004 the commemoration of the D-Day landings took place which included, for the first time, German veterans of the war. Later that year, the commemoration of the campaigns in Italy and the Netherlands also took place. The 60th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp was commemorated in January 2005, while many other campaigns were also commemorated, as well as the end of the war in Europe and the Far East.

National Unification Party (Costa Rica)

The National Unification Party ("Partido Unificación Nacional") was a political party in Costa Rica from 1966 to 1978. It was founded by Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia and Otilio Ulate Blanco, and espoused social welfare and a free market. 
The party, was formed in reaction to the post civil war success of the National Liberation Party. It was formed from the old National Republican Party, led by former president Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia and the National Union Party, headed by former president Otilio Ulate Blanco, joined by a few minor parties. Calderón Guardia quickly took control of the party. The party was highly personalist, and sometimes the party was referred to as the Calderónistas.
In the 1966 general elections, they won the presidency with José Joaquín Trejos Fernández, but were just shy of a majority in the Legislative Assembly winning 26 seats. In the 1970 elections they ran former president Mario Echandi Jiménez, but lost the presidency due to the return of the hero of the civil war, José Figueres Ferrer, nevertheless they managed to hold on to 22 seats in the Legislative Assembly. The death of Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia in 1970 weakened the party, even though his brother Francisco Calderón Guardia then took control. In the 1974 elections they ran Fernando Trejos Escalante for president, but he was easily defeated by Daniel Oduber Quirós, and altogether they won only 16 seats in the Legislative Assembly. Francisco Calderón Guardia died in 1977 which was the death knell for the party. Most of the original coalition left the party, including the Republicans and the National Union Party. The National Unification Party's last gasp was the 1978 elections where they ran Guillermo Villalobos Arce for president, but he lost and the party took no seats in the Legislative Assembly. The National Unification Party had already been replaced by the temporary Unity Coalition, which metamorphosed into the Social Christian Unity Party.

World War I in popular culture

Art.
The years of warfare were the backdrop for art which is now preserved and displayed in such institutions as the Imperial War Museum in London, the Canadian War Museum in Ottawa, and the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. Official war artists were commissioned by the British Ministry of Information and the authorities of other countries.
After 1914, avant-garde artists began to consider and investigate many things that had once seemed unimaginable. As Marc Chagall later remarked, "The war was another plastic work that totally absorbed us, which reformed our forms, destroyed the lines, and gave a new look to the universe." In this same period, academic and realist artists continued to produce new work. Traditional artists and their artwork developed side by side with the shock of the new as culture reinvented itself in relationships with new technologies.
Some artists responded positively to the changes wrought by war. C. R. W. Nevinson, associated with the Futurists, wrote that "This war will be a violent incentive to Futurism, for we believe there is no beauty except in strife, and no masterpiece without aggressiveness." His fellow artist Walter Sickert wrote that Nevinson's painting "La Mitrailleuse" (now in the Tate collection) 'will probably remain the most authoritative and concentrated utterance on the war in the history of painting.'
Pacifist artists also responded to the war in powerful ways: Mark Gertler's major painting, "Merry-Go-Round", was created in the midst of the war years and was described by D. H. Lawrence as "the best modern picture I have seen" and depicts the war as a futile and mechanistic nightmare.
The commissions related to the official war artists programmes insisted on the recording of scenes of war. This undermined confidence in progressive styles as commissioned artists conformed to official requirements. The inhumanity of destruction across Europe also led artists to question whether their own campaigns of destruction against tradition had not, in fact, also been inhuman. These tendencies encouraged many artists to "return to order" stylistically.
The Cubist vocabulary itself was adapted and modified by the Royal Navy during "the Great War." The Cubists aimed to revolutionize painting — and reinvented the art of camouflage on the way. 
British marine painter Norman Wilkinson invented the concept of "dazzle painting" -— a way of using stripes and disrupted lines to confuse the enemy about the speed and dimensions of a ship. Wilkinson, then a lieutenant commander on Royal Navy patrol duty, implemented the precursor of "dazzle" on SS "Industry"; and in August 1917, the HMS "Alsatian" became the first Navy ship to be painted with a dazzle pattern. Solomon J. Solomon advised the British Army on camouflage. In December 1916 he established a camouflage school in Hyde Park In 1920, he published a book on the subject, "Strategic Camouflage". Alan Beeton advanced the science of camouflage.
An early influence of the War on artists in the United Kingdom was the recruiting campaign of 1914-1915. Around a hundred posters were commissioned from artists by the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee of which two and a half million copies were distributed across the country. Private companies also sponsored recruitment posters: "Remember Belgium", by the Belgian-born Frank Brangwyn and "The Only Road for an Englishman" by Gerald Spencer Pryse were two notable examples produced on behalf of the London Electric Railways. Although Brangwyn produced over 80 poster designs during the War, he was not an official war artist. His grim poster of a Tommy bayoneting an enemy soldier (“Put Strength in the Final Blow: Buy War Bonds”) caused deep offence in both Britain and Germany. The Kaiser himself is said to have put a price on Brangwyn’s head after seeing the image.
Brangwyn states in 1917 that Will Dyson's cartoons were "an international asset to this present war." His exhibition of "War Satires" in 1915 was followed by him being appointed an Australian official war artist.
The Royal Academy Summer Exhibition of 1915 was noted for the paucity and general poor quality of paintings on war themes, but "The Fighting-Line from Ypres to the Sea" by W. L. Wyllie was noted for its bold experimentation in showing a bird's-eye view of war from an aeroplane. George Clausen's symbolist allegory "Renaissance" was the most memorable painting of that 1915 exhibition, contrasting ruins and oppression with dignity and optimism. When exhibited in the spring of 1916, Eric Kennington's portrayal of exhausted soldiers "The Kensingtons at Laventie, Winter 1914" caused a sensation. Painted in reverse on glass, the painting was widely praised for its technical virtuosity, iconic colour scheme, and its ‘stately presentation of human endurance, of the quiet heroism of the rank and file’. Kennington returned to the front in 1917 as an official war artist.
The general failure of academic painting, in the form of the Royal Academy, to respond adequately to the challenges of representing the War was made clear by reaction to the 1916 Summer Exhibition. Although popular taste acclaimed Richard Jack's sentimental "Return to the Front: Victoria Railway Station, 1916", the academicians and their followers were stuck in the imagery of past battle pictures of the Napoleonic and Crimean eras. Arrangements of soldiers, officers waving swords, and cavalrymen swaggering seemed outdated to those at home, and risible to those with experience of the front. A wounded New Zealander standing in front of a painting of a cavalry charge commented that "one man with a machine-gun would wipe all that lot out."
It was therefore not to a painter of the academic style but to an artist in black-and-white that recourse was made when Charles Masterman, head of the British War Propaganda Bureau and acting on the advice of William Rothenstein, appointed Muirhead Bone as Britain's first official war artist in May 1916. In April 1917 James McBey was appointed official artist for Egypt and Palestine, and William Orpen was similarly sent to France. Orpen's work was criticised for superficiality in the pursuit of perfectionism: "in the tremendous fun of painting he altogether forgot the ghastliness of war".
The most popular painting in the Royal Academy Exhibition of 1917 was Frank O. Salisbury's "Boy 1st Class John Travers Cornwell V.C." depicting a youthful act of heroism. But of more artistic importance in 1917 was the establishment on 5 March of the Imperial War Museum and the foundation during the summer of the Canadian War Memorials Fund by Lord Beaverbrook and Lord Rothermere and significant work by Australian war artists.
David Bomberg's experiences of mechanized slaughter and the death of his brother in the trenches - as well as those of his friend Isaac Rosenberg and his supporter T. E. Hulme - permanently destroyed his faith in the aesthetics of the machine age. This can be seen most clearly in his commission for the Canadian War Memorials Fund, "Sappers at Work" (1918–1919): his first version of the painting was dismissed as a "futurist abortion" and was replaced by a second far more representational version.
At the 1918 Royal Academy exhibition, Walter Bayes' monumental canvas "The Underworld" depicted figures sheltering in a Tube station during an air raid. Its sprawling alien figures predate Henry Moore's studies of sheltering figures in the Tube during the Blitz of World War II.
Painting.
Walter Richard Sickert's "The Integrity of Belgium", painted in October 1914, was, when exhibited in Burlington House in January 1915 at an exhibition in aid of the Red Cross, recognised as the first oil painting exhibited of a battle incident in the Great War.
John Singer Sargent.
Among the great artists who tried to capture an essential element of war in painting was Society portraitist John Singer Sargent. In his large painting "Gassed" and in many watercolors, Sargent depicted scenes from the Great War.
Wyndham Lewis.
British painter Wyndham Lewis was appointed as an official war artist for both the Canadian and British governments, beginning work in December 1917 after Lewis' participation in the Third Battle of Ypres. For the Canadians he painted "A Canadian Gun-Pit" (1918, National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa) from sketches made on Vimy Ridge. For the British he painted one of his best known works, "A Battery Shelled" (1919, Imperial War Museum)(see [http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/ARTlewis.htm]), drawing on his own experience in charge of a 6-inch howitzer at Ypres. Lewis exhibited his war drawings and some other paintings of the war in an exhibition, "Guns", in 1918.
Alfred Munnings.
An unlikely war artist was Sir Alfred Munnings, who is best known as a painter of purebred racehorses; but he turned his painter's skills to the task of capturing images of the Canadian Cavalry Brigade in the war. His mounted portrait of General Jack Seely (later Lord Mottistone) on his charger "Warrior" achieved acclaim. Forty-five of his canvasses were exhibited at the "Canadian War Records Exhibition" at the Royal Academy, including "Charge of Flowerdew's Squadron" at Moreuil Wood in March 1918. Lieutenant Gordon Flowerdew of Lord Strathcona's Horse cavalry, was awarded the Victoria Cross for leading the attack.
Less well known are paintings which feature teams of work-horses in the staging areas behind the front lines with the Canadian Forestry Corps. The artist later recalled these days in his autobiography:
John Nash.
British painter John Nash believed that "the artist's main business is to train his eye to see, then to probe, and then to train his hand to work in sympathy with his eye."
The artist's most celebrated war painting is "Over the Top" (oil on canvas, 79.4 x 107.3 cm), now hanging in the Imperial War Museum in London. In this painting, the artist presents an image of the 30 December 1917 Welsh Ridge counter-attack, during which the 1st Battalion Artists Rifles (28th London Regiment) left their trenches and pushed towards Marcoing near Cambrai. Of the eighty men, sixty-eight were killed or wounded during the first few minutes.
Nash himself was one of the twelve spared by the shellfire in the charge depicted in the painting. He created this artwork three months later. The war artist crafted a chilling, harsh, vivid image. The painting offers a narrative of men moving forward despite the likelihood of not coming back alive:
Nash's scene of devastation in "We Are Making a New World" used the destruction of the countryside as a bitterly ironic comment on war.
Arthur Streeton.
Australian painter Arthur Streeton was an Australian Official War Artist with the Australian Imperial Force, holding the rank of lieutenant. He served in France attached to the 2nd Division.
Streeton brought something of the antipodes Heidelberg school sensibility to his paintings of an ANZAC battlefield in France.
Streeton's most famous war painting, "Amiens the key of the west" shows the Amiens countryside with dirty plumes of battlefield smoke staining the horizon, which becomes a subtle image of war.
As a war artist, Streeton continued to deal in landscapes and his works have been criticised for failing to concentrate on the fighting soldiers.
Streeton aimed to produce "military still life", capturing the everyday moments of the war. Streeton observed that, "True pictures of battlefields are very quiet looking things. There's nothing much to be seen, everybody and thing is hidden and camouflaged."
Sculpture.
Charles Webb Gilbert.
This heroic sculpture was designed as a part of the Mont St. Quentin Memorial which was dedicated in the mid-1920s at Mont St. Quentin, France. The original memorial to the men of the 2nd Australian Division features an heroic bronze statue of an Australian soldier bayoneting a German eagle.
A bronze plaque on the pedestal of the monument reads: 'To the officers, non-commissioned officers and men of the 2nd Australian Division who fought in France and Belgium in the Great War 1916, 1917, 1918.'
The statue on top of the memorial and the bas reliefs on its sides, which were sculpted respectively by Lieutenant Charles Web Gilbert and May Butler-George, were removed by the occupying German Army in 1940. They were later replaced with a new statue and new reliefs.
Remembrance.
Iconic memorials created after the war are designed as symbols of remembrance and as carefully contrived works of art.
In London, the Guards Memorial was designed by the sculptor Gilbert Ledward in 1923-26. The edifice was erected on Horse Guards Parade and dedicated to the five Foot Guards regiments of World War I. The bronze figures were cast from guns from the Great War, commemorating the First Battle of Ypres and other battles.
Literature.
World War I has been the subject of numerous novels; by far the most well-known is Erich Maria Remarque's "All Quiet on the Western Front", which presented a bleak view of the war from the German perspective.
The war was also the subject of well-known poetry, most notably by Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon, both of whom served in the war (as did Remarque). Another notable poem is "In Flanders Fields" by Canadian soldier John McCrae, who also served in the war; it led to the use of the remembrance poppy as a symbol for soldiers who have died in war.
Theatre.
Plays set during World War I include:
Films.
Over 100 films have been set, in whole or in part, in World War I. Among the most notable are:
Television.
There have been several television series and miniseries set during World War I.
The fourth series of the 1971-75 British television drama "Upstairs, Downstairs", which aired in 1974, was set during the years of World War I, and showed the war's effects from the perspective of a townhouse in London.
The 1985 Australian miniseries "Anzacs" was about members of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps during World War I.
"Blackadder Goes Forth", the fourth and final series of the British sitcom "Blackadder", which aired in 1989, presented a satirical view of the war and the British military.
"My Boy Jack" was a 2007 television film, adapted from the play of the same name, about Rudyard Kipling's son, who fought and died in France.
The second series of the British television drama "Downton Abbey", which aired in 2011, showed the effects of the war mostly from the perspective of the title estate.
Passchendaele is a 2008 Canadian war film, written, co-produced, directed by, and starring Paul Gross.
Games.
There have been comparably few games set during World War I. Many of those that have been made focused on the air war, such as Sopwith from 1984. However, NecroVision is one of the few first person shooters games set in World War I, where the player fights on known battlefields during the war, such as the Somme. Call of Duty: Black Ops II's final DLC pack will feature origins, a zombie map that is set in a dieselpunk France during World War I.

Urbach–Wiethe disease

Urbach–Wiethe disease (also known as lipoid proteinosis and hyalinosis cutis et mucosae) is a rare recessive genetic disorder, with fewer than 300 reported cases since its discovery. It was first officially reported in 1929 by Erich Urbach and Camillo Wiethe, although cases may be recognized dating back as early as 1908.
The symptoms of the disease vary greatly from individual to individual. They may include a hoarse voice, lesions and scarring on the skin, easily damaged skin with poor wound healing, dry, wrinkly skin, and beading of the papules around the eyelids. All of these are results of a general thickening of the skin and mucous membranes. In some cases there is also a hardening of brain tissue in the medial temporal lobes, which can lead to epilepsy and neuropsychiatric abnormalities. The disease is typically not life threatening and patients do not show a decreased life span.
Because Urbach–Wiethe disease is an autosomal recessive condition, individuals can be carriers of the disease but show no symptoms. The disease is caused by loss-of-function mutations to chromosome 1 at 1q21, the extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1) gene. The dermatological symptoms are caused by a buildup of a hyaline material in the dermis and the thickening of the basement membranes in the skin. Urbach–Wiethe disease is typically diagnosed by its clinical dermatological manifestations, particularly the beaded papules on the eyelids. The discovery of the mutations within the ECM1 gene has allowed the use of genetic testing to confirm an initial clinical diagnosis. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and immunohistochemical staining may also be used for diagnosis.
Currently, there is no cure for Urbach–Wiethe disease although there are ways to individually treat many of its symptoms. The discovery of the mutations of the ECM1 gene has opened the possibility of gene therapy or a recombinant ECM1 protein for Urbach–Wiethe disease treatment, but neither of these options is currently available. Some researchers are examining patients with Urbach–Wiethe disease to learn more about other conditions that exhibit similar neurological symptoms, such as autism.
Characteristics and symptoms.
Urbach–Wiethe disease is characterized by both neurological and dermatological symptoms.
Dermatological.
Although symptoms can vary greatly between affected individuals, even those within the same family, symptoms normally begin in infancy and are typically a result of thickening skin and mucous membranes. The first symptom is often a weak cry or a hoarse voice due to a thickening of the vocal cords. The hoarse voice can be one of the most striking clinical manifestations of the disease. Lesions and scars also appear on the skin, usually the face and the distal parts of the limbs. This is often the result of poor wound healing and the scarring continues to increase as the patient ages, leaving the skin with a waxy appearance. Skin may be easily damaged as a result of only a minor trauma or injury, leaving many blisters and additional scars. The skin is also usually very dry and wrinkly. White or yellow infiltrates form on the lips, buccal mucosa, tonsils, uvula, epiglottis and frenulum of the tongue. This can lead to upper respiratory tract infection and sometimes requires tracheostomy to relieve the symptom. Too much thickening of the frenulum can restrict tongue movement and may result in speech impediments. Beading of the papules around the eyelids is a very common symptom and is often used as part of a diagnosis of the disease. Some other dermatological symptoms that are sometimes seen but less common include hair loss, parotitis and other dental abnormalities, corneal ulceration, and focal degeneration of the macula.
Neurological.
Although the dermatological changes are the most obvious symptoms of Urbach–Wiethe disease, many patients also have neurological symptoms. About 50–75% of the diagnosed cases of Urbach–Wiethe disease also show bilateral symmetrical calcifications on the medial temporal lobes. These calcifications often affect the amygdala and the periamygdaloid gyri. The amygdala is thought to be involved in processing biologically relevant stimuli and in emotional long term memory, particularly those associated with fear, and both PET and MRI scans have shown a correlation between amygdala activation and episodic memory for strongly emotional stimuli. Therefore, Urbach–Wiethe disease patients with calcifications and lesions in these regions may suffer impairments in these systems. These calcifications are the result of a buildup of calcium deposits in the blood vessels within this brain region. Over time, these vessels harden and the tissue they are a part of dies, causing lesions. The amount of calcification is often related to disease duration. The true prevalence of these calcifications is difficult to accurately state as not all patients undergo brain imaging. Some patients also exhibit epilepsy and neuropsychiatric abnormalities. Epilepsy symptoms could begin with light anxiety attacks & it can be controlled with "Epilum" (Epilepsy Medicine) Other patients present with symptoms similar to schizophrenia while some suffer from mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders. 
Causes.
Researchers have mapped Urbach–Wiethe disease to chromosome 1 at 1q21 and specifically identified the extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1) gene as the gene containing mutations that can lead to the development of the condition. At this point, 41 different mutations within ECM1 have been reported to lead to Urbach–Wiethe disease. These were all homozygous loss-of-function mutations (i.e. nonsense, frameshift or internal deletions). It is an autosomal recessive condition, requiring two mutated copies of the ECM1 gene to cause the disease.
ECM1 codes for a glycoprotein of previously unknown origin. The discovery that the loss of EMC1 expression leads to the symptoms associated with Urbach–Wiethe disease suggests that ECM1 may contribute to skin adhesion, epidermal differentiation, and wound healing and scarring. It is also thought to play a role in endochondral bone formation, tumor biology, endothelial cell proliferation and blood vessel formation.
The dermatological symptoms are caused by a buildup of a hyaline material in the dermis and the thickening of the basement membranes in the skin. The nature of this material is unknown, but researchers have suggested that it may be a glycoprotein, a glycolipid, an acid mucopolysaccharide, altered collagen or elastic tissue.
Diagnosis.
Urbach–Wiethe disease is typically diagnosed by its clinical dermatological manifestations, particularly the beaded papules on the eyelids. Doctors can also test the hyaline material with a periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining, as the material colors strongly for this stain.
Immunohistochemical skin labeling for antibodies for the EMC1 protein as labeling has been shown to be reduced in the skin of those affected by Urbach–Wiethe disease. Staining with anti-type IV collagen antibodies or anti-type VII collagen antibodies reveals bright, thick bands at the dermoepidermal junction.
Non-contrast CT scans can image calcifications, but this is not typically used as a means of diagnosing the disease. This is partly due to the fact that not all Urbach-Wiethe patients exhibit calcifications, but also because similar lesions can be formed from other diseases such as herpes simplex and encephalitis. The discovery of mutations within the ECM1 gene has allowed the use of genetic testing to confirm initial clinical diagnoses of Urbach–Wiethe disease. It also allows doctors to better distinguish between Urbach–Wiethe disease and other similar diseases not caused by mutations in ECM1.
Treatment.
Currently, there is no cure for Urbach–Wiethe disease although there are some ways to individually treat many of its symptoms. There has been some success with oral dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and intralesional heparin, but this is not true in all cases. D-penicillamine has also shown promise, but has yet to been used extensively. There are also some reports of patients being treated with etretinate, a drug typically prescribed to treat psoriasis. In some cases, calcifications in the brain can lead to abnormal electrical activity among neurons. Some patients are given anti-seizure medication to help deal with these abnormalities. Tracheostomy is often used to relieve upper respiratory tract infections. Carbon dioxide laser surgery of thickened vocal cords and beaded eyelid papules have improved these symptoms for patients. The discovery of the mutations of the ECM1 gene has opened the possibility of gene therapy or a recombinant EMC1 protein for Urbach–Wiethe disease treatment, but neither of these two options are currently available.
Prognosis.
Urbach–Wiethe disease is typically not a life threatening condition. The life expectancy of these patients is normal as long as the potential side effects of thickening mucosa, such as respiratory obstruction, are properly addressed. Although this may require a tracheostomy or carbon dioxide laser surgery, such steps can help ensure that individuals with Urbach–Wiethe disease are able to live a full life. Oral dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) has been shown to reduce skin lesions, helping to minimize discomfort for these individuals.
Incidence.
Urbach–Wiethe disease is very rare; there are fewer than 300 reported cases in medical literature. Although Urbach–Wiethe disease can be found worldwide, almost a quarter of reported diagnoses are in South Africa. Many of these are in patients of Dutch, German, and Khoisan ancestry. This high frequency is thought to be due to the founder effect. Due to its recessive genetic cause and the ability to be a carrier of the disease without symptoms, Urbach–Wiethe disease often runs in families. In some regions of South Africa, up to one in 12 individuals may be carriers of the disease. Most of the case studies involving Urbach–Wiethe disease patients involve only one to three cases and these cases are often in the same family. Due to its low incidence, it is difficult to find a large enough number of cases to adequately study the disease.
History.
In 1908, what appears to be the first case of Urbach–Wiethe disease was reported by Seibenmann, a professor of otolaryngology in Basel, Switzerland. In 1925, Friedrich Miescher, a Swiss dermatologist, reported on three similar patients. An official report of Urbach–Wiethe disease was first described in 1929 by a Viennese dermatologist and otorhinolaryngologist, Urbach and Wiethe. Its original name of ‘lipoidosis cutis et mucosae’ was changed to ‘lipoid proteinosis cutis et mucosae’ due to Urbach’s belief that the condition was due to abnormal lipid and protein deposits within the tissues. Some have debated as to whether or not the disease is actually a form of mucopolysaccharidosis, amyloidosis, or even porphyria. The discovery of the Urbach–Wiethe disease causing mutation to the ECM1 gene has now provided a definitive way to differentiate Urbach–Wiethe disease from these other conditions.
Research directions.
Some neuroscientists are studying patients with Urbach–Wiethe disease as a method to learn more about other conditions. Comparisons of patients with Urbach–Wiethe disease and patients with autism may lead to greater knowledge about what causes the deficits in social cognition and behavior seen in autistic patients. Studies of patients with specific lesions can help pinpoint specific regions of the brain that may also be affected in patients with autism.
In literature.
Urbach–Wiethe disease is used as the main plot element in a 2013 Dutch novel, "De angstjager" (The Fear Hunter) by author Joris van Os.

Pound–Drever–Hall technique

The Pound–Drever–Hall (PDH) technique is a widely used and powerful approach for stabilizing the frequency (or wavelength) of light emitted by a laser, and along with very closely related techniques such as frequency-modulation spectroscopy, has a broad range of applications including interferometric gravitational wave detectors, atomic physics, and time measurement standards. A wide range of conditions contribute to determine the spectrum produced by a laser and the PDH technique is a means to control and/or exploit a laser’s spectrum, for instance in tunable lasers. A key element of the technique is its response to the frequency of laser emission independent of intensity because many of the methods that control a laser’s emission frequency also affect its intensity. A typical application of the PDH technique is a control system in which the resonances of a Fabry-Pérot optical cavity are detected and used to feed back a correction signal to the laser. 
Named after R. V. Pound, Ronald Drever, and John L. Hall, the technique was described in 1983 by Drever, Hall and others working at the University of Glasgow and the U. S. National Bureau of Standards, and had similarities to an older frequency-modulation technique developed by Pound for microwave cavities.
Laser stabilization.
All lasers demonstrate some kind of frequency wander – this is an artifact of temperature variations, which change laser cavity lengths, laser driver current and voltage fluctuations, atomic transition widths, and many other factors. PDH locking offers one possible solution to this problem by actively tuning the laser to match the resonance condition of a stable reference cavity.
In recent years the Pound–Drever–Hall technique has become a mainstay of modern laser frequency stabilization and is the basis of many of types of precision laser stabilization. Prominently, the field of interferometric gravitational wave detection depends critically on enhanced sensitivity afforded by optical cavities.
Overview of technique.
[[Image:PDHBasicLayout.png|400px|thumb|Schematic of PDH servo loop to lock a the frequency of a laser to a Fabry–Perot cavity. Light from the laser is sent through a phase-modulator and is then directed upon the cavity. The isolator is not involved in the PDH setup; it is present only to ensure that light from various optical components does not reflect back into the laser. The polarizing beamsplitter and λ/4 plate act in combination to discriminate between the two directions of light travel: light traveling in the direction 1→2 passes straight through and on to the cavity, while light traveling in the direction 2→1 (i.e., from the cavity) is diverted toward the photodetector.
The phase modulator is driven with a sinusoidal signal from the oscillator; this impresses sidebands onto the laser light. As described in the section on the PDH readout function, the reflected light is directed upon a photodetector, and the resulting voltage is demodulated (that is, passed through the mixer and the low-pass filter) to produce an error signal that is fed back into the laser's frequency control port.]]
Phase modulated light, consisting of a carrier frequency and two side bands, is directed onto a two mirror cavity. Light reflected off the cavity is measured using a high speed photodetector, the reflected signal consists of the two unaltered side bands along with a phase shifted carrier component. This light is then measured using a photodetector and is mixed down with a phase shifted local oscillator and low pass filtered. The resulting electronic readout signal gives a measure of how far the laser carrier is off resonance with the cavity.
PDH readout function.
The PDH readout function gives a measure of the resonance condition of a cavity. By taking the derivative of the cavity transfer function (which is symmetric and even) with respect to frequency, it is an odd function of frequency and hence indicates not only whether there is a mismatch between the output frequency "ω" of the laser and the resonant frequency "ω"res of the cavity, but also whether "ω" is greater or less than "ω"res. The zero-crossing of the readout function is sensitive only to intensity fluctuations due to the frequency of light in the cavity and insensitive to intensity fluctuations from the laser itself.
Light of frequency can be represented mathematically by its electric field, "E"0"eiωt". If this light is then phase-modulated by "β"sin("ω"m"t"), the resulting field "E"i is 
This field may be regarded as the superposition of three components. The first component is an electric field of angular frequency "ω", known as the "carrier", and the second and third components are fields of angular frequency and , respectively, called the "sidebands".
In general, the light "E"out reflected out of a Fabry–Pérot two-mirror cavity is related to the light "E"in incident on the cavity by the following transfer function:
where , and where "r"1 and "r"2 are the reflection coefficients of mirrors 1 and 2 of the cavity, and "t"1 and "t"2 are the transmission coefficients of the mirrors.
[PDH readout.svg|thumb|400px|Simulated plots of a two-mirror Fabry–Perot cavity reflection transfer function and a PDH readout signal. "Top:" Square magnitude "R"*"R" of reflection transfer function; i.e., the reflected power. "Middle:" Phase arctan[Im("R")/Re("R") of reflection transfer function. "Bottom:" PDH readout function "V", with demodulation phase "φ" = π/2. The mirrors of the simulated cavity were chosen to have amplitude reflectivities "r"1 = 0.99 and "r"2 = 0.98, and the cavity length was "L" = 1 m. The phase modulation frequency of the light was chosen to be "f"m = 23 MHz ("f"m = "ω"m/2π). The portion of the PDH readout function that is useful as a servo error signal is the linear region near "f"res.
The reflected power and the PDH readout function are often monitored in real time as traces on an oscilloscope in order to assess the state of an optical cavity and its servo loop.]]
Applying this transfer function to the phase-modulated light "E"i gives the reflected light "E"r:
The power "Pr" of the reflected light is proportional to the square magnitude of the electric field, "Er* Er", which after some algebraic manipulation can be shown to be
Here "P"0 ∝ |"E"0|2 is the power of the light incident on the Fabry–Pérot cavity, and "χ" is defined by
This "χ" is the ultimate quantity of interest; it is an antisymmetric function of . It can be extracted from "P"r by demodulation. First, the reflected beam is directed onto a photodiode, which produces a voltage "V"r that is proportional to "P"r. Next, this voltage is mixed with a phase-delayed version of the original modulation voltage to produce "V"′r:
Finally, "V"′r is sent through a low-pass filter to remove any sinusoidally oscillating terms. This combination of mixing and low-pass filtering produces a voltage "V" that contains only the terms involving "χ":
In theory, "χ" can be completely extracted by setting up two demodulation paths, one with and another with . In practice, by judicious choice of "ω"m it is possible to make "χ" almost entirely real or almost entirely imaginary, so that only one demodulation path is necessary. "V"("ω"), with appropriately chosen "φ", is the PDH readout signal.

Get Karl! Oh Soo-jung () is a 2007 South Korean romantic comedy television seriesn starring Uhm Jung-hwa and Oh Ji-ho. It aired on SBS from July 28 to September 16, 2007 on Saturdays and Sundays at 21:45 for 16 episodes.
The series is based on the real-life love story of Lee Ju-young, the CEO of the drama's production company who reunited with her current husband ten years after breaking up with him. Moreover, Go Man-soo is the actual name of Lee's pro-golfer husband who incidentally instructed Oh Ji-ho on his golf swings in preparation for the role. 
Plot.
Throughout her school days, Oh Soo-jung (Uhm Jung-hwa) was the girl every boy wanted to date and every girl wanted to be. But having watched her poor family disintegrate after her mother abandoned her incompetent father, Soo-jung naturally became cynical and demanding when it came to picking her choice of man. She dates Go Man-soo (Oh Ji-ho), an Ivy League law student, despite the lack of physical attraction (he is overweight and nerdy). But the moment she finds out that he failed his bar exam, poor Man-soo gets dumped. But eight years later, the tables are turned. Soo-jung, now in her thirties, is no longer in demand. The former "it girl" has since fallen from grace. She manages the jewelry store owned by a less attractive schoolmate who married a lawyer and now barks at Soo-jung every chance she gets. 
Man-soo returns from the States a changed man; he has transformed into famous, rich, hunky pro-golfer Karl Go. He hires Jung Woo-tak (Kang Sung-jin) to play a wealthy bachelor, and after Soo-jung fall in love with him, jilt her at the altar, just like she did to Man-soo. Meanwhile, Karl pretends to be the debt-ridden boyfriend of Soo-jung's boarder Yook Dae-soon (Park Da-an). But his revenge plans go awry when he and Soo-jung fall in love with each other again. On her wedding day to Woo-tak, Soo-jung runs away and chooses Karl despite believing he's poor. Bitter that Karl chose a girdle-clad "old maid" over her, Dae-soon not only steals her creative ideas for jewelry design but reveals to Soo-jung that Karl has been making a fool of her all this time. In the end, Soo-jung triumphs over Dae-soon professionally, then proposes to Karl and they finally get married.
International broadcast.
In the Philippines, it was one of TV5's launching programs, under the title "Oh Su-jung vs. Karl".

Sumi Naga

The Sumi or Sema Naga is one of the major Naga tribes in Nagaland, India. The Sumis mainly inhabit the Zunheboto district, although many have migrated outside Nagaland for work and education.
They are also the most united and aggressive tribe. Since times immemorial, the other tribes have feared the Sumi Tribe. Despite their ferocity and aggressive nature in warfare, the Sumi Tribe is also known for their simplicity and honesty. Their loyalty towards their tribesmen and friends is unparalleled.
The Sumis practised headhunting like other Naga tribes before the arrival of the Christian missionaries and their subsequent conversion to Christianity. Anthropological study of the Sumi tribe is documented in the book "The Sema Nagas" by J. H. Hutton, who was a Professor of Social Anthropology in the University of Cambridge. The Sumi is one of the recognised scheduled tribes of India.
Population.
According to the 2001 census of India, Sumi Nagas number 242,000
Religion.
The ancestral religion of the Sumis was the worship of nature. With the arrival of Baptist missionaries in the 20th century, like other "Naga" tribes, today, Sumis are 99.9% Christians. Very few of them still practice animism.
Distribution.
Sumi Nagas mostly inhabit the central and southern regions of Nagaland; "Zunheboto" is the district of the Sumis and they also live in districts such as Dimapur, Kohima, Kiphire, Mokokchung, Tuensang, etc. There are also seven Sumi villages in Tinsukia District of Assam.
Clan system.
Sumis have two different clan-heads, viz. "Swu (Sumi)" and "Tuku (Tukumi)".
Festivals.
The Sumis celebrate many festivals which have been carried down from generations. Most of these festivals usually mark the beginning of new seasons, harvesting of new crops or victory at war. The two major festivals that are currently popular among them are:

John Hooker Leavitt

John Hooker Leavitt (1831–1906) was an early banker and Iowa state senator who was born at Heath, Massachusetts, but who later moved westward to Iowa in search of fortune.
John H. Leavitt was the son of Col. Roger Hooker Leavitt, a businessman, politician and noted Massachusetts abolitionist. Young Leavitt studied civil engineering, and early in his career was contracted by John Roebling, the builder of the Brooklyn Bridge, to survey a large tract of land. Having gained some measure of confidence in his abilities, Leavitt struck out for the west in 1854, reaching Dubuque, Iowa, where he remained for less than a year before settling at Waterloo, Iowa.
While in Dubuque, Leavitt married Caroline Clark Ware of Granville, Illinois. Shortly after his move to Waterloo, the young engineer decided on a change of career, and became a banker. Within a decade he founded his own private banking firm.
Several years later, on the admission of a new partner, the sole proprietorship of Leavitt's bank necessitated a change of name to Leavitt & Lusch. Subsequently, on the addition of another partner, the bank became known as Leavitt, Johnson & Lusch. On the retirement of partner A. T. Lusch, the business became known as Leavitt & Johnson Bank, under which name the firm operated from 1876 to 1898, when the firm was reorganized as Leavitt & Johnson National Bank, with a capital stock of $100,000.
John Hooker Leavitt worked at the firm for 50 years, during the various permutations of the corporation's name. He served as president of the institution, located at Commercial and Fourth Streets in downtown Waterloo, until 1901.
In 1871, Leavitt was elected to the Iowa Senate, where he was engaged in the fight to prevent the return of James Harlan to the United States Senate after his service as a member of Abraham Lincoln's cabinet. A staunch Republican, Leavitt served only one term in the Iowa State Senate.
After leaving the state senate, Leavitt devoted his time to his business affairs, as well as his membership in the Congregational Church of Waterloo. He was an early benefactor of Talladega College, Alabama's oldest historically black college, and in 1903 he joined the Pocumtuck Valley Memorial Association in Deerfield, Massachusetts, where his father Roger Hooker Leavitt had served as vice president.
John H. Leavitt's brother William also lived in Waterloo, but eventually relocated to Minneapolis, Minnesota. Hon. John Hooker Leavitt and his wife had five children: Roger of Cedar Falls, Iowa; Joseph, who lived in Illinois; Mary Leavitt Davison, wife of Robert A. Davison; Lucy O. Leavitt; and Grace, who married Thomas Cascaden Jr.
John H. Leavitt's father, abolitionist Roger Hooker Leavitt, died in Waterloo in 1885 while on a visit to his son. Col. Roger Hooker Leavitt's body was returned to Charlemont, Massachusetts, longtime home of the family, for burial. John Hooker Leavitt died at Waterloo in 1906.

Charles Ranken

Charles Edward Ranken (5 January 1828 – 12 April 1905) was a Church of England clergyman and a minor British chess master. He co-founded and was the first president of the Oxford University Chess Club. He was also the editor of the "Chess Player's Chronicle" and a writer for the "British Chess Magazine". Ranken is best known today as the co-author of "Chess Openings Ancient and Modern" (1889), one of the first important opening treatises in the English language.
Education and religious career.
Ranken was born in Brislington, near Bristol, on 5 January 1828, son of Rev. Charles Ranken Sr. He learned chess at age 12, but first made a serious study of the game while attending Wadham College, Oxford University in 1847–50. He particularly devoted himself to study of Howard Staunton's "The Chess-Player's Handbook" (1847), a book that he said "marked the beginning of a new era in English chess literature". 
In 1867, Ranken became vicar at Sandford-on-Thames and lived at Oxford. He and Lord Randolph Churchill (Winston Churchill's father) founded the Oxford University Chess Club in April 1869, with Ranken becoming its first president. In 1871, he resigned his vicarage and moved to Malvern, England, where he remained for the rest of his life.
Family.
Ranken's wife, Louisa Jane, died on 10 February 1903. Census records reflect that she was born in Pendleton, Greater Manchester, was 14 years Ranken's junior, and that they married sometime between 1861 and 1871, and had at least three children: daughters Francis (born "c." 1871) and Emily (born "c." 1876), and son Herbert (born "c." 1878). Ranken died at Malvern on 12 April 1905. His executors were named as Arthur William Ranken and Edward Ranken.
Chess tournament career.
Ranken was a leading member of a group of reverends who played a prominent role in early Victorian Era English chess. In addition to Ranken, these included the Reverends George Alcock MacDonnell, John Owen, William Wayte, Edmund Thorold, and Arthur Skipworth. Mike Fox and Richard James remark that, "The English parsons were a talented mob; presumably quiet country parishes in the nineteenth century gave one the leisure needed to become a star." However, Philip Sergeant in his book "A Century of British Chess" writes that, "In chess he was one of the writing rather than the fighting clergy, and his delight lay most in analysis".
Despite Sergeant's characterization, Ranken played in a number of tournaments in Britain between 1851 and 1895. After leaving Oxford, he played in the provincial section of the great London 1851 tournament, finished second behind Samuel Boden. By 1859, the Chess Player's Chronicle ranked him the best English player outside of London. He played in many congresses organized by the Counties Chess Association. His best result was in 1872, when he finished first in the first-class section at the 8th British Counties Chess Association Congress in Malvern with 12 of 14 possible points, ahead of Revs. Thorold (11.5 points) and Wayte (10.5 points). He had another excellent performance in 1881, when he won the 16th British Counties Chess Association Congress in Leamington, scoring 8 of 9 possible points, ahead of Revs. Owen (7.5 points) and Wayte (7 points). In 1877, he won the Counties Chess Association handicap tournament at Birmingham.
At the 1883 London Vizayanagaram minor tournament, Ranken "started well but his health gave way after the first week". He still scored 17.5 of 25 possible points, tying for 5th–6th out of 26 players with George H. D. Gossip. Curt von Bardeleben won with 21.5 points; Isidor Gunsberg, who would narrowly lose an 1890–91 World Championship match to Wilhelm Steinitz, finished fourth with 19 points.
The strongest tournament in which Ranken played was the Master Tournament at Hereford 1885, an 11-player tournament that featured some of the world's leading players. Ranken scored 3 of 10 possible points, tying for 8th–10th with William Pollock and Thorold. Joseph Henry Blackburne won with 8 points, followed by Henry Bird and Emil Schallopp (7.5 points), George Henry Mackenzie (7 points), and Gunsberg and James Mason (5.5 points).
Ranken also participated in several correspondence chess matches and took first place in the British Chess Association’s 1872 competition.
Chess writing.
Ranken and Wayte assisted Skipworth, the chief editor, in writing "The Chess Players' Quarterly Chronicle", which was published in York from February 1868 to December 1871. Ranken was also a contributor to the similarly named "The Chess Player's Chronicle", whose editor-in-chief was J. Jenkin of Helensburgh, which ran from January to March 1875 and was billed as a "monthly record of provincial chess" and published at Glasgow. It was revived in January 1876, with Ranken as its editor-in-chief, and ran until September 1880. In its pages in 1879, he analyzed 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Bb5 a6 5.Bxc6, a favorable variation for White in the Four Knights Game, which was named the Ranken Variation after him.
Ranken next became a member of the staff of the "British Chess Magazine" ("BCM"), which began publication in January 1881 under the editorship of John Watkinson. There, Ranken specialized in analysis of the opening, middlegame and endgame. For example, the March 1898 issue featured his analysis of the Rice Gambit. In 1897, the BCM published his article "Chess Reminiscences in the Victorian Era", in which he wrote, "With great defects he had great virtues; there was nothing mean, cringing, or small in his nature, and, taking him all in all, England never had a more worthy chess representative than Howard Staunton." 
Ranken is remembered today as the co-author, with Edward Freeborough, of the opening treatise "Chess Openings Ancient and Modern", a precursor of "Modern Chess Openings". The first edition of the book was published in 1889. Later editions were published in 1893, 1896, and 1910. It was one of the first opening books written in columnar form: columns of move-sequences thought to constitute best play, presented in chess notation and concluding with a symbol indicating the analyst's assessment of the final position (such as "equal", "White wins", or "advantage to Black"). The book also set forth a number of general principles, many of which are still valid today.
Even modern grandmasters study the book. Frank Brady wrote in his biography of World Champion Bobby Fischer that "Chess Openings Ancient and Modern" was one of the most heavily annotated books in Fischer's personal library. Fischer had pencilled in his own analyses of the Scotch Game, Giuoco Piano, Evans Gambit, Bishop's Gambit, Danish Gambit, and other openings. Specifically referring to the analysis in "Chess Openings Ancient and Modern", Grandmaster Robert Byrne wrote in a 1991 New York Times chess column, "Ingenious strategies and tactics were tried out in the old days, and if your opponent knows them and you don't, you are in for a pounding." Likewise Fischer, in his famous book "My 60 Memorable Games", annotating an Evans Gambit that he had won against Reuben Fine, cited analysis from the 1893 edition of "Chess Openings Ancient and Modern" as an improvement on Fine's ninth move.
Notable games.
Savielly Tartakower and Julius du Mont call the following game, played in 1885 between William Wayte (playing White) and Ranken, "One of many fine games played between the two reverend gentlemen, but a particularly thrilling one."<br>1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.c3 Nf6 4.d4 Nxe4 5.d5 Bc5 A speculative piece sacrifice. Either 5...Ne7 or 5...Nb8 leads to equal play. 6.dxc6 Bxf2+ 6...Nxf2 7.Qd5 is strong for White. 7.Ke2 d5!? Not mentioned in "MCO-15", which gives only 7...bxc6. "MCO-15" and Tartakower and du Mont agree that in that event 8.Qa4 f5 9.Nbd2 leaves Black with inadequate compensation for the sacrificed piece. 8.cxb7 Bxb7 9.Qa4+ c6 10.Nbd2 f5 11.Nxe4 fxe4 12.Kxf2 0-0 13.Be3 gxf3 14.g3 After 14.gxf3 e4, "White's troubles are only beginning". 14...Qc8 15.Bc5 Rf6 16.Rd1 a5 17.Rd2 Ba6 18.Bxa6 Qxa6 19.Re1 e4 20.a3 The immediate 20.b4 would leave White "better able to weather the storm". 20...Qc8 21.Kg1 Qh3 22.b4 Re8 23.Qxa5 h5 24.Qa6 h4 25.Qf1 Qg4 26.Qf2 Rg6 27.b5? The only possible defense was 27.Kh1 hxg3 Qxg3. Now Black has a crushing attack. 27...hxg3 28.hxg3 28.Qxg3 Qf5 wins White's queen. 28...Rh6 29.Be3 Rh3 30.Bf4 Qh5 31.Qh2 Rxh2 32.Rxh2 Qg6 33.b6 e3 A deflecting sacrifice. 34.Rxe3 Rxe3 35.Bxe3 Qxg3+ 36.Kh1 Qe1+ 37.Bg1 Qxc3 and Black won.
The same players in 1890 played another game with the same opening. It again featured speculative sacrificial play by Ranken, this time including a double rook sacrifice. 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.c3 Nf6 4.d4 d5 5.Bb5 Nxe4 6.Nex5 Bd7 7.Qb3 Nxe5 8.Qxd5! Qe7 9.Qxb7 Bxb5 10.Qxa8+ Kd7 11.dxe5 Correct is 11.Qd5, keeping the advantage. Qxe5+ 12.Be3 Bc5! Sacrificing the second rook. 13.Qxh8 Nxf2! 14.Kd2 Bxe3+ 0-1 
For another game between these players, see William Wayte.

Coincidence and Likely Stories

Coincidence and Likely Stories was the thirteenth studio album by Buffy Sainte-Marie but her first for sixteen years, during which time she had been raising her son and working on the children's television show "Sesame Street". The album itself was largely recorded at Sainte-Marie's home before being sent to producer Chris Birkett for the final production and mixing in London.
The album showed her continuing with the electronic music she had first developed on "Illuminations" and the tribal themes seen on "Sweet America", her last pre-retirement album.
Although the album received some very favourable reviews and was often seen as her best work since "Illuminations", it failed to make any impression in the United States. "Coincidence and Likely Stories" became her only album to chart in the UK, and featured two minor hit singles there.
The album title itself comes from the first line of the song "Disinformation":

Carolinian people

The Carolinian, or Refaluwasch, people are an Austronesian ethnic group who originated in the South Pacific, eastern Caroline Islands, with a total population of around 8,500 people. It is thought that their ancestors may have originally immigrated from Asia and Indonesia to Micronesia around 2,000 years ago. Their primary language is Carolinian, called "Refaluwasch" by native speakers, which has a total of about 5,700 speakers. The Carolinians have a matriarchal society in which respect is a very important factor in their daily lives, especially toward the matriarchs. Most Carolinians are of the Roman Catholic faith.
The immigration of Carolinians to Saipan began in the early 19th century, after the Spanish reduced the local population of Chamorro natives to just 3,700. They began to immigrate mostly sailing from small canoes from other islands, which a typhoon previously devastated. The Carolinians have a much darker complexion than the native Chamorros.

Odontoglossum crispum

Odontoglossum crispum (Curled Odontoglossum) is an epiphytic orchid from the genus "Odontoglossum". It is considered by many to be the most beautiful orchid of all but is also one of the most difficult to grow.
Description.
"O. crispum" has an ovoid pseudobulb, between 3 and 4 inches long, from the apex of which emerge two soft-textured, erect to arching, linear to strap shaped or lanceolate leaves. The leaves are sharply pointed at the tip and narrowed below where they are longitudinally folded along the mid-vein at the base to form a long, narrow, petiole-like stem.
The gracefully arching flower spike, which can be up to 20 inches long, emerges from the base of a recently matured pseudobulb along the centre-line of the upper basal sheath. Flowers are closely spaced in a raceme on the upper part of the flower spike, but there are often two or three lateral branches at the base of the raceme. Each flower is carried on a pedicellate ovary that is up to 0.9 in long.
There are between 6 and 24 flowers on each inflorescence. The blossoms are the most variable in the Odontoglossum genus in terms of size, colour and degree of crimpling along the segment margins. The flowers are mostly white or pale rose, sometimes more or less spotted and blotched with brownish or reddish brown. The callus at the base of the lip is yellow and is often marked with red lines. The widely spread, flat-opening flowers are 3 to 4 inches across with very wide sepals that are elliptic, have sharply pointed tips, often overlap and are variously crisped or wavy-margined or toothed and notched along the margins. The dorsal sepal is lanceolate to egg-shaped, undulate on the margin and 1.2 to 2.0 inches long by 0.5 to 0.9 inches wide. The obliquely spreading lateral sepals are similar in size to the dorsal sepal. The horizontally spreading petals are egg-shaped to elliptic or oblong elliptic, 1.2 to 1.8 inches long by 0.7 to 1.5 inches wide, and have margins that are wavy and fairly deeply notched or toothed. The lip is oblong or somewhat fiddle-shaped. It is 0.8 to 1.2 inches long by 0.5 to 0.6 inches wide, has toothed margins and is rather sharply pointed at the apex. The callus is fleshy with a pair of diverging lobes at the apex. The slender, slightly arching column is 0.6 to 0.7 inches long and has a pair of broad wings with fringed margins toward the apex.
Distribution and natural habitat.
"O. crispum" is found in the montane forest of Colombia, at altitudes of between and , including in the eastern Cordillera in the departments of Cundinamarca and Boyacá and in the Andes of southern Colombia in the departments of Cauca, Putumayato and Nariño.
The plants grow as epiphytes in clearings and along forest edges. They grow chiefly on the trunks and main branches of oak trees in partial shade and occasionally full sun.
Throughout the year, days average 66–70°F and nights average 50–53°F, with a diurnal range of 14–19°F. Rainfall is light to moderate throughout the year, but there is no actual dry season. In addition, more moisture is available from heavy dew and mist. Humidity is 70–75% throughout the year.
"O. crispum" comes in an array of shapes, colours, and shades, from pure white to flush pink. The variability of the flower is associated with discrete areas; in the Pacho area (30 miles north of Bogota) are found the finest varieties, full round pure white and spotted flowers with broad overlapping sepals and petals; in the Vélez area (further north) the flowers are similar but shaded rose; south of Bogota, in the Fusagasugá region (25 miles south of Bogota), the white mauve tinted stellate flowers; while in Nariño, the "O. crispum" var. Lehmannii is found which bears up to 80 small flowers on a branched inflorescence.
Cultivation.
"O. crispum" requires cool, well watered, humid conditions, with medium to heavy shade to thrive and after growth has slowed in the autumn it needs a slight lessening of water and fertilizer.
Rather shaded conditions are required, in low to moderate light, which should be filtered or diffused; plants should never be exposed to direct midday sun. Strong air movement should be provided at all times.
Plants should be potted in a well drain medium such as medium fir bark. Plants should be watered often while actively growing, but drainage should be excellent, and conditions around the roots should become rather dry between the watering. Water should be reduced in late autumn after new growth has matured; water should be reduced further in winter, particular for plants grown in dark, short-day conditions common in temperate latitudes. Plants should not, however, be allowed to dry out completely. Fertilizer should be reduced or eliminated until heavier watering is resumed in spring.
Ideally, the plants grow best in a cool marine climate, such as the California fog belt or the Pacific Northwest. Elsewhere, high daytime temperatures will enfeeble and destroy it, unless air-conditioning is available.
Discovery and introduction to Europe.
"O. crispum" was discovered in 1841 by Karl Theodor Hartweg, in the high Andes Mountains, near Pacho in the department of Cundinamarca, Colombia, during one of his plant collecting expeditions for the Royal Horticultural Society. It was named "Crispum" by John Lindley, a reference to the crisped edges of the flower.
None of the plants shipped from the 1841 expedition survived the trip back to England, and it was not until 1863 that the plant first flowered in England, once growers had been able to re-create the cool natural habitat of these "alpine" plants. English growers had initially believed that the Colombian tropics were hot and steaming jungles and tried to grow the plant in the hot-houses favoured by Victorian horticulturists. It was not until growers found how to lower the temperature of their glasshouses, by running water on the outside of the glass panels and having water dripping in front of the open sides to cool down the air, that the plant was able to survive and flower in England.
As Orchid mania reached its height, several London orchid houses, including Rollisson of Tooting, Veitch of Chelsea, and Low of Clapton, sent out plant collectors to bring back samples of "O. crispum". Amongst the Veitch collectors were David Bowman, who successfully located "O. crispum" "Alexandrae" in Colombia in 1867, Henry Chesterton who discovered the variety "O. crispum" "Chestertonii" (named after him) in the late 1870s, Guillermo Kalbreyer, who in June 1881 "sent home a collection of Orchids, consisting principally of "O. crispum"", and David Burke, who collected in Colombia from 1894 to 1896.
In his book, "About Orchids – A Chat" published in 1893, Frederick Boyle describes the "harvesting" of "O. crispum" from Colombia. The collector would make Bogotá his headquarters from where he would need to travel "about ten days to the southward" by mule. On reaching his destination, he would "hire a wood; that is, a track of mountain clothed more or less with timber" from a tribal chief. He would then hire "natives, twenty or fifty or a hundred, as circumstances advise" and set them to cut down all the trees. In the meantime, the collector would build "a wooden stage of sufficient length to bear the plunder expected" where he would clean, sort and dry the orchids. Each tree would produce between three and five usable specimens. He goes on to explain:
"It is a terribly wasteful process. If we estimate that a good tree has been felled for every three scraps of Odontoglossum which are now established in Europe, that will be no exaggeration. And for many years past they have been arriving by hundreds of thousands annually! But there is no alternative. A European cannot explore that green wilderness overhead; if he could, his accumulations would be so slow and costly as to raise the proceeds to an impossible figure. The natives will not climb, and they would tear the plants to bits. Timber has no value in those parts as yet, but the day approaches when Government must interfere."
"O. crispum" appears frequently in the illustrations of John Day in his scrapbooks – 40 times between 1865 and 1887. The species was highly sought after in Victorian times, both for the diversity of its flower colour and as a cool-growing species that could be successfully cultivated. By 1889, varieties were sold for more than 150 guineas at auction.
Varieties and hybrids.
"O. crispum" shows many variations ranging from pure white to yellow to rose, including various highly spotted flowers. In the 1901 edition of his Orchid Guide, Sander described 108 varieties of O. crispum and 27 natural hybrids having crispum as a possible parent. The natural hybrids include:
"O. crispum" has been regularly used in hybridization as it promotes flowers of good size and shape.
Synonyms.
Because of its varied nature, many botanists have incorrectly identified plants as separate species, including:
Bateman named the orchid "O. alexandrae" after the then Princess of Wales, Alexandra of Denmark, generating confusion which lasted for several years.

Kamilo Beach

Kamilo Beach (literally, "the twisting" or "swirling currents" in Hawaiian), is a beach located on the southeast coast of the island of Hawaii. It is known for its accumulation of plastic marine debris from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.
History.
In ancient times, Kamilo Beach was a location where Native Hawaiians would go to find large evergreen logs, drifted ashore from the Pacific Northwest, for building dugout canoes. It was also a location where those who were lost at sea might eventually wash ashore.
Description.
Kamilo Beach is approximately long, and is located on the remote southeast coast of the Kaū District on the island of Hawaii, at coordinates . There are no paved roads to the beach.
This beach, situated on a lower lava terrace, is a storm beach. It was formed by the deposit of large amounts of sand blown by prevailing winds.
At the point of Kamilo, waves have cut a large indentation, creating a variety of rocky points, ponds, and channels. Most of these are exposed during low tides, and are awash during high tides.
The debris is situated on the narrow, crescent-shaped strip of white sand, formed along the inland border of this area.
The beach is an accumulation zone for plastic trash. The debris is forced onto the beach by constant trade winds and converging ocean currents.
The backshore at Kamilo contains such vegetation as naupaka, milo, and ironwood.

The accumulated garbage that covers Kamilo Beach and an adjacent 2.8 miles (4.5 km) of shoreline consists of 90% plastic. Although some of the items comprising the trash are household products, the vast majority by weight are fishing related such as nets, rope, cones used to trap hagfish, spacers used in oyster farming, buoys, crates, and baskets. Much of the debris is made from plastic pellets, either pre-production nurdles or pellets created from larger plastic items breaking down into smaller pieces.
Environmental impact.
Wildlife in the area has suffered significant damage due to the on- and off-shore garbage. Fishing debris, such as discarded fishing nets and lines, drowns, strangles, and traps birds and marine mammals.
Some types of plastic and their constituents, such as bisphenol A, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, and polystyrene, leach carcinogenic or poisonous chemicals when they break down. Others absorb toxins such as DDT and polychlorinated biphenyls from their surroundings. These toxins are absorbed by animals when consumed.
Cleanup efforts.
Multiple community-based cleanup efforts have taken place on Kamilo Beach in recent years. Prior to these efforts, the debris was high in some places. Most of the efforts to clean up marine debris from Kamilo Beach have been led by the Hawaii Wildlife Fund and their countless beach cleanup volunteers, however other groups, including Imi Pono No Ka 'Aina, Hawaii Rainbow Gatherings, "CITO" geocachers, Sierra Club Hawaii and Beach Environmental Awareness Campaign Hawaii have also helped coordinate occasional events. In 2003, the Hawaii Wildlife Fund organized 100 volunteers and removed over 50 tons (45 metric tonnes) of fishing nets and other marine debris from the beach. They continue to host regular beach cleanup efforts in the region and can be reached at www.wildhawaii.org for more info about upcoming events 
In November 2007, Beach Environmental Awareness Campaign Hawaii volunteers removed more than 4 million pieces of plastic from Kamilo Beach.

Wu Hsing-kuo

Wu Hsing-kuo (吳興國) is a Taiwanese actor of the silver screen and theater, known for both his performance of complex movie roles as much as for his innovative adaptations of Western classics into traditional Peking Opera.
Wu was trained in classical Peking Opera since the age of 11 in Taiwan's state-run Fu-Hsing Chinese Opera School, specializing in "wu sheng" (male martial) roles. He was admitted with honors into the Theatre Department of Chinese Culture University in Taipei, trained under master Chou Cheng-jung (Zhou Zheng-rong) and became leading dancer of Lin Hwai-min's Cloud Gate Dance Theatre.
In 1986, he and a group of enthusiastic friends founded the Contemporary Legend Theatre (當代傳奇劇場) in Taipei, seeking to revitalize traditional Chinese theatre by adapting Western classical plays to the style and techniques of Peking Opera. He was the leading actor and director of four Shakespeare adaptations, including the critically acclaimed Kingdom of Desire (慾望城國), an adaptation of Macbeth, and King Lear (李爾在此), in which Wu plays all the parts.
In 1992, Wu was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship to study in New York with Richard Schechner. That year, he also won the Hong Kong Film Award for best new actor.
Wu is currently artistic director of the Contemporary Legend Theatre, and continues to take on challenging roles in both the modern theatre and Chinese Opera. He crosses the fields of traditional opera, dance, modern theatre, cinema, and television.

Polyporoletus

Polyporoletus is a genus of fungi in the family Albatrellaceae. The genus was first described by mycologist Walter H. Snell in 1936 to accommodate an unusual terrestrial polypore with a stipe that had been found in the ground in pine-oak woods in Fentress County, Tennessee. He named this specimen "Polyporoletus sublividus"; the generic name refers to the possible relationship to both the boletes and the polypores. Although this species would be later transferred to the genus "Scutiger", it is now considered to be "Polyporoletus". Currently there is only one other species in the genus, "P. neotropicus" Mata & Ryvarden (2007).

Ioway Reservation

The Iowa Reservation of the Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska of Kansas and Nebraska straddles the borders of southeast Richardson County in southeastern Nebraska and Brown and Doniphan Counties in northeastern Kansas. Tribal headquarters are west of White Cloud, Kansas. The reservation was defined in a treaty from March 1861. Today the tribe operates Casino White Cloud on the reservation.
History.
The Iowa, or Baxoje as they call themselves, Tribe originated in the Great Lakes region. They migrated south and west into Missouri, but were relocated to Kansas under the provisions of the Platte Purchase of 1836. Subsequent treaties in 1854 and 1861 further reduced the Iowa land holdings to the "Diminished Reserve." A band of Iowas left the reservation for Indian Territory beginning in 1878. They became the Iowa Tribe of Oklahoma. The bands that stayed became the Iowa Tribe of Kansas and Nebraska.
Today, the Iowa reservation consists of that are almost evenly divided between the states of Kansas and Nebraska. The reservation includes parts of Brown counties in Kansas and Richardson County in Nebraska.
Size.
Located along the Missouri River, the reservation was once approximately reservation includes owned by the Tribe and in tribal member allotments. There were owned by the Tribe in Kansas, with an additional in tribal member allotments. In 1995 Bureau of Indian Affairs indicated that were of Iowa tribal lands in trust status. Today the tribe reports the Iowa Tribe owns within the reservation.
Activities.
The tribe farms , with portions of the remaining acres balanced between in pastures and woods. There is also a haying operation that supports 150 cattle. The tribe also owns and operates Casino White Cloud and a service station, and employs 186 people. As a sovereign nation the reservation has its own police and fire department, tribal court, health clinic, community health representatives, a senior citizen center, and meal site for seniors with a delivery program. The tribe sponsors a Fourth of July rodeo, a demolition derby in August, and the Iowa Tribe Powwow each September.

Irene Palaiologina, Empress of Bulgaria

Irene Palaiologina (, ) was the eldest daughter of Byzantine emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos and empress Theodora Doukaina Vatatzaina, and empress consort of Ivan Asen III of Bulgaria.
Life.
Fearing the rapid success of Ivaylo's revolt in Bulgaria, Michael VIII summoned Ivan Asen, a descendant of Bulgaria's ruling dynasty living at the Byzantine Empire (he was the son of Mitso Asen, who reigned in 1256-57), granted him the title of "despotes", and married him to Irene in 1277 or 1278. Michael VIII then sent several Byzantine armies in an attempt to install Ivan Asen III on the throne. This caused an alliance between Ivaylo and the dowager Bulgarian empress Maria Kantakouzene: she married Ivaylo, who was recognized as Bulgarian emperor in 1278, without deposing or disinheriting the young Michael Asen II, her son by the late Constantine Tikh, whom Ivaylo killed at the beginning of the revolt. Although Ivaylo defeated several of Michael VIII's attempts to depose him, he was blockaded for three months in Drăstăr (Silistra) by the Mongol allies of Michael VIII. In the interval a Byzantine force besieged the Bulgarian capital, Tarnovo, and, hearing a rumor of Ivaylo's death in battle, the local nobility surrendered and accepted Ivan Asen III as emperor in 1279 and Irene became the new empress consort of Bulgaria.
Although the ex-tsarina Maria Kantakouzene and her son were sent to exile in Byzantium, Ivan Asen III and Irene failed to assert themmselves throughout the country. Byzantine authors say that the tsar and the tsarina did not feel comfortable living in the palace where they had been surrounded by еnemies. Ivaylo reappeared before the walls of the capital and defeated two Byzantine attempts to relieve Ivan Asen III. In 1280, Ivan Asen and Irene secretly fled Tarnovo with choice treasures taken from the palace treasury, including pieces captured from defeated Byzantine emperors in former victories. Reaching Mesembria (Nesebar), the imperial couple sailed for Constantinople, where the enraged Michael VIII refused to receive them for days for their cowardice.
George Pachymeres reports that in 1305 Irene Palaiologina attempted to arrange a mutiny against her brother Andronikos II Palaiologos in revenge for the assassination of her son-in-law Roger de Flor. The plot was uncovered and Irene was placed under house arrest.
Family.
By her marriage with Ivan Asen, Irene Palaiologina had several children:
They became the progenitors of the large and influential family Asan (or Asanes) in the Byzantine Empire, which prospered in various court and provincial offices until the end of the empire and its dependencies in the mid-15th century. One of Eirene's descendants, Irene Asanina (daughter of her son Andronikos Asan) married the future Byzantine Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos and through their daughter Helena (who married emperor John V Palaiologos), became the ancestress of later Byzantine emperors.

Hugh Cruttwell

Hugh Cruttwell (31 October 1918 – 24 August 2002) was an influential teacher of drama and principal of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts.
Biography.
Hugh Percival Cruttwell was born in Singapore, but lived in England from the age of eight. He was educated at King's School, Bruton, in Somerset, and studied History at Hertford College, Oxford. He began his career as an assistant stage manager at the Theatre Royal, Windsor. He soon became an associate director and over a period of three years directed sixty plays. While working at Theatre Royal, he first met his future wife, actress Geraldine McKeown (who later took the stage name Geraldine McEwan). The couple married in 1953, and had two children. Their son, Greg is an actor, screenwriter, director, and film producer.
After leaving Windsor, Cruttwell enjoyed much success as a freelance director. Following a spell teaching at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, he was approached to take over the principalship of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, following the resignation of John Fernald in 1965. He was heavily involved in the activities of Renaissance Theatre Company and Renaissance Films; companies established by David Parfitt and Kenneth Branagh. He was a production/creative consultant of Branagh's films of "Henry V", "Much Ado About Nothing", "Dead Again", "Peter's Friends" and "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein". He adapted, from a short story by Chekhov, the Academy Award winning short film "Swan Song", starring Sir John Gielgud. 
Influence.
In his eighteen years as principal of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, Cruttwell spotted, nurtured and polished generations of actors who have gone on to become household names. In paying homage to his former teacher and associate, Kenneth Branagh wrote:

.442 Webley

The .442 Webley (also known as the ".442 Revolver Centre Fire" in Great Britain, the "10.5x17mmR" or ".442 "Kurz"" in Europe, and ".44 Webley" or ".442 R.I.C." in the United States) is a British centrefire revolver cartridge.
Introduced in 1868, the .442 (11.2mm) Webley round was used in the Webley RIC revolver. This was the standard service weapon of the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC, whence the revolver's name), which were also chambered in (among others) .450 Adams and 476/.455. Lt. Col. George Custer is believed to have carried a pair of RIC revolvers (presented to him in 1869 by Lord Berkley Paget) at the Battle of the Little Bighorn.
A black powder round, the .442 originally used a 15-19 gr (0.972-1.23 g) charge behind a 200-220 gr (13-14.3 g) bullet. This loading was later joined by a smokeless variety.
At one time, the .442 Webley was a popular chambering in self-defence or "pocket" guns (so named for being designed to be carried in a pocket, what today might be a known as a snubnose or carry gun), such as the widely copied Webley British Bulldog pocket revolver. The .442 Webley should not be confused with the short, low-powered .44 Bulldog cartridge offered by American manufacturers as an optional loading for .442 Webley caliber arms. 
The cartridge was moderately effective, being roughly similar in power to the contemporary .38 S&W, .41 Colt, or .44 S&W American, and somewhat less potent than the later 7.65mm Parabellum, .38 Special or .45 ACP. As a consequence, it was not very suitable at anything but close range.
Smokeless .442 Webley loads continued to be commercially offered in the U.S. until 1940 and in the United Kingdom and Europe until the 1950s.

Impact mill

Impact Mills are screenless, high-speed beater mills for pulverising and micro-pulverising. 
Description.
The product to be processed is fed to the mill centrally via an inlet box at the top and is pre-crushed by primary beater tools when reaching the top of the rotor. The beaters also accelerate the product, moving it into the milling zone proper, at the side of the rotor. There the grinding stock fluidised in the air flow is comminuted by the grinding tools (rotor, stator). The stator is formed by a cover enclosing the rotor. The inside of this cover is provided with toothed grooves running vertical, i.e. crosswise to the sense of rotation of the rotor. The outside of the rotor is covered by numerous U-shaped sections which form a deep cassette-type structure. This geometry creates extreme air whirls in the rotor's grinding zone which induce intense secondary comminution processes due to the particles crashing into each other and due to friction and shearing forces. The final particle size can be adjusted over a wide range by changing the grinding rotor clearance, air flow and rotor speed.
In addition to (micro) pulverisation in the < 100 µm range, the Impact Mill has proven to be very reliable and efficient in removing fibers from organic substances (paper, paperboard, cellulose, etc.), grinding-coating, cryogenic grinding, combined grinding/blending and grinding/drying.

Sonoporation

Sonoporation, or "cellular sonication", is the use of sound (typically ultrasonic frequencies) for modifying the permeability of the cell plasma membrane. This technique is usually used in molecular biology and non-viral gene therapy in order to allow uptake of large molecules such as DNA into the cell, in a cell disruption process called transfection or transformation. Sonoporation employs the acoustic cavitation of microbubbles to enhance delivery of these large molecules. The bioactivity of this technique is similar to, and in some cases found superior to, electroporation. Extended exposure to low-frequency (<MHz) ultrasound has been demonstrated to result in complete cellular death (rupturing), thus cellular viability must also be accounted for when employing this technique.
Sonoporation is under active study for the introduction of foreign genes in tissue culture cells, especially mammalian cells. Sonoporation is also being studied for use in targeted Gene therapy in vivo, in a medical treatment scenario whereby a patient is given modified DNA, and an ultrasonic transducer might target this modified DNA into specific regions of the patient's body.
Equipment.
Sonoporation is performed with a dedicated sonoporator. Sonoporation may also be performed with custom-built piezoelectric transducers connected to bench-top function generators and acoustic amplifiers. Standard ultrasound medical devices may also be used in some applications.
Measurement of the acoustics used in sonoporation is listed in terms of mechanical index, which quantiﬁes the likelihood that exposure to diagnostic ultrasound will produce an adverse biological effect by a non-thermal action based on pressure.
Microbubble Agents.
Sonoporation uses microbubbles for significantly enhancing transfection, and in some cases is required for DNA uptake. These microbubble agents include Optison, manufactured by General Electric Healthcare.

John Eric Copeland

John Eric Copeland (known professionally as Eric Copeland) is a Christian and jazz music producer, arranger, songwriter, author, and keyboardist. His production company Creative Soul works with Christian and jazz artists both nationally and internationally, and is the parent company to Creative Soul Records, Creative Soul Jazz, and Masterscore Music, all based near Nashville, Tennessee. As an artist, he is noted for his unique arrangements and songwriting fusing gospel and jazz styles together.
Early life.
Eric Copeland was born in Lexington, Kentucky, in 1963. His father, David Ellis Copeland, was a band leader and trombonist. His mother, Mary Janet Bond Copeland, was a piano teacher and accomplished church organist. Eric played piano growing up, and also played trombone in the Lafayette high school marching band. His musical training came from his parents, his grandmother, a piano teacher, and various mentors through church and high school.
At age thirteen, he began writing and arranging original compositions and it became apparent that music would become a lifelong obsession.
As a teen, he began recording music and releasing his own material to friends and family. Also, he became known as "the guy with the recording equipment", and began recording friends and family from his father's basement.
After attending both the University of Kentucky and the University of Illinois at Chicago, he worked in various bands and singing groups, all the while continuing to write and record original music and arrangements. It was in Chicago when he began getting serious about jazz, working with singers and bands in that area.
Creative Soul.
In 1989, Eric moved back to his hometown and met his wife, who was running sound for a music group he was singing with. They married in 1990, and have two children. After settling down to life in Lexington, Eric began gathering equipment to release new material, and once again contributed to the music industry. Slowly, he began to build a clientele and reputation as a music producer, specifically for Christian/gospel and jazz clients.
In 1997, he released his first album "It's So Cool", on the Creative Soul Records label. That same year, the first client record was released: Tender Mercy's "Change". That began a landslide of production that continued into the 2000s and culminated in moving all production services to the Nashville, Tennessee, area. Creative Soul serves clients nationally and internationally, and its clients are regularly heard on Christian and jazz radio and in stores.
The Jazz in Me.
After 18 years of production work, Eric returned to creating his own music, releasing "The Jazz in Me" on his new label, Creative Soul Jazz. The album is a smooth mixture of gospel, R&B, Latin, and jazz styles, featuring some of the best musicians in Nashville. The national and international release will be followed up by radio and limited tour support.
For the Creative Soul.
As an author, Eric regularly writes for the noted blog "For the Creative Soul", read by thousands each month, and which has been reprinted by several national magazines and websites. Eric is preparing to release 52 of the writings in a weekly devotional book soon for both PDF online purchase and in printed form.

Little Hartley, New South Wales

Little Hartley is a village in the Blue Mountains area of New South Wales, Australia. It is located approximately 150 kilometres west of Sydney and 20 kilometres south-east of Lithgow, on the Great Western Highway. It is in the local government area of the City of Lithgow.
Description.
Little Hartley is a collection of properties in a rural setting, distributed on both sides of the Great Western Highway. The most prominent landmarks are Rosedale, on the west side of the highway, and Meads Farm on the east side. Other properties in the area include The Grange (the site of an art gallery), Sheepcombe (formerly William's Store), Ambermere (formerly the Rose Inn), Deloraine Park, Tathra, Nioka, Niangala, Glyn Ruthin, Kariba, Bimbadgen and Bimbimbi. There is a caravan park in Browns Gap Road, a sale yards on the west side of the highway, and a cemetery on the east side.
History.
The most prominent property, Rosedale, was built in 1839 for William Cummings. It was originally licensed as the Coach and Horses, but the name was later changed to Victoria Inn. In 1903 it was acquired by W.J.Berghofer, who was responsible for building Berghofer's Pass at Mount York in 1912. Berghofer renamed the building Rosenthal, but it was eventually renamed Rosedale. It is now listed with the National Trust.
Mead's Farm, about two kilometres north-west of Rosedale, dates back to a land grant of forty hectares given to Hugh Beattie in 1856. It was operated as the Kerosene Inn between 1867 and 1880, during which time it was used by the miners who worked at the shale mine in Hartley Vale. Some of its owners over the years were Louis Meads, from 1872, Captain George Stevens, and Captain Thomas Rowntree, who was an early mayor of Balmain. Like Rosedale, Meads Farm is listed with the National Trust.

World Trade Organization Dispute 160

On January 26, 1999, the European Communities (EC) and its Member States requested consultation with the United States concerning a dispute over discrepancies between the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs Agreement) and Section 110(5) of the United States Copyright Act amended by the Fairness in Music Licensing Act. The dispute was over the legality of “the playing of radio and television music in public places (such as bars, shops, restaurants etc.) without the payment of a royalty fee” (World). The disputed parties worked through the existing process of WTO Dispute Settlement. First the EC lodged a complaint against the US with the Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) and requested consultation over the dispute. Then the parties requested a panel leading to the body’s eventual formation, followed by the circulation of the panel report. The parties accepted the Panel Report without appeal and the dispute ended in arbitration over implementation of the panel’s recommendations. Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, and Switzerland acted as third parties in this dispute (World).
The Complaint.
The European Community and its Member States considered the United States in violation of international copyright law at the cost of European artists. The European Community questioned the US Copyright Act in which Section 110(5) creates two exemptions. The first, a so-called “business exemption,” allowed food, drink, and retail establishments under certain size and equipment restrictions, to display audio or visual transmissions without paying a royalty fee provided the establishments did not charge directly for the transmission and did not display the service beyond the establishment’s boundaries. The second, a “homestyle exemption,” gave the same exemption to small establishments that used only broadcasting equipment commonly found in private homes (World). The two TRIPs articles cited by the European Community disagreed with the US exemptions; stating 1) in article 13, that exceptions to copyright law would be exclusive to cases that do not “unreasonably” run contrary to the interests of the right holder and 2) in article 9(1), that members party to the TRIPs agreement would almost entirely comply with the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (TRIPS).
The Berne Convention is an international agreement that defines creative property rights across borders, which gives the copyright holder the exclusive right to control not only the broadcast of the work but also the public exhibition of it through the use of “ loudspeaker or analogous instrument”. The complainant specifically noted article 11(1) of the Berne Convention which places the right to control “any communication to the public of the performance of works” “by any means” solely in the copyright holder (Berne).
The Panel Report.
The Panel defined three principles that the US exemptions had to uniformly meet to prove valid. The panel stated that if the exceptions “(i) confined to certain special cases; (ii) [did not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work; and (iii) not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the right holder ” they would not violate the Berne Convention (Report). The Panel, noting that 45 to 73 per cent of pertinent establishments were covered by the exemption, found the “business exemption” to violate Article 13 of the TRIPs Agreement, thus inconsistent with Article 11 of the Berne Convention, and recommended that the Dispute Settlement Body require the United States to rework the law into accordance with the TRIPs Agreement. Comparatively, the “homestyle exemption,” which only affected 13-18 per cent of establishments, met the Article 13 requirements thus agreed with the Berne Convention. The DSB adopted the report on July 27, 2000 (US - Section 110(5)).
Implementation.
The parties calculated that the “business exemption” had nullified €1,219,900 per year. The United States proposed 15 months as a reasonable amount of time needed to implement the recommendations of the DSB and, after some arbitration, the DSB and EC accepted the time period. The US, however, failed to bring the law into the bounds of the TRIPs Agreement within the deadline, and the European Communities pressured the DSB to “suspend concessions.” As both the EC and the third party Australia bemoaned the United States’ slow progress, the US continually reported that its delegation was working with Congress to enact the settlement. In the end, the US failed to mobilize Congress to pass the issue before the next Congressional recess. The EC and the US reached a mutual temporary agreement on June 23, 2003 (World).

San Sebastián, Toledo

San Sebastian is one of the oldest churches of Toledo, Spain. It once was close to the former city gate called "Bab-al-Dabbagin" also known by its Spanish name as "Puerta de los Curtidores" (English translation: gate of the tanners). Archeological research shows that it was originally built as a mosque in the 10th century, sometimetimes transliterated as Adabaquín. Some time after 1085 it became the church of one of the six Toledan parishes of the Mozarabic rite. The architectural reconstruction dates from the late 12th or 13th century.
The church as it now remains shows the characteristics of the Mudéjar architectural style, with rich Arabic decorations. The tower of the church shows characteristics of the former minaret that stood in its place and is from the 15th century.

It features cover versions of Misfits songs from the band's early era, 1977 to 1983, performed in an instrumental "lounge" or "space age pop" style.
Misfits bassist/vocalist Jerry Only commented that "The Nutley Brass version of 'Die, Die My Darling' is swirling with 007 suspense like the soundtrack of an early James Bond movie. The horns seem to jet out like one of the old albums from the Tijuana Brass." Original Misfits guitarist Franché Coma remarked that ""Fiend Club Lounge" is one of the best renditions of some of the best Misfits songs ever recorded. Any true, and I mean true musician will appreciate the intricacies of the instrumentations on this CD. It takes punk music to a different level. It shows us how anything is possible if you want to make it happen. You'll think you are listening to a soundtrack from a big screen movie. A great lush theatrical feel."

Li Delun

Li Delun (1917–2001) was a Chinese conductor who devoted his life to the promotion of classical music in China. In 1946, with support from Zhou Enlai (who in 1949 became the first Prime Minister of the People's Republic of China) Li Delun took an assortment of donated musical instruments to the city of Yan'an and became the founder, instructor, and conductor of China's first professional symphony orchestra. In 1953, he went to Moscow to further his studies under the celebrated conductor Professor Nikolai Anosov. He returned to China in 1957 after graduating from the Moscow Conservatory and was made conductor of the China Central Philharmonic. During the political tumult of the late 1970s, Li bravely presented Beethoven's Fifth Symphony in a concert commemorating the 150th anniversary of Beethoven's death. The event marked China's first public performance of the piece since the 10-year long Cultural Revolution: it drew worldwide attention and signaled the reemergence of classical music in China.
In 1979, Maestro Li joined hands with American violinist Isaac Stern to perform the violin concertos of Mozart and Brahms. This historical musical collaboration was captured in the Academy Award-winning documentary From Mao to Mozart, which offered some of the first glimpses of a newly opening China. In the ensuing years, Li served as a bridge between musicians from China and abroad, performing with artists such as David Oistrakh, Isaac Stern, Yehudi Menuhin, Yo-Yo Ma, Fou Tsong, Liu Shikun, Yin Chengzong and many others. The China Central Philharmonic Society traveled the world performing under his baton, and he guest-conducted numerous international orchestras, including the Toronto Symphony Orchestra and Vancouver Symphony Orchestra in 1986 and 1989 respectively.
Maestro Li's professional and philanthropic work earned him rewards and accolades around the world. He adjudicated for the International Tchaikovsky Cello Competition in Moscow in 1990 and the Yehudi Menuhin International Competition for Young Violinists in Paris. Some of his many awards include the Liszt Medal of Decoration awarded by Hungarian government and the Presidential Friendship Medal conferred by former Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
Li believed that classical music was not rarefied art for the upper class but rather something to be enjoyed by all. He was a tireless advocate for classical music and spent his free time lecturing on the subject of music enjoyment throughout China, presenting its beauty and sophistication with a simple and humorous delivery to university students and factory workers alike, making it appealing to the younger generation as well as the general public. On October 19, 2001, Li Delun died at age 84 in a Beijing hospital, after having lived a full and meaningful life dedicated to music.

Battle of Kokavil

The Battle of Kokavil was a battle in June and July 1990 for the control of the town of Kokavil in Sri Lanka. The battle was fought between the Sri Lankan Army (SLA) and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). The battle was primarily centered on the 14-day siege of the military camp at Kokavil, which eventually fell to the Tigers.
Battle.
In early June 1990, LTTE fighters attacked SLA forces in the area of Mankulam. These initial attacks were repulsed but by June 12, both Mankulam and Kokavil were surrounded. On June 16 a ceasefire was declared so negotiations can take place. Shortly after this sixteen soldiers, from a military detachment guarding the Rupavahini Relay Station at Kokavil, left on leave leaving 69 soldiers at the camp. Soon after that, on June 27, the camp was surrounded by the LTTE. For the next 14 days the camp was constantly coming under attack. Medicine, food and water were in short supply. Supplies were dropped by helicopters. Because of heavy LTTE fire, the supplies had to be dropped from high above the camp. Much of it landed outside the perimeter of the camp and was lost. The final attack was to start on July 10, and the LTTE started building up forces around the camp. Reinforcements for the soldiers at the camp were not able to arrive because the routes were blocked. That evening the SLA soldiers were left with only 300 rounds of ammunition. By next morning some 30 soldiers were still alive, half of them seriously wounded. The SLA commanding officer, Lt. Aladeniya, was given the order to evacuate, but he refused because he did not want to leave his wounded men. On the evening of July 11, communication with the camp was lost. At 11:45 p.m. the camp was overrun. All of the soldiers were declared missing in action. Lt. Saliya Aladeniya was posthumously promoted to rank of captain and honoured with a Parama Weera Vibhushanaya medal on June 21, 1994.

Wurstsalat

Wurstsalat (German, literally "sausage salad") is a tart sausage salad prepared with vinegar, oil and onions. It is normally made from a sort of boiled sausage like lyoner, stadtwurst, regensburger or extrawurst. It is a traditional snack in southern Germany, Alsace, Switzerland and Austria.
To prepare the dish, the sausage is cut into thin slices or strips and placed, along with raw onion rings or cubes, in a vinegar and oil marinade, lightly seasoned with salt and pepper. Common additional ingredients are finely cut gherkins, radishes, parsley or chives. Wurstsalat is normally served with bread and sometimes also with fried potatoes.
Popular variants are the "Schwäbischer Wurstsalat" (Swabian wurstsalat), which is half composed of blood sausage, and especially the "Schweizer Wurstsalat" (Swiss wurstsalat), also called "Straßburger Wurstsalat" (Strasburg wurstsalat) or "Elsässer Wurstsalat" (Alsacian wurstsalat), and containing Emmental cheese.

Ethnic conflicts in the Soviet Union

There are many different ethnic groups present in Russia and the countries of the former Soviet Union today. This diversity has been the source or instigator of conflict for centuries, and remains a major part of Russian political life today. While the Russian Empire, the USSR, and the Russian Federation were each made up of a majority of ethnic Russians, the minority groups have always been present to fight for their own languages, cultures, and religions. There are many different types of ethnic conflict, and the vast majority can only be understood with the help of a historical context.
Background.
The policies of Vladimir Lenin designated autonomous republics, provinces, regions, and districts for groups of non-Russian ethnicity. One of the most prominent attempts at resistance to Soviet control was in the Turkestan region of Central Asia by a Muslim guerrilla group called the Basmachi. The Basmachi Rebellion continued from 1918 to 1924, when the Soviet armies finally crushed the revolt with a mixture of military force, concessionary policies, and elimination of the majority of the region’s tribal and nationalist leaders. The leadership of Joseph Stalin reintroduced many of the assimilation policies of the imperial period, urging loyalty to the Soviet Union only. He opposed national autonomy to the extent that he replaced the leaders of each republic with ethnic Russian members of the Communist party and regularly removed leaders of ethnic nations from power. This policy continued through to the leadership of Mikhail Gorbachev, who replaced the first secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan with an ethnic Russian. This initiated the first major instance of ethnic violence, in which riots broke out among demonstrators and ten thousand Soviet troops were deployed to quell the revolt. Other conflicts followed in the late 1980s, including the Armenian–Azerbaijani conflict over the Nagorno-Karabagh region, the Uzbek-Meskhetian Turk conflict over Uzbekistan’s Fergana Valley, and bids by numerous ethnic groups for Soviet republic status.
The Post Soviet Transition.
As the Soviet Union began to collapse, social disintegration and political instability fueled a surge in ethnic conflict. Social and economic disparities, along with ethnic differences, created an upsurge in nationalism within groups and discrimination between groups. In particular, disputes over territorial boundaries have been the source of conflict between states experiencing political transition and upheaval. Territorial conflicts can involve several different issues: the reunification of ethnic groups which have been separated, restoration of territorial rights to those who experienced forced deportation, and restoration of boundaries arbitrarily changed during the Soviet era. Territorial disputes remain significant points of controversy as minority groups consistently oppose election outcomes and seek autonomy and self-determination. In addition to territorial disputes and other structural causes of conflict, legacies from the Soviet and pre-Soviet eras, along with the suddenness of the actual sociopolitical change, have resulted in conflict throughout the region. As each group experiences dramatic economic reform and political democratization, there has been a surge in nationalism and interethnic conflict. Overall, the fifteen independent states that emerged after the collapse of the Soviet Union face problems stemming from uncertain identities, contested boundaries, apprehensive minorities, and an overbearing Russian hegemony.
Ethnic Conflict Today.
There are several stages of ethnic conflict, all of which have been present in the years following the collapse of the Soviet Union. These include claims presented in the form of declarations, introduction to and support of these claims by the masses, conflict not resulting in casualties, conflicts involving casualties, and interethnic wars. Of the total number of recorded ethnic conflicts, 40% remain in one of the first two stages, while 15% have reached the third or fourth stage. Conflicts such as the Armenia-Azerbaijan, Georgia-Ossetia, Georgia-Abkhazia, Ossetia-Ingush, and Moldova-Pridnestrovje conflicts have escalated to final stage, involving warfare. A predominance of these instances of ethnic conflict is located in the Caucasus and the Central Asian regions as a result of territorial disputes and political unrest. In addition, conflict between Russia and other former Soviet states has accounted for a large amount of present conflicts. Hostilities between Russia and groups of the North Caucasus area, such as the Chechens, are rooted deeply in historical differences, resulting in the first and second Chechen Wars. Overall, the enormous diversity of the area of the former Soviet Union, along with greater feelings of nationalism and ethnic identity, have led to an increase in ethnic tension and discrimination that remain a large part of social and political relations both among and within each state. Some minor territorial conflicts occur minimally in current times; but has not escalated to a level of concern.

Medicine Butte

Medicine Butte is a mountain located in Uinta County, approximately north of the city of Evanston, Wyoming. It is in elevation and can be reached via an access road. The mountain houses radio towers serving numerous local and regional services.
The mountain is named as such by Native Americans because of the great variety of herbs and roots that they used for medicine which were found on the slopes of the butte. The mountain is sometimes known as “Fremont’s Monument” for John C. Fremont.
Radio use.
Radio towers for several different communications systems exist on the summit of the mountain. Most notable of these are two higher power FM radio stations, and numerous translators serving the local area.
The following is a complete list of radio stations with transmitters located on the mountain, sorted by frequency.
As well as housing towers and transmitters for radio stations, the mountain also has towers for amateur radio operations. It is owned by a resident from Manila, Utah and transmits on 146.680 MHz. Another amateur radio repeater nearby, transmits on 147.02 MHz. It is known as K70GM. Local companies and telecommunications services also carry towers on the mountain. Emergency systems for Evanston and Uinta County also broadcast from towers on Medicine Butte. Daggett County, Utah also has services transmitting from the mountain. The United States Forest Service owns a tower on the mountain.
KNYN.
KNYN is the highest power radio station transmitting on the mountain. In 2005, the station suffered a partial tower collapse and has been running on lower power (and a backup transmitter) since. The cause of the collapse was apparently weather related, as the area had experienced heavy icing.
Television.
Medicine Butte is commonly used to receive television signals from the Salt Lake City market, and relay them into rural parts of Wyoming and Idaho. The following is an incomplete list of television stations broadcasting from Medicine Butte to the surrounding area.
Access.
Medicine Butte can be accessed via Red Willow Road, north of Evanston on US Highway 89. The road is used locally for the landfill of Evanston, but branches off to the left to climb the summit. The road is not in good condition in most places, and a four wheel drive vehicle is recommended.

Customer insight

Customer Insight is the intersection between the interests of the consumer and features of the brand. Its main purpose is to understand why the consumer cares for the brand as well as their underlying mindsets, moods, motivation, desires, aspirations, and motivates that trigger their attitude and actions. 
Another definition of consumer insight is the collection, deployment and interpretation of information that allows a business to acquire, develop and retain their customers.
Analysis.
Firstly, the collected data must be audited to fully understand the quality and opportunity within the database. Once this is done, there are a number of different types of analysis that can be applied.
Impact Assessment will help a business to understand how actions taken by the business affected their customer behavior, and also allow for some predictions of customer reaction to proposed changes.
Customers as Assets measures the lifetime value of the customer base and allows businesses to measure several factors such as the cost of acquisition and the rate of churn.
Propensity Modelling predicts the future behaviour of customers based on previous actions and helps businesses understand how likely it is that a customer will behave in a given way.
Cross-Sell Analysis identifies product and service relationships to better understand which are the most popular product combinations. Any identified relationships can then be used to cross-sell and up-sell in the future.
Critical Lag allows a business to deliver specific customer communications based on the individuals purchase patterns, helping to increase loyalty and improve customer retention.
Customer Insight in Practice.
Customer Insight provided the basis for success for the Marks and Spencer (M&S) lunchtogo service. Using the Critical Lag strategy (outlined above), the company analyzed each customers' ordering behavior, mainly focusing on the frequency and time lapse between each lunchtogo purchase. Through statistical reasoning, EWA (the company hired by M&S to handle their Customer Insight) developed a critical lag formula, which helped M&S to judge when a customer’s current lag since they placed their last order, fell outside of their statistically expected behavior and heightened their risk of lapsing.
If a customer fell outside of this lag, M&S communicated with them via email or over the phone to find out the reason for this behaviour and therefore reducing the number of lapsed customers.

Taisun

Taisun (; Taishan is the name of the biggest mountain of the Shandong province) is the world's strongest crane and has a safe working load of 20,000 metric tons (22,046 short tons). Taisun is designed and built for the installation of very large modules in semi submersibles and FPSO projects and located at Yantai Raffles Shipyard in Yantai, Shandong Province, China. The crane holds the three heaviest lifts of all time: 20,133 metric ton, 17,100 ton and 14,000 ton. 
Concept.
Taisun was built to install very large (up to 20,000 ton) integrated modules on top of a vessel's hull. Traditionally, offshore vessels such as drilling semi submersibles or FPSOs were built from the ground up in modules of 1000 to 2000 tons, which meant that much installation, hook up and commissioning work was left to be done on board where access is limited and efficiency lower. Taisun facilitates simultaneous construction of the lower and upper parts of the vessel which allows for a shorter overall project schedule, manpower improvements of up to two million man-hours while safety and quality levels are improved
Awards.
Guinness World Record
Taisun holds the world record for "heaviest weight lifted by crane", set in Yantai on April 18, 2008 and set at 20,133 metric tonnes (44,385,667.25 lb) by lifting a barge, ballasted with water.
Spotlight on New Technology
Also during OTC 2008, Taisun received the Spotlight on New Technology Award for improving safety, speed and efficiency during construction of offshore production vessels. In order to win the award, Taisun met four technology criteria: the technology must be less than two years old and must not be in violation of any known patents, the technology must be proven through full-scale application or successful prototype testing, the technology must have broad appeal for the industry at large and the technology must offer substantial benefits over current technologies.
Woelfel Best Mechanical Engineering Achievement 2008
During the Offshore Technology Conference (OTC) 2008, Taisun received the Woelfel Best Mechanical Engineering Achievement Award from American Society of Mechanical Engineers. This award recognizes technologies which are novel; have a significant impact on the offshore industry; meet health, safety, and environmental standards; and are well conceptualized and developed.

<doc id="20497716" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20497716" title="Temporary protected status">
Temporary protected status

Temporary protected status (also called "TPS") is a temporary immigration status to the United States, granted to eligible nationals of designated countries. 
In 1990, as part of the Immigration Act of 1990 ("IMMACT"), P.L. 101-649, Congress established a procedure by which the Attorney General may provide TPS to immigrants in the United States who are temporarily unable to safely return to their home country because of ongoing armed conflict, an environmental disaster, or other extraordinary and temporary conditions. 
On March 1, 2003, pursuant to the Homeland Security Act of 2002, Public Law 107-296, authority to designate a country (or part thereof) for TPS, and to extend and terminate TPS designations, was transferred from the Attorney General to the Secretary of Homeland Security. At the same time, responsibility for administering the TPS program was transferred from the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), a component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
During the period for which a country has been designated for TPS, TPS beneficiaries may remain in the United States and may obtain work authorization. However, TPS does not lead to permanent resident status (green card). When the Secretary terminates a TPS designation, beneficiaries revert to the same immigration status they maintained before TPS (unless that status had since expired or been terminated) or to any other status they may have acquired while registered for TPS. Accordingly, if an immigrant did not have lawful status prior to receiving TPS and did not obtain any other lawful status during the TPS designation, the immigrant reverts to unlawful status upon the termination of that TPS designation. TPS is not granted to persons that try to register after the first registration period ends, so if a person of a country that is currently under TPS did not register the first time TPS was assigned, then that person does not qualify for TPS.
Deferred Enforced Departure is an immigration status similar to TPS, and is currently active for Liberia. Liberians previously were able to hold TPS status.
Background.
Who Qualifies for TPS.
An immigrant who is a national of a country (or immigrant having no nationality who last habitually resided in that country) designated for TPS is eligible to apply for TPS benefits if he or she:
An immigrant is not eligible for TPS if he or she:
Late initial registration is available for those who did not apply during the initial registration period of a country's TPS designation. In addition to meeting all of the other requirements for TPS in his or her own right (residence, physical presence, etc.), a late initial registrant must establish eligibility to file late by showing that one or more of the late initial filing conditions existed during the initial registration period and also within 60 days of filing the late initial TPS application. Children and spouses of TPS-eligible individuals cannot derive continuous residence or continuous physical presence from their parents or spouses for late initial filings.
TPS and Employment Authorization.
TPS applicants are eligible to receive an Employment Authorization Document (EAD/card) based on TPS only if they have a pending or approved initial Form I-821 (Application for Temporary Protected Status). Category C19 appears on EADs issued while the initial Form I-821 is pending approval or denial; therefore, receiving a C19 EAD does not mean that an applicant has been granted TPS. Category A12 appears on EADs issued after the initial Form I-821 has been approved.
Denial or Withdrawal of TPS.
Applicants are not eligible to file a re-registration TPS application if their initial Form I-821 has been denied or if USCIS has withdrawn its approval of TPS status. However, if TPS has been denied or withdrawn, it is possible to file another initial Form I-821. USCIS will treat the new initial Form I-821 as a late initial registration application. The full initial application fees must be paid for all multiple initial Form I-821s, and in Part 1 of the new initial Form I-821, Box A must be selected. If USCIS approves a subsequent initial Form I-821, the applicant's TPS status will be established or restored and she or he may thereafter file re-registration applications. Alternatively, an applicant whose TPS has been denied or withdrawn may follow the instructions provided in the Notice of Denial or Withdrawal for appealing or filing a Form I-290B (Notice of Appeal or Motion).

Norinco NHM 91

The NHM-91 is a semi-automatic civilian development of the Russian Kalashnikov AKM and RPK infantry small arm built by Norinco of China and marketed in the U.S. by China Sports Inc. of Ontario, California (CSI Ont, CA).
Background.
A civilian semi-auto variant of the Russian AKM (Chinese Type 56) rifle, the NHM-91 was built to imitate the appearance of the Russian RPK light machine gun. First imported and marketed in the United States in 1991 by ChinaSports Inc., the NHM-91 was modified to meet the requirements of a 1989 Executive Order by President George H. W. Bush prohibiting importation of certain 'assault rifle' configurations of military-style semi-automatic rifles such as the Norinco AKM/AK-47. These modifications included a one-piece U.S.-made thumbhole stock to replace the separate Chinese-made buttstock and pistol grip of the original AKM/RPK rifle, the deletion of the bayonet lug and muzzle brake, and the inclusion of a rivet on the receiver preventing use of standard AK-47, RPK, or AKM magazines.
Features.
Based on the Russian RPK light machine gun, the NHM features a stronger receiver and a longer, thicker-profile chrome-lined barrel measuring 20 inches (508mm) compared to the 590 mm (23.2 in) of the original RPK, along with a forward-mounted steel bipod. The NHM-91 was equipped from the factory with two 30-round magazines and a 75-round Chinese drum magazine.
Like the RPK, the NHM-91 utilizes a heavier-gauge stamped sheet metal receiver built from 1.5mm-thick stamped sheet metal instead of the 1mm thickness typical of a Soviet or Chinese-made AKM, resulting in increased rigidity, heavier weight, and improved overall accuracy. The longer, heavier barrel reduces shot dispersion and gives the NHM-91 a longer sight radius, again resulting in improved accuracy over the typical semi-auto AKM. Trigger pull weight is also lighter than other AK designs, and some users report the rifle capable of 2-2.5 minutes of angle accuracy or better with factory 7.62x39mm ammunition.
Stocks on the NHM-91 are of a one-piece thumbhole design with integral pistol grip, and are thicker and longer than the standard AKM/AK-47 buttstock. Made by E.C. Bishop or Boyd and constructed from birch wood or hackberry, the NHM-91 buttstock lacks a separate pistol grip, though the rifle may be retrofitted with a separate buttstock by simply cutting off the lower portion of the stock and grip with a band saw, then fitting a new pistol grip. Like its RPK counterpart, the NHM-91 does not come equipped from the factory with a bayonet lug. However, the front of the barrel is threaded and capped off with a thread protector welded onto the threads. By removing the thread protector, a muzzle brake can be fitted.
Factory NHM-91 rifles were manufactured with a rivet in the magazine release button, preventing use of some Soviet or German-made AKM or AK-47 magazines. Instead, special magazines with a modified tang were manufactured by Norinco for the NHM-91. Since the sunset of the 1994 Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act, removal of the rivet in the magazine release allows use of any and all AKM, RPK, or AK-47 magazines.

<doc id="20497918" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20497918" title="Shrinkage estimator">
Shrinkage estimator

In statistics, a shrinkage estimator is an estimator that, either explicitly or implicitly, incorporates the effects of shrinkage. In loose terms this means that a naïve or raw estimate is improved by combining it with other information. The term relates to the notion that the improved estimate is made closer to the value supplied by the 'other information' than the raw estimate. In this sense, shrinkage is used to regularize ill-posed inference problems.
Examples.
One general result is that many standard estimators can be improved, in terms of mean squared error (MSE), by shrinking them towards zero (or any other fixed constant value). Assume that the expected value of the raw estimate is not zero and consider other estimators obtained by multiplying the raw estimate by a certain parameter. A value for this parameter can be specified as that minimising the MSE of the new estimate. For this value of the parameter, the new estimate will have a smaller MSE than the raw one. Thus it has been improved. An effect here may be to convert an unbiased raw estimate to an improved biased one.
A well-known example arises in the estimation of the population variance by sample variance. For a sample size of "n", the use of a divisor "n" − 1 in the usual formula (Bessel's correction) gives an unbiased estimator, while other divisors have lower MSE, at the expense of bias. The optimal choice of divisor (weighting of shrinkage) depends on the excess kurtosis of the population, as discussed at mean squared error: variance, but one can always do better (in terms of MSE) than the unbiased estimator; for the normal distribution a divisor of "n" + 1 gives one which has the minimum mean square error.
Background.
Shrinkage is implicit in Bayesian inference and penalized likelihood inference, and explicit in James–Stein-type inference. In contrast, simple types of maximum-likelihood and least-squares estimation procedures do not include shrinkage effects, although they can be used within shrinkage estimation schemes.
Applications.
Copas.
The use of shrinkage estimators in the context of regression analysis, where there may be a large number of explanatory variables, has been described by Copas. Here the values of the estimated regression coefficients are shrunken towards zero with the effect of reducing the mean square error of predicted values from the model when applied to new data. A later paper by Copas applies shrinkage in a context where the problem is to predict a binary response on the basis of binary explanatory variables.
Hausser and Strimmer.
Hausser and Strimmer "develop a James-Stein-type shrinkage estimator, resulting in a procedure that is highly efficient statistically as well as computationally. Despite its simplicity, ...it outperforms eight other entropy estimation procedures across a diverse range of sampling scenarios and data-generating models, even in cases of severe undersampling. ...method is fully analytic and hence computationally inexpensive. Moreover, ...procedure simultaneously provides estimates of the entropy and of the cell frequencies. ...The proposed shrinkage estimators of entropy and mutual information, as well as all other investigated entropy estimators, have been implemented in R (R Development Core Team, 2008).

FACT (computer language)

FACT was an early computer programming language, created by the Datamatic Division of Minneapolis Honeywell for its model 800 series business computers in 1959. FACT was an acronym for "Fully Automated Compiling Technique". It was an influence on the design of the COBOL programming language.
Some of the design of FACT was based on the linguistic project "Basic English", developed about 1925 by C.K. Ogden.
The software was actually designed by Computer Sciences Corporation (Fletcher Jones, Roy Nutt, and Robert L. Patrick) under contract to Richard Clippinger of Honeywell.
Contributions to COBOL.
FACT was an influence in the design of COBOL, and is one of 3 predecessor languages credited in all COBOL manuals.
Several elements of FACT were incorporated into COBOL:
Implementations.
It is unclear if a working version of FACT was ever released by Honeywell. The language was designed, and a detailed specification released (see references), but it said that "Computer Sciences Corporation also has the contract to implement FACT", which seems to imply that they are still working on an implementation. About that time, the short range committee began developing COBOL, and Roy Nutt, 1 of the 3 principals of CSC began working with that committee on COBOL. It's not clear if he ever came back to implement FACT, or if Honeywell concentrated their programming effort on a COBOL compiler.
FACT was implemented however - it was being used by Australian Department of Defence in the 1960s and early 1970s.
Sample Program.
The following code samples from the simple payroll application in the FACT specification show the fixed-form nature of FACT and its similarities with COBOL.

Near Ballymore is the old cemetery of Templerobin where once stood an ancient church, one of three which may have been built on the island as early as the 9th century. According to "Great Island Tours", a book published by the local library, Templerobin is mentioned in records dated 1302 and 1652 but by 1774 it was reported as being in ruins.
Ballymore has a small Roman Catholic Church and is served by the school of the adjoining twin village of Walterstown, the two being townlands which jointly make up the village of Ballymore. The area is strongly associated with the Barry family, a powerful Norman era family which is still represented in the area today. 
The area has a strong sporting tradition and is home of Ballymore Athletic which is where the world renowned local athlete and 1995 World Athletics Championship gold medalist in the 5,000m race Sonia O'Sullivan trained from an early age. There is also a local cycling club and the area hosts an annual cycle race. 
There is a single public house in the village, known as the Hi Chapperal. There was previously a Post Office in Ballymore but this has now been downgraded to a postal agency.

2008 Formula Palmer Audi season

Championship.
The 2008 Henderson Formula Palmer Audi Championship was incredibly competitive, with seven winners through the season and a three-way championship battle going into the final round.
Jason Moore eventually emerged from Croft as champion, but he was under intense pressure through much of the season from Tom Bradshaw and Jolyon Palmer. Moore made the best start to the season, winning three of the opening five races, with Richard Plant picking up a win in Round Two and Tom Bradshaw winning at Brands Hatch in Round Five.
Moore continued his winning ways in a triple-header at Spa-Francorchamps, although Jolyon Palmer scored an excellent victory in Round Six. Jack Clarke also visited the top of the podium in Round 10 at Oulton Park.
The second half of the season, however, belonged to Tom Bradshaw as he picked up four race wins, including a historic treble at Snetterton, to ensure the title went down to the wire. Elsewhere Richard Keen made a superb albeit brief appearance in the championship, gaining two victories and one pole in three races.
In 2008, the Henderson Formula Palmer Audi Championship once again enjoyed strong grids and a strong race calendar, with 33 drivers in total entering the 8-race, 20-round format. This year the championship also enjoyed a race abroad, at Spa-Francorchamps. The championship continued to support large international events at Brands Hatch such as A1 Grand Prix, the World Touring Car Championship and DTM.

Marc Limbert (born 3 October 1973, Mancot) is a Welsh football midfielder, currently with Welsh side Bangor City.
Limbert began his career as a trainee with Everton, but was released without making the first team. He joined Chester City, where he was to gain experience in The Football League by playing 14 league games in the 1992–93 season.
On leaving Chester a year later he joined Connah's Quay Nomads and played for Altrincham, leaving to join Colwyn Bay in July 1997. He subsequently had a brief spell with TNS before joining Rhyl in May 2003, having played on dual terms for Rhyl at the latter end of the previous season.
He re-joined Connah's Quay Nomads in 2006 but stayed for just the one season, following manager Neville Powell to Bangor City in June 2007. He was immediately made by captain at Farrar Road, and lifted the Welsh Cup in May 2008, scoring a penalty in extra-time in a 4-2 win against Llanelli AFC at Newtown's Latham Park. He captained the team in their 10-0 aggregate loss against Danish team FC Midtjylland in the UEFA Cup Preliminary First Round.

Get Up on the Dance Floor/Headz Up

Get Up on the Dance Floor/Headz Up is the debut double A-side single of street dancer George Sampson who won the 2008 edition of "Britain's Got Talent". It was released on 24 November 2008 and all proceeds were donated to Great Ormond Street Hospital.
Production.
Simon Cowell initially planned to only release dance videos with Sampson, but after seeing fan responses to Sampson, he wanted to do more. Eventually a video was choreographed by street-dance and Cirque du Soleil star Mukhtar Omar Sharif Mukhtar. Simon Cowell then asked the agent of Take That if he could get Sampson to sing, but it turned out he already liked singing from a young age.
Reception.
The opinion of reviewers was mixed. Music editor Nick Levine from Digital Spy gave the single a 3-star review. He cited the numerous samples in "Get Up On The Dancefloor" and called it "an entertaining piece of pop nonsense". He was less impressed by "Headz up" but summarized the songs by saying "Both, whatever their limitations, are more interesting than anything on Leon Jackson's album." CBBC Newsround also gave the single a 3-star review mostly because they considered the songs 'catchy', but they criticized the lyrics' credibility and the fact that Sampson's was hard to hear because of other vocals. Popjustice listed both positive and negative aspects of the single side by side in their review, but was positive saying "George Sampson might have made one of the year's most extraordinary pop singles". Andy Welch from the Monmouthshire Beacon didn't like the single at all. He said "it has no merit of any kind. Britain has got talent, just not here." John Murphy from musicOMH reviewed the track "Get Up on the Dance Floor" and said "It's utterly disposable and completely unoriginal, but there is a sense of fun to it which may well appeal to anyone under about 16 years of age."
Sales and charts.
It debuted and peaked at number 30 on the UK Singles Chart

Talcamávida is a town in the commune of Hualqui in the Biobío Region of Chile. It is located on the north bank of the Bio Bio River across from Santa Juana on the opposite shore. It occupied a plain along the river 42 kilometers from the Pacific Ocean that is part of a small valley surrounded by to the north by a high wooded mountainous area. It is 40 kilometers from Yumbel, to the east northeast, 24 km from Hualqui and 47 km from Concepcion to the north.
To the north of Talcamávida was the Quilacoya River and riachuelo of Millahue, in whose valleys and mountains Pedro de Valdivia forced the people of the Moluche rehue of Quilacoya to work in the rich gold mines there. His successor García Hurtado de Mendoza was the first that established a small fort there in 1560. It was destroyed more than once by the neighboring natives, and was rebuilt under the government of Pedro Porter Casanate. It was not settled until the time of the governor Manuel de Amat y Juniet, who rebuilt the fort again and populated it as the town of "San Rafael de Talcamávida", in 1756. 
In 1821 it was burned by the same royalist force that set fire to Santa Juana. In 1872 it became a rail station on the line between Concepcion and San Rosendo.

Members of the Australian Senate, 1947–1950

This is a list of members of the Australian Senate from 1947 to 1950. Half of its members were elected at the 21 August 1943 election and had terms starting on 1 July 1944 and finishing on 30 June 1947; the other half were elected at the 28 September 1946 election and had terms starting on 1 July 1947 and finishing on 30 June 1953.
All senators elected at the 1943 election and 15 of the 18 elected (representing all states except Queensland) represented the Australian Labor Party, leading to the strongest single party domination in any Australian Senate. The plurality-at-large voting system used before the 1949 election meant that the winning party (or coalition) ticket usually took all seats in each state.

Germain-Robin

Germain-Robin, based in Ukiah, California, is a maker of brandy.
History.
The distillery was founded in 1982 by Ansley J. Coale, a local rancher, and Hubert Germain-Robin, a native of Cognac, France.
Coale, a former Berkeley professor of ancient history, had bought of farmland outside of Ukiah, named Eagle Ridge Ranch, in 1973. By chance, one day in 1981 he picked up Germain-Robin, who was hitchhiking throughout California in search of a location to make brandy. Germain-Robin came from a family that had been making cognac under the name Jules Robin & Company, but had recently sold the business to Martell, prompting Germain-Robin to leave.
Ronald Reagan was an aficionado of Germain-Robin brandies and reserved a number of barrels for the White House, which he served as a matter of national pride to visiting dignitaries such as Mikhail Gorbachev and François Mitterrand. The brandy was also served at Bill Clinton's inaugural ball
One innovation is that in Cognac, brandy is made mostly of the Ugni blanc grape (known in Italy as Trebbiano), which in the region makes a juice unsuitable for drinking as a wine. By contrast Germain-Robin used, and continues to use, high-quality wine grapes. Initially it used locally produced Pinot noir, and it continues to use exclusively Mendocino County grapes, generally Colombard and Semillon, as well as some Zinfandel and Viognier. Another innovation is that rather than blending the wine, Germain-Robin produces single-varietal and single-vineyard brandies.
In 2006 Germain-Robin left the company that bears his name to become an independent consultant
Products.
Germain-Robin brandy, which is called by some the best in the world, is produced in very small quantities, 3,000 cases per year as of 2005. Sales are low due to poor name recognition, high price of up to $350 per bottle, and the tendency of restaurant patrons to buy well-known mass-market brands from France.
Particularly in recent years, the distillery has been experimenting with grappa, eau de vie, liqueur, and other liquors.
Coale is also a participant in Hangar One Vodka, an artisan vodka made in Alameda, California by St. George Spirits.

Raymond Ray-Jones

Raymond Ray-Jones (31 August 1886 in Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire - 26 February 1942 in Carbis Bay near St Ives, Cornwall) was an English painter and etcher.
Life and career.
Born Raymond Jones, he was the eldest son and second child of Samuel Shepley Jones, a cabinet maker, and his wife Martha Hulme.
Leaving St Ann’s school in Ashton at the age of fourteen, Ray-Jones worked first at the National Gas & Oil Co. Ltd., and studied part-time at Ashton's Heginbottom School of Art under J.H. Cronshaw. He showed enough talent to gain a county scholarship and a place at the Royal College of Art in Kensington, London in 1907 – a considerable achievement in those days. At the R.C.A. he studied under Prof Gerald Moira and Sir Frank Short RA, P.R.E., and from May 1911 attended the studio of Jean-Paul Laurens, known as Académie Julian, in Paris, where he was awarded the Grand Prix and Medal for portrait painting. 
In 1913, on the advice of his tutors, he changed his name to Raymond Ray-Jones, and by 1914 established a studio at Joubert Studios, 14 Jubilee Place, London SW3, off the King's Road. He became an Associate of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers on 17 March 1914 (now the Royal Society of Painter-Printmakers). Ray-Jones served during the First World War (1914–18) as a clerk or ostler in the Royal Horse Artillery at Woolwich. This was followed by a period of penury in Jubilee Place. 
Through Frank Short, his talent came to the notice of Edward Holroyd Pearce (later Lord Pearce), who was then an undergraduate at Oxford University. 
Ray-Jones was an early member of the Society of Graphic Art (now the Society of Graphic Fine Art). He married Pearce’s sister, Effie Irene Pearce, on 12 February 1926, and they lived at Woodham Walter in Essex. in 1926 he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers. 
Ray-Jones was an etcher and a meticulous draughtsman. Buildings were his main subject, though he also did portraiture and worked in chalk, oil, and watercolour. The demand for etchings that had been good, began to collapse at about the time of his marriage. Ray-Jones had little sympathy with the work of modern artists such as Picasso. Ray-Jones was so concerned with detail and accuracy that his body of work was small. 
After the birth of Alan in 1931, Ray-Jones and his wife moved to Carbis Bay outside St Ives in Cornwall, where they had two more children – Philip in 1933 and in 1941 Anthony (Tony Ray-Jones), who was later to become well known as a professional photographer. 
He was a member of the St Ives Society of Artists from 1935–1937, together with artists such as Stanley Spencer, Laura Knight and Frank Brangwyn. "Creating a Splash", which records the society at that time, includes a full page reproduction of the self-portrait. 
The outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 cut him off from the two countries – France and Italy – that had been the main source of inspiration for his etchings and paintings. This enforced separation, combined with financial worries, led to depression, and he committed suicide at Carbis Bay in 1942. 
He was buried in the old churchyard at Lelant Church on 2 March 1942. 
According to the memorial to him on the Tameside website he is best known for his self-portrait ‘The Velvet Hat’, which he etched probably c.1910. When exhibited at ‘Modern Masters of Etching’ at the Leicester Galeries in London in 1923 it received great critical acclaim. 
So far as is known, no complete catalogue exists of his etchings, paintings, and drawings, but they come on to the market occasionally, and are highly sought.
Exhibitions and Museums.
Works by Raymond Ray-Jones have been acquired by the British Museum; the Victoria and Albert Museum, South Kensington; Trinity College, Cambridge; Ashmolean Museum, Oxford; Contemporary Art Soc.; City Art Gallery, Manchester; Mappin Art Gallery, Sheffield; Ipswich Art Gallery, etc.
Prints of the self-portrait are held by the National Portrait Gallery, the British Museum, and the Victoria and Albert Museum. 
He exhibited at the Royal Academy, the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers, the Society of Graphic Art; New English Art Club, Bristol, Liverpool etc.; and at International and other exhibitions abroad: – in Paris, Venice, Hamburg, Dresden, Zurich, Geneva, Toronto, Sydney, Dunedin etc.
British Council: Contemporary British Prints and Drawings from the Wakefield Collection.
More recently, a retrospective exhibition was held at the Astley Cheetham Art Gallery from 2 May – 3 June 1992. Later still, from 19 February – 27 March 1996, a 'father and son' exhibition was held there for Raymond and Tony Ray-Jones.

The Fort Early and Jubal Early Monument was started in the early 1900s, and consists of the remains of an American Civil War fort and monument located on a site at Lynchburg, Virginia. Confederate forces under the command of Lt. Gen. Jubal Early constructed the roughly square earthen fort in June 1864 as part of the outer defenses of Lynchburg as the Union Army of West Virginia, under Maj. Gen. David Hunter, advanced from the north and west in an attempt to capture the city during the Battle of Lynchburg. It is the only section of the Lynchburg defenses still in existence.
The walls of the fort are approximately 12 to in height on the exterior and approximately 4 to high on the interior. Within the fort is a one-story brick structure that was built in 1922 by the Fort Hill Woman's Club and contains exhibits on the Battle of Lynchburg. A brick paved entrance drive with a high iron arch erected in 1924, with the words "Fort Early", cut through the eastern portion of the breastworks and forms the entrance to the site. The remaining portions of the breastworks are intact including a sally port in the northern wall used to bring in ammunition and other supplies during the military operation of the fort. A high granite obelisk honoring Confederate General Jubal A. Early and erected in 1919, is located on a triangle of land formed by the intersection of Fort Avenue and Memorial Avenue.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.

<doc id="20498318" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20498318" title="Battle of Metz">
Battle of Metz

The Battle of Metz was a three-month battle fought between the United States Army and the German Army during World War II. It took place at the city of Metz following the Allied breakout after the Normandy landings. The attack on the city by the U.S. Third Army faced heavy resistance from the defending German forces, and resulted in heavy casualties for both sides. The heavily fortified city of Metz was captured by U.S. forces before the end of November 1944, and the battle ended in victory for the U.S. following the surrender of the remaining German forces.
Background.
Metz is a heavily fortified city, located between the rivers Moselle and Seille. The fortifications of Metz consist of several forts and observation posts with connecting entrenchments and tunnels. The city had fallen to the German forces when France was defeated in 1940. Following the fall of France, the city was immediately annexed to the Third Reich. Most of the Nazi dignitaries assumed it was obvious that Metz, where so many German army officers were born, was a German city. At that time, the Wehrmacht did not consider it an important location and the city's defenses were reduced with many guns and equipment removed.
However, as the Allied forces advanced rapidly into German-held territory following the Normandy landings, Metz became an important location for the German command to organize its defenses and attempt to contain the Allied advance. By the end of August 1944, German forces in Lorraine had managed to reestablish a defensive line and the U.S. Third Army had come to a halt in face of the German defenses, resulting in a brief pause of operations in this area of the western front. According to an order issued by Hitler in March 1944, fortress commanders were ordered to allow their forts to be surrounded if necessary and hold them, surrendering only on the approval of the Führer. Metz was required to follow this order by early September, since the U.S. Third Army led by General George S. Patton had reached Verdun and was posing a threat to the Sarre region of Germany. The German command intended to obtain more time for the strengthening of the West Wall through this strategy. The defense was undertaken by the German First Army, commanded by General Otto von Knobelsdorff. The number of German troops positioned in the vicinity of Metz was equivalent to four and a half divisions.
Battle.
Armoured cavalry elements of the United States XX Corps, while on a reconnaissance operation in the direction of the Moselle, made contact with elements from the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division on 6 September 1944. On 18 September, Panzer elements made contact with U.S. reconnaissance units again. The U.S. forces had not expected the German forces to be in the area, and had to bring together their units that were spread out. Several small scale attacks were made by the U.S. forces after this encounter.
The first U.S. attack was launched by the 5th Infantry Division, in which they attempted to capture a bridgehead to the north of Metz. This attack was repelled by the German forces, as was another attack on the city that followed. In another attack, the US forces captured a small bridgehead across the Moselle to the south of Metz. 
By the end of September, German forces positioned to the north were relocated in the southern area of Metz. A number of troops were also withdrawn from Metz. Following this new development, the XII Corps launched another attack but was countered by the German defenders. In the following two weeks, the U.S. forces limited themselves to small scale attacks and patrolling in the Metz area. During this time, the XX Corps underwent a training program, experimenting with methods of reducing the defenses of the fortress. By this time, the U.S. command had decided to attack Metz from its rear, coming from the east.
On November 3, a new attack was launched by the U.S. forces, which resulted in the capture of the outer defenses with the aid of the tactics developed during the training process. On November 14, Generalleutnant Heinrich Kittel was appointed as the new commander of the German forces. By 17 November, U.S. forces had managed to isolate most of the forts, and were attacking the city. They entered the city of Metz on November 18, and on November 21, Kittel was wounded and subsequently captured by U.S. forces. Although the city was captured by U.S. forces and hostilities formally ceased on November 22, the remaining isolated forts continued to hold out. German forces had been retreating since November 17, and U.S. forces pursued them for the following two days.
Aftermath.
Direct assault was forbidden against the holdout forts in order to preserve artillery ammunition for the XX Corps' advance to the Sarre River. However, the isolated forts subsequently surrendered one by one following the surrender of Fort Verdun on November 26. By the end of November, several forts were still holding out. The last of the forts at Metz to surrender was Fort Jeanne d'Arc, which surrendered on December 13.
Although the battle resulted in defeat for the German forces, it served the intended purpose of the German command of halting the advance of the U.S. Third Army for three months, enabling retreating German forces to make an organized withdrawal to the Sarre river and to organize their defenses.

Night Piece

"Night Piece" is a science fiction short story by Poul Anderson. It was first published in the July 1961 issue of "The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction".
Plot summary.
The story takes place over the span of a few hours during one night. The unnamed protagonist, a scientist working on extra-sensory perception, leaves work and walks toward home. He is haunted by perceptions of another world, and creatures in it, who appear to be malevolent. Through flashbacks, it is revealed that he has accidentally uncovered evidence of a different and superior class of beings, which he calls "Superiors", who co-exist with humans but had previously gone almost undetected. He interprets his visions as reflections of an ongoing struggle in Superior's world and finds himself both attracted, and repelled, by what he sees.
Commentary.
In "The Worlds of Science Fiction", the author wrote
It's quite unlike anything else I've done...I have no pretensions to being a Kafka or a Capek, but it did seem to me it would be interesting to use, or attempt to use, some of their techniques.

The Secret of the Storm Country

The Secret of the Storm Country was a 1917 American silent drama film directed by Charles Miller and starring Norma Talmadge (whose company also produced the film). The film is described as not a direct sequel but a "continuation" of the 1914 film "Tess of the Storm Country", starring Mary Pickford. The film is now considered lost.
Plot.
Tess Skinner is the daughter of an indigent squatter. She falls in love with wealthy Frederick Graves. They soon marry, but they have to keep it secret as Frederick's parents would never approve. His parents later force him to marry heiress Madelene Waldersticker. Too afraid to tell them he already has a spouse, he acquiesces to his mother's wishes. Tess conceals his crime of bigamy and meanwhile is pregnant. She is thrown out of church when she refuses to tell who the betrayer is. The middle-aged admirer Mr. Young offers her protection against the townspeople. She has no intention on marrying him, until Frederick dies several years later.
Critical reception.
By the time of its release, the movie became a great success. "The New York Times" reported Talmadge delivered one of her finest and most realistic characterizations as the benighted Tess. Variety wrote Talmadge gives the part a touch of realness that carries its own appeal, and never seems to "spread" herself for solo effects, but rather works toward the collective benefits.

Alexander Constantine Ionides

Alexander Constantine Ionides ( or Κωνσταντίνος Ιωάννου "Ioannou" or Κωνσταντίνος Ιπλιξής "Ipliksis"; 1 September 1810 – 10 November 1890) was a British art patron and collector, of Greek ancestry.
Life.
Alexander Constantine Iplixes was born in Turkey on 1 September 1810, at Istanbul. His parents were Constantine Ioannes "Iplik(t)sis" Ioannou/Ionides (1775–1852) and his wife Mariora Ioannou-Sentoukakis (1784–1857). His father set up a London branch for his trading firm in c.1815. In 1827 Alexander came to London, finishing his education at Brixton.
He married Euterpe Sgouta (1816–1892) in Constantinople, before settling in Cheetham Hill, Manchester. They would have five children.
He then founded his own textile and wheat trading-firm, Ionides and Company (he changed his surname from Ipliktzis to Ionides at this time), operating between London and the Near East and the Balkans.
He soon began to patronise the arts around 1829, both in Britain (where his protégés included Edward Calvert and George Frederic Watts, who became his friends) and in Greece (where he followed his father as a patron of the University of Athens).
In 1834 Ionides and his family moved to London, where they lived at 9 Finsbury Circus from 1834 to 1839). In 1837 he became a naturalised British citizen. Afterwards they moved to Tulse Hill (1838–64) and finally to 1 Holland Park (1864 onwards), during which time began to gather an artistic salon at his home. Acting as Greek consul-general in 1854–66, he held directorships of the Crystal Palace (1855) and of many banks. His son Alexander introduced him in 1860 to artists whom he had met in Paris, such as James Abbott McNeill Whistler, Edward Poynter, Thomas Armstrong, and George Du Maurier; later Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Edward Burne-Jones also joined Ionides's circle. He commissioned the designers Philip Webb and Thomas Jeckyll to redecorate 1 Holland Park. In 1875 he finally moved to a house called "Windycroft" in Hastings, leaving Alexander to complete the Aesthetic redecoration at 1 Holland Park by commissioning William Morris and Walter Crane).

Yip Pin Xiu

Yip Pin Xiu (), born 10 January 1991) is a Singaporean backstroke swimmer. She has muscular dystrophy and competes in the S3 category for the physically impaired. Since 2005, she has won medals in international competitions such as the World Wheelchair and Amputee Games, Japan Paralympic Swimming Championships and International German Paralympic Swimming Championships. At the 2008 Summer Paralympics, she won a gold medal in the 50 metres backstroke and a silver medal in the 50 metres freestyle, setting world records in both events. Hence she was conferred a state medal, the Meritorious Service Medal. Her achievements contributed to public debate about the treatment and recognition of disabled athletes in Singapore.
Early years and personal life.
Yip was born with muscular dystrophy, a genetic disorder that slowly breaks down the muscles, and a nerve condition that affects eyesight. When she was five, she started swimming to improve her health and strengthen her muscles; nevertheless, by the age of eleven, she had lost her ability to walk and had to use a wheelchair. The youngest of three children in her family, she studied in Ai Tong Primary School and Bendemeer Secondary School, then graduated from Republic Polytechnic as back-up valedictorian and, as of 2012, is studying social science at Singapore Management University.
Swimming career.
Yip started swimming competitively when she was twelve years old. After losing her ability to kick, Yip switched from the front crawl to the backstroke and was reclassified from the S5 to the S3 category (lower numbers indicate more severe disabilities). Her coach is former Singaporean Olympic swimmer Ang Peng Siong, while fellow Paralympic swimmer Theresa Goh is her close friend and role model. Besides competitive swimming, Yip has participated in events to raise awareness of disabled sports, such as the Interschool Swimming Meets and Montfort Secondary School Track and Field Meet 2007.
After successes in national championships, Yip participated in the Asia Paralympics Swimming Championship 2005, winning two gold medals. Her first international competition was the World Wheelchair and Amputee Games 2005, where she won two gold medals and a bronze. She then received four gold medals at the DSE Long Course Swimming Championships in 2006. In 2007, she won three gold medals at the Japan Paralympic Swimming Championships and four gold medals at the World Wheelchair and Amputee Games.
At the 4th ASEAN ParaGames, Yip finished first in the women's 150 metres individual medley, clocking 4 minutes 56.34 seconds. She set a world record time of 1 minute 00.80 seconds in the 50 metres backstroke at the US Paralympic swimming trials. The 22nd International German Paralympic Swimming Championships saw her set a world record of 2 minutes 10.09 seconds in the 100 metres backstroke heats; in the finals, she was awarded the gold medal with a time of 2 minutes 08.09 seconds, bettering her own world record.
Yip started her 2008 Summer Paralympic Games campaign by breaking another world record, clocking 57.04 seconds in the women's 50 metres freestyle heats. However, she was narrowly beaten by Mexican swimmer Patricia Valle in the finals, clinching a silver medal with a time of 57.43 seconds. In the women's 50 metres backstroke heats, she posted a time of 57.92 seconds, taking two seconds off her own world record. She then swam the women's 50 metres backstroke finals in a time of 58.75 seconds to win the gold medal. After she returned to Singapore, the president conferred Yip a state medal, the "Meritorious Service Medal".
The success of Yip and Laurentia Tan, who won two bronze medals in equestrian events, sparked public debate about the treatment and recognition of disabled athletes in Singapore. Letters to "The Straits Times" criticised the poor coverage of the Paralympics. Many Singaporeans also commented about the disparity of the cash awards handed out by the government: S$1,000,000 for an Olympic gold and S$100,000 for a Paralympic gold. When the issues were raised in Parliament, MCYS parliamentary secretary Teo Ser Luck promised to study plans to give disabled athletes greater support and to include them in sporting programmes such as Project 0812, a training programme for top Singaporean sportspeople. Two months later, the cash rewards for Paralympic medals were doubled and funding for the Singapore National Paralympic Council was increased.

Kafr Lam

Kafr Lam () was a Palestinian Arab village located 26 kilometres (16 mi) south of Haifa on the Mediterranean coast. The name of the village was shared with that of an Islamic fort constructed there early on in the period of Arab Caliphate rule (638-1099 CE) in Palestine. To the Crusaders, both the fort and the village, which they controlled for some time in the 13th century, were known as Cafarlet.
Kafr Lam was depopulated during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. While the village was largely destroyed, some of its former structures and their ruins can be seen in the Israeli moshav of HaBonim, established on the lands of Kafr Lam in 1949.
History.
According to the Arab geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi, the town of Kafr Lam was established near Qisarya by the Umayyad caliph Hisham ibn ´Abd al-Malik (A.D. 724-743). The fort, constructed in the "castra" form, was erected during early Abbasid, or late Umayyad rule to guard against invasion from the Byzantine empire.
Kfar Lam was a fiefdom of the lord of Caesarea during the Crusader era in Palestine, and was known at this time as Cafarlet. In October 1213, the lord of Caesarea, Aymar de Lairon, pledged the "casalia" of Cafarlet and two fiefdoms as surety for a debt of 1,000 besants he had taken from the Hospitallers. In 1232, the Casal of Cafarlet was sold to the Hospitallers for 16,000 Saracen besants, its increased value due to its having been fortified after a raid on the lordship of Caesarea by troops from Damascus in 1227. The Hospitallers transferred ownership over Carfalet to the Templars in 1255. The village was captured by Muslim forces in 1265, but retaken by the Crusaders shortly thereafter. In 1291, it was taken by the Mamluks, who ruled over it from that time until the expansion of the Ottoman Empire into Palestine in the early sixteenth century.
During early Ottoman rule in Palestine, in 1596, a farm in Kafr Lam paid taxes to the ruling authorities. Descriptions of Kfar Lam under later Ottoman rule are available in the writings of European travellers to the region. For example, Mary Rogers, the sister of the British vice-consul in Haifa, visited the Kafr Lam in 1856 and wrote that its houses were built of mud and stone and that the fields around the village abounded in Indian wheat, millet, sesame, tobacco, and orchards. French explorer Victor Guérin visited in 1870, and noted that Kafr Lam was situated on top of a small hill and was inhabited by about 300 villagers. He said that the village stood within a large stone enclosure that dated to the time of the Crusades.
In modern times, the houses of Kafr Lam were made of stone and either mud or cement and were clustered together. The villagers were Muslims, and maintained a mosque. A boys elementary school was built in 1882, but it was closed during the period of the British Mandate in Palestine. There were five wells on village lands. The village economy depended on animal husbandry and agriculture and the main crops cultivated were various sorts of grain. In 1944-45, a total of were allotted to cereals, while were irrigated or used for orchards.
1948 Arab-Israeli war and aftermath.
Kafr Lam was evacuated early in May 1948, but by mid-May some of the villagers had returned. On 15 May 1948, the first day of the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, troops from the Carmeli Brigade occupied Kafr Lam and neighbouring Sarafand, and briefly garrisoned the two villages. Both villages were re-occupied and cleared of their inhabitants by mid-July 1948. This operation involved the first use of support fire from Israeli naval forces, with two warships participating in the attack, aiming light-weapons fire at Kafr Lam and Sarafand.
After the start of the Second Truce, on 19 July 1948, units of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) units continued to destroy Palestinian villages in various parts of the country. However, special interest groups, such as archaeologists, began to complain, calling for curbs on IDF destructiveness. Thus, on 7 October, Haifa District HQ ordered the 123rd Battalion to stop all demolition activities in "Qisarya, Atlit, Kafr Lam and Tiberias"; all of which contained Roman or Crusader era ruins.
After the depopulation of Kafr Lam, the moshav of HaBonim and Ein Ayala were established on Kafr Lam's village lands in 1949. The abandoned fortress and several houses are still standing. One house, that of Ahmad Bey Khalil, has been converted into a school, while another is being used as an Israeli post office.
Demographics.
The population (includes Kafr Lam Station) was 215 in 1931. In 1944/45 the population was 340.

Nelson Antonio Denis

Nelson Antonio Denis was a New York State Assembly representative for the 68th district from January 1, 1997 to January 1, 2001. He represented East Harlem, otherwise known as "El Barrio" and Spanish Harlem, within the Assembly. 
Denis was also the editorial director of El Diario La Prensa, the largest Spanish-language newspaper in New York City, and the oldest Spanish-language daily in the United States.
Early life.
Born and raised in New York City, Denis graduated from Harvard College and Yale Law School. He was an attorney with the New York firm of Donovan, Leisure, Newton & Irvine.
Journalism and writing.
For several years, Denis was the editorial director of El Diario La Prensa, the largest Spanish-language newspaper in New York City. While writing for "El Diario", Denis published over 300 editorials and received the "Best Editorial Writing" award from the National Association of Hispanic Journalists. 
In addition, Denis published feature articles, book and film reviews, and editorials in the Harvard Political Review, Daily News, New York Newsday, and The New York Sun.
Denis is a cultural and political commentator on WNYC, Radio WADO, and other radio outlets. 
His screenplays have won awards from the New York State Council on the Arts (NYSCA) and the New York Foundation for the Arts (NYFA). His fiction has been anthologized and re-published in the New York press.
Advocacy.
Before and during his years as a State Assemblyman, Denis conducted a neighborhood legal clinic which provided advocacy, advice, and free legal services to the residents of East Harlem.
In 1995, as deputy director of Yucahu Inc., an East Harlem community group, Denis opposed the merger of Chemical Bank and Chase Manhattan due to inadequate service to the community.
With over 800 vacant and abandoned buildings in his district, Denis advocated for economic development funds and construction financing, to rebuild the decaying infrastructure of East Harlem.
Public Life.
Denis majored in government at Harvard, and was involved in New York State government for fourteen years. He was a member of the East Harlem Community Board (C.B. 11), the Area Policy Board, and the director of strategic planning for the Harlem Community Development Corporation. 
In 1996 he won a seat in the New York State Assembly, where he served as a Democrat from 1997 to 2001, and developed a reputation as a reformer. He was also a New York State Democratic District Leader from 1995 to 2001.
His campaigns were apparently labor-intensive. The press noted that his mother, Sarah Denis, worked 12-hour days on the campaign trail and that Denis was "an indefatigable campaigner, often seen throughout the neighborhood campaigning on the back of a blue bus." 
Community Reinvestment Act.
In the 1990s, Denis' East Harlem district contained over 800 vacant and abandoned buildings. For this reason infrastructure investment, both public and private, were a top priority.
Through his use of Community Reinvestment Act legislation, public hearings, CRA testimony throughout New York State, and advocacy on the Assembly Banking Committee, Denis persuaded banks to double their lending to home owners and small business persons in East Harlem, the Bronx, and other distressed areas throughout New York State.
Denis cemented these gains by invoking the 1975 Federal Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), and conducting a census tract study of CRA compliance in the 68th Assembly District of East Harlem, and other underserved communities. In recognition of this work, Denis was repeatedly endorsed by The New York Times.
Latin Kings controversy.
In 1994, Denis entered into a controversial relationship with the Almighty Latin King and Queen Nation. While jogging along the FDR Drive, he ran into a group of 500 Latin Kings, and recruited them into his campaign for the State Assembly. Denis and the Latin Kings cleaned up several parks in East Harlem, and attended community board meetings together.
Denis also pledged that, if he won, he would help the Latin Kings to create a community non-profit corporation, a leadership training course, and a construction apprenticeship program to rehabilitate roughly 800 abandoned buildings in East Harlem. Denis maintained that "the Kings are the product of 20 years of neglect...these are the youth that Reagan forgot," but others did not agree. His opponent, the incumbent Assemblyman Angelo Del Toro, said "they're gangsters and a threat."
Another early skeptic was Denis's own mother, Sarah Denis. She laid down rules that included no beepers or babies in the office, but she gradually learned to work with them. 
Despite this controversy, the New York Times endorsed Denis for the State Assembly that year.
Film "Vote For Me!".
Prior to serving in the New York State Assembly, Denis directed TV commercials and several short films, and wrote eight screenplays. He also wrote and directed the feature film Vote For Me! which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival. It also won the Best Picture Award at the 2009 Staten Island Film Festival, and a Best Feature Film Award at the 2009 Orlando Hispanic Film Festival.
Starring Malik Yoba (New York Undercover, Soul Food, Cool Runnings); Chi Chi Salazar (Scarface (1983 film), Carlito's Way); Ricardo Barber (The Feast of the Goat); "Vote For Me!" was a comedy about a 75-year old Puerto Rican super who runs for U.S. Congress. The film was based on Denis's own experiences in East Harlem. Many East Harlem residents, musicians, and even local politicians appeared in the film, which "blurred the line between reality and fiction to capture the spectacle of New York City politics." 
"Vote For Me!" screened in over a dozen film festivals in New York and Puerto Rico, and was well received by the press. 
The New York Times declared it "reminiscent of Spike Lee's "Do the Right Thing", but with a lighter touch." 
The Boston Globe found it "ebullient...politically charged...mixes quirkiness and cultural poignancy." 
The Daily News called it "a media sensation." 
"Vote For Me!" also received national coverage from Fox News Channel, National Public Radio, Univision, Telemundo, WSKQ FM, MEGA FM, WADO-AM, WNYC, VIVA Magazine, El Diario La Prensa, El Nuevo Dia, Siempre, Hoy, and other news outlets.

Alexandr Onishenko

Alexandr Onishenko is an artist based in Prague, CZ. Well known for his vibrant impressionist paintings, his work is exhibited throughout Europe and the United States.
Life and career.
Alexandr Onishenko was born in 1957 in Chernihiv (also referred to as Chernigov, Ukrainian) the capital of the Ukrainian province of Chernihiv Oblast. His artistic studies were encouraged and supported from an early age by his father. In 1979, he graduated from the Institute of Art in Kiev and became a member of the Russian Art Union.
State regulation of the arts under the Soviet Union encouraged Onishenko and many other young artists to rebel and form an illegal artists’ collective, which was housed in the Yeletsky Monastery.
In 1981, Onishenko and several companions moved to the Tevriz district of the Omsk Provence in Siberia. After six years of “self-exile”, he returned to the Ukraine in 1987. Fleeing the increasing political turmoil in the years just before the fall of the Soviet Union, Onishenko moved to Yugoslavia briefly before settling in Prague, Czech Republic in 1991.
After years of painting on the famous Charles Bridge, Onishenko met with such success that he opened his own gallery in 1994 (Galerie Jakubska) in Prague’s Old Town.
Onishenko presently resides in Prague and has become one the city's most accomplished artists receiving both the Franz Kafka Prize and the Masaryk Academy of Sciences Award.
Artwork.
The signatures style of Alexandr Onishenko's Impressionism work includes exclusive use of the palette knife and painting on black canvases. The artist's description of his own work as "New Impressionism" is not to be confused with the pointillism of Neo-Impressionism. Its own distinction lies in the use of a traditional impasto painting technique wherein paint is applied in heavy, textured quantity and sometimes even mixed directly on the surface of the canvas, while at the same time Onishenko departs dramatically from traditional Impressionism by beginning on a pitch-black surface. This reversal of the painting process - moving from darkness to light - brings with it the high level of contrast and vibrancy of color that the artist's paintings are known for. 
Alexandr Onishenko portrays a wide variety of subjects in his work. Still Lives, nudes, land and city-scapes are all well represented in his porfolio, but over the years one of his most famous motifs has remained his bird's-eye perspective paintings of the rooftops of Prague. He is very well traveled and continues to be inspired in his work even years after visiting a new location.

Jim Connolly (illustrator)

Jim Connolly (born 1978) is an illustrator, designer and commercial artist from Sheffield, England. He is best known for creating comic book style designs for album/single covers, concert posters, magazine articles and silkscreen prints. His style features loud and brash bubblegum colours and comical characters usually drawn with a sharp vectorized look. The dominant features of his work usually include comic book, science fiction and horror references, often with a UK slant. Beyond his comic book style work he has also worked in a variety of different styles as an illustrator and designer, mainly on outsourced E-Learning games for the BBC and Channel 4 via several E-Learning companies.
Early work.
Connolly studied illustration and animation at Manchester Metropolitan University under the tuition of illustrator Ian Whadcock. During his time in Manchester he first began creating and contributing to many underground comics and fanzines. This early work later evolved into the creation of concert posters and album/single artwork for several bands.
Concert posters and album artwork.
Having seen Connolly's designs for the Ape Drape Escape, The Barbs commissioned him to work on two singles and an album cover. Their single 'Massive Crush' reached #1 in the Philippines music chart in late 2004. In September 2004 Big Cheese Magazine (in issue 55) featured an article about the relationship between the Barb's music and Jim Connolly's artwork.
Relaxed Muscle, a side-project of Jarvis Cocker, Richard Hawley and Jason Buckle, used a Connolly-penned depiction of the band on the digital content on their album A Heavy Night With... This can be seen alongside the band's quirky music videos.
Connolly's love of punk rock led him also to design posters for appearances by The Buzzcocks, The Damned, The Misfits and Zombina and the Skeletones. Swampy bluesmith Mr David Viner also received the poster treatment on a visit to Sheffield University Students Union. This led to other commissions from Sheffield University Students Union including the consistent logo design for their annual 'Band Comp'.
In 2006 Jim Bob re-worked a gig poster designed by Connolly into the cover of a 'best of' solo album Best of Jim Bob.
Editorial illustration.
Exposed Magazine commissioned several designs primarily as profile pictures for their reviewers and then for their film column, where they have used Connolly mainly to visualise the latest comic book film adaptions. Sandman Magazine has also recently used Connolly's work in articles featuring Madchester icon Clint Boon and all-female Manchester punk band Hotpants Romance.
Art prints.
In 2008, The Archipelago Press Company released a silkscreen print by Connolly satorising the destruction of Sheffield's iconic Tinsley cooling towers. In Jim's version of events the towers are destroyed dramatically by UFOs and onlookers are seen fleeing for their lives.
The popularity of the original print led to the release of a Henderson's Relish inspired print titled 'Use the Sauce' in November 2008, again via The Archipelago Press Company which has stated that a further 4 prints (6 in total) will be produced continuing the Sheffield/comic book satirical theme.
In April 2009 a third print was released entitled 'Bargains of the Damned', which features a mock zombie film poster with a parody of South Yorkshire mall Meadowhall shopping centre as the focus. The film Dawn of the Dead is stated as a key influence on the image.
An exhibition will be held (in an as-yet unknown venue) in Sheffield sometime in late 2009 when the series is completed.
Future work.
Alongside future art prints Connolly is also collaborating with graphic novelist Anjan Sarkar on a comic project titled 'Moronoid'. Previously the two have collaborated on single covers for the Ape Drape Escape.
Music and writing.
Connolly is an original member of the alternative band the Ape Drape Escape and played drums on their debut E.P. 'The Fracture Clinic', which received four 'K's from Kerrang magazine (from reviewer Camilla Pia) on October 25, 2003. He left the band but continues to make music with the comedy punk band the Friends of Batman, in which he is a co-singer/songwriter. They have been labelled 'ramshackle' by Sandman Magazine for their unrehearsed and drunken performances.
Jim is also an occasional magazine article writer and comic book enthusiast. He managed to combine the two by interviewing influential comic artist (and fellow Sheffielder) Paul Grist in July 2008.

St Ia's Church, St Ives

St Ia, St. Ives Parish Church, St Ives is a parish church in the Church of England located in St Ives, Cornwall. It is dedicated to Saint Ia of Cornwall, a 5th- or 6th-century Irish saint.
History and description.
The church is dedicated to Saint Ia the Virgin, also known as Ives, supposedly an Irish holy woman of the 5th or 6th century. The current building dates to the reign of King Henry V of England. It became a parish church in 1826. It was built between 1410 and 1434 as a chapel of ease: St Ives being within the parish of Lelant. The tower is of granite and of four stages (over 80 ft high): the church is large but not particularly high and built in a Devonian rather than a Cornish style. An outer south aisle was added by the Trenwith family about 1500: this is now the Lady Chapel and contains a statue by Barbara Hepworth.
The font is of granite and probably of the 15th century. It is carved with four angels hold ing shields. There are bench ends of the standard design and also two complete benches in the chancel. There is a brass to a member of the Trenwith family, 1463, and a monument to the Hitchens family by Garland & Fieldwick, 1815.
Organ.
The church has a pipe organ dating from 1831. It has been restored by Telford and Telford in 1859 and by Hele & Co in 1907, and more recently by Lance Foy in 1993. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.
Churchyard.
There is a late medieval lantern cross ten and a half feet high on an octagonal shaft.

Historia Regum

The Historia Regum ("History of the Kings") is a historical compilation attributed to Symeon of Durham, which presents material going from the death of Bede until 1129. It survives only in one manuscript compiled in Yorkshire in the mid-to-late 12th century, though the material is earlier. It is an often-used source for medieval English and Northumbrian history.
Sources.
It is a "historical compilation" or a "historical collection" rather than a chronicle or anything else. Antonia Gransden and David Rollason list its sources as follows:
Much of the compiled material up until 887, i.e. the first five sections, was itself probably derived from an earlier compilation by Byrhtferth of Ramsey, and probably some of it was compiled before the end of the 10th century. The material covering 1119—1129 does appear to be original, and this part may have been authored by Symeon.
Provenance.
The text survives in one manuscript, Corpus Christi College Cambridge, MS 139, folios 51v-129v, written down in the late 12th century. Even though this manuscript names Symeon as the author in an incipit and an explicit, Symeon's authorship of the work is nevertheless doubted or thought to be spurious by modern historians. Besides not being an original historical work, reasons of internal evidence make it highly unlikely that the "Historia Regum" was written by the same author as the "Libellus de Exordio", and the latter is thought by its latest editor to have been authored by Symeon.

Agnese del Maino

Agnese del Maino (c. 1401 – 13 December 1465) was a Milanese noblewoman and the mistress of Filippo Maria Visconti, the last legitimate Duke of Milan of the Visconti dynasty. Agnese was the mother of Bianca Maria Visconti, who succeeded to the title of Duchess of Milan in 1450, despite her illegitimacy.
Family.
Agnese was born around 1401 in Milan. She was the daughter of Ambrogio del Maino, a Count Palantine and ducal "questore" or chief of police. Her mother's name and identity is unknown. Agnese had two brothers, Lancillotto del Maino and Andreotto del Maino, who were both courtiers and members of the ducal council. She became the mistress of Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of Milan, the last Duke of Milan of the Visconti dynasty, whose wife Beatrice Lascaris di Tenda had been executed for adultery in 1418 and had produced no children. He was the son of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, Duke of Milan by his second wife, Caterina Visconti. Blonde-haired Agnese was the only person the reclusive Duke ever truly loved.
Birth of a daughter.
On 31 March 1425 at Settimo Pavese, Agnese gave birth to Filippo's daughter, whom they named Bianca Maria. When the baby was six months, Agnese and Bianca Maria were sent to the castle of Abbiategrasso, where lavish apartments were provided for mother and child. In 1426, Agnese bore the Duke a second daughter, Caterina Maria, but the child died shortly after her birth. Filippo, for reasons of state, married secondly, by proxy on 2 December 1427, and in person on 24 September 1428, Marie of Savoy (January 1411 – 22 February 1479), the daughter of Amadeus VIII of Savoy and Marie of Burgundy. The duke's second marriage was also childless, making Bianca Maria his sole heir to the duchy of Milan.
On 25 October 1441, Bianca Maria was married, in a magnificent ceremony at the Abbey of San Sigismondo in Cremona, to Francesco Sforza, a renowned "Condottiero" and member of the Condottieri Sforza family. Agnese was present at her daughter's wedding. The extravagant festivities, which lasted for days, offered a sumptuous banquet, a series of tournaments, a "palio", painted carts featuring allegorical scenes, and an oversized cake that reproduced the "Torrazzo", Cremona's most prominent tower. Bianca Maria's considerable dowry included the towns of Cremona and Pontremoli. The marriage produced eight children, among these were, Galeazzo Maria Sforza, Duke of Milan, Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan, Cardinal Ascanio Sforza, and Ippolita Maria Sforza, Duchess of Calabria. 
Agnese's many descendants included Caterina Sforza, Bianca Maria Sforza, Empress of the Holy Roman Empire, Gian Galeazzo Sforza, Duke of Milan, Isabella of Naples, and Bona Sforza, Queen consort of Poland. Marie de Medici, and Diana, Princess of Wales were also descendants of Agnese del Maino through the latter's great-granddaughter Caterina Sforza.
Death of Filippo Maria Visconti.
Filippo Maria Visconti died on 13 August 1447; he was not quite fifty-five years old. Bianca Maria was his only direct heir, albeit illegitimate. His death, without legitimate offspring, resulted in the creation of the short-lived Ambrosian Republic. That same year, Agnese convinced Matteo Da Bologna, the "condottiero" who held the city of Pavia, to restore the city to her son-in-law, Francesco Sforza who had inherited it upon the death of Filippo. Francesco subsequently took the title of Count of Pavia.
A revolt broke out in Milan on 24 February 1450, due to a famine in the city which resulted in rampant starvation and brought about much suffering to the populace. One month later on 25 March, after the disputed succession to the duchy was decided in their favour consequent to a meeting of nobles and leading citizens, Francesco Sforza and Bianca Maria made their triumphal entry into the city as the Duke and Duchess of Milan. The Ambrosian Republic had ended and was replaced by the Sforza dynasty which would rule Milan until 1535. Agnese resided with them at the ducal court, overseeing the education of her grandchildren. Extant diplomatic papers record that Agnese was a conspicuous participant in court functions, until her death on 13 December 1465 at the age of sixty-four years. Her daughter, Bianca Maria died three years later on 28 October 1468. Francesco had died in 1466, and his eldest son Galeazzo Maria succeeded him as Duke of Milan. 
Agnes del Maino in art and drama.
There are two contemporary paintings of Agnese which survive to this day; the artists, however, remain unknown. Agnese is a character in the 1833 tragic opera "Beatrice di Tenda" by Sicilian composer Vincenzo Bellini. The role of Agnese was played by Anna del Serre when the opera was first performed at Teatro La Fenice in Venice on 16 March 1833.

Nikolai Georgievich Garin-Mikhailovsky (Russian: Никола́й Гео́ргиевич Га́рин-Михайло́вский, –) was a Russian writer and essayist, locating engineer and railroad constructor.
Career.
As an engineer Nikolai Garin-Mikhailovsky was involved in construction of the Laspi Pass highway and the Trans-Siberian Railway. In 1891 he headed the surveying party that chose the place for building a railroad bridge over River Ob for the Trans-Siberian Railway. It was Garin-Mikhailovsky who rejected the option of raising a bridge in Tomsk. This decision later resulted in the foundation of Novosibirsk and played a vital role in development of the city. 
He came down in the history of Russian literature as the author of the story "Tyoma's Childhood" (1892) and the short story "Several Years in the Country". His travels in the Far East resulted in the travel notes "Around Korea, Manchuria and Liaodong Peninsula" (1899) and "Korean Tales" (1899). One of his stories was published in the first volume of Maxim Gorky's Znanie collections in 1904. 
His short story "Practical Training" is available in English translation in "The Salt Pit", Raduga Publishers, 1988.

N-Nitroso-N-methylurea

"N"-Nitroso-"N"-methylurea (NMU) is a highly reliable carcinogen, mutagen, and teratogen. NMU is an alkylating agent, and exhibits its toxicity by transferring its methyl group to nucleobases in nucleic acids, which can lead to AT:GC transition mutations.
NMU is the traditional precursor in the synthesis of diazomethane. However, since it is unstable at temperatures beyond 20 °C and shock-sensitive to a degree, for this purpose it has become obsolete and replaced by other ("N"-methyl)nitrosamides. Most chemical supply houses have stopped carrying it.
Acute exposure to NMU in humans can result in skin and eye irritation, headache, nausea, and vomiting. NMU is "reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen" based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals (IARC 1972, 1978, 1987). Various cancers induced in animal models include: squamous cell carcinomas of the forestomach, sarcomas and gliomas of the brain, adenocarcinomas of the pancreas, leukemia, and lymphomas. However, the actual potential for human exposure is quite limited, as the chemical is not produced or used in large quantities 
NMU is teratogenic and embryotoxic, resulting in craniofacial (cleft palate) and skeletal defects, increased fetal resorption, and fetal growth retardation. Exposure to NMU during pre-implantation, post-implantation, organogenesis, or by paternal exposure can result in these effects.

Gilberto Bosques Saldívar

Gilberto Bosques Saldívar (b. Chiautla, Puebla, 20 July 1892 – 4 July 1995) was a Mexican career diplomat and before that a combatant in the Mexican Revolution and a leftist legislator. As a consul in Marseille, Vichy France, Bosques took initiative to rescue tens of thousands of Jews and Spanish Republican exiles from being deported to Nazi Germany or Spain, but his heroism remained unknown to the world at large for some sixty years, until several years after his death at the age of 102 (not 103, as sometimes reported). For about two decades after World War II, Bosques served as Mexico's ambassador to several countries. Since 2003, international recognition has been accruing to him. In 1944, he described his efforts thus: "I followed the policy of my country, of material and moral support to the heroic defenders of the Spanish Republic, the stalwart paladins of the struggle against Hitler, Mussolini, Franco, Petain, and Laval."
Bosques has been called the "Mexican Schindler" in allusion to Oskar Schindler, the German industrialist whose rescue of several hundred Jews during World War II has been chronicled by the Australian author, Thomas Kenneally, whose account ("Schindler's Ark") was the basis for the film, "Schindler's List".
In 2010, a documentary film about him was produced in Mexico, directed by Lillian Lieberman, titled "Visa al paraíso" (Visa to Paradise).
Early years.
Gilberto Bosques Saldívar was born in Chiautla, a mountain village in southern portion of the state of Puebla, southwest of Mexico City. At the age of 17, he took up arms in the Mexican Revolution under the command of Aquiles Serdán Alatriste, the first martyr of the Revolution. Bosques organized the First National Pedagogy Congress (Primer Congreso Nacional Pedagógico), and worked as a journalist with several newspapers and publications. 
He went on to serve as a state legislator in Puebla and as a federal deputy on two occasions: 1922-1923 and again in 1934-1937. In the latter period, he belonged to a bloc of legislators supporting the new president, general Lázaro Cárdenas (from 1934 to 1940). 
In 1938, he was the director of the government owned newspaper, "El Nacional".
Mexican Consul in France during World War II.
Bosques was stationed in France from 1939–1943, coinciding with most of World War II, initially as Mexico's Consul General. Fleeing the German occupation of Paris in May 1940, Bosques was instructed by his government to organize a consulate to represent Mexico in Vichy France, which he set up in Marseilles. Once Nazi Germany had occupied France and entrusted much of the governance of the country to Vichy France, he directed consular employees to issue a visa to anybody wanting to flee to Mexico. Over time, under his auspices visas were issued to approximately 40,000 people, mostly Jews and Spaniards. The Spaniards rescued were refugees from the Francisco Franco regime after the conclusion of the Spanish Civil War on April 1939. Bosques rented a castle and a summer holiday camp in Marseilles to house refugees under the protection of what he maintained was Mexican territory under International Law. In 1943, Bosques, his family (wife and three children), and 40 consular staff members were arrested by the Gestapo and detained in Germany for a year. He was released under an agreement between the German and Mexican governments after Manuel Ávila Camacho (then President of Mexico from 1940 to 1946), imprisoned German citizens in Mexican prisons and made an exchange of prisoners.
Post-World War II.
In the decades after his release from German captivity, he served as Ambassador of Mexico in Portugal, Finland, Sweden and Cuba. In 1962, during the "Cuban Missile Crisis", Bosques — who was both a personal friend of Fidel Castro and the diplomatic representative of a neutral country trusted by the United States, the Soviet Union and Cuba, worked to facilitate communications between the disputants and bring Cuba into agreement with the "face-saving" agreements worked out between the two nuclear powers. Bosques Saldívar died just days short of his 103rd birthday. Many accounts of his heroism written since his death erroneously report his age at death as 103 years.
Bosques's feat in saving nearly 40,000 people from execution by the Nazis or the Franco dictatorship went unrecognized even among specialists in the history of rescuers of Jews until after 2000, and especially the year 2008. At an award ceremony held in Beverly Hills, California, on 13 November 2008, the United States organization, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) gave him the Courage to Care Award, created in 1987 to honor rescuers of Jews during the Holocaust Era. But this was not the first major posthumous recognition given to him. He was memorialized in Vienna on 4 June 2003 by having a street in the 22nd district named after him: the Gilberto-Bosques-Promenade. More recently, in 2007 a photographic exhibition in his honor was mounted at the Jewish and Holocaust History Museum in the Condesa neighborhood in Mexico city. In 2008 this exhibition traveled to Xalapa, Veracruz.

Special Forces Club

The Special Forces Club (SFC) is a private members club located in Knightsbridge, London. 
Foundation and Membership.
The SFC was founded in 1945 on the initiative of Major General Sir Colin Gubbins, the last Chief of the Special Operations Executive (SOE). The initial membership was drawn from surviving members of the SOE; members of Resistance organisations worldwide with which SOE had operated along with the wartime Special Air Service (SAS), Special Boat Service (SBS) and the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry (FANY). 
The club was intended by its founders to be a meeting place for both those who had served in the SOE and for members of kindred organizations. This tradition has continued, with the club maintaining a close relationship with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS); Australia, Canada and New Zealand; along with the successors of European and other Resistance organisations. 
Unlike many other clubs that were open only to men and officers, the SFC has always welcomed all ranks and men and women, reflecting the membership and spirit of the SOE.
The Club's membership is drawn primarily from the intelligence and security communities, both military and civilian, and Special Forces along with other organisations and individuals whose work reflects the ethos of the club such as high threat bomb disposal experts. Great stress is placed on the personal qualities of applicants along with their technical qualifications to ensure that the club maintains its reputation as one of the most discreet locations in London. Current membership includes a number of holders of the Victoria Cross and George Cross.
Premises.
The Club is located in Knightsbridge. From outside there are no signs marking it as the Special Forces Club. The building is not owned by the club, but is leased from Cadogan Estates.
The Club is famous for its collection of photographs of members of SOE. Those members killed in action have their photograph framed in black. These photographs have been supplemented in recent years to reflect the whole range of the club's current membership. There is also a collection of prints and original paintings reflecting the background of the membership. 
The club has undergone a radical transformation in terms of its business practices to ensure its efficient administration. The club now has a very active programme of guest speakers and events. In recent years the club has organised a major dinner celebrating the 70th Anniversary of the SOE at the Imperial War Museum along with events on HMS Belfast and Tower Bridge, all attended by the Club's Patron, The Princess Royal. Together, this has enabled the Club to refurbish its bar and dining-room and there is a rolling programme of improvements to the bedrooms. 
Additionally there is a longstanding tradition whereby overseas members support renovations. The Danes were responsible for a bedroom in memory of Ebbe Munck, who initiated the armed resistance movement in Denmark, the US created the Donovan Room in memory of William J. Donovan the wartime head of the OSS, and the Dutch renovating the Prince Bernhard Room. There are also rooms named the Australian Room, the Belgian Room, the Polish Room and the Canadian Room redecorated by members from those countries. Recently the Norwegians refurbished the Linge Room, named after the founder of the wartime Linge Company.
