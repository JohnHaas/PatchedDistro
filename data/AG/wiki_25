Bilberry Hill

Bilberry Hill is one of the Lickey Hills in northern Worcestershire, England, 10.3 miles (16.5 kilometres) south west of Birmingham and 24 miles (38.5 kilometres) north east of Worcester. It stands above and to the west of the village of Cofton Hackett, and is part of the Lickey Hills Country Park.
The three hilltops comprising The Lickeys - Bilberry Hill, Rednal Hill and Cofton Hill - form the northern extremity of the Lickey Ridge, a formation of hard quartzite. Views over Birmingham and the surrounding countryside can be seen from the top of these hills.
The hill is named after the tracts of Bilberry ("Vaccinium myrtillus") bushes that cover the hill, between the pathways. Local people have been cropping the bushes of their fruit each autumn for hundreds of years to make jams, preserves or apple and bilberry pies.
History.
In 1888 the "Birmingham Society for the Preservation of Open Spaces" purchased Rednal Hill and handed it to the City in trust. In 1913 they also arranged for Bilberry Hill and Pinfold Wood to be leased to the city on a nominal peppercorn rent in perpetuity.
Birmingham City Council finally purchased Cofton Hill, Lickey Warren and Pinfield Wood outright in 1920. With the eventual purchase of the Rose Hill Estate from the Cadbury family in 1923, free public access was finally restored to the entire hills with what would become the Lickey Hills Country Park in 1971.
The "Bilberry Hill Centre" is a hostel and sports facility run by "Birmingham Clubs for Young People" nestling at the base of Bilberry Hill, in a building that was donated to the people of Birmingam by Mr and Mrs Barrow Cadbury in 1904 as the Lickey Tea Rooms and remained in use as a restaurant until the early 1960s. The hostel can accommodate up to 65 persons. In the winter of 2008 the centre is under threat of imminent closure over funding issues and there is an internet campaign to save the facility for future use by young people.
Geology.
The Lickey Hills area is of significant geological interest due to the range and age of the rocks. The darker quartzite making up Bilberry Hill shows signs of having been deposited as sand at the bottom of a shallow sea.The stratigraphic sequence, which is the basis for the area's diversity of landscape and habitat, comprises:
The soil is marl and the subsoil gravel, sand and clay. There is a small quarry where Wenlock limestone was worked at the time of the making of the Worcester and Birmingham Canal, and there are some gravel-pits.

Aleksander Majkowski

Aleksander Majkowski (; 17 July 1876 - 10 February 1938) was a Kashubian writer, poet, journalist, editor, activist, and physician. He was the most important figure in the Kashubian movement before World War II. He was the editor of ""Gryf"" (The Griffin) and author of the greatest Kashubian novel "Żëcé i przigodë Remusa" ("The Life and Adventures of Remus"), and "The History of the Kashubs."
Early life.
Aleksander Jan Alojzy Majkowski was born into a farming family on July 17, 1876, in Kościerzyna (then Berent, West Prussia), the eldest child of two sisters and three brothers. In Kościerzyna, he completed primary school "(Volksschule)" and in 1885-90 attended a German progymnasium. He was given a scholarship of "Towarzystwo Pomocy Naukowej" (Society of Educational Aid), based in Chełmno (then Culm). In 1891, he began his education in gymnasium in Chojnice, living in a convent there. Also there, he became acquainted with Polish literature and history. In 1895, he earned his matriculation certificate. At first, he meant to study theology and become a priest, but instead he enrolled at the Berlin University and in 1897, began studying medicine. In Berlin, he became involved in social activities; for example, he gave lectures for Poles who lived there.
Early influences.
In 1898, he took part in the ceremony of the erection of Adam Mickiewicz's monument in Warsaw and was reminded of his Slavic identity. In 1899, he published his poem "Pielgrzymka Wejherowska" ("The Wejherowo Pilgrimage") and satire "Jak w Koscérznie koscelnygo obrele, abo Pięc kawalerów a jedna jedyno brutka" ("How in Kościerzyna they chose the sacristan or Five bridegrooms and only one bride").
In 1900, Majkowski moved to Greifswald (an old Slavonic town Gryfia) to continue his studies. There, intrigued by the history of the area, he got involved in the agenda of an early Polish socialist organization called Zet, and a local student society called ""Adelphia"". Because he also tried to establish his own political organization, in 1901, he was relegated from the university. Later on, he moved to Munich to continue his studies there. Aside from regular curriculum, he carried on with his earlier established cultural interests and worked for "Towarzystwo Studentów Polaków" (Society of Polish Students) and founded the “Vistula” society. In 1903, he finally completed his studies and moved to Zurich, Switzerland, where he wrote his doctoral dissertation on blood cells in plumbism. In September 1904, he defended his Medical Doctor (MD) degree and, at the end of the year, returned to Kashubia. In Gdańsk, he fulfilled his year-long medical practicum at a local hospital. With immense energy, he decided to get involved in the cultural and social activities in the area.
Professional career.
In 1905, he accepted a position of chief editor of ""Gazeta Gdańska"" ("The Gdańsk Gazette") and its supplement ""Drużba. Pismo dlö polscich Kaszubów"" ("Friendship. Magazine for Polish Kashubs"). Meanwhile in Poznań, he published a selection of his Kashubian language poems "Spiewe i frantówci" ("Songs and merry verses"). At that time, he also prepared the re-editions of Hieronim Derdowski’s poems "Jasiek z Knieji" ("Johnny from Knieja", i.e., the forest) and "Kaszubi pod Widnem" ("The Kashubs near Widno"). In 1906, he returned to his native Kościerzyna, where he opened a private practice while continuing his involvement in the cultural and social spheres, e.g. in a venture ""Dom Kaszubski"" ("The Kashubian House") and "Towarzystwo Czytelni Polskiej" (Polish Reading Room Society) that he had set up. He is also actively involved in "Towarzystwo Wyborcze" (Electional Society), "Towarzystwo Śpiewacze" (Singing Society) ""Halka"", and "Związek Młodych Kupców" (Young Merchants' Union). During this time, he cooperated with Izydor Gulgowski, Friedrich Lorentz, and the German "Verein für Kaschubische Volkskunde" (Society for Kashubian Folk Studies). While studying the folklore of the region, he did not forsake publishing in "Gazeta Gdańska".
Between 1908-12, Majkowski continued to publish in Kościerzyna and, starting in 1911 in Gdańsk, a monthly entitled ""Gryf. Pismo dla spraw kaszubskich"" ("Griffin. Magazine for the Kashubian issues"). Concurrently, he initiated other Kashubian cultural and political programs and began gathering Kashubian intelligentsia around himself. In parallel, he took part in many cultural activities that promote Kashubia. He immortalized the Black Griffin as the emblem of the Kashubians. The Kashubian Griffin became the symbol of the strength and steadfastness of the Kashubian people also in Canada.
He organized a Kashubian-Pomeranian exhibition, singlehandedly writing all of the supporting printed material for it. However, not only did he write a lot, but also he travelled extensively, taking many pictures. As a pedagogist, he remained in consistent touch with students; encouraging them to explore Kashubia; he offered himself as a tour guide. In early 1912, he finally settled in Sopot, continuing to work as a physician until 1921.
Society of Young Kashubians.
A capstone to years of efforts, in June 1912, Aleksander Majkowski managed to set up his Gdańsk-based "Towarzystwo Młodokaszubów" (The Society of Young Kashubians), established for ""the cultural, economical and political development of Kashubia"." Another member of this society was the newly ordained Roman Catholic priest Leon Heyke. In September of the following year, he instituted the "Kashubian-Pomeranian Museum" in Sopot, including the adjacent society, and wrote a guide to Kashubia called "Zdroje Raduni" ("The Radunia River's Wells"). Recognized for his accomplishments, he sadly encountered opposition from some local social activists and the Catholic Church. Fortunately, he managed to win a defamation court case posed by a catholic magazine "“Pielgrzym”" (The Pilgrim).
Wartime activities.
In August 1914, Majkowski was drafted into the Prussian Army, where he served as a physician in Poland, Romania and France. During the war, he wrote a diary, sketched for Kashubia's history, and two novels: "Pomorzanie" ("The Pomeranians", unfinished) and "Żëcé i przigodë Remusa" ("The Life and Adventures of Remus").
Return from the war.
In July 1918, he returned to Sopot, became politically active, and participated in some military activities taking place in what is now called the Trojmiasto area (Gdansk, Gdynia, Sopot). During the same year, he also become a member of "Rada Ludowa" (The People's Council). A year later, in Gdańsk, he set up "Koło Demokratyczne" (Democratic Circle), became chief editor of ""Dziennik Gdański"" ("The Gdańsk Daily"), and continued teaching at a local folk university. For his military efforts, he earned the rank of captain of the Polish Army, and was later promoted to colonel. In 1920, he sat on the board of the commission responsible for establishing the Polish-German borders and in "Rada Pomorska - Towarzystwo Ochrony Polskości na Pomorzu" (Pomeranian Council - Society for the Protection of Polish Interests in Pomerania) as its head. For the next two years, he resided in Grudziądz, though he traveled extensively throughout Poland. In Grudziądz, he met his future wife, Aleksandra Starzyńska. Also there, he organized the "Exhibition of Fine Arts," having Pomeranian artists in mind, which was officially opened on June 7, 1921, by the head of Poland, Marshall Józef Piłsudski.
In the coming years, Majkowski continued his political and cultural activities aimed at promoting Kashubia and Kashubian culture. He established a drama theater in Toruń, become a leader of "Stowarzyszenie Artystów Pomorskich" (Society of Pomeranian Artists) based in Grudziądz, and a chief editor of a magazine called ""Pomorzanin"" ("The Pomeranian") – all this between 1921 and 1923. In addition, during this time he resumed publishing ""Gryf"", and continued to write, collaborating with various periodicals and radio in Toruń. In ""Gryf"", he also published the first chapters of his book "Żëcé i przigodë Remusa".
Marriage.
On October 6, 1921, in Warsaw, Aleksander Majkowski marries Aleksandra Komorowska (former name: Starzyńska, 1891–1982). The newlywed couple settled in Kartuzy, in a villa called “Erem” (The Hermitage). They paranted four children: Damroka (1922–1979), Mestwin (1924–1944), Barbara (1928–1983) and Witosława (1929–1955). Somehow, in his free time, Majkowski managed to collect stamps and postcards, read detective stories, and go mushroom picking.
Continued business activities.
In Kartuzy, he worked as a physician in a number of places, mainly at the railroad clinics, often volunteering to help people in need, but without neglecting his writing. Attending to his patients on the country side, he kept collecting samples of folklore artifacts and photographs the life of the Kashubs. For his commitment to "social work in Pomerania", Majkowski received the Officer's Cross of the Order of Poland's Restitution, from President Stanisław Wojciechowski in April 1923. A year later, he published his "Przewodnik po Szwajcarji Kaszubskiej" ("A Guide to the so-called Kashubian Switzerland") and, in 1925, a single issue of ""Gryf"". Shortly thereafter, he endured yet another round of criticism in being accused of separatism, bolshevism, immorality, crimes, and bad influence on society at large.
Withdrawal from public affairs.
Due to recession, personal failures and health problems, Aleksander Majkowski retracted from public life and concentrated on literary work. He patronized the actions of Aleksander Labuda and Jan Trepczyk - young Kashubian activists, who in 1929 establish "Zrzeszenie Regionalne Kaszubów" (Kashubian Regional Union) in Kartuzy, with Majkowski as its head. Later, he fruitfully and with dedication collaborated with the associated magazine ""Zrzesz Kaszëbskô"" ("Kashubian Union"). Soon Majkowski also joins "Polski Związek Zachodni" (Polish Union of the West) and collaborates with Instytut Bałtycki (The Baltic Institute). For his tireless efforts, in 1930, he received "The Golden Cross of Merit", one of the most prestigious awards of the Republic of Poland.
Although a member of the board of editors of the revived ""Gryf"" since October 1931, he did not return to a full-time journalism until 1934. In October 1935, he publishes the first part of his three-part novel "Żëcé i przigodë Remusa". He was awarded "The Silver Literary Laurel" (Srebrny Wawrzyn Literacki) by "Polska Akademia Literatury" (The Polish Academy of Literature). Meanwhile, in his villa, he organized a folklore exhibition and tries to cure his fatigued health by taking repetitive trips to various spas.
1936 and 1937 were busy years for Majkowski. He worked on "Gramatyka kaszubska" ("The Kashubian Grammar", incomplete) and "Historia Kaszubów" ("The History of the Kashubs"). He put a lot of effort into his guide to Kashubia and adapted his satire "Jak w Koscérznie koscelnygo obrele..." for the theatre under a new title of ""Strachë i zrękovjinë"" ("Fears and Engagements"). All along, he wrote extensively for the press.
Death and Legacy.
A few months after Majkowski’s death, his "Historia Kaszubów" and the entire novel "Żëcé i przigodë Remusa"[http://bibliotekacyfrowa.eu/dlibra/doccontent?id=2738&from=FBC] were published. After the war, "Żëcé i przigodë Remusa" reappeared on a few occasions and in 1964, was translated into Polish by the Kashubian-Polish writer and activist, Lech Bądkowski. "Historia Kaszubów" was published with a foreword by the Kaszubian scholar Gerard Labuda. Many of Majkowski's other, less known, writings were also published or republished. For example his recollections, letters and the war diary were jointly published under a title of "Pamiętnik z wojny europejskiej roku 1914" ("The Diary from the European War of the Year 1914").
Aleksander Majkowski is regarded as the leading figure in the Kashubian movement and the founder of its historic and intellectual base. By design, he captured the Kashubian cultural ideology in the literary figure of the humble Kashubian farm laborer Remus (who is not to be confused with the Roman mythological or the American literary figure of the same name). Majkowski also worked to define Kashubian grammar and spelling, promoted protection of historical monuments and regional folklore, set up social and economical Kashubian-Pomeranian institutions, represented the Kashubes on the country's forum and the Slavonic scene. Majkowski was also a translator of German texts into Kashubian language. His multifaceted activity covered all sides of the social life of Kashubia and its impact continues to this day. In Poland, 2008 was declared the year of Aleksander Majkowski.
An English translation of "Żëcé i przigodë Remusa," by Blanche Krbechek and Katarzyna Gawlik-Luiken, was published in 2008 by the Kashubian Institute in Gdansk as "Life and Adventures of Remus." The translation "Life and Adventures of Remus" was accomplished under the aegis of the Kashubian Association of North America and can be purchased through the Kashubian Association's website.

South Bend Branch

The South Bend Branch was a Pennsylvania Railroad line that ran from South Bend, Indiana to Logansport, Indiana. The line was built in 1883 and was then a part of the Vandalia Railroad. The route was about 60 miles long and it passed through many towns.
Industries served.
The route was a very important link for Studebaker Auto since it ended at their factories in South Bend, Indiana. The line also had several grain elevators, which several are still in business. One of the reasons it was built was for people going to Lake Maxinkuckee in Culver, Indiana when it was a resort town.
Abandonment.
After Studebaker closed in 1960, rail traffic started declining and the last daily freights were gone by 1969. The first part of the line to go was between Nutwood and Culver, which was abandoned in 1973 and removed in 1974. The second piece to go was from Culver to Logansport which was abandoned in 1974 and removed in 1976. For a while in Plymouth, Indiana, they used the line for the old industrial park, but this rail was gone by 1990. Track still remains in South Bend, where it continues to be used by a couple of local businesses. However, that is all that remains of the old South Bend Branch.

Max, the 2000-Year-Old Mouse

Max, the 2000-Year-Old Mouse was a Canadian animated television series produced by Steve Krantz, which originally aired in Canada in 1967 and became popular in several parts of the world, most notably the United States, where it was syndicated on both local and PBS stations between 1970 and 1979, and also the United Kingdom, where it was repeated numerous times on the ITV network between its original transmission in 1969 and its last showing to date in 1992.
Overview.
The series was an educational show, aimed at children, in which still pictures and limited animations told the stories about important figures and key events in Western history. 104 episodes were made in total, each running at five and a half minutes in length.
The episodes were filmed quickly and cheaply, and the premise of the show was simple. An episode typically begins in a room in a museum, with artifacts on display while the unseen and unnamed narrator (Bernard Cowan) introduces the era and historical person(s) to be featured. Key figures whose biographies were explored in the series included Paul Revere, Buffalo Bill, and Daniel Boone, among many others, with Max dubiously claiming to have helped all of them over the course of his very long life.
A few years later, Krantz reused the general format (and voice cast) for the similar series "Professor Kitzel". The show's theme music was also later used by Siskel and Ebert's movie review series for PBS, "Sneak Previews".
Max.
Max, voiced by Paul Soles, is a pink mouse who lived in the museum, essentially served as comic relief and also helped with the narration, while repeatedly claiming to have been a witness of and/or participant in various historical events. Footage of Max, set in the past or present, typically shows him as comically clumsy with contemporary tools and weapons.

George Gladwin

George William E. "Willie" Gladwin (28 March 1907 – "unknown") was an English footballer. His regular position was at right half or inside forward. Born in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, he played for Worksop Town, Doncaster Rovers and Manchester United, as well as guesting for Barnsley, Wrexham, Doncaster Rovers and West Ham United during the Second World War.
Career.
Born in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, Gladwin began his football career with local Midland League club Worksop Town while also working as a bricklayer. At the end of the 1929–30 season, Doncaster Rovers were short on funds and were unable to pay summer wages to many of their players; as a result, they were only able to retain 16 players for the 1930–31 season. Gladwin was among those brought in to augment the threadbare side and soon became a regular in the team, playing in either inside forward position or at right half. In 1934–35, he was part of the Doncaster team that won the Third Division North title and they were promoted to the Second Division. The club avoided relegation in their first season in the second tier, but despite leading the league after two games in 1936–37, they were firmly rooted to the bottom of the table by the end of October and were relegated at the end of the season.
After 226 league appearances in which he scored 22 goals, Gladwin was able to escape the sinking Doncaster ship in February 1937, only to join a Manchester United team that was in similarly dire straits in the First Division for a fee of £3,000. Including his debut against Chelsea on 27 February 1937, in which he scored, Gladwin played in eight of Manchester United's last 12 matches of the season – the first four as an inside right and the next four as a right half. They still had a chance to avoid relegation in their final game against West Bromwich Albion on 24 April 1937; however, a 1–0 defeat meant that they finished in 21st place and were relegated to the Second Division, where they had spent the last five seasons. Gladwin made just seven appearances the following season, as Manchester United won promotion back to the First Division after finishing in second place, ahead of Sheffield United by virtue of a better goal average. He was more involved again in 1938–39, helping Manchester United in his 12 appearances to a 14th-place finish in the league, ensuring that the club would still be in the First Division at the outbreak of the Second World War.
During the war, Gladwin made guest appearances in the Wartime League for various clubs, including Barnsley (1939–40; two appearances), Wrexham (1940–41; one appearance), his old club Doncaster Rovers (1941–43; six appearances, one goal) and West Ham United (1941–43; seven appearances). However, he suffered severe injuries while in service, bringing his football career to an end.

Joseph Loth

Joseph Loth (December 27 1847 – 1 April 1934) was a French linguist and historian who specialised in the study of Celtic languages.
Loth was born in Guémené-sur-Scorff, Brittany. After his studies at Sainte-Anne-d'Auray, he became a teacher at Pontivy, then Quimper and Saumur until the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. After the end of the conflict, he worked in various institutions in Paris. At this time he made the acquaintance of Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville, who encouraged him to study Celtic languages. In 1883 he was appointed to the Faculty of Arts at Rennes University, where he taught Celtic. That same year he founded the journal "Annales de Bretagne", in which he published numerous studies and edited until 1910. He was appointed professor at the Collège de France in 1910 and was elected member of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in 1919.
Loth published numerous articles in the "Revue Celtique", re-edited Pierre de Chalons' Breton-French dictionary, and translated into French important Celtic literature including the Mabinogion. He was also an early supporter of the detailed study of variations in local dialects. 
Loth developed an influential model of the historical expansion of the Breton language into France. The farthest limit of spoken Breton is known as the "Loth line". It runs from Mont-Saint-Michel, through Hédé, and on to the west of Rennes to reach the Loire. 
He received an honorary doctorate (LL.D) from the University of Glasgow in June 1901.

<doc id="20221375" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20221375" title="Norton Dominator">
Norton Dominator

The Dominator is a twin cylinder motorcycle developed by Norton to compete against the Triumph Speed Twin. The original Dominator was designed in 1947 and 1948 by Bert Hopwood, who had been on the Speed Twin design team at Triumph.
This design set the pattern for Norton twins for the next 30 years.
Model 7.
The first Dominator, the Model 7, had a 497 cc parallel twin engine with iron cylinders and cylinder head and a Lucas K2F magneto. The crankshaft was of 360-degree layout. A single camshaft at the front of the engine was driven by gears and chain. The rocker box was integral with the head, so there were fewer gasket faces to leak and less valve noise. The engine was a long stroke design with bore and stroke and mild tuning, resulting in more torque low down. For the first few years a plunger frame was used, but in 1953 the Model 7 was upgraded with a single downtube swinging arm frame, 19-inch front wheel and 'pear shaped' silencers, still known as a Model 7.
The Model 7 continued in production through to 1955 and was often used with a sidecar, which could not be fitted to the later Featherbed frame Dominators.
Model 88.
The Featherbed frame was designed for Norton by the McCandless brothers and made by the Reynolds company because the Norton works did not have the necessary welding capacity for its manufacture. 
The Featherbed frame led to the Model 88 Dominator, also called the Dominator De Luxe, which used the same 497 cc engine and was developed in 1951. Originally developed for export it was sold on the home market from 1953. The 88 suffered from oil leaks from the primary chain case but it was the outdated and inefficient Norton works that resulted in quality control problems for the 200 Model 88's produced each week.
Model 99.
The 597cc featherbed framed Model 99 Dominator was introduced in 1956, as a larger capacity version alongside the 500 cc Model 88 version. Due to the increased engine capacity, the 99 had a power output of 31 bhp, partly due also to a higher compression ratio possible with the alloy head introduced a year earlier. Full width alloy hubs with improved brakes had also been introduced a year earlier, preparatory for the capacity increase from 500 cc to 600 cc
Model 77.
The first Model 77 was a rigid framed telescopic forked Dominator version of 500 cc produced from 1950, and supplied to the Australian market only. Only a few hundred were made, from 1950 to 1952. This used the all iron Dominator 500 cc twin engine, with an oil pressure gauge in the ES2 style but flat bottomed petrol tank.
The 596 cc Model 77 Dominator was introduced in late 1956. Essentially a swinging arm, single downtube ES2 chassis with a 600 cc Dominator 99 engine, it was in production at the same time as the Dominator 99 as a sidecar motorcycle but was dropped from production after 1957, when sidecar Featherbeds were introduced.
Slimline Featherbed frames for 1960.
From 1960, the featherbed frame for all Dominators was altered so that the frame tubes in front of the seat were narrower, for improved rider comfort. The seats and tanks and indeed the whole styling of the Dominator was redesigned to suit. A large metal tank badge completed the look, along with some 2 toned paint schemes. And some optional enclosed body styling on the "Deluxe" Models of the 88 and 99, along the lines of the 'bathtub' Triumph models.
1960 Manxman 650 and 1961 Dominator 650SS.
A new 650 cc model was added to the lineup late in 1960. The frame was altered so that the top rails were closer together at the front of the seat area to create what became known as the 'slimline' featherbed. A 650 cc engine was installed to create the Norton Manxman. First built from 7 November 1960 to September 1961, these machines were a Limited Edition for the USA only, in custom-cruiser style - with high handlebars, all polychromatic blue paint and bright red seat with white piping round the edge. In September 1961 the 650SS was introduced. It had USA cafe bar style and twin carburettors. The SS stood for Super Sports and the 600 cc models were discontinued to concentrate on production of the 650SS, which quickly earned a reputation as the "best of the Dommies".
Racing.
The Norton factory racing team briefly used race-tuned Dominators from circa 1960, but they were still outclassed by the Norton Manx. Doug Hele wanted to see the Dominator developed and produced a "Domiracer" that revved to 8,000 rpm. The Domiracer weighed less than the Manx. Dennis Greenfield and Fred Swift won the 500 cc class in the Thruxton 500 event in 1960. In the 1961 Isle of Man TT Tom Phillis took the bike to third place and lapped at over , a first for a pushrod engine and a first for any twin. Norton abandoned the Domiracer project a year later when the Bracebridge Street race shop closed and the Domiracer and factory spares were sold to Paul Dunstall, who continued with development and began producing Norton performance parts, eventually selling complete Norton Dunstall bikes to customers including Steve McQueen.

Old Dalby Test Track

The Old Dalby Test Track is in the United Kingdom is used for testing new designs of trains. It is between Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire and Edwalton on the course of the Midland Railway's route between Kettering and Nottingham, which closed to passengers in 1968. It is in length.
History.
The track was set up by British Rail Research Division, which had used it from May 1966. After closure as a through route, it was converted into a test track for the Advanced Passenger Train APT-E project, re-opening in September 1970. The track saw extensive use in the heyday of the Research Division and was used for pantograph development and OHLE testing.
Following privatisation of Britain's railways, the track became the property of BRB (Residuary) Ltd, the body set up to own former BR assets that were not sold off. The track was leased for one peppercorn per annum to Serco and later to Alstom and Metronet (LUL). Following the abolition of the BRBR, ownership passed to Network Rail on 30 September 2013.
Twenty-first century.
In 2001 the track was leased to Alstom Transport, which electrified the former Down line at 25kV AC OHLE to test and commission the Class 390 "Pendolino" trains for Virgin Trains on the West Coast Main Line, and re-instated six miles of the former Up line from Old Dalby to the southern portal of Stanton Tunnel to test and commission the proposed ERTMS system for NR.
When Alstom withdrew from the United Kingdom train-building market, the track was threatened with closure before being leased to Metronet in 2007 to test and commission London Underground S Stock trains being manufactured by Bombardier in Derby. To facilitate this, the former Up line was equipped with approximately of London Underground-style conductor rails from Old Dalby to a point near to Folley Hall Bridge. Testing of 'S' stock began at the end of March 2009. The former Down line retains its 25kV OHLE.
Serco was awarded the contract to manage the track on behalf of Metronet, giving it the opportunity to attract other users.
In April 2010, the track was used by Class 172 diesel multiple units, also manufactured by Bombardier in Derby.
Network Rail uses the track on an ongoing basis for calibration and testing of measurement and gauging trains.
Plans included testing the CITYFLO 650 automatic train control system for London Underground, and new mainline infrastructure such as the Series One OHLE system by Network Rail.
During mid January 2014 , Network Rail applied for changes to the original planning controls to increase train passes on the line substantially during weekdays and Saturdays citing noise testing of the new Hitachi 25kv OLE stock based on the Javelin stock on HS1 for the future electrification of the Great Western Mainline, this undoubtedly secures the future of the lines testing capabilities even further

The Castle Shannon Incline was a funicular railroad in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It was originally built in 1890 as part of the Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Railroad as a means of transporting passenger traffic over Mt. Washington, rather than using the Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Tunnel through Mt. Washington, which used a former coal mine. The mine continued to be used as a tunnel to transport coal to a separate incline that unloaded at a station on Carson Street. The incline ran from Bailey on Mt. Washington to Carson Street and Arlington. Its large cars were able to carry both passengers and automobiles. Originally steam powered, it was converted to electrical operation in 1918 by the Otis Elevator Company. 
The incline was closed 21 June 1964.

The first Croats arrived in June 1945. The majority arrived at the camp on August 15, 1945. The inhabitants formed a theatre company at the camp to perform classic Croatian dramatic works. A printing press was established by Dominik Mandić which printed magazines and books at the camp.
Most of the about 2,000 inhabitants who were living inside the camp, which was situated on the premises of a former textile factory, were of Ustaša background. In 1947 the camp was repeatedly raided by British military personnel in a search for war criminals hiding among the population.
In late 1947 and early 1948, representatives from Argentina, the United States, Canada, and Australia came to the camp to offer the inhabitants a chance to immigrate to their perspective countries. On one trip, the USS General W. M. Black (AP-135) transported 626 people from the camp to Peru. The camp was closed in 1948. 
Upon independence, the Republic of Croatia tried to entice its displaced persons to return through tax exemptions and monetary aid.

Milroy v Lord

Milroy v Lord [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Ch/1862/J78.html EWHC J78 is an English trusts law case that held trusts should not be used to save gifts from being defeated. It purported to follow one of the maxims of equity that "Equity will not assist a volunteer" which has two sub-strands.
Facts.
Thomas Medley set up a trust for his niece, Eleanor Milroy (née Dudgeon). Samuel Lord was to be the Trustee. Medley took a number of steps to achieve this: He set up a written deed to establish the trust, consideration was given for the shares, and Miss Dudgeon was intended to receive the dividends of shares when she married and to receive the shares when Medley died. However, Medley did not in fact transfer the shares to Lord, but merely gave Lord power to distribute the dividends, which meant that the gift was incomplete. Had Medley transferred the gift to Lord as stated, all would have been well. However: because Medley kept the shares which he had originally said were going to be transferred, the trust wasn't valid.
Judgment.
Turner LJ stated that there were three 'modes' of making a gift:
He went on to state that:
in order to render the settlement binding, one or other of these modes must, as I understand the law of this Court, be resorted to, for there is no equity in this Court to perfect an imperfect gift. The cases I think go further to this extent, that if the settlement is intended to be effectuated by one of the modes to which I have referred, the Court will not give effect to it by applying another of those modes. If it is intended to take effect by transfer, the Court will not hold the intended transfer to operate as a declaration of trust, for then every imperfect instrument would be made effectual by being converted into a perfect trust. (Turner LJ)
Significance.
There were subsequently two exceptions to the Milroy v. Lord rule set out in "Re. Rose" (the gift will be an effective transfer where the donor has done everything he is obliged to do to make the gift valid) and Strong v. Bird [1874 (a debtor appointed to an estate as executor will have his debt forgiven if, and only if, the testator manifested an intention to forgive the debt and this intention continued until death).

Nelson Asaytono (born January 25, 1967) is a retired professional basketball player of the Philippine Basketball Association, also known as "The Bull" for his monster dunks. He played for 5 teams (Purefoods, Swift, San Miguel, Pop Cola and Red Bull) in the PBA.
Nelson Asaytono is one of the great players to ever step up in a less-known university named University of Manila who produced stars such as Reynel Hugnatan and others. He is also part of the very talented rookies of 1989 which also had SSC-R stalwart Paul Alvarez, UP power force Venancio Paras, and DLSU hotshot Ferdinand Pumaren. He was drafted by the young-but-powerful Purefoods Hotdog squad led by Isabelo Lastimosa, Alvin Dale Patrimonio, and Jerry Codinera.
At Purefoods, he was an immediate back-up of Alvin Dale Patrimonio who was then the star forward. Often, he could share his own set of talent to his teammates such as Glen Capacio, Isabelo Lastimosa, fellow rookie Ferdinand Pumaren and Jerry Codinera. Here, he could often lead the Ayala-based squad (likewise he later did when he was with RFM). During his tenure with the team, he won 2 titles as he was traded before the 1992 season.
He later moved to Diet Sarsi Bottlers who had his former teammates Alfonso Solis and Edgar Tanuan and other players such as rookie Enrique Reyes, Yoyoy Villamin, Bernard Fabiosa, and fellow new recruit Rudy Distrito. As he came in, he became the leader of the RFM squad sharing duties with Alfonso Solis. His leadership and talent made him a MVP caliber but he came short to SMB fireman Renato Agustin. As he lose the MVP, he led the Swift Mighty Meaties to 2 PBA titles which includes the 1992 3rd Conference vs. 7-up Bottlers and the 1993 Commissioner's Cup vs. Purefoods Oodles Chicken Noodle Soup.
The next season, another sweet-shooting forward came in to help the Yanga team mightier. His name? Vergel Meneses. The arrival of Meneses himself made Asaytono's exposure cut down to half in which it became shorter when Coach Frederick Pumaren came in. Due to short exposures, he was later relegated to the bench as he was with the Purefoods and was later traded to San Miguel Beermen to search for a new life and resurgence.
With SMB, he found a team that would make him "The Man" of the team. Likewise, when he came, he was first put to the bench but when Coach Ron Jacobs came in, he felt happy as he later became "The Man" of the SMB franchise who also had Michael Mustre, Alan Vito Caidic, Avelino Lim, Yves Dignadice, and Peter Naron. Due to this, another MVP nomination would get onto him but came short to former teammate, Alvin Dale Patrimonio. Although he lost the MVP, he led the league in scoring.
But the arrival of Danilo Ildefonso would have made his exposure cut into 1/8 but still he led the stats and led SMB to the final dance but came short to the stronger Alaske Milkman led by Isabelo Lastimosa, Kenneth Duremdes, and Johnny Abarrientos. A year later, when Coach Jong Uichico arrived after Coach Ron's battle versus the BCAP led by then-fellow PBA head coach Atty. Andres Narvasa, Jr, he was later relegated to the bench as he was traded to his former team, the Pop Cola 800s (together with hotshot William Antonio) for Dwight Lago, Emmanuel Victoria, and Nicholas Belasco, who later became key players for SMB's big run during the late 1990s, don't forget the Two Dannys (Ildefonso and Seigle) plus Rodericko Racela.
At Pop Cola, his talent started to slow down as he was still at the bench. His notable teammates are Isabelo Lastimosa, Manuel Locsin, Jonathan Ordonio, and Johnny Abarrientos.
On April 7, 2005, the then 38 year old Asaytono finished with 17 points on 6-of-9 shooting to have 12,268 points in 796 career games, eclipsing the 12,077 points of Philip Cezar, to take the fifth spot in the PBA career scoring mark. He is among the Top 5 players who have scored the most points in the PBA, and the only non-Most Valuable Player winner in that category.
No team took notice about this bad-attitude forward until his former coach Joseller Guiao took him into his team, the Red Bull Thunder who had DaVonn Harp and Willie Miller as top enforcers before the 2002 season. He was in the reserve's list but when Michael Pennisi and DaVonn Harp were suspended in 2004 due to citizenship, he was moved to the bench and contributing some plays for the team until his retirement in November 2005.
After PBA, he had a short stint in National Basketball Conference and now playing for the San Miguel All-Stars together with former teammates Michael Mustre and others.
As of 2010, Nelson Asaytono (12,268) trails Atoy Co's (No.4) 12,994 points. Ramon Fernandez remains on top with 18,996, followed by Abet Guidaben (15,775) and Alvin Patrimonio (15,091).

Nathaniel Dawes

Nathaniel Dawes (24 July 1843 – 12 September 1910) was the first Anglican Bishop of Rockhampton from 1892 until 1909.
Dawes was born in Rye, Sussex, England and educated at Montpelier College, Brighton and St Alban Hall, Oxford and ordained a deacon in 1871 and priest in 1872. His first post was as a curate at St Peter’s Vauxhall from 1871 to 1877 after which he was Vicar of Charterhouse before emigrating to Australia to become the Rector of St Andrew's South Brisbane. He was then appointed Archdeacon of Brisbane and later its coadjutor bishop before translation to Rockhampton in 1892. Dawes travelled to England in 1907 for medical treatment. On 27 May 1908, on medical advice, he reluctantly resigned his see and was succeeded by George Halford. Dawes died on 12 September 1910 in Malvern, Worcestershire, England.

Ballaghaderreen railway station

Ballaghaderreen railway station was a station which served Ballaghaderreen in County Roscommon, Ireland. It was the terminus of a branch line from Kilfree Junction.
History.
Opened by the Midland Great Western Railway, 1924 the Railways Act passed by the Oireachtas of the Irish Free State moved the station to the "Great Southern Railway". In 1925 another merger led to management by the Great Southern Railways. The station was then nationalised, passing on to the Coras Iompair Éireann as a result of the Transport Act 1944 which took effect from 1 January 1945.
The unusual station building at Ballaghaderreen, built with rough stone, remains though very derelict. Part of the platform survives also, complete with name board posts. The goods shed, used by the GAA remains complete with its typical long cattle bank platform. The water tower and single road engine shed however have been demolished, a health centre now stands on their site. The terminus was unusual also for not having a signal cabin; the instruments were housed in the station building.

Ross Raisin is a British novelist. He was born in Keighley in Yorkshire, and after attending Bradford Grammar School he studied English at King's College London, which was followed by a period as a trainee wine bar manager and a postgraduate degree in creative writing at Goldsmiths, University of London.
Raisin's debut novel "God's Own Country" (titled "Out Backward" in North America) was published in 2008. It was shortlisted for the Guardian First Book Award and the John Llewellyn Rhys Prize, and won a Betty Trask Award. The novel focuses on Sam Marsdyke, a disturbed adolescent living in a harsh rural environment, and follows his journey from isolated oddity to outright insanity. Thomas Meaney in "The Washington Post" compared the novel favorably to Anthony Burgess's "A Clockwork Orange", and said "Out Backward more convincingly registers the internal logic of unredeemable delinquency." Writing in "The Guardian" Justine Jordan described the novel as "an absorbing read", which marked Raisin out as "a young writer to watch". In April 2009 the book won Raisin the Sunday Times Young Writer of the Year Award. He is currently a writer-in-residence for the charity First Story.
In 2013 he was included in the Granta list of 20 best young writers.

<doc id="20221609" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20221609" title="Bulirsch–Stoer algorithm">
Bulirsch–Stoer algorithm

In numerical analysis, the Bulirsch–Stoer algorithm is a method for the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations which combines three powerful ideas: Richardson extrapolation, the use of rational function extrapolation in Richardson-type applications, and the modified midpoint method, to obtain numerical solutions to ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with high accuracy and comparatively little computational effort. It is named after Roland Bulirsch and Josef Stoer. It is sometimes called the Gragg–Bulirsch–Stoer (GBS) algorithm because of the importance of a result about the error function of the modified midpoint method, due to William B. Gragg.
Underlying ideas.
The idea of Richardson extrapolation is to consider a numerical calculation whose accuracy depends on the used stepsize "h" as an (unknown) analytic function of the stepsize "h", performing the numerical calculation with various values of "h", fitting a (chosen) analytic function to the resulting points, and then evaluating the fitting function for "h" = 0, thus trying to approximate the result of the calculation with infinitely fine steps.
Bulirsch and Stoer recognized that using rational functions as fitting functions for Richardson extrapolation in numerical integration is superior to using polynomial functions because rational functions are able to approximate functions with poles rather well (compared to polynomial functions), given that there are enough higher-power terms in the denominator to account for nearby poles. While a polynomial interpolation or extrapolation only yields good results if the nearest pole is rather far outside a circle around the known data points in the complex plane, rational function interpolation or extrapolation can have remarkable accuracy even in the presence of nearby poles.
The modified midpoint method by itself is a second-order method, and therefore generally inferior to fourth-order methods like the fourth-order Runge–Kutta method. However, it has the advantage of requiring only one derivative evaluation per substep (asymptotically for a large number of substeps), and, in addition, as discovered by Gragg, the error of a modified midpoint step of size "H", consisting of "n" substeps of size "h" = "H"/"n" each, and expressed as a power series in "h", contains only even powers of "h". This makes the modified midpoint method extremely useful to the Bulirsch–Stoer method as the accuracy increases two orders at a time when the results of separate attempts to cross the interval "H" with increasing numbers of substeps are combined.
, in their discussion of the method, say that rational extrapolation in this case is nearly never an improvement over polynomial interpolation . Furthermore, the modified midpoint method is a modification of the regular midpoint method to make it more stable, but because of the extrapolation this does not really matter .

Trevose Head (, meaning "farm of the wall's headland") () is a headland on the Atlantic coast of north Cornwall, United Kingdom. It is situated approximately west of Padstow. The South West Coast Path runs around the whole promontory and is within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and the Trevose Head Heritage Coast. In clear weather, visitors to Trevose Head can see virtually the whole length of the north Cornwall coast; to the north, the view extends beyond the Cornwall county boundary to Hartland Point (40 miles), Devon; to the south, it extends beyond St Ives to the headland at Pendeen Watch (35 miles). Trevose Head Lighthouse, maintained by Trinity House, is on the north-west corner of the headland and the Padstow lifeboat is stationed on the east side of Trevose Head. The ruins of St Constantine's chapel can be visited at hole 3 of Trevose Golf Club along an ancient right of way. The club is situated between Constantine Bay and Mother Ivey's Bay, behind Booby's Bay.
"Trevose Head and Constantine Bay" Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) is designated for both its biological and geological interests. Wild asparagus grows on the cliffs of Dinas Head and shore dock at the base of the cliffs. The cliffs are also important for breeding fulmar, razorbill and guillemot.

James Sanks Brisbin

James Sanks Brisbin (May 23, 1837 – January 14, 1892) was an American educator, lawyer, and soldier. He served as a Union Army general during the American Civil War. After the conflict he remained in the military for the rest of his life, and authored several works on a variety of subjects.
Early life and career.
Brisbin was born in 1837 at Boalsburg, Pennsylvania, a son of Margaret and Ezra Brisbin. He studied at the Boalsburg Academy, and upon graduating Brisbin began teaching. He later purchased and edited the "Centre Democrat" newspaper in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, and also studied law and was later admitted to the bar of Pennsylvania. Brisbin was prominently known as an anti-slavery orator.
Civil War service.
When the American Civil War began in 1861, Brisbin was a lawyer in practice. He enlisted in the Pennsylvania volunteer services that April as a private. On April 26, he was appointed a second lieutenant in the mounted 2nd U.S. Dragoons. He fought in the First Battle of Bull Run near Manassas, Virginia, on July 21. In this battle, Brisbin received two wounds, one in his side and the other in an arm, and was praised by his superiors for his performance during the fight.
On August 3, 1861, Brisbin transferred to the 1st U.S. Cavalry (previously known as the 1st Dragoons until a reorganization of the army) but then was appointed a captain in the 6th U.S. Cavalry two days later. On June 9, 1862, he fought during the action near Beverly Ford, Virginia, and was again wounded when he fell off of his horse. Exactly one year later Brisbin was brevetted to the rank of major for his conduct at Beverly Ford. In 1863 he very briefly led the cavalry forces in the Federal Department of the Susquehanna, and was wounded in a leg during combat near Greenbrier, Virginia, on July 26.
Brisbin was promoted to colonel on March 1, 1864, and organized the 5th United States Colored Cavalry. He served as the acting head of cavalry on the staff of Brig. Gen. Albert L. Lee during the Red River Campaign, and was again wounded during the Battle of Mansfield in Louisiana on April 8, this time in the right foot. On December 12, 1864, Brisbin was brevetted to brigadier general in the Union Army, and seven days later was appointed a brevet lieutenant colonel in the regular army for his performance at Battle of Marion in Tennessee. In 1865, he was on recruiting duty in Kentucky, serving on the staff of Maj. Gen. Stephen G. Burbridge. On March 13, Brisbin was brevetted to colonel in the regular army as well as brevetted major general in the Union Army, and on May 1 he was promoted to brigadier general. Brisbin was mustered out of the Union Army as a volunteer on January 15, 1866.
Postbellum.
After the war, Brisbin remained in the regular army, aiding in the establishment of other colored regiments and served in the Northwestern United States as an officer in several cavalry regiments. From 1868–92, he served as an officer in several cavalry regiments, including the Second, Ninth, First, and Eighth regiments in the Northwestern United States. Brisbin was in command of the 2nd Cavalry of General John Gibbon's Montana Column at the time of the Little Big Horn campaign. Brisbin offered his 2nd Cavalry to Custer at the final command meeting of Generals Terry, Gibbon, and Custer just prior to the final march into the Big Horn valley, but Custer declined it, stating that the 7th Cavalry alone could defeat the hostiles. Brisbin never forgave Custer for this, and is alleged to have called the dead Custer an "insufferable ass". In various correspondence (see Graham "The Custer Myth", Philbrick, "The Last Stand") Brisbin was openly critical of Custer's actions - whether or not because of personal jealousy cannot be determined. Brisbin also penned the then-bestselling "Beef Bonzana" which urged investment in Open Range Cattle. At the time of his death he was a colonel in command of the Eighth Cavalry Regiment and was in command at Fort Meade. Brisbin died on January 14, 1892 in Philadelphia. He was buried in Oakwood Cemetery in Red Wing, Minnesota.
Personal life.
Brisbin married Mary Jane Wagner on June 15, 1861. They had four children. His wife died at Fort McKinney in 1887. In 1891 he married Amelia Wilson in Red Wing, Minnesota.
He was also a prolific writer, and contributed articles and letters to Eastern periodicals on many subjects throughout his career. He was known for his works on the Army Indian Wars, the West and Montana Territory.

Mark Upton

Mark Upton is an English artist who specialises in portraits of animals, particularly horses and falcons. His main media are oil paint, watercolour and pencil.
Early life.
Mark Lundy Upton was born in Wiltshire, England in 1964. His parents, Roger and Jean ("nee." Turnell) were living in Marlborough and had recently started a leather and sporting goods retail business in the town. Roger was already a well known falconer and the same year as Mark was born had started to travel in the Middle East, going to Abu Dhabi as a guest of the late Sheikh Said bin Shakhbut. There he met and became a lifelong friend of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan who later became ruler of Abu Dhabi and the first president of the UAE. Jean was the eldest daughter of Bob Turnell who was at the time one of the leading jumping racehorse trainers of the time with a yard just outside Marlborough at Ogbourne Maizey. Mark's brother, Guy Upton is eighteen months younger, and is a steeplechase jockey and horseman.
He went to the local primary school at Preshute and later attended St Johns in Marlborough. After school, Mark took a year out and worked for Sheikh Surour bin Mohamad al Nahayan in Abu Dhabi. He then returned and spent a year at Swindon College of Art on an art foundation course. Upton had been brought up in a very artistic background. His father painted wildlife pictures, his uncle, Peter Upton was a well known equine artist and his grandmother had been an artist and fashion designer. Her brother was William Cain, a renowned dry point engraver between the wars spending much of his career in the Middle East.
Upton is also very well known in the falconry world as one of the top artists as well as an extremely dedicated and good falconer. In this he has followed his father and become much admired for his high-flying falcons in his own right.
In 2008, Upton married Rachelle Ormond, niece of art historian Richard Louis Ormond and great-niece of artist John Singer Sargent.
Commissions and patrons.
Instead of going on to do a Fine Art Degree at Art School Mark went straight into a painting career. Soon forging a name for himself in the country and sporting art world. At the same time he was frequently travelling in the Middle East, and was receiving commissions for many paintings of that part of the world. He has sold paintings to the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan of Abu Dhabi and many of his family. In Saudi his main patron is Prince Saud bin Abdul Mohsin al Saud and he also has paintings in collections of other Saudi Princes. Princess Alia of Jordan has also bought Mark Upton paintings.
In the UK Mark’s most important patron was HM Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother who bought various paintings from him including Scottish landscapes and sporting paintings. He has also painted for bodies like the Injured Jockeys Fund, Countryside Alliance, the Game Conservancy and Spinal Injuries Association.
Publications.

Son Buluşma

Son Buluşma () is a Turkish documentary film produced in 2007 and directed by Nesli Çölgeçen. The film depicts the memoires and the daily life of the three last veterans of the Turkish War of Independence, Ömer Küyük, Veysel Turan and Yakup Satar.
The last witnesses of the war of independence (1919–1923) tell their memories. "Nişancı Er Ömer" () from Çorum pays first a visit to his commander, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, at Anıtkabir in Ankara. He then travels to meet his comrades, "Sıhhiyeci Onbaşı Veysel" () in Konya and "Süvari Yakup" () in Eskişehir. At the time of the film shooting in 2006, Ömer Küyük was 106 years of age, Veysel Turan 105 and Yakup Satar 108. In the film, they remember the wartime and say farewell to each other.
Not long after the material for the documentary was filmed, all three veterans died, Ömer Küyük on January 13, 2006, Veysel Turan on March 25, 2007, and Yakup Satar on April 2, 2008. No one of them was able to watch the premiere held on November 14, 2008, in Çorum, the hometown of Ömer Küyük.
The screenwriter and director of the documentary film, Nesli Çölgeçen, was not aware of another veteran of the independence war, retired Colonel Mustafa Şekip Birgöl, who died as the last veteran on November 11, 2008, in Istanbul at the age of 105.

Metropolitan Police Clubs &amp; Vice Unit

The Clubs & Vice Unit is an Operational Command Unit of London's Metropolitan Police which provides advice and practical support to other units in the Metropolitan Police concerning the policing of nightclubs, vice and obscene publications.
History.
Established in 1932 as 8 Area Clubs and Vice Unit, the OCU later became better known as the ‘Clubs Office’ and was based at West End Central Police Station.
Historically, the unit dealt primarily with prostitution, later introducing nightclubs, gaming and casinos. During the 60’s and with improved technology its focus has moved onto criminal activity, including drugs, criminal control of clubs and brothels and the obscene publications industry.
The base in Vine Street was requisitioned to become the Aliens Registration office in August 1939, so the unit was temporarily closed. It reopened in October in a secret meeting in a public house in Leicester Square for officers to take instructions and collect their expenses. In 1941, the Unit moved onto the 3rd floor of the new West End Central Police Station. This location, near Soho Division, was key as Soho has been the most famous red light district in the United Kingdom since the mid 19th century.
During the Second World War the vice scene in the west end of London thrived due mainly to the number of overseas soldiers based in England, many of whom were visitors to Soho. The proprietors of unlicensed clubs in Soho were breaching licensing laws but these also became a haven for prostitution and organised crime. The Clubs officers performed covert operations to tackle these problems.
Various legislation has affected the work and direction of the unit over the years, when the Street Offences Act came into force in 1959 the majority of prostitutes left the street, practically overnight, for fear of imprisonment and the fine for living off immoral earnings which increased.
The Obscene Publications Act 1964 brought extra responsibilities when the unit were given the task of enforcing the act. As a result, obscenity became a new part of their terms of reference.
The unit reached its lowest ebb in the early 1970s when chronic allegations of corruption came to a head with the detailed exposure in 1972 of systematic payments by pornographer James Humphreys to seventeen policemen, including DCI George Fenwick, head of the obscene publications squad; his direct superior DCS Bill Moody; Cmdr Wallace Virgo, head of the Serious Crime Squad, in overall charge of the unit; and Cmdr Kenneth Drury, head of the Flying Squad. As the ensuing corruption investigations widened, the obscene publications squad was replaced in its entirety with a new group of officers drawn from the uniformed branch, and in all over 20 detectives were dismissed or required to resign. When the cases ultimately came to trial in 1977 the presiding judge Mr Justice Mars-Jones summarised those involved as having engaged in "corruption on a scale which beggars description".
As a result of this corruption, officers attached to Clubs were changed to predominantly uniformed officers who were thought to be less corrupt than their CID counterparts. There was also a rotation system where officers were posted to Clubs for a maximum of 12 months and then returned to their police stations. In practice, some returned within a matter of weeks. Crime in London Gilbert Kelland 
New challenges have arisen from the introduction of the Licensing Act 2003 (with the potential for 24 hour drinking) and the Gambling Act 2005 (with significant deregulation of gaming). With new legislation expected that covers the possession of "extreme obscenity" the work of the Clubs and Vice unit continues apace.
Role.
The Clubs and Vice unit is split into five sections:
The Clubs Unit is split into three teams: the Proactive Licensing team, Proactive Crime team and the Gaming team. All three units' primary responsibility is to generate intelligence led operations against organised criminals who use licensed premises to supply illegal drugs and gaming establishments to commit gaming fraud. They also support BOCUs in tackling licensed premises associated with serious violence and disorder.
The Obscene Publications Unit targets people who manufacture and distribute obscene material through shops, mail order, complex distribution networks and the Internet. Particular attention is focused on the most extreme and/or exploitative material.
The Taskable Unit assists BOCUs with offences occurring on the street such as kerb crawling, street prostitution and the advertising of brothels in public phone boxes, known as "carding". It also provides resources to other units within Clubs and Vice.
The Vice Unit provides a centre of investigative excellence to monitor London's off street prostitution industry and in so doing protect the most vulnerable adult and child prostitution victims and seek to investigate and prosecute those who exploit them. Emphasis is placed on rescuing trafficked and coerced victims. The unit also provides support and guidance to borough officers who come into contact with these offenders and victims.
The Intelligence Unit provides field intelligence for the proactive teams. The unit includes a dedicated Source team; Counter Terrorism and Promoters focus desks and the Financial Investigation Unit.

Pentax cameras

This article discusses the cameras – mainly 35 mm SLRs – manufactured by Ricoh Imaging Corp. and its predecessors, and . 
It covers from the first "Asahiflex" models in 1952 and their successor, the pivotal "Asahi Pentax" single-lens reflex camera, to the present time.
Background.
The period around 1950 marked the return of the Japanese photographic industry to the vigorous level of the early 1940s, and its emergence as a major exporter. The newly reborn industry had sold many of its cameras to the occupation forces (with hugely more disposable income than the Japanese) and they were well received. The Korean War saw a huge influx of journalists and photographers to the Far East, where they were impressed by lenses from companies such as Nikon and Canon for their Leica rangefinder cameras, and also by bodies by these and other companies to supplement and replace the Leica and Contax cameras they were using. This was the background to the development of Asahi Optical's first camera.
The Screw mount cameras.
The Asahiflex Series.
Asahi Optical introduced its first 35 mm camera in 1952. Asahi was unusual in deciding to start with a high-quality 35mm camera that was not a copy of something else. Its designers were convinced of the inherent superiority of the SLR and so proceeded along these lines. This effort resulted in the Asahiflex I, which was also the first Japanese 35mm SLR. 
The Asahiflex I had a non-interchangeable waist-level viewfinder, with a direct optical viewfinder for eye-level use. The Asahiflex I had a non-returning mirror and shutter speeds from 1/25 to 1/500. The camera used the M37 screw mount. It went through some minor modifications for flash use, resulting in the IA. With the IIB a key advance was made: the quick-return mirror. The problem of mirror black-out was one of the main problems with prior SLR designs, greatly reducing usability and a major reason for the greater popularity of the rangefinder. With the IIB there emerged the first practical quick-return mirror, a vital innovation and one which was quickly adopted by other manufacturers. With the final model in the series, the IIA, the Asahiflex gained slow speeds from 1/25th of a second to 1/2 of a second.
Asahi-Pentax Series (pre Spotmatic).
A recognized problem with the Asahiflex series was that, lacking a pentaprism, it was very difficult to use the camera in a vertical position and taking pictures of moving objects was almost impossible. The small viewfinder on top of the camera was of little use when the photographer wanted to use a 135 mm or 500 mm lens. The problem was recognized by Asahi. In 1957, Asahi introduced the Pentax series, a 35 mm single-lens reflex camera (SLR) camera which was so well received that it influenced the design of 35 mm SLRs worldwide for years to come. The Pentax and its later development and likewise classic 1964 Pentax Spotmatic spurred the development of Asahi into a photographic multinational company, eventually renaming itself "Pentax" after its seminal product. The Pentax series remains pivotal in the development of modern SLR photography.
There is some confusion about the etymology of the name. Some sources claim it was licensed from VEB Zeiss Ikon, and derived from the combination "PENTAprism" and "contaX". The explanation on pentax.com does not mention Contax or Zeiss Ikon, and states that the name was formed from "PENTAprism" and "refleX", being the reflex mirror of an SLR camera. A third variation substitutes "Asahiflex" for "reflex", which is at least logical as the Asahiflex cameras had waist-level viewfinders and therefore the pentaprism of the Asahi Pentax would have been a significant differentiating feature.
The Asahi Pentax of 1957 featured:
Moreover, the Pentax placed controls in locations that would become standard on 35 mm SLRs from all manufacturers, such as the right-handed rapid wind lever, the bottom right mounted rewind release, and film speed reminder around the film rewind crank.
The photographic giants Canon & Nikon, did not introduce their own SLR cameras until 1959 with the Canonflex and the F-series respectively. By contrast, the Pentax series offered these features at a relatively low price, introducing many photographers to 35 mm SLR photography.
The Asahi Pentax series went through various iterations until 1964. Each successive model incorporated minor improvements, the most noticeable being the incorporation of the two shutter speed dials (one for high speeds and one for low speeds) into one. The AP of 1957 is externally almost identical to the 1964 SV.
Spotmatic Series.
However, by the 1960s the clamour for in-camera exposure metering was rising. It was possible to attach an external CdS (Cadmium sulfide) exposure meter to the later AP-derived models, but in 1960 the next breakthrough arrived. At the 1960 Photokina camera show, Asahi exhibited the Spot-matic prototype. This camera took exposure measurements, via a spotmeter, through the taking lens, an incredible innovation. The camera excited tremendous attention and in 1964 the first production Spotmatic (hyphen dropped) emerged. The Spotmatic was virtually identical to the prototype; however, the spotmeter was replaced with an all-over average-reading exposure meter in order to give more consistent results. The camera was an instant success and was snapped up by the thousands, although Asahi had been beaten into production by the Topcon RE Super which went on sale in April 1963; the Topcon failed to attract the same degree of commercial success. The Spotmatic was replaced by the Spotmatic II with many upgrades 1971 - 1976.
In 1966 Asahi Optical had produced one million SLR cameras since the first Asahiflex of 1952. It took them only another three years, until 1969, to reach two million. This period was a time of complete pre-eminence for Asahi Optical. During the Spotmatic era Asahi were manufacturing more SLRs per month than all the other camera manufacturers combined. One of the technological highlights was the Electro-Spotmatic of 1971. This camera was one of the very first to incorporate automatic exposure. The series concluded in 1973 with the introduction of the Spotmatic F (now incorporating open-aperture metering rather than the stop-down metering of the early models).
However by the mid-1970s the limitations of the M42 mount were being felt. By this time most other manufacturers had opted for a bayonet lens mount. It was a great step for Asahi Optical to take but the M42 screw mount, by now widely known as 'Pentax screw mount', had reached the end of its useful life. Pentax were now to adopt the lens mount that would see them through the next 30 years.
Other Prototypes.
In 1960, the same year that Asahi Optical introduced the Spot-matic prototype at Photokina, they also showed another SLR prototype which they called the Metallica. The Metallica gave a glimpse into the future direction of Pentax cameras; it featured a prototype bayonet lens mount, a vertical-traveling, metallic Copal-type focal plane shutter (from which the camera drew its name), and an already obsolescent coupled selenium light meter. The light meter was not TTL, but instead featured the typical large selenium mini-lens pattern on the front of the pentaprism. Otherwise the camera resembled the Spot-matic in appearance. While Asahi Optical didn't put the Metallica into production, the concepts of a bayonet lens mount and a metal focal plane shutter were already being discussed internally at the company.
In 1966 Asahi Optical showed a revised prototype of the Metallica named the Metallica II. Gone was the cumbersome selenium light meter, replaced with a now standard internal CdS meter. The Metallica II retained the bayonet lens mount shown in the earlier 1960 prototype, and also featured an improved Copal-square metallic shutter. But the biggest innovation was the fully automatic shutter operation coupled to the TTL meter. The metering system, for the first time in a 35mm SLR, controlled the shutter speed automatically based on the aperture set. With these innovative developments, the Metallica II pioneered features that would not surface on Pentax production cameras until the Electro-Spotmatic (ES) (automatic aperture-priority exposure) in 1971 and K2 (vertical metal shutter, bayonet lens mount, automatic aperture-priority exposure) in 1975. (Cecchi 1991:80-86)
K Mount cameras.
K Series.
Three new models were introduced at once in 1975: the K2, KM and KX. The KM was almost identical in features and operation to the Spotmatic F. The KX featured a better TTL light meter using SPD (silicon photodiodes), visible aperture and shutter speeds in the viewfinder, and a mirror lock-up mechanism. The K2, the flagship model, incorporated aperture-priority autoexposure with a fully manually selectable range of shutter speeds from 8s to 1/1000. The only other aperture priority camera Pentax had made up to this point, the ES series, only had manual shutter speeds from 1/60 upwards. A special version of the K2 was also produced (called the K2DMD) to use a motor drive and data back. A later addition to the K series was the K1000 (basically a KM stripped of its self-timer and depth of field preview), later to find fame as the perennial camera of choice for photography students.
What set these cameras apart from any earlier Pentax was the removal of the M42 lens mount. With the K series of cameras, Pentax followed its rivals and introduced its own bayonet mount, the K mount. Still the basis for Pentax lenses and cameras today, this offered greater convenience and enabled the production of faster lenses such as the 50 mm . Eager to keep M42 users in the Pentax system, an M42-K Mount adaptor was offered, enabling M42 users to continue to use their existing lenses (with loss of automation).
The K series cameras followed the design ethos of the time, big and heavy. But scarcely had the K series been introduced, than Pentax began working on a new camera line, a new camera line reflecting a new ethos - one which continues to influence Pentax to this day.
M Series.
The M series cameras were noted for their compact size, and are among the smallest 35 mm SLRs ever made, though they are quite heavy when compared to the plastic SLRs of the 1990s. Except for the MX, all were based on the same basic camera body, and featured aperture-priority exposure automation. While superficially resembling the ME, the MX was designed as a manual-only SLR system targeted to the advanced amateur or professional photographer, and had its own set of accessories that were mostly incompatible with the other M series cameras. Conversely, the other M-series cameras were targeted squarely at casual users. None of the M-series, with the exception of the MX, featured a depth of field preview.
The ME featured aperture-priority only automation with no manual override.
The MX was entirely manual and resembled the earlier KX in features.
The ME Super was an ME with a manual mode.
The MG, MV, and MV1 were even simpler versions of the original ME.
The ME-F was an early attempt at an autofocus SLR using a special 35-70mm zoom with a motor built into the lens.
A Series.
The A series added fully programmed exposure control (adjusting both aperture and shutter speed automatically) to the M series. To enable control of the lens aperture by the camera body, it used the new KA-mount, a backward-compatible modification that also allowed the array of standard K-mount lenses to be used in manual and aperture-priority exposure modes. The A series were the first cameras from Pentax to use LCD digital displays for exposure information in the viewfinder. The super A / super PROGRAM and the program A / program PLUS both used a translucent white window on the front of the pentaprism to provide backlight to the LCD display without having to use the battery for illumination. 
LX.
The Pentax LX model was a tough, professional-grade competitor to the Nikon F3, the Canon F-1, Olympus OM cameras, and Contax RTS. It is rugged, weatherised and sealed against dust, yet compact and light. It has interchangeable focusing screen and viewfinder; the S69 screen is particularly bright. The LX uses an advanced metering system that also reads the light falling on the film and the first shutter curtain during exposure, the TTL OTF (off the film) feature, a Minolta patent, but utilised by Olympus in the OM-2 in 1975. The selected aperture value and shutter speed are shown in the viewfinder. The camera remained in production for more than 20 years.
P Series.
The P series featured fully programmed exposure control (in addition to manual mode), DX-code film speed setting (defaulting to 100 if the code couldn’t be read), exposure lock and depth of field preview. All but the P3/P30 also offered Av mode, and the P5/P50 offered exposure compensation of ±3 EV.
SF Series.
The SFX (called the SF1 in the US) was the world's first AF SLR with built-in TTL auto flash, which is retractable. Pentax has referred to the built-in flash as "RTF" (Retractable TTL Flash) ever since then. Pentax SAFOX I (Sensor Ability Fortifying Optical Compensating System) autofocus module was integrated to these series.
Z/Pz Series.
The second generation of autofocus cameras from Pentax. They are equipped with new SAFOX II autofocus module and power contact to enable power zoom function in power zoom FA lenses.
MZ/ZX Series.
This innovative series brought the "small and light" concept back from previous generation manual focus cameras. This series known as MZ models elsewhere were named ZX models in the USA except MZ-S, the MZ-5 being known as the ZX-5 in the USA. The exception to this rule was the MZ-6 which was known as the ZX-L in the USA. Models shown on the same row are model replacements/upgrades in the range, so the MZ-10 was replaced by the MZ-7 which was subsequently replaced by the MZ-6.
All members of this series are compact autofocus SLRs except the MZ-M. The flagship model in this series is the MZ-S which body materials are metal, faster film drive and higher flash sync speed. Only MZ-S and MZ-6 are compatible with newly introduced P-TTL flash system. Both models can control remote flash wirelessly by popup flash commander mode in normal or high-speed flash sync. 
SAFOX IV/V autofocus module are integrated into this series.
Models which were also backward compatible with both the KA and K mounts:
MZ-S (Flagship model)
MZ-3
MZ-5 MZ-5n
MZ-10 MZ-7 MZ-6/ZX-L
MZ-M (manual focus version and no built in flash)
Models which were backward compatible with the KA mount but not the K mount:
MZ50 MZ30
MZ60
Digital.
MZ-D Prototype.
The Pentax MZ-D, also known by its internal code name of MR-52, was a prototype digital single-lens reflex camera. It was announced at Photokina in September 2000 and was demonstrated to the press at the Photo Marketing Association (PMA) show in January 2001. In October 2003, Pentax canceled the camera, stating "The cost of manufacturing the prototype SLR 6-megapixel digital camera meant it was not a viable product for our target market."
*ist Series (Digital).
In 2003 Pentax introduced their first Digital SLR under Digital *ist series and released the first flagship model, the Pentax *ist D which uses a Sony 6 megapixel CCD. Since 2003, the *ist D is the only digital SLR that can control HS wireless P-TTL from its pop-up flash and has many advanced features for professional applications. In 2004 Pentax released the second member in the digital *ist line, the Pentax *ist DS which is the first real consumer model (retailing under $1,000 USD). What set Pentax D and DS DSLRs apart from the competition was the clarity and high magnification provided by their pentaprism viewfinders, a very useful feature considering the support for legacy manual focus lenses. In 2005 Pentax released the Pentax *ist DL, a model with fewer features than the D and DS with a lower price. All Pentax's digital SLRs are compatible with K-mount lenses, and M42 (42 mm screw mount) lenses (with adaptor). Due to the smaller size of the CCD, lenses have an effective field of view of 1.5 × times the same lens in 35 mm format. So, where a 50 mm lens was considered a "normal" lens on 35 mm film, that same lens on a 1.5× "crop factor" camera has the field of view of a 75 mm lens on film. This only uses the center of the lens' projected image. To address this "crop factor," Pentax created a new series of lenses that were designed only to cover the smaller sensor. These are the DA series for their digital SLRs, which still feature the K-mount but have a smaller back-focus element designed specifically for use with the Digital SLR lineup. The DA series lenses do not have a mechanical aperture ring and so are not backward compatible with some earlier film bodies. The later D-FA lens series re-introduces a mechanical aperture ring and so is fully compatible with both film and digital SLRs.
SAFOX VIII are integrated into this camera series.
K Series (Digital).
In May 2006, Pentax announced a new line of Digital SLR cameras to replace Digital *ist series. The K100D and K110D replaced *ist DL2 and DS2, while incorporating in-body shake reduction in the K100D model. The Pentax K10D, a new flagship model in Digital K series replaced *ist D, adopted Sony 10-megapixel CCD sensor and weather-sealing construction, was announced on 14 September 2006.
The K10D featured a pentaprism viewfinder (instead of the slightly dimmer pentamirror on some previous models), full programmed, aperture and shutter priority modes, and a new Sensitivity-priority mode where the rear dial adjusts light sensitivity and the camera adjusts shutter speed and aperture to maintain correct exposure. Power contacts on the lens mount were introduced to enable Pentax's SDM (Supersonic Drive Motor) for silent focusing. The power contacts also provide the power zoom function in some FA lens that Pentax introduced in the 1990s. In addition, the K10D could write JPEGs and two versions of RAW files (PEF, and the Adobe specification DNG).
The K100D Super was a slight upgrade to the K100D announced in June 2007. The upgrade included some features from the K10D, such as an improved shake reduction (SR) system, a dust removal system, and power contacts for SDM lenses, but which could not enable the power zoom function as the K10D. 
On January 23, 2008, Pentax announced the K20D and K200D, which replaced the K10D and K100D series respectively. The K20D featured a Samsung 14.6 megapixel CMOS APS-C sized sensor, a special 21 frame/s burst mode, live preview on the LCD display, and an increased sensitivity range extending to ISO 3200. The K200D adopted the 10 megapixel sensor and weather sealing of the K10D, among other improvements, while retaining the smaller body size of the K100D Super.
The K-m / K2000 for US was announced on September 22, 2008 at the 2008 Photokina trade show along with the DA-L series of lightweight, inexpensive lenses.
On May 20, 2009, Pentax announced the K-7 as a replacement for the K20D. It introduced an updated version of the Samsung CMOS sensor, but with an entirely new compact design. Notable new features included full metal body construction, a pentaprism viewfinder covering 100% of the frame, 720p video capture, a quieter and faster shutter mechanism, and the ability to apply automatic corrections for lens distortion and lateral chromatic aberration. This flagship model uses a 77 multi-zone metering system and updated focus - SAFOX VIII+. The K-7 was available from July 2009.
In September 2009 the K-x, was introduced to replace the entry level K-m / K2000 (US). It is regarded as one of the best APS-C DSLRs in terms of overall image quality, especially in high ISO performance. 
In September 2010 Pentax announced the K-r, a 6 frames per second 12.4 megapixel camera and the K-5, a 7 frames per second 16.3 megapixel camera. These cameras use a new, faster autofocus system, SAFOX IX.
In February 2012 information about the Pentax K-01 Mirrorless camera was released. It still uses the standard K mount but lacks an optical reflex viewfinder.
Pentax announced a new mid-level DSLR, the K-30, in May 2012. It has the same APS-C sensor and processor as the K-01, and is fully weather-sealed.
In September 2012, Pentax announced the successor to the K-5, the K-5 II. It has the same APS-C sensor as the K-5, but has an improved autofocus sensor and a redesigned rear LCD with no air gap. A version of the camera without an anti-aliasing filter would be sold as the K-5 IIs. Both cameras were released in October 2012.
In June 2013 Pentax announced the successors to the K-30, the K-50 and K-500. Both are mid-level DSLRs, the K-500 being a stripped-down version of the K-50, having no weather seals and less-advanced electronics. Pentax K-500 uses 4 AA batteries (rechargeable Lithium battery is optional), while Pentax K-50 uses rechargeable Lithium battery.
In October 2013 Pentax launched the successor to the K-5ii and K-5iis, the Pentax K-3. The K-3 is the first DSLR to use its shake reduction system to function as an anti-aliasing filter. It has a 24.71 megapixel sensor and other improvements over the K-5 but maintains the rugged stainless steel frame and magnesium alloy body construction, complete with 92 body seals thereby rendering the camera cold-proof and water resistant.
645D.
In March 2010 Pentax announced its first medium format digital camera, the Pentax 645D. The camera has been in and out of development since 2003 and went on sale in Japan in May 2010 at RRP of ¥850,000, with supplies to the rest of the world expected to start soon after. It is targeted at professionals doing outdoor photography—camera body features very high level of airtightness. It uses a 40 megapixels, 44 mm × 33 mm CCD sensor. At the same time, new series of lenses designated D FA 645 (Featuring Weather Sealing on all such lenses) was also released.
Pentax Q.
In June 2011 Pentax announced the 'Pentax Q' mirrorless interchangeable lens camera and the 'Q-mount' lens system. It has a small, 1/2.3 inch 12.4 megapixel LED Backlit CMOS sensor.
Announced in September, 2012, the Q10 has a slightly redesigned body and an improved sensor. Most features and specifications were unchanged. The launch price was also lower than the of the Original Q. In June 2013, the next generation of the Q series, the Q7, was announced. The most significant change is that the Q7 uses a larger 1/1.7 inch sensor with the same 12.4 MP resolution.
Optio (Digital).
The Optio line is a series is a line of consumer digital cameras. It is one of the earliest mass-market examples of a digital point-and-shoot camera.
Other formats.
Pentax is one of the few camera manufacturers still producing medium format cameras. , there are two offerings, one in the 6×7 format—the Pentax 67 II, and one in the 6×4.5 format—Pentax 645NII. Both use 120 or 220 roll film. These cameras build on the Pentax SLR design experience. The shape of the Pentax 67 is broadly similar to a 35 mm SLR camera. By contrast, the Pentax 645 resembles other medium-format cameras by makers such as Mamiya and Bronica, which tend to be cube-shaped.
Another interesting product was the tiny Auto 110 reflex system, based on the 110 pocket-instamatic film format.

History of Ecuador (1960–90)

José María Velasco Ibarra (1960 - 61).
The instability began immediately. Ponce was so angry over Velasco's vicious campaign attacks on his government that he resigned on his last day in office rather than preside over the inauguration of his successor. During his campaign, "the National Personification" had promised government support to the masses of urban poor, many of whom had recently migrated to Guayaquil and other major cities in search of a decent job and a place to live. Velasco's populism continued into his inaugural address, when he renounced the hated 1942 Rio Protocol. He thus came to power with the adoration of the masses, but he saddled himself with expensive commitments to the poor at a time when deficits in the state coffers were approaching a critical level. Additionally, Velasco threatened Ecuador's shaky economy with what amounted to a declaration of hostilities against Peru and the guarantors of the Rio Protocol, namely Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and the United States.
Sensing the direction of the political wind in the wake of the Cuban Revolution, Velasco magnified his anti-United States rhetoric and included leftists in his government. Meanwhile, the United States encouraged Latin American governments to break diplomatic relations with Cuba. Before long, Ecuador's widening political polarization became manifest in outbreaks of violence between leftist students and the anticommunist right.
The rapidly deteriorating economic situation soon brought about a split in the velasquista coalition, however, with the left, led by Vice President Carlos Julio Arosemena Monroy (who was also president of the Chamber of Deputies) openly opposing the government in July 1961. By October relations between Velasco's government and Congress had deteriorated to the point where legislators and progovernment spectators engaged in a gun battle. Although dozens of bullet holes were later found in the Chamber, no one was injured.
A series of new sales taxes imposed during the same month in order to raise desperately needed revenues then sparked a general strike and a series of demonstrations and riots in several major cities. Amid growing chaos, Velasco ordered the arrest of his vice president, a move that opened him to charges of violating the constitution. On November 8, after only fourteen months in office, Velasco was ousted by the military and replaced by Otto Arosemena, who was his constitutional successor as well as his leading opponent.
Otto Arosemena (1961 - 1963).
Arosemena's insistence on maintaining relations with Cuba, however, became a major domestic political issue in Ecuador. Political opponents labeled Arosemena a dangerous communist, and part of the military went into open rebellion in March 1962. The following month, Ecuador broke diplomatic relations with Cuba, Poland, and Czechoslovakia. The crisis over Cuba proved to be very costly for Arosemena, who lost not only much of his local political support, but also the self-confidence to pursue his own, independent course. Afterward, the government drifted with little leadership from the president, who allegedly indulged in frequent drinking bouts.
The brief appearance of a guerrilla movement in the coastal jungle and a rash of small-scale terrorist incidents (many of which later were found to have been staged by right-wing provocateurs) also left Arosemena open to accusations of being either unable or unwilling to stop communist subversion. By early 1963, military conspiracy was again afoot. On July 11 the high command of the armed forces decided, without dissent, to depose Arosemena.
Junta (1963 - 67).
The four-man military junta that seized power announced its intention not to return the nation to constitutional rule until the institution of basic socioeconomic reforms, which both Velasco and Arosemena had promised but never implemented. This failure by their two civilian predecessors, the junta believed, had become a source of growing frustration within the lower classes, thus making them more receptive to the lure of communism. The junta combined its reformist anticommunism with the more traditional hard-line variety. After jailing or exiling the entire leadership of the communist left, the new government reorganized the nation's two leading universities in an effort to eliminate them as sources of left-wing political activity.
In July 1964, the junta decreed the Agrarian Reform Law to commemorate the first anniversary of its assumption of power. The law abolished the huasipungo system, the feudalistic land tenure arrangement widely used in the Sierra. However, the law resulted in little real improvement in the lives of the long-suffering Sierra peasants and died from lack of funding under subsequent civilian governments.
Meaningful reform was precluded, in part at least, by the increasingly cumbersome process of decision making within the politically heterogeneous, plural executive. Insubordination by the air force representative on the junta led to his dismissal and arrest in November 1965; thereafter, the junta had only three members.
In 1965 Ecuador also saw a dramatic drop in its revenue from banana exports and, despite generous development assistance from the United States government and the Inter-American Development Bank, the junta suddenly faced an economic crisis of major proportions. The announcement of increased taxes on imports sparked the opposition of the powerful Guayaquil Chamber of Commerce, which in March called for a general strike. Long- disgruntled student groups and labor unions were only too happy to join in the protest, which rapidly spread to other cities. On March 29, 1966, following a bloody and demoralizing attack on the Central University in Quito, the disillusioned military reformers stepped down.
Transition (1966-7).
The following day, a small group of civilian leaders named Clemente Yerovi Indaburu, a non-partisan banana grower who had served as minister of economy under Galo Plaza, to be provisional president. In October a popularly elected constituent assembly drafted a new constitution and elected Otto Arosemena Gómez, a cousin of Carlos Julio and a political centrist, to act as a second provisional president. During his twenty months in office, the new constitution went into effect in May 1967, and popular elections for president were held in June 1968. Incredibly, Velasco—now seventy-five years old—was voted into the presidency for the fifth time, an incredible thirty-four years after his initial victory.
Velasco (1967 - 72).
The weakness of Velasco's mandate—he managed only a plurality of barely one-third of the popular vote in a crowded field of five candidates—foreshadowed political difficulties that plagued him during his final term. His newly formed National Velasquista Federation (Federación Nacional Velasquista—FNV) was far short of a majority in either house of Congress, and a failure to build any working coalition made for a stalemate in the legislative process. Even Velasco's own vice president, a Guayaquileño Liberal named Jorge Zavala Baquerizo, turned into a strident and vocal critic. Cabinet ministers came and went with astonishing frequency. This political impasse soon combined with the fiscal and balance-of- payments crises, which by now had become customary under the spendthrift habits and administrative mismanagement associated with each of Velasco's terms in office, to spawn a major political crisis. The turning point came on June 22, 1970, when Velasco, in an action known as an autogolpe (self-seizure of power), dismissed Congress and the Supreme Court and assumed dictatorial powers.
Velasco subsequently decreed a number of necessary, though extremely unpopular, economic measures. After devaluing the sucre for the first time since 1961, he placed tight controls on foreign exchange transactions and then decreed a number of new tax measures, the most controversial of which raised import tariffs considerably. Velasco attempted to compensate for his lost prestige by baiting the United States, seizing and fining United States fishing boats found within of the Ecuadorian coast. The intensification of the "tuna war" inflamed tempers in both countries; Ecuador dismissed United States military advisers, and the United States withdrew almost all economic and military aid to Ecuador. Such nationalistic adventures were of only momentary value to Velasco, however. In 1971, amid mounting civic unrest that verified the extent of the opposition, he was forced to cancel a scheduled national plebiscite in which he hoped to replace the 1967 constitution, with the charter written under his own auspices in 1946 the Constitution, Velasco argued, made the president too weak to be effective.
The president's autogolpe and his continuance in power were possible because of support from the armed forces. Velasco's key ally was his nephew and minister of defense, General Jorge Acosta Velasco, who continually reshuffled the high command in order to retain velasquistas in key posts. In the wake of a failed attempt to oust the powerful commandant of the Quito military academy in April 1971, however, Acosta himself was forced to resign his ministerial portfolio and was summarily dispatched to Madrid as ambassador. Having lost the man who was his linchpin in the armed forces and the only apparent heir to the velasquista throne, Velasco was left to the mercy of the high command.
Two circumstances proved critical in persuading the military to overthrow Velasco before the scheduled completion of his term in 1972. On the one hand, the state was due very shortly to begin reaping vast revenues under a 1964 petroleum concession. On the other hand, the overwhelming favorite to win the presidency in 1972 was Asaad Bucaram Elmhalim, a former street peddler who in 1960 had seized the leadership of the CFP from Guevara Moreno and later had twice been an extremely popular mayor of Guayaquil. Both the military and the business community regarded Bucaram as dangerous and unpredictable and unfit to be president, especially at a time when unprecedented income was expected to flow into the state coffers. On February 15, 1972, four months before the scheduled elections, the military under the command of Jorge Queirolo G. once again overthrew Velasco, who was sent into his final period of exile. He was replaced by a three-man military junta headed by the Army chief of staff, General Guillermo Rodríguez Lara.
Junta (1972 - 79).
The military regime called itself "nationalist and revolutionary," but the well-known connections of Rodríguez Lara to the Guayaquil business community signaled disappointment for those who anticipated that he would head a progressive military regime such as was ruling in Peru at the time. It shortly became apparent that, ideologically, the General Guillermo Rodríguez Lara regime was a hybrid, reflecting a tenuous equilibrium among the widely divergent political tendencies within the Ecuadorian armed forces. Nevertheless, like the contemporary Peruvian and Brazilian regimes, the regime of Rodríguez Lara, he promised, would not be an interim government, but rather a long-term venture dedicated to introducing structural changes thought necessary to unfreeze the development process.
Rodríguez Lara's regime gave early emphasis to a campaign designed in part to exert firm control over the nation's petroleum resources and in part to consolidate the government's political authority. Several former political leaders, including ex-President Otto Arosemena, were tried for corruption in connection with oil concessions granted during the 1960s. In addition, a large number of functionaries of the Velasco government, supporters of Bucaram, as well as drug traffickers, legitimate importers, and customs officials were charged with corruption and "illegal enrichment." Although it thus assailed its major opponents from the start the military regime, however, failed to build its own civilian base of political support.
Promises of a "meaningful agrarian reform" under the auspices of Minister of Agriculture Guillermo Maldonado, a dedicated reformer, were frustrated by intense opposition from traditional elites. Maldonado was eventually forced out, and by the end of Rodríguez Lara's four years in office less than 1 percent of Ecuador's cultivable land had changed hands under the reform. More notable achievements came in the areas of building infrastructure projects, such as the major oil refinery and petrochemical complex in Esmeraldas; various highway and electrification projects; and state capitalist enterprises, particularly the Ecuadorian State Petroleum Corporation (Corporación Estatal Petrolera Ecuatoriana—CEPE). The lateter corporation was founded in 1972 and grew to become the major actor in Ecuador's exploitation of its oil reserves.
Oil policy was the regime's vehicle for its most forceful expression of nationalism. Minister of Natural Resources Gustavo Jarrín Ampudia presided over Ecuador's 1973 entry into the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), with all its attendant prestige and economic benefits. He was also responsible for Ecuador's renegotiation of a number of oil concessions, including the key Texaco-Gulf concession in the Oriente, on terms much more favorable to the state, such as substantial increases in both the royalties paid by foreign firms and the tax rate they paid on petroleum exports. These efforts were initially successful in allowing the government to retain a larger share of Ecuador's petroleum earnings.
The oil companies became increasingly disconcerted, however, when Jarrín proposed in late 1974 that the share of stock in the Texaco-Gulf subsidiary held by CEPE be increased from 25 to 51 percent. Claiming that the terms of their concessions negotiated with Jarrín had priced Ecuadorian oil beyond the world market price, the oil companies cut back drastically on their exports, at a cost to the government of hundreds of millions of dollars over the following nine months. This intense financial pressure finally led to a July 1975 announcement that taxes on the oil companies' exports were being reduced. It was thus clear that the military regime had overplayed its nationalistic oil policy, having failed to keep in mind that Ecuador was, after all, a relatively small oil producer and thus not a powerful player within OPEC.
The moderation of the regime's oil policy, however, did not result in the anticipated resolution of mounting economic problems. Oil exports rose only slightly, while imports, particularly of luxury items, continued to soar, aided by a low-tariff policy that had been designed to soak up petroleum earnings, and thus control inflation. In excess of 22 percent during 1974, inflation was rapidly eroding the real value of wages within the middle class.
In August, in an effort to resolve its balance-of-payments difficulties, the regime decreed a 60 percent duty on imported luxury items. The measure was condemned by the Chambers of Commerce in Quito and Guayaquil, whose constituents had grown dependent on the sale of imports, and caused, a week later, a bloody attempt led by the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Raúl González Alvear, to overthrow Rodríguez Lara. Although this coup attempt failed, at a cost of twenty-two lives, on January 11, 1976, a second, bloodless coup was successful in removing Rodríguez Lara. He was replaced by a Supreme Council of Government consisting of the commanders of the three armed services: Alfredo Poveda (Navy), Luis Leoro (Air Force) and Guillermo Durán (Army).
Transition.
Virtually the only item on the agenda of the new military triumvirate was to preside over a return of the government to constitutional, civilian rule. The bloody September 1975 coup attempt had revealed the depth of the breach in the institutional unity of the armed forces. Handing the government back to civilians, it was hoped, might remove the causes of divisions within the military, or at least make it easier to hide them from public view.
The original timetable, announced in June 1976, called for a transition that was to culminate in presidential elections in February 1978. First, new government charters and electoral laws were to be drafted by appointed commissions, and then a public referendum would choose between two proposed constitutions. The transition was repeatedly slowed down, however, and in the end, instead of the less than two years originally scheduled, three years and eight months elapsed between the 1976 coup and the inauguration of a civilian president.
Two reasons are commonly cited for the delay: the slowness of decision making within the Supreme Council of Government because of ongoing disagreement within the military high command and repeated maneuverings by the military government to manipulate the electoral process, thereby controlling its outcome. Like the Rodríguez Lara government, the Council was particularly interested in seeing a poor electoral performance by the CFP and, especially, preventing Bucaram from winning the presidency.
The national referendum to choose the constitution was finally held on 15 January 1978. The results saw 23 percent of the voting population nullify their ballots, an action that had been advocated by the traditional right; 31 percent of the population voted in favor of a revised version of the 1945 constitution, and a plurality of 44 percent voted in favor of the newly drafted national charter. The charter was the more progressive of the two constitutions, its major reforms being the acknowledgement of a role for the state in socioeconomic development, the legalization of a worker self-managed (autogestional) sector in the economy, a unicameral legislature, no presidential re-election, and, for the first time in Ecuador, electoral suffrage for illiterates.
Five candidates then campaigned for the presidency. The consistent favorite in polls was Rodrigo Borja of the social democratic Democratic Left (Izquierda Democrática—ID). Because the Supreme Council of Government made sure that Bucaram was barred from running, the CFP strongman named his second in command, Jaime Roldós Aguilera, to be the party's candidate. In order to broaden the appeal of the ticket, Osvaldo Hurtado, the leader of the Christian Democratic Party (Partido Demócrata Cristiano—PDC), was tapped to be Roldós's vice presidential running mate. The traditional rightist vote was split between two candidates, and the various parties of the Marxist left coalesced to name one candidate. After a lengthy recount, the final results of the July 16 election confirmed the initial tally of a surprise victory by Roldós, with 27 percent of the national vote. Sixto Durán Ballén, candidate of a coalition of rightist parties, finished second with 24 percent. The electoral law mandated that when no candidate achieved a majority vote, a run-off election between the two top finishers be held.
It was more than nine months before the second-round election took place, however. They were months of considerable political tension and doubt as to whether the transition would proceed as planned. First, widespread problems in organizing the election and in the vote count during the first round left serious doubts as to the competence and honesty of the electoral authorities. The Supreme Electoral Tribunal (Tribunal Superior Electoral—TSE) was, as a result, completely reorganized. Second, the government—remembering a campaign slogan calling "Roldós to the government, Bucaram to power"—was understandably dismayed with results of the first-round election. By delaying the second round, the government sought to give rightists the time to build an anti-Roldós coalition under which Durán could emerge as the second-round victor. To complicate matters further, Abdón Calderón Múñoz, a populist candidate who had won 9 percent of the vote in the first round, was murdered under circumstances implicating the government. Finally, as a further distraction during this difficult period, Velasco returned from exile to bury his wife and died in March 1979 at age eighty-six.
The second round was finally held on April 29, 1979, with the Roldós-Hurtado ticket sweeping to an overwhelming 68.5 percent victory against a weak performance by Durán. Doubts persisted, however, up to the moment that the winners took office three months later, that the military would allow them to assume their duly elected offices. The size of their popular mandate and, according to political scientist John D. Martz, pressure from the administration of President Jimmy Carter in Washington made it difficult for the military to stop the "democratization" process at this late date. The military did extract as a price, in any case, unprecedented powers to name representatives to the boards of directors of major state corporations and to participate directly in the naming of the minister of defense. The outgoing government also made it clear to Roldós (who had an early campaign slogan of "we will not forgive, we will not forget") that it would not tolerate any investigation into the behavior of the military with respect to human rights. With his autonomy thus diminished, Roldós finally assumed the presidency on August 10, and thus Ecuador returned to constitutional, civilian rule after almost a decade of dictatorship.

St Mary's Church, Melton Mowbray

St Mary's Church, Melton Mowbray is a parish church in the Church of England located in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire.
Features.
St Mary's Church is the largest and "stateliest" parish church in Leicestershire, with visible remains dating mainly from the 13th-15th centuries. The stonework in the lowest section of the tower, which has Norman windows, dates from 1170, although there were certainly one or more Anglo-Saxon churches on this site before the Norman one. It is built on a plan more usual for cathedrals and the 100-foot tower dominates the town, and is a rare example of a parish church with aisled transepts (one of only five in the country) a feature usually found only in a cathedral. The church has a large choir containing
around 40 members.
The church forms part of the Framland church trail along with 14 other churches in the 'Framland area'. Copies of the guide to the church trail are available from Melton Tourist Information Centre.
Bells and carillon.
The belfry contains ten bells. The earliest bell (No.6) is by John of York dating from the fourteenth century. Most of the rest have been recast. Until 1802 there were only six bells: then two more were added and in 1894 a further two made the total ten. In addition there is a small sanctus bell which dates from the seventeenth century.
The carillon on which the chimes are played three times a day were restored in 1938 through a bequest by Alice Henton. This restoration involved a new clock to replace the previous one dating from the early nineteenth century.
Organ.
The church has a large three manual pipe organ by Haydn Morton of 1929 which was rebuilt by J. W. Walker & Sons Ltd in 1955. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

Thruxton 500

The Thruxton 500 was a 500 mile motorcycle endurance race held at Thruxton Circuit, near Andover in Hampshire, United Kingdom organised by the late Neville Goss, M.B.E., Clerk of the Course of the Southampton and District Motor Cycle Club.
As a production-event for road-based bikes ridden by a team of two riders per machine, in the 1960s the Thruxton 500 race was very important to British motorcycle manufacturers as it was a test of their bikes which provided public-exposure. A win, or second and third places in the Thruxton 500 offered advertising opportunities and boosted sales, so there was keen competition around the fast and demanding track.
Similar events were the Bemsee-organised Hutchinson 100 at Silverstone and the 'Motor Cycle' 500 at Brands Hatch in 1966 where Mike Hailwood demonstrated a Honda CB450 Black Bomber fitted with a sports fairing. It was unable to compete in the 500cc category, the FIM deeming it was not classified as a production machine as it had two overhead camshafts.
Only one motorcycle race a year is now held at Thruxton - a round of the British Superbike Championship
History.
As with many World War II airfields, RAF Thruxton found a new role in the 1950s as a motorcycle racing circuit. Declared surplus to RAF requirements in 1946, the early track included both the runways and perimeter roads. The first race at Thruxton was organised by the Bristol Motorcycle and Light Car Club and took place on 4 August 1952. In 1953, a longer circuit was used but in 1968 the British Automobile Racing Club took over the track and on 1 March 1958 the circuit, which is still in use to this day, saw its first race. 
Racing at Thruxton became famous for the endurance events for production motorcycles, and the "Thruxton 500" in particular. The bikes were supposed to be the same as could be bought, but most factories of the time invested in a racing team that invariably developed the bikes as much as possible. 
The Triumph factory first showed their "Thruxton Bonneville" – a hand-built, extra-specification race-styled machine at the 1964 Earls Court Show, with very-limited production in 1965. 
Due to the long distance, the 500-mile race (originally known as the "Thruxton 9 hour race") was normally shared between two riders.
Motorcycle racing continued on the bumpy wartime tarmac (which was slowly breaking) until 1965, when plans were agreed for a new track. The new layout ignored the original runways and followed the perimeter road with an added chicane and three tight corners in succession (named "Campbell", "Cobb" and "Segrave") which became referred to as the complex.
Due to the poor surface, for 1965 the race was held at Castle Combe and from 1966 to 1968 at Brands Hatch
Triumph at Thruxton.
The Triumph Thruxton 900 is a motorcycle made by Triumph Motorcycles Ltd. Launched in 2004, it was named after the Thruxton Circuit where Triumph won the first three places in 1969, establishing the "cafe racer" era where standard production motorcycles were modified to improve racing performance.
Nortons at Thruxton.
In 1969 the Norton Motorcycle Company set up a development department at Thruxton circuit to support two racing Norton Commandos to represent the company in the Isle of Man TT races and the Thruxton 500. The Nortons achieved success over five seasons, during which time several improvements and modifications were developed.

Sherbet (powder)

Sherbet, kali (Northern English), or keli (Scottish) is a fizzy powder sweet, usually eaten by dipping a lollipop or liquorice, or licking it on a finger.
Etymology.
The word "sherbet" is from Turkish "şerbet", which is from Persian "شربت", which in turn comes from "sharbat", Arabic "sharba" "a drink", from "shariba" "to drink". Also called "sorbet", which comes from French "sorbet", from Italian "sorbetto" and in turn from Turkish "şerbet". The word is cognate to syrup in English. Historically it was a cool effervescent or iced fruit soft drink. The meaning, spelling and pronunciation have fractured between different countries. It is usually spelled "sherbet", but a common pronunciation changes this to "sherbert".
In Northern England, in particular Lancashire, sherbet and kali are two very different confections. Sherbet is generally recognised to be a powder based substance of the type found with liquorice (sherbet fountain). Kali however, is of a crystal form. Often found packaged in straws and available in a variety of colours and flavours. Both sherbet and kali may be fizzy.
History.
Beginning with the 19th century sherbet powder (soda powder) became popular. "Put a spoonful of the powder in a cup of water, mix it and drink it as soon as possible, during the time of sparkling. ... Because this way the most of acid of air is lost ... it is more practicable to put the powder into the mouth and flush it with some water." 2 g of sodium bicarbonate and 1.5 g of tartaric acid were separately packed in little coloured paper bags.
Ingredients.
Sherbet in the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries is a fizzy powder, containing sugar and flavouring, and an edible acid and base. The acid may be tartaric, citric or malic acid, and the base may be sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, or a mixture of these and/or other similar carbonates . To this is added a large amount of sugar to mask the unappetising flavour of the reactive powders, and fruit or cream soda flavouring.
The acid-carbonate reaction occurs upon presence of moisture (juice/saliva). Sherbet used to be stirred into various beverages to make effervescing drinks, in a similar way to making lemonade from "lemonade powders", before canned carbonated drinks became ubiquitous. Sherbet is now used to mean this powder sold as a sweet. (In the United States, it would be somewhat comparable to the powder in Pixy Stix or Fun Dip, though having the fizzy quality of effervescing candy, such as Pop Rocks.)
Delivery methods.
Sherbet has a dual role in the modern sweet world, acting in both solo form and as a decorative agent on other sweets. The most common occurrences are detailed below, but this list is not exhaustive. Dimensions of sherbet include granularity, colour, zing (acidity) and flavouring (normally a citrus fruit).
Sherbet Lemon.
The sherbet lemon is a popular sweet in the UK, and is included in many sweet shops. It is the main flavour of boiled sweets with powdered sherbet
centres - such a sherbet fruits, where sherbet limes, strawberries, blackcurrants, raspberries and orange are popular flavours. The sherbet lemon has a citrus taste and is sour and also tangy. The sherbet in the middle explodes, making the sweet suddenly more sour.
Sherbet Fountain.
Barratt's "Sherbet Fountain" consists of sherbet and a stick made from liquorice, sold since 2009 in a plastic tube with twist-off lid. This replaced the traditional paper packaging with the liquorice stick poking through the end, much to the fury of the traditionalist "Daily Mail" newspaper.
In the traditional paper packaging, the top of the stick was intended to be bitten off to form a straw and the sherbet sucked through it, where it fizzes and dissolves on the tongue. The "new" format only includes a solid liquorice stick, so the sherbet must be licked off that, or eaten directly. This method of consumption was also considered acceptable with the original packaging. This is advertised on the packet as "Sherbet with a liquorice dip". This is a completely different experience to the original paper-wrapped sweet.
The manufacturer, Barratt, is a subsidiary of Tangerine Confectionery.
Fruit flavoured with lollipop.
Sherbet dips or Sherbet Dabs are also popular, such as the Dip Dab by Barratt. They consist of a small packet of sherbet, with a lollipop sealed into the bag. Once the lollipop has been licked, it can be dipped into the sherbet and then sucked clean, alternatively it can simply be used to shovel the sherbet into the mouth.
Another popular type of sherbet dip is the Double Dip by Swizzels Matlow, where the packet is divided into three sections; one contains an edible stick which can be licked and then dipped into the other sections, each of which contains a different flavour of sherbet (for example strawberry, orange, cola).
Sherbet straws.
Plastic straws filled purely with fruit-flavoured sherbet. The most common lengths are 10 cm and 50 cm. The price of these straws range from 5p to £2.00 in the UK depending on size, make and flavour. Normally found in newsagents.
Flying saucers.
Small dimpled discs made from edible coloured paper (rice paper), typically filled with white unflavoured sherbet (the same form as in Sherbet Fountains). The first flying saucers were produced in the 1960s.
Decorator functions.
Sherbet is incorporated into other sweets. For example it is used to give gum based sweets an interesting surface texture and zing (notably cola bottles, fruit strips).
Slang.
Sherbet has been used in parts of both the UK and Australia as slang for an alcoholic drink, especially beer. This use is noted in a slang dictionary as early as 1890, and still appears in list of slang terms written today (especially lists of Australian slang). "We're heading to the pub for a few sherbets." - … pints of beer."
In the UK "Showbiz Sherbet" sometimes refers to cocaine, which is also consumed as a powder.
"Sherbet dab" is used as rhyming slang for a "taxi cab".

Vicsek fractal

In mathematics the Vicsek fractal, also known as Vicsek snowflake or box fractal, is a fractal arising from a construction similar to that of the Sierpinski carpet. It has applications including as compact antennas, particularly in cellular phones.
Construction.
The basic square is decomposed into nine smaller squares in the 3-by-3 grid. The four squares at the corners and the middle square are left, the other squares being removed. The process is repeated recursively for each of the five remaining subsquares. The Vicsek fractal is the set obtained at the limit of this procedure. The Hausdorff dimension of this fractal is formula_1 ≈ 1.46497.
An alternative construction (shown below in the left image) is to remove the four corner squares and leave the middle square and the squares above, below, left and right of it. The two constructions produce identical limiting curves, but one is rotated by 45 degrees with respect to the other.
Properties.
The Vicsek fractal has the surprising property that it has zero area yet an infinite perimeter, due to its non-integer dimension. At each iteration, four squares are removed for every five retained, meaning that at iteration "n" the area is formula_2 (assuming an initial square of side length 1). When "n" approached infinity, the area approaches zero. The perimeter however is formula_3, because each side is divided into three parts and the center one is replaced with three sides, yielding an increase of three to five. The perimeter approaches infinity as "n" increases.
The boundary of the Vicsek fractal is the Type 1 quadratic Koch curve.
Analogues in higher dimensions.
There is a three-dimensional analogue of the Vicsek fractal. It is constructed by subdividing each cube into 27 smaller ones, and removing all but the "center cross", the central cube and the six cubes touching the center of each face. Its Hausdorff dimension is formula_4 ≈ 1.7712.
Similarly to the two-dimensional Vicsek fractal, this figure has zero volume. Each iteration removes retains 7 cubes for every 27, meaning a volume of formula_5 at iteration "n", which approaches zero as "n" approaches infinity.
There exist an inifinite number of cross sections which yield the two-dimensional Vicsek fractal.

Mary FitzAlan

Lady Mary FitzAlan, Duchess of Norfolk (1540 – 23/25 August 1557) was the youngest daughter and child of Henry FitzAlan, 19th Earl of Arundel and his first wife Lady Catherine Grey. Because her only brother had predeceased her, she and her elder sister, Jane FitzAlan were co-heiresses to the earldom of her father. Mary and Jane both received an excellent education. Several of her translations from Greek to Latin have been preserved.
Mary was the first wife of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, whom she married in 1555. They had one son, Philip Howard, 20th Earl of Arundel, born the following year. Mary died eight weeks after the birth of Philip at Arundel House. She was buried on 1 September 1557 in St Clement Danes. 
Upon the death of her father in 1580, the earldom of Arundel passed to the Duke and Duchess of Norfolk's son, Philip.

Colombia–Mexico relations

Colombia–Mexico relations refers to the diplomatic relations between the Republic of Colombia and the United Mexican States; two Latin American nations that are increasingly developing a closer trade and political union with each other.
Diplomatic relations.
Colombia and Mexico both share a common history in that they were both colonized by Spain and each nation was the seat of power of one of four Spanish viceroyalties. Soon after gaining independence in 1820's, the newly independent Mexican empire and Gran Colombia once bordered each other in what are now the independent nations of Costa Rica and Panama. Both nations established diplomatic relation on 3 October 1823.
Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, bot nations have become increasingly close politically and bilaterally. In 1989, both nations, along with Venezuela formed a trade bloc called the Group of 3 "(Grupo de los Tres)" which intended to reduce trade tariffs and create a free trade bloc between the three nations within a ten year time span that took effect in 1995. However, in 2006, former President Hugo Chávez announced that Venezuela would be leaving the bloc due to his estranged relationship with former Mexican President Vicente Fox and former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe. The trade bloc continued without Venezuela until 2007.
Over the past few years, for unfortunate reasons, both nations have become increasingly tangled in the war on drugs. Colombia has for many years been known as one of the biggest producers of drugs and for having notorious cartels. Mexico was traditionally a transit country for Colombia drugs to pass through en route to the United States (the largest demand market for drug consumption). However, Mexico has also become increasingly involved in drug production itself and many Mexican drug cartels have increasingly partnered with Colombian cartels in transiting drugs to other markets globally. Both the Colombian and Mexican government have increasingly worked together to combat the cartels and have hired advisers from each other nations to practice successful tactics in each other's nations respectively.
In June 2012, both nations are founding members of the Pacific Alliance trading bloc along with Chile and Peru; which aims to increase trade with nations of the Pacific rim and to increase political cooperation. Both nations are also mutual members of the United Nations, Organization of American States and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States.
Trade.
Trade between the two nations has increased dramatically over the past ten years. Since 2001, two-way trade between Colombia and Mexico increased by 382%. Total trade between the two nations amounted to $3 billion USD in 2010. Colombia is Mexico's thirteenth biggest trading partner globally. In 2007, Mexico and Colombia signed a new free trade agreement which replaced the now defunct Group of 3 trade bloc which had included Venezuela. Between 1994-2008, Mexican companies invested over $2 billion USD in Colombia, while at the same time, Colombian companies invested $168 million USD in Mexico.

Petals of Blood

Petals of Blood is a novel written by Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o first published in 1977. Set in Kenya just after independence, the story follows four of the novel's major characters - Munira, Abdulla, Wanja, and Karega - whose lives are all intertwined due to the Mau Mau rebellion. In order to escape city life, each retreats to the small, pastoral village of Ilmorog. As the novel progresses, the characters deal with the repercussions of the Mau Mau rebellion as well as with a new, rapidly westernizing Kenya.
The novel largely deals with the scepticism of change after Kenya's liberation from the British Empire, questioning to what extent free Kenya merely emulates, and subsequently perpetuates the oppression found during its time as a colony. Other themes include the challenging of capitalism, politics, and the effects of westernization. Education, schools, and the Mau Mau rebellion are also used to unite the characters, who share a common history with one another.
Background.
"Petals of Blood" was Ngugi's first novel written whilst not in full-time education, instead written over a five-year period. Initially begun whilst teaching at Northwestern University in 1970, the writer continued to work on the novel after his return to Kenya, finally finishing the novel in Yalta as a guest of the Soviet Writers' Union. Ngugi was inspired to write the novel as a way of synthesizing the notion of a postcolonial nation, and a willingness to portray the agents of social change present in Kenya's change from British East Africa. "Petals of Blood" was the last of Ngugi's novels to be written first in English. 
On 30 December 1977, shortly after the release of his play “I Will Marry When I Want,” Ngugi was taken into custody by law enforcement officials and held without charges for questioning. According to Patrick Williams, Ngugi was often criticized by detractors for “dragging politics into art.”
Despite the political tone to his novels, including "Petals of Blood", Ngugi had avoided government interference until deciding to write in his native Gikuyu. After the release of "Petals of Blood", Ngugi wrote and began work on a Gikuyu language play called 'Ngaahika Ndeenda' (I Will Marry When I Want). He was then arrested and detained on 30 December 1977, for crimes relating to his "literary-political" background. After this period, all of his novels would be written first in Gikuyu and later translated into English, a move understood to be a conscious decision to focus more strongly on the peasant workers of Kenya as inspiration for his novels.
Plot summary.
The book begins by describing the four main characters - Munira, Karega, Wanja, and Abdulla - just after the revelation that three prominent Kenyans, two businessmen and one educator, have been killed in a fire. The next chapter moves back in the novel's timeline, focusing on Munira's move to Ilmorog, to begin work as a teacher. He is initially met with suspicion and poor classroom attendance, as the villagers think he will give up on the village soon, in much the same way previous teachers have done. However, Munira stays and, with the friendship of Abdullah, another immigrant to Ilmorog who owns a small shop and bar, carves out a life as a teacher.
Soon Wanja arrives, the granddaughter of the town's oldest and most revered lady. She is an attractive, experienced barmaid who Munira begins to fall in love with, despite the fact he is already married. She too is escaping the city, and begins to work for Abdullah, quickly reshaping his shop, and expanding its bar. Karega arrives in Ilmorog to seek Munira to question him about their old school Siriana. After a brief relationship with Munira, Wanja once again grows disillusioned and leaves Ilmorog. The year of her departure is not good for the village as the weather is harsh and no rains come, making for a poor harvest. In an attempt to enact changes, the villagers are inspired by Karega to journey to Nairobi in order to talk to their Member of Parliament.
The journey is very arduous and Joseph, a boy that Abdullah had taken in as his brother and who had worked in his shop, becomes ill. When they arrive in Nairobi, the villagers seek help from every quarter. They are turned away by a reverend who thinks they are merely beggars, despite their pleas of help for the sick child. Trying at another house, some of the villagers are rounded up and forced into the building where they are questioned by Kimeria, a ruthless businessman who reveals that he and their MP are in league with one another. He blackmails Wanja, and subsequently rapes her. Upon arriving in Nairobi and speaking to their MP, the villagers realise that nothing will change, as he is little more than a demagogue. However, they do meet a lawyer who wishes to help them and others in the same predicament and through a court case highlights Ilmorog's plight. This draws attention from national press and donations and charities pour into Ilmorog.
Finally, the rains comes, and the villagers celebrate with ancient rituals and dances. During this time, Karega starts a correspondence with the lawyer that he met in Nairobi, wishing to educate himself further. To celebrate the rain's coming, Nyakinyua brews a drink from the Thang'eta plant, which all of the villagers drink. Karega tells the story the love between him and Mukami, the older sister of Munira. Mukami's father looked down on Karega because of his brother's involvement with the Mau Mau. Forced to separate, Mariamu and Karega do not see each other again, and Mukami later commits suicide by jumping into a quarry. This is the first time Munira hears the story. Later, an unknown plane crashes in the village; the only victim is Abdulla's donkey. Wanja notices that there are several large groups of people who come to survey the wreckage, and suggests to Abdulla that they begin to sell the Thang'eta drink in Abdulla's bar. The drink attracts notoriety, and many people come to the bar in order to sample it. Out of fury for Karega's connection to his family and jealousy of his relationship with Wanja, Munira schemes to have Karega fired from his teaching post with the school. Karega then leaves Ilmorog.
Development arrives in Ilmorog as the government begin to build the Trans-Africa road through the village, which brings an increase in trade. Karega returns to Ilmorog, telling of his slow spiral into alcoholism before finally securing work in a factory. After getting fired from the factory, he returns to Ilmorog. The change in Ilmorog is rapid, and the villages changes into the town of New Ilmorog. The farmers are told that they should fence off their land and mortgage parts of it to ensure that they own a finite area. They are offered loans which are linked to their harvest turnout to pay for this expense. Nyakinyua dies and the banks move to take her land. To prevent this Wanja sells her business and buys Nyakinyua's land. She opens up a successful brothel in the town, and is herself one of the prostitutes. Munira goes to see her to attempt to rekindle their romance, but is met with only a demand for money. He pays, and the couple have sex. Karega goes to see Wanja who both still have strong feelings for each other, but after disagreeing about how to live he leaves. Wanja plans to separate herself finally from the men who have exploited her during her life, wanting to bring them to her brothel with all of her prostitutes sent away so that she could present the downtrodden but noble Abdulla as her chosen partner. Meanwhile, Munira is watching the brothel, and sees Karega arrive, and then leave. In a religious fervour, he pours petrol on the brothel, sets it alight, and retreats to a hill to watch it burn. Wanja escapes but is hospitalized due to smoke inhalation; the other men Wanja had invited died in the fire. Munira is sentenced with arson; later, Karega learns that the corrupt local MP was gunned down in his car whilst waiting for his chauffeur in Nairobi.
Explanation of the novel's title.
The title "Petals of Blood" is derived from a line of Derek Walcott's poem 'The Swamp'. The poem suggests that there is a deadly power within nature that must be respected despite attempts to suggest by humans that they live harmoniously with it.
Originally called 'Ballad of a Barmaid', it is unclear why Ngugi changed the title before release. The phrase "petals of blood" appears several times throughout the novel, with varying associations and meanings. Initially, "petals of blood" is first used by a pupil in Munira's class to describe a flower. Munira quickly chastises the boy, saying that 'there is no colour called blood'. Later, the phrase is used to describe flames, as well relating to virginity during one of Munira's sexual fantasies.
Major Themes.
Corruption.
One primary underlining theme in "Petals of Blood" is the failure of the ruling Kenyan elite to adequately meet the needs of the people. After the new postcolonial governments come to power, the leaders maintain their connections with the outgoing colonizers, thus marginalizing the everyman. In the novel, the elite are portrayed as both government officials and businessmen who violate the villagers of Ilmorog in both passive and aggressive ways. The corrupt system acts like a chain—in the novel, when the government’s lawyers declare that they have solved the murder cases, the people of Ilmorog realize that as long as the corrupt system stays in place and continues churning out corrupt individuals, there will be no change.
Ngugi makes the dichotomy between the villagers (the honest working class) and the elite (corruption) most visible in the speech that Nyakinyua gives before the villagers, which motivates them to make the trip to Nairobi. She says, “I think we should go. It is our turn to make things happen. There was a time when things happened the way we in Ilmorog wanted them to happen. We had power over the movement of our limbs. We made up our own words and sang them and we danced to them. But there came a time when this power was taken from us…. We must surround the city and demand back our share” (pp. 115-116). However, along their way, they are unjustly detained by Kimeria the businessman, who reveals that he is colluding with the MP, and who afterwards rapes Wanja.
Capitalism.
Capitalism is decried in "Petals of Blood", with the new Kenyan elite portrayed as controlled by the 'faceless system of capitalism'. The everyman loses out to capitalist endeavours, and is essentially exploited by the new Kenyan elite. Farmers are forced to mark out their lands and mortgage them with loans linked to the success of their harvest; as the quality of the harvests waver, many are forced to sell their land, unable to match their loan repayments. Thang'eta is another symbol of capitalism. Taken from a drink that Nyakinyua brews in a traditional ceremony, it is soon marketed, and becomes extremely popular. Wanja, who introduces the drink to Abdulla's bar, is then exploited by big business who forces her to stop her Thang'eta operation. Neither she nor Munira, who creates the slogan, receive the fruits of their labour. Originally a drink used to help people relax and escape their current problems, it becomes 'a drink of strife'.
Cities are portrayed as places where capitalism flourishs and are contrasted strongly with the village of Ilmorog. In its pursuit for the modern, Kenya adopts capitalism at the expense of tradition as the city begins 'to encroach upon and finally swallow the traditional and the rural.' As time progresses, Ilmorog changes vastly, as do the people that inhabit it. With its modernization, influenced greatly by capitalism and the chance to increase trade, Munira reflects on these changes and how they link with capitalism, saying that 'it was New Kenya. It was New Ilmorog. Nothing was free.'
Land.
Agriculture is an important theme in "Petals of Blood", most notably in the town of Ilmorog, an isolated, pastoral community. After modernization, the farmers lands are fenced off and ultimately seized when they cannot repay their loans. Although none of the main characters lose their land in this way (Wanja, however, sells her family's plot), it is significant in that Kenya recreates what happened during colonial rule: the loss of land and subsequent desire to reclaim it was "the central claim" for those who rebelled against the settlers.
The notion of land and fertilisation is often linked to Wanja, who is seen as the embodiment of these concepts. As she is portrayed as "the symbol of the nation", the loss of her land to the new Kenyan elite is an important parallel with Ngugi's depiction of Kenya. Land is also linked to Kenya itself, with Ngugi suggesting that anyone who sells their land is a traitor.
Education.
Education is often depicted cynically in "Petals of Blood". Munira is a teacher, but lacks strong abilities to guide his pupils, instead preferring to stand back and not to assert any of his own beliefs. He rejects the claims of others that the children should be taught more about being African, instead preferring that they be taught politics, and things which are "fact". Two of the three "betrayers of the people", those who are ultimately murdered, are also educators; they are untrustworthy, and depict the education system as a "problematic institution" in independent Kenya. 
Although there is a brief suggestion that education does provide hope, as Joseph succeeds academically at Siriana, it the education system as a whole which is criticized. The notion of education as self-liberating is critiqued, as Joseph's success is still within the Siriana school, previously a bastion of "European" education. In a more political sense, Karega's self-education causes him to doubt his initial belief that education was a tool to gain liberation; originally taken in by the lawyer's socialist rhetoric, Karega's dealings with education ultimately leave him disillusioned.
Style.
"Petals of Blood" relies heavily on flashbacks, using the points of view of the four major characters to piece together previous events. As each character is questioned by the police, the novel takes on certain characteristics of the detective novel, with a police offer trying to ascertain details of their pasts in order to find the murderer of Chui, Kimeria, and Mzigo. The flashbacks also encompass several different timeframes. The present day action takes place over the course of 10 days; the past events take places over 12 years. Ngugi also discusses Kenya's past, going as far back as 1896, when Kenya was "annexed" by the British.
The narrative voice shifts between Munira and the other characters describing the events of their lives, and an omniscient narrator. There is also a suggestion of a communal narrative voice, as Ngugi draws on the mythic past of Kenya to place the novel in a wider context than simply the colonial. This communal voice is at work through the various Gikuyu songs with which Ngugi intersperses the novel; there is a great reliance placed on such songs, which help tell, through the oral tradition of linking of proverbs and fables, the history of Ilmorog and Kenya before colonial intervention.
Reception.
"Petals of Blood" caused a stronger critical reaction than Ngugi's previous novels. The use of the past and historical memory is far more widespread in the novel due largely to the use of flashbacks, and questions relating to the past "from the central concerns" of the novel. The strong political motif that runs throughout the novel has also been discussed, focusing on the relation of political ideas to the "Petals of Blood"'s wider framework: Ngugi was lauded for his "successful marriage" of political content and artistic form.
During the 1980s the novel was adapted by Mary Benson into a two hour long radio play starring Joe Marcel by BBC Radio 3.
Ngugi was criticised however for his stylistic form in "Petals of Blood". It was suggested that the social realism of the novel did not accurately represent or complement the socialist ideals put forth. John Updike suggested that Ngugi's desire to permeate the plot with political ideas detracts from his writing. The novel's plot was also deemed to be "rambling" as well as being too short, or too much curtailed.

Shakes versus Shav

Shakes versus Shav (1949) is a puppet play written by George Bernard Shaw. It was Shaw's penultimate dramatic work. The play runs for 20 minutes in performance.
The play was written by Shaw for the Lanchester Marionettes who were based in their own theatre in Foley House, Malvern, Worcestershire, UK. The company's founders, Waldo and Muriel Lanchester, performed regularly in the Malvern Festival. Shaw, having seen their performances over the years, wrote "Shakes Versus Shav" for the company in 1949. The play comprises a comic argument between the two playwrights, as a form of intellectual equivalent of Punch and Judy.
In 2007 it was revived by Henry Bell at the Orange Tree Theatre with Dudley Hinton and John Paul Connelly playing the parts written for puppets. John Thaxter of The Stage described it as 'history making'.
Plot summary.
William Shakespeare challenges Shaw as an upstart, quoting lines from his own plays. Shaw claims that "Macbeth" has been bettered by Scott's novel "Rob Roy", and "proves" the point by staging a fight between the ghosts of the two Scots, which Rob Roy wins. 
Shaw then asserts that Adam Lindsay Gordon has outdone Shakespeare's verse, quoting the lines "The beetle booms adown the glooms/And bumps among the clumps" (in fact a garbled version of lines by James Whitcomb Riley). Shakespeare laughs at this. He tells Shaw that he could never have written "Hamlet" or "King Lear". Shaw replies that Shakespeare could not have written "Heartbreak House", and creates a pastiche of his own play with the characters posed in imitation of Millais's painting "The North-West Passage". 
Shakespeare defends the emotional power of his work. Shaw defends the practical value of his. Shaw ends by quoting Shakespeare's own words and bringing into being a small light to symbolise his own reputation. Shakespeare puts out the light and the play ends.
Puppets.
Waldo Lanchester carved the six marionettes (heads were carved by Jack Whitehead) and Muriel costumed them, having sought advice from Scotland on the correct tartans. The Shaw puppet is now housed in the George Bernard Shaw Museum, Shaw's Corner, at Ayot St Lawrence, the Shakespeare puppet is in the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust and the other four puppets - MacBeth, Rob Roy, Captain Shotover and his Daughter - are in the Staffordshire County Museum at Shugborough Hall.

is a non-governmental organisation, that is a pressure group and often referred to as the first ever Sikh political party in the United Kingdom. SFUK is based on the ‘miri-piri’ principle the Sikh principle that temporal and spiritual goals are indivisible.
The organisation was established in September 2003 with the aim of giving Sikhs a stronger political voice by taking an increasing interest in mainstream politics in the UK.
Aims and Objectives.
To work closely with each of the main political parties in the UK to promote relevant issues set out in the Sikh Agenda for the UK Government.
The main areas of work for the Sikh Federation (UK) are:
• Promote the Sikh religion, philosophy and way of life - working within the Sikh community and with local and national government;
• Promote sporting and educational activities as well as relevant cultural issues directly associated with the Sikh way of life;
• Campaign for human rights issues impacting on Sikhs in the UK and abroad - working with human rights groups, non-governmental organisations and politicians;
• Argue the case for the Sikhs right to self-determination and lobbying politicians, the UK Government, official representatives of foreign governments in the UK, the European Parliament and at the United Nations for the establishment of an independent sovereign Sikh State of Khalistan.
Goals and activities.
Building a stronger political voice in the UK & abroad
The Sikh Agenda
An eight-point Sikh Agenda for the UK Government launched in September 2001 at Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara, Wolverhampton, revealed a diverse range of aims and objectives for the Sikh community in the UK, which are as follows:
Agenda Item 1 - British Sikhs and the establishment
• Increased participation in local and national decision making bodies - the number of public appointments for Sikhs to increase from around 50 to 300 in the next three to four years. 
• Greater political representation, particularly from practising Sikhs - four more Sikh MPs, five new Sikh Lords and an increase in the number of councillors from about 90 to 200 in the next three to four years. 
• Fairer representation in employment - in terms of numbers and seniority in local government, central government, the media, the police and the armed forces. 
• Greater participation and representation - in all areas from practicing Sikh women.
Agenda Item 2 - Government funding for Sikh organisations 
• A fair share for Sikh organisations and Sikh projects - For example, Sikh organisations need to aim to obtain £20 million of the annual funding available from the independent distributing bodies.
Agenda Item 3 - Promotion of the Sikh identity and the Panjabi language 
• Recognition and separate monitoring by public authorities - this assists in obtaining fair treatment as regards employment and the provision of public services to the Sikh community. 
• Increased understanding and awareness of the Sikh religion, the Sikh identity and the Sikh articles of faith - a government supported Sikh Awareness Week in April 2004. 
• Removal of all restrictions on Sikh articles of faith e.g. Kesh, Kirpan, Kara, Turban etc. at work, in business and in public places. 
• Panjabi as a modern language option for school children - this would implement the motion passed by the National Association of Head Teachers that the national curriculum be changed to bring this about.
Agenda Item 4 – Sikhs and Education 
• National Curriculum - secure changes to better reflect the Sikh religion, Sikh way of life and Sikh history. 
• Increased awareness of Sikhism in schools - through the provision of school assemblies about Sikhism, recognition of the right of Sikh children to take religious holidays without being penalised and the provision of suitable food reflecting the specific needs of Sikhs. 
• State funded Sikh schools - parity of treatment with other faith groups in terms of overall numbers and provision of relevant resources.
Agenda Item 5 - Preserving Sikh heritage 
• Working with the UK Government and its agencies to preserve Sikh heritage and promote a wider appreciation of the rich cultural heritage of the Sikh Nation.
Agenda Item 6 - Protecting the human rights of Sikhs and humanitarian aid 
• Travel - Ensure the UK Government removes unnecessary travel restrictions and stops harassment
at airports and seaports of law-abiding Sikhs wishing to travel to and from the UK regardless of whether they are politically active or not. 
• Sikh human rights abuses in India - Seek action from the UK Government on the continuing abuse of Sikh and other minority groups human rights by the Indian authorities. Particular attention should be directed at individual cases, such as that of Professor Davinderpal Singh Bhullar. 
• 1984 massacres - Highlight the lack of justice for Sikhs in India following the massacre in November 1984 of tens of thousands of innocent Sikhs in several cities across India, including Delhi, which involved government officials and politicians of the ruling political bloc encouraging and leading well-orchestrated gangs. 
• Human rights abusers travelling to the UK - Urge the UK Government to take appropriate action against individual Indian politicians, police officers and army personnel, if and when they visit the UK, who have been implicated or directly involved in the murder, torture, abuse and disappearances of Sikhs in India. 
• Humanitarian assistance for victims of human rights abuses - Encourage the UK Government to work with British Sikhs to provide financial support and humanitarian assistance to orphaned children and bereaved Sikh family members and those who have suffered from torture, false imprisonment, human rights abuses and state oppression in the Indian subcontinent. 
• Status and rights of women - Highlight the plight of women in the Indian subcontinent, including abortion of female foetuses after scanning, dowry deaths and honour killings. Encourage the UK government to link development programmes in the subcontinent with projects to empower women.
Agenda Item 7 - Self determination for the Sikh Nation 
• Right to self determination - Lobby the UK Government, official representatives of foreign governments in the UK, the European Parliament and at the UN to accept the Sikh Nation’s right to self-determination enshrined in International Covenants on Economic, Social, Cultural, Civil and Political Rights. 
• Lobby the UK Government, official representatives of foreign governments in the UK, the European Parliament and at the UN for a change in policy towards the Indian subcontinent so that it adequately reflects the Sikh Nation's desire for self-determination and complements the need to reduce the threat of nuclear war. 
• Khalistan - Make known and explain the reasons why Sikhs want to establish an independent sovereign state of Khalistan to the British public, political organisations and the UK Government.
Agenda Item 8 – Challenging the ban and restrictions on Sikh organisations 
• Removal of the ban on the International Sikh Youth Federation (ISYF) - Increase political pressure on the UK Government to have the ban removed in the UK and to clear the name of the many thousands that previously belonged to and associated with the ISYF since 1984. 
• Release of frozen funds - Urge the UK Government to release funds held in UK bank accounts that were frozen after 9/11. These relate to assistance provided to orphaned children, bereaved Sikh family members and those that are suffering from false imprisonment and human rights abuses in the Indian sub-continent. 
• Work with Sikhs in European countries, Canada, USA and Australia to lobby individual governments, the European Parliament and the UN to have restrictions removed against Sikh organisations from holding funds that were imposed erroneously following 9/11 and the passing of a UN order. 
• Brief Parliamentarians, including those responsible for the review of anti-terrorism legislation, on the impact and inappropriate nature of restrictions on British Sikh organisations and individuals. To put in perspective the motivations of those seeking such restrictions, given the wider political context, propaganda and underlying reality of the status of Sikhs in India.

Félix Potin

Félix Potin is the name of a French businessman and his eponymous mass-distribution retail business, founded in the mid-nineteenth century. While the business was bought out and then collapsed in the second half of the twentieth century, the brand has been revived by a contemporary distribution network.
Biography.
Jean-Louis-Félix Potin was born in 1820 in Arpajon, in what is today the Île-de-France region surrounding Paris. He died in 1871.
The business.
History.
Félix Potin opened his first shop at 28 rue Coquenard in Paris in 1844, at the age of just 24. This was followed by numerous other branches operating under the same name. In 1860, he opened the first two-level, large-area retailer on the Boulevard de Sébastopol in Paris. The following year he constructed a Félix Potin factory in La Villette, in the northern outskirts of Paris.
The Félix Potin network experienced remarkable success during the late Second Empire and early Third Republic. In 1864 he expanded the Villette factory and opened a boutique on the Boulevard Malesherbes. In 1870 he started a home-delivery service. The business continued to grow after its founder's death, with a second factory in 1880 and a second large shop on Rue de Rennes in 1904. Félix Potin factories employed 1,800 workers in 1906, growing to 8,000 by 1927. By 1923, the Félix Potin name counted 70 branches, 10 factories, 5 wine stores and 650 horses.
The business survived in more or less the same form until 1956, when the 1,200 shops became minimarkets, which were bought out by Greek-French entrepreneur André Mentzelopoulos in 1958. After a period of poor management, this business collapsed and was liquidated in 1996, with the Promodès chain buying a few of the points of sale. In 2003, the "Société Philippe Potin" acquired the right to use the Félix Potin name for its distribution network in South-East France.
Business model.
When Félix Potin founded his business, a standard business model was to receive loads of goods from a manufacturer, then label and package them in store. By contrast, Félix Potin shops sold products produced and prepackaged at the chain's own factories, then sold them at standardised, publicised prices. Potin aimed to sell large volumes at reduced profit margins. Potin was thus a pioneer of the chain-and-branch, bulk-buying model of retail, unifying distribution and sales under the same brand. Frank Winfield Woolworth's eponymous five-and-dime chain in the US was, to some extent, a revival and development of Potin's model.
Architecture.
The architect Paul Auscher (1866–1932) designed several buildings for Félix Potin. The distinctive turrets bearing Félix Potin's name can still be seen on the Boulevard de Sébastopol (now a Monoprix) and Rue de Rennes (now a Zara).

George Bemis (lawyer)

George Bemis (October 13, 1816 – January 5, 1878) was an American lawyer and legal scholar. He was involved with many unique cases and was an advocate of international law and the reform of the treatment of criminals.
Early life and education.
George was born at Watertown, Massachusetts, the youngest son of Seth and Sarah (Wheeler) Bemis. A conscientious and diligent student, at the age of 13, he passed the entrance exam to Harvard College in 1829. Instead of enrolling at such a young age, he continued with his studies for three more years. He matriculated into the sophomore class in 1832 and graduated in 1835. He continued his studies by enrolling in Harvard Law School. He completed his formal education in 1839 and was admitted into the Massachusetts Bar in July 1839. 
Career.
Bemis was one of the most esteemed lawyers in Boston during the 1850s and developed a profitable law practice while being involved in many famous legal proceedings. Bemis was a crusader for reform of the penal code in Massachusetts, especially laws that allowed a defendant's previous convictions to extend his current sentence.
In 1843 he was involved with the case of Abner Rodgers, an inmate at the Massachusetts State Penitentiary accused of killing the warden of that prison. During his defense of Rodgers, Bemis argued that the man was insane and not responsible for his actions. Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw issued an opinion that became the American authority on insanity pleas during criminal prosecution.
The second major case that Bemis was involved in was the Parkman-Webster murder case. Bemis acted as co-counsel to Massachusetts Attorney General John H. Clifford in prosecuting Harvard professor John White Webster for the death of George Parkman. Bemis was selected and paid $1,500 by the Parkman family to represent their interests in the case against Webster. This case was one of the first to use forensic dentistry and circumstantial evidence to prove a defendant's guilt.
In addition to serving as a lawyer for these landmark cases, he also acted as a court reporter during each trial. He eventually published his notes on each trial as the official transcription of the cases. The author Robert Sullivan, in his book on the case, characterized the published transcripts from the Webster trial were considered to be heavily edited and "slanted" to justify the execution of Dr. Webster.
In 1858 Bemis suffered a hemorrhage in his lungs while arguing a case regarding railroads. Subsequently he moved to southern France for the remainder of his life. During this time in Europe, he focused on the study of public law; he published many pamphlets about neutrality in response to British positions on these topics. He died in Nice, France on January 18, 1878.

Causes of the Holodomor

The Holodomor () is the name of the famine that ravaged Soviet Ukraine in 1932–1933. Estimates for the total number of casualties within Soviet Ukraine range between 2.2 million and 10 million.
The causes of the Holodomor are a subject of scholarly and political debate. Some historians theorize that the famine was an unintended consequence of the economic problems associated with radical economic changes implemented during the period of Soviet industrialization.
Others claim that the Soviet policies that caused the famine were an engineered attack on Ukrainian nationalism, or more broadly, on all peasants, in order to prevent uprisings. Some suggest that the famine may fall under the legal definition of genocide.
Deliberately engineered or Continuation of civil war.
Overview.
During the 1930s, the Soviet Union was dominated by Joseph Stalin, who sought to reshape Soviet society with aggressive economic planning. As the leader of the Soviet Union, he constructed a massive bureaucracy that was responsible for millions of deaths as a result of repressive policies. During his time as leader of the Soviet Union, Stalin made frequent use of his secret police, prisons, and nearly unlimited power to reshape Soviet society.
A campaign of political repression, including arrests, deportations, and executions of better-off peasants and their families occurred from 1929 to 1932. The richer peasants were labeled "kulaks" and considered class enemies. More than 1.8 million peasants were deported in 1930–1931.
The "liquidation of the kulaks as a class" was announced by Stalin on December 27, 1929. The decision was formalized in a resolution, "On measures for the elimination of kulak households in districts of comprehensive collectivization", on January 30, 1930. The kulaks were divided into three categories: those to be shot or imprisoned as decided by the local secret political police; those to be sent to Siberia, North, the Urals, or Kazakhstan, after confiscation of their property; and those to be evicted from their houses and used in labour colonies within their own districts.
The combination of the elimination of kulaks, collectivization, and other repressive policies contributed to mass starvation in many parts of the Soviet Ukraine and the death of at least 7 to 10 million peasants in 1930–1937.
Requisition quotas.
Sources such as "Encyclopædia Britannica" say there was no physical basis for famine in Ukraine, and that Soviet authorities set quotas for Ukraine at exceedingly high levels. The famine was caused by the food requisition actions carried out by the Soviet authorities. The government plans for central grain collection in Ukraine were lowered by 18.1% relative to the 1931 plan. Collective farms were expected to return 132,750 tons of grain, the amount that had been provided in spring 1932 as aid. The grain collection plan for July 1932 was adopted to collect 19.5 million poods. The actual state of collection was disastrous, and by July 31 only 3 million poods (compared to 21 million in 1931) were collected. The total amount of grain collected by February 5, 1933 was only 255 million poods (compared to 440 million poods in 1931).
In 1930 the Ukraine provided 27% of the Soviet harvest but 38% of the deliveries. In 1931 it made 42% of deliveries. The Ukrainian harvest fell from 23.9 million tons to 18.3 but the same quota, 7.7 million tons, was demanded, 7 million was collected. 7.7 was again demanded in 1932, reduced to 6.6, only 4.7 was collected.
Criminalised gleaning.
Gleaning is the act of collecting leftover crops from farmers' fields after they have been commercially harvested or from fields where it is not economically profitable to harvest. Some ancient cultures promoted gleaning as an early form of a welfare system. In the Soviet Union, people who gleaned and distributed food brought themselves under legal risk. The Law of Spikelets criminalised gleaning under penalty of death, or ten years of forced labour in exceptional circumstances.
Some sources claim there were several legislative acts adopted in order to force starvation in the Ukrainian SSR. On August 7, 1932, the Soviet government passed a law, "On the Safekeeping of Socialist Property", that imposed penalties starting at a ten-year prison sentence and up to the death penalty for any theft of socialist property. Stalin personally appended the stipulation: "People who encroach on socialist property should be considered enemies of the people." Within the first five months of passage of the law, 54,645 individuals had been imprisoned under it, and 2,110 sentenced to death. The initial wording of the decree, "On fought with speculation”, adopted August 22, 1932, led to common situations where minor acts such as bartering tobacco for bread were documented as punished by 5 years imprisonment. After 1934, by NKVD demand, the penalty for minor offenses was limited to a fine of 500 rubles or three months of correctional labor.
The scope of this law, colloquially dubbed the "law of the wheat ears", included even the smallest appropriation of grain by peasants for personal use. A little over a month later, the law was revised, as Politburo protocols revealed that secret decisions had later modified the original decree of September 16, 1932. The Politburo approved a measure that specifically exempted small-scale theft of socialist property from the death penalty, declaring that "organizations and groupings destroying state, social, and co-operate property in an organized manner by fires, explosions and mass destruction of property shall be sentenced to execution without trial", and listed a number of cases in which "kulaks, former traders, and other socially-alien persons" would be subject to the death penalty. "Working individual peasants and collective farmers" who stole "kolkhoz" property and grain would be sentenced to ten years; the death penalty would be imposed only for "systematic theft of grain, sugar beets, animals, etc."
Soviet expectations for the 1932 grain crop were high because of Ukraine's bumper crop the previous year, which Soviet authorities believed were sustainable. When it became clear that the 1932 grain deliveries were not going to meet the expectations of the government, the decreased agricultural output was first blamed on the kulaks, and later on agents and spies of foreign intelligence services, "nationalists", "Petlurovites", and from 1937 on, Trotskyists. According to a report from the head of the Supreme Court, by January 15, 1933 as many as 103,000 people (more than 14 thousand in the Ukrainian SSR) had been sentenced under the provisions of the August 7 decree. Of the 79,000 whose sentences were known to the Supreme Court, 4,880 had been sentenced to death, 26,086 to ten years of imprisonment, and 48,094 to other punishments.
On November 8, Molotov and Stalin issued an order stating, "from today the dispatch of goods for the villages "of all regions of Ukraine" shall cease until kolkhozy and individual peasants begin to honestly and conscientiously fulfill their duty to the working class and the Red Army by delivering grain."
On November 24, the Politburo ordered that all those sentenced to confinement of three years or more in Ukraine be deported to labor camps. It also simplified procedures for confirming death sentences in Ukraine. The Politburo also dispatched Balytsky to Ukraine for six months with the full powers of the OGPU.
Blacklist system.
Some researchers claim that in December 1932, Soviets imposed special sanctions and blockade by NKVD units which led to complete extermination by starvation of certain villages and areas. The blacklist was applied with harsher methods to selected villages and kolkhozes that were considered to be "underperforming" in the grain collection procurement: “Immediate cessation of delivery of goods, complete suspension of cooperative and state trade in the villages, and removal of all available goods from cooperative and state stores. Full prohibition of collective farm trade for both collective farms and collective farmers, and for private farmers. Cessation of any sort of credit and demand for early repayment of credit and other financial obligations.” Initially, such sanctions were applied to only six villages, but later they were applied to numerous rural settlements and districts. For peasants, who were not kolkhoz members and who were "underperforming" in the grain collection procurement, special measures were adopted. To reach the grain procurement quota amongst peasants, 1100 brigades were organized, which consisted of activists, often from neighboring villages, who had either already accomplished their grain procurement quota or were close to accomplishing it.
Since most of the goods supplied to the rural areas were commercial (fabrics, matches, fuels) and sometimes obtained by villagers from neighboring cities or railway stations, sanctioned villages remained thus for a long period — as an example mentioned in the December 6 decree, the village of Kamyani Potoky was removed from blacklist on October 17, 1933, when they completed their plan for grain collection early. After January 1933, the blacklist regime was modified, with 100% plan execution no longer required. As mentioned in the December 6 Decree, the villages Liutenky and Havrylivka were removed from the black list after 88% and 70% plan completion, respectively.
Measures were taken to persecute those withholding or bargaining grain. This was done frequently by requisition detachments, which raided farms to collect grain. This was done regardless of whether or not the peasants retained enough grain to feed themselves or enough seed left to plant the next harvest.
Restrictions on freedom of movement.
Some sources state that Ukrainian SSR borders were sealed by the NKVD and the army in order to prevent starving peasants from travelling into territories where food was more available. Some researchers believe these measures extended to urban areas inside Ukrainian SSR. During the First Five-Year Plan, urban population growth brought more than 10 million people from villages to cities; the number receiving food rations increased from 25 million in 1930 to 40 million in 1932. Food production declined and urban food supplies fell drastically. Reserves did not keep pace with ration requirements. Desertion of factories, combined with peasants' flight from collective farms, resulted in millions of people moving around the country. In response, the government revived the tsarist institution of internal passports at the end of 1932.
Special barricades were set up by GPU units throughout the Soviet Union to prevent an exodus of peasants from hunger-stricken regions. During a single month in 1933, 219,460 people were either intercepted and escorted back or arrested and sentenced. In Ukraine, these measures had the following results, according to the declassified documents: During the 11 days (January 23–February 2) after the January 22, 1933 decree, 3,861 people were intercepted, of which 340 were arrested "for further recognition". During the same period, there were 16,773 people intercepted (907 of those not living in Ukraine)in trains and at railway stations on the whole Ukrainian territory; out of those, 1,610 people were arrested. These figures also included criminals. In the same document, the GPU states that 94,433 peasants had already left the Ukrainian territory during the period from December 15, 1932 to January 2, 1933 (data for 215 districts out of 484, and Moldavian ASRR). It has been estimated that there were some 150,000 excess deaths as a result of this policy, and one historian asserts that these deaths constitute a crime against humanity.
The government introduced new identity papers and obligatory registration for citizens in December 1932. Initially, the area of new identity papers and obligatory registration implementation was limited to Moscow, Leningrad (encircling 100 km), and Kharkiv (encircling 50 km), and the new measures were planned for implementation by June 1933. In Ukraine, introduction of the passport system was to be carried out by the end of 1933, with top priority given to its enforcement in Kharkiv, Kiev, and Odessa.
Travel from Ukraine and the Northern Caucasus Kuban "kray" region was specifically forbidden by the directives of January 22, 1933 (signed by Molotov and Stalin) and of January 23, 1933 (joint directive Central Committee of the Communist Party and Sovnarkom). February 16, 1933, the same measures were applied to the Lower-Volga region. After February, the directives stated that travel "for bread" from these areas was organized by enemies of the Soviet Union, with the purpose of agitation in northern areas of the Soviet Union against kolkhozes, but was not prevented. Therefore, railway tickets were to be sold only by "ispolkom" permits, and those who had already reached the north should be arrested.
Information blockade.
Some sources claim that the Soviet regime, by preventing news of the famine from reaching the outside world, prevented foreign sources from providing aid to alleviate the famine and associated hardships. Some claim the same thing happened during the earlier 1921–23 famine in the Soviet Union. With regard to the earlier famine, some researchers say initial Soviet pleas for aid in early autumn 1921 were refused by European countries, and what aid was eventually provided didn't come for four or five months, so the Soviet government may not have expected the outside world to be very helpful in this instance either.
On February 23, 1933, the Politburo of Central Committee adopted a decree requiring foreign journalists to seek travel permits from the General Directorate of Militia before entering the affected areas. Also, the Soviet government denied initial reports of the famine (but agreed with information about malnutrition), while preventing foreign journalists from traveling in the region. At the same time, there was no credible evidence of information blockade arrangements on a considerable number of foreign specialists (engineers, workers, etc.) who worked at construction sites at Ukrainian territory.
For example Gareth Jones, one of David Lloyd George’s private secretaries, spent several days in mid-March travelling to “all twenty villages, not only in the Ukraine, but also in the black earth district, and in the Moscow region, and... I slept in peasants' cottages, and did not immediately leave for the next village”. He reached the neighboring rural area of Kharkiv (the capital of Soviet Ukraine), spent some days there, and despite seeing no dead people or animals himself, reported “that there was famine in the Soviet Union”.
On August 23, 1933, foreign correspondents were warned individually by the press section of the Foreign Office of the Soviet Union not to attempt to travel to the provinces or elsewhere in the Soviet Union without first obtaining formal permission. The Foreign Office of the Soviet Union, without explanation, refused permission to William H. Chamberlain, "Christian Science Monitor" correspondent, to visit and observe the harvest in the principal agricultural regions of the North Caucasus and Ukraine. From May–July 1933, two other American correspondents were forbidden to make a trip to Ukraine. Such restrictions were softened in September 1933.
Scholars who have conducted research in declassified archives have reported "the Politburo and regional Party committees insisted that immediate and decisive action be taken in response to the famine such that 'conscientious farmers' not suffer, while district Party committees were instructed to supply every child with milk and decreed that those who failed to mobilize resources to feed the hungry or denied hospitalization to famine victims be prosecuted."
By the end of 1933, based on data collected by undercover investigation and photos, the Bohemian-Austrian Cardinal Theodor Innitzer began an awareness-raising campaign in the West about the massive deaths by hunger and occasional cases of cannibalism that were occurring in Ukraine and the North Caucasus at that time.
Refusal to provide aid for starving.
Some sources claim that, despite the pleas for assistance and the acknowledged famine situation, the Moscow authorities refused to provide aid; some researchers state that aid was provided only during the summer. The first reports regarding malnutrition and hunger in rural areas and towns (which were undersupplied through the recently introduced rationing system) to the Ukrainian GPU and "oblast" authorities are dated to mid-January 1933. However, the first food aid sent by Central Soviet authorities for the Odessa and Dnepropetrovsk regions 400 thousand poods (6600 tonnes, 200 thousand poods or 3300 tonnes for each) appeared as early as February 7, 1933. Measures were introduced to localize these cases using locally available resources. While the numbers of such reports increased, the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine issued a decree on February 8, 1933, that urged every “hunger case” to be treated without delay and with a maximum mobilization of resources by "kolkhozes", "raions", towns, and oblasts. The decree set a seven-day term for food aid which was to be provided from “central sources”. On February 20, 1933, the Dnipropetrovsk oblast received 1.2 million poods of food aid, Odessa received 800 thousand, and Kharkiv received 300 thousand. The Kiev oblast was allocated 6 million poods by March 18. The Ukrainian authorities also provided aid, but it was limited by available resources. In order to assist orphaned children, the Ukrainian GPU and People's Commissariat for Health created a special commission, which established a network of kindergartens where children could get food. Urban areas affected by food shortage adhered to a rationing system. On March 20, 1933, Stalin signed a decree which lowered the monthly milling levy in Ukraine by 14 thousand tons, which was to be redistributed as an additional bread supply “for students, small towns and small enterprises in large cities and specially in Kiev”. However, food aid distribution was not managed effectively and was poorly redistributed by regional and local authorities.
After the first wave of hunger in February and March, Ukrainian authorities met with a second wave of hunger and starvation in April and May, specifically in the Kiev and Kharkiv oblasts. The situation was aggravated by the extended winter.
Between February and June 1933, thirty-five Politburo decisions and Sovnarkom decrees authorized the issue of a total of 35.19 million poods (576,400 tonnes), or more than half of total aid to Soviet agriculture as a whole. 1.1 million tonnes were provided by Central Soviet authorities in winter and spring 1933 — grain and seeds for Ukrainian SSR peasants, kolhozes and "sovhozes". Such figures did not include grain and flour aid provided for the urban population and children, or aid from local sources. In Russia, Stalin personally authorized distribution of aid in answer to a request by Sholokhov, whose own district was stricken. However, Stalin also later reprimanded Sholokhov for failing to recognize "sabotage" within his district. This was the only instance that a specific amount of aid was given to a specific district. Other appeals were not successful, and many desperate pleas were cut back or rejected.
Documents from Soviet archives indicate that the aid distribution was made selectively to the most affected areas, and during the spring months, such assistance was the goal of the relief effort. A special resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine for the Kiev Oblast, from March 31, 1933, ordered peasants to be hospitalized with either ailing or recovering patients. The resolution ordered improved nutrition within the limits of available resources so that they could be sent out into the fields to sow the new crop as soon as possible. The food was dispensed according to special resolutions from government bodies, and additional food was given in the field where the laborers worked.
The last CPSU Politburo decision about food aid to the whole of the Ukrainian SSR was issued on June 13, 1933. Separate orders about food aid for regions of Ukraine appeared by the end of June through early July 1933 for the Dnipropetrovsk, Vinnytsia and Kiev regions. For the kolkhozes of the Kharkiv region, assistance was provided by end of July 1933 (Politburo decision dated July 20, 1933).
Extensive export of grain and other food.
Some publications claim that after recognition of the famine situation in Ukraine during the drought and poor harvests, the Soviet government in Moscow continued to export grain rather than retain its crop to feed the people, though at a significantly lower rate than in previous years. In 1930–31, there had been 5,832,000 metric tons of grains exported. In 1931–32, grain exports declined to 4,786,000 metric tons. In 1932–33, grain exports were just 1,607,000 metric tons, and in 1933–34, this further declined to 1,441,000 metric tons. Officially published data differed slightly:
Cereals (in tonnes):
Only wheat (in tonnes):
In 1932, via Ukrainian commercial ports the following amounts were exported: 988,300 tons of grains and 16,500 tons of other types of cereals. In 1933, the totals were: 809,600 tons of grains, 2,600 tons of other cereals, 3,500 tons of meat, 400 tons of butter, and 2,500 tons of fish. Those same ports imported the following amounts: less than 67,200 tons of grains and cereals in 1932, and 8,600 tons of grains in 1933.
The following amounts were received from other Soviet ports: in 1932, 164,000 tons of grains, 7,300 tons of other cereals, 31,500 tons of, and no more than 177,000 tons of meat and butter; in 1933, 230,000 tons of grains, 15,300 tons if other cereals, 100 tons of meat, 900 tons of butter, and 34,300 tons of fish.
Michael Ellman states that the 1932–33 grain exports amounted to 1.8 million tonnes, which would have been enough to feed 5 million people for one year.
Elimination of Ukrainian cultural elite.
Some researches found that the famine of 1932–1933 followed the assault on Ukrainian national culture that started in 1928. The events of 1932–1933 in Ukraine were seen by the Soviet Communist leaders as an instrument against Ukrainian self-determination. At the 12th Congress of the Communist Party of Ukraine (CP(b)U), Moscow-appointed leader Pavel Postyshev declared that "1933 was the year of the defeat of Ukrainian nationalist counter-revolution." This "defeat" encompassed not just the physical extermination of a significant portion of the Ukrainian peasantry, but also the mass imprisonment or execution of Ukrainian intellectuals, writers, and artists.
By the end of the 1930s, approximately four-fifths of the Ukrainian cultural elite had been eliminated. Some, like Ukrainian writer Mykola Khvylovy, committed suicide. One of the leading Ukrainian Bolsheviks, Mykola Skrypnyk, who was in charge of the decade-long Ukrainization program that had been decisively brought to an end, shot himself in the summer of 1933 at the height of the purge of the CP(b)U. Whole academic organizations, such as the Bahaliy Institute of History and Culture, were shut down following the arrests.
Repression of the intelligentsia occurred in virtually all parts of the Soviet Union. 
Despite the assault, education and publishing in the republic remained Ukrainianized for years afterward. In 1935–36, 83% of all school children in the Ukrainian SSR were taught in Ukrainian, with Ukrainians making up about 80% of the population. In 1936, of 1830 newspapers, 1402 were in Ukrainian, as were 177 magazines, and in 1936, 69 thousand Ukrainian books were printed.
Deliberate targeting of Ukrainians.
Although famine, caused by collectivization, raged in many parts of the Soviet Union in 1932, special and particularly lethal policies, described by Yale historian Timothy Snyder in his book "Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin" (2010), were adopted in and largely limited to Ukraine at the end of 1932 and 1933. Snyder lists seven crucial policies that applied only, or mainly, to Soviet Ukraine. He states: "Each of them may seem like an anodyne administrative measure, and each of them was certainly presented as such at the time, and yet each had to kill":
The recent award-winning documentary "Genocide Revealed" (2011), by Canadian-Ukrainian director Yurij Luhovy, presents evidence for the view that Stalin and his cohorts in the Communist regime (not necessarily the Russian people as a whole) deliberately targeted Ukrainians in the mass starvation of 1932–1933. Stalin's regime proceeded to eliminate the intelligentsia of Ukraine, to forcibly deport Ukrainian Kulaks who opposed its collectivization policies, and to orchestrate a deliberate mass starvation by hunger of Ukrainians, wherever they were found throughout the Soviet Empire. This documentary reinforces the view that the Holodomor was indeed an act of genocide.
Consequence of collectivization.
While a complex task, it is possible to group some of the causes that contributed to the Holodomor. They have to be understood in the larger context of the social revolution from above that took place in the Soviet Union at the time.
Collectivization.
Approaches to changing from individual farming to a collective type of agricultural production had existed since 1917, but for various reasons (lack of agricultural equipment, agronomy resources, etc.) were not implemented widely until 1925, when there was a more intensive effort by the agricultural sector to increase the number of agricultural cooperatives and bolster the effectiveness of already existing sovkhozes. In late 1927, after the XV Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, then known as the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks), a significant impetus was given to the collectivization effort.
In 1927, a drought shortened the harvest in southern areas of the Ukrainian SSR and North Caucasus. In 1927–28, the winter tillage area was badly affected due to low snow levels. Despite seed aid from the State, many affected areas were not re-sown. The 1928 harvest was affected by drought in most of the grain producing areas of the Ukrainian SSR. Shortages in the harvest and difficulties with the supply system created difficulties with the food supply in urban areas and destabilized the food supply situation in the USSR in general. In order to alleviate the situation, a system of food rationing was initially implemented in Odessa in the second quarter of 1928, and later spread to Mariupol, Kherson, Kiev, Dniprelstan (Dnipropetrovsk), and Kharkiv. At the beginning of 1929, a similar system was implemented throughout the USSR. Despite the aid from the Soviet Ukrainian and the Central governments, many southern rural areas registered occurrences of malnutrition and in some cases hunger and starvation (the affected areas and thus the amount of required food aid was under-counted by authorities). There was also a shortage of forage livestock. Most of Kolkhozes and recently refurnished sovkhozes went through these years with few losses, and some were even able to provide assistance to peasants in the more affected areas (seed and grain for food).
Despite the intense state campaign, the collectivization, which was initially voluntary, was not popular amongst peasants: as of early 1929, only 5.6% of Ukrainian peasant households and 3.8% of arable land were "collectivized". In early 1929, the methods employed by the specially empowered authority "UkrKolhozcenter" changed from a voluntary enrollment to an administrative one. By October 1, 1929, a plan for the creation of kolkhozes was “outperformed” by 239%. As a result, 8.8% of arable land was collectivized.
The next major step toward "all-over collectivization" took place after an article was published by Stalin in "Pravda", in early November 1929.
While initiated by a November 10–17 meeting of Communist Party Central Committee "Twenty-Five Thousanders" only trained at special short courses, the main driving force of collectivization and "dekulakization" in Ukraine became a "poor peasants committee" (“komnezamy”) and local village councils ("silrady") where komnezams members had a voting majority.
The USSR Kolhozcenter issued the December 10, 1929, decree on collectivization of livestock within a three-month period (draft animals 100%, cattle 100%, pigs 80%, sheep and goats 60%). This drove many peasants to slaughter their livestock. By January 1, 1930, the percentage of collectivized households almost doubled to 16.4%.
Despite the infamous January 5, 1930 decree, in which the deadline for the complete collectivization of the Ukrainian SSR was set for the period from the end of 1931 to spring 1932, the authorities decided to accelerate the completion of the campaign in autumn 1930. The high expectations of the plan were outperformed by local authorities even without the assistance of the 7,500 Twenty-Five Thousanders, Some of the peasants and "weak elements" were arrested and deported "to the north”. Many arrested "kulaks" and "well-to-do" farmers resettled their families to the Urals and Central Asia. The term "kulak" was ultimately applied to anybody resisting collectivization as many of the so-called kulaks were no more well-off than other peasants.
The fast-track to collectivization incited numerous peasant revolts in Ukraine and in other parts of the USSR. In response to the situation "Pravda" published Stalin's article "Dizzy with successes". Soon, numerous orders and decrees were issued banning the use of force and administrative methods. Some of those “mistakenly” dekulakized received their property back, and some returned home. As a result, the collectivization process was rolled back, and by May 1, 1933, 38.2% of Ukrainian SSR peasant households and 41.1% of arable land had been collectivized. By the end of August these numbers declined to 29.2% and 35.6% respectively.
A second forced-voluntary collectivization campaign was initiated in the winter of 1931, with significant assistance of the so-called tug-brigades composed of kolkhoz "udarniks". Many kulaks, along with their families, were deported from the Ukrainian SSR.
According to declassified data, around 300,000 peasants in Ukraine were affected by these policies in 1930–31. Ukrainians composed 15% of the total 1.8 million kulaks relocated Soviet-wide. Beginning in summer 1931, all further deportations were recommended to be administered only to individuals.
This second forced-voluntary collectivization campaign also caused a delay in sowing. During winter and spring 1930–31, the Ukrainian agricultural authority "Narkomzem" issued several reports about the significant decline of livestock caused by poor treatment, the absence of forage, stables, and farms, and "kulak sabotage".
According to the First Five-Year Plan, Ukrainian agriculture was to switch from an exclusive orientation of grain to a more diverse output. This included not only an increase in sugar beet crops; other types of agricultural production were expected to be utilized by industry, including cotton, which was established in 1931. This plan anticipated a decrease in grain area and an increase of yield and area for other crops.
By July 1, 1931, 65.7% of Ukrainian SSR peasant households and 67.2% of arable land were reported as collectivized, while the main grain and sugar beet production areas were collectivized at levels of 80–90%.
The decree of Central Committee of the Communist Party on August 2, 1931 clarified the "all-over collectivization" term — in order to be considered complete, the all-over collectivization did not have to reach 100%, but could not be less than 68-70% of peasants households and 75-80% of arable lands. According to the same decree, all-over collectivization was accomplished in the following areas: Northern Caucasus (Kuban), with 88% of households and 92% of arable lands collectivized; Ukraine (South), with 85% and 94% respectively; Ukraine (Right Bank), with 69% and 80%; and Moldavian ASRR (part of Ukrainian SRR), with 68% and 75%.
As of the beginning of October 1931, the collectivization of 68% of peasant households, and 72% of arable land was complete.
The plan for the state grain collection in the Ukrainian SSR adopted for 1931 was over-optimistic — 510 million poods (8.4 Tg). Drought, administrative distribution of the plan for kolkhozes, and the lack of relevant general management destabilized the situation. Significant amounts of grain remained unharvested. A significant percentage was lost during processing and transportation, or spoiled at elevators (wet grain). The total winter sowing area shrunk by ~2 million hectares. Livestock in kolkhozes remained without forage, which was collected under grain procurement. A similar occurrence happened with respect to seeds and wages awarded to kolhoz members. Grain collection continued until May 1932, but reached only 90% of the planned amounts. By the end of December 1931, the collection plan was 79% accomplished. Many kolkhozes from December 1931 onwards suffered from lack of food, resulting in an increased number of deaths caused by malnutrition, which were registered by OGPU in some areas (Moldavian SSR as a whole and several central rayons of Vinnytsya, Kiev, and North-East rayons of Odessa oblasts) in winter, spring and early summer 1932. By 1932, the sowing campaign of the Ukrainian SSR was implemented with minimal drafht power, as most of the remaining horses were incapable of working, while the number of available agricultural tractors was too small to fill the gap.
The Government of the Ukrainian SSR tried to remedy the situation, but it had little success. Administrative and territorial reform (oblast creation) in February 1932 also added to the mismanagement. As a result, Moscow had more details about the seed situation than the Ukrainian authorities. In May 1932, in an effort to change the situation, the central Soviet Government provided 7.1 million poods of grain for food for Ukraine and dispatched an additional 700 agricultural tractors originally intended for other regions of USSR.
By July, the total amount of aid provided from Central Soviet Authorities for food, sowing and forage for the agricultural sector totaled more than 17 million poods.
Speculative prices of food in the cooperative network (5–10 times more compared to neighboring Soviet republics) brought significant peasant “travel for bread”, while attempts to handle the situation had very limited success. The quota on carried-on foods provision was lifted by Stalin (at Kosior's request) at the end of May 1932. The July GPU reports for the first half of 1932 mentioned the “difficulties with food” in 127 out of 484 rayons and acknowledged the incompleteness of the information for the regions. The decree of Sovnarkom on “Kolkhoz Trade” issued in May fostered rumors amongst peasants that collectivization was rolled back again, as it had been in spring 1930. The number of peasants who abandoned kolkhozes significantly increased.
As a result, the government plans for the central grain collection in Ukraine was lowered by 18.1% compared to the 1931 plan. Collective farms were still expected to return 132,750 tons of grain, which had been provided in spring 1932 as aid. The grain collection plan for July 1932 was adopted to collect 19.5 million poods. The actual state of collection was disastrous, and by July 31, only 3 million poods (compared to 21 million in 1931) were collected. As of July 20, the harvested area was half the 1931 amount. The sovhozes had only sowed 16% of the defined area.
Beginning in July 1932, the Ukrainian SSR met with difficulty in supplying the planned amount of food to the rationing system (implemented in early 1928) to supply extensively growing urban areas with food. This system almost became the sole source of food delivery to cities, while the alternatives, cooperative trade and black market trading, became too expensive and undersupplied to provide long-range assistance. By December 1932, due to faulty grain procurement, daily rationing for the rural population was limited to 100–600 grams of bread, with some group of rural citizens completely withdrawn from the rationing supply.
This disparity between agricultural goals and actual production grew later in the year. An expected 190 thousand tons of grain were to be exported, but by August 27, 1932, only 20 thousand tons were ready. Taking into account the situation with the harvest at right bank Ukraine, Stalin lowered procurement plan for the Ukrainian SSR by 40 million poods at the end of August 1932. By October 25, the plan for grain collection was lowered once again. Nevertheless, collection reached only 39% of the annually planned total. A second lowering of goals subtracted 70 million poods but still demanded plan completion and 100% efficiency. Attempts to reach the new goals of production proved futile in late 1932. On November 29, in order to complete the plan, Ukraine was to collect 94 million poods, 4.8 million of them from sovkhozes. On January 2, targets were again lowered to 62.5 million poods. On January 14, the targets were lowered even further to 33.1 million. At the same time, GPU of Ukraine reported hunger and starvation in the Kiev and Vinnytsia oblasts, and began implementing measures to remedy the situation. The total amount of grain collected by February 5 was only 255 million poods (compared to 440 million poods in 1931), while the numbers of “hunger and malnutrition cases” as registered by the GPU of Ukrainian SSR increased every day.
Whilst the long-lasting effect of overall collectivization had an adverse effect on agricultural output everywhere, Ukraine had long been the most agriculturally productive area, providing over 50% of exported grain and 25% of total production of grain in the Russian Empire in 1913. Over , were used for grain production, or 90.5% of total arable land. This degree of dependency on agriculture meant that the effects of a bad harvest could be almost unlimited. This had been long recognized, and while projections for agricultural production were adjusted, the shock of limited production could not be easily managed. While collections by the state were in turn limited, there were already clear stresses. The 1932 total Soviet harvest was to be 29.5 million tons in state collections of grain out of 90.7 million tons in production. But the actual result was a disastrous 55–60 million tons in production. The state ended up collecting only 18.5 million tons in grain. The total Soviet collections by the state were virtually the same in 1930 and 1931 at about 22.8 million tons. For 1932, they had been reduced significantly to 18.5 million tons, with even lower figure in Ukraine. These were the total estimated outcomes of the grain harvests:
Peasants’ reaction.
Another potential factor contributing to the situation in spring 1933 was that the peasants’ “incentive to work disappeared” when they worked at “large collective farms.” Soviet archival data for 1930–32 also support that conclusion. This is one of the factors for reducing the sowing area in 1932 and for significant losses during harvesting. By December 1932, 725,000 hectares of grain in areas of Ukrainian SRR affected by famine remained uncollected in spring 1933.
A second significant factor was "the massacre of cattle by peasants not wishing to sacrifice their property for nothing to the collective farm." During winter and spring 1930–31, the Ukrainian agricultural authority "Narkomzem" issued several reports about the significant decline of livestock and especially draft power caused by poor treatment, absence of forage, stables, and farms, and "kulak sabotage". 
Legislation provisions.
On August 7, 1932, the Soviet government passed a law, "On the Safekeeping of Socialist Property", that imposed penalties from a ten-year prison sentence up to the death penalty for any theft of socialist property. Stalin personally appended the stipulation: "People who encroach on socialist property should be considered enemies of the people." Within the first five months of passage of the law, 54,645 individuals had been imprisoned under it, and 2,110 sentenced to death. The initial wording of the decree, "On fought with speculation”, adopted August 22, 1932 led to common situations where minor acts such as bartering tobacco for bread were documented as punished by 5 years imprisonment. After 1934, by NKVD demand, the penalty for minor offenses was limited to a fine of 500 rubles or three months of correctional labor.
The scope of this law, colloquially dubbed the "law of the wheat ears", included even the smallest appropriation of grain by peasants for personal use. In little over a month, the law was revised, as Politburo protocols revealed that secret decisions had later modified the original decree of September 16, 1932. The Politburo approved a measure that specifically exempted small-scale theft of socialist property from the death penalty, declaring that "organizations and groupings destroying state, social, and co-operate property in an organized manner by fires, explosions and mass destruction of property shall be sentenced to execution without trial", and listed a number of cases in which "kulaks, former traders and other socially-alien persons" would be subject to the death penalty. "Working individual peasants and collective farmers" who stole kolkhoz property and grain should be sentenced to ten years; the death penalty should be imposed only for "systematic theft of grain, sugar beets, animals, etc."
Soviet expectations for the 1932 grain crop were high because of Ukraine's bumper crop the previous year, which Soviet authorities believed were sustainable. When it became clear that the 1932 grain deliveries were not going to meet the expectations of the government, the decreased agricultural output was blamed on the kulaks, and later to agents and spies of foreign Intelligence Services — "nationalists", "Petlurovites", and from 1937 on, trotskyists. According to a report by the head of the Supreme Court, by January 15, 1933, as many as 103,000 people (more than 14,000 in the Ukrainian SSR) had been sentenced under the provisions of the August 7 decree. Of the 79,000 whose sentences were known to the Supreme Court, 4,880 had been sentenced to death, 26,086 to ten years' imprisonment, and 48,094 to other sentences.
On November 8, Molotov and Stalin issued an order stating "from today the dispatch of goods for the villages "of all regions of Ukraine" shall cease until kolkhozy and individual peasants begin to honestly and conscientiously fulfill their duty to the working class and the Red Army by delivering grain."
On November 24, the Politburo instructed that all those sentenced to confinement of three years or more in Ukraine be deported to labor camps. It also simplified procedures for confirming death sentences in Ukraine. The Politburo also dispatched Balytsky to Ukraine for six months with the full powers of the OGPU.
The existing practice of administrative punishment known as "black board" (blacklist) by the November, 18 Decree of Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine was applied to a greater extent and with more harsh methods to selected villages and kolkhozes that were considered to be underperforming in the grain collection procurement: “Immediate cessation of delivery of goods, complete suspension of cooperative and state trade in the villages, and removal of all available goods from cooperative and state stores. Full prohibition of collective farm trade for both collective farms and collective farmers, and for private farmers. Cessation of any sort of credit and demand for early repayment of credit and other financial obligations.” Initially, such sanctions were applied to only six villages, but later they were applied to numerous rural settlements and districts. For peasants who were not kolkhoz members and who were underperforming in the grain collection procurement, special measures were adopted. To “reach the grain procurement quota” amongst peasants, 1100 brigades, consisting of activists (often from neighboring villages) which had accomplished their grain procurement quota or were close to accomplishing it, were organized.
Since most of goods supplied to the rural areas were commercial (fabrics, matches, fuels) and sometimes obtained by villagers from neighbored cities or railway stations, sanctioned villages remained so for a long period. As an example mentioned in the December 6 "Decree", the village of Kamyani Potoky was removed from blacklist only on October 17, 1933 when they completed their plan for grain collection early. Beginning in January 1933, the black list regime was softened when 100% of plan execution was no longer demanded. The December 6 "Decree" stated that the villages Liutenky and Havrylivka were removed from the black list after reaching 88% and 70% plan completion respectively.
Measures were undertaken to persecute those withholding or bargaining grain. This was frequently done by requisition detachments, which raided farms to collect grain, and was done regardless of whether the peasants retained enough grain to feed themselves, or whether they had enough seed left to plant the next harvest.
Procurement practice.
In 1928, a "by contract" policy of procurement (contracts for the delivery of agricultural products) was implemented for kolkhozes and ordinary peasants alike (kulaks had a "firm" plan for procurement). Accordingly, from 1928 through January 1933, "grain production areas" were required to submit 1/3 to 1/4 of their estimated yield, while areas designated as grain were required to submit no more than 1/8 of their estimated yield. However, between autumn 1930 and spring 1932, local authorities tended to collect products from kolkhozes in amounts greater than the minimum required, in order to exceed the contracted target, in some cases by more than 200%. Especially harmful methods utilized in the by contract policy were "counter-plan" actions, which were additional collection plans implemented in already fulfilled contracts. Such counter-plan measures were strictly forbidden after the Spring of 1933 as "extremely harmful for kolkhoz development."
In 1932 a "1/4 of yield" procurement quota for "grain production areas" of the Ukrainian SSR was planned for implementation. On September 23, 1932, a telegram signed by Molotov and Stalin noted that the harvest of 1932 was "satisfactory", according to estimates provided by the agricultural planning authorities, and therefore requests for seed for winter crops were refused, while total winter tillage acreage demands were increased. Later, Stalin blamed the statistical and planning authorities for inaccurately estimating potential yields and thus a "Commissions for yield estimation" was created on December 17, 1932, by his order. The 1932 harvest figures provided at the time were largely overestimated, and the actual difference between estimated and actual harvest was significant. Such unrealistic figures resulted in demand that was impossible to fulfill and greater grain procurement than was possible from late 1932 through February 5, 1933
The 1932 grain procurement quota and the amount of grain actually collected were much smaller than those of any other year in the 1930s. In 1932, some 5.8 million tons of procured grain were returned to the rural sector, more than had been in 1930 or 1931.
Natural reasons.
Drought has been mentioned as the major reason for the Holodomor by Soviet sources since 1983. This explanation has been modified by the Western historian Dr. Mark Tauger, who concluded that the famine was not fundamentally "man-made". He says that rustic plant disease, rather than drought, was the cause of the famine. The most that can be said of the contribution of human actions is that draft shortages, lack of labor, systemic economic problems, mismanagement, and peasant resistance exacerbated the crop failures already created by natural disasters.
In 1932, extremely dry weather reduced crops in some regions, and unusually wet and humid weather in most others fostered unprecedented infestations. These conditions reduced the potential yield, as drought had in 1931. Drought, rain, and infestations destroyed at least 20% of the harvest, and this would have been sufficient on its own to cause serious food shortages or even famine. The historian Mark Tauger believes that if these factors had not developed in 1931 and 1932, agricultural production would have been considerably larger.
The drought was not as bad as that of the non-famine year of 1936, and the earlier drought was centered outside Ukraine, according to the leading Soviet authority on drought. The prime cause of the major crop failure of 1932–33 was plant rust rather than drought. Nevertheless, there was a significant drought in 1931, which caused a considerable decrease in the harvest, while in 1936 the decrease in the harvest was not as catastrophic. Historian James Mace wrote that Mark Tauger's argument "is not taken seriously by either Russians or Ukrainians who have studied the topic." In addition, Stephen Wheatcroft, author of "The Years of Hunger", claims Tauger's view represents the opposite extreme in arguing the famine was totally accidental.
Sovkhozes general fault of 1932.
After grain collection difficulties in 1927 and 1928, Stalin ordered the creation of state grain and meat enterprises — sovkhozes — which, according to his initial vision, should deliver more than 100 million poods of grain in 1932. However, in 1932 their production results were disastrous due to poor general and agricultural management and planning, despite the significant (as compared to kolkhozes) amount of modern agricultural mechanisms (agricultural tractors, harvesters, etc.) employed. The main reason for low output was that wheat was continually sown, beginning in 1929, on the same areas without fertilizers. Sovkhozes also suffered from a lack of manpower and infrastructure (roads, elevators etc.). Losses during harvesting were extremely high.
Thus instead of the expected 290 millions of poods (more than 5 million tons) in 1932, sovkhozes produced 5 time less, while the situation with livestock was even worse. As of July 20, 1932 sovhozes of the Ukrainian SRR had logged 16% of the defined sowing area.
Primitive agriculture.
Another factor in the decline of the harvests was that the shortage of draft power for plowing and reaping was even more acute in 1932 than in the previous year. The number of working horses declined from 19.5 million on July 1, 1931 to 16.2 million on July 1, 1932. The efforts to replace horses by tractors failed to compensate for this loss. In 1931, the total supply of tractors for agriculture amounted to , with produced at home and imported. But in 1932, because of the foreign trade crisis and home producing establishing, no tractors were imported.
In the whole of 1932, tractors supplied to agriculture, considerably less than in 1931. Only about half became available in time for the harvest, and even less in time for the spring sowing. Animal draft power deteriorated in quality. Horses were fed and maintained even more inadequately than in the previous year. The acute shortage of horses led to the decision to employ cows as working animals. According to the speech of one Soviet official at one of the most affected by famine region, the Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, "in 1932 we employ only 9000 cows, but in 1933 we involve at least 3/4 of their total number; 57000 employed at sowing." On February 23, the Lower Volga party bureau decided to use 200,000 cows for special field work.

Barclay, Pennsylvania

The ghost town of Barclay, in Franklin Township, Bradford County, Pennsylvania, was a coal mining town. Coal was transported down the mountain by an incline plane rail system. The original location of the town was later obliterated by strip mining operations. The cemetery still exists and provides an interesting place to visit.
The towns of Barclay and Laquin are in close proximity of each other. Barclay came into existence before Laquin, Pennsylvania, and both were served by the long defunct Susquehanna and New York Railroad. This operated between Monroe, Pennsylvania (Monroeton) and Williamsport, Pennsylvania. The railroad is quite an interesting story and most of the trackbed, and bridges are still very much in evidence throughout the valley of Schrader Creek.

Wesley Matthews

Wesley Matthews, Jr. (born October 14, 1986) is an American professional basketball player who currently plays for the Portland Trail Blazers in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Marquette Golden Eagles. He is the son of former NBA player Wes Matthews.
Early life.
Born in San Antonio, Texas, to Pam Moore (an All-American runner and basketball player) and Wesley "Wes" Matthews, Sr., who met when both attended University of Wisconsin, Wesley Jr. starred on the James Madison Memorial High School basketball and soccer teams.
College career.
Matthews chose to attend Marquette University despite being pressured to play for the University of Wisconsin–Madison like his father did. He chose this after being selected Mr. Basketball in 2005 for the state of Wisconsin while attending James Madison Memorial High School.
Wesley was the biggest of the "three amigos", the three guards in the starting lineup for Marquette. This trio, Dominic James, Jerel McNeal, and Matthews, started nearly every game together from their freshman year onwards. With the lack of height in the 2008–2009 season at Marquette, Matthews learned to play bigger and became one of the most dominant players in the nation while driving to the basket. He grabbed 13 rebounds in a Marquette 48-point win over Division II opponent Lewis Flyers on December 28, 2005.
Matthews missed a shot with 0.4 seconds left in the first half of a game against the Tennessee Volunteers on December 16, 2008. The shot would have given Marquette the lead; instead the teams went into the locker room with the scored tied at 32–32. He avenged this miss with a three-point play to open the second half, and another basket on the following possession. Matthews scored a career-high 30 points, making 15 of 18 free throws. On January 7, 2009, he set a school record for field goal accuracy (minimum 10 attempts) when he went 10-for-10 en route to 23 points in an 81–76 win over Rutgers.
Professional career.
Matthews went undrafted in the 2009 NBA Draft, but was invited to play for the Utah Jazz and the Sacramento Kings in the NBA Summer Leagues.
On September 25, 2009, he was signed to the Utah Jazz to a one year deal as a rookie free agent. On October 22, 2009, Matthews made the official Utah Jazz roster, wearing the number 23. In February 2010, after the team's trade of Ronnie Brewer, Head Coach Jerry Sloan made Matthews the team's starting shooting guard.
On June 28, 2010, the Jazz extended Matthews the league-specified qualifying offer, thereby making him a restricted free agent and giving the Jazz the opportunity to match any other free agent offer. Matthews was actively pursued by the Portland Trail Blazers, who on July 10 signed him to an offer sheet providing for a front-loaded 5 year, $34 million contract. Although allowed seven days to match the Portland offer sheet under league rules, on July 14 the Jazz announced their decision not to offer Matthews a matching contract, making Matthews a Portland Trail Blazer.
In his first season with Portland he averaged 15.9 points a game. His three point shot improved from 38 percent to 41 percent. After Brandon Roy began missing time due to knee problems, Matthews gained a spot in the Blazers' starting lineup. On November 23, 2013, in a game against the Golden State Warriors, Matthews was involved in an altercation and was ejected along with teammate Mo Williams. He scored 23 points in 25 minutes of action before leaving the game. On November 25, it was announced that he was fined $20,000.
Matthews is renowned for is energetic demeanor on and off the court. On the court, he is all smiles and plays his heart out.

<doc id="20222517" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20222517" title="Leg raise">
Leg raise

The leg raise is a strength training exercise used for strengthening the rectus abdominis and hip flexors.
Angles.
Lying.
The lying leg raise is done by lying on the floor on the back. It is done without apparatus except possibly cushions or weights for added resistance.
Practitioners generally caution to keep the lower back in contact with the floor and place hands to sides or under lower back for support.
If the back stays flat on floor and abdominals are tight, this keeps the abs engaged. Otherwise it would just be a hip flexor movement.
Due to leverage, the hardest portion of a supine (laying) leg raise is generally the first part when the legs are on the floor, as this is when the femur is parallel with the earth and perpendicular to the pull of gravity.
Seated.
A seated leg raise is halfway between a laying raise and a hanging/suspended/tractioned one. They are done seated on an elevated surface. Usually the hands are placed on the surface (or arm rests) and bear some of the body's weight to lessen the weight borne on the buttocks and increase abdominal recruitment.
Tractioned.
Leg raises can also be performed hanging onto an overhead bar. These are known as hanging leg raises and are more challenging than lying leg raises.
They can also be performed on other apparati such as dip bars and captain's chairs, which also involve the torso being suspended in the air, except that the stress through the arms is different.
This variation of leg raise allows the pelvis to freely rotate. It is generally the more difficult variation for the abdominal muscles due to having to support the pelvic weight as opposed to simply stabilizing its alignment.
Alongside this however, it is also potentially the easiest to use bad form on, because users may use a swinging motion to 'cheat' by building up momentum. If the abs are not properly engaged, the spine can easily hyperextend and go into anterior pelvic tilt. It should be going into posterior pelvic tilt if the movement is being done to target the rectus abdominis.
This movement can also be done with "ab slings" which hold the humeri in ~90 degrees of shoulder flexion. This allows to do a more traditional crunch (exercise) by bringing the knees up to touch the elbows. It is however possible to assist in this movement by using the lats and other muscles to perform shoulder extension.
Force.
The demands of force on the muscles can be increased through altered posture or apparatus.
Joints.
Extending the knee joint (often called a straight leg raise]) increases the demands of leverage on both hip and spine flexors. It also reduces the contribution of the rectus femoris muscle via over-active insufficiency, creating more work for the non-quadriceps hip flexors.
The generic term "leg raise" usually indicates a bended knee, though the term "knee raise" is used to distinguish it from the category which includes both variations.
Weights.
The exercise can also be done weighted, such as wearing ankle weights or weighted boots, holding a dumbbell between the feet, or slipping one's feet through kettlebells. These weights are also affected by the increased leverage of a straightened knee.
Form.
Range.
Some prefer to lift as high as possibly through a full range of motion for each repetition. Others do partial range repetitions to focus on more difficult portions of the exercise (generally when the leg is parallel with the ground).
"Leg raise" usually indicates that the mobilization only occurs in the joints of the leg. Both ab muscles (rectus and transversus abdominis) are used to isometrically stabilize the spine to resist extension and posterior pelvic tilt that would otherwise occur with the legs lifted in front.
When the lumbar spine flexes, the rectus abdominis is worked dynamically instead of isometrically, increasing its activity, but lessening the stabilizing effect of the TA. This variation is called a leg-hip raise.
Leg-hip raises are usually done suspended as the pelvis is more free to rotate. With laying/seated leg raises, the friction between the posterior of the pelvis with the surface it is in contact with impedes rotation.
Tempo.
Some advise to lower down to starting position slowly and with control. Others do the exercise more dynamically and with speed.

Proprietary protocol

In telecommunications, a proprietary protocol is a communications protocol owned by a single organization or individual.
Enforcement.
Proprietors may enforce restrictions through patents and by keeping the protocol specification a trade secret. These restrictions are intended to give the owner control of the protocol.
Examples.
The Skype protocol is a proprietary protocol.
The Venturi Transport Protocol (VTP) is a patented proprietary protocol () that is designed to replace TCP transparently in order to overcome perceived inefficiencies related to wireless data transport.
Microsoft Exchange Server protocols are proprietary open access protocols. The rights to develop and release protocols are held by Microsoft, but all technical details are free for access and implementation.
Effects of incompatibility.
The use of proprietary instant messaging protocols meant that instant messaging networks were incompatible and people were unable to reach friends on other networks.
Proprietary extensions to open protocols.
Microsoft developed a proprietary extension to the Kerberos network authentication protocol for the Windows 2000 operating system. The extensions made the protocol incompatible with implementations supporting the original standards, and this has raised concerns that this, along with the licensing restrictions, effectively denies products unable to conform to the standard access to a Windows 2000 Server using Kerberos.
Reverse engineering.
Reverse engineering is the process of retrieving a protocol’s details from a software implementation of the specification. Methods of reverse-engineering a protocol include packet sniffing and binary decompilation and disassembly. 
There are legal precedents when the reverse-engineering is aimed at interoperability of protocols. In the United States, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act grants a safe harbor to reverse engineer software for the purposes of interoperability with other software.

Laquin, Pennsylvania

Laquin, in Franklin Township, Bradford County, Pennsylvania, was founded about 1902 as a lumber town, (although the ghost town of Barclay is nearby and it is an old coal mining town). The death of the town was from economics. When the forests played out and the mills could no longer be fed, the industry left and the people soon followed. A CCC camp was established here in the 1930s but this would be abandoned and by 1941 Laquin was a ghost town. Population at one time probably approached 2000, maybe more. There are abundant traces of the town today, though the last building disappeared sometime in the 1960s. The main street still exists as the major access road, and once sported a hotel, two churches, a school, a boarding house, store, depot, town building and several homes.
Laquin, and Barclay are in close proximity of each other, but Laquin came into existence after Barclay, Pennsylvania, and was served by the long defunct Susquehanna and New York Railroad. This operated between Towanda, Pennsylvania and Williamsport, Pennsylvania. The railroad is quite an interesting story in itself, and most of the trackbed, and bridges are still very much in evidence throughout the valley of Schrader Creek.

Death of Baby P

Peter Connelly (also known as "Baby P", "Child A" and "Baby Peter") was a 17-month-old British boy who died in London after suffering more than fifty injuries over an eight-month period, during which he was repeatedly seen by Haringey Children's services and NHS health professionals. Baby P's real first name was revealed as "Peter" on the conclusion of a subsequent trial of Peter's mother's boyfriend on a charge of raping a two-year-old. His full identity was revealed when his killers were named after the expiry of a court anonymity order on 10 August 2009.
The case caused shock and concern among the public and in Parliament, partly because of the magnitude of Peter's injuries, and partly because Peter had lived in the London Borough of Haringey, North London, under the same child care authorities that had already failed ten years earlier in the case of Victoria Climbié. That had led to a public enquiry which resulted in measures being put in place in an effort to prevent similar cases happening.
Peter's mother Tracey Connelly, her boyfriend Steven Barker, and Jason Owen (later revealed to be the brother of Barker) were all convicted of causing or allowing the death of a child, the mother having pleaded guilty to the charge. A court order issued by the High Court in England had prevented the publication of the identity of Baby P; this was lifted on 1 May 2009 by Mr Justice Coleridge. An order sought by Haringey Council to stop publication of the identities of his mother and her boyfriend was granted, but expired on 10 August 2009.
The child protection services of Haringey and other agencies were widely criticised. Following the conviction, three inquiries and a nationwide review of social service care were launched, and the Head of Children's Services at Haringey was removed by direction of the government minister. Another nationwide review was conducted by Lord Laming into his own recommendations concerning Victoria Climbié's killing in 2000. The death was also the subject of debate in the House of Commons.
Biography.
Peter Connelly was born to Tracey Connelly on 1 March 2006. In November, Connelly's new boyfriend, Steven Barker, moved in with her. In December, a GP noticed bruises on Peter's face and chest. His mother was arrested and Peter was put into the care of a family friend, but returned home to his mother's care in January 2007. Over the next few months, Peter was admitted to hospital on two occasions suffering from injuries including bruising, scratches and swelling on the side of the head. Connelly was arrested again in May 2007.
In June 2007, a social worker observed marks on Peter and informed the police. A medical examination concluded that the bruising was due to abuse. On 4 June, the baby was placed with a friend for safeguarding. Over a month later, on 25 July, Haringey Council's Children & Young People's Service obtained legal advice which indicated that the "threshold for initiating Care Proceedings...was not met".
On 1 August 2007, Baby Peter was seen at St. Ann's Hospital in north London by locum paediatrician Dr. Sabah Al-Zayyat. Serious injuries, including a broken back and broken ribs, very likely went undetected (the autopsy report believed these to have pre-dated Al-Zayyat's examination). A day later, Connelly was informed that she would not be prosecuted.
The next day, an ambulance was called and Peter was found in his cot, blue and clad only in a nappy. After attempts at resuscitation, he was taken to North Middlesex hospital with his mother but was pronounced dead at 12:20 pm. A post-mortem revealed he had swallowed a tooth after being punched. Other injuries included a broken back, broken ribs, mutilated fingertips and fingernails missing.
The police immediately began a murder investigation and Baby P's mother was arrested. So too were Barker, his brother Jason Owen and his 15-year-old girlfriend, who had fled to and were hiding in a campsite in Epping Forest.
Conviction.
On 11 November 2008, Owen, 36, and his brother Barker, 32, were found guilty of "causing or allowing the death of a child or vulnerable person". Connelly, 27, had pleaded guilty to this charge. Earlier in the trial, Owen and Connelly had been cleared of murder due to insufficient evidence. Barker was found not guilty of murder by a jury.
A second trial occurred in April 2009, when Connelly and Barker, under aliases, faced charges related to the rape of a two-year old girl. The girl was also on Haringey's child protection register. Barker was found guilty of rape, while Connelly was found not guilty of child cruelty charges. Their defence lawyers argued that this second trial was nearly undermined by bloggers publishing information (linking them to the death of Peter) which could have prejudiced the jury.
Sentencing for both trials together took place on 22 May 2009 at the Old Bailey. Connelly was ordered to be held indefinitely, until "deemed no longer to be a risk to the public and in particular to small children", with a minimum term of five years. Barker was sentenced to life imprisonment for the rape, with a minimum sentence of ten years, and a 12-year sentence for his role in the death of Peter, to run concurrently. Owen was also jailed indefinitely, and would serve at least three years. The sentences were criticised as too lenient by the NSPCC's chief executive, and the Attorney General considered referring them to the Court of Appeal for review, but concluded there was "no realistic prospect" of the Court of Appeal increasing the sentences. The three appealed against their sentences, Barker against both convictions and sentences.
Aftermath.
Internal inquiry.
Haringey Council initiated an internal audit Serious Case Review (SCR) after Peter's death. After completion of the court case, only an executive summary was released to the public. The full report was kept confidential, with only some employees of Haringey Council and Haringey Labour councillors allowed access. The two local MPs whose constituencies cover Haringey (Lynne Featherstone and David Lammy), leader of the opposition Robert Gorrie, and opposition spokesperson for Children's Services were asked to sign non-disclosure agreements to view the document. Ed Balls condemned the Serious Case Review and called for a second report with an independent adjudicator.
"The Mail on Sunday" on 15 March 2009 reported that details of the SCR had come into its possession. The article claimed that the executive summary of the SCR either conflicted or omitted details about how the case had been handled and the extent of the injuries suffered by Peter. Furthermore, there were instances of mishandling by officials, missed and delayed meetings, miscommunication among officials, and a failure to follow through with decisions related to the child's safety. It also noted among other issues that officials had not followed through with obtaining an "interim care order" that would have removed Peter from his home when they had agreed that legal grounds had existed for doing so six months before he died; key officials also failed to attend a 25 July 2007 meeting intended to decide if it would be necessary to remove Peter from his mother's home at that time.
External reports and inquiries.
Lynne Featherstone MP was critical of Haringey Council, writing "I personally met with George Meehan and Ita O'Donovan - Haringey Council's leader and chief executive - to raise with them three different cases, where the pattern was in each case Haringey seeming to want to blame anyone who complained rather than to look at the complaint seriously. I was promised action - but despite repeated subsequent requests for news on progress - I was just stonewalled."
Three council workers, including one senior lawyer, were given written warnings about their actions.
The GMC separately examined the roles of two doctors — Dr. Jerome Ikwueke, a GP, and Dr. Sabah Al-Zayyat, who examined Peter two days before his death. Although Dr. Ikwueke had twice referred Peter to hospital specialists, the GMC's Interim Orders Panel suspended Dr. Ikwueke for 18 months. Dr. Al-Zayyat, who has been accused of failing to spot his injuries, was suspended pending an inquiry. Her contract with Great Ormond Street Hospital, responsible for child services in Haringey, has also been terminated.
Ed Balls, Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, ordered an external inquiry into Haringey Council Social Services. The inquiry was not to examine the 'Baby P' case explicitly, but look into whether Haringey Social Services were following correct procedures in general. This report was presented to ministers on 1 December 2008. During a press conference that day, the Minister announced that, in an unusual move, he had used special powers to remove Sharon Shoesmith from her post of head of children's services at Haringey Council. She rejected calls for her resignation, saying that she wanted to continue to support her staff during the investigations, but was dismissed on 8 December 2008, by Haringey Council, without any compensation package. Shoesmith later brought legal proceedings against Ed Balls, Ofsted, and Haringey Council, claiming that the decisions which led to her dismissal were unfair. The High Court dismissed this claim in April 2010, although Shoesmith was still entitled to pursue an action for unfair dismissal in an Employment Tribunal. In May 2011, Shoesmith's appeal against that succeeded in the Court of Appeal; the Department of Education and Haringey Council said they intended to appeal to the Supreme Court against this decision. Their applications for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court were refused on 1 August 2011. It was reported by BBC News on 29 October 2013 that Sharon Shoesmith agreed a six-figure payout for unfair dismissal.
Also announced on 1 December 2008, were the resignations of Labour Council leader George Meehan and councillor Liz Santry, cabinet member for Children and Young People. These councillors had previously refused calls for their resignation during a 24 November council meeting. In April 2009, the council announced that its deputy director of children's services, two other managers and a social worker, who had been suspended pending an enquiry, had also all been dismissed.
Three further inquires were also ordered:
The DES, now the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF), was sent a letter in February 2007 (six months before the death of Baby P), containing an allegation that child protection procedures were not being followed in Haringey, from a lawyer acting for a former social worker, who sent the letter to the then health secretary, Patricia Hewitt, who merely forwarded the letter on to the DCSF. Haringey Council then took out an injunction against the social worker, Nevres Kemal, banning her from speaking about child care in Haringey. Kemal's lawyer stated: "Hewitt bounced us onto the DES... the DES then advised us to write to the Commission for Social Care Inspection whom we had written to on the same day as we had written to Hewitt, copying in the letter to Hewitt and the relevant material. By that time of course they had an injunction against us so we couldn't go back to the inspectorate. The inspectorate had been properly advised at the time and had done nothing."
Report by Lord Laming.
Lord Laming published his report, "The Protection of Children in England: A Progress Report" on 12 March 2009. It stated that too many authorities had failed to adopt reforms introduced following his previous review into welfare following the death of Victoria Climbié in 2000.
Libel action.
On 5 March 2012, the natural father of Baby P was awarded £75,000 in damages after "The People" wrongly stated in its 19 September 2010 edition that he was a convicted sex offender. Lawyers for the man, known only as "KC", said that the publishers of "The People" were guilty of "one of the gravest libels imaginable". Publishers MGN had previously apologised and offered to pay damages.

North West Atlantic. Range covers both subprovinces of Acadian and Virginian. Range: 41.67°N to 34.65°N; 75.58°W to 65.77°W. Distribution: USA: Massachusetts, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina; 41.67°N to 34.65°N; 75.58°W to 65.77°W.
Description.
The maximum recorded shell length is 33 mm.
The large, strong shell is regularly conical, with a flattened base, and lacks an umbilicus, It is yellowish white or light yellow, with more or less numerous narrow, spiral bands of pale brown or dark brown, and with large squarish spots of bright rosy red on the spire. The nine or ten whorls are flattened, or concave, below the suture, which is not impressed. The body whorl has eight to ten conspicuous, raised, nodulous revolving ribs, of which three or four are much smaller and alternate with the larger ones. The strongest rib is just below the suture. The interstices are
concave, brownish, glossy, and obliquely striated by the lines of growth. Sometimes they show subordinate, revolving, raised lines. The four principal ribs are continued on the upper whorls, but the intermediate ones gradually disappear on the middle whorls. The whitish nodules on the ribs are prominent, rounded and smooth, and extend to near the apex. The nuclear whorl is smooth. The next ones contain three carinae. The base of the shell has about twelve spiral, nodulous ribs with some intermediate, smaller ones. The umbilical region is slightly excavated spirally. The columella is strongly concave, terminating in an indistinct tooth.
The yellowish animal has long tentacles, and four long cirri on each side. The eyes are well developed. The radula is somewhat different from the typical
species of the genus; there is no large lateral tooth, between the inner and outer series. The outermost tetth are broad, flat, curved. The operculum is thin, circular, and with many narrow whorls.
Habitat.
Minimum recorded depth is 68 m. Maximum recorded depth is 1170 m.

Calliostoma canaliculatum

Calliostoma canaliculatum, common name the channeled topsnail, is a species of small sea snail with gills and an operculum, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Calliostomatidae, the calliostoma top snails.
The name of the species "Calliostoma canaliculatum" (Sasao & Habe, 1973) is preoccupied in "Calliostoma", by "Calliostoma canaliculatum" (Lightfoot, 1786), but not in "Tristichotrochus", which is where it is placed by some authors. It is currently a secondary homonym but it has not replaced the preoccupied name because the replacement name would be synonymized sooner or later.
Description.
The size of the shell varies between 16 mm and 39 mm.
Shell white to buff with raised spiral ribs, interspaces brownish, a small blue stain adjacent to the columnella. Height 15 to 35 mm.
The thin , imperforate shell has a conical shape with a flat base. It is fawn colored with yellowish white lirae. The surface of the whorls is encircled by numerous sharply sculptured, smooth, narrow, cord-like lirae, subequal or alternately smaller. The base contains 11 to 13 similar ones. On the upper
whorls the lirae are fewer, and in well preserved individuals the second whorl is minutely beaded above. The spire is conic, with nearly straight outlines. The sutures are impressed. Tyhe spire contains 7-8 whorls, with the last obtusely angular, flat beneath and impressed around the axis. The oblique aperture is rhombic, iridescent and sulcated inside. The thin peristome is acute. The columella is straightened, not truncate below, dilated in a pearly iridescent pad above, bounded by an opaque white deposit.
Distribution.

Simon Kaspé

Simon Kaspé (died 1933) was a Jewish resident of Harbin, Manchuria, who was kidnapped, ransomed, tortured and murdered by a gang of fascist Russian criminals under the influence of Konstantin Rodzaevsky. The half-hearted investigation into his death by the Japanese authorities, who were attempting to court the White Russian community as local enforcers and for their Anti-Communist sentiments, sparked anti-Japanese sentiment among the Jewish community of Manchukuo, and the flight of nearly 70% of the Jews of Harbin.
Simon Kaspé was the son of Joseph Kaspé, owner of Harbin's Hôtel Moderne along with most of the city's cinemas and theaters. Joseph Kaspé fled persecution in Russia, moving to Harbin in 1907. Originally stateless, he obtained French citizenship both for himself and his family. Simon grew up in Harbin, but studied for a time at the Paris Conservatory and was an accomplished pianist.
Kidnap and murder.
Simon was home in Harbin for summer vacation from the Conservatory in August 1933 when, returning from an outing with his girlfriend, he was kidnapped. His attackers came up behind him, and took him to a site some 36 miles west of the city. The following day, his father received a ransom note demanding $100,000.
Joseph Kaspé contacted the French consul in Harbin, who delayed the paying of the ransom, promising to cooperate with the Japanese authorities in finding Simon. A month later, half a bloody ear was sent to Kaspé. Again he was advised to not pay the ransom. However, the body of his son was found by the police on December 3, 1933. Simon Kaspé had been starved and beaten by his kidnappers, who cut off his ears, ripped off his fingernails, and forced him to keep his head in a dark, cold hole in the ground as temperatures dropped to 20 and 30 degrees below zero. His captors had killed him with a gunshot to the head.
Thousands of individuals from many communities attended the funeral protesting. While it has been said that Harbin was a "paradise in the twenties," the Japanese occupation, and the presence of between 100,000 to 200,000 Russian White émigrés fleeing from Russia involved in the White movement brought civilian crime lords, some of whom practised kidnapping for ransoms. Protests by the Jewish communities of Harbin and Shanghai to Japanese vice-foreign minister Shigemitsu Mamoru had no effect. 
The kidnappers were arrested and released the following day, but after their conviction in court, the Chinese judge was brought up on charges of treason. The kidnappers were retried, and sentenced to 15–20 years in prison, then released several weeks later on amnesty, due to Rodzaevsky's pleas that a "patriotic" anti-Communist agenda had been the only premise for the plot, which was thought up by of one of his top lieutenants, named Martinoff, who along with his gang was responsible for kidnappings, targeted Jews and terrorized the city of Harbin.
Aftermath.
By the mid-1930s, the Jewish population halved in response to economic depression and events relating to the murder of Simon Kaspé going to Shanghai, Chinese cities not under Japanese control, or even back to the Soviet Union, despite the fact that many had come to China originally fleeing persecution there.

Michael Liddle

Michael William Liddle (born 25 December 1989) is a footballer who plays as a defender for Accrington Stanley. He began his club career with Sunderland, though appeared only once for the first team, and spent time on loan at Carlisle United, Leyton Orient, Gateshead and Accrington Stanley, before joining the latter club on a permanent basis in 2012. He has also played for the under-18, under-19, and under-21 Ireland sides.
Club career.
Liddle started his footballing career with Haydon Bridge and Sunderland, whom he joined as a youth player. At Sunderland he progressed through the youth side, until he was given a professional contract ahead of the 2008–09 season. It took until January 2010 for him to make his first-team debut in a FA Cup third-round match at home to Barrow; he came on as a substitute late in the game which Sunderland won 3–0.
On 14 November 2008 he secured a loan deal at Carlisle United, where he joined up with Graham Kavanagh, who was also on loan at Carlisle from Sunderland. His debut for the Cumbrians came the following day; he started against Brighton & Hove Albion as Carlisle won 3–1. The loan was first extended until 14 February, and then to the end of the season.
On 5 August 2010, Liddle signed a four-month loan deal with Leyton Orient, but returned to Sunderland after only a month because of a groin injury he suffered on his only appearance, against Yeovil Town.
On 6 January 2011, Liddle joined Gateshead on a 28-day loan. He made his debut for Gateshead two days later, scoring his first senior goal in a 2–2 draw against Kidderminster Harriers, which was voted Gateshead's goal of the season. His loan deal was extended to the end of the 2010–11 season.
Liddle joined League Two club Accrington Stanley on loan for an initial month on 24 February 2012, and made his debut the next day in a 2–0 loss against Swindon Town. He was sent off against Southend United on 10 March, and initially was sent back to parent club Sunderland. However after a defensive injury crisis, he returned to Stanley on loan until the end of the season.
On 18 July 2012, Liddle signed a one-year permanent deal for Accrington Stanley for an undisclosed fee. He began the season in the starting eleven for the first round of the League Cup, as Stanley lost 1–0 to his former club, Carlisle United, and kept his place for the opening league, a 1–0 win over Southend United. Liddle was sent off, for the second time in his Stanley career, in a 4–3 defeat to Chesterfield on 18 September. After the match, Liddle then served his three match ban. Later in the season, Liddle would be often used in first team ins and out in his first season, having spent time on the bench, in numbers of games. He signed a new one-year contract ahead of the 2013–14 season.
International career.
Liddle, although born in England, qualifies to play for Ireland due to his Irish mother. After playing in the under-18s and under-19s for his country, Liddle was called up to Ireland's under-21 squad for a friendly against Austria under-21 on 19 August 2008. At this stage he had not made an appearance for his club after being signed on a professional contract in the 2008–09 season. Sunderland manager, Roy Keane, commented that "The young players have done well. It's a real plus for us and I have no doubts that some of them will be able to handle it at the top level". He started against Austria, in a 1–1 draw, Liddle expressed his surprise after the call up, saying "The call-up came as a big surprise. I didn't expect it. When I was named in the starting eleven buzzing!" He made further appearances against Bulgaria, Portugal, Lithuania and Germany.

Horace Lyne

Horace Sampson Lyne MBE (31 December 1860 - 1 May 1949) was a Welsh international rugby union forward who played club rugby for Newport Rugby Football Club. He won five caps for Wales and after retiring from playing rugby became the longest serving president of the Welsh Rugby Union. Lyne is also notable as one of the six representatives that set up the International Rugby Board.
Playing career.
Lyne played most of his club rugby with Newport, spending 8 seasons with the club between 1878 and 1885. He captained Newport in his final full season in 1883/1884. Lyne was first selected for Wales during the 1883 Home Nations Championship in an away match at Raeburn Park to Scotland. This was the first time that the two teams had played each other, and Wales, under the captaincy of Charles Lewis, lost by three goals to one. Lyne played in the next four Welsh games, including all three games of the 1884 Championship and the opening game of the 1885 Championship, which was against England at St Helens in Swansea. He retired from playing rugby in 1885 but continued his association with the game when in 1885 he refereed the match between England and Ireland.
International matches played.
Wales
Administrative career.
Lyne had taken a clear interest in the affairs of Welsh rugby while still a player, but on his retirement from playing he began applying for administritive posts within the sport. In 1887 Lyne, along with WRU secretary Richard Mullock, became one of the Welsh representatives of the International Board, the body set up to regulate the sport in Britain. Lyne would serve on the board of the IB, later becoming the International Rugby Board, from 1887 to 1938. Lyne was in demand as an administrator and was seen as very fairminded. He was also a forward thinker, and voiced concerns regarding the North of England breaking away from the IRB, years before the formation of rugby league. As the chair of the Welsh Football Union, he met up with Neath secretary, Walter E. Rees, the man with whom he would run the WRU for near four decades. In 1892 Lyne was voted in as one of four vice-presidents of the WRU, with joint responsibilities for Cardiff and the East area. During the same meeting, Mullock, who was extremely unpopular with the Welsh rugby clubs, was replaced as secretary by William Gwynn.
In 1906, Lyne replaced Sir John T. Llewellyn as the President of the Welsh Rugby Union, a role he would hold until 1947 making him the longest serving president. He was proceeded by Sir David Rocyn-Jones.
Lyne was also the Chairman of Newport Athletic Club from 1894 to 1949.

Ryan Burge

Ryan James Burge (born 12 October 1988) is an English football midfielder who plays for League Two club Newport County.
He had an unusual start to his career, playing on trial for clubs as far apart as the Netherlands, Japan, and England. He was under contract at Birmingham City, Barnet and Japanese side Machida Zelvia. He joined the Glenn Hoddle Academy in Spain in summer 2009. From there he was sent out to Worcester City, Jerez Industrial, Doncaster Rovers, and Oxford United to gain first team experience. In June 2011 he signed with Port Vale via Hyde (partners of the Hoddle Academy). He left Port Vale in April 2013 after falling out with the club's management, and signed with Newport County four months later.
Playing career.
Early career.
Born in Cheltenham, Burge scored 60 goals in a single season for Cheltenham YMCA as a child. He later spent a year at West Bromwich Albion, before playing alongside Daniel Sturridge at Cadbury Athletic. He also had a spell with Coventry City, and trialled for AFC Ajax in the Netherlands, before trialing with Manchester United.
Birmingham City.
After being tracked by both Manchester United and Manchester City, he instead began his professional career at Birmingham City, where he signed a three-year contract at the age of 17. Following the departure of manager Steve Bruce, Burge left the club by mutual consent in March 2008. He went on trial at League Two club Hereford United and League One side Cheltenham Town. He was verbally offered a short-term contract by Cheltenham manager Keith Downing, but the deal collapsed after Downing was replaced as the Cheltenham manager by Martin Allen. He instead joined up with League Two side Barnet. He made his debut for Barnet in the 4–0 home defeat by Notts County on 15 November 2008. This was the only appearance he made before his time there was disrupted by appendicitis, which ruled him out for four weeks. The club released him in January 2009.
Searching for a new club.
In February 2009, Burge travelled to Japan (birthplace of his step-mother) in the hope of securing a contract with a J-League club. He spent a week trialling with Division Two side Avispa Fukuoka, followed by a trial period at Division One outfit Oita Trinita. Top-flight sides F.C. Tokyo and Sagan Tosu also expressed an interest in Burge, as he was tested at Kokushikan University against players such as Hidetoshi Nakata. He later joined third-tier side Machida Zelvia, where he made a handful of appearances. Burge said that the clubs in Japan appreciate inexperienced but technical players and ""they don't just go for big lumps that head it and kick people"", he also said that he enjoyed his experience playing in Japan.
The Glenn Hoddle Academy.
In July 2009, Burge was forced to return to England due to issues with his visa. He participated in a pre-season friendly against Malmesbury Victoria for Conference National side Forest Green Rovers. He was offered a contract, but rejected it and joined the Glenn Hoddle Academy in Spain on a two-year deal stating he felt it would help to improve his technical skill. Burge scored the quickest goal in the academy's history, netting against Spanish side San Fernando after just 12 seconds. In March 2010, Burge played once for Conference South club Worcester City, by arrangement with the Academy. In the 2010–11 season, Burge played for Jerez Industrial, the Spanish fourth-tier club connected with the Hoddle Academy. He became established in the centre of the midfield after he recovered from numerous injury problems. He was sent off twice in 13 games and won the club's Player of the Month award for October 2010. They were in contention for promotion to the Segunda B when a November 2010 article on the BBC Sport website described Burge as "the current star of the side".
Doncaster Rovers.
Burge moved to Championship club Doncaster Rovers on a short term deal on transfer deadline day, 31 January 2011. He made his Doncaster debut as a second-half substitute in a 6–0 home defeat to Ipswich Town on 15 February. That was to be his only appearance for the club. On 17 March, Burge joined Oxford United on loan for the rest of the season, after impressing in a reserves game against Colchester United which Oxford won 2–0. He went straight into the starting eleven for the match against Crewe Alexandra two days later, and provided the assist for James Constable's winning goal. His first performance at Oxford received praise in the local media. A week later, Steve MacLean opened the scoring against Burton Albion, but Burge reportedly claimed the goal after the ball took a deflection off his heel on its way into the net for what would have been his first Football League goal. In mid-April he was recalled by his parent club Doncaster, and a few weeks later they offered him a new deal.
Hyde to Port Vale.
In June 2011 he was signed to a two-year deal by Micky Adams' Port Vale. The League Two club had to pay Conference North side Hyde a small undisclosed fee, as the non-League side secured his contract from their partnership with the Glenn Hoddle Academy. He missed the start of the 2011–12 season with a knee injury, and in November it was revealed that he would have to undergo surgery to correct the problem. He did not feature in matchday squads for the rest of the season, and was transfer listed in May 2012. The door to the first team remained open though, after Burge had an encouraging and injury-free pre-season.
He came off the bench on 14 August 2012 – his first competitive game for twelve months – and "pulled the strings to help Vale control the second half" in a League Cup defeat to Championship side Burnley. He made his long-awaited league debut at Vale Park four days later, replacing Chris Shuker 79 minutes into a 3–0 win over Barnet. Despite some impressive cameo appearances from the bench, a streak of wins kept Burge out of the first eleven until 29 September, when he made his first league start for the club at Valley Parade, in a 1–0 win over Bradford City. He scored his first goal for the club in the Football League Trophy at the Bescot Stadium; his 20-yard left-footed strike helped the "Valiants" to battle to a 2–2 draw with Walsall, though he missed his penalty in the shoot-out victory. He opened the scoring in a 2–2 home draw with York City on 17 November, and was selected on the League Two Team of the Week for his performance. 
He established himself in central midfield over the new year with "a string of impressive performances". However on 12 March he missed a pre-match team meal, but claimed he made his own way for the match against Bristol Rovers, only to be informed that he was not in the matchday squad when he was just five minutes away from Bristol. He took to Twitter to put his side of the story across, and an angry Micky Adams responded by saying Burge's tweets were "absolute nonsense and he's going to be disciplined". Burge refused to apologise for the incident, and was suspended by the club for two weeks. On 12 April, with three games left to go of the season, Burge left the club by mutual consent. Club chairman Paul Wildes stated that "this has been a difficult decision for both parties". Vale secured promotion into League One at the end of the 2012–13 season.
Newport County.
Burge was linked with a move to Peterborough United in May 2013, though also stated that "I am confident I could do a job at Championship level". He also had a trial spell with Burnley. He eventually signed a contract with League Two side Newport County on 30 August.
Style of play.
Keith Downing described Burge as "aggressive" and that Burge is "technically good and has a good frame". After arriving at Port Vale from Hyde in June 2011, Vale manager Micky Adams stated, "Ryan is a creative central midfielder and will bring plenty of quality on the ball, but he is also a very hard-working individual". Neil Duncanson, the Glenn Hoddle Academy's commercial director said: "Ryan is very strong, powerful and suited to the front of a diamond in central midfield. He's a creative player who can take an excellent dead ball". Burge has said of himself that "I'm a midfield player who likes to put my foot in, as well as to get on the ball and create things. I try to be an all-round midfield player and do a bit of everything".
Personal life.
His grandfather, Rod Burge, has been a member of Cheltenham Town's board of directors for many years.

<doc id="20222724" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20222724" title="Negative-state relief model">
Negative-state relief model

The negative-state relief model states that human beings have an innate drive to reduce negative moods. They can be reduced by engaging in any mood-elevating behavior, including helping behavior, as it is paired with positive value such as smiles and thank you. Thus negative mood increases helpfulness because helping others can reduce one's own bad feelings (Baumann, Cialdini, & Kenrick, 1981).
Supporting evidence.
In a classic experiment, subjects had their negative mood induced and were given an opportunity to help others. Between negative mood induction and helping, half of the subjects received something pleasurable, while the others did not. Those subjects without gratifying intervention before helped more significantly than those with. It was argued that the pleasurable intervention relieved subjects’ mood, and hence, altruism was not required to elevate their mood (Cialdini et al., 1973).
Under negative state relief model, helping behaviors are motivated by one’s egoistic desires. In Manucia’s study (1979), the hedonistic nature of helping behavior was revealed and negative relief model was supported. Subjects were divided into 3 groups – happy, neutral and sad mood groups. Half of the subjects in each group were made to believe that their induced mood was fixed temporarily. Another half group believed that their mood was changeable. The results showed that saddened subjects helped more when they believed that their mood was changeable. The results supported the egoistic nature of helping behaviors as well as the negative state relief model.
Hedonistic nature of negative state relief model was supported in some literatures. For example, Weyant (1978) found that negative mood induction increased helping in his subjects when the cost of helping was low and the benefits were high. In an experiment with school children subjects, negative mood led to increased helping only when the helping opportunity offered the chance of direct social reward for their generosity (Kenrick, Baumann, & Cialdini, 1979).
It was found in another study that empathic orientation to the suffering increased one’s personal sadness. Despite high level of empathy, when the subjects were made to perceive their sadness as unchangeable, they helped less. Helping behaviors were predicted well by one’s sad mood rather than the empathy level (Cialdini et al., 1987).
Challenges.
There have been challenges on the negative state relief model since 1980’s. Daniel Batson (1989) and his associates found out that regardless of anticipated mood enhancement, high-empathy subjects helped more than low-empathy subjects. In other words, high-empathy subjects would still helped more either under easy escape conditions or even when they could probably get good mood to relieve from negative state without helping. Therefore, they concluded that, obviously, something other than relieving negative state was motivating the helping behavior of the high-empathy subjects in their studies. It contradicted with the theory proposed by Robert Cialdini (1987) which supported that empathy-altruism hypothesis was actually the product of an entirely egoistic desire for personal mood management.
Many researchers have challenged the generalizability of the model. It was found that effect of negative state relief on helping behavior varied with ages (Cialdini & Kenrick, 1976). For very young children, a negative mood would not increase their helpfulness because they had not yet learned to associate prosocial behavior with social rewards. Grade-school children who had been socialized to an awareness of the helping norm (but had not fully internalized it) would help more in response to negative affect only when someone gave them reinforcements or rewards (Kenrick et al., 1979). For adults, however, helpfulness has become self-reinforcing; therefore, a negative mood reliably increased helping. However, according to the study conducted by Kenrick (1979), negative emotions in children promoted their helping behaviors if direct rewards were possibly provided for their prosocial behaviors.
Negative affect was treated as a generalized state in negative state relief model (Carlson & Miller, 1987). Specific types of negative feelings that increase helping - guilt, embarrassment, or awareness of cognitive inconsistency (Apsler, 1975; Carlsmith & Gross, 1969; Kidd & Berkowitz, 1976), were not viewed as uniquely important. They just fell within the general category of negative mood (Cialdini et al., 1976). According to the model, not all negative feeling states boost helping. For instance, anger and frustration, naturally elicited responses contradictory to helping, would not increase helping (Cialdini, Baumann, & Kenrick, 1981).
Example.
On 26 Dec 2004, there was a great tsunami striking the coasts of most landmasses bordering the Indian Ocean, killing more than 225,000 people in eleven countries. It was one of the deadliest natural disasters in history. Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, and Thailand were among approximately 14 countries to experience the death of thousands of locals and tourists. After the propagation of the sorrowful news, people around the world initiated donation campaigns immediately. Besides donations from governments, the public donated at the same time. For example, in the first few days, British donated 1 million pounds. Overall, the public around the world donated 470 million USD. The sight of victims in media caused negative emotion, like the sadness over deaths, on the donors. Therefore their donation helped reduce these negative feelings according to the model.
Besides the disaster mentioned above, there are also daily examples. When a person sitting in a bus witnesses a pregnant woman or an old person standing, negative affect will be induced on the witness. Giving seat to the persons in need can instrumentally restore the bystander’s mood as helping contains a rewarding component for most socialized people.
Future study direction and conclusion.
The nature of helping has been debated for a long time. On the one hand, under the negative state relief model, the ultimate goal of helping is to relieve bystander’s negative mood, thus, pro-social behaviors are viewed as the results of helper’s selfishness and egoism. On the other hand, some disagree with this stance, and think that empathy, other than negative states, leads to helping behaviors. The debate continues, and it is thought that there is still a long run before reaching a consensus on the nature of helping.
In recent years, a large body of researches showed that motivations to help are different in different relationships and across different contexts. For example, it was found that empathic concern was linked to the willingness to help kin but not a stranger when egoistic motivators were controlled (Maner & Gailliot, 2007). To get a more comprehensive view, future studies should test the negative state relief model under different contexts. Such explorations would be crucial to dig out the contextual effects and psychological factors underlying prosocial behaviors.

A&amp;P Group

A&P Group Ltd is the largest ship repair and conversion company in the UK, with three shipyards located in Hebburn, Middlesbrough and Falmouth. The Company undertakes a wide variety of maintenance and repair work on commercial and military ships with projects ranging from a two day alongside repair period through to multimillion UK pound conversion projects lasting for a year or more.
As one of only two remaining significant commercial ship repair companies in the United Kingdom, along with Cammell Laird, A&P Group has become a centre of excellence for ship owners and managers operating in North West Europe and continues to grow a profitable and successful business employing over 1,000 skilled staff (678 employees in 2013 plus agency workers) in the North East and South West of England.
History.
Corporate history.
The A&P Group was formed in Sunderland as Austin & Pickersgill in 1954 by the merger of S.P. Austin & Son Ltd (founded by Samuel Peter Austin in c.1826) and William Pickersgill & Sons Ltd (founded c. 1838). After the merger Austin's Wear Dock yard was used for repair while shipbuilding was concentrated at Pickersgill's Southwick Yard. The latter was modernised with the introduction of large assembly shops and prefabrication processes. This reduced costs and increased the maximum size of a vessel that the yard could build from 10,000 to 40,000 tons deadweight.
In 1957 a consortium of three companies led by London & Overseas Freighters Ltd. (LOF) took over Austin & Pickersgill. In October 1968 Austin & Pickersgill took over Bartram & Sons Ltd, whose South Dock yard was also in Sunderland. In 1970 London and Overseas Freighters bought out the other members of the consortium to take 100% ownership of Austin & Pickersgill.
In 1977 Austin & Pickersgill was nationalised as a member company of British Shipbuilders. In 1986 the Company was merged with Sunderland Shipbuilders Ltd to form North East Shipbuilders Ltd. However both the Southwick and the Doxford Pallion Shipbuilding Yards closed in 1988 following negotiations with the European Commission to reduce shipbuilding capacity in the UK.
In 1989 the Company was privatised and adopted the name A&P Appledore International to reflect the acquisition of Appledore Shipbuilders. The Company then focused on shiprepairs rather than shipbuilding, becoming A&P Group in 1995 and being acquired by Royal Bank of Scotland in 1997.
In 2001 the A&P acquired Cammell Laird's shipyards at Birkenhead, Teesside and Tyneside 
In 2005 A&P sold the Birkenhead yard to Northwestern Shiprepairers & Shipbuilders and closed its facilities in Southampton (King George V Dock) and the four dock complex in Wallsend, near Newcastle upon Tyne, in order to focus all ship repair activity in its newer facilities in Hebburn (A&P Tyne), A&P Tees at Middlesbrough was also retained to support the important Southern North Sea offshore oil and gas operations and dredging contractors; the strategically situated Falmouth operation (A&P Falmouth) was also retained.
In 2009 A&P was fully acquired by Cardiff property developer Bailey Group. The company had previously acquired a 50% stake in 2006.
In 2011 it was acquired by the shareholders of Cammell Laird.
Ship Production.
A&P maximised the competitiveness of its prefabrication process by producing ships to standard designs rather than individual specifications. From 1962 onwards the company offered standard bulk carriers in a range of sizes designated according to tonnage.
A&P's most numerous product was another of its standard designs, the SD14 shelter deck cargo ship. During the Second World War, shipyards in the USA had delivered more than 2,700 Liberty ship shelter deck cargo ships. By the 1960s many Liberty ships were reaching the end of their service lives, so in 1965 A&P started to develop a low-cost shelter-deck cargo vessel to replace them.
A&P invited other UK shipbuilders to tender for licences to produce SD14's, but by 1966 only Bartram's could meet A&P's requirement to build each ship to a selling price of £915,000. Both Bartram's and A&P built their first SD14's in 1967 and handed them to their new owners in February 1968. A&P's takeover of Bartram's followed in October.
In 1967 A&P licenced Hellenic Shipyards Co. of Skaramangas in Greece to build twenty SD14's. In 1971 A&P licenced Companhia Comércio e Navegação to build SD14's at Mauá in Brazil.
In 1973 Robb Caledon Shipbuilding of Dundee in Scotland contracted to build three SD14's. Astilleros y Fábricas Navales del Estado also obtained permission to build six SD14's in its yard at Ensenada in Argentina.
By the time production ceased, 211 SD14's had been built either at A&P's Southwick and South Dock yards and or by licencees in Greece, Brazil, Scotland and Argentina. The largest volume of sales was to Greek shipowners. The SD14 and B-series standard ship designs, and the prefabrication methods by which they were built enabled A&P to maintain a full order book until nationalisation in 1977, in contrast to many other UK shipbuilders in that era.
Current Operations.
A&P Tyne.
A&P Tyne is located at Hebburn, Tyne and Wear, UK and is positioned along the River Tyne.

The yard has six cranes, with a total load capacity of 60 tonnes. It has also a steel fabrication shed, engineering workshop, electrical workshop and joinery workshop.
Health and safety breaches.
In November 2009 A&P Falmouth pleaded guilty to breaching Section 2 (1) of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 following the death of an employee in August 2006 from crush injuries at Falmouth Docks and was fined £85,000.
Toxic waste charge.
A&P Falmouth was charged under the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 by the Marine Management Organisation (MMO) following the alleged illegal dumping of toxic sediment during the development of Falmouth Marina. The MMO alleges that A&P allowed silt contaminated with the biocide TBT - one of the most dangerous substances ever deliberately introduced into the marine environment - to be dumped without a licence between March and December 2007, and:
In December 2010 A&P Ports and Properties Ltd ordered to pay more than £600,000 after:

William Forbes-Sempill, 17th Lord Sempill

William Forbes-Sempill, 17th Lord Sempill (20 May 1836 – 21 July 1905), born William Forbes, was a Scottish peer, the 17th Lord Sempill and 8th Baronet of Craigievar.
He was the son of Sir John Forbes, 7th Baronet, and succeeded his father to the baronetcy on his death in February 1846, at the age of seven. He was educated at Eton and then joined the Coldstream Guards in 1854; he served in the Crimean War, rising to the rank of Captain. In 1884, he inherited the title of Lord Sempill from his relation Maria Jane Sempill, 16th Lady Sempill, and adopted the surname of Sempill.
He married three times, the first time in 1858 to Caroline, the only daughter of Sir Charles Forbes, 3rd Baronet; this ended in divorce in 1861, after the birth of one daughter, Katherine. The second marriage was in 1862 to Frances Emily Abercromby, the youngest daughter of Sir Robert Abercromby, 5th Baronet, in 1862. They had six children, four sons and two daughters. All four of the sons served in the military; the eldest, John commanded a battalion of the Black Watch at the Battle of Loos. Douglas, a Major in the Seaforth Highlanders, was killed on the North-West Frontier of India in 1908, whilst Robert was killed in the Battle of the Somme serving with the Gordon Highlanders. The youngest of the four, Arthur, was in the Royal Navy, and survived the Battle of Jutland. The elder daughter, Evelyn, married Duncan Vernon Pirie MP, whilst the younger, Gertrude, never married. The third marriage was in 1890, to Mary Sherbrooke.
On his death in 1905, his titles were inherited by his son John.

Cowgirls Don't Cry

"Cowgirls Don't Cry" is the fourth and final single recorded by American country music duo Brooks & Dunn on their final studio album "Cowboy Town". It was written by Ronnie Dunn, one-half of the duo, and Terry McBride, former lead singer of McBride & the Ride. One month after its chart entry, it was re-recorded and re-released as a collaboration with Reba McEntire. The song is Brooks & Dunn's 41st and final Top Ten hit on the "Billboard" country charts, and McEntire's fifty-sixth.
Content.
"Cowgirls Don't Cry" is a mid-tempo with a fiddle intro. Its lyric focuses on a female character who faces hardship. In the first verse, she is a little girl who has just been given a pony to ride, and although she repeatedly falls off, she does not cry. By the second verse, she is an adult, and her husband is having an affair, although again she does not cry. She discovers in the third verse that her father is dying, and places a phone call to him. He then tells her, "Cowgirl, don't cry".
Re-release.
An alternate version of this song that features Reba McEntire's vocals on the final chorus was released to radio after she and the duo performed the song on the Country Music Association Awards on Wednesday, November 12, 2008. In addition, a video was released that featured both the duo and McEntire. Starting with the chart week of November 29, 2008, the song was credited on the U.S. country charts as "Brooks & Dunn featuring Reba McEntire". The Reba McEntire collaboration was officially released as a digital single on February 10, 2009. The duet version features a key change in the final chorus, which is not present in the original recording. This re-release is the version that appears on the compilation album "#1s… and Then Some".
Chart performance.
On the chart week of January 31, 2009, the song entered Top Ten on the "Billboard" country singles charts, giving Brooks & Dunn their forty-first and final Top Ten hit and breaking a record previously held by Alabama for the most Top Ten country hits by a duo or group. In addition, it became McEntire's fifty-sixth Top Ten country hit, breaking Dolly Parton's record for the most Top Ten country hits for a solo female.

ABA–NBA merger

The ABA–NBA merger was the merger of the American Basketball Association with the National Basketball Association, which after multiple attempts over several years finally occurred in 1976.
Early attempts at merger.
From the very beginning, the ABA hoped to force a merger with the NBA, thus repeating the American Football League's successful effort to force a merger with the National Football League. According to "The NBA Encyclopedia," the ABA's main selling point was that a potential owner could get an ABA team for half of what it cost to get an NBA expansion team at the time. ABA officials told prospective owners that if they held out until the merger, their investment would more than double.
In June 1970, only three years after the ABA began play, the NBA owners voted 13-4 to work toward a merger with the ABA. Seattle SuperSonics owner Sam Schulman, a member of the ABA–NBA merger committee in 1970, was so ardently eager to merge the leagues that he publicly announced that if the NBA did not accept the merger agreement worked out with the ABA, he would move the SuperSonics from the NBA to the ABA. Schulman also threatened to move his soon-to-be ABA team to Los Angeles to compete directly with the Lakers. The owners of the Dallas Chaparrals (now the NBA's San Antonio Spurs) were so confident of the impending merger that they suggested that the ABA hold off on scheduling and playing a regular season schedule for the 1971-72 season. After the 1970-71 season Basketball Weekly wrote "The American basketball public is clamoring for a merger. So are the NBA and ABA owners, the two commissioners, and every college coach. The war is over. The Armistice will be signed soon." The two leagues continued merger discussions and plans through the early and mid-1970s.
The Oscar Robertson lawsuit.
The early attempts at merging the ABA and NBA were delayed for years by litigation known as the Oscar Robertson suit, styled "Robertson v. National Basketball Association", 556 F.2d 682 (2d Cir. 1977). After the NBA owners voted in 1970 to merge with the ABA, the NBA Players Association filed a lawsuit in April 1970 to prevent the merger on antitrust grounds. The existence of the ABA resulted in increased salaries for players in both leagues as the ABA and NBA competed with each other to sign players. The Robertson suit was finally settled on February 3, 1976, but for the entirety of its pendency it presented an insurmountable obstacle to the desired merger of the two leagues.
Congressional action to allow the merger.
In 1972, Congress came close to enacting legislation to enable a merger despite the Oscar Robertson suit. In September 1972 a merger bill was reported favorably out of a United States Senate committee. But the bill was put together to please the owners and ended up not pleasing the Senators or the players. The bill subsequently died without coming to a floor vote. When Congress reconvened in 1973 another merger bill was presented to the Senate, but did not advance. As a result of the legislation's failure the ABA installed a new commissioner, Mike Storen, with part of his focus being the eventual merger of the two leagues as equals. Alex Hannum, who coached in both the NBA and ABA, said at the time of Storen, "The most important problem he has is still the merger with the NBA. And I believe his approach is just right for us. Storen wants to build our league to be the strongest. Then he can negotiate with the NBA as an equal." Sports Illustrated noted at the time that "the tactics Storen says the ABA will employ sound a good deal more like those used by AFL Commissioner Al Davis in the last days of the football war than a plan for peaceful coexistence. The ABA has reinstituted its $300 million antitrust suit against the NBA. It also may move some franchises into better TV markets, an ill-advised maneuver that will mean going against established NBA teams on their home turf. And for the first time since 1970 the ABA will go after established NBA players. 'We will have exploratory contract talks with lots of their men,' Storen says. 'Whether we'll sign none, six or 10 of them will depend on how things work out. But you can be sure of one thing: we'll do this in a serious, orderly way.'" As a result of the merger legislation not being enacted and the Oscar Robertson suit continuing, the two leagues did not merge until 1976, after the Oscar Robertson suit had finally been settled.
Interleague competition in anticipation of merger.
In the summer before the 1971-72 season the ABA and NBA met in an interleague All Star Game. The NBA won a close game, 125-120. In that same preseason, ABA and NBA teams began playing exhibition games against each other. The first such exhibition was played on September 21, 1971 with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and the Milwaukee Bucks barely defeating the Dallas Chaparrals, 106-103. Gradually, the ABA began to prove itself superior, going 15-10 against the NBA in 1973, 16-7 in 1974, and 31-17 in 1975. Overall, the ABA won more of these interleague games than the NBA did, and in every matchup of reigning champions from the two leagues, the ABA champion won, including in the final pre-merger season when the Kentucky Colonels defeated the Golden State Warriors. Boston Globe sportswriter Bob Ryan said of the ABA-NBA exhibition games: "When those exhibition games began, the view in the NBA was, 'Now we'll show those guys.' But then you know what happened - the ABA teams won nearly as often as the NBA did ... Those NBA-ABA games were intense." Longtime NBA coach Larry Brown said of the ABA vs. NBA games, "When some exhibition games were arranged in the 1970s to make some money and we (the ABA) beat them, the NBA said they weren't up for the games. Come on. When I coached Carolina, we played the Knicks after they won a championship. I looked at their guys shooting around and I looked at my guys and I didn't want my players to take off their warm-ups because they looked so scrawny next to the Knicks - and we went out and beat New York. We also played the Celtics a couple of times and beat them. (Celtics coach) Tommy Heinsohn would say that we were playing to win and they weren't, but I'd check the box score and see that Tommy played his regulars 35 to 40 minutes, so what does that tell you?"
Interest in ABA vs. NBA play extended beyond the two leagues' management. In 1976, CBS sought to establish a postseason playoff between the ABA and NBA, and to win the rights to broadcast those games.
ABA's final season.
Denver Nuggets and New York Nets attempt to depart.
Before the 1975-76 season, the Denver Nuggets and New York Nets applied to join the NBA. The owners of the Nets and Nuggets had approached John Y. Brown, Jr. in an attempt to get his Kentucky Colonels to join their attempted leap to the NBA, but Brown refused, saying he was staying loyal to the ABA. Ultimately, the Nets and Nuggets were forced to play a lame-duck season in the ABA by court order.
The Nuggets' and Nets' attempted move to the NBA created a great deal of ill will within the ABA, and brought attention to the emerging financial weakness of some of the league's lesser teams.
Baltimore Claws, San Diego Sails and Utah Stars collapse.
Meanwhile, the ABA saw three of its teams disappear before the end of 1975. The Memphis Sounds moved to Baltimore as the Claws, but were folded after only three preseason games after failing to post a performance bond with the league. On November 12, 1975—three weeks into the season—the San Diego Sails folded. The Sails had been plagued by wretched attendance, and their owner had learned the team would most likely be excluded from any upcoming ABA–NBA merger because Los Angeles Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke didn't want competition in Southern California for either his team or their television coverage on the cable television system he owned. The Sails' players were put into a special dispersal draft.
Virginia Squires struggle.
Another ABA team, the Virginia Squires, struggled mightily in its final two years. Blessed with remarkable talent in previous years, the Squires had sold fan favorites such as Julius Erving, Rick Barry, George Gervin, Warren Armstrong, Billy Paultz and Swen Nater because of constant financial problems. In the 1974-75 season, the once-successful Squires posted a league's-worst record of 15-69. In the 1975-76 season the Squires tied their own record, posting the identical league's-worst won-loss record. Moreover, due to dwindling attendance, the Squires were fighting just to survive until the end of the season. On several occasions, the Squires barely made payroll.
By the end of the 1975-76 season, the Squires were completely out of financial resources. Although it had been apparent even before then that they would not be part of any merger, they were folded by the league on May 11, 1976 after failing to pay a $75,000 league assessment.
The Final Six.
After the Squires folded, the Kentucky Colonels, led by Artis Gilmore, defeated the Indiana Pacers in the first round of the 1976 ABA Playoffs. The Colonels, in turn, lost a seven-game semifinal series to the Denver Nuggets, led by Dan Issel and David Thompson. The Nuggets, in turn, lost the ABA Finals to the New York Nets with Julius Erving, who had defeated George Gervin and the San Antonio Spurs to get there. The Spirits of St. Louis and their star Moses Malone had survived the regular season but missed the playoffs. All six teams were still standing as the ABA and NBA, with the Oscar Robertson suit settled, commenced their final merger negotiations. The merger was finally consummated on June 17, 1976, at the NBA league meetings in the Cape Cod Room at Dunfey's Hyannis Resort in Hyannis, Massachusetts.
Kentucky Colonels.
The Colonels were one of the strongest franchises throughout the history of the ABA. In addition, the Kentucky Colonels-Indiana Pacers rivalry was the league's fiercest, and in all of professional basketball (NBA included), the Colonels ranked sixth in attendance. In spite of that history, the Colonels' final games came in the 1976 ABA Playoffs as the defending champions bested the Pacers to advance to the semifinals before bowing out to the Nuggets in a tight seven game series. John Y. Brown, Jr., the owner of the Colonels, preceded the 1975-76 season by selling star center Dan Issel for $500,000 to the Baltimore Claws. However, when the money never arrived, Brown sent Issel to the Nuggets. Shortly afterward, he sent defensive standout Teddy McClain to the New York Nets for $150,000. Those transactions, especially the sale of former University of Kentucky star Issel, turned off many of the Colonels' fans. Though it was clear to everyone that the Colonels had the talent and the fan support to join the NBA for the 1976-77 season, in the face of various obstacles, Brown had other plans. The NBA's Chicago Bulls desperately wanted Colonels star Artis Gilmore, whose NBA rights the Bulls owned, so the Bulls fought hard to keep the Colonels out of the merger. 
During the merger negotiations in June 1976, the NBA made it clear that it would accept only four ABA teams, not five. The Nuggets and Nets, clearly the ABA's two strongest teams, were obvious choices. The Spurs had posted impressive attendance numbers since moving from Dallas, and were thus a very attractive choice. With the Bulls letting it be known they would object to the Colonels being part of any merger, the Pacers were the next most viable choice. Brown saw the writing on the wall and decided that it was better to fold the Colonels for cash, instead of continuing to fight.
On June 17, 1976, Brown reached a financial agreement with the remaining teams in the ABA and folded the Colonels for $3 million. In addition to the $3 million that Brown received for agreeing to fold the Colonels and stay out of the ABA–NBA merger, he also sold Gilmore's rights to the Bulls for $1.1 million. 
According to the terms of the ABA–NBA merger the Kentucky Colonels players were placed into a dispersal draft (along with the players from the Spirits of St. Louis). The Chicago Bulls took Gilmore for $1.1 million. The Portland Trail Blazers took Maurice Lucas for $300,000, the Buffalo Braves took Bird Averitt for $125,000, the Indiana Pacers took Wil Jones for $50,000, the New York Nets took Jan van Breda Kolff for $60,000, and the San Antonio Spurs took Louie Dampier for $20,000. With the funds he received from the agreement with the other ABA teams and Colonels players sold in the dispersal draft, Brown promptly turned around and bought the NBA's Buffalo Braves for $1.5 million, and parlayed the Braves into ownership of the Boston Celtics. 
Spirits of St. Louis.
Brothers Ozzie and Daniel Silna had made a fortune as pioneers in the manufacture of polyester, and they wanted to own an NBA team. After an attempt to purchase the Detroit Pistons fell short, the Silnas purchased the ABA's Carolina Cougars franchise with the expectation of moving it into the NBA with the impending merger of the two leagues. The Silna brothers moved the Cougars to St. Louis, Missouri because it was then the largest city in the United States without a professional basketball team, and they thought this would make their team more likely to join the NBA. In 1974, the Cougars, roster and all, were overhauled and became the ABA's Spirits of St. Louis from 1974 through 1976. The 1974–75 Spirits had upset the reigning ABA champion New York Nets in the 1975 Eastern Division Finals before losing to the eventual champion Kentucky Colonels, but in the 1975–76 season the Spirits' play was uneven and their attendance waned. 
The 1975–76 season had not turned out so well in terms of either attendance or wins on the court. In May 1976, due to attendance problems in St. Louis, the Spirits announced that they were going to move to Salt Lake City, Utah to play as the Utah Rockies when a lease agreement for the Salt Palace was arranged. This followed an attempted merger of the Spirits and the Utah Stars franchise during the 1975–76 season, a merger that, had it occurred, contemplated the team leaving St. Louis for Utah. But the Stars folded before the merger could occur and instead, the Spirits bought the rights to some of the Stars' best players, including Moses Malone. In an effort to be included in the ABA–NBA merger, the Spirits' owners, the Silna brothers, proposed selling the Spirits to a Utah group, buying the Kentucky Colonels franchise, and moving the Colonels to Buffalo to replace the Buffalo Braves, who were then planning to move to the Miami region. (The Buffalo franchise would eventually move to Southern California, first as the San Diego Clippers before moving north to Los Angeles; Salt Lake City and Miami eventually gained NBA franchises, Salt Lake City through the move of New Orleans a few years later, and Miami via expansion in 1988.) The Spirits were not included in the merger, but the Silna brothers nonetheless managed to turn the merger, for them, into one of the greatest deals in the history of professional sports: 
In June 1976, the remaining ABA owners agreed, in return for the Spirits folding, to pay the St. Louis owners $2.2 million in cash up front in addition to a 1/7 share of the four remaining teams' television revenues "in perpetuity". As the NBA's popularity exploded in the 1980s and 1990s, the league's television rights were sold to CBS and then NBC, and additional deals were struck with the TNT and TBS cable networks; league television revenue soared into the hundreds of millions of dollars. The Silnas continue to receive checks from the NBA on a yearly basis, representing a 4/7 share of the television money that would normally go to any NBA franchise, or about two percent of the entire league's TV deal. 
Thanks to their deal during the ABA–NBA merger, the Silnas received millions of dollars through the 1980s, and at least $4.4 million per year through the 1990s. From 1999 through 2002 the deal netted the Spirits' owners at least $12.53 million per year; from 2003–2006 their take was at least $15.6 million per year. The two Silna brothers each get 45% of that television revenue per year and their attorney during the merger negotiations, Donald Schupak, receives 10%. They credit their terrific deal to careful planning: the Silnas had expected the Spirits and Colonels to enter the NBA but for the ailing Virginia Squires to be left out, and the Silnas thought up the television revenue deal as a way to treat the Squires' owners fairly if the Squires did not join the NBA with the other ABA teams. As of 2012, the Silna brothers have received over $255 million in NBA television revenue. despite the fact that the Spirits never played an NBA game. It is unknown, should St. Louis regain an NBA franchise (as was considered in the 1990's and early 2000's), what would happen to the settlement.
The terms of the ABA–NBA merger included the Spirits of St. Louis players being put into a special dispersal draft along with the Kentucky Colonels players. Marvin Barnes went to the Detroit Pistons for $500,000, Moses Malone went to the Portland Trail Blazers for $300,000, Ron Boone went to the Kansas City Kings for $250,000, Randy Denton went to the New York Knicks for $50,000 and Mike Barr went to the Kansas City Kings for $15,000.
The folding of the Spirits dissolved a very talented basketball team, one that likely would have competed successfully in the NBA. Twelve players from the final two Spirits of St. Louis rosters (1974–76) played in the NBA during the 1976–77 season and beyond: Maurice Lucas, Ron Boone, Marvin Barnes, Caldwell Jones, Lonnie Shelton, Steve Green, Gus Gerard, Moses Malone, Don Adams, Don Chaney, M. L. Carr and Freddie Lewis.
Merger terms for the Denver Nuggets, Indiana Pacers, New York Nets and San Antonio Spurs.
The NBA imposed the following terms on the four ABA refugees:
The indemnities and other penalties were as draconian as the penalties that the AFL teams faced as a consequence of the AFL–NFL merger in 1970.
In addition, the NBA would not recognize ABA records.
The Nets offered their superstar forward Julius Erving to the Knicks in return for waiving the $4.8 million territorial penalty fee, but the Knicks declined the offer. Instead, Erving was sold to the Philadelphia 76ers for $3 million. In effect, the Nets traded their franchise player for a berth in the NBA.
Immediate results of the ABA–NBA merger.
In the first NBA All Star Game after the merger, 10 of the 24 NBA All Stars were former ABA players. 
In the first post-merger season's NBA Finals between the Portland Trail Blazers and the Philadelphia 76ers, five of the ten starting players were former ABA players. (Those five starters from the ABA were Julius Erving, Caldwell Jones, George McGinnis, Dave Twardzik and Maurice Lucas).
Of the 84 players in the ABA at the time of the merger, 63 played in the NBA during the 1976–77 season. In that first post-merger season, four of the NBA's top ten scorers had come over from the ABA (Billy Knight, David Thompson, Dan Issel and George Gervin). 
Don Buse, who joined the NBA with the Pacers, led the NBA in both steals and assists during that first post-merger season. The Spirits of St. Louis' Moses Malone finished third in rebounding; the Kentucky Colonels' Artis Gilmore was fourth. Gilmore and his former Colonels teammate Caldwell Jones were both among the top five in the NBA in blocked shots.
Tom Nissalke left the ABA to coach the NBA's Houston Rockets in the first post-merger season and won the Midwest Division; Nissalke was named NBA Coach of the Year. Former Kentucky Colonels coach Hubie Brown took over the NBA's Atlanta Hawks, and the four former ABA teams kept their coaches as they entered the NBA.
Denver Nuggets.
In 1974, Denver changed its name from the Denver Rockets to the Denver Nuggets in anticipation of the ABA–NBA merger, because the NBA already had a team called the Houston Rockets.
In their first NBA season, the Nuggets – a team that had never won an ABA championship – finished with the league's second-best record, 50–32, and won the Midwest Division. In their second NBA season, the Nuggets repeated as Midwest Division champions, and in their third season the Nuggets missed a third consecutive division title by a single game. Although the financial and draft penalties caused the team to slip a little bit after coach Larry Brown's departure, the Nuggets would remain an NBA power throughout the 1980s.
San Antonio Spurs.
The Spurs, who could never get past the first round of the ABA playoffs before the merger, won NBA division titles in five of their first six NBA seasons. This was in spite of the financial and draft penalties imposed on the team. The Spurs then went through a period of decline in the late 1980s, but rebounded in the 1990s, and in 1999 became the first former ABA team to win an NBA championship. They have since won three more NBA titles, in 2003, 2005 and 2007. In 2003, the NBA Finals matched two former ABA teams, the Spurs and the New Jersey Nets.
Indiana Pacers.
After years of being the ABA's strongest team on the floor and in attendance, the merger caught the Pacers at an awkward moment financially. Indeed, they were in worse financial shape than the Kentucky Colonels, who did not join the NBA. The team had started unloading their stars during the last ABA season. After their first NBA season, the Pacers resorted to broadcasting a successful telethon in order to survive financially into their second NBA season. In part thanks to the telethon, the Pacers' average attendance jumped from 7,615 during the 1976–77 season, their first in the NBA, to 10,982 during the 1977–78 season. 
The Pacers finished their inaugural NBA season with a record of 36–46. Pacers Billy Knight and Don Buse represented Indiana in the NBA All-Star Game. However, this was one of the few bright spots of the Pacers' first 13 years in the NBA. During this time, they had only three non-losing seasons and only two playoff appearances. Finally overcoming the draft and financial penalties imposed in the merger, the Pacers won NBA Central division championships in 1995, 1999, 2000, 2004, and 2013. They reached the NBA Finals in 2000, and reached the Eastern Conference finals the previous two years and again in 2013.
New York Nets.
The Nets, severely handicapped by the financial penalties placed upon the team, sold Julius Erving to the Philadelphia 76ers. Nate Archibald, the one bright spot left on the roster, broke his foot and the Nets finished their first NBA season at 22–60, the worst record in the league. After that first NBA season, the Nets moved to New Jersey and had a few more weak seasons there before finally improving in the early 1980s as they overcame the financial penalties imposed during the merger. By 1984, the Nets were making the NBA playoffs and by 2002 the Nets finally made the NBA Finals, losing to the Los Angeles Lakers. They made it to the NBA Finals again in 2003, this time losing to the San Antonio Spurs, another former ABA team. In 2012, the Nets moved to Brooklyn.
Nets' owner Roy Boe said of the merger, "The merger agreement killed the Nets as an NBA franchise. ...The merger agreement got us into the NBA, but it forced me to destroy the team by selling Erving to pay the bill."
ABA Dispersal Draft, 1976.
The rosters of the Kentucky Colonels and Spirits of St. Louis were put into a special dispersal draft in 1976.
ABA contributions to NBA play.
3-point field goal.
The three-point field goal was used in the ABA; the NBA originally disparaged it, but eventually adopted it.
Angelo Drossos, owner of the San Antonio Spurs: "When the leagues merged, the NBA moguls didn't want the 3-point shot. Red Auerbach hated it and said the Celtics would never go along with it. He had everybody up in arms against the play. Of course, a few years later Red drafted Larry Bird and suddenly he was all for it. And suddenly one of the bigger attractions at the All-Star Game is the 3-point shootout."
Slam Dunk Contest.
The ABA originated the idea of the slam dunk contest at the 1976 ABA All Star Game; the NBA subsequently adopted it. The slam dunk contest has ever since been a major part of the NBA's All Star Weekend (with the exception of 1998 and 1999).
Pressing and trapping defenses.
Pressing and trapping defenses, not used in the slower-tempo NBA, were common in the ABA, and after the merger began to play a larger role in the NBA. 
Billy Cunningham, Philadelphia 76ers star: "When the Knicks were pressing and shooting 3-pointers and all of that under Rick Pitino, people acted as if that was something new. Hey, half the teams in the ABA played like that."
Hubie Brown, former head coach of the Kentucky Colonels, Atlanta Hawks, New York Knicks and Memphis Grizzlies: "We (the ABA) were ahead of the NBA in so many different ways. We had the 3-point play. The NBA said it was a gimmick; now it's one of the most exciting parts of the pro game . . . . About everything we did in the ABA they do now in the NBA except they didn't take our red, white and blue ball."
Faster pace of play.
The ABA had a far faster pace than the NBA, and this carried over into the NBA after the merger; today's NBA game is largely derived from the ABA. Longtime Denver Nuggets head coach and ABA alum Doug Moe, who also coached the Philadelphia 76ers, has commented, "The NBA now plays our (the ABA's) kind of basketball."
Drafting of underclassmen.
Prior to the ABA, the NBA did not allow college underclassmen to enter the league. In 1969 the ABA's Denver Rockets signed Spencer Haywood, a sophomore star at the University of Detroit who had played on the 1968 United States Olympic basketball team. The NCAA sued, but Haywood and the ABA prevailed. Julius Erving and George Gervin also joined the ABA's Virginia Squires as underclassmen, as did Jim Chones going from Marquette University to the New York Nets, George McGinnis from Indiana University to the Indiana Pacers and Ralph Simpson from Michigan State to the Denver Rockets. Moses Malone joined the ABA's Utah Stars straight out of high school. Eventually after the merger the NBA followed suit and the drafting of college underclassmen became common in that league and high school players were also selected in subsequent NBA drafts.

Charles Howard Johnson (1868 - July 3, 1896) was a nineteenth-century American illustrator and newspaper artist. He is best known for his sparse illustrations of the 1890 U.S. edition of The princess by the English poet Alfred Lord Tennyson.
Very little is known of Johnson's life. He was reportedly born in Kansas City, and came to New York in about 1889 after studying art for a year in Cincinnati, Ohio. He worked for a number of magazines including Life, Truth, Munsey's Magazine, and on some of the daily newspapers. He illustrated over ten books. 
He was particularly effective in decorative work, often making the pictures fantastical.
He was engaged to be married to the actress Elita Proctor Otis, before he died at his apartment in the Union Square Hotel of brain fever on July 3 1896, after an illness of ten days. His wife had died two years earlier, with whom he had a daughter

Peale, Pennsylvania is a ghost town located in Cooper Township, Clearfield County, Pennsylvania. It was founded in 1883 and was named after S.R. Peale of Lock Haven.
An excerpt from "The Raftman's Journal", published on August 20, 1885, describes more in-depth what the town was like: 
The site of the Oakwood Cemetery is one of the few distinguishable sites left in what was once a thriving coal mining town -- and "distinguishable" is a very loose term. The cemetery only has one marked grave remaining, belonging to Martha Renfrew, aged 14yrs, 11mos at the time of her death.

<doc id="20222878" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20222878" title="Buru babirusa">
Buru babirusa

The Buru babirusa (Babyrousa babyrussa), also known as the Moluccan babirusa, golden babirusa or hairy babirusa, is a wild pig-like animal native to the island of Buru and the two Sula Islands of Mangole and Taliabu, all belonging to Indonesia. Traditionally, this relatively small species included the other babirusas as subspecies, but it has been recommended treating them as separate species based on differences in their morphology. As also suggested by its alternative common names, the Buru Babirusa has relatively long thick, gold-brown body-hair – a feature not shared by the other extant babirusas.
In absence of detailed data on "B. babyrussa", it is generally assumed that its habitat and ecology are similar to that of "B. celebensis" (north Sulawesi babirusa). Furthermore, as all babirusas were considered conspecific under the scientific name "B. babyrussa" until 2001, data collected before that is consistently listed under the name "B. babyrussa", though the vast majority actually refers to "B. celebensis" (by far the best known species of babirusa). Babyrusas tend to occupy tropical rainforests, river banks and various natural ponds rich in water plants. They are omnivorous and feed on various leaves, roots, fruits, invertebrates and small vertebrates. Their jaws and teeth are strong enough to crack any kind of nuts. Babirusas lack the rostral bone in their nose, which is a tool used by other wild pigs for digging. Therefore, they prefer feeding on roots in soft muddy or sandy soils. Cannibalism was reported among babirusas, feeding on the young of their own or other mammals. North Sulawesi babirusas form groups with up to a dozen of individuals, especially when raising the young. Older males might live individually.
The north Sulawesi babirusa reach sexual maturity when they are 5–10 months old. Their estrous cycle is 28–42 days, and the gestation period lasts 150–157 days. The females have two rows of tits and thus bring 1–2 piglets weighing 380–1050 grams and measuring 15–20 cm, and milk them until the age of 6–8 months. The lifespan is about 24 years.
The restricted habitat of the Buru babirusa, with the total area within 20,000 km², and its gradual loss due to logging persuaded the International Union for Conservation of Nature to declare the species as vulnerable. Hunting by the local population is another cause of concern. Whereas it is unpopular among Muslim communities for religious reasons, it is widely hunted by the indigenous people of Buru, which are predominantly Christian. The meat of Buru babirusa has low fat (only 1.27% compared to 5–15% for domestic pigs) and is regarded as a delicacy. It is also preferred by the locals to the meat of other wild pigs or deer in terms of texture and flavor. The establishment of two protected areas on Buru, Gunung Kapalat Mada (1,380 km²) and Waeapo (50 km²), partly aim at preserving the habitat of the Buru babirusa. This species also enjoys full protection under Indonesian law since 1931.

Safia Shah

Safia Shah (, ), now Safia Thomas (born 16 November 1966 in London) is a British writer, editor and television news producer, following in the footsteps of her distinguished Anglo-Afghan Indian family.
She and her husband Ian also founded and ran a respected traditional delicatessen "A. Gold" in London, specializing in entirely British fare, painstakingly renovating the historic building in the process. They ran this business for several years before moving to live close to Casablanca in Morocco.
Early life and work.
Safia Nafisa Shah is the daughter of the well-known author and teacher in the Sufi mystical tradition, Idries Shah; the twin sister of writer, journalist and documentary maker, Tahir Shah, and the younger sister of the writer, reporter and documentary filmmaker, Saira Shah. Her mother is of Indian Parsi ethnicity.
Educated at Bryanston School in Dorset, England, Shah went on to study at the Sorbonne and University of Grenoble in France. She has worked for the London-based Institute for Cultural Research as a research assistant and editor and worked with Afghan refugees in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan, as well as reporting on social issues there. She is also a freelance writer and has edited for the Institute of Health Sciences.
Safia Shah's sister, Saira Shah, worked with Safia's future husband, Ian Thomas, and the couple met through her and eventually married at Marylebone Road register office in London. Safia Shah and Ian Thomas have both worked for the American news agency, Associated Press Television, as journalists and producers.
"A. Gold".
Safia Shah (now Safia Thomas) and her husband Ian Thomas left the world of television journalism in April 2000 to found and run the traditional delicatessen and grocer "A. Gold" selling traditional British fare, in Brushfield Street, opposite Spitalfields Market, not far from Brick Lane, famous for its curries, in London E1. Selling the likes of Banbury cakes, Campbell's Perfect Tea and elderflower wine, it was their desire to prove that British food was something we should be proud of. The business has received local, specialist and national press coverage.
According to London food writer and critic Sejal Sukhadwala, the shop is located inside what used to be Henry VIII's artillery ground, where soldiers once practised archery and musketry, and is close to Nicholas Hawksmoor's impressive 18th-century Christ Church, Spitalfields. The area is infamous for Jack the Ripper's serial murders, and the Great Fire of London.
Built in 1780, the four-storey Grade II-listed house has been home in the past to diamond-cutters, furriers, boot makers, drapers and by an Amelia Gold, a Hungarian who ran a French millinery (hat making) business. Her 1880's shop sign is still emblazoned across the frontage and Safia and Ian Thomas have kept the name and painstakingly restored the historic building. As a result, "A. Gold" is handsome and old-fashioned looking, while keeping the modern efficiencies of a deli.
"A. Gold", which is described as "the village shop in the heart of London", has a lengthy feature in 'The Good Old Days' section of Jane Payton's book, "Fabulous Food Shops" (2006). The shop was among "The Independent"'s "50 Best Food Shops" with Lulu Grimes, food director of "olive" magazine and "Good Food" magazine recommending its sausages, cheeses, sweets and Somerset brandy.
In an article picturing Safia Thomas standing outside her shop, and written a few months prior to the Economic crisis of 2008, the London "Evening Standard" stated that it was championing the capital's independent shops. With the world increasingly dominated by vast supermarkets and chain stores, London had lost over 7,000 individual or family-owned shops between 2002 and 2008 and small businesses were struggling to survive.
Later life and work in Morocco.
Later leaving London, Safia Shah, her husband Ian Thomas, and their two children emigrated to Morocco to live close to Casablanca, where Safia's brother, the author Tahir Shah already lived. Shah currently divides her time between Morocco and England, where she and her family live on a Dutch grain barge in Surrey.
Works.
Books.
Safia Shah's most notable work is "Afghan Caravan", a miscellany which was collected by Idries Shah and edited by her. In his Introduction to the book, Idries Shah writes:
Shah's latest work, "Carnaby Street's Great Uninvited", a children's book, was released on 23 October 2013. It is a children's picture book and was illustrated by Mark Reeve, known for his work on Spitting Image. The book features what Shah calls "endangered words," or words that used to be commonly used in the English language but which have slipped from regular use. Along with the Carnaby Street book, Shah created a series of ebooks that focus on numerous endangered words. These books include: "As Clear As Mud Volumes 1 and 2: The Brabbler's Guide to Idioms", and "A is For Anonymuncle: The Brabbler's Endangered ABC."
Short stories.
‘Brown Bag’ is a short story included in the "Bristol Short Story Prize Anthology 4", and has been regarded as "A short and sharp and very English story from Casablanca-based Safia Shah, that captures something of the zeitgeist of our modern, Internet-focused age. The storytelling is adequate throughout, but the real triumph comes right at the end, where it’s sudden and completely unexpected." It describes the main character's reflections on her mother’s passing, as well as on incidental memories from the past. The 20 stories collected in the "Bristol Short Story Prize Anthology 4" were selected from more than 2,000 entries for the 2011 Bristol Short Story Prize.
In November 2013, she released "Twice Sifted", a collection of six short stories, which focus on stress-induced anxiety and the many ways in which it is manifested in the characters' lives. "Twice Sifted" is the first of three volumes of short stories to be released by Shah.
The Knitted Taxi.
Safia felt that something out of the ordinary had to be done in order to launch her first picture book, Carnaby Street's Great Uninvited. This is how the Knitted Taxi came to life, thanks to the communal efforts and love for knitting which were offered by the Materialistics. Using her own London cab, this group of dexterous knitters created the designed which covered the taxi using themes taken from her Carnaby Street's Great Uninvited. Now, the Knitted Taxi is proudly wearing the Blue Peter Badge won by its owner Safia when she visited the Blue Peter show at the BBC on the 27th of February. .
Endangered Words.
Safia Shah is a lover of the English language, and a champion of nearly forgotten words. This passion was shared at the Blue Peter show for the BBC winning the famous Blue Peter Badge. 
Reception.
"Afghan Caravan" was chosen by Nobel prize-winning writer Doris Lessing as the "Daily Telegraph" "Book of the Year" where it was described as "a cornucopia a mix of magical tales, nuggets from history... an Aladdin's cave of a book" and in "Literary Review" as "a great deal of fascinating material... It is a book to be dipped into, excellent bedside reading."
Talking about both "Afghan Caravan" and Tahir Shah's "The Middle East Bedside Book", Lessing writes in "The Sufis and Idries Shah": "Both are full of delights; there is a great deal that is surprising; and, as with all books from that source, we are reminded of a generosity and largeness of mind in a culture that once, long ago, gave us the concept of chivalry."

Donnington Brewery

The Donnington Brewery is a small brewery in the village of Donnington near Stow-on-the-Wold in Gloucestershire, England.
There are ten workers at the brewery and with the help of one lorry and a van they deliver 2,000 gallons of beer a week throughout the winter, rising to 3,500 in the summer. This includes three bottled beers – Light, Brown and Double D – that are non-pasteurised and sit working in the bottle for up to five weeks.
Thomas Arkell began brewing at this site in 1865. The brewery was later run by a descendant, Claude Arkell, until his death in 2007 when it passed to Claude's cousins, Peter and James from Arkell's Brewery. 
Donnington Brewery brews two draught beers, SBA and BB, having stopped making its Mild XXX a couple of years ago. These are sold through its 15 tied pubs around the Cotswolds.
There were two more tied pubs. The Merry Mouth is still trading but no longer owned by Donnington. The Bell at Winchcombe was sold by its last landlord and the site converted into a number of houses.
A "Donnington run" means visiting all 15 pubs in a single evening. A path called the Donnington Way connects all the 15 pubs.

Panayiotis Kalorkoti (born 11 April 1957, Cyprus) is a contemporary British artist. As well as painting in acrylics and watercolour he does drawings and also experimented with etchings, screenprints, lithographs and Monotypes. He tends to produce a series of paintings for a specific exhibition. He works within specific terms of reference and his work has been described as an entirely modern iconography. His work is figurative and features bright colour, economic use of line and makes use of collage, whilst referring to conceptualism, abstraction and modernism. Most of the work tends to be in groups and it is in the serial works that the viewer will sense a certain questioning and re-focusing. Of his artistic approach, Andrew Lambirth wrote:

Munsey's Magazine

"Munsey's Weekly, later known as Munsey's Magazine", was a thirty-six page quarto American magazine founded by Frank A. Munsey in 1889. Munsey aimed at "a magazine of the people and for the people, with pictures and art and good cheer and human interest throughout". John Kendrick Bangs was the editor. The magazine was soon selling 40,000 copies a week. In 1891, Munsey moved to monthly publication and it was renamed "Munsey's Magazine". It is credited with being the first mass-market magazine.
In October 1893, Munsey reduced the price of the magazine from 25 cents to 10 cents, which was greatly successful. By 1895, the magazine had a circulation of 500,000 a month. It included numerous illustrations (including many by the illustrator Charles Howard Johnson) and was attacked for its "half-dressed women and undressed statuary". Some outlets refused to stock the magazine as a result, but circulation continued to grow and by 1897 had reached 700,000 per month. 
The circulation of the magazine began to fall in 1906, and by the 1920s was down to 60,000. In October 1929, it was merged with "Argosy" and immediately demerged with "Argosy All-Story" to form "All-Story", which continued on a monthly schedule under a variety of similar titles until May 1955.
Contributors.
Charles M. Relyea was among the illustrators whose work appeared in "Munsey's".
Tod Robbins had his short story "Spurs" published in 1923. It was loosely adapted into the film "Freaks" (1932).
Mazo de la Roche, the author of the popular Jalna series, had her first story published in 1902 in "Munsey's Magazine".
Robert William Service published the poem "Unforgotten" (also called "Apart and yet Together") in the December 1903.

INCITE

The program promotes research that can only be conducted on state-of-the-art supercomputers. Researchers come from universities and private industry as well as from DOE national laboratories and other government research institutions and include climate scientists, fusion scientists, nuclear physicists, materials scientists, and computational biologists, to name a few.
Resources.
The resources at Argonne National Laboratory are an IBM Blue Gene/P system nicknamed Intrepid and Surveyor, a BG/P system. Intrepid possess a peak speed of 557 teraflops and a Linpack speed of 450 teraflops, one of the fastest supercomputers in the world. Intrepid’s configuration features 40,960 nodes, each with four processors or cores for a total of 163,840 cores and 80 terabytes of memory. Surveyor has 1,024 quad-core nodes (4,096 processors) and 2 terabytes of memory and is used for tool and application porting, software testing and optimization, and systems software development.
Oak Ridge National Laboratory boasts Jaguar, the fastest computer in the world for open science and the second fastest in the world overall. With a peak speed of 1.6 petaflops, Jaguar is the world’s first petaflop system dedicated to open research. The Cray XT system utilizes over 45,000 of the latest quad-core Opteron processors from AMD and features 362 terabytes of memory and a 10-petabyte file system. The system has 578 terabytes per second of memory bandwidth and an unprecedented input/output (I/O) bandwidth of 284 gigabytes per second to tackle the biggest bottleneck in leading-edge systems—moving data into and out of processors.
History.
Since 1974, DOE’s Office of Science, the single nation’s largest supporter of basic research in the physical sciences, has provided supercomputing resources for unclassified research through the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. During the first two years of the INCITE program, 10 percent of the resources at NERSC were allocated to INCITE awardees. However, demand for supercomputing resources far exceeded available systems and in 2003, the Office of Science identified increasing computing capability by a factor of 100 as the second priority on its Facilities of the Future list. As a result of a peer-reviewed competition, the first Leadership Computing facility was established at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 2004. A second Leadership Computing facility was established at Argonne National Laboratory in 2006. This expansion of computational resources led to a corresponding expansion of the INCITE program. In 2010, The Leadership Computing Facilities at Argonne and Oak Ridge National Laboratories will provide over one billion processor hours to the INCITE program.

Megacheira ("Great Hands") is an extinct class of predatory euarthropods that possessed a pair of short enlarged appendages (the source of the class' name). They strongly resemble early chelicerates. Most of them were found in marine environments throughout the world from the lower to middle Cambrian; however, the group also contains one species ("Enalikter aphson") described from the Silurian Herefordshire Lagerstätte of the United Kingdom, and one species ("Bundenbachiellus giganteus") known from the Early Devonian of Germany. They were important components of several faunas, including the Burgess, Wheeler and Maotianshan Shales lagerstattens. Genera referred to the class include "Leanchoilia", "Alalcomenaeus" and "Yohoia", "Fortiforceps" and "Jianfengia".

Xavier Austin

Xavier Austin is a fictional character from the Australian Channel Seven soap opera "Home and Away", played by David Jones-Roberts. The character debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 20 November 2008. Jones-Roberts was cast in the role after previously auditioning for the roles of four other characters. Xavier has been portrayed as a caring character who has had to look after his family. Many of his storylines have been centred around his relationship with Ruby Buckton. Xavier departed on 3 July 2012, but made a brief return from 23-24 April 2013.
Casting.
Auditions were held and actor Jones-Roberts was cast in the role. Jones-Roberts had previously auditioned for the roles of Henry Hunter, Lucas Holden, Drew Curtis and Geoff Campbell and stated that receiving the role of Xavier was "all the more awesome" because he had to wait for such a long time. Whilst surfing his agent told him he had the role over a pay-phone and Jones-Roberts adds: "I got all excited and started jumping around. I ran up to a couple of people I saw that I knew and just started screaming."
Development.
Characterisation.
The serial's official website describe Xavier stating: "Xavier's not your typical teen – he’s had it tougher than most. In fact, he hasn’t really been allowed a proper childhood." Xavier has had to care for his family a lot of the time, of this they state: "The responsibility of ‘man of the house’ fell on Xavier’s shoulders and he has dutifully played that role ever since. He has a deep love and incredible patience with Brendan (Kain O'Keeffe) who is twenty, but with a mental capacity of a four year old." Xavier was seen yearning for a care-free life and started taking recreational drugs and partying, but they add that later he "matured into a caring and thoughtful young man." Jones-Roberts describes Xavier adding: "When we first met Xavier we think he is a bit of a ratbag, but when we get to know him and his family we discover his mucking about has been his release and escape from his family responsibilities." Xavier chooses to join the police force after he leaves school. He feels that joining the force will allow him the opportunity to help other people, something that he has always done himself. 
Relationships.
Xavier starts a romance with Ruby Buckton (Rebecca Breeds), but Ruby is seen having to impress him after Xavier initially shows her little interest. Speaking of Xavier's attitude Breeds states: "He's a challenge, she had to work for him and there is something mysterious and naughty about him but deep down she knows he is loyal and decent." He later starts dating April Scott (Rhiannon Fish), of Fish this states: "I know April would like there to be a little romance between her and Xavier. However, there are a few obstacles she encounters along the way so it's really a question of whether he's going to man up..."
In January 2012, a writer for "TV Week" observed that with sparks already flying between Xavier and Sasha Bezmel (Demi Harman), it looked like they would become "Home and Away's" newest couple over the coming months. When an upset Sasha is taunted by some Summer Bay High students in the Diner, Xavier sticks up for her because he feels it is the right thing to do. "They then create a friendship, but their romance takes a while to develop as Sasha is quite strong-willed." Jones-Roberts stated "When she arrived in the Bay, they were clashing heads nonstop. But Xavier likes that about the girls he's been with - they've all been really fiery and he always finds it a good challenge to try and match them."
Departure.
During the episode broadcast on 3 July 2012, Xavier was seen leaving Summer Bay to live in Goulburn permanently. It was then confirmed that Jones-Roberts had left the cast of "Home and Away". The actor thanked fans for their support, writing "Just wanted to say thanks to all my fans out there for your continued support throughout the years. Truly wouldn't be where I am without you guys."
Following Sonia Todd's departure from "Home and Away" in 2013, Jones-Roberts returned to film funeral scenes for her character and Xavier's mother, Gina.

Pulsing (bodywork)

Pulsing is a rhythmic, movement-based somatic therapy that can be classed as a form of post-Reichian bodywork. It uses a very gentle and nurturing approach to increase body awareness and sensitivity and to connect to the body's natural rhythms.
History.
Pulsing was developed in the late 1970s by Curtis Turchin, a practitioner of Postural Integration (PI). After seeing Dr Milton Trager, founder of the Trager Approach, demonstrate his movement-based bodywork at the Esalen Institute in the mid-1970s Turchin was inspired to develop a systematic approach that he called "Pulsing".
Forms and Practice.
It involves the application of pressure and movement (stretching, lifting, shaking, rotating and swinging) to the soft tissue of the body (skin, muscles, tendons, ligaments and fascia) within a continuous soft rhythmic rocking. The client is encouraged to be "passive" - in the sense of not "trying" to do anything, but allowing the body to relax into the movements. This in itself quickly highlights areas of muscular tension and holding. 
Children and adults will often rock themselves when distressed: there appears to be a deep comfort and security to be found in gentle movement. With its flowing and wave-like movements, Pulsing perhaps recalls a body-memory of the foetal experience in the womb, where the baby is constantly subject to rhythmic pulsation, or of being cradled and rocked during infancy. 
Pulsing can take a number of forms, distinguished by the intent with which it is approached by both client and therapist (for example, relaxing, playful or as deeper emotional therapy). In the 'lighter' modes, clients sometimes experience gentle emotional release and often enter a trance-like state. Sessions usually have a deeply relaxing yet energising effect. Here the benefits may include a release of deep physical tension, an increase in flexibility and movement repertoire, and an improved general sense of well-being and energy. On a deeper level, it can also be performed explicitly as a form of body psychotherapy, encouraging the client to become aware of their emotional responses, patterns of breathing and physical areas where "they feel tense, tight, weak, uncomfortable or painful and aware of protective holding patterns". In this way clients may discover and release deeply embodied emotions. Whichever form is used, many of the effects of Pulsing occur below the level of conscious awareness and continue to resonate in the bodymind for some time after sessions.
Beneficial effects.
Pulsing claims to have wide-ranging benefits for many physical and psychosomatic problems. These include easing muscular tension and joint stiffness, and promoting flexibility, balance and co-ordination. The fluidity of the movement improves circulation, lymphatic flow and digestion, while in seeking to connect people to their natural body rhythms it promotes a rebalancing of the body's homeostatic and self-healing capacity. On an emotional level the rhythm "allays anxiety, enhances pleasure and provides compensatory satisfaction when desires are frustrated". In this it echoes Charles Darwin's observation that "'emotional expression belongs to rhythmical forms".

Stanton Hall, Stanton in Peak

Stanton Hall is a privately owned country house at Stanton in Peak in the Derbyshire Peak District, the home of the Davie-Thornhill family. It is a Grade II* listed building.
The manor of Stanton was owned for some two centuries by the Bache family, but passed to Thornhill by the 1696 marriage of Mary Pegge, heiress of the estate, to John Thornhill of Thornhill. The Thornhill family and their direct descendants are still in residence.
The house has three principal building phases. The oldest part dates from the replacement of the medieval manor house in 1693. Only one single gabled bay at the north of the house now remains of this period. In the 17th century the 1693 house was largely replaced with a two-storey mansion with a seven bayed east front. In 1799/1800 Bache Thornhill, (High Sheriff of Derbyshire in 1776) added a substantial southern facing extension, doubling the size of the house. The new two-storey, five-by-five-bay addition was designed in a Palladian style by architect Lindley of Doncaster. The entrance front to the south has the three central bays projecting, with a semicircular Doric porch with balcony over, and all covered by a pediment.
Bache Thornhill also created a deer park on the estate and ornamental gardens. His descendant William Pole Thornhill, High Sheriff 1836, died in 1876 and the estate passed to McCreagh-Thornhill relations. In the 1950s it passed to the Davie-Thornhill family.

General Muhammad Shariff (22 February 1921 – 6 August 1999) was retired four-star general in the Pakistan Army who was the first Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee since its inception in 1976 till his retirement in 1978. General Muhammad Shariff was the first Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff Committee of the Pakistan Defense Forces who was succeeded by Admiral Mohammad Shariff in 1978.
Early military career.

Shariff then moved to 3 Punjab Regiment.His bravery in kashmir operations was noted and he was rapidly promoted. He became Lieutenant Colonel in 1952 and was promoted to Brigadier-General eight years later in 1959. Then Brigadier-General Shariff took part in the 1960 Dir Operations when the army removed the Nawab of Dir when he was commanding the Shariff Force.
Later career.
As a major general, a rank to which he was promoted in 1966, Gen Shariff served in the GHQ, commanded an infantry division and then became Commandant, Command and Staff College, Quetta in May 1968 continuing till January 1970. In 1970 he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant General and posted as Pakistan's Permanent Representative at CENTO HQ in Ankara, Turkey.

After his retirement he faded from public life, refusing to accept any post in government, living off his pension and savings.
General Shariff wanted to rotate the chairmanship among the three services (i.e., Army, Navy and Air Force) if the system of military governance was to evolve as intended. Because initially, Gen Shariff, being the senior most officer was chosen as the Chairman JCSC with Gen Zia-ul-Haq the Army chief. However, even before the system could evolve itself into a cohesive working structure the July 1977 coup disturbed the power balance totally, and tilted it heavily in favor of the army chief.

Garden of Cosmic Speculation

The Garden of Cosmic Speculation is a 30 acre (12 hectare) sculpture garden created by landscape architect and theorist Charles Jencks at his home, Portrack House, near Dumfries in South West Scotland.
History.
Features.
The garden is inspired by science and mathematics, with sculptures and landscaping on these themes, such as Black Holes and Fractals. The garden is not abundant with plants, but sets mathematical formulae and scientific phenomenae in a setting which elegantly combines natural features and artificial symmetry and curves. It is probably unique among gardens, drawing comparisons with a similarly abstract garden in Scotland, Little Sparta.
Access.
The garden is private but usually opens on one day each year through Scotland's Gardens Scheme and raises money for Maggie's Centres, a cancer care charity named for Maggie Keswick Jencks, the late wife of Charles Jencks.
Depiction in music.
The garden is the subject of an orchestral composition by American composer, Michael Gandolfi, which he composed for a joint commission from the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the Tanglewood Music Center. The piece was subsequently recorded by the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra conducted by Robert Spano, and nominated for "Best Contemporary Classical Composition" at the 2009 Grammy Awards.

Experimental Mine, U.S. Bureau of Mines

Experimental Mine, U.S. Bureau of Mines is a landmark located in the Pittsburgh suburb of Bruceton, Pennsylvania. In 1910, the newly created U.S. Bureau of Mines leased a 38-acre tract of land from the Pittsburgh Coal Company and opened the Experimental Mine.
One of the early findings in the Experimental Mine demonstrated that coal dust by itself was capable of propagating an explosion even in the absence of any methane gas. This demonstration was contrary to the old belief widely held at the time that coal dust could not explode without gas. This view had led to the very dangerous and widespread practice of using loose coal dust in mines to pack explosives in boreholes, which had cost many thousands of lives. These early experiments clearly proved that such a practice was too hazardous to continue.
Current facilities.
By 1999 the complex made the transition to lab and office space as part of the National Energy Technology Laboratory network throughout the United States. The complex is home to three major agencies including the Federal Energy Technology Center (U.S. Department of Energy), the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control), and the Mine Safety & Health Administration (U.S. Department of Labor). Over one thousand government and contractor employees worked at the site by 2000.

The Princess Royal University Hospital or PRUH is a large acute district general hospital situated in Locksbottom, near Farnborough, in the London Borough of Bromley. It was opened on the 1st April 2003 on the site of the former Farnborough Hospital, where it was built to house the services previously provided by Bromley and Farnborough Hospitals. It was initially administered by the Bromley Hospitals NHS Trust, until a merger with Queen Elizabeth Hospital NHS Trust and Queen Mary's Sidcup NHS Trust created the South London Healthcare NHS Trust in April 2009, which took over the running of several other hospitals in the local area. The hospital building was funded partly by the sale of the land occupied by Bromley Hospital, and partly by a private finance initiative.
PRUH is home to the Hyper Acute Stroke Unit for South East London and has a large General Medical patient mix with over 300 medical beds.
2013 Takeover.
The South London Healthcare NHS Trust was dissolved on 1 October 2013, following a decision by the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, acting on advice from the Trust Special Administrator. The accumulated debt owed on both the Princess Royal and Queen Elizabeth hospitals was written off by the Department for Health.
King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust then took over responsibility for the Princess Royal University Hospital, as well as responsibility for running some clinical services at Queen Mary's Hospital, Sidcup, Beckenham Beacon and Sevenoaks Hospital.

Valmagne Abbey

Valmagne Abbey () is a former monastery located near Villeveyrac, Hérault in south-central France and is a designated historic monument under the French listing system. 
Valmagne Abbey was founded as a Benedictine abbey in 1138 but only twenty years later was attached to the Cistercian Order by decree of Pope Hadrian IV, where it remained until the French Revolution when monasteries in France were confiscated by the state and either sold or destroyed. Valmagne escaped demolition and was sold intact to a Monsieur Granier-Joyeuse in 1791 who converted the abbey church into a wine cave for the maturing of wine in large barrels, a function it continues to serve today.
History.
Valmagne Abbey was founded in 1138 by Raymond Trencavel, Vicomte de Béziers, with monks from the Benedictine monastery of Sainte-Marie d'Ardorel near Albi. In 1145 the second abbot, Pierre, requested that the abbey be placed under the authority of the Cistercian movement. Trencavel opposed the request but in 1159 Pope Hadrian IV affirmed the affiliation and the abbey took on the law of Saint Bernard, as a daughter house of Bonnevaux Abbey.
Valmagne then experienced a time of rapid growth as local landowners bestowed both land and money on the monastery. The buildings were extended and a vineyard of was established by the monks. From the twelfth century to the beginning of the fourteenth century, Valmagne was one of the richest monasteries in southern France and at its peak was home to nearly 300 monks. As the monastery expanded the original Romanesque chapel became cramped so in 1257 permission was granted to build a new church. The new church was constructed over the next forty years in the Gothic style and aside from the removal of the stained glass has changed little since completion. 
The Black Death devastated the region in 1348, causing many monks to die and others to flee the abbey. The decline was compounded during the Hundred Years' War when Valmagne suffered attacks and looting by passing mercenaries. As successive abbots were unable to balance the books, many of the abbey's lands and possessions were sold. From 1477 the abbots were appointed from outside the community and this led to a relaxation of the laws of religious life and a decline in the loyalty of the abbot for his abbey. During the French Wars of Religion of the sixteenth century, the abbey was almost abandoned and in 1575, an attack by Huguenots broke all the windows of the church and caused considerable damage to other buildings, particularly the cloister. 
Preservation work was undertaken in the seventeenth century, and parts of the church were sealed to prevent falls. At the same time the cloister was repaired, but the abbey had fallen into debt and lacked the finance to restore the structures properly, hence many windows in the church were bricked up instead of being re-glazed. By the eighteenth century, the community was very small and during the French Revolution the abbey was sacked again and furniture, paintings and archives were burned. In 1790, the last three monks left Valmagne taking the few remaining valuable items and the abbey was confiscated. It was sold in 1791 to Monsieur Granier-Joyeuse who converted the church into a wine cave, installing large barrels in the apse and side chapels of the church. On Granier-Joyeuse's death in 1838 Valmagne was acquired by Count Henri-Amédée-Mercure de Turenne and has remained in the same family ever since.
Buildings.
Abbey church.
The present Gothic church was rebuilt in 1257 on the foundations of a smaller Romanesque chapel to a traditional plan with a nave and transept, and nine radiating chapels off the semi-circular ambulatory. The nave is preceded by a narthex flanked by two defensive towers. The main structure measures long, wide and high.
Cloister.
The groin vaulted cloister of Valmagne surrounds a large garden courtyard, with five large arches on each of the four sides.
The chapter house is on the east side of the cloister and is one of the oldest parts of the abbey. It is unusual in that it has a single-span vaulted roof and therefore does not need the internal columns which are typical of chapter houses in other monasteries.
On the south side of the cloister is an open octagonal structure containing a lavabo fed by a spring. The lavabo is opposite the refectory so that the monks could cleanse their hands before meals.
Vineyard.
The vineyard was originally established by the Cistercian monks in the twelfth century and vines have been continually cultivated on the land ever since. Today, the vineyard covers of which are classified appellation contrôlée. There are two distinct terroirs within the domain; the first, of clay and chalk, contains the AOC classified area and produces mainly white wines, whilst the second, to the north, is red sandstone and marl.

Expulsion from the United States Congress

Expulsion is the most serious form of disciplinary action that can be taken against a Member of Congress. Article I, Section 5 of the United States Constitution provides that "Each House Congress may determine the Rules of its proceedings, punish its members for disorderly behavior, and, with the concurrence of two-thirds, expel a member." The processes for expulsion differ somewhat between the House of Representatives and the Senate. 
Censure, a less severe form of disciplinary action, is an official sanction of a member that does not remove a member from office.
Process leading to expulsion.
Presently, the disciplinary process begins when a resolution to expel or censure a Member is referred to the appropriate committee. In the House, this is the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct (House Ethics Committee); in the Senate, this is the Select Committee on Ethics (Senate Ethics Committee).
The committee may then ask other Representatives or Senators to come forward with complaints about the Member under consideration or may initiate an investigation into the Member's actions. Sometimes Members may refer a resolution calling for an investigation into a particular Member or matter that may lead to the recommendation of expulsion or censure.
Rule XI (Procedures of committees and unfinished business) of the Rules of the House of Representatives state that the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct can investigate allegations that a Member violated "any law, rule, regulation, or other standard of conduct applicable to the conduct of such Member... in the performance of his duties or the discharge of his responsibilities". The Senate Select Committee on Ethics has the same jurisdiction. The committee may then report back to their whole chamber as to its findings and recommendations for further actions.
When an investigation is launched by either committee, an investigatory subcommittee will be formed. Once the investigatory subcommittee has collected evidence, talked to witnesses, and held an adjudicatory hearing it will vote on whether the Member is found to have committed the specific actions and then will vote on recommendations. If expulsion is the recommendation then the subcommittee's report will be referred to the full House of Representatives or Senate where Members may vote to accept, reject, or alter the report's recommendation. Voting to expel requires the concurrence of two-thirds of the members present and voting.
History of expulsions from Congress.
In the entire history of the United States Congress, only 20 Members have been expelled: 15 from the Senate and five from the House of Representatives (of those one member's expulsion, William K. Sebastian of Arkansas, was posthumously reversed). Because the bulk of the expulsions were expulsions of Southern sympathizers during the American Civil War, 19 of the 20 expulsions involved a member of the Democratic Party, with the only exception pre-dating the founding of the modern political parties. Censure has been a much more common form of disciplinary action in Congress over the years, as it requires a much lower threshold of votes to impose.
The great majority of those expelled — 17 members — were removed from office for their support of the Confederacy in the immediate aftermath of secession. In 1861, after the Civil War had broken out, 11 Senators (including former Vice President and Kentucky Senator John C. Breckinridge) and three Representatives were expelled for supporting the Confederacy. In 1862, three more Senators were expelled for supporting the Confederate States (John Bullock Clark and John William Reid of Missouri as well as Henry Cornelius Burnett of Kentucky).
There have only been three other expulsions. In 1797, Senator William Blount of Tennessee was expelled for treason, with charges centering on a plan to incite the Creek and Cherokee to aid the British in conquering the Spanish territory of West Florida. Blount remains the only Senator to be expelled for a reason other than supporting the Confederacy.
In 1980 Representative Michael Myers of Pennsylvania was expelled for bribes in connection with the Abscam scandal. In 2002, Representative Jim Traficant of Ohio was expelled after he was convicted on numerous counts of bribery, racketeering, and tax evasion.

Marshal (Brazil)

Marshal (Portuguese: "Marechal") is the highest rank in both the Brazilian Army and the Brazilian Air Force, although the latter is titled "Marechal-do-Ar" (literally Marshal of the Air). These ranks are equivalent to that of Admiral in the Navy. A marshal is distinguished by using five stars, which for a marshal of the air are in the approximate position of Southern Cross and for a marshal in the army, in the form of "X". The five stars of Admiral are in the shape of a pentagon.
Until the structural reform of 1967 in the Brazilian Army, army generals (bearing four stars), when moving to the reserve, were awarded the fifth star automatically. With the reform, it was established that there would be only the promotion of a general to marshal in the event of war, thus extinguishing the rank of marshal within the army in times of peace. Those dubbed as marshals prior to such reform, however, would still bear such titles for the reminder of their lives. The last living Brazilian Army marshal, Marshal Waldemar Levy Cardoso, died in May 2009.
During the days of the Imperial Period (between 1822 and 1889), the patent, regarding the Army, was named "marshal of the army" (Portuguese: "Marechal-do-Exército"), having been renamed to its shorter current counterpart with the advent of the Republic after 1889.
Although a large number of marshals existed within Brazilian ranks in the second half of the 20th century as mentioned above, the last active marshal in the Brazilian Army (i.e., that to hold office in the command of active troops) was Marshal Mascarenhas de Moraes, holding the position of commander of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force, a special Corps assembled to fight alongside the Allied forces in the Mediterranean Theatre of World War II. Marshal Mascarenhas de Maraes would bear said position and title for the reminder of his life (thus, until 1968, when he perished) as a result of a decree by the National Congress which dubbed the position and title honorary lifetime in the form of active troops.
Some Marshals became President of Brazil, notably in the years following the establishment of the Republic in 1889 and also between the 1964 Brazilian coup d'état and the re-establishment of democracy in 1984/1985. Worthy mentions would be Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca (for the earlier aforementioned period) and Marshals Humberto de Alencar Castello Branco and Artur da Costa e Silva (for the latter).
List of Brazilian Marshals.
This category comprises articles about marshal of the Armed Forces of Brazil (patent virtually extinct in 1967 when, from then, can only be attributed to generals who had participated in conflicts of war). There have been 66 Marshals; 63 army and three air force.
Marshals of the Empire of Brazil.
During the monarchic regime, there were four General ranks (from lowest to highest): Brigadier ("Brigadeiro"), Field Marshal ("Marechal de campo"), Lieutenant-General ("Tenente-general") and Marshal of the Army ("Marechal do Exército"). Although almost all international conflicts that Brazil participated occurred during the Imperial Era (Brazilian War of Independence (1822-1825), Cisplatine War (1825-1828), Platine War (1851-1852), Uruguayan War (1864-1865) and Paraguayan War (1864-1870)), very few military officers achieved the highly distinct rank:

Lazar Hayward

Lazar Miller Hayward (born November 26, 1986) is an American professional basketball player. He was a college standout for Marquette University.
Early years.
High school career.
Hayward went to Buffalo Traditional High School where he was an outstanding basketball player. After graduating from Buffalo Traditional in 2005, Hayward enrolled in Notre Dame Prep School in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, as only the NCAA Division III college SUNY Fredonia expressed any interest in Hayward.
College career.
Hayward attended Notre Dame Prep School in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, and while he attended he played with many other notable players, like Michael Beasley (currently playing for the Phoenix Suns), Syracuse University standout Paul Harris and UTEP player Derrick Caracter. Hayward started both freshman and sophomore seasons. After Notre Dame Preparatory School Hayward attended Marquette University. Lazar always wears a backwards Nike headband matching his uniform. Hayward was named one of the top 25 wings in the nation coming out of high school. At Marquette University, Lazar received the nickname "Money Man". He finished his Marquette career as the program's 2nd all-time leading scorer and 5th all-time in rebounds, as well as garnering 2nd Team All-Big East honors in 2008 and 2010 and Honorable Mention AP All-American status in 2010 while leading Marquette to 4 NCAA Tournament appearances. On April 2, 2010, Hayward was named the Hershey's Player of the Game in the Reese's College All-Star Game.
Professional career.
He was selected by the Washington Wizards with the 30th pick in the 2010 NBA Draft, but his draft rights were traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves shortly after being drafted. In 2011, his college teammate Jimmy Butler was taken with the same pick in the NBA Draft. It was the first time Marquette players went back-to-back in the first round since Bo Ellis was drafted by Washington in 1977 and Butch Lee was taken by Atlanta in 1978.
In his first season in the NBA, he averaged 3.8 points in 10 minutes per game for Timberwolves. On December 13, 2011, before the start of another season, Hayward was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder for two second round draft picks and Robert Vaden.
The Thunder assigned Hayward to the Tulsa 66ers of the D-League on March 2, 2012. The Thunder recalled him on March 4, 2012 after he averaged 28 ppg in 2 games with the Tulsa 66ers. With the Thunder that season, he averaged 1.4 points per game, shooting 34% from the field.
On October 27, 2012, he was traded to the Houston Rockets and subsequently waived.
On December 31, 2012, Hayward re-signed with the Timberwolves. He was waived by the Timberwolves on January 6, 2013, but re-signed two days later on a ten-day contract.
On January 28, 2013, Hayward was re-acquired by the Los Angeles D-Fenders. He was waived by the team on April 4, 2013, due to an injury. 
In September 2013, he signed with the New Orleans Pelicans. He was later waived by the Pelicans on October 13, 2013.

The Táin (Horslips album)

The Táin is a music album by Irish rock band Horslips. Their second studio album, it was Horslip's first attempt at making a concept album, an idea they would return to in 1976 with "The Book of Invasions: A Celtic Symphony". "The Táin" was based on the Táin Bó Cúailnge (The Cattle Raid of Cooley), one of the most infamous legends of Early Irish literature, dealing with the war between Ulster and Connacht over a prize bull. The songs tell the story from the points of view of Cúchulainn, Queen Maeve of Connacht and Ferdia, among others. Horslips continued their Celtic Rock style of fusing traditional Irish music and rock, using traditional jigs and reels and incorporating them into their songs. For example, Dearg Doom is based on "O'Neill's March", while "The March of the King of Laois" forms part of "More Than You Can Chew". 
"The Táin" was released in Ireland in 1973 independently, in the UK by RCA/Oats and by Atco in the US. It was reissued in the UK in 1978 by DJM. 
"Dearg Doom" was arguably the most popular track on the album and was included in Tom Dunne's "30 Best Irish Hits" compilation, released in 2003. Along with "Faster Than The Hound", it was performed by the band on BBC's Old Grey Whistle Test. "Dearg Doom's" main guitar riff was incorporated into "Put 'Em Under Pressure", the anthem of the Republic of Ireland's Italia '90 campaign, reintroducing the song to a younger audience.

Reserves-to-production ratio

The Reserves-to-production ratio (RPR or R/P) is the remaining amount of a non-renewable resource, expressed in time. While applicable to all natural resources, the RPR is most commonly applied to fossil fuels, particularly petroleum and natural gas. The "reserve" portion (numerator) of the ratio is the amount of a resource known to exist in an area and to be economically recoverable (proved reserves). The "production" portion (denominator) of the ratio is the amount of resource used in one year at the current rate.
RPR = (amount of known resource) / (amount used per year)
This ratio is used by companies and government agencies in forecasting the future availability of a resource to determine project life, future income, employment, etc., and to determine whether more exploration must be undertaken to ensure continued supply of the resource. Annual production of a resource can usually be calculated to quite an accurate number. However, reserve quantities can only be estimated to varying degrees of accuracy, depending on the availability of information and on the methods used to evaluate them.
A simplistic interpretation of the ratio has led to many false predictions of immanent "running out of oil" since the early years of the oil industry in the 1800s. This has been especially true in the United States, where the ratio of proved reserves-to-production has been between 8 years and 17 years since 1920. Many have mistakenly interpreted the result as the number of years before the oil supply is exhausted. Such analyses do not take into account future reserve growth.
Significance and interpretation.
[[File:Decline curve analysis software image of exponential decline - hyperbolic decline.jpg|thumb|
Decline curve generated by Decline curve analysis software, used to project future oil and gas production: red line is the gas decline curve; lower Blue line is the oil decline curve.]]
The reserves-to-production ratio is the most widely quoted of the key indicators used in the oil and gas industry. It has a certain strategic significance for companies, which try to keep the value reasonably constant at approximately 10 years. A ratio which falls too low indicates a company in poor health. For a country or region, a value which falls too low can be a warning of impending scarcity. Globally, the RPR for petroleum varies from 8 years in the North Sea to 80 years in the Middle East. The former is typical of a region undergoing a steep production decline, the latter a region which will be continuing to produce oil well into the future.
The reserves-to-production ratio can be misleading to the average person, particularly since it is expressed in years. The fact that a region has a RPR of 40 years does not mean that it will continue to produce the resource for 40 years, at which point it will suddenly run out, and then production will decline to zero. More commonly, a resource will show an increase in production until it reaches a peak, and then production will plateau and enter a declining phase. In theoretical terms, this is more accurately described by the Hubbert curve, a bell-shaped curve which is the mathematical derivative of the logistics function.
The magnitude of the RPR is inversely related to the annual rate of production, which may depend on geological features. For example, a highly fractured oil reserve with water drive may have a RPR as low as 6 years. By contrast, a low permeability oil reserve may have a RPR as high as 50 or 100 years. Government policies may deliberately slow production, thereby increasing the RPR in the interests of prolonging reserve life, whereas a company may inject water and/or gases into a reservoir to increase production, thereby decreasing the RPR—the increased production comes at the expense of decreased reserve life. The RPR depends signiﬁcantly on the stage of resource development. Typically, there is a high initial RPR during the early phases of development, then the RPR sharply declines toward the maximum level of production. Following to the production decline, the magnitude of the P/R ratio can either continue to decline, remain stable for some period of time, or increase, especially when a production slump occurs.
New discoveries, changes in technology, or changes in economic conditions, can significantly alter the ratio in a short period of time, while misevaluation by involved parties can produce inaccurate and/or misleading results. Optimism or pessimism can influence reserve estimates. Further, reserves are resources that are "economically" recoverable under "existing conditions". Reserves may change as a result of political change, or by manipulation.
Consumption of many resources is not constant, but typically increases as the population grows and becomes more prosperous. Non-constant values for both the numerator and denominator of the ratio implies it may either overestimate or underestimate the remaining life of the resource.
Fossil fuel reserve-to-production ratios.
Reserve-to-production ratios may be calculated for individual countries or globally for specific resources. Oil, coal, and gas are the three most important fuels for powering the modern world. These resources are not uniformly distributed over the earth, so some countries have larger reserves than others. Due to the uncertainty of the reserves numbers, estimates of RPR vary widely. The oil and coal production (annual usage) values

If I Were a Carpenter (Bobby Darin album)

If I Were a Carpenter is an album by American singer Bobby Darin, released in 1966. It was a significant change in direction for Darin considering his previous album ("In a Broadway Bag") was a collection of show tunes.
History.
Having previously built his career recording mainstream pop music, Darin's musical output became more "folky" as the 1960s progressed. In 1966, he charted with folksinger Tim Hardin's "If I Were a Carpenter". It was Darin's return to the Top 10 after a four-year absence (the single peaked at No. 8 in the US and No. 9 in the UK in 1966). The tracks leaned heavily towards songs by Hardin and John Sebastian — seven of the songs were written by these two songwriters and Darin's next album would follow a similar process. The song "Red Balloon" had not yet been released by Hardin. It would appear on his album 1967 album "Tim Hardin 2". In his "Allmusic" review, Richie Unterberger, stated "Hardin himself was convinced that Darin had copied his vocal style by listening to his yet-to-be-issued version and the album as a whole boasts a production similar to the orchestrated folk-rock heard on the debut (sic) album in question, though it sounds like an inferior copy." Both Darin's "If I Were a Carpenter" and Hardin's "Tim Hardin 2" were produced by Charles Koppelman and Don Rubin and Koppelman had originally signed Sebastian's band, The Lovin' Spoonful.
The album reached number 142 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart. Darin's cover of "Lovin' You" reached the Top 40.
"If I Were a Carpenter" was reissued in 1998 on the Diablo label combined with Darin's next release, "Inside Out".
Reception.
Music critic Richie Unterberger wrote in his Allmusic "... this is a fair but unexceptional record. Darin falls short of the originals on Buffy St. Marie's "Until It's Time for You to Go" and the Lovin' Spoonful's "Daydream." In fact, aside from "If I Were a Carpenter," the standout is the odd low-charting single "The Girl Who Stood Beside Me," with its odd muted psychedelic bagpipe effects constantly buzzing in the background of an actual fairly strong folk-rock tune."

Eunoia is an anthology of univocalics by Canadian poet Christian Bök. Each chapter is written using words limited to a single vowel, producing sentences like: "Hassan can, at a handclap, call a vassal at hand and ask that all staff plan a bacchanal". The author believes "his book proves that each vowel has its own personality, and demonstrates the flexibility of the English language." The work was inspired by the Oulipo group, which seeks to create works using constrained writing techniques.
The book was published in Canada in 2001 by Coach House Books; sold 20,000 copies; and won the 2002 Canadian Griffin Poetry Prize. Canongate Books published a British edition in 2008. The book sold well in the United Kingdom, making The Times list of the year's top 10 books and becoming the top-selling book of poetry in Britain.
The title eunoia, which literally means "good thinking", is a medical term which refers to the state of normal mental health, and is also the shortest word in the English language which contains all five vowels. The cover features a chromatic representation of Arthur Rimbaud's sonnet "Voyelles" (Vowels) in which each vowel is assigned a particular colour and consonants appear grey.
Sections.
Eunoia.
The main section of the book consists of five chapters: "A", "E", "I", "O" and "U". In each of these chapters, the only vowel used is the same one as the title. For example, in Chapter A, the only vowel used is "A". There are other rules given to each of the chapters.

Woollins' reagent

Woollins' reagent is an organic compound containing phosphorus and selenium. Analogous to Lawesson's reagent, it is used mainly as a selenation reagent. It is named after Professor John Derek Woollins, who is currently head of chemistry at the University of St Andrews.
Preparation.
Woollins' reagent is commercially available. It can also be conveniently prepared in the laboratory by heating a mixture of dichlorophenylphosphine and sodium selenide (Na2Se), (itself prepared from reacting elementary selenium with sodium in liquid ammonia). An alternative synthesis is the reaction of the pentamer (PPh)5 with elementary selenium.
Applications.
The main use of Woollins' reagent is the selenation of carbonyl compounds. For instance, Woollins' reagent will convert a carbonyl into a selenocarbonyl. Additionally, Woollins' reagent has been used to selenonate carboxylic acids, alkenes, alkynes, and nitriles.

Petrila Mine disaster

On November 15, 2008, 12 miners died after two explosions at a mine in Petrila, one of six coal mining cities in the Jiu Valley region of Hunedoara County, Romania. On November 24 another miner died at Floreasca Hospital in Bucharest raising the death toll to 13.
Background.
Two explosions in a coal mine in southwestern Romania Saturday killed eight miners and four emergency workers, officials said.
Prime Minister Călin Popescu Tăriceanu said the explosion that killed the miners in the coal-rich Jiu Valley occurred Saturday afternoon at a depth of 800 feet (250 meters).
Later, a second explosion killed the four rescue workers, said Ilie Păducel, mayor of the town of Petrila where the mine is located.
Hundreds of relatives gathered at the mine after the first explosion, Realitatea TV reported. Romanian President Traian Băsescu said he would travel to the site later Saturday.
Mine officials said the explosions were believed to have been caused by an accumulation of methane gas. Officials have banned anyone from going down the mine for the next 48 hours.
Eight injured miners are being treated for burns. Officials said about 100 miners were working at the time of the first explosion.
Relates.
"We don't know anything, he is down there in the mine, that's all we know, we know absolutely nothing of him," one relative said.
Another complained: "I don't know where to go, nobody tells us anything, I don't know whether I should stay here or go to the hospital."
Men stand outside the Petrila mine waiting for news.
Some 100 people were working in the mine at the time of the first blast.
Mining was once a thriving industry in Romania, employing almost half a million people, and miners were a feared political force in the 1990s.
But the industry has struggled in recent years to compete against cheaper imported coal and cleaner forms of energy.

Short S.32

__NOTOC__
The Short S.32 was a British four-engined all-metal long-range transport monoplane designed by Short Brothers to Air Ministry Specification 14/38. It would have been one of the first British pressurised airliners. 
Development.
The Air Ministry issued specifications (14/38 and 15/38) for two large transport aircraft comparable in size with the Junkers Ju 90 and Focke Wulf Fw 200. The ministry placed a contract with Shorts for three prototypes designated the Short S.32 against specification 14/38 and a production order for 14 Fairey FC.1s against specification 15/38. 
The S.32 was a four-engined mid-wing monoplane powered by Bristol Hercules radials. The S.32 had a tailwheel landing gear to overcome problems with a nose wheel retracting into a pressurised fuselage. The build of three prototypes for the Air Ministry was started at Rochester but due to the urgent need for the factory to build the Short Stirling construction was abandoned.
