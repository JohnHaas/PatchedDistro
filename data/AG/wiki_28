Charles Brunsdon Fletcher (5 August 1859 - 17 December 1946) was an English-born Australian surveyor and journalist who served as the editor of the "Sydney Morning Herald" for twenty years.
Birth and education.
Fletcher was the third of thirteen children of Ruth (née Bloor) and Charles Fletcher of Taunton, Somerset, England. At age five, his father joined his eldest brother, Joseph Horner Fletcher, in New Zealand as a Wesleyan missionary. Eight years later the family moved to Sydney and Fletcher attended Newington College, where his uncle, Joseph Horner Fletcher, was President and another uncle, Joseph James Fletcher, was a teacher. Charles Brunsdon Fletcher completed his education at Fort Street High School.
Surveyor.
On completion of his school years, Fletcher joined the Survey Department of New South Wales as a cadet. He rose to supernumerary draftsman in 1879 and became a field assistant four-year later, Before moving to Brisbane in 1884 he worked on the Detail Survey of the City of Sydney. He obtained his Queensland survey licence in 1885 and commenced private practice. For five years from 1888 he served on the Board of Examiners of Licensed Surveyors.
Journalist.
In 1893, Fletcher became a journalist and joined the Brisbane Courier as a leader-writer. He had previously written for William Lane's "Boomerang" and had served as secretary of the "Brisbane Literary Circle". He was also appointed Queensland correspondent of the Melbourne Argus. Fletcher was elected to Ithaca Shire Council from 1892 until 1898 and served as president in 1894. In December 1898 he became the editor-in-chief of the Brisbane Courier and served as such until to April 1903.
Sydney Morning Herald.
Fletcher returned to Sydney in 1903 as an associate editor of the Sydney Morning Herald and from 1918 until 1937 was Editor. When King George V and Queen Mary were crowned in 1911 he was a member of the Australian delegation and represented the Herald at the fourth Imperial Press Conference in London in 1930. For four years from 1923, Fletcher was the President of the New South Wales Institute of Journalists.
University of Sydney.
He served on the Senate of the University of Sydney from 1923 until 1939 and was instrumental in its establishment of a diploma course in journalism. Fletcher further served the University as a lay member of the Council of Wesley College from 1919. The Charles Brunsdon Fletcher Prize for Pacific History is awarded annually by the University.
Clubs.

Capricorn and Bunker Group

The islands and reefs of the Capricorn and Bunker Group are situated astride the Tropic of Capricorn at the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef, approximately 80 kilometres east of Gladstone, which is situated on the central coast of Queensland.
Many of these islands form part of the Capricornia Cays National Park and are part of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area.
General.
The Capricorn and Bunker group of islands of the southern Great Barrier Reef lies between 45 and 75 km from the adjacent departure ports and urban centres of Yeppoon, Gladstone, Town of 1770 and Bundaberg.
The Capricorn and Bunker groups (including Lady Elliot Island and Reef) are a distinct group of 22 reefs straddling the Tropic of Capricorn, at the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef. There are 16 permanent coral cays on these reefs, including twin cays on Hoskyn and Fairfax Reefs. North West Island (105 hectares) is the largest coral cay in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.
The islands have high natural values, notably breeding populations of seabirds, marine turtles and coral cay vegetation.
Capricorn Group.
The Capricorn Group of islands consists of nine coral cays:
Additional to these are several reef structures separate from the individual island but still part of the Capricorn Group of islands including
A tourist Resort and Marine Scientific Research Station have been established on Heron Island. A manned lighthouse operates at North Island and the Australian Museum conducts a field research station on One Tree Island.
Bunker Group.
The Bunker Group consists of five coral cays:
In association with
History.
European pre-discovery of the Group (close sailbys).
During Captain James Cook's first voyage of discovery he sailed well inside the island group's between 21 and 25 May 1770. Typically 2 to 5 miles offshore. He then made his second landing in Australia at the town of 1770.
Wednesday 23rd Continued our Course a long shore at the distance of about 2 Miles off having from 12 to 9, 8 and 7 fathom water until 5 oClock at which time we were abreast of the South point of a large open bay where in I intended to anchor. accordingly we hauld in close upon a wind and sent a boat a head to sound. after making some trips we anchor'd at 8 oClock in 5 fathom water a Sandy bottom the South point of the Bay bore E3/4 South distance 2 Miles and the north point NW1/4 N and about 2 Miles from the ^shore in the bottom of the bay...
In the AM I went a shore with a party of men in order to examine the Country accompanied by Mr Banks and the other gentlemen. we landed alittle within the South point of the Bay where there is a channel leading into a large Lagoon
During Matthew Flinders' Exploration of the Australian coastline in the "Investigator", a 334-ton sloop, to make a survey along the southern coast of the Australian mainland he passed inshore of the island group.
WEDNESDAY 4 AUGUST 1802, the wind had shifted gradually round, from north to the south-westward; and at noon the north head of Bustard, Bay was brought to bear S. 16° E., four leagues, our latitude being then 23° 48', and longitude 151° 40'. A low island was seen from the mast head, bearing north at the supposed distance of six leagues, of which captain Cook does not make any mention;* and the furthest visible part of the main land was a conspicuous hill, named Mount Larcom, in compliment to captain Larcom of the navy. It bore W. ½° N., ten or eleven leagues; but the coast line between it and the north head of Bustard Bay, seemed to be much broken.
[* A cluster of low islands, about fifteen leagues from the coast, was seen in the following year by Mr. Bunker, commander of the Albion, south whaler. He described the cluster to be of considerable extent, and as lying in latitude 23¾°, and longitude about 152½°; or nearly a degree to the eastward of the low isle above mentioned. It is probably to these islands, whose existence captain Cook suspected, that the great flights of boobies he saw in Hervey's Bay retire at night.]
Discovery of the Bunker Group.
In 1803 Captain Eber Bunker of the whaling ship "Albion" was the first European to discover the region and gave his name to the southern group.
The Mitchell Library holds a portrait of Eber Bunker wearing a white waistcoat and white linen ruffled shirt each with stand collars, a white stock at neckline, and a navy blue wool double-breasted jacket with brass buttons titled "Captain Eber Bunker, 1760–1836, The first of the Whalers, Arrived New South Wales 1791".
Charting of the Groups.
The southern cays and reefs were first chartered between 1819 and 1821 by Lieutenant Phillip Parker King Royal Navy initially in the "Mermaid" and later in the "Bathurst".
July 19, 1820 we steered on, and, a ten o’clock discovered a group of low woody islets. They were named Bunker Isles
The main charting exercise for all the islands and reefs was carried out in 1843 under the command of Captain Francis Price Blackwood in HMS "Fly" which was accompanied by the "Bramble".
In 1841 Blackwood was appointed to command the corvette HMS "Fly"in the first hydrographic survey commissioned by the Admiralty for exploring and charting the north-east Australian coast. The "Fly", fitted with costly instruments, and carrying two scientists, Joseph Jukes, geologist, and John MacGillivray, zoologist, sailed from Falmouth in April 1842 with the cutter "Bramble", under the charge of Lieutenant Charles Yule. After a stop in Hobart Town from August to October, the two ships called at Sydney and began the survey in December 1842.
In the next three years the "Fly" charted from Sandy Cape to Whitsunday Island, including Swain Reefs and Capricorn Islands and the broad passages between. On 7 January 1843, was the first time that the crew of the "Fly" set foot on the First Bunker Island (Lady Elliot Island). The "Fly" then carried on and on January 10, 1843, anchored off One Tree Island and gave the island its name the Crew of the "Fly" landed on this island the following day
The single tree (which was in fact a small clump of common pandanus of these seas, with its roots exposed above ground)...
On January the 12th We anchored a few miles farther to the N.W. in the centre of a group of reefs and islands, under one thickly wooded island that afterwoods obtained the name if Heron Island...
Jan 13 to 18 - The Fly, the Bramble and the boats were engaged in surveying the group of islands and reefs about, which, from the tropic of Capricorn running through them, have been called the Capricorn Group...
Jan 18 - Landed with Captain Blackwood on Wreck Island. This was so named for part of a vessel 6 or 700 tons. The island was about a quarter of a mile long and not more than 100 yards broad; a pile of sand covered by thick bushes.
Jan 21 Captain Blackwood and Mr Evans being ashore to “take sights” for the chronometers, found on the island some traces of the wrecked crew. On one tree was cut “The America, June 1831;” on another “Mary Ann Broughton;” on another “Capt. E. David;” and “Nelson November, 1831.” There were likewise the soles of a pair of child’s shoes, some bottles, some broken dishes, and an old cask. I believe the wreck was that of a whaler, and that the crew were taken off by another whaler, as there were no signs of either graves or bones.
The naturalist, Professor J. Beete Jukes, was on board the HMS "Fly" and his published journal provides valuable information on some of the cays.
Early uses — guano mining 1890s.
The mining of guano (bird droppings) was carried out by J. T. Arundel & Co, a company controlled by John T. Arundel that evolved into the Pacific Islands Company. Mining occurred on Lady Musgrave Island, Fairfax Islands and North West Island during the 1890s. This was an extension of a more substantial guano mining operation on Lady Elliot Island to the south and several of the south Coral Sea Islands particularly Bird Islet part of Wreck Reefs and Raine Island. Where profound impacts on vegetation were sustained as a result of the industry. Some remains of these activities are still evident.
A good description of part of the operations from 1899 can be found below
The Pacific Islands Company, having worked cut the guano deposits at Fairfax Island, Bunker Group, is now transferring their plant to North-west Island In the Capricorn Group, which will be "the head- quarters for some time to" come (says the "Bundaberg Star" of yesterday). The steamer "Lady Musgrave", which was chartered by the company for this work, returned to Bundaberg on Sunday afternoon, bringing Mr. A. E. Ellis, the local manager, and account forty Japanese, whose services are being dispensed with. The captain of the "Lady Musgrave" reports that he had helped to complete the work of removal from Fairfax to North-east Island. In about ten days, but, owing to the bad weather experienced, it occupied sixteen days to get through with It. So bad was the weather, that in fourteen days the vessel was only able to Steam for fifty hours, the steamer having to take shelter behind one of the islands from the heavy squalls and rain. The "Lady Musgrave" left Fairfax Island at 4 p.m. on Saturday, with the ketch "Loma Doone" in tow. Heavy weather was encountered, and at 3 p.m. on Sunday the line parted, and not withstanding all the efforts made, it proved impossible to pick up the ketch again, and it was decided to make for Burnett Heads, which were not reached, as stated, till 4 p.m. the same day. The "Loma Doone" apparently got through all right, for she was reported off Bustard Head on Sunday, and is expected to arrive here tomorrow
Yet latter during September 1933 the leases and guano rights of Fairfax and Hoskyn Islands, off Gladstone, were sold by auction at Gladstone. They were bought on behalf of the Barrier Reef Phosphate (Guano) Syndicate.
It is unsure if the project ever succeed in the removal of guano from Hoskyn Islands.
Early uses — turtle soup canneries.
Turtle soup canneries operated on North West Island from 1904–14 and 1924–26, and on Heron Island from 1925–29. Old boilers and other remnants from these activities remain on site.
Tourist resorts 1930s.
A concrete slab is the only remnant of a resort which operated at Lady Musgrave Island during the 1930s. The island had been a hub for a number of pleasure cruises when eventually more extensive construction of tourist facilities occurred in 1938 and 1939 at Lady Musgrave Island, including six cottages and other facilities.
In 1932 Captain Christian Poulsen, engaged in bringing fishing parties to the reef, realised the potential of Heron Island as a tourist attraction. In 1936 he bought the lease of the island for £290 and set up a tourist resort which is still in operation.
Islands as military target practice 1940s.
East and West Fairfax Islands were used as a bombing range by the Royal Australian Air Force and Royal Australian Navy from the 1940s through to the 1960s.
It is likely that during World War II Lady Musgrave reef was also used for bombing practice “with the reef now practically a marine desert” as reported in 1952.
Historic and other shipwrecks, as well as an aircraft wreck, are located on several reefs surrounding the cays.
Current uses.
A lighthouse was constructed on Lady Musgrave Island in April 1974.
Much of this area comes under the Capricornia Cays National Park with current usages including camping, permitted on four cays up to the following limits:
The area also has many visits by both passing vessels cruising the Queensland cost and day trippers in fast jet catamarans (typically Lady Musgrave Island).
The area is also of significances as a fishery particularly for King Prawns.
Geomorphology and landscape.
The Capricorn and Bunker Cays form part of a distinct geomorphic province at the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef. The cays and their reefs lie on the western marginal shelf, and are separated from the mainland by the Curtis Channel. The cays are not generally visible from the mainland, although Masthead Island may be viewed from Mount Larcom on a clear day.
Geologically the cays are young, having developed during the Holocene period, they are mostly around 5000 years old. The sea level was much lower during the last Ice Age (at the end of the Pleistocene period) and the coastal plane on which today’s reefs and cays developed was completely exposed. Early in the Holocene (around 10,000 years ago) the sea level began to rise, until it stabilised at its present level around 6000 years ago. Once the sea level stabilised, it was possible for reef flats to expand and provide potential sites for the formation of cays.
Four distinct reef types occur within the Capricorn and Bunker Groups
The cays occur on planar reefs of various sizes and with various levels of exposure to the prevailing winds. These factors have largely determined cay size and composition, which consists either of shingle, sand, or a mixture of both. Cay stability is profoundly affected by cyclonic disturbance.
The coral cays belong to two distinct types:
The sand cays are all located to the lee of their reef flat, whereas the shingle cays, with the exception of Lady Musgrave, are located on the windward side. They vary in size, covering from one to 12 percent of the reef top surface area and there does not appear to be any correlation between island size, reef size, or stage of reef development.
Fauna.
Birds.
The Capricorn and Bunker Group contains 73–75 percent of all seabird biomass in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area.
All the cays, except Broomfield Cay, have been identified as significant seabird breeding islands. In recent years, a colony of lesser crested tern "Sterna bengalensis" has used Broomfield Cay for breeding. Up to eight seabird species breed on Masthead Island, One Tree Island and Wreck Island, and seven species are recorded from Tryon Island, Erskine Island and Fairfax Islands.
The islands making up the Capricorn and Bunker Groups provide habitat for thousands of nesting seabirds, including
The breeding season is between October and April.
The White-bellied Sea-eagle ("Haliaeetus leucogaster") once nested on most of the cays and breeds during the winter months, nest sites are now restricted to Tryon, North West, Wilson, Wreck, East Fairfax and West Hoskyn Islands.
All-year resident and breeding within the group are:
Migratory Waders often sighted within the group include:
The bird family Charadriidae includes the plovers, dotterels, and lapwings,
As well as the Scolopacidae are which are a family of waders. Many of the smaller species are often called "sandpipers" and include curlews and snipes.
Birds that often visit the group includes:
The Haematopodidae or Oystercatchers
The bird family Phalacrocoracidae is represented by some 40 species of cormorants and shags 2 of which are regularly found in the area
The bird family Sulidae comprises the gannets and boobies. Both groups are medium-large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish
Terns are seabirds in the family Sternidae, previously considered a subfamily (Sterninae) of the gull family Laridae. They form a lineage with the gulls and skimmers which in turn is related to skuas and auks. Terns have a worldwide distribution.
The Cuckoos are a family, Cuculidae, of near passerine birds. The order Cuculiformes, in addition to the cuckoos, also includes the turacos (family Musophagidae, sometimes treated as a separate order, Musophagiformes).
Known shipwrecks on the reefs.
America a wooden ship of 391 tons and 108 feet in length. The vessel had been built in Quebec, Canada, in 1827, owned by James Gray and captained by Robert Donal. The vessel "America" had taken convicts to Sydney in 1829 and to Hobart in 1831.
But while en route from Sydney to Batavia in ballast, the vessel struck a reef near Wreck Island and was wrecked on 20 June 1831. The crew launched two boats and eventually reached Morton Bay. The whaling barque "Nelson" and the "Caledonia" were involved in salvage of anchors, spars and rigging.
Diana A wooden carvel schooner / brig of 103 tons and 70 feet in length built in Sydney in 1847 by the builder Ale and owned by C.L. Throck. The vessel ran aground on 1 June 1864 in the Bunker Group at the northwestern side of "middle island" (she was wrecked on Fairfax Island (middle island - Bunker group)) while loading guano.
The "Diana" was a vessel engaged in guano mining. The "Boomerang" sited the wreckage on the northwestern side of "middle Bunker island" on 13 August 1864 and the crew went ashore and found part of the wreck had been salvaged with equipment and tents hauled onto one of the islands and the wreck had broken into two parts with many timbers strewn about on the reef salvaged but no sign of life. The crew had been rescued by the schooner "Caroline" (also reported by press as "Eleanor Palmer").
Pioneer Was wrecked on 12 March 1866 on Masthead Reef or Polmaise Reef. The 87-ton, two-masted schooner had been built in San Francisco in 1854. The "Pioneer" was a regular coasting schooner; during the 1860s she had been carrying a cargo of timber and no lives lost.
The vessel struck an outcrop of Masthead Reef on 12 March, an anchor was dropped but she dragged along the rocks until stopped by a large rock which pierced her bottom and held her upright. The crew launched a boat and sailed to Keppel Bay.
Britons Queen struck Masthead Reef/Polmaise Reef on 21 March 1866. The 2 masted schooner of 119 tons had been built in 1837 at Cowes on the Isle of Wight and was a regular coasting schooner during the 1850s and 1860s; it had on board a cargo of hides and tallow as well as 7 passengers.: All of the 14 passengers and crew landed safely on Masthead Island, then proceeded to Rockhampton.
Cosmopolite was wrecked on 15 October 1866 on Masthead Reef/Polmaise Reef. The vessel was a wooden carvel Brig of 145 tons and 85 feet in length and originally named "David Henshaw" built in Newcastle in Maine and had previously been registered at San Francisco (1849) at it arrived in Hobart on 17 April 1851 after having been purchased by Mr Boys for 700 stg.
When the vessel struck it had been in ballast and was salvaged with no lives lost. Bound from Sydney to Gladstone with cattle, she went ashore Masthead Reef and became a total wreck.
Willing Lass sunk 5 July 1868 on Masthead Reef or Polmaise Reef Brigantine (Barquentine?) of 107 tons and 81 feet in length. Built in Nova Scotia by Jam in 1852 the vessel was struck by a squall during a voyage from Rockhampton to Richmond River under the command of McNeil. A course was set to steer her ashore when the wind dropped, leaving her helpless to drift onto the reef where rising seas soon destroyed her no lives lost carrying ballast shallow site.
Jane Lockhart sunk between 11 and 17 December 1868 on Lady Musgrave Island / Heron Island / Masthead Reef or One Tree Island. The vessel was a two-masted schooner. Departed from Sydney with general cargo for Broadsound; and ran aground on Lady Musgrave Is; maybe on Heron Is or One Tree Island or Masthead Reef. Lost on a reef off Heron Island on the night of 17 December 1868. The crew took to the boat and safely reached the pilot station at Keppel Island.
The vessel was originally stated as having hit at Lady Musgrave reef (most unlikely) later news reports claim wreck on Heron Island with some other reports mention the wreck on either One Tree Island or Mast Head.
The vessel was built in 1861 at Ulladulla New South Wales and registered in Sydney with the Official number of 36858 and a Registered number of 9/1861 with a gross tonnage of 80 tons and 82 feet in length
Hannah Broomfield a brigantine was lost on 30 April 1872 in the vicinity of the northern edge of the Capricorn Islands Most of her cargo and gear was recovered and the vessel was latter refloated from Broomfield Reef but some time later wrecked in New Zealand in 1880. Built in the Tweed River of New South Wales in 1865 and registered in Wellington she had a gross tonnage of 120 tons and was 90 feet long
Polmaise was a barque which hit Polmaise Reef off Masthead Island on 2 February 1873. She was outward bound from Rockhampton for London with a general cargo the vessel was subsequently salvaged. It is believed that the wreck site has been found and it lies in shallow water. The vessel struck the reef and remained fast on falling tide. The master and most of the passengers left in the pinnace to obtain assistance, leaving the mate in charge. The "Polmaise"
After which the reef in named was a wooden Barque of 753 tons and 171 feet in length was built by Ale in Dundee England in 1853 
Abandoned when a vessel was sighted bearing down to their assistance.,
Agnes was a two-masted wooden schooner 82 feet in length and 96 tons. Built in Singapore in 1875 was wrecked on North Reef or Tryon Island reef on a voyage from Sydney to Townsville with general cargo of wool on 16 September 1878
Tambaroora on 22 July 1879 the steel steamship struck Polmaise Reef The steamship was 162 feet in length and 406 tons built in Glasgow in 1875, she was wrecked on Polmaise reef while on a voyage to Rockhampton from Sydney via Brisbane and Maryborough, carrying general cargo of grain/produce no lives were lost. The wreck was later purchased for 140 pounds and hopes were high that she could be refloated until examination showed her to be breaking up underwater She lies in shallow water about 100metres from the reef and her stern post comes very close to the surface, a hazard to boats trying to find the wreck. The wreck is mostly flattened but her boilers a compound single screw motor, rudder and propeller still remain making it a nice change from the reef dives in the area. Within 50metres of the Tambooroora lies the unidentified remains of a timber wreck and within half a mile lie two other wrecks of historical significance, including the wreck of the "Polmaise", which the reef is named after, all four ships are declared historic shipwrecks
Deutschland A German wooden three-masted barque of 833 tons built in Ost Hammelwarden (Hamburg)., Germany in 1858 of 150 x 32 x 17.5 ft. hit Polmaise Reef on 22 July 1883 Carrying 1,000 tons of general cargo for Rockhampton from London including cast-iron screw piles for the Port Alma Wharf a church organ built to order in London for St. Pauls Church, this German barque ran onto Polmaise (Masthead?) Reef and eventually with plans underway to have her refloated but a gale on 29 September 1883 broke her up became a total loss. The cargo was salvaged during the same year by a large number of vessels the salvaged cargo was sold at auction in Rockhampton 
The wreck has been found and lies in shallow water
Waterwitch a brigantine of 165 tons built 1873 stuck on 27 August 1884 Polmaise Reef or Masthead Reef 
Bannockburn an , 110-ton brigantine built at Mechanic's Bay, Auckland in 1880 on 9 November 1884 struck no. 1 Bunker Island and was refloated after cargo (timber) salvaged, taken to Rockhampton. Eventually became a total loss due wrecking in Fitzroy River 1905.
Italy The 285-ton wooden barque built in Cardiff, Wales in 1867 on a voyage to Cooktown from Newcastle with coal struck a reef (Boult Reef) to the north of No.3 Island in the Bunker Group on 16 November 1885. The master and crew landed safely on the island and after a short rest proceeded to Gladstone. Following and enquiry the master and mate were severely censured.
Wisteria Sunk 14 September 1887. The wooden barque built as the 387-ton "Look At Home" in 1865 at Gloucester, Mass. On a voyage from Adelaide to Townsville with a cargo of flour, bran, chaff and cement broke up on One Tree Island. An inquiry found that her loss was caused by the incompetence of her master and mate. The master's certificate was cancelled.
Wreck site found in 1957 in twenty-eight metres. Only the anchor chain, windlass and cement barrels were found.
Eastminster An iron emigrant vessel of 226 feet and 1208 tons Built in Glasgow in 1876 Last seen after departing Maryborough after ignoring a warning from the pilot but still headed out to sea in a rising gale on 17 February 1888 bound for Newcastle, presumed lost during cyclone; wreckage reported on a coral reef approx. 100 miles east of Rockhampton.
Louisa Lamont A wooden schooner of 74 tons and 81 feet built on the Williams River, NSW lost at Lamont Reef/Wistari Reef on 22 February 1888. The vessel salvaged and refloated and subsequently lost in Bass Strait March 1901.
Darcy Pratt on 21 January 1893 the wooden carvel brigantine / barquentine "Darcy Pratt" struck Polmaise Reef while on a voyage to New Zealand with cargo of bone/bone dust from Rockhampton ; not salvaged. She was 96 feet long and 149 tons and built in Jervis Bay NSW in 1876
Progress on 29 May 1900 the 20-ton ketch "Progress" hit Polmaise reef on the southern side while carrying a cargo that included explosives. The vessel had left Brisbane on 23 May 1900 and as the vessel passed Bustard Head during the night on a North West course. At 2:30 am the vessel struck Polmaise Reef and was carried onto the reef by a strong spring ebb
Pacific The 132-foot, 252-ton screw steamer on 3 July 1903 was wrecked on Fitzroy Reef . The Steamer was specifically designed for transporting timber .

While running from Brisbane to Cairns with passengers she ran gently on to North Reef near Heron Island, Queensland, 7 July 1926 and sent out an S.O.S call. The "S.S.Burwah" responded to her call and rescued her crew of 84 and 200 passengers. After several unsuccessful salvage attempts she was abandoned to the underwriters it was latter gutted by fire on 26 January 1927. She now lies broken up and scattered over the reef and a few beams and machinery parts in the coral in 4 metres of water her boiler remains visible on the beach near the North reef lighthouse. .

Jack Lewis (screenwriter)

Lt. Colonel Jack Lewis or C. Jack Lewis USMC retired (November 13, 1924 – May 24, 2009), was a former Marine, screenwriter, author of 12 books and an estimated 6,000 magazine articles and short stories, He was the co-founder and editor of "Gun World" magazine and continued contributing articles to that publication until the time of his death. Lewis wrote under the name C. Jack Lewis due to four other writers with the name of Jack Lewis.
Biography.
Lewis was born in Iowa. He sold his first short story "The Cherokee Kid's Last Stand" at the age of 14 for $5.00 that Lewis thought was better money than a field hands wage that was then a dollar a day. Buoyed by his success Lewis submitted an unsolicited "Andy Hardy" screenplay that was rejected by MGM. He did not sell any more stories until he was 22.
Lewis recalled being lost as a child in a Department Store and being found by two Marines in dress blues. He enlisted in the United States Marine Corps at 18 years of age in World War II and was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in 1945.
After the war, Lewis attended the University of Iowa where he earned a Bachelor's Degree in Journalism. After obtaining the degree, Lewis reentered the Marine Corps through the Marine Corps Reserve. He worked on a Marine training film then was assigned as a technical advisor to the film "Sands of Iwo Jima" where Lewis said he advised the cast how to lace up their leggings.
Screenwriting.
Lewis began his screenwriting career in 1950 with several Westerns, including the Lash LaRue feature "King of the Bullwhip" for Ron Ormond.
With the start of the Korean War, Lewis returned to active duty for six years in the Corps. He served as a Combat Correspondent and Photographer, where he earned the Bronze Star during his second Korean tour, filming Marine aircraft bombing enemy positions. During the Korean War, Lewis had his first experience with the M1 carbine. He fired eight rounds at an enemy soldier before a Marine with a Thompson submachine gun felled the soldier. Lewis discovered that six of his rounds had hit his target with no effect; Lewis began to carry a Thompson.
Lewis submitted over two dozen magazine articles to Marine Corps Headquarters about the exploits of the Marines in Korea. Headquarters sent them back saying that they sounded too much like Marine propaganda; Lewis sent them to his civilian literary agent who had them published with a payment for Lewis of $200 each. Lewis sent copies of the published articles to the Headquarters person who had rejected them.
After Korea, Captain Lewis served as a Company Commander in the 4th Marines at Camp Pendleton, then was transferred to Naval Air Station Kaneohe Bay as a Public Information Officer. During his Hawaiian tour, Lewis was assigned as one of the technical advisors to John Ford's "Mister Roberts". When no one could find a stunt performer to drive a motorcycle off a pier, Lewis did the job himself. Lewis appeared in Ford's film "Sergeant Rutledge".
Journalism.
Though Lewis's Commanding Officer offered to get him a Regular Commission, Lewis wished to become a full-time writer and left the Corps. In addition to his screenplays, film work, and story writing, Lewis became an editor of a magazine and after three years of observing the process teamed up with that magazine's art director Dean Grennell to publish "Gun World" magazine in 1959. Lewis authored the monthly knife column in "Gun World" until his death.
Lewis's writing on the capabilities of various weapons as well as his photos of "exotic" (military and law enforcement) weapons led several major firearms manufacturers to not advertise in "Gun World". Lewis told the then Commandant of the Marine Corps Paul X. Kelley that the M-16 rifle's effect was that "The United States used to be known as a Nation of Riflemen now we've become a Nation of Sprayers". 
Lewis's continued contact with the Marine Corps led him to-
In addition to non fiction, Lewis wrote "Charlie Cougar" mysteries and Westerns as well as "White Horse, Black Hat - A Quarter Century on Hollywood's Poverty Row", his memoirs of Hollywood.
Jack Lewis died on May 24, 2009 after a short bout with cancer.

Les West

Les West (born 11 November 1943) was one of the dominant figures of amateur and professional cycling in Britain during the 1960 and 1970s. He won the Milk Race twice, came second in the world amateur road race championship and fourth in the world professional championship.
Early career.
Born in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England, West's first ride was to Danebridge, when he was 15. He went with his uncle. The following year he joined the Tunstall Wheelers, a club in the Stoke-on-Trent conglomeration of towns in Staffordshire. He won the North Staffordshire 25-mile time-trial championship when he was 16. He beat one hour for 25 miles in 1961 and won North Staffordshire championships at 10, 25, 30 and 50 miles, won the area track league and became five-mile and 4,000m pursuit champion. 
His first international selection was for the Olympia's Tour, the amateur tour of the Netherlands, in 1964. He was unplaced.
International amateur.
West rode the Milk Race, the Tour of Britain for the first time in 1965, riding as a late selection for the Midlands. His local bike shop owner jokingly promised him a free bike if he won. West said: "I remember seeing my first Milk Race in Chester. I was about 16. It impressed me. And never did I imagine that I'd ride. My first one was in 1965 and I won it. Circumstances!" He won the points competition as well but he won overall, he says, only because several riders, including a leading Spaniard, were thrown out in the race's first positive dope tests. West's prizes for winning were a gold watch and a combined radiogram and cocktail cabinet.
That year he beat the national hour record, set a 25-mile time-trial record, won the Tour of the Cotswolds next day, won the national road championship and came second in the Isle of Man International. 
In 1966 West lived in the Netherlands, riding round-the-houses races. He said: "Fantastic, that was. Very, very fast." He rode Olympia's Tour, the amateur tour of the Netherlands, which he said averaged 29 mph. "But Holland left me legless for the climbs on the Milk Race" and he came sixth. "To me, that was nothing", he said.
That autumn he finished second to Evert Dolman of the Netherlands in the world championship on the Nürburgring circuit in Germany. The two had slipped clear of the field but West cramped in the sprint. He has refused to speak further of Dolman, going little further than saying "Well, he didn't ride exactly clean. At the end he told me so. Let's just say things were not right." Keith Bingham, writing in "Cycling Weekly" went further when he spoke of a rider so ill through the drugs he had taken that he no longer recognised journalists he had known for years. The description approaches Dolman, who was caught for doping as a professional. Dolman said "I couldn't win races without that stuff, that was obvious." 
West said an official from the British Cycling Federation approached him after the championship and said: "Good ride, son. What's your name?" West was to have joined Jacques Anquetil's Bic team, at the recommendation of British professional Vin Denson, but his contract didn't arrive and he stayed in Britain.
West won the Milk Race again in 1967, in what Keith Bingham of "Cycling Weekly" described as "astonishing style."
Professional.
Professional racing had developed in Britain but West held on for the Olympic Games in Mexico in 1968. He punctured early, waited for the mechanics in the service car behind the last rider, changed bikes twice, chased for 30 miles and gave up. The writer Clement Freud said West was so depressed that he hadn't noticed he was sitting on his banana sandwiches. He turned professional for the Holdsworth team, managed by a shopkeeper called Roy Thame in west London. It paid no more than he had been winning as an amateur, he said, but there were compensations.
His first win was the Tour of the Isle of Wight, held over three days at Easter. "That's my first pro win and probably my last", he said. He had four more wins and came second nine times.
His best international performance was fourth in the world championship in 1970, held in Leicester, England. West got into the winning break with Jempi Monseré of Belgium, Leif Mortensen and the Italian Felice Gimondi. Monseré won and West came fourth, troubled once more by cramp in the sprint. West won the British championship, broke the London-Portsmouth, London-Bath-London records, won the Tour of the Peaks and then in 1978 retired as a professional.
The rule was that professionals had to have a season out of racing before the British Cycling Federation would consider a return to the amateur. West said: "The BCF punished you... You'd be surprised by how much form and interest you lost. If you'd turned professional it was like you had a disease in them days. So that was it, such is life." He regretted that amateurs and professionals had not been allowed to ride together. He said: "A few years after I'd packed up racing, they let the pros ride the Milk Race, which could never have happened in the 1970s. It seemed like my generation were punished in that way, and it's a shame because it would have been good all round if we could have ridden it."
He started racing again, as an amateur, in 1980, rode for two years, then retired.
Veteran cycling.
West returned to cycling in the veteran class, and remarked on the fact that he was remembered by older neighbours in Stoke-on-Trent but not by others. In 2003 he dominated the national masters' championship in Warwickshire In September 2006, West became national champion of the League of Veteran Racing Cyclists and rode for GS Strada-Afford Rent-a-Car-Pinarello team which is sponsored by Phil Griffiths. He was 64.
Honours.
In 2009, he was inducted into the British Cycling Hall of Fame.

Cristóbal de Villalpando (1649 – 20 August 1714) was a Mexican painter, arts administrator and captain of the guard. He painted prolifically and produced many Baroque works visible in several Mexican cathedrals, including the cathedrals in Querétaro and Mexico City.
Life.
Born in Mexico City to the influential Villalpando family, he assumed duties in the local militia as an ensign, as well as painting with Baltasar de Echave Rioja (Echave the Younger) in the Echave workshop. In 1669, he married María de Mendoza, and fathered four children. Early on he received several religious commissions, both in Mexico City and in Puebla. Well preserved are his paintings in the sacristy of the Mexico City Cathedral.
Villalpando rose socially as well as militarily – gaining the rank of captain and several times being the director ("veeda") of the painters' guild.
Villalpando's self-portrait appears in his "Apparition of Saint Michael on Mount Gargano" in the sacristy of the Mexico City cathedral. His portrait is nested among the clergy at the bottom right. He died in Mexico City in 1714 and was buried there.
Style.
Villalpando's early works attest to the influence of Peter Paul Rubens; however, as his style continued to develop, he moved away from the extremes of vivid colouring and excessive robustness to a more measured style, using a broad palette and incorporating more of the New World painting traditions. In his later work he moved away from uniform luminosity, employing greater contrast and placing artificial light sources within his paintings to add a touch of drama. His work was much emulated
Villalpando tailored his style to the nature of the work and to its patron. He employed rough blots and smudges to good effect, but used meticulous brushstrokes when required.
Works.
Villalpando's early works include a number for the Puebla Cathedral, including a large painting of "The Transfiguration" – climaxing with the "Assumption of the Virgin" on the inside of the dome of the apse chapel, which included themes from the eucharist. For the sacristy of the Mexico City cathedral he painted
Most of Villalpando's portraits have been lost, as well as others of his religious works.

Chang'e 2

Chang'e 2 (; ) is a Chinese unmanned lunar probe that was launched on 1 October 2010. It was a follow-up to the Chang'e 1 lunar probe, which was launched in 2007. Chang'e 2 was part of the first phase of the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program, and conducted research from a 100-kilometer-high lunar orbit in preparation for the 14 December 2013 soft landing by the Chang'e 3 lander and rover. Chang'e 2 was similar in design to Chang'e 1, although it featured some technical improvements, including a more advanced onboard camera with a resolution of one meter. Like its predecessor, the probe was named after Chang'e, an ancient Chinese moon goddess. The total cost of the Chang'e 2 mission was approximately CN¥900 million ().
After completing its primary objective, the probe left lunar orbit for the Earth–Sun L2 Lagrangian point, to test the Chinese tracking and control network, making the China National Space Administration the third space agency after NASA and ESA to have visited this point. It entered orbit around L2 on 25 August 2011, and began transmitting data from its new position in September 2011. In April 2012, Chang'e 2 departed L2 to begin an extended mission to the asteroid 4179 Toutatis, which it successfully flew by in December 2012. This success made China's CNSA the fourth space agency to directly explore asteroids, after NASA, Europe's ESA and Japan's JAXA. As of 2014, Chang'e 2 is more than 70 million km away from Earth, and is conducting a long-term mission to verify China's deep-space tracking and control systems.
Design.
Chang'e 2 was broadly similar to the Chang'e 1 probe, but had important differences. While Chang'e 1 operated in a 200-kilometer orbit, Chang'e 2 flew at only 100 kilometers, allowing for higher-resolution images and more precise science data. The probe also possessed a higher-resolution camera, able to resolve features as small as across from orbit. According to Qian Huang of the Shanghai Astronomical Observatory and Yong-Chun Zheng of the NAOC, the spacecraft also had a shorter Earth-to-Moon cruise time of 5 days, rather than 12. The probe's launch rocket had two more boosters to accomplish this more direct route to the Moon. Furthermore, its laser altimeter's footprint was smaller than Chang'e 1's, achieving 5-meter vertical accuracy in its estimate of the Moon's radius. It also pulsed more frequently – five times per second rather than just once per second, as Chang'e 1's altimeter did. Additionally, the probe's main camera had a spatial resolution of , rather than .
Late in the mission, Chang'e 2's orbit was lowered to an elliptical one, with the same apolune (100 kilometers) as Chang'e 1, but with a perilune of only 15 kilometers. Tracking for the mission was performed with an X-band radio capability, which was not available for Chang'e 1. Zheng remarked that "the mission goals of CE-2 were focused into the high resolution image for the future landing site of CE-3 lunar lander and rover. The key technology about soft landing on the Moon will be tested in the CE-2 mission. The success of CE-2 will provide an important technical basis for the successful implementation of China's future lunar exploration."
Mission summary.
Launch.
Chang'e 2 was launched on 1 October 2010 at 10:59:57 UTC aboard a Long March 3C rocket from Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Xichang, Sichuan. The launch of the probe coincided with China's National Day on 1 October, in a symbolic celebration of the country's 61st anniversary.

The spacecraft entered an orbit with a perigee of 200 kilometers and an apogee of 380,000 kilometers, and separated from the carrier rocket as planned. It was the first time that a Chinese lunar probe directly entered an Earth-to-Moon transfer orbit without orbiting the Earth first. After the launch, Chang'e 2 arrived in its lunar orbit within 4 days and 16 hours, much faster than the 12 days taken by Chang'e 1. Later, the probe lowered its orbit to , with a perilune of . Chang'e 2 entered its 100 km working orbit on 9 October 2010 after three successful brakings. On 8 November 2010, the Chinese government announced the success of all of Chang'e 2's mission objectives, and published lunar surface images with a resolution of up to . In February 2012, the Chinese government released a complete lunar map constructed from Chang'e 2's data, claiming that it was the highest-resolution map of the entire Moon yet recorded.
L2 mission.
On 8 June 2011, Chang'e 2 completed its extended mission, and left lunar orbit for the Earth–Sun L2 Lagrangian point, to test the Chinese tracking and control network. The probe reached L2 on 25 August 2011 at 23:27 Beijing time (14:27 UTC) after a 77-day cruise, becoming the first object ever to reach the L2 point directly from lunar orbit, and travelling further than any previous Chinese space probe. The probe beamed its first batch of data from L2 in September 2011. Though it was expected to remain at L2 until the end of 2012, it departed on an extended mission in April 2012.
4179 Toutatis mission.
According to Ouyang Ziyuan at the 16th Conference of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chang'e 2 departed from L2 on 15 April 2012, and began a mission to the asteroid 4179 Toutatis. The flyby was successfully achieved on 13 December 2012 at 16:30:09 Beijing Time (08:30:09 GMT). Close-up images of the asteroid, with a resolution up to per pixel, were later published online. The flyby was the first time an unmanned spacecraft had imaged the asteroid so closely. Chang'e-2 came as close as to Toutatis, and took pictures of the asteroid at a relative velocity of per second. China thus became the fourth space agency to conduct a successful mission to an asteroid, after NASA, Europe's ESA and Japan's JAXA.
Deep-space journey.
It is estimated that by 2014, Chang'e 2 will reach a distance of 100 million kilometers from Earth; potentially, it has enough fuel remaining to continue functioning up to a distance of 300 million kilometers, according to the China Aerospace Corporation. The probe will be used to further verify China's deep-space tracking and control capabilities.

<doc id="20233508" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20233508" title="Baby Don't Go">
Baby Don't Go

"Baby Don't Go" is a song written by Sonny Bono and recorded by Sonny & Cher. It was first released on Reprise Records in 1964 and was a minor regional hit. Then following the duo's big success with "I Got You Babe" in the summer of 1965, "Baby Don't Go" was re-released by Reprise later that year and became another huge hit for Sonny & Cher, reaching the top ten in the U.S. and doing well in the UK and elsewhere, going as far as reaching number one in Canada. 
Background.
Salvatore "Sonny" Bono and Cherilyn "Cher" Sarkisian were an aspiring duo, with Bono writing and producing songs for the couple under the name Caesar and Cleo but with little success. In 1964 they decided to change their act's name to Sonny & Cher, and signed with Reprise Records. Reprise executives were apparently unaware that they already had Sonny & Cher signed as Caesar and Cleo.
Composition and recording.
Bono composed "Baby Don't Go" on an $85 upright piano that he had purchased and kept in the couple's garage or living room. Working in the middle of the night and lacking paper, Bono wrote the lyrics down on a piece of shirt cardboard, a practice he would continue with.
The musical arrangement features a rhythmic, rolling piano-and-harmonica foundation with a hyper-staccato electric guitar joining late in the verses. Lyrically, Cher sings as a poor 18-year-old girl from a broken family, unliked and frustrated in the small town she's lived in all her life. She shares her visions of going to a big city and becoming successful: 
The choruses are sung by Sonny (with near-equal backing from Cher) as the girl's boyfriend who wants her to stay:
In the conclusion the girl resolves to remain emotionally stable when she reaches the city and says she might come back to see the boy again someday. Bono's portrait of the girl in the song was partly based on Cher's early life (and indeed Cher would revisit the theme of the social outcast in her early 1970s hits "Gypsys, Tramps & Thieves" and "Half-Breed").
The recording was made at RCA's Hollywood Studios. Bono and the act's managers had to borrow and raise monies to fund the session, with the amount variously described as between $135 and $2,000 and the hocking of a typewriter and other office equipment involved. According to Cher, Leon Russell, Barney Kessel, and Don Randi (of what has since become known as The Wrecking Crew, and whom Bono knew from work with Spector at Gold Star Studios) participated in the recording at no cost.
The song was originally intended for only Cher to sing, but she got nervous and froze in the studio and asked Sonny to join her. She said later that the situation was like a classic Disney film: "joined me on the choruses, which was enough to take the pressure off me. Son was like Dumbo's good luck feather for me. If he was by my side, I had the confidence to do anything." Indeed, it was on this recording that Cher began to develop the assurance in her voice that would manifest itself in future hits. Moreover, the harmony scheme they adopted for the song – Cher singing low and Sonny doing the high part – was the opposite of the conventional male-female duo; it gave them a distinctive sound and they retained the practice on subsequent records.
Like other early Sonny & Cher material, "Baby Don't Go" was a well-produced pop effort. Bono's mentor Phil Spector liked the song and, for $500, bought a half share in its royalties, giving Bono some much-needed funding.
Releases and success.
In September 1964, they released "Baby Don't Go" on Reprise as their first effort under the name of Sonny & Cher. (By some accounts, Caesar and Cleo's take on "Love Is Strange" was released the same day as "Baby Don't Go"; by another, it was the first B-side for "Baby Don't Go".)
"Baby Don't Go" became a big local hit in Los Angeles and a minor regional hit on the U.S. West Coast but did not make the national charts. More importantly, it gained the couple additional attention within the industry, and led to the duo getting a recording contract from the Atco Records division of Atlantic Records while Cher gained a solo contract from the Imperial Records part of Liberty Records. 
The duo broke through with the huge success with "I Got You Babe" in the summer of 1965. "Baby Don't Go" was re-released by Reprise and became another big hit for Sonny & Cher. It played a major role in their rise to fame, peaking at number 8 on the U.S. pop singles chart, number 11 on the UK pop singles chart. It did even better in Canada, where it hit number one for two weeks in October 1965 (replacing Sonny's "Laugh At Me", which had been released around the same time and which had also capitalized on the new-found success of the pair in several countries). "Baby Don't Go" also placed in the top twenty in Sweden and the Netherlands.
The song was then included as the title track on the 1965 Reprise compilation album "Baby Don't Go – Sonny & Cher and Friends", an odd collection that also included some of the unsuccessful Caesar and Cleo material as well as songs from artists such as Bill Medley, The Lettermen and The Blendells.
Subsequent performances.
The duo's television performances of the song at the time tended to undermine its more serious side, with both Sonny and Cher doing some stage mugging. This followed the comic conceit they were known for and would embellish even more on the rest of their career.
The song missed being on a first couple of Sonny & Cher compilation albums due to contractual issues, but then was included in 1972's "The Two of Us". It later appeared on the 1991 "", as well as the 2003 "The Very Best of Cher", the 2005 "Gold", and the 2006 "The Definitive Pop Collection".
Cher performed the song as part of a Sonny & Cher medley on her 2002–2005 . In this form it appeared on Cher's 2003 video documentary "The Farewell Tour".
Other versions.
The song was recorded by The Fleetwoods on their 1965 album, "Folk Rock".
As performed by the band Annette, "Baby Don't Go" appeared on the soundtrack album for the 1986 low-budget music industry tale "Lovedolls Superstar".
The song gained some renewed visibility when it was recorded in 1997 by Dwight Yoakam and Sheryl Crow on the former's "Under the Covers" album. That arrangement recast of the verses into third person in order to give Yoakam additional vocal parts.
Dum Dum Girls recorded "Baby Don't Go" as the concluding track of their 2010 debut album "I Will Be". There it is slowed down and set against an ethereal synthesizer arrangement. Pitchfork describes it as showcasing "a real sense of fragility", and the effort was deemed a "lovely cover of the Sonny & Cher gem" by Allmusic.

Melbourne Jazz Co-operative

The Melbourne Jazz Co-operative (MJC), better known as the Melbourne Jazz Co-op runs two jazz concerts a week in Melbourne, the most active jazz presenter organisation in Australia. The organisation was founded by Martin Jackson, pianist Jamie Fielding, bassist Barry Buckley and others in late 1982 with the intention of presenting as wide a range of jazz styles as on offer in Melbourne at the time. A broad range of jazz styles were encouraged including rock-influenced, bebop, avant-garde to fusion.
The initial series of concerts were held on Sunday afternoons at RMIT's Glasshouse Theatre starting January 1983, with the organisation being funded by the Australia Council for $3,000. Arts Victoria also providing funding from 1987. The organisation was a vital catylyst for the development of Melbourne's contemporary jazz scene providing opportunities for local, interstate and international performers.
Before the 1980s co-ordination of Jazz concerts was particularly lacking. The NSW Jazz Co-ordination program helped the establishment of the Sydney Improvised Music Association in Sydney quickly followed by the establishment of the Melbourne Jazz Co-operative in 1982. Both sought and gained Federal Government Arts Council funding soon after establishment. Similar Jazz co-ordination programs were established in other states with Arts Council and State Government Funding. 
In January 1993 the Melbourne Jazz Co-op began the weekly Sunday night 'A-Live' Jazz series at the Bennetts Lane Jazz Club. A second weekly series, the 'Transitions' on Tuesday nights started in late 1997. In 2007 a third weekly series, the "Ezz-thetics" on Thursday nights was started at the Paric Cat Jazz Club.
In the late 1980s and 1990s numerous weekend jazz festivals were organised. In 1991 it contributed a contemporary segment to the Montsalvat International Festival of Jazz. The Melbourne Women's Jazz Festival was founded in 1997 and run by the organisation until 2003, when it was handed over to independent Festival Management, while still contributing some events.
In 2008 the 25th anniversary of the organisation was celebrated with a benefit concert which included many performers, including the Bennetts Lane Big Band performing the award winning jazz composition by Eugene Ball, "Fool Poet's Portion" suite. Other performers included Guitarists Ren Walters and Steve Magnusson, Saxophonist Jamie Oehlers and pianist Marc Hannaford as a duo, Mark Fitzgibbon solo piano set, performances from trios led by Allan Browne and Rob Burke, and the eight piece Mike Nock project.
Since presenting the Browne-Costello-Grabowsky Trio at its inaugural concert in January 1983, the MJC has presented hundreds of performances featuring many of Australia’s most respected musicians, from Melbourne and interstate, as well as a number of international artists who otherwise may not have performed in Melbourne. In 2009, the MJC presented 152 performances featuring over 130 ensembles.

Da'Rel Scott

Da'Rel Scott (born May 26, 1988) is an American football running back in the National Football League (NFL) who is currently a free agent. He was selected in the seventh round of the 2011 NFL Draft by the New York Giants. He played college football for the University of Maryland, where he was a starting running back. During the 2008 season, he was the second-leading rusher in the Atlantic Coast Conference, behind Jonathan Dwyer of Georgia Tech.
Scott played interscholastic football as a running back and free safety at Plymouth-Whitemarsh High School. He was moderately recruited, but Scout.com thought he was more suited to the position of wide receiver or cornerback at the intercollegiate level. In 2006, he enrolled at the University of Maryland, where he was moved to wide receiver, but he spent the entire season on redshirt status. The following season, he saw limited action as a reserve running back behind starters Lance Ball and Keon Lattimore. He also played on special teams as a kickoff returner, which was the coaching staff's attempt to get him on the field in some capacity because of his speed (4.31 seconds in the 40-yard dash and sub 10.5 seconds in the 100 meters)
In 2008, Scott took over as Maryland's starting running back and spent much of the season as the leading rusher in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). He was eventually surpassed by Dwyer, although both players were named to the All-ACC first team at the season's end. Scott also became the 2008 Humanitarian Bowl most valuable player when he broke the University of Maryland bowl game rushing record, and he finished the season with 1,133 rushing yards, the seventh Terrapin player to surpass a thousand yards in a single season.
Early life.
Scott was born on May 26, 1988 in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania to Gloria and Lee Scott, Sr. He has two older brothers, Lee Scott, Jr., who played football as a defensive back at La Salle, and James, who ran track at Saint Joseph's. When Da'Rel Scott was eight years old, his parents had a falling out, which prompted his father to leave the family. Thereafter, Lee Scott, Sr. was no longer involved in raising his sons and would often miss scheduled visits. Da'Rel Scott said, "He just kept letting me down. Just day by day, I was thinking, 'I need a father figure in my life.'" In high school, his attitude changed, and he said, "I don't need him." Despite the absence of his biological father, Scott grew up with the support of his mother, two brothers Lee and James, cousin Leroy, family friend and youth football coach Mike Shaw, and high school athletic director Charlie Foster.
He attended Plymouth Whitemarsh High School in Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania, where he was a four-year letterwinner in football, track, and basketball. In football, Scott was a three-year starter and played as both a tailback and free safety. During his senior year, he rushed for 2,523 yards and 38 touchdowns on 232 attempts. As both a junior and senior, he received the Maxwell Award for the conference player of the year. As a senior, "The Times Herald" named him the area player of the year, the Associated Press named him an all-state player, and he was invited to the Big 33 Football Classic all-star game. SuperPrep named him an all-region player. Rivals.com rated him a four-star prospect and assessed him as the 21st-ranked "athlete" recruit in the nation. Scout.com assessed him as a three-star prospect, and wrote of him, "This kid can flat out fly. He runs a sub 10.5 100 meters, and a sub 21.0 200 meters. Scott needs to get physically bigger to be a college running back; he may project better as a wide receiver or cornerback." Scott received scholarship offers from Georgia Tech, Penn State, Virginia, and his ultimate choice, Maryland. In 2006, he enrolled at the University of Maryland, where he studied kinesiology.
College career.
2006 season.
Scott sat out the 2006 season as a redshirt. After summer training camp, the coaching staff moved Scott to wide receiver, a position that lacked depth, but head coach Ralph Friedgen said that Scott had some difficulty making the adjustment. He was, however, named the offensive scout team player of the week for his performance in the practices before the Florida State game.
2007 season.
During 2007 spring practice, Scott was third on the depth chart, but suffered a left knee injury, which forced him to miss most of camp. During the 2007 season, he played in nine games as a reserve tailback behind Lance Ball and Keon Lattimore and as a kickoff returner. Despite the team's abundance of running backs, Friedgen wanted to utilize Scott in some capacity because of his speed, which had been recorded at 4.25 seconds in the 40-yard dash. Maryland wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey said, "On paper it says I'm faster, but Da'Rel, he's just a different type of animal." Against Wake Forest, he saw his first action when he returned four kickoffs for 101 yards. Scott's special teams performance in that game sufficiently impressed head coach Friedgen that he said, "I think I've got to try to get him involved within the offense. I think he's a guy that can make some plays for us." The following week, unranked Maryland upset 10th-ranked Rutgers, and Scott made his first career appearance as a tailback. He had three carries for 29 yards. After sitting out the Georgia Tech game because of an ankle injury, he returned four kicks for 68 yards against Virginia, three for 56 yards against Clemson, and two for 40 yards against North Carolina. Against eighth-ranked Boston College, Scott caught a short screen pass from quarterback Chris Turner and ran 57 yards for a touchdown. It was his first career reception and first career touchdown. It was one of just two offensive plays for Scott in that game, and incidentally, he was not intended to be in it. Friedgen said:"When he was in the game, I didn't even know he was in the game. I called a screen pass. I looked up, and it was Da'Rel in there. I figured we were just giving Lance a rest, but I asked backs coach Phil Zacharias about it Sunday and he started laughing. I said 'Did you put Da'Rel in for that screen pass?' He said, 'Lance's equipment was broken, so he had to go in the game.'"
In the loss to Florida State, Scott rushed twice for 17 yards and returned four kickoffs for 132 yards. On one return, Scott gained 60 yards and nearly broke away for a touchdown, but Maryland was unable to capitalize on the gain during the subsequent possession. The next week, Maryland secured bowl eligibility by winning its regular season finale against NC State. Scott returned the opening kickoff 36 yards and recorded 89 yards on eight carries to lead the team in rushing. In the 2007 Emerald Bowl against Oregon State, Scott had one carry for no gain and returned two kickoffs for 36 yards. Scott finished the season as the team's all-purpose yardage leader with 84.2 yards per game and kick return leader with 566 yards, which set a school record for a freshman. Rivals.com named him a freshman All-ACC all-purpose player.
2008 season.
After the graduation of running backs Ball and Lattimore, Scott competed with Morgan Green for the starting position. At the conclusion of spring practice, it appeared they would share the duties, as they had complementary running styles: Scott had breakaway speed, while Green was a hard runner for short-yardage gains. However, Green suffered a quadriceps injury that caused him to fall to the third-string position behind true freshman Davin Meggett.
During the season, Scott played in 12 of 13 games, including 11 starts, and recorded 1,133 rushing yards and eight touchdowns. In the first game of the 2008 season against Delaware, Scott ran for 197 yards in his first career start, which was enough to place sixteenth on the list for school all-time single-game rushing. The following week, underdog Middle Tennessee stunned Maryland, 24–14, but Scott set the game-high for rushing with 123 yards. He tallied his career-first rushing touchdown with a 63-yard run on the second play of the game. Scott "dominated early" against 23rd-ranked California with 19 carries for 87 yards and two touchdowns, but in the third quarter, he suffered a game-ending shoulder injury. His first-half effort helped Maryland take a quick lead and eventually upset California, 35–27. Scott sat out the next game against Eastern Michigan, but returned for the road game at 20th-ranked Clemson. Scott made 23 carries but gained only 39 yards, a mark that was surpassed by receiver Heyward-Bey on one reverse that gained 76 yards to spark a second-half comeback. Head coach Friedgen said:"I told Da'Rel he needed to run a little more north–south. Clemson has such good team speed. If you go east–west on them, you're not going to go very far. I thought he had a couple runs when he tried to bounce it outside. Normally, Da'Rel can do that. Not against this team . . . I told him this is a game where three yards is a good running play . . . I don't know if Da'Rel has been in a game like this, playing the whole game that way in a tough environment. He came out in the second half and said 'I'm going to go, coach.' He patted me on the butt. 'Just get me the ball.'"
Scott tallied the go-ahead touchdown to complete Maryland's comeback, 20–17. The following week, Maryland fell to a heavy underdog again when a reeling Virginia team engineered a 31–0 shutout. Scott, then the leading rusher in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), had 11 carries but was held to just 36 yards. Despite the setback, Scott retained the lead in the ACC with 96.4 rushing yards per game. After a bye week, Maryland shutout 21st-ranked Wake Forest, 26–0. Scott had 18 carries for a game-high of 73 yards, threw a nine-yard touchdown pass, and had three fumbles. In the first quarter, Scott fumbled at the Wake Forest 25-yard line, but was able to recover the ball. Two plays later, he executed a halfback option, where he took the handoff and threw a nine-yard pass to Heyward-Bey for a touchdown. It was Scott's first pass attempt and completion. Scott fumbled twice more in the first half, and Wake Forest recovered only to miss a field goal attempt each time. Against NC State, Scott had 23 carries for 163 yards and a 24-yard touchdown. In the fourth quarter, after the third play of Maryland's game-winning drive, Meggett replaced Scott, who had re-injured his shoulder. With the sixth win, Maryland attained bowl eligibility. Scott remained the ACC leading rusher with 102.6 yards per game. He was deemed questionable before the Virginia Tech game, but did see action. However, the Virginia Tech line held Scott to 11 yards on 10 carries, although he did manage five receptions for 57 yards. Against 17th-ranked North Carolina, Scott recorded 129 rushing yards and a three-yard touchdown run. Maryland entered its penultimate regular season game against Florida State still within reach of the Atlantic Division title, and with it, a berth in the ACC Championship Game. Florida State, however, dashed Maryland's title hopes in a 37–3 rout in which Scott recorded 82 rushing yards, but fumbled twice. In the fourth quarter, defensive end Everette Brown forced Scott to fumble, which was seen as the end to any potential comeback. Against a tough Boston College line, the Maryland rushing attack faltered, which forced quarterback Chris Turner to resort mostly to the pass. Scott rushed 13 times for a gain of just 19 yards.
In the postseason, Maryland accepted an invitation to the Humanitarian Bowl to play the Western Athletic Conference runner-up, Nevada. Before the game, however, head coach Ralph Friedgen caught Scott and six other players breaking curfew. Scott declined to comment to the media about why he had missed curfew, and Friedgen said only that Scott had tried to "help somebody and got put in a bad situation." Friedgen initially intended to send the offenders back to College Park by bus, but athletic director Deborah Yow convinced him to issue partial-game suspensions instead. Scott was benched until halfway through the third quarter. He said, "I made a bad decision. I felt I had to run with a purpose." Scott was put into the game on Maryland's third possession of the half but did not receive a carry until the following series. On his first attempt, he ran for 14 yards and then ran 11 yards on his second. During the next drive, he broke free on a 49-yard touchdown run. On the next possession, Scott rushed on all four plays and gained 66 yards and another touchdown. Maryland won, 42–35, and Scott was named the Terrapins' most valuable player of the game. Nevada head coach Chris Ault said, "He just ran through us like we weren't there. They ran the weak-side gap, we knew that was one of their base plays, and he did a great job. He's a heck of a back, no question about it. He was breaking tackles, and that's not only a difference-maker but a morale-changer." He ran for 174 yards, which broke the school record for rushing in a bowl game previously set by Lu Gambino in the 1948 Gator Bowl. Scott also became just the seventh Maryland player to surpass the 1,000-yard single-season rushing benchmark. Earlier in the season, Scott set that mark as one of his goals, and he adorned his room with the statistics of the Terrapins who accomplished that feat in the past, such as Chris Downs in 2002.
Scott spent much of the season as the leading rusher in the ACC, but he was eventually surpassed by Jonathan Dwyer of Georgia Tech and finished second in the conference. In early October, Scott was added to the Maxwell Award watch list. The Atlantic Coast Conference named Scott to the All-ACC first team alongside Dwyer.
2009 season.
During a practice in April 2009, Scott and cornerback Nolan Carroll collided, which injured both players. Scott suffered a sprained knee which forced him to sit out the Red–White spring game. He entered summer practice at the top of the depth chart, but Davin Meggett's camp performance was impressive enough to earn a share of the number-one position. In its 2009 preseason issue, "Phil Steele's" listed Scott as the 23rd-ranked draft eligible college running back, a preseason first-team All-ACC running back, and one of 19 "darkhorse" contenders for the Heisman Trophy. "Athlon Sports" named him to their preseason All-ACC second team. Before the season, he was added to the Doak Walker Award and Maxwell Award watch lists.
In the season opener at 12th-ranked California, Scott recorded 13 carries for 90 yards. He scored the Terrapins' only touchdown on a 39-yard rush in the third quarter of the 52–13 rout, Maryland's worst opening loss since 1892. The following week, Scott had 17 carries for 68 yards and a touchdown in an overtime win against James Madison. He recorded a 48-yard touchdown run against Middle Tennessee, but also two fumbles in the first quarter. Scott finished the game with 13 attempts for 117 yards., but coach Friedgen relied mostly on Meggett after the second turnover. Scott suffered a broken wrist against Clemson, a game that also saw Maryland left tackle Bruce Campbell injured. He sat out the next five games, before he returned in the penultimate game against Florida State, in which he ran 83 yards on 19 attempts and also had two receptions for 21 yards. The performance prompted Scout.com to note, "It's almost like this stud running back never missed a game for the Terps … it is impressive to see the junior hard at work and making up for lost time." In the season finale against Boston College, Maryland opened the game with Scott attempting a pass to wide receiver Torrey Smith on a halfback option play; it fell incomplete but drew a defensive pass interference call. Scott rushed for 45 yards and a touchdown on 11 attempts, and caught three passes for 20 yards.
2010 season.
In the winter, Scott competed on the indoor track team and ran a 60-yard dash in 6.87 seconds, and he claimed to have regained the speed he had in high school. During spring football camp, he recorded the fastest 40-yard dash time among the running backs at 4.33 seconds. Head coach Ralph Friedgen praised Scott for the strength and size he added in the offseason, and offensive coordinator James Franklin described Scott as a "complete back". Before the season, Scott was added to the Maxwell Award and Doak Walker Award watch lists.
Maryland entered the 2010 season with Scott and Meggett sharing time as the number-one running back. Head coach Friedgen said, "At this point in time, I would say Scott and Meggett are 1A and 1B." In the season opener against Navy, Scott recorded 58 yards on ten carries, which included five touches on the opening drive for 36 yards and a five-yard touchdown run. The following week against Division I FCS , Scott, Meggett, and redshirt freshman running back D. J. Adams all averaged over five yards per carry in the 62–3 rout. Scott amassed eight carries for 42 yards and three receptions for 31 yards. Maryland's rushing attack struggled in the 31–17 loss to West Virginia, and Scott had four carries for six yards and three catches for 26 yards. Against Florida International, he gained 103 yards and scored two touchdowns on 15 carries. Scott scored on a 56-yard run and a nine-yard run in which he broke three arm tackles. Duke held Scott to 26 yards in the first half, but in the third quarter, he caught a short pass from quarterback Danny O'Brien and ran down the sideline for a 71-yard touchdown. O'Brien said he repeatedly checked down through his available receivers and Scott was his final option. Scott finished with 14 carries for 50 yards.
At Clemson, Scott threw a four-yard touchdown pass to quarterback Danny O'Brien on a trick play for Maryland's only score in a 31–7 loss. He had four rushing attempts for 18 yards. During that game, Scott became the tenth player in school history to amass 3,000 all-purpose yards. At Boston College, Scott rushed nine times for 19 yards and caught one pass for four yards. He also filled in for injured kickoff returner Torrey Smith and had one return for 25 yards. Against Wake Forest, he had eleven carries for 50 yards and one reception for ten yards. At Miami, Scott rushed nine times for 30 yards and had a 12-yard reception. At Virginia, he carried the ball 11 times for 55 yards and had two catches for eight yards including a two-yard reception for a touchdown. Against 25th-ranked Florida State, Scott rushed ten times for 87 yards and caught two passes for eight yards. Scott was held to negative ten rushing yards on four touches by 23rd-ranked North Carolina State in his final home game on Senior Night, but Maryland still won, 38–31.
In the Military Bowl against East Carolina, Scott rushed for a career-high 200 yards on 13 carries, including two touchdowns on 61- and 91-yard runs, and was named the game's Most Valuable Player. He broke the school record for rushing in a bowl game that he previously set in 2008. His performance was described as "utterly electrifying", and left his "stock among draft-eligible running backs soaring with NFL scouts". His 15.4 yards per carry was the best single-game performance in school history. Scott ended the 2010 season with 708 rushing yards on 122 attempts and five touchdowns. He finished his college career with 2,401 rushing yards on 430 attempts and 17 touchdowns, and 3,509 all-purpose yards. Scott ranked seventh in school history in career rushing yards and second in career yards per carry with an average of 5.58.
Scott was invited to play in the East–West Shrine Game on January 22, 2011 in Orlando. He also participated in the Senior Bowl, and "The New York Times" praised him for his practice leading up to the game. In the Senior Bowl, Scott recorded five carries for 15 yards, including a touchdown on a one-yard run.
Professional career.
New York Giants.
The New York Giants selected Scott with the 221st overall pick in the 2011 NFL Draft. Giants general manager Jerry Reese said, "We took a flyer on the guy because he is big and fast… We hope this guy develops into a Willie Parker, one of those kinds of things." At the NFL Combine, Scott ran the 40-yard dash in 4.34 seconds, the fastest time recorded by any of the participating running backs.
Scott secured a spot on the active roster behind Ahmad Bradshaw and Brandon Jacobs with a strong preseason performance. In the game against the Chicago Bears, he had one carry for a 97-yard touchdown. Against the New England Patriots, Scott took a snap on a fake punt, which he ran 65 yards for a touchdown. He made his regular season debut in Week 1 against the Washington Redskins, but recorded no statistics. Scott only recorded five carries for 15 yards in 11 games played. He was a member of the Super Bowl XLVI champion team that defeated the New England Patriots by a score of 21–17.
On October 20, 2012, Scott was placed on season-ending injured reserve due to a knee injury.
On October 1, 2013, the Giants waived him after his first career start in the Week 4 loss against the Kansas City Chiefs.
On October 8, 2013, the Giants resigned Scott after running back David Wilson is out with a neck injury.
On October 15, 2013, the Giants waived him again after he injured his hamstring in the Week 6 loss against the Chicago Bears.
Personal life.
Scott motivates himself for games by channeling the anger at his father's abandonment. He said, "I am always going to have anger because of how he did me. It is always going to be there. It is not going away. No way at all." While basketball player Michael Jordan was Scott's childhood sports idol, he says Jordan was not the inspiration for his jersey number of 23. Scott chose it as a combination of his older brothers' high school numbers: James wore number 20, and Lee, Jr. wore number 3. Scott said, "They were my father."

Thoppil Bhasi

Thoppil Bhasi () (born 1924 April 8 – died 1992 December 8) was a Malayalam playwright, screenwriter, and film director. He was associated with the communist movement in Kerala and his play "Ningalenne Communistakki" (You Made Me a Communist) is considered to be a groundbreaking event in the history of Malayalam theatre.
Early life.
Born Thoppil Bhaskara Pillai, on April 8, 1924 at Vallikunnam in Alleppey district, Kerala, Bhasi was the eldest son of Thoppil Parameshwaran Pillai and Nanikkutti Amma.
Education.
His elementary education was at the SNDP Sanskrit School, and later on at the Sanskrit School, Changankulangara, from where he graduated in the Sanskrit Shastri course. Knowing fully well his desire to learn indigenous medicine, his father had him enrolled at the Ayurveda College, Thiruvanathapuram. It was here that he spearheaded the Students’ Agitation that led to installing many of the facilities and rights enjoyed by the current generation of students at the College of Ayurveda. He also graduated securing the Top Rank in the Vaidya Kalanidhi Examination.
Social life.
His deep and endearing friendship with Kambisseri Karunakaran that extended through all spheres of their lives, also saw them at the forefront of some of the most significant political agitations in central Kerala. Once a staunch supporter and activist of the Indian Congress party, Thoppil Bhasi soon distanced himself from the same on matters of principles and found his direction in the neo movement of Communism via the Communist Party of India. He was associated with the communist movements that took place in Kerala during the 1940s and 1950s. Branded a Subversive and a Wanted Man by the government, he was on the run and went underground during the period of 1948-52, as a top priority suspect in the infamous Sooranad Incident, with a Rs 1000 bounty on his head. He was later acquitted, and went on to contest the first Panchayat elections in Kerala. He won, becoming the first president of the Vallikunnom panchayat. He was elected twice to the state assembly contesting the Sate elections, from Bharanikkavu in 1954 and Pathanamthitta in 1957.
KPAC, theater and Malayalam films.
Thoppil Bhasi never contested any more elections post his 1957 win, in order to devote his entire energies to this new direction his life has set course on – theater. He had written his first One-act play Munnettam {The Advance}while on the run from the state, and based on the feedback received from the underground collective, had revisited, refined and re-energised the plot from a different perspective, creating the historical Ningalenne Communistaakki, both under his pseudonym Soman, for fear of revealing his true identity. The drama helped KPAC to become a force to reckon with on Kerala’s theatrical arena. Later,he wrote scripts for 110 Malayalam films starting from 'Mudiyanaya Puthran' in 1961,most of them mega hits.
His association with KPAC started with the staging of Ningalenne Communistaakki, and the entire proceedings from the show were donated towards the attorney fees needed to free the rest of accused in the Soornad Incident.He wrote the play "Ningalenne Communistakki" while in hiding in connection with the Sooranad case, which resulted from a revolt by agricultural workers against a landlord. Bhasi had to write the play under the name, Soman. "Ningalenne Communistakki" was first staged (under the banner of KPAC) in Chavara in Kollam district on December 6, 1952. He wrote 16 plays, for KPAC, each more spectacular and socially relevant than its predecessor and it used to be said in the 60′s and 70′s that there wasn’t a day where at least one of his plays was not staged at any part of Kerala ! Such was the influence of his creative power. From KPAC, he slowed moved to the film industry ( some say it was a natural progression ), authoring over 100 Screenplays and turned to directing 16 movies in Malayalam language, most of them box-office successes.
Personal life.
Thoppil Bhasi’s wedding with Amminiamma, the niece of C Shankaranarayanan – ex-Speaker of the Kerala Legislative Assembly was solemnised when he was on the run, a wanted man for the government! In a moving tribute, aptly titled ‘My Comrade’, Amminiamma, amongst other nuggets, shares her husband’s principle of simplicity and frugality in every aspect of his life. She recalls Udaya studio‘s Kunchacko asking her to buy him a new shirt as he was fed up of seeing Thoppil Bhasi in the same shirt every time! Thoppil seems to have famously remarked, “Chackochen, I have 8 shirts of the same color and type, and all eight have the same ‘beedi-burn’ patch at the left side of my breast-pocket !” He was the quintessential socialist, according to her. Thoppil Bhasi has 4 sons – Ajayan, Soman, Rajan and Suresh, and daughter Mala . Ajayan went on direct the award-winning Malayalam film Perumthachan in 1991.
Awards and recognition.
Thoppil Bhasi’s dramas, Mudiyanaya Puthran and Puthiya Akasham, Puthiya Bhumi were awarded the Kerala Sahithya Academy Awards, and the Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Academy awarded him its Fellowship in 1981. He is also the recipient of the Professor N Krishna Pillai Award and the SovietLand Nehru Award.
Literary works.
Thoppil Bhasi was prolific in terms of his creative output during his active years in theater and movies. He authored 16 full-length plays, screenplays for over a 100 movies, directed 16 movies and his autobiography was titled, Oliviley Ormakal. He was a regular contributor to the Janayugom Magazine and short stories to various publications which are yet to be collated and archived.
Death.
Thoppil Bhasi died on December 8, 1992.

Thank Heaven for Little Girls (album)

Thank Heaven for Little Girls is an album by Dwarves released via Subpop in February 1992. This album never charted.
Lyricism of "Thank Heaven for Little Girls" ranges from the macabre deaths of young ladies of the night in "Blag the Ripper" (inspired by the historical Jack the Ripper), to befriending Satan in "Satan," and to general selfishness in "Anybody But Me." The song title of "Dairy Queen" is inspired by being stranded at a local Dairy Queen restaurant in Missouri.

USS Wassaic (ID-3230)

USS "Wassaic" (ID-3230) was a cargo ship that served in the United States Navy from 1918 to 1919.
SS "Wassaic" was a steel-hulled, single-screw freighter built under a United States Shipping Board contract. She was launched on 14 April 1918 by the Los Angeles Shipbuilding and Drydock Company at Los Angeles, California. Subsequently taken over by the U.S. Navy for World War I use by the Naval Overseas Transportation Service (NOTS) and given Identification Number (Id. No.) 3230, she was commissioned at New Orleans, Louisiana, as USS "Wassaic" (ID-3230) on 14 October 1918 with Lieutenant Commander George H. Cooke, USNRF, in command.
"Wassaic" loaded 7,468 tons of United States Army supplies and got underway for Bordeaux, France, on 10 November 1918, the day before the armistice with Germany was signed, ending World War I. En route to Europe, "Wassaic" encountered mechanical difficulties and was obliged to put into New York City on 16 November 1918 for repairs. Underway again on 29 November 1918, "Wassaic", rerouted in light of the war's end, sailed for Brest, France, instead of Bordeaux.
Arriving at Brest on 13 December 1918, "Wassaic" got underway for the United States on 31 December 1918. After a stop at Corona, Spain, for repairs to her damaged propeller, "Wassaic" got underway from Corona on 6 January 1919. Following stops at the Azores and Bermuda, she made port at Newport News, Virginia, on 7 February 1919.
"Wassaic" took on a cargo of railroad supplies and departed the United States East Coast on her second NOTS voyage on 10 March 1919, bound for La Pallice, France. Arriving there on 23 March 1919, she discharged her cargo and returned to the United States, heavily ballasted partly with a cargo of steel rails. Putting briefly into Norfolk, Virginia, on 22 April 1919, "Wassaic" sailed for New Orleans on 23 April 1919, arriving there on 29 April 1919. Discharging her cargo of steel there, she shifted to New York. There, after final repairs and inventories, "Wassaic" was decommissioned, struck from the Navy List, and returned to the United States Shipping Board, all on 29 May 1919.
"Wassaic" remained in Shipping Board ownership until she was abandoned due to age and deterioration in 1931 or 1932.

John J. Mooney

John J. Mooney (born c. 1929) is an American chemical engineer who was co-inventor of the three-way catalytic converter, which has played a dramatic role in reducing pollution from motor vehicles since their introduction in the mid-1970s.
Early life and education.
Mooney grew up in Paterson, New Jersey, where he attended St. Georges Grammar School and then St. Joseph's High School, graduating in 1947. After graduating from high school, Mooney spent ten years working for the Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&G) while attending Seton Hall University, where he completed his Bachelor of Science degree in 1955.
He spent the next few years with the United States Army and he returned to school to Newark College of Engineering (now the New Jersey Institute of Technology), where he earned a Master of Science in Chemical Engineering in 1960. 
Mooney also earned an MBA in marketing from Fairleigh Dickinson University in 1992 while working at Engelhard.
Mooney was awarded an honorary "Doctor of Science" degree ("honoris causis") in 2007 by his "alma mater" New Jersey Institute of Technology for his outstanding achievements in the fields of environmental protection and automotive engineering.
Career.
While serving in the United States Army from 1955 to 1956, Mooney was assigned to a series of nuclear tests in the Pacific Ocean at Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands, which included 17 atom bomb and two hydrogen bomb tests. Mooney was as close as 7½ miles from fission bomb tests.
Mooney came to Engelhard in 1960, after graduate school, as a result of a connection made in an electrochemical engineering course. He worked at the company's Gas Equipment Division. Among his first tasks there were purification of hydrogen, purification and catalysis of ammonia into hydrogen and nitrogen and a process for using a ruthenium catalyst to produce hydrogen from liquid ammonia for the United States Air Force. As a result, the Air Force was able to easily supply hydrogen for weather balloons, since it was more efficient to ship liquid ammonia to distant locations than cylinders of gas.
The 1970 amendments to the Clean Air Act required significant reductions in hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide emissions. The converters available at the time were oxidation catalysts, which could handle hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide, but were ineffective in reducing nitrogen oxides. Car manufacturers and catalyst companies were trying to develop a multiple step process that would address hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide in one process while reducing nitrogen oxides in another. 
Chemist Carl D. Keith and Mooney with their team at Engelhard came up with the first production catalytic converter in 1973. The three-way catalyst developed by them allowed all three exhaust pollutants (hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides) to be remedied using a single catalyst bed. Their solution to addressing the variations in air / fuel mixtures was to combine rare earth oxides and base metal oxide components in the catalyst together with Platinum and Rhodium in a ceramic honeycomb with tiny passages coated with the catalytic material. This design ensured that the oxygen needed in the reactions was absorbed when it was in excess and released when it was needed, allowing all three pollutants to be removed in a single catalytic component. The three-way catalytic converter reduces nitrogen oxides to nitrogen and oxygen, oxidizes carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide and oxidizes unburnt hydrocarbons to carbon dioxide and water.
Accomplishments.
Mooney was elected a Fellow of Society of Automotive Engineers(SAE) in 1990 for his efforts in exhaust emission control.
In 2001, Keith and Mooney received the Walter Ahlstrom Prize, awarded in conjunction with the Finnish Academies of Technology, for their work in inventing and commercializing the three-way catalytic converter. Estimates were that by the time the award was received, the converters developed by Keith were installed in 80% of new cars manufactured worldwide and had prevented 56 million tons of hydrocarbons, 118 million tons of nitrogen oxides and 464 billion tons of carbon monoxide from being emitted as pollution in the 25 years since their introduction.
Together with Keith, Mooney was honored by the United States Patent and Trademark Office with the 2002 National Medal of Technology, awarded "For the invention, application to automobiles, and commercialization of the three-way catalytic converter. Through their persistent efforts, this technology is the key emission-control component in all new light-duty vehicles in the United States and throughout the world."
Mooney was awarded a total of 17 patents, the latest being one for a catalytic converter for the small two-stroke engines, used in chainsaws, lawn mowers and leaf blowers. His invention reduced hydrocarbon emissions by as much as 70%, improved fuel efficiency and added up to 40% more power, while addressing the pollution of an engine that often produces large amounts of pollution due to the lubricating oil mixed with the fuel.
As President of the Environmental and Energy Technology and Policy Institute, Mooney has worked with the Partnership for Clean Fuels and Vehicles of the United Nations Environment Programme to help end the use of leaded gasoline throughout the world. As of 2002, there were 51 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa in which leaded gasoline was still in use. By responding to issues of valve seat recession, and showing that lead in gasoline did not help solve the problem, Mooney was part of an effort that had 50 of these 51 countries in Africa ban leaded gasoline by the end of 2006.
Retirement.
He retired from Engelhard in 2003, having spent 43 years working for the firm.
Mooney has been a resident of Wyckoff, New Jersey.

Awhitu Wind Farm

The Awhitu Wind Farm is a renewable energy project in New Zealand planned by TrustPower. This development is proposed to be located on the Awhitu Peninsula near Waiuku on the west coast south of Auckland. TrustPower has announced intentions to begin construction later in 2012.
History.
The project was initially developed by Genesis Energy with plans for up to 18 wind turbines with a capacity of up to 25 MW. Maximum height to the tip of the blades was 90m.
In 2004, the wind farm received carbon credits from the New Zealand government, under a scheme to promote renewable energy for electricity generation. However, local councils denied the application for resource consents. This project is notable in being one of the few power projects to be denied resource consents.
Genesis Energy appealed to the Environment Court, which, in 2005, granted the resource consents, overturning the decision of the local councils. This decision is considered to be important is setting a precedent in how the benefits of the use and development of renewable energy should be considered in an RMA context. For example, this was cited in the decision on the Makara Wind Farm in 2005.
Genesis subsequently sold development rights to a landowner, who approached TrustPower to progress the project.

Nao Oikawa

Life and career.
Nao Oikawa was born in Hiroshima, Japan on April 21, 1981. Her family moved to Tokyo when she was a little girl. At age 18, when she graduated from high school and began design school, she met a scout who proposed she become an AV idol. "That time, my hair was bleached and curly. My agency told me to get my hair back to straight black. One day in the office, one staff picked Oikawa as family name from a book, another staff picked Nao from another book. This is where my stage name came from."
AV career.
Oikawa's debut was not easy. AV producers did not think that she had special talent in their genre. She used her time for studying popular porn stars' acting (especially, she learned many things from Kurumi Morishita).
Finally, Oikawa made her debut adult video at age nineteen for the Media Station Cosmos Plan label in September 2000. Then she released some videos from Alice Japan, Momotaro, etc., but she could not get big success. In her first year of adult work, she made only a few videos, includung a softcore V-Cinema movie, "Virgin Teacher Hinako" in September 2001.
In Spring 2002, Oikawa began an association with the new KMP Million label, most of them under the direction of Goro Tameike. She said that Tameike showed her the way to go. Her first video with KMP and Tameike, "Another Side of Nao Oikawa", involved anal sex and forced fellatio. One of her male partners is famed porn actor Taka Kato About same time, she began to work with Soft On Demand and Moodyz which produced her most popular AV works. More than half of her AV work are produced in 2002.
In Spring 2003, Oikawa signed exclusive contract with KMP which continued until her retirement. Together with Ran Monbu, Saori Kamiya and Hitomi Hayasaka, she was part of the exclusive group of actresses that KMP used for promotion under the name . "Another Side of Nao Oikawa 2", was even more hardcore with lesbian strap-on sex, forced fellatio and vomiting, multiple partner fellatio and vibrator play. Once again Taka Kato takes part in the action. On a gentler note, Oikawa appeared with Kurumi Morishita in a June 2003 production by KMP entitled "Forest in Nude". Directed by TOHJIRO, this lesbian genre video is a "soft, bittersweet story of two friends who remember the days of their youth and the sexual experiences they had".
At her peak, Oikawa was one of the most popular and well-known AV Idols in Japan. In 2003 (the earliest date available) she was #1 in the DMM list of the 100 top-ranked actresses by sales on their website. In 2004, even though she had retired in mid-year, she was still ranked #2, and even in 2005 she made the top 50 at #42. There have since been numerous re-issues and compilations of her earlier videos.
Oikawa, along with fellow AV actress Mariko Kawana, actor Taka Kato, director Goro Tameike and Soft On Demand founder Ganari Takahashi, was among the 17 people interviewed for Misato Nakayama's study of professionals in the adult industry, , published in January 2006 by Ohzora (ISBN 4-7767-9229-X).
Actress and TV personality.
Like AV idols Nana Natsume and Sora Aoi, Oikawa has been able to use her fame in the AV industry to enter mainstream media work. Soon after her retirement from adult videos, she acted in and directed an episode of the Japanese TV horror series "Fantazuma: Cursed House" or "Fantazuma: Noroi no yakata" (ファンタズマ〜呪いの館〜) which aired on TV Tokyo in July 2004. She also played a role in the 2004 comedy-horror TV series directed by Takashi Shimizu on TV Tokyo.
From 2005 to 2006, Oikawa appeared on various midnight TV show including "Ikari Oyaji 3".
On November 11, 2005 Oikawa made a guest appearance in the 6th episode of "GARO". It was her first appearance on Tokusatsu sfx series. "GARO"'s action director Makoto Yokoyama says Oikawa's supple body is suitable to sfx action.
On November 9, 2007 she made a guest appearance in the 6th episode of Tsuburaya Productions mini-series "Ultraseven X".　Oikawa was cast as Negi's advisor "Shizuna Minamoto" in the 2007-08 late-night TV Tokyo series "" based on the manga of the same name about a young male wizard from Wales (Negi, played by a 13-year old girl) and his 31 female students.
Not same as above are all midnight dramas, Oikawa played the role of villainess Kegalesia in the TV Asahi tokusatsu TV series for kids "Engine Sentai Go-onger" which ran from February 17, 2008, through February 8, 2009. In the September 21, 2008 episode, Oikawa and her co-stars Rina Aizawa and Yumi Sugimoto teamed up as the one-off G3 Princess singing group, releasing both an EP and a CD box set featuring the group's song "G3 Princess Rap ~Pretty Love Limited~" and Oikawa's solo character song "Utopia". She also appeared in the "Kamen Rider Decade" epilogue portion of the December 2009 film "" as the Bee Woman of Shocker.
From November to December 2007 Oikawa performed her first lead stage role in a three-person drama called "Night Mess". In September 2010 she will take a roll in a vampire drama called "Blood Prisoner". Some staff members and actors in both dramas are tokusatsu specialists.
Oikawa's family enjoys playing Mahjong as a recreational activity. As a result, she has over 20 years' experience playing the game. Using this experience, she frequently appears in Mahjong related V-Cinemas, TV shows, and various events.
Personal life.
Oikawa's hobbies are cooking, horseback riding and walking. According to her blog, she moves around Tokyo mainly by the Yamanote Line (loop train) and by Louis Garneau bicycle. She travels to Kyoto every year to visit Kurumazaki shrine, where the goddess of public entertainment is enshrined.
When Oikawa was an AV idol, she often accessed AV maker's BBS to interact with fans, and performed "sign and handshake" events frequently. After her retirement from AV, she started writing a blog (since September 2005), Twitter (since June 2010), and appeared on various talk shows that were streamed over the internet. Using these direct communication channels, Oikawa frankly talks about her work, personal life, friends, family, love, and other such things. Unlike porn stars of the 20th century, there is no strange behavior or special incident in her daily life. Currently, she lives with two cats (Scottish fold) and hopes to get married and become a mother in the future. Her dream is to own a "koryori-ya" (small Japanese restaurant bar).

MicroVAX 78032

The MicroVAX 78032 (otherwise known as the DC333) is a microprocessor developed and fabricated by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) that implemented a subset of the VAX instruction set architecture (ISA). The 78032 was used exclusively in DEC's VAX-based systems, starting with the MicroVAX II in 1985. When clocked at a frequency of 5 MHz, the 78032's integer performance is comparable to the VAX-11/780 superminicomputer, which was introduced on 25 October 1977. The microprocessor could be paired with the MicroVAX 78132 floating point accelerator for improved floating point performance.
The 78032 represented a number of firsts for DEC. It was DEC's first single-chip microprocessor implementation of the VAX ISA and DEC's first self-fabricated microprocessor. The MicroVAX 78032 is also notable as it was the first semiconductor device to be registered for protection under the Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984.
The MicroVAX 78032 contains 125,000 transistors on a 8.7 by 8.6 mm (74.82 mm2) die that was fabricated in DEC's ZMOS process, a 3.0 µm NMOS logic process with two layers of aluminum interconnect. The die is packaged in a 68-pin surface-mounted leaded chip carrier.
MicroVAX 78132.
The MicroVAX 78132 (otherwise known as the DC337) is a floating-point coprocessor for the MicroVAX 78032 microprocessor. It interfaces to the MicroVAX 78032 via the DAL bus and a few control lines. The MicroVAX 78132 was responsible for executing 61 out of 70 floating-point instructions defined by the MicroVAX subset of the VAX ISA and accelerates nine integer instructions.
The MicroVAX 78132 has a 100 ns microcycle divided into four 25 ns clock phases which is generated by a 40 MHz input clock. It was composed of five "elements": a 67-bit fraction processor, a 13-bit exponent processor, a 1-bit sign processor, a microsequencer and a bus interface unit.
The MicroVAX 78132 contained 32,141 transistors on a die measuring 8.4 mm by 6.6 mm (55.44 mm2). It was fabricated in DEC's ZMOS process, a 3.0 µm NMOS process with two layers of aluminum interconnect; and is packaged in a 68-pin surface-mounted leaded chip carrier.

Lyman Linde

Lyman Gilbert Linde (September 30, 1920 – October 24, 1995) was an American right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball who played for the Cleveland Indians in the American League for two seasons. In four career games, Linde pitched 10⅔ innings and had a 6.75 earned run average (ERA).
Born and raised in Wisconsin, Linde first played professionally with the Green Bay Bluejays. After a season with them, he enlisted in the armed forces for World War II, and joined the Greenville Spinners upon his return to baseball. During the next two seasons he spent some time with the Cleveland Indians, but mainly remained with the Indians' minor league teams. After a year each in Oklahoma City, Baltimore, and San Diego, he spent the last four years of his career pitching for the Portland Beavers. He retired at the end of the 1953 season and died in 1995.
Early life.
Linde attended high school at Beaver Dam High School in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. While there, he played basketball as well as baseball, and was part of the state champion Beaver Dam High School basketball team in 1937. After graduating, he played amateur baseball in Wisconsin for several years. In a state amateur baseball tournament in 1941, Linde, representing the Beaver Dam Beavers, pitched a one-hitter to help lead his team to a 9–1 win over the representatives from Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin. Linde attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison on and off between 1939 and 1947.
Minor leagues.
Linde's first taste of minor league action came in 1942, when he signed with the Green Bay Bluejays of the Wisconsin State League. His performances that season included a near-no-hitter that was lost in the ninth inning in a 5–2 victory over the Fond du Lac Panthers. Linde was also given the most valuable player award for a week in July after a pitching performance, also against Fond du Lac, in which he struck out 14 batters in a 5–0 shutout victory. He finished the season with 13 wins, eight losses, and a 2.91 ERA in 22 pitching appearances. After the season ended, the league folded temporarily, and Linde enlisted with the United States Army Air Forces to serve in World War II.
After returning from military service, Linde joined the Greenville Spinners, the Chicago White Sox minor league affiliate of the Sally League. He tried out for the Milwaukee Brewers, but was unable to make the team, and as a result was sent to Greenville to gain experience. Linde pitched in 29 games for the Spinners. In those 29 games, he had ten wins, eight losses, a 3.50 ERA, and 121 innings pitched. After the conclusion of the season, in early November, Linde was drafted by the Cleveland Indians in the rule 5 draft.
The following season, Linde pitched for the Oklahoma City Indians, the Indians minor league affiliate of the Texas League. He spent most of the season with Oklahoma City, and in a pitching appearance in August, threw a no-hitter and narrowly missed pitching a perfect game. In 32 appearances for Oklahoma City, Linde won 14 games, lost 13, and had an ERA of 2.85 in 202 innings pitched. At the end of the minor league season, Linde was called up to the Indians' major league roster along with Ernest Groth in order to build up the end of the bullpen.
Cleveland Indians and Portland.
Linde made his major league debut with the Indians on September 11, 1947, which ended up being his only appearance of the season. In that one appearance, he pitched ⅔ of an inning and allowed two earned run, finishing the game and season with an ERA of 27.00. During the off-season, Linde played basketball with the Olo Soaps, a team located in his native Beaver Dam. He took part in spring training with the rest of the Indians roster for the 1948 Cleveland Indians season. In late March, however, he was struck on the chin from a line drive hit by Indians manager Lou Boudreau, causing him to be sidelined for several days. By the end of spring training, Linde remained a part of the Indians roster. He pitched three games for the Indians early on in 1948, pitching ten innings, allowing six earned runs and finishing the season with a 5.40 ERA. After three games, he was demoted to the Baltimore Orioles of the International League. He spent the rest of the 1948 season as a starting pitcher for Baltimore. His performances included a one-hit victory in his first appearance for the club. Linde finished the season with a 5–9 record and a 4.50 ERA. 
Linde spent 1949 with the San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League (PCL). He tried to earn a spot with the Indians during spring training but was unable to. He spent the season as a starting pitcher for San Diego, and threw three shutouts over the course of the season, allowing only three hits to the Los Angeles Angels in his third one. He finished the season with a 14–15 record in 35 pitching appearances (32 starts), a 4.41 ERA, 105 strikeouts, and 226⅓ innings pitched. He brought the Padres to the playoffs, and pitched in game six of the championship against the Hollywood Stars, where he earned the 8–4 loss as the Stars won the PCL pennant and the Governors' Cup.
At the start of the 1950 season, Linde signed a new contract with the Indians, but was released in February and sent to the Portland Beavers in the PCL. Over the course of the season, Linde won 5 games and lost 13 in 47 appearances, 18 of them starts, and amassed an ERA of 4.66. The following year, in 1951, Linde became a regular starter on the team, and before the end of April he had won as many games as he had won all of last year. He finished the season with a 12–12 record and a 4.29 ERA in 32 starts. In 1952, Linde remained part of the core starting rotation of the past couple years alongside Red Adams and Marino Pieretti. His performances included one against the Angels in which Linde kept the team to five hits as the Beavers won 4–3 in 11 innings. He won 11 games, lost 15, threw 119 strikeouts, and brought his ERA down to 3.10 in 41 season appearances, 28 of them starts. In 1953, Linde started the season strong unlike his fellow pitchers, opening his season with a 2–1 victory against the Angels on April 3. In early May, he ended Ted Beard's streak of hitting safely in 12 straight at-bats, which tied the PCL record at the time. Shortly afterward, Linde won what was considered an odd performance as he allowed 15 hits and 20 runners on base, yet won a game against the Sacramento Solons 8–3. In his final professional season, Linde pitched in 36 games and finished with a 13–10 record and a 3.36 ERA.
Later life.
After the 1953 season, Linde retired from baseball to tend to his wife, who was seriously ill. He died in Beaver Dam on October 24, 1995.

Rigel (microprocessor)

Rigel was a microprocessor chip set developed and fabricated by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) that implemented the VAX instruction set architecture (ISA). It was introduced on 11 July 1989 with the introduction of the VAX 6000 Model 400, the first system to feature the chip set. Rigel was also used in the VAX 4000 Model 300 and VAXstation 3100 Model 76. Production Rigel CPUs were rated at 35 to 43 MHz.
The Rigel chipset consisted of several devices:
In addition, two further devices implemented the VAX vector processor option; these comprised the DC555 Vector Register set chip ("VERSE") and the DC556 Vector Data Path chip ("FAVOR").
Support chips for Rigel-based systems included the RSSC (Rigel System Support Chip) and "Ghidra", the VAX 4000 system interface chip.
REX520.
The Rigel architecture was based on the VAX 8800 processor. It has a six-stage microinstruction pipeline and 64-entry fully associative translation look-aside buffer. The Rigel chip set supported an optional vector processor and the REX520 decoded any vector instructions and passed on to the vector interface (VC) chip by the REX520.
The REX520 has a 2 KB unified primary cache, configurable as an instruction cache and an external 128 KB secondary cache (backup cache) implemented with CMOS static random access memory (SRAM) chips. The REX520 has an external cache because the VAX 8800's 64 KB primary cache could not be integrated on the same die. The backup cache controller was located on the VC chip.
The REX520 consisted of 320,000 transistors, of which 140,000 are for logic and 180,000 for memory. The die measures 12 mm by 12 mm (144 mm²). It was packaged in a 224-lead ceramic leaded package.
Fabrication.
The chip set was fabricated by DEC in their second-generation complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) process, CMOS-2. The process had a 1.5 µm minimum feature size and two levels of aluminium interconnect.
Mariah.
Mariah was a revised version of the Rigel chip set fabricated by DEC in their 1 µm CMOS-3 process, with higher clock frequencies between 62 to 71 MHz. The Mariah CPU, FPU and cache controller were designated DC595, DC596 and DC597 respectively. Enhancements over Rigel included a 4 kB first-level cache and 32-bit physical memory addressing in the Mariah CPU, and write-back caching implemented in the cache controller chip. Mariah was used in the VAX 6000 Model 500, MicroVAX 3100 Model 80 and VAXstation 4000 Model 60.

Smoke-developed index

Smoke-developed index (abbreviated SDI) is a measure of the concentration of smoke a material emits as it burns. Like Flame Spread Index, it is based on an arbitrary scale in which asbestos-cement board has a value of 0, and red oak wood has 100. The SDI is measured using a horizontal test specimen, according to the Steiner tunnel test protocol. 
The ASTM standard E84 defines a standard test method for surface flame spread and smoke density measurements. A smoke-developed index between 0 and 450 is required by IBC section 803.1 for interior wall and ceiling finishes classes A, B and C.

Around the World with Auntie Mame

Around the World with Auntie Mame (1958) is a novel by Patrick Dennis and sequel to his bestseller "Auntie Mame".
Plot.
Narrator "Patrick" is seventeen, and has left his private prep school. His Auntie Mame takes him with her on an extended tour of Europe, which becomes a round-the-world tour before his enrollment in college. They have adventures in Paris, London, Biarritz, Venice, Austria, Russia, Lebanon, and the high seas, meeting and dealing with British nobles, con men, embarrassing relatives, Nazis, and gunrunners before they arrive home again. Much of the action is a slyly satirical commentary on such things as the practice of "presenting at Court," fashionable political activism, the naivete of some Americans abroad, and the ways in which small communities of expatriates often end up behaving. 
The main story is encased in a "frame" narrative, in which Patrick, now grown and married, tries to placate his wife with highly edited tales from his travels with his aunt. This takes up where the original novel, "Auntie Mame", left off, with Patrick's son Michael going off to India with Mame promising to have him home by Labor Day. Two years have passed, with no word beyond a few random post cards. Each chapter begins with Patrick's reassuring, off-hand comments about his journeys with Mame, and then continues with him narrating what really happened.
Critical reception.
Critical reception for the novel in 1958:
Dennis's novels fell out of fashion for many years, but his best sellers were reprinted in 2003, with forewords and other commentary by present-day humorists and the author's son. "Around The World With Auntie Mame" was reprinted with the restoration of a chapter that had been censored from the original edition. The chapter tells of Auntie Mame's and Patrick's time on a collective farm in the USSR. The publisher felt the chapter, however satirical, would not be acceptable coming, as the novel did, at the height of the Red Scare. The reprinted edition has sold well at Amazon.com, maintaining a four-and-a-half-out-of-five star rating.

Vampire Lovers (band)

The Vampire Lovers, also styled as Vampyre Lovers or Vampire Lovers, were a Brisbane punk rock group which formed in 1982 in Queensland, Australia. Original band members were Axle "Axe Babe" Conrad on vocals, Brendan Kibble on guitar, Shane Cooke on bass guitar, Matt "Nasty" Le Noury on guitar and Dave Chamberlain on drums. Other members included guitarist Jason Shepherd; and drummer, Ziggy Staten. Initially the group existed from 1982 to 1984 and then reformed in 1988 to disband finally in 1990. In 1983 their first single, "Buzzsaw Popstar", brought greater recognition from the Australia alternative rock fans. In 1991 they released a mini-LP, "Acid Commandos from Planet Fuzz", a year after they had disbanded.
According to music historian, Ian McFarlane, Brisbane produced "some of the most anarchistic bands of the Australian punk rock era" and that it was a city nationally renowned for its ultra conservatism. While British fanzine journalist, Hugh Gulland, felt they were "irmly rooted in The Damned / Misfits – horror punk axis" and suggested that their appeal extended to fans of garish apparel exemplified by "pink leopardskin". In a 1988 interview, the group described themselves as "Australia's only genuine death rock experience". Both Le Noury and Cooke were in Hitmen D.T.K. in Sydney during the early 1990s and recorded on some of that group's later work. In 2004, a retrospective compilation, "13 Tasteless Masterpieces", was issued by United Kingdom indie label, Magic Monster.
History.
1981–1984.
The Vampire Lovers were formed in 1981, after the demise of Brisbane punk rock group, The Flying Squad, (who featured Brendan Kibble and Shane Cooke) Initially with Axle "Axe Babe" Conrad on vocals, Brendan Kibble on vocals and guitar, and Shane Cooke on bass guitar. By 1982 they had enlisted other local musicians, Matt "Nasty" Le Noury on guitar and Dave Chamberlain on drums, to complete the original line up, but Kibble quit shortly after. The Vampire Lovers named themselves after the 1970 lesbian Hammer Horror movie, of the same name. According to music historian, Ian McFarlane, Brisbane produced "some of the most anarchistic bands of the Australian punk rock era" and that it was a city nationally renowned for its ultra conservatism. Vocalist Axle Conrad suggested to Steve Bell from Time Off magazine that "You were certainly targeted if you looked different in any way. Wearing those clothes was like a badge of honour - the more you looked out there, the more gang you were, the more you perpetuated the 'us versus them' vibe."
Ian Mc.Farlane regarded the group as "a third-generation garage punk outfit". British fanzine, "Bucketfull of Brains"s journalist, Hugh Gulland, felt they were "rooted in The Damned / Misfits – horror punk axis" and suggested that their appeal extended to fans of garish apparel exemplified by "pink leopardskin". The Vampire Lovers' fixation on unusual or camp horror movies, high powered motorcycles, underground street scenes and characters were expressed in their lyrical themes. Generally written by Conrad, Cooke and Le Noury (Nasty) their tracks include: "Heavy Planet Fuzz", "Death Dwarf", "Drink My Blood, Suck My Veins" and "Second Generation Psychopath". A review by The Barman of the website I-94 Bar, described them as "[four young, trash movie-obsessed reprobates", and Conrad himself said that the band were inspired by "movies like "Pink Flamingos", "Eraserhead" and "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"".
In 1983, the group released their first extended play, "Buzzsaw Popstar", on the Sundown label. "Buzzsaw Popstar", the lead track, received airplay on 4ZzZ, a local community radio station. This enabled the band to achieve greater recognition beyond their home state. Rob Younger (from Radio Birdman) declared it "a masterpiece". In 2004, former Australian Democrats senator, Andrew Bartlett, recalled "I used to be heavily involved in 4ZZZ in the 1980s ... I saw a guy who I’m sure used to be the singer in a band called The Vampire Lovers – they did a song called 'Buzzsaw Popstar' which still sounds good today". In July 1984, a second single, "Sweethearts Blown Mindless", followed and according to The Barman it evokes the "Raw Power"-era Stooges with a different drummer and Lux Interior of The Cramps instead of Iggy Pop. By the second half of 1984, the group fell apart as the local punk, post-punk movement disintegrated, "turning their back on stardom, the Vampire Lovers split in late '84, claiming to have been thwarted by 'creative differences'". The following year Le Noury on guitar and Cooke on bass guitar formed a Detroit rock-influenced group, The Four Horsemen, with Murray Shepherd (ex-Screaming Tribesmen and Fun Things) on drums and Nick Leigh (The Cimmerians) on vocals. Dave Chamberlain joined the Subsonic Barflies.
1987–1990.
In 1987, "Buzzsaw Popstar" was re-released, regained local popularity, and prompted the band to reform the following year. Conrad, Cooke and Le Noury recruited heavy metal musicians: Ziggy Staten on drums, and Jason Shepherd (younger brother of Murray Shepherd) on guitar. In November 1988 they released a single, "Heavy Planet Fuzz", for the Bent label. Brisbane's Time Off magazine analyzed the record by saying that "This third single sees the Vampire Lovers in deadly form, playing their characteristic blend of seventies garage and eighties hard edged rock and roll." In an interview, that same month, with Matthew Eaton of "The Courier-Mail", they described themselves as "Australia's only genuine death rock experience".
The group had relocated to Sydney and, during 1988, started recording an EP, "Weirdo Wastelands", for the United States indie label Hecuba Records, which was released the following year. Overseas signings were considered an unusual and rare achievement for Brisbane bands at the time. The songs were described by "Noise for Heroes" Steve Gardner as "some kind of out of control speed metal-hardcore hybrid ... Even when it sounds metally there's a lot more effort in playing and less in posing than most metal bands, so the judges' scores are going to be pretty good on this one". A final line up change occurred in 1988 when Le Noury left to join Hitmen D.T.K.. The remaining members recorded a mini-LP, "Acid Commandos from Planet Fuzz", but disbanded in 1990 before its release. Cooke joined Le Noury in Hitmen DTK. In 1991 the posthumous work, "Acid Commandos from Planet Fuzz", was released on Schlock Records.
Legacy.
In the mid-1980s The Vampire Lovers gained international recognition when Jello Biafra of US hardcore punk outfit Dead Kennedys promoted "Buzzsaw Popstar" on college radio stations. McFarlane declared "espite their intermittent break-ups and infrequent gigs, The Vampire Lovers have enjoyed a cult status all the same". In October 2004 a retrospective compilation album, "13 Tasteless Masterpieces", was issued by United Kingdom indie label, Magic Monster.
Another single was released in 2009 featuring live versions of their songs "Buzzsaw Popstar" and "Death Dwarf" originally recorded in 1988. According to I-94 Bar's The Barman, 'This in-your-face version of the single holds up well. "Death Dwarf" is a break-neck Ramone-ic derivation that lives off a spiky guitar figure. Nasty and nice. It all sounds live and unpolished but that won't worry fans.

Ernest Groth

Ernest William Groth (May 3, 1922 – December 27, 2004) was an American Major League Baseball right-handed pitcher who played for three seasons. He played for the Cleveland Indians during the 1947 and 1948 seasons and the Chicago White Sox during the 1949 season. In four career games, Groth pitched 7⅓ innings and had a 4.91 earned run average (ERA).
Born and raised in Pennsylvania, Groth began his professional career in the Wisconsin State League in 1942. After his rookie season, he spent the next three years serving in the military during World War II. After he returned, he spent more time in the minor leagues, then spent parts of the 1947 and 1948 seasons with the Cleveland Indians. After the end of the 1948 season, he was traded to the Chicago White Sox, and played with them in 1949. He spent the next seven seasons pitching in the minor leagues, retiring at the end of the 1956 season. After his retirement, he ran Groth's Nursery and worked for Standard Steel, and died in 2004.
Early life and minor leagues.
Groth was born in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania to William T. and Clara Court Groth. He played American Legion Baseball in East Palestine, Ohio in his teens, and attended Beaver Falls High School. He grew up pitching in the county league, and was both a right fielder and pitcher for the Chippewa Indians. After pitching for Chippewa in 1941, he was offered a contract for the 1942 season by the Pittsburgh Pirates. Groth turned down the offer instead signing with the Cleveland Indians, spending the 1942 season with the Indians' D-Class (rookie league) affiliate, the Appleton Papermakers of the Wisconsin State League, where he played alongside future teammate Mike Garcia. In 26 games, he pitched in 203 innings, had a 16–10 win–loss record and a 3.59 ERA.
After the 1942 season, Groth spent the following three years serving with the United States Army in the Pacific Theater of Operations during World War II. After the war, he returned to baseball, spending the 1946 season with the Wilkes-Barre Barons, a Cleveland Indians minor league team that played in the Eastern League. His performances that season included a one-hitter against the Elmira Pioneers in the second game of a doubleheader on August 19. In 29 games, Groth finished with a 13–7 ecord and a 2.98 ERA. Shortly afterward, he became engaged to Blanche Klein, a fellow graduate of Beaver Falls High. The two were married shortly after.
Cleveland Indians and Chicago White Sox.
In 1947, Groth was promoted to the Oklahoma City Indians of the Texas League, the Cleveland Indians' AA-class minor league affiliate. In 33 games with Oklahoma City, he threw 180 innings and finished the season with a 7–11 record and a 3.45 ERA. After the minor league season ended in September, Groth was called up to the Cleveland Indians major league roster, and made his debut on September 11, 1947. He pitched in one more game, finishing the season having pitched 1⅓ innings, striking out one batter and not allowing a run.
Groth was looking to stay in the major league in 1948. He spent spring training on the Indians' roster, and originally made a great impression on the team. However, he was one of seven Indians stricken with dysentery in early April, causing him to miss some time. By the end of spring training, Groth was optioned to the Baltimore Orioles of the International League, the Indians' AAA-class minor league affiliate. He spent the season with the Orioles, and his pitching performances included a 13–0 victory over the Newark Bears, as well as a 1–0 victory where Groth limited the Bears to three hits. Groth finished the season with Baltimore having amassed 29 pitching appearances, 27 of them starts, a 12–12 record and a 4.48 ERA, while also pitching in two games for the Dallas Eagles. After Baltimore's season ended, he was promoted to the Indians' roster, and pitched in one game for the Indians that season.
At the end of the 1948 season, on December 2, the Indians traded Groth to the Chicago White Sox along with Bob Kuzava for Frank Papish. After signing a contract with the White Sox, Groth took part in spring, training alongside many other newcomers to the White Sox, where his pitching performance earned him a place on the major league roster. He pitched in three games for the White Sox, losing one, and finished his tenure with the White Sox with a 5.40 ERA in five innings pitched. After his final game on May 4, the White Sox purchased Ed Klieman and sold Groth to the Kansas City Blues, a New York Yankees minor league team, ending his major league career.
Return to minor leagues.
Groth spent the 1949 season with the Kansas City Blues, finishing with a 12–9 record, a 4.28 ERA, and 162 innings pitched. When the 1950 season began, the New York Yankees had five holdouts (players who wanted more money and would not sign their contracts). Groth was one of them, and was the only minor leaguer to hold out. He eventually signed his contract with Kansas City, and after spring training ended, Groth was sent to the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League, the Yankees' AAA minor league affiliate. The Yankees sent Groth to the Oaks to make up for sending over George Earl Toolson last season, who the Oaks had to return because his condition was poor. Groth finished the season with a 7–11 record and a 5.09 ERA. In January 1951, the Oaks sold Groth to the Baltimore Orioles of the International League, now a farm team of the Philadelphia Phillies. He struggled in ten appearances, finishing with an ERA of 7.58, and was sent to the Chattanooga Lookouts, the AA minor league team of the Washington Senators. He pitched in 26 games for the Lookouts, finishing with a 3–8 record and a 6.29 ERA. 
For the next five seasons, Groth played for the Oklahoma City Indians of the Texas League. He was sold to Oklahoma City by Baltimore in December 1951. In his first season with Oklahoma City, he finished with a 15–12 record, a 3.43 ERA, and 207 innings pitched. The following season, Groth started things off with a victory in an early appearance against the Dallas Eagles where he allowed only four hits. He finished the season with an 8–8 record and a 5.37 ERA. In 1954, Groth improved his pitching, finishing the season with a 14–11 record and a 3.75 ERA. After a 9–13 season in 1955, Groth split time between Oklahoma City and the Tulsa Oilers in 1956, finishing the season with a combined 9–16 record. He ended his professional career after the 1956 season.
Later life.
After retiring from baseball, Groth returned to his hometown of Beaver Falls. He and his family ran Groth's Nursery, and he worked for Standard Steel until his retirement. He and his wife had three daughters; Elizabeth, Constance, and Suellen. Groth was inducted into the Beaver County Sports Hall of Fame in 1990. He also spent time playing in local golf tournaments. Groth died on December 27, 2004.

Born in Cairns, Queensland, he was educated at state schools before serving in the military 1942-1947. He returned to become a grazier at Longreach. In 1967, he was elected to the Australian Senate as a Country Party Senator for Queensland. He held the seat until his defeat at the 1980 election, taking effect in 1981.
One of his most notable moments was his involvement in what became known as "The Night of the Long Prawns", in April 1974. He regularly brought a batch of prawns from his home base in Townsville to share with his parliamentary colleagues in Canberra, and on that night he used this generosity as a ruse to keep DLP Senator Vince Gair entertained in his office all night, thus delaying Gair's resignation from the Senate in order to take up an appointment as Ambassador to Ireland, which had been offered to him by the Whitlam Labor government as a strategy to increase Labor's numbers in the Senate. The timing was crucial, as the non-Labor forces were aware that the Queensland Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen was that very night arranging to issue writs for 5 Queensland senators for the forthcoming half-Senate election, but if Gair had resigned first, writs for 6 senators would have been required, thus improving Labor's chances. In the end, Whitlam decided to call a double dissolution instead of the half-Senate election he had previously announced; all seats in the parliament were up for re-election, and the Gair Affair became irrelevant.

Jay Washington

Anthony Jay Washington, better known as Jay Washington (born November 10, 1981 in Zambales, Philippines) is a Filipino-American professional basketball player in the Philippine Basketball Association for the GlobalPort Batang Pier.
College career.
Washington played for the Eckerd College Tritons during his college career. In 2002, he had per-game averages of 20.5 pts (on 0.359 3PT shooting) and 3.9 rebs in 32 games. He then raised his averages to 21.7 pts and 5.5 rebs in 32 games the next season. For his senior season, Washington was named to the Sunshine State Conference All Tournament Team. Washington also suited up for the Gwinnett Grizzlies at the 2004 LA Summer Pro League.
Professional career.
Washington was selected 1st overall draft pick in 2005 by the Welcoat Paintmasters and was traded to the Talk 'N Text Phone Pals during draft day. Despite putting good numbers, high expectations and the deep rotation of Talk 'N Text led him to being traded to the San Miguel Beermen in 2008 in exchange for the draft rights of 2008 3rd Overall Pick Jayson Castro. During the 2010 PBA Fiesta Conference, he was awarded the Best Player of the Conference. He is a three time Mythical First Team Awardee in the PBA. He was then awarded another Best Player of the Conference Award during Game 4 of the 2010-11 PBA Philippine Cup Finals.
Washington's playing position as Small Forward / Power Forward poses problems to his defenders. With everything in his arsenal, he puts up good numbers on the floor. This led to his first back to back PBA Best Player of the Conference (BPC) award (2009–2010, 2010–2011). He averaged 25.6 points, 9.8 rebounds, 2.5 assists and 1.4 blocked shots in his second win putting him in the company of former MVP’s Vergel Meneses, Danny Ildefonso and Eric Menk.
The three previous winners won theirs in their MVP seasons. Meneses won the citation three straight times from 1994–95, Ildefonso five straight from 2000–01 and Menk 2004-05.

Marc Pingris

Jean Marc Pingris, Jr. (born October 16, 1981) is a Filipino professional basketball player in the PBA for the San Mig Super Coffee Mixers. He is a versatile 6-foot-5 forward-center who can post up, shoot mid-range jumpers, and block shots. He is married to actress Danica Sotto, daughter of Vic Sotto and Dina Bonnevie. They have three children, a son named Jean Michael, cousin named Elaine Rose Rioveros Valenzuela and a daughter named Anielle Micaela.
Born in Pozorrubio, Pangasinan, Philippines, Pingris started his career in the PBA at the 2004 PBA Draft which featured James Yap, Gary David, Ranidel de Ocampo, Rich Alvarez and Nelbert Omolon. Pingris was drafted by the FedEx Express with the 3rd overall pick, but was quickly traded to the Purefoods TJ Hotdogs along with Egay Billones. It is with Purefoods that Pingris established his reputation as perhaps the best defender in the PBA today.
Early and personal life.
Marc Pingris was born on October 16, 1981 to Jean Marc Pingris, Sr., and Erlinda Prado. Pingris idolized MJ. After his classes, he would study his lessons and do his homeworks then go to their barangay court to practice his "Jordan" like skills in basketball. When he has no classes he would call up his friends and play basketball in other barangays. In High school, Pingris tried to play in their school try-outs but he was not accepted, but when he was in 2nd year he was finally accepted to their school's Varsity Team. During his collegiate years, he would go play for the varsity basketball team of the Philippine School of Business Administration. However, he started his career at the Far Eastern University, Manila where he was formally discovered.
He also played for the Cebu Gems in Metropolitan Basketball Association.
In 2007, Pingris married actress Danica Sotto, daughter of famous actors Vic Sotto and Dina Bonnevie.
Air21.
Pingris was selected by the Air21 Express with the 3rd overall pick in the 2004 PBA Draft. The draft also featured two of his future teammates, Yap and Artadi from UE.
Pingris played a few games with Air21 prior to the trade that sent him to the Purefoods TJ Hotdogs.
Purefoods.
He was traded to Purefoods after having played a few games with the Express. He was traded along with Egay Billones. In the 2005-06 PBA season, he was awarded with the Finals MVP in the 2006 PBA Philippine Cup as Purefoods defeated Red Bull, 4-2. In Game 2 of the Finals of the 2006 season, he scored 21 points to lead Purefoods to a 93-82 win. In the 2007-08 PBA Philippine Cup Finals, he grabbed a career-high 21 rebounds, leading to his new nickname, "The Rebounding Demon".
Magnolia/San Miguel.
When Purefoods center Rommel Adducul was diagnosed with nasopharynx cancer, Pingris was shipped to the Magnolia Beverage Masters for center Enrico Villanueva at the start of the 2008 PBA Fiesta Conference.
Pingris played his first game for Magnolia as a starter, going up against his former team, Purefoods.
Pingris-Santos trade.
Before the 2009-2010 PBA season began, Pingris and Magnolia teammate Ken Bono were traded to the Burger King Whoppers for superstar Arwind Santos and San Miguel's (formerly Magnolia) 2010 first round pick.
In a Manila Bulletin interview, Burger King team owner Lito Alvarez further explained the trade: “The reason lang natagalan itong negotiation is we want a draft pick, not a player sa package because we already have 17 players including the three picks we’ll have in this Sunday’s Draft.”
Return to Purefoods / B-meg.
Barely 24 hours after being shipped to Burger King, Pingris was released to the Purefoods TJ Giants after Purefoods agreed to surrender its first and second round picks in 2010 to Burger King.
Pingris' return to Purefoods was confirmed by board governor Rene Pardo in an interview with GMANews.TV: "We have agreed to trade our first and second round picks next year to Burger King for Pingris."
Burger King Whoppers' board representative and then-incoming PBA chairman Lito Alvarez said that he felt that the trade was good for both teams, as Purefoods needed Pingris more, while the Whoppers planned to rebuild with their future draftees.
In the Llamados' second game during the 2012 PBA Commissioner's Cup, Pingris grabbed five rebounds, making him the 42nd member of the league's 1,000 Offensive Rebound Club.
For all his hardwork and contributions in B-Meg's 2012 PBA Commissioner's Cup championship run, Pingris was aptly nicknamed "Pinoy Sakuragi".

Gospel Music Network

The Gospel Music Network was a commercial Christian cable television station which launched in 1986 by Bill and Linda Airy. At the time, the Airy's owned a full-service advertising agency in Albuquerque, New Mexico. One of the agency's clients was Pepsi-Cola Bottling Group. In 1986, Pepsi-Cola was interested in reaching an African-American audience for its Mountain Dew product. Research indicated that gospel music was a possible area for Mountain Dew sponsorship. With no gospel music programming available nationwide on any existing network, the Airy's decided to launch a channel and Gospel Music Network (GMN) was born. A guiding tenet was that GMN would never ask for donations on-air but would rely on advertising sponsorships and license fees from distributors. 
Initially funded directly by the Airy's, GMN's format was similar to that of MTV, mostly featuring music videos. The network did not limit itself to particular styles of music, playing everything from southern and black gospel to the full spectrum of Contemporary Christian music. According to "CCM Magazine" it was the first network of its type. Later networks with similar programming include Z Music Television and the Gospel Music Channel.
After one year the channel had a viewership potential of two million people. In 1988, GMN was in negotiations for carriage with Tele-Communications, Inc. (TCI), a large cable MSO based in Englewood, CO. During those negotiations, TCI broached the issue of broadening GMN's line up to include programming from a wide variety of faith traditions - Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox, and Jewish. TCI was interested in having one faith-based channel that would eschew on-air fundraising and that would serve the entire faith community as opposed to a channel for each individual denomination. In 1989, the Airy's sold their advertising agency, moved their family to Denver, and Bill Airy began working for TCI as president of VISN Group, Inc., a new TCI subsidiary formed to merge GMN with the television programming efforts of the National Interfaith Cable Coalition (NICC), a coalition of various leaders from the mainline faith community loosely affiliated with the National Council of Churches. TCI agreed to underwrite the development of the new network (initially known as Vision Interfaith Satellite Network or VISN) which combined GMN with the programming available from NICC. 
Ultimately VISN became the Faith & Values Channel in the mid 1990s and was eventually acquired by the Hallmark Channel. By the time Z Music Television was founded in 1991 there was no dedicated outlet for Christian music videos.

<doc id="20234262" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20234262" title="Von Neumann paradox">
Von Neumann paradox

In mathematics, the von Neumann paradox, named after John von Neumann, is the idea that one can break a planar figure such as the unit square into sets of points and subject each set to an area-preserving affine transformation such that the result is two planar figures of the same size as the original. This was proved in 1929 by John von Neumann, assuming the axiom of choice. It is based on the earlier Banach–Tarski paradox which is in turn based on the Hausdorff paradox.
Banach and Tarski had proved that, using isometric transformations, the result of taking apart and reassembling a two-dimensional figure would necessarily have the same area as the original. This would make creating two unit squares out of one impossible. But von Neumann realized that the trick of such so-called paradoxical decompositions was the use of a group of transformations which include as a subgroup a free group with two generators. The group of area preserving transformations (whether the special linear group or the special affine group) contains such subgroups, and this opens the possibility of performing paradoxical decompositions using them.
Sketch of the method.
The following is an informal description of the method found by von Neumann. Assume that we have a free group "H" of area-preserving linear transformations generated by two transformations, σ and τ, which are not far from the identity element. Being a free group means that all the its elements can be expressed uniquely in the form formula_1 for some "n", where the formula_2s and formula_3s are all non-zero integers, except possibly the first formula_2 and the last formula_3. We can divide this group into two parts: those that start on the left with σ to some non-zero power (we call this set "A") and those that start with τ to some power (that is, formula_6 is zero—we call this set "B", and it includes the identity).
If we operate on any point in Euclidean 2-space by the various elements of "H" we get what is called the orbit of that point. All the points in the plane can thus be classed into orbits, of which there are an infinite number with the cardinality of the continuum. Using the axiom of choice, we can choose one point from each orbit and call the set of these points "M". We exclude the origin, which is a fixed point in "H". If we then operate on "M" by all the elements of "H", we generate each point of the plane (except the origin) exactly once. If we operate on "M" by all the elements of "A" or of "B", we get two disjoint sets whose union is all points but the origin.
Now we take some figure such as the unit square or the unit disk. We then choose another figure totally inside it, such as a smaller square, centred at the origin. We can cover the big figure with several copies of the small figure, albeit with some points covered by two or more copies. We can then assign each point of the big figure to one of the copies of the small figure. Let us call the sets corresponding to each copy formula_7. We shall now make a one-to-one mapping of each point in the big figure to a point in its interior, using only area-preserving transformations. We take the points belonging to formula_8 and translate them so that the centre of the formula_8 square is at the origin. We then take those points in it which are in the set "A" defined above and operate on them by the area-preserving operation σ τ. This puts them into set "B". We then take the points belonging to "B" and operate on them with σ2. They will now still be in "B", but the set of these points will be disjoint from the previous set. We proceed in this manner, using σ3τ on the "A" points from "C"2 (after centring it) and σ4 on its "B" points, and so on. In this way, we have mapped all points from the big figure (except some fixed points) in a one-to-one manner to "B" type points not too far from the centre, and within the big figure. We can then make a second mapping to "A" type points.
At this point we can apply the method of the Cantor-Bernstein-Schroeder theorem. This theorem tells us that if we have an injection from set "D" to set "E" (such as from the big figure to the "A" type points in it), and an injection from "E" to "D" (such as the identity mapping from the "A" type points in the figure to themselves), then there is a one-to-one correspondence between "D" and "E". In other words, having a mapping from the big figure to a subset of the "A" points in it, we can make a mapping (a bijection) from the big figure to "all" the "A" points in it. (In some regions points are mapped to themselves, in others they are mapped using the mapping described in the previous paragraph.) Likewise we can make a mapping from the big figure to all the "B" points in it. So looking at this the other way round, we can separate the figure into its "A" and "B" points, and then map each of these back into the whole figure (that is, containing both kinds of points)!
This sketch glosses over some things, such as how to handle fixed points. It turns out that it is necessary more mappings and more sets to work around this.
Consequences.
The paradox for the square can be strengthened as follows:
This has consequences concerning the problem of measure. As von Neumann notes,
To explain this a bit more, the question of whether a finitely additive measure exists, that is preserved under certain transformations, depends on what transformations are allowed. The Banach measure of sets in the plane, which is preserved by translations and rotations, is not preserved by non-isometric transformations even when they do preserve the area of polygons. As explained above, the points of the plane (other than the origin) can be divided into two dense sets which we may call "A" and "B". If the "A" points of a given polygon are transformed by a certain area-preserving transformation and the "B" points by another, both sets can become subsets of the "B" points in two new polygons. The new polygons have the same area as the old polygon, but the two transformed sets cannot have the same measure as before (since they contain only part of the "B" points), and therefore there is no measure that "works".
The class of groups isolated by von Neumann in the course of study of Banach–Tarski phenomenon turned out to be very important for many areas of mathematics: these are amenable groups, or groups with an invariant mean, and include all finite and all solvable groups. Generally speaking, paradoxical decompositions arise when the group used for equivalences in the definition of equidecomposability is "not" amenable.
Recent progress.
Von Neumann's paper left open the possibility of a paradoxical decomposition of the interior of the unit square with respect to the linear group "SL"(2,R) (Wagon, Question 7.4). In 2000, Miklós Laczkovich proved that such a decomposition exists. More precisely, let "A" be the family of all bounded subsets of the plane with non-empty interior and at a positive distance from the origin, and "B" the family of all planar sets with the property that a union of finitely many translates under some elements of "SL"(2,R) contains a punctured neighbourhood of the origin. Then all sets in the family "A" are "SL"(2,R)-equidecomposable, and likewise for the sets in "B". It follows that both families consist of paradoxical sets.

Kismat (Zohaib Hassan album)

Kismat is the sixth album released by Pakistani pop singer Zohaib Hassan. It is in Urdu and was released on November 19, 2006.
History.
In 1992 Nazia Hassan and Zohaib Hassan released their last album Camera Camera and Nazia announced her retirement from the music. She joined UN as a political Analyst and Zoheb was involved in his father's business. Later Nazia married and Zohaib decided to work on his first Solo Album "Gina". Zohaib made the song Gina about a little girl and the lyrics were "Mere Khayalon Ki Shehzadi Gina". But later he changed the album title and decided to release it with the name of "Durr". He also made a music video of title song "Durr" which was shoot on "Boom Boom" remix video theme. Durr was a beautiful dance number which was also shown in "Pro Audio Show 96". 
In 1998 Zohaib Hassan was ready to release his album but Nazia Hassan fell sick. Her serious condition didn't allow Zohaib to think about music. Nazia Hassan died on August 13, 2000 and left her fans sad. Zohaib Hassan decided to leave music after this great loss but his fans continued to insist him to do just one more album. 
In 2002 Zohaib decided to come with his pre planned solo Album Durr, with the name of "Kismat". He did some changes in it because now the album was dedicated to his Late sister Nazia Hassan. Instead making of music video Zohaib Hassan decided to produce a drama serial on the tracks of his album. Gina, Zohaib's wife came with a story and Anjum Shezad directed the drama serial "Kismat". Iman Ali and Zohaib Hassan played leading roles in it. Drama serial was on aired from May 2006 to November 2006. Zohaib released this album by Fire Records in November 2006.
This album contains the beautiful memories of Nazia Hassan and Zohaib Hassan. Of course all fans missed Nazia in it. This album was not only painful to Zohaib that he was singing without her sister but also for fans. Zohaib Hassan sung two duets with new girl "Saher Tariq".

Masdevallia davisii

Masdevallia davisii (Davis' Masdevallia) is a species of the Masdevallia genus of orchids. It is also known as the Orchid of the Sun and was known to the Incas as qoriwaqanki ("golden waqanki") – due to its similarity in form to the red "Masdevallia veitchiana", known as "waqanki".
It was named after Walter Davis who discovered it near Cusco in Peru in 1873.
Description.
"M. davisii" is grown cool and blooms in the late spring with a single brilliant yellow flower, usually deep orange inside. The 6.5 to 9 cm flowers hold themselves high and appear successively on an erect, slender peduncle, 25 cm long. The flowers' predominant feature is their thickly textured and well-developed sepals, which end in three characteristic tails (one pointing up and the other two pointing down).
Distribution.
"M. davisii" is found in growing on rocky slopes in Peru at elevations of between 3000 and 3600 metres.
Culture.
"M. davisii" can be grown in cool conditions in partial shade. It should be potted in fine bark with perlite or sphagnum moss and watered regularly, with the potting media kept moist.
History.
In 1873, Walter Davis was dispatched by James Veitch & Sons of Chelsea, London to collect samples of "M. veitchiana" and related species. While collecting in the vicinity of Cusco, Davis found another unidentified Masdevallia species. He sent flowers to Heinrich Reichenbach for identification; in The Gardeners' Chronicle, Reichenbach described this new species as ""M. davisii"", saying:
"This is a beautiful thing, much like "M. harryana" and "veitchiana"... The other parts of the flower are yellowish, white and of the deepest splendid orange inside; so that it would appear to give a most welcome contrast in a group of the scarlet and vermillion and white Masdevallias. It was discovered by a, most probably new collector, Mr. W. Davis... I have a very good opinion of this collector, who was introduced to me by a set of new dried Orchids; so I thought it my duty to attach the name of such a promising collector to such a welcome Masdevallia."
"M. davisii" flowered for the first time in England in August 1874 and rapidly gained favour, becoming widely cultivated in Europe for many years, but it eventually disappeared from collections, joining the ranks of "lost" orchid species, before being re-introduced by David Wellisch of San Francisco in 1978 and by Berthold Wurstle of Spielberg, Germany in 1980.

Kevin Moss

Kevin Joseph Moss (born 1 February 1946) is an Australian politician. He was an Australian Labor Party member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1986 to 2003, representing the electorate of Canterbury.
Moss was born in Sydney, and was educated at St Pauls Convent School in Dulwich Hill and St Patrick's Church Hill. He was elected to the City of Canterbury council in 1973, and served as deputy mayor in 1976 and 1979 before being elected by his colleagues as mayor in 1980. He served as mayor until the year after his election to parliament, and was employed as a staffer at the party's head office during his period.
Moss won Labor preselection to contest the state seat of Canterbury in 1986 when the appointment of former Labor minister Kevin Stewart as the state's Agent-General in London created the need for a by-election. Canterbury was considered a safe seat for the Labor Party, and Moss was elected with over 53% of the primary vote. He was re-elected four times as the member for Canterbury, and served as a parliamentary secretary in the first two terms of the Carr government. Moss retired at the 2003 election, and was succeeded by Labor member Linda Burney.

Currumbin Creek

Currumbin Creek is a large creek on the Gold Coast in Queensland, Australia, running from Mount Cougal in the west to its mouth at Currumbin Alley in the east. It is approximately in length. It provides a popular and tranquil setting for many rowing clubs, kayakers, jet skiers, boat-goers and fishermen.
Projects.
During 2007, a dredging operation took place at the mouth of the creek, making the bottom of Currumbin Alley very shallow, creating a calm lagoon for families and children to play in. Due to a build-up of sand in the creek mouth, not even permitting a jet ski from the creek to the ocean, the Gold Coast City Council announced an operation beginning late in 2008 to deepen the mouth and move sand to the nearby Palm Beach so that beach sand reduced by erosion is replaced.
A boardwalk winds through the small Boree Bodalla Mangrove Reserve with two fishing platforms. It is a popular cycling, running, and walking track and is a serene setting along the creek shore.
Near the creek mouth at Currumbin Alley a swimming canal points northward. It is about in length and in width. The demolishment of the Palm Beach Bowls Club cleared way for a grass park and path to the shore of the canal, which is ideal for swimming, unlike many of the bull shark waters and canals further inland.
Currumbin Creek also has an extensive canal system similar to its cousin Tallebudgera Creek and the larger, further north Nerang River. The shores of these canals boast some of the Gold Coast's most prestigious housing.
The City of Gold Coast runs a volunteer Beaches to Bushland restoration program. The Currumbin Creek Care Group established in 2008 helps restore native vegetation in parkland running on the lower areas of Currumbin Creek.
History.
The first bridge across the creek was opened in 1926. The road was then known as the Main Ocean Road, later to be upgraded to the Pacific Highway.

Bow Kum

Bow Kum (1888 – 15 August 1909) was a Chinese-born slave girl who belonged to the Hip Sing Tong and later to the On Leong Tong around the turn of the 20th century. Her murder was one of the most well-publicized and notorious crimes in New York's history and was the cause of the year-long Tong War between the On Leong Tong and its rivals the Hip Sings and the Four Brothers.
Biography.
Bow Kum was born in Canton, China, in 1888. As a young girl, she was sold by her father for only a few dollars and brought to San Francisco around 1907, where she was purchased for $3,000 by Low Hee Tong. Tong, a high-ranking member of the Hip Sings and Four Brothers, lived with her for four years until he was arrested by police. When he was unable to produce a marriage license for Bow Kum, she was placed with Christian missionaries under Donaldina Cameron, a Scotswoman who spent much of her life helping young Chinese slave girls escape from tongs. Bow Kum eventually married Tchin Len, a truck gardener and member of the On Leong Tong, who took her back to New York as his wife.
Len was eventually confronted by Low Hee Tong, who demanded compensation for the money he had "invested" in the girl, but Len refused to pay him. Low Hee Tong then petitioned the Hip Sings and the Four Brothers in a letter explaining his grievance. The Tong leaders felt his claim was justified and made demands upon the On Leong Tong on Low Hee Tong's behalf. When the On Leong Tong ignored them, the Hip Sings and the Four Brothers declared war. A few days later, a Tong hatchetman slipped into the Mott Street residence of Tchin Len on the early morning of 15 August 1909, and brutally murdered Bow Kum. Her body was found in their bedroom, stabbed three times in the heart, badly mutilated, with some of her fingers cut off. The war between the Chinatown Tongs would continue for over a year before a truce was arranged through mediation by the US government and the Chinese governments.

Lie to Me

Lie to Me (stylized as Lie to me*) is an American crime drama television series. It originally ran on the Fox network from January 21, 2009 to January 31, 2011. In the show, Dr. Cal Lightman (Tim Roth) and his colleagues in The Lightman Group accept assignments from third parties (commonly local and federal law enforcement), and assist in investigations, reaching the truth through applied psychology: interpreting microexpressions, through the Facial Action Coding System, and body language.
In May 2009, the show was renewed for a second season consisting of 13 episodes; Season two premiered on September 28, 2009. On November 24, 2009, Fox ordered an extra nine episodes for season two, bringing the season order to 22 episodes.
On May 12, 2010, "Entertainment Weekly" reported that "Lie to Me" received a 13-episode third season pick-up. The third season of "Lie to Me" was originally to premiere on November 10, 2010. On September 28, 2010, the premiere date was moved to October 4, 2010, because of the cancellation of "Lone Star". "Lie to Me" was officially canceled by Fox on May 11, 2011.
The show is inspired by the work of Paul Ekman, the world's foremost expert on facial expressions and a professor emeritus of psychology at the University of California San Francisco School of Medicine. Dr. Ekman has served as an advisor to police departments and anti-terrorism groups (including the Transportation Security Administration) and acted as a scientific consultant in the production of the series. He is also the author of 15 books, including "Telling Lies" and "Emotions Revealed".
Plot.
Season one opens with Cal and Gillian hiring a new associate: TSA officer Ria Torres, who scored extraordinarily high on Cal's deception-detection diagnostic, and is in turn labeled a "natural" at deception detection. Her innate talent in the field clashes with Cal's academic approach, and he often shows off by rapidly analyzing her every facial expression. She counters by reading Lightman and, when he least expects it, peppers conversations with quotes from his books.
It was gradually revealed that Dr. Lightman was driven to study micro-expressions as a result of guilt over his mother's suicide. She claimed to have been fine in order to obtain a weekend pass from a psychiatric ward, when she was actually experiencing agony (which mostly parallels Paul Ekman's anecdote in his book "Telling Lies").
For a small number of the early episodes, Lightman would team up with Torres to work on a case, while Foster and Loker would team up on a separate case. Occasionally, their work would intertwine, or Foster and/or Lightman would provide assistance on each other's cases. As the first season progressed, the cases became more involved, and all four of the main characters would work together on one case for each episode.
In addition to detecting deception in subjects they interview, Lightman and his team also use various interviewing and interrogation tactics to elicit useful information. Rather than by force, they use careful lines of questioning, provocative statements, theatrics and healthy doses of deception on their own part. In the show's pilot episode, Lightman is speaking to a man who is refusing to speak at all, and is able to discern vital information by talking to him and gauging his reaction to each statement. This approach is also taken in several other episodes (e.g., "Do No Harm").
Principal crew.
Samuel Baum (Showrunner/Head Writer), Brian Grazer, David Nevins, Steven Maeda. Katherine Pope, former president of NBC Universal’s TV studio, signed on as a consulting producer. Pope worked on the final four episodes of the first season. Shawn Ryan, creator of "The Shield" and "The Unit", took over as show runner for the second season.
Reception.
Critical reception.
The show received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It gained a score of 64 on Metacritic from 24 reviews. Entertainment Weekly's Ken Tucker awarded "Lie to Me" a B- rating and wrote ""Lie to Me" is derivative yet well crafted, predictable yet ever-so-slightly novel… it's no wonder that Fox thinks it's got itself a potential hit". However, he also commented "if this review were a face, Dr. Lightman would say it had a forced smile: hopeful, but dubious, about Lie's chances." Tom Shales, writing for the Washington Post, said ""Lie to Me" seems an unusually meaty, thoughtful and thought-provoking crime drama – another police procedural, yes, but one with a dramatic and mesmerizing difference… easily one of the season's best new shows."
Ratings.
In the United States, the viewing figures declined as the series progressed. The Pilot was seen by 12.37 million, however by the final episode of the first season it was down to 8.46 million. The most viewed episode was episode three, "A Perfect Score", which attracted 12.99 million. The second season premiered on September 28, 2009 to 7.73 million viewers. The season two finale had 4.94 million viewers in the U.S. on September 13, 2010. The third season, which had its premiere moved forward to October 4, 2010, was viewed by 5.87 million people in the U.S. The series' official cancellation was announced by Fox on May 10, 2011.
Awards and nominations.
People's Choice Awards.
"Lie to me" was nominated for two awards at the 37th People's Choice Awards and won both of them.
International broadcasting.
The series is broadcast on Global in Canada, Network Ten in Australia, M-Net in South Africa, and also airs in Norway, Sweden, Iceland, Hungary and Belgium. "Lie to Me" aired on Sky1 in the UK and Ireland, starting on May 14, 2009. On July 20, 2009, Fox aired the premiere in Latin America. RTL 5 in The Netherlands has been broadcasting it since November 6, 2009. The series debuted in Italy on September 7, 2009 on the Fox Satellite channel. The series has aired in India since September 2010.
Home release.
Season one and two have been released on DVD in Regions 1, 2 and 4. However, while season one was also released on Blu-ray in North America there has been no announcement about releasing the second season on Blu-ray. The first and second season DVDs sets include deleted scenes and behind-the-scenes featurettes. The second season also includes "Dr. Ekman's Blog" and a gag reel. The third and final season was released on October 4, 2011.

Jacob Siegel

Jacob Siegel (fl. 1900-1910), also known as Kid Jigger or simply Jigger, was an American gunmen-turned-gambler who operated one of the most successful stuss parlors in Manhattan's East Side during the early 20th century. He was one of the few gamblers not under the control of the many street gangs active in the city, supposedly due to his reputation, and generally ran his operations free of interference from more powerful underworld figures.
In May 1910, he was confronted by Johnny Spanish who attempted to intimidate Siegel into making him a partner. When Siegel refused, Spanish said that he would return the following night to ""bump youse off tomorrow night"". Indeed the following night Spanish returned with his partner Hyman Benjamin and confronted Siegel as he was leaving his Forsyth Street headquarters, between Hester and Grand Street, and called on him to fight. Spanish then pulled out his revolver and shot at Siegel, who ran off retreating into his stuss house, which instead hit 8-year-old Rachel Rooten which was playing across the street. Siegel later served as the principal witness against Johnny Spanish and Hyman Benjamin, although Spanish later fled the city. 
Siegel appeared as a minor character in the 2003 historical novel "And All the Saints" by Michael Walsh.

<doc id="20234388" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20234388" title="Fail-safes in nanotechnology">
Fail-safes in nanotechnology

Fail-safes in nanotechnology are devices or features integrated with nanotechnology which, in the event of failure, respond in a way that will cause no harm, or at least a minimum of harm, to other devices or personnel. Fail-safe principles are governed by national standards and engineering practices, and are widely used in conventional engineering design. It is possible to scale down macro-scale fail-safe principles and devices for similar applications at the nano-scale. The use of fail-safes in nanotechnology applications supports social acceptance of those applications by reducing the risks to users; , there are both theoretical and practical ways to implement fail-safe designs in nanotechnology.
A predominant challenge to the social acceptance of nanotechnology is concerned with the medical use of nanostructures in the human body. While any structure for medical use would be developed to be bio-compatible and harmless, sound engineering design must take into account all possibilities of failure. Thus, the design would include ways to manipulate the structures in the body in the event of failure.
Ferrous nanoparticles.
Many researchers are looking into creating nano-scale robots (“nanobots”), for the purpose of undertaking tasks where only robots on the nano scale can be used, such as inside the human body. These robots would have the ability to construct other nanostructures or perform medical procedures, and will be introduced into the body via an injection. The robots’ shells and circuits would be made of ferrous nanoparticles so that a magnetic field could be used to prevent or manipulate their movement. In case of failure or malfunction, a small EMP or an MRI could be used to deactivate the nanobots. Both techniques induce an electromagnetic field, corrupting the memory and shorting out the circuitry of any electronic device within range.
Amino acids.
Researchers are pursuing the building of nanostructures using amino acids. Nanostructures that are created using amino acids are constructed using only synthetic types of amino acids, which tags these structures with unique molecules. These engineered amino acids essentially form synthetic proteins that differ from the naturally occurring proteins in the human body. This difference in the engineered amino acids makes these proteins easy to isolate and target. In case of failure or malfunction, it is possible to identify these proteins using the specifically targeted molecules, which act as a flag to indicate the location of the target. Then, another mechanism would be used to isolate them and deactivate them.
DNA.
DNA within our bodies naturally breaks down, replicates itself, and rebuilds itself every time a cell divides. These processes are all controlled and completed by various enzymes. DNA molecules are composed of corresponding base pair nucleotides in a double-helix formation, which makes these processes very efficient, accurate, and predictable. Due to the ease with which DNA molecules can be fashioned, many publications in the academic society are geared towards creating nanostructures using DNA. With a DNA-based nano-device, synthetic proteins could be created, designed to deactivate a nano-device. These synthetic proteins would be injected into the body to break down the DNA and render a nano-device harmless in the event of a malfunction.
Biological proteins within the human body serve three main functions: they are structural building blocks, enzymes, and facilitate cellular signaling. Synthetic proteins could be developed as a form of indicator and attached to a DNA-based nano-device. This indicator would then be used for the purpose of monitoring nano-devices in the human body. If all DNA-based nano-devices were closely monitored in the human body, they could be controlled quickly in the event of a malfunction.
Programming.
In nanotechnology, particularly in nanobots, the need for a sound programming architecture is very important due to a potentially higher risk of damage in the event of a malfunction. A two-layer approach can be used to control nano-devices: (1) by providing a preprogrammed fail-safe functionality in case of anticipated failures; and (2) a remote-controlled override for use in unforeseen situations. The “remote”-controlled nano-device would require a specialist in the room, to guide the nanobot throughout the procedure.
Cellular engineering.
Many researchers are developing methods that use bacteria to deliver drugs. These bacteria can be “programmed” to perform a specific task, and can be directed to go to targeted locations in the body. However, the bacteria may damage healthy organs or fail to deliver the medicine to the sick organ in the case of a malfunction. In such cases, a fail-safe mechanism is required to neutralize the bacteria and prevent damage. An antibiotic is generally suitable as the fail-safe agent.

<doc id="20234416" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20234416" title="Weraroa">
Weraroa

Weraroa is a genus of mushrooms in the Strophariaceae family. The genus was initially described by mycologist Rolf Singer in 1958 to accommodate the single species "Secotium novae-zelandiae" reported by Gordon Herriott Cunningham in 1924. It has been suggested that the genus may represent an intermediary evolutionary stage between an hypogeous (underground) ancestor and the related epigeous (above ground) genus "Stropharia".
Description.
Macroscopic.
"Weraroa" species are secotioid fungi, meaning that the margin of the pileus never breaks free of the stipe, making them resemble somewhat a pouch on the end of a stem, or stalked-puffball. The peridium (outer wall), which at maturity is glutinous, may range in shape from fusoid to spherical to ovoid or ellipsoid.
The gleba consists of elongated loculi that are various shades of brown. The stipe may also be glutinous, and is continuous with a columella reaching and merging with the upper peridium, often with a thin veil-like structure that joins the edge of the peridium with the top of the stipe. The context is fleshy and may be gelatinous in the outer portion of the peridium.
Cunningham was first to report that the mushroom takes a long time to mature, and specimens can also persist for long times.
Microscopic.
Spores are typically from 10–20 µm in diameter, ellipsoid in shape, smooth, and pigmented ochre to brownish. The basidia (usually 4-spored) often envelop their sterigmata in gastroid-like fashion (i.e., enclosed), and may be narrower in the middle with a broader base. Chrysocystidium are present on the hymenium, on the sterile surfaces of young specimens, and as endocystidia.
Habitat and distribution.
Species are usually found in rainforests or wet grasslands, growing on the ground or on wood; species of "Weraroa" have been found in New Zealand and the USA.
Species.
The species formerly known as "Weraroa cucculata" (Seaver & Shope) and "W. erythrocephala" (Tul. & C. Tul) Singer & A.H. Sm. (1958) were recently transferred out of this genus into "Leratiomyces". This phylogenetic research also demonstrated the close relationship between the type species "W. novae-zelandiae" to the hallucinogenic blue-staining group of "Psilocybe", particularly "P. subaeruginosa". Because "W. novae-zelandiae" is the type species for "Weraroa", this information would suggest that the blue-staining Psilocybes should be transferred into this genus. However, the generic name "Psilocybe" was conserved (Redhead et al. 2007) with the type species "Psilocybe semilanceata". "Weraroa novae-zelendiae" is, therefore, classified as "Psilocybe" under the new name (nomen novum) "Psilocybe weraroa" Borov., Oborník & Noordel. (Borovička et al. 2011).

Tube-snout

The tube-snout, "Aulorhynchus flavidus", is a species of fish related to the sticklebacks. It is the only species in the family Aulorhynchidae.
This species grows to in total length. It physically resembles the sticklebacks, but has a thinner, longer body, with 24 to 27 small spines in front of the dorsal fin. It also possess a slender snout, hence the common name. Like the sticklebacks, it feeds on small invertebrates and fish larvae.
Also, like sticklebacks, it produces a sticky secretion from its kidneys when breeding. Whereas sticklebacks use this secretion to bind plant matter together to create a nest, the tube-snout simply attaches its eggs to a substrate. "Aulorhynchus" attaches its eggs to kelp, notably "Macrocystis pyrifera".
Spawning occurs throughout the year, and males guard nest sites by actively defending them from predators. The nests are found at depths of 10–20 m and have been recorded up to 38 m.
The tubesnout feeds on small planktonic crutaceans, including s, mysids, and crab larvae.
This species finds use as a denizen in public aquariums.
Habitat.
The tubesnout is found in shallow marine waters off the Pacific coast of North America to a depth of , from Prince William Sound in Alaska to Rompiente, Baja California. The species inhabits rocky crevices, kelp beds, eelgrass, and areas with a sandy bottom substrate.

Jean Maritz

Jean Maritz (1680–1743), also Johan Maritz, was a Swiss inventor, born in Burgdorf, Canton of Bern, who moved to France, becoming "Commissaire des Fontes" at Strasbourg (Commissionner of the King's Foundry), and invented the vertical drilling machine, as well as the horizontal drilling machine for cannons in the 18th century. His inventions revolutionized cannon-making, and became a key component of the de Vallière system, and contributed to the development of the later Gribeauval system. 
Jean Maritz first invented a vertical drilling machine for cannons while in France in 1713. The vertical drilling method however, in which a cannon was slowly lowered over a turning drill, was very delicate, very time consuming and rather imprecise.
He further developed a method for the horizontal drilling of cannons around 1734. These methods involved the drilling of a bore from a solid casting. 
These inventions were vast improvements over previous methods, which involved founding the cannon around a clay core, which was removed after founding, leading to imprecision and shifting of the core, and therefore poor performance. 
The inventions of Jean Maritz gave perfectly straight bores which could perfectly fit the ball diameter, and therefore vastly increase efficiency. In the horizontal method developed by Maritz, the solid-cast cannon itself was revolved horizontally, while the drill remained static, in a method similar to that of a lathe.
The son of Jean Maritz, bearing the same name as his father, and who had worked with his father on the development of boring, became Inspector General of Gun Foundries in 1755.
The Maritz method would be central in the development of the Gribeauval cannon.

The Stories of the Sahara

Stories of the Sahara () is an autobiographical account of the life and love of the Taiwanese author Sanmao () while she was living in the Sahara Desert with her Spanish husband, Jose Maria Quero y Ruiz. It was first published in book form in 1976, although some of the earlier stories were published in Taiwan's United Daily News as early as 1974. In the work, she describes her encounters and neighbourly relationships with the Sahrawis, the local indigenous peoples of Western Sahara amongst whom she and her husband lived in close proximity; her adventures in exploring the Saharan desert; and her relationship with her husband, whom she married in 1973 in Western Sahara after successfully progressing through protracted bureaucratic red-tape with the colonial Spanish authorities.
Stories of the Sahara is San Mao's first published collection of stories. Part travelogue, part memoir and a valentine to her love with her husband in a foreign land, it quickly established Sanmao as a travel writer with a unique voice and perspective. It was met with immediate success, and reprinted four times within a month and a half of its first print-run. It remains extremely popular with Chinese readers across Taiwan, Mainland China and Hong Kong.
In a study on the wave of enthusiasm for Taiwanese music and literature that swept the mainland in the 1980s, Hongwei Lu notes that "San Mao’s travel accounts of foreign cultures and life experiences gathered through her living and studying abroad provided post-Mao China with a taste of multiculturalism, and suggested the possibility of not only an expanded consciousness of the world, but a transformation of the way people think about the world and the possibility of being part of it."

Jaxon Benge

Jaxon Benge, (born Jackson Lee Benge) is the guitarist for American punk rock band, Hed PE. He exclusively uses Ibanez Seven-string guitars in the studio and when performing live. Jaxon utilizes a number of styles in his music such as Speed metal and reggae tinged guitar riffs among several others and names legendary guitarists, Jimi Hendrix, Randy Rhoads and Dimebag Darrell as his biggest influences as a guitar player.
Jaxon joined Hed Pe in February 2004 and has been playing with them ever since. He made his studio guitar playing debut on 2004's "Only in Amerika".
History.
Jaxon is noted for having 10 years of guitar playing experience prior to his introduction to Hed PE in 2004 bringing in a total of 19 years since 1994. Jaxon uses seven-string guitars when performing with Hed PE, but he is able to play six and twelve-stringed guitars as noted by his blog.
Jaxon was first considered to become Hed PE's second guitarist after the departure of Chad "Chizad" Benekos during the recording of Hed PE's third studio album, "Blackout" but was passed on for a more well known guitarist, Sonny Mayo, who is the former guitarist of alternative metal band Snot. When Sonny left Hed PE at the end of the Blackout tour, Jaxon took his spot and has been the band's only guitarist ever since, playing the roles of both rhythm and lead guitar. Before 2011, he often played onstage wearing white face paint covered with black X's as well as white tees soaked in black dye following the same color scheme and pattern, hence the "X" in Jaxon.
As of 2008, Jaxon has been regularly updating his MySpace album "Demo-Itis" with exclusive guitar instrumentals that he has written including raw versions of Represent, Walk On By, Ordo Ab Chao, Renegade, No Rest For The Wicked, and N.O.C. These instrumentals show a more experimental side of Jaxon where he tends to explore different types of musical genres such as psychedelic and funk.

Gladys Hasty Carroll

Gladys Hasty Carroll (June 26, 1904 - April 1, 1999) was an American novelist who was a published author from the late 1920s into the 1980s. In her fiction and non-fiction, Carroll wrote about what she knew and people that she loved: specifically, the Southern Maine rural community known as Dunnybrook in South Berwick, Maine. Carroll believed that the history that mattered most was the history of common folk and her literature presented their stories and stories of those like them.
Carroll was born June 26, 1904, in Rochester, New Hampshire, and was raised in South Berwick, Maine. She grew up on the family farm of her parents Warren Verd Hasty and Emma Frances Dow, living with her brother Harold, her grandfather George Bradford Hasty and paternal aunt Vinnie.
As a child she was taught in a one room school house. To keep her occupied, her teachers told her to write on any topic she wished once she finished her school work. She attended and graduated from Berwick Academy and then attended Bates College, being the first person in her family to pursue higher education. Her Bates friends nicknamed her "Sunny" because of her optimistic personality. She graduated in 1925, and was married the next day in the Bates College chapel to Herbert Allen Carroll. Their marriage lasted 58 years, until Dr Carroll's death in April 1983. Herbert's career and pursuits of various degrees took the couple all over America including Massachusetts, Chicago, Minneapolis and Manhattan.
This period marked Carroll's emergence into international prominence as an author. She worked almost tireless, writing short stories, regular advice columns and her novels "Cockatoo" (1929) and "Landspell" (1930). In 1932 she gave birth to her first son, Warren Carroll. In 1933, she wrote her Pulitzer Prize nominated work of fiction, "As the Earth Turns". "As the Earth Turns", was a blockbuster success and the number two selling novel of 1933 according to "Publishers Weekly", second only to Hervey Allen's "Anthony Adverse" and outselling such well-remembered books as Lloyd C. Douglas's "Magnificent Obsession" and Sinclair Lewis's "Ann Vickers". A Warner Bros. film version of the novel starring Jean Muir and Donald Woods was a flop, however, and none of Carroll's other novels were ever filmed. The only other film adaption of any of her work was her story "Kristi" which was made into an episode of Jane Wyman's 1950s anthology television series Fireside Theatre.
The money from the book, along with her husband's job at the University of New Hampshire, allowed her to return to her hometown and build a home on the land of her family in South Berwick. She continued to publish novels, but also worked to write the folkplay adaptation of "As the Earth Turns". She helped produce the play each summer, using her neighbors in the Dunnybrook community and performing in an open field. In 1941 she had her second and last child, a daughter they named Sarah. Towards the end of this interval, she wrote what some consider to be her greatest work, "Dunnybrook", published in 1943.
World War II brought the end of the folkplay, with the last performance being in 1942. After the war Carroll continued to write, publishing a book every two years in the 1940s and 1950s and seven books in the 1960s. She was elected onto the Board of Trustees of Bates College and traveled extensively for their Alumni Association. She eventually moved into the Hasty farmhouse and lived a simple life there. In the 1970s she published the novels "Next of Kin" and "Unless you Die Young" and the autobiographical "Years Away from Home".
In 1985, Carroll inspired the creation of the Dunnybrook Historical Foundation Inc, and was a founding trustee. During the summer she allowed visitors to come to her Maine home to visit, go on guided tours of Dunnybrook, and get books signed. Family and community members also displayed art, made music and performed historical skits. In the mid-1990s the Old Berwick Historical Society helped produce a professional audio recording of her book "Dunnybrook". As Carroll was in her nineties at this point, it took supreme efforts on her part and could be considered the culminating event of a long career.
Gladys Hasty Carroll died peacefully at age 94 on April 1, 1999, in a hospital in York, Maine.
The Dunnybrook Historical Foundation still exists today as a registered non-profit group. The foundation is dedicated to preserving and sharing an extensive collection of material related to the history of Dunnybrook as well as the life and works of Gladys Hasty Carroll. This collection includes many photographs, diaries, letters and official records of those families who lived in Dunnybrook. The foundation is made up entirely of direct descendants of Carroll, down to her living great-grandchildren. It continues to work today to preserve the stories of the people that Gladys Hasty Carroll thought most important.

New World Orphans

New World Orphans is the seventh studio album, by American rock band Hed PE. Released on January 13, 2009, it is the band's fourth album on Suburban Noize.
Music and lyrics.
"New World Orphans" was influenced by Suicidal Tendencies and Minor Threat. The album's sound fuses heavy metal, hip hop and punk rock; it also includes elements of hardcore punk, funk and reggae. The album's lyrics derive from the 9/11 Truth movement, criticism of George W. Bush, the existence of extraterrestrial life, the economy and the Iraq War.
Background.
Hed PE had been working on the album since before the release of "The D.I.Y. Guys" with front man Jared Gomes notifying it through various MySpace posts. Three studio recorded tracks rumored to be on "New World Orphans", "War on the Middle Class", "Ordo (ab Chao)", and "Bloodfire", were released via the live CD/DVD combo set, "The D.I.Y. Guys" on July 8, 2008. The tracks were rough versions of what would later appear on the album.
On November 4, 2008 the band released the music video for "Ordo (ab Chao)" via the band's MySpace. The video showed a different mix than that of the version released on the "The D.I.Y. Guys", including new instrumentation such as a melodica during the verses. On November 25, 2008, "New World Orphans" second single, "Renegade", premiered online on the band's official Facebook account. A video for the song was produced, and premiered on December 20. It was directed by Philip Carrer and Chad Archibald and produced by Guelph's premiere film production studio Black Fawn Film alongside film collective Bleeding Apple.
On November 19, 2008 the official track listing and album artwork were revealed. The album was released in three different color variations of the cover: black, red and white. Each version features exclusive tracks corresponding to their version color. The artwork and final track listing were officially posted via the album's official promotional website.
"New World Orphans" also features guest collaborations including Suburban Noize Records' Kottonmouth Kings and The Dirtball, and Strange Music's Tech N9ne.
As with all post Jive Records albums, "New World Orphans" was produced by Jared Gomes.
Reception.
"New World Orphans" debuted at 72 on the "Billboard" 200, their first debut inside 100 since "Blackout". The album also peaked no. 5 on the Top Internet albums as well as no. 4 on the Top Independent albums.

Cat Girl Alliance

Gameplay.
"Cat Girl Alliance", in traditional fashion, is played by watching and listening to episodic sequences of the game and then selecting or ignoring actions when they are presented to the player. Choices are effectively plot twists, and are intricately linked so that the direction of the developing story changes moderately as each is made; ultimately leading to erotic scenes between characters and one of eight endings. In order for the player to watch all these possible endings, in this regard, he or she will have to replay through the game several times, making different selections than done before.
Plot.
Eiji Tachibana is a young Japanese transfer student beginning his first semester at an unmentioned, fictional junior college. Distant and unacquainted from the rest of the school, Eiji is, for the most part, a friendless and withdrawn boy. In fact the only person who seems to even acknowledge his presence is Shizuko Azumi, the girl who sits behind him.
One morning after class, Shizuko invites Eiji to lunch; Rumi Takahata, the bubbly class representative, excitedly joins as well. As the three sit and eat, Eiji discusses his social predicament, to which both girls suggest he join an extracurricular club. Eiji accepts their advice, and dissatisfied with the athletics and cultural departments, finds comfort in the health committee; by assumption, he visits the infirmary to meet with the group. When he arrives however, he is shocked to find Rumi and another girl, Natsuki Misawa, having sex. Even more surprising is that Rumi is not entirely female; she is in fact, a hermaphrodite. Glued to the scene before him, Eiji furtively watches and leaves.
The following day, things seem to have gone unnoticed. After class, as he reluctantly decides whether or not to visit the infirmary again, a fellow student name Masayoshi informs Eiji that his sister would like to see him there. Besides learning that the boy is her brother, Rumi is quite aware of yesterdays events and offers Eiji the chance to snag Shizuko in the same manner. Though plagued with a mixed conscience, he agrees.
Development.
"G-Collections" reportedly began work on "Cat Girl Alliance", retitled from "Koneko Doumei", as early as January 2008. The following year, license and distributor "JAST USA" announced via its website that it would be promoting the project at Anime Expo 2009. On July 10, "JAST" reported that it had begun work on "Cat Girl Alliance", its next confirmed title, and had made plans to release it sometime that September.
The project failed to meet its September release date but over a monthly course was continually covered. On September 16, "JAST" published a sneak peek of the game, adding that it was at work with Sekilala to put the finishing touches on the project, such as integrating the newly translated script; the game demonstrated full compatibility with Microsoft Windows Vista and 7. "Cat Girl Alliance" entered post-production and subsequent beta testing the following November, re-scheduled for release in winter. That December, reporting that post-production was nearing an end and that "Cat Girl Alliance" would be going gold soon, "JAST" published an outline of the game's cumulative development, noting work on the graphics, scenes, and text. On December 31, New Year's Eve, the company reported that "G-Collections" had finished work on the game and that it was currently undergoing replication; "Cat Girl Alliance" was affirmed gold. Additionally, the official website for the game had also gone live.
The following February, "JAST" announced that "Cat Girl Alliance" had finished replication and was stocked for shipping. Shortly after, on February 17, the company published that the download edition of the game had become available. Several websites reported on the game around this time.
Reception.
Considered by "JAST USA" and "J-LIST.com", respectively, to be G-Collections most "ecchi" and "kinkiest" title to-date, "Cat Girl Alliance" was met with mixed reception. Industry aggregator "Mania.com" gave the game a B+, calling it a "solid release" that, while containing a friendly interface and decent soundtrack, suffered from mediocre visuals and translation. "Shogungamer.com" published a favorable review as well, praising the soundtrack and visuals.
Following up to a pre-release review of the game, "Japanator.com" intern Jon Synder wrote ""this game was little more than a string of pornographic images and accompanying text, barely held together by poor voice acting and something that could be called a 'plot'[...]""

Uno Spin

Uno Spin is a variation of the popular Mattel "card game Uno", with a spinner. Unlike in "Uno", there is a "spin" card, which allows you to spin the spinner provided in the box. The game marketing uses the slogan "The next "revolution" of the classic card game."
The Spinner.
When you draw a "spin" card, a card with a spinning symbol in the top left corner, you may use the provided spinner, which holds the "draw" and "discard" deck. There is no rule that tells the player which way to spin the wheel, although spinning the wheel clockwise is preferred by seasoned players.
Spin Areas.
The list goes in clockwise direction, arrow pointing at 6 o'clock or south.
Uno Spin
The spin cards have white patches on the number. Spin cards are only from number cards 1 to 5.
This is a great adaption of the original Uno game. Uno spin rules are slightly different than the original. The great thing about this version is it is very unpredictable and it is easy to come back from behind.

Khaine

Kaela Mensha Khaine is a god in the "Warhammer Fantasy" and "Warhammer 40,000" fictional universes created by Games Workshop. Khaine is one of the Eldar gods.
In the "Warhammer Fantasy" universe, his name is spelt Khaela Mensha Khaine
"Warhammer 40,000".
In the "Warhammer 40,000" universe, Khaine is a god of the Eldar associated with battle, war and conflict. Many scholars believe him to be a manifestation of the Eldar's racial passion as manifested in battle and warfare. "Kaela Mensha" is not technically part of Khaine's name, but is a title he bears. It roughly translates to "bloody-handed", a reference to the blood which eternally drips from his hands as a reminder of his murder of the ancient Eldar hero, Eldanesh
During the war of heaven, Khaine fought and defeated the Nightbringer, shattering his necrodermis, although the resulting metal shards pierced his flesh, tainting his form with 'the aspect of the Reaper'. It is also said that this event precipitated the eventual fall of the Eldar: The Nightbringer planted the fear of death within all mortal creatures except the Orks, which furthered their survivalist emotions. In the depths of the Warp, beings created during the turmoil of the War in Heaven would feast on these feelings and grow to sentience, setting into motion a chain of events that would close the Path of Rebirth for Eldar souls forever.
Khaine is one of the three surviving gods of the Eldar. In the old pantheon, he was second only to Asuryan himself in power, and was often shown as the enemy of Vaul. He is also the most violent and reckless of the gods. Asuryan was so appalled by his murder of Eldanesh, a mortal, that he cursed Khaine and made his hands drip eternally with the blood of Eldanesh so that everyone would remember what he had done.
Khaine is also believed to have been assaulted, defeated, and dominated by Slaanesh sometime after Slaanesh's awakening in the 29th millennium (Imperial Calendar). Following this, Khorne, Chaos God of war, battled Slaanesh for Khaine, rightly claiming the Eldar deity as his property. During their struggle, Khaine was driven into the material world, where he shattered into a thousand pieces. Each piece came to rest at the heart of an Eldar Craftworld. By sacrificing an Exarch to Khaine on the eve of battle, the Avatar becomes a fiery, animated manifestation of the god, including the blood dripping from his hand, and leads the Eldar army into battle
Khaine's precise nature in the "Warhammer 40,000" cosmology is not defined, although due to his interaction with the Chaos Gods, he appears to be an entity of the Warp, although not appearing to be like the Chaos Gods. Some background materials published by Black Library (such as "Xenology"), imply that Khaine and the rest of the Eldar gods are in fact members of the first sentient species known as 'the Ancients', also known as the Old Ones, which were the creators of the Eldar and many other races of the "Warhammer 40,000" universe. Other Black Library publications suggest that the psychically potent Eldar were themselves created by the Old Ones so that they would produce living manifestations of their racial collective unconscious for use in the war against the C'Tan. After the Old Ones were defeated, Eldar came to worship their psychic creations as gods.
"Warhammer Fantasy".
Elves.
Within the "Warhammer Fantasy" universe Khaine is worshipped primarily by the Dark Elves and High Elves. However, in this instance his full title is Khaela Mensha Khaine, with an 'h' that is not present in the "Warhammer 40,000" Khaine; the meaning of "Khaela Mensha" remains the same.
The High Elves worship Khaine as a god of battle, similar to his "Warhammer 40,000" incarnation. He is primarily worshipped during times of war, as he is seen to be a bloodthirsty deity and worship of him during peacetime is not considered appropriate. Khaine had a strong influence on the formative period of the High Elven kingdom, as the first Phoenix King, Aenarion, drew Khaine's sword to save the High Elves during their first war with Chaos. By drawing the sword, Aenarion became a living avatar of the God of War and he brought down a great curse upon himself and his family. This curse still affects the current heirs of Aenarion's legacy, the twins Tyrion and Teclis.
Khaine as he is worshipped by the Dark Elves is described as a god of murder. This suits the harsh society of Dark Elves, who view any sign of weakness as a fatal flaw. Holidays dedicated to Khaine, such as the Harvest of Souls and Death Night, invariably involve killing. Fueled by the social Darwinism of Dark Elf culture, devotees of Khaine elevate killing to an art form and will gladly kill anyone - friend or foe - who displays vulnerability. 
The primary Temple of Khaine resides in the city of Har Ganeth (known as the City of Execuioners) in Naggaroth. It is a seat of great power, as the worship of Khaine is the official Dark Elf state religion. Morathi (the Queen Mother) and Crone Hellebron (the High Priestess of the temple) both claim supreme dominance of the temple, which often leads to conflicts. This power struggle is kept in check by Malekith, the Witch King of the Dark Elves and son of Aenarion.
It has been implied that Khaine is the Chaos god Khorne by another name, or possibly a minor aspect of Khorne who has gained his own consciousness. This is vehemently disputed by the Dark Elves, who see Khorne as a crude brute in comparison to the refinement and subtlety that defines their god of murder, and most human worshipers of Khaine, who consider their god to be an independent being.
Humans.
Among the humans of the Old World, Khaine is seen as the younger brother of Morr, the God of the Dead, and he is worshiped as the Lord of Murder by assassins and other professional killers. It is said that Khaine is jealous of Morr's rulership over the dead, and thus also over death. Therefore he tries to steal as many souls as possible to fill out his own underworld. 
It is from this deathrealm that some necromancers call forth some of the souls that they enslave.
Khaine can only steal souls that that have been directly sacrificed to him or have not received proper burial rites and are thus unprotected by Morr.

Trentham Railway Station

Trentham Railway Station is an urban railway station in Trentham, a suburb of the city of Upper Hutt in the Wellington region of New Zealand's North Island. It is on the Hutt Valley Line section of the Wairarapa Line and has two side platforms. The station is served by Tranz Metro's electric multiple unit trains, usually of the EM class.
The double-tracking of the Wairarapa Line ends just north of Trentham station, with the line becoming single track as it continues north. However in normal operation, southbound trains use the Ararino Street (western) platform and switch over to the down line south of the station. The Racecourse Road (eastern) platform is only used during race days and for other special occasions that occur at the adjacent Trentham Racecourse. It also allows the eastern platform track to be used as a passing loop, for example, to allow an express freight train or late-running Wairarapa Connection train to pass a stopping unit to avoid it having to run behind the unit on caution signals into Wellington (There are no passing loops which can be remotely operated between Trentham and the Wellington rail yards).
The 20112012 Regional Rail Plan (RRP) proposes duplicating the track between Trentham and Upper Hutt in 2012.
Tranz Metro tickets can be purchased from the Racecourse Dairy, opposite the railway station.
History.
The station was opened in 1907. It initially was single track station with a loop containing the racecourse platform, which served the recently opened Trentham Racecourse. Double track reached Trentham in June 1955, with electrification following in September.
Trentham was originally controlled from its own signal box on the main platform. Following double tracking of the line to Trentham, the southern crossover points (number 18, now 1) and the associated signals protecting the crossover and the single line north could be controlled from the signal box at Upper Hutt, requiring the Trentham signal box only to be used on race days to operate the other crossovers and signals. On 6 February 2007, the Trentham and Upper Hutt signal boxes were decommissioned and control of both stations was moved to Train Control in central Wellington, and all crossovers and signals were renumbered.
Accidents.
On Saturday 22 March 1997, an evening northbound unit approaching Trentham passed the up home (29) signal at danger, which caused the alarms on the Sutherland Avenue level crossing immediately after the signal to only activate at the last second. The train hit a car on the level crossing, severely damaging the car but only causing minor injuries. While it is normal for a level crossing immediately after a signal to not activate if the signal is at danger to prevent needlessly delaying road traffic, the Sutherland Avenue crossing was the only level crossing in New Zealand that was approach-controlled, meaning the up home signal would be held at danger until the barrier arms were down. For an off-peak service when there was usually no conflicting traffic on the single line from Trentham to Upper Hutt, it was normal for the up home signal to change to clear once the barrier arms were down. However, the signalman at Upper Hutt had been distracted sorting out a drunken altercation at that station and had forgot to clear the signal once the last southbound train had cleared Trentham, and the train driver was in the mindset the signal should clear as he approached the level crossing, not realising his mistake until he passed the signal. The approach controlled function was subsequently removed after the accident.
Services.
Trentham Railway Station serves the following Metlink bus services:

Tapco is a brand name for sound reinforcement products including audio mixers, speakers, and amplifiers.
The original Tapco, which stood for "Technical Audio Products COmpany", was founded in 1969 by Greg Mackie and Martin Schneider. Their original product line were guitar amps and PA speakers. They recognized that there were no mixers available with a feature set aimed at the performing musician. The first mixer product, the model 6000 and its variants was successful enough to establish the company and provide revenue for growth. In time, the company produced a line of audio mixers and power amplifiers for sound reinforcement and (later) recording.
In 1979, Tapco was purchased by Electro-Voice who slowly phased out the Tapco name and blended the Tapco products into their own product line. The factory space in Redmond, Washington remained active, producing electronic products for EV until perhaps 1989, when the lease ran out. The entire industrial park was razed and high rise office buildings constructed. Microsoft is the current occupant.
Around 1979, Greg Mackie started a company that made an equalizer for home stereo speakers. That company was AudioControl. It was home stereo because of a non-compete clause in the sale agreement between EV and Tapco. Eventually AudioControl manufactured a line of equalizers for home stereo, and branched out into autosound (car stereo), home theater, and measurement. The company is still in business today (2011).
Subsequently, Greg Mackie went on to found Mackie, with an initial product line similar to the Tapco company that he had founded previously.
In 2003, Mackie purchased the rights to the Tapco name from Electro-Voice, resurrected the Tapco name and applied it to a line of budget mixers, speakers, amplifiers, and other audio equipment. All of the products were American designs manufactured in China. According to their website, Tapco now stands for "Total Audio Production COmpany."
Products.
By early 2011, "Tapco by Mackie" production and marketing of amplifiers, speakers, mixers and audio interfaces had ended, and the website had closed. A note on the official Mackie website under "discontinued products" refers to the entire Tapco line as "effectively discontinued."

Beyond the shadow of a doubt

Beyond the shadow of a doubt, or beyond a shadow of a doubt, is a standard of proof. The phrase means the issue in question is so obvious, or has been so thoroughly proven, that there can exist no doubt. Two possible interpretations of "Beyond a shadow" might refer, first, to the fact that doubt could be nowhere in the vicinity (completely expelled from the issue), or second, to the thoroughness of the argument (a shadow being even less substantial than a doubt itself).
Burden of proof.
Beyond the shadow of a doubt is a standard of proof, and as such, falls along a continuum of certainty. An example of such a continuum might advance as follows:
Interchangeability with reasonable doubt.
Beyond the shadow of a doubt is sometimes used interchangeably, although mistakenly, with beyond a reasonable doubt, especially in courts of law. Some feel the former an impossible standard of proof in court, while the latter is more logically accommodating, allowing for the limits of human reason.
Scientific and philosophic perspectives.
Beyond the shadow of doubt cannot be a scientific term because that level of certainty exists beyond the limits of science, i.e., because science depends on necessarily uncertain a posteriori knowledge, nothing in science could be beyond doubt. For this reason, one might find it useful to think of beyond the shadow of doubt as a metaphysical description.
Legal applications.
"Beyond the shadow of a doubt" is not the standard of proof in criminal cases ("beyond a reasonable doubt" is the standard in common law jurisdictions). It has some relevance in the debate on capital punishment, where there is some support for making "beyond the shadow of a doubt" the standard required for the imposition of the death penalty in a capital case (the implication being that a defendant found guilty but only "beyond a reasonable doubt" would be convicted but could not be sentenced to death).
History.
Beyond the shadow of a doubt, or beyond a shadow of a doubt appears to be a phrase that has grown up in the colloquial, predominantly from the simpler form "beyond a doubt," circa 1300. 
Other notable uses of the exact phrase "shadow of (a) doubt" include:

Angelo State University College of Sciences

The College of Sciences at Angelo State University is a unit of the Texas Tech University System located in San Angelo, Texas.
The college was created in 1973. The initial cadre of degrees included Associate’s programs in Nursing and Agriculture (including Home Economics), plus B.S. degrees in Biology, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Physics. Professor of Biology Dr. Gordon E. Welch was the founding Dean and served in that capacity for over two decades. He was succeeded in 1996 by Professor of Physics Dr. David Loyd, Jr. In 2006, Professor of Geology Dr. Grady Price Blount became the third Dean of the College of Sciences. The institution's first Ph.D. degree (Physical Therapy) was initiated by the college in 2007. In 2010 all of the Nursing and Allied Health programs were spun off to form a new college. At the time of its dissolution in 2011 the College of Sciences consisted of six academic departments offering 20 undergraduate and 3 graduate degree's. The college had the highest per-capita medical school placement rate of any public institution in Texas. The Computer Science program was listed in the Princeton Review as one of the Top 50 Game Design programs in North America. The Physics Department was ranked as one of the top 20 undergraduate programs in the nation by Physics Today. Angelo State University remains as a member institution of the Texas Space Grant Consortium; part of the NASA space-grant university system.

<doc id="20234648" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20234648" title="Facelets">
Facelets

In computing, Facelets is an open source Web template system under the Apache license and the default view handler technology (aka view declaration language) for JavaServer Faces (JSF). The language requires valid input XML documents to work. Facelets supports all of the JSF UI components and focuses completely on building the JSF component tree, reflecting the view for a JSF application.
Although both JSP and JSF technologies have been improved to work better together, Facelets eliminates the issues noted in Hans Bergsten's article "Improving JSF by Dumping JSP"
Facelets draws on some of the ideas from Apache Tapestry, and is similar enough to draw comparison. The project is conceptually similar to Tapestry's, which treats blocks of HTML elements as framework components backed by Java classes. Facelets also has some similarities to the Apache Tiles framework with respect to support templating as well as composition.
Facelets was originally created by Jacob Hookom in 2005 as a separate, alternative view declaration language for JSF 1.1 and JSF 1.2 which both used JSP as the default view declaration language. Starting from JSF 2.0, Facelets has been promoted by the JSF expert group to be the default view declaration language. JSP has been deprecated as a legacy fall back.
Element conversion.
In Facelets templates tags from a tag library can be entered in two forms: directly as a qualified xml element or indirectly via the codice_1 attribute on an arbitrary non-qualified element. In the latter case the Facelet compiler will ignore the actual element and will process the element as-if it was the one given by the codice_1 attribute. 
The following example shows the direct usage of qualified tags:
Using the codice_1 attribute, the same code can also be expressed as the example given below:
The above code can be viewed in a browser, and edited with conventional WYSIWYG design tools. This is not possible when directly using the qualified tags. Nevertheless, directly using qualified tags is the most popular way of using Facelets in practice and is the style most used in books and examples.
Templating.
Facelets provides a facility for templating. A Facelets file can reference a master template and provide content for the placeholders this master template defines. The file that references such a template is called the "template client". Template clients themselves can again be used as a template for other template clients and as such a hierarchy of templates can be created.
The following shows an example of a simple master template:
templates/master_template.xhtml
The above code contains a default HTML 'frame' and a single placeholder called "body_content". A template client can use this template as follows:
template_client.xhtml
The above code makes use of the template codice_4 and provides content for the placeholder in that template. The final result will be a page called codice_5, which has the content of codice_4 but with codice_7 replaced by 'This is a template client page that uses the master template.'.
Content re-use.
In addition to templating, Facelets provides support for re-use by letting the user include content that resides in a different file. Including such content can be done in 3 different ways:
Referencing a file.
The simplest way to include the content of another Facelet is referencing it by name using the codice_8 tag. This causes the content in the referenced file to be directly included in the calling Facelet by the Facelets compiler. Besides re-using content at multiple locations, this can be used to break down a large Facelet in smaller parts.
The following shows an example:
templates/master_template.xhtml
html_head.xhtml
Custom tags.
Facelets supports indirection for including content via custom tags. Such a custom tag can be associated with a Facelet in taglib file. Occurrences of that tag will then be replaced with the content of the associated Facelet. 
The following shows an example of this:
templates/master_template.xhtml
The code above uses the tag codice_9 to mark the point in the Facelet where content is to be inserted. Such a tag has to be declared in a Taglib file where it can be associated with a Facelet as follows:
example.taglib.xml
<syntaxhighlight lang=xml>
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<facelet-taglib 
</facelet-taglib>
</syntaxhighlight>
The following shows an example of what the actual content Facelet could look like:
spacer.xhtml
Composite components.
Besides including content directly, Facelets provides the composite component mechanism that makes content available as a first-class JSF component. Composite components do not need to be declared in a Taglib file, but instead have to be put in a special directory. By convention the content is then automatically assigned a namespace and a tag name. The namespace is constructed of the fixed string 'http://java.sun.com/jsf/composite/' concatenated with the directory name in which the content file resides relative to the 'resources' directory. The tag name becomes the file name without the .xhtml suffix. 
The following shows an example of this:
resources/my/spacer.xhtml
The above Facelet is automatically available as a component in namespace 'http://java.sun.com/jsf/composite/my' and tag name 'spacer'
Parameterized includes.
To customize included content, Facelets allows parameters to be used. Via those parameters objects can be passed into the included content, where they can be used as variables. For the codice_8 mechanism the codice_11 can be used for this, while for the custom tags and composite components normal tag attributes can be used. Composite components require parameters to be declared in their interface section, while for custom tags there is no such requirement and values provided for arbitrary attributes are made available as variables with the same name as said attribute.

Rovering in Victoria

Rovering in Victoria is part of Scouting in Victoria and is predominantly the Rover section of Scouts Australia in Victoria, Australia, which is run by the Victorian Branch Rover Scout Council. At the 2012 Census, there were 1033 registered Rover Scouts in Victoria, in roughly 100 Rover Crews.
Rover Scouts is the fifth and final section of Scouting in Australia, and began in 1918. Rovers are aged between 18 and 26 years of age and are organised into local Crews, which are associated with a Scout Group. Rover Scout Crews accept anyone interested in taking up Rovering, whether or not they have been in Scouts before. The section is based on Baden-Powell's book "Rovering to Success" and the theme of knighthood. Rover Scouts are actively encouraged to become better citizens through taking part in Scouts Australia's nationally accredited training programs, developing leadership skills, participating in outdoor activities, attending, both as participants and staff, at national and international events, providing service to the community and generally building their life skills.
Rover Scouts are distinguished from other sections of Scouting and leaders by a red panel on the blue uniform shirt across the arms and shoulders, with green "epaulette" badges on each shoulder, and the 'shoulder knot' of five ribbons (tan for Joeys, yellow for Cubs, green for Scouts, maroon for Venturers and red for Rover Scouts) on the left shoulder, symbolising the role of the Rover Section in helping and protecting their younger brothers and sisters.
The Victorian Rover Scouts kick-started recreational skiing's popularity in Australia, at a time where they would often have to hike up the mountains after making their own skis; this was heavily influenced by W. F. Waters, the first Branch Commissioner for Rover Scouts in Victoria.
Branch Organisation.
There are eight Region Rover Scout Communities in Victoria and these Communities are responsible for the management and distribution of important information to Rover Scout Crews in there respective regions. They report to the statewide Branch Rover Council and Elect the Office Bearers of the Branch Rover Scout Council each May for the next financial year. the Communities are also elect/appoint the subcommittees for Victorian Rover Scouts assets and annual events.
Rover Scout Motorsport.
Rover Scout Motorsport (RSM) is a subcommittee of the Branch Rover Council and oversees all Rover Motorsport events in Victoria, ensuring that they follow the strict speed, safety, alcohol and racing policies of the Confederation of Australian Motorsport. Rover Motorsport was briefly stopped for three years in the early 2000s when insurance was lost. It is the continued affiliation with CAMS that allows Rovers to continue racing. They were congratulated by the then Minister for Sport and Recreation, James Merlino, for their road safety programme targeted to scouts at the Australian Scout Jamboree in 2007.
Rover Assets.
Mafeking Rover Park.
Mafeking Rover Park is a campground which is fully owned and operated by the Victorian Branch Rover Council and was originally anticipated as a home for Victorian Rover Scout Motorsport. Located 32 km from Yea, it is a 130 Hectares mix of open land and scrub.
Although it is called a Rover Park, its use is open to all sections of the Scouting Movement, and any others who wish to hire it.
Mafeking was named after the South African town of Mafeking, which was besieged for 219 days during the Second Boer War. The Garrison was commanded by Scouting Founder Lt General Lord Sir Robert Baden-Powell of Gilwell, who with 2,000 British soldiers held off 8,000 Boer Soldiers until relieved, catapulting Baden-Powell to the status of a national hero.
Mafeking's facilities include a 4-cargo-container-tall abseiling tower, commando, orienteering and 9-hole golf courses. Lake Surfmoot provides an area for canoeing, and there are numerous walking tracks. Accommodation is offered in the Troop Hall, Bunkhouses and on standard campsites. Mafeking also has numerous motorsport related facilities with well maintained tracks that are set up in compliance with the requirements of the Confederation of Australian Motorsport.
Mafeking is home to a large variety of Australian fauna and flora, such as Kangaroos, Koalas, Swap Wallabys, Possums, Bats, as well as a multitude of lizards, Frogs, Birds and Fish. Local indigenous plants are used at Mafeking, both from propagated species collected from the local area, and through revegetation efforts.
Alpine Rovering.
Alpine Rovering in Victoria takes place mainly in the W.F. Waters Lodge at Mt Baw Baw and the Bogong Rover Chalet, home to the Alpine Rover Crew and now also the Alpine Venturer Unit.
The Alpine Rover Crew was formed in 1940 by W.F. "Bill" Waters, Branch Commissioner - Rovers during 1930 - 1965, to promote the Bogong Rover Chalet. All invested Rover or Leaders, who have completed a Bogong Winter Party, become a member during their first winter party. The Alpine Venturer Unit was formed in 2000, mostly by the hard work of Matt & Ian Franzke. It is used as many Venturers visit the chalet but cannot be invested into a Rover Crew.
Before 1940 and the birth of the Alpine Rover Crew, the Bogong Rover Crew carried out the same purpose. However since then, membership has become an award for services to Alpine Rovering. Members have displayed the of Rovering and are dedicated in their service to others. Roughly 200 members have since been invested, in a ceremony on skis that traditionally takes place at "Investiture Point" the closest place to the Chalet you can see Mount Bogong, where the ashes of W.F. Waters were scattered.
Bogong Rover Chalet was one of the first ski lodges on the Bogong High Plains which is why it is so far from the village of Falls Creek. Similarly, the WF Waters Lodge is the closest to the carpark at Mount Baw Baw Village.
Major Events.
Mudbash.
Mudbash is an annual motorsport event run by the Rovers. The four day event is held over the Queens Birthday weekend in June each year, and is now held at Mafeking Rover Park in Caveat, in country Victoria. Each year it is attended by more than 1500 people.
Competitors at Mudbash build vehicles, known as buggies, to conform to CAMS regulations. These vehicles range from modified road cars to custom built dune buggies.
Endeavor Rover Crew organised the first Mudbash in 1972, which was held at the Big River campsite in Marysville, and was attended by 5 vehicles. In the years since, the event has boomed and has been attended by more than 70 vehicles in some years.
Notable events at Mudbash include the Obstacle Course, Hill climb (now known as Quafftumbla challenge) and Motorkhana, which takes place in the main arena at night.
Surfmoot.
Surfmoot is an annual camp run over the Australia Day weekend in January, and is held at Eumerella Scout Camp in Anglesea.
One of Victorian Rovers longest running events, Surfmoot started in 1931 when a group of Geelong Rovers invited a number of Melbourne crews to Angleasea for a surfing camp. Eumerella Scout Camp has played host to the event every year since 1953, except for three years when the Ash Wednesday Bushfires caused the event to be moved to Bay Park and then Phillip Island. Prior to being held at Eumerella, it was held at the Geelong District Campsite and also on the Anglesea Foreshore.
Activities at Surfmoot include a waterslide, Super Tub racing as well as many others. Night entertainment often includes bands, djs and themed parties. There are also off site activities run in the surrounding areas.
MARB.
The Metropolitan Area Rover Ball, or MARB, is an annual fancy dress Rover ball run by a committee of Rovers. It is normally held on a Saturday night in July. The organising committee is composed of members from one of the Metropolitan regions, and rotates each year.

B. N. Rau

Sir Benegal Narsing Rau, CIE, (26 February 1887 – 30 November 1953) was an Indian civil servant, jurist, diplomat and statesman known for his key role in drafting the Constitution of India. He was also India's representative to the United Nations Security Council from 1950 to 1952. His brothers were Governor of the Reserve Bank of India Benegal Rama Rau and journalist and politician B. Shiva Rao.
One of the foremost Indian jurists of his time, Rau helped draft the constitutions of Burma in 1947 and India in 1950. As India’s representative on the United Nations Security Council (1950–52), he was serving as president of the council when it recommended armed assistance to South Korea (June 1950). Later he was a member of the Korean War post United Nations Command Military Armistice Commission (UNCMAC).
A graduate of the Universities of Madras and Cambridge, Rau entered the Indian civil service in 1910. After revising the entire Indian statutory code (1935–37), he was knighted (1938) and made judge (1939) of the Bengal High Court at Calcutta (Kolkata). His writings on Indian law include a noted study on constitutional precedents as well as articles on human rights in India. He served briefly (1944–45) as Prime Minister of Jammu and Kashmir state. From February 1952 until his death, he was a judge of the Permanent Court of International Justice, The Hague. Before his election to the court, he was regarded as a candidate for secretary-general of the United Nations.
Early life and education.
Narsing Rau was born in Mangalore on 26 February 1887 in a family of intellectuals. His father Benegal Raghavendra Rau was an eminent doctor. Narsing Rau passed Matriculation in 1901 from the Canara High School, Mangalore, topping the list of students of the entire Madras Presidency. He stood first in the entire University in the F.A. (Intermediate) examination and gained his degree with First Class marks in English, Sanskrit, and Mathematics. On a scholarship, he proceeded to Trinity College, Cambridge, and took his Tripos in 1909, just missing the Senior Wranglership.
Bureaucratic career.
B. N. Rau passed the Indian Civil Service Examination in 1909 and returned to India, posted to Bengal. Doing well on the Executive side, in 1909 he moved to the Judiciary. His distinguished work brought him a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) in the 1934 New Year Honours list and a knighthood in 1938. An example of his outstanding thoroughness untiring industry, and sincerity was the manner in producing the Indus Waters Commission report to settle a dispute between Punjab and Sind. In preparation for the challenging assignments, he mastered Statistics within a short time, and then went on to understand the intricate problems of irrigation. Rau retired from service in 1944.
After retirement from the Indian Civil Services, Rau was appointed as the Prime Minister of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir.
Role in drafting the Constitution of India.
B. N. Rau was appointed as the Constitutional Adviser to the Constituent Assembly in formulating the Indian Constitution. He was responsible for the general structure of its democratic framework of the Constitution and prepared its original draft.
The Constituent Assembly's resolution setting up the Drafting Committee, under the chairmanship of B. R. Ambedkar, declared that it was being set up to "Scrutinise the Draft of the text of the Constitution prepared by the Constitutional Adviser giving effect to the decisions taken already in the Assembly and including all matters ancillary thereto or which have to be provided in such a Constitution, and to submit to the Assembly for consideration the text of the Draft Constitution as revised by the Committee." There already was a Draft in existence when this Committee was set up.
The President of the Constituent Assembly Rajendra Prasad, before signing the Constitution on 26 November 1949, thanked Rau for having "worked honorarily all the time that he was here, assisting the assembly not only with his knowledge and erudition but also enabled the other members to perform their duties with thoroughness and intelligence by supplying them with the material on which they could work." Rau was not a member of the assembly but was perhaps as important in the framing of the Constitution.
Diplomatic career.
Rau served India as a representing delegate in the United Nations. From 1949 to 1952 he was India's Permanent Representative to the UN, till he was appointed as a Judge of the International Court in The Hague. He also served as the President of the United Nations Security Council in June 1950.

Kiatkamol Lata

Kiatkamol Lata () (aka. Tui ) (born on May 7, 1983) is a Thai singer, actor. He first gained notice by winning Thailand's True Visions Academy Fantasia Season 3, a famous American Idol-liked reality show in Thailand. Due to the popularity of the show, people usually called the contestants' names followed by the term "AF"; as a result, Kiatkamol also became known as "Tui AF" () or "Tui AF3" ().
Biography.
Kiatkamol Lata was born in Bangkok, Thailand to a family as an only child. He graduated from Rajamangala University of Technology Phra Nakhon with a Bachelor's Degree of Business Administration (Majoring in Finance). 
After graduation, he worked at Thai Health Promotion Foundation, where he was part of the team to promote an "anti drink-drive" campaign - he worked there for three months, then decided to audition for Academy Fantasia Season 3.
Academy Fantasia.
In 2006, Kiatkamol auditioned for Academy Fantasia Season 3 and became one of the final 12 contestants to participate in the show. His run on Academy Fantasia was considered one of the most successful runs in the history of Thailand's Academy Fantasia, as he was one of the three persons who never been at the bottom three (the others were Jeen AF1 and Good AF5) from 72 contestants of Season1-5. Kiatkamol is also considered one of the most successful artists from reality contests in Thailand.
Thailand's Academy Fantasia has always been famous for creating surprises for their fans. Surprise of Season 3 occurred on Week #6 when the host, Toi-Settha, announced that Kiatkamol was to leave the show. As Kiatkamol being one of the frontrunners of the season, this so-called elimination shocked the whole audience. However, Toi-Settha then revealed that Kiatkamol was to leave the show for a few days only and that was because he won the highest number of votes of the week. Kiatkamol was rewarded with a trip to Hong Kong with his mother, and to visit Hong Kong's major TV Station, TVB where he participated in a promotional event with Ron Ng Cheuk Hei, a Hong Kong actor and singer.
Music career.
After his successful run on Academy Fantasia, Kiatkamol released his first single "Aok Huk Mai Wa" - a pop dance song, which was on many music charts during its release. Half a year later, Kiatkamol released his solo album, "Tui : A Rock On Earth", where he went back to his favorite genre, pop rock. From this album Kiatkamol was nominated and won some artist polls and awards. Popular songs from this album included, "Takieng Kub Tawan", an ending theme song for Kiatkamol's lakorn debut "Phoo Kong Yod Rak", and "Hai Krai Ma Rak Noi", which won Popular Songs of the Year 2007 from Virgin Hitz Award 2007. 
In 2008, before Jo Jo San AF the Musical began, Kiatkamol was diagnosed with a cyst on his vocal cord. Kiatkamol said that his voice often got hoarse after performances and as time went by his voice hardly came back to normal. He waited until the run of the play was over to have it removed on September 17, 2008 and was forbidden to speak for one month.
Acting career.
In addition to singing, Kiatkamol also had a chance to try out acting. His first TV series, Phoo Kong Yod Rak, which he paired up with Diana Chung, won the most popular TV-series from KomChadLuek Award#5. 
Kiatkamol's first participation with Channel 3 was "Tueng Rai Kor Rak" which he co-starred with Paul Pattarapol and Namfon Patcharin. He signed lakorn contract with Channel 3 and started having more lakorns with the channel. In 2008, he starred opposite Ploy-Chermarn Boonyasak in "Botan Gleeb Sud Tai" and had to take some lessons of Chinese Opera for the role. In 2009, Kiatkamol was back to work with Namfon Patcharin again in Look Sao Kam Nan, a musical lakorn where he played a new deputy trying to win the heart of a tomboy daughter of the mayor.
Handle Me With Care.
In 2008, Kiatkamol was chosen by the producer, Jira Maligool 
to be in Kongdej Jaturanrasamee's Handle Me With Care (aka. Kod) and to co-starred with Kratae - Supaksorn Chaimongkol. Kiatkamol played Kwan, a three-armed man in search of his meaning of life. Kiatkamol gave an interview that this was a very challenging role for him and Kongdej had helped him a lot in understanding the role. As the filming progressed, he began to get comfortable with having two left arms and thought it looked special. By the time the filming ended, he became so engrossed with the role that when his "extra" arm was taken out, he felt something was missing. 
"Kod" did not do well at Thailand's box office at the time of its release and garnered somewhat mixed reviews, but was quite popular with the film festival circuits and was shown in various festivals such as Hong Kong International Film Festival 2008, Udine Far East Film Festival 2008, Munich Film Festival 2008, Montreal Fantasia Festival 2008, and 2008 Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival. 
"Handle Me With Care" has been nominated for Best Foreign Film, The Arri-Zeiss Award at 26th Filmfest Munchen 2008 in Germany; and for Best Picture, in International Competition at 2nd Chungmuro International Film Festival 2008 in Korea. It won the Mental Health Media Award 2008 from Department of Mental Health, Ministry of Public Health of Thailand.
Kiatkamol received good reviews for his acting in Handle Me With Care, and was nominated Best Actor from associations such as Thailand National Film Association Awards (Supannahong), Bangkok Critics Assembly and others.
Then he went on to win his first acting award from 6th Kom Chad Luek Awards for Best Actor from this movie.

<doc id="20234818" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20234818" title="A Divine Looking-Glass">
A Divine Looking-Glass

A Divine Looking-Glass was written and first published in 1656 by John Reeve, an English prophet. A second edition, revised by Lodowicke Muggleton, was published in 1661 and from this a fifth edition (with more modern scriptural quotations) was published in 1846. It claims to be a work of holy writ and is seen to be so in Muggletonianism. Specifically, it is part of the 'Third and Last Testament of Our Lord Jesus Christ'. The first two testaments are the Mosaic law and the gospels of Christ's apostles. In the scriptural style, Reeve's book is divided into chapter and verse.
"I, John Reeve, am the last commissionated prophet that ever shall declare divine secrets" (46.3). He received his commission from God "to the hearing of the ear as a man speaks to his friend" (23.22) in February 1651. There were no visions or ecstasies. This commission identifies Reeve and his cousin, Lodowicke Muggleton, as the Two Witnesses referred to in the Book of Revelation at chapter 11 verse 3. The context means that both men saw themselves as given "a power" from God to expound scripture, God now decreeing the world to be ready to learn more of the divine secrets as the end of time draws near. This contrasts with a more usual prophetic tendency of the 1650s to identify the prophet "as messenger", with the 'angel with a book' in chapter 10 of Revelation.
Background.
The doctrine in "A Divine Looking-Glass" is not systematic. Nor is it the working out of a single guiding principle through all areas of life. Instead, Reeve seeks to tackle what he regards as the burning issues of the day, at a time when individuals felt great anxiety as to their personal salvation and many conflicting scriptural interpretations jostled for attention. In chapter 1 verse 4 he identifies four questions by which his book will seek to satisfy the curious. 1) Whether any creature was formed on purpose for eternal suffering? 2) Could any blame be attached to such a creature? 3) Would it not have been as advantageous to have formed all creatures for eternal happiness? 4) Whence came sin into man or angel?
Creation, Angels and the three heavens.
God, says Reeve, is an eternal, uncreated spiritual person, in form like a man (1.7). That man is Christ Jesus, who once walked this earth but is now glorified in heaven (1.8). This is the ancient Holy One of Israel who 'will not give his glory to another' (3.38). All other titles bestowed upon the deity are mere name-calling and refer to the divine qualities as perceived by humans. Even Reeve, though, cannot quite bring himself to say that "Father" is just another word for "Son". Most emphatically, what God is not, is an invisible spirit (1.18). That would be something Reeve considers an absurdity. To be able to act and intervene, God must possess a locus, a being. Just as God is eternal, so lifeless matter in the 'formlessness' of dust and water has existed since before time. The three heavens and our world were created from these, not from nothing-at-all. Creation is the word of God breathing life into the previously lifeless dust and water (2.8). Since Reeve is loath to say evil derives from God's creation he sees it as a primal force lying in wait amongst the lifeless dust - a surprising prototype for the Cthulhu mythos. 
The angels were the first created beings (3.1). They share the same form as human beings but possess spirits of pure reason (3.3). God's word creates creatures, not replica gods (3.12). Neither humans nor angels share in God's natural infinity (3.27). Sadly, whilst Reeve considers the relationship between God and angels, he ignores any general interaction between angels and humankind. Reeve states that he believes it was but a short time between the creation of the angels and the creation of man. Perhaps he wishes to avoid speculation like Laurence Clarkson's "Land of Nod" or the Jewish Lilith.
The serpent which tempted Eve was one of these angels (3.4). There had to be an angelic reprobate so that the angels would know their innate goodness came from God, and not out of their own natures (3.6). Satan sins, not because of what he wills but because of what God wills for him. Just as there can be no perception of light without darkness, so there can be no glory for some without shame and misery for others (5.36). Reeve does not consider why this rather worldly psychology has to exist in heaven. The angels, although created perfectly pure, require continual infusions of divine inspiration in order not to degenerate (4.26). That degeneration was what happened to the reprobate angel, satan. Reeve does not follow the line that evil may be merely the misapplication of things intended for good.
Reason and the right devil.
Reeve takes the unusual step of condemning reason outright. There is never any tendency in his book to equate reason with the deity. Quite the contrary, he is certain there is no trace of reason in God because reason is just desire. Humans use reason, at least after the fall of Adam and Eve, because they see in it a technique, a trick, to obtain the satisfactions they feel they lack. Angels do likewise, although their desires are for pure things, not carnal ones. God lacks nothing, therefore he neither desires nor reasons. "all those men that call pure reason God's divine nature ... they shall find their imaginary reason nothing else but a dark tormenting fiery devil of burning envy in their own bodies" (1.23).
If reason, instead of guiding humankind, constantly leads it astray, upon what can we rely? The law as written into our consciences (4.50). It is conscience that determines actions, not free-will (14.39). And, by the implant of conscience in us, we can comprehend immortal and infinite things although not being immortal or infinite ourselves. For Reeve, what eventually defeats the earthly tyrant is his own bad conscience (42.33). Only God is subject to no law (4.18). Law is to be found in faith alone because the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life (5.47). Faith is entirely within the gift of God (1.29). Reeve does not explore the problem of the wide differences of experience of conscience between individuals. What scripture contains is spiritual mysteries, accessible by faith, but not by reason (6.5). The gospels were not written by the learned but by the enlightened (6.11). Those who employ reason may see but do not perceive, hear but do not understand. Reason is devilishness within. A right appreciation of the devil is to see it as the turmoil within ourselves.
Reeve displays little affinity for the mysticism which seeks oneness with an infinite majesty whilst still in this life. There is even less enthusiasm for moral reform. Instead, he advocates a realistic and fatalistic acceptance of the human condition as we find it (15.14). Questions like 'why do all my repentances lead to a craving to sin again' are just pointless self-recrimination (13.1). We are what we are and free-will is powerless to change this. "It is thou, O Lord Jesus Christ which wounds the souls of thy redeemed ones, through thy spiritual absence; and it is Thou who must heal them with thy glorious presence" (13.12). Why? Because that's the way divine love and free grace work. In heavenly affairs, points do not win prizes. Merit is merely worldly.
The seed of the serpent and the seed of the woman.
Spiritual conflict is not, as so often appears, between the ways of God and the ways of this world, but between the seed of the serpent and the seed of the woman (38.13). The woman is Eve, the first woman. The serpent is the reprobate angel who "was thrown down into this perishing world, where his desired kingdom of god-like government was prepared for him" (5.19). Eve was defiled by the serpent entering into her private parts there to make an end of himself by mixing with her womanliness and to launch a new career of evil in this world. As a result, a man-child was born to her, Cain, whose father was not Adam. The fall was none of Adam and Eve's fault. Had they possessed the power to preserve their original condition, they would have used it (30.20). Eve is to be considered as an exemplar of everything innocence should be, not as an easily-deluded girl. 
What, then, is all the fuss about an apple? "You cannot be so weak," says Reeve, "as to think that the law of eternal life and death depended on the eating of an apple from a natural tree." (33.22). It is not what goes into a man that defiles him, but what comes out of his heart. Thus, the tale of the apple is a mere euphemism as ancient Jewish writers were pained by overt reference to the genitals.
The curse upon Eve is temporal. That upon the serpent is eternal. The seed of the woman shall break the serpent's head. The sins of humankind are the frailties of free-will and are pardonable. That of the serpent is the sin against the Holy Ghost which is without absolution. But if Eve is not to blame, why is she cursed at all? Because that is what a knowledge between good and evil is. As to the serpent, what does it matter to him if he is cursed, seeing he was the devil in the first place?
The reversal of time.
John Reeve writes at a time when an interpretive understanding of the world as an order of Ideas and archetypes was giving way to something more analytical. Reeve has a foot in both old and new. But this tension is already present in the Jewish scriptures themselves. Mircea Eliade says "for the first time, the prophets placed a value on history, succeeded in transcending the traditional vision of the cycle (the conception that all things will be repeated forever) and discovered a one-way time.". All the pieces are falling into place for history's end-game. The chastisement of Adam is reversed by Christ, our second Adam. The defilement of Eve is reversed by the immaculate conception which restores purity. 
For Reeve, God will surely make all things like new again. He will come as a thief in the night (47.7). And that time is now (22.12). The day of his appearing shall be like unto that of Noah (flood) and Lot (hail of fire and brimstone) (47.1). But why, if everything is to be made good again, has humanity's history of suffering been necessary? Because that is what creation means. A limitless deity creates limited creatures and knowledge is their limit. The apocalypse to come is when the awful truth to the phrase 'make the heart of this people fat' will have sunk in. Only faith saves. Following St Paul, Reeve says darkly, "who shall dare open his mouth on that day to say, Why hast thou made me thus?" (26.11)
Scriptural Astro-physics.
Reeve's system of astronomy is based upon scripture. It is also based upon a traditional view of matter in which earth, water, fire and air are the four elements and all substances interact according to how their 'natures' either repel each other in conflict or attract each other harmoniously.
Our "visible heaven is all the firmaments that ever were created" (7.43). But there exist two other created heavens. One is said to be a "spiritual creation within natural bodies" (8.6). The other is the third heaven cited in scripture which is "the realm of the angels and glorified bodies of Moses and Elijah" (8.4). 
The bodies of the sun and moon were both formed out of water (7.45). Sun, moon and stars each possess only their own light (7.35). How, then may eclipses be explained? Reeve says "whatever men have long declared concerning the eclipse of the sun, through the near appearance of the moon, you may understand that the true occasion of the sun eclipsed, whether in part or whole, is according to their appearing at a further or nearer distance unto each other." (7.49). "harken no more unto vain astronomers or star-gazers, concerning the bulk of the sun, moon and stars, for I positively affirm from the God that made them that the compass of their bodies are not much bigger than they appear to our natural sight" (7.33).
What Reeve is describing is a sort of parallel universe (avoiding the pitfalls of reason) and a deeply psychedelic one. This is testified by the twelve beautiful plates, six illustrating the Newtonian system and six the Muggletonian, which accompany Isaac Frost's 1846 "Two systems of astronomy".
Conclusion.
Reeve ends his work 'forget not that the wisdom of God seeth it most advantageous for his glory to choose base and despised things to confound the honourable and eloquent things of this vain glorious world' (51.11) amongst which things he counts 'conceited wise men which through an ambition of tongues or languages, have studied beyond all sober sense, reason or wit' (25.6). One topic which became important to subsequent Muggletonianism is no more than implicit in his book. This deals with the doctrine of immediate notice which says that God neither intervenes in, nor takes notice of, the everyday events of our world. Formal worship or private prayer is equally pointless. Nowhere does he give consideration as to what he means by terms like redemption or predestination. Reeve fails to stick to the story-line provided by the whole of the Book of Revelation and it may be this which prompted Muggleton's own two commentaries upon Revelation.

Edith Vogel

Edith Vogel (April 5, 1912 in Czernowitz – June 12, 1992 in London) was an Austro-Hungarian-born classical pianist active in the UK. 
After she got as far as she could with her first teacher, Vogel took lessons from Wally Loew, first assistant to Richard Robert, whom she described as "a sergeant-major of the first order", who forced her to study only dramatic and virtuoso pieces.
She made her debut in Vienna at the age of 10, and studied at the Vienna Academy. She broadcast on Austrian radio when she was 15.
After Hitler came to power she escaped Austria, arriving at Victoria station in 1938 with ten schillings. From her arrival in Britain she did not play professionally for ten years, working instead as house-keeper, clerk, child-minder and some 'unofficial' teaching, and playing only privately among friends and fellow refugees (including on one occasion Schnabel before he left for America). At one point she was almost mistakenly engaged at the Windmill Theatre. From August 1948 she began playing recitals and concertos up and down the UK. She appeared at the Proms seven times between 1952 and 1978, playing Brahms and Beethoven, but also the London premiere of Gordon Jacob's 2nd Piano Concerto.
Vogel began to broadcast regularly for BBC radio from the 1950s, becoming particularly associated with the music of Beethoven and Schubert. She was also a prominent teacher, participating in the Dartington Summer Schools and joining the piano faculty and giving master classes at the Guildhall School of Music, claiming that life without teaching would be "unthinkable". She had homes in London and Sussex.
The BBC holds a considerable archive of her recordings, some of which have been made commercially available.

Windows Post-Install Wizard

Windows Post-Install Wizard (WPI or WPIW) is a software application for choosing and installing multiple Windows programs. It is commonly used just after a Windows installation on a computer, to choose and add the required applications that will be used, such as word processor, browser, CD-burning, anti-virus, utilities etc.
The user must have all the programs available, and runs WPI to enable it to compile the selectable program list. Each program in the list will then have a check box next to it. If the box is checked, then WPI will install that program when it runs.
WPI can be added to an operating system disk so that the OS and required applications are all on one disk. WPI can then be configured so that when the Windows OS installation completes, then the WPI will then proceed to automatically install the selected applications in a 'slipstreamed' or 'unattended' way. The makers of WPI pride themselves on the flexibility of the program.
WPI is freeware; however, the makers of WPI accept donations via PayPal.

Gameplay.
The gameplay in "Flyable Heart" requires little player interaction as much of the game's duration is spent reading the text that appears on the screen, which represents either dialogue between various characters or the inner thoughts of the protagonist. Every so often the player will come to a "decision point", where he or she is given the chance to choose from multiple options. The time between these points is variable and can occur anywhere from a minute to much longer. Gameplay pauses at these points, and depending on which choice the player makes, the plot will progress in a specific direction. There are six main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines. In order to view all five plot lines, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and make difference decisions to progress the plot in an alternate direction.

Freeway Complex Fire

The Freeway Complex Fire was a wildfire in the Santa Ana Canyon area of Orange County in the US state of California. The fire is notable for the extensive property damage in Anaheim Hills and Yorba Linda. 314 residences were destroyed or damaged in these two communities.
Summary.
Freeway Complex Fire, also known as the Triangle Complex Fire or Corona Fire, began 9:01 a.m. PDT November 15, 2008, along the Riverside Freeway (California State Route 91) in the riverbed of the Santa Ana River located in Corona, California. The fire spread west and north into the hillsides of Yorba Linda and south into Anaheim Hills, where multiple businesses and residences were destroyed. It also burned homes in Olinda Ranch along Carbon Canyon Road in Brea, burned through much of Chino Hills, then spread north into Diamond Bar.
The Landfill Fire, also known as the "Brea Fire," was reported at 10:43 a.m. PDT on Saturday, November 15, 2008, and started near the 1900 block of Valencia Avenue in Brea, just south of the Olinda Landfill. It quickly spread West and eventually jumped the Orange (57) Freeway.
The Landfill Fire merged with the Freeway Fire at 3:30 a.m. PDT on November 16, 2008. At approximately 7:00 a.m. PDT the two fires were officially renamed the Triangle Complex Fire. Around 12:45 p.m. the "Triangle Complex Fire" had been renamed again to the "Freeway Complex Fire" still using the OCFA incident number CA-ORC-08075221. According to the final cause report released by the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection on January 4, 2010, the cause of the Freeway fire was a faulty catalytic converter, which the State of California requires in every motor vehicle for the purposes of cutting down emissions.
Burn Areas.
It was calculated that were burned including 90% of Chino Hills State Park. The calculated acreage burned would make the fire the fourth largest fire on record in Orange County History behind the 1967 Paseo Grande Fire, Steward Fire of 1958 and the Green River Fire of 1948.
Evacuations.
About 40,000 were evacuated. Areas under mandatory evacuation during the fires included:
Also in Corona there was an evacuation.
Freeway closures.
The Freeway Complex Fire forced the closure of the Riverside (91) Freeway, the Chino Valley (71) Freeway and the 241 Transportation Corridor. The Landfill fire (a.k.a. Brea Fire) temporarily closed the Orange (57) Freeway in northern Orange County.
Other Fires in the Southland.
Preceding this fire was an outbreak to the northwest, the Sayre Fire in Sylmar (November 14). Both were preceded by an unrelated fire along the Pacific Coast, the Tea Fire in Santa Barbara and Montecito (November 13).

Insignia Financial Group

Insignia Financial Group was a Delaware corporation, headquartered in Greenville, South Carolina, engaged in the aggregation, management, and disposition of multifamily apartment complexes. Founded by Andrew L. Farkas with an initial capitalization of $5.5 million provided by an investor syndicate organized by Farkas, Insignia consummated the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of U.S. Shelter Corporation, a multifamily real estate syndicator, on December 31, 1990. Insignia was taken public in 1991 by a syndicate led by Lehman Brothers and Dillon, Read & Co. Its stock was listed on the NYSE under the symbol IFG.
Under Farkas' leadership, Insignia grew to be the largest owner and operator of multifamily housing in the free world. Insignia was known for innovation; it grew and prospered by creatively adapting sophisticated mergers, acquisitions, and secularization techniques to its industry. Insignia acquired portfolios of general partnership interests in tax shelters owning often distressed multifamily and commercial property from the original syndicators, and employed a variety of techniques to extract value from these often moribund tax shelters. Insignia consummated 39 separate acquisitions of general partnership interest portfolios and, later in its history, commercial real estate operations. Insignia was among the first companies to use tender offers to increase its ownership of limited partnerships owning multifamily property. Insignia refinanced substantial portions of its multifamily portfolio in bulk though the first two non cross collateralized real estate mortgage investment conduits, sponsored by Lehman Brothers, in 1992 and 1993.
Insignia sold its multifamily business to Apartment Investment and Management Company for $1.4 billion in 1999. The remainder of Insignia was sold for approximately $120 million to C.B. Richard Ellis in 2003.

David Floyd Lambertson

David F. Lambertson of Kansas served as United States Ambassador to Thailand from September 1991 until August 1995.
Lambertson entered the U.S. Foreign Service in February 1963. He was assigned to Saigon from 1965 to 1968 as a member of the embassy’s political section, to Medan, Indonesia from 1969 to 1971, and to Paris as a liaison officer and press spokesman for the U.S. Delegation to the Vietnam peace talks, 1971-1973.
Lambertson returned to the State Department in Washington in 1973, first to the Office of East Asian Regional Affairs and then, in 1975, to the Office of Japanese Affairs as its Deputy Director. He was posted to Tokyo in 1977 as Deputy Chief of the political section, responsible for working with the Japanese Foreign Ministry on U.S.-Japan bilateral issues and cooperative US-Japanese approaches to multilateral questions. In 1980-1981 Lambertson attended the Royal College of Defence Studies in London, after which he returned to Washington as Director of the Office of Korean Affairs, 1982-84. He was Deputy Chief of Mission in the U.S. Embassies in Canberra, 1984-86, and Seoul, 1986-87.
In 1987 Lambertson was named Deputy Assistant Secretary of State with responsibility for the ten countries of Southeast Asia. His work during his three years in that position focused on negotiations to end the war in Cambodia, support for the newly established democracy in the Philippines, and efforts to achieve the fullest possible accounting for Americans missing in action in Indochina. 
During the 1990-91 academic year, Lambertson was Diplomat-in-Residence at the University of Kansas, teaching in the Political Science department. While at KU he was named by President Bush in early 1991 as Ambassador to Thailand. He was confirmed by the Senate in July and arrived in Bangkok in September of that year. As Ambassador to Thailand, Lambertson led one of America’s largest embassies (500-plus U.S. employees, 26 USG agencies, more than 1500 Thai employees). He was responsible for all aspects of U.S. relations with Thailand during a period of significant political upheaval and change, burgeoning growth in US-Thai economic relations, intensified efforts to combat drug production and trafficking, and major refugee and displaced persons issues along Thailand’s borders with Cambodia, Laos and Burma. He also had oversight responsibility for U.S. government activities in Vietnam and Cambodia prior to the end of the Cambodia war and normalization of relations with Vietnam. Lambertson left Thailand in August 1995 and retired from the Foreign Service shortly thereafter.
During his career, Lambertson was a member of numerous U.S. delegations to international conferences, beginning with the Paris Peace Talks, and including, inter alia, bilateral planning conferences with Japan, Korea and Australia, a United Nations conference on refugees in 1988 in Geneva, the 1989 Paris Conference on Cambodia (in which he led the U.S. delegation), and several conferences of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. He was a member of the U.S. delegation to the United Nations General Assembly in 1980. Lambertson traveled to Hanoi three times, prior to normalization, as a member of delegations seeking progress on the POW/MIA issue. 
Lambertson had extensive experience in the foreign policy process in Washington, including Oval Office meetings during the Reagan, Bush and Clinton Administrations, chairmanship of inter-agency committees and more than 35 appearances before Congressional committees. He also had considerable media exposure, including appearances on the Today Show, Good Morning America, Nightline and NPR’s Morning Edition. He spoke on aspects of U.S. policy in many forums, including the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, the Asia Society in New York and Washington, the Aspen Institute and numerous business organizations nation-wide. 
During his Foreign Service career, Lambertson earned the State Department’s Meritorious, Superior and Distinguished Honor Awards as well as several Presidential awards.
From 1996 through 1998, Lambertson was Director of International Development at KU, organizing business seminars and doing outreach for the University. Lambertson has taught in the Honors Program at KU and in the graduate-level International Studies program (MAIS), and has been a guest lecturer in the Anthropology, History and Political Science departments. At KU, Lambertson is also a member of the International Programs Advisory Board, the Honors Program Advisory Board, and the Advisory Board of the Biodiversity Institute/Natural History Museum, chairing the latter. He was a member of the Advisory Council of the Business School’s Center for International Business Education and Research, and for a time was co-Director of that center. Lambertson was active in the early years of the Dole Institute of Politics, as a member of planning groups and as a moderator in conferences on China MFN and the future of NATO, and has participated in a number of more recent programs. In 2007-2008, Lambertson established and was the first Director of the KU-Ft. Leavenworth Program (now the Office of Professional Military Graduate Education). 
In 2002, Lambertson was the Freeman Foundation Visiting Professor of Asian Affairs at Claremont McKenna College in California. Beginning in November 2000, and continuing through December 2005, he was American representative of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization in North Korea. In that capacity, he made eleven visits to North Korea, totaling nearly eighteen months in duration.
Lambertson is a member of the International Relations Council of Kansas City, and the American Foreign Service Association. He is a past member of the Kansas International Trade Coordinating Council. He was a founding member of the Board of Trustees of the Command and General Staff College Foundation, and is a member of the Advisory Board of the Simons Center for the Study of Interagency Cooperation. He was awarded the Department of the Army’s Outstanding Civilian Service Medal in 2008.
Lambertson was raised in Fairview, Kansas and received a BA degree from the University of Redlands in California. He is married to the former Sacie Hooper. They live near Winchester, Kansas.

World Trade University

World Trade University is a failed private university in British Columbia, Canada. Launched in 2001, the university withdrew its application for degree-granting status in 2008 and "has yet to open". 
The university was created via a private member's bill of the British Columbia government—an act that the Confederation of University Faculty Associations of B.C. (CUFABC) is requesting be rescinded. 
The British Columbia government "erroneously" described the university as a "United Nations mechanism", and the university web site removed logos of the World Bank and the United Nations after those institutions denied that there were partnerships with the university. The university is located in a former military base, CFB Chilliwack, renovated at a cost of $1 million paid by the city. 
An August 2008 article in the "National Post" concluded that the story of this institution "reflected badly on the B.C. government."

I Swear (N-Dubz song)

"I Swear" is the second overall single released by English hip hop trio, N-Dubz under their self-funded record label. It was released on September 12, 2006 as their first mainstream release. The maxi single is the only single by N-Dubz that is available on the US iTunes Store. The track later featured on the group's debut album, "Uncle B", more than two years after the single was originally released.
Background.
"I Swear" was written, produced and released by N-Dubz during 2006. With Jamior Edwards being credited as the track's co-producer. The general style of the song is an upbeat hip-hop backing combined with the soulful vocals of Tulisa and the intensive rapping of Dappy forming an original British hip-hop grime track which's style is reflected in the forthcoming album tracks and singles that appeared on N-Dubz's debut album "Uncle B". The song prominently features the two more common participants of N-Dubz in the singing and rapping of their songs: Tulisa and Dappy, with Fazer featuring as backing vocals and/or grunting throughout the song as well as in the final verse where he raps about how he caught his girlfriend cheating on him when he arrived home from tour. The first verse is rapped by Dappy with Tulisa in backing. This follows onto a call and response chorus between both Dappy and Tulisa. Verse two is led by Tulisa with Dappy in backing and the track is called-out with N-Dubz's signatures call-outs "It's N-Dubz N-Dubz, what ye, it's N-Dubz N-Dubz, two thousand and sexy naa naa nii" - rapped by Dappy and "Uh-oh uh-oh" sung by Tulisa. The song's general theme involves infidelity, a theme which is later followed on by the group's 2008 single "Ouch". The song, through its lyrics, tells a story about how a man discovers that after his girlfriend starts regularly giving him the cold shoulder that she's in fact cheating on him. It's mentioned that he sees his girlfriend kissing another guy under a bridge and when he arrives home from tour he suspiciously finds a pair of Nike shoes that don't belong to him whilst his girlfriend is at home. The story of the lyrics goes on into an argument between the couple and the girlfriend admits that she didn't go chillin' with her girl-friends but did, as accused cheat on him. She states her reason for this as him not giving her enough love and she however consistently apologizes to him through the progression of the song and its lyrics. "I Swear" has also been featured as the concert opening track on N-Dubz's setlist for their Uncle B Tour.
Critical reception.
Metro.co.uk mentioned "I Swear" as one of the stand-out tracks on "Uncle B", describing it as an "indefility anthem with a clever touch". Ukmusic.com reviewed the singe "I Swear" is set to ignite both underground and commercial radio alike. The track is very in your face with both Dappy and Fazer threatening the so-called 'cheater'. Tulisa however, neutralises "I Swear" with her melodic harmonies that overall make it a great tune to listen to. It certainly becomes catchier after multiple listens. Dappy's voice is truly amazing and edits a very comical essence into the chorus. Ciao.co.uk also positively reviewed the song, claiming it had a great beat and fantastic sound. N-Dubz's sound really comes into its own in this track. Their slightly crazy voices work so well on the chorus. A perfect mix of rap and vocals mean you don't get bored of it and it tells a great story of infidelity.
Music video.
The music video for "I Swear" premiered on YouTube on November 22, 2006. As of June 15, 2009 the music video has received over 5,251,172 YouTube views. The music video begins with Tulisa lying in bed and Dappy strolling around the neighbourhood during the song's intro. It then moves onto Dappy being tied to a chair being teased by a girl, correlating with the lyrics "I miss the time when you would tie me to a chair, tease me from the back of my neck up to my ear". From this scene, which is repeated throughout the video in different ways, the video moves onto a scene under a bridge where a woman is kissing a man - correlating with the lyrics of Dappy's lines in the song. Furthermore, the scene then evolves into Dappy discovering the couple's secret at the scene of the crime, he is then angered by it and attacks the man. At the chorus of the song, the scene is shifted to in and around a city bridge. This is the setting for the majority of the video and mainly in the song's choruses. Tulisa then reappears wearing black sunglasses and white summer outfit. The scene is then shifted to a home for the second verse which is sung by Tulisa and features Tulisa pleading to her boyfriend and then also teasing him while he's tied to a chair. During Fazer's verse, the video showcases him walking into his home, arriving from tour, discovering a pair of Nike shoes which don't belong to him, whilst his girlfriend is in bed with another man. As Fazer walks up the stairs, his girlfriend tells the man in her bed to go hide. Just when she thinks her secret is safe, Fazer confronts her about the Nike shoes and an argument develops which later results in her secret being exposed. The chorus then features all three N-Dubz members performing on a bridge in a more darker setting than that of the previous choruses in the video.
Chart performance.
"I Swear" entered the UK Singles Chart in September 2006 at #91 on downloads only, selling over 1,000 copies through word of 'cybermouth' only, this was the last and only week the single spent on the chart due to it having limited promotion and funding under LRC at the time. It did however become the group's first of fifteen top 100 hits on the chart and at the time was the group's highest charting single, outpeaking debut single "You Better Not Waste My Time"s peak of #149 before it was re-released in 2007. The other seven singles released so far make up the other seven top 100 hits. "I Swear" holds the record so far as the group's least successful and lowest charting single to-date, the second lowest charting-single being "Wouldn't You" which has so far peaked at #64, twenty-seven places higher than "I Swear".

Strong Again

"Strong Again" is a song by English hip hop trio, N-Dubz. It is the sixth single from their debut album "Uncle B" and was produced by Kano and Fraser T Smith. The song was featured on the album advert before it was confirmed to be a single. This song features on the UK compilation album "Now That's What I Call Music! 72". This is the first N-Dubz song to make a "Now!" album. It was later the B-Side to "We Dance On", which would eventually be the first single from their third studio album, "Love.Live.Life". Both songs were included on the "StreetDance" Soundtrack. On 28 January 2009, the song was added to Radio 1's A-List, becoming their first single to do so. The single was released as a digital download on 9 February 2009. The song "Wouldn't You" was originally intended to be the sixth single, however, it was later released as the seventh single instead.
Critical reception.
David Balls of Digital Spy wrote: "If the frequency with which their Uncle B album ad gets repeated on TV is in any way indicative of the band's popularity, N-Dubz have a very promising future ahead of them. After a spluttering start that saw them win a MOBO, then get dropped and signed again, Tulisa, Fazer and Dappy have conquered the airwaves of late and are now aiming for a fourth consecutive top 30 hit. 'Strong Again' is another urban/pop crossover track that sounds like The Black Eyed Peas just bumped into Dizzee Rascal and got on like a house on fire. With tidier production than their earlier singles, this manages to sound accessible and radio-friendly without sacrificing its all-important street cred. Expect to hear it blasted at full volume from the back of the bus very soon. In the BBC Radio version the words "punch up" are removed from the opening line; one day i had to punch up this one youth. 3/5."
Music video.
A behind the scenes video was released in preparation. Since then, the video started receiving airplay on music channels. The music video was released on YouTube on 1 December 2008. The video starts showing a red "N-Dubz" logo with a black background. The song then starts and features the three of them performing on a centered stage. A DJ is seen playing their album, "Uncle B". Dappy stage dives into the crowd. Some shots of the video cut to black and white. The video continues with all members dancing on the stage with Tulisa the star of the video. The video has had over 5 million views on YouTube.
Charts.
On 28 December 2008, the song entered the UK Singles Chart at #138 on downloads alone and went in at #40 due to album downloads, the day before the digital single was released. The song reached #25 on downloads alone, as well as position 5 on the UK R&B Chart. On 7 March 2009 the song climbed up 1 place to a new peak of #24.

Locotrol

Locotrol is a product of GE Transportation Systems that permits railway locomotives to be distributed throughout the length of a train (distributed power). It is installed on more than 8,500 locomotives around the world, sending signals from the lead locomotive and via radio to the remote control locomotives. 
History.
Locotrol was developed in the 1960s by an Ohio telephone and electronics manufacturer, North Electric Company. The technology was later purchased by GETS predecessor Harris Controls. The electronics were mounted in a separate railcar, but have since been miniaturised into relatively small cabinets with much of the functionality contained in software. Early Locotrol customers included the Southern Railway, Norfolk & Western RR, Canadian Pacific and Australia's Mount Newman Mining and Queensland Rail. Today 20 companies use the system, with 5,000 systems deployed.
Since 1975, both Queensland Rail and Mount Newman Mining (now called BHP Billiton Iron Ore) in Australia have used the system on coal and iron ore trains, permitting the doubling in the size of trains without exceeding draw-gear strength, through the use of mid-train locomotives. Westrail, Western Australia's government-owned railway introduced Locotrol working in 1996, also with retrofitted equipment. In June 2001 BHP Iron Ore in the Australian Pilbara set a record for the longest train with 682 ore cars and eight distributed GE AC6000CW locomotives in a 2-168-2-168-2-168-1-178-1 configuration. The Union Pacific Railroad, BNSF Railway are major North American Locotrol operators.
Features.
Originally an aftermarket product, the system is also available as an option on new locomotives. Distributed power itself was not a new concept, but it required an extra train crew to be located in the middle of the train. Two modes of operation can be used: synchronous where all locomotives operating in unison, or independent mode where part of the train heading upgrade can be powering, while the other half can be braking on the downgrade. Most systems use lead and middle of train locomotives, but up to four consists can be controlled from the lead unit.

Flag of Convenience (band)

Flag of Convenience were a rock group formed in 1982 by former Buzzcocks members Steve Diggle and John Maher, along with bassist Dave Farrow and keyboard player D.P. The band continued with a changing line-up until 1989, with later incarnations releasing records under the names F.O.C. and Buzzcocks F.O.C. The final incarnation of the band included former member of The Stone Roses Andy Couzens and former Inspiral Carpets drummer Chris Goodwin, who both went on to form The High. The band ended when Diggle joined Pete Shelley in a re-formed Buzzcocks, the reunion prompted by controversy over the use of "Buzzcocks" in the billing of Diggle's band.
In a review of the 'best of' compilation "The Secret Public Years 1981-1989", "Allmusic" described the later F.O.C. work as proof that Diggle was "one of the most important and overlooked artists in all of Britain during the '80s".

A50 motorway (Netherlands)

The A50 is a highway in the Netherlands, running from Eindhoven in the southeast up to Zwolle in the northeast of the country.
It passes the cities of Eindhoven, close to (15 km) Den Bosch, Nijmegen, Arnhem, Apeldoorn and Zwolle.
During the Second World War the Highway was known as Highway 69. Since 1969 it is known as N69, and now remains so named only between the border of Noord-Brabant province and the E34 Freeway. 
The highway was an important and only avenue of advance during Operation Market Garden, and after the fighting along its length between Allied and Wehrmacht forces it was named "Hell's Highway" so named because of the effective artillery fire directed at it by the German forces in the area. During the fighting some of the highway south of Eindhoven was jammed with wrecks of vehicles being attacked by up to 200 Luftwaffe bombers requiring bulldozers and blade-equipped tanks to roam the length, pushing them off the surface to keep traffic moving. The wrecks on the soft shoulders of the highway prevented its use by other vehicles, in effect converting the highway into a narrow corridor, and slowing the movement on it to a crawl for the Allied drivers.
The fighting along N69 is depicted in a recent computer game .

A44 motorway (Netherlands)

The A44 motorway is a motorway in the Netherlands connecting the A4 with Wassenaar. The route continues as main road N44 towards The Hague, providing an alternative link with Amsterdam for the A4 motorway. The A44 also serves Leiden and the Bollenstreek. The length of the A44 is , the N44 adds another making the total route long. 
Overview.
Near Leimuiden, the A44 motorway splits from the A4 at Burgerveen interchange. Until the 1960s, the A4 followed the route of the current A44 passing Leiden west. Then the new A4 was built east of the city creating a more direct route from Amsterdam to Rotterdam. The former A4 was eventually renumbered into A44. Both motorways are important arteries for The Hague, where the A44 is primarily focussed on the city centre. The A44 is one of the oldest motorways of the country with parts dating from the 1930s. Small dimensions of the carriageway, narrow bridges and tight junctions are signs of outdated design. It is also remarkable that the A44 is one of the very few busy Randstad-motorways not being equipped with active traffic management nor lit for the major part.
When leaving the Burgerveen interchange in the province of North-Holland, the A44 runs through rural area known as the Bollenstreek. In Spring the fields fill up with coloured flowers. A few towns pass by and the motorway crosses the Ringvaart where it enters the province of South-Holland. The surroundings of the A44 become more populated when approaching Leiden. The motorway ends a few kilometers south of Leiden in Wassenaar at an at-grade junction with traffic lights. The route continues as major road N44, running through the wooded estates of Wassenaar towards The Hague. The N44 ends at the city limits of The Hague. Here, the route continues as city route s101 towards the city centre. A split-level interchange connects the N44 with the N14 towards Leidschendam and the s200 towards Scheveningen.

A32 motorway (Netherlands)

The A32 motorway is a motorway in the Netherlands connecting Meppel, via Heerenveen to Leeuwarden. No part of the motorway is subject to a European route.
Overview.
Two aqueducts are located on the motorway's route: the Leppa-Akwadukt near Akkrum and the Akwadukt mid-Fryslân near Grouw.
Traffic jams occur in rush hour near Interchange Lankhorst, especially in the morning rush hour. A reconstruction of interchange Lankhorst is completed in 2009. The traffic jams to the interchange were solved by extra lanes southbound on the A28

A31 motorway (Netherlands)

The A31 / N31 is a motorway and an expressway in the Netherlands. It connects the A7 near Zurich with the A7 near Drachten, passing close to Leeuwarden, the provincial capital. It is slightly unusual due to it changing from full motorway to normal 2-lane road along various sections of its 65 km length.
Route description.
The short section between the Zurich interchange with the A7, and exit 15 for Zurich (approx 1.7 km) is designated as the A31 and is built to motorway standards. The next 7 km continues as a 4-lane expressway, until the road narrows to just a normal 2-lane road for the next 3 km while it passes over an elevated section through Harlingen. This section from Zurich to Harlingen is designated as the N31, but retains the motorway-style grade separated intersections. For the next 18 km, until exit 22 for Marssum, the road is once again designated the A31 and is built to motorway standards. This section of the A31 bypasses the towns of Franeker and Dronrijp. At exit 22 one has to take this exit to follow the N31 while continuing over the exit, the road reverts to an expressway and continues as the N383 into Leeuwarden. 
The remaining 35 km of the N31, until it meets exit 30 of the A7, is once again an expressway. Of this last section, the first 13 km around Leeuwarden is a just a 2-lane road with at-grade intersections and utilises traffic signals and roundabouts, while the final section opens out into 4-lanes with grade separated intersections. The widening of this last section to four lanes, was completed in 2008.

Schizomeria ovata

Schizomeria ovata, a medium to large Australian rainforest tree, is widespread in warm-temperate rainforest in coastal New South Wales north from Narooma (36° S) and southern Queensland south from Fraser Island (25° S). It is also found in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.
Common names: (Australian) White Birch, Crab apple, White Cherry, Snowberry, Humbug, Squeaker
Timber is pale blond, and is a commercial species, under the name Australian White Birch. 
The timber was notably used as an interior finish in the Sydney Opera House. Plywood veneered with "Schizomeria ovata" was used for the ceiling, upper walls, and seating of the Concert Hall, and for wall and ceiling panelling and doors in other internal areas. The Schizomeria ovata veneer had been specially dyed to meet the Opera House specifications at the Veneer and Plywood Pty Ltd. plant at Yarras in the Hastings valley and was given the commercial name of 'Cinnamon birch', a warm 'cinnamon' color.

FIBA Europe Player of the Year Award

The FIBA Europe Player of the Year Award is an annual official FIBA Europe award inaugurated in the year 2005, with awards given for both men and women. The winner is a basketball player that has European citizenship and whose performances with his or her sports club and/or national team throughout the year have reached the highest level of excellence. All European players, regardless of where they play in the world, qualify for the award, including NBA and WNBA players. Players do not have to play in any FIBA competitions at all in order to qualify.
The winner receives the prize after winning a vote of both the fans and a panel of basketball experts, media members, and coaches from 25 different countries. Consequently, the legitimacy of the men's award is somewhat higher than Eurobasket's All-Europeans Player of the Year, "Superbasket" magazine's Mister Europa Award, and "Gazzetta dello Sport"'s Euroscar Award, which do not include the fan vote. That being specified, the importance of those latter two awards rely on their tradition, as their inception occurred in the years 1976 and 1979 respectively. All in all, the laureates are the same on all four lists in the great majority of cases, all of them representing the biggest European basketball stars since the mid-1970s.
Winners.
If a winner played for more than one club team in the calendar year of his or her award, all teams are listed in chronological order. Note that women often play in the WNBA during the European off season.

This is a list of last monarchs of the Americas.
North America.
United States.
The Native American hereditary leaders during this time are not included. Those that are listed as former monarchs of what is now the continental United States were heads of European seated monarchies (or Mexican monarchs, such as Augustine I of Mexico and Maximilian I of Mexico) and themselves never set foot on American soil. Others were indigenous monarchs, such as Malietoa Tanumafili I, Tui Manua Elisala and Liliuokalani of Hawaii; The last monarch of each state and territory may not be the last colonial ruler (i.e. Louis XV of France is the last French monarch of Louisiana, but Napoleon Bonaparte, prior to becoming Emperor, was the last ruler of Louisiana). Also their end of reign may not be how the US acquired these states. One state can have more than one last monarch, since each state may have been the product of many different acquisitions by the United States. Different claims of a foreign country are taken into account.

Leaving his junior status behind, there were some early international tournament successes such as at the Wichern Open in Hamburg in 1997 (joint second place, behind Sergei Movsesian) and Senden in 1998 (joint winner with Frank Holzke).
In 1999 he relocated to Germany and qualified as a Grandmaster in 2001.

Joue pas

"Joue pas" is a 1989 song recorded by French artist François Feldman, in duet with the American singer Joniece Jamison. It was released as a single from Feldman's album "Une Présence" in July 1989, and was his fifth single overall. The song achieved great success, becoming a number two hit and a popular song throughout the years.
Song information.
Written and composed by François Feldman and Thierry Durbet, "Joue pas" has funky sonorities and starts with a brief guitar riff. It was "very well received by the public". It was the singer's first duet in his career, and he recorded other two ones with Joniece Jamison : "J'ai peur" in 1991 (#7 in France) and "Love platonique" in 1996.
In France, the single debuted at #47 on July 15, 1989, climbed quickly and finally entered the top ten in its fourth week. It hit number 2 for five non consecutive weeks, but was unable to disloge Kaoma's smash hit "Lambada" which topped the chart then. Thereafter, it dropped and totaled 14 weeks in the top ten and 22 weeks on the chart (top 50). "Joue pas" is currently the 640th best-selling single of all time in France.
The song was included on many French compilations released in the 1990s and the 2000s, such as "Les années tubes spécial 80", "Tubes d'un jour tubes de toujours spécial années 80", "Nostalgie Classiques 80" and "La Discothèque du XXè siècle - 1989". It also features on Feldman's compilations "Two Feldman" and "Gold".
Cover versions.
The song was covered in 2000 by Karen Mulder, Roch Voisine and Ophélie Winter on Les Enfoirés' album "Les Enfoirés en 2000". This 3:46 version is the 11th track. It was also covered in 2002 by Houcine and Anne-Laure Sibon, two contestants of Star Academy 2, on the album "Fait sa boum". In 2008, French DJ Soma Riba, who covered many 1980s songs, made his own version of the song and, as for the original one, recorded it as a duet with Joniece Jamison.

Connie Talbot's Christmas Album

"Connie Talbot's Christmas Album, sometimes referred to as Connie's Christmas Album or just Christmas Album", is the second album from English child singer Connie Talbot, released on 24 November 2008. The album is made up of Christmas-themed songs, and was recorded in the middle of 2008. Shortly after the release, Pinnacle Entertainment, the United Kingdom distributor, went into administration. Despite this, the album had some success in Asia and the United States, and Talbot's third album, "Connie Talbot's Holiday Magic", featured many of the same tracks. Talbot appeared publicly to promote the album, including an appearance on ITV Central in December, and embarked on a tour, making stops around the world. Critics responded warmly to the album, describing Talbot's voice as "sweet".
Recording and release.
Talbot's voice was recorded near her home. Other parts of the album were recorded elsewhere in the UK, as well as in the U.S., Bulgaria and Hong Kong. "Connie Talbot's Christmas Album" contains "a mix of classics and modern Christmas tunes", and was produced by Simon Hill and Rob May, who had previously produced Talbot's debut album, "Over the Rainbow". Big band arrangements on the album included music from Laurence Cottle Big Band, while the orchestral sections of the more traditional songs were performed by the Bulgarian Symphony Orchestra. The duet on "When a Child Is Born" was performed by Talbot and Ginger Kwan. Describing the recording of the album, Talbot said "I really liked it. I liked all the songs they picked and everything. It was really good and enjoyable." Five tracks ("Let it Snow!", "Rocking Around the Christmas Tree", "Jingle Bell Rock", "Santa Clause Is Coming to Town" and "Frosty the Snowman") were recorded in the style of a big band, while the remainder were recorded in a "more traditional" style.
"Connie Talbot's Christmas Album" was released on 24 November 2008. The album was difficult to obtain in Britain after the distributor, Pinnacle Entertainment, went into administration. Talbot's mother, Sharon, was quoted as saying "We don't really know what's going to happen at the moment ... We think they'll probably wait and promote the album later this year. It's a shame, but they can still get the album in Asia and the US." In 2009, Talbot's third album, "Connie Talbot's Holiday Magic", was released in the United States, featuring many of the same songs as "Connie Talbot's Christmas Album", but with rerecorded vocals.
Publicity.
Before the release of the album, Talbot recorded a "secret concert" at her primary school. The documentary, "Christmas with Connie", was shown on ITV Central on 18 December. Talbot appeared at Walsall's HMV branch the day after the release to sign copies of the album and meet fans. After the release, Talbot embarked on a promotional tour that made stops around the world, including a performance at Ewha Womans University in Korea, where "Over the Rainbow" had sold over 30,000 copies. Talbot also performed on the A Heart for Children television charity gala in Berlin, Germany, where her performance was described by Viktoria Schiller, writing for "The Epoch Times", as "one of the highlights of the evening". Talbot returned home in mid-December, to have "a quiet family Christmas". Plans were made for a promotional trip to the US in 2009.
Critical reception and sales.
Ruth Harrison, writing for "FemaleFirst" magazine, gave the album 4/5, saying that Talbot has "a great voice when it comes to swing, but lets us down in parts". Harrison said that Talbot struggled with the "rock sound" associated with "Merry Christmas Everybody", but said that the vocals on "Ave Maria" are "incredible", and that the bonus tracks "really are a bonus". The "Leicester Mercury" published a review from a nine-year old critic, Natasha Dattani, who said that Talbot "has a nice voice, it's very cute", and added that "older people, like grandparents, will really like" the album. James Whittle, writing for the "South China Morning Post", described the album as "chock-a-block with old-time favourites", calling Talbot "sweet-voiced".
Despite the problems in the United Kingdom, which left hundreds of copies of the album in warehouses, Amy Bowen of the "Walsall Advertiser" wrote that the album was proving successful in Asia. In its first week of release, "Connie Talbot's Christmas Album" sold 4,551 copies worldwide, and, as of December 2009, it has sold 14,913.
Track listing.
This is the main track listing as given by Allmusic. The ordering of both the main and bonus tracks varies between releases, and different releases have different bonus tracks. For example, the Hong Kong release contained only the bonus tracks "Silent Night" and "White Christmas".

Bhayanak Maut

Bhayanak Maut is an Indian metal band from Mumbai. The band's name was inspired by a Ramsay Brothers’ Hindi horror movie of the same name, which it translates to "Horrific Death". Although the band claims their name is inspired from a Ramsay brothers movie, there is no such movie that goes by the name of Bhayanak Maut. Their music is an eclectic mix of groove metal, hardcore and death metal.
History.
Bhayanak Maut formed in November 2003. The band originally started out as a parody outfit until they reached the finals at a competition in Chennai. The band was formed and named by Jaison and Sriram who recruited several members including Sera Kattoua Aman, Ravi Balakrishnan, Baba and Rahul to join the band. Baba is the only remaining member of the original lineup. The band regularly has jam sessions at N.O.C. The Jam Studio in Mumbai. The band is currently in the process of recording their third full length release. 
Performances.
Having been on the Indian rock scene for close to nine years, Bhayank Maut (or BM for short) as it is known as among its fans has played at college fests such as Oasis-BITS Pilani, RAIT Horizons, IIT Chennai – Saarang (Finalists), NLS Strawberry Fields Bangalore, and Goa's Waves Festival. The band also had numerous gigs at venues like Cyclone, Pune. They played at the first gig at Razzberry Rhinoceros and second at SIES Sion college festival. However, the first gig with Vinay as the front man was JRO 2004 and they also came third at Blitzkrieg 2004 – the IIT Delhi competition.
Another highlight in the band’s meteoric rise has been playing at GIR in 2007 in New Delhi alongside Norwegian band, Enslaved.
Their biggest break yet came in 2007 when they reached the finals of Garnier Fructis presents Channel V Launchpad live at Hard Rock Café, held at Pragati Maidan in New Delhi. In November 2008, Bhayanak Maut played on stage at the Great Indian Rock (GIR) show at Mumbai alongside Satyricon and Sahg, and received good reviews for their performance in GIR Shillong too.
Jai Row Kavi took over as Bhayanak Maut's drummer in August 2009 as Rahul Hariharan decided to take a year off and complete his Master's degree in the UK.
With Jai filling in for Rahul, Bhayanak Maut played at GIR 2009 in Pune and Delhi sharing stage with Norway's Benea Reach. On December 5, 2009, Bhayanak Maut shared the stage with Holland's Textures and Sweden's Amon Amarth at Deccan Rock 2009 in Bangalore, India.
In early 2010, vocalist Vinay Venkatesh decided to only work with the band on their studio projects; however he returned to the band full-time after a month long hiatus. 
Rahul Hariharan returned to India in October and the Band released its second E.P., 'Metastasis', which released on the 20th of October, 2010.
The band performed at the Inferno Festival 2011 Oslo, Norway, where they shared the stage with big names such as Meshuggah, Immortal, Napalm death, Immortal, Soilent Green, Exhumed, Today is the Day, Insense, Malevolent creation, and more. 
On November 27 they played in Chitrakoot Grounds Andheri West for 26th Independence Rock Fest in MUMBAI. http://www.independencerock.in/
The band has shared the stage with many international bands such as Satyricon, Megadeth, Meshuggah, Textures, Sahg, Benea Reach, Intronaut, and Amon Amarth.
Releases.
Bhayank Maut have released two albums – "Hell Is All People" (2004) and "Malignant" (2006). Both the albums were well received by metal fans all over India. Bhayanak Maut have been featured in a compilation album called "Fine Tuned Disasters". The album was released on August 6, 2006. The album showcased close to 20 songs from BM and other Mumbai bands like Scribe, Skincold, Amidst the Chaos, Bitchslap and Pin Drop Violence. The CD contains the following Bhayanak Maut tracks (three of which are brand new) — "Boiled Unwound Filatured", "Pica", "Phlegm Blot Technik" and "Elcit Set Nois Rot."
They released their second full length studio album, which is untitled, on August 4, 2009 through Grey and Saurian Records, Delhi.

Hands Off the People of Iran

 
Hands Off the People of Iran (HOPI) is a leftist anti-war group led mostly by exiled Iranian and British socialists, based in the United Kingdom. It is opposed to Western military intervention in Iran, which it considers imperialist. It also criticises the government of Iran, while advocating radical anti-government secularist groups in that country. The organisation's chair is Iranian exile Yassamine Mather of the Centre for the Study of Socialist Theory and Movements at the University of Glasgow.
Formation.
The initiative for Hands Off the People of Iran came from a number of Iranian exile organisations in 2005. On March 16, 2006, Workers Left Unity - Iran wrote an open letter to the British anti-war movement, calling for genuine solidarity with the Iranian people. By 2007 HOPI was fully established, consisting predominantly of Iranian exiles who campaign for regime change in Iran but are against external military intervention, believing military occupation to be the worst condition under which liberation can be achieved. HOPI's founding conference was held in December 2007.
At the Founding Conference, a National Steering Committee was established consisting of seventeen members from a range of different political organisations and political traditions. These include members of the Green Party of England and Wales, Labour Representation Committee, Jewish Socialist Group, Permanent Revolution, Centre for the Study of Socialist Theory and Movements at the University of Glasgow, Communist Party of Great Britain (Provisional Central Committee), Workers Left Unity - Iran, Revolutionary Workers of Iran, Anarchist Federation (pc) and Women’s Campaign Against All Misogynist Laws in Iran.
An Irish branch of HOPI, chaired by Anne McShane, organised a protest outside the Iranian Embassy in Dublin in June 2009.
Expulsion from Stop the War Coalition.
Shortly before Stop the War Coalition's 2007 AGM, HOPI, alongside another organisation Communist Students, was denied affiliation with the Coalition.
Affiliates and Supporters.
Prominent affiliates or supporters of HOPI include the Public and Commercial Services Union; ASLEF, the train drivers' union and Peter Tatchell.

"Ender's Game" is a series of comic book adaptations of science fiction novels written by Orson Scott Card published by Marvel Comics that began in October 2008. However, some have been all new content, not released before in novel format. The series, like the novels they are based on, are set in a future where mankind is facing annihilation by an aggressive alien society, an insect-like race known colloquially as "Buggers" but more formally as "Formics". The central character, Andrew "Ender" Wiggin, is one of the child soldiers trained at Battle School (and eventually Command School) to be the future leaders of the protection of Earth. The year is never specified, although the ages of the Wiggin children are specified to change throughout space, also carefully taking in the relativity of space and time.

Recycling in Japan

Container and Packaging Recycling Law.
Also called "Law for the Promotion of Sorted Collection and Recycling of Containers and Packaging", has been enforced in April 1997 by the Ministry of the Environment to reduce the waste of glass containers, PET bottles and paper cartons. Since April 2000 plastic containers and packages other than PET bottles have been included. According to the law, the recycling is conducted by the , a government-designated organization established September 25, 1996.
Recycling of steel cans is not regulated by the law, but in 2006 about 99% of the municipalities collected and recycled them. In 1973 the , a non-profit organization to promote the recycling of steel cans, had been established. According to its statistics 88.1% of steel cans have been recycled in 2006, maintaining the world's highest level.
Recycling plans.
On March 25, 2008 the Japanese Cabinet approved a plan that targets to reduce the total waste from about 52 million tons in 2007 to about 50 million tons in 2012 and to raise the waste recycling rate from 20 to 25%. Thermal recycling and a charging system for waste disposal services will be promoted.
3R Initiative.
This G8 initiative, first proposed at the G8 Summit in June 2004, aims to Reduce, Reuse and Recycle waste. At the G8 Environmental Minister Meeting in Kobe on May 24-26, 2008, the ministers agreed about the "Kobe 3R Action plan". It intends to improve resource productivity, to establish an international sound material-cycle society and to bring forward 3Rs capacity in developing countries. According to this plan, Japan also announced a "New Action Plan towards a Global Zero Waste Society", aimed to establish material cycle societies internationally.
Scandals.
In January 2008 five paper companies in Japan were accused of misleading customers about the recycled paper content of their products. Oji Paper, the largest paper company in Japan, admitted that its copy and print paper contained 5 to 10% recycled paper, instead of the 50% stated. The president of Oji Paper apologized to its customers, and the president of Nippon Pages, the second largest paper company in Japan, resigned to take responsibility. The Japanese Fair Trade Commission said it would investigate.

<doc id="20235780" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20235780" title="Community Services Appeals Tribunal">
Community Services Appeals Tribunal

The Community Services Appeal Tribunal was an independent tribunal established in the State of New South Wales to deal with breaches of community welfare legislation, as well as handling appeals against licensing decisions in respect of child care services, boarding houses, and foster carers. The tribunal provided the first forum in New South Wales for alternative dispute resolution in New South Wales for resolving disputes. The tribunal replaced the Community Welfare Appeals Tribunal which was known as CWAT.
The tribunal would hear matters in an informal manner in an attempt to do justice in the matter.
The tribunal was abolished on 1 January 1999 and was replaced by the Community Services Division of the Administrative Decisions Tribunal of New South Wales.
Establishment.
The tribunal was established under section 92 of the Community Services (Complaints, Appeals and Monitoring) Act 1993 (NSW). The Governor of New South Wales could appoint a person to be the President of the tribunal. This appointment is on the recommendation of the Minister after consultation with the Community Services Review Council The appointment could be for up to five years, and the President could be re-appointed and the position was a paid appointment.
The Minister could also appoint part-time members to the tribunal after consultation with the Council. One of those part-time members could be appointed as the Deputy President of the tribunal by the Minister. At least one of the members was to be a barrister or a solicitor. A part-time member could be appointed for up to five years and could be re-appointed again. Part-time members were paid a daily remuneration.
In appointing the members, the following persons could be considered:
(a) people with knowledge of and experience in administration, child care, community services, education, law, medicine, psychology and social work;
(b) other people who the Minister considered had suitable qualifications or experience warranting their appointment. The appointment can be for up to seven years and the person can be re-appointed again for up to another seven years.
In practice, the tribunal would advertise for expressions of interests in member positions, and would select applicants based on merit. The tribunal took the view that this ensured that members were drawn from a wide pool of qualified applicants.
The President could only be removed from office for misbehaviour or incompetence, or if they obtained other full-time employment. Part-time members could be removed for any reason.
Jurisdiction.
The tribunal performed merit reviews of government administrative decisions. In other words, the tribunal would review a decision based on how a government official should have made the decision. This is in contrast to a judicial review where a judge or a court would decide whether the decision was made lawfully. There was also no fees for filing an application in the tribunal. As a result, the tribunal had an important function in making government more “open and accountable” by providing an opportunity for affected people to challenge decisions.
The tribunal had jurisdiction to hear appeals concerning Community Welfare matters., the Adoption Information Act 1990., the Adoption of Children Act 1965, and the Children(Care and Protection) Act 1987, Disability Services and Guardianship Act 1987 and Home Care Service, Act 1988.
Applications could be made by persons with a “genuine concern”. The tribunal took the view that any person directly affected by a decision, or a third party who wished to bring proceedings in the public interest, could bring a case in the tribunal. The concern had to be a concern greater than an ordinary member of the public. The tribunal would also exclude people if it considered that they were “unjustifiably interfering” with a decision.
The jurisdiction of the Tribunal is protective and its purpose is to protect the public. The object is not punitive and the Tribunal is not there to punish the physiotherapist but is there to maintain proper standards in the profession.
At the hearing.
The tribunal was required to have between three and five members present when hearing a case. At least one of the members had to be a barrister or a solicitor. As far as possible, at least one of the members had to have some expertise in the area of the case before the tribunal. The presiding member on the case was the President, or if the President was not present, the Deputy President, or a member nominated by the President.
The tribunal could make rules about the procedure to be followed in the tribunal. Additionally, the tribunal could determine any additional points of tribunal as necessary. When the tribunal was first established, the intention was to make it accessible to the general public who might be intimidated by the normal legal processes of a court. The tribunal as a result strived to be informal in its procedures. However, there was still some legalistic aspects of its procedures, and parties would engage lawyers and expert witnesses to appear in the tribunal.
Decisions of the tribunal were to be determined by a majority of the votes of the members. However, any point of law was to be determined by the member who was either a barrister or a solicitor. Where the votes were tied, the presiding member had the casting vote.
Selected decisions are available on the internet at Austlii.

John Murtagh Macrossan (judge)

John Murtagh Macrossan (12 March 1930 – 5 August 2008) was Queensland’s 16th Chief Justice and the third person from the Macrossan family to occupy that position. He was also a distinguished barrister, chancellor and judge. His grandfather John Murtagh Macrossan was Colonial Secretary for Queensland, his two uncles Hugh Denis Macrossan and Neal William Macrossan were also Chief Justice of Queensland.
Early years.
Macrossan was born on 12 March 1930 to Vincent and Dorothy Macrossan (née Brown). He was named after his grandfather of the same name who was member of the Queensland Parliament. He was educated at St Columban’s in Brisbane by the Christian Brothers. After high school, he went on to study at the University of Queensland where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts and a LLB. His mother is said to have wanted Macrossan to be a doctor whilst his father wanted him to be solicitor like himself. It was said that Macrossan was widely read, elegantly dressed and immaculately mannered.
Professional life.
He was admitted to the Queensland Bar in 1951 but appeared in Court only once before going to Oxford University. It was at this appearance where he announced appearing for the wrong party. He attended Exeter College and obtained a Bachelor of Civil Laws. He returned to Queensland in 1954 to resume his career at the Bar. He shared chambers with James Archibald Douglas. He took Silk in 1967. He became the Queensland Government’s favoured senior counsel in industrial cases against the Australian Government. He was fortunate to have the privilege of appearing in the Privy Council.
He was appointed to the Supreme Court of Queensland as a judge in 1980. His appointment was merited. His courtesy on the bench is said to have been “legendary” and he never seemed to lose his temper.
Macrossan was deputy chancellor of Griffith University from 1985. In 1988 be was appointed chancellor and continued as chancellor until 2000. He was made an honorary doctor of the university in 2001.
In 1989 he was appointed Chief Justice of Queensland following the retirement of Sir Dormer Andrews. Whilst he was not the most senior judge at the time, Justices Kelly and Connolly were near retirement, and were happy for Macrossan’s elevation.
In 1991 the Queensland Government created a separate Court of Appeal with a President. The court was created with opposition from the Supreme Court and without consultation of the Queensland legal profession. Macrossan was opposed to this course as a similar Court of Appeal set up in New South Wales led to many years of bitter feelings as judges' seniority was interfered with. The legislation setting up this court also removed some of the chief justice’s jurisdiction over that court. The work, which the new court performed, was work which the Supreme Court sitting as a Full Court traditionally. Macrossan sustained a discreet battle with the Government to rectify this, which finally occurred in 1997 after the election of a new Government. Macrossan is said to have seen this as his most significant achievement.
Another reform achieved was the termination of the creation of new Queens Counsel. Instead of the Crown appointing the leaders of the Queensland Bar, senior practitioners would be recognised by the title of Senior Counsel.
In 1993 he was made a Companion in the Order of Australia (AC) in recognition of his services to law, education and the arts. In the same year he awarded honorary Doctorate of Laws by the University of Queensland. He was to be knighted in the 1990 New Years Honours List, but the new Queensland State Government blocked this. 
He was President of the Queensland Art Gallery Society from 1978 to 1982 and was Deputy Chancellor of Griffith University from 1985. He was Chancellor of that University from 1988 to 2000. He was also involved with the Churchill Trust.
In 1997 he opposed the establishment of a Supreme Court in Cairns as he felt that there was a greater need in Brisbane for a new judge.
He retired in 1998 two years before the statutory retirement age for judges. At Macrossan’s retirement ceremony, he said that courts “must always be open to new ideas but not be driven by every wind that blows” and that the community expected stability from the judiciary.
In 2001 he was made an honorary doctor of Griffith University in recognition for his service to the University.
He married Margery Newton in 1961. Their son Mark is a barrister and playwright.
He died in Brisbane on 5 August 2008 aged 78. in Brisbane. Queensland Attorney-General Kerry Shine said of Macrossan “He was a very highly talented and respected judicial officer and barrister“ and that he had “served Queensland well”. Macrossan’s funeral was held at Our Lady of Help of Christians church.

Battle of Grunwald (banners)

The following tables list the banners of the forces participating in the Battle of Grunwald, (1410)
Poland.
The exact Order of Battle of the Polish forces is unknown. However, Ioannes Longinus in his "Historiæ Polonicæ" written after 1455 recorded 51 Polish banners, together with their descriptions, blazoning and commanders. 
This list also has some obvious errors: at the time of the battle several of the banners attributed to Poland were constituents of the Lithuanian army (e.g. Lwów, Podolia, Halicz); Coat of Arms of Lithuania was a banner exclusively of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania; arrows, axes and horseshoes are typical to Lithuanian heraldry, but not the Polish one, etc. 
It is not certain whether the list is complete. 
Lithuania.
Due to different system of feudal overlordship, as well as lack of heraldic traditions, the units of Grand Duchy of Lithuania were all grouped under banners of two types: the Coat of Arms of Lithuania and the Columns of Gediminas. The only difference between various lands using the same emblem was the blazon. The hareness and the colour of the horse on the Coat of Arms of Lithuania differed. 
Note that the number of Lithuanian banners is uncertain. According to Ioannes Longinus there were 40 banners on the right flank of the Polish-Lithuanian forces, 10 flying the Columns of Gediminas and 30 flying Coat of Arms of Lithuania. However, he also mentions that there might have been 2 additional banners from Smolensk and up to six additional banners of Samogitia. German authors also mention that there were three auxiliary banners of Moldavia flying their own flags. In addition, it is probable that the units from Trakai, Volhynia, Smolensk, Kiev and Navahrudak used their own emblems.

Historical Perspective.
The Maharaja: During the British regime, the Maharja used to appoint the functionaries of the state. The Rules of Management of the State of Manipur, enforced on September 14 1935, empowered the Maharaja to appoint the members of the Durbar, while a British Officer acted as the President of the Durbar. After independence, for a brief period, the Manipur State Constituent Act 1947 provided for the formation of a Manipur State Appointment Board to be the "final authority" in all matters of appointments and promotions. 
The Chief Commissioner: Following merger into the Indian Union on October 15, 1949, Manipur became a centrally administered area, and remained so till October 31, 1956. During this period, the Chief Commissioner appointed the functionaries of Manipur, subject to the control of the Central Government. 
Territorial Council: Manipur became a Union Territory under the States’ Re-Organisation Act 1956 and Constitution (Seventh Amendment) Act 1956. Under the Territorial Council Act 1956 Manipur was allowed to constitute the Territorial Council with limited administrative powers over transferred subjects and appointment of officials thereto. The Chief Commissioner, however, continued to function as the Chief appointing authority of the territory. Subsequently the Territorial Council was abolished, and Manipur was placed under the Chief Commissioner from May 11, 1963 onwards with a Territorial Legislative Assembly and a Council of Ministers to assist him. Manipur attained statehood on January 21, 1972 under the North- East Area (Re-organisation) Act 1971. 
Manipur Public Service Commission: Under Article 315(4) of the Constitution, the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) agreed to function as the Public Service Commission of the State of Manipur till October 21, 1972. 
On October 3, 1972 the Governor of Manipur issued the order of constitution of the Manipur Public Service Commission under Article 318 with one Chairman and two Members. Shri B.K. Nehru, Governor of Manipur inaugurated the office of the Manipur Public Service Commission at a glittering function on October 23, 1972 at the Gandhi Memorial Hall, Imphal. Chief Minister, Shri Alimuddin presided over the function. 
The Pioneering Brains: Shri G.B.K. Hooja MA, IAS was the inaugural Chairman of the Commission, while Shri Laishram Gopal Singh BA(Hon.), IPS and Shri Sibo Larho BA were the premiere members. Shri Karam Gourakishore Singh was the first Secretary of the Manipur Public Service Commission.
The Commission was housed in the Old Secretariat Building Complex for almost nine years; it was later shifted to the present location in January, 1981. Over the years, Manipur Public Service Commission have grown in stature with a senior IAS officer as the Secretary and an adequate number of officers and ancillary staff.
Functions of the Manipur Public Service Commission.
Article 320 of the Constitution of India lays down the functions of the State Public Service Commission. The functions of the State Public Service Commission are : 
The State Public Service Commission functions as an advisory body. It is the duty of the State Public Service Commission to advise on any matter, referred to it by the Government.

Independent Means

Independent Means is a stage play written by Stanley Houghton, a leading member of the Manchester School of dramatists.
The play was Houghton's first professional full length play which was written in 1908. Its first title was "The Unemployed", but this was changed to avoid confusion with a one-act play with a similar title. It was chosen by Annie Horniman to open the second season at the Gaiety Theatre, Manchester, on 30 August 1909. It was an immediate success and was chosen to open the next two seasons, and it was published in 1911. It was broadcast by Granada Television in 1960. Otherwise the play remained unknown until it was "discovered" in the British Library by Chris Honer, artistic director of the Library Theatre, Manchester. It was decided to produce the play at the Library Theatre in 2008 to celebrate the centenary of the Gaiety Theatre.
Plot.
The play is set in the fictional town of Salchester (an amalgam of Salford and Manchester) in the 1900s. John and Sidney Forsyth have returned early from their honeymoon to John’s home where his parents, Edgar and Mrs Forsyth are surprised to see them. Jane the maid prepares a room for them, and Samuel Ritchie, a family friend and owner of a business retailing cars, visits for dinner. Edgar is a rich man, living on his investments and spending much time with friends in the club. One of his major investments has not been doing well recently but the other has been making up for it. John has been to university but has no specials skills, other than messing about with motor cars, and expects to become an MP. His courtship with Sidney had been only for three months and during that time he had not discovered that her political opinions were very different from his; he is a Conservative; she is a left-wing suffragette. They argue, and she is determined to have a life of her own, despite John’s strong objections. A year later, Edgar’s other investment has failed and he is a ruined man. Ritchie offers to help, but is rebuffed and vows never to enter the house again. Jane announces that she has been left a bequest of £20,000 from an uncle in Australia, and leaves her job.
Three months later, despite Edgar’s desperate attempts to speculate, the house and its contents are up for sale. Jane appears, dressed in her finery. Edgar returns from the pub, drunk and argues with everyone. Ritchie calls in, says he has bought the house and offers Sidney a job as a shorthand typist, which she accepts. When John hears of this he forbids her to take up the job, but Sidney insists and she and John separate. Meanwhile Edgar has collapsed and died. A further three months pass, Sidney is working for Ritchie and living in Jane’s house. John and his mother are in lodgings. John has been trying for months to get a job, without success. He goes to Ritchie, who gives him a job as a car salesman; then discovers that Sidney is also working there and is furious. Jane appears to buy a car. Sidney announces that she is pregnant; she and John are reconciled to return to live together and to both work for Ritchie.

John Alexander Fuller Maitland

John Alexander Fuller Maitland (7 April 1856 – 30 March 1936) was an influential British music critic and scholar from the 1880s to the 1920s. He encouraged the rediscovery of English music of the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly Henry Purcell's music and English virginal music. He also propounded the notion of an English musical renaissance in the second half of the 19th century, particularly praising Charles Villiers Stanford and Hubert Parry.
Fuller Maitland was criticised for his failure to acknowledge the talents of the English composers Arthur Sullivan, Edward Elgar and Frederick Delius, and later it was shown that he had falsified the facts in a critique of Sullivan. He was also slow to recognise the worth of contemporary composers from mainland Europe such as Claude Debussy and Richard Strauss.
Biography.
Fuller Maitland was born at 90 Gloucester Place, Portman Square, London, the son of John Fuller Maitland and his wife Marianne ("née" Noble). He attended Westminster School for three terms, but for most of his childhood he was educated privately, including musical instruction. Starting in 1875, he studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was active in the Cambridge University Musical Society. There he became friends with Charles Villiers Stanford and William Barclay Squire, whose sister Charlotte he married in 1885. He had intended to follow a career in the Church of England but decided to instead to pursue a career in music. After leaving Cambridge he studied the piano with Edward Dannreuther and other aspects of music with W. S. Rockstro, who encouraged him to explore early polyphonic music.
Music journalism.
Fuller Maitland became a musical journalist, as a critic for the "Pall Mall Gazette" from 1882, later for "The Guardian" (1884–89) and "The Times" (1889–1911). He also wrote many entries for "Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians" and was appointed editor of the second edition. A later editor of the Dictionary wrote of him, "In particular, he added an important and substantial series of articles on medieval liturgical subjects … was quite traditional in his own interests: he wrote a great deal on Bach and on the more conservative German music of the 19th century, and, as an active editor of the earlier music of his own country – the complete Purcell edition, English virginal music, and (again a child of his times) English folksong – he was in the mainstream of the scholarly activity of his day." More than a hundred of his articles survive, in revised form, in the online version of Grove available in 2010.
In pioneering the revival of the virginals, Fuller Maitland published an edition of the "Fitzwilliam Virginal Book" (1894–9). He was a member of the editorial committee of the Purcell Society, for which he edited several of Purcell's works. With his relative Lucy Broadwood, he edited the collection "English County Songs" (1893), and he was on the original committee of the Folk Song Society, founded in 1898.
Reputation as a critic.
At a time when music lovers generally admired either Richard Wagner or Johannes Brahms but not both, Fuller Maitland, according to the obituary notice in "The Times", "worshipped" both Wagner and Brahms. As regards English music, he was the principal exponent of the doctrine that music had long been moribund in England until the second half of the 19th century when, he maintained, it experienced a renaissance led by his favoured composers. His book "English Music in the XIXth Century" is subdivided into two parts: "Book I: Before the Renaissance (1801-1850)", and "Book II: The Renaissance (1851-1900)". He used the phrase "English music" to include that of the Irish Stanford, whom, together with Hubert Parry, Fuller Maitland regarded as leading the "English musical renaissance". Stanford and Parry were both upper-middle-class Oxbridge graduates, like Fuller Maitland, and both were professors at music colleges. The writer Meirion Hughes describes Fuller Maitland's world as one of insiders and outsiders. Fuller Maitland rejected British composers who did not conform to his template. "Sullivan's frequent forays into what was viewed as the questionable realm of operetta removed him from the equation at once. Elgar was never a contender, with his unacademic, lower-middle-class background coupled with progressive tendencies, while "Fritz" Delius was simply not English enough." The same writer suggests that Fuller Maitland's aversion to Sir Frederic Cowen was due to anti-Semitism.
Fuller Maitland's integrity as a critic came under scrutiny, notably by Elgar in a lecture in 1905. Fuller Maitland had published a denigrating obituary of Sullivan in the "Cornhill Magazine", which Elgar alluded to as "the shady side of musical criticism … this foul, unforgettable episode." Later, it was shown that Fuller Maitland had falsified the facts, inventing a banal lyric, passing it off as genuine and condemning Sullivan for supposedly setting such inanity.
Later years.
Fuller Maitland gave up journalism in 1911, retiring to Borwick Hall near Carnforth in Lancashire. He continued to write books, including an autobiography, "A Door-Keeper of Music" (1929), in which he admitted that he had been wrong in earlier years to dismiss Sullivan's comic operas as "ephemeral". His aversion to modern music abated in his later years, and he recognised the importance of composers such as Richard Strauss and Claude Debussy. He received an honorary DLitt from Durham University in 1928.
Fuller Maitland's wife died in 1931. There were no children of the marriage. He died at Borwick Hall at the age of 79. His personal fortune was assessed at £38,477 (equivalent to about £2 million in 2010).

Lucius Curtis

Admiral of the Fleet Sir Lucius Curtis, 2nd Baronet, KCB (3 June 1786 – 1869) was a senior officer of the Royal Navy during the nineteenth century. The son of Sir Roger Curtis, 1st Baronet, Lord Howe's flag captain at the Glorious First of June, Lucius served during the Napoleonic Wars and was heavily involved in the Mauritius campaign of 1810. During this campaign, Curtis commanded the frigate HMS "Magicienne" with the blockade squadron under Josias Rowley and was still in command when the ship was destroyed at the Battle of Grand Port. "Magicienne" grounded on a coral reef early in the engagement and despite the best efforts of Curtis and his crew, the ship had to be abandoned, Curtis setting her on fire to prevent her subsequent capture.
After Curtis was freed from captivity in December 1810, he was cleared of any wrongdoing in the loss of his ship and returned to his naval career. He later rose to become an Admiral of the Fleet. As his eldest son predeceased him, the baronetcy in 1869 passed to his second son, Arthur.
Life.
Lucius Curtis was born in 1786, the second son of Captain Roger Curtis and his wife Jane Sarah Brady. At a young age Curtis joined the Royal Navy, by which time his father was an admiral and a senior but controversial figure in the Admiralty. Roger Curtis had been flag captain to Lord Howe at the Glorious First of June, and became closely associated with the perceived injustices in the distribution of awards in the aftermath of the battle. Curtis further infuriated some of his fellow officers by acting as prosecutor at the court martial in which Anthony Molloy was criticised for his conduct during the Atlantic Campaign of May 1794. Molloy was effectively forced out of the Navy and Curtis attracted a significant amount of criticism, especially from Cuthbert Collingwood, who took a personal dislike to Lucius' father.
In 1802, Curtis' elder brother, also named Roger, died suddenly in naval service. As the remaining son, Lucius received strong patronage due to his family links and as a result was a post captain by 1809, aged only 24. Curtis took command of the frigate HMS "Magicienne", with orders to operate in the Indian Ocean as part of the squadron attempting to blockade the French held islands of Île Bonaparte and Isle de France (now Mauritius). Arriving during hurricane season in December 1809, Curtis had an immediate impact, sighting, chasing and capturing the East Indiaman "Windham", previously captured by the French Commodore Jacques Hamelin at the Action of 18 November 1809.
In 1810, "Magicienne" remained off the islands, participating in the Invasion of Île Bonaparte in July and subsequently supporting Captain Samuel Pym off Grand Port. Pym was intending to blockade the harbour to French shipping, but when a squadron under Guy-Victor Duperré arrived off the port on 20 August, Pym sought to lure them into coastal waters and engage them. Duperré successfully broke through Pym's ships however, and took shelter within the harbour. Pym gathered his frigates together and sailed directly into the harbour on 22 August to engage the French. Lacking harbour pilots, Pym's HMS "Sirius", Henry Lambert's HMS "Iphigenia" and "Magicienne" were soon aground on the coral reefs that sheltered the bay, and the remaining British ship, Nesbit Willoughby's HMS "Nereide", was forced to surrender by the French frigates in the port. Of the grounded ships, only "Iphigenia" sailed again, captured by Hamelin five days later. "Sirius" and "Magicienne" were burnt, their crews taking shelter on the tiny Île de la Passe. Without food or fresh water, the sailors were forced to surrender to Hamelin when he arrived and were held prisoner until Isle de France was captured by a British expeditionary force four months later.
Curtis was completely exonerated at the court martial convened to investigate the loss of his ship, given command of the newly captured HMS "Madagsacar" and continued to rise in the navy, being made a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1815. In 1862, Curtis became a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. He become an Admiral of the Fleet, the highest rank in the navy, in 1864.
Curtis died in 1869. his eldest son had predeceased him, and the baronetcy he inherited from his father passed to his second son Arthur.
Curtis was an eminent freemason, serving as Provincial Grand Master for the Province of Hampshire from 1840 until his death in 1869.

John Mgwensi Mametsa (born 28 March 1983 in Polokwane) is a South African rugby union player, the first black South African to have appeared in 100 Currie Cup games.
Starting as a junior with the Gauteng franchise the Vodacom Blue Bulls in 2001, Mametsa has since appeared for the Bulls in the Vodacom Cup, the Currie Cup, and the Super 14 series, usually on the wing.
Making his Currie Cup debut in 2002, Mametsa was named Currie Cup player of the year in 2003. During his 100th game against the Lions at Ellis Park Stadium on 21 June 2008, he scored three tries for the Bulls, and went on to score the most tries (7) by any Bulls player that year. He was part of the Blue Bulls team that won the Currie Cup in 2003 and 2004, and that shared the trophy with the Vodacom Cheetahs in 2006.
In 2008 he made his debut in the Super 14 series, winning 3 caps, having previously played in the 2004 Super 12 competition.
On 18 October 2008, one week prior to the Absa Currie Cup final in which he was to play on the losing side against the Natal Sharks, Mametsa was assaulted by traffic police and arrested for seven hours. Mametsa had intervened on behalf of team-mate Fudge Mabeta, an occasional lock for the Bulls, who had allegedly reversed his car into a traffic official’s vehicle. All charges against Mametsa were withdrawn in the Hatfield Community Court on 2 June 2009.
By 30 July 2009 Mametsa had played 120 games for the Bulls in the Currie Cup competition, scoring 320 points. His 64 career tries placed him third on the list of all-time tries scored by Blue Bulls players, and he is 12th on the Bulls' list of most career matches.

Bottle tops

Bottle Tops is a device that snaps on to most 12 & 16 ounce aluminum cans and turns it into a resealable container. It purports to also keep carbonation in the can, though that is disputable. The product is currently marketed by Telebrands, one of the leading Direct-response marketing companies.
Background and "Snap Capp".
Originally named the Snap Capp the product was invented in Medford, Oregon, by Carl Stufflet, a heating and air-conditioning service manager who became frustrated over repeatedly spilling his beer during a Disc golf competition. While camping later that day, Mr. Stufflet took out a knife and cut off the top of his plastic Pepsi bottle and melted it onto his can with a lighter, thereby creating the first Snap Capp.
The caps were one of the first PET plastics (polyethylene terephthalate) to ever be injection molded, and the first prototype was done by a company located out of Hemet, California named Ramko Manufacturing. Because of the extreme heating and cooling in the process, the molds were made with Beryllium inserts.
The exclusive rights to market the caps were obtained by Allen Vallarta Wholesale, LLC in the summer of 2007, a company led by Bill Allen, a former Coca-Cola manager. Under Mr. Allen's directions, a handful of front line wholesalers such as Jeff Hammers, Steve Farrell and Bill Banta took the product to thousands of stores, such as Walgreens, Bed Bath & Beyond and Pilot Travel Centers.
In the fall of 2008, the U.S. Army purchased 150,000 "Army Strong" logoed caps for their recruiters to use as a promotional tool, which gave the new product serious validity as a strong new product line.
By early 2009, Allen Vallarta Wholesale was one of 50 U.S. companies to be invited to a prestigious Department of Commerce Trade Winds Forum in Warsaw, Poland, which Mr. Allen attended with his attorney, Eric Kaufman, and met with senior representatives of several European countries.
Telebrands takeover.
By the summer of 2009, Snap Capps were becoming so popular that Telebrands, arguably the largest "as seen on TV" company in America took notice. By this time, over 5 million units had already been sold in less than two years out. Over a series of meetings and negotiations, to include a meeting at 3:30 in the morning in southern Oregon with Mr. Allen and Telebrands' VP of new products, Raj Shahani, an agreement was made for Telebrands to take over marketing of the product and they renamed it the "Bottle Tops" thereafter.
Telebrands has since redesigned the lid and the product is now manufactured in China. It is currently sold in 12-packs in most stores for $9.99 and a television commercial is also running at this time.

Wonderland is the 38th album release by British composer Michael Nyman and the soundtrack to the 1999 film "Wonderland". It is the first of many collaborations of Nyman with director Michael Winterbottom. For Winterbottom, Nyman would later perform excerpts of the this score in "9 Songs", provide a score for "The Claim", and arrangements and re-used tracks for "A Cock and Bull Story". Nyman's daughter, Molly, has continued the family working relationship with Winterbottom, scoring "The Road to Guantanamo" with Harry Escott.
Nyman has said that the soundtrack to "Wonderland" is his favourite film score. The "New York Times" compared the score to that of Stewart Copeland for "Rumble Fish" and said that "the rhythms are like a clock ticking" and that it is "alternately plaintive and mournful". "The Guardian" characterized it as "sumptuous, romantic". "Senses of Cinema" said the music was "heart-wrenching, full of tragic qualities, yet also extremely light".

<doc id="20236074" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20236074" title="Information–action ratio">
Information–action ratio

The information–action ratio was a concept coined by cultural critic Neil Postman (1931–2003) in his work "Amusing Ourselves to Death". In short, Postman meant to indicate the relationship between a piece of information and what action, if any, a consumer of that information might reasonably be expected to take once learning it.
In a speech to the German Informatics Society (Gesellschaft für Informatik) on October 11, 1990 in Stuttgart, sponsored by IBM-Germany, Postman said the following: "The tie between information and action has been severed. Information is now a commodity that can be bought and sold, or used as a form of entertainment, or worn like a garment to enhance one's status. It comes indiscriminately, directed at no one in particular, disconnected from usefulness; we are glutted with information, drowning in information, have no control over it, don't know what to do with it."
In "Amusing Ourselves to Death" Postman frames the information-action ratio in the context of the telegraph's invention. Prior to the telegraph, Postman says people received information relevant to their lives, creating a high correlation between information and action: "The information-action ratio was sufficiently close so that most people had a sense of being able to control some of the contingencies in their lives” (p. 69).
The telegraph allowed bits of information to travel long distances, and so Postman claims "the local and the timeless ... lost their central position in newspapers, eclipsed by the dazzle of distance and speed ... Wars, crimes, crashes, fires, floods—much of it the social and political equivalent of Adelaide's whooping coughs—became the content of what people called 'the news of the day'" (pp. 66–67).
A low information-action ratio, therefore, refers to the helplessness people confront when faced with decontextualized information. Someone may know Adelaide has the whooping cough, but what could anyone do about it? Postman said that this kind of access to decontextualized information "made the relationship between information and action both abstract and remote." Information consumers were "faced with the problem of a diminished social and political potency."
