El Conquistador

El Conquistador is a weekly bilingual newspaper serving McHenry County, Lake County and DeKalb County, Illinois, United States.
In addition to single-copy sales, El Conquistador is popular with schools, which use it as a learning aide because all articles are published in both English and Spanish.
El Conquistador is a part of Shaw Suburban Media's NorthWest News Group and is owned by Shaw Newspapers. Shaw Suburban Media includes the Northwest Herald, Kane County Chronicle, DeKalb Daily Chronicle, Lake County Journals, Weekly Journals, The Business Journal, Great Lakes Bulletin, and McHenryCountySports.com.
History.
Laura Carrillo Barth, a long-time Elgin resident and two other investors saw the need for an English and Spanish newspaper in the Elgin area. In January 2002, Vision del Fox Valley started covering issues of interest to the Hispanic community in Elgin on a monthly basis. The slogan was "two languages, one voice."
In October 1992, Barth parted ways with her associates and expanded coverage to Aurora with the creation of Vision del Fox Valley - Aurora Edition. Operations moved to Aurora, where Vision shared office space with the Aurora Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.
In February 1993, the newspaper changed its frequency to twice a month, with plans to expand coverage beyond the Fox Valley area. The publication changed its name to El Conquistador, added the Don Quixote logo, and modified its slogan: "El Conquistador, like Don Quixote and his 'impossible dream,' seeks to conquer the barrier between two languages and between two cultures, for all Hispanics by birth and Hispanics at heart, through our articles, stories and photos, reflecting the Hispanic culture, language and, at the same time, serving the community." Circulation expanded to Rockford.
In 1995, El Conquistador moved to its own building in downtown Aurora.
In 1997, circulation was reviewed and an opportunity came to cover the Hispanic community in the growing Joliet market, located in the southwestern Chicago suburbs. The decision was made to eliminate the Rockford market. El Conquistador acquired the Latino Journal, a bilingual publication in the Joliet area. With the addition of this market, audited circulation jumped to 15,000 copies per issue.
The need for more information with shorter periods in between issues prompted the change in circulation from twice a month to weekly. The change took place with the Nov. 2, 2001 issue.
In November 2004, the newspaper underwent a design and content transformation. Sections that appeared occasionally became permanent and the publication size changed from an 11 by 17 to a 10 by 11.7' tabloid to make it more reader-friendly.
On Jan. 21, 2006, El Conquistador was acquired by the NorthWest News Group, a division of Shaw Newspapers, and a new era began, moving operations to the Kane County Chronicle building in Geneva and redesigning the newspaper. Publication size changed again, this time to 9.667 by 11.5. Changes included elimination of Joliet as a coverage area, and circulation was increased throughout McHenry County to better support the NorthWest News Group market.
In June 2006, NorthWest News Group purchased Lo Nuestro, a bilingual Hispanic publication serving DeKalb County. Lo Nuestro news and photos were blended into El Conquistador.

Lejonkulan

Lejonkulan (In English: "The Lion's Den"), was a historical theatre in Stockholm, Sweden, active in 1667–89. It is mentioned in history as the first theatre in Sweden. In 1686, it was the place of the first Swedish Theatre.
History.
Lejonkulan was a building down in and over the partly dry moat at the south corner of the royal palace Tre Kronor. From 1648, it was commonly known by the name "Lejonkulan" ("The Lion's Den"), because two lions, a tribute from the Thirty Years War, was kept there during the reign of Queen Christina of Sweden, when the building at first was erected. Just like two other buildings nearer the palace, the Little and the Great Bollhuset, it was occasionally used for theatre. 
In 1667, when the mourning period for the queen dowager-regent Hedwig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp had ended and the Swedish court exploded with parties and a search for amusement, Lejonkulan was turned into a theater and decorated as such. Foreign theater companies were hired to perform for the court, often from France, Germany and the Netherlands, as Sweden did not have any theater tradition and therefore no native actors. Plays had been performed at the universities by students long before this, though, and in 1686, the first troupe of professional Swedish actors, made of students, (all male) opened the first Swedish language theatre in Lejonkulan Theatre. 
Lejonkulan as a theatre has often been confused with Bollhuset Theatre, as the two buildings were both on and off used by the theatre during the same period. In 1689, the theatre was moved to Bollhuset, which had been used alongside Lejonkulan as an alternative theatrical space, and Bollhuset was renovated as a permanent local for the theatre in 1699. The reason for the change is unknown; some sources claim Lejonkulan burned down in 1689, while others assert that the change was made for artistic reasons. Lejonkulan burned down with the royal palace in 1697.
Actors and companies in the Theater of Lejonkulan.
The following troupes likely also performed at the theatres of Little and Great Bollhuset. 
The Dutch troupe 1667-1674.
"This troupe opened the Theater with the play "Orontes en Satira" by Magnon in February 1667." 
The Dutch troupe 1680-1684.
"This troupe performed the play "Disa" for the public in 1684, and thus, the theater is known to be more than a court theater from this point forward." 
The Swedish student-troupe from Uppsala 1686–1691.
"This (all male) troupe was made up of idealistic students. It had played in Uppsala 1682-86. They were moved to the locals in Bollhuset in 1689."

Adelheid of Meissen

Adelheid of Meissen () (c. 1160 – 2 February 1211) was the first Queen consort of Ottokar I of Bohemia.
Marriage.
Adelheid was born about 1160 as the daughter of Otto II, Margrave of Meissen. She met her future husband in the 1170s, in the time of his exile. It is possible that this marriage (1178) was forced on grounds of her pregnancy. Adelheid gave birth to a son, Vratislaus, soon.
Shortly after the marriage the couple could return to Bohemia—Ottokar's brother Frederick assumed the reins of Bohemia and Ottokar was one of the leaders of his army. In 1192 Ottokar himself became duke but in 1193 was deposed. He left Bohemia together with his family then.
Adelheid came to her brother and Přemysl Ottokar became a mercenary of German dukes. In this time the couple got estranged. Ottokar decided to solve the problem in a way exclusive to all dynastic principles.
Two Queens.
In the end of 1197 Ottokar became duke for the second time. He repudiated his wife and also his adult son. Ottokar was at least 40 at that time and risked losing the heir. Adelheid and her daughters stayed in Meissen, while her son Vratislaus became a mercenary in Germany and Italy.
In 1199, Ottokar (now the king) divorced Adelheid, on grounds of consanguinity. They were both descendants of Henry of Schweinfurt and Mieszko II Lambert and were fifth cousin once removed or fourth cousin once removed. He married Constance of Hungary, who was Ottokar's fourth cousin thrice removed, later in the same year. Adelheid did not waive her rights. In 1205 she returned to Prague for a while. Ottokar decided to marry his daughter with Adelheid, Dagmar/Markéta, to Valdemar II of Denmark in this time. However, Constance gave birth to a son, later king Wenceslaus, in 1205. Then Adelheid and her daughters left Bohemia permanently.
The pope decided that the cessation of marriage is legal. Adelheid still struggled, but in
1210 definitely lost. She died in 1211 in Meissen.

Billy Smith (ice hockey)

William John Smith, better known as Billy Smith, (born December 12, 1950) is a retired professional ice hockey goaltender and is best known for winning four Stanley Cups with the New York Islanders and being the first goalie to be credited with a goal.
Playing career.
NHL beginnings.
Smith was drafted by the Los Angeles Kings in the 5th round of the 1970 NHL Amateur Draft from the Cornwall Royals of the QMJHL. He played two seasons with the Kings' minor league affiliate, the American Hockey League's Springfield Kings, and spent a brief stint with the big-league Kings after winning a Calder Cup for Springfield in 1971.
He was drafted in the 1972 NHL Expansion Draft by the New York Islanders; he was the second player picked by the team. After sharing goaltending duties with Gerry Desjardins for two years, he got the starting job all to himself in 1974–75 when Desjardins bolted to the World Hockey Association. That season, he led the Islanders to their first playoff appearance.
Successful Islander stints.
Smith played in the 1978 All-Star Game, where he was named MVP. For the rest of the decade, he shared time in the Islanders net with Glenn Resch, where they combined to form perhaps the top goaltending duo in the NHL at the time. This changed in the 1980 playoffs, when the Isles rode Smith's goaltending to their first of four consecutive Stanley Cups, firmly establishing Smith as the team's starting goaltender. Resch was dealt to the Colorado Rockies the following season. Smith went on to become a First Team All-Star and Vezina Trophy winner in 1982. In 1983, he won the William M. Jennings Trophy for fewest goals allowed (shared with Roland Melanson). He was chosen to play for Canada in the 1981 Canada Cup, but was unable to play due to an injury sustained in a pre-tournament game.
Smith's regular season success, however, was surpassed by his performances in the playoffs, as he helped the Islanders win four straight Stanley Cups (1980–83), reach the finals five straight times (1980–84), and win a record 19 consecutive playoff series from 1980–84.
His single most famous game may be his 2–0 victory in the first game of the 1983 Stanley Cup finals against the Edmonton Oilers, shutting out the likes of Mark Messier, Wayne Gretzky, Jari Kurri, and Paul Coffey. The Islanders went on to sweep the Oilers in 4 games, with Smith allowing the Oilers only 6 goals and winning the Conn Smythe Trophy as Most Valuable Player in the Playoffs. A year later, Smith broke the record for the most Playoff victories: he led all goaltenders in playoff victories in total and in every individual year between 1980 and 1984. Then in 1985, Smith led the Islanders to win 3 straight games after being down 0–2 to the Washington Capitals, the first time such a comeback occurred in the NHL. Smith's playoff success feeds into his reputation as the supreme "money" goalie, the person you would want in net with the season on the line. Teammates and observers have said that Smith seemed able to sense when he needed to be perfect to win and when he could give up five goals and still come away with the victory.
First NHL goal by a goaltender.
Smith was also the first NHL goaltender to be credited with scoring a goal. On November 28, 1979, in a game between the Islanders and the Colorado Rockies, the Rockies' goaltender left the ice for an extra attacker after a delayed penalty call was called on the Islanders. The puck deflected off the chest protector of the Islanders' Smith into the corner. Colorado rookie Rob Ramage picked up the puck and accidentally made a blind pass from the corner boards in the opposing zone to the blue line. Nobody was there to receive the pass, and so the puck sailed all the way down the length of the ice and into the Colorado net. Smith had been the last Islander to touch the puck, and was credited with a goal.
Retirement.
Smith retired in 1989; he was the last original Islander still on the team. After four years as the Islanders' goaltending coach, he followed longtime Islander general manager Bill Torrey to the expansion Florida Panthers in the same role, serving there until 2000.
The Islanders retired his #31 on February 20, 1993. Later that year, he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, the only goalie inducted in the Hall in the 1990s. In 1998, he was ranked number 80 on "The Hockey News"' list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players.
Personality.
He was nicknamed "Battlin' Billy" or "Hatchet Man" for his fiery temper and unabashed use of the stick or blocker on players crowding his crease. 
Smith was also noted for his displays of feigned injuries that would often lead to penalties against opponents, for whom he carried an undisguised enmity. For instance, in Game Four of the 1983 Stanley Cup Finals, Smith's dive resulted in referee Andy Van Hellemond handing a five minute penalty to Glenn Anderson of the Edmonton Oilers. Van Hellemond said that this was "making a bit of a fool of me", and when he officiated Game One of the 1984 Finals, a rematch of the Islanders and Oilers, he called no penalty when Smith and Anderson collided.
Smith refused to participate in the traditional handshakes between teams at the end of a playoff series, as to not feel any worse after a loss than he already did, being very passionate about games that put the ranking of their team on the line. 
A notable incident with Smith occurred in practice where then-teammate Mike Bossy fired a shot at Smith to which Smith objected. Smith charged after Bossy with his stick but was tackled by teammates before Smith took his frustrations out on Bossy.

Gioele Dix

Gioele Dix, a pseudonym of his name David Ottolenghi (born January 3, 1956) is an Italian actor and comedian of Jewish descent.
Life.
Gioele Dix began his theatrical career at the end of the 1970s, promoting and animating the Milan stage company "Teatro degli Eguali". Among the numerous plays he took part in, are: "A Midsummer Night's Dream", a rock musical from Shakespeare directed by Gabriele Salvatores; "A Martian in Rome" by Ennio Flaiano and directed by Antonio Salines; two stagings of Molière’s, "Le Malade imaginaire" and "Tartuffe" with veteran actor Franco Parenti. Intending to pursue a career as stand-up comedian, he appeared at the Derby Club and the Zelig, important historical Milan cabarets, reaching fame in 1988 in the TV variety show Cocco by RAI2 with the character of a permanently enraged car driver ("fucking raving mad!").
In the 1990s he confirms his popularity as a stage actor, as well as a playwright, in a number of works and on TV, but often also as a comedian sending up and imitating renowned soccer players in prime-time Sports shows.
In the last few years, Dix had various movie engagements and filmed for the national TV together with Giorgio Albertazzi in 2004. Among the many theatrical works, he interpreted "Cuori pazzi (Crazy Hearts)" by F.T Altan (2000), "Il libertino (The Libertine)" by E.E. Schmitt together with Ottavia Piccolo (2001) where he is the first Italian man playing naked, "Corto Maltese" from scripts by Hugo Pratt and music by Paolo Conte. Recently he returned to the stage with "Edipo.com", directed by famous Italian star Sergio Fantoni (2003); then "La Bibbia ha quasi sempre ragione (The Bible Is Almost Always Right)" with Cesare Picco at the piano (2004), all of them "pièces" enhancing the narrative dimension of the story, thus exploiting Dix’s natural talent as a raconteur.
In 2007 he was engaged in the cast of "Zelig" (a popular comedy TV show) as one of the comedians, interpreting his now famous caricature of the "permanently enraged car driver".
In 2008 he staged "Tutta colpa di Garibaldi (It’s All Garibaldi’s Fault)" with scripts by Gioele Dix, Sergio Fantoni and Nicola Fano, directed by Sergio Fantoni; he followed with the play "Dixplay" by himself, with the participation of Bebo Best Baldan.

Selkirk (sternwheeler 1895)

Selkirk was a small sternwheel steamer that operated on the Thompson and Columbia rivers in British Columbia from 1895 to 1917. This vessel should not be confused with the much larger Yukon River sternwheeler "Selkirk".
Design and construction.
"Selkirk" was built by Alexander Watson, an experienced shipbuilder from Victoria, BC at Kamloops, BC for Harold E. Forster, a wealthy man who wanted a steamboat for private excursions in the Kamloops area. The vessel was described as top-heavy.
Operations on the Thompson River.
Forster operated "Selkirk" on the Thompson River until June 29, 1898, when 25 miles above Kamloops, "Selkirk" turned into an eddy and capsized. A number of passengers, including some children, were trapped and nearly drowned, but fortunately were rescued before the vessel sank. Three months later Forster was able to raise "Selkirk". While he was floating the vessel downstream to Kamloops for repair, the boat capsized again, and this time the deckhouse was washed away. Eventually Forster was able to return to Kamloops with the wreck of the steamer.
Transfer to the Columbia River.
Forster did nothing with the vessel until the spring of 1899, when he had "Selkirk" loaded onto two flatcars and shipped by rail to Golden, BC on the uppermost reaches of the Columbia River where the vessel was reconstructed. Forster did not however immediately place the vessel in commercial service. In 1906 gasoline engines were installed in place of the original steam engines. In 1913 "Selkirk" was sold to Capt. E.N. Russell.
Withdrawal from service.
"Selkirk" was withdrawn from the vessel register in 1917. The vessel was hauled out on the ways at Golden, where she was apparently simply abandoned.

Andrew Hawkins

Andrew Austin Wyatt Hawkins (born March 10, 1986) is an American football wide receiver for the Cincinnati Bengals of the National Football League. He previously played for the NFL's St. Louis Rams and for the Montreal Alouettes in the Canadian Football League, where he was part of back-to-back Grey Cup Championships. He played college football for the Toledo Rockets of the Mid-American Conference from 2004 to 2007.
Early career.
After attending Bishop McCort High School in his hometown of Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Hawkins chose to attend college at the University of Toledo in Ohio. Over four seasons, he played in 37 games, starting in 25. He finished his career with 67 receptions for 1,107 yards and five touchdowns. Also playing as a cornerback, he had two forced fumbles, one blocked punt and 21 tackles. He was the first two-way player at Toledo in 48 years, as he played on both offense and defense.
Professional career.
Montreal Alouettes.
Hawkins worked out with the Cleveland Browns after going undrafted in the 2008 draft. He was not signed to play in the NFL and was out of football the entire 2008 season. He then signed with the Canadian Football League's Montreal Alouettes on December 5, 2008. 
However, before his first CFL season in 2009, Hawkins went to compete on Michael Irvin's football reality show "4th and Long" to compete for a spot on the Dallas Cowboys roster. He was named the runner-up.
Hawkins then went on to play with the Alouettes for two seasons. He scored his first CFL touchdown on October 12, 2009 during a Thanksgiving Day match-up against the Calgary Stampeders. He totaled 41 receptions, 457 yards and five touchdowns in two seasons for the Alouettes, as well as being a part of the back-to-back Grey Cup championship team.
"4th and Long".
Although technically under contract with the CFL's Montreal Alouettes, Hawkins was permitted to compete as a contestant on Michael Irvin's football reality show "4th and Long". Hawkins was a runner-up to fellow receiver Jesse Holley. Hawkins was cut on the final episode along with future CFL player Ahmaad Smith.
St. Louis Rams.
On January 12, 2011, Hawkins signed a contract with the NFL's St. Louis Rams. He was waived on August 1, 2011.
Cincinnati Bengals.
The Cincinnati Bengals claimed Hawkins off waivers on August 1, 2011. He debuted for the team on August 21, 2011 in week 2 of the preseason against New York Jets, catching a 15-yard pass from Dan LeFevour. Hawkins was waived during final-day cuts on September 3 but he was re-signed to the team's practice squad the following day. Hawkins was added to the active roster after Jordan Shipley was placed on injured reserve. 
Hawkins went on to record 23 receptions for 263 yards, both fifth among the team's receivers. He also had five rushes for 25 yards converted on nine third-down situations. His on-the-field performance has made Hawkins a bit of a "fan favorite" amongst Bengals fans, who refer to him as "Baby Hawk".[http://www.bengals.com/team/roster/Andrew-Hawkins/e347e2a3-3711-437e-84f8-51d98e454b54]
He had a breakout season in 2012 for the Bengals, playing in 14 games and totaling 51 receptions for 533 yards and four touchdowns, plus six rushes for 30 yards.
In 2013, he suffered a serious ankle injury prior to the preseason and was placed on injured reserve with a designation for a possible return, meaning he could return to practice as soon as week 7 and play by week 9.
Personal life.
Hawkins is the younger brother of former NFL defensive back Artrell Hawkins. He is also the cousin of CFL slot back Geroy Simon, and former NFL offensive lineman Carlton Haselrig.
Hawkins appears as an extra in the George Clooney film, Ides of March.

Integrated circuit layout design protection

Layout designs (topographies) of integrated circuits are a field in the protection of intellectual property.
IC layout designs are usually the result of an enormous investment, both in terms of the time of highly qualified experts, and financially. 
The possibility of copying by photographing each layer of an integrated circuit and preparing masks for its production on the basis of the photographs obtained is the main reason for the introduction of legislation for the protection of layout-designs.
In United States intellectual property law, a mask work is a two or three-dimensional layout or topography of an integrated circuit (IC or "chip"), i.e. the arrangement on a chip of semiconductor devices such as transistors and passive electronic components such as resistors and interconnections. The layout is called a "mask" work because, in photolithographic processes, the multiple etched layers within actual ICs are each created using a mask, called the photomask, to permit or block the light at specific locations, sometimes for hundreds of chips on a wafer simultaneously.
Because of the functional nature of the mask geometry, the designs cannot be effectively protected under copyright law (except perhaps as decorative art). Similarly, because individual lithographic mask works are not clearly protectable subject matter, they also cannot be effectively protected under patent law, although any processes implemented in the work may be patentable. So since the 1990s, national governments have been granting copyright-like exclusive rights conferring time-limited exclusivity to reproduction of a particular layout. 
International law.
A diplomatic conference was held at Washington, D.C., in 1989, which adopted a Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect of Integrated Circuits (see IPIC Treaty). The Treaty is open to States Members of WIPO or the United Nations and to intergovernmental organizations meeting certain criteria.
The Treaty has been incorporated by reference into the TRIPS Agreement of the World Trade Organization (WTO), subject to the following modifications: the term of protection is at least 10 (rather than eight) years from the date of filing an application or of the first commercial exploitation in the world, but Members may provide a term of protection of 15 years from the creation of the layout-design; the exclusive right of the right-holder extends also to articles incorporating integrated circuits in which a protected layout-design is incorporated, in so far as it continues to contain an unlawfully reproduced layout-design; the circumstances in which layout-designs may be used without the consent of right-holders are more restricted; certain acts engaged in unknowingly will not constitute infringement. TRIPS Articles
The Treaty on Intellectual Property in respect of Integrated Circuits, also called Washington Treaty or IPIC Treaty (signed at Washington on May 26, 1989) is currently not in force, but was partially integrated into the TRIPS agreement.
Article 35 of TRIPS in Relation to the IPIC Treaty states:
Members agree to provide protection to the layout-designs (topographies) of integrated circuits (referred to in this Agreement as “layout-designs”) in accordance with Articles 2 through 7 (other than paragraph 3 of Article 6), Article 12 and paragraph 3 of Article 16 of the Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect of Integrated Circuits and, in addition, to comply with the following provisions.TRIPS Document
Article 2 of the IPIC Treaty gives the following definitions:
“(i) ‘integrated circuit’ means a product, in its final form or an intermediate form, in which the elements, at least one of which is an active element, and some or all of the inter-connections are integrally formed in and/or on a piece of material and which is intended to perform an electronic function,
(ii) ‘layout-design (topography)’ means the three-dimensional disposition, however expressed, of the elements, at least one of which is an active element, and of some or all of the interconnections of an integrated circuit, or such a three-dimensional disposition prepared for an integrated circuit intended for manufacture ... ”
Under the IPIC Treaty, each Contracting Party is obliged to secure, throughout its territory, exclusive rights in layout-designs (topographies) of integrated circuits, whether or not the integrated circuit concerned is incorporated in an article. Such obligation applies to layout-designs that are original in the sense that they are the result of their creators’ own intellectual effort and are not commonplace among creators of layout designs and manufacturers of integrated circuits at the time of their creation.
The Contracting Parties must, as a minimum, consider the following acts to be unlawful if performed without the authorization of the holder of the right: the reproduction of the lay-out design, and the importation, sale or other distribution for commercial purposes of the layout-design or an integrated circuit in which the layout-design is incorporated. However, certain acts may be freely performed for private purposes or for the sole purpose of evaluation, analysis, research or teaching.
National laws.
USA.
The United States Code (USC) defines a mask work as "a series of related images, however fixed or encoded, having or representing the predetermined, three-dimensional pattern of metallic, insulating, or semiconductor material present or removed from the layers of a semiconductor chip product, and in which the relation of the images to one another is such that each image has the pattern of the surface of one form of the semiconductor chip product" [(17 U.S.C. § 901(a)(2))]. Mask work exclusive rights were first granted in the US by the Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984.
According to , rights in semiconductor mask works last 10 years. This contrasts with a term of 95 years for modern copyrighted works with a corporate authorship; alleged infringement of mask work rights are also not protected by a statutory fair use defense, nor by the typical backup copy exemptions that provides for computer software. Nevertheless, as fair use in copyrighted works was originally recognized by the judiciary over a century before being codified in the Copyright Act of 1976, it's possible that the courts might likewise find a similar defense applies to mask work.
The non-obligatory symbol used in a mask work protection notice is Ⓜ (M enclosed in a circle; Unicode code point codice_1 or HTML numeric character entity codice_2) or *M*.
The exclusive rights in a mask work are somewhat like those of copyright: the right to reproduce the mask work or (initially) distribute an IC made using the mask work. Like the first sale doctrine, a lawful owner of an authorized IC containing a mask work may freely import, distribute or use, but not reproduce the chip (or the mask). Mask work protection is characterized as a "sui generis" right, i.e., one created to protect specific rights where other (more general) laws were inadequate or inappropriate.
Note that the exclusive rights granted to mask work owners are more limited than those granted to copyright or patent holders. For instance, modification (derivative works) is not an exclusive right of mask work owners. Similarly, the exclusive right of a patentee to "use" an invention would not prohibit an independently created mask work of identical geometry. Furthermore, reproduction for reverse engineering of a mask work is specifically permitted by the law. As with copyright, mask work rights exist when they are created, regardless of registration, unlike patents, which only confer rights after application, examination and issuance.
Mask work rights have more in common with copyrights than with other exclusive rights such as patents or trademarks. On the other hand, they are used alongside copyright to protect a read-only memory (ROM) component that is encoded to contain computer software.
The publisher of software for a cartridge-based video game console may seek simultaneous protection of its property under several legal constructs:
Ordinary copyright law applies to the underlying software (source, binary) and original characters and art.
But the expiration date for the term of "additional" exclusive rights in a work distributed in the form of a mask ROM would depend on an untested interpretation of the originality requirement of § 902(b):
(b) Protection under this chapter (i.e., as a mask work) shall not be available for a mask work that—
Under one interpretation, a mask work containing a given game title is either entirely unoriginal, as mask ROM in general is likely a familiar design, or a minor variation of the mask work for any of the first titles released for the console in the region.
Other.
Equivalent legislation exists in Australia, India and Hong Kong.
In Canada these rights are protected under the Circuit Topography Act (1990, c. 37).
In the European Union, a "sui generis" design right protecting the design of materials was introduced by the Directive 87/54/EEC which is transposed in all member states.
India has the Semiconductor Integrated Circuits Layout Design Act, 2000 for the similar protection.
Japan relies on the "The Act Concerning the Circuit Layout of a Semiconductor Integrated Circuit".
Brazil has enacted Law No. 11484, of 2007, to regulate the protection and registration of integrated circuit topography.

Japan Median Tectonic Line

, also Median Tectonic Line (MTL), is Japan's longest fault system. The MTL begins near Ibaraki Prefecture, where it connects with the Itoigawa-Shizuoka Tectonic Line (ISTL) and the Fossa Magna. It runs parallel to Japan's volcanic arc, passing through central Honshū to near Nagoya, through Mikawa Bay, then through the Inland Sea from the Kii Channel and Naruto Strait to Shikoku along the Sadamisaki Peninsula and the Bungo Channel and Hōyo Strait to Kyūshū.
The sense of motion on the MTL is right-lateral strike-slip, at a rate of about 5–10 mm/yr. This sense of motion is consistent with the direction of oblique convergence at the Nankai Trough. The rate of motion on the MTL is much less than the rate of convergence at the plate boundary, making it difficult to distinguish the motion on the MTL from interseismic elastic straining in GPS data.
Notable Earthquakes.
The Great Hanshin earthquake occurred on the Nojima Fault, a branch of the MTL. Approximately 6,434 people lost their lives; about 4,600 of them were from Kobe. It caused approximately ten trillion yen ($100 billion) in damage, 2.5% of Japan's GDP at the time.
Museum.
There is a museum dedicated to the tectonic line in Minami-Alps, Yamanashi.

William Siborne

William Siborne, Sibourne or Siborn (15 October 1797 – 9 January 1849) was a British officer and military historian whose most notable work was a history of the Waterloo campaign.
Early life.
William Siborne was the son of Benjamin Siborne, a captain in the 9th (East Norfolk) regiment born in Greenwich circa 1771. His father had been wounded at the battle of Nivelle in the Peninsular War. William Siborne graduated from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst in 1814, having been commissioned as an ensign in the same regiment (renamed the 9th Regiment of Foot in 1782) on 9 September 1813, before it joined the 2nd battalion at Canterbury then Chatham and finally Sheerness in 1815.
Military career.
In August 1815, he was sent to France to join the Duke of Wellington's army of occupation, doing duty in the Camp of Boulogne, near Paris. He obtained the rank of lieutenant in November 1815, but was put on half pay from March 1817, when his regiment was reduced to one battalion. In September 1820, he undertook a secret mission in Germany on behalf of the Treasury.
Two years later, he published his first book, "Instructions for Civil and Military Surveyors in Topographical Plan-drawing".
In July 1824, he married Helen Aitken, daughter of a Scottish banker and colonel of the militia. They subsequently had a son and daughter.
On 11 November 1824, he was gazetted to the 47th (Lancashire) regiment, this being backdated to November 1815, and went on leave in Europe.
In March 1826, he was appointed as assistant military secretary to the Commander-in-Chief, Ireland (first Lieutenant-General Sir George Murray, then Sir John Byng, then Sir Richard Hussey Vivian and finally Sir Edward Blakeney), holding this post until 1843.
In 1827, he published his second book, "A Practical Treatise on Topographical Surveying and Drawing", which was dedicated to his commander-in-chief Sir George Murray.
History of Waterloo.
Early in 1830, Rowland Hill, 1st Viscount Hill, then commander-in-chief Britain, commissioned Siborne to construct a model of the battle of Waterloo. Siborne carried out extensive research, writing to officers in the allied forces present to obtain information on the positions of the troops at the crisis of the battle at 7 p.m. His attempts to get the same information from the ministry of war in Paris were politely ignored, while the Prince of Orange kindly supplied him with information on the Netherlands forces.
The replies to the circular he sent out and the subsequent correspondence amount to the largest single collection of primary source material on the subject ever assembled. The British Museum purchased the collection after his death and it is now in the British Library. He spent eight months at the farm of La Haye-Sainte surveying the entire battlefield.
The actual model took until 1838 to complete, partly because Siborne still had his main military duties to fulfill. Progress was interrupted in 1833, by the new ministry's refusal to allocate new funds. Siborne financed the model himself from then onwards.
During the construction of the Large Model, Peter Hofschroer claimed in a controversial book that Siborne earned the enmity of the Duke of Wellington, as Siborne's research called into question parts of the duke's version of events at Waterloo. This, claims Hofshroer, led to Siborne's attempts to get the government to honour its obligation to him being thwarted, his attempts to obtain his captaincy being obstructed and a smear campaign being undertaken against him. 
The final total cost was around £3000, which Siborne had considerable difficulty in recovering, as the exhibitor of its first public display in London cheated him of much of his share of the revenues. Siborne also built a smaller model of a portion of the battlefield on a larger scale. The main model was purchased by the Royal United Service Institution after his death, and is now in the Changing the World gallery at the National Army Museum, London. The smaller, or so-called New Model, is on display at the Royal Armouries Museum.
Siborne made use of the considerable amount of material he assembled to write his third book, a history of the Waterloo campaign. It was first published in 1844, and the 4th edition is still in print today.
On 31 January 1840, he purchased an unattached captaincy, although this was on half pay. He was now exhausted by his efforts but friends in the army obtained a sinecure for him as Secretary and Adjutant of the Royal Military Asylum at Chelsea. He took up his post in November 1843, where he remained until his death. He is buried at Brompton Cemetery. His second son Henry Taylor Siborne later published a selection of the letters in his collection.

Marion (sternwheeler)

Marion was a small sternwheel steamboat that operated in several waterways in inland British Columbia from 1888 to 1901.
Design and Construction.
"Marion" was built at Golden, BC in 1888 for Frank P. Armstrong by Alexander Watson, a shipbuilder from Victoria, BC. "Klahowya"'s engines were manufactured by Polson Iron Works. "Marion" had a deckhouse and a wheelhouse but no passenger cabin. Passengers simply perched wherever they could on the boat deck.
Operations in Columbia Valley.
Capt. Armstrong operated "Marion" on the uppermost reach of the Columbia River, which ran from Golden, BC south down the Columbia Valley to the headwaters of the river at Columbia Lake. Small sternwheelers like "Marion" played an important role in development by allowing miners, loggers and entrepreneurs to penetrate the region. They also established the economic viability of steamboat operations in eastern British Columbia, which led to the placement of larger steamers on the routes that the small boats had pioneered.
Transfer to Arrow Lakes.
In 1889, Armstrong had "Marion" shipped by rail on two flat cars to Revelstoke, British Columbia, an important junction where the transcontinental line of the Canadian Pacific Railway made one of its two crossings of the Columbia River. From Revelstoke, a steamboat could navigate south down the Columbia River to the Arrow Lakes and on the lakes proceed far to the south, near the international border, where spectacular mining discoveries were being made in the late 1880s. Near the southern end of the lakes was a little settlement called Sproat's Landing. Armstrong put "Marion" on the Revelstoke-Sproat's Landing route, running in opposition to the catamaran steamer "Despatch", the only other steam vessel then in operation on the Arrow Lakes.
In 1890, Armstrong sold "Marion" to Capt. Robert Sanderson, who worked the vessel on various routes out of Arrowhead, BC. (Other sources state it was Sanderson who purchased "Marion" in 1889 and had her shipped to Revelstoke.) "Marion" was used as a low-water vessel. This was important because at that time the Upper and Lower Arrow Lakes were separated by a shallow stretch of water known as the "narrows". During certain times of the year such as the later summer, water levels were low in the narrows and also on the Columbia River. Vessels with a shallow draft such as "Marion" could continue to use the water routes when vessels requiring deeper water to float in were forced to curtail operations.
Transfer to Kootenay Lake.
In 1897, the Kootenay and Arrowhead Railway, a subsidiary of the CPR announced plans to build a rail line along the course of the Lardeau River from Kootenay Lake to Upper Arrow Lake. The Great Northern Railway also began surveying the same route, with a view towards constructing a completing line on the opposite of the river.
In 1897 "Marion" was shipped to Kootenay Lake. Once on Kootenay Lake Marion was operated on the Duncan River which flows into Kootenay Lake from the north. "Marion" also provided service to Kootenay Flats at the southern end of Kootenay Lake.
Sinking.
In January 1901 "Marion" sank in a gale while moored at Kaslo, BC. In 1907 Captain Sanderson broke up the vessel and used her machinery to bore wood pipes at a mill in St. Leon, BC.

Jules Maidoff is an American artist. He was born in 1933, New York City. Since 1973 has lived and worked in Tuscany, between Florence and Pian di Sco', near Arezzo.
Biography.
Jules Maidoff was born in New York City, in 1933. He grew up in the Bronx, the descendent of a Jewish family which had immigrated to the United States. He made his studies in painting at Cooper Union and the City College of New York where he got his degree in 1956. Maidoff defines this period as the one of a Bronx emigrant in Manhattan. In 1956 and 1957 he went to Italy on a Fulbright grant and came back to do postgraduate studies at New York University in 1957-58. He held many exhibitions during this period and worked in graphic design and advertising. Many of his works are in the collections of important museums (Riverside museum, Brandeis University Museum, New York University Museum) and by many famous personalities such as Robert Joffrey, George Harrison, Ravi Shankar, Mick Jagger, (Elizabeth Sackler) and many more.
By the end of the 60's he returned to Tuscany, moving there definitely in 1973. Jules Maidoff was forty years old then and he was leaving behind his graphic design and commercial work to wholly dedicate himself to painting. In 1975 he is one of the founding members of the Studio Art centers International (SACI) in Florence where he worked as a teacher and director. Up to today jules Maidoff has held more than 100 exhibitions worldwide.

Habanot Nechama

Habanot Nechama (, "The Comfort Girls" or "The Daughters of Consolation") is an Israeli folk band. The group is composed of three female vocalists: Karolina, Dana Adini, and Yael Deckelbaum. 
They are best known for their self-titled, debut album which went platinum (over 40,000 records sold) in Israel, and their hit song "So Far".
History.
Habanot Nechama was formed in 2004 in Tel Aviv, Israel. They met each other in a local clothing store where they vented their frustrations with their careers and they decided to form the band shortly thereafter. Karolina named the band Habanot Nechama (translated in English as "The Comfort Girls") for the peace of mind that working with each other gives them.
Their self-titled, debut album was released August 2007 in Israel, where it went gold in three weeks and platinum soon after. The album, has songs in both Hebrew and English. Their sound was described as "reggae-soul-folk". After the album's success, the girls took their act on the road, touring throughout Israel and performing at several Europe summer festivals and finally to the United States, where they performed at the Radio City Music Hall and the Kodak Theatre for Israel's 60th birthday 
Solo Projects.
All three members of Habanot Nechama have other projects outside of Habanot Nechama. Karolina has performed with Lauryn Hill, The Black Eyed Peas and Erykah Badu in Israel and is starting on her own solo album. Dana Adini is an actress best known for her role on the Israeli cult show, Hashir Shelanu and in 2007, CMJ chose her to perform at their "music marathon" in New York. Yael Deckelbaum is in another band called "Yael and the Palm Trees" that performs regularly in Tel Aviv. They are in talks to release a second Habanot Nechama album.

The Police (play)

The Police is a play written by Polish playwright Sławomir Mrożek.
Written in 1958, it is Mrozek's first play and one of his most acclaimed early works. Written in the style of Theatre of the Absurd, and listed in the Martin Esslin book of the same name, it was produced at the Phoenix Theatre, New York, in 1961. A television production was aired in the U.S. in 1971 by PBS. It was directed by Christopher Loscher in 2007 at the Battersea Arts Centre in London as part of the TimeOut Critics' Choice season.
The play takes place in a mythical country where all opposition to the state has disappeared and the last remaining political prisoner is to be released. Rather than face the prospect of retiring the police force, the chief of police decides to create an enemy of the state by ordering one of his officers to commit political crimes. The absurdity of the play culminates when the characters mutually arrest each other repeatedly, in an attempt to restore order and meaning to their world.

<doc id="20166228" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20166228" title="History of the Korean language">
History of the Korean language

The Korean language is attested from the early centuries of the Common Era in Chinese script. The featural hangul script is introduced only in the Middle Korean period, in the 15th century.
The periodization of the historical stages of Korean is as follows:
Proto-Korean.
Controversy remains over the proposed classification of Korean as Altaic. Korean being a language isolate, "Proto-Korean" is not a well-defined term, referring to the language spoken in Prehistoric Korea during the Bronze and Iron Age.
The author, Homer B. Hulbert, claimed the Korean language was Ural-Altaic in his book, "The History of Korea" (1905). The classification of Korean as Altaic was introduced by Gustaf John Ramstedt (1928), but even within the Altaic hypothesis, the position of Korean relative to Japonic is unclear. A possible Korean-Japonic grouping within Altaic has been discussed by Samuel E. Martin, Roy Andrew Miller and Sergei Starostin, but others, notably Alexander Vovin, interpret the affinities between Korean and Japanese as a "sprachbund" effect.
Old Korean.
Old Korean (고대국어, 古代國語) corresponds to the Korean language from the beginning of Three Kingdoms period to the latter part of the Unified Silla period, approximately from 1st to 10th century. Use of Classical Chinese by Koreans begins in the 4th century or earlier, and phonological writing in Idu script develops by the 6th century.
It is unclear whether Old Korean may have been a tonal language. It is assumed that Old Korean was divided into dialects, corresponding to the three kingdoms. These hypothetical subdivisions of Old Korean are also known as Buyeo languages. Of these, the Silla language is the best attested due to the political domination of Unified Silla by the 7th century.
Only some literary records of Unified Silla, changed into Goryeo text, are extant and some texts (written in their native Writing system) of the Three kingdoms period are mostly available in form of inscriptions at present. Thus, the languages of the Three Kingdoms period are generally examined through official government names and local district names. 
The point at which Old Korean became Middle Korean is assessed variously by different scholars. The line is sometimes drawn in the late Goryeo dynasty, and sometimes around the 15th century in the early Joseon Dynasty. But it is usually thought that Middle Korea started at the establishment of Goryeo, and the standard language of Old Korean was changed from the Silla dialect to the Goryeo dialect. 
There is very little literature for research of Old Korean. The first texts in Old Korean written using hanja to represent the sound and grammar of the local language. 
Additional information about the language is drawn from various proper nouns recorded in Korean and Chinese records, and from etymological studies of the Korean pronunciations of Chinese characters.
Various systems were used, beginning with "ad hoc" approaches and gradually becoming codified in the scribal "idu" system and the "hyangchal" system used for poetry. These were arrangements of Chinese characters to represent the language phonetically, much like the Japanese kana.
Middle Korean.
Middle Korean (중세국어, 中世國語) corresponds to Korean spoken from the 10th to 16th centuries, or from the era of Goryeo to the middle of Joseon.
The language standard of this period is based on the dialect of Gaeseong because the new Goryeo Dynasty moved its capital city to the north area of the Korean peninsula.
One of the main sources for information on Middle Korean is the "Gyerim Ryusa" (계림류사, 鷄林類事), a collection of several hundred items of Korean vocabulary with the pronunciation indicated through the use of hanja written in 1103. From a phonologic perspective, the study of this material is limited due to logographic nature of hanja.
The Hunminjeongeum (lit. The Proper Sounds for the Instruction of the People), original name of Hangul, was made in 1443, and promulgated in September or October 1446 by Sejong the Great, the 4th king of the Joseon Dynasty. 
Hunminjeongeum was an entirely new and native script for the Korean people. The script was initially named after the publication, but later came to be known as hangul. It was created so that the common people illiterate in hanja could accurately and easily read and write the Korean language. Its supposed publication date, October 9, is now the "Hangul Day" in South Korea.
Modern Korean.
Modern Korean () corresponds to Korean spoken from the 17th century onward.
Over the decades following the Korean War and the division of Korea, North–South differences in the Korean language have developed, including variances in pronunciation, verb inflection and vocabulary.

Career.
Niestroj began his professional career with Fortuna Düsseldorf, making his debut on 26 April 1997 in a 0–5 loss at Bayern Munich, the only Bundesliga appearance of his career. He broke into the team during the 1997–98 season, scoring seven times, the best seasonal tally of his career.
After a bright start to the following campaign, he was spotted by English First Division side Wolverhampton Wanderers, who bought him in November 1998 for £500,000 as Colin Lee's first signing. He failed to make much impact though and managed just seven appearances in total (six of which came during the 1998–99 season that saw the club miss out on the play-offs on the final day).
Out of favour at Molineux, he spent the rest of his contract on loan at 1. FC Nuremberg and Greek side Iraklis Salonica. He then rejoined his former club Fortuna Düsseldorf as a free agent in January 2002, where he remained for a season-and-a-half.
He had short stays at FC Sachsen Leipzig, Icelandic side Grindavik, Preußen Münster and Greeks Panserraikos. He is currently playing for SV Straelen in the Verbandsliga Niederrhein (sixth tier).

Dada's Dance

"Dada's Dance" () is a 2008 Chinese film directed by the leading sixth generation director, Zhang Yuan. Unlike earlier films in his career, "Dada's Dance" successfully negotiated the Chinese censorship apparatus and emerged unedited and unchanged from Zhang's original cut. The film stars Li Xinyun as the titular Dada and was produced by Zhang's own Zhang Yuan Cultural Studios and the Beijing Century Good-Tidings Cultural Development Company. 
The film screened once in Beijing, China during the Beijing Screenings event on 25 September 2008 and had its international premiere at the Pusan International Film Festival on 3 October 2008.
Plot.
'When she returns to the city, things take a turn for the worse as Dada puts into motion a sequence of"Dada (Li Xinyun) is a young woman living in an unnamed central China city (filming took place in Wuhan) with her divorced mother (Gai Ke) and her mother's leering boyfriend (Wu Lanhui). Her neighbor, Zhao Ye (Li Xiaofeng) spies on her through her open window each morning as she dances to salsa music and gets ready for the day. Dada, knowing of his crush, teases him mercilessly.
Dada spends much of her time avoiding the crude passes made by her mother's boyfriend. During one of these episodes, an argument occurs and her mother's boyfriend falsely claims that Dada was adopted. Armed with this information, she drags Zhao Ye and heads south to a small village where she meets a woman who could be her birth mother.
Reception.
Shortly after the film's international premiere at the Pusan International Film Festival in October 2008, western critics seemed to have already ruled the film one of Zhang's lesser efforts. Indeed, early reviews from "Variety" and "The Hollywood Reporter" derided the film as "a notch down from best work" and "light on substance," respectively. Bloomberg News meanwhile called the film "[so safe and sedate...that it's little surprise the film cleared Chinese censors without a single cut."
However, the same critics did find aspects of "Dada's Dance" worthy of praise. The lead actress Li Xinyun was singled out as "never less than watchable," while another critic wrote that "it is the composite of both Li's and Dada's personalities that give the film its soul." Also praised was the film's music by composer Andrea Guerra, whose score was called "ethereal" by "Variety", an "unexpected treat" by "Screen Daily", and one of the film's two saving graces by Bloomberg News (the other being Li Xinyun).
As of 2012, the film has not yet been released on DVD.

Joseph H. Potter

Joseph Haydn Potter (October 12, 1822 – December 1, 1892) was a career soldier from the state of New Hampshire who served as a general in the Union Army during the American Civil War. He was twice a prisoner of war and was cited for gallantry on multiple occasions.
Early life and career.
Potter born in Concord, New Hampshire, on October 12, 1822. He was appointed to the United States Military Academy in 1839. He graduated in 1843, ranking just beneath classmate Ulysses S. Grant. For the next two years, as a second lieutenant, Potter was engaged in garrison duty. He participated in the military occupation of Texas and the Mexican War. He helped in the defense of Fort Brown and was wounded in the Battle of Monterey.
Subsequently he performed recruiting duty back in the East. Potter was promoted to first lieutenant in the 7th U.S. Infantry on October 30, 1847, and served on garrison duty until 1856, becoming a captain on January 9of that year. Potter accompanied the Utah expedition in 1858-60 and was subsequently sent back to Texas on outpost duty.
Civil War service.
When war erupted in early 1861, Potter was still stationed in Texas. He was captured by Confederates at St. Augustine Springs on July 27, 1861, and was held as a prisoner of war for more than a year. He was finally exchanged on August 2, 1862. He returned to active duty and was assigned command of the 12th New Hampshire Infantry as a colonel in the volunteer Union Army while retaining his rank of captain in the Regular Army.
Potter took part in the Maryland Campaign with the Army of the Potomac and subsequently participated in the Rappahannock Campaign that led to the Battle of Fredericksburg. During the 1863 Battle of Chancellorsville, he was wounded and captured again. His services in these two battles earned him brevet ranks of lieutenant colonel and colonel respectively in the Regular Army. While still a prisoner of war, he was also promoted to the full rank of major in the regular army on July 4, 1863.
He was exchanged in October 1863, and was then the assistant provost marshal general of Ohio until September 1864, when he was assigned a brigade in the XVIII Corps of the Army of the James. He commanded the Bermuda Hundred front during the attack on Fort Harrison.
Afterward, Potter assumed command of a brigade in the XXIV Corps and led it during the Siege of Petersburg. He continued at the front as chief of staff of the XXIV Corps from January 1865, until the surrender of General Robert E. Lee. He received the brevet of brigadier general in the United States Army on March 13, 1865, and promotion to brigadier general of volunteers on May 1, 1865.
Postbellum career.
Potter was mustered out of the volunteer service on January 15, 1866, and appointed as the lieutenant colonel of the 30th U.S. Infantry on July 28 that same year. After holding various posts in the West, he was promioted to the full rank of colonel on December 11, 1873. 
From July 1, 1877, to July 1, 1881, Potter was the governor of the soldiers' home in Washington, D. C.. He then returned to his regiment. On April 1, 1886, he was made brigadier general in the Regular Army. He then had command of the Department of the Missouri until his retirement on October 12, 1886.
Potter was a member of both the Aztec Club of 1847 and the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States.
Potter retired to Columbus, Ohio, where he died in 1892. He is buried in Green Lawn Cemetery.

Kurozuka

Story.
The series begins in 12th century Japan and centers on Kuro, a character based loosely on the legendary Japanese swordsman Minamoto no Yoshitsune. Kuro and his servant, Benkei, meet a beautiful and mysterious woman named Kuromitsu while on the run from Kuro's elder brother, who seeks his life. Kuromitsu and Kuro fall in love, but he soon discovers that she harbors a terrible secret: she is a vampiric immortal. Following an attack by his pursuers, Kuro is badly injured and must imbibe Kuromitsu's blood to save his own life. Kuro is then betrayed and attacked by Benkei, who has been subverted by a shadowy organization called the Red Army, and Kuro's head is severed, which interferes with his transformation into a fully immortal being.
Kuro loses consciousness and wakes up centuries later in a post-apocalyptic, dystopian Japan. The surviving citizens have fallen under constant oppression by the Red Army, and Kuro is quickly found and recruited by an underground revolutionary movement called Haniwa. The remaining episodes follow Kuro's fight with the Red Army and its host of elite warriors, who have been enhanced by samples of Kuromitsu's blood, and his quest to find his inexplicably lost love.
The starting plot for the series is probably inspired by Kurozuka, a 1939 Japanese dance-drama, which features a man-eating ogress named Kuromitsu, as well as the life of Minamoto no Yoshitsune.
Media.
Manga.
The Kurozuka manga was adapted from the original novel by author Baku Yumemakura and was illustrated by Takashi Noguchi. Serialized in Shueisha's Super Jump, the series spans ten volumes. The first was released in January 2003 and the last in December 2006.
Anime.
The anime adaptation of Kurozuka is produced by Madhouse and Animax. It began on October 7, 2008, on Animax. The opening theme is "SYSTEMATIC PEOPLE" by Wagdug Futuristic Unity with Maximum the Ryo of Maximum the Hormone. The closing theme is "Hanarebanare (ハナレバナレ)" by Shigi. The English dub was produced by Ocean Productions, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, using their own studio actors.

National Electrical Contractors Association

The National Electrical Contractors Association, or NECA, is a trade association in the United States that represents the $130 billion/year electrical contracting industry. NECA supports the businesses that bring power, light, and communication technology to buildings and communities. Through advocacy, education, research, and standards development, NECA works to advance the electrical contracting industry.
History.
After the invention of the electric light, a new industry sprung up to install electricity in homes and businesses. With little industry regulation or standardization, electrical projects were sometimes haphazard and regularly slow, since parts often had to be custom made for a project.
In 1901, a group of electrical contractors met at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York and organized the National Electrical Contractors Association of the United States. The organization’s first constitution stated their objectives: “The fostering of trade among electrical contractors…to reform abuses…to settle differences between its members…and to promote more enlarged and friendly discourse among its members.″
Organization.
NECA's national office is in Bethesda, Maryland, with 119 local chapters located across the United States. On the national level, NECA supports the electrical contracting industry through advocacy, education, research, and standards development. At the local level, each NECA chapter is an independently chartered organization with autonomy to elect officers, determine priorities, set member dues and service charges, and help negotiate labor agreements with their local International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) union(s).
NECA is led by a chief executive officer and an elected president, board of governors, district vice presidents, and committees.
NECA Members.
NECA represents electrical contractors from firms of all sizes, performing a range of services. While most NECA contractors are small businesses, many large, multinational companies are also members of the association. A directory of these contractors can be found at NECA Connection
NECA Programs and Services.
NECA provides members numerous services and opportunities, including advocacy, education, research, safety and standards development, as well as the annual NECA Show, the electrical construction industry's largest trade show and expo. 
Advocacy.
Labor Relations: At both the national and local levels, NECA works closely with IBEW to develop mutually acceptable national and local agreements. 
Government Affairs: NECA’s Government Affairs office focuses on legislation and regulations that would affect electrical contractors and the construction industry as a whole.
Through legislative monitoring, grassroots and constituent action, lobbying, and the $1 million-plus Electrical Construction Political Action Committee (ECPAC), NECA informs key policymakers of the views of electrical contractors. 
Research.
NECA is the founding sponsor of ELECTRI International—The Foundation for Electrical Construction, Inc. ELECTRI sponsors research by industry leaders, focused on the business and project management practices that impact electrical contractors. Topics for research include improving productivity, using project labor agreements, and benchmarking safety programs. 
Industry Information.
NECA produces numerous information resources addressing business and project management, labor relations, codes and standards, safety, marketing, government affairs and regulation, and technical issues. 
NECA's Management Education Institute (MEI) provides management education and supervisory training programs for industry leaders; NECA publishes ELECTRICAL CONTRACTOR magazine, the industry’s top source of information on electrical construction; and NECA sponsors the electrical contracting industry’s premier convention and trade show.

The plant genus Pteleocarpa has had a varied systematic history. The only member of the genus is the western Malesian tree Pteleocarpa lamponga, which has been placed within the families Icacinaceae, Cardiopteridaceae and most recently Boraginaceae. Some of the characters in the fruit are quite odd within the family Boraginaceae, and molecular investigations have shown that the genus is probably more related to the family Gelsemiaceae.

Pakistan Forex Scam Case

In November 2008 Munaf Kalia (Chief Executive Officer of Khanani and Kalia International (Pvt.) Ltd.), Yusuf Kalia, and associates, were charged for illegally transferring funds from Pakistan to Afghanistan. In light of the charges, the State Bank of Pakistan revoked the license for "Khanani and Kalia International" to operate its foreign exchange business and forced it to shut its offices.
On March 5, 2011, the directors of "Khanani and Kailia International" and four bankers were acquitted of all charges due to lack of evidence. The judge said that the prosecution failed to present evidence that directly implicated the defendants.
Background.
Since the depreciation of the rupee from July 2007, the Federal Investigation Agency was investigating the unexpected depreciation by the orders of the Pakistani government. In November 2008, the government sought support from Interpol with whose help the FIA cracked down all over Pakistan searching for persons involved in illegal smuggling of US dollars outside Pakistan. The FIA conducted raids in various parts of Karachi detained more than 12 people including Munaf Kalia, and ten officials of the National Database Registration Authority suspected of providing counterfeit identity cards. Manaf Kalia appeared in the court of Omar Awan, judicial magistrate South Karachi on November 9, 2008. The FIA sought and obtained a remand to Lahore to face another charge.
Exit Control List.
The Special Civil Court of Lahore, ordered that more than 14 names of different people involved in the forex scam case be included in the Exit Control List (ECL) of Pakistan.
Time Line.
On November 10, 2008, the State Bank of Pakistan suspended the licence of Khanani and Kalia for 30 days and debarred KKI’s head office, branches, franchises payment booths and currency exchange booths from undertaking any kind of business for violating its rules and regulations.
On December 10, 2008, the State Bank of Pakistan suspended the licence of Khanani and Kalia for an indefinite period of time. The suspension order further stated that the company's headquarter, branch offices and/or franchise cannot carry any business dealings.
In August 2009, a second foreign exchange company in Pakistan Zarco Exchange was accused of similar allegations and also had its license revoked and forced to shut down.
In Dec 2010, the Special Court (offences in banking) Lahore said that due to lack of evidence it saw no reason that Zarco Exchange should not request a revival of its license from the State Bank of Pakistan and in Feb 2011 its CEO was released by the Pakistan Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) after it said it decided to no longer pursue the case. In April 2011 Zarco Exchange's license was restored and the business started operating again.
On March 5, 2011, the directors of "Khanani and Kailia International" and four bankers were acquitted of all charges due to lack of evidence. However the FIA complained about the acquittal and said it had provided enough evidence. In response the Supreme Court of Pakistan had an independent judge investigate the acquittal. Following the acquittal a separate action by the FIA appeared to have failed due to mistakes that meant evidence provided to the court was missing important information.
Hawala business.
The government’s action against Hawala trade, which involves international network of currency dealers for making unrecorded payments in each other’s countries, was one step in the series of the forex scam case. These steps were taken at a time when the rupee depreciated by 30 percent against the dollar since the beginning of 2008.

At the end of his apprenticeship Reeve paid a visit to Paris, where he read a paper on the classification of mollusca before the Academy of Sciences.
On his return to London he set to work on his first book, "Conchologia Systematica" (2 vols. London, 1841–2).
From 1842, he traded as a natural history dealer. Using profits made by the sale of Dutch official Van Ryder's collection from the Moluccas, which he purchased at Rotterdam, and with the help of friends, he opened a shop in King William Street, Strand. 
He was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1846 and of the Geological Society in 1853, and he was honorary member of foreign scientific societies. From 1850 to 1856 he was editor and proprietor of the "Literary Gazette".

Jugni Chali Jalandhar

Jugni Chali Jalandhar is an Indian television comedy series that premiered on September 29, 2008 on SAB TV. It replaced the show "Left Right Left".
Plot.
"Jugni Chali Jalandhar" is the story of the trials and tribulations of a girl who is madly in love with a guy from her college and will face any ordeal for him. Jasmeet, who is born and brought up in London, is a doctor. Sweet, stylish, modern, cultured and well-educated 'Jazz' falls for 'Vicky', who belongs to Gen 'X' but is a Punjabi munda at heart. Although they love each other dearly, Vicky knows his father will never accept an educated girl as his 'Bahu', so he leaves Jasmeet in London and comes back to his native village Jagtariya in Jalandhar, Punjab. Since Jasmeet knows that the only way she can marry Vicky is by pleasing his dad, she goes to Jagtariya. Here unfortunately she bumps into her "father-in-law", who fumes at her when she throws at him a pound and runs away. He sends his sons to get hold of the 'Firangan' (foreigner) and vows to settle scores with her. When Vicky finds out that the Firangan is none other than Jasmeet, he somehow manages to save her from his brothers and asks her to go back. A disappointed Jasmeet was about to leave Jagtariya when she meets a woman with whom she shares her sorrow. 
To her surprise, the woman turns out to be Vicky's mother who agrees to help her. She trains her to be like a villager and teaches her how to do household chores. Thus, she transforms from Dr. Jasmeet to Jugni, a simple, uneducated village girl who strongly believes in the values taught to her by her father, like keeping her face covered in front of men. Without the knowledge of Vicky and with the help of Rajrani she enters 'Bhalla Nivas', impresses Jagtaar Bhalla by completing all the tasks assigned by him to ten prospective brides for his son, and ultimately succeeds in marrying her lover. Gurpal, a fellow villager who desperately wants his daughter Preeto to marry Vicky, to get the property of Bhallas, tries his best to stop the marriage and even after the marriage, in the name of 'abshagun ka tod', throws impossible challenges at the newlyweds, which they complete bravely. On their wedding night Vicky learns that Jugni is Jasmeet and is baffled thinking about how he will face his father when he comes to know the truth. He refuses to give Jugni the rights of being his wife until and unless his dad accepts her as Dr. Jasmeet Lamba. Brave that she is, Jugni accepts his word. Vicky gives her ten tasks and tells her that she will accept that she is worthy of staying in Jagtariya after she completes each of those tasks. Jugni completes those tasks and manages to become the sweetheart of the family because of her nature. 
In this pursuit, she does things which she had never dreamt of before, like cooking for 10–15 people, working in the fields, etc. Her troubles do not end here, with one problem approaching her after another. Though he refuses to acknowledge his love for her, Vicky helps her to come out of each problem. Though he keeps fighting with her, he secretly knows that none except Jugni has the potential to solve the family's problems. Together Jugni and Vicky face each hurdle, be it dealing with the notorious Gurpal and Preeto, saving their land, handling mischievous kids Bunty and Bubbli and transforming them into good ones, Jugni and Vicky somehow manage to sail through it all. Several people (Vicky's buaji, his eldest parjaiji, Samarjit) have come to know about Jugni's medical background, yet they accept her, since they know she did all this for Vicky and they've seen her caring for his family. 
When Jugni's parents come to visit her on her first anniversary, they are shocked to know that Vicky has not given Jugni the rights of being his wife. They plan to take their daughter back to London, but Vicky manages to prove his love for Jugni and before they leave, her parents are satisfied and believe that eventually everyone will accept their daughter. In spite of all the sacrifices she has made, in spite of all the problems she has to encounter, life is a blessing for Jugni, since Vicky is with her. The show ends with everyone accepting Jugni after whole truth comes out and live happily ever after.

Aubrey Epps

Aubrey Lee ("Yo-Yo") Epps (March 3, 1912 – November 13, 1984) was a Major League Baseball catcher. He was born in Memphis, Tennessee. He batted and threw right-handed, was 5 foot 10, and 170 pounds. Yo-Yo played just one major league game in his career, but he played well, going 3 for 4 (a .750 average) with 3 RBIs in his only major league game, playing for the Pittsburgh Pirates on September 29, 1935. Epps died in Ackerman, Mississippi.
Epps started his professional career in the minor leagues in 1933, splitting a partial season with six games at Longview of the Class C Dixie League and 30 games with the Birmingham Barons of the Class A Southern Association. In 1934, his first full season, he played 152 games for the Barons, finishing the season with three home runs and a .301 batting average. The Pittsburgh Pirates acquired Epps from the Barons in September 1934, under a deal in which Epps would finish the season with the Barons, would not play outfield and would be used exclusively as a catcher and would report to the Pirate's spring training camp in California in advance of the 1935 season. Epps split his 1935 minor league season, playing 59 games with the Barons and 26 with Fort Worth of the Class A Texas League, finishing with an overall .288 batting average in the minors that season.
In the final game of the 1935 season, in the second game of a doubleheader against the Cincinnati Reds, Epps played catcher and went 3 for 4, with two singles, a triple and three runs batted in, to go along with two errors, as the Pirates lost their season finale to the Reds by a score of 9–6. While the Pirates had high hopes for Epps, this one game turned out to be the only major league game of his career.
Epps underwent a tonsillectomy in mid-October 1935, expecting to see his health improve towards earning a spot as the Pirates' starting catcher in the 1936 season. However, Epps experienced hemorrhages that forced him back into the hospital in critical condition two days later, with his breathing impairment leading to pneumonia and his placement under an oxygen tent. By the end of December 1935, Epps had been released from the hospital and was recovering in his home in Memphis, Tennessee, with his doctor telling him that he should avoid spending time outdoors until warmer weather arrived. Epps informed Pirates management in a letter to team president Bill Benswanger of his status and said that he expected to be with the team when it opened training camp. By the time the Pirates players reported to San Antonio, Texas for spring training in March 1936, Epps was on the team's roster, hoping to make a comeback as catcher, having recovered from his pneumonia.
Epps played another six seasons in the minor leagues, playing in the organizations of the Pirates, New York Yankees, New York Giants and Chicago Cubs, but never played another major league game before leaving professional baseball after the 1941 season.

Some sources list the composers as Cooper, Bruce, drummer Neal Smith, and "R. Reggie," the latter being an allusion to Vinson's nickname "Rockin' Reggie Vinson."[]. The chorus has the same melody as The Hollies' 1966 song "Tell Me to My Face."
Billion Dollar Babies also became the name of a band which descended from the Alice Cooper band that recorded the song. The "Billion Dollar Babies" album was one of the last recorded by the Alice Cooper band, before singer Alice Cooper went solo. Legal complications ensued; all five Alice Cooper band members had shared ownership of the band's name. The original band never again recorded under the name Alice Cooper, but former Alice Cooper Band members Michael Bruce, Dennis Dunaway, and Neal Smith, along with additions Bob Dolin and Mike Marconi, recorded as Billion Dollar Babies. []. The band Billion Dollar Babies only released one album, 1977's "Battle Axe", before disbanding.[http://www.musicmight.com/linkto/artist/{A2565CA7-F8EF-44FD-83A7-BF7B9E5]

Valentine v. United States

Valentine v. United States, 299 U.S. 5 (1936), is known in the study of international criminal law for its contribution to the concept that while it is permissible for the United States to receive an accused without a treaty-based extradition, the United States itself will not extradite without authority found in statute or treaty.
In this case the respondents, native-born citizens of the United States, were charged with the commission of crimes in France. These crimes were among the extraditable offenses listed in the Franco-American Extradition Treaty of 1909. The respondents fled to the United States, were arrested in New York City on the request of the French authorities, and were held for extradition proceedings. The respondents sued to prevent their extradition from the United States to France under the Treaty of 1909. The respondents challenged the courts jurisdiction, arguing that because Article V of the Treaty of 1909 excepted citizens of the United States from extradition, the President had no constitutional authority to surrender the respondents to France.
Article V of the Treaty of 1909 stated that “Neither of the contracting Parties shall be bound to deliver up its own citizens or subjects under the stipulations of this convention.”
The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the orders of the District Judge, sustained the contention of the respondents, and directed their discharge. Certiorari was granted by the U.S. Supreme Court.
The Court stated that the surrender of US citizens by the government must find its sanction in U.S. law. Although extradition is a federal power, the power to provide for extradition is not confided to the Executive in the absence of treaty or legislative provision. The proceedings against the respondents must be authorized by law. Since that legal authority does not exist unless it is given by an act of Congress or by the terms of a treaty, it is not enough that the statute or treaty does not deny the power to surrender a citizen. It must be found that a statute or treaty confers such a power. The Court looked to the Treaty of 1909 to determine whether the power to surrender the respondents in this instance was conferred by the treaty itself. The treaty explicitly denies any obligation to surrender citizens, but save an obligation the court looked to determine whether the treaty contained a grant of power to surrender a citizen. The Court affirmed the decree of the Circuit Court and held that the President’s power, in absence of statute conferring an independent power, must be found in the terms of the treaty and that, as the treaty with France fails to grant the necessary authority, the President is without the power to surrender the respondents.

He was influential in shaping his peoples response to invasion and European settlement in the 1830s and 1840s. He was gaoled in 1840 for sheep-stealing which resulted in Dja Dja Wurrung people traveling to Melbourne to plead for his release. Woiwurrung and Djadja wurrung people feared that unless Munangabum was released, he would move Bunjil to release the Mindye causing a plague to black and white.
Munangabum was released from Gaol in August 1840. On 7 February 1841 Munangabum was shot and wounded in the shoulder by settlers while his companion Gondiurmin died at Far Creek Station, west of Maryborough. Three settlers were later apprehended and tried on 18 May 1841 for the murder of Gondiurmin but were acquitted for want of evidence, as aborigines could not give evidence in courts of law.
In 1841 he acted as an envoy for Assistant Protector of Aborigines Edward Stone Parker, and almost died from lack of water for three days on an expedition to the Mallee.
Munangabum was murdered in 1846 by a rival clan-head from the south.

Darkhouse

Darkhouse is a 2005 mystery-detective novel written by Irish author Alex Barclay and published by HarperCollins in the United Kingdom. It is the debut novel of former journalist Alex Barclay and was both a "Sunday Times" and international best-seller.
Plot summary.
The novel kicks off in New York City with the abduction of a wealthy couple's young daughter. The girl's mother Elise Gray is being tailed by Detective Joe Lucchesi, his partner Danny Markey and two FBI agents. The kidnapper Donnie Riggs calls Elise and directs her to a park. He lets the girl, Hayley, out of his car and she runs to her mother. Elise discovers that Hayley is strapped with explosives as she embraces her, but she is too late as Riggs presses the detonator, killing them both. Joe pursues the kidnapper and guns him down. Two days later, in a Nevada prison, inmate Duke Rawlins is distraught to learn of the death of Donnie, his childhood friend.
One year passes and Joe Lucchesi has relocated to Ireland with his interior designer wife Anna and sixteen-year-old son Shaun. Joe has taken temporary retirement from the force, Anna is renovating an old lighthouse and Shaun is dating a local girl called Katie Lawson. At first it seems that their family life is idyllic but Anna has a dark secret. She had a secret affair with local drunk John Miller, a man now embittered at his wife having moved to Australia with his children. Joe's turbulent relationship with his father, Giulio, is highlighted as he travels over to the States to attend his second marriage. Giulio clashes with Joe over his career choice and moving his family to Ireland. To make matters worse, Katie disappears from the area leaving Shaun deeply upset. Meanwhile, in a parallel subplot, Duke Rawlins has been travelling around Ireland and has reached Mountbatton.
An investigation is launched in Mountbatton into Katie's mysterious disappearance. Her devastated mother Martha insists that her daughter was a happy-go-lucky teenager with many friends and a caring boyfriend; she had no reason to go missing. Shaun comes under suspicion as he was the last person to see her; Joe himself cannot help but think that his son is hiding something and even looks for some sort of clues in his bedroom. Shaun becomes indignant at his father taking on the role of investigator and suspecting him of withholding information. Joe finds himself seeing red herrings everywhere in the community. He questions Shaun's friend Robert Harrington about a scratch on his hand, much to Shaun's annoyance. He also sees John Miller as a possible suspect. Anna in the meantime has to deal with Joe asking her awkward questions about her involvement with Miller.
The locals conduct a search of the surrounding area to no avail. Local Sergeant Frank Deegan, hotshot D.I. Myles O' Connor and fiery garda Richie Bates question Mae Miller, the elderly mother of John Miller and mentally challenged school caretaker Petey Grant amongst others but come no closer to the truth. Joe does his own investigating, retracing routes that Katie may have taken and asks questions, however, his theories are dismissed by Richie who tells him to stay out of the case.
After a number of weeks, Katie's decomposing body is discovered in the forest near Shore's Rock, the lighthouse where the Lucchesis live. The post mortem results reveal that Katie had been strangled and beaten with a blunt instrument. With the community baffled by the brutal murder of such a popular teenager, the Lucchesi family begin to fall apart. Shaun is inconsolable over his girlfriend's death and Anna becomes increasingly paranoid about what Joe knows. She confesses to him that she had been seeing John Miller while they were engaged which makes Joe furious. Meanwhile, the authorities are told to pay particular attention to Shaun and also to Joe who had been seen removing evidence from the murder scene. The night after Katie's funeral, one of the locals has an altercation with Duke Rawlins outside the bar and finds a hawk gold pin after Duke flees. He shows it to a shocked Joe who recognises it as being the same pin that Donnie Riggs had in his hand when he shot him.
Flashbacks to Donnie and Duke's childhood in Texas run concurrent to the main murder plot. They both grow up in Stinger's Creek and are inseparable. Duke is very close to his kindly Uncle Bill but has to deal with a lot of hardship in his life in the form of a drug addicted, promiscuous mother and the unwanted attentions of a paedophile. Donnie also has domestic strife as his father is a negligent alcoholic, while Duke's negative surroundings are moulding him into a deeply disturbed boy with a penchant for violence. At the age of fifteen the two boys make a chilling blood pact to remain loyal to one another until the end, a precursor to their later dastardly actions.
With Joe now convinced that Duke Rawlins is after him with revenge on his mind, he once again clashes with Richie Bates when he takes Petey Grant in for questioning over the murder. However, Petey reveals that he met Katie on the night of her death and that she had had a fight with Shaun, something which Shaun had earlier disputed. When he is interrogated by Richie and Frank Deegan he admits that a failed attempt at sexual intercourse had caused Katie to become upset and run away from him. Frank is shocked to discover, in the meantime, that his phone number was the last that Katie had dialled on the fateful night.
While researching Duke Rawlins, Joe discovers that Ogden Parnum, a former Police Chief from Stinger's Creek has committed suicide. Joe is intrigued to find that he was head of the unsolved Crosscut Killer investigation, an infamous serial killer who raped and murdered nine young women in Texas.
Across the Atlantic, Danny Markey questions the cellmate of Duke Rawlins, who reveals that Donnie was getting the ransom money for Duke upon his release from jail. Back in Mountbatton, Joe is now convinced that Duke and Donnie are connected to the Crosscut Killer mystery and is liaising with American Detective Victor Nicotero on the theory. Anna is horrified as she discovers that Joe is planning on being reinstated with the force, while Joe clashes with his father again as he has bought Shaun a ticket to New York to stay with him. Anna is subsequently kidnapped by Duke when he poses as a replacement gardener for a photoshoot she is doing. Joe saves a desperate Shaun from a drunken suicide attempt, only to then discover that Anna is missing...
Additional flashback sequences to Texas, show how Duke and Donnie embarked upon their sadistic rampage of rape and murder as they callously slayed a succession of innocent young women, proving that they were behind the Crosscut killings.
State pathologist Lara McClatchie contacts Frank Deegan telling him that were no similarities in the deaths of the Crosscut victims to Katie's murder but the recent murder of a young Limerick woman bear the same hallmarks. Frank now realises that Joe's theory about Duke Rawlins being in Ireland is true.
Still in under the belief that Anna has walked out on him and Shaun, Joe receives a call from Duke who is holding Anna in a remote cottage. He threatens to kill her unless Joe complies with his wishes. He discovers that Duke has a missing Tipperary woman, Siobhan Fallon, in his clutches too. As Duke taunts him on the phone about Anna, Joe turns the tables on the kidnapper by telling Duke about how his wife, Sammi, has been unfaithful to him. He informs Duke that she had been having an affair with Donnie while he was in prison and that she has gone to the police in Stinger's Creek confessing that her husband is the Crosscut Killer. The ransom money hadn't been for Duke, it was for Donnie and Sammi to have a fresh start with. While Joe is on the phone to Duke, Shaun overhears and is furious that Joe won't go to the Gardaí.
Meanwhile, in Texas, Victor Nicotero visits Ogden Parnum's widow on the pretense of investigating her husband's suicide. She tells Victor that Marcy Winbaum, a DA, who worked with Ogden some years previously came to visit him shortly before his death. Parnum's widow was suspicious over a heated conversation that Marcy had with her husband. It is revealed in a flashback to 1992, that Marcy had uncovered evidence linking Duke Rawlins to the Crosscut murders. Ogden questions Duke, who blackmails his interrogator as he was the paedophile who abused him as a child. Ogden provided Duke with an alibi, which allowed him to get away with his heinous crimes.
Duke brutally murders Siobhan in front of captive Anna who then tries to escape. Joe discovers Siobhan's body before finding a badly wounded Anna, who Duke had fired an arrow at. Duke then grabs Shaun and holds him over the edge of the lighthouse balcony in a precarious stand-off with Joe. With both Shaun and Anna's lives in jeopardy, Joe is issued with an ultimatum, call 999 for medical assistance for Anna or Shaun plummets to his death. Joe chooses to save Shaun and Duke escapes as an ambulance arrives at the lighthouse for Anna. Richie and Joe pursue Duke but lose him. In a fresh twist, a drug dealer reveals that Richie had murdered Katie as she had witnessed him tipping off the criminal. Richie is arrested for Katie's murder while Duke escapes the country.
In the novel's epilogue, Joe and Shaun are back in New York with Giulio with a traumatised Anna recuperating in her native Paris. It seems that the Lucchesis' marriage has broken down until Shaun receives a call from Anna saying that she is coming home to them.
Critical response.
Mark Timlin heralded the novel as "...a terrific debut by an exciting new writer". Powell's Books said of "Darkhouse", "In this electrifying thriller—a bestseller in Great Britain and Ireland—Alex Barclay creates a stunning array of contrasts—from the violence of a cop's world to the fragility of an embattled marriage, from the danger of New York's gritty streets to the quiet of a seaside Irish village. With brilliance and subtlety, Barclay delivers a nerve-wracking tale of a troubled family, facing a brutal danger rushing relentlessly out of the past". Sharon Wheeler in her review of the novel criticised the lack of character depth, "...Joe is forgettable, selfish interior designer Anna is hideous, and the teenage son Shaun apprentice hideous. There's a fairly bland cast of locals, including the archetypal good cop, bad cop".

Vlach Quartet

The Vlach Quartet () is the name of two consecutive classical string quartet musical ensembles, based in Prague, which are linked by family tradition (father and daughter) in the Vlach family. The original Vlach Quartet was founded in 1949 and wound up in 1975. In 1982 the New Vlach Quartet ("Nové Vlachovo kvarteto") was founded with guidance from the original founder, and came to be known as the Vlach Quartet of Prague ("Vlachovo kvarteto Praha"). It is still active as a highly-esteemed musical ensemble.
Personnel.
Vlach Quartet.
The personnel of the original Vlach Quartet in the period 1958-1972 were: 
Origins and activities.
Josef Vlach was a violinist, conductor and teacher in Prague. He shared the principal violin desk of the Czech Chamber Orchestra (as it existed under Václav Talich), with Jiri Novak, leader of the Smetana Quartet. In 1949 he founded the Vlach Quartet with members of the Orchestra. Over the next 25 years they made a significant contribution in the interpretation of classical and Czech literature for string quartet, both in concerts and in recording, for which they had a contract with Supraphon Records. The original quartet was internationally admired for its authentic, powerful and rhythmically solid performances. In 1957 Josef Vlach also re-formed the Czech Chamber Orchestra.
The New Vlach Quartet was founded in 1982 by Jana Vlachová, the daughter of Josef Vlach. She had played in a string quartet from childhood under her father's guidance and won first prize in the Concertino Praga international competition at age 14. She graduated from studies with M. Hlounová at the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague, chose to concentrate on chamber music, and formed a duo with the Swedish cellist Mikael Ericsson in 1977. He had studied in Copenhagen, attended master-classes by G. Fallot and Gregor Piatigorsky, and studied in Prague with Josef Chuchro. He also has a recording career as a soloist. Karel Stadtherr, violinist, had performed with the Suk Chamber Orchestra (in contact with Josef Vlach) and was Konzertmeister of the Prague Chamber Orchestra Without Conductor. Petr Verner studied solo viola at the Prague Academy under L. Malý, Milan Škampa and J. Pěruška, and chamber music with Josef Vlach. 
They received guidance and mentoring from Josef Vlach, imparting a strong interpretative tradition from the school of Talich. and underwent a course of training by the Melos Quartet (Stuttgart). They worked to expand the range of the repertoire of the earlier Quartet, both in international scope and in the time-frame represented. They began by winning the prize for best interpretation of a contemporary Czech work at the Czech String Quartet Competition in Kroměříž in 1983. Their performance and broadcasts focus both on the classics - Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Brahms, and on to Bartók and Shostakovich - and on the distinctive Czech repertoire, works of Antonín Dvořák, Bedřich Smetana, Leoš Janáček, and Bohuslav Martinů.
The Quartet gives concerts throughout Europe, including Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Greece, and Luxembourg. Many have been broadcast, for instance by the Bayerischer Rundfunk, the Südwestrundfunk, Danmarks Radio and Radio France. Czech Television has broadcast documentaries on both the old and the new Vlach Quartets. They have toured in United States, where their opening concert in New York in July 2004 was very highly praised. They had a Residency in 1997 in the Japanese University town of Gifu and were broadcast by NHK, Japan's principal station. In 2000 they led courses in interpretation at the conservatory in Ingesund, Sweden.
The Quartet's main collaborations are with Maria Kliegel (cello), Jenö Jandó and Ivan Klánský (pianists), Eduard Brunner and Dieter Klöcker (clarinet) and Maximilian Mangold (guitar).

Götgatan

Götgatan (Original Swedish "Göthegatan" for "Gothia Street") is the name of one of the longest streets in central Stockholm on the Southern Isle (Södermalm) of the city. The street itself has existed since the 12th century, and has had its name since the 1640s, the name based on it being a part of the old Göta highway.
At its northern end behind Stockholm City Museum it connects to Södermalm Square at Slussen, and it runs due south from there to the former toll position of Skanstull and a high bridge (Skanstullsbron) leading over to Globe Arena and mainland suburbs.
Götgatan passes spacious Citizen Square (Medborgarplatsen) and one of Stockholm's first skyscrapers popularly called "Skatteskrapan" (the "Tax Scraper") because until recently it housed Sweden's tax authority. In a country known for high tax rates, the term "Barescraper" has also been used for the building, and for decades taxpayers would traipse along Götgatan and line up ceremoniously to file their income tax forms on the day they were due. 
Greta Garbo was born a block west of Götgatan, and there is a bust of her on the (newer) building. A square named for her is located a few blocks east along park-like Katarina Bangata. Also a block away in either direction are the Roman Catholic Cathedral and the Stockholm Mosque.
There are three underground railway stations along the street with two entrances for each. 
The northernmost stretch of Götgatan runs southward up a steep slope from intersecting Hornsgatan (another long street that also begins there) and then descends to level off before Citizen Square. That portion is pedestrian, called Götgatsbacken ("Gothia Street Slope") and has become increasingly trendy in recent years. The Royal Dutch Embassy is located there.
Otherwise Götgatan and all of the Southern Isle have long been known as a less pretentious and more relaxed – and so less fashionable – area than other parts of Stockholm. The area has been home to many struggling artists and artisans, and working-class residents. One of the areas oldest restaurants, Den gröne Jägaren, opened in 1866 in a block still owned by the Catholic Church.

Bob Spear (naturalist)

Bob Spear (born February 21, 1920), founding director of the Birds of Vermont Museum (BOVM), is a longtime naturalist, birdwatcher and master woodcarver living in Huntington, Vermont USA. He has been influential in the birding and environmental communities, having co-founded Vermont's first chapter of the National Audubon Society and having created more than 470 biologically accurate bird carvings on display at the BOVM. He is also the author of the book, "The Birds of Vermont", published in 1969 by the Green Mountain Audubon Society.
The first half century.
Bob Spear was born in 1920 into a Vermont farming family. During his youth his family moved to Westfield, Massachusetts because his mother, who was a teacher, could not get a teaching job in Vermont (married women could not be employed as teachers at that time). Spear credits his mother with inspiring his interest in birds, nature, and art. Following her death, the family moved back to Vermont and settled on a farm in Colchester. In 1938, a stray parakeet flew into their barn, moving Spear to create his first bird carving using only a penknife. This early carving is now on display at the Birds of Vermont Museum.
During World War II, Spear served in the US Navy as a radar technician. After his release from military service, he returned to Vermont and went to work at the General Electric (GE) plant in Burlington. He also enrolled in courses at the University of Vermont. While at GE, most of his lunch hours were spent birding on Blodgett Beach on Lake Champlain. During this time, Spear married, raised a family, served as a boy scout troop leader, carved several guitars, and honed his wood carving skills.
Birds and nature.
Spear left GE in 1972. He had already started to forge a career in the birding world and by 1974 he had started an Environmental Day. In 1979 he started creating a collection of bird carvings in hopes of someday establishing a location where people could come to see them and learn about birds. In the late 1970s, he was active in establishing the Green Mountain Audubon Center in Huntington and served as its first director for seven years. 
In 1987, the Birds of Vermont Museum opened. In addition to creating all the bird carvings and their display cases, Spear also helped design and build the museum itself. At the time of the opening, the museum housed only 231 bird carvings. Spear continued to carve more species of birds and the museum's collection has since swelled to more than 498 carvings. (The collection now includes a few carvings from Bob Spear's apprentice, fellow carver, and former curator Ingrid Brown, and 4 from fellow carver and board member Richard Allen.) The length of time required for Spear to complete a carving varies widely, depending on the size of the bird. Small birds can take as little as 40 hours to carve and paint. Prior to completing a wild turkey carving, which required 1,230 hours, Spear's carving of a California condor had held the honor of having required the most hours to complete (500 hours).

Henry Edward Fox

General Henry Edward Fox (4 March 1755 – 18 July 1811) was a British Army general. He also served for a brief spell as Governor of Minorca.
Family.
As a son of Henry Fox, first Baron Holland and his second wife, (Georgiana) Caroline Fox, née Lennox, he was a younger brother of the politician Charles James Fox (1749–1806).
Life.
He attended Westminster School before being commissioned as a cornet in the 1st dragoon guards in 1770. Soon after that he spent 1 year's leave at the military academy at Strasbourg. After his return he rose to lieutenant (1773) then captain (1774).
American War of Independence.
In 1773 he moved to the 38th Regiment of Foot, stationed at Boston, and fought in the American War of Independence (spending 1778-79 on leave in England). By the end of the war he had risen to colonel and king's aide-de-camp, and he then moved to command the forces in Nova Scotia (1783–89), where he was influential in the creation of the new colony of New Brunswick, and then the Chatham barracks (1789–93).
Later career.
Next he was quartermaster-general on the duke of York's staff in Flanders to replace the recently killed James Moncrieff (1793–95) and fought in the Netherlands theatre of the French Revolutionary Wars. He then served as inspector-general of the recruiting service (1795–99), lieutenant-governor of Minorca (1799–1801), c-in-c of all British Mediterranean forces outside Gibraltar (1801–03, replacing the killed General Sir Ralph Abercromby at the battle of Aboukir) and finally Commander-in-Chief, Ireland (1803). In Ireland he was caught off-guard by Robert Emmet's Dublin uprising (22 July 1803) and was quickly replaced by Lieutenant-General Cathcart, whose appointment was gazetted on 20 October.
Fox moved to be commander of the London district (1803), Lieutenant-Governor of Gibraltar (1804–06), Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean (1806–07) and minister to Sicily. With his health weakening, Fox passed active command of the force to his deputy, Lieutenant-General Sir John Moore. The smallness of his force (made yet smaller when Major-General Mackenzie Fraser was sent to occupy Alexandria) meant he refused the repeated requests from the Sicilian court and William Drummond, British minister at the Sicilian court, for land operations on the Italian mainland. Fox and Moore also opposed the naval commander William Sidney Smith's political machinations at the Sicilian court, contrary as they were to the army's tactics for the Italian theatre, until Fox's ill health finally led to his being recalled by the British government and replaced by Moore. Fox was promoted full general on 25 April 1808 and appointed governor of Portsmouth in 1810, dying the following year.
Marriage and issue.
On 14 November 1786 he married Marianne Clayton, daughter of William Clayton, 4th Baronet and sister of Catherine, Lady Howard de Walden, and they had 3 children

78th Fighter Group

The 78th Fighter Group (78 FG) is an inactive United States Air Force unit. It was last assigned to the 78th Fighter Wing, at Hamilton Air Force Base, California. It was inactivated on 1 February 1961.
During World War II the group was an Eighth Air Force fighter unit stationed in England assigned primarily to RAF Duxford. It claimed 338 air to air and 358 air to ground aircraft destroyed. It flew its last mission on 13 April 1945.
History.
World War II.
The 78th Fighter Group was activated at Baer Field, IN as the 78th Pursuit Group in January 1942, receiving its cadre from the 14th Fighter Group. and redesignated as a fighter group four months later. It initially trained for combat with P-38's and served as part of the west coast air defense organization. It moved to England in November 1942 and was assigned to Eighth Air Force. The group lost its P-38's and most of its pilots in February 1943 when they were assigned to the Twelfth Air Force for service in the North African campaign.
The group was reassigned to Duxford airfield in April 1943 and reequipped with Republic P-47 Thunderbolts. Aircraft of the group were identified by a black/white chequerboard pattern.--
The group consisted of the following squadrons:
From Duxford, the 78th flew many missions to escort Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and Consolidated B-24 Liberator bombers that attacked industries, submarine yards and docks, V-weapon sites, and other targets on the Continent. In 1943, the group had the first American ace in Eighth Air Force. The group also claimed a victory over a German Messerschmitt Me-262 jet fighter. The unit also engaged in counter-air activities and on numerous occasions strafed and dive-bombed airfields, trains, vehicles, barges, tugs, canal locks, barracks, and troops.
In addition to other operations, the 78th participated in the intensive campaign against the German Air Force and aircraft industry during Big Week, 20–25 February 1944 and helped to prepare the way for the invasion of France. The group supported the landings in Normandy in June 1944 and contributed to the breakthrough at Saint-Lô in July.
The group converted to North American P-51 Mustangs in December 1944 and participated in the Battle of the Bulge, from December 1944 to January 1945. It also supported the airborne assault across the Rhine in March.
The 78th Fighter Group received a Distinguished Unit Citation for activities connected with the Operation Market-Garden combined ground and airborne attack through on Holland in September 1944 when the group covered troop carrier and bombardment operations and carried out strafing and dive-bombing missions. It suffered its heaviest casualties of the war in this operation. The group received a second DUC for destroying numerous aircraft on five airfields near Prague and Pilsen on 16 April 1945.
The 78th Fighter Group returned to Camp Kilmer New Jersey and October 1945 and was inactivated on 18 October.
Cold War.
Occupation of Germany
The 78th FG was reactivated in Germany on 20 August 1946, replacing the 368th Fighter Group (which was inactivated, redesignated the 136th Fighter Group, and allotted to the National Guard) at AAF Station Straubing, Germany and flew the former 368th's P-47 Thunderbolts from the airfield. The group was reactivated due to the Air Force's policy of retaining only low-numbered groups on active duty after the war.
In Germany the group was assigned to the United States Air Forces in Europe's XII Tactical Air Command for duty with the occupation force. The group was assigned to AAF Station Straubing, The group was transferred, without personnel and equipment, to Mitchel Field, New York in June 1947.
Air Defense of the United States
At Mitchel, the group remained active and was assigned to Air Defense Command (ADC). The group was manned with a small cadre of personnel, being equipped with a few P-51D Mustangs. On 16 November 1948, the 78th was reassigned to Hamilton AFB, California where it was assigned to ADC's Fourth Air Force. At that time the 78th Fighter Wing was established under Hobson Plan, and the 78th Fighter Group became the operational component of the wing, controlling its flying resources.
On 1 March 1949, the 78th Fighter Group received the first of the new production F-84 Thunderjets, with these aircraft going to the 82d, 83d and 84th Fighter Squadrons. The F-84s became problematic with cracks appearing in wing spars or skin beginning in September. The group lost four jets in accidents by the end of the year.
On 1 July 1949, Air Defense Command was inactivated as a major command, and Continental Air Command (ConAC) assumed the air defense mission. In January 1950 the wing and group were redesignated as the 78th Fighter-Interceptor Wing and 78th Fighter-Interceptor Group and the squadrons became Fighter-Interceptor Squadrons (FIS).
With the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, the 78th Fighter Group was the only remaining ConAC F-84 unit with an air defense commitment. The group lost many personnel which were reassigned to Far East Air Force units engaging in combat with deployed units. The personnel losses were replaced with less-experienced federalized Air Force Reserve or Air National Guard personnel. At the same time, ConAC placed the 78th Fighter Group on 24/7 air defense alert status, with the three squadrons rotating among themselves for one day on and two days off alert periods.
Throughout this period, the F-84s remained problematic with wing integrity, the group having only 50 of its authorized 70 aircraft operational, as a third of its aircraft had been sent to Republic Aircraft or Air Materiel Command depots for repairs. This led to excess hours being put on the remaining aircraft, reducing their designed operational life. By the first quarter of 1951, the number of operational aircraft on station was reduced to 44, with only 34 actually being combat ready. The manpower shortage was worse, with only seven of the forty combat-rated pilots being available, the remainder being assigned Europe or combat duty in Korea.
In June 1951, the 78th Fighter-Interceptor Group received the first four F-89B Scorpions, as a replacement for the F-84 Thunderjets. The Scorpions were assigned to the 83d and 84th FIS, while the 82d FIS retained the best of the groups remaining F-84s, while the remainder were either shipped as replacement aircraft to South Korea or sent to Republic for refurbishing.
By the end of 1951, the 82d FIS stood alert during daylight hours while the other two squadrons rotated night and foul weather duties. The F-89s, however, were rushed into service too rapidly. There were not enough trained pilots and radar operators, and there were not enough maintenance personnel who knew the intricacies of the complex and troublesome Hughes E-1 fire control system. The in-service rate of the F-89B was appallingly low, and crashes were all too frequently.
The 78th Fighter-Interceptor Group was inactivated along with the wing on 6 February 1952 along with its parent wing as part of a major ADC reorganization, which replaced fighter wings organized under the Hobson Plan with regional defense wings. Its operational units were transferred to the 4702d Defense Wing and Hamilton was placed under the 566th Air Base Group. Two of the inactivated 78th's squadrons moved as ADC dispersed its fighter force. The 82d FIS moved to Larson AFB, Washington and was reassigned to the 4703d Defense Wing; the 83d FIS to Paine AFB, Washington and transferred to the 4704th Defense Wing. Only he 84th remained at Hamilton AFB.
The unit was reactivated in 1955 by replacing the 566th Air Defense Group at Hamilton AFB as part of ADC's Project Arrow, which reactivated fighter units that had achieved distinction in the two word wars. The 84th FIS, already at Hamilton was assigned to it and the Its 83d FIS returned without personnel or equipment to Hamilton and was reassigned to the group, taking over the personnel and equipment of the 325th FIS, which moved without personnel or equipment to Truax Field, Wisconsin. The group also became the host for Hamilton AFB and was assigned a number of support organizations to fulfil this mission. On 18 October 1956, the 78th Fighter Wing was once again activated and the group transferred its maintenance and support functions to the wing. The group flew numerous interceptors for West Coast air defense until its inactivation on 1 February 1961 when group components were assigned directly to the 78th Fighter Wing as the 78th converted to the dual deputy organization.

Resistance (series)

Resistance is a series of first-person shooter and third-person shooter video games developed by Insomniac Games and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita video game consoles. The series takes place in an alternate history around the year 1950, in which an alien civilization known as the Chimera have invaded and conquered Earth, expanding their armies by capturing humans and transforming them into monster-like supersoldiers to fight for them. The player takes the role of one of the remaining human armed forces as they fight against the Chimera invasion. The series is noted for its use of both conventional and futuristic weaponry, reflecting Insomniac's previous work on the "Ratchet & Clank" series. All games in the series have all been rated M by the ESRB.
The characters and related events are described, below, using in-universe tone, so the fictional alien invasion during 1951 is treated as fact, rather than fiction.
Games.
Main series.
"Resistance: Fall of Man".
"Resistance: Fall of Man" is the first installment in the "Resistance" trilogy and was released on the PlayStation 3 in 2006 as a launch title for the system. The game is about the Americans and the British who join forces to stop an extraterrestrial species known as the Chimera from taking over Europe in 1951.
"Resistance 2".
"Resistance 2" is the second installment in the "Resistance" trilogy and was released on the PlayStation 3 in November 2008. The game's protagonist is Nathan Hale. It is set in 1953, shortly after the events of the first game. The Chimera have managed to cross over into North America and threaten to take over the continent.
"Resistance 3".
"Resistance 3" is the third and final installment in the "Resistance" trilogy and was released on the PlayStation 3 on September 6, 2011. The protagonist is Joseph Capelli, a character that was introduced in the previous game. It is set in 1957 and again takes place in the United States in cities like New York City and St. Louis, Missouri. This is also the last game set in the Resistance universe to be made by Insomniac Games, as confirmed by its CEO Ted Price.
Other games.
"Resistance: Retribution".
"Resistance: Retribution" was released on the PlayStation Portable on March 17, 2009. Set after the events of "Fall of Man", the game follows James Grayson, a British Royal Marine first mentioned in "Resistance 2", as he helps the human resistance force in Europe to retake the continent from the Chimera in 1951.
"Resistance: Burning Skies".
"Resistance: Burning Skies" was released on the PlayStation Vita May 29, 2012. The game follows the story of Tom Riley, a firefighter who sets out to find his family while fighting the Chimera, who have now taken over the American east coast.
Future.
According to "Resistance 3" creative director Marcus Smith, the studio has a number of franchises it wants to pursue and that "Resistance" is not one of them. It is possible that the franchise will be handed off to another developer. Insomniac CEO Ted Price stated that Insomniac "won't be making any more "Resistance" games."
It was recently announced that the whole main "Resistance" series will no longer have online features starting on March 28, 2014.
Setting.
The alternate history of the "Resistance" series diverges from current history primarily at the end of the Spanish-American War, and an alternate World War I leading to a prosperous European alliance and worldwide peace, preventing the Great Depression, the rise of the Nazis in Germany, and World War II, but also leading to the rise of an isolationist Russian Empire, one that is still under Tsarist rule as Lenin's revolution was crushed.
A new menace arises from Siberia, with the epicenter corresponding to the time and location of the Tunguska event of 1908. In 1921, Russia initiated a communications blackout with the rest of the world, and built a wall against its European border called the "Red Curtain". Word spreads of small towns, villages, and eventually cities in Russia and Eastern Europe that are destroyed within a single night. A strange cold front also develops over Russia and spreads outwards. European intelligence agencies attempt to listen in on Russian radio stations, only to hear a single message repeated over and over: ""Brotherhood, Strength, and Fortitude...in the face of the angry night.""
In December 1949, the Red Curtain is suddenly breached by numerous Chimeran forces. The Chimera overrun continental Europe by February 1950, leaving very few survivors. The Chimera then proceed to dig underneath the English Channel, invading Britain in late 1950. The bulk of the British forces are wiped out, with the rest fleeing to scattered bases in the northern parts of England.
Some time after the invasion of England the SRPA (Special Research Projects Administration) begins experimenting with the virus, supposedly in order to find a cure. It is never revealed whether they are really attempting to find a cure for the virus or are simply attempting to create a group of superhumans just as Malikov did with the Cloven. This project is known as Project Abraham.
There are only two known locations where Project Abraham took place. One was an unspecified military facility in Alaska and another in Bryce Canyon, Utah. Out of the viral website it is known that the only survivors are Joseph Capelli and Nathan Hale. They are both later transferred into Sentinel Squad Echo.
After the events of Project Abraham, the soldiers who were infected with the Chimeran virus were formed into an elite squad known as Sentinels.
The Chimera.
The Chimera are a species of unconfirmed origin that arrived on Earth with the asteroid from the Tunguska event, who serve as the main enemies in the game. They first appeared in Siberia shortly after the Tunguska event in the game's alternate history. The human forces initially believe the Chimera to be the result of a Russian biological warfare experiment gone wrong, but through events and revelations during the course of the game, along with the Chimeras' advanced technologies such as weather control, energy weapons, and force fields, it becomes obvious to the humans that the Chimera are extraterrestrial in origin. The Chimeran army expands by infecting humans with a mutagenic virus that causes its victims to fall into a coma, then slowly transform into Chimera while inside cocoons. Intelligence reports in the game speculate that more than one human body is needed for the larger strains of Chimera. The Chimera build conversion centers across their territory to both speed up this process, and create new breeds of Chimeran creatures. Large, jellyfish-like creatures, called Carriers, bring infected humans that have fallen into comas to these conversion centers. The centers become redundant in "Resistance 2", leaving the converting in cocoons right in the cities where they were infected.
The main character of "Resistance: Fall of Man" and "Resistance 2" is Nathan Hale, a human that has been partially infected by the Chimeran virus that gives him regenerative abilities but has not completely taken over his body. It is revealed in "Resistance 2" that Hale participated in an American experiment named "Project Abraham". The Americans tested the Chimeran virus on human subjects, and tried to inhibit the virus in some way. Hale was tested with a different strain, originating from what Dr. Malikov describes as "Pure Chimera". They are more than 60 million years old. In "Resistance 2", Daedalus (Jordan Shephard) tells Hale that The Chimera had once ruled the earth millions of years ago. 
The Chimera are much stronger than regular humans, and have between two and six yellow eyes. The Chimeran metabolism is said to be roughly twelve times that of humans', which allows for extraordinary healing abilities, but it also causes their bodies to overheat quickly. Chimeran soldiers have cooling devices implanted into their backs, to prevent fatal overheating. The Chimera thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate through unknown means, reducing temperatures to the point where London is frozen over in July. The Chimera are led by creatures called Angels (large, flying monsters with multiple limbs emanating from their backs and extending toward the front around their heads) which possess a telepathic link to the Chimeran soldiers. Individual Chimera die without this psychic link. It is said in several intelligence reports during the game that the Chimera will devour their own kind, usually their wounded or dead.
In "Resistance: Fall of Man" it is revealed that the Angels take shelter in areas known as Chimeran towers which are massive spire like structures that are often hundreds of feet tall. In the "Resistance: Fall of Man" level "A Disturbing Discovery" it turns out that the towers are excavated rather than constructed as was originally believed. This suggests that the Chimera were on Earth before humans. This turns out to be true when in "Resistance 2" it is revealed that the towers were on Earth several million years ago. Apparently something radical happened in the Gulf of Mexico, which incapacitated all the towers that are scattered around the world. It is presumed that the Chicxulub asterioid impact is linked to this due to a mysterious object being described by intelligence in the second game and the location in the Gulf.
In "Resistance 2" a Chimera known as Daedalus, which originated from the very same experiment as Nathan Hale, takes control of the Chimeran forces world wide after the surprise Chimeran attack on station Igloo. It is speculated that because he is supposed to be an older form of Chimera that he has more precise control over the Chimera than the Angels. It is revealed in several intelligence documents and mission briefings that the Chimeran command structure became more and more complex since the arrival of Daedalus and that the Chimeran offensive strategy has also become more tactical.
It is mentioned in "Resistance: Retribution", since human bodies have been running low, the Chimera have apparently been dismantling old conversion centers around Europe, and building new ones, in which they are using a new raw material, the numerous amount of unused infected female humans as no female Chimeran has ever been seen in the previous game. During the demo chapter, Grayson tries to rescue a soldier named Bouchard, who is in the conversion process. She mentions that she is surrounded by bodies that are deformed, neither alive nor dead, all of them female.
Cloven.
The Cloven do not appear in the story campaign mode for "Resistance: Fall of Man" but are mentioned in discovered intelligence reports and feature as an unlockable skin in the multiplayer mode. They do appear in "Resistance: Retribution". They are bald, pale-skinned humanoids in foreign military uniforms and have cuts on them in "Resistance: Retribution" and have no shirt and only wear skulls. In intelligence reports and on the official site, they are said to be maniacs who speak Russian, ritualistically mutilate themselves and their victims, and feed on the bodies of their own dead soldiers. They appear to be enemies of both the Chimera and the British-American forces, due to their hostility towards both. Despite this, they seem to be somehow connected to the Chimera, but in what way is unknown. In two of the intelligence reports found later on in the game it appears that the British started hunting for groups of Cloven. Also in one of these two it makes reference to a possible leader that may control the Cloven.
Information from "Resistance"'s Map Pack 1 on the Official Website reports on a possible alliance between the Chimera and the Cloven. The Cloven were spotted ransacking Chimeran bases and encountering no resistance. It also reads in an intelligence report that the Cloven purposely lead the Chimera to York where the American soldiers would be landing, indicating York was a trap from the beginning. The equipment being taken by the Cloven is different from what has been seen in their possession so far. U.S. forces speculate that the Cloven are stockpiling Chimeran technology to be used against Allied forces. An encounter with the Cloven has shown that they now have weapons far stronger than anything witnessed from either side in combat. Whether the Cloven are in possession of advanced Chimeran technology or simply modifying existing Chimeran technology is unknown.
Claud Bouchard discovered Cloven are more insane alone when he secretly tortured 7 out of 8, but the last one cut his tongue off and died of blood loss.
It is revealed in "Resistance 2" by Doctor Malikov that they are hybrids of human and Chimera caused by an antidote gone wrong. Their dead have photos of their leader stuffed in their mouth and middle fingers cut off. Malikov created them himself, during some experiments involving the Chimera. It was because of his "success" in Russia that he was transferred to the American Chimeran virus experimentation program, known as "Project Abraham". He then continued his work, thus creating "The Sentinels".
Gameplay.
The "Resistance" games play similarly to most first-person shooters, and feature a variety of weapons. The weapons include both conventional weapons for the setting of the game, weapons created by the Chimera that possess unique features, and human weapons that have been modified to take advantage of the Chimera technology. Each weapon features two modes of fire which work in conjunction with each other. The human assault rifles include grenade launchers, while the Chimera "Bullseye" has a secondary mode that fires a marker, such that all bullets shot in the primary mode will strike the marked target for a short time.
The three "PlayStation 3" games feature large-scale multiplayer modes with support for up to 60 players in "Resistance 2" and up to 40 players in 'Resistance: Fall of Man'. Gameplay was reduced to smaller matches in "Resistance 3". All three console games offer extensive stat tracking for online combat, with "Resistance 2" featuring trophies that require online play to earn.
Characters.
Main characters.
Nathan Hale.
Sgt./2nd Lt./1st Lt. Nathan Hale is a quiet, reserved and ordinary soldier in the U.S. Army Rangers who, over the course of the series, becomes a famous war hero and patriot during the Chimeran conflict. He is the first main protagonist. He gets his name from the real Nathan Hale, who was an American soldier in the Revolutionary War. In "Resistance: Fall of Man", Hale's rise to fame amongst the British resistance begins when he is the sole survivor of the failed liberation of Britain, although Hale, due to volunteering for a government project called "Project Abraham" (whose purpose was to find a cure for the Chimera virus) prior to his deployment, survives due to his resistance to the virus. Hale joins up with the British Resistance, and, with his Chimera abilities, and over repeated missions, single-handedly locates the source of Chimera throughout the country and destroys it; liberating all of Britain from the Chimera permanently.
In "Resistance 2", Hale was then intercepted and picked up by Special Research Project Administration (SRPA) soldiers; and Hale is forcibly recruited into the Sentinel Program - a task force of soldiers who are all semi-immune to the virus, like Hale (in certain cases, the members include fellow Project Abraham survivors). During "Resistance: The Gathering Storm", more of Hale's history and personal life is explored, and Hale once again achieves notoriety when he effects a power change - he personally executes President Noah Grace for his treason to humanity.
Hale continues his duties against the Chimera, eventually ascending to command his own squad - Sentinel Team Echo - and with him finally reaching officer status with the rank of First Lieutenant. Hale and SRPA's fight against the Chimera, now led by "Daedalus" (actually Jordan Adam Shepherd, an old friend of Hale's), becomes increasingly desperate after Daedalus launches a successful invasion of the United States, and later successfully overruns the Liberty Defense Perimeter after a botched SRPA mission that leaves half of Hale's men dead and Hale himself on the verge of transformation into a Chimera (having neglected to have a compulsory viral inhibitor treatment well over the recommended timeframe). Hale and surviving SRPA forces launch a final attack to save America which succeeds; Daedalus is killed by Hale and the Chimera fleet is destroyed. After crash-landing his escape shuttle, Joseph Capelli, the only soldier other than Hale to be a survivor of the squad and the mission, finds Hale has almost finished transforming and about to become a Chimera. Capelli regretfully executes Hale with his M1911 pistol and says 'Forgive me, sir. It was an honor.'
Joseph Capelli.
Pvt./Sgt./Cpl. Joseph Capelli is a U.S. Marine who, despite his skills and leadership abilities, is also known to be extremely rude, very insubordinate and had a disrespectful attitude to authority; effectively sabotaging his military career. This ultimately led to him volunteering for Project Abraham to become a Sentinel, to avoid prison time. The first to be injected with the Chimera virus, Capelli ended up being one of the few that survived, though he was left permanently scarred and the injection left him emotionally unstable.
Now part of SRPA, Capelli took part in Sentinel operations against the Chimera, although his insubordination left him demoted and transferred to Sentinel Team Echo under Nathan Hale's command. Once again, before, during and after missions together during the invasion of the United States, Capelli is disrespectful towards Hale, and at one point approaches Hale when he began to succumb to the virus, and told his superior officer he would not hesitate to shoot Hale when he finished transforming. Hale merely took the threat in stride; and invited him to do so when the time came.
Eventually, after a mission to Iceland ends in failure, resulting in the death of half of Echo Team, Capelli, despite his earlier attitude, finds and rescues Hale after he is critically wounded by Daedalus. However, Fyodor Malikov is too late to stop his transformation.
After Hale awakes, Capelli briefs Hale on the bleak situation - that the Liberty Defense Perimeter has fallen and that the Baton Rouge protection camp is all that is left and the people are about to starve to death. He then explains that their only hope to destroy the Chimeran fleet, hovering above Chicxulub Crater in Mexico, with the fission bomb "Nellie" in Operation: Black Eden. Capelli, Hale and surviving SRPA forces protect the fission bomb as it is loaded onto a shuttle. Capelli, Major Blake and Hale all board the Chimeran flagship in the center of the fleet formation and make their way to the bridge. Capelli directs Hale to the bomb after Blake and his team are killed. Capelli and Hale narrowly escape after killing Daedalus and arming the bomb. The resulting EMP forces them to crash-land near the Mexican coast and knocks Capelli unconscious. After waking up, Capelli steps outside of the shuttle to see Hale looking upon two massive sphere-like objects in the sky. After asking Hale what they are, Capelli realizes he has finished transforming into a Chimeran creature. Capelli pulls out his pistol and orders Hale to stay back, only to hear Hale's response of, "This is just the beginning." Capelli hesitates to kill Hale but he knows he has no choice and, contrary to his previous attitude and threats toward the lieutenant, says, "Forgive me, Sir. It was an honor." and is forced to execute Hale with his pistol.
In "Resistance 3", Joseph Capelli was inoculated by the Hale Vaccine and dishonorably discharged by the military for being responsible for Nathan Hale's death. As a result, he gave up fighting the Chimera, who have already conquered the United States, and roamed the countryside, surviving in the wild, until arriving in Haven, Oklahoma where he met Susan Farley, the foster-sister of Hale. Circumstances between Capelli and Susan led them to be married and gave birth to a son named Jack. Since then Capelli remained with his new family in Haven for the next four years and, like much of humanity, hiding and surviving to protect his family and his home from the Chimera.
On August 9, 1957, Capelli became reunited with Dr. Fyodor Malikov, who wanted to recruit him into a mission to New York City in destroying the city's Chimeran tower that is responsible for terraforming the planet that would effectively wipe out the remnants of humanity. Capelli was unwilling to leave his family and rejected Malikov's mission for inadvertently allowing the Chimera to become aware of Haven. After helping evacuating the town as it was about to be destroyed by a Terraformer, Capelli was confronted by Susan who urged him to go with Malikov before parting ways with their son. Although bitter for leaving his family, Capelli followed his wife's urging and traveled with Malikov and began their long journey to New York City.
Two days later, Capelli and Malikov were caught in a thick fog while traveling on the Mississippi River by boat, and forced to go through the flooded ghost town of Wrightsburg. During the journey they were beset by Grims and later escaping from Dropships, Drones, and Longlegs until their boat was destroyed by Goliaths. Capelli and Malikov fortuately survived and arrived in St. Louis where they meet and help the local resistance group known as the Remnants. Their leader, Charlie Tent, proposed to Capelli of helping them acquiring a power core from a Chimeran Dropship to power their VTOL in return in providing him and Malikov a lift to New York. Capelli joined and assisted in helping the Remnants ambush a Chimeran Dropship, and though the plan went slightly awry, owing to a Chimeran counterattack and the interference of a feral Widowmaker, the plan was successful, and Capelli and Malikov were able to acquire transport to New York aboard the Remnants' VTOL.
En route, the VTOL came under attack from a Chimeran Dropship over Mount Pleasant, and Capelli was dropped to the ground during the dogfight. Making his way through an abandoned train yard and rendezvousing with Malikov, the pair were found by members of a religious community, led by Jonathan and Jean Rose, hiding in the remains of the town's coal-mining facility. In exchange for help fixing a train to get them the rest of the way to New York, Capelli was required to help the locals to kill a gargantuan Chimeran monster only ever referred to as 'Satan' that made its lair in the mining tunnels under the mountains. After a protracted battle, Capelli was able to kill the creature and the locals provided the pair with a train.
As they continued their journey by train Malikov explained to Capelli that four years before and after the failure of Operation Black Eden, SRPA had launched a disastrous attack on the New York tower that cost the lives of thousand men. Malikov warned Capelli that the chances of their success were slim to none, and that Capelli would likely never see his family again. Malikov also remarked that while the Chimera were perfectly evolved killing machines, they had no free-will or intelligence beyond the directives of their hive mind and theorized there might be a way to use it against them.
Problems later further arose as their train came under attack by marauders known as the Wardens, a band of violent and brutal survivors composed of inmates of the nearby Graterford Prison. Though Capelli managed to fight off the Wardens trying to board the train, the battle attracted the attention of a herd of Widowmakers, and the train was derailed in the carnage. Malikov was then killed and Capelli was taken prisoner by Mick Cutler, the brutal leader of the Wardens, who forced Capelli to fight for his life in a cruel, gladiatorial spectacle against Grims, Leeches and other convicts. After surviving his ordeal, Capelli was approached by Herbert Sawicki, a Warden sickened by Cutler's brutality and wanting a way out, who proposed an escape plan; to disable the Wardens' security system - a number of cannibalized Chimeran drones transmitting an all-clear signal to keep any Chimeran patrols in the immediate vicinity from investigating the prison - and then escape in the confusion.
Capelli was able to deactivate three of the drones, and while Cutler, having figured out Capelli and Herbert's plans, moved the last drone, Capelli had weakened the signal enough to lure in a number of patrol drones, who in turn drew the attention of a large number of dropships. As the Wardens desperately tried to fight off the Hybrids being dropped into the prison to investigate, Herbert went to free the other prisoners kept for the sick and cruel amusement of the Wardens while Capelli went after the last drone; though Cutler tried to stop him, after a brutal fist fight, Capelli overpowered and killed Cutler, shooting him in the head with a Magnum for avenging Malikov's death, before destroyed the last drone. With their security system gone, the Wardens were swiftly overrun as the Chimera, now alerted to their presence launched a full scale attack, Capelli, Herbert and the other prisoners made use of the confusion to escape. Capelli then advised Herbert and the others to look after each other before continuing alone on foot to New York.
Arriving to find New York all but buried in snow and ice and occupied by the Chimera, Capelli holed himself up in an abandoned building. Finding a working radio inside, Capelli broadcast a farewell message to his family, stating his fear that with Malikov dead, any chance of destroying the tower was lost. However, he decided to continue on his mission.
After making his way through the ruined city, he was overwhelmed by heavy Chimeran forces until finally being rescued by Charlie Tent in his VTOL. Charlie had been requested to take Capelli back to Oklahoma under his wife's orders; however, Capelli decided to continue to stay in New York to shut down the tower. Capelli develops a desperate plan that they would hijack a terraformer and cause it to crash into the tower, therefore closing the wormhole that is creating the terraforming process. Together with Charlie, Capelli navigated his way into the terraformer's core room where he destroyed the reactor. After successfully destroying the reactor, Capelli was pushed into the center of the core where he hung on for dear life while fending off Chimeran forces until he fell off the platform and towards the terraformer's beam where he is then fortunately saved by Charlie. They quickly flew away from New York just as the destroyed terrafomer crashed into the tower, severely damaging it and causing to disrupt the power surge and the wormhole is finally closed off. Capelli traveled back to Oklahoma, where he is reunited with his family.
James Grayson.
Lt./Pvt./Col. James Grayson is a Lieutenant from the British Royal Marines and features as the main protagonist during "Resistance: Retribution". Grayson suffered a complete breakdown when his brother Jonny was discovered within a Chimaeran conversion facility in mid-process of the conversion and is forced to follow regulations. Even though at first one of his squad members suggested that he should not do it, James took it upon himself to take his own brother's life. Grayson, despite rising to become a folk hero, is eventually tracked down, captured and sentenced to death by firing squad. The Maquis Resistance, needing Grayson's experience in their efforts to liberate Europe; arrange for his release and installation as a SRPA-contracted Maquis mercenary. Grayson helps the Maquis and British forces during Operation: Overstrike, while helping the overall progress of the Operation, he also continues his vendetta against the Chimera, but eventually with time is able to lay his emotional problems to rest. After liberating Europe, and redeeming himself in front of his British superiors, Grayson declines reinstatement to the British military, and instead joins the Maquis full-time; as Colonel Roland Malery's replacement. He went MIA during a mission to attack the Chimera in Russia, though was later revealed to still exist as a rogue soldier known as "The Cloven Killer". Grayson is last seen, infected with the Chimeran virus, in Moscow.
Fyodor Malikov.
Dr. Fyodor Malikov is a mysterious Russian scientist who is the world's greatest expert on Chimera. Malikov initially worked with the Russian government against the Chimera, although his efforts instead led to the creation of the Cloven (who, despite him not being able to control, nevertheless worship him as their "father"). Malikov was forcibly recruited by the American government, and so was one of the three co-founders of SRPA; leading research efforts into the Chimera's history in an effort to defeat them. All of Malikov's efforts, ultimately are found to have caused more harm than good; a revelation that leads Malikov to consider suicide. It was revealed in an interview for "Resistance 3" that Malikov decided to dedicate his remaining time to find a cure for the virus, feeling he owed the dead that effort.
Rachel Parker.
Cpt./Col. Rachel Parker is a highly intelligent officer, with British Army Intelligence, who worked with the military against the Chimera since the early days of the conflict. Following the invasion of Britain, and the deaths of the British military hierarchy, including Parker's father, Parker, only a Captain at the time, became "de facto" head of the British Intelligence Corps, and leader of the British Resistance. At her direction, Parker and Lieutenant Steven Cartwright engaged the Chimera in a guerrilla campaign; with Parker's brilliance and leadership keeping the Resistance going despite the odds. In "Resistance: Fall of Man", with Sergeant Nathan Hale's efforts supporting the Resistance every step of the way, Britain, eventually, was finally liberated and all Chimera on British soil were eradicated following the destruction of the tower network; Parker is implied to have developed romantic feelings for Hale; and sadly assumed Hale perished in the colossal explosion of the central tower in London.
In "Resistance: Retribution", Parker worked quickly, initiating restoration and rescue efforts throughout the country, restoring and re-deploying armed forces, beginning research efforts into the Chimera's mysterious history and reverse-engineering the Chimera's left-over nuclear reactor technology and energy weapons. At this time, Parker was promoted to Colonel and made official head of the British Intelligence Corps and "de facto" head of the British Armed Forces. Parker eventually restarted the conflict in Europe by launching an invasion of the continent, coordinating with the SRPA and Maquis Resistance to succeed (in the case of the former; she learns Hale survived and now served with SRPA's Sentinel Program, and so drafted a sealed letter to him; the contents of which are unknown - but are suspected to be some form of admission of love).
Steven Cartwright.
Lt./Mjr./Gen. Steven Cartwright is a troop leader in the British Royal Marines, who during the Chimeran invasion of Britain, and with the deaths of the British military hierarchy, becomes "de facto" head of the Royal Marines, under the command of Cpt. Rachel Parker; serving as her second-in-command of the British Resistance. Cartwright is shown to be flamboyant, flippant and easy-going; however he is also a highly competent tactician and brilliant soldier; leading many operations against the Chimera. In "Resistance: Fall of Man", Cartwright occasionally fights beside Hale during his one-man mission to end the Chimeran occupation, until he was incapacitated during the final battle. Cartwright survived and returned to duty, now promoted to Major and made official head of the British Royal Marines, once again under now-Colonel Parker. In "Resistance: Retribution", Cartwright works along with Parker and his former protege, James Grayson, to liberate Europe. In "Resistance 3", Cartwright makes a minor voice cameo, being heard on a radio during a news radio broadcast.
Richard Blake.
Mjr. Richard Blake was a Sentinel who served as a high-ranking SRPA official, being its Director of Advanced Tactical Operations, Acting-Director of Tactical Operations, and Commanding Officer of the Sentinels. Blake was introduced in "Resistance 2" and led and organised many military operations across the United States to fight back against the Chimera, even as the situation worsens. Blake also took the lead in many research and development efforts to create new weapons and technology in the war effort. Blake is killed in action during Operation: Black Eden, when he is shot dead transporting the fission bomb "Nellie".
Other media.
Novels.
"", a novel by William C. Dietz, was released in April 2009. It details what happened to Nathan Hale during the two years between the events that unfolded in Iceland; after his extraction from Great Britain, and later in San Francisco; where the Chimera launch the invasion of the United States.
"Resistance: A Hole in the Sky", an indirect sequel to "The Gathering Storm", was written by William C. Dietz. It is set before the events of "Resistance 3".
Comics.
"Resistance", a six-issue comic book limited series, began in January 2009. The first issue, "Resistance #0" (which was available as part of the "Resistance 2 Collector's Edition"), details the early history of Private Jordan Adam Shepherd, the seemingly innocent soldier who volunteered to be a test subject in Project Abraham, and, due to the machinations of Doctor Fyodor Malikov, would transform into "Daedalus"; the Leader of the Chimera. Another comic issue released was called "Metastasis" telling the tale of a Nathan Hale mission and how he is to retrieve an antidote to the chimera virus.

Rudolf Regner

Rudolf "Rudek" Regner (1917 in Dolina, Austrian Galicia – probably in June 1941, murdered by the NKVD), was a Polish scout, soldier and member of the White Couriers. Before World War II, he worked as a bookkeeper in a cooperative located in southeastern Polish town of Turka (now in Ukraine). 
Between late 1939 and mid-1940, Regner, together with a group of Polish scouts mostly from Lwow, led scores of people across Soviet-Hungarian border (see: Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact) in the Eastern Carpathians. He would lead to Budapest those Poles who wanted to escape Soviet occupation. From Hungary, he would bring newspapers and directives of General Wladyslaw Sikorski. Regner, who was born and raised in the borderland area (before the war, there had been the Polish - Czechoslovakian border), used his knowledge and skills. 
Circumstances of his death are unknown. According to some sources, he was captured by the NKVD in May 1940, while leading a group of escapees. However, it is more likely that he was arrested in Komarniki on July 8, 1940 and incarcerated in the Drohobycz military prison. On May 16, 1941, he was sentenced to death by the court of the Kiev Military District. He was shot in Lwow prison in early June 1941, just days before Operation Barbarossa (see: NKVD prisoner massacres).

Daniel Dezeuze

Daniel Dezeuze (born 1942) is a French artist and a founding member of the French group of artists called Supports-Surfaces. This group (made up of Dezeuze, Claude Viallat, Patrick Saytour, Louis Cane, André-Pierre Arnal, Vincent Bioulès, Noêl Dolla, Jean-Pierre Pincemin, André Valensi, Marc Devade, Toni Grand, and Bernard Pagès) started to form in 1966. Their common concern was a desire to deconstruct painting in order to re-examine its history and question its nature. Colour is a fundamental question in many of their works. They frequently used non-traditional materials and referred to other non-western cultures.
Biography.
Dezeuze was born in Alès, Gard. He studied Spanish literature at the university in Montpellier while attending classes at the art college. After spending several years abroad (Spain, Mexico, Canada) he finished his doctorate in Comparative Literature at the Sorbonne in Paris in 1970. 
Dezeuze's radical work from 1967 (Stretcher covered in plastic film) is in the collection of the Centre Pompidou in Paris and was shown at the Guggenheim Museum as part of the Exhibition of Masterpieces from the Centre Pompidou. 
His work over the years has been extremely varied in materials (wood, gauze, found objects, polyethylene etc.) and in tone, from the austere rigour of his flexible wooden ladders of the 1970s, to the ethereal lightness of his gauze pieces going on to the playfulness of his colourful Peintures qui perlent (Beading Paintings) which are painted wooden cubes and beads attached to a rigid framework. 
There are two main directions in his work: the first, his deconstruction of painting and its components (Ladders, Trellises, Cut Out Gauzes, Pavilions etc.) and the second, his creation of series of objects (Arms, Gathering Devices, and Receptacles) which evoke humanity's perennial activities.
Dezeuze's drawings also can be grouped in these same two directions with the addition of his sensitive and delightful evocations of nature in his series La Vie Amoureuse des Plantes (subject of an exhibition at the Centre Pompidou in 1993), his numerous and colourful Butterflies and enigmatic Grotesques.
His exhibitions have been numerous in France and abroad. He exhibited regularly at the Yvon Lambert Gallery in Paris from 1971 until 1991 and since that date at the Daniel Templon Gallery in Paris.
Daniel Dezeuze also has a considerable body of written work. In 1971 he founded the review Peinture, cahiers théoriques with Louis Cane and Marc Devade with the help of the review Tel Quel. His theoretical articles from this review are included in the publication from the Ecole Nationale des Beaux-Arts de Paris of his writings. Also included are several interviews and a great part of his published poetry.
Among his commissions must be included the mosaic floor in the Church of St. Laurent in Puy-en-Velay, his sculpture in the Tuileries Gardens, the optic fibre sculpture in the Toulouse subway and his redecoration, incorporating several of his works, of the Hôtel du Sully in Paris.

Policy capturing

Policy capturing or "the PC technique" is a statistical method used in social psychology to quantify the relationship between a person's judgement and the information that was used to make that judgement. Policy capturing assessments rely upon regression analysis models. Policy capturing is frequently used by businesses to assess employee performance.

Policy capturing is a technique that is used to examine how individuals reach decisions. Policy capturing is regarded as a form of judgment analysis and had been applied to a variety of settings and contexts (see Cooksey, 1996).
A typical example was reported by Sherer, Schwab and Heneman (1987), in their study of how supervisors, in the setting of a private hospital, reach decisions about salary rises. Participants of this study, called judges, received information about a set of employees. The employees differed on five key factors: performance level was average or superior, performance was consistent or inconsistent, current salary was low, medium, or high, and the individuals either had or had not been offered another job from a different organization. After reading information about each employee, participants then decided whether the percentage and absolute increase in salary they would recommend. Which of these five factors shaped the decisions varied appreciably across the participants.
Hitt and Barr reported another excellent example of policy capturing. This study assessed which factors determine evaluations of job applicants and corresponding salaries. The participants or judges-66 managers who often need to reach similar decisions in their work lives-read the applications of these applicants and watched a video presentation that each candidate had prepared. Several variables differed across applicants: the applicants, for example, had accumulated either 10 or 15 years of experience, were 35 or 35 years of age, were male or female, were African or Caucasian, had completed a BS or MBA, and were applying to be a regional sales manager or vice president of sales. Subsequent analysis showed that factors unrelated to experience, such as age and sex, affected decisions. Furthermore, the relevance of each factor interacted with one another

Parc Cwm long cairn

Parc Cwm long cairn (), also known as Parc le Breos burial chamber (), is a partly restored Neolithic chambered tomb, identified in 1937 as a Severn-Cotswold type of chambered long barrow. The cromlech, a megalithic burial chamber, was built around 5850 years before present (BP), during the early Neolithic. It is about seven  miles (12 km) west south–west of Swansea, Wales, in what is now known as Coed y Parc Cwm at Parc le Breos, on the Gower Peninsula.
A trapezoidal cairn of rubble – the upper part of the cromlech and its earth covering now removed – about long by (at its widest), is revetted by a low dry-stone wall. A bell-shaped, south-facing forecourt, formed by the wall, leads to a central passageway lined with limestone slabs set on end. Human remains had been placed in the two pairs of stone chambers that lead from the passageway. Corpses may have been placed in nearby caves until they decomposed, when the bones were moved to the tomb.
The cromlech was discovered in 1869 by workmen digging for road stone. An excavation later that year revealed human bones (now known to have belonged to at least 40 people), animal remains, and Neolithic pottery. Samples from the site show the tomb to have been in use for between 300 and 800 years. North-West European lifestyles changed around 6000 BP, from the nomadic lives of the hunter-gatherer, to a settled life of agricultural farming: the Neolithic Revolution. However, analysis of the human remains found at Parc Cwm long cairn show the people interred in the cromlech continued to be either hunter-gatherers or herders, rather than agricultural farmers.
Parc Cwm long cairn lies in a former medieval deer park, established in the 1220s CE by the Marcher Lord of Gower as Parc le Breos – an enclosed area of about , now mainly farmland. The cromlech is on the floor of a dry narrow limestone gorge containing about of woodland. Free pedestrian access is via an asphalt track leading from the park's entrance, which has free parking for 12–15 cars about from the site. Parc Cwm long cairn is maintained by "Cadw", the Welsh Government's historic environment division.
History.
From the end of the last ice age (between 12,000 and 10,000 BP) Mesolithic hunter-gatherers began to migrate northwards from Central Europe; the area that would become known as Wales was free of glaciers by about 10,250 BP. At that time sea levels were much lower than today, and the shallower parts of what is now the North Sea were dry land. The east coast of present day England and the coasts of present day Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands were connected by the former landmass known as Doggerland, forming the British Peninsula on the European mainland. The post-glacial rise in sea level separated Wales and Ireland, forming the Irish Sea. Doggerland was submerged by the North Sea and, by 8000 BP, the British Peninsula had become an island. By the beginning of the Neolithic (6,000 BP) sea levels in the Bristol Channel were still about lower than today. Historian John Davies has theorised that the story of "Cantre'r Gwaelod's" drowning, and tales in the "Mabinogion" of the water between Wales and Ireland being narrower and shallower, may be distant folk memories of that time. The warmer climate caused major changes to the flora and fauna of Great Britain, and encouraged the growth of dense forest that covered 80–90% of the island.
Human lifestyles in North-West Europe changed around 6000 BP; from the Mesolithic ("Middle Stone Age") nomadic lives of hunting and gathering, to the Neolithic ("New Stone Age") agrarian life of agriculture and settlement. John Davies notes that such a transformation cannot have been developed by the people living in North-West Europe independently, as neither the grain necessary for crops nor the animals suitable for domestication are indigenous to the area. Recent genetic studies conclude that these cultural changes were introduced to Britain by farmers migrating from the European mainland. They cleared the forests to establish pasture and to cultivate the land, developed new technologies such as ceramics and textile production, and used a similar tradition of long barrow construction that began in continental Europe during the 7th millennium BP – the free standing megalithic structures supporting a sloping capstone (known as dolmens), common across Atlantic Europe that were, according to John Davies, "the first substantial, permanent constructions of man". Such massive constructions would have needed a large labour force (up to 200 men) suggestive of large communities nearby. However, in his contribution to "History of Wales, 25,000 BC AD 2000", archaeologist Joshua Pollard notes that not all Neolithic communities were part of the simultaneous "marked transformations in material culture, ideology and technical practices" known as the Neolithic Revolution.
Severn-Cotswold tombs.
The cromlech at Parc le Breos Cwm is one of 120–30 sites identified as belonging to the category of long barrow tomb known as the Severn-Cotswold or Cotswold-Severn group. Excavations show these tombs to have been built on sites that had already "gained some significance". Archaeologist Julian Thomas theorises that these sites may have been "very long-lived woodland clearances" that had become landmarks and meeting-places.
Constructed during the Neolithic, cairns in the Severn-Cotswold tradition share several characteristics: an elongated trapezoidal (or wedge) shape up to long; a "cairn" (a mound of deliberately placed stones or rocks erected as a memorial or marker); a revetment (retaining wall) of carefully constructed dry-stone walling that also defines a horned forecourt at the widest end; huge capstones supported by orthostats; and a chamber (or chambers) in which human remains were placed, accessible after the cairn was completed by way of a gallery (passageway). Diverse internal transept chamber plans exist within the group. The earlier tombs contained multiple chambers set laterally, or pairs of transept chambers leading from a central passageway; the later, terminally chambered tombs, contained a single chamber.
As the name implies, Severn-Cotswold cairns are concentrated mainly to the east of the River Severn, in and around the Cotswolds, in present-day England. However, similar Severn-Cotswold type structures have been identified in south east Wales – between Brecon, the Gower Peninsula and Gwent – and in Capel Garmon (near Betws-y-Coed, Conwy, north Wales), Wayland's Smithy (Oxfordshire, England) and Avebury (Wiltshire, England). As well as monuments to house and to honour their departed ancestors, these cromlechs may have been communal and ceremonial sites where, according to archaeologist Francis Pryor, people met "to socialise, to meet new partners, to acquire fresh livestock and to exchange ceremonial gifts".
Parc Cwm long cairn is one of six chambered tombs discovered on the Gower Peninsula and one of 17 in what is commonly known as Glamorgan. Severn-Cotswold cairns are the oldest surviving examples of architecture in Great Britain – Parc Cwm long cairn was built about 1,500 to 1,300 years before either Stonehenge or the Great Pyramid of Giza, Egypt was completed.
Features.
The megalithic cromlech at Parc le Breos Cwm, known as Parc Cwm long cairn (), is a Severn-Cotswold type chambered tomb, built around 5850 BP (during the early Neolithic) in what is now known as the Gower Peninsula – about eight miles (13 km) west of Swansea, Wales, and about miles (2 km) north of the Bristol Channel. Alternative names include Parc le Breos burial chamber (), the Long Cairn and the Giant's Grave.
The cromlech consists of a north–south aligned long mound of locally obtained rocks and cobbles, mainly of limestone, revetted by two coursed, dry-stone kerbs of "a fine standard". The inner wall was built using a heavier stone. Trapezoid-shaped and about long, the cromlech tapers from wide at its southern entrance to about at its northern end. The wall at the front, right section, is missing or has collapsed, and the rubble has tumbled out leaving a previously covered orthostat exposed.
At the entrance to the tomb the kerbs sweep inwards to form a pair of deep protrusions, or horns, forming a narrow bell-shaped forecourt. A straight central passageway (or gallery), long by wide, orientated north–south, leads from the forecourt into the cairn. Each side of the passageway is lined with thin limestone slabs known as orthostats, placed on end and up to high with a coursed dry-stone infill between the slabs. Two pairs of rectangular transept chambers lead from the passageway, averaging  feet (1.6 m), east–west, by  feet (1.0 m); or "6 ft by 2 ft", according to "Archaeologia Cambrensis" in 1886. Each, except the south west chamber, has shallow limestone sillstones at its entrance.
Archaeologist R J C Atkinson believed that (unusually among cairns in the Severn-Cotswold tradition) Parc Cwm long cairn had been built beside a stream that now flows underground. He noted that the stones on the eastern side had "marked signs of erosion and rounding by silt-laden flood-water".
Originally, the transept chambers would have been covered with one large (or several smaller) capstones, enclosing the chambers containing human remains. The earth covering and the upper part of the cromlech have been removed, leaving the passageway and lateral chambers fully exposed. There is no record of a capstone having been discovered.
Excavation.
Workmen digging for road stone discovered the site in 1869. John Lubbock and Hussey Vivian excavated it that year, believing it to be a round barrow. The excavation revealed human bones that were "much broken and in no regular arrangement", animal remains ("deer and swine's teeth"), and sherds of "plain Western Neolithic pottery". The bones, initially thought to heve been disturbed by repeated access or subsequent interments, were at first thought to be from 20–24 individuals, all of whom except three were adults. Archaeologists Alasdair Whittle and Michael Wysocki note that such estimates were commonly based on the "numbers of skulls or mandibles", and recent analysis has shown the bones to be from at least 40 individuals. Following the excavation, most of the human remains were reburied in clay pots beneath their original contexts, some are held in the Ashmolean Museum, University of Oxford, England – with the animal and pottery remains – and the whereabouts of the remainder are unrecorded.
An excavation led by Professor Glyn Daniel in 1937 identified the site as a chambered long barrow. However, more recently, long barrows have been defined as having long earthen mounds with wooden internal structures, whereas chambered tombs, while also being covered by a long mound, have internal chambers built of stone. No long barrows with wooden internal structures have been identified in southeast Wales, perhaps because long barrows were usually built where there was no suitable stone.
At Parc Cwm long cairn a variety of mortuary practices was evident and the deliberate ordering of skeletal parts noticeable. Whittle and Wysocki (1998) note cremated human remains were placed only in the front, right (south–east) chamber, where females and males, and all age ranges were represented. The south–east chamber was also unusual in that it contained nearly three times as many individuals as in each of the other chambers, which contained the remains of all representative groups except younger children and infants. At the forecourt entrance Atkinson recorded finds, deposited in groups, including: flint debitage, lithic cores and a bladelet (burnt and unburnt); a leaf-shaped arrowhead (burnt); pieces of quartz; pieces of stalactite (now missing); sherds of Neolithic pottery; and cremated bone fragments. Atkinson speculated that the stalactite originated from Cat Hole cave, which (along with Tooth Hole cave) Whittle and Wysocki note as a possible source of the quartz too.
Following the excavation led by R J C Atkinson in 1960, the cromlech was placed under the guardianship of the then Ministry of Public Building and Works
and, in 1961, was partly restored. Atkinson made "minimal" excavation records, and no report of it was published until Whittle and Wysocki's detailed report in 1998. In it, they suggest that corpses may have been placed in caves near the cromlech until they decomposed, when the bones were moved to the tomb; a process known as excarnation.
Analysis.
Few human remains survive in Great Britain from the early Neolithic (c. 6400–c. 5850 BP), although they are comparatively well preserved in the Black Mountains (), the Gower Peninsula and the Vale of Glamorgan () where up to 50 individuals have been interred – men, women and children – in each cromlech.
The skeletal remains of over 40 individuals were recovered from the cromlech at Parc le Breos Cwm, some of which showed evidence of weathering and of biting and gnawing by animals. This suggests the corpses lay exposed to decompose and were interred in the burial chambers defleshed, as parcels of bone. Skeletal remains from the passageway were part–articulated, showing no sign of animal scavenging, suggesting they were placed in the cromlech as fleshed corpses. Whittle and Wysocki note that among the human remains are the bones of "8 dogs, a cat, a red deer, pig, sheep and cattle". They speculate that the two caves near the cromlech were used as depositories for the corpses prior to decomposition, and that when the bones were collected from the caves for reinterment others already lying in the cave were unwittingly gathered too.
Radiocarbon dated samples from the cromlech show the tomb was accessed by many generations over a period of 300–800 years, and that the human bones are the disarticulated remains (i.e., not complete skeletons) of at least 40 individuals: male and female adults, adolescents, children, and infants. One of the red deer bones has been radiocarbon dated to between 2750 BP and 2150 BP, showing that at least some of the bones entered long after the site had been deserted.
Lifestyle indicators.
Examination of the bones from which stature could be estimated, indicate that the male mortuary population were "big men" – the 1869 report notes males of "gigantic proportions" – whereas the females were "short and gracile". Pollard notes that males analysed from Parc Cwm long cairn were "particularly robust" when compared to females.
Prior to the publication of Whittle and Wysocki's 1998 report, bones and teeth of the mortuary population of Parc Cwm long cairn were re-examined for indications of lifestyle and diet.
Musculoskeletal analysis showed significant gender lifestyle variation. Greater leg muscle development was found in males of the Parc Cwm cromlech, possibly the result of hunting or herding, confirming the sexual dimorphism found in previous analyses of the remains. In contrast, no such variation was noticeable in the remains found during excavations from other nearby sites, for example the Tinkinswood burial chamber, in the Vale of Glamorgan. The variation in musculoskeletal stress markers may indicate a mobile lifestyle for at least some of the males analysed.
Evidence obtained from stable isotope analysis shows plant foods, including cereals, formed only a small proportion of their dietary protein. The majority derived from animals – i.e., meat, and milk or blood – and contained none from marine sources.
Remains of human teeth were analysed for evidence of arrested development and decay. Arrested development implies periods of nutritional shortage, which could indicate failed harvests. Decay implies either periods of food shortage, or a diet consisting of high proportions of carbohydrate or softer cooked meat, or both. Dental analyses showed no sign of periods of decay or arrested development, even where there was "considerable wear", indicating a lifestyle that was not dependent on farming cereals. The 1887 bone report notes the "good condition of the teeth". Whittle and Wysocki noted the "slight" presence of tartar, and that only one tooth had been lost before death, a mandibular incisor.
Whittle and Wysocki conclude, from the skeletal and dental analyses, that the lifestyles of the people who were to be interred in the cromlech either continued to be one of hunting and gathering or, more likely, a pastoral life of herding, rather than one of agrarian-based farming.
Cathole Cave.
The Cathole Cave, Cat Hole Cave or Cathole Rock Cave, is a steep limestone outcrop, about north of the cromlech along the Parc le Breos Cwm valley and near the top of the gorge, about from the valley floor. The cave is a deep triangular fissure penetrating the hillside and narrowing towards the top. It has two entrances, with a natural platform outside the larger of the two.
The cave was used as a shelter by bands of Mesolithic hunters and as a Neolithic ossuary. During the first excavation of the cave in 1864, finds were made only from the Mesolithic to medieval periods. In his "The Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society vol.25 (1959), pp. 260–69", archaeologist Charles McBurney notes that "In the Post Glacial period the cave was much used by Mesolithic hunters"; a conclusion confirmed by John Campbell's excavation of 1977.
A 1984 excavation by Aldhouse-Green revealed the earliest finds from the cave, two tanged points that may date to c. 28,000 BP, an interglacial period during the Late Pleistocene roughly contemporaneous with the Red Lady of Paviland. The "lady" was discovered in a cave between Port Eynon and Rhossili, about eight miles (13 km) west of Cathole Cave, and has been radiocarbon dated to c. 29,000 BP, the oldest known human burial in Great Britain.
Rock art from the Upper Paleolithic, thought to represent a reindeer, was discovered on the back wall of Cathole Cave in September 2010. The engraving, measuring approximately 15 x 11 cm, has been radiocarbon dated to 14,505 ± 560 BP. According to George Nash, the archeologist who made the discovery, it is "the oldest rock art in the British Isles, if not north-western Europe".
Late glacial tool finds from the Upper Palaeolithic date to c. 12,000 BP: flint blades known as Cheddar points; smaller bladelets known as Cresswell points; scrapers; burins or lithic flakes; flint and bone awls; and a bone needle. Flint rarely occurs in Wales other than in drifts, or as small pebbles on beaches. Flint tools would therefore have to have been brought to the Gower Peninsula from other areas, such as those now known as southern or eastern England, or Antrim, either as finished tools or as incomplete, or unworked, nodules. Remains of Red Fox, Arctic Fox, Brown Bear, Tundra Vole, and possibly reindeer, were found at the same level as the Upper Palaeolithic tools, providing evidence of the climate c. 12,000 BP. Other animal remains excavated during the 19th century, which may predate the Late glacial finds, include mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, Red Deer and Giant Deer.
Several finds date to the Bronze Age, including a bronze socketed axe, two human skeletons, and sherds of pottery from burial urns and other vessels.
Llethryd Tooth Cave.
An excavation of the Llethryd Tooth Cave, or Tooth Hole cave, a Bronze Age ossuary site at a cave about north, north west of the cromlech, was carried out by D. P. Webley and J. Harvey in 1962. It revealed the disarticulated remains of six people, dated to the Early Bronze Age or Beaker culture. Other contemporary finds, now held at the Amgueddfa Cymru–National Museum Wales, Cardiff, include collared urn pottery, flaked knives, a scraper, flint flakes, a bone spatula, a needle and bead, and animal bones – the remains of domesticated animals, including cat and dog. Whittle and Wysocki note that this period of occupation may be "significant", with respect to Parc Cwm long cairn, as it is "broadly contemporary with the secondary use of the tomb".
Location.
The Neolithic cromlech at Parc le Breos is about seven  miles (12 km) west south–west of Swansea, Wales, near the centre of the Gower Peninsula, midway between the villages of Llanrhidian and Bishopston. Its nearest village is Parkmill, a small rural settlement about one mile (1.5 km) to the south–east.
Parc Cwm long cairn lies on the floor of a dry, narrow, limestone gorge, at an elevation of about above sea level, less than  miles (2 km) from the south coast of the Gower Peninsula. It is in about of woodland called Coed y Parc, the remnants of a former medieval deer park (Parc le Breos) from which the cromlech derives its alternative name: Parc le Breos burial chamber. Established as an enclosed area of about by John de Braose, Marcher Lord of Gower, in about 1221–32 CE, the park is now mainly farmland. A 19th-century hunting lodge about north–east of Parc Cwm long cairn has been converted into a hotel and pony trekking (horse riding) centre called Parc le Breos.
Coed y Parc is owned and managed by Forestry Commission Wales. The site is open to the public free of charge and has parking for 12–15 cars about away. Facing the car park on the opposite side of the lane, a kissing gate allows wheelchair access to a level asphalt track running past the cromlech down the length of the gorge, passing within about of the cairn. Parc Cwm long cairn is maintained by "Cadw" (), the Welsh Government's historic environment division.

Neurobics

Neurobics are mental exercises, that claim to enhance the brain's performance. These exercises are described by Lawrence Katz and Manning Rubin in their book "Keep Your Brain Alive", however they are not scientifically proven. The term neurobics was popularized by Lawrence Katz in 1999. It is presumed that unusual sensory stimulation and activities like non-routine actions and thoughts, produce more of such chemicals of the neurobiology system of body that encourage growth of new dendrites and neurons in the brain. Routine actions become so automatic to the individual that most of actions are done largely unconsciously. Such automated or unconscious actions require less activity in the brain, and exercise it less. With the help of neurobics exercises, it is claimed that one can stimulate the brain. An example of a neurobic exercise is to carry out a routine action such as dialing a phone number or brushing your teeth with your non-dominant hand, or performing a series of tasks with you eyes closed. Other neurobiologists suggest that neurobics can slow aging of the brain.
“Neurobics as developed by Dr.Lawrence C. Katz and Manning Rubin is based upon solid scientific evidence that novel activities and exercises using all your senses can enhance the production of growth factors that strengthen synapses and improve mental fitness including memory."

Henry Stephen Fox (22 September 1791, Chatham – 13 October 1846, Washington DC) was a British diplomat.
Life.
As the only son of General Henry Edward Fox (1755–1811), Henry was educated at Eton College. Matriculating from Christ Church, Oxford in 1809, his wit, charm, love of gambling (shared by his uncle Charles James Fox) and manners made him popular in fashionable circles. He also shared his uncle's Whig views and served as attaché with the mission to the Sicilian court (1814–1818) and then with the French mission (1818–24). In the latter he was arrested for debt and only the French government's intervention got him released. He next served as secretary of legation at Turin (1824), chargé d'affaires at Turin (1824–25), secretary of the legation at Naples (1826–27) and chargé d'affaires at Naples (1827–28).
He was gazetted secretary of legation at Vienna in 1828, but refused this appointment to become first minister-plenipotentiary and envoy-extraordinary at Buenos Aires then Rio de Janeiro (with the civil war delaying his departure until 1831). He was there from 1831 to 1836, when he moved to be British ambassador to the United States of America, in the midst of disputes over slavery and Canada that seemed likely to lead to war. Fox did not enjoy his American posting and became more and more reclusive (though he did take up botanical collecting), but he still objected to Robert Peel's government sending Lord Ashburton to settle the north-eastern boundary dispute over Fox's head. He was retired from the post in 1843 to clear the way to a successful treaty to solve the Oregon dispute. He stayed on in Washington, where he died from a morphine overdose in 1846 and was buried in the Congressional Cemetery, passing his botanical collection to his nephew Sir Charles James Fox Bunbury.

A disc lock is a portable security device for motorcycles and scooters. Disc-locks use the holes in a motorcycle's or scooter's brake disc. A locking pin passes through the hole in the brake disc and locks to the other side of the lock, using either a pushdown-and-click locking mechanism or a more robust double-locking mechanism. When in place, the disc-lock discourages theft by blocking the vehicle from being moved in either forward or reverse direction.

William Henry Houghton

William Henry "Will" Houghton (June 28, 1887 - June 14, 1947) was an evangelist and the fourth president of Moody Bible Institute, in Chicago. Biographer Wilbur Smith said of him: "Two primary passions possessed the soul of Will H. Houghton: From the beginning of his ministry to the end… evangelism, and the study of the word of God." Houghton was known for his fundamentalist Christianity.
Biographical details.
William was born in South Boston, Massachusetts, to John William Houghton and Carrie Maude Grant of Nova Scotia, Canada. William Houghton was converted to Christianity at age 14, during at evangelistic meeting in Lynn, Massachusetts. In June 1914, Houghton married Adelaide Franks and they had two children, Adelaide Maude and Everett Arthur. Adelaide Franks Houghton died two years later, and William Houghton remarried in December 1918 to Elizabeth Andrews. On December 8, 1919, they had a son, Firman Andrews. William Houghton, himself, died of a heart attack in 1947, while still president of MBI.
Education.
Initially interested in theatre and active in the Vaudeville Circuit, Houghton became convinced in 1909 to give up drama and, instead, enrolled at the Pentecostal Collegiate Institute, in North Scituate, Rhode Island, but soon left without finishing. He was later awarded an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree, in 1931, by Wheaton College and an honorary Doctor of Law degree by Bob Jones University, in 1942.
Ministry.
Houghton took his first pastorate at the First Baptist Church of Canton, Pennsylvania, in 1915. After two years, Houghton left to pursue evangelistic work throughout New York and Pennsylvania. After a series of revivalistic meetings at a Baptist church in New Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in the spring of 1918, he accepted their offer of the pastorate and stayed until he took a new pastorate at the First Baptist Church of Norristown, Pennsylvania, in the fall of 1920. Houghton then pastored at the First Baptist Tabernacle of Atlanta, from 1925 to 1928, and the Calvary Baptist Church in New York City, the headquarters of the New York Youth Christian Center, from 1930 to 1934. In 1932 he founded the New York Summer School of Theology.
MBI presidency.
In 1934, James M. Gray, then-president of Moody Bible Institute, visited Calvary Baptist and, impressed with Houghton, offered the evangelist the presidency of the Institute. The MBI Board of Trustees extended an official offer on August 16, 1934, and Houghton succeeded Gray on November 1, 1934. Houghton was president at MBI for 12 years. During his first 11 years, enrollment increased 70 percent. He also directed the "D.L. Moody Centenary Celebration" that was held on February 5, 1937 and oversaw construction of a 12-story administrative building at 820 North LaSalle Boulevard, which was dedicated on February 4, 1939 (renamed Crowell Hall in 1945). In addition to having WMBI radio begin broadcasting regularly, Houghton established fundamentalist chain radio broadcasts and the Moody Institute of Science. In 1950, the Institute named a nine-story women's dormitory Houghton Hall after William Henry Houghton.

Anne Abbott

Anne Wales Abbott or, Abbot (April 10, 1808 – June 1, 1908) was a game designer, magazine editor, literary reviewer, and author.
Life.
Abbott was born 10 April 1808, the daughter of Reverend Abiel Abbott, a Beverly, Massachusetts clergyman, and Eunice Abbott.
Abbott (sic) designed the hugely popular card game "Dr. Busby," which was published by W. & S. B. Ives of Salem, Massachusetts on March 7, 1843. It sold 15,000 copies in its first eighteen months
Abbot authored her second game "The Racers" which was sold in Salem, Mass. through J. P. Jewett on January 13, 1844. "The Racers" was not published by W. & S. B. Ives as it is not advertised with other published W. & S. B. Ives games in her book, "DOCTOR BUSBY AND HIS NEIGHBORS" which was typeset by November 24, 1844 but not released for sale until December 28, 1844.
She released her third game "Master Rodbury", September 14, 1844. This time she again used W. & S. B. Ives as the publisher.
Abbot published her first book, "WILLIE ROGERS" sometime before November 24, 1844, quickly followed by her second book, "DOCTOR BUSBY AND HIS NEIGHBORS" on December 28, 1844.
Before 1991 Anne Wales Abbot was credited for authoring "The Mansion of Happiness" board game which was released by W. & S. B. Ives on November 24, 1843. "The Mansion of Happiness" was originally released in England in 1800, and authored by George W. M. Fox. She may have collaborated with S. B. (Stephen Bradshaw) Ives, but neither Anne nor Stephen, authored the W. & S. B. Ives published version which was an almost exact copy of the English game.
Before 1992 Abbot was credited for authoring the extremely long lasting card game of "Authors" which was published in 1861 by A. Augustus Smith of G. M. Whipple and A. A. Smith. They were also publishers in Salem, Mass. but the publishing house was one block away from the original W. & S. B. Ives bookstore at 230 Essex Street. That bookstore and publishing house, 232 Essex Street were now owned by Henry P. Ives, S. B. Ives son. Actually, the game of "Authors" was invented by "a coterie of bright young ladies" of Salem and presented by a gentleman to A. Augustus Smith for publication. By 1861, Anne Abbot would have been in her fifties, not fitting the description of the designers of "Authors".
In July 1850, Abbott reviewed Hawthorne's "The Scarlet Letter" for the "North American Review", declaring she liked the preface better than the tale. Abbott disapproved of Hawthorne's subject matter and believed he had allowed his good judgement to be carried away by "the magic power of the style." Hawthorne referred to Abbott as one of that "damned mob of scribbling women."
Abbott served gratuitously as editor (1851–1858) of "The Child's Friend", a literary journal for young people. Profits from the publication were directed to the relief of indigent and neglected children.
In 1853, Abbott's "Autumn Leaves: Original Pieces in Prose and Verse" was published by John Bartlett of Cambridge. Children's books by Abbott include "Doctor Busby and His Neighbors," "Kate and Lizzie, or Six Months Out of School," "Lost Wheelbarrow and Other Stories," and "The Tamed and the Untamed and Other Stories."
Abbott died at Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1 June 1908.

Klark Teknik

Klark Teknik is a company founded in 1971 by brothers Terence and Phillip Clarke. At this time it was known as “Klark Equipment”, a company that produced garage forecourt equipment; vending style vacuum cleaners, space heaters and other similar products. 
Phillip was the entrepreneur having previously run a clothing business in Australia. Terry was the engineer; and had worked for Decca and was also an active local musician. With this background the company soon branched into professional audio; at first upgrading /customising Decca multi-track tape recorders and later producing a very high quality ¼ inch 2-track tape machine of their own, the SM2. This was sold to the BBC and independent broadcasting companies under the brand name “Teknik”. 
Terry also started to develop signal processing hardware including compressor/limiters and small graphic equalisers. These were produced in very low quantities and sold to (mostly local) recording studios to complement the relatively simple audio mixing console of the day. The graphic equalisers developed during 1973 onwards were called Teknik 7S and 9S, with seven and nine bands respectively, plus a stereo 11+11S with eleven bands of EQ.
In 1974 the brand name “Klark Teknik” came into being. 1976 saw the first KT product produced in real volume, the DN27 (later DN27A and previously DN27S). Approximately 6500 units shipped between 1977 and 1985.
In 1980 the company moved to its current purpose built premises at Walter Nash Road, Kidderminster. Up until this point the business had been run out of an old Nissen hut in a back corner of the Summerfield MOD solid fuel rocket motor factory with only 15 employees.
1985 Klark Teknik PLC was formed. In the following year Klark Teknik acquired the Hounslow based studio mixing company DDA and subsequently moved the manufacturing to Kidderminster. In 1986, Klark Teknik further diversified by developing active studio monitors under the brand “Klark Acoustic”.
1986 Klark Teknik received a Queen’s award for export . It also launched the DN772 a seven second profanity delay with innovative time re-setting technology without pitch shifting artefacts, which featured in the BBC programme “Tomorrow’s World”. 
1987 saw Klark Teknik purchase Midas Audio Systems Ltd. In 1992, the Clarke brothers sold Klark Teknik Group to Mark IV Audio. Terry Clarke went on to set up MC2 Audio Ltd with co-founder Ian McCarthy in 1994, which produce high quality power amplifiers for the commercial market.
MK VI Audio sold both their holdings of EVI Audio (owners of Klark Teknik) and Telex Communications to venture capitalists Greenwich Street Partners in 1998 merging them into a single corporation Telex Communications. On September 1, 2006 Greenwich sold Telex Communications to Bosch.
In December 2009, Midas and Klark Teknik were acquired by Music Group, a holding company chaired by Uli Behringer, which also owns other audio companies such as Behringer and Bugera as well as Electronic Manufacturing Services company Eurotec.

Ed Mann

Ed Mann is a musician who is "a drummer and piano dabbler since childhood." He is best known for his mallet percussion performances onstage with Frank Zappa's ensemble from 1977 to 1988, and his appearances on over 30 of Zappa's albums, both studio recordings and with Zappa's band live. Mann also has released a number of CDs as a bandleader and composer.
Career.
Mann formed a band with Tommy Mars in mid 1973. By the end of that year he was studying with John Bergamo at CalArts. In 1977 Frank Zappa asked Bergamo to do some overdubbing on the "Zappa In New York" album and Bergamo in turn recommended Mann.
A few months later Ruth Underwood told Mann that Zappa was looking for a second keyboard player. When Ed called to recommend Tommy ("at midnite, the only time when you could reach Frank by phone"), Frank invited him to "come up to the house". Mann went to the house, where Terry Bozzio, Patrick O'Hearn, and Adrian Belew were jamming with Zappa. By 2:00am Ed was "in the band". Ed Mann later commented: "It took a few days for that all to sink in."
Mann can be heard playing gongs on J21's "Yellow Mind:Blue Mind" album.
Mann is a member of The Band From Utopia. In 2008, Ed Mann toured with Project Object and sat in with Agent Moosehead at the New York Harvest Festival and Freedom Rally.
Discography with Zappa.
Mann's performance can be seen in the Zappa movies "Baby Snakes", "Dub Room Special" & "Video From Hell".

List of Dungeons &amp; Dragons rulebooks

This is a list of "Dungeons & Dragons" rulebooks for the "Dungeons & Dragons" ("D&D") fantasy role-playing game, sorted by the edition of the game that they appeared in. This list does not include books designed for use as premade adventures.
"Basic Dungeons & Dragons".
"Basic Dungeons & Dragons", known as the "Basic Set" was the successor to Original "Dungeons & Dragons" and was released while TSR, Inc. was working on the "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons" set. This set was the beginning of the split into two separate games, driven by disagreements on the direction the game should take. The Basic set retained the simplicity and flexibility that had made the original game such a best-seller while Gary Gygax took "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons" in a more structured and complicated direction.
Initially it was expected that players would start using Basic edition and then 'graduate' to "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons". However, in 1981 the Basic Set underwent a completely new revision and not long after this the Expert Set was released for the first time. All references to a progression from the Basic Set to "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons" were removed from the games and supplements as TSR, Inc. made clear that the expected progression was from the Basic Set to the Expert Set. From this point the "D&D Dichotomy" became fixed and the Basic/Expert set pair were considered a completely separate game from "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons". This separation continued until the eventual reintegration of the two streams into a single game in 2000 with "Dungeons & Dragons", third edition.
"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons".
"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons" ("AD&D") greatly expanded upon the rules and settings of the original "D&D" game when it was released in 1977. As such, this edition saw the publication of numerous books to assist players. The naming of the core books in this edition became the standard for all later editions.
"Advanced Dungeons & Dragons" 2nd edition.
In 1989, "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons" 2nd edition was published. By the end of its first decade, "Advanced Dungeons & Dragons" had expanded to several rulebooks, including three "Monster Manual"s, and two books governing character skills in wilderness and underground settings. Initially, the second edition would consolidate the game, with three essential books to govern Dungeon Masters and players alike. Periodically, TSR published optional rulebooks for character classes and races to enhance game play.
"Dungeons & Dragons" 3rd edition and v3.5.
A major revision of the "AD&D" rules was released in 2000. As the Basic game had been discontinued some years earlier, and the more straightforward title was more marketable, the word "Advanced" was dropped and the new edition was called just "Dungeons & Dragons", but was still officially referred to as 3rd edition (or 3E for short).
This edition was the first to be released by Wizards of the Coast after their acquisition of the company, as well as the first to allow third-party companies to make supplemental materials by use of the Open Game License. A series of Map Folios were also produced.
In July 2003, a revised version of the 3rd edition "D&D" rules (termed version 3.5) was released that incorporated numerous rule changes, as well as expanding the "Dungeon Master's Guide and Monster Manual".
"Dungeons & Dragons" 4th edition.
The books from the "main" product line of 4th Edition are split into Core Rules and Supplement books. Unlike third edition of "Dungeons & Dragons", which had the core rulebooks released in monthly installments, the 4th editions of the "Player's Handbook", "Monster Manual", and "Dungeon Master's Guide" were all released in June 2008.
In addition, beginning in September 2010 the stand-alone "Essentials" product line was released, aiming at novice players.

84th Flying Training Squadron

The 84th Flying Training Squadron (84 FTS) is part of the 47th Flying Training Wing based at Laughlin Air Force Base, Texas. It operates T-6 Texan II aircraft conducting flight training. 
History.
World War II.
The squadron was first activated in 1942, as the 84th Pursuit Squadron (Interceptor). Soon after its activation the US Army transferred the squadron to England where it lost a majority of its pilots and planes to the American war effort in North Africa. During the war the 84th flew missions ranging from bomber escort, ground attack, counter-air, and close air support. 
In April 1943, the unit was involved in its first combat mission in North Africa. In June 1944, the 84th supported the Allied landings at Normandy and directly contributed to the breakthrough at Saint-Lô in July 1944. In September 1944, the squadron contributed to the Allied victory in the Arnhem-Nijmegen airborne landings; notably, they suppressed numerous ground positions during the airborne assault and were credited with saving scores of American and British troop transports. For this action the 84th received the Distinguished Unit Citation.
In December 1944 the 84th began flying the P-51 Mustang. They used their new plane very successfully and on 10 April destroyed 58 aircraft on the ground earning the 84th its second Distinguished Unit Citation. In April 1945 the 84th flew its last combat mission escorting British bombers on their way to Hitler's "Eagles Nest". The squadron completed three years overseas and was credited with 260 German aircraft destroyed.
Air Defense Command.
The 84th served as part of the occupation forces until it transferred to the United States in June 1947, where it eventually assumed an air defense mission. Assigned to Air Defense Command and initially equipped with P-51 Mustangs assigned to Hamilton AFB, California with a mission for the air defense of San Francisco and the Bay Area. Upgraded to F-84D Thunderjet jet aircraft in 1949; equipped with first-generation F-89B Scorpions in 1951. 
The Scorpion was difficult to fly, costly to maintain, and was subject to mishaps. Was re-equipped with the F-94C Starfire in 1953 which it flew throughout the balance of the 1950s, acquiring newer F-94Ds in 1956 and the F-94J in 1957.
In 1960 received the new McDonnell F-101B Voodoo supersonic interceptor, and the F-101F operational and conversion trainer. The two-seat trainer version was equipped with dual controls, but carried the same armament as the F-101B and were fully combat-capable. 
On 22 October 1962, before President Kennedy told the nation that missiles were in place in Cuba, the squadron dispersed a portion of its force, equipped with nuclear tipped missiles to Kingsley Field at the start of the Cuban Missile Crisis. These planes returned to Hamilton after the crisis.
In 1966, F-101s were featured in the film The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming. The F-101Bs were transferred to the Air National Guard and 1968 and replaced by F-106 Delta Darts. 
Moved to Castle AFB, California in 1973 as part of the shutdown of Hamilton AFB, Inactivated in 1981 as the interceptor mission was being transferred to the Air National Guard.
Tactical Air Command.
In July 1981 the squadron was redesignated the 84th Fighter Interceptor Training Squadron and received a fleet of T-33s to train in, specializing in electronic counter-countermeasures training. It participated in live flying exercises as targets for various air divisions and for the F-15 Eagles of the 49th Tactical Fighter Wing. The squadron also flew target missions for the weapons controller training program until early 1987 when it was inactivated.
Modern era.
In April 1990 the squadron was resurrected to meet the increased demand for pilots. The 84th was designated a Flying Training Squadron and joined the 85th Flying Training Squadron in training pilots in the T-37 Tweet at Laughlin Air Force Base. Again yielding to changes in pilot production the squadron was inactivated in October 1992. In 1998 pilot production increased again and the 84 FTS was reactivated on 1 October 1998.

Terence Mitford

Terence Bruce Mitford FBA FSA (sometimes known as Terence Bruce-Mitford) (11 May 1905 – 8 November 1978) was a Scottish archaeologist and classicist. He spent his whole career at the University of St Andrews, and had a special interest in the history and archaeology of Cyprus and southern Turkey, making many expeditions to these areas. His academic life was interrupted by the Second World War, during which he served with the Special Air Service and Special Boat Service.
Biography.
Mitford was born in Yokohama, Japan. His father was C. E. Bruce Mitford, and Mitford's name was sometimes given as "Bruce-Mitford". Mitford was educated at Dulwich College before reading Literae Humaniores at Jesus College, Oxford – his rugby-playing interfered with his studies, and he did not obtain as high a class of degree as hoped. He spent his entire career at the University of St Andrews, teaching Latin text and prose composition, but his main interest was archaeology, in which he involved residents of St Andrews as well as students. He spent time in the 1930s on excavations in Cyprus – his main archaeological interest throughout his career was the exploration of the inscriptions on Cyprus. His obituary, in "The Times", said that Mitford "contributed more than anyone has ever done to our knowledge of the mass of documentation which exists in the Cypriot dialect and the Cypriot syllabic script." He also worked on the history of Cyprus, looking at the island in Ptolemaic and early Roman times.
Shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War, he was commissioned into the Dorset Regiment as a second lieutenant on 15 October 1939. He later fought in the Aegean as a member of the Special Air Service. He was parachuted into Crete and fought with guerrilla forces against the occupying German army. He then served in the Special Boat Service and was involved in the capture of Patmos and the Allied invasion of Sicily. For his war service he was awarded the Greek decoration of Knight of the Royal Order of King George I with Swords. After the war, he returned to St Andrews (where he was attached to the Officer Training Corps) and resumed his archaeological explorations in Cyprus. He was promoted to major on 1 April 1948, and nominally transferred to the Intelligence Corps. In his later career, he also looked at the archaeology and epigraphy of southern Turkey, making many expeditions there. He found many previously unknown inscriptions, assisting the work of the Austrian Academy of Sciences's Committee for the Archaeological Exploration of Asia Minor. His explorations were aided by his physical stamina, his resilience and his fluency in Greek and Turkish.
Mitford was appointed Reader in Classical Archaeology and retired as Honorary Emeritus Professor in 1973, the year that he was awarded a DLitt by the University of Oxford; he was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in the following year. He was elected as a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1940, and was also a corresponding member of the German Archaeological Institute and a Fellow of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. In retirement, he continued his hobby of studying birds, compiling data on Scandinavian migration and becoming an advisor to the government of Jordan on bird conservation. He died on 8 November 1978, aged 73.

<doc id="20167416" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20167416" title="Bombardment of Papeete">
Bombardment of Papeete

The Bombardment of Papeete occurred in French Polynesia when German warships attacked on 22 September 1914, during World War I. The German armoured cruisers and entered the port of Papeete on the island of Tahiti and sank the French gunboat and freighter "Walkure" before bombarding the town's fortifications. French shore batteries and a gunboat resisted the German intrusion, but were greatly outgunned. The main German objective was to seize the coal piles stored on the island, but these were destroyed by the French at the start of the action.
The German vessels were largely undamaged but the French lost their gunboat. Several of Papeete's buildings were destroyed and the town's economy was severely disrupted. The main strategic consequence of the engagement was the disclosure of the cruisers' positions to the British Admiralty, which led to the Battle of Coronel where the entire German East Asia Squadron defeated a Royal Navy squadron. The depletion of "Scharnhorst"s and "Gneisenau"s ammunition at Papeete also contributed to their subsequent destruction at the Battle of the Falklands.
Background.
Word of war reached Admiral Maximilian von Spee—of the German East Asia Squadron—while at Ponape (17 July – 6 August). He concentrated the majority of his squadron at Pagan Island in the nearby Mariana Islands, and then steamed off into the Pacific with the "Scharnhorst"-class armored cruisers and , the "Königsberg"-class light cruiser , the auxiliary cruiser SMS "Titania", and several colliers at his disposal. "Nürnberg" and "Titania" were sent to gather intelligence at Hawaii and raid the cable station at Fanning Island. Von Spee then learned that Australian and New Zealand forces had captured German Samoa, and he sailed off in his flagship "Scharnhorst"—along with her sister ship "Gneisenau"—to engage what Allied forces they could find there. Failing to catch the Samoa Expeditionary Force at Apia and having seen no action at all since leaving Pagan Island, the men of Admiral von Spee's armored cruisers were eager to meet the enemy in battle.
Von Spee decided to raid Papeete in Tahiti on his way to rendezvous with the rest of his squadron at Easter Island. The French held over of high-quality Cardiff coal at the port, and von Spee hoped to seize the coal piles to replenish his squadron's supply. Additionally, von Spee aimed at destroying what allied shipping he could find in the harbour, and thought the raid might help raise his men's morale. Von Spee intended to coal at Suwarrow Atoll before sailing to Papeete, but was prevented by foul weather. Instead, von Spee decided to take "Scharnhorst" and "Gneisenau" and attempt to resupply at Bora Bora while "Nürnberg" and "Titania" were dispatched to Nukuhiva to guard the fleet's colliers. The German admiral intended to keep his vessels' identities secret by disguising them as French ships, flying French flags, and only allowing French- and English-speaking members of his crew contact with the Frenchmen present there. Von Spee managed to replenish his food stores using gold seized by "Titania" and "Nürnberg" during their raid of Fanning, and was able to discover the strength of the French military in the region as well as the exact size and positions of the coal piles at Papeete.
The French had no heavy defenses at Papeete but had been warned that von Spee's squadron might raid Tahiti and that a German squadron had been sighted off Samoa. Although Papeete was the capital of the French Settlements in Oceania, by 1914 it had become a colonial backwater, lacking a wireless station and having a garrison of only 25 colonial infantry and 20 gendarmes. In order to bolster the town's defenses, Lieutenant Maxime Destremau—commander of the old wooden gunboat and the ranking officer at Papeete—had his ship's stern gun and all of her and guns removed from his vessel and placed ashore to be used in place of Papeete's antiquated land batteries. Several Ford trucks were turned into impromptu armored cars by mounting them with "Zélée"s 37-mm guns and 160 sailors and marines drilled in preparation to repel any German attempt at landing. "Zélée" retained only her 100-mm bow gun and 10 men under the ship's second in command. In addition to the gunboat and harbor fortifications, the French also had at Papeete the unarmed German freighter "Walkure", which had been captured by "Zélée" at the start of the war. Despite the French preparations, the two German cruisers were more than a match for the forces Destremau commanded at Papeete. Both "Scharnhorst" and "Gneisenau" heavily outgunned "Zélée", each being armed with eight guns, six guns, eighteen guns, and four torpedo tubes. Von Spee's forces also outnumbered the French with over 1,500 sailors aboard their vessels, more than enough to form a landing party and overwhelm the forces Destremau had to oppose them.
Battle.
At 07:00 on 22 September 1914, the French sighted two unidentified cruisers approaching the harbor of Papeete. The alarm was raised, the harbor's signal beacons destroyed, and three warning shots were fired by the French batteries to signal the approaching cruisers that they must identify themselves. The cruisers replied with a shot of their own and raised the German colors, signaling the town to surrender. The French refused the German demands, and von Spee's vessels began to shell the shore batteries and town from a distance of . The land batteries and the gunboat in the harbor returned fire, but scored no hits on the armored cruisers. Having difficulty in discovering the exact position of the French batteries, the German cruisers soon turned their attention to the French shipping in the harbor.
The French commander—Destremau—had ordered the coal piles burned at the start of the action and now smoke began billowing over the town. "Zélée" and "Walkure" were sighted and fired upon by the Germans. The French had begun to scuttle their vessels when the action had begun, but both were still afloat when "Scharnhorst" and "Gneisenau" began firing upon them and finished the two ships off. By now, most of the Papeete's inhabitants had fled and the town had caught fire from the German shelling, with two blocks of Papeete set alight. With the coal piles destroyed and the threat of mines in the harbor, von Spee saw no meaningful purpose in making a landing. Accordingly, the German admiral withdrew his ships from Papeete's harbor by 11:00. After leaving Papeete, the ships steamed out towards Nuku Hiva to meet "Nürnberg", "Titania", and colliers waiting there.
Aftermath.
By the time von Spee withdrew his ships, large portions of the town had been destroyed. Two entire blocks of Papeete had burnt to the ground before the fires were finally put out. A copra store, a market, and several other buildings and residences were among those destroyed by the shellfire and resulting inferno. While the majority of Papeete's civilians fled to the interior of the island as soon as the fighting began, a Japanese civilian and a Polynesian boy were both killed by German shellfire. Although the two French vessels in the harbor had been sunk, there were no military casualties on either side and the German vessels took no damage. Overall, the bombardment was estimated in 1915 to have caused over 2 million francs' worth of property damage, some of which was recouped through the seizure of a German store on the island. In addition to the seizure of their property, several local Germans were interned and forced to repair the damage von Spee's squadron had caused. Perhaps the most lasting effect of the bombardment on the French was the dramatic fall of copra prices in the region, as local suppliers had previously sold a majority of their produce to German merchants in the area who were now interned. Further havoc and distress spread throughout the island 18 days after von Spee's squadron had left, when rumors started to spread that a second German bombardment was about to begin.
After withdrawing, "Scharnhorst" and "Gneisenau" rendezvoused with "Nürnberg" and "Titania" at Nuku Hiva, where they resupplied and their crews took shore leave before moving on to meet the rest of the squadron at Easter Island. Although the Germans had destroyed the shipping at Papeete and wreaked havoc in the town, they had been denied their primary objective of seizing the French coal piles and replenishing their own stocks. Von Spee's raid allowed the British Admiralty to receive word on his position and heading, allowing them to inform Rear Admiral Christopher Cradock of the German intentions thus leading to the Battle of Coronel. Another effect was the reduction of ammunition available to the two German cruisers. The hundreds of shells fired by von Spee's ships at Papeete were irreplaceable. The depletion of ammunition as a result of the action at Papeete contributed to the German East Asia Squadron's failure to adequately defend itself at the Battle of the Falkland Islands against British battlecruisers. Lieutenant Destremau was chastised by his misinformed superior officer for his actions during the defense of Papeete and for the loss of the gunboat "Zélée". He was summoned back to Toulon under arrest to be court-martialled, but died of illness in 1915 before the trial. In 1918, Destremau was finally recognized for his actions at Papeete and was posthumously awarded the "Légion d'honneur".

Pyongan dialect

The Pyongan dialect (평안도 사투리), alternatively Northwestern Korean (서북 방언, 西北方言), is the Korean dialect of the northwestern Korean peninsula and neighboring parts of China. It has influenced the standard language of North Korea, but is not the basis of it, which remains Seoul dialect.
Pronunciation.
Jamo.
In the Pyongan dialect an eight vowel system is used (이·에·애·으·어·아·우·오). The sound of 어 is much closer to that of 오 compared to other dialects. There are various features that differentiate the sound of words from southwestern and midland dialects. 위, 왜, 워 and 와 are closer to an original sound of 야, 여, 요 and 유. 
Palatalization.
The ㄷ (d) consonant, in addition to the first syllable of ㄱ (g) and ㅎ (h) are not palatalized in the Pyongan dialect (e.g. 뎡거댱, 정거장). Sino-Korean words beginning with ㄴ (n) in southern dialects are pronounced as ㄹ (r), as in the cases of 뉴행 and 노동.
Conjugation.
Stems of the ㄷ, ㅂ, ㅅ irregulars use both forms, such as in the case of 듣다·드드니, 들으니 (listening, to hear). 
Words.
Vocabulary.
Various words used in the Pyongan dialect differ to that of other Korean dialects, such as 간나 (sissy), 클마니 (father) and 클마니 (grandmother). The etymology of words such as "우틔" (衣) arises from the Manchu language.

Albert Henry Hanson (20 April 1913 – 27 April 1971) was the first Professor of Politics at the University of Leeds. 
Life.
Hanson was born in Swindon and educated at Swindon Grammar School and Jesus College, Oxford, obtaining a first-class BA in Modern History in 1934. Whilst at university, he joined the Communist Party of Great Britain, remaining a member until 1953 when he concluded that membership conflicted with his academic independence. 
After leaving Oxford and spending some years as a teacher, Hanson joined the army in 1941, serving in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps and the Royal Artillery. He reached the rank of Major and finished his service as Chief Instructor at the Army School of Education in Maynyo, Burma. 
After two years at the Coopers Hill Emergency Training College, in 1948 he was appointed a Lecturer in Public Administration at the University of Leeds. It was largely through his efforts that politics and public administration became established topics of study at the university. He was promoted to Reader in 1956 and then became Leeds University's first Professor of Politics in 1963, a post he was to hold until his death in 1971. 
Hanson's particular interests were public administration and nationalized industries. He became known for his work in these fields in developing countries, particularly India and in Africa, leading to many invitations to teach and lecture abroad. His work in this field included "Public Enterprise and Economic Development" and "The Process of Planning in India". Other areas of study included parliamentary reform and the teaching of political science in universities in Britain.

Mallows Bay is a small bay on the Maryland side of the Potomac River in Charles County, Maryland, and located at . The bay is the location of what is regarded as the "largest shipwreck fleet in the Western Hemisphere" and is described as a "ship graveyard."
Charles County operates Mallows Bay Park (1440 Wilson Landing Road in Nanjemoy, Maryland). This small park contains the graves of more than 230 ships sunk in the river. Almost ninety were poorly constructed steamships built during World War I; in 1925 they were burned and scuttled in the bay. Bethlehem Steel then built a salvage basin during World War II to recover metal from the abandoned ships. The ships form a reef that hosts an array of wildlife. A 0.8-mile trail loops around Mallows Bay Park and the salvage basin. 
In 2010, a boat ramp and pier for recreational use was constructed to provide access to the Potomac River at Mallows Bay. It is popular to canoe or kayak among the ship ruins.

Korean language in China

Chinese Korean language (中國朝鮮말 / 중국조선말) refers to the variety of the Korean language spoken by Ethnic Koreans in China, primarily located in Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning.
All five dialects of Korean except for the Jeju dialect are spoken by members of the Korean diaspora who settled in China before 1949. The educational standard is North Korean. 
Chinese Korean vocabulary is significantly similar to the North Korean standard, as is orthography; a major exception of orthography is that the spelling of some Chinese cities is different (e.g. 북경 vs 베이징); exceptions of vocabulary are all related to China.
Background.
Language standardisation.
Due to the People's Republic of China having maintained favourable relations with North Korea, and also the proximity of the two nations, the standardised dialect of Korean amongst Chinese-Koreans is similar to that of North Korea.
Characteristics.
Grammar.
The copula "-ᆸ니까/-습니까" in Standard Korean is rendered as "-ᆷ둥/-슴둥" in dialects of Korean spoken in Northeastern Jilin, and "-ᆷ니꺼/-심니꺼" in dialects spoken in Southwestern Heilongjiang.
At the same time, there are grammatical influences from Standard Chinese, for example:
Vocabulary.
Vocabulary is another differentiating factor in comparison with other varieties of Korean, with usage of words such as 개구리 and 개구락지 (frog). As a result of Chinese influence, there are many words that arise from Modern Standard Chinese.
Some words arise from the "eum" pronunciation of hanja, for example 공인 (工人, worker) and 판공실 (辦公室, office).
The vocabulary utilises many borrowings from Standard Chinese, for example, 뗀노 (from 电脑 "diànnăo", computer) and 쌍발하다 (from 上班儿 "shàngbānr" + 하다, "to go to work").

Minnesota Veterans Home

The Minnesota Soldiers' Home, later known as the Minnesota Veterans Home in Minneapolis, is an old soldiers' home near Minnehaha Falls in Minneapolis, Minnesota. After the American Civil War and the devastation that it caused, there was sentiment that the United States should provide care for its veterans. The Minnesota Legislature authorized the establishment of the Soldiers' Home in 1887, as a "reward to the brave and deserving". Construction began the following year, in 1888. By 1911, the home had five men's cottages and one women's cottage, along with other buildings such as an infirmary, a dining hall, and so on. The home was originally envisioned as a place of rest and as a monument in appreciation of veterans' contributions. As such, it was beautifully landscaped, and medical care was not provided until after World War I. Even then, medical care was a secondary goal.
In the 1960s, the Soldiers' Home Board of Trustees recognized that the Home should provide health care as a primary goal. This shift was gradual. In 1968, the home was licensed for 56 nursing care beds and 375 boarding care beds, which were primarily non-medical care. The home was operated in a quasi-military fashion at the time. As priorities shifted, medical care became more of a focus. A new nursing care facility was built on the Minneapolis campus in 1972, with another following in 1980. In 1978, the old state hospital in Hastings was converted into a domiciliary residence for veterans. This resulted in a total of 250 nursing care beds in Minneapolis, 250 domiciliary beds in Minneapolis, and 200 domiciliary beds in Hastings.
In 1988, the Legislature reorganized the Veterans Homes, separating them from the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Veterans Homes Board of Directors was established to turn the homes into high quality health care facilities while also considering the special needs of the veteran population. The Board has memberships from both the health care field and veterans' organizations. There are now five Veterans Homes in Minnesota. The Minneapolis campus has 346 skilled nursing care beds and 77 domiciliary beds, and the Hastings campus has 200 domiciliary care beds. A home in Silver Bay has 89 skilled nursing care beds, a home in Luverne has 85 skilled nursing care beds, and a home in Fergus Falls has 85 skilled nursing care beds.
The veterans' community, from the days of the Grand Army of the Republic and the United Spanish War Veterans to the present, has been active in supporting the Minnesota Veterans Homes. They promote the homes and provide awareness of the services provided by the Veterans Homes. They also play a role in advocacy by promoting the causes of veterans to make sure their needs are met. The community has also monitored the homes to ensure that residents are receiving quality care. Finally, the veterans' community has provided very generous donations of money and equipment to the Homes. These donations have improved the quality of life for the residents.

Holy Cross Church (New York City)

Holy Cross Church is a Roman Catholic church located at 329 West 42nd Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City, near Times Square and across the street from the Port Authority Bus Terminal. 
The Holy Cross Parish was established in 1852 and a chapel erected, which the congregation quickly outgrew. In 1854, a new building was constructed and dedicated, but lightning struck this second structure in 1867, and the ensuing fire severely damaged it. The current church was constructed to a design by Henry Engelbert on the site of the damaged building and completed in 1870. It is notable as the oldest building on 42nd Street. The Holy Cross School, located behind the church at 332 West 43rd Street, was built in 1887 to a design by Lawrence J. O'Connor. 
Since 1900, Holy Cross Church has worked with politicians, police and community groups to combat poverty, crime and drugs in the neighborhood. The parish is especially associated with the popular ministry of the Reverend Francis P. Duffy.
Architecture.
The exterior of Holy Cross Church shows a red brick facade with flanking twin towers in an Italianate Gothic form. Inside, the church reveals an eclectic mixture of Georgian classical, Romanesque and Byzantine forms. The main dimensions are 100 feet from front to back and 82 feet from side to side, where the configuration completes the suggestion of a cross. A dome, surmounted by a cross, rises above the intersection of nave and transept. From curb level to the top of the cross is a distance of 148 feet.
The nine stained-glass windows in the chancel were made by Mayer & Company of Munich. Louis Comfort Tiffany designed the mosaics below the dome and in the sanctuary. Tiffany also designed the stained glass of the clerestory windows and wheel windows of the transepts.
The red brick and terra-cotta school building facade was designed in the Romanesque Revival style.
Services.
Mass is celebrated in both English- and Spanish-language services. Holy Cross Church operates Crossroads Food Pantry, a food kitchen serving the poor and hungry. It also conducts an evangelical program named LAMP Missionary for the assistance of local residents and passers-by who wish to receive religious counseling.
Music.
Choral music and congregational singing are present in both Spanish- and English-language services. Music is led from either a grand piano located near the altar or from an organ in the gallery. The church houses an Aeolian-Skinner organ, which is located in the rear gallery in the choir loft. Installed in 1933 and completed in 1941 with the addition of a set of chimes, it replaced an organ built in 1882 by J.H. & C.S. Odell. The earliest organ, with one manual and two octaves, which had been built by Hall and Labagh in 1854, was destroyed in the fire of 1867.
Father Duffy.
Holy Cross Church is sometimes known informally as "Father Duffy's Church", after the Reverend Francis P. Duffy. Duffy served as Chaplain of the "Fighting Irish" 69th New York Regiment during World War I, and was decorated for his activities. After the war, in 1921, Duffy was appointed Rector of Holy Cross. Later elevated to Pastor, Father Duffy served the church until his death in 1932. That year he instituted the Printers' Mass on Sunday mornings at 2:30 A.M. for workers at the "New York Times", "Herald Tribune", "Daily News" and "Daily Mirror" whose shifts required late hours. Father Duffy is commemorated by a bronze statue located on West 46th Street between Seventh Avenue and Broadway, at Times Square's northern end, which is officially named Duffy Square.

Indianapolis 500 traditions

Due to the longevity of the Indianapolis 500, numerous traditions surrounding the race have developed over the years. Traditions include procedures for the running of the race, scheduling, and pre-race and post-race festivities. For many fans, these traditions are an important aspect of the race, and they have often reacted quite negatively when the traditions are changed or broken.
As part of the Memorial Day holiday weekend, the pre-race ceremonies of the Indianapolis 500 feature several patriotic songs. The most noteworthy and most popular traditions are the annual singing of "Back Home Again in Indiana," and the victory lane bottle of milk.
Month of May.
Memorial Day.
The race has always been scheduled in conjunction with Memorial Day. Through 1970, the race was held on Memorial Day proper (May 30), regardless of the day of the week, unless it fell on Sunday. In those cases it was scheduled for Monday May 31. After the Uniform Monday Holiday Act took effect in 1971, the race was scheduled for Memorial Day weekend instead.
Armed Forces Day also falls during the month of May, and usually coincides with one of the weekends of time trials. Since 1978 at the Speedway, that weekend is often filled with activities honoring the U.S. military, including an oath of enlistment ceremony.
Concerts.
Since 1998, a concert featuring a top act(s) have been held the weekend of the race. Numerous other local band, indie bands, garage bands, and smaller musical acts perform at other times during the month on days featuring track activity. From 1998-2013 the headlining concert was held on Carb Day. Starting in 2014, the headlining concert will be held on Legends Day. The performers have been as follows:
Last Row Party.
On the Friday before the race, the "Last Row Party" has been held for charity from 1972-2012. It is organized by the Indianapolis Press Club Foundation. It serves as a roast for the final three qualifiers in the 500, who will be starting on the eleventh and final row. Due to the complex qualifying procedure for the race, these three drivers are usually, but not always, the slowest three cars in the field. Like Mr. Irrelevant, many of these drivers are often obscure, but nine former or eventual race winners have participated in the honor at some time in their career. The three drivers are presented with a special jacket, and checks for 31¢, 32¢, and 33¢, respectively. The emcee for the event is usually a media figure, and past hosts include Bob Jenkins, Robin Miller, Jack Arute, and Laura Steele. The 2013 event was not held, but plans are to resume it in the future.
Recent honorees include:
Public Drivers Meeting / Legends Day.
The day before the race, a ceremonial drivers meeting is held at the track, which is open to the public, and is popularly attended. This tradition dates back many decades. During the meeting, the 33 starting drivers are presented with their starter's ring and various awards and trophies are handed out (such as trophies from the previous year's race, qualifying awards, lifetime achievement awards, etc.) All 33 drivers are normally present (barring unforeseen scheduling conflicts - such as participating in another race; another team member representing that driver will participate in awards) often seated in their ceremonial eleven rows of three, and numerous other celebrities and special guests may be honored or give remarks. Rules clarifications, instructions for the race, and other pertinent information is also discussed in the open forum.
This drivers meeting is separate from the official drivers meeting, organized by race stewards. That meeting, held the morning of the race, is strictly closed to the public and the media.
Starting in 1998, the days leading up to the race have included ceremonies and activities honoring former drivers. In some years, each day during the week would have a featured Indy legend, and might feature the driver taking ceremonial laps around the track in one of his winning race cars, or in a pace car. Other years utilized Opening Day as an opportunity to honor Indy legends. In addition, the day before the race was expanded to include an autograph session featuring the 33 starting drivers, former drivers, Q&A sessions, car displays, a "fanfest" midway, a memorabilia show, and other festivities. Starting 2011, the events of the day before the race have been officially themed "Legends Day," and features a designated honoree.
Legends Day Honorees
500 Festival.
The 500 Festival is a non-profit organization founded in 1957 to organize various civic events in the city of Indianapolis leading up to the race. The two largest events are the OneAmerica 500 Festival Mini-Marathon in early May, and the 500 Festival Parade the day before the race. Other events include "Community Day" at the track and the annual Snake Pit Ball, a black tie socialite gathering downtown.
In many years, the parade grand marshal has been a celebrity with ties to the Indianapolis area, particularly Indianapolis-area sports figures. The grand marshals for the annual parade have been as follows:
Track lore.
The atmosphere at the track during the month of May and on race day has long been a source of traditions.
The Snake Pit.
The infield of the track in the vicinity of turn one was known as the "Snake Pit." Long known for rowdiness, heavy alcohol consumption, bikers, streaking, flashing, and an overall Woodstock/Mardi Gras-esque atmosphere, the Snake Pit was a popular location for college-age fans to spend time at the track, many of whom had little or no interest in the actual racing activities. Like the infield at the Kentucky Derby, the Snake Pit was often considered a rite of spring, and an excuse to party with abandon. Arrests for public intoxication, disorderly conduct, fights, and drug possession were frequent and common.
In periods of rain, the area usually became overwhelmed with mud, and mud wrestling was commonly observed. Bonfires and burned cars were also noted.
In 1981, track management erected bleachers in the turn one infield in an effort to curtail the revelry. In addition, improvements that included the new Gasoline Alley, a place for competitors to park motor homes row, along with additional support buildings, eventually scaled back the size of the area. As a result, for the better part of the 1980s, the patrons migrated to the infield of turn four, and the somewhat less-intense Snake Pit II emerged. By the 1990s, the intensity of the rowdiness had dropped drastically, due largely in part by third-generation management at the Speedway (Tony George) and beefed up law enforcement. The Snake Pit eventually became more of a festive party zone.
The turn four infield was razed in 1999 to make room for the infield road course. The race day party scene migrated to its current location, the turn three infield. Later, the original turn one location was also razed to make room for the motorcycle infield road course. The series of turns is sometimes referred to as the "Snake Pit" section. In 2010, the turn three infield was officially named the New Snake Pit, and began to be embraced and officially marketed by management. On race day, a concert stage is erected, and popular music acts and DJ's perform to entertain the infield crowd in a controlled and festive environment.
Coke Lot.
Similar to the aforementioned "Snake Pit," the Coke Lot which is located outside the track, is the most noteworthy and popular camping location on the grounds of the Speedway. Officially designated Lot 1C, it has been nicknamed the "Coke Lot" for decades due to the presence of a Coca-Cola bottling plant located adjacent to property.
The lot is an open field located just to the northwest of the track, outside of turn 4 of the oval, off of Georgetown Road. Long known for intense revelry and all-night partying (particularly on the night before the race), the Coke Lot is a festive area and party scene for RVs and campers, as well as tent campers. The lot typically opens a few days before the race and allows fans to stay through the entire race weekend.
While the Coke Lot is the most notorious camping area, several other camping lots are also situated around the vicinity of the Speedway, some focusing on family-friendly environments, while others are considered premium lot for high-end RV'ers.
In years past, another camping area called the "North 40" (named due to its size of approximately 40 acres) was another scene of intense overnight revelry. Located directly north of the track off of 30th Street, it was curtailed and is seldom used for camping any longer. Currently it is typically only utilized for daytime car parking.
Food.
A traditional food of choice at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway is the pork tenderloin sandwich. The sandwich is a well-known midwestern creation, and is sold at the track concessions.
Beer (largely domestic) is consumed in considerable amounts at the track. Unlike most sports stadiums and arenas, at Indianapolis (and most speedways), spectators are allowed to bring their own alcoholic beverages into the track for consumption. Beer is also sold at concessions. Glass bottles, however, are strictly prohibited at the track. Broken glass is considered an extreme hazard to the race cars (cut tires) on the track.
Peanuts are considered bad luck. An ambiguous, long-standing superstition against eating peanuts at the race track has dominated Indianapolis dating back to at least the 1940s. Legend says, though unconfirmed, that a crashed car was found with peanut shells in the cockpit. As of 2009, however, peanuts are sold at trackside concessions, and the myth has lost a lot of its following.
In the 1960s-1975, Mary Catherine "Mom" Unser (mother of Jerry, Bobby, and Al) was a well-known fixture in the garage area who was famous for her spicy chili. Each year, she would treat the participants to a cook-out in the garage area.
Curse of the Smiths.
Among the over 730 drivers who have participated in the Indy 500, none have had the last name Smith, the most common surname in the United States. Several Smiths have attempted to make the race, the last being Mark Smith who failed to qualify in 1993 and 1994. By contrast there have been seven different drivers with the last name Jones, and four with the last name Johnson.
Only two drivers with the surname Smith have ever competed at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, albeit in different events. Regan Smith has driven in the Brickyard 400 since 2008, and made a 2013 start in the Indiana 250. Motorcyclist Bradley Smith has competed in the Red Bull Indianapolis GP 125 cc division. Neither driver has won the events. Regan has though come in 3rd in the 2011 400. 
A German language translation of Smith has participated, with Sam Schmidt making three starts.
Pre race ceremonies.
National anthem.
"The Star-Spangled Banner" has been performed before the start of the Indy 500 in most years. Up through the 1970s and early 1980s, the song was typically played by the Purdue All-American Marching Band without a vocalist. However, in some rare occasions, a vocalist was used. In 1976, Tom Sullivan and Up with People were invited to sing, as a gesture to the U.S. Bicentennial.
By the mid-1980s, the Speedway began inviting notable artists to perform the national anthem. In nearly all cases, they would be backed by the Purdue Band. In 1983, James A. Hubert flubbed the lyrics. He omitted the line ""O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming?"" and instead repeated the second line ""What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming"", stumbling on the word "twilight" the second time around.
In 2001, Steven Tyler of Aerosmith caused a controversy after he changed the lyrics of the song. Recent performers include:
Other songs.
In most years since 1991, the song "America the Beautiful" or "God Bless America" has also been performed by Florence Henderson. Henderson, a native Hoosier, is a friend of the Hulman-George family. Her performance, often not televised, immediately precedes the national anthem. The performance was introduced for the race's 75th anniversary running in 1991, in part due to Operation Desert Storm. Henderson switched to the national anthem for 1993–1997, then returned to the special pre-performance in 1999. In 2003, the song switched to "God Bless America," which became more popular in the post-9/11 era.
Invocation.
Starting in 1974, the Indy 500 was moved to the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend. As a gesture, the Speedway added an invocation to the pre-race ceremonies. In most years, the Speedway has invited the Archbishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Indianapolis. In selected years, others have been invited including nationally famous clergymen Oral Roberts and Billy Graham.
Archbishop Edward T. O'Meara participated several times until his death in early 1992. Archbishop Daniel M. Buechlein took over as the traditional clergy in 1993. Buechlein customarily ended his invocation with the word "Godspeed" in the languages of all of the participating drivers. In 2011, Buechlein fell ill, and resigned from the archdiocese. In 2011-2012, Auxiliary bishop Christopher J. Coyne took his place. Archbishop Joe Tobin is expected to deliver the invocation most years beginning in 2013.
Taps.
In remembrance of Memorial Day, "Taps" is played, and a U.S. military aircraft does a fly-by. In some years, multiple aircraft participate, executing the missing man formation. Traditionally, a member of the public address announcing team has recited a preamble honoring those who have died in combat, and those who have perished in automobile racing. Jim Philippe recited the preamble until he died in 2003. Dave Calabro said it in 2006, and Jerry Baker reprised it in 2012. Since 2000, a notable military or government official has also offered a tribute or remarks.
The traditional preamble goes as follows:
In the 1960s and 1970s, "Taps" was typically rendered by a combined U.S. Armed Forces Color Guard. Then from the 1980s through 2005, it was usually played by the Purdue Band.
Rendering of "Taps"
Remarks 
Fly-bys
Back Home Again in Indiana.
The most traditional performance is the singing of "Back Home Again in Indiana" by Jim Nabors, accompanied by the Purdue Marching Band. Nabors has performed the song in most years since 1972. During the line ""...the new mown hay..."" thousands of multicolored balloons are released from an infield tent. This tradition has accompanied the race since 1946. The song has long been the last event in the order of the day, immediately proceeding the command to start engines.
The song, which was first published in 1917, is reported to have been first played at the race in 1919. A trackside brass band played the song as Indiana-born Howdy Wilcox was finishing the final laps to victory.
In 1997, the race was rained out on Sunday, and the start was rescheduled for Monday. Nabors (as well as the Purdue band), had left the grounds by Monday morning. Rather than find a last-minute replacement, Nabors suggested that the Speedway utilize a recording of one of his previous performances. The Speedway replayed his 1993 rendition, and it was well received by the fans. Two days before the 2007 race, Nabors canceled his appearance due to an illness. On race morning, Nabors recorded a special video greeting to the fans from his Hawaii home, which was streamed over the internet. Fans were invited to sing along with the Purdue band, and a "get well soon" message was displayed for Nabors. In 2008, Nabors made a well-received return, and received a standing ovation at the public driver meeting.
Nabors again missed the race in 2012 due to an illness. This time, the Speedway sent a television crew to his home in Maui, and recorded a performance that was played on the video boards on race morning.
Starting command.
The call for the engines to start is made by stating "Gentlemen, start your engines!" When female drivers are competing, the call has been amended to "Lady and Gentlemen..." or "Ladies and Gentlemen..."
The exact origin of the phrase is unclear, and there have been several conflicting accounts of who was the first to recite it, and what the exact wording of it was. Prior to WWII, it was commonplace for an aerial bomb to signal the start of the engines. Seth Kline was the official starter of the "500" from 1925-1926 & 1934-1953. Kline is thought to have made an informal "Gentlemen, start your motors!" command as early as 1948 to accompany the bomb. The first documented case was in 1950, and that was recited by prolific public address announcer John Francis "Irish" Horan. Kline was again reported as saying it in 1951, (though some report it was Horan) Either Kline or Horan said it again in 1952. It was around that time the command was changed from ""...motors!"" to ""...engines!"" The participants and officials alike, preferred the more technical term "engines" to describe their machines. Sid Collins stated that chief steward Harlan Fengler explained to him "there are no motors in the race, just engines."
Wilbur Shaw, president of the Speedway from 1946–1954, was once believed to be the person who coined the phrase, and it was erroneously claimed in his autobiography that he recited it in all the post-WWII years until his death. Speedway historian Donald Davidson, however, believes Shaw only recited it twice, in 1953 and 1954. 
After Shaw's death, Tony Hulman started reciting the command, and made it popular and famous. The normally soft-spoken and shy Hulman had a proud and vociferous version of the command annually. After Hulman's death in 1977, his widow Mary F. Hulman or his daughter, Mari Hulman George has done the honor.
In 1977, Janet Guthrie became the first female driver to qualify for the Indy 500. Controversy surrounded the command, because the Speedway management did not want to alter the traditional phrase. During the week before the race, the management announced that they would not change the wording of the command. Looking for an excuse, they insisted that the cars were actually started by male crew members with an electric hand-held starter from behind the car. Guthrie and her crew were quite displeased by the stubbornness of the Speedway management, considering her unprecedented accomplishment. The crew reacted by assigning Kay Bignotti (wife of George Bignotti) as the crew member to operate the inertial starter at the back of Guthrie's car. The Speedway's argument fell apart, and they decided upon a special amended command for that year. They did not announce beforehand what the special command would be, and Hulman's highly anticipated phrase was the following:
In 1978-1979, when Guthrie again qualified for the race, it was simply amended to "Lady and..." In 1992, Lyn St. James became the second female to qualify for the race. She publicly requested, albeit not contentiously, that the command be changed to "Drivers, start your engines." The request was dismissed, and the command used was the now customary "Lady and..." variation.
For many years, the traditional location for giving the command was at the pace car in the front of the starting grid. Public address announcer Jim Philippe normally introduced the command, describing it as the "traditional command" or the "famous four words." Phillippe's final "500" was 2003. Likewise, for many years through 1989, Luke Walton traditionally introduced the command on the radio network broadcast. Since 2004, Dave Calabro introduces the command normally by calling it the "most famous words in motorsports." 
In most cases, Hulman would give the command, then ride in the pace car during the pace laps. Mary F. Hulman would give the command near the pace car, but rarely rode in the pace car due to her age and declining health. Eventually, the location was moved to near the start/finish line, and in 2001, it was moved to the new Victory Podium stage adjacent to the Pagoda. In 2011, however, Mari George moved back to the front of the starting grid to give the command, and she rode in the pace car with A. J. Foyt.
Starting command
On occasions when an accident or rain has halted the race, a second command has typically been given. Years include: 1967, 1973, 1982, 1986, 1997, 2004, 2007. The amended command, "gentlemen, re-start your engines," has usually been used. In 1986, this restart command was given by Tony George. In 1997, it was given by Mari Hulman George. In 1982 and 2004 the command was given by public address announcer Tom Carnegie.
Over the years, the starting command has been adopted to start all sorts of auto racing in the United States, including but not limited to NASCAR. However, in many venues outside of Indy, the phrase "Drivers, start your engines" appears to be the preferred version.
Honorary starter.
A recently-added tradition is the use of an honorary starter. A special guest has been invited in recent years to wave the green flag to start the race. 
Celebrity guests.
Since the early years of the race, celebrities from all walks of fame have been invited to the race, some have returned for many years or even decades. Television and movie stars, sports figures, and politicians are among the many dignitaries invited. During the pre-race, a parade of stars is conducted around the track, usually in convertibles. Clark Gable is seen in a famous photograph of the 1947 race. Among the many celebrities who have attended multiple Indy 500s include Jim Nabors, James Garner, former vice president Dan Quayle, David Letterman, Tim Allen, Florence Henderson, Linda Vaughn, and many others. Paul Newman, who starred in the Indy-related film "Winning", attended the race many times, and from 1983-1995, and again in 2008, was at the race as co-owner of Newman/Haas Racing. During the 1960s and early 1970s, several NASA astronauts from the Apollo program were among invited guests.
Related events.
During the days leading up the race, numerous other related and unrelated events are held in and around Indianapolis.

Frame (psychotherapy)

The Frame in psychotherapy and psychoanalysis refers to the environment and relationship which enables the client to be open about their life with the therapist, and in a secure and confidential manner make a change. It is one of the most important elements in psychotherapy and counselling.
The psychoanalyst Robert Langs [http://members.authorsguild.net/rlangs1/] coined the term frame to mean the setting of boundaries or ground rules for the contractual aspects of therapy.
Significance.
Success in psychotherapy and counselling has been associated with the therapeutic relationship between the client and the therapist. It reflects the genuineness in the relationship between the two. 
Robert Langs writes: "The therapist management of the ground rules of psychotherapy constitute his or her most fundamental arena of intervention, and the therapists efforts in this regard will greatly influence all of the other dimensions of the therapeutic interaction and experience".
The Swedish psychoanalyst Claes Davidson, who thoroughly studied Robert Langs, has taken the frames of psychoanalysis and psychotherapy even further and concludes that most of today's clients' prime problems are not found in the deep unconscious domain, but in the conscious and/or the preconscious ones. These (pre-)conscious conflicts, as Davidson names them, will manifest themselves in the clients' frame deviations, where they for resolution have to be addressed by the active therapist.

Augustin Trébuchon

Augustin-Joseph Victorin Trébuchon (30 May 1878 – 11 November 1918) was the last French soldier killed during World War I. He was shot 15 minutes before the Armistice came into effect, at 10.45am on 11 November 1918. The French Army, embarrassed to have sent men into battle after the armistice with the Germans had been signed, recorded the date of his death as earlier by one day.
Background.
Augustin Trébuchon was born at Montchabrier (near Le Malzieu-Ville in the Lozère) on 30 May 1878, with four younger brothers and sisters. His mother died when he was young and his father nine years later. He had been in the army since the war began in 1914. He was a communal shepherd and played accordion at village marriages before volunteering for the army on 4 August 1914. He joined the 415th Infantry Regiment as a messenger. He had already served in the second battle of the Marne and at Verdun, Artois and the Somme before arriving in the Ardennes at the end of the war. He had twice been wounded, including badly in his left arm by an exploding shell. Upon his promotion to the rank of "Soldat de Première Classe" (Private First Class) in September 1918 it was said that he was "a good soldier having always achieved his duty, of remarkable calm, setting the best example to his young comrades."
Trébuchon, as a messenger, knew an agreement had been signed before the rest of his unit. At Vrigne-sur-Meuse, in the Ardennes, the 163rd Infantry Division was ordered to attack an élite German unit, the Hannetons. General Henri Gouraud told his men to cross the Meuse and to attack "as fast as possible, by whatever means and regardless of cost". It has been speculated that the attack was to end any possible hesitations by German negotiators at Compiègne, that Maréchal Foch believed the Germans were reluctant to sign and so ordered Général Philippe Pétain to press on across the Meuse.
Trébuchon was halfway between Sedan and Charleville-Mézières. Rain was falling and the Meuse was flooding. Its width was put at 70m. The temperature was well below freezing. Warfare had destroyed bridges across the river and sappers worked by night and in fog to build a plank footbridge across a lock. There had been no reconnaissance of the other bank because bad weather had kept the spotter plane on the ground. Around 700 men crossed the river a little after 8am, taking a telephone wire with them. Some fell in the river and the first deaths were by drowning.
The fog cleared at 10.30am and the French could see the Germans installed a little higher than them, a few hundred metres away. The French were spread over three kilometres between the Meuse and a railway line. The Germans opened fire with machine guns. The French sent up a spotter plane now that the fog had lifted and the artillery on the other bank could open fire without fear of killing their own side. Darkness fell again at 6pm and the battle continued until news of the armistice arrived.
The last of the 91 French soldiers to die was Trébuchon, "with a red hole in his right side", probably a figure of speech as this expression comes from Arthur Rimbaud's very famous poem "Le Dormeur du Val" (The Sleeper in the Valley). He was 40. He fell near the railway line with his message still in his hand. It read ""Rassemblement à 11h 30 pour le ravitaillement" - "Muster at 11.30 for food." The armistice followed and the French withdrew without honouring their dead.
Memorial and burial.
Trébuchon is buried in grave 13 at the cemetery at Vrigne-Meuse.
Trébuchon remained unrecognised until a retired breeder, René Fuselier, began inquiring in 1998 into the identity of the last "poilu" to die. He said: "With the computer facilities that we have today, it was easy to find out about him and others of the past."
The date on his memorial at Malzieu-Forain and in the village records is 10 November 1918. The Germans had asked for an armistice on 9 November and it came into effect on 11 November. Nobody knows who ordered the death date to be changed but it is said to be so for all French soldiers who died on 11 November. Speculation that the army was ashamed of sending men into battle knowing the armistice had already been agreed grew when the 115th Infantry Regiment was not invited to the victory parade through Paris on 14 July 1919.
Trébuchon is named on the village memorial as Victorin—his second given name—rather than Augustin.
A street at Vrigne-Meuse, where he died and where he is buried with 17 colleagues in the cemetery, has been named after him.

Albania–Croatia relations

Albania–Croatia relations are foreign relations between Albania and Croatia. Both countries established diplomatic relations on August 25, 1992. Albania has an embassy in Zagreb. Croatia has an embassy in Tirana. Both countries are full members of the Union for the Mediterranean and NATO. Albania became one of the first countries to announce officially about recognition of sovereign Croatia on 21 January 1992.
Political.
In April 2009, both countries became full members of NATO at an event which both Albanian Prime Minister Sali Berisha and Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader attended. Also that year, the two countries decided to build a joint Nuclear Power Plant on the Albanian border with Montenegro. This decision was greeted warily by the government of Montenegro, which is worried about the plant's environmental impact. The two have a history of defense pacts, and overall theirs is a good relationship.

Doppio Petto

Doppio Petto is a short film written and directed by Giuseppe Ferlito. It is filmed in Ferlito's native town of Burgio. The cast is made up of citizens of Burgio and the nearby town of Villafranca Sicula. The technicians of the film all come from the "Cinema Immagina" film school. All the characters in the film, except for the narrator, speak the Burgio Sicilian dialect. There are Italian subtitles for people who do not understand the sicilian dialect. It was filmed in 1997 and was releashed shortly after. It runs about 35 minutes long.
Synopsis.
Pasqualino, on the day of his birthday, hears the voice of his father telling: "Now that you are thirteen and are a man, you finally can stay with the animals". And so it will be; from that day Pasqualino will spend weeks in the country to tend oxen and goats. The games with its friends along the roads of Burgio are a distant memory, and what he most suffers is the separation from 12-year-old Saro (his brother) and from grandfather Pasquale whose name he inherited.
Saro, born a paraplegic, needs of a lot of cares and expenses that worsen a very difficult economical situation.
Pasqualino seems to accept this destiny but in his heart hopes to emigrate and to build a worthier existence. The present condition that makes him a sort of guard (to the sister when she is with her fiancé, to the sick brother because and sick, to the animals) becomes unbearable, and he wishes to go away.
He often meets with Vito, a young shepherd, and shares with him peaceful or awkward moments of his life in the countryside. One day Vito, for carelessness, loses a sheep, the owners infuriated hits the boy, who has a hemorrhage and dies. the body is thrown in a lake to escape justice simulating a death by accident. Pasqualino, eyewitness of the facts, is scared and plans to flee. Driven by this desire of escape he begins to think about the difficulty of the plan.
First of all, he needs new clothing, different from the simple shepherd dress he wears. He remembers that his father had promised him a suit and he had chosen a "doppio petto" (double chest suit). Now this garment represents the freedom and he cannot wait to wear it.
When the father discovers the boy and his brother playing with one of his old suits, he sends them back to the country for the next three months. Now work appears harder than ever because the dream of escape has almost vanished. But a surprise restores hope: Pasqualino's grandfather has persuaded the tailor to go up there, to measure on the incredulous boy his new double chest suit. It will be ready in two weeks. The moment of freedom is close, the last days seem never to go by, the time seems to have stopped.
On the eve of his last work day, an event upsets forever the life of Pasqualino: a peasant warns him to return urgently home. He runs towards the house, meeting people that express by gestures a distressing message of death. When he arrives inside his house, he sees his brother Saro, dead, wearing a double-breasted suit.

Giuseppe Domenico Botto (April 4, 1791 – March 20, 1865) was an Italian physicist. 
Born at Moneglia, He studied at the University of Genoa and the École Polytechnique in Paris. The chair of General and Experimental Physics was assigned to G.D Botto in 1828. Experimental work was dedicated to magnetic, thermal and chemical effects of electrical currents and induction of currents.
In 1830 Botto described in a note a prototype electric motor on which he was working and published a description of it in a Memoria titled "Machine Loco-motive mise en mouvement par l'électro-magnétisme" to the Academy of Turin around 1836.
A device built on the basis of his description was part of the collection of scientific instruments of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, which is now kept at the Institute and Museum of History of Science in Florence. In the following years he published more work on improving efficiency of electric motors.
Botto experimented with electrolysis of water using a manual generator of electric sparks, the electric magnet designed by Leopoldo Nobili and Vincenzo Antinori on the basis of the discovery of' electromagnetic induction, made by Michael Faraday in 1831. In 1833 he tested an iron-platinum thermocouple wrapped as a chain around a wooden stick which generated a current when heat from a flame was applied. The heat from the flame created a temperature difference and the thermocouple converted the temperature difference into an electric voltage.
He also worked on other subjects and published in 1846 a note for the improvement of agriculture in Piedmont. In 1849 he proposed a new system for transmission and encoding for the electrical telegraph system (notes on this subject were recently discovered in the archives of the Museo Sanguineti Leonardini of Chiavari. 
He died at Turin in 1865.

List of United States Representatives in the 111th Congress by seniority

This is a complete list of members of the U.S. House of Representatives in the 111th United States Congress in order of seniority. For the most part, representatives are ranked by the beginning of their terms in office. Representatives whose terms begin the same day are ranked by seniority.
Representatives who return to the House after having previously served in the House are credited with service equal to one less than the number of terms they served. For example, Rep. Baron Hill had previously served three terms, from 1999 to 2005, when he was once again elected in 2006. Instead of holding seniority with others whose terms began January 3, 2007, he was credited with two terms, and holds seniority above all representatives whose terms began January 3, 2001, and after. When a representative has served a prior term of less than two terms (i.e., prior term minus one equals less than one), he or she is ranked above all other whose service begins on the same day. For example, Rep. Jay Inslee was elected to House for a term commencing January 3, 1999, after having served from 1993 to 1995. He ranks above his fellow representatives whose terms began January 3, 1999.
Committee chairmanship in the House is often associated with seniority, especially in the Democratic Caucus. The Republican leadership has a stronger hand in choosing chairmen and ranking minority members, and do so based on ideology and campaign fundraising. However, party leadership is typically not associated with seniority.

Silas Parker (Franco) is a thief who marries Camille Foster (Miller), his parole officer's niece, in hopes it will be his chance to escape to Canada. Silas cannot stand Camille and she is blind to how he really feels, believing that everything will be all right once they get to the falls. After their wedding Camille frets about there being no rice thrown and how that is bad luck.
On the way to Niagara Falls they crash their honeymoon bike and Camille dies in the accident. Thinking that he killed Camille, Silas runs away, breaking into a nearby house to call the police but hanging up before he reports the accident. When he returns to the scene of the accident he finds Camille up and washing in a nearby river. Over the course of the trip Silas realizes that Camille really did die in the accident as she starts to decay. While taking care of her, Silas shows a kinder side due to his guilt over having accidentally caused her death.
Meanwhile the police believe that Silas actually killed his wife and begin to hunt him down. The couple have to evade capture several times and end up traveling with an old rodeo cowboy (Carradine) with colored horses. One of the horses, Maggie, is old and should have died years ago but is still sticking around for some reason. As Camille gets worse she and Silas grow closer, eventually dancing and kissing in the rain. Silas says that while he never believed in anything, Camille believed in him when no one else ever had.
They finally reach Niagara Falls and take the boat tour together. As Silas smiles down on Camille, happy to be with her, she tells him that she is ready now. He turns to ask someone to take their picture, and when he turns back she has vanished. He gets off the boat and heads towards the Canadian border, but stops and goes back looking for Camille. He is then spotted by the police and chased to the edge of the Niagara Falls viewing point. He screams out for Camille – not believing her to be truly dead and gone – and the police, thinking he is still evading arrest, shoot him. Camille suddenly appears, riding toward him on the horse, Maggie. She asked why he did not go on without her and he said he could not. He mounts up behind her and says "I love you" for the first time. They kiss and then turn toward the falls. Camille says "I had a great honeymoon" and Silas answers "Me too."
Then Maggie gallops forward and jumps over the edge into the Niagara Falls with Camille and Silas on her back, all three disappearing into the mist. After they jump, rice starts to fall from the sky.
Release.
The movie played at film festivals in Europe and North America throughout 2007 and 2008. The film was released theatrically in the US on 14 November 2008, in Russia on 4 June 2009, in the UAE on 29 January 2010, and then in Mexico on 22 October 2010.

Christine Corday

Christine Corday (born Laurel, Maryland 1970) is a North American Artist. Corday studied graphic and fine arts as well as the sciences which led to an Astrophysics internship in 1991 with SETI Principal Investigator Dr.Laurance Doyle at NASA Ames Research Center. In 1993, Corday worked for advertising and design agencies as a graphic and structural designer. Between 1996 and 2005, she lived and worked in Portland, Oregon; San Francisco,and Los Angeles, California; Tokyo, Japan; and Seville, Spain. During this time, Corday's work evolved solely in the fine arts, specifically into form such as sculpture and architecture.
PROTOIST Series.
Corday's first steel work entitled "UNE" is a three-ton form beginning the artist's PROTOIST SERIES. "PROTOIST" is a term coined by the artist to describe the intermediary state between the known and the unknown. UNE is hewn from 3 tons of raw weathering steel, standing nearly 9 feet tall with a 13 inch thick arc spanning more than 16 feet. A 2.5 foot torch-cut void runs through the center of the arc; its resulting passage replaces the artist’s hand, or the stroke, in an otherwise mechanical process and alludes to the sensory power of touch reframing the mark of man. Each piece in the series is meant to engender direct physical contact, not only to be touched but to be worn down over time by the tide of human interaction. UNE began its international tour with a debut exhibition in Chelsea under the High Line (New York City), (November 7– December 12, 2008; Curator: Beverly Allan), the Form "inspired local construction workers to make a three-inch steel effigy, which they gave to the artist as a present; what it will evoke elsewhere is anyone's guess." 
The PROTOIST SERIES is conceived and constructed to be consumed by the hand. "Each piece in the PROTOIST SERIES is meant to be touched, to be entered, and even to be walked upon." The Forms are intervened for a sole evening or limited duration in locations—an abandoned interior, an urban alley, a marble piazza—that are selected to motivate the unexpected encounter. 
AHN Corday's second work in the PROTOIST SERIES was installed in the corner of a 5,000 sq. ft. art space in Greenpoint, Brooklyn: Allan Nederpelt. [http://www.allannederpelt.com/allannederpelt/allan_nederpelt.html The 300 pound carbon steel piece supports the juxtaposition of three visible dimensional planes, reminding it’s experiencer of the intersecting choices constructing reality and the impermanence/permanence of "time" and "place". Art reviewer Enrico Gomez spoke to AHN's "grounding resonance" saying, "It optically strums like an electric bass and has considerable gravitational pull. " 
In 2011, the 60" x 120" (151 cm x 303 cm) maquette of PROTOIST Form ÆPI [http://www.christinecorday.com/christine_corday_aepi_i.html] was previewed during the exhibition, All That Is Unseen, curated by Meg O'Rourke and Caris Reid in New York City. The title of the Form fuses the meaning and pronunciation of the Greek root "epi" (upon) from the English words epicenter and epoch with the lost sound of Latin diphthong Æ. The Form’s torch-cut center plate is an abstraction of the figurative self as plateau or stair––standing on its plane shifts a single dimension of perception by 1 and 1/2 inches thus acutely honing the senses to their most subtle realms––a quiet big bang, a floating grounded void, an intimate invitation to the unseen.
Corday lives and works in New York and has work in private collections in Dubai, Dublin, Mexico City, Madrid, Brussels, and Paris. Corday's current works include a permanent abstract installation series entitled "HELDAN" as well as the production of a monumental outdoor form, "INSTRUMENT FOR THE OCEAN TO PLAY", that harvests tidal power to create a low-frequency sound.
Paint.
In 2000, Corday moved her studio from Tokyo, Japan to Seville, Spain. The years in Spain (2000–2004), Corday's palette was limited to black. Corday created her own paint mulling raw pigment and charcoal into a synthetic polymer base to create a tar-like substance and fabricated tools for its application to raw linen and canvas. Corday moved back to the United States in 2005 to a studio in Greenpoint, Brooklyn New York. She created a series of painted works as abstract blueprints for the Form "HELDAN" and the PROTOIST Series. In 2009, Corday's painted work entitled "THAHLES" (72" x 216") was acquired by the Richard Meier collection installed at 165 Charles Street, New York City, New York. And in 2013, "PROME" [http://www.christinecorday.com/christine_corday_paint_prome.html was acquired by the collection of Skidmore, Owings %26 Merrill LLP’s San Francisco office, overseen by Craig W. Hartman, Partner
National September 11 Memorial at World Trade Center.
As seen in "Making the 9/11 Memorial" documentary by History (TV channel) and "Rising, Rebuilding Ground Zero" documentary series by the Discovery Channel, National September 11 Memorial Architect Michael Arad selected the black patina created by artist Christine Corday for the finish of the bronze name parapets which carry the 2,983 victim names from the September 11 attacks and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The bronze name parapets border the edge of the North and South waterfall pools that occupy the former footprints of the North and South Towers. [http://abcnews.go.com/meta/search/imageDetail?format=plain&source=http://abcnews.go.com/images/US/afe22251664d4a2da1e3859e1b072cc4 The selection process for the finish of the bronze was directed by KC Fabrications, the Art and Architectural fabrication company in Gardiner, New York awarded the Bronze Name Parapets through their unique engineering idea in the fabrication and installation of the Memorial.
“Every name has run under the palm of my hand,” Corday said. “Each name here is a life, and that’s never been lost on anyone that’s worked on this project.”

Tarrik Brock

Tarrik Jumaan Brock (born December 25, 1973) is the first base coach for the Houston Astros and a former professional baseball player. An outfielder who batted and threw left-handed, he played part of one season in Major League Baseball for the Chicago Cubs.
Brock was originally drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the 2nd round of the 1991 amateur draft. Of the eleven second-round draftees who made the major leagues, he was the last to make his debut. After six years in the Tigers' system, spent mostly at the A-ball level, Brock was selected by the Seattle Mariners in the Rule 5 draft. Brock spent two seasons in Seattles' minor league system before being released in January 1999.
On April 8 of that year, Brock was signed by the Colorado Rockies and assigned to their AA affiliate, Carolina. He didn't stay long, as he was sent to the Cubs on July 7 as the player to be named later in a trade made on March 28, before he was even under contract with the Rockies. The Rockies in return obtained two prospects, John Cotton and Kevin Rawitzer, neither of whom made the major leagues. 
Brock hit only .217 in 54 games with the Cubs' AA affiliate at West Tennessee that season, but nevertheless made the Cubs' major league roster in spring training of 2000. He made his major league debut on March 29, 2000, appearing as a left fielder in the Cubs' Opening Day game against the New York Mets in the Tokyo Dome in Japan. He faced Rich Rodriguez in his first major league at bat and singled to right field. Sammy Sosa was thrown out at home on the play, ending the inning.
Brock stayed with the team through April 22, but struggled, managing only one other hit, a single off Vladimir Núñez on April 16. He was sent back to Iowa and never made it back to the major leagues. Brock played in the independent Northern League in 2001 and was named an All-Star, but a comeback in 2002 and 2003 with the Los Angeles Dodgers organization failed to get him back to the game's highest level. In 2006, he reemerged as a coach with the Ogden Raptors.
For his major league career, Brock hit .167 (2-for-12), had 4 walks, 4 strikeouts, and stole one base.
He spent part of the 2010 season as the Florida Marlins' interim first base coach.

The Wild World of Batwoman

The Wild World of Batwoman is a 1966 American science fiction superhero film directed by Jerry Warren. The film stars Katherine Victor as Batwoman, George Andre as Professor G. Octavius Neon, and Steve Brodie as Jim Flanagan.
With the popularity of the "Batman" television series, director Jerry Warren decided to make his own bat-figured superhero film. After winning a settlement from being sued for copyright infringement, Warren re-released the film under the title She Was a Hippy Vampire.
Plot Summary.
Batwoman employs the services of several young female agents known as "Batgirls", in her pursuit of justice. Her archenemy is a masked villain named "Rat Fink". Added to the mix is the President and Vice-President of the "Ayjax" Corporation. The company, using plutonium as its fuel source, has created a powerful listening device called "The Atomic Hearing Aid", which allows for limitless eavesdropping. The company has been ordered to destroy the hearing aid by the US Government when the government turned down the offer to buy the listening device (due to its unstable power supply) but the President of the company has refused to do so and now is being confronted by Rat Fink about selling him the device.
The Vice President of Ayjax recruits Batwoman to protect the device but Rat Fink's minions use drugged bowls of soup to drug Batwoman and her allies and steal the device. The two storm the lair and retrieve it, unmasking Rat Fink and converting several of his minions to the side of justice after they fall in love with the Batgirls.
Production.
The original idea for the film began with Jerry Warren realizing there was large popularity with the comic book superhero Batman; Warren decided to make his own Bat-like superhero character into a film. Warren offered the leading role to Katherine Victor. Having worked on Warren's previous productions such as "Teenage Zombies" and "Curse of the Stone Hand", Victor was originally not very excited about working with Warren again. To convince her, Warren promised Victor large production values, color photography and her own bat boat in the film. None of these promises ever came to fruition. On receiving the script for the role of Seltzer, Bruno VeSota recalled that "...once again I was in for it. It would be like memorizing a telephone book with pages picked at random." Katherine Victor claimed that on set if an actor rubbed Warren the wrong way, their lines would be cut out or given to other actors. Victor claimed "the pretty brunette who was kidnapped in the beginning of the picture was supposed to be the lead girl, but for some reason Jerry thought she was getting too big for her britches and gave all her lines to the girl in the leopard tights".
For the monsters in the film, Warren used footage from the Universal Pictures film "The Mole People". Several other scenes throughout the film are also taken from different films, one of which seems to have been from a Swedish film, judging by a background sign reading "Livsmedel", a Swedish word used for grocery stores.
Release.
The film was also released as "The Wild Wild World of Batwoman".
Due to the similar title, the production company Associated Distributors Productions was promptly sued for copyright infringement. Warren won this lawsuit. After the lawsuit and as the popularity of the television series "Batman" died down, Warren re-released the film under the title "She Was a Hippy Vampire".
In 1993, "The Wild World of Batwoman" was released as episode #515 of "Mystery Science Theater 3000" where it was featured with the short "Cheating". This episode was released later on DVD by Rhino Entertainment.
Reception.
Modern reception of the film has been very negative. Fred Beldin of the film database AllMovie gave the film one and a half stars out of five, noting the film as "a rip-off hack job no matter how you slice it, though its innocent veneer, period charm, and forced wackiness might endear the film to fans of similar goofs like "Rat Pfink a Boo-Boo" or "The Nasty Rabbit"". Film director Fred Olen Ray noted the film has "all the earmarks of Warren's worst work, but rises above the level as something as tedious as "Petrified World". It is funny in an unintentional way and sometimes is not hard to look at."

Sohan Qadri

Sohan Qadri (born November 2, 1932, in Punjab, India - March 2, 2011, in Toronto, Canada) is a yogi, poet and a painter from India who has lived in Copenhagen for the past 30 years. His paintings result from states of deep meditation, and are informed by the colors of India: luminous, dye-infused works on meticulously serrated paper. Over his long career, Qadri has interacted with a wide array of cultural figures including Surrealist painter René Magritte, Nobel laureate Heinrich Böll, and architect Le Corbusier. Böll once said, "Sohan Qadri with his painting liberates the word meditation from its fashionable taste and brings it back to its proper origin." He has had more than 70 exhibitions in the United States, Europe, Asia, and Africa.
Early Years in India.
Sohan Qadri was born in the village of Chachoki, in 1932, in British India. Chachoki is near the industrial town of Phagwara in the Kapurthala district of Punjab. He grew up in a wealthy farming family—his mother was Hindu and his father was Sikh. With no electricity, running water, roads or cars, Chachoki was only a few miles from the more cosmopolitan city of Kapurthala, with its many palaces and official buildings in the French Neo-Classical style, which were built by a Francophile maharajah.
As a boy of about seven, two spiritualists living on the family farm entranced him. The first was Bikham Giri, a Bengali Tantric-Vajrayan yogi. The second was Ahmed Ali Shah Qadri, a Sufi, who lived within walking distance of Giri. Both gurus taught him spiritual ideals through meditation, dance and music. Though neither was a teacher in the traditional sense, nor were they interested in proselytizing, their impact was profound. Qadri’s association with them heralded a lifelong commitment to spirituality and art.
Qadri’s artistic talent was first expressed in the village pond. Before bathing, he would play with lumps of mud, shaping them into various toys using sticks and stones. He gouged, scratched and marked the forms— techniques that still prevail in his work—to define features such as eyes and noses. His visual influences came from village life where nature is pervasive. Qadri grew up encircled by the Kangra hills, lush woodlands, gushing streams and a patchwork of cotton and wheat fields.
Qadri continued his schooling in until the eighth grade when he sat for his matriculation exam. His mother wanted him to take charge of the family farm. Initially, he did not display any distress over this, but the anxiety eventually prompted him to run away to the Himalayas. He made his way to Karnaul and into Tibet, staying in monasteries for several months, living among spiritualists and forest dwellers. Meanwhile, his mother dispatched a cousin, a wrestler, to bring him home. He tried to run away twice more but was compelled to return. Eventually, Qadri stood his ground. His refusal to take over the farm dashed his mother’s hopes of extending the family’s upward mobility. Qadri who was the first village child to have gained matriculation, instead completed his three-year undegraduate degree at Ram Garhia College and pursued his art by apprenticing himself to Pyara Singh, a photographer with a studio in Jullandhar, Punjab.
After Pyara Singh immigrated to England in 1952, Sohan left Jullandhar for Bombay. Modernism was an urban phenomenon, and in order to pursue his interest in art he felt he had to leave village life behind. Qadri settled in Parel and worked as a still photographer in an early Bollywood studio in Andheri, Bombay. Unable to find the artistic fulfillment he was seeking, he resigned after completing only two films. While in Bombay he discovered the renowned JJ School of Art and the work of modernist artists Krishna Ara, K.K. Hebbar and Shanti Dave.
Through Ara, Hebbar and Dave, Sohan learned of the existence of fine art colleges where one could receive specialized training, and in 1955, he enrolled in the Simla College of Art, Simla. Satish Gujral, a noted modern painter, was teaching at the college after having spent time with Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo and David Alfaro Siqueiros in Mexico. The curriculum was modeled after the Royal College of Art in London and also specialized in the Rajput and Mughal styles of painting.
While a student, Qadri visited the art galleries of Delhi. He met the renowned artists Sailoz Mukherjee and J. Swaminathan, who were in the process of starting the group Unknown. He became immersed in the artistic milieu of the pioneering Indian modernists M.F. Husain, Syed Haider Raza, J. Swaminathan, and Ram Kumar. The postwar period was a productive time for emerging artists like Qadri who faced modernism in full bloom. Their predecessors, including the Calcutta Group (1942) and the Progressive Artists Group of Bombay (1947), had already defined a vocabulary of modernism based on certain Indian modes of expression and Western modernist syntax. Qadri and his contemporaries were able to build on this vocabulary and even reject their predecessors’ reliance on figuration, which, these earlier artists believed defined them as authentically Indian.
After finishing his degree, Qadri returned home to Phagwara and joined the faculty of the Phagwara Teachers Training College for three years. In 1961, Dr. Mulk Raj Anand, the founder and editor of the art journal Marg, and associate of the Bloomsbury Group of London, recognised Qadri’s talent. After viewing his work at a faculty exhibition, he singled Qadri out and promised to visit his village. Anand spontaneously supported young talent throughout India, and he became Qadri’s first major patron. Anand arrived in Phagwara in 1963 with Pierre Jeanneret, an architect and cousin of the architect Le Corbusier, who acquired a painting for his collection.
Anand and Jeanneret invited Qadri to bring his work to the newly built city of Chandigarh, capital of Punjab and Haryana, designed by Le Corbusier. Qadri’s first exhibition was the second exhibition to be held at Gandhi Bhavan, the Punjab University Library art gallery designed by Jeanneret (the first was MF Husain’s). During this time Sohan changed his last name from Singh to Qadri as a sign of devotion to his Sufi teacher.
After gaining critical acclaim, Qadri began to paint seriously, and in the small town of Jullandhar, began to teach himself about the School of Paris. As was often the case with artists living outside European artistic centers, modernism appeared through secondary material – particularly print media. Sohan educated himself by looking at the magazines Studio International, Illustrated Weekly of India, and Modern Review, as well as reading lectures and books. While reading about Francis Newton Souza, an enfant terrible of Indian art, and his adventures in Paris, Qadri dreamed of visiting modernity’s capital. In the meantime, he built a studio of mud and straw bales in Chachoki and began to teach himself about the Indian and international art scene.
Qadri started creating figurative works, slowly veering toward abstraction, and ultimately abandoning representation in a search for transcendence. “When I start on a canvas,” he says, “first I empty my mind of all images. They dissolve into a primordial space. Only emptiness, I feel, should communicate with the emptiness of the canvas.” Instead of using subject matter drawn from the disaffected, gritty urban world like many of his contemporaries, he searched for subject matter that inspired spiritual feelings and turned to an Eastern mode of expression full of bhava or mood. “I was focusing purely on color and form without distraction from figure,” he says.
Qadri developed the methodology of painting during this period that he still uses today. He divided pure colors into three categories or parts: dark, warm or cool, and light. Dark colors form the earth element or lower level. Warm or cold colors denote energy, each of which possesses a different vibration (vigorous when warm and mild when cold), and form the middle level, and light colors, the upper level. This allowed for a tripartite arrangement that could be organized in descending or ascending order.
In 1962, Qadri had his second exhibition at Sridharani Gallery in New Delhi. After the Sridharani exhibition, and with the help of Randhawa and Dr. Anand in Delhi (then chairman of the Lalit Kala Akademi), several galleries took interest in his work. At the time, Indian artists largely found patrons among the diplomatic or expatriate community, along with a few Indians interested in modern art. Among the collectors of Qadri’s early art were the Belgian Consul and the Canadian and French ambassadors to India.
Journey to Africa.
Prompted by Anand, Qadri decided to travel outside of India and devote himself full-time to painting. He had his first international exposure in Africa. Qadri managed to get a fictitious invitation to a wedding in Nairobi, which helped him secure a passport, a difficult feat at the time. When he learned that he could circumvent the three- to six- month wait for permission to leave Nairobi by sailing bunker-class with indigent laborers in the luggage hold of a passenger ship, he and a poet friend immediately booked passage to Mombasa, Kenya. To pass time on the eight-day trip, he sketched his traveling companions, and one day, a passenger from the upper deck. Soon there was a crowd; everyone wanted a portrait done in the realistic style he’d mastered in Simla. For the rest of the journey he traded drawings for food and whisky.
Qadri brought all of his large paintings, which were originally painted in Chachoki for an exhibition at Bombay’s Taj Art Gallery. He hoped to exhibit them in Kenya. When he landed in Mombasa, the port authorities dumped Qadri’s crate of paintings on the pavement because he could not afford a porter. Qadri and his traveling companion sat with the crate for three days and nights until an acquaintance arrived and agreed to drive them the 300 miles to Nairobi.
Once in Nairobi, he contacted Elimo Njau, a Kenyan cultural figure who visited Delhi often. Njau was born in Tanzania and studied fine arts at Makere University College, Uganda. A catalyst of contemporary culture, Njau had established two nonprofit galleries, Paa-yaa-paa in Nairobi and Kibo in Marangu, Tanzania, where both African and international artists exhibited regularly. Njau immediately recognized Qadri’s work, which he had seen in the Kunika Gallery in Delhi. He offered to shuffle another show to squeeze in Qadri’s exhibition. Qadri then went to Prem Bhatia, the Indian ambassador to Kenya, with an introductory letter from Mulk Raj Anand. Bhatia agreed to sponsor the show and use the embassy’s machinery to promote the exhibition. Bhatia bought the first painting for 75 pounds. The show was a sellout and the talk of Nairobi. This exhibition was followed by an equally successful show at the Stanley Gallery in the renovated, American-owned Stanley Hotel.
European Sojourn.
After his stay in Africa, Qadri went to Zurich. A former girlfriend arranged for him to house sit for a friend, an architect named Jorge Plangg. Qadri and Plangg formed a bond, and Plangg gave him the keys to an associate’s colossal villa called Tilgenkamp. At Tilgenkamp, Qadri prepared for his first European exhibition, held in November 1966 at the Gallerie Romain Louis in Brussels. The exhibition was arranged with the help of respected Swiss art critic Mark Kuhn; yet, of the twenty-three paintings exhibited, only one sold.
Although he had little money, Qadri continued to paint. One day, Kuhn asked Qadri to join him while he interviewed the surrealist painter René Magritte in the artist’s studio. After introductions, Qadri sat quietly while they talked, looking at Magritte’s seminal canvas Ceci n’est pas une pipe sitting on the artist’s easel. After a few hours, Magritte announced that it was his chess time, and that Kuhn should come back the following day to finish the interview. When Qadri told him he’d been a chess champion in Simla, Magritte challenged him to a game, and then quickly beat him.
Before driving with Kuhn from Brussels to Paris to meet Qadri’s first patron, Mulk Raj Anand, and the Indian painter Syed Haider Raza, Qadri sold five paintings to a couple from Montreal who were on their way back to Canada to open a gallery. Once in Paris, he secured an important exhibition in December 1966 at the Gallerie Arnaud alongside major European artists including Pierre Soulages, George Michaux, Jean Paul Riepal and Louis Fatoux. Seven years later, he would show his works at Arnaud’s sister gallery in Montreal.
When he returned to Zurich, Qadri received an invitation to an international artists’ camp in Kushalin, Poland, where he was given lodging, food and painting materials for two months. The Souks Museum of Modern Art in Kushalin acquired one of the paintings he produced during this period. Next to his studio were two Danish artists, painter Bent Kock, and printmaker Helle Thorborg, who were impressed with Qadri’s work. In 1969, Thorborg arranged for him to visit Copenhagen, through the Danish cultural ministry.
Before going to Copenhagen, Qadri showed his work in Vienna at the gallery Uni Generation and at the Government Printing Press called d’Orchai. He also showed in Munich at Stenzel Gallerie and stayed for a period in 1968 in Paris where he rented American artist Mimi Vaz’s studio in Villa d’Essai. There he mixed with Pierre Soulages and James Michaux, whom he had met at the Arnaud Gallerie, along with the Indian artists Syed Haider Raza, Anjolie Ela Menon, N. Vishwanadhan, and Nikita Narayan. He also met well-known printmaker Krishna Reddy who was working with his wife, Judy Reddy and the British painter Stanley William Hayter.
During this time, Qadri stopped painting with impasto oil on canvas and experimented with paper. Though the oils sold well, paper, he felt, was softer, more feminine, and more suited to works that evolved out of a meditative state. “Deep states of being are not brought out by effort,” he says. “When I work with ink and dyes, I don’t have to fight with the canvas. There are no brush strokes, no painter. The aura of the form is the painting.”
While in Paris, the Danish Ministry of Culture offered Qadri a show, including traveling expenses and a stipend. The ministry’s gallery director bought a painting, as did New Yorker Sam Kanner of Court Gallerie. Christian Oberg, from the graphic department of Denmark’s Louisiana Museum, bought several paintings and arranged five exhibitions for Qadri in Denmark.
Life in Copenhagen.
Copenhagen, tranquil in comparison to larger cities like Paris or New York, proved an ideal place in which to create his serene, meditative art forms. Qadri initially lived with the chairman of the Danish Art Society, Dr. Kaj Borck; however, because he arranged to have several exhibitions at once, he required a studio. Borck’s daughter introduced Qadri to Dr. Fritz Schimitto, an eccentric aristocrat who lived by himself in a large villa. Schimitto was an economist in the Danish Ministry who had worked in the same office, from the same chair, for thirty-five years, calculating Denmark’s per-capita income. He was unusually introverted and had little contact with anyone since the death of his mother two years earlier.
The villa, located in the Hellerup area of Copenhagen next to the Indian embassy, was filled with free-flying birds, fish, dogs and turtles. In one of the many dust-covered upper rooms was a giant toy train and in another, Schimitto’s mother’s clothes, laid out just as they were the day she died. Schimitto asked only where Qadri was from, what his profession was and whether he could paint in the villa’s odd surroundings. When Qadri said he could, Schimitto invited him to stay, and Qadri did, except for brief periods, for eighteen years.
In 1973, a few years after settling in Copenhagen, Qadri met another of his most important patrons, Nobel laureate Heinrich Böll. He was introduced to the celebrated writer during a show at the Bodo Galuab Gallery in Cologne, Germany. Böll bought several paintings and wrote about Qadri’s work. Also during this period Qadri, along with American psychedelic painter Linda Wood and Pere Bacho, took over an old gun factory and help found the free city called Christianna which still exists in Copenhagen. In the spirit of the times, everything belonged to everyone in Christianna. There was little privacy and hashish was freely available. Although he enjoyed the openness, it was an impossible environment in which to work. Six months later, Qadri returned to Hellerup, where he stayed until Dr. Shimitto’s death in 1986. He eventually moved into government-sponsored artists’ housing where he lives today.
Though he continued to produce works on canvas, by the mid-1970s, paper was Qadri’s preferred medium. “I was perpetually seeking a medium where effort is superfluous. Deep states of being are not brought out by effort,” he says. His work, he says, is not philosophical—it is not supposed to excite the thinking process. On the contrary, his aim is to arrest the thought process, as in meditation, which Qadri practices daily and teaches.
Qadri’s works are largely monochromatic surfaces which he penetrates with punctures and serrations. The Buddhist scholar Robert Thurman has described his dots and striations as “lustrous bubbles of energy.” Qadri transforms paper with these markings making it into a three-dimensional surface. Despite the fact that he lives in Northern Europe, a sense of Indian ethos pervades his art. His colors are luminous—Sindoori reds, peacock blues, intense oranges, even heavy blacks and grays—and distinctly Indian. Colors fade and seep through the paper. The vibrations created by the colors are endless and break the boundary between the inner space of the image and the external space of the viewer.
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Qadri’s artistic productivity grew and he was invited to have exhibitions in Los Angeles, Copenhagen, Nairobi, New Delhi, Bombay, Singapore and New York. Although he never married, he helped raise his three children with two partners, one a Keralite Christian and the other a Finn. It was also during this time that he began to plan a spiritual earth art project, a gyan stambha or knowledge stupa, located on an ancient trading route in the Punjab in India. The structure, which will eventually occupy several acres of land, will be devoted to knowledge and peace. Construction of the stupa is in progress. Along with creating his art, Qadri has continued to teach meditation throughout Scandinavia to advanced students.
Qadri’s has successfully straddled disparate cultures throughout his career. “I did not want to confine myself to one place, nation or community,” he says. “My approach to life has been universal, and so is my art.”
Quotations.
"It is a privilege to introduce the wisdom and art of Sohan Qadri, even in such a small way as this. Such art does not aim to produce theory. It may not even aim for anything. It invites its participant by opening up the vibrant dimension where it arises. It flourishes within the field of the artist’s experience of reality. He breaks through to pure beauty by seeing through illusion and soaring free. Real freedom does not trap itself, it is simultaneously free from itself and so engages with the illusion out of joy and love for others still unfree. Deceiving illusion is transformed into liberating magic. Wisdom releases the artist into bliss. Bliss spontaneously looks with love on others, willing forth their bliss. The artist envisions a space of beauty where her experience can touch the other’s imagination."
-Dr. Robert Thurman
"There are artists. There are tantrik artists. As far as I know, there are no tantrik yogis who are artists as well. Sohan Qadri is an exception. He is an exceptional artist. He is an accomplished master (guru) in the art of yoga. He is an accomplished master in the art of painting. He is a practicing tantrik yogi, who time to time performs the rituals (panch-makra) of eating taboo foods, drinking wine and indulging in ritual fornication. By breaking the law, in this case, he becomes the legislator.
"To be an iconoclast, one must know how to build images. To break the law, one must
be a learned lawyer."
"Qadri is a learned man. He is a saintly man from whom an aura emanates. Try and expose him as a phoney saint and he emerges as a great artist. Try to put down his art as gimmick and he comes across as a profoundly learned man. Try to debunk his learning and he proves to possess all three—saintliness, aesthetics and wisdom."
"There is no doubt in my mind that Sohan Qadri emerges as a rare and original partner. You may look at his paintings as yantras or mandalas and describe them with words that are mantras. You may look at his paintings as symbolic representations of Kundalini, the ‘serpent-power’ or Shakti, said to be coiled in the rear end of the spinal column. You may look at his paintings as mere form and color and enjoy them as pure art. No matter what angle you choose to look from, it reveals one great aspect—that of mysticism. In its aesthetics, the copulation of mater with the spirit is brought to a climax."
"Sohan Qadri may be a guru. He may be a tantrik sage. He may be anything extraneous to art. To me he is an artist par excellence. Ajit Mookerjee’s Tantra Art (which I reviewed in Studio International, December 1996) states, “It is not astonishing that many great Indian artists finally become saints.” With Sohan Qadri, it seems to me, the reverse has occurred—but perhaps to revert again."
-F.N. Souza (Painter and Writer),
"New York, June 1976"
"The entire task of Qadri’s art is to achieve this aesthetic concretization of the doctrine of Sunyata. Whether his icons emphasize the void, as in the brooding darkness of Nayana and Ankura as well as the luminous emptiness, rimmed with darkness, of Sunyata IV, or the seed, as the erotically alive colors of Seed, Asha, and Dharma I suggest, they are tense with the dialectic of void and seed—the dialectic of creativity"
-Donald Kuspit
"Using abstraction to convey transcendence, he is the pre-eminent aesthetic mystic of modernism."
-Donald Kuspit

Authors (card game)

Authors or, The Game of Authors is a card game for three to five players. The first "Game of Authors" was published by G. M. Whipple & A. A. Smith of Salem, Massachusetts in 1861, and later published by Parker Brothers (also, at the time, of Salem, Massachusetts) in 1897.
The deck of cards consists of eleven sets of four cards each representing the works of eleven famous authors. The object of the game is to form complete sets of the four cards comprising the works of a particular author. The winner is the player with the most sets.
The game is the creation of Anne Abbott, a Beverly, Massachusetts clergyman's daughter and editor of a young people's literary journal. Abbott also designed the hugely popular mid-19th century card game, "Dr. Busby."
Later decks included additional authors, but the authors represented in the original deck were:

Geoffrey Bibby

Thomas Geoffrey Bibby (14 October 1917 - 6 February 2001, Aarhus) was an English-born archaeologist. He is best known for discovering the ancient state of Dilmun, referred to in Mesopotamian mythology as a paradise. He is often considered to have been the pioneer of Arabian archaeology.
Biography.
Thomas Geoffrey Bibby was born on 14 October 1917, in Heversham, England. During the Second World War, he served the British intelligence agency. At one point, he was sent to join the Danish resistance. 
He studied archaeology at Cambridge University prior to World War II, but because he could find no work in that profession after the war, he lived in Bahrain and worked for the Iraq Petroleum Company from 1947 to 1950. On a return visit to Britain he met his future wife, whom he married in 1949. Through her he met the Danish professor Peter Vilhelm Glob and so acquired a position at the University of Aarhus in Denmark.
Excavations.
In 1953, he and professor Glob led a Danish team of archaeologists to Bahrain. The team focused its excavations primarily below the Qal'at al-Bahrain, originally a large stratified tell on the northern shores of the country. The site covered around 50 hectares and was dated to the Early Dilmun period, which was the first quarter of the second millennium BC. The team had initially found pottery from the pre-Early Dilmun period, dated to 2400 BC, to the Hellenic period of Bahraini history. Archaeologists have also discovered a short length of the early Second-millennium city wall and the fragmented plans of six houses in the site. The team also proceeded to excavate in Saar, Bahrain village, which led to the discovery of Saar temple which dated to the Dilmun era.
Bibby also wrote about stone and Bronze Age Europe, particularly the bog peoples of Denmark.

As a child, Grzimek enjoyed the exotic animals of the Berlin Zoo, which is also where he met Hugo Lederer, a professor at Berlin's Akademie der Künste (Academy of Arts), who inspired Grzimek to take up sculpting. During his adolescent years he produced sculptures of an American Bison, an African rhinoceros, busts of his parents heads, and a pet Skye Terrier.
After high school, Grzimek worked as an apprentice stonemason for the construction company Philipp Holzmann AG and also studied sculpture under Wilhelm Gerstel. He completed his degree in 1941, then served in the "Kriegsmarine" until the end of World War II, after which he worked as an art professor and as a freelance sculptor.
Famous works by Grzimek include the Heinrich Heine Memorial (in honor of the 19th-century poet Heinrich Heine), the fountain at Wittenbergplatz, and Holocaust memorials at the Sachsenhausen and Buchenwald concentration camps.

Juraj Kucka () (born 26 February 1987) is a Slovak footballer who plays as a midfielder for the Italian Serie A club Genoa and the Slovakia national football team.
Club career.
Kucka made his Corgoň Liga debut for MFK Ružomberok on 11 March 2007. He played six games in his first season. Overall, Kucka played 49 games and scored eight goals for Ružomberok. Czech manager Michal Bílek, coaching Ružomberok in 2008, recommended Kucka for Sparta Praha. In January 2009, he has signed a three-year contract for Sparta. In the Czech 2009–10 season he won the Gambrinus liga. 
Genoa.
On 6 January 2011, he signed a four-and-a-half-year contract for €3.55 million with Genoa C.F.C. (later extended one more year to 30 June 2016). He made his debut in the Coppa Italia match against Inter on 12 January 2011. He was voted man of the match by Genoa fans after 1–1 draw against Milan on 6 February 2011. Kucka proved immediately to fit fine in the squad, showing a remarkable physical strength and good technical skills, resulting the second best player of Genoa. He scored his first goal for Genoa in a 2–1 away win against Lazio on 18 September 2011.
On 31 August 2011, the last day of transfer window, Inter and Genoa came to an agreement to swap co-ownerships of Juraj Kucka (€8M) and Emiliano Viviano (€5M). In June 2012 Kucka returned to Genoa where he spent 2011–12 season on loan for just €6.5 million, co-currently Samuele Longo returned to Inter for €7M. The deals effectively made Inter lose 50% registration rights of Viviano and spend €3M cash for 50% registration rights of Kucka.
International career.
Kucka, former Slovakia under-21 player, made his senior international debut in friendly match against Liechtenstein on 19 November 2008. Slovakia manager Vladimír Weiss called up him at the 2010 FIFA World Cup even though that he did not play any qualification match. He played in three games at the World Cup against New Zealand, Italy and the Netherlands.

L'Inhumaine

"L'Inhumaine" ("the inhuman woman") is a 1924 French drama-science fiction film directed by Marcel L'Herbier. It was notable for its experimental techniques and for the collaboration of many leading practitioners in the decorative arts, architecture and music. The film gave rise to much controversy on its release.
Background.
In 1923, while seeking to recover his health after a bout of typhoid, and his fortunes following the collapse of his film adaptation of "Résurrection", Marcel L'Herbier received a proposal from his old friend the opera singer Georgette Leblanc to make a film in which she would star and for which she would secure partial funding from American financiers. L'Herbier revived a scenario which he had written under the title "La Femme de glace"; when Leblanc declared this to be too abstract for her liking and for American taste, he enlisted Pierre Mac Orlan to revise it according to Leblanc's suggestions, and in its new form it became "L'Inhumaine". The agreement with Leblanc committed her to provide 50% of the costs (envisaged as FF130,000), and she would distribute and promote the film in the United States under the title "The New Enchantment". The remainder of the production costs were met by L'Herbier's own production company Cinégraphic.
The plot of the film was a melodrama with strong elements of fantasy, but from the outset L'Herbier's principal interest lay in the style of filming: he wanted to present "a miscellany of modern art" in which many contributors would bring different creative styles into a single aesthetic goal.
In this respect L'Herbier was exploring ideas similar to those outlined by the critic and film theorist Ricciotto Canudo who wrote a number of texts about the relationship between cinema and the other arts, proposing that cinema could be seen as "a synthesis of all the arts". L'Herbier also foresaw that his film could provide a prologue or introduction to the major exhibition Exposition des Arts Décoratifs which was due to open in Paris in 1925. With this in mind, L'Herbier invited leading French practitioners in painting, architecture, fashion, dance and music to collaborate with him ("see" "Production", below). He described the project as "this fairy story of modern decorative art".
Synopsis.
Famous singer Claire Lescot, who lives on the outskirts of Paris, is courted by many men, including a maharajah, Djorah de Nopur, and a young Swedish scientist, Einar Norsen. At her lavish parties she enjoys their amorous attentions but she remains emotionally aloof and heartlessly taunts them. When she is told that Norsen has killed himself because of her, she shows no feelings. At her next concert she is booed by an audience outraged at her coldness. She visits the vault in which Norsen's body lies, and as she admits her feelings for him she discovers that he is alive; his death was feigned. Djorah is jealous of their new relationship and causes Claire to be bitten by a poisonous snake. Her body is brought to Norsen's laboratory, where he, by means of his scientific inventions, restores Claire to life.
Production.
Filming began in September 1923 at the Joinville studios in Paris and had to be carried on at great speed because Georgette Leblanc was committed to return to America in mid-October for a concert tour. L'Herbier often continued shooting through the night, making intense demands on his cast and crew. In the event, Leblanc had to leave before everything was finished and some scenes could only be completed when she returned to Paris in spring 1924.
One evening of location shooting became famous (4 October 1923). For the scene of Claire Lescot's concert L'Herbier hired the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées and invited over 2000 people from the film world and fashionable society to attend in evening dress and to play the part of an unruly audience. Ten cameras were deployed around the theatre to record their reactions to the concert. This included the American pianist George Antheil performing some of his own dissonant compositions which created a suitably confrontational mood, and when Georgette Leblanc appeared on stage the audience responded with the required tumult of whistles, applause and protests, as well as some scuffles. The audience is said to have included Erik Satie, Pablo Picasso, Man Ray, Léon Blum, James Joyce, Ezra Pound and the Prince of Monaco.
An impressive range of practitioners in different fields of the arts worked on the film, meeting L'Herbier's ambition of creating a film which united many forms of artistic expression. Four designers contributed to the sets. The painter Fernand Léger created the mechanical laboratory of Einar Norsen. The architect Robert Mallet-Stevens designed the exteriors of the houses of Norsen and Claire Lescot, with strong cubist elements. Alberto Cavalcanti and Claude Autant-Lara, soon to be directing their own films, both had a background in design; Autant-Lara was responsible for the winter-garden set and the funeral vault, while Cavalcanti designed the geometric dining hall for Claire's party, with its dining-table set on an island in the middle of a pool. Costumes were designed by Paul Poiret, furniture by Pierre Chareau and Michel Dufet, jewellery by Raymond Templier, and other "objets" by René Lalique and Jean Puiforcat. The choreographed scenes were provided by Jean Borlin and the Ballets Suédois. To bind the whole together L'Herbier commissioned the young Darius Milhaud to write a score with extensive use of percussion, to which the images were to be edited. (This musical score which was central to L'Herbier's conception of the film has not survived. However, Madeleine L'Herbier told film music historian Theodore van Houten in 1982 that the music for the Léger laboratory scene ended up in the short Percussion Concerto, op. 109, published 1930.)
The final sequence of the film, in which Claire is 'resurrected', is an elaborate exercise in rapid cutting, whose expressive possibilities had recently been demonstrated in "La Roue". In addition to the juxtaposition and rhythmic repetition of images, L'Herbier interspersed frames of bright colours, intending to create counterpoint to the music of Milhaud and "to make the light sing".
Reception.
"L'Inhumaine" received its first public screenings in November 1924, and its reception with the public and with critics was largely negative. It also became a financial disaster for L'Herbier's production company Cinégraphic. One of the film's stars drew a vivid picture of the impact which it had among Parisian audiences during its run at the Madeleine-Cinéma: 
"At each screening, spectators insulted each other, and there were as many frenzied partisans of the film as there were furious opponents. It was amid genuine uproar that, at every performance, there passed across the screen the multicoloured and syncopated images with which the film ends. Women, with hats askew, demanded their money back; men, with their faces screwed up, tumbled out on to the pavement where sometimes fist-fights continued."
Criticism was levelled at the old-fashioned scenario and at the inexpressive performances of the principal actors, but the most contentious aspects were the film's visual and technical innovations. According to the critic Léon Moussinac, "There are many inventions, but they count too much for themselves and not enough for the film"
Many film historians and critics have ridiculed "L'Inhumaine" as misguided attempt to celebrate film as art or to reconcile the popular and the élitist. On the other hand, it was precisely the originality and daring of L'Herbier's concept which won the enthusiasm of the film's admirers, such as the architect Adolf Loos: "It is a brilliant song on the greatness of modern technique. ...The final images of "L'Inhumaine" surpass the imagination. As you emerge from seeing it, you have the impression of having lived through the moment of birth of a new art." A modern commentator has echoed this view more concisely in describing the film as "fabulously inventive".
L'Herbier had always wanted the film to provide to the world a showcase for contemporary decorative arts in France (as well as its cinema) and the film was duly presented in a number of cities abroad (New York, Barcelona, Geneva, London, Brussels, Warsaw, Shanghai, Tokyo). It at least succeeded in drawing more measured responses from those audiences.
After its initial release "L'Inhumaine" was largely forgotten for many years, until a revival in Paris in 1968 attracted interest from new audiences. A restoration of the film was undertaken in 1972, and in 1975 it was successfully shown as the opening event in an exhibition commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Exposition des Arts Décoratifs.
In 1987 it was screened out of competition at the Cannes Film Festival.

Sabatier principle

The principle can be shown graphically by plotting the reaction rate against a property such as the heat of adsorption of the reactant by the catalyst. Such plots pass through a maximum, looking roughly like a triangle or an inverted parabola, and are called volcano plots because of their shape. Analogous three-dimensional plots can also be built against two different properties, such as the heats of adsorption of the two reactants for a two-component reaction. In that case the plot is generally shown as a contour plot and is called a volcano surface. Volcano plots were introduced by Balandin.
The figure on the right shows a volcano plot for the decomposition of formic acid using different transition metals as catalysts. In this case, the heat of formation (Δ"H"f) of the metal formate salt was used for the x axis because studies showed that the reaction intermediate was a surface formate. For the y axis, the temperature at which the reaction reaches a specific rate was used (the y axis is plotted in reverse to preserve the conventional "volcano" shape). At low values of Δ"H"f, the reaction is slow (in other words, requires higher temperatures) because the rate of adsorption is slow and rate-limiting. At high values of Δ"H"f, desorption becomes the rate-limiting step. The maximum rate, which is observed for the platinum group metals in this case, requires intermediate values of Δ"H"f, with the rate being a combination of the rate of adsorption and the rate of desorption.

"Antoinette Blue" is the ninth single released by Nana Kitade. It was used as the fourth ending theme for the anime D.Gray-man. The first press of this single comes with trading cards and stickers from D.Gray-man. The title is a reference to Marie Antoinette, who was famous for having a grey-blue diamond ring. The single gained moderate success and lead-up to her first best of album entitled, "Berry Berry Singles". The single reached #34 on the Oricon chart and stayed on the chart for a total of five weeks. Two years Later it was featured on her 2009 3rd full length album "Bondage" as track #4.
Video information.
The music video for "Antoinette Blue" starts out with showing a dark castle, with a bright full moon behind it and the song's title flashes on the screen. It then starts to give the viewer a closer look at the castle, and even takes them inside on the highest towers. In the tower there is a skeleton of a young girl sitting in a chair. As the moonlight shines on the corpse, it begins to move, and skin appears on it. It gets up and is revealed to be Kitade, who starts singing emotionally.

Deutscher Pfadfinderverband

The Deutsche Pfadfinderverband (DPV; approximate translation: "German Scout Association") is an umbrella federation of sixteen German non-denominational Scouting associations. It was founded in 1970 and serves about 29,000 members. 
History.
The DPV was founded in 1970 under the name "Deutsche Pfadfinder" by a number of regional organizations which had left the Bund Deutscher Pfadfinder (BDP) due to the perceived loss of political neutrality within the latter. In 1971, the Deutscher Pfadfinderbund joined the "Deutsche Pfadfinder" and the federation was renamed to "Deutscher Pfadfinderverband". However, the Deutscher Pfadfinderbund left the federation after some years.
In 1977, the DPV was amongst the founding members of the Deutscher Pfadfinderring (DPR); this traditional Scouting federation tried to form a counterweight to the Ring deutscher Pfadfinderverbände and the Ring Deutscher Pfadfinderinnenverbände. The DPR was disbanded in 1995.
An application for membership in the Ring deutscher Pfadfinderverbände in May 1985 was rejected. The member organizations of the Ring deutscher Pfadfinderverbände requested a merger of the DPV and the Bund der Pfadfinderinnen und Pfadfinder prior to an integration in its ranks. Negotiations between the DPV and the Bund der Pfadfinderinnen und Pfadfinder were closed unsuccessfully in 1989.
At the 2007 annual general meeting in Berlin, the Europa-Scouts resigned from membership in the DPV due to permanently low membership figures. At the same meeting, the Pfadfinder und Pfadfinderinnenbund Nordlicht was accepted as an associate member.
Member associations.
The DPV has a total of sixteen member associations. With the exceptions of Deutscher Pfadfinderbund Mosaik and Pfadfinderbund Weltenbummler, all members are regional organizations. The membership numbers of the component organizations vary widely between 100 and 8,000 Scouts.

Cornelis Hulsman is a Dutch sociologist who has been living in Egypt since 1994. He is currently the editor in chief of the Arab-West Report. AWR includes a weekly digest of various Egyptian press outlets. Hulsman is further an expert on Egyptian printed media, the Coptic Orthodox Holy Family tradition, interfaith relations in Egyptian society, and inter-cultural understanding in the Arab world. Hulsman has been a correspondent for several Dutch media outlets in Egypt, and has been the Secretary-General of the Cairo Foreign Press Association since 2003.
Life.
Hulsman was born in Apeldoorn, the Netherlands, in 1955, and studied development sociology at the State University of Leiden in the Netherlands from 1977-1984. During his studies he specialized during on Islam and Middle Eastern Christianity.
From 1979 to 1982, Hulsman was a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Christian Democratic Youth Appeal (CDJA), and was from 1982-1994 a member of the Middle East Committee of the Christian Democratic Appeal ().
From 1986 until 1994, Hulsman occupied several leading positions in the Dutch emigration service. In 1994, Hulsman became a correspondent for several Dutch media outlets in Egypt, and with his Egyptian wife Sawsan Gabra Ayoub Khalil, founded in 1997 the 
From 1999-2001, at the request of the American University Press in Cairo, Hulsman carried out research on the Coptic Orthodox Holy Family tradition and compared this with earlier work carried out by Dr. Otto F.A. Meinardus in the 1950s and 1960s. Hulsman's work resulted in the chapter “Tracing the Route of the Holy Family Today,” in the book “Be Thou There; The Holy Family's Journey in Egypt,” AUC Press, 2001. Following this research and publication, numerous magazine and newspaper publications on aspects of the Holy Family tradition followed. Hulsman also organized tens of visits to locations related to this tradition, built a Web site about this tradition and has become one of the world's foremost experts on this ancient Coptic tradition.
In 2000 and 2001, Hulsman was the adjunct affiliate assistant professor in Journalism and Mass Communication at the American University in Cairo, and in 2002 organized a workshop for Egyptian journalists regarding reporting on human rights.
Hulsman decided devote his attention to developing an Egyptian institute for inter-cultural understanding, changed the name of the electronic digest RNSAW in 2003 to Arab-West Report. Following this, Hulsman initiated with a group of prominent Egyptians the CAWU then applied for Egyptian Non-Government Organization (NGO) status, which was obtained following a long bureaucratic process in January 2008.
In 2004 Hulsman initiated the construction of an electronic library based on the reviews of Egyptian media and his own investigative reporting in the Religious News Service from the Arab World and Arab-West Report since 1997.
Because of the delays in forming an Egyptian NGO, in 2005 Hulsman and his wife founded the Center for Intercultural Dialogue and Translation (CIDT). CIDT has become the institute preparing media reviews and translations for Arab-West Report.
In May 2006, Hulsman organized the visit of former Dutch Prime Minister Andreas van Agt to Egypt, who lectured at universities and institutions in Cairo about the need for Arab-West understanding and met with prominent government officials in which he expressed strong support for the initiative to create a Center for Arab-West Understanding.
Hulsman became in August 2007 the project director of the Electronic Network for Arab-West Understanding (ENAWU). ENAWU links organizations in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon with organizations in several European countries. This network was launched on June 5, 2008, by HRH Prince Hassan bin Talal.
In March 2008 Hulsman coordinated efforts of the Center for Arab-West Understanding in a successful attempt to defuse the crises created by Dutch Member of Parliament Geert Wilders' film “Fitna,” through organizing a visit of a delegation of Dutch church representatives and Muslim organizations to Egypt which was widely reported about in the Netherlands, asking Egyptian scholars to write reports explaining the Qur'anic texts Wilders highlighted and discussing the crisis on Egyptian TV and in public meetings at Cairo University.
Views.
Cornelis Hulsman believes that tensions between the Arab world and the West, as well as those between Muslims and Christians, should never be reported about in isolation but efforts must be made to understand tensions in their proper socio-economical and historical contexts. Only this will contribute to a better understanding between peoples of different cultures and will help to address problems various people(s) encountered. Media is able to play a prominent role in working toward intercultural understanding but they also can play a highly destructive role. For this reason an effective media watch is greatly needed.
Lectures.
Hulsman lectured on cultural diversity, media, Arab-West relations, Muslim-Christian relations in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Denmark, Czech Republic, Spain, U.S., Jordan and Egypt.
Influences.
During his studies Hulsman was deeply influenced by former Dutch Consul-General to Saudi Arabia, Daniel van der Meulen (1894–1989) who stimulated Hulsman's interest in the Arab world and Muslim-Christian relations., Syrian Orthodox Bishop Samuel Aktash of the Tur Abdin in Turkey who showed him in the mid eighties the damage caused by oriental Christians leaving their homelands, a theme repeated by HRH Prince Hassan bin-Talal in an interview with Hulsman for Christianity Today.
Dr. Otto F.A. Meinardus (1925–2005), Egyptian thinker Dr. William Qilada (1924–1999), and Athanasius, Metropolitan of Beni Suef (1923–2000) influenced Hulsman's outlook on Coptic Christianity and traditions.
Hulsman has in turn influenced hundreds of students, many of who have been interns at Arab-West Report and the Center for Intercultural Dialogue in Cairo.
Selected Books & Reports.
Cornelis Hulsman has published on a number of topics dealing with issues throughout the Arab world, Muslim-Christian relations, and Arab-West relations. Below are listed a selection of Hulsman's material.

The game won a Pulga award for Best Art at the Videogame Industry in Spain Awards in 2009, held at the Gamelab Interactive Leisure International Trade Fair.
Gameplay.
The player takes on the role of being a chef in a restaurant in Yummy Yummy Cooking Jam. The goal of the game is to serve food to customers before they get angry and leave. Players prepare the food by performing a variety of different tasks to create each stage of the dish. In each round they are given a time limit with the goal being to collect a certain amount of tips within the time allotted by getting the orders right and out on time.
The overall goal of the game's main career mode is for players to become the best chef in the city. This is achieved by working their way up to the top by passing through the game's four restaurants: The Hot Dog, Hamburger, Pizza and Mexican Restaurant. The game also features a quick-play arcade mode which also supports two player competitive play that sees players racing against each other to see who can accumulate the most tips within the time limit.
Reception.
WiiWare World gave the game 5 out of 10. They commented that the game does have some enjoyable elements that will appeal to some gamers but said that the "streaky play control", "sharp difficulty curve" and "fairly short length" make it hard to recommend. IGN gave it 3/10, believing the gameplay to be tedious, overly simplistic and repetitive, and likening it to a "freeware Flash game". Go Fanboy scored it 5.5/10 based on a general lack of challenge and overall repetitive gameplay that didn't warrant a purchase.

Folly Island

Folly Island is a barrier island in the Atlantic Ocean near Charleston, South Carolina. It is one of the Sea Islands and is within the boundaries of Charleston County, South Carolina. During the American Civil War, the island served as a major staging area for troops of the Union Army that were attacking Confederate forces in the Charleston region. The largest settlement on Folly Island is Folly Beach.
History.
The name Folly comes from an Old English term meaning "dense foliage." When Europeans first landed on the island in the early 1600s, they discovered a Native American tribe called the Bohickets. It is unclear what happened to them after the land was deeded to William Rivers in 1696. Pirates were known to sail along the South Carolina coast and the many inlets, sounds, bays formed by barrier islands and sea islands like Folly Island. Two of the most memorable were Edward Teach, known as Black Beard, and Stede Bonnet.
For a time, Folly Island was known as Coffin Island not because of deaths or burials, but because of its ownership by the Coffin family, plantation owners of Beaufort and Charleston counties.
The only Civil War related fighting to occur on the island was on May 10, 1863 when Confederate forces attacked Federal forces. Since the Confederates were on a fact-finding mission, the fighting was very small scale. Folly was occupied by the Union army in August 1863 and served as a supply depot and camp for the troops besieging Charleston. Folly Island stayed in Federal control for the rest of the war. It was used as the staging area for the Battle of Morris Island which was July–September 1863. Fort Wagner was located on Morris Island and was the site of the battle fought at the end of the 1989 film Glory.
In the summer of 1934, composer George Gershwin and author DuBose Heyward, went to Folly Island to work on their American folk opera, Porgy and Bess.
Folly Beach is occasionally impacted by hurricanes passing up the Atlantic Coast in the form of wind, rain and heavy surf which causes beach erosion. The most recent hurricane to impact Folly Island was Hurricane Irene in 2011 which caused severe beach erosion and forced the closure of the Folly Beach County Park, a popular public beach access point.

Oracle (software testing)

An oracle is a mechanism used by software testers and software engineers for determining whether a test has passed or failed. It is used by comparing the output(s) of the system under test, for a given test case input, to the outputs that the oracle determines that product should have. The term was first used and defined in William Howden's "Introduction to the Theory of Testing". Additional work on different kinds of oracles was explored by Elaine Weyuker. Oracles are often separate from the system under test. Method postconditions are commonly used as automated oracles in automated class testing. The oracle problem is often much harder than it seems, and involves solving problems related to controllability and observability.
Common oracles include:
