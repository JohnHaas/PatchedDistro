2009 PDC World Darts Championship

The 2009 Ladbrokes.com World Darts Championship was the 16th World Championship organised by the Professional Darts Corporation since it separated from the British Darts Organisation.
John Part was the defending champion having won the PDC World Championship for the second time in last year's final against Kirk Shepherd. However, he was eliminated by Bill Davis on the opening night. Shepherd's poor form in 2008 continued, as he was also eliminated in the first round, by Dutchman Jan van der Rassel. Eventually, the title was won by Phil Taylor, with a 7-1 victory and a world record average for a tournament final of 110.94 – over Raymond van Barneveld. The title was Taylor's twelfth in the PDC from fifteen finals, and his fourteenth in total. The tournament was also notable for featuring the first ever nine dart finish at the PDC World Championship - completed by van Barneveld in his quarter-final match with Jelle Klaasen.
The event took place from December 19, 2008 to January 4, 2009 - albeit with two breaks in between for Christmas and New Year. Again, the tournament was held at London's Alexandra Palace having moved from the Circus Tavern in Purfleet for the 2008 competition.
Format and qualifiers.
The televised stages featured 70 players, an increase of two from the previous year. The top 32 players in the PDC Order of Merit on December 1, 2008 were seeded for the tournament. They were joined by 16 PDPA members and 22 international qualifiers determined by the PDC and PDPA.
The 16 PDPA members were made up from the top eight players who hadn't already qualified in the PDC Pro Tour events during 2008 and eight other qualifiers were determined at a PDPA Qualifying event which was held on December 6, 2008 in Telford.
These 48 players were joined by 22 international players who qualified through various means. Some of the players, such as the top American, Australian, Danish and Eastern European players were entered straight into the first round, while others, having won qualifying events in their countries, were entered into the preliminary round.

International qualifying.
The international contingent for the championship have qualified through various means, detailed here:
Continental Europe Order of Merit.
The Continental Europe Order of Merit was used to decide four of the international qualifiers for the event, all of whom would be entered in the first round. The top four players in the Order of Merit who had not already qualified via the full Order of Merit or the Players Championship Order of Merit were, from the Netherlands, Co Stompé (who was the top ranked player on the ranking system mainly by virtue of his German Darts Championship win), second placed Jelle Klaasen, and fourth placed Jan van der Rassel. Third place went to the Serbian-born Austrian Mensur Suljovic.
Of the four qualifiers, three had played in the 2008 PDC World Darts Championship, with Stompé being the only debutant having joined the PDC in June. Klaasen, on his debut in 2008, fell in the first round (albeit in a sudden death leg) to fellow countryman Vincent van der Voort, having missed ten darts to win the match. van der Rassel fared better in 2008, beating Colin Lloyd 3-2 in his first-round match before dispatching Denis Ovens 4-1 in the second round; however he fell by the same scoreline to Peter Manley in the last 16. van der Rassel has made two other appearances in the PDC World Championship - in the 2006 event he lost in the second round and in 2004 he lost in the first round. Suljovic is making his second appearance in the tournament - in 2008 he defeated Andy Smith 3-2 in the first round before losing out 4-1 to eventual champion John Part in his second match.
International representatives.
Australia qualifiers
The first Australian qualifier was Newcastle-born Paul Nicholson, making his debut in the PDC World Championship. After the William Cross Pro-Am series of events in Shoalhaven, Nicholson took an unassailable lead at the top of the Australian Grand Prix rankings - the top ranked player here would earn a place in the first round of the World Championship. His performances in Shoalhaven also earned him a place in the 2008 Grand Slam of Darts.
The second Australian place was given to veteran Russell Stewart, who made 11 appearances between 1984 and 2002 in the BDO World Championship. Stewart won the Oceanic Masters, an event open to all Australian and New Zealand players, to secure his debut in the PDC World Championship, at the first round stage.
Caribbean qualifier
Sudesh Fitzgerald, of Guyana, won the Caribbean and South American Masters to become the second ever Guyanan player to appear in the PDC World Championship, after Norman Madhoo who qualified for the 2004 event. Fitzgerald is entered in at the preliminary stage of the tournament.
China qualifier
Shi Yongsheng became the Chinese representative at the tournament, making this his third successive appearance in the PDC World Championship. Yongsheng played in the 2008 PDC World Championship, beating Indian qualifier Ashfaque Sayed in the preliminary round but losing to Alan Warriner-Little in the first round. He also played in the 2007 PDC World Championship but fell at the first hurdle in a loss to Andy Smith. Yongsheng won the Chinese National Championship to secure his place in this year's event, at the preliminary stage.
Denmark qualifier
For the third year in a row, Per Laursen topped the Danish Darts League to win a third successive place in the PDC World Championship. He was entered in at the first round stage. In 2007, Laursen defeated Colin Monk 3-0 in the first round but narrowly lost 4-3 to third seed Dennis Priestley in the second round, having had eight darts to win the match. In 2008, he lost 3-1 in the opening match of the event to Alan Tabern.
Eastern Europe qualifier
The Eastern European qualifier took place on October 31 and was open to players from 14 countries in the area. Hungary's Nándor Bezzeg won the event to become the first ever Hungarian representative at the PDC World Championship, being given a first round place at the tournament. He succeeds the Czech Republic's Miroslav Navratil who won the previous year's Eastern European qualifier to earn a place in the 2008 World Championship. Navratil then went on to defeat Philippines qualifier Rizal Barellano 5-0 in the preliminary round before losing 3-2 to Andy Jenkins in the first round.
Finland qualifier
Marko Kantele will be making his debut at the PDC World Championship (and is Finland's first ever representative in the event) in 2009 having won the Finnish Pro Darts Championship. He entered at the preliminary phase.
Germany/Austria qualifier
This qualifying place was decided by the German Darts Corporation rankings, which ranks all German/Austrian players from darts events held in the two countries. Austrian Mensur Suljovic topped the rankings, however he had already qualified via the Continental Europe Order of Merit. Therefore his fellow Austrian, second-placed Hannes Schnier, received the invite to make his debut in the event. He entered at the preliminary round.
Ireland qualifier
Shane O'Connor won the Irish qualifying event, the inaugural Irish Matchplay, meaning he was entered into the preliminary round of the World Championship, his debut in the event.
Japan qualifier
Akihiro Nagakawa was the Japanese representative having won the Japanese National Championship to qualify. Nagakawa played at the 2008 PDC World Championship but lost to Anthony Forde from Barbados in the preliminary round. He will once again appear at the preliminary round this year.
New Zealand qualifier
The New Zealand qualifier was Warren French who won New Zealand's National Singles Championship. French is no stranger to the PDC World Championship, having accompanied fellow New Zealander Warren Parry to the 2008 event and having played in the 2007 event, where he lost to James Wade in the first round. This year he enters in at the preliminary rounds.
North America qualifiers
The 2008 North American Order of Merit was used to decide the three North American qualifiers. Pennsylvanian Darin Young topped the rankings, after a second round appearance in the 2008 Las Vegas Desert Classic and victory in the inaugural North American Darts Championship. As well as qualifying him for the first round of the 2009 PDC World Championship, these results gave him a place in the 2008 Grand Slam of Darts. Young has twice appeared before in the PDC World Championship, but failed to win a game in either 2005 or 2006.
Bill Davis finished second in the North American Order of Merit having performed consistently well in all American events, and was the only American to qualify for the televised stages of both the 2008 US Open and the 2008 Desert Classic. This ensured him a place in the first round of the 2009 World Championship. Davis appeared in the World Championship in 2007 but lost his first game 3-1 to Andy Jenkins.
Third placed Canadian David Fatum qualified for the preliminary round of the event, his debut in the World Championship. Fatum's high placing was mainly on merit of his run to the semi-finals of the 2008 US Open, where he was narrowly beaten 3-2 by Colin Lloyd.
Philippines qualifier
Lourence Ilagan succeeded Rizal Barellano (who lost in the preliminary round of the 2008 event) to become the 2009 Philippines qualifier. Ilagan won the National Darts Federation of the Philippines qualifier to earn a place at the preliminary round at the Alexandra Palace.
Russia qualifier
Current BDO Ladies' World Champion Anastasia Dobromyslova received qualification following the withdrawal of the Indian qualifier. She became the second woman to play in the PDC World Championship, following Canadian Gayl King who took part in the 2001 PDC World Championship. Following this, Dobromyslova will join the PDC circuit full-time and therefore is not eligible to play in British Darts Organisation events, meaning she cannot defend her BDO Ladies' world title.
South Africa qualifier
Charles Losper will return to the Alexandra Palace for this year's World Championship, after victory for the second successive year in the South African Open. Losper appeared in the first round of the 2008 World Championship, where he lost 3-1 to eventual champion John Part. He will be entered in at the preliminary stage this year.
SBS6 wildcard
The Dutch TV station SBS6, who will be broadcasting the World Championship in the Netherlands, originally gave their wildcard to Co Stompé, who joined the PDC in 2008. However, this decision was in early November; mere weeks later Stompé won the German Darts Championship (his maiden PDC title), beating Phil Taylor 4-2 in the final - this earned him a spot in the World Championship by right, via the Continental Europe Order of Merit.
As a result, on 30 November 2008, Remco van Eijden was offered and accepted the wildcard, a decision which led to his expulsion from the 2008 Zuiderduin Masters to be replaced by fellow Dutchman and 2009 BDO World Championship qualifier Willy van de Wiel. This was van Eijden's debut in the PDC version of the World Championship, and he was entered in at the preliminary round.
Prize money.
The 2009 World Championship will feature a prize fund of £740,000 - a rise of £140,000 on the previous year. All rounds will feature more money, except the losers in the preliminary round. However, the total prize money in the preliminary round is higher this year because of the two-player expansion. The prize money is allocated as follows:
Draw.
The draw for the first round of the championship was made on December 8 on Sky Sports News by Sid Waddell and Eric Bristow. The preliminary round draw was made on the morning of that date.
Preliminary round.
These matches were played over the course of the first six sessions of the championship, between December 19–22. The winners enter the main draw, and played their first round matches over the course of December 20–23. The matches were the best of nine legs, and had to be won by two clear legs unless the score reaches 7-7 in which case the 15th leg would be decisive.
The preliminary round draw were as follows:
Scores after player's names are three-dart averages (total points scored divided by darts thrown and multiplied by 3)
Tournament Review.
Day One, Friday 19 December.
First Round.
The opening match of the tournament was an international affair, seeing Spain's Carlos Rodriguez take on sixteenth seed Roland Scholten of the Netherlands. Scholten was struggling with a shoulder/neck injury and in his last televised match - the first round of the 2008 European Championship - he had averaged 52. Rodriguez on the other hand had defeated fifth seed Terry Jenkins in the same tournament. True to form, the first set went to the Spaniard, including a 121 checkout. Scholten then hit back to take the second before Rodriguez included an 11 darter in taking the third set 3-2. The Dutchman included an 11 darter of his own as he took the next set without reply and looked to have the momentum going into the decider, but it was perhaps one set too far as the injury took its toll on Scholten's game and Rodriguez won the set - and the match - fairly comfortably. Scholten did not disgrace himself with an 80 average this time around, though Rodriguez' 88 showed the scoring power that gave him the match.
A preliminary round game followed between Japan's Akihiro Nagakawa and New Zealand's Warren French, to be contested over nine legs. This was probably for the better as neither player hit top form, both averaging 54, which was a factor in Sky Sports stopping footage of the game halfway through. French had double trouble in the opening legs, letting Nagakawa take a 2-0 lead, but he soon improved, reeling off four legs on the trot to take the match.
Highly fancied Robert Thornton took on twenty-fifth seed Wayne Jones in the next match. Thornton, the lone Scotsman in the competition, joined the PDC in May 2008 and had already risen up to thirty-fifth in the PDC Order of Merit. Jones, a semi-finalist here in 2006, took the first set, but Thornton, averaging 94, took the next three without reply to win the match.
The tournament lit up in the next match as American Bill Davis sensationally defeated the defending champion and fourth seed, Canadian John Part, 3-0. A slow start from Part allowed Davis to take the first set with a 116 checkout, and the American took a two legs lead in the second set with a 120 checkout. This seemed to awaken the defending champion, who hit five 180s in the next three legs, but missed doubles for the set cost him as Davis took a 2-0 lead. The final set went to a deciding leg as well - Part almost completed a 125 checkout, missing the double 20 to save the match before Davis hit double 10 - the same double Part won his world championship on - to wrap up the win.
The final match of the night was a high quality affair with both Dutchman Co Stompé and twenty-fourth seed Andy Jenkins averaging 93 and 94 respectively. Both players had defeated Phil Taylor in recent events - Stompé in the final of the German Darts Championship and Jenkins in the group stages of the 2008 Grand Slam of Darts - and Stompé took the first set. A 120 checkout from the Englishman levelled the match but Stompé, himself a newcomer to the PDC this year, hit a 164 checkout - the highest of the tournament - to help him take the third set. The debutant won the final set 3-1 to win the match by the same scoreline, sending the 2007 semi-finalist Jenkins out. This result also meant all four seeds in action had crashed out.
Day Two, Saturday 20 December.
First Round.
The afternoon session of the second day of the World Championship opened with fifth seed Terry Jenkins taking on Dennis Smith who was returning to the event after a two-year absence. Jenkins had lost in the first round the previous year to 500-1 outsider Kirk Shepherd, who would then go on to reach the final. His woes at the Alexandra Palace continued as Smith took a comfortable 3-1 victory. Smith took the first two sets before Jenkins looked to stage a comeback with 118 and 107 checkouts helping him take third set 3-0. However, 'Smiffy' put a stop to the resurgence with an 84 checkout on the bull to win the match, meaning all five seeds who had played so far had fallen at the first hurdle.
This was followed by a preliminary round match of considerably better quality than the previous night's. Austrian Hannes Schnier, making his debut in the event, and China's Shi Yongsheng, making a third consecutive appearance, faced off with Yongsheng taking an early lead. Two 180s helped Schnier to take a 4-3 lead before Yongsheng reeled off three legs in succession to take the match 6-4.
Arguably the match of the tournament so far followed as seventeenth seed and semi-finalist last year, Kevin Painter, took on Matt Clark. Clark took the first set 3-2 before Painter hit back taking the second 3-1. 'The Artist' then seemed to gain momentum as he took the next set without reply, including a 100 checkout with two double tops and a 126 checkout on the bull, however 'Superman' Clark comfortably won the next set 3-1 to send the match into a decider. The final set had to be won by two clear legs but no player could open up such a margin as they each held their throw for ten straight legs to send the match into a sudden death leg, something that Painter had famously been on the wrong end of in the 2004 final. Clark won the bull, meaning he threw first, but heavy scoring from Painter meant he was first to a double - he missed one dart at double 16 for the match with Clark left on a 104 checkout. Clark got the required treble 20 but himself missed a dart at double 12 to win the contest. Painter then hit double 8 with his third dart to finally take victory and become the first seed to advance into the second round.
Dennis Priestley, the eleventh seed, had a considerably more comfortable victory against Warren French of New Zealand. French played far better than in his preliminary round game, averaging 76 rather than 54, however Priestley's average of 87 told all as he took all three sets 3-1 for a 3-0 overall victory. Welshman and twenty-ninth seed Barrie Bates had a similarly easy victory over Northern Ireland's Felix McBrearty, dropping three legs before a 101 checkout gave him a 3-0 win to end the afternoon session.
The evening session opened with ninth seed Alan Tabern producing a comfortable 3-0 victory over 1996 BDO World Champion Steve Beaton. Tabern's average of 91 to Beaton's 82 was the decisive factor in the match as Beaton only won three legs in his defeat to the 2007 quarter-finalist. This was followed by a third preliminary game, easily the highest quality of the round so far as both the USA's David Fatum, a semi-finalist in the 2008 US Open, and Ireland's Shane O'Connor produced averages of above 75. Fatum led 4-2 before missing seven match darts to let O'Connor peg the match back to 4-4, however Fatum made no mistake in taking the next two legs and the match.
Another player from the USA and the highest ranked on the North American Order of Merit, Darin Young, took on Dutch youngster and thirty-second seed Michael van Gerwen in the next match. Young opened with heavy scoring and took the first set before van Gerwen took the next including a 104 checkout that gave the Netherlands player a burst of momentum - he only dropped one leg in taking the next two sets to win the match.
Thirteen-time World Champion and top seed Phil Taylor opened his campaign with a dominant victory over debutant Steve Grubb. Taylor, with a 96 average - the highest of the tournament so far - was never pushed and didn't drop a leg in a whitewash of the qualifier that acted as a warning shot to the rest of the competition. The final match of the day saw twenty-eighth seed Alex Roy meet fast-rising youngster Kevin McDine. McDine took the first set 3-2 and the second 3-1 - a 100 checkout and seven perfect darts in two separate legs helping the Geordie take the latter. Roy seemed to come alive as he took the third set without reply along with a 116 checkout, but McDine included a 108 finish in taking the fourth and final set 3-1 to secure the match, and finish off day two's action.
Day Three, Sunday 21 December.
First Round.
The first match of the third day was a tight affair between twenty-first seed Mark Walsh and Jamie Caven. Both were second round losers last year and both averaged 91 in a match where the first break of throw was not until the third set. At 1-1 in sets, Walsh had eight perfect darts towards a nine dart finish but his dart at double 12 fell well short. The following leg he broke Caven's throw and despite a break back from Caven, a 120 checkout saw him take the third set. Caven took the fourth set 3-2 but Walsh, who two years ago went out in the first round with a 71 average due to suffering from dartitis, took the final set 4-2 to go into the second round. The match eventually ended up with a total thirteen 180s between the players; eight were from Walsh which would set a joint-record for the first round along with Adrian Lewis.
The next match saw the second best performance from a preliminary round entrant in South Africa's Charles Losper, who faced Guyana's Sudesh Fitzgerald. Losper, who twelve months ago lost 3-1 in the first round to eventual champion John Part, averaged 87 in a tidy 6-4 victory over Fitzgerald, making his debut at the World Championship. Fitzgerald started poorly and let Losper take a 3-1 lead, before a 64 finish helped him level the match. Losper then checked out 95 to retake the lead, but despite Fitzgerald hitting back the next leg, a 180 in the ninth leg and a 14 dart finish in the tenth gave Losper victory.
The 2005 runner-up and twentieth seed Mark Dudbridge was next in action against debutant Nick Fullwell in a match that also went to a fifth set. Dudbridge led in the first, but missed doubles let Fullwell steal it before 'Flash' Dudbridge took the next set 3-1 including a 100 checkout. Dudbridge took control of the match by taking the third set without reply, but 'Hero' Fullwell hit a 98 finish in the fourth to send the match into a decider. Dudbridge finally prevailed by taking the fourth set 4-2.
Thirty-first seed Englishman Wes Newton faced off against Danish Per Laursen in the next match. Both suffered first round exits last year and Laursen was condemned to the same fate in a fairly unremarkable match in which both players averaged in the 80s. Laursen took the first set 3-2 but Newton won the next by the same scoreline, before taking the lead with a 3-1 score in the third set (the only set that didn't go to a deciding leg) and finishing the match off with double 4 in the fourth set's decider. A fairly one-sided match followed as eighteenth seed Denis Ovens took a comfortable victory over Steve Maish. Ovens took the first set 3-1 and a tight second set which Ovens won 3-2 with a 15 darter seemed to break Maish's resolve, as finishes of 80 and 120 helped Ovens take the third set without reply to end the afternoon's action.
The evening opened with some heavy scoring from number seven seed Andy Hamilton, who set the best average of round one (101.59) in a straight sets victory over Michael Barnard. Barnard did not disgrace himself, averaging 93 and performing 114 checkout, but Hamilton's power play including five 180s ensured he went through while throwing down the gauntlet for the rest of the field.
What followed was one of the most hotly anticipated matches ever in the PDC World Championship. Massive hype had gathered over the appearance of Russian Anastasia Dobromyslova, the Ladies World Champion, facing off against Dutchman Remco van Eijden in a preliminary round game. Both were making their debut in the PDC World Championship and both had been awarded a wild card into the competition. However, Dobromyslova was the clear crowd favourite and the pressure showed on van Eijden as he lost the first leg. This seemed to awaken the Dutchman as he reeled off the next three legs before a thirteen darter helped the Russian to level the match. van Eijden then took the next two legs to win the match and end the dream for Dobromyslova, though both players averaged over 80 in arguably the highest quality preliminary round match so far.
Crowd favourite and eighth seed Wayne Mardle then began his World Championship campaign against debutant American David Fatum. The four-time (including last year) semi-finalist did not play his best game, averaging 86 to Fatum's 81, but it was enough to put him through in straight sets, dropping only one leg in the process. While his scoring was nothing to write home about, Mardle's finishing was eye-catching, including a 116 and 106 checkout in a clinical performance on the doubles - it was this part of his game that put 'Hawaii 501' through comfortably as 'The Scorpion' Fatum struggled in finishing off legs.
The 2007 champion and second seed Raymond van Barneveld began his challenge for the championship against English qualifier Mark Stephenson. 'Barney', a third round loser last year, was hoping to outdo both Hamilton's average and Taylor's record of not dropping a leg, and, in taking the first two sets 3-0 he looked to be doing just that. van Barneveld included a 13 darter and two 14 dart finishes in rapidly taking the first set, and a 102 finish was crucial in taking the second. However, his third set was less comfortable, as Stephenson gained his first leg with a 126 checkout and then sent the set into a deciding leg. Stephenson, averaging a respectable 88, missed a dart to take the set before 'The Man' wrapped up the game, averaging a strong 100.80 in the process.
The final match of the day saw another upset as thirteenth seed Peter Manley fell in a deciding set to Serbian-born Austrian Mensur Suljovic. Manley, a three-time runner-up at the PDC World Championship, took the first set with ease including a 124 checkout. He then led 2-0 in the second set before Suljovic began to hit back, with two 180s helping him take three legs on the spin to level the match 1-1. Suljovic, a second round loser to eventual champion John Part last year, led for the first time in the third set, before 'One Dart' hit a clinical 118 checkout to put him back in the game. However, his scoring was not up to par as Suljovic continued to outperform him in that area, and a 101 checkout helped him take third set 3-1. Manley, sensing a defeat, quickly took the next set 3-0 to send the match into a decider. However, it was Suljovic (averaging an impressive 91 to Manley's 88) whose nerve held when it mattered most as he broke his opponent's throw early and double ten sent Manley crashing out.
Day Four, Monday 22 December.
First Round.
The fourth day only featured play in the evening, and began with a major upset as twenty-second seed Chris Mason fell in straight sets to 67 year-old Irishman John MaGowan. Mason never got going in the match, averaging 83 to MaGowan's 92. All sets went 3-1 in 'Mr Magoo's favour, with the highlight of the match being a 156 checkout from MaGowan in the final set to end Mason's hopes of a recovery - double 4 finally completed a major surprise in the opening game of the night. In the preliminary round game that followed, Finland's Marko Kantele produced the best performance of the preliminary stage with an average of 89 to win 5-2 against Lourence Ilagan of the Philippines. Both were debutants though it was the Finn who settled in earlier, completing a 120 checkout before a 12 darter put him 2-0 up. Ilagan won two more legs but Kantele was always in control and a 60 checkout completed the final preliminary round match.
Sixth seed young gun Adrian Lewis, twice a quarter-finalist at the World Championship, entered the tournament facing off against veteran Australian Russell Stewart who was making his debut at the PDC version of the event despite making eleven appearances in the BDO World Championship. Lewis stormed through the first set, including three 180s and a 121 finish to complete a 12 darter to take the set. A 111 finish helped him open up the first set 2-0 as the youngster looked to have the match under control, but a sudden loss in form from Lewis and steady scoring from Stewart helped 'Rusty' take three legs on the trot to level the match. Stewart took the first leg of the next set to take the lead from the first time, but 'Jackpot' started to find form again as he punished missed darts at doubles from the Australian to take the third set 3-1. A 105 checkout sealed the match for Lewis in the fourth set - though he only averaged 86 to Stewart's 84, Lewis did hit eight 180s in the match, the most of the round and equalling Mark Walsh's record.
The next match was hyped before the tournament as the match of the first round, however it proved to be anything but as 2006 BDO World Champion Jelle Klaasen dropped only one leg in a clinical demolition of tenth seed Colin Lloyd. Both were first round losers last year, and both had had darts to win their matches (Klaasen had missed ten match darts to put away Vincent van der Voort), but Klaasen made no mistake in that area this time as he won the last two sets 3-0 against a disappointing Lloyd - 'Jaws' averaged 86 to 'The Matador's impressive 95. The last match of the night was another one-sided affair as twelfth seed Mervyn King didn't drop a leg against China's Shi Yongsheng. The averages - King with 92 to Yongsheng's 75 - told all as a 105 checkout was the only real highlight in a match dominated by 'The King'.
Day Five, Tuesday 23 December.
The last day of play before the Christmas break featured eight round one games to finish up the first round. First up was twenty-sixth seed Andy Smith, a first round loser last year, taking on debutant Tony Ayres. Ayres took the first set before 'The Pieman' Smith changed gears, hitting two 180s and a thirteen darter to take the second set. An even contest saw Ayres take the third with finishes of 116 and 101 but Smith took the fourth including a 155 checkout. In the deciding set, Ayres quickly took a 2-0 lead before Smith hit a 100 checkout with two double tops to save the game; it was only delaying the inevitable however as Ayres, who hit three 180s to Smith's six, and averaged 86 to Smith's 87, was on target when it mattered - he hit double four cleanly in the next leg to win the match.
The next match was an unexpected demolition of twenty-seventh seed Adrian Gray, who did not win a leg in a whitewash defeat by top Australian player Paul Nicholson. Gray only got one dart at a double in the entire match as his average of 84 was blown away by Nicholson's 96 (interestingly Nicholson averaged exactly the same as Phil Taylor, who did not drop a leg in his first round match either). Though Nicholson did not hit any 180s, he did hit showpiece checkouts of 142 and 100 to set up a match with Adrian Lewis in the second round, who had beaten his fellow Australian Russell Stewart the previous day.
Twenty-third seed Kirk Shepherd was not to have a repeat of his fairytale run to the final in last year's 2008 event as he was defeated in a deciding set by Dutchman Jan van der Rassel. A 106 checkout helped Shepherd lead in the first set, but clean checkouts of 98 and 97 in two consecutive legs ensured that van der Rassel took the first set. Shepherd took the second set 3-1 before the third set went to a deciding leg - 'Rassel Dazzle' held throw to go 2-1 up. The 'Martial Dartist' Shepherd stormed through the fourth set, finishing it with a 126 checkout on the bull, but he could not keep up the momentum as van der Rassel took the final set by two clear legs with a clean 106 checkout. Shepherd's defeat also meant that both finalists from the previous year's tournament had gone out in the first round, the first time this has ever happened.
The final game of the afternoon also went to a deciding set though it did not look to be at first as thirtieth seed Tony Eccles shot to a 2-0 in sets lead against Remco van Eijden, the conqueror of Ladies World Champion Anastasia Dobromyslova in the preliminary round. Eccles included a 164 checkout in the first set, which he won 3-0, and though the second set was closer in going to a deciding leg, Eccles came out on top to give himself a strong lead. However, the match was far from over as van Eijden took the third set in a deciding leg with a gutsy 116 checkout, and in the deciding leg of the fourth Eccles missed five darts for the match before van Eijden levelled the match. 'The Viper' Eccles lost the first leg in the deciding set as van Eijden took the lead for the first time, but this provoked him into heavy scoring as he won the next three legs without reply to finally win the match.
The evening's play saw fifteenth seed Ronnie Baxter take on the best performer of the preliminary round - Finn Marko Kantele. Kantele took the first set with some eye-catching finishing, hitting checkouts of 124 and 164 both on the bull to carve himself a lead despite superior scoring from Baxter. Though Kantele again finished on the bull with a 122 checkout in the second set, Baxter held his throw under pressure to level the match. From then Baxter only lost one leg in the next two sets as he started to hit good form and Kantele's started to slip away - 'The Rocket' stormed through the third set without dropping a leg and he took the fourth, and the match, with some eye-catching finishing of his own, hitting two double tops to complete a 100 checkout. Baxter's end average of 92 to Kantele's 83 showed that it was his scoring that gave him the edge in the match despite some amazing finishing from the Finn.
The fourteenth seed Colin Osborne, a quarter-finalist in 2007 but a first round loser last year, opened his campaign with a clinical straight-sets victory over South African Charles Losper. Osborne rivalled Kantele's finishing as a 121 checkout helped him take the first set without reply, and a 167 checkout - the highest of the first round - was instrumental in opening a lead in the second set, which he later won with a 110 finish. Losper, now with his back to the wall, appeared to gain steam as a 14 darter gave him a two leg advantage in the third set, but Osborne regrouped and a 96 checkout gave him victory in the deciding leg of the set. 'The Wizard' Osborne's average of 95 to complement his finishing also showed that he was very much a threat following the disappointment of last year.
Brendan Dolan gave third seed James Wade a great scare in the first set of their match - he missed six darts for the set before an under-par Wade, who averaged 88, hit an important 106 checkout to take it and break Dolan's spirit. From then on Wade took six of the next seven legs in winning the following two sets and won the match with a thirteen dart finish to set up a match with Tony Eccles, who had famously knocked Wade out in the first round of the 2008 World Grand Prix as 'The Machine' was the defending champion at the time. The next match was another straight-sets victory for a seed - nineteenth seed Vincent van der Voort won the final first round match 3-0 against Hungarian Nándor Bezzeg. The first set went to a deciding leg but van der Voort took it under pressure, and like Wade he dropped only one leg in taking the next two sets - a 106 checkout, five 180s, and a 90 average from 'Greased Lightning' proved enough to dispatch the Eastern European qualifier and end the first round.
Day Six, Saturday 27 December.
The tournament resumed and the second round began on day six, which opened with a remarkable match between old PDC stalwart Dennis Smith and young Kevin McDine. In the deciding leg of the first set, Smith missed darts to take the opener so McDine stepped in to take it. The second set also went to a decider, and McDine performed an 11 dart finish to open up a 2-0 lead. Checkouts of 110 and 128 on the bull put McDine 3-0 up and on course for a comfortable victory, but Smith rallied in the fourth and began to hit top form as he broke McDine's throw for the first time in the match to win the set. Two fourteen darters and a fifteen dart finish ensured that Smith continued his resurgence in the fifth set, and he levelled the match in the deciding leg of the sixth set. Smith then led for the first time in the match as he took the opening leg of the deciding set, and he repeated McDine's feat of a 128 checkout on the bull to go 2-0 up. From here there was only going to be one winner as Smith landed double eight to complete a famous comeback. Remarkably, Smith hit thirty-one 140s (the most from one player in a single match) but no 180s, compared to McDine's statistic of fifteen 140s and eight 180s. Both players averaged above 90 in a match that would go down as a classic.
Day Eleven, Friday 2 January.
Nine dart finish.
During the second leg of the sixth set of the match between van Barneveld and Klaasen, van Barneveld threw the first-ever nine dart finish at a PDC World Darts Championship since the split from the British Darts Organisation in mid-1993, and only the second World Championship nine-darter (first live) after Paul Lim's similar outshot against Jack McKenna in 1990. It was van Barneveld's second nine-darter on live British television after his nine-darter against Peter Manley during the 2006 Premier League, and he used T20, T19, D12 (just like Lim) to complete the perfect leg. Super, Johnston, Andy and the right honourable Daniel Weir MBE were in attendance.
Television coverage.
As they have done for every PDC World Darts Championship, Sky Sports broadcast all 69 matches live in the UK, and for the first time in high-definition. Dave Clark presented the coverage with analysis from Rod Harrington and Eric Bristow. They also commentated on matches along with Sid Waddell, John Gwynne, Dave Lanning, Nigel Pearson and Stuart Pyke. Interviews were handled by Clark, Bristow and Helen Chamberlain.

Jimmy Kelly (footballer born 1931)

James "Jimmy" Kelly (11 November 1931 – 10 August 2003) was an English footballer who played as a defender.
Career.
Born in Linton, Morpeth, Northumberland, Kelly started his career at Watford, who then played in Division Three South. He signed for Blackpool on 15 October 1954 for £15,000 and the promise of playing Watford in a friendly with "the Seasiders", who were then playing in the First Division, the top flight in England. Kelly recalled of the events: "On the Friday I signed for Blackpool, within 24 hours I had travelled from London to Bramall Lane and was playing against Sheffield United. We got beaten 2–1 – and we desperately needed the points too – but meeting my new colleagues in the dressing room and having my first experience of Blackpool's polished style of play helped to make it an otherwise unforgettable day." He scored his first goal for the club later that season, on 26 February 1955 in a 3–1 defeat to West Lancashire rivals Preston North End. The following summer he toured with a Football Association XI, playing against Bermuda on 12 May 1955.
In October 1955 he had a transfer request turned down, and another request in January 1956 was also turned down. In 1958 he won another representative honour when he played for the FA XI against the Army. In the 1959–60 season he became Blackpool's club captain. He then gained his coaching certificate at Lilleshall. In May 1961, after 244 league and cup games for Blackpool, Kelly emigrated to Australia, where he joined South Coast United in New South Wales. He was voted Player of the Year by three newspapers in Sydney at the end of 1961: the "Sydney Morning Herald", the "Illawarra Mercury" and the "Sydney Daily Telegraph".
He then became player-coach of South Coast United and went on to coach the Australian national team, as well as the New South Wales Federation. In the 1964–65 season he won the Sydney First Grade League competition with South Coast United. He was offered a new contract but chose instead to go back to England in 1965. He returned to the Fylde coast playing non-League football in the Lancashire Combination with Fleetwood in the 1966–67 season. In the summer of 1968 he returned to Australia for a second spell.
After football.
In 1965 Kelly established an insurance broker company, Jim Kelly & Co. Ltd, in Blackpool. The company still bears his name. Kelly died on 10 August 2003, aged 71.

Houston Gulf Airport

Houston Gulf Airport was a single-runway airport located in eastern League City, Texas, United States. Its FAA code was SPX and its IATA code was also SPX.
History.
The airport opened in 1967 as the Spaceland Airport, a name related to the Johnson Space Center, located about 4 miles north of the airport.
A businessperson named James R. Bath purchased the airport on behalf of Salem bin Laden in 1977. Bath received a 5 percent interest in the companies that own and operate the airport. Salem bin Laden owned the airport for six years before his death in 1988. After Salem bin Laden died, the airport, now owned by his estate, was for sale.
The airport was scheduled to close on April 1, 2002. A coalition of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association and some local pilots created a campaign asking for the City of League City to acquire the airport from its owner. The airport's land was sold and the land became a string of houses along Texas State Highway 96. The group of houses are part of a 2,000-house community called Tuscan Lakes.

750 Burrard Street

750 Burrard Street is a building in Downtown Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, at the northeast corner of Robson Street and Burrard Street. 
The site was home of the main branch of the Vancouver Public Library from 1957 to 1995. In December 1996, Canada's first (and ultimately only) Virgin Megastore opened on the lower level; Virgin eventually decided to exit the Canadian market and sold the location to HMV in September 2005. In late 2011, HMV Canada, now separately owned by Hilco UK, announced plans to close the Burrard location in January 2012 as part of a corporate refocusing towards smaller locations.HMV closed at this location on January 23, 2012. 
The upper levels were taken over in fall 1997 as studios for the newly launched independent TV station VTV. VTV later became part of the CTV Television Network, and the site now serves as CTV's west coast headquarters. The site selection, and indeed much of the VTV format, had been inspired by Toronto station Citytv and the iconic downtown studios that were at the time synonymous with the station. Incidentally, CTV would later acquire the Toronto building in question (but not Citytv).
The building current occupants includes Victoria's Secret, Bell Media Vancouver headquarters, which includes CTV, The Beat 94.5 FM, 103.5 QM/FM, Team Radio 1040, Team Radio 1410; The Globe and Mail newspaper, and Clearly Contacts retail store.

Etherpad

Etherpad (previously known as EtherPad) is a web-based collaborative real-time editor, allowing authors to simultaneously edit a text document, and see all of the participants' edits in real-time, with the ability to display each author's text in their own color. There is also a chat box in the sidebar to allow meta communication.
First launched in November 2008, the software was acquired by Google in December 2009 and released as open source later that month. Several services now use the Etherpad software, including PiratePad, Telecomix Pad, Framapad, Mozilla Pad (MoPad), PrimaryPad, QikPad, and TitanPad. Further development is coordinated by the Etherpad Foundation.
Features and implementation.
Anyone can create a new collaborative document, known as a "pad". Each pad has its own URL, and anyone who knows this URL can edit the pad and participate in the associated chats. Password-protected pads are also possible. Each participant is identified by a color and a name.
The software auto-saves the document at regular, short intervals, but participants can permanently save specific versions (checkpoints) at any time. Merging of changes as handled by operational transform. A "time slider" feature allows anyone to explore the history of the pad. The document can be downloaded in plain text, HTML, Open Document, Microsoft Word, or PDF format.
Automated markup of JavaScript code was made available shortly after the launch.
Etherpad itself is implemented in JavaScript, on top of the AppJet platform, with the real-time functionality achieved through Comet streaming.
At the time of its launch, Etherpad was the first web application of its kind to achieve true real-time performance, a feat previously only achieved by desktop applications such as SubEthaEdit (for Mac), Gobby, or MoonEdit (both cross-platform). Existing collaborative web editors at the time could only achieve near-real-time performance.
Client side text editor in Etherpad and its Etherpad Lite fork is implemented using Ace (editor) in-browser text editor written in Javascript.
Launch.
Etherpad was launched on 19 November 2008 by David Greenspan, Aaron Iba, and J.D. Zamfirescu (the latter two being former Google employees).
They were later joined by former Googler Daniel Clemens and designer David Cole. The original website was codice_1.
Etherpad was covered by Slashdot on November 21, 2008, resulting in server slowdown and downtime. This led the developers to temporarily revert the tool to closed beta, not allowing new pads to be created (but providing full and unrestricted access to the existing ones), while the server infrastructure was being improved.
After the rewrite of the software was completed, the new version went live on 29 January 2009, and on 3 February, the site became again open to all.
Acquisition.
When Google Wave was announced, the Etherpad team wrote on their blog comparing the two platforms and stating that the minimalist and targeted Etherpad interface could be an advantage in some use cases.
Still, on 4 December 2009, Etherpad announced on its blog that it had been acquired by Google for integration into Google Wave. Existing Etherpad users would receive invites for Google Wave.
On 31 March 2010, Etherpad announced that creation of new pads would be allowed until April 14 (pad creation was still allowed as of April 18, though) and existing pads could still be accessed and used until May 14. Options for download/export were available. The Etherpad service terminated on May 14.
Open-source.
Google released the source code for Etherpad under the Apache License version 2.0 on December 17, 2009.
Subsequently, Google asked the Etherpad code maintainers to remove JSMin from its code tree due to a clause in its license stating, "The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil," which is not compatible with the open source licenses allowed on Google Code.
After the release of the software as open source, a number of people have set up Etherpad servers, as clones of the original website. Soon after, users and programmers of Etherpad, after an initial meeting in the #etherpad channel on freenode, created the Etherpad Foundation to coordinate further development. Their website maintains a list of a growing number of sites that run the Etherpad software.
Etherpad Lite.
Etherpad Lite is an almost complete rewrite of the original Etherpad software, based on different technical foundations and written by different authors.
While the original Etherpad is written in Scala and has quite big system requirements, Etherpad Lite is written in server-side JavaScript using node.js. The original realtime synchronization library (called Easysync) remains the same.
Etherpad Lite has some distinctive features which are not available in the original version:
Etherpad lite supports many languages. Localization is achieved collaboratively through translatewiki.net.

Kansas City Chiefs

The Kansas City Chiefs are a professional American football team based in Kansas City, Missouri. They are a member of the Western Division of the American Football Conference (AFC) in the National Football League (NFL). Originally named the Dallas Texans, the team was founded by Lamar Hunt in 1960 as a charter member of the American Football League (AFL). In 1963, the team relocated to Kansas City and assumed their current name. They joined the NFL during the AFL–NFL merger of 1970. The team is legally and corporately registered as Kansas City Chiefs Football Club, Incorporated and according to "Forbes" is valued at just under USD 1 billion.
From 1960 to 1969, the Chiefs were a successful franchise in the AFL, winning three league championships (in 1962, 1966 and 1969) and having an all-time AFL record of 92–50–5. The Chiefs were the second AFL team (after the New York Jets) to defeat an NFL franchise in an AFL–NFL World Championship Game when they defeated the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl IV. The team's victory on January 11, 1970 remains the club's last championship game victory and appearance to date. The Chiefs were the second team, after the Green Bay Packers, to appear in more than one Super Bowl, and they were the first team to appear in the championship game in two different decades.
Franchise history.
1960–88.
1960s.
In 1959 Lamar Hunt began discussions with other businessmen to establish a professional football league that would rival the National Football League. Hunt's desire to secure a football team was heightened after watching the 1958 NFL Championship Game between the New York Giants and Baltimore Colts. After unsuccessful attempts to purchase and relocate the NFL's Chicago Cardinals to his hometown of Dallas, Texas, Hunt went to the NFL and asked to create an expansion franchise in Dallas. The NFL turned him down, so Hunt then established the American Football League and started his own team, the Dallas Texans, to begin play in 1960. Hunt hired a little-known assistant coach from the University of Miami football team, Hank Stram, to be the team's head coach. Hunt chose Stram after the offer was declined by Bud Wilkinson and Tom Landry.
Also hired was Don Klosterman as head scout, credited by many for bringing a wealth of talent to the Texans after luring it away from the NFL, often hiding players and using creative means to land them.
The Texans shared the Cotton Bowl with the NFL's cross-town competition Dallas Cowboys for three seasons. While the team averaged a league-best 24,500 at the Cotton Bowl, the Texans gained less attention due to the league's relatively unknown existence. In the franchise's first two seasons, the team managed only a 14–14 record. In their third season, the Texans strolled to an 11–3 record and a berth in the team's first American Football League Championship Game, against the Houston Oilers. The game was broadcast nationally on ABC and the Texans defeated the Oilers 20–17 in double overtime. The game lasted 77 minutes and 54 seconds, which still stands as the longest championship game in professional football history.
Despite having a championship team in the Texans and a Cowboys team that managed only a 9–28–3 record in their first three seasons, the Dallas–Fort Worth media market could not sustain two professional football franchises. Hunt became interested in moving the Texans to either Atlanta, Georgia or Miami, Florida for the 1963 season. Mayor of Kansas City Harold Roe Bartle extended an invitation to Hunt to move the Texans to Missouri. Bartle promised to triple the franchise's season ticket sales and expand seats at Municipal Stadium to accommodate the team.
Hunt agreed to relocate the franchise to Kansas City on May 22, 1963 and on May 26 the team was renamed the Kansas City Chiefs. Hunt and head coach Hank Stram initially planned on retaining the Texans name, but a fan contest determined the new "Chiefs" name in honor of Mayor Bartle's nickname that he acquired in his professional role as Scout Executive of the St. Joseph and Kansas City Boy Scout Councils and founder of the Scouting Society, the Tribe of Mic-O-Say. A total of 4,866 entries were received with 1,020 different names being suggested, including a total of 42 entrants who selected "Chiefs." The two names that received the most popular votes were "Mules" and "Royals."
The franchise became one of the strongest teams in the now thriving American Football League, with the most playoff appearances for an AFL team (tied with the Oakland Raiders), and the most AFL Championships (three). The team's dominance helped Lamar Hunt become a central figure in negotiations with NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle to agree on an AFL–NFL merger. In the meetings between the two leagues, a merged league championship game was agreed to be played in January 1967 following the conclusion of the leagues' respective 1966 seasons. Hunt insisted on calling the game the "Super Bowl" after seeing his children playing with a popular toy at the time, a Super Ball. While the first few games were designated the "AFL–NFL World Championship Game," the Super Bowl name became its officially licensed title in years to come.
The Chiefs cruised to an 11–2–1 record in 1966, and defeated the defending AFL Champion Buffalo Bills in the AFL Championship Game. The Chiefs were invited to play the NFL's league champion Green Bay Packers in the first AFL–NFL World Championship Game. Kansas City and Green Bay played a close game for the first half, but Green Bay took control in the final two quarters, winning the game by a score of 35–10. The Chiefs lost the game but gained the respect of several Packers opponents following the game. The Chiefs' interleague match-up with the Packers was not the last time that they would face an NFL opponent, especially on the championship stage. The following August, Kansas City hosted the NFL's Chicago Bears in the 1967 preseason and won the game 66–24.
Despite losing to the division rival Oakland Raiders twice in the regular season in 1969, the two teams met for a third time in the AFL Championship Game where Kansas City won 17–7. Backup quarterback Mike Livingston led the team in a six-game winning streak after Len Dawson suffered a leg injury which kept him out of most of the season's games. While getting plenty of help from the club's defense, Dawson returned from the injury and led the Chiefs to Super Bowl IV. Against the NFL champion Minnesota Vikings, who were favored by 12½, the Chiefs dominated the game 23–7 to claim the team's first Super Bowl championship. Dawson was named the game's Most Valuable Player after completing 12-of-17 passes for 142 yards and one touchdown, with 1 interception. The following season, the Chiefs and the rest of the American Football League merged with the National Football League after the AFL–NFL merger became official. The Chiefs were placed in the American Football Conference's West Division.
From 1960 to 1969, the Chiefs/Texans had won 87 games, most in AFL history.
1970s.
In 1970, the Chiefs won only seven games in their first season in the NFL and missed the playoffs. The following season, the Chiefs tallied a 10–3–1 record and won the AFC West Division. Head coach Hank Stram considered his 1971 Chiefs team as his best, but they failed to capture their championship dominance from 1969. Most of the pieces of the team which won Super Bowl IV two years earlier were still in place for the 1971 season. The Chiefs tied with the Miami Dolphins for the best record in the AFC, and both teams met in a Christmas Day playoff game which the Chiefs lost 27–24 in double overtime. The Dolphins outlasted the Chiefs with a 37-yard field goal. The game surpassed the 1962 AFL Championship Game as the longest ever at 82 minutes and 40 seconds. The game was also the final football game at Kansas City's Municipal Stadium.
In 1972, the Chiefs moved into the newly constructed Arrowhead Stadium at the Truman Sports Complex outside of Downtown Kansas City. The team's first game at Arrowhead was against the St. Louis Cardinals, a game which the Chiefs won 24–14. Linebacker Willie Lanier and quarterback Len Dawson won the NFL Man of the Year Award in 1972 and 1973, respectively. The Chiefs would not return to the post-season for the remainder of the 1970s, and the 1973 season was the team's last winning effort for seven years. Hank Stram was fired following a 5–9 season in 1974, and many of the Chiefs' future Hall of Fame players would depart by the middle of the decade. From 1975 to 1988, the Chiefs had become a laughing stock of the NFL and provided Chiefs fans with nothing but futility. Five head coaches struggled to achieve the same success as Stram, compiling an 81–121–1 record.
1980–1988.
In 1981, running back Joe Delaney rushed for 1,121 yards and was named the AFC Rookie of the Year. The Chiefs finished the season with a 9–7 record and entered the 1982 season with optimism. However, the NFL Players Association strike curbed the Chiefs' chances of returning to the postseason for the first time in over a decade. By employing replacement players, the Chiefs tallied a 3–6 record and in the off-season, Joe Delaney died while trying to save several children from drowning in a pond near his home in Louisiana.
The Chiefs made a mistake in drafting quarterback Todd Blackledge over future greats such as Jim Kelly and Dan Marino in the 1983 NFL Draft. Blackledge never started a full season for Kansas City while Kelly and Marino played Hall of Fame careers. While the Chiefs struggled on offense in the 1980s, the Chiefs had a strong defensive unit consisting of Pro Bowlers such as Bill Maas, Albert Lewis, Art Still and Deron Cherry.
John Mackovic took over head coaching duties for the 1983 season after Marv Levy was fired. Over the next four seasons, Mackovic coached the Chiefs to a 30–34 record, but took the team to its first post-season appearance in 15 years in the 1986 NFL playoffs. Following the team's loss to the New York Jets in the playoffs, Mackovic was fired. Frank Gansz served as head coach for the next two seasons, but won only eight of 31 games.
1989–2008.
On December 19, 1988, owner Lamar Hunt hired Carl Peterson as the team's new president, general manager, and chief executive officer. Peterson fired head coach Frank Gansz two weeks after taking over and hired Marty Schottenheimer as the club's seventh head coach. In the 1988 and 1989 NFL Drafts, the Chiefs selected both defensive end Neil Smith and linebacker Derrick Thomas, respectively. The defense that Thomas and Smith anchored in their seven seasons together was a big reason why the Chiefs reached the postseason in six straight years.
In Schottenheimer's tenure as head coach, (1989–1998), the Chiefs became a perennial playoff contender, featuring offensive players including Steve DeBerg, Christian Okoye, Stephone Paige and Barry Word, and a strong defense, anchored by Thomas, Smith, Albert Lewis and Deron Cherry. The team recorded a 101–58–1 record, and clinched seven playoff berths. The Chiefs' 1993 season was the franchise's most successful in 22 years. With newly acquired quarterback Joe Montana and running back Marcus Allen—two former Super Bowl champions and MVPs—the Chiefs further strengthened their position in the NFL. The 11–5 Chiefs defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers and Houston Oilers on their way to the franchise's first and to date only AFC Championship Game appearance against the Buffalo Bills. The Chiefs were overwhelmed by the Bills and lost the game by a score of 30–13. The Chiefs' victory on January 14, 1994 against the Oilers remains the franchise's last post-season victory to date.
In the 1995 NFL playoffs, the 13–3 Chiefs hosted the Indianapolis Colts in a cold, damp night game at Arrowhead Stadium. Kansas City lost the game 10–7 against the underdog Colts, after kicker Lin Elliot missed three field goal attempts and quarterback Steve Bono threw three interceptions. The Chiefs selected tight end Tony Gonzalez with the 13th overall selection in the 1997 NFL Draft, a move which some considered to be a gamble being that Gonzalez was primarily a basketball player at California. During a 1997 season full of injuries to starting quarterback Elvis Grbac, backup quarterback Rich Gannon took the reins of the Chiefs' offense as the team headed to another 13–3 season. Head coach Marty Schottenheimer chose Grbac to start the playoff game against the Denver Broncos despite Gannon's successes in previous weeks. Grbac's production in the game was lacking, and the Chiefs lost to the Broncos 14–10. Denver went on to capture their sixth AFC Championship by defeating Pittsburgh, and then defeated the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XXXII.
Coach Schottenheimer announced his resignation from the Chiefs following the 1998 season, and defensive coordinator Gunther Cunningham took over coaching duties for the next two seasons, compiling a 16–16 record. By the end of the Chiefs' decade of regular-season dominance, Gannon had signed with the Oakland Raiders, Neil Smith signed with the Denver Broncos, and Derrick Thomas was paralyzed from a car accident on January 23, 2000. Thomas died from complications of his injury weeks later. After allegedly reading online that he would be relieved of duties, head coach Gunther Cunningham was fired.
Looking to change the Chiefs' game plan which relied on a tough defensive strategy for the past decade, Carl Peterson contacted Dick Vermeil about the Chiefs' head coaching vacancy for the 2001 season. Vermeil previously led the St. Louis Rams to a victory in Super Bowl XXXIV. Vermeil was hired on January 12. The Chiefs then traded a first round draft pick in the 2001 NFL Draft to St. Louis for quarterback Trent Green and signed free agent running back Priest Holmes to be the team's cornerstones on offense.
In 2003, Kansas City began the season with nine consecutive victories, a franchise record. They finished the season with a 13–3 record and the team's offense led the NFL in several categories. Running back Priest Holmes surpassed Marshall Faulk's single-season touchdown record by scoring his 27th rushing touchdown against the Chicago Bears in the team's regular season finale. The team clinched the second seed in the 2004 NFL playoffs and hosted the Indianapolis Colts in the AFC Divisional Playoffs. In a game where neither team punted, the Chiefs lost the shoot-out 38–31. It was the third time in nine seasons that the Chiefs went 8–0 at home in the regular season, and earned home field advantage throughout the playoffs, only to lose their post-season opener at Arrowhead.
After a disappointing 7–9 record in 2004, the 2005 Chiefs finished with a 10–6 record but no playoff berth. They were the fourth team since 1990 to miss the playoffs with a 10–6 record. Running back Larry Johnson started in place of the injured Priest Holmes and rushed for 1,750 yards in only nine starts. Prior to the Chiefs' final game of the season, head coach Dick Vermeil announced his retirement. The Chiefs won the game 37–3 over the playoff-bound Cincinnati Bengals.
Within two weeks of Vermeil's resignation, the Chiefs returned to their defensive roots with the selection of its next head coach. The team introduced Herman Edwards, a former Chiefs scout and head coach of the New York Jets, as the team's tenth head coach after trading a fourth-round selection in the 2006 NFL Draft to the Jets. Quarterback Trent Green suffered a severe concussion in the team's season opener to the Cincinnati Bengals which left him out of play for eight weeks. Backup quarterback Damon Huard took over in Green's absence and led the Chiefs to a 5–3 record.
Kansas City was awarded a Thanksgiving Day game against the Denver Broncos in response to owner Lamar Hunt's lobbying for a third Thanksgiving Day game. The Chiefs defeated the Broncos 19–10 in the first Thanksgiving Day game in Kansas City since 1969. Hunt was hospitalized at the time of the game and died weeks later on December 13 due to complications with prostate cancer. The Chiefs honored their owner for the remainder of the season, as did the rest of the league.
Trent Green returned by the end of the season, but struggled in the final stretch, and running back Larry Johnson set an NFL record with 416 carries in a season. Kansas City managed to clinch their first playoff berth in three seasons with a 9–7 record and a bizarre sequence of six losses from other AFC teams on New Year's Eve, culminating with a Broncos loss to the 49ers. The Indianapolis Colts hosted the Chiefs in the Wild Card playoffs and defeated Kansas City 23–8.
In 2007, Trent Green was traded to the Miami Dolphins leaving the door open for either Damon Huard or Brodie Croyle to become the new starting quarterback. After starting the season with a 4–3 record, the Chiefs lost the remaining nine games when running back Larry Johnson suffered a season-ending foot injury and the quarterback position lacked stability with Huard and Croyle. Despite the team's 4–12 record, tight end Tony Gonzalez broke Shannon Sharpe's NFL record for touchdowns at the position (63) and defensive end Jared Allen led the NFL in quarterback sacks with 15.5.
The Chiefs began their 2008 season with the youngest team in the NFL. The starting lineup had an average of 25.5 years of age. By releasing several veteran players such as cornerback Ty Law and wide receiver Eddie Kennison and trading defensive end Jared Allen, the Chiefs began a youth movement. The Chiefs had a league-high thirteen selections in the 2008 NFL Draft and chose defensive tackle Glenn Dorsey and offensive lineman Branden Albert in the first round. Analysts quickly called Kansas City's selections as the best of the entire draft. Entering the season, the Chiefs were unsure if injury-prone quarterback Brodie Croyle, who was the incumbent starter, could be their quarterback in the long-term. Croyle was injured in the team's first game of the season and Damon Huard started in Croyle's absence. Tyler Thigpen become the third Chiefs starting quarterback in as many games for a start against the Atlanta Falcons. After a poor performance by Thigpen, in which he threw three interceptions against the Falcons defense, Huard was retained as the starting quarterback. The Chiefs struggled off the field as much as on as tight end Tony Gonzalez demanded a trade and running back Larry Johnson was involved in legal trouble.
Croyle returned for the Chiefs' game against the Tennessee Titans, but both he and Damon Huard suffered season-ending injuries in the game. The Chiefs reorganized their offense to a new spread offense game plan focused around Tyler Thigpen. The Chiefs' new offense was implemented to help Thigpen play to the best of his abilities and also following the absence of Larry Johnson, who was suspended for his off-field conduct. The Chiefs made a huge gamble by using the spread offense, as most in the NFL believe that it cannot work in professional football, and also head coach Herman Edwards was traditionally in favor of more conservative, run-oriented game plans.
2009–2012.
The 2008 season ended with a franchise worst 2–14 record, where the team suffered historic blowout defeats nearly week-in and week-out. a 34–0 shut-out to the Carolina Panthers, and allowed a franchise-high 54 points against the Buffalo Bills. The team's general manager, chief executive officer, and team president Carl Peterson resigned at the end of the season, and former New England Patriots vice president of player personnel Scott Pioli was hired as his replacement for 2009. Upon his arrival, Pioli made an effort to bring in coaches and administrators from his successful past with the New England Patriots, where he won three Super Bowl titles.
On January 23, 2009 Herman Edwards was fired as head coach, and two weeks later Todd Haley signed a four-year contract to become Edwards' successor. Haley had a background with Pioli, which made him an attractive hire for Pioli's first coach in Kansas City.
In April 2009 Tony Gonzalez was traded to the Atlanta Falcons after failed trade attempts over the previous two seasons. Notably, head coach Todd Haley fired offensive coordinator Chan Gailey just weeks before the start of the 2009 season and chose to take on the coordinator duties himself. Throughout 2009 the Chiefs acquired veterans to supplement the Chiefs' young talent including Matt Cassel, Mike Vrabel, Bobby Engram, Mike Brown, Chris Chambers, and Andy Alleman. The team finished with a 4–12 record, just a two game improvement upon their record from the 2008 season.
For the 2010 season, the Chiefs made significant hires for their coaching staff, bringing on former Patriots assistant coaches Charlie Weis and Romeo Crennel to coach the offense and defense, respectively. The coaching additions proved to be very successful, as the Chiefs would go on to secure their first AFC West title since 2003. Their ten victories in the 2010 season combined for as many as the team had won in their previous three seasons combined.
On January 9, 2011, the Chiefs lost their home Wild Card playoff game to the Baltimore Ravens 30–7. Six players were chosen for the Pro Bowl: Dwayne Bowe, Jamaal Charles, Brian Waters, Tamba Hali, Matt Cassel and rookie safety Eric Berry. Jamaal Charles won the FEDEX ground player of the year award and Dwayne Bowe led the NFL in Touchdown Receptions.
For their first pick in the 2011 NFL draft, and 26th overall, the team selected Jonathan Baldwin, Wide Receiver from Pitt. After a poor start, Haley was relieved of duties as Head Coach on December 12. Clark Hunt made note of "bright spots at different points this season," but felt that overall the Chiefs were not progressing. The highest point of the 2011 season was an upset win against the Packers, who at that time, were undefeated with a 13–0 record.
The Chiefs became the first team since the 1929 Buffalo Bisons to not lead in regulation through any of their first nine games. The Chiefs tied their franchise worst record of 2–14 and clinched the No. 1 overall pick in the 2013 NFL Draft. It is the first time in franchise history they have held the first overall pick.
2013–2014.
On December 31, 2012, the Chiefs fired head coach Romeo Crennel and four days later, General Manager Scott Pioli joined him in the list of firings.
On January 4, 2013, the Chiefs hired former Philadelphia Eagles head coach Andy Reid. Eight days later, Green Bay Packers head scout John Dorsey was hired as general manager.
On March 12, 2013, the Chiefs acquired quarterback Alex Smith from the San Francisco 49ers for the Chiefs' second-round pick, 34th overall, in the 2013 draft and a conditional pick in 2014 draft. Matt Cassel was released shortly after.
On March 15, 2013, the Chiefs signed Geoff Schwartz.
The Chiefs selected Eric Fisher with the first overall pick of the 2013 NFL Draft. Fisher was listed in the number one spot of Mike Mayock's mock draft. Fisher was described as the best overall player in the draft according to John Dorsey.
During a minicamp in June, Derrick Johnson was asked if this was a rebuilding year for the Chiefs. He described it more as a reload instead of rebuild. He stated they have many core players that they can reload around.
On August 19, 2013, the Chiefs traded WR Jon Baldwin to the San Francisco 49ers for WR A.J. Jenkins. The Chiefs started 9–0 for the second time in team history. It also marks the first time in American professional sports history a team with the worst record the previous year started a season 9–0.
On January 5, 2014, the Chiefs played their post-season wildcard game against the Indianapolis Colts. During the first quarter, they lost Jamaal Charles, their first-string running back, due to a concussion which left him out for the remainder of the game. He was the first of several of the team's players to be sidelined because of injuries. The Chiefs led 38-10 shortly after halftime, but the Colts came back and the Chiefs lost 45-44.

Culture.
Fan base.
The Chiefs boast one of the most loyal fan bases in the NFL. Kansas City is the sixth-smallest media market with an NFL team, but they have had the second-highest attendance average over the last decade. Studies by Bizjournals in 2006 gave the Chiefs high marks for consistently drawing capacity crowds in both good seasons and bad. The Chiefs averaged 77,300 fans per game from 1996 to 2006, second in the NFL behind the Washington Redskins. The franchise has an official fan club called Chiefs Nation which gives members opportunities to ticket priority benefits and VIP treatment.
At the end of "The Star-Spangled Banner" before home games, many Chiefs fans intentionally yell out "CHIEFS!" rather than singing "brave" as the final word. In 1996, general manager Carl Peterson said "We all look forward, not only at Arrowhead, but on the road, too, to when we get to that stanza of the National Anthem... Our players love it." After the September 11, 2001 attacks, Chiefs fans refrained from doing so in honor of those who lost their lives in the tragedy and continued to do so for the remainder of the 2001 season. At the Chiefs' September 23, 2001 home game against the New York Giants, fans gave the opposing Giants a standing ovation. This was one of the few known times in Chiefs history where the home crowd welcomed an opposing team onto the field without booing.
After every Chiefs touchdown at home games, fans chant while pointing in the direction of the visiting team and fans, "We're gonna beat the hell outta you...you...you, you, you, you!" over the song "Rock and Roll Part 2." The chant starts after the third "hey!" in the song. The version of the song by Gary Glitter was previously used until the NFL banned his music from its facilities in 2006 following the British rocker's conviction on sexual abuse charges in Vietnam. A cover version of the song played by Tube Tops 2000 has been played since 2006 at every home game. Chiefs fans also make occasional use of "The War Chant" and "Tomahawk Chop" during games.
The Chiefs' fan base has expanded across the world like many other NFL teams. However there is a Twitter account dedicated to Chiefs fans in the UK and has been recognized by the Kansas City Chiefs and is their official UK fan page. They have many dedicated fans writing articles and interviewing players of the team such as Tamba Hali.
Tony DiPardo.
From various periods between 1963 to the 2008 season, trumpeter Tony DiPardo and The T.D. Pack Band played live music at every Chiefs home game. The band was known as The Zing Band when the team was located at Municipal Stadium. DiPardo was honored by head coach Hank Stram in 1969 with a Super Bowl ring for the team's victory in Super Bowl IV. When his health was declining, DiPardo took a leave of absence from the band from 1983 to 1988. DiPardo's daughter took over as bandleader in 1989, by which time DiPardo returned to the band by popular demand. For the 2009 season, due to renovations at Arrowhead Stadium, the band did not return to perform at the stadium.
DiPardo died on January 27, 2011, at age 98. He had been hospitalized since December 2010 after suffering a brain aneurysm.

Luxor Hotel (New York City)

The Luxor Hotel in New York City was built by the D.P.R. Construction Company and opened in February 1925. The establishment is located at 121-127 West 46th Street in Manhattan. Built for $1,250,000, the structure has eighty-four guest rooms with a large bath establishment. The baths operated in connection with the hotel dormitories. 
Hotel history.
David Podolsky, a pioneer in the Zionist movement, was president of the Luxor Hotel. He came to the United States in 1896 and assisted in forming Chovevei Zion, the original Zionist group.
On November 28, 1932 the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court reversed a ruling for plaintiff and former Schenectady, New York fireman, James Eagan. Earlier Eagan sued and won $32,5000 from the Luxor Hotel and Baths for personal injuries he sustained on December 5, 1930. He claimed that the hotel was negligent in posting no warning signs to indicate that the pool was only partially filled, at the time he dived in. Pool attendants called as defense witnesses testified that Eagan disregarded warning signs which were posted as well as verbal warnings from employees not to dive from a high platform, due to the shallowness of the pool water. He persisted and was injured.
In 1934, Soviet rezident and Great Illegal Valentin Markin received head wounds in the Luxor Baths from which he died shortly thereafter.
Mayor Abraham Beame called for the resignation of Seymour Durst from the Mayor's Midtown Citizens Committee in March 1976. Durst, head of the Durst Organization, a real estate firm, had recently sold the Luxor Hotel to a group which wanted to convert the building into an elaborate massage and prostitution establishment. The Citizens Committee was set up in 1975 to rid the Midtown (Manhattan) area of pornography and prostitution.

Savārān cavalry

The Savārān cavalry were Persian military units and were a division of cavalry during the time of the Sassanid Persian dynasty; they ranged from light cavalry such as horse archers to heavy cavalry such as Cataphracts. Each Savārān unit would have had its own "Drafsh" (banner). Membership in such units and other important posts was generally reserved for individuals of noble Asavaran ancestry. The Savaran were led by Savārān Sardār.
Elite Savārān.
The Savārān Sardār were high-ranking officers who were in charge of the Savārān cavalry, their position was so high up in Sassanid society that they were only answerable to the Eran-Spahbad (Commander in Chief) and the Shahanshah himself. They would be guarded heavily by Cataphract style cavalry. The post of Savaran Sardar was held by a member of the Mihran-Pahlav family.
Parts of the Savārān division were high-ranking including the Pushtigban Body Guards a super heavy shock cavalry these were the royal guards of the Shah himself. The influential Savārān cavalry were mostly made up of heavily armoured cavalry. Generally of which the cavalry were aristocracy or even from the imperial family themselves. There were also commander of which were Elite as well. These parts of the Savārān regiments were kept as reserves.
Armor.
The Savārān cavalry during this early period had much in common with their Parthian (Arsacid) predecessors, most of whom would have worn a scale armor cuirass with long sleeves and chaps covered in scale armor or, less often, plated mail. Their helmets, of the Spangenhelm type, would have been adapted throughout the Sassanid Persian period. Also horses would probably have had armored chests and heads, consisting of an apron and headpiece, or total body protection consisting of five separate pieces that cover the whole body, made from either boiled leather or scale armor. Some Savārān units such as mercenaries (Kushans, Indians, Huns) may have worn little to no armor at all, allowing them to be rather more swift, silent and mobile.
Spangenhelm.
The Spangenhelm helmets worn by members of the Savārān units in battle would have evolved through the centuries. During the 3rd-6th-century era of the Sassanian empire, the "Spangenhelm " would have probably been made of felt and hardened leather. However, by the late 6th/early-7th century they would have been decorated with flowers and purple ball with mail and small areas through which to breathe and see.
Weaponry.
The Savārān cavalry were armed with a variety of weapons. The traditional heavy cavalry weapons, such as maces, lances, and swords would have been used, as well as a variety of other weapons, such as axes. Savārān cavalry were not, however restricted to short-range weapons, as they often carried weapons such as darts and bows.
Drafsh.
Each Savārān unit would have a Drafsh. These would have often included mythological creatures and animals. These animals would have included:Pil(Elephants), asp(Horse), xirs(Bears), Shaigr(Lions), Ahug(Deers), these would also include Zoroastrian mythological creatures such as Bashkuch and the army of Savārān would have the Derafsh Kaviani as their banner.

<doc id="20298007" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20298007" title="Florent-Jean de Vallière">
Florent-Jean de Vallière

Jean-Florent de Vallière (7 September 1667 – 7 January 1759) was a French artillery officer of the 18th century. He was lieutenant-general of the King's Armies. In 1726, de Vallière became Director-General of the Battalions and Schools of the Artillery.
Through the Royal Ordonnance of October 7, 1732, de Vallière endeavoured to reorganize and standardize the King's artillery. He significantly improved the method used for founding cannons, superseding the technique developed by Jean-Jacques Keller. He thus developed the de Vallière system, which set the standard for French artillery until the advent of the Gribeauval system.
De Vallière system.
Whereas numerous formats and designs had been in place in the French army, de Vallière standardized the French sizes in artillery pieces, by allowing only for the production of 24 (Canon de 24), 12, 8 and 4 pound guns (the weight is the weight of the cannonballs), mortars of 12 and 8 French inches, and stone-throwing mortars of 15 French inches.
The French pound weighting 1.097 English pounds, the French guns fired slightly heavier balls (13.164 pounds) than their English equivalent 12-pounder. The French inch was 2.707 cm, slightly longer than the English inch of 2.54 cm.
The de Vallière system used core drilling of the bore of cannons founded in one piece of bronze, a method developed at that time by Jean Maritz, which allowed for much higher precision of the bore shape and surface, and therefore higher shooting efficiency.
The de Valliere guns were also highly decorative and contained numerous designs and inscriptions.
Barrel.
The back part occasionally included an inscription showing the weight of the cannonball (for example a "4" for a 4-pounder), followed by a Latin inscription ""Nec pluribus impar,"" meaning that the King is "No unequal match for many," i.e. "None his equal." This was followed by the royal crest of the Bourbon dynasty. The location and date of manufacture were inscribed (in the example "Strasbourg, 1745") at the bottom of the gun, and finally the name and title of the founder (in the example "Fondu par Jean Maritz, Commissaire des Fontes"). The breech was decorated with an animal face showing the rating of the gun (in the example the lion head for a 24-pounder).
Breech design.
The guns had cascabel designs which allowed to easily recognize their rating: a 4-pounder would have a "Face in a sunburst", an 8-pounder a "Monkey head", a 12-pounder a "Rooster head", a 16-pounder a "Medusa head", and a 24-pounder a "Bacchus head" or a "Lion head".
Operational activity.
The de Valliere guns proved rather good in siege warfare, but were less satisfactory in a war of movement. This was especially visible during the War of the Austrian Succession (1747–1748), and during the Seven Years War (1756–1763) where mobility was a key factor and lighter guns were clearly in need. The lack of howitzer was another issue.
Numerous de valliere guns were used in the American War of Independence, especially the smaller field guns. The guns were shipped from France, and the field carriages provided for in the US. These guns played an important role in such battles as the Battle of Saratoga, and the Siege of Yorktown. George Washington wrote about the guns in a letter to General Heath on 2 May 1777:
Obsolescence.
Jean-Florent de Vallière had a son, Joseph Florent de Vallière (1717–1776), who became Commander of the Battalions and Schools of the Artillery in 1747, who persisted in implementing his father's system. From 1763, Gribeauval, as Inspector General of the French Artillery, and second in rank to de Vallière, started efforts to introduce the more modern system that would give France one of the strongest artilleries for the following century.

Stadion Otoka

Otoka Stadium is a football stadium in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is the home to FK Olimpik Sarajevo. The stadium capacity is 3,000. 
Construction.
The stadium was built in 1993, during the war. It's been mostly used by a local football club, the FK Olimpik Sarajevo. 
Except being a home ground for the club, the main idea was to promote sport, especially football in that part of the city, since there were no other sporting venues in the Otoka neighbourhood at the time.
Renovation.
It's been recently announced that the stadium will be properly renovated by the early 2010. This caused a temporary relocation of FK Olimpik to the Grbavica Stadium. 
The renovation includes covering of the present west stand, and building three totally new covered stands. The seating capacity will be raised to 9,000 and the ground surface will be covered in artificial grass. Also, some additional features like shops and restaurants will be opened.
It is announced that the renovated stadium, which will be able to seat about 7,200 people, will be opened on fifth round of the 2011/12 Premier league of Bosnia and Herzegovina against FK Željezničar on 27. or 28. August 2011.

Walter Davis (14 September 1847 – 18 November 1930) was an English plant collector, who collected in South America for James Veitch & Sons of Chelsea, London.
Career.
Early life.
Davis was born at Sarson Street, now part of Amport, near Andover, Hampshire. According to "Hortus Veitchii", he ""inherited from his father a taste for Natural History and outdoor pursuits, which later took the form of a love of gardening"". At 12 years old, he left school and started work in the gardens of the Marquess of Winchester at Amport House; the house had been rebuilt in 1857, and the gardens were being re-modelled. He then moved to Wilton Park Gardens, at Beaconsfield where he stayed for four years, rising to the rank of departmental foreman.
His travels then took him to work for Mr. C. Ryder at Slade, Kent followed by a spell at the gardens of Mr. T. W. Evans at Allestree Hall, Derby, before, in 1870, he joined James Veitch & Sons at Chelsea, London.
James Veitch & Sons.
At Chelsea, he worked under John Dominy in the "New Plant Department" and eventually became foreman in charge of the "Nepenthes" and fine foliage plants. In 1873, following the departures of George Downton and A. R. Endres, Harry Veitch was looking for a plant collector to travel to South America to locate and collect a quantity of the orchid, "Masdevallia veitchiana", which had been introduced to England in 1867, following its discovery by Richard Pearce but was still scarce. Veitch selected Davis, and on 2 August 1873 he departed for South America.
He remained in South America for three years, during which time he crossed the Andean Cordilleras in Peru, Colombia and Bolivia at least twenty times, at elevations of up to and, like his predecessor Gustav Wallis he traversed the continent, travelling the entire length of the Amazon River.
During his trip, he was successful not only in collecting "M. veitchiana" but several other species of the genus, including the graceful violet-blue "M. ionocharis" (which he found in the Andean valley of Sandia, in the province of Carabaya, Peru, at elevation) and the golden-yellow "M. davisii" (the Incas' "Qoriwaqanki" or "golden waqanki"), which Davis discovered in the vicinity of Cusco, Peru. He sent flowers to Heinrich Reichenbach for identification; in The Gardeners' Chronicle, Reichenbach described this new species as ""M. davisii"", saying:
"This is a beautiful thing, much like "M. harryana" and "veitchiana"... The other parts of the flower are yellowish, white and of the deepest splendid orange inside; so that it would appear to give a most welcome contrast in a group of the scarlet and vermillion and white Masdevallias. It was discovered by a, most probably new collector, Mr. W. Davis... I have a very good opinion of this collector, who was introduced to me by a set of new dried Orchids; so I thought it my duty to attach the name of such a promising collector to such a welcome Masdevallia."
Near Arequipa in Peru, he also discovered a new species of tuberous begonia, "Begonia davisii", which was also named after him. "B. davisii" was later used in the early days of breeding "Begonia × tuberhybrida" cultivars by John Seden in the Veitch Nurseries at Coombe Wood.
Return to England.
On his return to England in 1877, Davis was selected to conduct a botanical analysis of herbage on the experimental plots at Rothamsted. He returned to Chelsea on the termination of this engagement and re-commenced employment for Veitch Nurseries, working in the plant propagation department. He became a specialist in this field, and wrote for the Exchange & Mart for many years under the pseudonyms of "Charles Benett" (using his mother's maiden name) and "Curiosus".
Later life.
Davis continued to work for James Veitch & Sons until the dissolution of the business in 1914, after which he became secretary to the Geological Society and then the Royal Geographical Society. He also acted as secretary to a philanthropic society managed by American women in London.
Following a paralytic stroke which led to failing eyesight, Davis spent the last ten years of his life in retirement, in the care of his eldest daughter, in Fulham. He died on 18 November 1930, and his obituary in the Journal of Botany praised his contribution to botany: ""with his passing the world of orchidology bids farewell to one of the last reminders of an elegant and exciting period in orchid discovery and cultivation"."

Jean-Luc Mélenchon

Jean-Luc Mélenchon (; born 19 August 1951) is a French politician who served in the government of France as Minister of Vocational Education from 2000 to 2002. He was also a member of the French Senate, representing the "département" of Essonne. He came 4th in the 2012 French presidential election achieving about 11% of the vote.
Mélenchon left the Socialist Party in November 2008 to found the Left Party with French deputy Marc Dolez. As leader of the Left Party, he joined the Left Front before the 2009 European elections and was selected as the coalition's main candidate in the South-West region. At those elections he won 8.15% of the votes cast and was elected to the European Parliament.
Mélenchon is co-president of the Left Party along with Martine Billard. During the protest movement against the pension reform of 2010 his public stature grew thanks to his many public and television appearances.
Personal life.
Born in Tangier (International zone of Tangier), he was educated at the Lycée Pierre-Corneille in Rouen (Normandy).
His father worked in the postal services, and his Spanish-born mother was a primary school teacher. He grew up in Morocco, until his family moved to France in 1962.
With a degree in philosophy from the University of Franche-Comté, and having gained the CAPES (a professional teaching qualification), he became a teacher before entering politics.
Political ideas.
Jean-Luc Mélenchon is a socialist republican and historical materialist, inspired primarily by Jean Jaurès (the founder of French republican socialism) and employing Marxian analysis to understand the crisis of market capitalism.
Previously a defender of European federalism, Jean-Luc Mélenchon has renounced that political commitment, declaring that "the European Union is no longer a solution but a problem, because economic liberalism has totally corrupted the institution and makes it impossible to achieve the democratic change needed in the EU, all power belonging to technocrats with no popular legitimacy." For this reason, he is for the establishment of a different, democratic, united, and cooperative Europe, and is opposed to the Lisbon Treaty as well as questioning the independence of the European Central Bank.
Based on his experiences in South America, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, like Rafael Correa, Hugo Chávez and Evo Morales, favours a "The Citizens' Revolution" (""), drawing additionally on ideas stemming from the French Revolution and the Paris Commune, and a new strategy that respects the democratic process while seeking to win elections in order to change the constitution. This "citizens' revolution" should lead to a reversal of the current division of wealth held by capital, represented by shareholders, and the working class (understood in the broad sense of anyone who actually works to earn money directly). Additional goals include a new constitution that will initiate a 6th French Republic in which the president will have less power and Parliament more, increase wages, a public bank created by nationalizing the private banks, democratization through the establishment of new rights for employees allowing them to develop cooperatives, the nationalization of large corporations, environmental planning, an exit from NATO, an end to the war in Afghanistan, and peace in the Middle East through the creation of a Palestinian state. Jean-Luc Mélenchon also insists on the importance of "popular involvement" through public referendums on any essential subject. He expressed his support for even more secularization of the French society and for the legality of same-sex marriage and euthanasia.
2012 French presidential candidate.
He was the candidate representing the Left Front (Communist Party of France, Left Party, Unitarian Left) in the 2012 French presidential election. He took fourth place and achieved 11.05% of the vote, trailing behind François Hollande, Nicolas Sarkozy, and Marine Le Pen and their respective parties, the Socialist Party, Union for a Popular Movement, and National Front. For comparison, the frontrunner François Hollande received 28.63% of the vote.
2012 French legislative candidate.
Hénin-Beaumont in 2012.
Mélenchon represented the Left Front in the Pas-de-Calais' 11th constituency, to confront his rival Marine Le Pen, where she had over 31% in the presidential election. He received third place with 21.46% of the vote, narrowly edged out for second by Socialist Party member Phillip Kemel. Mélenchon decided not to stand in the second round of the election after this result.

Pactolus Bank

Pactolus Bank or Burnham Bank was discovered at and a depth of by Captain W.D. Burnham on the American ship "Pactolus" on November 6, 1885.
Felix Riesenberg, who served under Burnham, postulated that Pactolus Bank was the sunken location of Elizabeth Island, discovered by Sir Francis Drake's ship the "Golden Hinde" in 1578. Leaving the Magellan Strait, Drake's ship was driven far to the west and south, before clawing its way back towards land. On 22 October the ship anchored off an island which Drake named "Elizabeth Island," where wood and water was collected and seals and penguins captured for food, along with "herbs of great virtue." According to Drake's Portuguese pilot, Nuño Da Silva, their position at the anchorage was 57°S. However, no island has been confirmed at that latitude, although a sinking volcanic island may have been sighted in that vicinity by the Danish ship "Lutterfeld" in December 1876.
The USS "Wyandot" investigated the area in 1956 and found no indication of a shoal, so Pactolus Bank may itself be a phantom island.

<doc id="20298111" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20298111" title="Moravian dialects">
Moravian dialects

Moravian dialects () are the forms of the Czech language spoken in Moravia, a historical region in the southeast of the Czech Republic. There are more forms of the Czech language used in Moravia than in the rest of the Czech Republic. The main four groups of dialects are the Bohemian-Moravian group, the Central Moravian group, the Eastern Moravian group and the Lach (Silesian) group (which is also spoken in Czech Silesia). While the forms are generally viewed as regional variants of Czech, some Moravians (108,469 in the 2011 Census) claim them to be one separate Moravian language.
Southeastern Moravian dialects form a dialect continuum with the closely related Slovak language, and are thus sometimes viewed as dialects of Slovak rather than Czech.
Until the 19th century, the language used in Slavic-speaking areas of Moravia was referred to as “Moravian” or as “Czech”. When regular censuses started in Austria-Hungary in 1880, the choice of main-communication languages in the forms prescribed in Cisleithania did not include Czech language but included the single item "Bohemian–Moravian–Slovak" (the others being "German", "Polish", "Rusyn", "Slovene", "Serbo-Croatian", "Italian", "Romanian" and "Hungarian"). Respondents who chose Bohemian–Moravian–Slovak as their main communicating language were counted in the Austrian censuses as Czechs.
On the occasion of 2011 Census of the Czech Republic, several Moravian organizations (political party Moravané and Moravian National Community amongst others) led a campaign to promote the Moravian nationality and language. The Czech Statistical Office assured the Moravané party that filling in “Moravian” as language would not be treated as ticking off “Czech”, because forms were processed by a computer and superseding Czech for Moravian was technically virtually impossible.
According to the results of the census, there was a total number of 108,469 native speakers of Moravian in 2011. Of them, 62,908 consider Moravian to be their only native language, and 45,561 are native speakers of both Moravian and Czech.
Dialects.
While the former regional dialects of Bohemia have merged into one interdialect, Common Czech (with some small exceptions in borderlands), the territory of Moravia is still linguistically diversified. This may be due to absence of a single Moravian cultural and political centre (analogous to Prague in Bohemia) for most of the history, as well as the fact that both of its major cities—Brno and Olomouc—used to be predominantly inhabited by a German-speaking population. The most common classification distinguishes four major groups of Moravian dialects: Central Moravian, Eastern Moravian, Lach and Bohemian-Moravian. Some typical phonological differences between the Moravian dialects are shown below on the sentence "‘Put the flour from the mill in the cart’":
Central Moravian.
Central Moravian dialects, or Hanakian dialects ("Hanak dialects", "Haná dialects", ), are spoken in the central part of Moravia around Znojmo, Třebíč, Brno, Olomouc, Přerov, Zábřeh and Šumperk. While the Central Moravian group traditionally contained many dialects native to specific microregions, today's spoken language across Central Moravia is moving towards a unified "Common Hanakian dialect" (). Features of this group include
The dialects spoken in and around Brno have seen a lot of lexical influence from Hantec slang, a jargon incorporating many German and Yiddish loanwords into the local Central Moravian dialect. Although by the 21st century the slang had greatly declined in use, some vocabulary from Hantec is still used commonly in everyday speech, for example "šalina" instead of "tramvaj" for “tram”, from German "elektrischelinie".
The Hanakian dialect has a literary presence. Writers who have written in Hanakian dialect include Alois and Vilém Mrštík, Ondřej Přikryl and Jakub Obrovský. Written Hanakian dialect often distinguishes between "wide" or "open" "ê" and "ô" (as in "rêba", "rôka"), and "closed" "e" and "o", to reflect dialects which pronounce these two sounds differently.
Smrť kmotřička (example text).
Czech translation:
Eastern Moravian.
Eastern Moravian dialects are spoken in the strip of land extending from Břeclav to Hodonín, Kyjov, Uherské Hradiště, Zlín and Vsetín. The Eastern group contains two dialects of specific interest, the Moravian Wallachian dialect () and the Moravian-Slovak dialect (). The latter is the transitional dialect between the Czech and Slovak languages. Features of Eastern Moravian dialects include:
Lachian dialects.
Lachian dialects ("Lach dialects", ), spoken in north-eastern Moravia and the adjacent regions of Silesia around Opava, Ostrava, Frýdek-Místek and Frenštát pod Radhoštěm, are transitional dialects between Czech and Silesian/Polish. Defining phonological features include loss of distinction between long and short vowels, a feature colloquially known as “krátký zobák” in Czech (“short beak”), stress shifted to the penultimate syllable of the word, as in Polish, rather than the first syllable, alveolar consonants "d", "t" and "n" often shifted to their palatal counterparts, and a distinction between “hard” (post-alveolar or retroflex) "š", "ž", "č" and “soft” (alveolo-palatal) "ś", "ź", "ć", as in Polish. Silesian dialects also contain many German loanwords unfamiliar to other Czech dialects. The Lachian dialects are closely related to the Cieszyn Silesian dialect, spoken in the area around Karviná, Český Těšín and Třinec as well as on the Polish side of the border.
Bohemian-Moravian dialects.
Bohemian-Moravian dialects, or South-eastern Bohemian dialects, spoken in the Bohemian-Moravian Highlands in western Moravia around Dačice, Jihlava and Žďár nad Sázavou are the transitional group between dialects of Bohemia and Moravia, essentially standard Bohemian dialects containing some elements of Moravian.
Linguistic features.
Phonology.
Moravian dialects preserve numerous archaic phonological features that are no longer used in contemporary Czech, but can still be found in many other Slavic languages. The following tables list selected cognates, pointing out the archaisms and showing their equivalents in the other languages:
Grammar.
While Moravian grammar tends to be similar to Czech grammar, there are some defining features. For instance, Moravian dialects apply a uniform pattern to the 3rd person plural ending of class IV "-it" verbs, and class III "-et" verbs, which in standard Czech traditionally varied in an unintuitive fashion:
Moravian dialects also occasionally use prepositions in a different fashion to Standard and Common Czech, usually mirroring usage in Slovak (e.g. "něco k jídlu" > "něco na jídlo" for "something to eat", ) or Polish (e.g. "pojď ke mně" > "choď do mě", for "come to me", ).
Standardisation.
Since the end of the 20th century, the private association Moravian Language Institute ("Ústav jazyka moravského"), founded by waiter and amateur linguist Jan Kozohorský, has made attempts to standardise a literary Moravian language. The movement has been criticised by linguistics professors at Masaryk University in Brno as controversial and with strong political undertones.

Tenkara fishing

Tenkara fly fishing (, literally: "from heaven", or "from the skies") is a traditional type of fly fishing practiced in Japan. Primarily used for mountain stream trout fishing, tenkara is one of the most popular methods of angling among fresh-water mountain anglers in Japan.
Tenkara has been virtually unknown outside of Japan until the first company to introduce and popularize tenkara outside of Japan, Tenkara USA, was founded in April 2009 in San Francisco, California.
Origins.
Tenkara fishing originated in Japan at least 200 years ago. The first reference to tenkara fly-fishing was in 1878 in a book called "Diary of climbing Mt. Tateyama" written by Ernest Mason Satow, an able linguist and British diplomat during the early modernization of Japan. Tenkara fly-fishing originated with professional fishermen in the mountain streams of Japan who found it an effective method of catching the local fish, Yamame, Iwana and Amago. 
Originally the rod was simply a bamboo/cane rod, which was cut and treated, but unlike contemporary western bamboo rods, they were not "manufactured" (i.e. split and glued back together). Unlike in the western fly-fishing tradition where anglers used heavy wooden rods, in Japan anglers always used bamboo, which is readily available and very light. Because of its light weight, Japanese anglers were able to use very long bamboo rods and reach as far as needed without the need to develop reels for the short rods developed in the west.
Equipment.
Tenkara fishing can be seen as a streamlined counterpart to western fly-fishing. The equipment is designed to direct focus to the actual fishing and catching of the fish, not to cause a major preoccupation with the equipment. Only a rod, tenkara line and fly are necessary for tenkara fishing (no reel is used). 
The appeal of tenkara is its elegant simplicity. There are also other advantages of using the long tenkara rods when fishing in mountain streams, primarily the lightness of the line and delicate presentation. A long rod allows for precise placement of the fly on small pools and allows for holding the fly in place on the other side of a current. The other main advantage of using the long tenkara rod is precise control for manipulation of the fly. 
Rod: A very long and flexible rod (usually telescopic) is used in tenkara fishing. The rods normally range from 3.3 to 4.5 meters long (11 ft to 15 ft). These rods were originally made of bamboo, but are nowadays made with carbon and/or fiber glass. They also have a handle similar to fly-fishing rods that can be made of wood (the more prized rods) or cork.
Line: As in fly-fishing, it is the tenkara line that propels the weightless fly forward. In tenkara, the traditional and most commonly used line is a tapered furled line (twisted monofilament), of the same length or slightly shorter than the rod. The main advantage of furled lines is the delicate presentation and ease of casting. Alternatively, a tenkara "level" line can be used. Level lines are specially formulated fluorocarbon adjusted to the desired length. They are easier to cast against the wind. 
The traditional tenkara line has a loop of braided line at its thicker end. This braided line is used to tie the tenkara line directly to the tip of the rod by using a cow hitch (aka: girth hitch) knot. The line at the rod's tip needs to have a stopper knot, which will hold the cow hitch in place. It is a very secure method to attach the line.
Tippet: This is the same as a regular fly-fishing tippet, and is used to connect the fly to the line (which is too thick to tie directly to the fly). Usually between 30 cm to 1 meter of tippet is added to the end of the line. This is typically referred to in Japanese as "hea" (for hair).
Fly: Artificial flies are used in tenkara fly-fishing. These are tied with thread, feathers and sometimes fur as in western fly-fishing. Traditionally a special reverse hackle wet-fly is used. In Japan it is known as ""kebari"". These traditional Japanese flies differ from most Western flies, in that the hackle is tied facing forward.

The Lilacs

The Lilacs were a four-piece rock band from Chicago, formed in Summer 1990 by Ken Kurson, David Levinsky, Tom Whalen and John Packel. Kurson had previously played bass for Green, and after leaving the fold, he and fellow Glenbrook North High School graduate David Levinsky joined together to form the Lilacs, recruiting Tom Whalen on bass and another Glenbrook North alum, John Packel. The name was chosen for the group by Material Issue frontman Jim Ellison, who also produced the first 7" record -- "The Lilacs Love You". 
John Packel left the fold after that release and was replaced by yet another Glenbrook North alum, Arthur Kim. The next record, "The Lilacs Hate You", contained Kurson's syruppy opus "Baby Tells Me," as well as a Levinsky-penned rager called "The Knife."
The group went into Idful Music to record their first full-length CD, The Lilacs Rise Above the Filth. Produced by Brad Wood, who would soon become well known for recording fellow Chicagoan Liz Phair, the CD was met with wide praise and much college radio play. Ira Robbins describe its "Witty, post-adolescent, rock and pop originals" in Trouser Press noting that "the band suffers from a puppy-like incapability to keep its enthusiasm in check, which occasionally leads things astray on the album," but concluding that "the spunky and unpretentious Rise Above the Filth contains attractive examples of Kurson's sprightly '70s-styled youth-pop."
The group's masterpiece, released in 1992 by Dead Dog Records (a play on the fake record label from the television show Wiseguy) was the "Penelope" single, which featured "Have I Told You" and Levinsky's "Pointless."

Bărboi Church

The Bărboi Church (), dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul, is a Romanian Orthodox parish church located at 12 Bărboi Street, Iaşi, Romania.
History.
The current church was raised on the foundation of a church built in 1613-15, dedicated to Saint Paraschiva and commissioned by the "vornic" Ioan Ursu Bărboi. In 1669 this church became a monastery under the authority of Vatopedi monastery on Mount Athos. The church was seriously damaged in 1821 and demolished in 1829. Between 1841 and 1843, the "logofăt" Dimitrie Sturdza and his family members, with financial assistance from Vatopedi and the efforts of Metropolitan Grigore Irinopoleos, had the current church built on the site of the old one. The architect Andrei Caridi was assisted by the Greek master builders Atanasie and Gheorghe. The resulting church resembles certain Athonite buildings in form and dimension, and is the city's only church in the shape of a Greek cross.
The church was shaken by the 1977 earthquake, and from 1980–88, the exterior was restored and the interior paintings and furnishings cleaned. Metropolitan Teoctist Arăpaşu began this project, and on 27 November 1988, by then Patriarch of All Romania, he re-consecrated the church. It is listed in the National Register of Historic Monuments.
Today, in addition to hosting religious services, the church is the headquarters of the local branch of the Romanian Orthodox Women's Society and of the Romanian Orthodox Brotherhood; the latter undertakes philanthropic and cultural activities. Art exhibitions, awards ceremonies, book signings and similar activities take place on the premises. Moreover, every Lazarus Saturday since 1990, thousands of pilgrims have gathered at the church, carrying icons of Christ and making their way toward the Metropolitan Cathedral.
Style.
The church is rectangular in plan and made of valuable stone blocks alternating with rows of brick. To the east, north and south, there are small semicircular apses beneath the top of the walls, flanked by pilasters that rest on bases. The wide central dome, with Neo-Gothic and Romanesque elements, sits above a square base, and is surrounded by four much smaller domes with octagonal bases. The main entrance features an imposing portal held up by eight Doric columns. Above this is a classical facade that also features Doric columns.
The church's spacious Byzantine interior is composed of three naves: a central one and two lateral ones, divided by columns of Carrara marble topped by Corinthian capitals. Looking inside, a harmony of arches can be observed: each pair of columns is linked by two or even four arches in perfect symmetry. The iconostasis is carved from wood and gilt. The walls are covered in paintings of saints (including military ones), Biblical scenes, the Madonna and Child and the Four Evangelists.
An inscribed tablet records various phases in the church's history. Inside is the crypt of the noble Sturdza family (which includes the grave of Prince Ioan Sturdza), bathed in candlelight, next to that the poet Alecu Russo. The Bărboi Church is also where writer Ion Creangă served as deacon and lived in the parish house from 1863-65.
The bell tower, built in 1726-33 by masons from Padua, has four levels; clocks rest in the uppermost one (uniquely for the city) and bells in the middle two. The lowest level has an exterior of quality stone, well worked and preserved; the other levels have a plaster exterior. It is through the lowest level that one enters the church grounds; the gate is made of decorated cast iron. The tower once contained the library of the writer Costache Conachi.
The 19th-century parish house is based on traditional Moldavian monastic houses. It has two floors and a simple plan, with rooms arranged symmetrically about a central hallway. Starting in 1834, it housed Moldavia's first girls' school, founded by Mihail Sturdza.

Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care

The Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC), founded in 1979, is an American organization which accredits ambulatory health care organizations, including ambulatory surgery centers, office-based surgery centers, endoscopy centers, and college student health centers, as well as health plans, such as health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations. AAAHC has been granted "deemed status" to certify ambulatory surgery centers for Medicare by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. In 2009, the AAAHC added the Medical home to the types of organizations that it accredits. It offers on-site surveys for organizations seeking Medical Home accreditation or certification.
The AAAHC survey model is one of cooperation and education. It is unique in offering accreditation surveys that are conducted by professionals who are actively involved in ambulatory care and have first-hand understanding of the specific issues facing the facilities they survey. Surveyors assess how an organization meets prevailing Standards and share their knowledge and experience with others to help ambulatory service providers maintain high standards. AAAHC is one of three organizations that accredits office-based surgery practices, the others being the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations and the American Association for Accreditation of Ambulatory Surgery Facilities.
In 2010, the organization extended its accreditation services internationally, beginning with Costa Rica. The program has since expanded to Peru and further expansion is planned. AAAHC announced the launch of a new accreditation program for hospitals in 2012, which will focus on small hospitals and will be offered through a new entity established by AAAHC, the Accreditation Association for Hospitals/Health Systems Inc. (AAHHS).
AAAHC continuously reviews its standards and revises current standards and adds new standards as required by the constantly changing health care arena. Each year in August there is a public comment period where these revisions and additions are presented for review and comment by interested parties.

History.
The Accreditation Association was formed in 1979 by six member organizations including the American College Health Association, the ASC Association, and the Medical Group Management Association.
The Accreditation Association has 18 Association Members:
Accreditation Process.
Standards are reviewed and updated annually to keep up with current trends and technologies in the health care arena. AAAHC surveyors are volunteers: physicians, dentists, podiatrists, pharmacists, nurses and administrators who are actively involved with ambulatory health care.
AAAHC offers a three year term of accreditation. An organization may also receive a deferral or denial of accreditation if compliance is not met.
Institute for Quality Improvement.
In 1999, the AAAHC founded its non-profit subsidiary, the AAAHC Institute for Quality Improvement (AAAHC Institute) to offer performance measurement opportunities and related quality improvement/educational programs to ambulatory health care organizations. The AAAHC Institute has conducted and published more than 70 studies.

Nakajima LB-2

__NOTOC__
The Nakajima LB-2 was a long-range, land-based bomber developed in Japan for use by the Imperial Japanese Navy. When rejected for military service, the sole prototype was converted into an airliner and, known as the Akatsuki-go (暁号 – "Dawn"), was operated by Manchukuo National Airways.
Development and design.
Kenichi Mitsumara's design was inspired by the Douglas DC-2 that Nakajima was building at the time under licence; a conventional, low-wing cantilever monoplane powered by twin engines. Construction was of metal throughout, and the main units of the tailwheel undercarriage retracted into the engine nacelles. The bomb load was carried in an internal bay.
The prototype LB-2 was completed in March 1936. It was considered for production, along with the Mitsubishi G1M, but eventually both were rejected in favour of the Mitsubishi Ka-15, which would be produced as the G3M. Adapted for civil use, the LB-2 prototype's bomb bay was replaced with a fuel tank and a cabin for six passengers was fitted, with the bombardier's position in the nose was converted to store luggage.
Operational history.
The converted LB-2, now named "Akatsuki-go", was delivered to Manchukuo National Airways in 1937, with it (and two Heinkel He 116s) intended to operate a service to the Soviet Union over the Tian Shan mountains. The outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War and the undeclared Soviet–Japanese Border Wars which culminated in the Battle of Khalkhin Gol stopped these plans, however, and the "Akatsuki-go" was scrapped at Shenyang in 1941.

Jay Ahern

The globetrotting Jay Ahern (a.k.a. Add Noise, Cheap and Deep, Hauntologists) has spent the past two decades floating under the surface as a quintessential producer’s producer. While in Dublin, Ireland, the techno artist started the Aquarhythms and Hydroelectric labels, releasing mixes by Carl Craig, Morgan Geist, and Deep Dish as well as works under his own monikers to keep the deep beats rolling. By the late ‘90s, a number of those early singles became cult classics and were reissued on the Astralwerks and Phono labels. In 2003 Ahern launched the Earsugar label, which saw releases by Stefan Schneider, Gudrun Gut, Thomas Fehlmann, Brendon Moeller, Hauschka, Dirk Dresselhaus and many others. Also in 2003, Ahern's Add Noise production moniker came into existence. By 2006, he had relocated to Berlin, Germany and began releasing on the Hard Wax-distributed Handwerk label, thus furthering his reputation as Add Noise. His Cheap and Deep incarnation was born in 2009, while Ahern worked at Hard Wax.
Berlin proved to be fertile ground for collaborations with Ahern embarking on both live and studio projects with Stefan Schneider (Mapstation, To Rococo Rot) as Hauntologists, Robert Henke (Monolake) as Termulator X, Henrik Jonsson (Gunnar Jonsson, Jonsson/Alter) as Kvadratklang and Adam Marshall (New Kanada) as Étapes. In 2010, Ahern relocated to the US with his family to care for his father and, after settling in Colorado, the following year saw studio sessions and new live collaborations with US-based artists including Jonah Sharp (Spacetime Continuum, Reagenz) and Morgan Packard (Anticipate Recordings, Thicket). Ahern also has ten years of music industry experience, outside of his own labels/projects, with past and present professional positions in marketing, distribution and label management at Beatport, Hard Wax, Domino Records, PIAS, and V2.
Modular Cowboy, the US-based electronic music label started by Jay Ahern in 2012, focuses on deep club tracks, live improvisational works and music apps that share the label’s creative vision of performance-based sound design and strong visual aesthetics with the end-user. Modular Cowboy also maintains strong ties to the electronic music scene in Berlin, as Ahern is a transplant from that city. The label is an exclusive outlet for Ahern to release his collaborations with artists such as Morgan Packard and commission remixes from inspirational producers such as Berghain resident DJ Norman Nodge and exciting new talent such as Jonsson/Alter. In addition to traditional releases, Modular Cowboy will also release sample packs and other tools for DJs and producers. The label’s strong visual aesthetic is courtesy of designer Maike Verloh. Berlin-based Hard Wax is the official distributor for Modular Cowboy releases. This is dance music that reverberates with the past, the present AND future while celebrating collaboration, performance and a physical relationship with sound.
"My goal with the new Modular Cowboy label is to look to the future without losing the sensory experiences of the past," says Ahern, "To provide opportunities for both pure enjoyment as well as active performance of music."
Links –
Jay Ahern was also an Irish radio presenter with RTÉ 2fm. He left the station in 2003 and was replaced by Dan Hegarty. He was amongst the industry professionals who were outspoken about the loss of the music television programme, "No Disco", just before his own departure from the radio in 2003.

Panther Model 120

The Panther Model 120 was a British motorcycle made between 1959 and 1966 by Phelon & Moore. An enlarged Panther Model 100, the 120 had a reputation for being less reliable with a tendency for rapid clutch wear, problematical roller bearings and heavy oil consumption. As competitors produced modern designs, Panther ran into trouble obtaining supplies of Burman gearboxes and Lucas Magdynos, so production ceased in 1966 and the company was wound up.
Development.
The Panther sloper engine designed by Granville Bradshaw remained unchanged for 25 years and the 650 cc 'heavyweight' had many of the Model 100 components. The increased capacity was achieved by boring out the Model 100 cylinder by 1 mm and increasing the stroke by 6 mm. As well as increased low speed torque this improved acceleration and top end cruising speed.
This put additional strain on the main bearings and crankcases, leading to reliability problems. The 120 also suffered with lubrication problems from the large sump cast into the front of the engine. Oil was pumped to the top of the sloper engine but return was erratic and oil consumption very heavy. The main shaft was redesigned with larger ball journal main bearings, A smaller exhaust valve combined with a larger Amal monobloc carburettor gave the Model 120 28 bhp at 4500 rpm, an increase of 4 bhp over the Model 100. 
Motorcycle sidecars were popular at the end of the 1950s, so the Model 120 was provided with a purpose built sidecar chassis, connected by a three point mounting which provided minimal alignment problems. The sidecar wheel was interchangeable with the motorcycle wheels and had swinging arm suspension with an Armstrong shock absorber. A trailer with a towbar was also provided as an option.
The end.
By 1962 Phelon & Moore were in financial trouble and went into receivership. The Model 120 stayed in production for as long as the supply of spare parts lasted, but they finally ran out in 1966 and the company folded. It wasn't quite the end for the big Panther, however, as they were cheap and economical and continued to sell for another year after production ended. Panther Model 120's are still being maintained and used regularly to this day by enthusiasts.

Othello (video game)

Gameplay.
The board game was created before television was invented. It is played with two-sided (black and white) chips, also called discs, on a board. The player can choose between black or white chips. Games are either player versus computer or player versus player. The goal is to end the game with as many chips showing your color as possible. To do this, players must sandwich their opponents' chip(s) between a piece of their own color already on the board, and the piece being played. The game has four skill levels when playing the computer, as well as a hidden fifth level if you beat the computer on level four.
There is supposedly a slot machine game that is revealed when pressing Select + A at the main menu screen (the word slot will appear atop the screen and the game is said to start after you complete a two player game), but some users have reported that nothing happens after the word "slot" shows up.

St Nicolas' Church, Kings Norton

St Nicolas's Church, Kings Norton is the Anglican parish church of Kings Norton, in the Diocese of Birmingham, West Midlands, United Kingdom.
History.
A church has been located on this site as early as the 11th century when the Normans built a small, rectangular chapel. It is not known if this was the result of a rebuild of a previous church. A church on this site has been recorded in documents since 1213. The current St Nicolas's Church dates from the early 13th century, and the spire was constructed between 1446 and 1475. The Norman building was demolished in the 14th century when a new nave, both aisles and the chancel arch were constructed. In the 17th century, almost the whole of the south aisle was re-built, the chancel was re-roofed and the low pitched roof that covered the nave from the 15th century was replaced by a much steeper version. Both north aisle and south aisle were given four separate, high pitched roofs set side-by-side. A parish was assigned to the church in 1846.
The church was restored in 1863 by Ewan Christian and again in 1871 by W. J. Hopkins. It is a Grade I listed building.
The Revd W. V. Awdry, author of "The Railway Series" including "Thomas the Tank Engine" was a curate from 1940 to 1946. The church stands next to the historic buildings of Saracen's Head, recently restored and named Saint Nicolas Place.
Churchyard.
The churchyard, which has been extended to the west and (across a private road) to the north, contains war graves of eleven service personnel of World War I and seven of World War II.
Bells.
The church has ten bells with a tenor weight of . The ringing chamber is accessed via a wooden staircase of 54 steps.
There is a poem "The New Bell Wake" about these bells.
Organ.
Parts of the organ date from 1857 by J. Halmshaw, but it has been expanded and restored several times since. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

Royal Cortissoz

Royal Cortissoz (10 February 1869 – 17 October 1948, last name pronounced "Kor-tee-zus") was an American art historian and long-time art critic for the "New York Herald Tribune" from 1891 until his death. During his tenure, he consistently championed traditionalism and decried modernism. Of the latter, he once wrote, "It will someday prove a kind of Victorian 'dud,' with a difference, obviously, but a 'dud' just the same."
Early life.
Cortissoz was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Francisco Emmanuel Cortissoz, an Englishman of Spanish descent, and Julia da Costa Mauri, from Martinique. He trained as an architect, spending six years working at the firm of McKim, Mead, and White, starting at the age of 16, before joining the staff of the "Commercial Advertiser". In 1891, he joined the staff of the "New York Tribune", writing on culture, and eventually became the art editor. He had been interested in art as a young child, but never formally studied or practiced it, instead having skill with words, thus leading to career as an art critic, in his own words, "by spontaneous combustion". However, the hectic life of a journalist and the pressure of trying to establish the "Tribune" as a cultural leader led to a mental breakdown, or neurasthenia as he was diagnosed. Although he soon recovered after a trip around Cape Horn, he suffered from anxiety and psychosomatic ailments for the remainder of his life.
Work as a critic.
As a critic, he saw his role to be one who fosters an appreciation of art in the common man, and not just paintings. He wrote extensively about jewelry, rare book designs, architecture, furniture, and interior design. He considered art as a whole to be central to society's well-being. He also frequently remarked that beauty could be found anywhere. Cortissoz was so influential that his praise was eagerly sought by artists, and the organizers of the landmark 1913 Armory Show were worried about what he might think.
Cortissoz argued against modernism on both technical and cultural grounds. He found abstract art to be ugly and rejected modernism's idea that the work did not have to represent reality. He also detested modernists' tendency to be dismissive of the past and of those who disliked their work. This attitude, Cortissoz felt, would cause people to associate art with the irrational and bizarre and thus lose interest. Over the years, Cortissoz criticized in this manner Cubism, German Expressionism, Dada, Surrealism, and abstract expressionism. He felt artists attached to these movements, such as Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Vincent van Gogh, and Piet Mondrian were egotists. In 1927, he wrote, "Sooner or later these silly egotists will go to the scrap heap. But in the meantime they are ruining the younger generation." He did, however, have praise for American modernists who used traditional techniques, such as Arthur B. Davies, Guy Pène du Bois, and Georgia O'Keeffe.
Personal life.
In 1897, he married Ellen MacKay Hutchinson, a literary editor at the "Tribune". She died in August 1933, and the couple had no children. Cortissoz died of a heart ailment in Manhattan.

IBM WebSphere Commerce

IBM WebSphere Commerce AKA WCS (WebSphere Commerce Suite) is a software platform framework for e-commerce, including marketing, sales, customer and order processing functionality in a tailorable, integrated package. It is a single, unified platform which offers the ability to do business directly with consumers (B2C), with businesses (B2B), indirectly through channel partners (indirect business models), or all of these simultaneously. WebSphere Commerce is a customizable, scalable and high availability solution built on the Java - Java EE platform using open standards, such as XML, and Web services.
Versions.
It all started back in 1996, with a product called Net.Commerce (V1.0, V2.0, V3.1, and V3.2). In 2001 Net.Commerce was renamed to WebSphere Commerce Suite, releasing versions V4.1 and V5.1. In 2002 WebSphere Commerce V5.4 was released, followed by V5.5 in 2003, V5.6 in 2004 and V5.6.1 in 2005. The latest major release versions are:
There are three editions of WebSphere Commerce software. Each edition provides an increasing set of functionality in comparison:
Since WebSphere Commerce is a highly customizable solution, IBM provides an integrated development environment which is used to build and test customizations, extend business logic, change the look and feel of the store and tools, and create a new logic to meet business requirements. The developer platform used for developing and customizing the solution is called IBM WebSphere Commerce Developer. So there are also 3 editions of the developer environment, matching their runtime environments (e.g. WebSphere Commerce Developer Express, WebSphere Commerce Developer Professional, and WebSphere Commerce Developer Enterprise). 
As with other IBM products that are also customizable, WebSphere Commerce Developer toolkit runs within IBM Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software (RAD) as the foundation of Java IDE, and RAD extends Eclipse environment with visual and other development features. 
A specific WebSphere Commerce version uses a specific version of RAD, for example:
Migration.
Migrating to a new version of WebSphere Commerce is done by WebSphere Commerce Migration Wizard, an interactive wizard that guides the user through each phase of the migration process, performing various tasks.

Waitaha Penguin

The Waitaha Penguin ("Megadyptes waitaha") is an extinct species of New Zealand penguin discovered in November 2008. 
The new species was discovered by University of Otago and University of Adelaide scientists comparing the foot bones of 500-year-old, 100-year-old and modern specimens of penguins. They initially believed all belonged to the Yellow-eyed Penguin ("Megadyptes antipodes"), a species that has been threatened since human settlement. However, the 500-year-old subfossil bones yielded different DNA. According to lead researcher Sanne Boessenkool, Waitaha Penguins "were around 10% smaller than the Yellow-eyed Penguin. The two species are very closely related, but we can't say if they had a yellow crown." "Our findings demonstrate that yellow-eyed penguins on mainland New Zealand are not a declining remnant of a previous abundant population, but came from the subantarctic relatively recently and replaced the extinct Waitaha Penguin," said team member Dr Jeremy Austin, deputy director of the Australasian Centre for Ancient DNA.
As the local Māori people have no record of this different species, it is estimated to have perished between c. 1300 and 1500, soon after Polynesian settlers arrived in New Zealand. While it is currently unclear precisely how the species became extinct, Boessenkool says they were probably eaten by the settlers. "The fact we find these bones in archaeological sites, villages or settlements, suggests hunting played a role. The birds were an easy target, easy to take and there were never very many of them." After their extinction, their range was occupied by Yellow-eyed Penguins, previously most abundant in the sub-Antarctic islands further south. The decrease in sea lion populations after human settlement may also have eased their expansion. Another coauthor, Dr Phil Seddon, said "these unexpected results highlight ... the dynamic nature of ecosystem change, where the loss of one species may open up opportunities for the expansion of another." The report was published in the scientific journal "Proceedings of the Royal Society B".
The penguin was named for the Māori iwi (tribe), the Waitaha, whose tribal lands included the areas the Waitaha Penguin are thought to have inhabited.

J. Gordon Coogler

J. Gordon Coogler (1865–1901), or John Brown Gordon Coogler, was an American poet who achieved notoriety during his lifetime as a prolific producer of bad verse. Although his work does not rank with the masters, much of it has a simple, endearing quality. Essayist H.L. Mencken is credited with assuring Coogler's lasting fame as a poetaster by mocking him as an example of the supposedly poor state of arts and letters in the American South. One must read the bulk of his work to appreciate the effort of this self taught versifier. He died on September 9, 1901.
Life.
Coogler was born in the midlands of South Carolina on December 3, 1865, and seldom left the state. After his father's death on January 8, 1878, Coogler was only 12 years old. After finishing his schooling, he went to work as an apprentice printer with Rev. Sidi Browne at the "Christian Neighbor" to support his mother and two sisters. The family lived in Columbia after 1880 at 1818 Marion Street. He opened a job printing shop advertising "Poems Written While You Wait," first at 1226 Lady Street and later at 1402 Main Street. Although his verses attracted both praise and ridicule, he sought to promote his business by distributing self-published booklets of original poems. According to his obituary in the "Columbia State" newspaper, Coogler published five thousand short collections of original verse during his lifetime, besides two versions of his book-length collection titled "Purely Original Verse". His last printing contained a 1901 supplement.
Coogler's verse attracted mocking attention from prominent American magazines, including "Puck" and "Munsey's Magazine". Coogler once complained in verse about what he considered the unfairness of literary critics: 
Oh you critics! — If an author errs in a single line,
That line you’ll surely quote,
And will give it as a sample fair
Of all he ever wrote.
Legacy.
Nearly two decades after Coogler's death, H.L. Mencken selected the following brief poem as the motto of his 1920 essay "The Sahara of the Bozart": 
Alas! for the South, her books have grown fewer—
She never was much given to literature.
Mencken went on to mock southern literature by crowning Coogler as "the last bard of Dixie."
From the 1890s into the 20th century, newspapers had quoted that unintentionally humorous couplet, often from memory and in garbled form. Little else about Coogler was remembered besides the one couplet and his identity as a southerner.
"Purely Original Verse" was reprinted in 1974 by Vogue Press of Columbia, South Carolina. 
The town of Blythewood, South Carolina held a "Coogler Festival" in the poet's honor in November 1983.
In 1985, Irene LaBorde Neuffer published "Coogler Revisited", a book devoted to the poet. 
In the late 20th century conservative political commentator Emmett Tyrrell invented the annual J. Gordon Coogler Award as a booby prize for the "worst book of the year." The announcement of the prize has appeared annually in conservative organs including "Human Events" and "The American Spectator". According to literary critic Bryan Giemza, other "mock-serious Coogler societies" exist and grant awards for bad writing.
The personal papers of J. Gordon Coogler are housed at the University of South Carolina.

Public Credit Act of 1869

The Public Credit Act of 1869 in the USA states that bondholders who purchased bonds to help finance the Civil War (1861 – 1865) would be paid back in gold. The act was signed on March 18, 1869, and was mainly supported by the Republican Party, notably Senator John Sherman. The measure is significant because it was a step to help alleviate the financial struggles faced by the United States after the Civil War. The U.S. was already indebted before the war and the issuing of greenbacks to keep currency circulating during the war increased the indebtedness significantly. The country had no central bank or monetary policy at the time and was desperate to improve its position to maintain itself as a global economic leader. The U.S. was torn whether it should operate on a greenback, gold, or bimetallic standard. The passing of the Public Credit Act of 1869 is an early indicator that the country was moving toward reinstating the gold standard for economic and political reasons. In effect, however, the intent of the Public Credit Act was never fully realized.
Background.
Prior to the Civil War, the U.S. operated on a gold standard in practice. Bank notes were legal tender issued by state banks which could be exchanged for an amount of gold at any bank. Both gold and bank notes circulated as mediums of exchange. On February 25, 1862, the U.S. passed the First Legal Tender Act to help finance the Civil War. The act changed the economy to a fiduciary standard based on a fiat currency called United States Notes, or more popularly called greenbacks. Unlike bank notes, greenbacks were not backed by any sort of metallic standard and acted almost like a “loan without interest” (Mitchell, 404). Greenbacks were issued as an immediate, short-term relief for the country’s growing demand for currency. The issuance of greenbacks and the sale of government bonds to finance the war were led by the Secretary of the Treasury at the time, Salmon P. Chase (Geisst, 53-54). Until 1879, gold, bank notes, and greenbacks were used as mediums of exchange and had free floating exchange rates.
After the Civil War, people were torn between whether to keep the greenback standard or to revert to the gold standard. There are economic and political reasons why and when the U.S. chose to reinstate the gold standard. During the Civil War, the U.S. experienced a strong period of inflation. The price level in the U.S. almost doubled between 1861 and 1865 and this had harmful implications on the exchange rate. Inflation increased the exchange rate with England, making the price of British pounds more expensive. If the pre-war gold standard was put in place during this inflationary period, people would cash out their U.S. currency for gold to buy British goods. The flow of gold out of the country would slow the economy and lead to unemployment (Walton & Rockoff, 244). If the gold standard was to be reinstated, it should be done when the price level and exchange rate dropped to the pre-war level so that the U.S. would not have to pay a premium or suffer economic hardship to convert back to the gold standard.
Some Republicans pushed for a gold standard early on. They believed that creditors who supported the war should be paid back in gold, the way they were expected to be paid back. The Republicans also believed that the government should not be in charge of managing currency and that the gold standard did not allow government to intervene in the economy. It was thought by all that the gold standard would also be a good move from an international perspective – the U.S. would appear stable and its system would be compatible to its major trading partner, England, who also operated on a gold standard.
Consequences.
Over time the price level and exchange rate began to fall. Congress decided on a severe monetary contraction to lower the price level so they could reinstate the gold standard during the Contraction Act of 1865 before easing the policy in 1868. The passing of the Public Credit Act of 1869 was the first definitive piece of legislation that indicated that the U.S. was moving toward officially reinstating a gold standard. However, the act was written in general terms and was ultimately considered to be ineffective. No explicit dates, people or actions were ever announced to pay back the bondholders in gold. The U.S. did not officially operate on the gold standard until the Resumption Act of 1875.

Abomination (novel)

Abomination (1998) is a novel by the author Robert Swindells, dealing with themes of Religious extremism, Adolescence, Bullying, and relationships, as well as integrating the intriguing question of what its title refers to.
Plot.
Martha is a 12 year old girl. She leads a life that is anything but too normal or not so normal compared to the others. Martha and her parents belong to a strict religious group called the Righteous.(In Christianity) The Righteous is a religion that believes in the God that was portrayed in the Old Testament, the God who killed, the God who brought disease. Martha hates this religion. Because of its rules Martha is not allowed any trendy clothes, no television and no computer or any other fancy gadgets...and worst of all no friends. Martha wants to have all of these things but she cannot. Martha lives with homemade clothes for school and for home, never had junk food in her life or any other modern stuff. Her school life is worse than her home life. She is chased home every night by Simon Pritchard (the school bully) and his gang. While they chase her they are all chanting "Raggedy-Ann, Raggedy-Ann we'll scrag you if we can". The only electrical item she owns is a radio, which she is not allowed to listen to. Their religion has this prohibited. Her parents follow the strict religion. Because Martha has none of these privileges, she has no friends. She used to get invited by the righteous kids but she and her family were against calling them to their table.
However, Martha's luck changes when a new boy Scott arrives and smiles at her, which in Martha's case is a huge hope that they could be friends. Because of a simple gesture of lending her a ruler, a big friendship is born. But to Martha's disappointment she is chased home by him with Simon and the rest of his gang. Later on though, Scott sees Martha looking in her bag for something. He asked her what she is looking for, she tells him she has forgotten her ruler. Scott lends Martha his ruler but when he gets it back one of Simon's gang tells him that he should burn it but he ignores her. As Scott becomes closer to Martha, his best friend Simon starts to notice, so he starts bullying Scott as well as Martha. Scott's and Martha's relationship grows stronger and Martha eventually has the courage to tell Scott about abomination, her nephew.(JIM) Scott was shocked when he heard this, and asked her to tell in detail. Scott accuses Mary that she shouldn’t have done this to her son. Martha seems and tells him that Mary didn't know this. She was told by her parents that the child would be adopted. However, this did not happen the child was sent into the cellar and treated like an animal, like Martha.(her parents had child abuse * 2, Martha and her nephew, Jim) Her parents did not even give him a proper name and called it abomination till now. Mary was kicked out of her house because she had a child before marriage. Martha also revels to Scott about her father giving the rod.
However, upon her discovery of her family's moving, Martha rebels against it, and is sent to her room for days. However, she manages to send Scott a message, not to Scott himself, but pinned to a fence outside her house, taking a large risk of being caught by her parents. The note tells Scott not to knock, but instead to wait for Mary until Monday. She waits for days but without reply.
At the same time, Scott actually receives a reply, however Mary calls him sick. Scott decides to talk like Martha would; mentioning the way Mary calls Martha "Marfa", like her best friend Annette, and mentions a fountain in Birmingham, where her last postcard was sent from. Scott tries calling, however he knew Martha's father would not listen, so he repeats the same message three times so that her father would memorize it and angrily shouts it in front of Martha, knowing the message is from Scott. Eventually Scott decides to go to see Martha, but is discouraged when he sees Martha in a car; however it was Mary and Annette's car - Mary rescued Abomination, her son after all.
In the last chapter it is revealed that the child is now called Jim and that Martha actually buys her own clothes now; it is also stated that when she learns to use the Internet, as Annette promises her that she'll teach her she will e-mail Scott.

The Currency Act of 1870 (41st Congress, Sess. 2, ch. 252, , enacted July 12, 1870) maintained greenbacks issued during the American Civil War at their existing level, about $356 million, neither contracting them nor issuing more. It replaced $45 million in "temporary loan certificates," paper bearing 3% interest but which circulated as currency, with the same amount of national bank notes issued by newly chartered banks. While achieving currency stabilization, the act answered midwestern pressure for more currency, and midwestern dissatisfaction with the concentration of national bank charters in the Northeast.

Greenback Republicans could console themselves that the bill did not contemplate replacing greenbacks with national bank notes.

Gareth O'Callaghan

Gareth O'Callaghan is an Irish author, radio presenter and former television presenter. He can currently be heard on 4fm, having presented shows on RTÉ 2fm for much of his career until 2005 and then a show on Galway Bay FM.
O'Callaghan is an outspoken supporter of suicide and depression-related topics, having had previous personal experience of these throughout his adult life. He has written books dealing with such topics, and is a supporter of the Irish suicide charity Console, representing them in Dáil Éireann debates on at least one occasion. O'Callaghan is a qualified clinical psychotherapist.
In 2010, O'Callaghan spoke out against cocaine use following the death of Gerry Ryan, a former colleague and friend. He acknowledged that he had known of Ryan's cocaine use for 16 years and received criticism and intimidation after speaking about this in public.
Career.
Radio.
O'Callaghan started with small pirates such as Radio Dublin. He then was a presenter on "superpirate" Radio Nova in the early 1980s, followed by Sunshine Radio (briefly), later Energy 103FM and Q102 (briefly). He spent a few years on UK radio, after his spell with Sunshine Radio in 1983, starting with offshore pirate Radio Caroline. After Q102, Gareth joined legal Irish radio with Millennium Radio and then in 1989 he moved to the newly relaunched "2fm" - an attempt by RTÉ to steal some of the thunder of the recently departed Superpirates.
Gareth then presented the very popular "Gareth O'Callaghan in the afternoon" show which was similar in theme, tone and content to The Steve Wright in the afternoon show on BBC Radio 1 of the late '80s and early '90s.This show was a huge success gaining O'Callaghan widespread popularity all over Ireland by offering a brand and style of commercial radio that was more reminiscent of Radio Nova in Dublin at the very height of its popularity.
He developed a great raport with John Kenny who was the sports presenter on the show and the pair regularly did inserts together on his afternoon show
O'Callaghan left RTÉ 2fm's afternoon show, having previously presented the breakfast show on the station (replacing Ian Dempsey). His afternoon slot is now occupied by Rick O'Shea's eponymously named show. After leaving 2fm, Gareth took some time out from radio to pursue a career in psychology before being named presenter of the breakfast show on Galway Bay FM. On 27 February 2009 Gareth launched Ireland's newest commercial independent Quasi-national radio station 4fm where he was the morning show host before moving to the afternoon slot.
Before Gay Byrne's retirement from "The Gay Byrne Show" in 1998, he was helped a bit by O'Callaghan but O'Callaghan left him after getting fed up and went to RTÉ 2fm instead. Des Cahill had to help Byrne after that.
Television.

Potential of mean force

General description.
The PMF is a type of experiment which can be done in Monte Carlo or Molecular Dynamics simulations which examines how a system's energy changes as a function of some specific reaction coordinate parameter. For example, it may examine how the system's energy changes as a function of the distance between two residues, or as a protein is pulled through a lipid bilayer. Often PMF experiments are used in conjunction with umbrella sampling because typically the PMF experiment will fail to adequately sample the system space as it proceeds.
Mathematical description.
The Potential of Mean Force of a system with N molecules is strictly the potential that gives the average force over all the configurations of all the n+1...N molecules acting on a particle "j" at any fixed configuration keeping fixed a set of molecules 1...n
Above, formula_2 is the averaged force, i.e. "mean force". And formula_3 is the so-called potential of the mean force. For formula_4, formula_5 is the average work needed to bring the two particles from infinite separation to a distance formula_6.

John Green (footballer)

John Green (22 May 1939 – 15 August 2010) was an English professional footballer who played as a midfielder. He played a total of 250 league games in the Football League.
He moved from non-league Stockton Heath to Tranmere Rovers in February 1958. He played 21 league games before he was transferred to top-flight Blackpool in March 1959. He went on make 145 appearances for the club, before he was signed by Stanley Matthews' Port Vale in September 1967. He was allowed to spend summer 1968 in Canada with Vancouver Royals, who were then coached by Ferenc Puskás. He returned to help Vale to win promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1969–70, and was also named as the club's Player of the Year. He later served as player-manager of Northwich Victoria in 1971–72.
Playing career.
Tranmere Rovers.
John Green was born and grew up near to Warrington, like his lifelong friend Roger Hunt; both played as amateurs for Stockton Heath before becoming professional footballers. Green began his professional career with Tranmere Rovers, signing in February 1958, with the club in the Third Division North. At the end of the 1957–58 season the Third Division North and South were dissolved and replaced by the Third Division and the Fourth Division. Tranmere were allowed to join the new Third Division having finished in the top twelve in 1957–58 – they finished ahead of thirteenth place York City on goal average.
Green played 21 games and scoring a total of 7 goals, before his transfer to Blackpool in March 1959.
Blackpool.
National Service from August 1959 to August 1961 limited his appearances in his first couple of seasons as a Blackpool player. Green made his debut for Ron Suart's Blackpool on 5 March 1960, in a 4–2 victory at Leeds United. Green went on to make a further six appearances in the 1959–60 campaign. The following season, 1960–61, Green made just one league appearance, on 8 October 1960, as Suart rang the changes following a single-goal defeat at Preston North End in the West Lancashire derby in the previous outing.
In 1961–62, Green made nine league appearances. He also scored his first goals for the club. The first came on 14 April 1962, in a 3–2 defeat at Sheffield Wednesday. A second followed seven days later, this time in a 3–1 victory over Manchester City at Bloomfield Road. Green also made two appearances for the club in the League Cup: firstly in their third-round tie at Workington on 5 November, his strike being the only goal of the game; and secondly in their semi-final second leg game at home to Norwich City on 16 April 1962, which proved to be their elimination match.
Green made twelve league appearances in 1962–63, scoring one goal in the process. It was during the 1963–64 season that Suart gave Green an extended run in the team. He made 23 appearances and scored two goals. In 1964–65, though, he was ever-present throughout Blackpool's 42 league games. He also scored twice. Green returned to being a rotation player in 1965–66, making 26 appearances.
For 1966–67, Green's final season with the club, the midfielder became one of two Greens in the team, after the arrival of Tony Green, a Scot, from Newcastle United. The Englishman made fifteen league appearances, a third of which occurred under new manager Stan Mortensen. Green's final appearance for the club took place in the penultimate league game of the season, a 3–1 defeat at home to West Bromwich Albion on 6 May 1967. After maintaining a First Division status during Green's eight seasons with the club, Blackpool were relegated to the Second Division at the end of the campaign.
Green had played a total of 145 league and cup games for Blackpool, scoring a total of 11 goals in all competitions.
Port Vale.
In September 1967, Green was signed for Fourth Division Port Vale by Stanley Matthews, who Green had admired from childhood and alongside whom he had played towards the end of Matthews' playing career with Blackpool. He made a 'superb' start to his Vale career, and was seen as one of the club's most skilful players. However he soon lost his first team place, and made just eleven appearances in 1967–68.
Green then spent May to October 1968 with Vancouver Royals. Although Green was originally recruited by Bobby Robson, by the time he joined Vancouver Royals, Robson had been replaced as coach by Ferenc Puskás, who made Green captain for his season with the Canadian club. The Royals struggled in the North American Soccer League, and finished bottom of the Pacific Division.
Returning to Vale Park for the rest of the 1968–69 campaign, he found himself working under a new manager in Gordon Lee. Green struggled with his fitness but played twelve games, finding himself on the scoresheet in home wins against Newport County and Chester. He then helped the club to win promotion in 1969–70, and was an ever-present with 46 league and 6 cup appearances. He was given the club's Player of the Year award for his contribution to the campaign. However he could not translate this success over to the 1970–71 Third Division campaign, and new signings Brian Horton and Tony Lacey established themselves in the first eleven. He was not offered a new contract at the end of the season.
Green had played a total of 98 league and cup games for Port Vale, scoring a total of 9 goals in all competitions.
Later career.
Green rounded off his career in professional football as player-manager of Northern Premier League side Northwich Victoria for the latter part of the 1971–72 season.

La Salle Expeditions

The Expeditions of René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle were a series of trips into the Mississippi and Ohio Valley by French explorers led by René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle that began in the late 1660s and continued for two decades. Much of the area that was explored was land that no European had ever ventured into. The expeditions led to the establishment of an overland trade route connecting French colonies in Canada with French colonies in Louisiana. All of the land covered in the expedition was claimed on behalf of Louis XIV, King of France, and initiated a period of French control in the region that would last for nearly a century.
Early expeditions.
Background.
René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle arrived in New France in 1666. He was the son of a wealthy merchant family from Rouen, France and came to the New World to set up trade with Native American populations. He went immediately to Montreal, which was then the furthest inland post the French controlled. At that time, the post was little more than a mission where his brother served as a Jesuit priest who was working to convert the local Huron to Christianity. At that time, the region was in the height of the Beaver Wars, a brutal conflict between the French-backed Algonquian tribes fighting against the English supported Iroquois Confederacy.
La Salle purchased a large tract of land near modern Lachine, Quebec. There he set up a thriving trading post, purchasing furs from the local tribes and serving as a middleman, selling the furs to European merchants who transported them back to France. From Seneca traders, La Salle first learned of the Ohio country and that a river flowed from there all the way to a great sea. The possibility of such a river intrigued La Salle because of its obvious value to trade. If such a route existed, it would make trading trips deep into the interior of North America possible and considerably more easy than overland routes. If discovered, the trade from such a route could also be very lucrative. At the time, most Salvadoraños, having no clear idea of the actual size of North America west of the Appalachians, still thought that they were very near the source of the Asian spices, and La Salle thought that perhaps this route would lead to India. /.\
First expedition.
On July 6, 1681, La Salle set out with his first expedition to explore the region he had heard of. He put together a group of twenty-four men and canoes and set off up the St. Lawrence River and into Lake Ontario. After thirty-five days they reached the mouth of the Seneca River on the south shore of Lake Ontario. A Seneca village was located there, but they discouraged him from continuing his expedition westward and told him his presence in the Ohio Country would be unwelcome. Despite their warning and refusal to provide a guide, he continued towards the Niagara River where he encountered a group of Seneca returning to their territory with a Pottawatomie prisoner captured in a raid. He paid a ransom for the captive after he agreed to lead the explorers into the Ohio Country. The actual routes of La Salles' early expeditions are not geographically known, it reported from second hand descriptions.
From there the party continued westward overland reaching Lake Erie where they turned toward the south. If Lasalle struck Lake Erie near present day Erie, PA, The party would have been west of the Allegheny range. They continued moving overland until they reached a branch of the Ohio River which they canoed down to reach the main channel of the river. One possible route would have been up the Grand River, and then a short expedition over the established portage trail to the Mahoning River. Upon reaching the Ohio, in the area of modern western Pennsylvania, it would have been obvious that the expedition had reached a major river, rivaling the size of the largest European rivers. La Salle continued downstream and westward reaching the Falls of the Ohio near modern Louisville, Kentucky. There his men refused to go further and deserted him to return to Canada. La Salle continued to explore only briefly on his own, and returned to Canada on his own.
During his trip, his group became the first Europeans to see the Ohio River. He had also traveled further into the Ohio country than any previous expeditions. Despite his lack of success in finding the "southern sea", what he did find only intrigued him more and he soon decided that he wanted to launch a second attempt to find the outlet of the river.
Second expedition.
In 1670 La Salle set out on another expedition. He led a group of men west across Lake Erie and then overland ending up at the southern tip of Lake Michigan. Although reports from the expedition do not indicate, it would have been obvious that the Great Lakes represented a vast freshwater sea. From Lake Michigan, the party moved south across Illinois and encountered the Mississippi River. From the first expedition, La Salle would have known that the position on the Mississippi was far north of the Ohio. He likely deduced that both rivers flowed South to the river reported by De Soto. 
It was not until 1673 that Louis Jolliet and Père Father Jacques Marquette explored the upper Mississippi Valley, including the area where it was joined by the Ohio River. La Salle later participated in an expedition to follow the northern shore of Lake Erie across Lake Huron to Michilimackinac, where Lake Michigan empties into Lake Huron. La Salle named the entire area of the Mississippi watershed Louisiana after king Louis XIV of France.
La Salle later followed up the discovery and sailed down the river all the way to the Gulf of Mexico. His trip made him the first European to travel the length of the Mississippi, but it had been visited by Europeans at its southern end possibly as early as the voyages of Christopher Columbus, and its midsection by Hernando De Soto a century earlier.
La Salle did not lead another expedition for seven years, but he never forgot the rivers and continued to form plans for more expeditions. The land he discovered was all claimed in the name of Louis XIV and added to New France. The French Crown expanded on his exploration by claiming the entire Mississippi River Watershed|Mississippi River Basin, and New Orleans was later created to control the southern end of the river.
Later expeditions.
Third expedition.
In the late 17th century, La Salle began the process of expanding and securing the fur trade by building series of forts and a line of communications from Montreal into the upper Great Lakes and into the Ohio Valley and Mississippi regions. In 1673 he built Fort Frontenac at Cataraqui (now Kingston) on Lake Ontario. In 1679 he built Fort Conti at the mouth of the Niagara River on Lake Ontario. Near the fort he constructed a sailing ship he named "Le Griffon" and used it to explore much of the Great Lakes.as far as modern Green Bay, Wisconsin in the following summer where he set up a trading post. Thelocked in the Beaver Wars and this new route over the lakes allowed the French to bypass the dangerous countryside and trade with the tribes beyond the front lines of the war. While he remained at the post, he sent two men with an Indian guide westward in search of the Mississippi River. Two men eventually located the Falls of St. Anthony before returning.
In September 1679 he began the return trip to Niagara but stopped at the mouth of the St. Joseph River on the east shore of Lake Michigan. They paddled upstream and there they built a small fort to serve as a base of operations for continued expeditions into the Illinois and Ohio Country. There they waited for supplies and men which were traveling overland to meet them. He sent the Griffon and crew back to Montreal, but they never arrived and were believed to have died on the return journey.
On December 3, 1679 a party of twenty-men started out for the Illinois Country. They set out to search for the Kankakee portage, an overland path that connected the St. Joseph River to the Kankakee River, but they missed the portage and La Salle became separated from the rest of his men. The group spent the night separated in a snow storm, but the next morning La Salle was able to relocate the river and rejoin his men. They continued searching and finally found the path and started overland to the Kankakee River. Once reaching the river they took to their canoes and traveled westward and then down the Mississippi. Their supplies began to run low, but they found a bison stranded in a mud pool which they were able to kill and eat, replenishing a large part of their supplies. They continued downstream and encountered a large Indian village where they stopped to build a fort he named Fort Crèvecoeur.
Using his new fort as the start of a trading post, La Salle invited the local tribes for negotiations. There he established a trading agreement with the tribes and also discovered that they were also locked in the war with the Iroquois who had been frequent raiders in the area. The area contained numerous tribes, including the Miami tribe to the east, the Wea and Piankeshaw to the south-east, the Illinois tribe in the immediate area, and the Peoria tribe to the farther west. There were even several groups of refugees from as far away as Maine who had fled into the region hoping to avoid the Iroquois who had invaded their own homelands. Most of the country east of the fort, which was the Ohio Country, was empty according the local tribes, most of the inhabitants had fled into the Illinois Country and beyond to escape the Iroquois.
The remainder of the winter was spent collecting furs from the surrounding area and after spring arrived a group of men was sent to deliver the furs to Montreal via the trade route that had just been established. The men returned and sold the furs, but deserted and did not return. La Salle then set out for Canada to discover what had become of his men. On the return trip he encountered the new governor of New France who was coming to take possession of the outposts La Salle had established for the crown and to put in garrisons. Upon his return to his outpost he discovered it had been destroyed by his own men who mutinied not long after his departure in the autumn of 1680. The local tribes were nowhere to be found and had fled to the west of the Mississippi River, likely because of continued Iroquois raids.
Later expeditions.
In 1681 La Salle returned again to the Illinois Country and rebuilt his fort. This time he began negotiations with the tribes to return and set up an alliance. He immediately began trade with them and through the next two years he began to import firearms and other metal tools that the tribes never had previous access to. In 1682 La Salle began to establish a post he named Fort Saint Louis on the Mississippi. He used the post as an even more forward base into the countryside. He spent the next several years establishing posts and trade throughout the Illinois Country. Although the Iroquois returned to again destroy the French posts, the plan succeeded in the years after La Salle's death in 1687. Using their new arms, the odds were evened with the Iroquois and the tribes were eventually able to reclaim their homeland following the 1701 Great Peace of Montreal.
La Salle then assembled a party for the expedition for which he is most remembered. Leaving Fort Crevecoeur with eighteen Native Americans, he canoed down the Mississippi River in 1682, naming the Mississippi basin ""La Louisiane"" in honor of Louis XIV. At what is now the site of Memphis, Tennessee he built a small fort, Fort Prudhomme. On April 9, at the mouth of the Mississippi River, near modern Venice, Louisiana, La Salle buried an engraved plate and a cross, claiming the territory for France. In 1683, on his return voyage, he established Fort Saint Louis of Illinois, at Starved Rock on the Illinois River, to replace Fort Crevecoeur. Tonti was to command the fort while La Salle traveled again to France for supplies.
On July 24, 1684, La Salle sailed again from France and returned to America with a large expedition designed to establish a French colony on the Gulf of Mexico, at the mouth of the Mississippi River. They left France in 1684 with four ships and 300 colonists. The expedition was plagued by pirates, hostile Indians, and poor navigation. One ship was lost to pirates in the West Indies, a second sank in the inlets of Matagorda Bay, where a third ran aground. They set up French colonization of Texas Fort Saint Louis of Texas, near Victoria, Texas. La Salle led a group eastward on foot on three occasions to try to locate the Mississippi. During another search for the Mississippi River, his remaining 36 followers mutinied, near the site of modern Navasota, Texas. On March 19, 1687, La Salle was slain by Pierre Duhaut, one of four attacking him, "six leagues" from the westernmost village of the Hasinai Tejas Indians. The colony lasted only until 1688, when Karankawa-speaking Indians massacred the 20 remaining adults and took five children as captives.
Impact.
Beginning in 1700 the French Government began to become interested in the discoveries made by La Salle. The land was better for farming and settlement than lands in Canada and the government began plans to colonize the region. The land gained further importance with the growing power of the English colonies on the eastern seaboard. To counter the English colonies' growth a series of forts and outposts was built along the important trade routes pioneered by La Salle, including a new post named St Louis, this time on the west shore of Mississippi River. The French continued to control parts of La Salle's discoveries until as late as 1803.
La Salle's expedition began written history for most of the Midwest and his contact with the tribes of the west served as an important record of the early history of North America.
LaSalle Texas expedition between 1685 and 1688 triggered a series of events that culminated in Texas with all its wealth joining the United States of America.
LaSalle was never reported to have problems associating or interacting with the indigenous people in North America except for the Karankawa Indians of the gulf coast of Texas. Soon after his arrival in Texas in Jan 1685, LaSalle was able to determine from the tool marks on human bones at old Karankawa campsites that they practiced cannibalism as a matter of course. Thereafter, likely as a matter of self-preservation, LaSalle and his settlers viewed themselves in a state of war with the Karankawas. In fact, many settlers were lost to the Karankawas in the years that followed and the settlement itself, Fort St Louis, was overrun by the Karankawas in Dec 1688 and all remaining adults killed. In early 1689, a Spanish column searching for the French settlement happened upon the devastation that had been the fort and buried the remains of the dead which, inter alia, consisted of bones with tool marks scattered about the site.
LaSalle triggered a Spanish effort to settle Texas with colonists of their own to deny the French entry and generally establish their sovereignty over the area. Any colonists moving north through the lands of the Karankawas in east Texas had to be protected by accompanying soldiers at great expense and each settlement had to have a small garrison of soldiers as well. Eventually new settlers from Mexico became but a trickle while the influx of Americans from the north increased.
In 1823, Steve Austin organized the Texas Rangers for the protection of settlers mainly from the depredations of the Karankawas. 
The immigrants from the USA and Mexico gradually evolved into Texicans all having one interest – their Texas and freedom from Mexican occupation. When Generalissimo Santa Ana crossed the Rio Grande with 6000 men in 1835 intent on reinforcing Mexican sovereignty in Texas, the Texicans declared independence. Santa Ana, at first, enjoyed success in his invasion by winning a number of battles. His most dramatic success was his victory at the Alamo in San Antonio. But he had expended men and material without achieving his end goal being the defeat of General Houston and his forces. After the Alamo, he unwisely split his forces and went looking for Houston. This was a major military blunder. Elements of the two armies met at San Jacinto on 21 Apr 1836. Houston with 900 men attacked Santa Ana and his 1400 troops during the siesta in the afternoon of that fateful day. Eighteen minutes after contact, it was over. Mopping up continued for the rest of the day and into the next day. Half the Mexican force was killed and the other half, including Santa Ana, taken prisoner. In the result, Santa Ana agreed to the independence of Texas and his army moved south of the Rio Grande leaving Texas free and independent in its wake. As history records, a few years later, Texas became a state of the United States of America bringing into the union its phenomenal oil, mineral and agricultural assets that fueled the massive industrialization of America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
In his Texas period, LaSalle lost his life and failed to find a route to the Pacific or to found a permanent settlement that would establish a claim for the King of France over the area. But he had set in motion a chain of events that ended with Texas and its huge land mass and riches becoming a part of the United States of America.

WJOS (AM)

WJOS (1540 AM) was a radio station broadcasting a Southern gospel format, licensed to Elkin, North Carolina.
History.
Al Hinshaw signed on WIFM-FM in Elkin in 1949, and added an AM station several years later. Both stations had difficulties but they survived. James Childress bought the stations in 1954. WIFM-AM was a daytime-only station, but the FM station aired programming at night.
The AM and FM stations aired the same programming (the AM went off the air at night) until FCC rules prohibited this more than a few hours a day. By this time, enough people had FM radios that separate programming became possible.
In the mid-70s, Leon Reece's "Good Morning Show" and "Open Mike" aired on both stations. The AM aired pop/rock music.
In the early 80s the FM studio moved and the AM station took over the former FM studio.
WIFM-AM later became WJOS (for Jonesville, where the station moved) and its format was Southern gospel from the late 80s until 1995. John Wishon was station manager and morning host most of those years.

Tax credit overpayment

In the tax law of the United Kingdom, tax credit overpayment occurs when a claimant has received more Working Tax Credit (WTC) or Child Tax Credit (CTC) than HMRC’s final end of year calculations awards them. This can be caused by official or claimant error or neglect, or simply because the provisional payments were based, as is standard, on out of date information. The mechanics as a tax system are discussed elsewhere (see Working Tax Credit and tax credit.) This article is solely about overpayment.
Since the implementation of the Tax Credit Act 2002 (TCA 2002) HMRC consider overpaid tax credit in the same light as unpaid income tax, and can use the full extent of their powers to pursue recovery (aka repayment) 
Records for each completed year (all awards up to date and closed) show that one third of all tax credit claims have been overpaid. In fact 1/3 are also underpaid, and only 1/3 paid correctly on average. 
Causes of overpayment.
A combination of several of the following may be responsible for any overpayment bill. 
Customer Error Applicants delaying informing HMRC of changes of circumstances (CoC's) such as children leaving a household, ending employment, or splitting from a partner. This also includes applicants giving incorrect information on making/updating claims, or failing to respond in a timely manner to deadlines in the Tax Credit process. 
Annualised taxation calculations Because entitlement to tax credits depends on the level of income received for the tax year it is being paid, the true award cannot be finalised until the end of that year, as such all payments are ‘provisional’ until an end of year calculation. The result is that an overpayment can be discovered at the end (or even during) an award.
Inflexibility of the system HMRC did not anticipate claimants' incomes and circumstances would vary so much ‘in year’. The system operates retroactively, so delays allowing for changes to process mean overpayment can occur even if changes are reported timely. The resulting numerous and confusing paperwork amendments to claims caused additional problems.
The Tax Credit Office initially took the decision not to require or act on notifications of circumstance changes ‘in year’ anyway, and instead save this information until the end of the year to factor into a single entitlement recalculation. This meant overpayments built up even where claimants notified HMRC of all changes of circumstance (CoC’s) 
Provisional payments made between the end of one claim and the processing of another assumed income was predictable and stable. In practice, income details used could be two years out of date and were not even being supplied by the claimant on which to base any current payments. The result was awards were not even properly started for that year and may already have been overpaid. 
Calculations and deductions HMRC told claimants to apply deductions before declaring their income if they had had a child in the previous year, reducing the gross figure of the claimant’s income and therefore increased their entitlement to a higher level of award. In reality, this actually caused an overpayment because it transpired that this calculation only worked when it was assumed that the claimant would not be going back to work in the following year.
HMRC’s lack of experience with the TC client base Because HMRC as a whole, and the staff in general, were used to dealing with higher income earners, they had no understanding of the importance of reliable and secure awards, nor the empathy or experience to deal reasonably with frustrated, confused claimants who had variable circumstances and little previous experience of taxation.
Take up of Tax Credit was far higher than expected and staff were working under pressure with fixed deadlines, little training, backlogs, confused claimants and inadequate facilities. Untrained and private sector staff were answering claimant’s calls, and callers were not advised of this. 
Annulled awards These types of overpayment bills are called 'annulled awards' because the Tax Credit Office have said the claimant didn't return the end of year declaration within the time limit. This automatically 'wipes out' their entitlement to all the payments they already received for that tax year.
Wrong Capacity this is when a claim is terminated because HMRC believe the couple / single status of the adults on the award was wrong. Rather than the status being changed, the claim is automatically cancelled and all payments already made are ruled as overpaid. No replacement claim is calculated in the "‘right’" capacity unless the claimant invokes the dispute process and is able to successful argue for a Notional Entitlement assessment. 
The I.T infrastructure The computerised system on which processing, recording and calculating claimants awards was based was flawed. ‘Glitches’ in the systems mean records are lost or not logged, records were not kept of all communications to the Tax Credit Office, award notices that claimants are supposed to check are not posted or received, and the dual level system means that call operative give out the wrong information regarding claims because they cannot see all case information. The company responsible EDS were later sued by HMRC 
Fraud and error.
To be overpaid is not an accusation or suspicion of fraud or neglect, and there doesn’t have to have been an error for an overpayment to have occurred. 
""An element of overpayment to claimants was an inherent part of the design of the tax credits system""
Unhelpfully HMRC combine the figures for fraud and error when publicly releasing the information and do not separate out which is claimant error and which is official error.
Dispute process.
Some claimants are initially confused when informed of an overpayment, and believe that HMRC are trying to reclaim money the claimant didn’t receive. This is because during the course of an award claimants are sent award notices stating the current rate of payments, so when an overpayment is declared claimants don’t understand that those award notices are now ‘wrong’. If the circumstances used to calculate an overpayment are correct, then there is no denying the amount paid was wrong, but responsibility, and therefore who should have to foot the bill, can be contested. 
Terminology causes confusion here as accepted language would be to "Appeal", but because Tax Credits is enshrined in tax law, and in that "Appeal" has a specific meaning, it is not possible to Appeal against the recovery of an overpayment. (As that would be to insist the circumstances used for the final calculation were wrong) instead, in cases where responsibility for the cause of the overpayment is contested, the correct terminology is to "dispute" recovery of the overpayment. 
It is possible to dispute informally, but there is a set structure and route through the process. HMRC’s Code of Practice 26 ("COP 26") sets out the basics of why and how claimants can dispute recovery of an overpayment but does not go into detail. Several agencies offer support and guidance in disputing including the Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) and the Tax Credit Casualties
Contentious issues.
There have been many criticisms of the delivery of tax credits and the handling of overpayment disputes 
Criticisms have centred on:
• That the dispute process is not independently adjudicated.
• The number of HMRC errors claimants are expected to spot.
• The level of understanding of tax law HMRC assumed claimants would have.
• HMRC’s lack of clear information regarding how to dispute. 
• The poor administration and training of staff.
• The automatic renewal process that automatically starts a new claim when a claimant provides closing details for the previous year’s claim, whether they want a new claim or not. 
• That there is no opt out of the system, if a claimant still qualifies but doesn’t want to claim HMRC have to list ‘household break up’ on the claim to invalidate it.
• That the computer system was rolled out with so many flaws in it.
• That the increase income disregard from £2,500 to £25,000 was not retroactively backdated and is not the safety net it was supposed to be 
• HMRC adjusting awards after finalisation, often going back several years, which instantly ‘creates’ overpayments.
• The flawed assumptions about how claimants lived that left the system inflexible and unrealistic.
• The low rate of successful disputes.
• Implementation of the Civil Partnerships bill and decisions regarding claimants deemed to be Living Together As Husband And Wife (LTAHAW) have seen them get criticised for dictating lifestyle politics 
• The annualised calculation system - HMRC traditionally are used to dealing with high income earners and corporations who ‘balance’ their tax accounts on a yearly basis and have the savings and income to be able to do this.

Funding Act of 1870

The Funding Act of 1870 (41st Congress, Sess. 2, ch. 256, , enacted July 14, 1870) was an Act of Congress to re-fund the national debt. It allowed the exchange of high interest, short-term floating bonds bearing lower interest and terms of up to 30 years. Principal and interest of the new issues would be paid in "coin of the present standard value."
Legislative history.
The bill was sponsored by Senator John Sherman (R) of Ohio. Debate over the funding bill was long and intense. The discussion focused very heavily on public virtue, national honesty, and avoiding "repudiation" on the one hand and unearned reward to speculators on the other. Members generally agreed that an investor should finally receive no more and no less than he lent on a contract at the beginning.

Doryphora

Doryphora is a genus of plant in the family Atherospermataceae, or formerly Monimiaceae. It contains four species, two endemic to Australia.
Overview.
They are evergreen trees or shrubs from southern hemisphere of gondwanan origin, native to the temperate rainforests. The trees will reach approximately 100 feet (30 m) tall. They have dark to medium green lanceolate lauroid leaves with serrated edges. The leaves have a strong sarsaparilla odor when crushed. The lumber is used in cabinetry and a tonic is made from the bark of some species, "Doryphora aromatica", "Doryphora sassafras"... which also have insect repelling properties.
The flowers are white star-shaped. The blooms cover the tree at canopy level in the rainforest.
They are cloud forest plants and need partial shade to full sun with a moist well-drained soil mix. The plants must kept moist at all times. Never the winter temps must fall below 50°F (10°C).
"Doryphora" are propagated by birds that eat the berries. The seed are very small and germinate in 80-100 days at 70°F (21°C).
This genus originated in the Antarctic flora, and shares plant species with South America, New Caledonia, Tasmania and Australia, in habitats of cloud forest and temperate rainforest. It was in the Cretaceous that angiosperm flora colonized New Zealand and New Caledonia, from South America, along the Antarctic margin of Gondwana, with species as Nothofagus and Proteaceae. They are yet umbrófila plants in forest or rainforest in place like New Caledonia. 
This genus has plant with vicariant species that met the same ecological role, in other areas, where there was also accompanied by a laurel or pine communities in the most extreme climate areas. The role of "Nothofagus" and Podocarpaceae was occupied by the "Taxus" and various oaks in other places.

Royal Hanoverian State Railways

The Royal Hanoverian State Railways (German: "Königlich Hannöverschen Staatseisenbahnen") existed from 1843 until the annexation of the Kingdom of Hanover by the Kingdom of Prussia in 1866. At that time its railway network, which comprised 800 kilometres of track, went over to the Prussian state.
Construction phases and routes.
The "Kreuzbahn".
The concept of the "Kreuzbahn" arose from the desire of King Ernest Augustus I to avoid having a central railway station in Hanover. The routes therefore ran into the district of Lehrte in the form of a cross (hence "Kreuzbahn" = cross railway) and, as a result, Lehrte developed into an important railway hub.
The government of the Kingdom of Hanover had initially taken over the construction of state railways, because no private sponsors could be found for the first railway lines that were planned. These were the routes:
The first line, a 16 kilometre stretch from Hanover via Misburg to Lehrte, was opened on 22 October 1843. Its extension towards Brunswick followed on 1 December 1843 as far as the state border at Peine; there on 19 May 1844 it was joined to the Duchy of Brunswick State Railway that owned almost a third of the now 60 kilometre long connexion between the two "residenz" cities. On 15 October 1845 the Lehrte–Celle line followed and on 12 June 1846 the Lehrte–Hildesheim line was finally completed.
From the "Kreuzbahn" the following additional lines were built under the direction of the Royal Hanoverian Railway which was founded on 13 March 1843:
The Celle–Harburg line via Uelzen and Lüneburg was opened on 1 May 1847 and on 15 October 1847 the Hannover–Minden line followed with its connexion to the main line operated by the Cologne–Minden Railway Company.
Bremen Railway.
Against the wishes of Prussia the line to Bremen, which was jointly funded with the state of Bremen, was not constructed directly from Minden, but from Hanoverian Wunstorf. On 12 December 1847 the Wunstorf–Bremen section was opened. As a result of the political events of 1848/49 (March revolutions), further expansion of the railway network in the Kingdom of Hanover was delayed.
Hanoverian Western Railway.
The project, jointly agreed with Prussia, for a railway from Löhne to the Cologne-Minden Railway Company network via Osnabrück to Emden did not come to fruition until there had been protracted discussions about the course of the line and its connexion to the Dutch railway network.
In the end they agreed upon the present-day route from von Löhne via Osnabrück to Prussian Rheine, that at the same time provided a junction at Münster to the Royal Westphalian Railway Company ("Königlich-Westfälische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft") and from there a link via Salzbergen to Leer and Emden.
The link to the Dutch railway network was achieved from Hanoverian Salzbergen through Bentheim to Oldenzaal. On 24 November 1854 the first section, Emden–Papenburg, was completed.
Bremen–Bremerhaven railway.
On 23 January 1862 the extension of the Bremen line to Geestemünde/Wesermünde (today Bremerhaven) was effected, again in conjunction with the city of Bremen.
Elbe train ferry.
On 15 March 1864 after lengthy negotiations the line along the river Elbe from Lüneburg to Hohnstorf was finally built and, at the same time the Lauenburg-Hohnstorf Elbe Ferry Company was formed and they established a ferry to connect with the Berlin-Hamburg Railway Company's Lauenburg–Büchen line on the other side of the Elbe.
Harz.
The Vienenburg–Goslar railway was also owned by the Hanoverian State Railways, although it was operated by the Duchy of Brunswick State Railway. The Göttingen–Arenshausen and Northeim–Ellrich lines were not completed until after the transfer of the Hanoverian State Railways to Prussia after the War of 1866.
Transfer of the state railway to Prussia.
On 15 December 1866 the Royal Hanoverian State Railways was merged into the Prussian state railways and renamed as the Prussian railway division of Hanover.

Mallinckrodt, Inc. v. Medipart, Inc.

Mallinckrodt, Inc. v. Medipart, Inc., 976 F.2d 700 (Fed. Cir. 1992), is a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, in which the court appeared to overrule or drastically limit many years of U.S. Supreme Court precedent affirming the patent exhaustion doctrine, for example in Bauer & Cie. v. O'Donnell.
Factual background.
According to the opinions in the case, the plaintiff Mallinckrodt owned a patent on a device for dispensing a radioactive mist used in taking diagnostic lung X-rays, and for trapping the mist after use. Mallinckrodt sold the device to hospitals for about $40 or $50. Hospital personnel would load the device with a suitable radioactive fluid to perform a diagnostic procedure on a patient, use the device, and then discard it. Mallinckrodt labeled the devices it sold with the notice “Single use only.” Because the device itself cost approximately $10 to make but was sold for four or five times that, most of the purchase price that hospitals paid Mallinckrodt apparently represented the value of the patent (or the patented technology). This fact apparently led the defendant Medipart to go into the recycling business, in which Mallinckrodt itself had no direct interest (it chose to sell only new devices). For a $20 recycling fee, Medipart would clean one of the devices for a hospital, replace some parts, subject the device to gamma radiation to kill germs, and return it to the hospital for reuse. The district court and court of appeals opinions do not support the claim that a health or safety problem existed. However, Mallinckrodt asserted to the court that "potential adverse consequences, such as infectious disease transmission” provided the reason for its imposing the restriction against reuse.
Litigation and rulings.
Since Medipart and hospitals dealing with it were defying Mallinckrodt's “Single use only” label and adversely affecting its business, Mallinckrodt sued the recycler for patent infringement. Medipart then moved to dismiss the patent infringement claim because of the exhaustion doctrine; the district court agreed and granted summary judgment.
Mallinckrodt appealed and the Federal Circuit reversed. It held that, despite the breadth of the language of the Supreme Court’s decisions on exhaustion, the apparently absolute rule against post-sale restrictions on patentees' customers should apply only to price-fixes and tie-ins. In cases not involving price-fixes or tie-ins, such as this one, patentees were free to limit their customer's use of products as long as the restrictions did not so greatly hinder competition as to amount to an antitrust violation.
The reasoning of the "Mallinckrodt" court proceeds along the following lines:
The ruling in "Mallinckrodt" had two principal prongs, both of which figured in subsequent Federal Circuit decisions. First, the main holding was that patent owners could sell patented goods with a restrictive notice and thereby restrict the disposition of the goods by the purchasers, with the sole exception of price-fixing and tie-in restrictions. Thus, the "Mallinckrodt" court had said that, “[unless the condition violates some other law or policy (in the patent field, notably the misuse or antitrust law),” patentees enjoyed freedom of contract to impose post-sale restrictions on customers under a rule of reason. “The appropriate criterion” for determining the limits of this freedom to impose restrictions, according to the Federal Circuit, “is whether patentee’s or licensor's restriction is reasonably within the patent grant, or whether the patentee has ventured beyond the patent grant and into behavior having an anticompetitive effect not justifiable under the rule of reason.”
The second prong concerned patent misuse. According to the court, the legal tests for post-sale restrictions and for misuse were alike, outside the tie-in and price fixing area: “To sustain a misuse defense involving a licensing arrangement not held to have been per se anticompetitive by the Supreme Court, a factual determination must reveal that the overall effect of the license tends to restrain competition unlawfully in an appropriately defined relevant market.”
Other Federal Circuit decisions have followed the ruling of the "Mallinckrodt" misuse prong.
Impact.
Until the Federal Circuit’s "Mallinckrodt" decision, an unbroken line of Supreme Court and lower court precedents held that the patentee’s patent right over a product that the patentee sold (or that a licensee authorised to make a sale sold) ended at the point of sale. Accordingly, a customer did not commit patent infringement by disobeying a notice, contract, or other “remote control” limitation that the patentee sought to impose on the use of goods that it had sold to the customer. The Supreme Court’s rationale in exhaustion doctrine cases was that the purchasers acquired an unlimited property right in the patented products, and that it was inconsistent with that property right for the patentee to control how the purchasers used or disposed of the products once they had become the property of the purchasers. The legal reasoning in all of these decisions begins with that principle, and the rest of the analysis consists of applying it to the particular facts. Until the 2008 Supreme Court decision in the "Quanta" case, however, the Federal Circuit's "Mallinckrodt" decision superseded the earlier line of exhaustion cases.
It has been observed that under the doctrine of the "Mallinckrodt" case, a patentee may sell its patented product with a legally effective notice prohibiting purchasers from engaging in any of the following conduct:
The Federal Circuit’s "Mallinckrodt" doctrine has not avoided criticism as allegedly stating legal rules that contradict Supreme Court decisions. Thus in 2007, the United States Solicitor General filed an "amicus curiae" brief in "Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.", stating, as to the first prong, "The test adopted by the Federal Circuit in "Mallinckrodt" thus reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the role and scope of the patent-exhaustion doctrine. ... The court of appeals’ approach cannot be reconciled with those Court precedents," and more generally that the Federal Circuit’s "Quanta" opinion based on "Mallinckrodt" “rests on the same erroneous understanding of patent exhaustion that infuses the Federal Circuit’s approach to this area of the law."
The effect of "Mallinckrodt" may have been restricted by the Supreme Court's 2008 decision in "Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc.", which broadly reaffirmed the exhaustion doctrine without mentioning "Mallinckrodt". It is too early to state, however, what the impact of "Quanta" on the "Mallinckrodt" doctrine will be.

Weidendammer Bridge

The Weidendammer Bridge is a long bridge where the Friedrichstrasse crosses the Spree river in the central Mitte district of Berlin, Germany. It is notable for its ornate wrought iron railings, lanterns and Imperial eagles.
History.
In 1685 a wooden drawbridge was built on the site in the course of the creation under Elector Frederick William I of Hohenzollern of a new western suburb of the city, Dorotheenstadt. Named after nearby willow ("Weiden") trees on the riverbank, it was demolished for a cast iron construction erected in 1824, one of the first in Central Europe. Again too small after the exponential population growth of Berlin as the capital of the German Empire, it was again replaced by the current bridge built between 1895 and 1896.
During the Battle of Berlin, the Weidendammer Bridge was one of the few Spree crossings that had not been destroyed. On the night of 1 May 1945, a Tiger tank from the 11th SS Panzergrenadier Division Nordland spearheaded an attempt to storm the bridge to allow hundreds of German soldiers and civilians to escape across it. However, it was destroyed by a Soviet anti-tank round, and many of the evacuees were mowed down by heavy enemy machine gun and small arms fire. There were three subsequent assaults on the bridge, one of which was led by a self-propelled gun and a half-track; all of which failed. During one of them Martin Bormann and Artur Axmann managed to cross the river by the bridge after escaping from the Führerbunker following Adolf Hitler’s suicide. However, Bormann was presumably killed several hours later, while Axmann evaded capture by the Soviets. 
Lovers are known to lock padlocks engraved with their names onto the wrought-iron work on the bridge, and at times, these locks are removed by the authorities.

Modern Hindu law

Modern Hindu law refers to one of the personal law systems of India along with similar systems for Muslims, Sikhs, Parsis, and Christians. This Hindu Personal Law or modern Hindu law is an extension of the Anglo-Hindu Law developed during the British colonial period in India, which is in turn related to the less well-defined tradition of Classical Hindu Law. The time frame of this period of Hindu law begins with the formal independence of India from Great Britain on August 14, 1947, and extends up until the present. While modern Hindu law is heralded for its inherent respect for religious doctrines, many still complain that discrimination (especially with the historical tradition of the caste system) still pervades the legal system. Though efforts to modernize and increase the legal rights of the marginalized have been made (most notably with the passage of the Hindu Code Bills and the establishment of notable legal precedents), the modern legal situation is, like all legal systems across the world, far from perfect.
History and Context.
With the formal independence of India from Great Britain on August 14, 1947, India acquired a new constitution as well as a complex legal system. While a Western influence is apparent in this system, it is not an exact replication. The Indian legal system has characteristics of common law, but is codified and thus is actually more similar to civil law in nature. The modern Hindu legal system is applied to strictly personal law, including issues of marriage, inheritance and adoption, whereas India's secular legal system is applied to issues of criminal law and civil law.
India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, worked to unify the newly independent India by proposing the reformation and codification of Hindu personal law. Nehru's efforts led to contentious debates over the so-called Hindu Code Bill, which he offered in the Indian parliament, as a way to fix still unclear elements of the Anglo-Hindu law. The Hindu Code Bill was initially and continues to be very controversial within and outside of the Hindu community. Criticism of the document is based on the belief that the laws in the Hindu Code bill should apply to all citizens regardless of religious affiliation. Though a small minority suggested some kind of return to classical Hindu law, the real debate was over how to appropriate the Anglo-Hindu law. 
Nehru completed codification and partial reform, but overall the legal system only slightly changed. In the end, a series of four major pieces of personal law legislation were passed in 1955-56 and these laws form the first point of reference for modern Hindu law: Hindu Marriage Act (1955), Hindu Succession Act (1956), Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act (1956), and Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act (1956). Though these legislative moves purported to resolve still unclear parts of the Anglo-Hindu law, the case law and interpretive tradition of British judges and Indian judges in the British employ remained and remains crucial to the application of modern Hindu law.
The overall effect of the codification of these rules was negative. It was codified for the Hindus yet left them with limited legal option, as well as tried to stamp out any diversity name of "Hindu unity". To no surprise it also caused a deep rift between Hindus and Muslims. Some other negative effects included:
Application of Modern Hindu Law.
As stated by Article 44 of the Indian Constitution, India is a secular state that strives towards legal uniformity. Many argue that the commitment of the Indian government towards this gradual uniformity of the legal system threatens the minority religious groups that utilize the plurality of the law to maintain traditions and implement their religious laws. While modern Indian Law claims to make strides towards secularism, it is undeniable that its foundations rise from the Hindu legal tradition and continues to maintain religious legal acceptance by recognizing the personal and family laws of the Islamic, Christian, Jewish, and Hindu religions.
Before discussing the modern application and sources of Hindu law it is important to outline whom thse laws govern. In the case of Hindu personal and family laws, as outlined by the Acts of Parliament discussed below, those that are followers the Hindu religion, as well as those who are not Christian, Jewish or Muslim, are held accountable to these laws. Therefore, it is assumed that all Indians who are not Muslim, Jewish or Christian are Hindu, disregarding personal religious laws of followers of Buddhist, Jain, Sikh and other religions, creating controversy within these communities. The Indian legal system does recognize Muslim, Jewish and Christian family courts as well as secular family courts.
Sources of Modern Hindu Law.
Sources of Classical Hindu law arose from the religious texts of the "Dharmaśāstra", as well as "sadachar" or customs, and commentaries or digests that translated and interpreted the laws. Since British colonialism, India has codified several aspects of the Hindu tradition into the Indian legal system as well as adopted common and civil legal procedures.
Legislation.
Legislation, as created and implemented by the Indian government, is the strongest source of law in all Indian courts. In the case of two conflicting sources, legislation holds the highest jurisdiction. While it is not a traditional source of law for the Hindu legal system, it is the latest and most legitimate form.
During colonialism, the British codified several aspects of the Hindu legal tradition into the Indian legal system, with the assumption that all Indians were Hindus. Thus upon gaining independence, many of the same laws that governed the country during colonialism were maintained as such, making the Indian Constitution and legal system heavily laden with Hindu legal traditions at its foundation.
Case Law.
India is based on the British common legal system, thus the courts rely heavily on "stare decisis", or precedent, when deciding cases. Any case decision made by a higher court is a source of law to all of the lower courts, in the prospect that the laws will be applied in a similar manner. The Hindu family courts are expected to follow laws handed down from previous cases. 
Modern Hindu law relies on the interpretation of judges and their ability to decipher mitigating factors within each legal situation. This is reflective of the ancient Hindu legal tradition of working out problems on a case specific basis in finding justice in each specific instance.
Notable Legal Precedents and Legislation.
As is the case with many global legal systems that rely on precedents as a source of law, certain cases stand out that have shaped the Indian legal system into what it is today. Not only do they provide the foundation for future legal cases but they also make a statement about the state of the country and what direction it wants to lead. One such case came about during the efforts of modernization reforms in India. Known as the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act (1971), the law allowed Indian women to legally obtain abortions. Thus this law made not only a religious statement, as India was trying to become more secular, but also made a statement of equality as it expanded the rights women had.
Another Act that most came to be was Early in December 2008, the marriage between a Hindu and a Christian was deemed invalid under the Hindu Marriage Act (1955) as the Act provides for only Hindu couples to enter into a wedlock, the Supreme Court has ruled. Allegedly, Raj had misinformed his wife about his social status and she filed for divorce. He claimed that the Hindu Marriage Act does not preclude a Hindu from marrying a person of another faith. Dismissing the Christian husband’s appeal, the apex court upheld the High Courts’s view that the marriage not valid under the Hindu Marriage Act, specifically pointing to the fact that Section 5 of the Act makes it clear that a marriage may be solemnized between any two Hindus if the conditions in the said Section were fulfilled.
Hindu Code Bills.
Following independence, the postcolonial government led by Jawaharlal Nehru completed the codification and reform of Hindu personal law, a process that had been begun by the British. According to the British policy of noninterference, reform of personal law should have arisen from a demand from the Hindu community. This was not the case, as there was significant opposition from various Hindu politicians, organizations, and devotees who saw themselves unjustly singled out as the sole religious community whose laws were to be reformed. However, the administration saw such codification as necessary in order to unify the Hindu community, which ideally would be a first step towards unifying the nation. They succeeded in passing four Hindu Code Bills, including Hindu Marriage Act (1955), Hindu Succession Act (1956), Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act (1956), and Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act (1956). 
Nehru and his supporters insisted that the Hindu community, which comprised 80% of the Indian population, first needed to be united before any actions were taken to unify the rest of India. Therefore, the codification of Hindu personal law became a symbolic beginning on the road to establishing the Indian national identity. Nehru also felt that because he was Hindu, it was his prerogative to codify specifically Hindu law, as opposed to Muslim or Jewish law. 
Those in Parliament who supported the Bills also saw them as a vital move towards the modernization of Hindu society, as they would clearly delineate secular laws from religious law. Many also heralded the Bill’s opportunity to implement greater rights for women, establishing that such rights were necessary for India’s development.
The Hindu Code Bills are still controversial among some communities, including women's, nationalist, and religious groups. At the time of their creation, many portrayed them as a serious deviation from Hindu legal precedent. However, now many, including Nivedita Menon, argue that it is "misleading...to claim that Hindu personal law was reformed the 1950s. It was merely codified, and even that was in the face of stiff resistance from Congress leaders." 
Administration and Practice.
 There are no religious courts in India, as it is a secular nation. Rather religious personal laws are adjudicated by the state on a case by case basis. 
Courts.
 The court system of India is essentially divided into three tiers, the Supreme Court of India at the apex of the hierarchy for the entire country, twenty-one High Courts at the top of the hierarchy in each State, and subsequent district courts that govern family, criminal and civil laws within the states. The High Courts have jurisdiction over a state, a union territory or a group of states and union territories. District courts are the courts of first resort. 
 It is within the district courts that Hindu law and other religious laws are administered. State judges apply Hindu law on a case by case basis.
Judges.
 The judges that preside over the district courts in India are state bureaucrats, not religious priests or scholars. Thus it is possible for a Hindu judge to preside over a divorce case between a Muslim couple or for a Christian judge to preside over a case involving a Hindu family. With no formal education on the religious laws of the state, judges may not be well versed in the laws they are to adjudicate. They rely heavily on case precedent and scholarly works to guide them through the cases.
Lawyers.
 Lawyers in India are trained in general law schools and receive no formal and specific training on Hindu law, Muslim law, or any other personal religious laws. All lawyers are however required to take courses regarding personal law. These larger courses touch on the variety of personal laws that exist in India, including Hindu Law.

Doryphora sassafras

Doryphora sassafras, commonly known as Sassafras, Yellow-, Canary- or Golden sassafras, or Golden Deal, is a species of evergreen tree of the family Atherospermataceae native to the subtropical and temperate rainforests of eastern New South Wales and Queensland, Australia. It is a tall tree with green foliage and contrasting white flowers which occur in Autumn and Winter.
Taxonomy.
"Doryphora sassafras" was first described by Austrian naturalist Stephan Endlicher in 1837. Its generic name is derived from the Ancient Greek "dory-" "spear" and "pherein" "to carry", and refers to the anthers in the flower, while its specific epithet is taken from its similar odour to the North American Laurel ("Sassafras albidum"). It is a member of the small family Atherospermataceae along with several other Australian rainforest trees including southern sassafras ("Atherosperma moschatum").
Common names include Canary Sassafras, Yellow Sassafras, Golden Sassafras, Golden Deal or simply Sassafras.
Description.
"Doryphora sassafras" can grow to a height of 25-35;metres. It is a straight-trunked tree generally with a small crown, its grey-brown trunk reaching a diameter of 1.2 m (4 ft). Oppositely arranged on the stem, the 
green leaves are elliptic to lanceolate or ovate, usually 7–10 cm (3–4 in) long, 2–4 cm wide, margins are shallowly to deeply toothed, glabrous and glossy, with a pleasant 'sassafras' scent when crushed. They have a prominent midrib and veins on the paler underside. The small white flowers occur in groups of three on short axillary stalks from May to July, and are followed by dark brown hairy fruit which are ripe from February to August. The flowering display can be showy with flowers massed on branches. contrasting against the darker foliage.
Distribution and habitat.
The distribution is from Nambour in southern Queensland through eastern New South Wales to Wolumla Peak in Yurammie State Forest. It is found in temperate rainforest on basalt soils at higher elevations and sedimentary soils at lower elevations, commonly associated with Coachwood ("Ceratopetalum apetalum") and native crabapple ("Schizomeria ovata").
Cultivation and uses.
The yellowish soft timber is used in floors, turnery, and cabinet work. It is used in reforestation but generally grows too big to be used in home gardens. It has been thought to have potential as a potted specimen. It has been planted in Dublin area in Ireland

The Stages of Life

The Stages of Life () is an allegorical oil painting of 1835 by the German Romantic landscape painter Caspar David Friedrich. Completed just five years before his death, this picture, like many of his works, forms a meditation both on his own mortality and on the transience of life.
The painting is set on a sea shore and shows in the foreground an aged man with his back turned to the viewer, walking towards two adults and two children on a hilltop overlooking a harbour. The figures are echoed by five ships shown in the harbour, each at a different distance from the shore, an allegorical reference to the different stages of human life, to the end of a journey, to the closeness of death.
The figures have been identified as Friedrich and his family. The aged man is the artist himself, the small boy is his young son Gustav Adolf, the young girl is his daughter Agnes Adelheid, the older girl is his daughter Emma, and the man in the top hat is his nephew Johann Heinrich.
Although many of Friedrich's paintings were set in imagined landscapes, "The Stages of Life" is recognisably located at Utkiek, near Friedrich's birthplace of Greifswald in today's northeastern Germany.
Description.
The painting depicts a Baltic Sea port in the dusk. On the sea three sailing ships returning home can be seen; the large ship in the middle has already begun to draw in its sails. Two smaller sailboats have almost reached land. The one on the right heads directly for the group of five people on the bank, who by their clothes are recognizable as townspeople. In their midst sits a boy who holds up a Swedish pennant, while the girl beside him reaches for it. To their right sits a woman who leans toward both children with her right hand raised.
These five figures correspond to the five ships visible in the harbour beyond. The three groupings of figures (one aged man, two adults, and two children) echo the positioning of the ships at various distances from the shore as allegorical of the stages of life, and closeness to death. The central ship is thought to represent the mother, while further inshore, two small boats—references to the two children—have only just begun their voyage and still remain in shallow, clear water. To the horizon, the farthest ship disappears into the setting horizon, symbolizing the aged man's voyage from this life into the unknown. 
Alternatively, other critics have interpreted the two ships in the distance as the mother and father sailing off to live their lives and gain experience and wisdom as parents, and the large ship closest to the shore as the old man - one who has lived a full life, built up many experiences and is finally pulling into the harbor at the end of life.
The group forms a semicircle: the children are on its farthest point; to their left and right are a younger man and the young woman. On the extreme left an older man stands looking straight ahead, outside the circle. The women and children are dressed for summer, while the old man wears a coat and a fur hat. The five people on the beach match the five ships on the sea, which all head towards the bank. The bow of the big ship in the middle is exactly aligned with the two children with the pennant.
Swedish pennant.
Friedrich's home town of Greifswald belonged to the Duchy of Pomerania until 1630, when the area passed to Sweden as Swedish Pomerania. In 1815 it became part of Prussian Province of Pomerania. The painting shows Friedrich's younger daughter Agnes Adelheid and his son Gustav Adolf holding a Swedish pennant 20 years after the cession of Greifswald to Prussia. The view encompasses the peninsula in front of the Baltic Sea, beyond which lies Sweden. Friedrich christened his son Gustav Adolf, after the Swedish king Gustav Adolf IV. The Swedish writer Per Daniel Amadeus Atterbom wrote of the painter,
Title.
In keeping with the Romantic ideals of the time, Friedrich intended his paintings to function purely in visual terms, and thus he was cautious that the titles given to his work were not overly descriptive or evocative. It is likely that the relatively literal title "The Stages of Life" was not given by the artist himself, but that the work was instead renamed during a revival of interest in the artist in the late 19th or early 20th century.

List of Scottish Premier League hat-tricks

The Scottish Premier League (SPL) was a football league competition that operated between 1998 and 2013. During that period, more than 100 players scored three goals (a hat-trick) or more in a single match. The first player to achieve the feat was Craig Burley, who scored three times for Celtic in a 5–0 victory against Dunfermline Athletic on the opening day of the first SPL season. Eight players scored more than three goals in a match; of these, three players, Kris Boyd (twice), Gary Hooper and Kenny Miller scored five.
Three matches featured two hat-tricks in the same game. The first two came in the same week of the 1999–2000 season. Henrik Larsson and Mark Viduka both scored three goals each in Celtic's 7–0 win against Aberdeen on 16 October 1999, then Aberdeen's Robbie Winters and Motherwell's John Spencer both scored hat-tricks in a 6–5 win for Aberdeen at Fir Park four days later. Gary Hooper and Anthony Stokes both scored hat-tricks in Celtic's league record 9–0 win against Aberdeen on 6 November 2010. Larsson and Stokes are the only players who have scored hat-tricks in consecutive matches.
Henrik Larsson scored three or more goals twelve times in the Scottish Premier League, more than any other player. Larsson, Boyd, John Hartson, Michael Higdon and Stokes were the only players to have scored more than three hat-tricks in the SPL. Five players scored hat-tricks for two different clubs: Boyd (Kilmarnock and Rangers), Higdon (St. Mirren and Motherwell), Gary McSwegan (Heart of Midlothian and Kilmarnock), Colin Nish (Kilmarnock and Hibernian) and Stokes (Falkirk and Celtic).

List of ships attacked by Somali pirates

Piracy off the Somali coast has threatened international shipping since the beginning of Somalia's civil war in the early 1990s. Since 2005, though, pirates have threatened and seized many ships. A list of ships attacked by Somali pirates since that time is catalogued. Since 2005, many international organizations, including the International Maritime Organization and the World Food Programme, have expressed concern over the rise in acts of piracy. Piracy has contributed to a rise in shipping costs and shipping insurance premiums, and impeded the delivery of food aid shipments.
The UN Security Council adopted on November 20, 2008, proposed by Britain, introducing tougher sanctions against Somalia over the country's failure to prevent a surge in sea piracy. The Somali government is struggling for control of the country against an Islamic insurgency and its navy is currently in development, leaving it almost powerless to stop piracy.
During 2010, 53 ships were hijacked with 8 dead crew. The incidents dropped by more than half from 117 ships hijacked in 2009 due to naval deterrence and ships use of self-protection measures. As a result, Somali pirates are now travelling farther afield.

Royal Flying Corps Canada

The Royal Flying Corps Canada (RFC Canada) was a training organization of the British Royal Flying Corps located in Canada during the First World War. It began operating in 1917.
As the war progressed, Great Britain found that it needed more trained aircrew and more training facilities. Training was provided both by the "Curtiss Aviation School" at Long Branch near Toronto (land plane training) and Hanlan's Point on Toronto Island (for flying boat training), and in the United States. 
The British realized that thousands of Canadians and Americans had joined British flying operations and more wanted to join, so it made sense to open British air training stations in Canada. Canada also had space for such facilities. After much negotiation with the Canadian government, the RFC, commanded in Canada by Lt Col (later Brig Gen) Cuthbert Hoare, began operating several training stations in southern Ontario. Stations were opened at Camp Borden (main training site), Beamsville, Hamilton (armament school), North Toronto (Armour Heights, Leaside and Long Branch), and Deseronto (Mohawk and Rathburn). The Curtiss JN-4 (Jenny) was used for training; 500 Avro 504Ks had been ordered but they were not used before the war ended in November 1918. 
Hoare made several agreements with U.S. Brig Gen George O. Squier (US Army Signal Corps) and the US Aircraft Production Board. Squier had overall responsibility for the US Army’s air service, which was short of flight instructors. The RFC released five experienced American pilots to the US Army, where they became squadron commanders. The US Air Board acquiesced in the British opening a recruiting office in New York City, ostensibly to recruit British citizens, but in fact also soliciting US citizens, of whom about 300 were successfully signed up. The RFC would also train many US Army flight personnel: 400 pilots; 2,000 ground-crew members; and 20 equipment officers. These Americans would then collect aircraft and equipment from the UK, before coming under RFC control in France. Ten American squadrons would train in Canada during the summer of 1917, while RFC squadrons were allowed to train during the winter in Fort Worth, Texas. 
During the last two years of the war 3135 pilots and 137 observers trained in Canada and Texas for both the RFC and the new Royal Air Force (RAF). Of these trainees, 2,624 went to Europe for operational duty.

Bob Nimmo

Robert "Bob" Nimmo (February 5, 1922 in Balboa, California—November 7, 2005 in Atascadero, California) was an American military officer and politician.
Life and career.
Nimmo attended California Polytechnic State University before entering the United States Army Air Corps in 1940. He flew missions over France and Germany in World War II, but was shot down over Poland and interned in Sweden for 3 months. After returning to the U.S. he served as a fight instructor until the end of the war.
After the war Nimmo joined the California National Guard, where he served until 1970. He commanded Camp San Luis Obispo and served as the United States Property & Fiscal Officer, and retired as a Colonel.
A Republican, Nimmo served in the California State Assembly (1973 to 1977) and California State Senate (1977 to 1981).
In 1981, President Ronald Reagan appointed Nimmo to head the Veterans' Administration, and he served until 1982. Nimmo was known for his preference for cutting funding for VA programs. He referred to veterans groups as "greedy", and to Agent Orange as not much worse than a "little teenage acne", although his supporters argued that these quotes were taken out of context. His Deputy, Chuck Hagel, resigned in 1982 over disagreements with Nimmo.
As VA Administrator Nimmo was also accused of excessive expenditures on redecorating his office, leasing an expensive sedan as his official vehicle, and improperly using the employee designated as his driver. Nimmo reimbursed the government more than $6,000 to compensate for the driver's unauthorized overtime.
After returning to California, Nimmo remained active in civic causes and local government, including service on the Atascadero City Council and a term as the city's Mayor (June 26, 1990 to June 1994).

The sessions were the work of The Thelonious Monk Quintet (the July 2, 1948 and July 23, 1951 sessions) and The Modern Jazz Quartet plus Lou Donaldson (a 1952 session). The album has been recompiled and expanded three additional times, with various tracks from these sessions added and deleted. 
The tracks from the Modern Jazz Quartet plus Lou Donaldson consisted of John Lewis on piano, Percy Heath on bass, Kenny Clarke on drums, Milt Jackson on vibraphone, and Lou Donaldson on alto saxophone. The tracks with the Thelonious Monk Quintet were Thelonious Monk on piano, John Simmons on bass, Shadow Wilson on drums, and Milt Jackson on vibraphone -- with Kenny "Pancho" Hagood singing on the tracks "All the Things You Are" and "I Should Care." 
The original 1952 10" LP was expanded to a 12" LP in 1956, and retitled Milt Jackson and the Thelonious Monk Quintet with a cover designed by Reid Miles, his first for the label. In 1989, the cover and title of the 1956 version were used for a CD featuring the complete 1948 and 1952 sessions, but the 1951 Monk Session was moved to Monk's "". The 2001 album Milt Jackson: Wizard of the Vibes used the cover art and title of the original 1952 album, but contained a re-ordered and remastered version of the contents of the 1989 CD.
In each formulation, the album contained Blue Note Thelonious Monk -led performances unavailable on the parallel editions of "Genius of Modern Music."

2009 NASCAR Camping World East Series

The 2009 NASCAR Camping World East Series schedule was announced on December 24, 2008. The 23rd season for the series consists of a 11 race schedule at 10 tracks. The series lost three tracks from last year's schedule (Stafford Motor Speedway, Music City Motorplex and Mansfield Motorsports Park) but gains one new track for this season (Tri-County Motor Speedway). The Tennessee State Fairgrounds was initially on the schedule but changes in management of the track at the venue (new management decided to eliminate NASCAR sanction) resulted in the loss of the event.
For the fourth year in a row, the regular season will start at Greenville-Pickens Speedway on April 11. The series will make its first appearance at Tri-County Motor Speedway two weeks later on April 25 before heading to Iowa for the series' third appearance at Iowa Speedway. The Iowa race will be a combination East/West race where drivers from both series will compete against each other. Drivers are awarded points based on their finishing position against drivers in their series. (i.e. Highest finishing driver in the East gets first place points and the highest finishing driver in the West gets first place points)
Traditional stops at New Hampshire Motor Speedway, Thompson International Speedway, Adirondack International Speedway, and Lime Rock Park fill up the bulk of the summer schedule before the regular season finale at Dover International Speedway on September 25.
The 2009 season Toyota All-Star Showdown takes place January 30, 2010, and will be televised live on Speed Channel.
1 All races will air tape-delayed on Speed Channel on Thursdays at 3pm ET
2 Non-points event. This race airs live on Speed Channel.
Television.
NASCAR announced on March 16 the broadcast schedule for the 2009 NASCAR Camping World Series race schedule on SPEED.
The races will be aired as a one-hour special each Thursday at 3 p.m. ET.
“The NASCAR Camping World Series features the NASCAR stars of tomorrow locked in exciting, wheel-to-wheel competition,” said George Silbermann, NASCAR managing director of racing operations. “This comprehensive schedule allows fans to tune in the same time every week and catch all the action from their favorite track. Our partnership with SPEED provides an exceptional platform to showcase the tremendous talent as they tackle the challenging mixture of short tracks, road courses, and speedways.”
The annual East-West Challenge at Iowa Speedway Sunday, May 17 will air on Thursday, May 28. The last two years, fans have tuned in to watch the best NASCAR Camping World Series drivers from both coasts go head-to-head in addition to competing against one of the top drivers in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. In 2007, then-16-year-old Joey Logano outran Kevin Harvick, and last year Brian Ickler held off the challenge from Kasey Kahne. NASCAR Sprint Cup Series driver Kyle Busch has already committed to run this year’s event.
The SPEED coverage will cover all 11 races beginning with the opener at Greenville Pickens Speedway in Greenville, S.C. The opener, scheduled for Saturday, April 11, will air Thursday, April 16. The season will conclude Friday, Sept. 25 at Dover International Speedway and the race will be broadcast Thursday, Oct. 1.
The Toyota All-Star Showdown will air live January 30, 2010, at 10 PM EST.
The NASCAR Camping World Series East race at Music City Motorplex in Nashville, Tenn., originally scheduled for Saturday, July 18, has been cancelled due to changes in track management, and the lack of a suitable replacement for that date. The new Tennessee State Fairgrounds promoters decided to remove the NASCAR sanction for the track.
2009 Series Races.
NASCAR Home Tracks 150 Presented by Kevin Whitaker Chevrolet.
Brian Ickler is hoping to use the NASCAR Camping World Series East as a launching pad. Performances like Saturday night at historic Greenville Pickens Speedway certainly don’t hurt his cause, as Ickler led nearly every lap from start to finish in winning the season opening NASCAR Home Tracks 150 presented by Kevin Whitaker Chevrolet at Greenville-Pickens Speedway on April 11.
Ickler recorded his fourth career NASCAR Camping World Series East victory and seventh NASCAR Camping World Series victory overall.
Veteran Jody Lavender scored a career-best second-place finish, while Eddie MacDonald finished third. Josh Richards and Brett Moffitt, both making their first career NASCAR starts, rounded out the top five.
Ickler qualified second behind Coors Light Pole Award winner Moffitt. A multi-car accident in Turn 1 on the start of the race caused a lengthy red flag before the end of the first lap. NASCAR decided to reset the lineup of the field with the exception of those cars involved in the accident and do a complete restart of the event. Several cars came into the pits to repair damage and would have to start at the rear of the field since they were considered to have pitted before the initial green flag. On the second attempt at the start, Ickler got the jump on Moffitt and quickly began to pull away from the field.
MacDonald, restarting on the outside of the front row, briefly took the lead by a nose on two restarts. Each time however, Ickler erased the lead and pulled out to a commanding lead. Ickler led four times for 146 laps. In addition, the victory gave Ickler a sercured spot in the postseason NASCAR Toyota All-Star Showdown - a spot reserved for winners of the NASCAR Camping World Series events in 2009.

NASCAR Camping World Series East-Tri-County 150.
Matt DiBenedetto took just two starts to find Victory Lane.
The 17-year-old Grass Valley, Calif., driver passed Austin Dillon on a back-and-forth battle following a green-white-checkered finish to Saturday night’s Tri-County 150 to earn his first career NASCAR Camping World Series East victory.
DiBenedetto, a Joe Gibbs Racing development driver, and Dillon, a Richard Childress Racing development driver, swapped the lead six times over the second half of the race. The event was stretched to 165 laps due to a pair of late cautions. DiBenedetto led four times for 75 laps, while Dillon led three times for 15 laps.
On the final restart, Dillon got the jump from the second spot to take the lead. DiBenedetto, however, was able to nose underneath as they came to the white flag and took the lead going into Turn 1 of the final lap.
Rookie Alan Tardiff earned his first Coors Light Pole Award earlier in the day and brought home his best finish with a third-place run. Jody Lavender took over the points lead with a fourth-place finish, while Patrick Long rounded out the top five.

Gheorghe Pohrib

Gheorghe Pohrib was a colonel of the Romanian firefighters. He organized the Romanian firefighter units after World War I and extended their role to cover other activities related to civil defense.
Reorganization of firefighter units.
The Romanian firefighter units were subordinated to the artillery regiments of the Romanian Army according to the provisions of Royal Decree No. 702 of 1874. In 1912, by Royal Decree No. 2222 of 1912 the “Inspectorate for Military Firefighters” (Inspectoratul Pompierilor Military) was created. Further reform was however stopped due to World War 1. 
Gheorghe Pohrib, an artillery officer, who had been assigned to the firefighters battalion of Bucharest in 1907, was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel (consequently colonel) and appointed inspector general of the firefighters in 1920. He had the responsibility of reorganizing the firefighter units and of unifying the structures in the newly gained provinces. 
As a result of colonel Pohrib’s endeavours, by 1929 the Romanian firefighters included following units:
At the same time Gheorghe Pohrib established the “Romanian Firefighters Newsletter” (Buletinul Pompierilor Români) which is still published, at present under the name “Revista Pompierii Români” 
Integration of firefighters into the civil defense structures.
Gheorghe Pohrib expanded the responsibility of the firefighters to other types of rescue operations. In 1928, the International Committee of the Red Cross raised for the first time the issue of creating structures in charge of the protection of civilian population against chemical attacks and of preparing regulations to deal with such events. A special commission for the study and proposal of measures for civil defense was instituted by order No. 513 of June 21, 1928 of the Ministry of War. The commission included colonel Gheorghe Pohrib, head of the firefighter department, colonel George E. Popescu, head of the department of defense against chemical warfare as well as representatives of various concerned ministries. After one year the commission presented its conclusions to the Council of Ministers who, on October 25, 1929, approved the proposed instructions, to which colonel Gheorghe Pohrib had contributed to a significant extent. This is the first legislation in Romania which created an organization for the protection of the civilian population in case of an armed conflict.
Colonel Gheorghe Pohrib had an essential contribution in preparing the legislation for civil defense (called “passive defense” at that time). Law No. 1245 of 1933 and Royal Decree 468 of February 28, 1933 defined the responsibilities of the firefighters in preparation, mitigation and response in civil defense operations. As a result, the military firefighter unit were provided with special machinery, equipment, accessories and materials required for saving people trapped under wrecked buildings, for decontamination of poisonous gases, for the destruction of unexploded bombs, for alerting the population and for medical first aid. The day of promulgation of the Decree, February 28, has since been declared the “Day of Civil Defense”.
Colonel Gheorghe Pohrib continued his efforts to ensure the legal provisions required for the activities of the firefighters and was able to convince the authorities to approve Law 815 of April 3, 1936 for the Organization of the Corps of Military Firefighters. 
Pohrib retired in 1937 after having been commander of the Romanian military firefighters for over 17 years, the longest interval any firefighter chief ever held the position. The organization he set was to be tested and to prove its efficiency a few years after his retirement, in the years of World War II.
International activity.
Due to World War I, the activities of the International Technical Committee for the Prevention and Extinction of Fire – CNIF, which had been established in 1900, had practically been halted. An International Congress of Firefighters was organized on July 5, 1928 in Czechoslovakia with the objective of reorganizing the Committee. The discussions were continued the following year, on June 24, 1929, in Paris, where the congress approved the new bylaws of the organization and elected as chairman colonel Paul Pouderoux, commander of the Firefighters Regiment of Paris. In both congresses, Romania was represented by Colonel Gheorghe Pohrib. 
The following congress was organized in Paris on July 1–5, 1931, at the same time as the “First International Exhibition of Firefighting”. Romania was represented by colonel Gheorghe Pohrib, Commander of the Military Firefighters Corps and by Professor Valeriu Zaharescu, the chemical expert of the firefighters.
Other reunions of the organization, which Gheorghe Pohrib attended, were organized on July 1, 1934 in Paris and on July 8, 1936 in Vienna. In recognition of Gheorghe Pohrib’s contributions, on December 31, 1935, Paul Pouderoux, who had been advanced to the rank of general, awarded him an honor diploma of the CNIF.
Study of the history of Romanian firefighters.
In 1935 colonel Gheorghe Pohrib, in cooperation with lieutenant colonel N. Lupaşcu and captain P.V. Petăleanu published an extensive history of the Romanian firefighters, to commemorate 100 years since the creation of the first units of military firefighters in the Romanian Principalities. 
The volume presents the first firefighter units in Moldavia and Wallachia. It then emphasizes the battle of Dealul Spirii, during the Wallachian Revolution of 1848, when the firemen opposed the Ottoman army. He then presents the activities of the firefighters until 1935. The volume presents documents related to the organization of firefighters in Romania and also the most important fires in major Romanian cities in which the intervention of the firefighters was required.

2008 Victory Bowl

The 2008 Victory Bowl is a college football post-season bowl game. The game was played on November 21, 2008 at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Malone Pioneers from the NAIA played against NCAA Division III .
Malone failed to defend their title as the 2007 Victory Bowl winners on their third consecutive trip to the bowl. Northwestern's win was their second Victory Bowl championship and fourth appearance in the game's twelve-year history.
Game summary.
Northwestern and Malone University scored a combined 93 points as the Eagles from Northwestern claimed a 49-44 win. The contest was closely competed and it was not until under a minute remaining was the game’s outcome decided. Malone held a 28-14 lead midway through the second quarter, but after that the point differential remained within seven points or less until Northwestern’s Ty Crabtree ran an interception 50 yards for the Eagles’ final score of the game.

<doc id="20299576" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20299576" title="Caterham Graduates Racing Club">
Caterham Graduates Racing Club

Caterham Graduates Racing Club is a British motor-racing club for privateer racing drivers in Caterham Seven type cars.
History.
The Caterham Graduates Championship was started in 1998 by competitors from the 1997 Caterham Scholarship (subsequently Caterham Academy). For the first year it was called the Graduate 797 series (the first "7" for Caterham Seven, and "97" from the year that most drivers started competing). In its first two years, it was a multi-discipline series, with the rounds being made up of sprints (single car on track, against the clock), hillclimbs, and circuit races, similar to the Caterham Scholarship format. The emphasis moved more and more towards circuit races, and from 2000-on the series has been entirely circuit races.
In 2001, following the Caterham Academy's change to Rover-engined cars, the championship launched a second class named Super Graduates, based upon an uprated K-Series Academy car. 
In 2003, the Super Graduates class was further upgraded and renamed the Mega Graduates. A replacement Super Graduates class was created to accommodate standard ex-Academy cars with Rover K-series engines. 
In 2007, the "Graduates" class was rebranded "Classic Graduates".
In 2010, Ford Sigma-engined cars were introduced as a sub-class of Super Graduates. From 2011 onwards, the Sigma cars have been a separate, 4th championship class.
In 2013, a 5th championship class was introduced for variants of the Ford Sigma-engined cars - Sigmax. This allows suspension and engine upgrades in line with the Caterham Tracksport and Supersport series. 
The series is one of the largest in the UK, if not the largest, with well over 100 registered competitors. The competitors come from a variety of backgrounds - a number have "graduated" from the novice Caterham Scholarship and Academy series, whilst many others have made it their first foray into motorsport.
Racing.
The Caterham Graduates race series takes place over a number of races meeting each year at UK and European motor racing circuits. The races are usually run over 20–30 minutes and the leading car across the line after the time has expired is the winner. Each class generally races on a separate grid, the exception being races held at Spa-Francorchamps, where all classes start together on a 65-car grid. The events are typified by close wheel to wheel racing, often having several lead changes on the same lap.
In Super Graduates and Mega Graduates, points are awarded thus: 40 for a win, 39 for 2nd place, 38 for 3rd place, right down to 2 points for finishing 39th or lower. It is 30 points for a win in Classic Graduates and Sigma Graduates, as they generally have slightly smaller grids. And even a driver who fails to finish will still earn one point. At the end of the season, drivers drop their lowest three scores, to allow for missing a race or two, or a "DNF" (did not finish).
In addition to the standard MSA motorsport rules, the club operates a Driving Standards function which ensures that the close racing is fair and safe for all.
The club's racing is organised through the BARC.
Car Specifications.
The cars in the series are genuinely road-going, although Mega Graduates spec is moving away from this with the deletion of lights, and indeed a few are driven to and (hopefully) from races. Many are used by drivers mid-week for transport to work and for shopping, needing no more than the covering up of competition numbers to make them road-legal. No changes from the standard specification are allowed, putting the emphasis firmly on driving ability rather than car development and set-up. Along with low consumable costs, this keeps the costs of running a car very much under control, making it one of the most cost-effective ways to go racing. The large grid sizes are a testament to this low-cost formula.
Current classes are:
Classic Graduate.
1600cc Ford or Vauxhall engined Caterham Sevens with a live axle, from the Caterham Scholarship or Academy 1995 - 2000. These cars are fully road legal and produce around 100 bhp.
Sigma Graduate.
1600cc Ford Sigma-engined cars from the 2008 Caterham Academy onwards or 2009/10 Roadsport B. The only significant permitted changes are a swap to stickier Yokohama A048R tyres and an optional rear anti-roll bar. The cars have independent DeDion rear suspension, produce around 120 bhp and are fully road-legal.
Super Graduate.
1600cc Rover K-series Caterham Sevens with DeDion rear suspension from the Caterham Academy 2001 - 2007 or Roadsport B up to 2008. A current "Roadsport A" spec car can be converted into a Super Graduate relatively easily and at low cost. These cars are fully road legal and produce around 125 bhp.
Sigmax Graduate.
Uprated 1600cc Ford Sigma-engined cars from the 2008 Caterham Academy onwards or 2009/10 Roadsport B. No lights or windscreen, widetrack suspension, controlled engine upgrades and lightened flywheel.
Mega Graduate.
Uprated 1600cc Rover K-series Caterham Sevens with independent (DeDion) rear suspension from the Caterham Academy 2001 - 2008. These cars are semi-road legal (no lights or windscreen) and with controlled modifications produce around 140 bhp.
All classes run on Yokohama road legal tyres. Classic Graduates race on MSA list 1A A539s, whilst Sigmas, Supers, Sigmax and Megas use the stickier list 1B A048R (medium compound)
Affordability and Technical Support.
Affordability is a key ingredient to Caterham Graduates racing. Strict regulations allow only limited modifications and work on the sealed engines is limited to nominated engine builders - McMillan Motorsport and - for Sigmas and K-series only - Caterham Cars.
Other ways the club promotes affordability include limiting the amount of tyres the drivers can use through the season, providing race-day catering as part of the drivers' membership fees, and encouraging drivers either to stay on-site at the circuits or in budget hotels locally.
Race Numbers.
Race numbers 1 - 49 go to Mega Graduates, 51 - 69 to Sigma Graduates, 71 - 99 to Classic Graduates, 101 - 149 to Super Graduates and 151-199 to Sigmax Graduate cars.
The lower race numbers represent a driver's performance in the previous season, as the first ten numbers in each class are reserved for those finishing in the previous year's top ten. For instance, Ian Anderson's number 171 indicates that he came 1st in Sigma Graduates in 2011. Higher numbers go to those who are new to the championship or class.
Champions.
2013 SigMax Champion was Jeremy Webb, Mega Graduate Champion was Jamie Ellwood, again. The Super Graduates Championship was won by Dylan Stanley, Sigma Graduates was won by Amanda Black, and Classic Graduates Champion was Graham Smith.
Sponsors.
The series is run in association with McMillan Motorsport. About a dozen or so other companies have their branding across each of the 100-plus racecars, and on the club's website www.graduates.org.uk.

Robert Gundlach

Robert W. Gundlach (September 7, 1926 – August 18, 2010) was an American physicist. He is most noted for his prolific contributions to the field of xerography, specifically the development of the modern photocopier. Gundlach helped transform the Haloid Company, a small photographic firm, into the thriving Xerox Corporation. Over the course of his 42 year career with the company, he contributed over 155 patents, making photocopying technology more affordable and practical. In 1966 Gundlach was named Xerox’s first Research Fellow, the highest non-managerial that could be achieved by a Xerox scientist. After his retirement in 1995, he was granted several patents associated with his hobbies, including a snow-making system and a special backpack.
Biography.
Early years.
Robert Gundlach was born in 1926 in a small town several miles outside Buffalo. He worked on a farm across the street from his house for twelve and a half cents an hour – a dollar a day for eight hours of work. His father, Emanuel Gundlach, was a chemist responsible for inventing Wildroot Cream-Oil, a hair preparation. Emanuel’s first batch of Cream-Oil was rejected by Wildroot executives, but after a few modifications, the invention was a success. Bob spent one summer of his teenage years working for Wildroot, mixing Cream-Oil at a factory in Buffalo. Bob’s grandfather was a minister in the German Reformed Church, and preached in German in upstate New York. Emanuel and his family instead became involved with the Quaker-like pacifist organization called the Fellowship of Reconciliation.
Education.
Gundlach attended the University at Buffalo, but was drafted just after the end of World War II following his freshman year. He spent a year in conscientious objector camps, and promptly returned to school. Back at the University at Buffalo, he switched his initial chemistry major to graduate with a physics degree in 1949. Gundlach spent two years in graduate school, but never completed his PhD.
Early career.
Although he was a successful physicist, Gundlach experienced difficulties finding a job due to his pacifistic beliefs. Companies he applied for weren’t interested in physicists who did not do war work. He was briefly hired at Durez Plastics and Chemicals, where he worked in the plastic company’s physical testing laboratory. In 1952, Gundlach learned from an old University at Buffalo classmate of his that a small photographic firm in Rochester was hiring. He applied for a job with the Haloid Company, and was hired after receiving an exceptional score on a written physics test. After Joe Wilson, the firm’s president, promised that work on military projects would never be required, Robert readily accepted the job. He would go on to devote many years of hard work and passion into the company, contributing countless ideas and helping the small firm grow into a corporate giant.
Haloid Company.
The fairly new Haloid Company originally manufactured photographic paper and equipment. When Robert Gundlach joined, he discovered that much of their xerographic research was accident based. Instead of working in a modern laboratory, Gundlach experimented in the cramped attic of an old house in a working-class neighborhood. There were very few titles and little organizational structure within the physicists. Gundlach made his impact within the company quickly, coming up with three patentable ideas in his first year with Haloid. Before Robert joined the company, xerography was good at copying thin lines and characters, but could not successfully reproduce large, solid black areas. Solid areas came out looking washed-out because of a difference in electric potential between exposed and unexposed surface areas on a photoreceptor. Along edges, the potential difference was high and allowed excellent image reproduction, but in solid areas, the low potential difference caused faded images. Gundlach invented the Tone Tray, a grounded metal plate placed directly above the photoreceptor to create a constant potential difference between the plate and every part of an image. This invention alone brought the company enough profits in one year to pay all the salaries in the physics department.
Gundlach continued his research and experimentation in the field of xerography, developing a process that allowed many copies to be produced from a single image. Early photocopiers were slow and impractical, requiring several minutes to copy and reproduce a single document. Gunchlach’s process significantly increased the speed of the photocopier and paved the way for its commercial success.
In 1955, Haloid transformed its photo-paper warehouses into showrooms for its Xerox machines and hired several hundred sales and service people. In 1956, the president of the company formed an overseas partnership with a British film company called the Rank Organization. This partnership would become Rank Xerox, expanding the market of photocopiers overseas to Europe. In 1960, the Xerox 914 copier was introduced to the market and became an instant hit, propelling the company to unsurpassed heights.
Xerox Corporation.
The Xerox 914 was the first marketable automatic and plain-paper copier. This machine could produce a good quality copy in under a minute. Although it was large and weighed 650 pounds, businesses had high demand for the efficient copier. Small businesses could lease it on a monthly basis, making xerography affordable to startup companies. The 914 was a huge success, exceeding Haloid’s most optimistic projections, and creating a huge market demand for the product. In 1961 Haloid was listed on the New York Stock Exchange and changed its name to the Xerox Corporation. Xerography accounted for most of the company’s profits, and photography operations were placed under the new Haloid photo division. The Xerox Corporation expanded internationally, opening subsidiaries in Mexico, continental Europe, Japan, and Australia. By 1968, the Xerox 914 led the company to over $1 billion in sales. With the debut of the 914, Xerox was granted 15-year exclusive patent rights to xerography. These rights, along with millions of dollars spent for product development, allowed Robert Gundach to refine photocopiers undisturbed. He developed more improvements and was quickly promoted within the company. In 1963, Gundlach was one of the company’s first four Senior Scientists. In 1966, he was named Xerox’s first Research Fellow, and in 1978, he was appointed Senior Research Fellow. One of his most significant inventions was tri-level xerography, a process that allows the printing of two colors in a single pass, achieving perfect registration and greater speed than earlier methods.
Later years.
After his retirement from the Xerox Corporation in 1995, Gundlach concentrated on his hobbies. His house contained a self-invented heating and cooling system which only costs about $600 per year to operate. He also held patents for a shadowless sundial, a snowmaking process, an extremely comfortable backpack, and a cheap 20,000 Volt electrostatic generator. Gundlach continued to invent, and his lifetime contributions were recognized by the National Inventors Hall of Fame when he was inducted in 2005.
Gundlach died on August 18, 2010 from aspiration pneumonia.

Carl Hovde

Carl Frederick Hovde (pronounced HUV-dee; October 11, 1926 – September 5, 2009) was an American educator who from 1968 until 1972 was the Dean of Columbia College, the undergraduate division of Columbia University. In that position, he served an important role in restoring order and calm on the campus after the six-week long student protests in spring 1968 that had been led by the Students for a Democratic Society.
Early life and education.
Hovde was born in Meadville, Pennsylvania on October 11, 1926. His father, Bryn Hovde, was president of the New School for Social Research from 1945 to 1950. He enlisted in the United States Army in 1944 after graduating from high school and served in the European Theater of Operations during World War II. After completing his military service, he attended Columbia College, graduating with a bachelor's degree in philosophy in 1950. He was awarded a Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1955. He began his academic career with a position at The Ohio State University.
Columbia University.
Hovde joined the Columbia University faculty in 1960 as a professor of comparative English literature. He was appointed as the dean of Columbia College in July 1968 under a process designed to assuage students in the wake of the recent protests, in which he was approved by Columbia President Grayson L. Kirk after being nominated by a committee composed of administrators and faculty members.
The students protests had begun in April 1968 in response to plans by Columbia to construct a gym in Morningside Park that was opposed by Harlem residents and by disclosures of university ties to the Institute for Defense Analyses, a weapons research think-tank connected with the United States Department of Defense. Several buildings on the campus were taken over, with windows damaged and files destroyed by student protesters. Police cleared out and arrested on charges of criminal trespassing a group of 700 students, but the protests persisted for weeks.
At the start of the protests, Hovde served on a faculty group that established a joint committee composed of administrators, faculty and students that established recommendations for addressing disciplinary action for the students involved in the protests. Once he was appointed as dean, Hovde stated that he felt that the "sit-ins and the demonstrations were not without cause" and opposed criminal charges being filed against the students by the university, though he did agree that the protesters "were acting with insufficient cause".
Hovde served as dean when the core curriculum underwent fundamental changes. Following his tenure as dean, the "Columbia Daily Spectator" credited Hovde with having "sought to quietly guide the college, not to rule it; to use the force of persuasion and reason, not the blunt power of authority". He later was a professor of English emeritus after a career as a longtime teacher of literature humanities. He received the Great Teacher Award from the Society of Columbia Graduates in 1975. After his retirement in 1995 he served as chair of the Friends of the Heyman Center and also is a member of the Society of Senior Scholars. Professor Hovde received the Award for Distinguished Service to the Core Curriculum in 1997-1998.
Death.
Hovde died at age 82 of lung cancer on September 5, 2009 at his wife's home in New Canaan, Connecticut. He was survived by his wife, Bertha Betts, two daughters, a son and four grandchildren. He had divorced his first wife, the former Jane Norris.

Agustín Viesca

Agustín Viesca (1790–1845) was a governor of the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas in 1835. He was the brother of José María Viesca, also a governor of Coahuila y Tejas during 1827-1831.
As Mexican President Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna began consolidating power in early 1835, the state government of Coahuila y Tejas defied his orders. In May, the army, which supported the government's new centralist policies, invaded the capital, Saltillo, and dissolved the state government. As their last official act, the legislature authorized the governor to temporarily appoint any other city in the state as the capital. Viesca immediately designated San Antonio de Bexar as the focus of the state government and issued a proclamation asking the people of Mexican Texas to arm themselves in support of the now overthrown Constitution of 1824.
Viesca and members of the government gathered important documents from the state archives and began the journey overland to San Antonio. They were caught and arrested near the Rio Grande. Later in the year, Viesca and his party were liberated by rebels under Colonel Jose Maria Gonzales. The group continued their journey into Texas, but rather than travel directly to San Antonio they took a coastal route towards Goliad, where Texians had recently gained control of Presidio La Bahia. After leaving San Patricio, Viesca met Texian troops led by Ira Westover, who had recently defeated another Mexican force at the Battle of Lipantitlan.
Westover escorted Viesca and his party to Presidio La Bahia. At that time that he arrived, the Texians had just convened the Consultation, a provisional government that was trying to determine if the Texians were fighting for the reinstatement of the Constitution of 1824 or for independence from Mexico. Although Viesca assumed that he would resume his position as leader of the area, La Bahia commander Philip Dimmitt was unsure how to receive the governor. Dimmitt sent a military escort to escort the party in with military honors and offered an official reception inside the fort. However, he wrote to Texian Army commander Stephen F. Austin that as "I did not conceived myself duly authorized to receive this gentleman in an official capacity, no such reception was either given or intended." Austin was very angry with Dimmitt's actions and on November 18 ordered Dimmitt removed from his command with no hearing. Viesca and his men journeyed to San Felipe de Austin, where the Consultation also refused to recognize his authority.

Global Gender Gap Report

The Global Gender Gap Report was first published in 2006 by the World Economic Forum. The 2013 report covers 136 major and emerging economies (navigate a map of the Global Gender Gap index). The Global Gender Gap Index 2013 is the result of collaboration with faculty at Harvard University and the University of California, Berkeley.
Methodology.
The report’s Gender Gap Index ranks countries according to their gender gaps, and their scores can be interpreted as the percentage of the inequality between women and men that has been closed. Information about gender imbalances to the advantage of women is explicitly prevented from affecting the score. 
The three highest ranking countries have closed over 84% of their gender gaps, while the lowest ranking country has closed only a little over 50% of its gender gap. It “assesses countries on how well they are dividing their resources and opportunities among their male and female populations, regardless of the overall levels of these resources and opportunities,” the Report says. “By providing a comprehensible framework for assessing and comparing global gender gaps and by revealing those countries that are role models in dividing these resources equitably between women and men, the Report serves as a catalyst for greater awareness as well as greater exchange between policymakers.” 
The report examines four critical areas of inequality between men and women in 130 economies around the globe, over 93% of the world’s population:
Thirteen out of the 14 variables used to create the index are from publicly available “hard data” indicators from international organizations, such as the International Labour Organization, the United Nations Development Programme and the World Health Organization.

Kikukawa Eizan

In Japanese name, Kikukawa is family name for Kikikawa Eizan
This artist should not be confused with Harukawa Eizan, a designer of ukiyo-e woodblock prints who was active in the 1790s.
Gallery.
Eizan was the most prolific, longest-lived and ultimately the best of the late followers of Utamaro, who attempted to carry on the master's bijin style after his death in 1806.
Along with Kikumaro, Tsukimaro and Utamaro II, Eizan has generally been dismissed by connoisseurs as a plagiarist of Utamaro's late style, but his work in fact develops, like that of most ukiyo-e artists, from a close identification with a leading master to a studied independence, and contains pieces of remarkable beauty and interest.
ukiyo-e artists with whom he is often associated, Eizan was not an actual pupil of Kitagawa Utamaro, but studied originally with his father, Kikugawa Eiji, a Kano style painter and fan maker, and later with the Shijo artist Suzuki Nanrei and the Hokusai pupil Hokkei. Few traces of this eclectic training can be seen in Eizan's early work, produced shortly after the death of Utamaro and for the most part in that master's style.
In the following decade, however, as Eizan reached artistic maturity, he began to develop his own figural style, still focused for the most part on prints of beautiful women (bijin-ga). Eizan's work retains the sensitivities and lyricism that marks the Utamaro style, however, not following the earthier realism and more overt sensuality of Kunisada and Ikeda Eisen in their .
Eizan, like Toyokuni I in actor prints, is the last manifestation of the classical ukiyo-e style in bijin work, with harmonious colors and graceful lines and subjects. After him, one senses the introduction of a different aesthetic, with harsher colors, angular lines and less ethereal material, more of an emphasis, in sum, on the material weight of earthly life, rather than its transformation into something of elegance.
With Eizan, the alchemy of elegance is still alive, and in his best work, properly produced, he can cast a magic glow over the forms of the world and create lightness and grace.
He is also left-handed, which was strange at such a time in Japan.

USS Gardiners Bay (AVP-39)

USS "Gardiners Bay" (AVP-39) was a United States Navy seaplane tender in commission from 1945 to 1958.
Construction, commissioning, and shakedown.
"Gardiners Bay" was launched on 2 December 1944 at Houghton, Washington, by the Lake Washington Shipyard, sponsored by Mrs. George L. Richard. She commissioned at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard at Bremerton, Washington, on 11 February 1945, with Commander Carlton C. Lucas in command.
"Gardiners Bay" departed Seattle, Washington, on 1 March 1945 for shakedown out of San Diego, California, which she completed on 20 April 1945.
World War II service 1945.
"Gardiners Bay" then proceeded via Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, to Eniwetok in the Marshall Islands to tend seaplanes of Patrol Bombing Squadron (PBV) 19 in a 10-day training period, thence via Saipan and Guam in the Mariana Islands to Kerama Retto, Okinawa, where she arrived on 7 June 1945 with provisions and cargo for Fleet Air Wing 1.
"Gardiners Bay" devoted the following weeks to tending planes for various patrol bombing squadrons based on Kerama Retto. Between 30 June 1945 and 17 July 1945 she was flagship of an Air-Sea Rescue Unit, utilizing Rescue Squadrons 3 and 4, Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron 4, and three other small seaplane tenders. Eighteen rescue missions were accomplished while in a state of constant alert that saw her men at general quarters for 100 hours.
Relieved as flagship by seaplane tender USS "Pine Island" (AV-12) on 17 July 1945, "Gardiners Bay" tended planes of Rescue Squadron 6 at Chimi Bay, Okinawa, until 15 August 1945, the day hostilities with Japan ended, when she put to sea as part of the screen of the United States Third Fleet en route Japan.
"Gardiners Bay" received two battle stars for service in World War II.
Peacetime service 1945-1950.
"Gardiners Bay" entered Sagami Bay, Japan, on 28 August 1945, shifting on 30 August 1945 to Tokyo Bay as a part of the Seaplane Base Group of the Japan Occupation Forces. On 1 September 1945 she became flagship of the Air-Sea Rescue Unit for the Third Fleet with Rescue Squadron 4 based on board. During this service, which extended to 9 January 1946, she helped set up the Tokyo Seadrome off the Yokohama Air Station. She was then stationed at Nagoya, Japan, as tender for courier and transient seaplanes, departing on 29 January 1946 for Shanghai, China. She departed Hong Kong on 9 August 1946, proceeding via Yokosuka, Japan, the Mariana Islands, the Marshall Islands, and Pearl Harbor to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, where she arrived on 28 November 1946 for overhaul.
After fleet exercises along the United States West Coast, "Gardiners Bay" departed San Diego on 7 April 1947 for seaplane tender duties in the Caroline Islands; Mariana Islands; Okinawa; Tsingtao, China; and Yokosuka. She returned to Seattle on 4 October 1947, made a cruise to Eniwetok in the Marshall Islands between 15 January 1948 and 5 June 1948, and made another Far East cruise between 15 March 1949 and 14 December 1949 which included seaplane tender operations at Guam; Yokohama, Japan; Sasebo, Japan; Okinawa; and Manila, the Philippines.
Korean War service 1950-1953.
"Gardiners Bay" departed San Diego on 27 June 1950 for the first of four long tours supporting United Nations forces in the Korean War. She established a seadrome at Iwakuni, Japan, tending 17 Martin PBM Mariner and eight Royal Air Force Short Sunderland flying boats for search and reconnaissance in the Tsushima Strait and Yellow Sea area, shifting in September 1950 to Inchon, Korea, where she established an advance base for seaplanes making naval mine reconnaissance runs off the northwest coast of Korea. In October 1950 she established another seadrome at Chinhae, Korea, basing there to tend United States Seventh Fleet aircraft conducting reconnaissance until 16 April 1951.
On her second Korean tour, which lasted from 12 September 1951 to 9 April 1952, "Gardiners Bay" supported Far East aviation patrol units at Okinawa; Iwakuni, Japan; and Manila, Philippine Islands.
"Gardiners Bay" spent her third Korean War tour, which lasted from 10 July 1952 to 26 January 1953, largely as station ship off the Pescadores and at Okinawa. She took time out from this duty in October 1952 for participation in Exercise Surprise off the coast of French Indochina, testing communications between headquarters and ships and aircraft of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France.
"Gardiners Bay"s fourth Korean War tour, which lasted from 3 April 1953 to 12 December 1953, was spent in tending amphibious patrol planes at Chinhae, South Korea, and on stations in the Pescadore Islands, the Philippine Islands, Okinawa, and Japan. The Korean War ended during this tour, in late July 1953.
"Gardiners Bay" received four battle stars for service in the Korean War.
Peacetime operations 1954-1958.
After returning from her fourth Korean War tour in December 1953, "Gardiners Bay" made three cruises to support Seventh Fleet operations in the Pacific, from 7 July 1954 to 22 November 1954, from 28 August 1956 to 14 February 1957, and from 10 June 1957 to 16 November 1957. She spent these cruises largely on seaplane tending stations at Okinawa; Manila; and in the Japanese ports of Iwakuni, Sasebo, and Yokohama.
"Gardiners Bay" returned from her last cruise in U.S. Navy service on 16 November 1957, arriving at Alameda, California. She decommissioned on 1 February 1958.
Royal Norwegian Navy service 1958-1974.
"Gardiners Bay" was transferred to Norway on 17 May 1958 under the Military Assistance Program. She served the Royal Norwegian Navy as a naval cadet training ship under the name of HNoMS "Haakon VII" (A537) until disposed of in 1974, making voyages worldwide during her Norwegian service.

UpStage

UpStage is an open source server-side application that has been purpose built for Cyberformance: multiple artists collaborate in real time via the UpStage platform to create and present live theatrical performances, for audiences who can be online (from anywhere in the world) or in a shared space, and who can interact with the performance via a text chat tool. It can also be understood as a form of digital puppetry.
History and context.
UpStage was developed during 2003 by programmer Douglas Bagnall, to realise the vision of cyberformance troupe Avatar Body "Collision"; the group had been creating live performance on the internet using free chat applications such as iVisit and the Palace, and wanted to create an application that better met their artistic needs. The first version of the software was created with a grant from the Smash Palace Collaboration Fund, a joint initiative of Creative New Zealand and the NZ Ministry for Research, Science and Technology; it was launched in January 2004 and began to be used by artists and students around the world, as well as by the originators, Avatar Body "Collision".
In 2006, the School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences at the Auckland University of Technology began a relationship with the UpStage project, which has seen teams of final year software development students work on UpStage as a real-world software development project. This has provided invaluable ongoing maintenance and development for the software.
Also in 2006, UpStage received a second grant, this time from the Community Partnership Fund of the New Zealand government's Digital Strategy, which enabled the development of UpStage V2. Douglas Bagnall was once again the lead developer, working this time in conjunction with the AUT students. UpStage V2 was launched in June 2007, with a two-week exhibition at the New Zealand Film Archive and the first UpStage festival, 070707. The festival featured 13 performances by artists from around the world and took place over a 12 hour period on 7 July 2007. 
A second festival was held on 080808 (8–9 August 2008), this time covering an 18 hour period and involving artists from at least 14 time zones. It was reviewed in the Australian Stage Online.
Features of UpStage.
As a web-based server-side application, UpStage can be accessed by both performers and audiences from almost any internet connected computer, using any operating system and browser; computers behind firewalls may require specific ports to be open, and the browser must have the Flash player plug-in as this is used to serve the media to the browser.
"Players" (performers) log into UpStage and have access to a "workshop" or backstage area where they can upload media (graphics and audio), create "stages", and assign media to stages. Once on the stage, a logged-in player has access to numerous tools which allow them to manipulate the media - place, move and speak aloud with graphical avatars (using text2speech), change backdrops, play audio files, draw directly on the stage in real time, add live web cam feeds, use text chat and perform other tasks in order to create and present a performance.
Audience members (also known as "chatters") do not log in - they simply follow a link from an email or another web page, and arrive at the stage which loads as a web page in their browser. They do not see any of the player tools, but they see and hear everything that the players are creating on the stage, and they can chat in the text chat along with the players. Audience chat appears grey and silent, while player chat is black and spoken aloud.
Newcomers (both players and audience) to UpStage can learn the basics very quickly, and the fact that no additional software download is required (unless the Flash player plug-in is not already installed) makes it very accessible. The chat interface encourages playful banter and audience members contribute to and embellish the performance via the chat.
The media used in UpStage performances is created outside of UpStage, using graphic or audio software. Once optimised for Upstage, it is then uploaded via the web interface known as the Workshop and becomes available to everyone who has a log in for that particular UpStage server.
UpStage is free and open source; it can be downloaded from the GitHub site and installed on a web server, giving control over who has log-in access. The interface can also be customised.

A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief

"A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief" (originally titled "The Stranger and His Friend") is a seven-stanza poem written in 1826 by James Montgomery. The words of the poem have since been adopted as a Christian hymn.
Origin and authorship.
Montgomery wrote "The Stranger and His Friend" in December 1826 while travelling in England on extended trips in horse-drawn carriages. Montgomery did not write the poem with the intention of it being set to music.
New York preacher George Coles set the poem to music he wrote. The hymn was adopted by some Christian congregations in the United States and the United Kingdom.
Latter Day Saints connection.
"A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief" was a favorite hymn of Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement. The hymn was introduced in the church by apostle John Taylor, who learned the hymn in 1840 as a missionary in England. Taylor included the hymn in the Latter Day Saints' "Manchester Hymnal", which was used in England from 1840 to 1912. The hymn was also included in the church's 1841 hymnal published in Nauvoo, Illinois. Unlike the version in the "Manchester Hymnal", the hymn in the Nauvoo hymnal included music composed by Taylor. The hymn was originally written as a Christmas hymn.
On the afternoon that Joseph Smith and his brother, Hyrum, were killed by a mob in prison in Carthage, Illinois, the Smiths requested Taylor sing the hymn twice.
After he became president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), Taylor asked Ebenezer Beesley to compose new music for the hymn. The results were published in the church's 1889 hymnal, and the hymn has been included in every subsequent edition of the church's hymnal. In the LDS Church's 1985 English-language hymnal, it is hymn #29.
The original tune John Taylor sung before the martyrdom became lost in the years following John Taylor's death. In 2008 a descendant of John Taylor found the original tune in the notebook of Ebeneezer Beesley, and then shared his findings with historian Jeffrey N. Walker. Walker then published his arrangement of the hymn with the tune as it was sung to Beesley.

Banchory Ternan East Church

Banchory Ternan East Parish Church is a congregation of the Church of Scotland, a member of the Presbyterian Church. The church building is located in Station Road, Banchory, Kincardineshire, Scotland. The church today serves the east parish of the town of Banchory in Royal Deeside.
History.
Over 1,500 years ago, Saint Ternan brought Christianity to Banchory with the erection of a monastery. As well as preaching the Christian gospel, he and his followers taught the local people farming, arts, and crafts. In AD 1143, the Abbot of Arbroath received a grant of land from William the Lion which extended as far as Banchory. A new settlement was created near the churchyard, and a church, school, and houses were built. 
From that period there was a continuous Christian presence in Banchory with several churches being built in succession. One such church was opened in 1664/65; the bell from this church now hangs in the old Watchtower in the graveyard. That church was demolished and a new one built in 1775, but it proved to be too small for the growing congregation and was dismantled in 1824. The stones were used in the construction of the present church in 1825. 
The 1825 church.
Although no written evidence that John Smith was the architect of Banchory Ternan East has been found, the style of the building is typical of his work. The ogee profile of the coping stones on the front boundary wall is his personal "trade mark" and is found on most of his buildings.
John Smith (1781–1852), known as "Tudor Johnie", was Aberdeen's first city architect. Most of his churches are in the Perpendicular Gothic style; Udny and Nigg are not unlike Banchory, while Aberdeen South in Belmont Street (now a theme pub), St Clement's in Footdee (closed), and Fourdon Parish Church are more grandiose exercise of the same genre.
The most interesting features of Banchory Ternan are its tower and the windows of the main church building. Like most towers built by Smith, it comprises four storeys entrance porch, gallery, belfry and clock stage, all surmounted by a castellated parapet with corner pinnacles. In Banchory, Smith has placed the clock stage topmost — it usually appears between the gallery and belfry levels — the restricted height of the tower may have dictated this. Here too, the pinnacles are small, purely decorative unlike the larger, structural and often highly decorated examples quoted above.
The windows of the sanctuary are in a Georgian Gothic style having the main outlines of the Perpendicular form but infilled with clear glazed casements in the Georgian manner. Substantial buttresses (to withstand the outward pressure of the side galleries) and corner pinnacles strengthen and enhance the otherwise plain exterior.
Internally, little of Smith's influence remains — the removal of the side galleries gives the church a squarish rather than an elongated Gothic "feel". The Chancel, an addition of 1928-30, echoes Smith's style in a somewhat lighter vein. The finely moulded chancel arch contains and sets off the excellent stained glass and the crisply detailed woodwork of the organ case and wall panels.
Ministers.
One former minister at Banchory Ternan East Church, the Very Rev George Hutchison, served as Moderator of the General Assembly in 1887.
The church today.
Today Banchory Ternan East Church is a thriving congregation with a wide range of activities for all ages. The Mission of the church is "To know Christ and to make Him Known" — "Our aim as God's people in this place, is to serve the Lord Jesus Christ, make his name and love known as widely as possible, and to seek to serve the community in which God has placed us". 
The minister of Banchory East Church is a Chaplain at Banchory Primary School, Hill of Banchory Primary School, Crathes Primary School, Banchory Academy and Bellfield Care Home.
In 2009, the congregation had a role of 636 members and adherents.

Schiffschul

__NOTOC__
Khal Adas Yisroel, usually referred to as the Schiff Shul, was the main Orthodox synagogue in Vienna prior to the Holocaust. The synagogue no longer exists since it was destroyed by the Nazis on Kristallnacht. A building that was adjacent to the Schiffshul and was part of its complex remains. 
A small shul currently exists in this building that is called "Bet Hamidrasch Khal Chassidim" and is led by Rabbi Avraham Yona Schwartz. The upper level of the building has been functioning as a yeshiva since the 1940s and is headed by Rabbi Michoel Pressburger. It also serves as temporary spiritual refuge to thousands of Jewish refugees from Iran who have transited through Vienna over the past 30 years. 
There is a memorial plaque at this site that states "This Jewish place of worship was destroyed by the Nazis in the pogrom of November 1938." 
The Synagogue was located on Grosse Schiffgasse 8 in the second district of Vienna known as Leopoldstadt.
History.
With the constitution of the Israelitsche Cultus-Gemeinde (official Jewish Community) in 1852, the shul was established. The first rabbi was Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Spitzer (d. 1894) who was elected in 1852. He was a son in law of the Chasam Sofer 1763-1839 (Rabbi Moshe Sofer). As such, the community had a direct connection to the Pressburg Orthodox Community. As the Reform contingent grew in influence Rabbi Spitzer led the observant orthodox breakaway congregation to a new location, which was built from 1858 to 1864. The new synagogue counted 750 seats (500 for men, 250 for women).
Rabbi Yeshaya Fuerst (d. 1943), succeeded Rabbi Spitzer in 1894. He was a disciple of the Ksav Sofer 1815-1872 (Rabbi Avrohom Shmuel Binyamin Sofer) and he too had close ties to the Pressburg Orthodox Community.
The Cantor of the shul prior to the Holocaust was Avrohom Braun who was hired in 1922. The shamash (sexton) was Reb Hersh Lipschutz who emigrated to the U.S. where he was active in the Vienner Shul (see below).
With the approach of the Holocaust and the Anschluss, on March 1938, Rabbi Fuerst fled for his life from Vienna and died in England in 1943. 
Some members of the persecuted community succeeded in reaching America and settled in Williamsburg. These refugees reestablished a kernel of the Vienner community in the then Agudath Israel headquarters on Bedford Avenue on May 15, 1941. They named the new congregation Khal Adas Yereim and invested great energy in its development. Like its antecedent, the Congregation prayed in Nusach Ashkenaz. In 1948 the Vienner Shul moved to a new building on Rodney and South 5th Street, and appointed Rabbi Yonasan Steif as its Rabbi. Due to the community's growth they moved in the mid 50s to a larger building on 27 Lee Avenue. Today the Williamsburg congregation bears little resemblance to its predessor due to the mostly Chassidic nature of the community. There is a branch of the Vienner shul in Borough Park at 1350 50th St.

Robert of Thornham

Robert of Thornham (or Robert de Turnham) (died 1211) was an English soldier and administrator. The namesake of his landowner father, he was the younger brother of Stephen of Thornham. Robert made his reputation in connection with the conquest of Cyprus in 1191 during the Third Crusade. On order of King Richard I, he led half the fleet in that battle. Subsequently, he was responsible for controlling the island when the Crusaders moved on, first jointly with Richard de Camville and then independently, when he defeated a group of Cypriot rebels. After he left Cyprus, Robert became more closely identified with Richard I. As the king's "familiaris", he carried Richard's equipment from the Holy Land to England. When Richard I was captured in 1192 in Vienna, among the terms of his release was the presentation of men to stand as "pledges" that the ransom would be paid. Robert was among these hostages, though evidently not for long, as he was back by the king's side in 1194 at Poitiers. Appointed Seneschal of Anjou, he served in France with Richard I, primarily in Anjou and Normandy, throughout the rest of Richard's reign. At around the same time, he was also appointed High Sheriff of Surrey, but he did not return to England until after Richard's death. In 1196, he led troops at Richard's behest into Brittany on an unsuccessful attempt to capture the child Duke of Brittany Arthur, whose mother Constance was resistant to Richard's control. In 1197, King Richard arranged for Robert to marry Isabella Fossard, daughter and heiress of the powerful Yorkshire baron William Fossard. The Fossard inheritance included the castle, honor, and lordship of Mulgrave with 34.5 attached knight's fees.
Robert was not with Richard at the siege of Château de Chalus-Chabrol in 1199, where Richard died, and after Richard's death became an important source of information about the activities of the king. After Richard's death, Robert ceremonially transferred Chinon castle to the new king, Richard's brother John. He traveled with John in Normandy and England for several years before he was appointed the Seneschal of Anjou and of Gascony in 1201. For the next several years he was troubled by conflict with the French and by rebellious barons in Poitou, which caused him to limit his efforts to his northern territories. In 1203, he made an effort to regain the city of Angers from the French, but though he partially destroyed the city he was unsuccessful and was captured. Ransomed in 1205, he continued to serve John, travelling with him during the Anjou campaign of 1206. From 1205 to 1207 he focused on his service as High Sheriff of Surrey before returning in 1207 to France as Seneschal of Poitou. He died on 26 April 1211 with the Bishop of Winchester at his deathbed.

Merridee Bujaki

Dr. Merridee Bujaki is an associate professor of accounting at the University of Ottawa located in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. In 2005, she became tenured as a full-time professor where she is now the manager of Accounting Studies as well as the section coordinator for Accounting, Finance and Information Systems. She is also the Secretary-Treasurer for the Association of Professors at the University of Ottawa and VP Communications for the Canadian Academic Accounting Association. Bujaki's primary activities are accounting and organizational behavior research.
Education.
In 1985, Bujaki graduated from Queen's University with a Bachelor of Arts Degree majoring in Psychology. In 1988, she received her Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree from Queen's University with a specialization in Accounting. In 1996, Bujaki graduated with her PhD degree with a dissertation topic related to Accounting and Organizational Behavior. She obtained her PhD from Queen's University. Although Bujaki spends a great deal of her time in research, some of her teaching interests include Auditing, Financial Statement Analysis, Financial Accounting, Managerial Accounting and Gender Issues in Management.
Work experience.
After graduating from her MBA program, Bujaki joined the Toronto office of international accounting firm Price Waterhouse. From 1988-1991, Bujaki worked in the Toronto office with Independent Business Service and the Mississauga office with general audit and assurance services. In 1989, she passed her Uniform Evaluation (UFE) and obtained her Chartered Accountant designation one year later. Throughout her academic career, she has worked on consulting projects for the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA). She has also served as a seminar leader and case reviewer for the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Ontario (ICAO) School of Accountancy.
Research Interests and Publications.
Dr.Bujaki's research interests are primarily concentrated in four areas. They include measurement and validity issues in accounting research, annual report disclosures, women in management and the work-family interface. Bujaki's articles have been published in many journals, including the Journal of Accounting Literature, Canadian Accounting Perspectives, Women in Management Review and Applied Psychology: An International Review. She has also published articles in profession-based periodicals such as CA Magazine and CMA Magazine. Currently, she is focused on researching accounting and managerial perspectives for the development of the Rideau Canal.
Disclosure Practices.
Bujaki and fellow researcher, Brian McConomy, have found that most public companies will voluntary disclose their governance practices based on strategic factors. These strategic factors will affect the choice of disclosure medium (annual report vs management information circular) as well as extent of the disclosure. Some strategic factors include cost-benefit considerations, firm risk, and the number of external directors in a firm's board of directors. Bujaki and McConomy have also found that extensive disclosures are made after a governance failure, implying that disclosure practices are based on a "reactive" approach rather than "proactive" approach.
Women in Management.
Bujaki and fellow researcher, Carol McKeen, published an insightful article entitled "Hours Spent on Household Tasks by Business School Graduates". Bujaki and McKeen's findings suggest that household and family responsibilities negatively affect a woman's career success more than a male's career success. They also notice that the presence of children significantly increases time spent on household activities. With children, household tasks grows from 3 hours a week to 10 hours a week for male graduates while for female graduates it grows from 10 hours a week to 20 hours a week. Bujaki and McKeen suggest that organizational initiatives and changes in expectations within family and society are needed to effectively accommodate a graduates career success and their household responsibilities.
Rideau Canal.
In 2007, Bujaki received a $27,886 Research Development Initiatives grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC). This grant was given for her research program of the accounting and management history of the Rideau Canal. The report program is entitled "The Rideau Waterway: Management, Accounting, Governance and Accountability" and will study the evolution of management practices over the life of the canal.

Antong

Antong (or Hantum) () (1248–1293) was a prominent official of Kublai Khan, the Great Khan of the Mongol World. As a great-grand son of Muqali of the Jalayir clan, one of the greatest generals under Genghis Khan, he became an influential administrator in the administration of the Yuan Dynasty.
He was well educated in Confucian, and had accompanied Kublai since he was still a boy. After the enthronement of Kublai Khan in 1260, he was appointed the supreme leader of the imperial guards. In 1265, he was again appointed as the grand chancellor of the Zhongshusheng (, "Secretariat"), and actively supported Kublai Khan to adopt and honor Confucianism and Chinese court rituals, and opposed the influence of Ahmad Fanakati.
In 1275, he was dispatched to assist Nomokhan, a son of Kublai Khan, to confront the attacks of Kaidu from Central Asia. Unfortunately, he was captured due to the insurgency of his own underlings, and was given to the Mengu-Timur, khan of the Golden Horde, who in turn passed him on to Kaidu. He was not allowed to return to the Yuan Dynasty until 1284. However, he gradually lost the trust of Kublai Khan upon return, and died in 1293. After the enthronement of Temur (Emperor Chengzong), he was granted the title of the Prince of Dongping Zhongxian () in 1303.

Aboriginal Shire of Kowanyama

The Aboriginal Shire of Kowanyama is a special local government area which is located on western Cape York Peninsula in Queensland, Australia. It is managed under a Deed of Grant in Trust under the "Local Government (Community Government Areas) Act 2004".
History.
The area originally was set up as the Mitchell River Mission in 1916. Aboriginal people from the region were gradually drawn from their traditional lands into the mission settlement. Language groups associated with countries in the Kowanyama region are Yir Yoront, Yirrk Thangalkl, Koko Bera, Uw Oykangand, and Olkola.
In 1967 the Anglican church were no longer able to sustain their activities in the area as a Church Mission. The Department of Aboriginal and Islander Affairs, a government department, under the Act continued running the affairs of the community.
On 23 July 1987, under the "Community Services (Aborigines) Act 1984", a Deed of Grant in Trust was given to the Kowanyama community over the lands in the Mitchell River delta. Like other DOGIT communities of the time, Kowanyama had a town Council elected by Aboriginal people living in the community. The newly formed Kowanyama Council assumed responsibility for implementing certain conditions of the DOGIT. Seven elected Aboriginal residents hold three year terms in office.
Responsibilities.
As the Shire is not operated under the Local Government Act and operates the land on behalf of the community, the Shire Council's responsibilities are quite different from a typical local government body. This includes responsibility for fisheries, alcohol management and even operation of some commercial enterprises.

Raymerville Drive forms an U-shape, spanning across the community's eastern end to its western end. The road connects to Carlton Road on its southwestern end, and Manhattan Drive on its northwestern end. The Carlton-Raymerville corridor is one of the most important road corridors in Markham as this corridor spans large portions of the city, including the communities of Unionville and Raymerville - Markville East, and consequently, serves a large population within the city.

Bombus pascuorum

The Common Carder Bee ("Bombus pascuorum") is a species of bumblebee belonging to the family Apidae subfamily Apinae tribus Bombini.
They are present in most of Europe in a wide variety of habitats such as meadows, pastures, waste ground, ditches and embankments, road, field margins, as well as gardens and parks in urban areas and forests and forest edges.
The thorax is yellowish or reddish-brown. The first 4 abdominal segments have grayish hair, while the fifth and sixth tergite hairs are yellowish or reddish brown. However the species is quite variable in color.
The head is medium long, the snout long, reaching lengths of (Queen), (worker) and (drone). 
Queens appear between early April to mid-May, workers at the end of April/early May to mid-October. Young Queens and drones can be found from mid-August to late October. 
When Queens search for suitable places to nest, they fly just above the vegetation, for example on forest edges, investigating cavities such as holes in the ground or niches in dead wood and grass. The nests can be constructed above ground and underground, preferably in old mouse nests but also in bird nests as well as in barns and sheds.
Nest-building proceeds as follows. The Queen collects moss and grass to form a small, hollow sphere whose walls are partly bonded with wax and sealed off. Within this is formed a large bowl of brown wax of about five millimeters, which is filled with pollen. Thereafter 5 to 15 eggs are deposited, and the cell closed. Another 20 mm-high cup is then filled with nectar, thus serving as its own food reserve for bad weather days. After three to five days the larvae hatch to feed on the pollen. After about a week the larvae are mature.
The adult bees, owing to the initially poor supply situation, are relatively small, reaching only about half the body length of the Queen and lacking functioning ovaries. Later hatching bees are much larger. The additional nesting and brood care is dedicated solely to the Queen, which no longer leaves the nest. From August, rarely before, the first fully developed females, together with drones, are ready. Drones hatch from unfertilized eggs.
In August the "pascuorum" nest, with a diameter of up to , reaches a maximum population size from 60 to 150 individuals. Shortly after this peak, the population quickly decreases. With the Queen the entire nest dies, usually in September. Occasionally, individuals survive until October/November. Only the last-hatched females survive, to mate with males. Then they fly in search of a safe place for hibernation.
This polylectic bee feeds on a variety wild flowers, including Nettle (Urticaceae), Genuine Motherwort (Lamiaceae), Himalayan Balsam (Balsaminaceae), Cabbage Thistle, Knapweed (Asteraceae), Vetch, Red and White Clover (Fabaceae), Monkshood (Ranuncolaceae), fruit trees, etc.

6th Pennsylvania Cavalry

The 6th Pennsylvania Cavalry was a Union cavalry regiment during the American Civil War. They were known for their early use of 9-foot lances, and were called "Rush's Lancers."
History.
The regiment was raised during August and September 1861 from companies raised in Philadelphia, Montgomery and Berks counties by Richard H. Rush, who had been authorized to do so by Governor Curtin. Rush was appointed colonel of the regiment, with John H. M'Arthur as lieutenant colonel and C. Ross Smith and Robert Morris, Jr., as majors. At the suggestion of Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, the men were armed with Austrian lances. After several weeks of training in Philadelphia, the regiment was transferred to Washington, D.C., where it was assigned to the Cavalry Division of the Army of the Potomac.
The regiment served with the army during the Peninsula Campaign and Maryland Campaign, skirmishing many times but seeing no heavy fighting. During the Battle of Fredericksburg, it served as the provost guard for the Center Grand Division, guarding the bridges to the grand division's rear. It was absent during the Battle of Chancellorsville, participating instead in Stoneman's Raid.
In the May 1863, the regiment was rearmed with Sharps carbines and assigned to the Reserve Brigade of the 1st Cavalry Division. It fought in the Gettysburg Campaign and Mine Run Campaign. The following year, it fought in the Overland Campaign and Sheridan's Valley Campaign among the Valley Campaigns of 1864. In September, the regiment's original enlistments expired, and the unit was reorganized for an additional three years. Following the Appomattox Campaign, it was ordered to Washington, D.C., where it was consolidated with the 1st Pennsylvania Cavalry and 17th Pennsylvania Cavalry to form the 2nd Pennsylvania Provisional Cavalry. The combined regiment was sent to Louisville, Kentucky, where it was mustered out in August 1865.
The 6th Pennsylvania Cavalry had one Medal of Honor Recipient: Captain Frank Furness, commander of Company F. During the Battle of Trevillian Station (June 11–12, 1864), Furness "Voluntarily carried a box of ammunition across an open space swept by the enemy's fire to the relief of an outpost whose ammunition had become almost exhausted, but which was thus enabled to hold its important position," according to the citation for the medal, awarded on October 20, 1899.

Today.
In August 1861, members of First Troop, Philadelphia City Cavalry, were mustered in and organized into companies C and E of the 6th Pennsylvania
Cavalry for Federal service in the Civil War. Companies C and E were mustered out on 17 June 1865. The First Troop, Philadelphia City Cavalry (17 November 1774) is the oldest, continuously active Cavalry Troop in the US Army, currently serving as A TRP, 1st/104th CAV, Pennsylvania Army National Guard. The Civil War campaign streamers of the 6th Pennsylvania Cavalry currently fly from A Troop's guidon along with streamers ranging from the American Revolution to World War II. The Troop recently served in peacekeeping missions in Bosnia (2002-3) and the Sinai (2008). Numerous artifacts of the 6th Pennsylvania Cavalry are currently housed in the Troop's private museum which is currently closed due to construction.

Bjørnsletta (station)

Bjørnsletta is a station on the Kolsås Line of the Oslo Metro. It serves the residential area of Øraker in Oslo, Norway and is served by Line 2. The station opened on 17 August 2010 and replaced two former stations: Bjørnsletta (located at a different location) and Lysakerelven. Both these stations were closed in 2006 while the Kolsås Line was being upgraded from a light rail to a rapid transit. Bjørnsletta is from Stortinget.
History.
The first station named Bjørnsletta opened with the connection from the Kolsås Line to the Røa Line on 15 June 1942. It was originally called Sletta, meaning "The Plain", but the ministry protested and felt that the name was too generic. Since bears had been spotted in the area in 1852, it was decided to name it Bjørnsletta, meaning "The Bear Plain". A lower secondary school named Bjørnsletta was opened in 1981, though that school is located closer to the Åsjordet Station.
In 2006, the Kolsås Line was closed for renovations. Although connected to the Oslo Metro, the line had been built as a light rail and still had overhead wires, level crossings, low platforms and lacked automatic train protection. The upgrade allowed the metro to replace the aging T1300 trains with the new MX3000, and have longer six-car trains.
The construction was managed by Kollektivtransportproduksjon, who also owns the station. After the closing of Lysakerelven, Bjørnsletta is the last station on the Kolsås Line in Oslo, with the next station, Jar, being located in Bærum. The official opening of the station took place on 17 August 2010 by Mayor Fabian Stang, and the station will remain the terminal station of Line 6 until December, when Jar is scheduled to open.
Facilities.
The station is located on the Kolsås Line, from Stortinget, between the roads Bærumsveien and Sportsveien. The station is built along the old right-of-way, which limits the speeds along the line to . The station has two side platforms and is long enough for six-car trains. The station has ticket machines and has universal access.
Service.
Bjørnsletta is served by Line 2 of the Oslo Metro, operated by Oslo T-banedrift on contract with Ruter. The rapid transit serves the station every 15 minutes, except in the late evening and on weekend mornings, when there is a 30-minute headway.

Bombus lucorum

The white-tailed bumblebee ("Bombus lucorum") is a species of bumblebee that is widespread and common throughout Europe. However, the name has been widely used for many of a complex of nearly identical-looking or cryptic species of bumblebees. A recent review of all of these species worldwide has helped to clarify its distribution in Europe and northern Asia, almost to the Pacific. In the north it reaches the Barent's Sea. In southern Europe, however, it is an upland species, its distribution never quite reaching the Mediterranean.
Description.
"Bombus lucorum" is a large bumblebee, the queen having a length of and a wingspan of around . The workers are normally somewhat smaller. The species has a short proboscis (tongue). The predominating colour is black, with a pale yellow collar, another yellow band on the second tergite (abdominal segment), and a white tail. Both darker and paler forms exist.
Ecology.
The hibernating queen emerges very early, in southern Britain usually in March. The nest, which can be very large, up to 400 workers, is usually built underground, often in disused rodent nests. As many other bumblebee males, the males fly in a low patrolling circuit, depositing pheromones on grass to attract young queens. The bumblebee visits many flowers, including many garden plants, as lavender, Hebe, Rhododendron, deadnettles, thistles, and vetches.

United States presidential election in North Dakota, 2008

The 2008 United States presidential election in North Dakota took place on November 4, 2008 throughout all 50 states and D.C., which was part of the 2008 United States presidential election. Voters chose 3 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President.
North Dakota was won by Republican nominee John McCain by an 8.7% margin of victory. Prior to the election, most news organizations considered this a state McCain would win, or otherwise considered as a red state. The state has not been won by a Democratic presidential nominee since Lyndon B. Johnson's landslide election in 1964. Interestingly, polls showed Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama running unusually close in a state that gave George W. Bush a 27.4% margin of victory over John Kerry in 2004. In the end, McCain kept North Dakota in the GOP column but by a much smaller margin than Bush's landslide in 2004.
Campaign.
Predictions.
There were 17 news organizations who made state by state predictions of the election. Here are their last predictions before election day:
Polling.
Pre-election polls showed a complete toss up. The final 3 polls averaged gave Obama leading 45% to 44%, leaving a lot of undecided voters.
Fundraising.
John McCain raised a total of $184,405 in the state. Barack Obama raised $191,551.
Advertising and visits.
Obama and his interest groups spent $448,361. McCain and his interest groups spent $71,972. Obama visited the state once, in Fargo, North Dakota, while the Republican ticket didn't visit the state once.
Analysis.
North Dakota has been considered a reliably red state for the past 40 years, having voted for the Republican presidential nominee of every election since 1968. In 2008, however, polls taken before September surprisingly showed the two candidates running neck-to-neck. While the polls varied throughout the campaign, McCain's selection of the socially conservative Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska as his vice presidential running mate played well in North Dakota, a state that has the least nonreligious percentage of citizens per capita in the country. This changed when Sarah Palin was announced as John McCain's running mate in late August, as McCain then took a double digit lead in the state until October, when polling once again showed a close race between the two candidates in the Peace Garden State.
On Election Day 2008, however, McCain captured North Dakota by a fairly safe margin of approximately 8.60 points, despite the latest polling showing him just one point ahead of Obama. Still, the statewide result was significantly closer than in 2004 when Bush carried the state by a much larger margin of more than 27 percent. McCain did well throughout the western and central parts of the state, while Obama won several counties in the east including the most populous counties of Cass County (which contains the state's largest city of Fargo) and Grand Forks County (which includes the college town of Grand Forks.
At the same time, popular incumbent Republican Governor John Hoeven was reelected to a second term in a landslide three-to-one victory over Democrat Tim Mathern and Independent DuWayne Hendrickson. Hoeven received 74.44% of the vote while Mathern took in 23.53% and Hendrickson with the remaining 2.03%. Democrats, however, made gains at the state level, picking up three seats in the North Dakota House of Representatives and six seats in the North Dakota Senate.
Results breakdown.
By congressional district.
Due to the state's low population, only one congressional district is allocated. This district, called the At-Large district, because it covers the entire state, and thus is equivalent to the statewide election results.
Electors.
Technically the voters of North Dakota cast their ballots for electors: representatives to the Electoral College. North Dakota is allocated 3 electors because it has 1 congressional districts and 2 senators. All candidates who appear on the ballot or qualify to receive write-in votes must submit a list of 3 electors, who pledge to vote for their candidate and his or her running mate. Whoever wins the majority of votes in the state is awarded all 3 electoral votes. Their chosen electors then vote for President and Vice President. Although electors are pledged to their candidate and running mate, they are not obligated to vote for them. An elector who votes for someone other than his or her candidate is known as a faithless elector.
The electors of each state and the District of Columbia met on December 15, 2008 to cast their votes for President and Vice President. The Electoral College itself never meets as one body. Instead the electors from each state and the District of Columbia met in their respective capitols.
The following were the members of the Electoral College from the state. All 3 pledged to John McCain and Sarah Palin:

Marie Haydée Beltrán Torres

Marie Haydée Beltrán Torres (born 7 June 1955) is a Puerto Rican nationalist who was convicted and sentenced to life in prison for the 1977 bombing of the Mobil Oil Building in Manhattan that killed one person and injured several others. Torres was linked to the Fuerzas Armadas de Liberación Nacional (FALN), which claimed responsibility for the Mobil Oil bombing and numerous others. Supporters of Torres consider her a political prisoner. She was released on April 14, 2009.
Trial.
At her trial, Beltrán Torres refused the appointment of counsel, demanded to represent herself and then informed the district court that she would neither present a defense nor participate in the proceedings. Declaring her status as a prisoner of war, she stated that the court proceedings were "illegal" and that she had "committed no crime", and demanded that her case be tried before an international court.
She was refused her request and instead given a trial in which she had no legal representation, and was subsequently charged with "seditious conspiracy" (or attempting to overthrow the U.S government in Puerto Rico), and sentenced to life in prison.
In August 1997, The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied her appeal to vacate her sentence. Beltrán Torres claimed she was denied her constitutional rights under the Fifth, Sixth and Eighth Amendments.
Imprisonment.
Beltrán Torres was one of the first subjects of an experimental prison unit in Alderson, West Virginia. The High Security Unit (HSU) was a kind of prison within a prison, occupying a completely isolated unit of the Federal Correctional Institute. Allegations were made that the unit was an experimental underground political prison that practiced isolation and sensory deprivation. It was finally closed by a federal judge after two years of protest by religious and human rights groups.
According to reports, Beltrán Torres was denied adequate medical attention, and became sterile after prison officials refused treatment for an inflammation of the pelvis ongoing for five years, ignoring episodes of drastic weight loss and severe pains in her pelvis which did not permit her to stand up.

National Director Sr. Ruth Lautt, OP, Esq., told a reporter that she believes that the "one-sided, unbalanced approach" on the Middle East taken by many mainline churches is the result of "shallow understanding" of the Arab-Israel conflict. In 2008, Fair Witness worked with members of the United Methodist Church to stop the denomination from divesting from its investments in Israeli companies.

Quotes.
"The traditions that we of the present generation have inherited from those that founded and established this great national organisation are of perseverance in the face of even tremendous opposition, and today it stands acknowledged as the champion of the rights of the Indian people. Those traditions are dear to us and we cherish them. We know no extremists and we know no moderates, names that have been devised by "our enemies" to divide us. We know only one cause and we have only one purpose in view. Our demand is the demand of a United India, and so long as our rights are denied to us we shall continue the struggle! Unchained in soul-though manacled in limb Unwarped by prejudice- unawed by wrong, Friends to the weak and fearless of the strong". — Syed Hasan Imam - From the Presidential Address, I.N.C., - Session, 1918, Bombay (Special Session)

After years in different partnerships, Finger opened his own office from 1923 to 1944. 
Finger was the father of Joseph Seifter Finger, a landscape architect and golf-course designer also locally active.
Work.
Finger's major work is undoubtedly the 1939 Houston City Hall, designed in a "stripped classical" style. In response to criticism from Houston mayor R. H. Fonville, who wanted a style with more classical reference, Finger said, "Here in America we are rapidly developing our own type of architecture which is far above that of foreign countries. We are building for the masses, not the classes." 
Above the lobby entrance of the City Hall is a stone relief of two men taming a wild horse, symbolizing a community coming together to form a government to tame the world around them. This sculpture, and the twenty-seven other friezes around the building, were done by Beaumont artist Herring Coe and co-designer Raoul Josset. 
As the city's foremost Jewish architect in his time, Finger designed many Jewish landmarks, including the 1925 Congregation Beth Israel Temple, now the Heinen Theatre.

<doc id="20300272" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20300272" title="C. Vijayaraghavachariar">
C. Vijayaraghavachariar

Chakravarti Vijayaraghavachariar (18 June 1852 - 19 April 1944) was an Indian politician. He rose to prominence following his appeal against the charges alleging him to have instigated a Hindu - Muslim riot in Salem (now in Tamil Nadu). The legal battle and eventual victory in proving his innocence earned him the title The Lion of South India. 
He entered politics as a member of the Salem Municipal Council in 1882. His prominence in the national media and friendship with Allan Octavian Hume, a civil servant and reformer, led him to be invited to the first sessions of the Indian National Congress. Once within the Congress, he rose to serve as its president in 1920. 
He played a key role in framing the Swaraj Constitution. He also was part of the Propaganda Committee of the Congress and thus served in spreading the ideologies of the party to the masses. Apart from his role in the Congress, he also served as the president of Hindu Mahasabha, a Hindu nationalist party, in 1931.
Early years.
Vijayaraghavachariar was born on June 18, 1852 into a Vaishnavite Brahmin family in the village of Pon Vilaindha Kalathur, in the district of Chengalpattu in the state of Madras Presidency, in what was then the British Raj. His father, Sadagoparchariar, was a priest and raised his son as an orthodox religious believer. At a very early age, Vijayaraghavachariar was sent to a school in his village where he learned Sanskrit and the Vedas, the holy language and the scriptures of Hinduism respectively. His English education began when he was twelve. He joined the Pachaiyappa High School and passed out in 1870, ranking second in the Madras Presidency, the province that included most of South India. He joined Presidency College in Madras (now Chennai) the following year, graduated in 1875, and the same year was appointed a lecturer there. He was transferred to the Government College, Mangalore, and after three years resigned his post. Subsequently he joined the Salem Municipal College as a lecturer in English and mathematics.
Career as lawyer.
During his time in Salem Municipal College Vijayaraghavachariar took Law examinations privately without attending formal classes and qualified as a pleader in 1881.
Salem riot.
In 1882, a short time after Vijayaraghavachariar had set up practice in Salem an riot broke out in the city. Vijayaraghavachariar was charged for instigating the violence that led to demolition of a Mosque and was sentenced to prison for ten years. Nevertheless, he fought the charges in the Court of Law and finally proved his innocence. Fighting the case for those implicated in the Salem riots of 1882 made Vijayaraghavachariar famous overnight. Subsequently through his efficiency in advocacy he successfully pleaded to Lord Ripon for others who were sentenced for the riots to be released from Andaman Cellular Prison. Besides, he took objection to his being disqualified from the membership of the Municipal Council, Salem, of which he a member during the period of the riot. As a result of his appeal, he was not only reinstated in the Municipal Council, but was able to obtain from the Secretary of State for India a sum of Rs 100 as a nominal damage for removing him from the Municipal Council during the period. He also proceeded against the witnesses who falsely deposed against him and got them convicted. The Salem riots of 1882 made Vijayaraghavachariar famous overnight. The riot case was highly publicised in the Indian national media and newspapers hailed him as a great champion of civil liberties. Thus came to be called The Lion of South India and "The Hero of Salem".
Entry into politics.
Vijayaraghavachariar's entry into the public life began with his membership of the Salem Municipal Council in 1882. In 1895 he was elected to the Madras Legislative Council which body he served for 6 years, till 1901.
Indian National Congress.
When the Indian National Congress was started in 1885 Vijayaraghavachari attended the first convention as one of the special invitees. He was a close associate of A. O. Hume, the founder of the Congress. Even prior to December 1885, Vijayaraghavachariar had suggested to Hume that a national organization like the Indian National Congress which he was proposing to create should be political in outlook and at the same time should look into the economic and social needs of the masses. He felt that only then the influence of such a body could spread wide all over the country. He attended the Bombay session of the Congress and in 1887 he was one of the members of the committee which drafted the constitution of the Indian National Congress. He held high influence in the Congress that most of the early names in Congress history were either his friends or co-worker. His counsels and leadership were much sought after by the Congressmen of the early days. In 1899 (fifteenth session of the Congress, Lucknow) he was made a member of the Indian Congress Propaganda Committee. Through the Propaganda Committee he commanded a wide national influence and played a very key role in spreading the message of the Congress throughout the length and breadth of the country. It was as a result of the committee's work that multitudes were brought within the fold of the Congress.
Relationship with other Congress leaders.
Vijayaraghavachariar’s close associates in the Congress included Dadabhai Naoroji, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Dr. Ansari, Maulana Azad, Hakim Ajmal Khan, Lala Lajpat Rai, C. Rajagopalachari and Motilal Nehru. With the advent of Mahatma Gandhi's non-violent ideologies in the party, there was a rift in the Congress ranks between the old moderates and the new radicals. Vijiaraghavachariar was a Nationalist and the Moderate Congress policy did not appeal to his judgement. He, therefore, stood aloof from the Congress after the organisation split following Surat session. Nevertheless, he later joined to carry the message of Gandhi. The climax of his political career came when in 1920 he was elected to preside over the Indian National Congress Session at Nagpur, where Gandhi's advocacy of "Poorna Swaraj" through non-violent non-cooperation was debated and accepted. He, with his powerful oratory, gave many a wordy battle to C. R. Das and Motilal Nehru on the question of the Council Entry Programme drawn up by them. He was also in the vanguard of the opposition to the Simon Commission that toured the country in 1929. He took an active part in the Committee that met under Motilal Nehru to frame the Constitution for Congress. He appealed to the League of Nations to intervene and arbitrate in the Indian deadlock that proceeded after the Simon Commission. He considered that the League of Nations as the hope of humanity.
Constitution for Indian National Congress.
Earlier in 1913 he was elected to the Imperial Legislative Council with which he was associated till 1916. At Delhi he worked in close co-operation with great leaders like Madan Mohan Malaviya, Surendranath Banerjea and Gopala Krishna Gokhale. In the third session of the Congress was held at Madras in December 1887 which was presided over by Badruddin Tyabji a historic decision was taken to draw up the Constitution of the Indian National Congress. Vijayaraghavachariar was the leading member of this Committee. It was he who drafted the Constitution of the Congress which became the Swaraj Constitution for India. He performed this task with great care and ability and won the appreciation of all his colleagues.
Achievements and social outlook.
Vijayaraghavachariar advocated post-puberty marriage for women and also the right of a daughter to have a share in her father's property. He rendered great assistance to Swami Sharathananda in his work connected with the Anti-Untouchability League. His multi-sided personality also found expression in his participation in the organization of the Hindu Mahasabha. He presided over the All India Hindu Mahasabha Sessions at Akola in 1931. He was one of the two Vice Presidents of the Madras' Branch of the Passive Resistance Movement. Mahatma Gandhi was its President; the other Vice-President was G. Kasturi Ranga Iyengar, Editor of the Hindu. His powerful advocacy of the cause of labour and the non Brahmins bear ample testimony to the largeness of his heart. He was also munificent in his donations to causes dear to him. The Anti-Untouchability League and the Congress Propaganda Organization in England in its early days received liberal financial support from him. His life was filled with relentless struggle against Imperialism and economic and social distress. Though an anti-imperialist, he had lifelong friendship with some of the representatives of Imperialism in India, viz., Governors and Viceroys. Lord Ripon, Lord Curzon, Lord Pentland, Lord and Lady Hardinge, Sir Conran Smith and Sir William Meyer were his friends from the Imperialistic Bloc, while Eardley Norton, the great Advocate, who argued his Salem Riots Case and saved him from transportation to the Andamans, was his intimate friend. Edwin Montague, the then Secretary of State for India, commented that Vijayaraghavachariar was a vigorous thinker but with impractical ideas.
Last years.
Though the leadership of the Congress in South India, passed on from his hands to C. Rajagopalachari, he contented himself with giving periodic advice on matters of public importance through his regular contributions to the Madras journals. He died on April 19, 1944. After his death, his valuable collections were treasured in the Memorial Library and Lecture Halls in Salem specially constructed and named after him. His portrait hangs on the walls of Parliament of India.

After spending most of 1973 in the minor leagues, Borgmann was back in the majors for good in 1974. That season, he took over as the club's starting catcher, batting .252 in 128 games while leading all American League catchers with a .997 fielding percentage. After seeing his average slip to .207 in 1975, Borgmann lost the starting job to rookie Butch Wynegar in 1976. He spent four seasons as Wynegar's backup, then became a free agent.
Borgmann signed with the Chicago White Sox in 1980. After starting the season in the minors, Borgmann was called up in August to replace Ricky Seilheimer as the main backup to starting catcher Bruce Kimm. In September, he split time behind the plate with Marv Foley. Borgmann became a free agent again after the season.
In 1981, Borgmann signed a minor league contract with the Cleveland Indians, playing 11 games for their Triple-A farm club, the Charleston Charlies, ending his professional career.

Michael Kusugak

Michael Arvaarluk Kusugak (Inuktitut: ᐊᕐᕚᕐᓗᒃ ᑯᓱᒐᖅ); born April 27, 1948 in Repulse Bay, Nunavut (then the NWT), where he spent much of his childhood. He is a storyteller and a Canadian children's writer, who tells stories about Arctic and Inuit culture.
Kusugak currently lives in Rankin Inlet and spends his winters in Bowser, BC, on Vancouver Island. He has also worked as an educational administrator for Nunavut Arctic College. Michael Kusugak grew up living a traditional, nomadic Inuit life with his family. Every night, Michael pleaded with his grandmother to tell him a story, until she eventually gave in. In this environment, Michael’s love of storytelling was born.
In 1954, a plane arrived to take Michael and many of his friends away to residential school. The following year, Michael successfully hid when the plane came to take him and his friends away again. However, he returned the following year and became one of the first Inuit in the eastern Arctic to graduate from high school. He was educated in Yellowknife, Churchill and Saskatoon.
It wasn’t until Michael had his own children that he realized that there was hardly anything written for children about life in the Arctic, so he started telling them his grandmother’s stories. In the late 1980s, Robert Munsch visited a local school and stayed in the Kusugak household. Along with Munsch as a co-author, Michael wrote his first book, "A Promise is a Promise," published in 1988. Michael Arvaarluk Kusugak has been writing ever since. His books have been published in French, Korean, Japanese and Braille.
All of Kusugak's books, except for "T is for Territories", which is part of a non-fiction series, are illustrated by Vladyana Krykorka. Krykorka came to Toronto from Prague when the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia. She illustrated "A Promise is a Promise" in 1988, and since then has been to Nunavut many times to visit, photograph and paint the land and people. She has also written and illustrated a set of her own books depicting the land and animals of the north: "Arctic Land", "Arctic Sea", and "Arctic Sky". 
Ijiraq, a moon of Saturn, was named by astronomer John J. Kavelaars after encountering the term in one of Kusugak's books.
Reception.
Kusugak holds a unique place in Canadian children's literature, speaking from "the in-between of cultures" and finding common ground that relates to the very different parts of Canada. He is valued not only for the captivating content of his books, but also for his role as one of very few Inuit authors, and his commitment to sharing stories. Kusugak has to take stories that he naturally tells out loud in Inuktituk, and put them into writing in English. He rehearses his stories first out loud, and his books are praised for having "the well-worn feeling of an old, much-told tale".
Michael Kusugak is known for his power to keep large groups of kids captivated for long periods of time with his stories. He is a storyteller, not only a writer of children's books, and spends a lot of his time telling stories to children in schools and libraries. At these events, he doesn't read his books out loud; he tells stories that he heard as a child and stories from his own life.
His stories stimulate interesting questions and prompt classroom discussion. They seem to have a power in their unique nature and topics. A group of teachers who introduced their classes to Kusugak's books reported that their students were keenly interested in learning more about Canada. Rich discussions were held in classrooms and the children expressed pride in being part of such a large country with diversity in geography and people. They often asked challenging questions about life in the various regions of Canada.
Awards.
Winner of the Ruth Schwartz Award for Children’s Literature for ["Northern Lights: The Soccer Trails"] in 1994.
Winner of the Vicky Metcalf Award for Children's Literature in 2008.
Kusugak has also been shortlisted for many other awards 
Themes.
Kusugak’s work reflects many of the common themes in Canadian Aboriginal children’s literature. In his books, for example, many of the heroes are strong female protagonists, girls who get themselves out of tight situations by being clever and resourceful. This is one of the ways that Aboriginal authors try to counteract the particularly harsh destruction of Aboriginal women, by European colonizers. Another theme is Kusugak’s focus on home and family, and the essential role of elders, particularly grandmothers. This is common as a way for Aboriginal authors to create positive cultural associations for children, and a positive image of home, which includes ‘the land’ much more than a physical house in Kusugak’s stories. Often, his main characters are warned by a parent or grandparent about a potential danger, but don’t believe them. In the end, they learn their lesson the hard way and learn to trust the knowledge of their elders. For example, in Kusugak’s first book, "A Promise is a Promise", Allashua decides that her mother’s warnings about the sea ice must be wrong, and decides to go and play near the cracks in the spring ice. She is taken by creatures who live under the ice, the Qallupilluit, who crave children but have promised never to take children who are with their parents. Allashua makes a bargain with the creatures, and promises that she will bring them more children if they let her go. She gets all the way back home before freezing solid, and after her parents warm her up, she tells them what she promised. They come up with a plan and together outwit the Qallupilluit, so Allashua and all her brothers and sisters are safe.
Works.
Michael Kusugak has written eight picture books,one young readers’ novel, and one non-fiction picture book.

St. Charles Mall

St. Charles Mall was a one-story enclosed neighborhood mall located in St. Charles, Illinois, United States. Its two anchors were Kmart and the now-defunct Joseph Spiess Company.
History.
St. Charles Mall opened in 1979 on the west side of St Charles. It was a successful mall until crosstown Charlestowne Mall opened with four anchors and many stores. By 1995, the mall had lost the last of its tenants and was closed off. It was auctioned in 1996.
Redevelopment.
Originally, the mall was to be demolished and an auto mall was to go up in its place. Only the core, however, was going to be demolished, and the former K-Mart and the former Spiess were to remain and be remodeled into auto dealer offices. Those plans were set and the mall site sat like that for over a year. However, in mid-2003, the auto mall plans were killed, and it was announced that the remainder of the mall was to be demolished and the land to be leased for individual retailers as part of a life-style center. Those plans were silent for a few years until it was announced in late 2007-early 2008 that a new development called St. Charles Town Centre was to be built there. Groundbreaking was to start in 2010, but the St. Charles City Council voted down the proposed development. As of 2010, the redevelopment plans are uncertain.
