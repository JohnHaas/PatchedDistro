Central Negros Electric Cooperative

The Central Negros Electric Cooperative, Inc. (CENECO) is one of the 119 electric cooperatives in the Philippines. It was incorporated on February 24, 1975 in Bacolod City, in the Province of Negros Occidental.
CENECO initially serviced Silay City; on May 16, 1976, it took over the electric system of the Municipality of Murcia. On June 1978, with the help of the national government, CENECO purchased and took over the A. S. Diaz Electric service (ASDES) which served Bacolod City and Talisay. The following year, on June 1979, CENECO took over the Bago Electric System and Ma-ao Electric System in Bago City.
At this time, CENECO’s generating units were hard-pressed to keep up with the load demand of its coverage area. CENECO had to resort to load shedding, which included scheduled brownouts. The power shortage was relieved with the coming of the power barge from the National Power Corporation on June 16, 1981. This was stationed along Bacolod’s Reclamation Area Project and augmented CENECO’s electric power supply.
Beginning July 4, 1984, the Palinpinon Geothermal Power Plant started supplying power to CENECO. The plant, located in Brgy. Palinpinon not far from Dumaguete City, became the main source of power for Negros Island. It supplied CENECO, VRESCO, NOCECO, NORECO I and NORECO II.
CENECO suffered a major loss in its operations with the coming of Typhoon Ruping in November 1991. Almost half of CENECO’s electric poles had to be replaced or repaired due to damage. The work was so extensive that normal operation was restored the following year in February.
Other typhoons also contributed their share to the damage and to the losses of the cooperative. Typhoon Puring in 1994 and Typhoon Pepang in 1995 caused setbacks to CENECO's efforts to recover.
In late 2001, CENECO was padlocked by the Bacolod City government over the cooperative’s tax-exempt status, resulting in non-payment of franchise and other taxes, a dispute that was resolved with the intervention of the Department of the Interior and Local Government and the National Electrification Administration, which restored the status quo until the Supreme Court reaches a final decision.
The passage of R.A. 9136, otherwise known as the EPIRA 2001 or the Electric Power Industry Reform Act, has restructured the power situation in the country. This act has, among others, allowed the participation of the Independent Power Producers, the privatization of the National Power Corporation, and required the cooperatives and private distribution utilities to unbundle their power rates.

The men's 4×200 metre freestyle relay event at the 2008 Olympic Games took place on 12–13 August at the Beijing National Aquatics Center in Beijing, China. 
The U.S. men's team smashed both the seven-minute barrier and the world record to keep Michael Phelps' gold-medal streak alive and most importantly, to defend their Olympic title in the event. The American foursome of Phelps (1:43.31, the second fastest split in history), Ryan Lochte (1:44.28), Ricky Berens (1:46.29), and Peter Vanderkaay (1:44.68) blistered the field, and prevailed in a sterling time of 6:58.56 to shave off their standard by almost five seconds from the 2007 World Championships in Melbourne. Earlier in the prelims, Berens (1:45.47) and his teammates David Walters (1:46.57), Erik Vendt (1:47.11), and Klete Keller (1:45.51) registered a top-seeded time of 7:04.66 from heat two to demolish Australia's 2000 Olympic record by 2.39 seconds. 
Russia's Nikita Lobintsev (1:46.64), Yevgeny Lagunov (1:46.56), Danila Izotov (1:45.86), and Alexander Sukhorukov (1:44.65) trailed behind the Americans by over five body lengths to take home the silver in a European record of 7:03.70. Meanwhile, Australia's Patrick Murphy (1:45.95), Grant Hackett (1:45.87), Grant Brits (1:47.13), and Nic Ffrost (1:46.03) picked up a bronze in 7:04.98 to hold off the agile Italian quartet of Marco Belotti (1:47.37), Emiliano Brembilla (1:47.33), Massimiliano Rosolino (1:46.53), and Filippo Magnini (1:44.12) by 37-hundredths of a second, a national record of 7:05.35.

List of songs recorded by Rihanna

Barbadian singer Rihanna has recorded material for her seven studio albums and has collaborated with other artists for duets and featured songs on their respective albums and charity singles. After signing a record contract with Def Jam Recordings in February 2005, Rihanna began to work with producers Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers, who co-wrote and co-produced 12 out of the 15 songs on her 2005 debut album, "Music of the Sun". Award-winning songwriter Diane Warren co-wrote the title track, while Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter Deniece Williams co-wrote the song "Willing to Wait". Sturken and Rogers co-wrote and co-produced 9 songs out of 16 on Rihanna's 2006 album "A Girl like Me". The album's lead single "SOS" was written by Evan "Kidd" Bogart and J. R. Rotem. It contains a sped-up sample of "Tainted Love", written in 1965 by Ed Cobb, who was credited as a co-writer on "SOS". 
Rihanna's third studio album "Good Girl Gone Bad" was developed by songwriters and producers with whom she had previously collaborated as well as different artists. Sturken and Rogers co-wrote and co-produced 2 songs out of 13. Different writers and producers, including Christopher "Tricky" Stewart, Timbaland and Norwegian production team StarGate (Tor Erik Hermansen and Mikkel S. Eriksen) significantly contributed to the album, writing and producing a total of nine songs between them. "Don't Stop the Music", the third single to be released from "Good Girl Gone Bad", contains a sample of Michael Jackson's "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'" and attributes to Jackson as a co-writer. The album was re-released in 2008 and featured new songs written by then-boyfriend Chris Brown and Maroon 5. "Rated R", Rihanna's fourth studio album, presented a new creative direction for the singer. Shaffer Smith, "Tricky" Stewart, Hermansen and Eriksen produced tracks for the album, as well as Chase & Status and Justin Timberlake. The lyrical content cast an ominous, dark and foreboding tone over "Rated R", which critics noted as a step away from her more care-free persona of past albums. 
Rihanna's fifth studio album "Loud" saw the singer return to her dancehall roots. StarGate composed three tracks for the album—"Only Girl (In the World)", "What's My Name?" and "S&M". Fellow Barbadian singer-songwriter Shontelle co-wrote the reggae-infused song "Man Down". The singer's sixth studio album in as many years, "Talk That Talk", incorporated predominantly dance-pop songs. Tracks were produced by Calvin Harris, Dr. Luke and StarGate. The album's lead single "We Found Love" was written and produced solely by Harris. Dr. Luke co-wrote and co-produced three songs for the album: "You da One", "Where Have You Been" and "Fool in Love". The lead single from Rihanna's seventh studio album, "Unapologetic", is entitled "Diamonds".

Swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's 4 × 100 metre medley relay

The men's 4×100 metre medley relay event at the 2008 Olympic Games took place on 15 and 17 August at the Beijing National Aquatics Center in Beijing, China.
Since the event's inception in 1960, the U.S. men's team dominated the race from the start to demolish a new world record, to defend their title, and most importantly, to wrap up the greatest performance in Olympic history for Michael Phelps. Joining Aaron Peirsol (53.16), Brendan Hansen (59.37), and Jason Lezak (46.76), Phelps delivered a butterfly split of 50.15 to maintain a leading pace and claim a historic gold for the Americans with a world-record time of 3:29.34, shaving 1.34 seconds off their standard from Athens in 2004. By capturing his eighth gold, Phelps also eclipsed Mark Spitz's 1972 record of seven for the most in a single Games, raising his career total to 16 medals (14 golds and 2 bronze).
The Aussie foursome of Hayden Stoeckel (53.80), Brenton Rickard (58.56), Andrew Lauterstein (51.03), and Eamon Sullivan (46.65) trailed behind their greatest rivals in the pool by exactly seven-tenths of a second (0.70), but took home an admirable silver in an Oceanian record of 3:30.04. Meanwhile, Japan's Kosuke Kitajima fueled the field on the breaststroke leg with a terrific split of 58.07 to deliver the foursome of Junichi Miyashita (53.87), Takuro Fujii (50.89), and Hisayoshi Sato (48.35) a bronze-medal time in 3:31.18, worthy enough for an Asian record.
Russia's Arkady Vyatchanin (53.36), Roman Sloudnov (59.45), Yevgeny Korotyshkin (51.62), and Yevgeny Lagunov (47.49) missed the podium by almost three-fourths of a second (0.75) with a fourth-place effort in 3:31.92, while Daniel Bell (54.52), Glenn Snyders (59.46), Corney Swanepoel (52.12), and Cameron Gibson (47.99) established a New Zealand record of 3:33.39 to claim the fifth spot in the final, holding off the British quartet of Liam Tancock (54.69), Chris Cook (59.65), Michael Rock (52.02), and Simon Burnett (47.33) by 0.30 seconds, a national record of 3:33.69. South Africa's Gerhardus Zandberg (54.69), Cameron van der Burgh (59.40), Lyndon Ferns (51.39), and Darian Townsend (48.22) finished closer to the Brits by a hundredth of a second (0.01) with a seventh-place time of 3:33.70. As the entire field came to a dramatic finish in the pool, Italy was disqualified from the race because of an early relay takeoff on the final exchange by freestyle anchor Filippo Magnini.

Arnaud de Pellegrue

Arnaud de Pellegrue (died August 1331) was a cardinal-nephew of Pope Clement V, the first pope of the Avignon Papacy.
He was born in Château Lamothe, Ancient Diocese of Bazas to the "ancient and noble" house of de la Mothe Pellegrue, a relative (and probably a nephew) of Clement V. His first name is sometimes given as Arnaldo in Italian sources, and his last name varies as Pelagura, Pelaugrue, or Pelagrua as well.
He was elevated as cardinal deacon of S. Maria in Portico on December 15, 1305. He was also the archdeacon of the cathedral chapter of Chartres, France, where he built two chapels: one dedicated to Saint Jérôme, and the other to Saint Christoph. In 1295, he became vicar general of Clement V in Comminges, and later became vicar general in Bordeaux.
As papal legate to Italy, Pellegrue was absent from Avignon between January 25, 1309 and December 10, 1310. Pellegrue led the papal army after Clement V declared war on Venice in 1309 over the disputed lordship of the strategic city of Ferrara, in which Francesco d'Este and his brothers opposed the succession as "signore" of Ferrara of their great-nephew Folco in 1308 and turned to Padua and the papacy for support. In May Pellegrue led the papal army though Asti to Parma, Piacenza, and Bologna, augmenting his forces with local mobs as he passed through. Pellegrue allied himself with the Lombards, Bologna, and Florence (from which he lifted the interdict). His forces outnumbered the Venetian supporters of Folco by the time he reached Ferrara in August; once there, he laid siege to Castel Tedaldo and blocked navigation on the Po River. According to Venetian reports, the captured forces were subjected to various atrocities, including blinding, when the fortress fell in September. Ferrara was placed under direct papal rule, and in the ensuing disorders, Francesco was killed in a skirmish, August 23, 1312.
In February 1312 Arnaud was one of the three French cardinals and one Italian conferring with Guillaume de Nogaret and other agents of Philip IV of France at the Council of Vienne where the Templars were to be suppressed.
He was named Cardinal protector of the Order of the Friars Minor (Franciscans) in 1313, and also the Governor of Bologna and the Governor of Ferrara; the Bolognese requested Pellegrue as Protector in 1311. As cardinal elector, he participated in the papal conclave, 1314-1316 which elected Pope John XXII. At the conclave Pellegrue led the Gascon faction, which numbered ten of the twenty-three total cardinals, all ten being "creatures" of Clement V, who were supported by Clement V's nephew, Bertrand de Got, viscount of Lomagne and Raimond Guilhem de Budos. He died in August 1331 in Avignon.

Pulling nearly a worst-to-first effort from a seventh-place turn by Inge Dekker (54.37), Ranomi Kromowidjojo (53.39) and Femke Heemskerk (53.42) moved the team further into the top spot, until they handed Marleen Veldhuis the anchor duties on the final exchange to cruise the field down the stretch in 52.58 and to snatch the freestyle relay title with an Olympic record of 3:33.76.
Competing in her fifth Olympics since 1984, U.S. legend Dara Torres anchored her team with a remarkable split of 52.44, the second-fastest of all time, to deliver the foursome of Natalie Coughlin (54.00), Lacey Nymeyer (53.91), and Kara Lynn Joyce (53.98) a silver medal in a new American record of 3:34.33. Meanwhile, Australia's Cate Campbell (54.43), Alice Mills (54.43), Melanie Schlanger (53.85), and Lisbeth Trickett (52.34) powered home with a bronze in an Oceanian record of 3:35.05, holding off the fast-pacing Chinese squad of Zhu Yingwen (54.12), Tang Yi (54.19), Xu Yanwei (54.64), and Pang Jiaying (52.69) by 59-hundredths of a second, a superb Asian standard of 3:35.64.
Britta Steffen shaved off Inge de Bruijn's 2000 Olympic record by 0.39 seconds with a blazing split of 53.38 to take an early lead for the Germans, but the other threesome of Meike Freitag (54.30), Daniela Götz (55.34), and Antje Buschschulte (53.83) could not maintain their pace and thereby occupied the fifth spot in 3:36.85. France (3:37.68), Great Britain (3:38.18), and Canada (3:38.32) picked up the remaining places to complete a close finish.

USS Wenonah (YT-148)

USS "Wenonah" (YT-148/YTB-148/YTM-148) was a "Woban"-class district harbor tug which served during World War II in California ports, and continued her service until she was struck by the Navy in 1974. On 17 August 2009, the Wenonah sank while berthed at Treasure Island, CA and was raised by the floating crane Left Coast Lifter on 28 August 2009.
Constructed in New York.
"Wenonah" (YT-148) -- a harbor tug constructed during the winter of 1940 and 1941 at Morris Heights, New York, by the Consolidated Shipbuilding Corp. -- was placed in service soon after her completion in June 1941.
World War II service.
"Wenonah" served in the 11th Naval District throughout her entire Navy career. She was initially based at San Diego, California; but, during her 33 years of service, she also operated at and visited various other ports on the California coast.
Designation changes.
On 15 May 1944, she was redesignated a large harbor tug with the hull designation, "YTB-148". Some 18 years later, she again changed designation and became "YTM-148", a medium harbor tug.
Decommissioning.
In April 1974, she concluded her long career and went out of service. Her name was struck from the Navy list, and she was sold for scrapping. The identity of her purchaser is unrecorded, but sources say that the tug is owned by the Historic Tugboat Education and Restoration Society. This ship is currently laid up at Pier 1 at Treasure Island, California, where she sprouted a leak in August 2009 and sank at the pier. News reports indicate that the ship would be hauled to Mare Island, CA for dismantling.

Swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Women's 4 × 200 metre freestyle relay

The women's 4×200 metre freestyle relay event at the 2008 Olympic Games took place on 13–14 August at the Beijing National Aquatics Center in Beijing, China.
For the first time since the event's inception in 1996, the Aussies smashed a new world record to overhaul the undefeated Americans for an Olympic title with a benefit of a sterling opening leg from Stephanie Rice. Starting the program's longest relay race with a remarkable Oceanian-record split of 1:56.60, Rice and her teammates Bronte Barratt (1:56.58), Kylie Palmer (1:55.22), and Linda Mackenzie (1:55.91) registered a gold-medal time of 7:44.31 to shave nearly six seconds off the previous world record set by their greatest rivals in 2007.
China's Pang Jiaying expanded her stretch over U.S. swimmer Katie Hoff with an anchor of 1:54.39 to deliver the foursome of Yang Yu (1:56.79), Zhu Qianwei (1:56.64), and Tan Miao (1:58.11) a superb Asian record time of 7:45.93, and a silver medal for the host nation. After a disappointing Olympic campaign, the U.S. team of Allison Schmitt (1:57.71), Natalie Coughlin (1:57.19), Caroline Burckle (1:56.70), and Hoff (1:54.73) finally found the best form on the blazing anchor leg to end the race for the bronze in 7:46.33, finishing nearly four seconds under the old world record.
Italy's Renata Spagnolo (1:58.31), Alessia Filippi (1:56.68), Flavia Zoccari (1:59.80), and Federica Pellegrini (1:54.97) missed out the podium by over three seconds with a fourth-place time and a European record of 7:49.76. Meanwhile, the French quartet of Coralie Balmy (1:56.57), Ophélie-Cyrielle Étienne (1:57.95), Aurore Mongel (1:58.62), and Camille Muffat (1:57.52) occupied the fifth spot in 7:50.66. Earlier in the prelims, Muffat (1:57.32), Balmy (1:55.86), Céline Couderc (1:58.92), and Alena Popchanka (1:58.27), previously competed for Belarus in three Games, established a new Olympic record of 7:50.37 to close the session with a final top seed. Hungary (7:55.53), Japan (7:57.56), and Sweden (7:59.83) rounded out the field. For the first time in Olympic history, all eight teams finished the race under eight minutes due to the presence of technology suits.

The women's 4×100 metre medley relay event at the 2008 Olympic Games took place on 15 and 17 August at the Beijing National Aquatics Center in Beijing, China. 
Dominating the race from the start, the Aussie women's relay team solidified their triumph to destroy the world record and to defend the Olympic title over their American rivals for the second straight time. The foursome of Emily Seebohm (59.33), Leisel Jones (1:04.58), Jessicah Schipper (56.25), and Lisbeth Trickett (52.53) put together a perfect ending with a blazing fast time of 3:52.69 to shave three seconds off their standard from the 2007 FINA World Championships in Melbourne.
Team USA's Natalie Coughlin (58.94), Rebecca Soni (1:05.95), Christine Magnuson (56.14), and legend Dara Torres (52.27) trailed behind their greatest rivals in the pool by six-tenths of a second (0.60), but finished under a world-record time to take home a magnificent silver in a new American standard of 3:53.30. Competing in her fifth Olympics since 1984, at age 41, Torres also picked up her twelfth career medal to match Jenny Thompson's record as the most successful American woman in Olympic history. Delighted by a raucous home crowd inside the Water Cube, the Chinese quartet of Zhao Jing (59.56), Sun Ye (1:06.75), Zhou Yafei (57.40), and Pang Jiaying (52.40) ended on a spectacular fashion with a bronze medal in an Asian record of 3:56.11. 
Great Britain's Gemma Spofforth (59.05), Kate Haywood (1:07.51), Jemma Lowe (58.13), and Francesca Halsall (52.81) missed the podium by over a single second, but powered home with a fourth-place effort in a European record of 3:57.50, holding off the Russian foursome of Anastasia Zuyeva (59.16), Yuliya Yefimova (1:06.46), Natalya Sutyagina (58.09), and Anastasia Aksenova (54.13) by 0.34 seconds, a fifth-place time of 3:57.84. Japan's Reiko Nakamura (59.74), Asami Kitagawa (1:07.04), Yuka Kato (58.17), and Haruka Ueda (54.59) cleared a four-minute barrier to claim a sixth spot in 3:59.54, leaving Canada's Julia Wilkinson (1:01.35), Annamay Pierse (1:06.91), Audrey Lacroix (59.01), and Erica Morningstar (54.08) out of the fence in 4:01.35. As the entire field came to a dramatic finish in the pool, Sweden was disqualified from the race because of an early relay takeoff on the final exchange by freestyle anchor Josefin Lillhage.

Escape to Witch Mountain (1975 film)

Escape to Witch Mountain is a 1975 film based on the novel "Escape to Witch Mountain" by Alexander Key. It was produced by Walt Disney Productions, released by Buena Vista Distribution Company and directed by John Hough.
Plot.
The movie centers upon the brother and sister pair Tony and Tia, who initially know only their deceased adoptive parents' surname, Malone. The children are placed in an orphanage, where they face difficulties stemming from their strange psychic/psionic abilities: Tony can telekinetically move and control inanimate objects with the aid of his harmonica, while Tia can communicate telepathically to Tony, commune empathically with animals, and experience premonitions and also possesses minor telekinetic abilities. She carries a "star case" with her at all times, which the children find contains a strange map.
Tia has fragmented memories of her early childhood, including an accident at sea and a man she later remembers as the children's Uncle Bené (pronounced Ben-ay), whom they believe had drowned during their rescue. 
During a field trip to see a movie, Tia experiences a premonition and is able to warn wealthy attorney Lucas Deranian against a potentially dangerous accident. Deranian informs his employer, millionaire Aristotle Bolt, of the children's unique abilities. Bolt, obsessed with the paranormal, demands that Deranian retrieve the children at all costs. Deranian's detective work leads him to the orphanage, where he poses as Tia and Tony's uncle, though not under the name Bené, and takes them to Bolt's mansion.
Though initially suspicious of Bolt's motives, Tia and Tony are lured in by the wealthy trappings of Bolt's home. Bolt eventually reveals that he has been monitoring the children via a closed-circuit television system and that he and Deranian are fully aware of their unusually strong powers. The night of this revelation, Tia and Tony make an escape, making use of their abilities to psionically control a wild mustang, guard dogs, and the security fence, as well as use the cat Winkey to make the allergic security guard let them pass.
Bolt sends Deranian and a thug, Ubermann, after the children. Tia and Tony hide out in a Winnebago motor home owned by a crotchety widower named Jason O'Day (Eddie Albert). Initially negative towards the children, Jason gradually begins to recognize their powers and the truth of their story; Tia's vague memories of a disaster at sea intrigue him. He agrees to take the children on the route indicated by Tia's star case, which leads them to a mountain known as Witch Mountain, home to unexplainable phenomena. Avoiding Bolt, the law and an incited mob convinced the children are witches, they eventually make their way up Witch Mountain, pursued by Deranian and Ubermann as well as Bolt in a helicopter.
As their memories begin to fully return, the children realize their accident at sea did not involve a boat, but a spacecraft. Tony and Tia are actually of extraterrestrial origin; the double star emblem on the star case stands for a binary star system where their home planet was located.
Having come to Earth because their own planet was dying, survivors of the journey made their way to Witch Mountain and formed a community to await the surviving children, each pair in possession of a star case to help them find their way to their new home. Tony and Tia are the first to reach their destination. The children are reunited with their Uncle Bené (who had survived after all, thanks to an "accommodating" shark whom he'd telepathically asked for help) and board another spacecraft. When Bolt and the others leave in defeat, Jason witnesses the spaceship's return as it flies over him to say a final goodbye.

Differences from novel.
"Escape to Witch Mountain" is based on the novel by Alexander Key. Significant differences from the book include its tone and plot elements. For example, in the book, the children are befriended by Father O'Day, a crusty, old Catholic priest, rather than widower Jason O'Day. The children's ship is shot down, rather than crashed, and the children are olive-skinned, though with light-colored hair, rather than fair-skinned and blond. In the book, Deranian is the main antagonist, and he is working for a shadowy European cabal who are trying to capture the children for their special powers, instead of for Aristotle Bolt. The novel is set along or near the Atlantic coast of the United States, whereas the film was shot along the Pacific coast in California.
Remake.
The movie was remade in 1995 with a different cast and several details changed or omitted. In the remake, Tia and Tony are twins, renamed Anna and Danny. They are separated as children, but reunite in an orphanage where they discover their powers. In the remake, Bolt is a land magnate who wants to develop Witch Mountain, using the twins' power to do so. The children are rescued by a shopkeeper.

<doc id="18454541" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18454541" title="Kern Front Oil Field">
Kern Front Oil Field

The Kern Front Oil Field is a large oil and gas field in the lower Sierra Nevada foothills in Kern County, California. Discovered in 1912, and with a cumulative production of around of oil, it ranks 29th in size in the state, and is believed to retain approximately ten percent of its original oil (approximately 22 million barrels), according to the official estimates of the California Department of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR). It is adjacent to the much larger Kern River Oil Field, which is to the southeast, and the Mount Poso Oil Field to the north.
Setting.
The Kern Front Field is approximately five miles due north of the city of Oildale, and ten miles (16 km) north of Bakersfield, in the first gentle rise of the hills above the floor of the San Joaquin Valley. It is about six miles (10 km) long by two and a half across, with the long axis being in the north-south direction, comprising a productive surface area of . Elevations vary from approximately 500 to above sea level. The field is spread out, especially compared to the exceedingly dense development in the adjacent Kern River Oil Field, which has one of the densest oil developments in the United States, with over 9,000 oil wells clustered in just several square miles. The Kern Front Field is bounded on the west by California State Route 65, on the southwest by James Road, and on the southeast by Bakersfield-Glennville Road. Oilfields Road runs south to north through the field.
Being within the ecological subsection of the California Central Valley known as the Hardpan Terraces, at an elevation of less than , the predominant native vegetation is needlegrass. The climate is hot and arid, with summertime temperatures routinely exceeding ; the mean freeze-free period runs from about 250 to 300 days. Mean annual precipitation is around , almost all as rain and almost all in the winter; summers are charactistically rainless.
Geology.
The Kern Front Field contains two major producing units, the Etchegoin Formation and the Chanac, both sedimentary, but unconformably overlain. The Etchegoin is a Pliocene marine sand, and the Chanac is a Pliocene non-marine sand. Each is interbedded with silts and clays, and the sands have a high porosity, ranging from 25-33 percent, making them singularly suitable as petroleum reservoirs. Overlying the Etchegoin and Chanac formations is the Pleistocene Kern River Formation, which is highly productive in the adjacent Kern River Oil Field. These units all have a northwest strike and a small southwest dip. A large north-trending fault on the east side of the field provides a structural seal on that side; on the northeast, the up-dip side of the field, the sands grade into relatively impermeable silts and clays, providing a seal in that direction. Many small southwest-trending faults run across the field. The California DOGGR recognizes only one producing pool – the Etchegoin-Chanac – and commingles the production data.
Many sedimentary units underlie these petroleum-bearing sands, but they either have not produced much oil or have not been completely explored. Basement rocks – the granitic complex representing the huge Sierra Nevada batholith, and probably of late Jurassic age – occur at a depth of approximately . The deepest well on the Kern Front Field, the Atlantic Richfield Company "Kramer No. 1", reached a depth of before bumping into the basement complex.
Oil from the field is heavy crude, with an API gravity averaging 14, and a sulfur content of 0.9 percent by weight. Since this oil is heavy, it is viscous and flows easily only when assisted by steam injection or other enhanced recovery techniques.
The average depth of the oil bearing units is about , and the thickness of the oil-bearing strata ranges from 100 to . Since the depth of the oil is relatively shallow, the temperature is relatively low, at only 100 degrees Fahrenheit (many of the deeper zones in Central Valley oil fields produce oil over , a greater safety hazard to workers). In 1983, the date of DOGGR's data compilation, the water table in the field was at below ground surface.
History, production, and operations.
Standard Oil Company of California discovered the field in 1912 with the drilling of their Well No. 1, into the Etchegoin pool, to a depth of . The well still exists, as Chevron Corp. Well No. 1. Peak production for the field was in 1929, during which of oil were pumped from the ground.
Production steadily declined from that peak until the invention of the steam injection method in the 1960s. Cyclic steam injection (the "huff and puff method" began in 1964, and production again rose, as the heavy oil flowed more freely to pumping wells. In 1978, former operator Chevron Corp. began steam flooding in the southern portion of the field, and Century Oil Management did the same in the northern portion. Petro-Lewis Corporation tested steam foam solution and a steam foam encapsulated in a polymer gel to see if steamflood performance could be improved. 
Gas production on the field peaked in 1980.
One of the current operators, Tearlach Resources, has claimed that the field may actually contain a potential reserve of . This estimate is based on work done by the operators of the field in 1990, Mobil, ARCO and Occidental, and involves both recovering previously uneconomic deposits, as well as exploring deeper, previously unexplored zones, which some of the geologists believed may be petroleum-bearing.
As of the beginning of 2009, there were 838 producing oil wells on the field. If some of the current proposals for further exploration and development are enacted, such as those by Tearlach, this number could increase considerably.
Current operators include Bellaire, Vintage, E&B Natural Resource Management, West American Energy Corp., and a few others. The field operators deliver some wastewater from oil production to Valley Waste Disposal, with some wastewater being filtered and softened to make feedwater for steam boilers. Valley Waste skims residual oil and grease from the water, and the water is conveyed to Cawelo Water District, where it is re-used for irrigation.

Ecumenical Institute for Study and Dialogue

The Study Center was established in 1951, during to the resurgence of Buddhism after independence, which brought with it an increased need for dialogue between Buddhism and Christianity. The goal of the center is to consider Christianity in the light of the Sri Lankan culture and heritage, which is predominantly Buddhist. The Study Center was renamed in 1977 to "Ecumenical Institute for Study and Dialogue" (EISD).
In addition to publishing books and papers on dialogue between Christianity and other religions, the EISD publishes the "Dialogue" journal on a quarterly basis, which is one of the first theological journals on Buddhist-Christian encounter. The journal was founded by Lynn de Silva in order to move the prevailing atmosphere between Buddhists and Christians in Sri Lanka away from diatribe and towards dialogue. This journal has published articles on a wide range of topics including "the existence of God, the idea of the soul, working towards shared ethical practice, monastic life, globalisation and women in religion."
After Lynn de Silva's death in 1982, the EISD was directed by Rev. Kenneth Fernando, and it is currently directed by Marshal Fernando. Rev. Fr. Aloysius Pieris S. J., who had been collaborating with de Silva since 1968, and who in partnership with de Silva had officially been responsible for editing the "New Series" of "Dialogue", continued to work as editor of the journal after de Silva's death. Mrs. Langanee Mendis, the Administrative Secretary at the institute, is credited as being the main person responsible for the uninterrupted functioning of the institute after Lynn de Silva's death; she was also considered by Pieris in 2003 to be "a tower of strength the Ecumenical Institute for well over 20 years."

Flightsim.com

Flightsim.com is a flight simulation review and resource website that focuses heavily on Microsoft Flight Simulator. It is one of the main flight simulation websites along with Avsim.com and provides users access to information and addons for the flight simulator series of video games.
History.
The website sources its origins to Bulletin Board System discussion groups for flight simulation dating back as far as 1985 and was one of the earliest flight simulator sites on the internet. The existing library of files dates back prior to the website in its current format, with some existing files originating from when the website was run on the BBS provider Xevious BBS, which was established by the Flightsim.com creator Nels Anderson in 1983 and still runs as part of the site today.
The website partnered with UGO Networks in 1999 with the aim of providing all content free of charge, and gaining its revenue through an advertising model. Throughout the early 1990s and into the new millennium, the website gained increasing popularity on the back of increasing interest and sales of the Microsoft Flight Simulator series of products. As of 2006 the website no longer appeared to be partnered with UGO Networks and gets revenue from its own sale of banner advertisement space in addition to membership subscriptions.
Popularity.
The website is popular within the video game genre of flight simulation. Commentators within the flight simulation and aviation community consistently rate the website as a "must visit" among fans of the genre, along with the similar website Avsim.com. The website has also received coverage in a number of publications over the years when the media require comment on issues relating to flight simulation. While the website has continued to gain popularity the basic format and provision of services has changed little since it became commercially oriented in 1996. The website is commonly referenced in literature as a source for downloading aircraft files for use with Microsoft Flight Simulator further increasing the websites popularity among the community.
Services.
The main focus of the website is providing additional content that users can use within a Flight Simulator. Additionally the website provides users with reviews of commercial content created for use with a flight simulator such as Microsoft Flight Simulator. Full commercial reviews are covered as special features listed on the websites main page. Guides on how to operate the simulator and other aspects of flight simulation are collected in articles, information, and how-to sections of the website aiming to provide resources to those interested in flight simulation.
Downloadable Content.
The following additional content is commonly indexed by the website and available for download:
Much of this content is created by freeware developers and offered to the community without charge. Occasionally, payware commercial developers will release products free on the site to generate interest in their other products. A section of the website provides background and information on development of additional content for flight simulators, including a list of prominent developers and members of the community. The website also offers a developers award and excellence program aiming to highlight both commercial and non-commercial successes within the boutique industry of flight simulation content development.
Community.
Along with community websites such as Avsim.com, the website has been identified as a key component in bringing community members together to discuss the topic of flight simulation, with real world meetings and events of website community members common. The website also provides a news service that covers both commercial releases and important announcements from developers and virtual airlines within the community. Community forums are provided for both the website community and the flight simulation community in general, with many of the early virtual airlines having forums and websites hosted by the site. Both X-Plane and Microsoft Flight Simulator forums are featured on the website. Another site, Train-sim.com, is also owned by Flightsim.com and similarly serves the train simulator community.
Subscription.
Users must subscribe to the website to access file downloads. While the base level subscription is free and provides access to all areas, there is some limitation on download speed. First-class memberships are offered that feature unrestricted downloading and higher speeds.

First Battle of Manzanillo

The First Battle of Manzanillo was a series of naval engagements during the Spanish American War on 30 June 1898 in and outside of the harbor of Manzanillo, Cuba. Three American gunboats were forced to retire after attacking a squadron of Spanish gunboats and auxiliaries.
Background.
After the blockade of Santiago, the Spanish attempted to resupply the city by taking in provisions from ports on the southern coast of Cuba that were not blockaded. Aware of the situation, the American consul at Kingston sent word to the military that the Spanish were preparing to send a resupply convoy from that city to the southern coast. To thwart these efforts, on 28 June President McKinley extended the blockade to include the southern coast of Cuba as well as Puerto Rico. In order to enforce the blockade, a flotilla of gunboats and auxiliaries — including the , , and — was sent to patrol the area. The three American vessels began operations by conducting reconnaissance of the area between Santa Cruz and Manzanillo.
Battle.
Action at Niguero.
While patrolling near the Niguero Bay, the small, Spanish gunboat "Centinela" was sighted, and the Americans decided to engage her. Since "Wompatuck" had a deep draft, "Hornet" and "Hist" moved in close to engage the vessel. Upon nearing her, "Centinela" opened fire with her two Maxim guns. Spanish troops from the shore also began firing on the Americans but were chased away when their fire was returned. "Centinela" aft gun was knocked out, and the vessel then attempted to escape by maneuvering behind a small cay out of the American's line of sight. This effort proved futile though, since the Americans still managed to hit the vessel, which was run aground by her crew. However, "Centinela" would later be refloated and join the Spanish squadron at Manzanillo.
Action at Manzanillo.
The three gunboats then continued towards Manzanillo, where they were spotted by a squadron of Spanish vessels which consisted of the gunboats "Guantánamo", "Estrella" and "Delgado Parejo", each one crewed by 19 sailors and officers, plus three armed pontoons. The pontoons were "Guardián", crewed by four gunners manning an old Parrott gun, "Cuba Española", an old wooden gunboat armed with a Parrott gun and crewed by seven men, and an old sailboat used as a barracks ship. There were also many commercial vessels in port. The Americans opened fire at 15:20, and the Spanish accurately responded, hitting all three of the ships several times. "Hist" took several hits, including some near its engine room, and "Hornet" took a disabling shot to its main steam pipe, severely scalding three men, at least one of which died. Contrary to the American reports, "Hist" did not sink any Spanish boats before "Hornet" was towed out of action by "Wompatuck", which had only been damaged lightly compared to the other American vessels. As "Wompatuck" began to tow "Hornet", the Spanish began to fire on those vessels. Starting to take damage and casualties, the Americans decided to withdraw, since their gunboats' armaments were not enough to destroy the rest of the Spanish squadron.
Aftermath.
Two vessels sent to rendezvous with the Americans arrived a day later, and made another attempt at silencing the Spaniards but were also repulsed. The Spanish vessels were later repaired, leaving the squadron mostly intact. More reinforcements would arrive by mid-July, and on the 18th a third decisive engagement was fought, finally destroying the small Spanish fleet once and for all. Although the fleet was destroyed, the town's garrison continued to hold out until August, when the Fourth Battle of Manzanillo was fought.

The Lucketts School in Lucketts, Virginia was built in 1913. It is a wood-frame schoolhouse with elements of Colonial Revival and Craftsman style. It was originally known as Lucketts High School and was expanded in 1919 with additional classrooms and in 1929 with a small auditorium. It was one of the first multi-room schools in Loudoun County, and remains one of the best-preserved early 20th century schools in the county. The last high school students graduated from Lucketts in 1938, but the school was used as an elementary school until 1972 when a new Lucketts Elementary School was built on an adjoining site. Education still continues here in the form of certified child care offered to residents of Loudoun County. 
In an effort to preserve the old school for community use the first Lucketts Fair was held in 1972, a tradition which has continued as a means of financing the maintenance of the building. It is now operated as the Lucketts Community Center by the Loudoun County Department of Parks and Recreation.
The Community Center is currently undergoing another round of extensive renovations.

8th Reconnaissance Regiment (14th Canadian Hussars)

The 8th Canadian Reconnaissance Regiment (14th Canadian Hussars), commonly abbreviated to 8 Recce, VIII Recce or (within the British Army) 8 Canadian Recce, was the reconnaissance arm of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division during World War II.
Formation and structure.
[[File:8 Recce shoulder patch.png|thumb|right|The "unit patch" for 8 Recce, worn on both shoulders of
the battle dress. The bullseye is superimposed on the blue "formation patch" of the
2nd Canadian Infantry Division.]]
8 Recce was formed at Guillemont Barracks, near Aldershot in southern England, on March 11, 1941, by merging three existing squadrons within the division. Its first commanding officer was Lieutenant Colonel Churchill C. Mann. Mann was succeeded as commanding officer on September 26, 1941, by Lieutenant Colonel P. A. Vokes, who was in turn followed on February 18, 1944, by Lieutenant Colonel M. A. Alway. The last commanding officer was Major "Butch" J. F. Merner, appointed to replace Alway a couple of months before the end of the fighting in Europe.
8 Recce had its roots in the 14th Canadian Light Horse, a militia unit formed in 1920. One source claims the unit was the union of the 27th Light Horse and the 14th Canadian Mounted Rifles, but the official lineage shows no amalgamation in 1920, just a renaming of the 27th Light Horse. Authoritative lists of units in the Active Militia and the Canadian Expeditionary Force show no record of a "14th Canadian Mounted Rifles" – there were only 13 regiments of mounted rifles organized in the CEF. In any event, the 14th Canadian Light Horse in the 1920s was headquartered in Swift Current, Saskatchewan. It comprised 'A', 'B' and 'C' Squadrons based at Swift Current, Swift Current and Shuanavon, respectively. In 1937 the regiment was designated a mechanized unit, and in 1940 the regiment was renamed the 14th Canadian Hussars. In 1941 the regiment was mobilized, and its members joined with other reconnaissance personnel in England to form 8 Recce.
Following the pattern used in the Reconnaissance Corps of the British Army, 8 Recce was composed of a regimental headquarters (officially 26 men of all ranks at full strength), one headquarters squadron (222 men of all ranks) and three reconnaissance squadrons identified by the letters 'A', 'B' and 'C' (191 men each of all ranks). The Headquarters Squadron contained a squadron headquarters (6 men), an administrative troop (44 men), a signal troop (40 men), an anti-aircraft troop (9 men), an anti-tank troop (79 men) and a mortar troop (44 men). 
Each of the three reconnaissance squadrons was composed of a squadron headquarters (36 men), three scout troops (38 men each) and one assault troop (41 men). The 12 troops in the reconnaissance squadrons were numbered, with Troops 1 to 4 in 'A' Squadron, Troops 5 to 8 in 'B' Squadron, and Troops 9 to 12 in 'C' Squadron. Troops 4, 8 and 12 were the assault troops. A reconnaissance squadron was commanded by a major assisted by a captain.
A scout troop comprised one reconnaissance section and two carrier sections. Each scout troop (38 men of all ranks) would usually be commanded by a lieutenant assisted by a second lieutenant. An assault troop (about 41 men of all ranks) contained four assault sections (8 men each). Each assault troop was commanded by a lieutenant assisted by a sergeant.
The nominal strength of the regiment was 42 officers, 71 non-commissioned officers and 708 other ranks for a total of 821 men of all ranks.
Primary mission, weapons and equipment.
The primary mission of 8 Recce was to provide reconnaissance capabilities for the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division. Reconnaissance involves determining the location and capabilities of enemy units, and providing current information concerning the state of the theatre of operations (e.g., road and bridge conditions, alternative lines of advance). Weak enemy positions might be attacked if the opportunity arose, but strong-points are generally bypassed and left for assault units to tackle. Nevertheless, determining the position and strength of the rear guard of a retreating enemy, or the location and strength of newly established defence lines, will frequently draw fire and provoke combat situations. Unless the enemy is retreating in especially disorganized fashion, a lightly armoured reconnaissance unit is vulnerable to land mines and ambushes. Consequently 8 Recce, along with other reconnaissance battalions, had significant assault capabilities to allow it to rescue pinned down scout units. 
After its formation in England, 8 Recce was equipped initially with BSA M2 motorcycles, 15-cwt and 3-ton CMP trucks, light armoured cars, automatic weapons and radio communication equipment. The equipment was upgraded progressively during the three years of training in England to include more heavily armed armoured cars and a variety of weapons systems in response to the combat experience of other reconnaissance regiments in the Reconnaissance Corps. During the campaign to liberate northern France, Belgium and the Netherlands, the primary scouting vehicles of 8 Recce were the Humber Mark IIIA as well as the (from October 1944 onward) Daimler armoured cars. Although the ruggedness and speed of these lightly armoured wheeled vehicles was ideal for the reconnaissance role during the campaign across Northwest Europe, they were vulnerable to German antitank weapons, such as the 75-mm and 88-mm guns. Other major weapons deployed by 8 Recce included the Universal Gun Carrier, the M5 half-track, 2-inch light mortars, 3-inch mortars, 6-pounder anti-tank guns, PIAT portable anti-tank weapons, and heavy machine guns.
Toward the end of the war each scout troop was equipped with five armoured cars (three Daimlers and two Humbers) and seven Universal Gun Carriers (each mounted with one American .50-calibre heavy machine gun, replacing the original .303-calibre Bren gun). Each assault troop was equipped with five half-tracks, each carrying one .50-calibre heavy machine gun.
In accordance with the system of vehicle markings used by the British Army, the vehicles of 8 Recce were identified as belonging to a reconnaissance unit by the presence of a square "unit mark" containing the number 41 in white on top of a two-tone, green above blue background.
Action during World War II.
8 Recce spent the first three years of its existence involved in training and coastal defence duties in southern England. It was not involved in the ill-fated Dieppe Raid on August 19, 1942, and thus avoided the heavy losses suffered that day by many other units of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division. The regiment landed with its division in Normandy on July 6, 1944, one month after D-Day, and first entered combat as infantry in the on-going Battle of Normandy. The regiment's first two combat deaths occurred on July 13, when a shell struck a slit trench sheltering two men near Le Mesnil.
Following the near-destruction of the German Seventh Army and Fifth Panzer Army in the Falaise Pocket in August 1944, the remaining German forces were compelled into a rapid fighting retreat out of Northern France and much of Belgium. 8 Recce provided the reconnaissance function for its division during the advance of the First Canadian Army eastward out of Normandy, up to and across the Seine River, and then along the coastal regions of northern France and Belgium. The regiment was involved in spearheading the liberation of the port cities of Dieppe and Antwerp; it was also involved in the investment of Dunkirk, which was then left under German occupation until the end of war. 8 Recce saw heavy action through to the end of the war including the costly Battle of the Scheldt, the liberation of the Netherlands and the invasion of Germany.
An early demonstration of the mobility and power of the armoured cars of 8 Recce occurred during the liberation of Orbec in Normandy. Over August 21 to 23, the infantry of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division had succeeded in pushing eastward up to the west bank of the River Tourques, but they were unable to expand an initial bridgehead across the river because of the presence of enemy positions in Orbec on the east bank. Humbers of 8 Recce had meanwhile scouted out possible river crossings northwest of the town. They succeeded in crossing the Tourques, then circled back to Orbec and attacked the German defenders unexpectedly from the north and east. Enemy resistance in the town was rapidly overcome and the division's advance towards the Seine could resume.
The reconnaissance role of 8 Recce often put its members well ahead of the main body of the division, especially during the pursuit of the retreating German army across northern France and Belgium in late August and September 1944. For example, elements of 8 Recce entered Dieppe on the morning of September 1, 1944, scene of the disastrous Dieppe Raid of 1942, a full 12 hours before the arrival of truck-borne Canadian infantry. The liberation of Dieppe was facilitated by the withdrawal of the German occupying forces on the previous day. The unexpectedly early liberation allowed a planned and likely devastating Allied bombing raid on the city to be called off. 8 Recce was responsible for liberating many other towns in the campaign across Northwest Europe. 
During the Battle of the Scheldt, 8 Recce advanced westwards and cleared the southern bank of the West Scheldt river. In one notable action, armoured cars of 'A' Squadron were ferried across the river; on the other side the cars then proceeded to liberate the island of North Beveland by November 2, 1944. Bluff played an important role in this operation. The German defenders had been warned that they would be attacked by ground support aircraft on their second low-level pass if they did not surrender immediately. Shortly thereafter 450 Germans surrendered after their positions were buzzed by 18 Typhoons. Unbeknownst to the Germans, the Typhoons would not have been able to fire on their positions since the aircraft's munitions were already committed to another operation.
On April 12, 1945, No. 7 Troop of 'B' Squadron liberated Camp Westerbork, a transit camp built to accommodate Jews, Romani people and other people arrested by the Nazi authorities prior to their being sent into the concentration camp system. Bedum, entered on April 17, 1945, was just one of many Dutch towns liberated by elements of 8 Recce in the final month of the war. 8 Recce's last two major engagements were the Battle of Groningen over April 13–16 and the Battle of Oldenburg, in Germany, over April 27 to May 4. Three members of 8 Recce were killed on May 4, just four days before VE Day, when their armoured car was struck by a shell.
During the war 79 men were killed outright in action while serving in 8 Recce, and a further 27 men died of wounds.
Battle honours.
The battle honours of 8 Recce are as follows. The capitalized honours appear on the regimental guidon.
Postwar history.
8 Recce was deactivated in Swift Current on December 15, 1945, but after the war it continued to function as a militia regiment. The regiment was redesignated the 8th Armoured Car Regiment (14th Canadian Hussars) in 1947, and renamed again the 14th Canadian Hussars in 1958. In 1968 the militia regiment was essentially disbanded when it was moved to the Supplementary Order of Battle as part of a major reorganization of the Canadian Forces.

String Quartet No. 15 (Simpson)

The String Quartet No. 15 by Robert Simpson was composed quickly in the summer of 1991 and dedicated to the Vanbrugh Quartet who had developed growing association with Simpson's later chamber music.
This work is cast in one continuous movement and is relatively short. The overall mood is tough and turbulent and, as with much of Simpson's later work, the chief roots are a collection of intervals - a minor seventh (both ascending and descending) and a sequence of falling minor seconds dominating. Another feature of this work is that most of the phrases proceed in contrary motion to another instrument (one voice moving up whilst the other moves down).
The opening Adagio acts as an austere and brief introduction, moments of extreme tension contrasting with gently flowing counterpoint, with minor sevenths being particularly prominent.
The opening goes headlong into the extended part of the work, a large scale Severo based on a variant of the quartet's opening theme. The intensity and severity is sustained for a considerable period of time until a hushed section emerges, building up to a harsh passage of sevenths piled on top of each other before subsiding to another buildup that gradually increases in volume. A climax is eventually reached, and a modified recapitulation of the opening of the Severo section is heard before it quickly dissipates into fragments, leaving a high C sustained on the first violin.
The final part of the work is a somewhat calmer but uneasy allegretto that is still based on the strict structure of the work. There is tenderness and delicacy here but the listener is briefly reminded of the Severo section once again before the work fades away into silence, unresolved.
A typical performance of this work lasts approximately 18 minutes.
Discography.
Currently, the only commercially available CD is a Hyperion Records release which also includes String Quartet No. 14 and the Quintet for Clarinet, Bass Clarinet and String Trio, all performed by the Vanbrugh Quartet with relevant additions for the two clarinet work.

My Aquarium

My Aquarium (Blue Oasis in Japan) is a virtual pet video game by Hudson Soft for WiiWare and PlayStation Network. It was released in Japan on June 24, 2008, in Europe on August 15, 2008 and in North America on September 1, 2008 for the WiiWare and on September 8, 2010 in Japan for the PlayStation Network.
Overview.
The game is a virtual aquarium that sees players caring for fish in up to six aquariums of their own design. The player can choose from 49 species of fish (most of which must be unlocked as only 13 are available at the beginning) to populate an aquarium that can be customized with a choice of decorations, backgrounds, lighting and plant life. 
The game also utilizes data from the Forecast Channel, changing lighting and conditions based on the weather. However, there is no emphasis on realism; for example salt water and fresh water fish can be placed together and water temperature is not taken into consideration. While no cheats are available for the game itself, it has been noted that the game runs off of the various aspects of the Wii system and with that in mind, the date from the system settings can be changed repeatedly to unlock new or hidden items.
Players can also send their own aquariums to other players with the game through WiiConnect24.
Fish in the game.
Starting species.
Players start with thirteen fish:
Unlockable species.
Regularly checking on the fish will unlock a new fish every few days in the following order:

Atlantic Federation of Students

Atlantic Federation of Students (AFS) was an Atlantic Canadian student organization existing from January 1975 to November 1978.
History.
The AFS was created in the 1970s, after the Canadian Union of Students, formerly National Federation of Canadian University Students (created in 1926) ceased existence in 1969. The AFS had links to the National Union of Students (which was created in 1972, several years after CUS was disbanded). It also held ties to the Ontario Federation of Students (OFS), and l’Association nationale des etudiants du Québec. The AFS had 12 university and college member locals from Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. Through its activity, the Atlantic Federation also came under surveillance by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Security Service and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service.
Organizing.
In 1976 the Federation received a considerable set-back from one of its largest members, Dalhousie Student Council (DSC). $2,000 in emergency funds for the fledgling Federation was denied by DSC. It was voted down on the grounds that a detailed budget was not produced by AFS. The funds were to ensure full operation of the AFS during spring 1976 referenda in the Atlantic provinces. AFS secretary Don Soucy challenged the DSC motion stating that the DSC had committed to produce a budget for the AFS. Soucy stated “The main problem is the constant referral to AFS as ‘they’… the failure to realize that it is not ‘they’ but an organization of the post-secondary students in the Atlantic provinces.”
In late February, 1977, students from St. Frances Xavier University in Antigonish, Nova Scotia, voted in favour of joining the AFS but did not reach quorum. By-laws of the Federation stipulated that at least 40% of students had to vote to legally join the Federation. The vote came short of quorum by 1.5%.
Campaigns.
In 1977-78, students in the Atlantic provinces were battling their respective provincial governments over shortfalls in funding and the prospect of increased tuition. The Council of Maritime Premiers fell short of the 11.5% funding increase recommended by the Maritime Provinces Higher Education Commission. This meant tuition fee increases for students. As a result, students from all over Nova Scotia marched on provincial legislature.

My One and Only (film)

My One and Only is a 2009 comedy film loosely based on a story about George Hamilton's early life on the road with his mother and brother, featuring anecdotes that Hamilton had told to Merv Griffin. Griffin pitched the idea for the script, and had shepherded the project from idea to production, until his death in 2007. His company served as one of the film's producers.
"My One and Only" starred Logan Lerman as George and Renée Zellweger as George's mother. The film was directed by Richard Loncraine and written by Charlie Peters.
Plot.
In New York City in 1953, Ann Deveraux lives with her bandleader husband Danny, their 15-year-old son George, and Ann's somewhat older effeminate son Robbie. Ann does not seem very interested in her children's lives; she does not even remember which school they attend. After catching Danny in yet another affair, Ann, fed up, tells him she is leaving him and taking the children with her. She removes cash from her safe deposit box and sends George out with it to buy a Cadillac. The salesmen are suspicious, but Ann drops by later herself.
Ann embarks with Robbie (stitching out a map of ther road trip in the backseat) and George (as his mother's chauffeur) on a road trip across the United States, in search of a husband to fund a new life for her and her boys. They first stay in Boston and Pittsburgh. Several men turn out to be disappointments for Ann. One has financial problems and asks for a large sum of money; when she does not seem willing to give it, he steals the money in her purse, leaving her unable to pay for the lavish dinner they both shared. Another man, one Ann met briefly at a party a year before, offers to pay for it, eventually leading the two to date and become engaged. But when Ann and George discover his abusiveness, they leave. Later, Ann is put in jail overnight after chatting in a bar with a man who turns out to be an undercover police officer, who takes her for a prostitute and charges her with solicitation. One man sexually assaults her; one is in love with another woman.
George decides he wants to live with his father, but Danny turns him down because he is often on the road for his work. George is greatly disappointed and concludes that Danny does not love him. Later, when George asks Danny why he does not support them financially, he says he sent money several times, but Ann always returned it.
Ann does not like her sister in St. Louis. She has always said she would have to be desperate to go to her. Now, however, they go there, so George properly concludes Ann has become officially desperate. Shortly, Ann becomes engaged to a salesman who, it subsequently turns out, is mentally ill and has recently proposed to and/or married at least seven women, much to the embarrassment (and the 'delight' of Ann's sister) of his actual wife and his family. Ann is paid off by the family's attorney for her inconvenience. As Ann readies to leave and get on the road again, she discovers George has asked her sister to let him stay there while Ann moves on with Robbie to Los Angeles. Unhappy that his mother does not really know him, they argue; when Ann gets frustrated she slaps him, causing him to walk out of the house. Ann first protests, but, to George's surprise, accepts his decision, and they leave. George is surprised they actually leave him behind.
Near Albuquerque, when Ann and Robbie give a couple a ride for gas money, the man attempts to rob them, threatening Ann with a knife, but he is foiled when Robbie points a gun at him and fires a warning shot. Ann and Robbie invite the woman to come with them, and she accepts, but later steals their money. Robbie phones George to tell him what happened. George tells Ann's sister and her husband what happened, and discovers Ann had left money with them for his board and care. He demands they give him the money so he can go to meet up with his mother and brother, which they do. At a Greyhound bus station somewhere in the southwest, Robbie stops and tells his mother he figures they can 'pick somebody up'. Ann is then surprised to see George getting off a bus.
The three get back on the road to Los Angeles.
Ann gets work as an extra, and Robbie tries acting. Ann gets a call telling her Danny has died, and George goes to the funeral in New York, where he decides to remain and study to become a writer, with Ann's blessing. However, later he returns to Los Angeles, and it turns out that George is better at acting than Robbie. Robbie gets work in costuming. George realizes that they didn't need anyone to take care of them, that they could take care of themselves, and that they were going to be just fine.

Cannelton Locks and Dam

The Cannelton Locks and Dam is a concrete dam connected to two locks on the Ohio River at river mile 720.8. It is three miles (5 km) upstream from Cannelton, Indiana. The project was approved on January 27, 1960 by the Secretary of the Army under authority of Section 6 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, approved March 3, 1909, to replace the existing Locks 43, 44 and 45.
Dam.
The Cannelton Dam has two sections. The main section is long with twelve tainter gates. The gates are held between piers. Each gate is high and long. Electric hoists on top of the piers are used to raise or lower the gates. At the end of the gated section of the dam there is second section, a concrete fixed weir on the Kentucky side of the river. The weir is long.
Locks.
The Cannelton Locks run parallel to each other on the Indiana side of the river. There are two locks alongside the dam, the main lock which measures by and the auxiliary lock that is by . The locks can be filled or emptied in around 8 minutes.
The upper pool is normally at an elevation of , mean sea level and the lower pool elevation is , mean sea level. The lift (difference) between the two pool is .
The locks reduce travel time because it enables large commercial tows to go through only one lockage rather than the three locks it replaced. Also the large lock chamber allows a large vessels to pass through the lock in a single operation instead of using smaller lock sections.
Construction.
The construction of the locks began in July 1963. The locks began operation in December 1966 and were completed April 1967. Construction on the dam started in August 1965 and the dam was completed in 1974. The structure was designed, built, and is operated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers Louisville District.
There were of overlook property that was initially built during the construction project. In 1995, the property was excessed to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service for use as a wildlife habitat.
Hydroelectricty.
American Municipal Power (AMP) is currently outfitting the dam with three turbines to generate up to 88 megawatts of power, a project that will cost an estimated $416 million.

Social movement organization

__NOTOC__
In social movement theory, a social movement organization (often capitalized in academic literature as "Social Movement Organization" or abbreviated as SMO) is an organized component of a social movement (SM). SMO usually is only part of a particular social movement; in other words, a specific social movement is usually composed of many social movement organizations - formal organizations that share movement's goals. Social movement organizations usually have coordinating roles in social movements, but do not actually employ or direct most of the participants, who are part of a wider social movement community.Social movement organizations carry out the tasks that are necessary for any social movement to survive and to be successful.
For instance, the civil rights movement was a social movement composed of specific social movement organizations (like SNCC (Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee) or CORE (Congress of Racial Equality)). PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) advocates for vegan lifestyles along with its other aims. But PETA is not the only group to advocate for vegan diets and lifestyles; there are numerous other groups actively engaged toward this end. Thus, the social movement is the general push toward veganism (an effort with numerous motivations) and PETA is only a single SMO working within the broader social movement. The peace movement is composed of many groups that want peace - groups that classify as SMOs such as Peace Action (SANE/FREEZE), Fellowship of Reconciliation and others. Ku Klux Klan is yet another SMO - part of the white supremacist movement. al-Qaeda, acting as a coordinating body for a large number of loosely-connected anti-American organizations and individuals is another example of a social movement organization.
An organizational equivalent of a particular social movement - a collection of all SMOs focused on a given field - is known as a Social Movement Industry (SMI). Social Movement Industries are similar to social movements in scope but are seen as having more structure. Social movement industries can be combined into one Social Movement Sector in the society.
The term SMO entered the literature through the work of Mayer N. Zald and Roberta Ash (Zald, Mayer N. and Roberta Ash, "Social Movement Organizations: Growth, Decay and Change." Social Forces 44:327-341, 1966).

<doc id="18454984" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18454984" title="Munch Man">
Munch Man

Munch Man is a video game made exclusively for the Texas Instruments TI-99/4A home computer. Loosely based on Namco's "Pac-Man", "Munch Man" includes several variations that alter and enhance gameplay.
Object.
The object of the game is similar to that of "Pac-Man". However, as opposed to "Pac-Man" where the object of the game is to eat Pac-Dots, in "Munch Man" the object is to interconnect individual links to form a continuous chain. A level is completed when the entire playing-area chain is completed.
Gameplay.
The player operates the Munch Man using either the keyboard or joystick. The object of the game is to completely fill each level's maze with interlocking chain links until the entire board is completely filled with one continuous chain. (In level 20, 40, and 60, the maze is invisible and there are no chains. Instead, Munch Man must eat all the TI logos in the invisible maze. This gives the odd effect of showcasing the maze at first, but slowly hiding the maze as the player removes the indications of the maze paths by eating the TI logos.) Four cunning Hoonos (the equivalent of "Pac-Man" ghosts) attempt to thwart Munch Man's efforts to complete his mission. However, Munch Man always has his "Energizer" (the equivalent of a "Pac-Man" Power Pellet) which gives Munch Man the ability to devour the Hoonos. The game ends when the player's lives are depleted. 
Points.
Points are earned in the game in the following ways:
For each 10,000 points earned, an extra Munch Man is awarded. Although the play screen only shows up to four additional lives, the games remembers any additional earned and applies them to the total. Each level has a maximum score of 8,700 points.
The Hoonos.
Another unique feature that differentiates "Munch Man" from "Pac-Man" are the Hoonos (similar to the ghosts of "Pac-Man") that "Munch Man" employs to prevent the player from reaching his/her goal. The Hoonos are different from level to level in both appearance and ability. For example, the Hoonos on the first level are not particularly cunning nor aggressive. With each higher level, the Hoonos not only look totally different, but they become much more aggressive. The Hoonos also become much faster with each level, eventually becoming faster than Munch Man. In addition, with each level, the Hoonos have a shorter vulnerable period (the time that Munch Man can eat them) making it more difficult for the player to complete the level and move on to the next. 
Although the shape of the Hoonos changes with each level, the colors of them remain consistent. Each level has Hoonos colored red, yellow, blue, and purple. The red Hoono on each level is the most intelligent, therefore the most likely to eat the Munch Man. The yellow Hoono is the least intelligent of the bunch. However, to make up for its lack of intelligence, the yellow Hoono has the ability to disappear occasionally for shorts periods of time, making it possible for it to sneak up on the player when least expected. This only happens if all the Hoonos and Munch Man are on the same row, due to a four sprite per scanline hardware limitation in the TI-99/4A. Since the hardware limitation is per-scanline, not per-sprite, it is possible and often the case that the yellow Hoono is only partially invisible. It is rare that it remains invisible for long.
There are 20 unique sets of Hoonos. Beginning with level 21, the Hoonos recycle shape.

Archery at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Women's individual

The women's individual archery event at the 2008 Summer Olympics was part of the archery programme. It took place at the Olympic Green Archery Field. Ranking Round was on August 9, 2008. First and second elimination rounds took place on August 12, and eights, quarterfinal, semifinals and medals matches were on August 14. All archery was done at a range of 70 metres, with targets 1.22 metres in diameter.
Park Sung-Hyun tried to defend her Olympic Gold Medal won in Athens, along with British Alison Williamson, winner of the bronze medal in 2004.
64 archers from 37 countries qualified for the event at the Beijing Olympics. The 44th Outdoor Archery World championship, held in Leipzig, Germany, plus 5 continental qualification tournaments and a Final World Qualification Tournament selected 61 slots for the event, along with 3 Tripartite Commission Invitations.
The competition began with the ranking round. Each archer fired 72 arrows. This round was done entirely to seed the elimination brackets; all archers moved on to them. The elimination rounds used a single-elimination tournament, with fixed brackets based on the ranking round seeding. In each round of elimination, the two archers in each match fired 12 arrows; the archer with the higher score advanced to the next round while the other archer was eliminated. Unlike in previous years, in which the first three rounds used an 18-arrow match, the 12-arrow match was used throughout the 2008 tournament.
The Chinese archer Zhang Juanjuan defeated South Korean Park Sung-Hyun by a margin of 1 point, ending the Koreans' dominance in the women's individual archery event, which dated back to the 1984 Summer Olympics.

825 Naval Air Squadron

825 Naval Air Squadron was a Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm carrier-based squadron formed on 8 October 1934 from the aircraft and personnel of 824 Naval Air Squadron. It operated in most of the theatres of the Second World War, carrying out a number of attacks on prominent German warships, including the battleship in the Atlantic and the pocket battleships and and heavy cruiser during their Channel Dash. The squadron also saw action in later conflicts, including the Korean War and the Falklands War.
Pre-war history.
825 Squadron's first assignment after commissioning was to board for service on the China Station. This was short-lived, and by January 1935 both the squadron and the carrier were in the Mediterranean. The squadron was transferred to Hal Far, Malta in March, while "Eagle" returned to Britain for a refit. replaced "Eagle", and the squadron alternated its time between the carrier and the aerodrome at Hal Far. They returned briefly to the UK in May 1937 to attend the Coronation Fleet Review, before retaking their station in the Mediterranean, and were transferred to Admiralty control on 24 May 1939.
Wartime service.
Mediterranean and the North Sea.
With the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, 825 Squadron embarked on HMS "Glorious" at Dekheila, Egypt and headed into the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea to search for enemy shipping. They carried out these duties throughout the rest of 1939, returning the Mediterranean in January 1940, where they again returned to Hal Far. The squadron re-embarked on "Glorious" in March and sailed to Britain to defend Norway after the German invasion. On their arrival, they disembarked at RNAS Prestwick. With the sinking of HMS "Glorious" by the German pocket battleship and on 8 June 1940, the squadron was transferred to operate from Worthy Down, Detling and Thorney Island, covering allied forces in France and the Low Countries as the German forces advanced. They were active in covering the Dunkirk evacuation, during which they lost eight of their 12 aircraft; five were lost in a single bombing raid on 29 May 1940, including its commander Jimmy Buckley who was awarded the DSC for his actions during this period.
Atlantic and the "Bismarck".
The depleted squadron was brought up to nine aircraft in July 1940 and embarked aboard . They then operated off the Norwegian coast in September, carrying out night attacks on Trondheim and Tromsø. After the British withdrawal, the squadron remained aboard "Furious", and by February 1941 was off the Gold Coast. They joined in May 1941, and took part in the Home Fleet's hunt for the battleship . After sighting "Bismarck" on 24 May, aircraft from the squadron carried out an attack on 25 May, scoring a single hit which slowed her. Another series of attacks by Fairey Swordfish of 810 and 818 Naval Air Squadrons flying from the following day succeeded in disabling "Bismarck"s steering gear. She was subsequently engaged by ships of the Home Fleet and sank on 27 May.
The Channel Dash.
The squadron embarked on HMS "Ark Royal" in June 1941 to provide cover for the Malta Convoys. Aircraft of 825 Squadron carried out raids on targets in Pantellaria, Sardinia and Sicily in September. A number of the squadron's aircraft were lost in the sinking of "Ark Royal" on 14 October. The remainder flew to Gibraltar, where the squadron was disbanded. It was re-formed with Fairey Swordfish at RNAS Lee-on-Solent in January 1942, and tasked with a torpedo bomber reconnaissance duties. Six of the squadron's aircraft flew off from RAF Manston to attack "Scharnhorst" and "Gneisenau" and the heavy cruiser in the English Channel, as they carried out Operation Cerberus. The attacking aircraft failed to score any hits, and all six were lost. The Commanding Officer—Eugene Esmonde—was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross. Five of the aircrew survived, and were also decorated.
Arctic and Atlantic convoys.
After regrouping at Lee-on-Solent in March 1942, the squadron sent three aircraft aboard where they covered the Arctic convoys to Russia. They attacked six U-boats, and shared credit with the destroyer for sinking . The squadron then operated under 16th Group RAF Coastal Command, flying out of Thorney Island and Exeter.
They then embarked aboard HMS "Furious" in March 1943, covering convoys sailing to Iceland and making sweeps for enemy submarines off Norway. They transferred to with six Sea Hurricane IICs, and later another three Fulmar IIs to cover the Atlantic convoys. Aircraft from the squadron sank on 15 March 1944 and on 6 May 1944. 825 Squadron was re-equipped with 12 Swordfish IIIs in August and sailed with "Vindex" to cover the Arctic convoys. They sank on 22 August 1944, while the squadron's Sea Hurricanes damaged another and claimed another as a possible kill that same day. was sunk jointly with the Fleet on 24 August, and was sunk on 2 September. The squadron transferred to in March 1945, where the Sea Hurricanes were replaced by eight Wildcat VIs. They continued in the Arctic before returning to Britain. The Swordfish were then absorbed into 815 Naval Air Squadron, followed by the Wildcats in May. 825 Squadron then ceased to exist. 825 Squadron was reformed in July 1945 at RNAS Rattray as a Canadian-manned force. It was intended that it would consist of 12 Barracuda IIs, and form part of the 19th Carrier Air Group aboard a "Colossus"-class aircraft carrier. This did not happen immediately, and the squadron remained a Royal Navy one.
Post-war service.
The commissioning of HMCS "Warrior" in January 1946 led to the transferral of the squadron to the Royal Canadian Navy. It served with them until being renumbered 880 Squadron (RCN) in May 1951. The 825 designation then returned to the Royal Navy, and the squadron reformed in June 1951 at RNAS Eglinton. The squadron was recommissioned several times over the next decade, operating as an anti-submarine unit equipped with Fairey Gannets, and seeing service in the Korean War. During this period, they spent time operating off . It then re-formed at RNAS Culdrose on 16 August 1960, equipped with Whirlwind HAS.7s. The squadron was deployed in the Middle East during crises between Iraq and Kuwait in 1961. It then transferred most of its aircraft to 824 Squadron, returning to the UK aboard . In late 1961 they took part in relief operations after Mombasa was hit by flooding. They were again disbanded on 2 April 1962.
The outbreak of the Falklands War in 1982 led to the re-forming of the squadron on 3 May 1982 equipped with Sea King HAS.2/2As. The aircraft came from 706 Naval Air Squadron, or were taken from other units or storage. Eight Sea Kings sailed for the Falklands on 12 May, aboard the "Atlantic Causeway", with another two sailing the following day aboard . The squadron operated from British forward bases, and Port San Carlos until their return to the UK in late July. They were disbanded at Culdrose on 17 September 1982.

ROD-188

ROD-188 is a sedative drug that was structurally derived from the GABAA antagonist bicuculline by a team at Roche. Unlike bicuculline, ROD-188 acts as an agonist at GABAA receptors, being a positive allosteric modulator acting at a novel binding site distinct from those of benzodiazepines, barbiturates or muscimol, with its strongest effect produced at the α6β2γ2 subtype of the GABAA receptor. ROD-188 is one of a number of related compounds acting at this novel modulatory site, some of which also act at benzodiazepine receptors.

War of the Wizards (gamebook)

War of the Wizards is the fourth and final book in the World of Lone Wolf book series created by Joe Dever and written by Ian Page. It is one of four books in the mini-series and features Grey Star, for whom the first book is named, a young Wizard trained by the enigmatic Shianti to stop the Wytch-King and his Shadakine Empire. All four of the Grey Star books were released by Project Aon along with many of the other installments of the Lone Wolf series.
Gameplay.
The gameplay of the World of Lone Wolf series is very much like the other Lone Wolf books, but features a few key differences. One is the inclusion of Willpower, which can be used for various Magical effects in the game, and maybe most importantly to loose a blast of Magic from your Wizards Staff when it is in your possession. The ability to vanquish some enemies with the expenditure of a Willpower point or two introduces a key strategic consideration in which the reader must choose between the likely loss of Endurance that comes with fighting enemies, and the amount of Willpower that should be saved for later in the story.
Plot.
In this, the final installment of the World of Lone Wolf, Grey Star and Tanith have just completed a harrowing quest in the Shadow realm of the Daziarn. Upon retrieving the Moonstone, the two return to Magnamund to find the forces of good and evil poised on the brink of final conflict. Shasarak has enlisted the aid of the dreaded demon lord Agarash the Damned in order to eradicate the resistance movement once and for all. Battling their way through hordes of demons and undead minion, Grey Star and Tanith must struggle to rejoin the Freedom Guild, defeat the forces of the Wytch-King, and fulfill his destiny and promise to the Shianti.

Lee Eun-sang

Lee Eun-sang (October 22, 1903 – September 18, 1982) was a Korean poet and historian. He was dedicated to the revival and modernization of "sijo", a form of Korean poetry.
Early life.
Lee Eun-sang was born on October 22, 1903 at Sangnam-dong, Masan in Korea. In 1918, he graduated from the Changshin High School (창신고등학교) which his father had built, and in 1923, he entered the department of liberal arts at Yunhee College, the predecessor of Yonsei University. He withdrew in 1923. He worked for Changshin School as a teacher for a time until he enrolled at Waseda University in Japan, majoring in history in 1926. He worked at Ewha Woman's University as a professor from 1931 to 1932. After that, he worked for Dong-a Ilbo and Chosun Ilbo (Korean newspapers).
In 1942, He was arrested on the suspicion of being implicated in the so-called "incident of Chosun Language Academy" (조선어학회사건), and was released the next year when his indictment suspended. In 1945, he was detained in custody as a political offender at the Gwangyang police station and was released at the time of independence from Japan.
After Korea’s liberation from Japan, Lee taught at Cheonggu University, Seoul National University, and Yeungnam University. In 1954, he was invited to join the Korean Academy of the Arts, and by 1978 he had achieved a life-time membership in the Korean Academy of the Arts. Lee served as the chairman of the Admiral Lee Sunsin Memorial Committee, a member of the Korea Alpinist’s Association, the Korea Culture Protection Association, and the People’s Culture Association, as well as being Editor-in-Chief for the History of Korea Independence Movements.
Lee won the Hibiscus Medal of Honor in 1970, and died in 1982.
Works.
When he was a child, Lee played with his friends near a spring next to his house at the hill of Mount Nobisan. Whenever he visited Masan later in life, he went to the spring, as it reminded him of his childhood. The poems "Climbing Up the Old Hill" and "Symphony of Spring" both depict the days when he played on the hill of Mount Nobisan. One of his motivations for writing poetry in the "sijo" form is that his father would recited it to him when he was a child.
In 1921, the poem "Hyuljo" was published for the first time, in "Ahsung", volume 4, under the pen name "Duwuseong".
Lee Eun Sang earned a reputation as a poet who opened up a new modern free form of "sijo". Most of his works were composed for classical songs. "Nosan Shijojip", his first volume of poetry, was published in 1932. The works integrated characteristics like homesickness, sentimentality, and the cult of nature. The poems "Memory of Hometown", "Gagopa", and " Night of Seongbul Temple" are filled with plain and sweet lyricism.
Because of the lyricism of his poems "Bomcheonyeo" (봄처녀) and 'Gagopa' (가고파), and because of the reworking of the "sijo" format into something more modern that was accomplished in "Donghaesong" (동해송) and "High Ground is Over There", he is said the best poet in the revival of modern "sijo".
The Korea Literature Translation Institute, summarizes Lee's contributions to Korean literature:
Awards.
In 1969, he was awarded the President Prize, and in 1970, the Medal of the People -the Mugunghwajang.

America's Hot Musician

"America's Hot Musician" is an American television program which first aired on "Lifetime Real Women" in July 2008. The show is a reality talent competition which features strictly instrumental solo musicians of varying styles competing for a one year recording contract.
In its first season the program featured National Symphony Orchestra (United States) Principal Second Violinist Marissa Regni, Talena Atfield formerly of the all-female-Canadian band Kittie, and jazz trombonist Gregory Charles Royal as judges.
History.
The program was created by Gregory Charles Royal as Artistic Director of American Youth Symphony (AYS) in Washington, DC. The idea developed during the organization's Plight of American Music Initiative Conference at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Library in Washington, DC in February 2006. The conference, which was covered by Voice of America and Fox affiliate WTTG, featured a panel of industry representatives including Travis Bowerman from the Washington Performing Arts Society, Ashley Gauthier, a media attorney from "US News and World Report", Malcolm Iniss from Radio One, AYS Executive Director Susan Veres and Gregory Charles Royal. The panel discussed ways to engage youth culture in instrumental music performance and the current condition of live music attendance . America's Hot Musician was developed to purposely follow a popular television format to attract more mainstream viewers.
The program began airing on public, educational, and government access (PEG) channels in various states in 2006 including Washington, DC, Madison, Wisconsin, Minneapolis and Boston before scheduling to air as a paid program on the Oxygen Network in July 2007. A subsequent legal battle ensued in federal court over the show's cancellation and the program aired primarily on the internet and regional broadcast channels WRNN-TV in New York and KDOC-TV in Los Angeles.
The initial 2006 season which had been assembled with musicians from the internet with auditions in Los Angeles, Minneapolis and Washington, DC incorporated the winners of that competition into a national version of the program in 2007, with a new crop musicians, which was to air on the Oxygen Network.
The finals of the first season, a combination of 2006 and 2007 competitors, was taped at the George Washington University in Washington, DC on June 13, 2008 and the organization negotiated to have the finals air on Lifetime Real Women on July 12 and July 20, 2008. Comedian Vic Christian and Clare Dagress were added as hosts. Violinist Liesl Schoenberger was voted the first season winner.
The show released a first-season winner's recording with Canadian Idol finalist Sarah Loverock in October 2009.
The release entitled "The Dreamer", which was written by judge Gregory Charles Royal, was certified Gold by the Canadian Recording Industry Association CRIA on November 4, 2009.
"America's Hot Musician" aired on Lifetime Real Women in July 2008 with Royal, National Symphony Orchestra Principal Second Violinist, Marissa Regni and nu-metal bassist Talena Atfield as judges, hosted by comedian Vic Christian.

Progress Party (Australia)

The Progress Party was a minor Australian political party in the mid-to-late 1970s. Initially known as the Workers' Party, it was formed on Australia Day (26 January) 1975 as a free market libertarian and anti-socialist party by businessmen John Singleton and Sinclair Hill in reaction to the economic policies of Labor prime minister Gough Whitlam. It operated and ran candidates in Western Australia, Northern Territory, South Australia, Queensland and New South Wales, but did not have a central federal structure and its Western Australian affiliate, which additionally advocated secession from the rest of Australia, did particularly well in the area surrounding Geraldton in the State's Mid West. However the party failed to win seats at any level of government, and passed out of existence by 1981.
The party's first electoral contest was the Greenough state by-election which took place upon the retirement from politics of former Premier David Brand. The candidate, Geoffrey McNeil, surprised most observers by attaining 12.96% of valid votes cast (only 0.66% less than the Labor candidate). Buoyed by their success, the Workers' Party ran three House and five Senate candidates at the 1975 election for Western Australia. Subsequently to this, the New South Wales party ran for 1976 by-elections in the seats of Pittwater and The Hills.
The party was renamed the Progress Party after objections to the name and constitution, and the "Westralian Progress Party" published its platform in 1977 ahead of the February state election, where it contested the seats of Greenough (16.81%), Geraldton (5.12%), Kalgoorlie (6.43%), Mundaring (3.95%) and Yilgarn-Dundas (3.63%). At the August 1977 Northern Territory assembly elections, the party picked up a territory-wide vote of 9.76%.
The defection of Tangney Liberal MHR Peter Richardson to the party in the final months of his term provided a morale boost, and at the 1977 federal election, Richardson attempted to transfer to the Senate, while the Progress Party contested every Western Australian seat in the Australian House of Representatives. However, the party only managed to collect 2.83% of the State vote and Tangney returned to the Liberal Party.
It went on to contest the 1980 state election, but with a significantly lower degree of success. The party is believed to have disbanded after this time, but was credited by academic Marian Sawer for attracting publicity for neo-liberal, economic rationalist ideals.

Onggi

Onggi are Korean ethnic earthenware, which were extensively used as tableware as well as storage containers in Korea. It includes both unglazed earthenware fired near 600~700°C and pottery with a dark brown glaze that burnt over 1100°C.
The origin of "onggi" dates to approximately 4000 to 5000 BC. There were two types of earthenware: a patternless earthenware which is called Mumun pottery and a black and red earthenware. The former, a patternless earthenware, was made with lumps of clay including much fine sand; however, the predecessor of Goryeo celadon and Joseon white porcelain, a black/red earthenware, was being made with only lumps of clay. The color of earthenware is determined by the iron contained in the mud and the way of burning the pottery. The present "onggi" shape dates from the Joseon era. There are many records about onggi in "Sejong Sillok Jiriji" (세종실록지리지, King Sejong's Treatise on Geography): "There are three kilns that make the yellow "onggi" in Chogye-gun and Jinju-mok, Gyeongsang Province" (Lee and Jeong, 16).
Usages.
Compared to porcelain, "onggi" has a microporous structure and has been found to assist in the fermentation of Korean fermented foods such as "gochujang" (chili pepper paste), "doenjang" (soybean paste) and soy sauce. "Onggi" with proper porosity and permeability needs to be used in order to produce an optimally ripened quality in fermented foodstuff. Fine tuned "onggi" containers are, in fact, suitable for many different kinds of fermented products. Since early times, Korea has been famous for fermented foods. In ancient Chinese historiography, in the chapter on Dongyi (烏丸鮮卑東夷傳) in the "Records of Wei" (魏志), which is part of the "Records of the Three Kingdoms" (三國志), there is this remark: "Goguryeo people have a custom of making fermented foods" (Lee and Jeong, 100). The abundance of soybean, which grows naturally in Korea, the fresh fishery resources from the sea surrounding the Korean peninsula and a proper climate for microbial development, all give account of the importance of fermentation as food processing. However, "onggi" ware also contributed to the development of fermented dishes within Korean cuisine.
Features.
"Onggi", made by a specialized group of workmen called "onggijang" (옹기장), has been influenced by the characteristics and climate of the regions where it has been made. Therefore, there are shapes and sizes of "onggi" and ways of manufacturing it that vary from region to region (Jeong, 138). Nevertheless, all "onggi" types share some properties. These are biodegradability, porosity, and rotproofness as well as firmness or "vertebration" (Jeong, 132).
Decomposition, the Biodegradable Nature of Onggi.
When "onggi" is chipped or broken into bits, it decomposes into earth. That is why it is difficult to find old shards of "onggi". Alternatively, when ceramics are broken then can be ground into small chunks and added to clay to lend support in the construction of new pots. It is easier to break down damaged pots and recycle the contents than it is to dig up fresh clay. It is like adding stone to cement for support. Typically once clay is fired it is no longer clay but a new material called ceramic which does not "decompose." The relatively low firing temperature and poreocity of the fired ware make it rather easy to break compared to porcelain ware and thus easy to recycle.
Porosity.
While burning "onggi", the "onggijang" master glazes its surface. This glaze plays a key role in giving a waterproof surface and preventing leaks. Following up, many particles of sand are included in the body of the clay acting as passages for air. This way, air can move through "onggi" while water cannot. Koreans call this action, ""onggi" drawing breath." This is one of the most critical reasons to use "onggi" in making Korean fermented foods.
How to make.
Onggi is made of clay that contains a high percentage of iron. First,the clay is dug out from the ground 3 feet or more deep. the clay is placed in a large basin of water and the clay removed of its large impurities stones bits of roots etc. Then,through levigation it is filtered in a large basin trough a coarse sieve. The clay is placed in a porous eathenware bowl to dry and be workable. When the clay is ready it is rolled and beaten with a wooden mallet to compact it and make it more manageable. When the clay is ready to be worked and shaped, it is placed on a traditional Korean kick wheel. First, a large lump is dusted with powdered clay and placed on the center of the wheel and beaten with a flat angled wooden paddle. Then a large roll twice as long as the circumfence of the clay is flattened around the perimeter of the clay disc, the flat ribbon that is formed is inverted and pinched onto the clay disc with the hand; a smaller roll of clay is then pressed on the inside of the now formed shallow cylinder. Then through beating and pinching, the jar is formed with a paddle and an anvil until it reaches the half way point. The clay is left to dry slightly or forcibly dried with charcoal embers or a large headed blowtorch. Again dried in the sun bowl and wet the lye, and then once again dried and mixed and stir ashes and the clay containing many iron. Thereby glaze painting on an onggi is created. After wet glaze in a bowl and draw patterns and on the body and sufficiently dry that onggi. Finally, bake in the oven to finish the bowl.

Goodrich-Ramus Barn

The Goodrich-Ramus Barn is a historic barn in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. It has been determined eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places on the basis of its historical and architectural significance.
Construction.
The barn was built in 1942 from materials made by Rilco (Rock Island Lumber Company), a subsidiary of Weyerhaeuser located in Albert Lea, Minnesota. The company had a number of premanufactured barn patterns available from a catalog. This method of barn construction became popular in the late 1930s. The roof has a Gothic arch shape formed from laminated timber rafters. The glued laminated timber rafters had been developed in Europe and introduced to the United States in 1934. The United States Department of Agriculture issued a technical bulletin in 1939 on the use of these rafters, and Rilco was founded in Saint Paul, Minnesota that same year. Rilco's marketing literature at the time promoted the rafters as being "factory-fabricated and engineered", and the rafters were shipped predrilled and ready for assembly with all hardware included. 
Masonry work, such as the foundation brick and the clay tile used in the silo, was provided by the Johnston Brothers Clay Works in Fort Dodge, Iowa.
This barn plan was promoted by the Wisconsin Agricultural Experiment Station. The clay tile used for the silo is unusual, because the United States government considered cement safer than tile. The government eventually paid many farmers to demolish their clay tile silos and replace them with cement, but the owners of this barn refused. Both the clay tile and the main barn components were shipped on the Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway north from Fort Dodge and Albert Lea to the Eden Prairie area.
Reuse study.
The barn is located just north of Flying Cloud Airport on the north side of Pioneer Trail, also known as Hennepin County Road 1. Hennepin County had been proposing to widen Pioneer Trail, and they had been considering demolishing the barn to make way for a stormwater retention basin. The city of Eden Prairie conducted a study to determine if the barn was historic. They determined that the barn has historic value. As a result, the city is now looking for an adaptive reuse proposal.
Robert Vogel of Pathfinder CRM, the company doing the reuse study, said, "All barns are special now, there’s so few of them." John Gertz, preservation planner for the city of Eden Prairie, said, “This particular building is an excellent example of the agricultural buildings that Rilco produced. There’s very little wear on this building. ... It doesn’t look like it was used for very long as a dairy barn.”

Austro-Tai languages

Austro-Tai is a hypothesis that the Tai–Kadai and Austronesian language families of southern China and the Pacific are genealogically related. Related proposals include Austric (Wilhelm Schmidt 1906) and Sino-Austronesian (Laurent Sagart 2005b).
Origins.
The Tai–Kadai languages contain numerous similar forms with Austronesian which were noticed as far back as Schlegel in 1901. These are considered to be too many to explain as chance resemblance. The question then is whether they are due to language contact—that is, borrowing—or to common descent—that is, a genealogical relationship.
The evidence.
The first proposal of a genealogical relationship was that of Paul Benedict in 1942, which he expanded upon through 1990. This took the form of an expansion of Wilhelm Schmidt's Austric phylum, and posited that Tai–Kadai and Austronesian had a sister relationship within Austric, which Benedict then accepted. Benedict later abandoned Austric but maintained his Austro-Tai proposal. This remained controversial among linguists, especially after the publication of Benedict (1975) whose methods of reconstruction were idiosyncratic and considered unreliable. For example, Thurgood (1994) examined Benedict's claims and concluded that since the sound correspondences and tonal developments were irregular, there was no evidence of a genealogical relationship, and the numerous cognates must be chalked up to early language contact.
However, the fact that many of the Austro-Tai cognates are found in core vocabulary, which is generally resistant to borrowing, continued to intrigue scholars. There were later several advances over Benedict's approach: Abandoning the larger Austric proposal; focusing on lexical reconstruction and regular sound correspondences; including data from additional branches of Tai–Kadai, Hlai and Kra; using better reconstructions of Tai–Kadai; and reconsidering the nature of the relationship, with Tai–Kadai possibly being a branch (daughter) of Austronesian.
Sagart (2005a) cited a core of regular sound correspondences relating words belonging to the basic vocabulary in Benedict’s work. He pointed out the lack of a substantial body of shared cultural words. He took these facts as indications that Benedict’s Austro-Tai cannot be explained as a contact phenomenon. He further listed a number of specifically Malayo-Polynesian features in the vocabulary shared by Tai-Kadai and Austronesian, concluding that Tai-Kadai is a subgroup within, rather than a related group of, Austronesian.
Ostapirat (2000) reconstructed proto-Kra, one of the least-well attested branches of Tai–Kadai. In (Ostapirat 2005) he presents fifty core vocabulary items found in all five branches of Tai–Kadai, and demonstrated that half of them—words such as "child, eat, eye, fire, hand, head, I, you, louse, moon, tooth, water, this", etc.—can be related to proto-Austronesian by regular sound correspondences, a connection which Reid (2006) finds convincing.
Austronesian is characterized by disyllabic roots, whereas Tai–Kadai is predominantly monosyllabic. It appears that in Tai–Kadai, the first vowel reduced and then dropped out, leaving a consonant cluster which frequently reduced further to a single consonant. For example, the proto-Austronesian root *qudip "live, raw" corresponds to proto-Kra ' > Laha ' and Tai "" "id." (the *-D- consonant is Ostapirat's voiced plosive of undetermined quality, probably alveolar as opposed to dental articulation).
In proto-Tai–Kadai, there appear to have been three tones in words ending in a sonorant (vowel or nasal consonant), labeled simply A, B, C, plus words ending in an stop consonant, D, which did not have tone. In general, Austronesian words ending in a sonorant correspond to A, and words ending in a stop correspond to D. This accounts for most of the words. There are also a few cognates with B and C tone. From Indic borrowings it appears that tone B was originally a final "h" in Tai–Kadai, and some of the corresponding Austronesian roots also end in "h," such as AN *qəmpah "chaff", Kam–Sui "paa"-B (Mulam "kwaa"-B), though there are few examples to go on. Tone C seems to have originally been creaky voice or a final glottal stop. It may correspond to *H, a laryngeal consonant of uncertain manner, in proto-Austronesian (AN *quluH "head", Thai "klau"-C), but again the number of cognates is too low to draw firm conclusions.
Sagart (2004) presented data from a newly described Kra language, Buyang, which—like many other Kra languages—retains the disyllabic roots characteristic of Austronesian. Some examples are:
The "Austronesian Basic Vocabulary Database" project included both Buyang and Old Chinese. It found what it identified in Buyang as 16 retentions in common with Proto-Malayo-Polynesian and 21 retentions in common with Proto-Oceanic (as opposed to five loans) out of a sample of 181 etyma. Old Chinese was identified as having 11 retentions in common with Proto Malayo-Polynesian and 10 retentions in common with Proto-Oceanic out of a sample of 197 Old Chinese etyma.
The relationship.
Among scholars who accept the evidence as definitive, there is disagreement as to the nature of the relationship. Benedict attempted to show that Tai–Kadai has features which cannot be accounted for by proto-Austronesian, and that therefore it must be a separate family coordinate with Austronesian (a sister relationship). Ostapirat concluded that these reconstructed linguistic features are spurious. However, he could not rule out the possibility that Tai–Kadai tone cannot be explained, and so leaves the question open pending further reconstruction of proto-Austronesian. He supports the consensus hypothesis of several scholars that proto-Austronesian was spoken on Formosa or adjacent areas of coastal China, and that the likely homeland of proto-Tai–Kadai was coastal Fujian or Guangdong as part of the neolithic Longshan culture. The spread of the Tai–Kadai peoples may have been aided by agriculture, but any who remained near the coast were eventually absorbed by the Chinese.
Sagart, on the other hand, holds that Tai–Kadai is a branch of Austronesian which migrated back to the mainland from northeastern Formosa long after Formosa was settled, but probably before the expansion of Malayo-Polynesian out of Formosa. The language was then largely relexified from what he believes may have been an Austroasiatic language.
However, Ostapirat maintains that Tai–Kadai could not descend from Malayo-Polynesian in the Philippines, and likely not from the languages of eastern Formosa either. His evidence is in the Tai–Kadai sound correspondences, which reflect Austronesian distinctions that were lost in Malayo-Polynesian and even Eastern Formosan. These are proto-AN *t and *C, also *n and *N, which were distinct in proto-Tai–Kadai but which fell together as *t and *n in proto-MP and Eastern Formosan; and *S, which is *s in proto-Tai–Kadai but *h in proto-MP. There are also Austro-Tai roots which are not attested from Malayo-Polynesian, such as *Cumay "bear". (Western MP has *biRuaŋ.) Such roots are retentions from Proto-Austronesian shared by Tai-Kadai and Formosan, and lost in Malayo-Polynesian, in Sagart's view.
Sagart (2005b) proposes an Eastern Formosan–Malayo-Polynesian connection with Tai–Kadai, based on words such as proto-Tai–Kadai *maNuk and Eastern Formosan *manuk "bird", as compared to proto-Austronesian, where the word for "bird" was *qayam, and *maNuk meant "chicken" (cf. English "fowl", which once meant "bird" but has come to usually refer to chickens and other birds raised for meat), and a few other words such *-mu "thou" which have not been reconstructed for proto-Austronesian. However, Ostapirat notes Tai–Kadai retains the Austronesian *N in this word, which had been lost from Eastern Formosan and Malayo-Polynesian, and that a change in meaning from "chicken" to "bird" could easily have happened independently, for example among proto-Tai–Kadai speakers when they borrowed the mainland word *ki "chicken" (cognate with Old Chinese *kej and Miao /qai/).
Sagart (2004) presents a distinct argument for subgrouping Tai-Kadai with Malayo-Polynesian: he argues that the numerals 5–10, shared by Tai-Kadai, Malayo-Polynesian and three southeastern Formosan languages, are post-proto-Austronesian innovations. Part of the problem of evidence may be due to the loss of the ancestral languages in the Philippines: the uniformity of Philippine languages suggests widespread language replacement after the expected time of the Tai–Kadai split.
Sagart (2005b) suggests that Austronesian (including Tai-Kadai) is ultimately related to the Sino-Tibetan languages, forming a Sino-Austronesian family. The Proto-Sino-Austronesian speakers would have originated from the Neolithic communities of the coastal regions of prehistoric North China or East China. Ostapirat disputes this view, noting that the apparent cognates are rarely found in all branches of Tai–Kadai, and almost none in core vocabulary. Apparent connections with Austroasiatic languages, per Benedict, may be due to language contact when the ancestral Tai–Kadai language reached the mainland.

Southern tick-associated rash illness

Southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI) or Masters' disease is an emerging infectious disease related to Lyme disease that occurs in southeastern and south-central United States. It is spread by tick bites, but the organism that causes the infection is unknown.
Causes.
This illness is a tick-borne disease carried by the Lone Star Tick "Amblyomma americanum". This tick was first proposed as a possible vector of disease in 1984, and the illnesses associated with the tick called "Lyme-like disease", but it was not until the late 1990s that it was recognized that this was distinct from Lyme disease.
Several studies have failed to detect "Borrelia burgdorferi", which is the causative agent of Lyme disease, in patients from the southern United States. It has therefore been proposed that this disease may be caused by the related bacterium "Borrelia lonestari", which is a spirochete that was first isolated in culture in 2004. However, this conclusion is controversial since the spirochete is not detected in all cases of the syndrome, which has led some authors to argue that the illness is not caused by a bacterial pathogen.
Treatment.
Infections are treated with antibiotics, particularly doxycycline, and the acute symptoms appear to respond to these drugs.
Prognosis.
No serious long-term effects are known for this disease, but preliminary evidence suggests that if such symptoms do occur, they are less severe than those associated with Lyme disease.

Thyroid hormone

The thyroid hormones, triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), are tyrosine-based hormones produced by the thyroid gland that are primarily responsible for regulation of metabolism. Iodine is necessary for the production of T3 and T4. A deficiency of iodine leads to decreased production of T3 and T4, enlarges the thyroid tissue and will cause the disease known as goitre. The major form of thyroid hormone in the blood is thyroxine (T4), which has a longer half-life than T3. The ratio of T4 to T3 released into the blood is roughly 20 to 1. T4 is converted to the active T3 (three to four times more potent than T4) within cells by deiodinases (5'-iodinase). These are further processed by decarboxylation and deiodination to produce iodothyronamine (T1a) and thyronamine (T0a). All three isoforms of the deiodinases are selenium-containing enzymes, thus dietary selenium is essential for T3 production.
Function.
The thyronines act on nearly every cell in the body. They act to increase the basal metabolic rate, affect protein synthesis, help regulate long bone growth (synergy with growth hormone) and neural maturation, and increase the body's sensitivity to catecholamines (such as adrenaline) by permissiveness. The thyroid hormones are essential to proper development and differentiation of all cells of the human body. These hormones also regulate protein, fat, and carbohydrate metabolism, affecting how human cells use energetic compounds. They also stimulate vitamin metabolism. Numerous physiological and pathological stimuli influence thyroid hormone synthesis.
Thyroid hormone leads to heat generation in humans. However, the thyronamines function via some unknown mechanism to inhibit neuronal activity; this plays an important role in the hibernation cycles of mammals and the moulting behaviour of birds. One effect of administering the thyronamines is a severe drop in body temperature.
Production.
Central.
[[File:Thyroid hormone synthesis.png|thumb|400px|Synthesis of the thyroid hormones, as seen on an individual thyroid follicular cell:
<br>- Thyroglobulin is synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and follows the secretory pathway to enter the colloid in the lumen of the thyroid follicle by exocytosis.
<br>- Meanwhile, a sodium-iodide (Na/I) symporter pumps iodide (I-) actively into the cell, which previously has crossed the endothelium by largely unknown mechanisms.
<br>- This iodide enters the follicular lumen from the cytoplasm by the transporter pendrin, in a purportedly passive manner.
<br>- In the colloid, iodide (I-) is oxidized to iodine (I0) by an enzyme called thyroid peroxidase.
<br>- Iodine (I0) is very reactive and iodinates the thyroglobulin at tyrosyl residues in its protein chain (in total containing approximately 120 tyrosyl residues).
<br>- In "conjugation", adjacent tyrosyl residues are paired together.
<br>- Thyroglobulin binds the megalin receptor for endocytosis back into the follicular cell.
<br>- Proteolysis by various proteases liberates thyroxine and triiodothyronine molecules, which enter the blood by largely unknown mechanisms.
Thyroid hormones (T4 and T3) are produced by the follicular cells of the thyroid gland and are regulated by TSH made by the thyrotropes of the anterior pituitary gland. The effects of T4 in vivo are mediated via T3 (T4 is converted to T3 in target tissues). T3 is 3- to 5- fold more active than T4.
Thyroxine (3,5,3',5'-tetraiodothyronine) is produced by follicular cells of the thyroid gland. It is produced as the precursor thyroglobulin (this is "not" the same as TBG), which is cleaved by enzymes to produce active T4.
The steps in this process are as follows:
Thyroxine is produced by attaching iodine atoms to the ring structures of tyrosine molecules. Thyroxine (T4) contains four iodine atoms. Triiodothyronine (T3) is identical to T4, but it has one less iodine atom per molecule.
Iodide is actively absorbed from the bloodstream by a process called iodide trapping. In this process, sodium is cotransported with iodide from the basolateral side of the membrane into the cell and then concentrated in the thyroid follicles to about thirty times its concentration in the blood. Via a reaction with the enzyme thyroperoxidase, iodine is bound to tyrosine residues in the thyroglobulin molecules, forming monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT). Linking two moieties of DIT produces thyroxine. Combining one particle of MIT
and one particle of DIT produces triiodothyronine.
Proteases digest iodinated thyroglobulin, releasing the hormones T4 and T3, the biologically active agents central to metabolic regulation.
Peripheral.
Thyroxine is believed to be a prohormone and a reservoir for the most active and main thyroid hormone T3. T4 is converted as required in the tissues by iodothyronine deiodinase. Deficiency of deiodinase can mimic an iodine deficiency. T3 is more active than T4 and is the final form of the hormone, though it is present in less quantity than T4.
Initiation of production in fetuses.
Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is released from hypothalamus by 6 – 8 weeks, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion from fetal pitutary is evident by 12 weeks of gestation, and fetal production of thyroxine (T4) reaches a clinically significant level at 18–20 weeks. Fetal triiodothyronine (T3) remains low (less than 15 ng/dL) until 30 weeks of gestation, and increases to 50 ng/dL at term. Fetal self-sufficiency of thyroid hormones protects the fetus against e.g. brain development abnormalities caused by maternal hypothyroidism.
Effect of iodine deficiency on thyroid hormone synthesis.
If there is a deficiency of dietary iodine, the thyroid will not be able to make thyroid hormone. The lack of thyroid hormone will lead to decreased negative feedback on the pituitary, leading to increased production of thyroid-stimulating hormone, which causes the thyroid to enlarge (the resulting medical condition is called "endemic colloid goiter"; see goiter). This has the effect of increasing the thyroid's ability to trap more iodide, compensating for the iodine deficiency and allowing it to produce adequate amounts of thyroid hormone.
Circulation and transport.
Plasma transport.
Most of the thyroid hormone circulating in the blood is bound to transport proteins. Only a very small fraction of the circulating hormone is free (unbound) and biologically active, hence measuring concentrations of free thyroid hormones is of great diagnostic value.
When thyroid hormone is bound, it is not active, so the amount of free T3/T4 is what is important. For this reason, measuring total thyroxine in the blood can be misleading.
Despite being lipophilic, T3 and T4 cross the cell membrane via carrier-mediated transport, which is ATP-dependent. The thyroid hormones function via a well-studied set of nuclear receptors in the nucleus of the cell, the thyroid hormone receptors.
T1a and T0a are positively charged and do not cross the membrane; they are believed to function via the trace amine-associated receptor (TAR1, TA1), a G-protein-coupled receptor located in the cell membrane.
Another critical diagnostic tool is measurement of the amount of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) that is present.
Membrane transport.
Contrary to common belief, thyroid hormones can not traverse cell membranes in a passive manner like other lipophilic substances. The iodine in "o"-position makes the phenolic OH-group more acidic, resulting in a negative charge at physiological pH. However, at least 10 different active, energy-dependent and genetic-regulated iodothyronine transporters have been identified in humans. They guarantee that intracellular levels of thyroid hormones are higher than in blood plasma or interstitial fluids.
Intracellular transport.
Little is known about intracellular kinetics of thyroid hormones. However, recently it could be demonstrated that the crystallin CRYM binds 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine in vivo.
Measurement.
Thyroxine and triiodothyronine can be measured as "free thyroxine" and "free triiodothyronine", which are indicators of thyroxine and triiodothyronine activities in the body. They can also be measured as "total thyroxine" and "total triiodothyronine", which also depend on the thyroxine and triiodothyronine that is bound to thyroxine-binding globulin. A related parameter is the free thyroxine index, which is "total thyroxine" multiplied by thyroid hormone uptake, which, in turn, is a measure of the unbound thyroxine-binding globulins.
Medical use.
Both T3 and T4 are used to treat thyroid hormone deficiency (hypothyroidism). They are both absorbed well by the gut, so can be given orally. Levothyroxine is the pharmaceutical name (INN) of levothyroxine sodium (T4), which is metabolised more slowly than T3 and hence usually only needs once-daily administration. Natural desiccated thyroid hormones are derived from pig thyroid glands, and are a "natural" hypothyroid treatment containing 20% T3 and traces of T2, T1 and calcitonin.
Also available are synthetic combinations of T3/T4 in different ratios (such as liotrix) and pure-T3 medications (INN: liothyronine).
Levothyroxine Sodium is usually the first course of treatment tried. Some patients feel they do better on desiccated thyroid hormones; however, this is based on anecdotal evidence and clinical trials have not shown any benefit over the biosynthetic forms.
Thyronamines have no medical usages yet, though their use has been proposed for controlled induction of hypothermia, which causes the brain to enter a protective cycle, useful in preventing damage during ischemic shock.
Synthetic thyroxine was first successfully produced by Charles Robert Harington and George Barger in 1926.
Formulations.
Today most patients are treated with levothyroxine, or a similar synthetic thyroid hormone. However, natural thyroid hormone supplements from the dried thyroids of animals are still available. Natural thyroid hormones have become less popular, due to evidence that varying hormone concentrations in the thyroids of animals before they are slaughtered leads to inconsistent potency and stability. Levothyroxine contains T4 only and is therefore largely ineffective for patients unable to convert T4 to T3. These patients may choose to take natural thyroid hormone as it contains a mixture of T4 and T3, or alternatively supplement with a synthetic T3 treatment. In these cases, synthetic liothyronine is preferred due to the potential differences between drug lots of natural thyroid products. It would be counterintuitive to supplement with T4-only if the patient cannot convert T4 to T3. Some natural thyroid hormone brands are F.D.A. approved, but some are not. Thyroid hormones are generally well tolerated. Thyroid hormones are usually not dangerous for pregnant women or nursing mothers, but should be given under a doctor's supervision. In fact, if a woman who is hypothyroid is left untreated, her baby is at a higher risk for birth defects. When pregnant, a woman with a low functioning thyroid will also need to increase her dosage of thyroid hormone. One exception is that thyroid hormones may aggravate heart conditions, especially in older patients; therefore, doctors may start these patients on a lower dose & work up to avoid risk of heart attack.
Related diseases.
Both excess and deficiency of thyroxine can cause disorders.
Preterm births can suffer neurodevelopmental disorders due to lack of maternal thyroid hormones, at a time when their own thyroid is unable to meet their postnatal needs.
Anti-thyroid drugs.
Iodine uptake against a concentration gradient is mediated by a sodium-iodine symporter and is linked to a sodium-potassium ATPase. Perchlorate and thiocyanate are drugs that can compete with iodine at this point. Compounds such as goitrin can reduce thyroid hormone production by interfering with iodine oxidation.

Roy F. Brissenden

Roy Frampton Brissenden (19 April 1919 - 13 March 1999) was a NASA physicist, engineer, teacher and inventor whose pioneering and imaginative work made possible the advancement and accomplishments of the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, and Space Shuttle programs.
Early Life and Family Values.
Roy Frampton Brissenden was born, 19 April 1919, to Henry Frampton and Elsie Ball Brissenden in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, where he received his public education and began his early careers. The eldest of three sons (James and Edward), Roy showed keen interest in aviation from an early age. His parents were persons of strong moral fibre, with solid work ethics and an entrepreneurial bent. These traits, paired with his natural inquisitiveness, became manifest in a character that would eventually produce astonishing results.
The Work Begins.
From age 11, Roy began working in the family business, founded by his father, and acquired a firm grounding in industry, craftmanship and marketing. In 1936, he graduated from R. J. Reynolds High School in Winston-Salem. From 1938 until 1943, while continuing in the family business, he was also employed by Piedmont Publishing, contracting as a distribution manager for the Winston-Salem Journal & Sentinel.
World War II.
During World War II, Roy embarked upon a career which was to prove critical to his life’s work. In 1943, he enlisted in the Army Air Corps as a pilot and flight instructor. An ace pilot, himself, 2nd Lieutenant Brissenden flew P38s, P47s and P51s; and trained cadets in instrument flying in AT6s. Upon his discharge in 1945, Roy joined the Air Force Reserve, and returned to the Winston-Salem Journal & Sentinel, and the family business.
Post-war Academic Career.
After the War, Roy conducted energetic independent study into physics and avionics. In 1951, he entered North Carolina State College at Raleigh to further pursue his dream, earning his baccalaureate degree in Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineering in 1955. He was discharged from the Air Force Reserve the same year. Roy would eventually attend Virginia Polytechnic Institute in Blacksburg, Virginia, in the midst of his NASA career, to acquire his masters degree in the same discipline.
Hampton, Virginia and NACA / NASA Langley.
In 1955, Roy chose to relocate to Hampton, Virginia, having been recruited to join the professional staff of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) at Langley Research Center, later to become National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). His concentration while at NACA/NASA was in the design, construction and training for Rendezvous and Docking Programs. He, alone, designed the Docking Simulator and supervised its construction; employing the expediency and physical means which saved the government several millions of dollars. In the Simulator, Roy personally trained all the Apollo Mission astronauts for lunar orbital flight and landings. The Docking Simulator was his major professional accomplishment. A massive work of engineering artistry and detail, it has been designated as a National Monument, and hangs in perpetual display in the NASA Hangar, Building #1244. During his tenure, Roy was the author or co-author of more than 40 published professional papers. For the design of aeronautic and general scientific equipment and devices, he was the awardee or co-awardee of numerous U.S. patents and of Presidential Citations.

Jónsson function

In mathematical set theory, an ω-Jónsson function for a set "x" of ordinals is a function formula_1 with the property that, for any subset "y" of "x" with the same cardinality as "x", the restriction of formula_2 to formula_3 is surjective on formula_4. Here formula_5 denotes the set of strictly increasing sequences of members of formula_4, or equivalently the family of subsets of formula_4 with order type formula_8, using a standard notation for the family of subsets with a given order type. Jónsson functions are named for Bjarni Jónsson.
Kunen's proof of Kunen's inconsistency theorem uses a Jónsson function for cardinals λ such that 2λ = λℵ0, and Kunen observed that for this special case there is a simpler proof of the existence of Jónsson functions. gave a simple proof for the general case. 
The existence of Jónsson functions shows that for any cardinal there is an algebra with an infinitary operation that has no proper subalgebras of the same cardinality. In particular if infinitary operations are allowed then an analogue of Jónsson algebras exists in any cardinality, so there are no infinitary analogues of Jónsson cardinals.

<doc id="18455671" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18455671" title="The Deniers">
The Deniers

The Deniers is a 2008 book by Lawrence Solomon, a Canadian environmentalist and writer. Subtitled "The world-renowned scientists who stood up against global warming hysteria, political persecution, and fraud," the book draws attention to a number of scientists and others who, according to Solomon, have advanced arguments against what he calls the "alarmist" view of global warming, as presented by Al Gore, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the mainstream media, and others. The book is based on a series of columns Solomon wrote for Canada's "National Post". The book has been severely criticized by some of its subjects, who have sought to distance themselves from their portrayal in the work.
Background.
Solomon states that, as an environmentalist and active member of the Canadian environmental, anti-nuclear, activist organization Energy Probe, he did not originally question the mainstream opinion on global warming or views that sceptics of the climate change consensus were paid shills of the Energy Lobby. Solomon, however, states that he was aware, based on his experiences opposing nuclear power during the 1970s that it was possible, "that scientists with integrity can hold unconventional and upopular views," by dissenting with the conventional wisdom of the day. Solomon states that at a dinner in 2004, his friend and fellow environmentalist Norm Rubin remarked that the science on global warming was "settled." Solomon challenged Rubin to name three climate-change areas that he felt were settled and Solomon would try to find a credible dissenting opinion for each.
To Solomon's stated surprise, he was able to find reputable scientists who Solomon believed disputed conclusions contained in the IPCC's reports on climate change or media reports on global warming issues. Solomon began profiling these scientists in a series of columns for the "National Post" under the title, "The Deniers." The series began on November 28, 2006 with its debut article, "Statistics needed", describing Edward Wegman's report to the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce on the Hockey stick controversy.
By 2007 the series had grown to 38 separate articles. Solomon states that he was frustrated with the limitations of newspaper columns, such as a limit on how much he could write, no footnotes, and no graphs. Thus, Solomon states that he decided to write a book expanding his columns on those he labeled "Deniers."
Three of those profiled by Solomon in his "Deniers" columns disputed his portrayals of their opinions and/or research. Sami Solanki stated on his personal website that Solomon's article was a misleading account of his views and reiterated his belief that manmade greenhouse gases are responsible for global warming and their effects would continue to be felt as concentrations increase. Solanki also stated that he felt that "The National Post" had similarly misquoted other scientists regarding the topic. Nir Shaviv disputed Solomon's 2007 "National Post" profile of some of his opinions and research findings. Shaviv stated on his blog that he was never interviewed by Solomon and that there were several inaccuracies in Solomon's article. Nigel Weiss, "rebutted claims that a fall in solar activity could somehow compensate for the man-made causes of global warming" and "The National Post" retracted the allegation and published an apology. Solanki and Shaviv were included in Solomon's subsequent book; Weiss was not.
Overview.
The book expands Solomon's "National Post" columns about those who he labeled as "Deniers" and who, in Solomon's opinion, dissented in some way from the mainstream opinion on global warming. In the book, Solomon questions the assertion that the “science is settled”, which he believes is claimed by advocates of the "consensus theory" and criticizes the "alarmist" view on global warming. Among the issues raised and alleged flaws presented are the Hockey stick controversy; the Stern Review; hurricane frequency and intensity; the lack of signs of global warming in Antarctica's climate; reservations on the predictability of climate models and its lack of falsifiability; the Singer-Revelle-Gore controversy; and the alternate solar variation theory, regarding the hypotheses of the warming being driven by the interaction of the solar wind with cosmic rays affecting cloud formation. Each chapter includes end notes with references and website addresses.
Those mentioned in the book are, in order of appearance in the book’s chapters: Edward Wegman, Richard Tol, Christopher Landsea, Duncan Wingham, Robert M. Carter, Richard Lindzen, Vincent R. Gray, Syun-Ichi Akasofu, Tom Segalstad, Nir Shaviv, Zbigniew Jaworowski, Hendrik Tennekes, Freeman Dyson, Antonino Zichichi, David Bromwich, Eigil Friis-Christensen, Henrik Svensmark, Sami Solanki, Jasper Kirkby, Habibullo Abdussamatov, George Kukla, Rhodes Fairbridge, William M. Gray, Cliff Ollier, Paul Reiter, Claude Allègre, Reid Bryson, David Bellamy, and the cautious position of Roger Revelle. A brief curriculum vitae for each scientist is presented. In the final chapter, Mr. Solomon presents his personal point of view on the climate change debate.
Reasons for title.
The term ""The Deniers"" is controversial even among some of those profiled in the book, which often raises the question of why Solomon would choose it as the title for both his book and its related newspaper series. In explaining his decision, Soloman writes:
Reception.
In a review in "The Washington Times", Shawn Macomber, a contributing editor to The American Spectator, described "The Deniers" as "a timely, necessary antidote to a political and scientific discussion poisoned by hubristic groupthink and...scorched earth (mis)behavior."
In "The Vancouver Sun", a book review by Mark Milke, the Frontier Centre's senior fellow in Alberta, said "The Deniers" "is about the search for scientific explanations for a complex phenomenon by eminent scientists in a better position than most to judge whether a consensus exists on global warming. Their collective verdict, much varied in the particulars, is "No."
A rebuttal was published by Richard Littlemore, the senior writer at the climate change website DeSmogBlog, who said that Solomon himself had described the dissident scientists as "quibblers" and he was right: "The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says there's only a 90-plus-per-cent likelihood that global warming endangers the world as we know it."
In "Forbes", George Gilder of the Discovery Institute wrote: "For investors who know that human-caused global warming is hokum, as proved by the new book The Deniers by Lawrence Solomon, this is a supreme moment of contrarian upside promise."
Gordon McBean, in a review for "", found the book biased and inaccurate. McBean concluded that the book, "Is not useful, nor is it worthy of recommendation."

Roketsan Cirit

Cirit is a laser-guided 70 mm rocket system under production by Turkish missile manufacturer Roketsan. It is one of the projects launched by Turkey to equip the Turkish Army's T-129 Atak, AH-1P Cobra and AH-1W Super Cobra attack helicopters with low-cost precision strike capabilities. It has been selected by Eurocopter for execution of a test and integration program to equip the Eurocopter EC635. The weapon's name comes from a traditional Turkish horseback game, Cirit, where two teams of riders fight a mock battle using wooden javelins.
Description.
Cirit is a next generation 70 mm (2.75 in) guided rocket system fitted with a semi-active laser homing seeker. The seeker and guidance section is attached to a purpose-built warhead with a Class 5 Insensitive Munition (IM). The multipurpose warhead has a combined armour-piercing ammunition with enhanced behind armor anti-personnel and incendiary effects. The engine is of reduced smoke design, with IM properties. It is connected to the rear section by a roll bearing that enables it to rotate in flight. There are four small stabilising surfaces at the very rear of the missile in front of the exhaust nozzle that ensures stable flight. Roketsan has developed a new launch pod and a new canister in which Cirit is delivered as an all-up round. The Cirit has a maximum effective guided range of 8 km with a high probability of hit on a 3×3 m target at this range.
Development.
Initial work on the Cirit design began in 2004 and it was first shown in public during IDEF 2007.
Roketsan had opted not to follow the lead of other similar 70 mm (2.75 in) guided rocket programmes and has developed the Cirit as an all-up round and not as an add-on guidance kit for existing unguided rounds. This has seen the company work on several new components for the rocket including its semi-active laser seeker, actuation and control systems, bearings, computer hardware and software.
Multipurpose high performance warhead, motor and specific container were designed and developed by TUBITAK-SAGE.
The Cirit is designed for use with existing 70 mm rocket launchers such as the LAU-61, LAU-68, LAU-130, LAU-131, M260 and M261. Roketsan is also developing a new series of digital launchers, with seven and 19 tubes, to take advantage of the Cirit's MIL-STD-1760 databus capabilities.
January 12, 2010, Roketsan's Cirit is the first 2.75" laser guided rocket to engage moving targets. Cirit successfully engaged a moving target travelling at 60 km/h while the platform (AH-1W Super Cobra) it was fired from was moving at 220 km/h (120 knots).
May 12, 2011, Roketsan signed an agreement with Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) for the integration of its Cirit Smart Launcher System on the T-129 attack helicopter.

Hugo Rodríguez-Alcalá (born in Asunción, Paraguay in 1917 - died on November 2007 at Buenos Aires, Argentina, at the age of 90) was a Paraguayan writer, essayist, poet, narrator and literature critic. Doctorate in Laws and Social Sciences by the National University of Asunción in 1943, and in Philosophy and Literature by the Wisconsin University in 1953.
Career.
He was a fine poet and an advanced critic. Maybe he was the most notable critic from Paraguay. He investigated a lot in the poetry and narrative from Paraguay, giving to know books that approaches us not just to the writer and his social context, but also instruct us, level us to the logic, because with his concise writing technique made possible the easy understanding of our literature.
Master of Arts in Foreign Languages (University of Washington, 1949), he retired after almost 40 years of superior teaching in universities as the Columbia University, the Rutgers University, the University of Washington, the University of California, among others. During that period he resided in the USA.
He was the founder and first director of the Department of Hispanic Studies of the University of California, Riverside. Returned to Asunción in 1982 where he directed the Short Story Literary Workshop since 1983 and collaborating with many magazines and literary sections –both local and foreign– of the subject.
He was chief writer of the "Commemorative Series" from the University of California, member of the editorial council of many important literary magazines.
He directed the collection "Cuentos de Taller" (Stories from Workshop) from his Short Story Workshop, created in the Club Centenario, having 5 books published (1983, 1985, 1988, 1990, 1992) plus one more in 1994.

Primer Recuerdo (First Memory).
Primero fue la lluvia
Fue la ilusión primera.
Vi una puerta entreabierta
que daba a un patio.
Vi sobre baldosas crearse y deshacerse
copas brillantes, sin ruido.
Vi las mojadas plantas,
vi el paredón mojado,
vi el viento impetuoso
que aplastaba
las copas instantáneas sobre el piso.
Vi contra el cielo oscuro
un tremolar de sábanas de fuego.
Vi el agua, el agua interminable
sobre los vahos del verano.
Vi, dentro, luz eléctrica:
vi unas figuras vagas
mirar la lluvia.
Yo, tras cristales húmedos,
estaba, en brazos fuertes, mudo y tibio
Afuera, la frescura
y la cristalería renovada
sobre el piso.
Y el viento rápido
que iba y volvía impetuoso…
Fue la ilusión primera.
Fue el principio del mundo.

Metro Richmond Zoo

Metro Richmond Zoo is a privately owned, for-profit zoo in Chesterfield County, Virginia. It is located in the central Virginia area, on the western side of I-95. Metro Richmond Zoo encompasses about and houses around 1,400 animals representing over 150 species, including reticulated giraffe, white rhinoceros, snow leopard, cheetah and Grant's zebra.
The zoo is accredited by the Zoological Association of America (ZAA), and has one of the largest primate collections in the United States.
History.
In 1980 Jim Andelin, then 27 years old, began collecting animals. This hobby turned into a full-time profession, and eventually land was allocated solely for his collection. The zoo was opened to the public on April 22, 1995, and was home to 167 animals of 15 species at the time. Many animals were donated to the zoo; in 1999, the zoo received 38 animals.
Animals and exhibits.
The Metro Richmond Zoo is noted for giraffe-feeding opportunities and its display of white Bengal tigers. Visitors can purchase zoo treats for giraffe feeding. The zoo houses a herd of nine reticulated giraffe and a single Masai giraffe, kept in a yard across from the main giraffe exhibit along with another Reticulated Giraffe. Animals residing with the giraffes include Eastern bongo, klipspringer, ostrich, black-necked swan, Stanley crane and crowned crane. Visitors can also purchase zoo treats for deer, goats, sheep, donkeys, and young antelope in the children's farm. Some of the larger animals can be fed zoo treats via tubes that reach to their feeding troughs. Those animals are dromedaries, Bactrian camels, elk, American bison, and warthog.
The zoo has one of the largest collections of primates in the United States, with more than 200 individuals representing 30 species, such as Sulawesi macaque, Diana monkey, orangutan, Cottontop tamarin, Red-handed tamarin, Black-handed spider monkey, Lesser spot-nosed monkey, Coppery titi, Eastern black-and-white colobus, Ring-tailed lemur, Red ruffed lemur and Black-and-white ruffed lemur . The zoo has the world's best Diana Monkey breeding program.
2003 was the opening year of the zoo's safari sky ride, a fifteen-minute ride that gives visitors a high view of much of the zoo. 2003 was also the year the North American area of the zoo opened. This exhibit is home to elk, bison, white-tailed deer, pronghorn, American alligator and bighorn sheep live there.
2006 was the opening year for the Jungle Carousel, Coconut Climb, and Kiddie Rides.
2007 saw the opening of an aviary near the zoo entrance containing roseate spoonbill, sacred ibis, and multiple species of waterfowl such as yellow-billed duck, Mandarin duck, paradise shelduck, ringed teal, common shelduck, rosybill and red-crested pochard. The aviary also houses Golden Pheasants, Lady Amherst's Pheasants and Swinhoe's Pheasants. Adjacent to the aviary is a flock of Chilean flamingos.
A $250,000 expansion in 2008 introduced a safari-like ride through a new animal enclosure, with visitors in a two-car "train". The enclosure includes gemsbok, waterbuck, greater kudu, eland, lowland nyala, Thomson's gazelle, yellow-backed duiker, marabou stork, Stanley crane, Rüppell's griffon vulture, Baird's tapir, and ostrich.
Adjacent to the safari enclosure is a large wooded valley viewable only from the safari train and a small viewing deck. Four species of ungulates native to India and China reside in this exhibit. They are blackbuck, mouflon, Himalayan tahr and takin. The Metro Richmond Zoo is one of the few zoos in the United States to have takin on display, as it is considered a national treasure in China and receives the same protection as the giant panda. The exhibit opened in 2003.
Near the station where the visitors get on the zoo train is an African penguin exhibit where visitors can view an educational penguin feeding program at 11:00 am and 4:00 pm. Around the penguin exhibit are enclosures containing red river hog, African clawless otter, camels, and nearby is a South American exhibit containing specimens such as Brazilian tapir, greater rhea, llama, alpaca, king vulture, toucans, and new world primates, along with crested fireback and southern white-faced scops owl. A bat house is adjacent to the king vulture enclosure, and contains Indian flying fox, straw-colored fruit bat, two-toed sloth and prehensile-tailed porcupine. Nearby is an aviary containing blue-and-yellow macaws, salmon-crested cockatoos, red-crowned amazons, creasted screamers, Reeve's pheasants and an African grey parrot.
2008 saw the debut of a coconut-climb and a walk-through aviary for about 400 budgerigars. The aviary offers seed-coated Popsicle sticks that visitors can purchase to attract the birds to perch and feed.
New arrivals in 2010 and 2011 were golden pheasant, white-faced saki, Kirk's dik-dik, steenbok, great white pelican, marabou stork, Himalayan tahr, yellow-backed duiker, toco toucan, red-billed toucan, black howler monkey, crested screamer, Reeve's pheasant and Allen's swamp monkey. More exhibits are currently being built, including a large reptile and small mammal building near the zoo entrance, and many small enclosures around the safari paddock.
In late July 2012, the zoo opened an enclosure that houses Farley and Zoe, two juvenile orangutans. Guests can interact and come face-to-face with Farley and Zoe through glass windows. Adjacent to the orangutans are a pair of White Handed Gibbons.
Early 2013 saw the opening of a new Meerkat enclosure alongside the currently under construction reptile and small mammal building. In late March 2013, a new jungle gym for children to play in was built next door the safari skyride, replacing an exhibit that once held Indian muntjacs, Stanley cranes, and African spurred tortoises. The Indian muntjacs have been moved to a non-public area, the Stanley cranes had moved to the Safari Ride and the African spurred tortoises had moved near the orangutan island. In mid-April 2013, a Baird's tapir and a Ruppell's griffon vulture were added to the zoo, and can be seen in a safari-ride preserve area. A capybara was added to the South America yard in late April 2013.
In October 2013, five cheetah cubs were born to parents Lana and Kitu. The cubs quickly gained global attention because they were only the third litter born in the U.S. in 2013. The cubs are in the Zoo's off-exhibit Cheetah Breeding Center. The Zoo set up Cheetah Cams to give 24/7 footage to the public. http://www.metrorichmondzoo.com/cheetahcam.shtml The cubs were named after Virginia counties and cities: Richie (Richmond), Rico (Henrico), Chester (Chesterfield), Amelia (Amelia), and Hanna (Hanover). The Zoo hopes to have them on public display in spring 2014.
In fall 2013 the Zoo installed Treetop Zoofari, a new zipline and adventure park. http://www.treetopzoofari.com The park is scheduled to open January 29, 2014 for Fridays and Saturdays only. It will open Monday-Saturday in spring 2014. 
The zoo allows Indian peafowl, bar-headed geese, barnacle geese, Egyptian geese and West Indian whistling ducks to roam freely among the visitors. The zoo is also a rest stop for wild Virginia-native waterfowl such as wood duck, mallards and Canada geese.
There are also many animals, such as Malayan tapirs and demoiselle cranes, in areas that are inaccessible to the public, but are still somewhat viewable from parts of the zoo.
Miracle of Christmas Live at the Zoo.
Every year, the Metro Richmond Zoo hosts a Christmas pageant on December 21, 22, and 23. The zoo is decorated with thousands of Christmas lights, wreaths, and trees. The fifteen-minute outdoor pageant celebrates the birth of Jesus Christ. For the 2012 season, one show will be presented in Spanish. The Miracle of Christmas features live animals from the zoo.
Research projects and conservation efforts.
Metro Richmond Zoo participates in several scientific research and wild life conservation projects. The zoo also plays a key part in addax and Eastern bongo conservation. The bongo herd has had several calves born in the past several years and many of the addax born at the zoo have been released to the wild. Other threatened and endangered animals living here include Asian black bear, Galapagos giant tortoise, and black-and-white ruffed lemur.

Arthur Wade-Evans

Arthur Wade Wade-Evans (born Arthur Wade Evans) (31 August 1875 – 4 January 1964) was a Welsh clergyman and historian.
Biography.
Evans was born in Fishguard, Pembrokeshire, in south Wales on 31 August 1875 and did not include his mother's maiden name in his surname until 1899, when he was 24 years old. His father, Titus Evans, was a master mariner. Evans was educated at Haverfordwest grammar school. In 1893, he matriculated at Jesus College, Oxford, graduating in 1896. He was ordained deacon in St Paul's Cathedral in 1898 and then served as curate in various parishes, including Ealing, Cardiff, and English and Welsh Bicknor. In 1909, he was appointed vicar of France Lynch, where he remained until 1926. He campaigned for the disestablishment of the Church in Wales. He was, from 1926 to 1932, vicar of Potterspury with Furtho and Yardley Gobion (1926–32), before his final appointment as rector of Wrabness from 1932 to 1957. He then retired to Frinton-on-Sea, Essex. He died on 4 January 1964.
He was a historian of early Britain, the Celtic church and Welsh law, although some of his theories were unorthodox. He translated and studied many early historical sources, with his publications including "Nennius's "History of the Britons"" (1938) "Coll Prydain" (1950) and "The Emergence of England and Wales" (1956, 1959). Church history publications included journal articles on the lives of the saints and on church plate, "Parochiale Wallicanum" (1911), an analysis and translation of the Latin text of the "Life of St David" (1923), and "Welsh Christian Origins" (1934). He also edited "Vitae Sanctorum Britanniae et Genealogiae", an invaluable edition of Welsh saints' lives, mostly from the British Library Manuscript Vespasian A.xiv. He was also a contributor to many journals and newspapers. In 1909, he published "Welsh Medieval Law", a translation of Llyfr Cyfnerth; he later wrote an article on Welsh law for the "Encyclopædia Britannica".

Red River Gorge Climbers' Coalition

The Red River Gorge Climbers' Coalition (RRGCC) is an advocacy group for rock climbers in the Red River Gorge, Kentucky. Through relationships with local stakeholders and climbers from all over the world, the RRGCC has worked hard to maintain sustainable access throughout one of the world's top climbing destinations.
History.
The Red River Gorge Climbers’ Coalition was organized in November 1996 as a local climber’s advocacy group to protect climbing at the Red River Gorge. Rock climbing in the Red River Gorge area had originally occurred primarily on the public lands of Daniel Boone National Forest and was therefore subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Forest Service. In 1996 the Forest Service issued for the first time ever a Rock Climbing Management Guide for the Red River area. This guide, or RCMG, was viewed negatively by climbers. As a direct result of the issuance of the RCMG, two local climbers decided to form a climbers’ coalition to champion climbers’ interests and to try to improve relations between the Forest Service and climbers. Their main concern was twofold, re-writing the RCMG to include climbers’ input and thereby “improving” it and educating and empowering climbers to ensure the long-term future of climbing.
Today the RRGCC has grown to a several hundred member-strong, all volunteer, advocacy group that continues to work with the US Forest Service on ensuring access to climbing in the Daniel Boone National Forest. The Coalition has also expanded its efforts to include working with the Natural Bridge State Park, and many local private land owners as well. The RRGCC’s main focus has been from its inception, protection and promotion of responsible climbing. This goal has taken many forms, from building environmentally friendly climber trails to popular crags, to articles in its quarterly newsletter on top-rope safety. Climbing continues to grow in popularity and change, and so do the issues surrounding it. For people to continue to enjoy the freedom to climb on public and private land, innovative and creative solutions will have to be sought. On February 7, 2000 the Red River Gorge Climbers’ Coalition and the U.S. Forest Service signed a Memorandum of Understanding. The signing of this MOU represents a significant breakthrough for Red River Gorge climbers and the Forest Service after years of skepticism, mistrust, and alienation.

Staff
Pendergrass-Murray Recreational Preserve (PMRP).
The Pendergrass-Murray Recreational Preserve, or the PMRP, is of land now owned and maintained by the RRGCC. This land, now open to the public, is a commitment to preserving and sustaining climbing access in the Red River Gorge indefinitely.
In the 1990s, as climbing grew in popularity as a sport, the RRGCC Coalition formed with the intent of permanently securing access to climbing in the Red River Gorge region. However, being on the East Coast, most of the climbing opportunities were available only on private property or Forest Service land. In 1996, the USFS enacted a bolting ban on its land, effectively ending the development of sport climbing in those areas. While working with the Forest Service to improve relations and explore the options, the Coalition was also working with private landowners to secure access to climbing and development. With the rising popularity of climbing, though, to be a touchy situation since relations grew increasingly tense with landowners and their wishes to maintain their privacy and independence.
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the potential for development, particularly sport climbing, was discovered in the Southern Region, where steep, beautiful sandstone walls are overhanging and pocketed and offer technical, dynamic, and endurance climbing. As word spread and climbers flocked to the Bald Rock Fork and Coal Bank Hollow areas, conflicts arose between climbers and oil companies in the region, especially related to limited parking causing road blocks. The first well known and developed areas The Motherlode lies on private land just outside PMRP. With over 50 routes in 5.11-5.14 range, it is one of the most well known destination for hard climbing in the region. Other climbing areas in PMRP hostes more than 500 climbs, ranging from 5.4 to 5.14c, with new climbs constantly being discovered and developed. The property hosts several hundred climbers each weekend, with the three parking lots often reaching capacity by noon. 
In 2004, when more than of land in the Southern Region came available, the RRGCC, recognizing the opportunity to secure access in the area, moved quickly to purchase the land. Negotiating with the Murray family, the Coalition and the Murray's reached an agreement and the ownership of the land was transferred to the RRGCC. To finance the purchase, the RRGCC worked out an owner-financed mortgage of 8% a year for 10 years. With a few maintenance costs, the final yearly costs translate to nearly $30,000 per year. Today, paying this mortgage is the main focus of the RRGCC and is the motivation to its aggressive fundraising efforts. The payments are financed from private donations and from support of The Access Fund a national climbing advocacy organization.

Cowsay

cowsay is a program which generates ASCII pictures of a cow with a message. It can also generate pictures using pre-made images of other animals, such as Tux the Penguin, the Linux mascot. Since it is written in Perl, it is adaptable to other systems such as Microsoft Windows. There is also a related program called cowthink, with cows with thought bubbles rather than speech bubbles. .cow files for cowsay exist which are able to produce different variants of "cows", with different kinds of "eyes", and so forth. It is sometimes used on IRC, desktop screenshots, and in software documentation. It is more or less a joke within hacker culture, but has been around long enough that its use is rather widespread. In 2007 it was highlighted as a Debian package of the day.
Cowsay and Cowthink are written in the Perl programming language, and as such is easily adaptable to system tasks in Unix, such as telling users their home directories are full, they have new mail, etc. Additionally, it is quite adaptable to the Common Gateway Interface.
Example.
The Unix command fortune can also be piped into the cowsay command:
And using the parameter -f followed by tux, one can replace the cow with Tux, the Linux mascot:

Texas A&amp;M Aggies baseball

The Texas A&M Aggie baseball team represents Texas A&M University in NCAA Division I college baseball. The team will play its first season in the Southeastern Conference in 2013. The Aggies plays home games at Olsen Field at Blue Bell Park. The team is currently led by head coach Rob Childress.
History.
Texas A&M baseball has compiled an all-time record of 2514-1401-42 (.635 winning percentage) through the 2013 season. The Aggies have won 19 conference championships, 15 in the Southwest Conference and four in the Big 12. Texas A&M has made 29 NCAA tournament appearances, advancing to the College World Series five times, in 1951, 1964, 1993, 1999. and 2011. Despite a rich winning tradition, the Aggies have yet to win a game in the CWS, going a combined 0-10. The most recent trip to the 2011 College World Series saw the Aggies lose a close one to eventual champions (and future conference mates) South Carolina, 5-4, and to a scrappy Cal team, 7-3.
The early years (1894-1958).
The history of Texas A&M baseball began in 1894, when the team played its first game in school history. No games were recorded for the following nine years from 1895 to 1903. Seventeen different head coaches led A&M baseball from 1904 to 1958, including football coaches Charley Moran, Dana X. Bible, and Homer Norton. During this period, A&M finished 626-469-27 record (.572 winning percentage), claimed seven Southwest Conference titles, and made their first ever trip to the College World Series in 1951.
Tom Chandler era (1959-1984).
Tom Chandler came to Texas A&M as an assistant to head coach Beau Bell in 1958. He took over as head coach in 1959 and immediately won the Southwest Conference championship in his first year. Over the next 25 years at the helm, Chandler led the Aggies to four more conference championships and an appearance in the 1964 College World Series. His teams finished 660-329-10 (.667 winning percentage). Chandler was honored for his accomplishments by being inducted into the American Association of Baseball Coaches Hall of Fame. His jersey now displays on the left field wall at Olsen Field in recognition of his contributions.
Mark Johnson era (1985-2005).
Mark Johnson, an assistant under Tom Chandler, assumed head coaching duties in 1985 and guided the program for just over two decades. During that time, his teams put together an impressive record of 876-431-3 (.670 winning percentage) and made College World Series appearances in 1993 and 1999. Johnson's highly ranked teams and powerful offenses in the late 80's and throughout the 90's brought excitement and increased attendance to Olsen Field. The 1989 Aggies went 58-7 but were upset by #12 LSU twice in the College Station Regional. His #7 jersey hangs on the right field wall at Olsen Field in honor of his service to A&M. Johnson's 876 wins are the most in Texas A&M history.
Rob Childress era (2006-present).
In 2006, Texas A&M hired then Nebraska associate head coach and pitching coach Rob Childress to take over the program. After struggling to a losing record his first year, Childress has guided the Aggies to a 323–182–2 (.637) record, two Big 12 championships, and a College World Series appearance in 2011. Childress has led the Aggies to the post season 7 years in a row, beginning in 2007 (the longest streak in Aggie history).
Stadium.
The Aggies play at Olsen Field at Blue Bell Park, named in honor of C. E. "Pat" Olsen, a 1923 graduate of Texas A&M University and a former baseball player in the New York Yankees farm system. The field opened in 1978 and underwent major renovation after the 2011 season. Average attendance in 2011 was just under 4000 per game.

<doc id="18456016" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18456016" title="John Gunthorpe">
John Gunthorpe

John Gunthorpe (died 1498) was an English administrator, Keeper of the Privy Seal and Dean of Wells.
Education and career.
He was a student at Cambridge University and he had already entered into clergyship and had received holy orders. By private appointment Gunthorpe served as a secretary to Queen Elizabeth I. By 1452 he was the master of the arts at Cambridge University and served as a junior proctor in 1454-5. Gunthorpe traveled to Italy and was in Ferrara in August 1460. He had been attending lectures of Guarino on rhetoric at Ferrara. His teacher Guarino died at the end of 1460 and this may be why Gunthorpe moved on. In January 1462 Gunthorpe was formally taken into papal service. Pope Pius II examined Gunthorpe for fitness, and the pope appointed Gunthorpe as a papal chaplain and a minor penitentiary in St. Peter’s Basilica and in the Papal Curia. From 1460-1465 Gunthorpe went through a period of post-graduate study in Italy where he perfected his Latin rhetorical style. He also learned Greek and presumably Italian, and gained experience in the international arena of the papal court.
Service under the King.
Gunthorpe returned to England in 1465 and became intimately integrated into the religious, diplomatic, financial, and political life of the court and government of Edward IV. Gunthorpe's involvement in Anglo-Castilian diplomacy concluded in 1470 when he was one of the ambassadors commissioned on 14 March by King Edward IV to embark upon an ultimately fruitless effort to persuade Enrique IV against the repudiation of the treaty between their kingdoms. Gunthorpe was in the royal household as a king’s chaplain by the summer of 1466.
1468-1476.
In 1468, he returned to Cambridge University and was granted a baccalaureate in theology. On 9 December 1468, Gunthorpe became the king’s almoner. The almoner was the person who had charge of the king’s charities from gifts of money to the distribution of surplus food from the king’s table and the office can be traced back at least to the twelfth century. John Gunthorpe was the first person on record to have been called ‘King High Almoner’. Gunthorpe was also a warden.
In 1472, Gunthorpe became a monk at St. Stephen’s chapel and remained a monk of St. Stephen’s for the rest of his life. He was also a monk of many other chapels. However, even though he was a monk at all of these chapels, his place of residency was with the king. In 1476 Gunthorpe became dean of the king’s household chapel. The dean had supervisory authority over every aspect of the chapel’s function.
Later life.
On 10 November 1481 a group of nine men, among whom Gunthorpe was named first, obtained a royal license to found and endow a guild in the parish church of St. Mary in North Somercotes, Lincolnshire. In 1483 Gunthorpe’s patron and benefactor, while King Edward IV dies at Westminster Palace on 9 April. On 10 May 1483 Gunthorpe was appointed keeper of the privy seal under the authority of Richard of Gloucester. Richard had formally been named protector two days before and Richard as King reappointed Gunthorpe on 27 June The appointment was reiterated on 6 July, the day Richard III magnificent coronation ceremony in Westminster Abbey. John was the only keeper of the Privy seal to serve Richard III. He was not seen as a very smart choice of keeper since he was the former secretary of Queen Elizabeth and Richard was fearful of a Woodville faction in 1483.
While serving keeper of the privy seal, Gunthorpe served his king in Anglo-Scottish diplomacy by truce-making in Scotland, extension of a truce with Francis II, duke of Brittany, and he also helped work out a truce with the Tudor family in Brittany in October 1483 - it was extended to 1492
Why picked?
Gunthorpe's geographical origins might have recommended him to Richard in 1483 and Gunthorpe was a learned man. But it was because of the perennial enigma of Richard III that brings attention to Gunthorpe. In 1485, Richard III gave Gunthorpe a present- the swans in the waters of Somerset, the swans had a long association with royalty and chivalry.
Tudor Authority.
Richard III died on August 22, 1485 and Gunthorpe went to service under Henry Tudor - Henry VII. Also soon after Richard III died Gunthorpe became the resident Dean of Wells. As the Dean of Wells, Gunthorpe’s interests extended into the judicial sphere though the court Christian within his authority.
He presided over many cases including the cases of John Pope, as well as others.
Last Years and Death.
In the last year of his life, Gunthorpe found himself playing host to the king. Gunthorpe was a man of learning, a rhetorician and linguist, a priest and theologian, and an experienced diplomat and secretary. Gunthorpe is not survived by substantial literary remains.
On 5 June 1498, John Gunthorpe died. He is buried in St. Katherine’s Chapel.
He answered the call of three kings to a wide variety of royal service, and moved smoothly in the highest circles of ecclesiastical and secular authority.

Jorge Moreno

Jorge Moreno is an American musician of Cuban descent.
Moreno won much critical acclaim for his debut album and was awarded a Latin Grammy award for "Best New Artist", Early the next year he nominated in the (Anglo) Grammy's for "Best Latin Album" and was one of the first artists to perform in Spanish on Good Morning America.
He also received much praise and a Univision Nomination for his avant gard Self Directed Video for his track "Mi Sufrimiento", in which Moreno Humorusly confesses that the record company would not pay for another video so he did it himself.
After the dissolution of Maverick, Moreno went indie and was soon asked by Clive Davis to record a track "Satellite" with none other than Carlos Santana for the movie soundtrack Miramax film "Havana Nights" produced by Moreno's first producer Lester Mendez (Shakira).
Moreno then proceeded to release his second album cleverly titled "El Segundo" which started to gather more critical acclaim but was lost at radio in a wave of Reggaeton fad.
Moreno can also add TV Producer to his many talents, he opened a Production company on South beach named Beach Pictures which focuses on Docu-Reality content.
Early life.
Jorge Moreno was born on April 23, 1975 in Miami, Florida. His parents emigrated from Cuba to Miami during the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista. In the 1970s and 1980s, his father Antonio "TONY" Moreno was a well known and respected executive producer whom operated several well-known salsa labels. His mother, Melba, was a huge fan of 1950s and 1960s pop and rock acts such as Frankie Valli, Elvis Presley, and Dion.
As a teenager, he was most interested in punk and alternative American rock music. "Then I had my gothic phase, and I still love a lot of those bands", he told Hispanic Magazine. "But, the thing is, I was rebelling against conformity and commercial music. But the time came when I realized I was becoming as closed-minded as the people I was rebelling against." In his late teens, he began to discover classic Cuban crooners such as the legendary Beny Moré. This renewed interest in Latin music would yield an unusual mix that wasn't necessarily welcome on Miami's conventional Latin music scene.
Education.
The list of schools Moreno has attended start with Dade Christian, Palms Springs Elementary, Immaculate Conception, Edison Private, Hialeah Gardens Academy, Miami Lakes Jr, Belen, Miami Aerospace Military (Boarding School), Pace High, Miami High and Finally Coral Gables Sr. High. In his junior year of high school, Moreno joined two friends in a musical trio that melded all of these musical influences into a "a Latin Beatles-ish sort of rock." The band broke up three years later and Moreno left to study film and photography at New World School of the Arts and then Later University of Miami. In the meantime, however, he continued to compose and improve upon his guitar-playing skills. In 1996, upon deciding that he wanted to dedicate his life exclusively to music, he began recording demos---off-the-wall creations. He spent the next five years making demos, which he reportedly sent to record executives in pizza boxes in order to get their attention. Experimentation over this period forged a new sound that mixed these varied musical interests with the sounds of the 1950s that he had grown up with. ""If you take Beny Moré, Paul McCartney, and Radiohead, placed them in a car, and shook it up a bit, that would be my sound", Moreno would later tell LatinStyleMag.com.
Career.
Moreno got a break when EMI Music Publishing took him on as a songwriter. It was then that he caught the attention of Madonna's Latin music label, Maverick Música, and hooked up with established producers Lester Méndez, A.T. Molina, and Andrés Levin. The result was Moreno's slickly produced debut album in 2001. One review referred to Moreno as "a fascinating, occasionally almost surreal melding of traditional and modern Latin styles, '60s Top 40, B-movie soundtrack music, '90s synth pop, alternative rock, and even a little hip-hop, the album defies easy categorization." The album's bicultural mix of disparate musical influences took the United States-based Latin music industry by storm.
"Not since Santana has a U.S.-based Latin performer captured bicultural sensibilities in such a seamless, accessible and original way", stated a review in the Los Angeles Times. "Moreno might even manage to put Miami on the musical map after decades of mediocrity from the so-called capital of Latin music."
Using his training as a film student, Moreno produced his own music video for the pop ballad "Mi Sufrimiento", consisting of a single shot of the artist lip synching at home, with the streaming subtitles "Madonna owns my label .. Maybe I can get her to be in my video." The video became one of MTV Es biggest hits of the year and showed that Moreno was not your typical pop artist.
After years of relative anonymity, Moreno became an overnight sensation with an alternative version of the song "Babalú", popularized for American audiences by the late Cuban-born artist Desi Arnaz, who was best known for his role as Ricky Ricardo on the 1950s television comedy I Love Lucy, in which he starred alongside his wife, the famous actress and comedienne Lucille Ball. Moreno knew that he wanted to pay tribute to the song on his first album, and he later appeared on the CBS I Love Lucy's 50th Anniversary Special, hosted by the children of Arnaz and Ball. His appearance on the program sparked public interest in an artist previously unknown to the greater public.
In 2002, Moreno won the 2002 Latin Grammy Award for Best New Artist, and in 2003 his album Moreno received a Grammy nomination for Best Latin Pop Album. Despite mainstream success and the "pretty-boy pouty" look of his album cover, Moreno has often used the word "alternative" to categorize his music. "I consider myself part of the Latin alternative music movement" he told Hispanic Magazine.
In late March 2005, Moreno's released his second CD was "EL SEGUNDO", with the song "Avión" expected to rule the airwaves but was lost with the new reggaeton fad.. In the meantime, he had live performances all across Universities in the U.S. and started to build a grass roots fan base. Soon after he recorded the title track for the Havana Nights Sound track with Santana.
In 2008, Moreno performed as Special Music Guest along with Usher in the Victoria Secret Fashion Show, reportedly seen by hundreds of millions of views worldwide.
Later that year he started another business venture Beach Pictures, (www.BeachPictures.tv) a Miami based television, film and web production company represented by William Morris Endeavor.
Most recently, Moreno is taking music at his own pace and is releasing a string of singles. The first being "Thank You" released late 2010 from Forward Motion Records on iTunes and won the prestigious International Songwriters Contest "ISC" award for "Best Video" and placed as a semi finalist for "Best Song".
His second single "This Town" is an Orbison -esc indie track and was recently released on iTunes. 
He is reportedly releasing a Spanish version of the song "Pray for you" made famous by Jaron and The Long road to love. Stay tuned for more.

King of the Pygmies

King of the Pygmies is a young adult novel that lies on the line between magic and mental illness. It is the sixth novel written by American author Jonathon Scott Fuqua, originally published in 2005 by Candlewick Press. It is about a 15-year-old boy, Penrod "Penn" Swayne, and the troubles that he faces when he starts hearing the thoughts of people close to him.
Plot summary.
Penn is an average American high school boy living in the small town of Havre de Grace, Maryland. He has a crush on the new girl at school, Daisy. He looks out for his older brother, Matt, who has had brain damage from birth. Penn is on his way to a successful life.
All of this changes when he starts hearing voices.
He learns of the worries that his brother does not voice out loud, the depression that his neighbor is fighting, and the quiet struggles that his parents face each day.
After Penn shares the details of being able to hear people's thoughts, his mother forces him to see a psychiatrist as she suspects that he suffers from schizophrenia. He desperately tries to show his father that he is not insane and takes him to see his Uncle Hewitt, who had convinced Penn that he too could read people's minds. Unfortunately, his uncle could not correctly guess the thoughts of Penn's father, and both Penn and Hewitt are left looking as if they are not mentally stable.
Penn is let down by his uncle again after he promised that a man would come and see him and explain the Pygmy disease, which causes the ability to hear the thoughts of other people. The man does not show up, leaving Penn unsure whether his Uncle can truly hear the thoughts of other people, and even creates doubts concerning Penn's mental state and whether he is magic or mentally unstable.
Cover.
The cover shows the ocean and shoreline of the coast described in the novel. "King of the Pygmies" mentions that you can see what the weather will be like hours before it hits due to the huge expanse of uninterrupted skyline.
Reviews.
""King of the Pygmies" doesn't settle easily on the side of magic or of medicine, suggesting instead that the world may be more complicated, more terrible and beautiful and unnerving than we could ever believe. . . . High and true art."
""King of the Pygmies" is worth reading and discussing, as it is one of too-few teen novels that deal compassionately� with mental illness"
"This is an amazing book for several reasons...The desperation and confusion, but also the ordinariness of a teenager is eloquently portrayed, as is the redemptive power of love...this is a well-written novel with special appeal for teenagers."
"Fuqua has written a persuasive and engaging story."

Bloodhounds of Broadway is a 1989 film based on four Damon Runyon stories. It was directed by Howard Brookner and starred Matt Dillon, Jennifer Grey, Anita Morris, Julie Hagerty, Rutger Hauer, Madonna, Esai Morales and Randy Quaid.
Madonna and Jennifer Grey perform a duet, "I Surrender Dear", during the film. Madonna earned a Golden Raspberry Award nomination for Worst Supporting Actress for her performance in the film.
"Bloodhounds of Broadway" was Brookner's first feature-length film (and his last, as he died shortly before the film opened). The film was recut by the studio and Walter Winchellesque narration added.
Plot.
Broadway, New Year's Eve, 1928. A muckraking reporter, Waldo Winchester, frames four major stories during the wild New Year's Eve of 1928.
We meet the players in a diner. The Brain, a gangster with multiple girlfriends, is accompanied by a gambler named Regret (after the only horse he even won a bet on) and an outsider who (with his bloodhounds) is being treated to a meal. Feet Samuels (so named because of his big feet) is in love with a showgirl named Hortense Hathaway, who is tossed out of the diner because of an unsavory reputation). Feet plans to have one wild night before committing suicide, having sold his body in advance to a medical doctor.
Harriet MacKyle, a sheltered but friendly socialite, makes arrangements with a smooth-talking fixer for a big party that night at her estate, where many of the players will later attend. She has an interest in the exciting but dangerous criminal element. A girl selling flowers comes in after Feet makes a full payment of a debt to the Brain, so the Brain offers $5 for a 25-cent flower, telling her to keep the change. But before he can leave, a hitman for the Brooklyn Mob stabs him. The wounded Brain tells his men to take him "home." Unfortunately, his many girlfriends refuse to allow him in for various reasons.
Feet gets involved in a high-stakes craps game. With considerable luck, he wins a massive payoff of money and jewelry. Regret suggests they find another game, but Feet reveals his plan to kill himself. Regret tries to talk him out of it, but Feet, sworn to see his last promise fulfilled, is adamant. Regret dials up the reporter, who is now at MacKyle's party, and asks him to talk to Hortense (his niece) and get her to realize Feet is smitten with her.
Hortense must try to persuade Feet that she wants to quit her life as a lounge singer, move to New Jersey and raise a family. Regret, meanwhile, continues to be the world's unluckiest gambler, but showgirl Lovey Lou is in love with him anyway.
Production.
Filming of the movie began in December 1987. It filmed in three cities in New Jersey: Union City, Newark and Jersey City.

<doc id="18456087" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18456087" title="Tapatan">
Tapatan

Tapatan is a two-player abstract strategy game from the Philippines. It is related to tic-tac-toe, but even more related to Three Men's Morris, Nine Holes, Achi, Tant Fant, Shisima, and Dara, because pieces are moved on the board to create the 3 in-a-row. It is an alignment game. 
Tapatan is identical to the 3 piece version of Achi. 
Goal.
To create a 3 in-a-row of one's pieces either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
Equipment.
A 3 x 3 board is used. Three horizontal lines form the three rows. Three vertical lines form the three columns. Two diagonal lines connect the two opposite corners of the board. Each player has 3 pieces. One plays the black pieces, and the other plays the white pieces, however, any two colors or distinguishable objects will suffice.
The board is easily drawn on the ground or paper.
Rules and Game Play.
1. The board is empty in the beginning. 
2. Players decide what colors to play, and who will start first. 
3. Drop phase: Each player drops one piece per turn on any vacant space on the board. Players alternate their turns. Pieces cannot move until all three pieces have been dropped.
4. Move phase: After each player's three pieces have been dropped on the board, each piece can move one space at a time following the pattern on the board. Only one piece can be moved per turn.
5. Players can create the 3 in-a-row at either the drop phase or move phase, and win the game.
6. HOUSE RULES: These are rules that you and the other player can agree upon. They are not standard for the game. 
a) A stalemate where one player cannot make a move is cause for a draw of the game, or a loss to that player. 
b) Repeating a position three times can be cause for a draw.
Analysis.
Analysis has shown that the first player wins with perfect play.
There are 1,680 ways for each player to drop each of their 3 pieces on the board. It is truly a complex game.

Baynes Lake consists of approximately 160 residences with a number of those belonging to seasonal residents. The village of Baynes Lake includes a community hall, an Anglican church, the Baynes Lake Volunteer Fire Hall, the Baynes Lake General Store, and a community park.
History.
The community of Baynes Lake began along the shores of Baynes Lake in 1896. The main attraction for settlers was the opportunity for employment by the Adolph Lumber Company which established a mill site along the eastern shore around 1907. A Baynes Lake station with the Great Northern Railway existed from 1904 to 1937. With the closing of the mill, the population quickly dwindled and workers moved to find employment elsewhere. Many of the remaining residents were farmers or worked in the new portable mills of the area. With flooding of Kootenay River valley to accommodate the Libby Dam in Montana, several families who had been displaced by the rising waters were relocated to small building lots in Baynes Lake.
Local media.
"The Baynes Lake News" is a community newsletter which is published monthly by the Baynes Lake Community Society.

Mourlot Studios

Mourlot Studios was a commercial print shop founded in 1852 by the Mourlot family and located in Paris, France. It was also known as Imprimerie Mourlot, Mourlot Freres and Atelier Mourlot. Founded by Francois Mourlot, it started off producing wallpaper. Later, his son Jules Mourlot would expand the business to handle the production of chocolate labels for companies such as Chocolat Poulain, as well as ledgers, maps and stationary.
Starting in the 1920s, Jules' son, Fernand Mourlot, converted one of the locations into a studio dedicated to printing fine art lithography.
History.
One of the most important contribution of the Mourlot Studio was to be the art poster. For the Eugène Delacroix exhibition in 1930, the Daumier exhibition and the Manet exhibition at the French National Museums, Mourlot became the place where posters were prepared and produced as works of art in their own right. 
Another important feature would be the production of fine art, limited edition lithographs. The first painters to create lithographs at Mourlot were Vlaminck and Utrillo. But, lithography, which had enjoyed much popularity in the 19th century, had been abandoned by most artists in the first part of the 20th century.
Lithography, which was invented by Aloys Senefelder at the end of the 18th century, reached fame when it was adopted by artists such as Jules Chéret, Toulouse-Lautrec, Bonnard and Vuillard in the 1880s. Beginning in the 1930s, Fernand Mourlot was inviting a new generation of artists to work directly on the stone, as one does when creating a poster. 
In 1937 the studio created two posters, one by Bonnard and one by Henri Matisse, for the Maitres de l'Art indépendant exhibition at the Petit Palais. Both were found to be of such excellent quality by the artists themselves that they established Mourlot as the leading lithographic printers. In 1937 the studio also began a long collaboration with the editor Tériade, who founded the legendary art review Verve. After the Second World War, Mourlot assisted Matisse, Braque, Bonnard, Rouault and Joan Miró in the creation of important lithographs for the review.
In 1945, Pablo Picasso elected the Mourlot studio for his return to the lithographic medium. Set up in a corner of the shop, it would soon become his home for several months at a time. Between 1945 and 1969, Picasso created over four hundred lithographs at Mourlot. This collaboration would break new ground in the lithographic process and lend a new dimension to Picasso's work.

Peter Cortlandt

Peter "Pete" William Cortlandt is a fictional character from the ABC and The Online Network serial drama "All My Children". The role is currently portrayed by Robert Scott Wilson, who joined the series as part of the online reboot on April 29, 2013.
Casting.
In 1997, Jack McKillop was cast as Peter, and remained with the series until 1999. At that point, the role was recast with Casey Gunther, who remained with the series until 2002. From 2002 to 2003, the role was portrayed by Mitchel David Federan.
On July 11, 2008, Daniel Kennedy joined the cast of "All My Children" on a recurring basis as Peter. Kennedy remained with the series until October 30, 2009. Kennedy cited then head-writer Charles Pratt, Jr.'s disinterest with character development as the reason for his termination.
In February 2013, it was announced that the role of Peter had been recast with model Robert Scott Wilson, as part of online development company Prospect Park's intended reboot of the series. Wilson made his debut on the reboot's premiere episode on April 29, 2013.
Storylines.
1992–2003.
Born to Palmer and Opal Cortlandt on Christmas Eve 1992, Peter's conception and birth were surrounded in controversy. Opal, who had thought that she was going through menopause, was stunned to discover that she was pregnant. As well, Palmer had thought her pregnancy came about through an extramarital affair, as he had long been convinced that he was sterile following a horse riding accident many years earlier. A DNA test eventually resolved the issue of Peter's paternity.
Over the years, Peter proved to be troublesome for his myriad of nannies, one of whom was Kendall Hart. Eventually, Peter was sent away to boarding school.
2008–09.
In July 2008, Peter returned to Pine Valley, and began to reconnect with childhood friend Colby Chandler, with whom he soon realized he was falling in love. However, Colby failed to reciprocate those feelings. Peter was eventually dragged into a deal with Palmer's long-time enemy, Adam Chandler, to taint Fusion Cosmetics' new perfume, Bella, with a chemical that would subject its users to an allergic reaction. Adam hoped that the resulting negative publicity would make Fusion more vulnerable to a hostile takeover. Despite his best efforts, Peter's relationship with Colby never blossomed into anything more, and by late 2009, he had moved to Switzerland, where he had allegedly become enamored with a "snow bunny".
2013–.
In April 2013, Peter returns to Pine Valley for a visit with Opal, who wants him to resurrect the floundering Cortlandt Electronics from complete ruin. Peter, who had dropped out of Stanford to launch his own company, CortApps, is reluctant to remain in Pine Valley longterm, but changes his mind following a chance encounter with Celia Fitzgerald.
Reception.
Wilson's performance has received praise from critics. Omar White-Nobles of TVSource Magazine referred to Pete and Celia's relationship as a high point for the series, noting "Jordan Lane Price and Rob Wilson have good, natural chemistry. I could see them turning into something big."

15 cm Schiffskanone C/28 in Mörserlafette

The 15 cm Schiffskanone C/28 in Mörserlafette (SK C/28 in Mrs Laf) was a German heavy gun used in the Second World War. Production of carriages for the 21 cm Mörser 18 and the 17 cm Kanone 18 in Mörserlafette exceeded available barrels in 1941 and eight naval 15 cm SK C/28 coast defense gun barrels were adapted for use on the carriages. They were converted to "Heer"-standard percussion firing. See the articles of those guns for details on the design of the carriage. For Operation Barbarossa (the invasion of the Soviet Union), it equipped "Artillerie-Abteilung 625". Most guns were replaced by 17 cm barrels as they became available. However for Case Blue (the German summer offensive in southern Russia), one battery of "Artillery Battalion (Artillerie-Abteilung) 767" was still equipped with them. That same battery retained them through the beginning of the Battle of Kursk in July 1943.
Ammunition.
The "15 cm SK C/28 in Mrs Laf" could not be converted to use the Heer's standard 15 cm ammunition and had to use naval ammunition. These included the "15 cm Sprgr L/4.6 KZ m. Hb.", the "15cm Sprgr L/4.5 BdZ m. Hb." and the "15 cm Pzgr L/3.8 m. Hb". The former was a nose-fuzed HE shell with a ballistic cap. The second was a base-fuzed E shell, also with a ballistic cap. The last-named was a standard armor-piercing shell. Only one bag of propellant was used in a separate-loading cartridge case.

Persuasion (1971 series)

Persuasion is a 1971 British television serial adaptation of the Jane Austen novel of the same name. It was produced by Granada Television for ITV and was directed by Howard Baker. The series stars Ann Firbank as Anne Elliott and Bryan Marshall as Captain Wentworth. It was originally aired in April and May 1971 in five episodes.
Synopsis.
Anne Elliot is the second daughter of the widowed baronet Sir Walter Elliot, who unlike her vain father and sisters, is humble, sensible and modest. The family discuss their fall into financial difficulty, largely because of Sir Walter's wayward spending. Several ideas are suggested, but either Sir Walter or his eldest daughter Elizabeth (who is very like her father), refuse them, as they cast some taint on the family name. Finally Sir Walter's friend and soliticitor Mr. Shepherd, at the urging of Anne and Lady Russell, persuade Sir Walter to let out his ancestral home, Kellynch Hall, and move to Bath, where he can say he is taking in the waters for his health. Mr. Shepherd strongly urges this because, with the return of the fleet due to what appears to be the end of the Napoleonic Wars, there will be a demand for fine housing by newly rich naval officers. Shortly thereafter, Mr Shepherd finds a suitable tenant in Admiral Croft and his wife Mrs. Croft, the sister of Captain Wentworth—whom, it seems, is already known to Anne and her family.
Captain Wentworth was engaged previously to Anne Elliott, eight and half years earlier, and we learn that Lady Russell, Anne's guardian, persuaded Anne not to go through with the marriage because of his then-lack of a fortune or good family. Since then, however, Wentworth went to sea and made his fortune, and now is returning to Somerset to find a bride. 
Sir Walter and Elizabeth leave Kellynch Hall for Bath, but Anne goes to visit her other sister, Mary Musgrove, who is married to Mr Charles Musgrove. Charles was also a suitor of Anne's seven or so years ago, but Anne refused him, and so he turned his affections to the younger and self-centered Mary. Since then, Musgrove and Mary have had two little boys that Mary has alternatively ignored and spoilt immoderately. While staying with the Musgroves, Wentworth comes to visit. Anne and Wentworth barely speak to one another, and Wentworth takes up what appears to be an affection for Charles Musgrove's two young sisters, Louisa and Henrietta. The attraction to Henrietta fades as she renews her vows to the young vicar in the area, so things start to look more and more like Louisa Musgrove has won Wentworth's attention. Soon everyone is taking about the pair; but nothing has been settled. Wentworth mentions that he has to go to Lyme, a seaport town, to visit his friends, Mr and Mrs Harville, and Louisa hits upon the idea of the whole party of six going as well to visit Lyme as a daytrip.
It is during a trip to Lyme, that Louisa, showing off, jumps off a wall, hoping to be caught by Wentworth, but instead strikes her head against the pavement and 
falls unconscious. Anne takes charge of the situation while everyone else is too distressed to think properly. The doctor is very foreboding about Louisa's prospects. As they are in a stranger's house, Louisa's brother says that he will stay and take care of things that are needed; but after further discussion it is decided that Anne will stay to be Louisa's nurse. But then her sister Mary, very jealous of being thought second-best in ability to care for Louisa, insists that she shall be the nurse, and so, no longer needed, Anne leaves Lyme, first to return to the Musgrove's, and then to join her father and Elizabeth in Bath.
At Bath news comes that Louisa has recovered and is no longer interested in Wentworth but found another suitor. This makes Anne hopeful of reconciliation with Wentworth, and she makes every effort to approach him. But now her own cousin, Mr. Elliot, begins to show interest in her, which is highly approved by not only Lady Russell, Anne's champion, but also by sister Elizabeth and Sir Walter. 
Things seem a jumble when Anne meets Wentworth's friend, Captain Harville, this time at the hotel in Bath where the Musgroves have come to get ready for Henrietta's and Louisa's nuptials. Anne and Harville engage in a deeply felt exchange about whether men, or women, are more fickle or more constant in their affections. Captain Wentworth overhears their conversation and is struck by it. He proposes to Anne in a letter which he leaves for her in the hotel. The series ends at a party to congratulate the couple, at which it is discovered that the deceitful cousin Mr. Elliot, and Elizabeth's apparently steady, but in reality also deceitful, friend, Mrs. Clay, secretly have gone off together.

Cordylanthus rigidus

Cordylanthus rigidus is a species of flowering plant in the broomrape family known by the common name stiffbranch bird's beak. 
It is native to California and northern Baja California, where it grows in many types of habitat from coastal flats to high inland mountains. This is a hairy annual herb growing to maximum heights anywhere from 30 centimeters to 1.5 meters. There are at least four subspecies and possibly natural varieties not distinct enough to be considered subspecies. There is great variety in the appearance of the plant. The stem and foliage vary in color from greenish to yellows and reds; like other members of its family this species is a parasite on other plants so it does not rely entirely on green chlorophyll to produce its own nutrients. Its leaves are linear in shape and 1 to 4 centimeters long. The edges may roll in. The loose inflorescence produces solitary flowers on long stalks. Each hair-covered flower is shaped like a conical bird's beak with leaflike, pointed outer and inner bracts. Tucked inside is the pouched white flower. The whole unit is up to 2 centimeters long. The fruit is a capsule containing dark brown seeds one or two millimeters long.

Little Brothers of Francis

The 19th and 20th century has seen the creation of a number of religious orders in the Anglican Church. One late addition to Anglican religious life is the Little Brothers of Francis, a contemplative order of Franciscan friars within the Anglican Church of Australia. The community was founded by three former members of the Society of St Francis in 1987: Brothers Geoffrey Adam, Wayne and Howard. Their vision is to develop a prayer-centred life in a rural setting. Although not entirely self-sufficient, the Brothers have built their own buildings of stone and timber. They have a substantial vegetable garden and orchard and also breed sheep, goats and rabbits. They publish a newsletter twice a year - the "Bush Telegraph".
The Rule of the Brothers is based on the "Rule of St. Francis for Hermitages".

The Booze Hangs High released in 1930, is the fourth title in the "Looney Tunes" series and features Bosko, Warner Bros.' first cartoon character.
Plot.
The scene opens with a close up shot of a cow's rear end. She moos as she walks away, tail and udders swaying in tune to "Turkey in the Straw". Bosko appears and does a Mexican style dance with the cow. At one point, the cow's "pants" drop, revealing polka-dotted underwear. Bosko points and laughs, at which the cow pulls her pants back on and walks off in a huff—with her nose up and tail held erect.
Next, Bosko laughs heartily at a horse and the horse laughs back. He then climbs onto the horse carriage and uses a whip to play the horse's tail like a violin. He tunes the "horse" by twisting his ear. The horse seems to enjoy the music and dances in an odd fashion. He skates along, floats a few feet above the ground and makes swishing movements, with his hoofs, as if mimicking a mop. Bosko then takes a rake and starts playing it like a fiddle, as the horse begins trotting on two legs.
The scene cuts to three ducklings and their mother. Whilst walking in single file, they start bouncing on their rears in tune to the music. The mother duck starts to sway and the ducklings follow her lead. One of the ducklings, crosses its legs and whispers something in the mother duck's ear. She undoes a flap on his rear, as if he was wearing pants, and motions him off screen, presumably to relieve himself. When he returns, she replaces the flap and they all jump into a pond.
The scene moves back to Bosko and the horse. It seems to be an exact repeat of the earlier dance routine, with Bosko playing the horse's tail while the horse goes through his unique dance moves. Bosko eventually slides down the horse's neck and goes to feed the pigs, who seem to be squealing in hunger. He tilts a trash can into their trough, and they eat greedily. One of the piglets finds a bottle of booze and tries to loosen the cork. Eventually, he manages to open it using the other piglet's tail as a corkscrew. Bubbles begin to float out, and the piglets pop them merrily, making xylophone-like sounds that play "How dry I am". They soon get drunk. Their father comes over and starts drinking from the bottle too. He laughs with a deep bass guffaw and sings "One Little Drink", using nonsense syllables. He gestures expressively and flings the bottle away which shatters against Bosko's head.
Bosko becomes soaked in booze and inebriated. He walks over to the pigs and they sing "Sweet Adeline" together, barbershop style. The father pig launches into "One Little Drink" again, but the effort causes him to belch up a corn cob. Looking embarrassed, he uses his belly button like a knob to open the door to his stomach and puts the cob back inside. He starts to sing again and Bosko helps him reach for the final low note by pulling his tail, which deflates him temporarily.
Bosko and the pigs dance some more until the end credits.

Lipetz House

Raphael Soriano’s first residential commission arose from his knowledge and passion for both language and music. The main feature of the house was to be a music room with excellent acoustic properties that could accommodate Mrs. Lipetz’s Bechstein Grand piano and up to twenty guests. Soriano designed the north end of this x room as a semi circle with continuous windows, creating a real-life backdrop of the vast San Gabriel Mountain Range, for Mrs. Lipetz’s performances. The site itself is on the pinnacle of a hill overlooking Silver Lake. Several hundred music albums were accommodated in shelves placed under built-in seating areas, and much of the other furniture in the house was also built-in. The music room comprised nearly one third of the total area of the two-bedroom house. The design is in the International Style, built with traditional wood stud construction, similar to Richard Neutra’s frame, but with one innovate technological detail - steel beams supported the ground floor. The building was chosen as one of four U.S.A. buildings for the 1937 International Architecture Exhibition in Paris, and with it Soriano won the prestigious Prix de Rome. The house is in good condition with slight alterations.

The Storm Warriors

The Storm Warriors () is a 2009 Hong Kong film produced and directed by the Pang brothers. It is the second live-action film adaptation of artist Ma Wing-shing's manhua series "Fung Wan", following the 1998 film "The Storm Riders". "The Storm Warriors" is based on "Fung Wan"s "Japanese Invasion" story arc "The Death Battle". Ekin Cheng and Aaron Kwok respectively reprise their roles as Wind and Cloud, who this time find themselves up against Lord Godless (Simon Yam), a ruthless Japanese warlord bent on invading China. The film is a co-production between Universe Entertainment and Sil-Metropole Organisation.
A sequel to "The Storm Riders" was first announced in March 2008 after Universe gained rights to the "Fung Wan" franchise from former film distributor Golden Harvest. The Pangs aimed on creating a big-budgeted film involving visual effects and stated that "The Storm Warriors" would not be a direct sequel to its 1998 predecessor. Principal photography for "The Storm Warriors" began in April 2008 and ended in July; filming took place in three studios located in Bangkok, Thailand. The film is notable for being the first Chinese language film shot in bluescreen. During post-production, effects artists worked on scenes involving computer-generated imagery, focusing on the film's setting and backgrounds.
"The Storm Warriors" was released theatrically in Hong Kong on 10 December 2009.
Synopsis.
The evil Japanese warlord Lord Godless desires to conquer China. He threatens the General in command into surrender, takes the emperor captive and subdues a large number of martial arts masters using his special poison. Among the captives are Cloud who surrendered out of concern for Chu Chu, and the martial arts legend Nameless. Lord Godless gives them two choices, they can either surrender and work under him, or they will be executed. None of the masters accept the offer. Nameless then breaks free of his chains, revealing that Ghostly Tiger, Nameless' assistant sneaked in earlier to give all the masters the antidote to the poison. Cloud and Wind land direct blows on Lord Godless with no noticeable effect, and even though several other martial arts masters combine their powers to attack Lord Godless, they lose the contest of strength and are killed. Nameless uses his special attack on Lord Godless, using his chi to launch all the captured masters' swords at Lord Godless, Lord Godless takes the attack head on and blocks all the swords while Nameless suffers serious internal injuries because he overtaxed himself while not fully recovered from the poison. Some other martial artists raid the prison on horseback and Nameless, Cloud, Wind and Chu Chu manage to escape, while Lord Godless sends his son, Heartless and two lieutenants, Earth and Sky, after Nameless with an army, with orders to destroy any martial arts schools along the way who will not surrender.
Nameless is badly injured and will not be able to recover his full strength to fight with Lord Godless for a significant period of time, so he sends Cloud and Wind to find Piggy King's elder brother, Lord Wicked, who is the only person who can fight Lord Godless now. They go to the mountain where he has hid himself from the outside world but are unsuccessful in persuading him to help, until Wind's lover Second Dream shows up and aids in persuading Lord Wicked. Lord Wicked comes out of his cave, revealing that he had chopped off his own arms years ago. This was his attempt to stop killing innocent people because he had lost control of himself in his younger days while practicing evil kung-fu. He kicks some pebbles at Cloud and Wind to test how they react, Cloud crushes the pebbles totally while Wind only catches them intact. Lord Wicked states that Cloud is too aggressive and will not be able to handle training in the evil way, while Wind has more control and might be able to return to normal. Lord Wicked then starts training Wind in evil arts while Cloud is summoned to meet Nameless at Lin Yi Temple.
At Lin Yi Temple, Cloud fights a disguised Nameless, who states that Cloud has massive potential, able to accurately learn his styles in a short period of time, and trains him, eventually creating a new sword style which Nameless names "Ba", inventing a new character partially resembling the characters "Cloud" and "Sword". Lord Godless discovers where Nameless, Wind and Cloud have been hiding and dispatches Earth and Sky to kill Nameless while sending a few warriors after Wind. At the temple, Cloud easily defeats Earth and Sky in a single blow, but as Lord Wicked and the others are fighting off the warriors that Lord Godless sent, Second Dream gets injured and Wind interrupts his training to come out of the cave and save her, killing the warriors in the process. Afterward he leaves with his training unfinished, despite it supposedly not being possible to leave the pool yet. Cloud arrives to find Wind gone, and Lord Wicked sends Cloud after Lord Godless as he is trying to find the Dragon Tomb which contains a secret that deals with the destiny of China.
Lord Godless meanwhile has taken the Emperor and his family as hostages and is searching for the Dragon Tomb. The Emperor refuses to help him, but Heartless is able to find out which path into the tomb is the correct one through the use of his chi that generated a massive wind when he picked the correct passage. Once at the end of the path, Heartless starts threatening the Emperor for more information on the Dragon Tomb, but as he refuses to speak, Heartless starts killing his wives and sons. Cloud arrives, and the guards which were Imperial Guards that were forced to surrender, switch sides instantly and pull the Emperor out of harm's way. Cloud and Heartless exchanges blows, Heartless backs off after the first exchange, and Cloud and Lord Godless starts fighting, Cloud initially has the upper hand but is unable to injure Lord Godless due to his near invincible armor. In the fight, a pile of rocks is blown away, revealing the entrance to the real Dragon Tomb, which contains a human skeleton sitting upright. Lord Godless almost kills Cloud in the next exchange of blows, but Wind, who has been thoroughly possessed by the evil arts, arrives and fights against first Lord Godless, then Cloud, and then both of them, eventually killing Lord Godless by cutting off his arm from the underside of his armor, which was not as well protected and stealing the Dragon Bone, the secret of the tomb.
As Cloud chases after Wind, the Emperor begs Cloud to retrieve the Dragon Bone as it is crucial to the destiny of China. Second Dream eventually finds Wind at the secret place she had written to him in a letter about, but Wind just sits there with minimal response, and eventually the Emperor's guards arrive to try and take the Dragon Bone back. However as the General struggles with Second Dream over the dragon bone, Heartless, which had escaped from the previous battle, grabs the bone and heavily injures the General, as the General and Heartless struggle for the bone, it breaks into two and Wind gets fully taken over by the evil spirit again. Cloud arrives and fights Wind to try and bring him back, but fails as Wind eventually wounds Second Dream and also kills Chu Chu. In a final gambit, Cloud hurls his sword at Wind, cutting him on the forehead and Wind miraculously regains control. The cliff side has taken serious damage in the battle however, and a large section collapses, causing Wind and Second Dream (who walks over to check on her beloved) to fall off the cliff. Cloud is not in the section of the cliff that collapses. However, Cloud jumps off the cliff as well, manages to fall faster than the Wind and Second Dream, and exerts a force to push Wind and Second Dream back to safety. In doing so, Cloud plummets into the depths, but there is no scene of him dying. Sitting safely on the stable part of the cliff, Wind laments about why Cloud did not kill him earlier when Cloud had the chance. The movie ends abruptly at this stage.
Production.
"The Storm Warriors" is based on artist Ma Wing-shing's manhua "Fung Wan", a comic book series created in 1984. The film was directed by Oxide Pang and his brother, Danny Pang, who served as a co-editor on the 1998 film "The Storm Riders". The film was produced as part of the Pangs' ten-year motion picture deal with Universe Entertainment. A sequel to the 1998 film was first announced in March 2008. Film distributor Universe Entertainment gained rights to produce the film from Golden Harvest after the latter company's ten-year production rights to the "Fung Wan" franchise expired.
The film is based on "Fung Wan"'s "Japanese Invasion" story arc "The Death Battle", which follows Wind and Cloud as they fight against a Japanese warlord. The Pangs have stated that "The Storm Warriors" is not a direct sequel to "The Storm Riders", but more of a stand-alone film with a separate storyline.
It was announced in April 2008 that the Pangs had changed the film's English title from "The Storm Riders II" to "The Storm Warriors" in order to avoid copyright conflicts. The name change was made to head off any potential copyright disputes with the comic's current license holder who is no longer associated with the film's financiers.
Casting.
Ma Wing-shing was very concerned about the film's casting. He was especially adamant of Ekin Cheng and Aaron Kwok reprising their respective roles. Ma also dismissed that the actors might be too old for the film. He commented on the actors and their roles: "My concept of Cloud was someone with a tortured soul, and Aaron resembles the actual comic Cloud more today than he did 11 years ago. He is less baby-faced, and looks more mature and manly now...As for Ekin, he was more carefree in the first movie, but it will be more challenging for him this time around because he has to turn evil."
Filming.
Ekin Cheng and Aaron Kwok, along with the Pang brothers, executive producer Daniel Lam and the film's crew celebrated production of the film with a traditional Thai blessing ceremony. Filming for "The Storm Warriors" began in April 2008 and ended in July 2008. Principal photography for the film took place entirely in three studios occupying in Bangkok's Pak-Gret district. Filming consisted mainly of a Thai production crew, as the Pangs decided to shoot the film in Thailand, rather than in their native Hong Kong: "We wanted to shoot the whole film...because we trust them, and because it's probably cheaper than shooting in Hong Kong, even though we have to fly in some of the props and costumes." Members of the media and the film's distributors across Asia were invited to visit the shooting location. They also invited to view a fight scene between leading actors Ekin Cheng and Aaron Kwok as it was being filmed.
Design and effects.
Visual effects for the film was produced by Fat Face Productions, which has been a leader in digital effects work for the Asian region with past credits that include "The Warlords", and "Kung Fu Hustle". "The Storm Warriors" is notable for being the first Chinese language film to be shot in bluescreen. The Pangs intended on giving their film a similar look and feel to that of the 2007 American film "300". The Pangs decided not to shoot the film entirely in bluescreen, as it would have gone over budgets and ruined the look of the film. Oxide Pang commented on the film's look: "We decided to make it more realistic-looking, and less like a comic book, but you will instantly know that it is a movie made out of a comic book just by looking at the background." During post-production, more than 1000 CGI shots involving the film's settings and background were created for the film.
Release.
"The Storm Warriors" was released theatrically in Hong Kong and Australia on 10 December 2009.
Marketing.
Ma Wing-Shing created a hand-drawn poster for "The Storm Warriors" for the Hong Kong Animation and Comic Book Convention in July 2009. Universe Entertainment later created a live-action version of Ma's poster. A theatrical trailer for the film premiered on its the film's official website and in cinemas on 17 June 2009. The film's official website was launched in Beijing on 3 August 2009.

Diocese of Rome

The Diocese of Rome (, ) is a diocese of the Catholic Church in Rome, Italy. Its bishop is known as the Pope, and is the Supreme Pontiff and leader of the Catholic Church. Established in the 1st century, the current Bishop of Rome is from 13 March 2013.
Bishop.
The bishop of the Diocese of Rome has, in the first place, the title of "Bishop of Rome", the basis for all his other titles. Those officially listed for him in the "Annuario Pontificio" are:
The best-known title, that of "Pope", does not appear in the official list, but is commonly used in the titles of documents, and appears, in abbreviated form, in their signatures.
Origins.
The best evidence available for the origins of the Church in Rome is Saint Paul's Epistle to the Romans. This indicates that the church was established probably by the early 40s. Saint Peter became associated with this church sometime between the year 58 and the early 60s.
Says one source:
Diocese.
The territory of the diocese includes Vatican City State and the city of Rome, capital of the Italian Republic, with distinct vicars general for the two parts:
Unless the bishop of a diocese reserves some acts to himself, vicars general have within a diocese the power to place all administrative acts that belong to the bishop except those that in law require a special mandate of the bishop.
The diocese covers a territory of 881 square kilometers The website of the Vicariate of Rome lists 335 active and 5 suppressed parishes in its territory In addition there are two parishes in Vatican City. The diocese of Rome has 1,219 diocesan priests of its own, while 2,331 priests of other dioceses, 5,072 religious priests and 140 Opus Dei priests reside in its territory, as do 2,266 women religious. In 2004, they pastored an estimated 2,454,000 faithful, who made up 88% of the population of the territory.
The city of Rome has grown beyond the boundaries of the diocese. Notable parts of the city belong to the dioceses of Ostia and Porto-Santa Rufina. Ostia is administered together with the Vicariate of the City and thus included in the statistics given above, while Porto is instead administered by its own residential bishop.
Suburbicarian sees.
Six of the dioceses of the Roman Province are described as suburbicarian. Each suburbicarian diocese has a Cardinal Bishop at its head.
Diocese of Ostia.
There remains the titular Suburicarian See of Ostia, held, in addition to his previous suburbicarian see, by the Cardinal Bishop elected to be the Dean of the College of Cardinals. The Diocese of Ostia was merged with the Diocese of Rome in 1962, and is now administered by a Vicar General, in tight cooperation with the Vicar General for Rome. It was also diminished to contain only the cathedral parish of Ostia (Sant'Aurea in Ostia Antica), which, however, in 2012 was divided into two parishes, who together form the present diocese of Ostia.
Suffragan sees.
Other dioceses that have Rome as their metropolitan see:

Dewartown

Dewartown is a small hamlet in Midlothian, Scotland, UK, near Pathhead and Mayfield.
Its name relates to the Dewar family who owned the nearby Vogrie House and Estate which is now in Vogrie Country Park. The village is reputed to have had five public houses during the 19th century, providing for the many farm workers, miners and house staff from the local community. 
Dewartown is still not listed on many maps, despite the fact a number of the cottages date back to the early 18th century.
Signs erected in the late 1990s depicted the village as 'Dewarton', rather than 'Dewartown'. These were replaced with the latter spelling, despite the fact both spellings are competent, the former being a regional contraction, vis 'ton' meaning 'town'.

Fire Station No. 23 (Los Angeles, California)

Fire Station No. 23 is a former fire station in Downtown Los Angeles. Built in 1910 as an operating fire station, it was also the Los Angeles Fire Department's headquarters until 1920 and the residence of every fire chief from 1910-1928. When it opened, it spawned a political firestorm due to the ornate interior and expensive imported materials, leading to its being called the "Taj Mahal" of firehouses. After 50 years of operation, the station was closed in 1960 as the department began replacing older stations with new facilities. Since the 1980s, Fire Station No. 23 has been a popular filming location. Motion pictures filmed at the station include the "Ghostbusters" movies, "The Mask", "Police Academy 2", "Flatliners", "Firehouse" and "National Security".
History.
Construction controversy.
In June 1909, the city of Los Angeles announced plans to build a three-story fire station in the heart of the wholesale and manufacturing district that would also serve as the fire department's headquarters. The projected cost of the station was placed at $35,000.
When the station opened in September 1910 at a final cost of $53,000, a controversy arose over the cost and use of expensive materials, including Peruvian mahogany in the chief's living quarters. It was considered the "most elaborate and richest engine-house west of New York" and maybe the "most ornate ... in this or any other world." The "Los Angeles Times" reported on its opulence as follows:"It is the interior which is to reincarnate man and beast in the fire department. It is the interior which is a sort of Nirvana for a soulful legion of blue-shirted civil service graduates. Its spell will be hypnotic, for if the visitor starts in with the third floor he will leave by Winston Street in stupefaction."
The building was an unusually narrow structure, only wide but deep stretching the entire distance from Fifth to Winston Streets. The main floor was an arcade connecting Fifth and Winston Streets with stalls for ten horses, repressed vitrified brick, walls of white enamel tiling, and pressed steel ceilings above the floor. More than anything else, it was the extravagant third floor living quarters, described as "the chief's boudoir" and a "palace for chiefs," that drew the most attention. Access to the third floor was by a private elevator that "moves noiselessly and stealthily to the upper haven." The third floor was covered in Peruvian mahogany with French bevel glass mirrors, a mantel of Vermont marble, polished inlaid oak floors, a private slide pole, a massive brass bed, private roof garden, and "a tub big enough for two chiefs." The "Times" reported: "Notice the Peruvian mahogany carefully, and you will see that the heart of the log has been chosen and that its grain has been placed so that it gives the appearance of real flames. Certainly the esthetic for the reception room of the engine-house de luxe." The chief's apartment alone was reported to have cost $25,000. The "Times" noted that the quarters rivaled the finest suites in the country, referred to it as a "Sybaritic effort," and offered its sarcastic speculation that the house captain would be expected to "wear evening dress after 6 o'clock, at least."
The unveiling of the ornate fire station set off "a political and civic storm." It was called a waste of taxpayer funds, as critics contended "three station houses could be built for what this cost." Amid the outcry, city fire commissioners denied knowledge that the fire house was to have been so luxurious, though newspapers reported that the commissioners had approved the plans.
Operation.
Fire Station No. 23 remained an active firehouse from 1910-1960. When it opened, it was manned by fifteen firefighters and ten horses. The original equipment included a horse wagon, chief's buggy, and a pumper that used a vertical tube boiler. The company's first major call was a fire in the old Byrne Building that took ten hours to extinguish.
The station also served as the department's headquarters from 1910–1920, and the home for every fire chief from 1910 to 1928, including chief Ralph J. Scott. Chief Scott's wife, Addie Scott, lived with him on the third floor and later recalled the station's early days: "I remember the horses. They really knew what to do. When the bell would ring, they would come out and stand there to be hitched up. ... It was a nice life here for us. ... I remember trying to wax all these floors, and I just couldn't do it. So someone came and helped me. This is a lot of floor space you know."
Fire Station No. 23 was closed in November 1960 as the Los Angeles Fire Department began replacing older stations with newer stations with modern facilities. At the time of its closure, some of the 1,100 men who had worked there attended a ceremony as the building was "mustered out of service."
Museum.
Historic status.
In 1966, the station was declared a Historic Cultural Monument by the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission; at the time of the declaration the "Los Angeles Times" called it the "Taj Mahal of fire stations." A Library of Congress survey of 250 firehouses concluded that Station 23's interior was "unmatched in its beauty." It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.
Controversy over restoration.
Through the 1960s and 1970s, the station deteriorated. The surrounding neighborhood became part of the city's "Skid Row" and the station became "a hangout for the street people." Looters stole most of the copper tubing and brasswork, banisters, doorknobs, firebells, and even the five brass firepoles.
By the mid-1970s, concerns were raised that the building had become a hazard, and some proposed tearing it down. However, in 1979, the Fire Commission announced plans to restore the rooms back to their 1910 condition and turn the station into a museum. The City Council placed the station under control of the fire department, but provided that no city funds were to be used in creating the museum.
In 1981, officials of the fire department set up a nonprofit organization called Olde 23 to raise funds to build the museum, but sufficient funds were never raised. The projected cost of the museum, even in 1982, was $1 million, and critics questioned the wisdom of building a museum in Skid Row. In 1988, the city settled on a different location for the Los Angeles Fire Department Museum -- Engine Co. No. 27 in Hollywood.
Fire Station No. 23 became the subject of controversy again in 1995 when the "Los Angeles Times" ran a 2,200-word, front-page article reporting on alleged misuse of city funds by Olde 23, the nonprofit charged with restoration of the station. Even though plans for the fire department museum had shifted to another location years earlier, Olde 23 continued to live on, banking more than $200,000 in fees from film and television producers using the station house as a shooting location. The "Times" reported that ex-Chief Donald O. Manning had not told other city agencies about Olde 23's continued operations, and Olde 23 had failed to turn over the income, as required by city law. Investigations by the "Times" and the City Controller also revealed that some filming fees had been paid in cash to James Croak, an American artist who leased the building from the City of Los Angeles from 1978–85, but no illegality was found as Mr. Croak had the right to sub-lease the property for short periods as long as he notified the landlord that he was doing so. Notably Mr. Croak used most of the money to replace missing brass fire poles, balustrades and other period fixtures that were missing. Other fees were not accounted for, and Olde 23 the museum Non-Profit had even collected fees for use of other city fire stations as shooting locations. Also, even after the city chose a new location for a fire department museum, the chief did not use the funds collected by "Olde 23" for the museum. The controversy came to light after an angry official for Warner Bros. wrote a memorandum complaining about "donations" to the Fire Department and referring to such donations as "extortion."
Filming location.
Since 1978 when James Croak occupied the building after an 18-year vacancy, Fire Station No. 23 became a popular filming location for motion pictures, television productions, commercials, and music videos. In 1995, the "Los Angeles Times" wrote: "With its finely restored interior and turn-of-the-century architecture, old Fire Station 23 in Downtown Los Angeles is one of the choicest filming locations in town." One producer called it "a great raw architectural space that you can do a lot with."
The first major motion picture filmed at Station 23 was Hammett (1982) by German director Wim Wenders, followed two years later by Ghostbusters. The station was used in the 1984 production as the location for the interior scenes of the headquarters of Drs. Venkman, Stantz and Spengler and Winston Zeddemore. (Another station in New York was used for the exterior shots; New York's Hook and Ladder Company #8.) The success of Ghostbusters helped popularize the station as a shooting location, and Fire Station No. 23 has since then been used in more than 50 productions, including "Big Trouble in Little China" (1986), "Ghostbusters II" (1989), "The Mask" (1994), "Police Academy 2" (1985), "A-Team" (1986) and "V.I. Warshawski" (1991), "Flatliners" (1991), "Lost Highway" (1997), "National Security" (2003), and "RE(e)volution" (2005).

Box Car Blues

Box Car Blues, released in 1930, is the fifth title in the "Looney Tunes" series. It features Bosko and a pig traveling as hobos in a boxcar.
Plot.
The film opens with a "toot-toot" and a train is seen chugging down the tracks, whistling ever so often. The front wheels turn into a pair of hands, that manually squeeze the whistle in order to make a distinct honking sound. The scene then moves to a boxcar at the back of the train, where Bosko is singing and dancing, accompanied by a banjo playing pig. They are quite jolly until Bosko starts a mournful rendition of "Cryin' for the Carolines", at which the pig starts to cry. Suddenly Bosko and the pig are thrown towards the back of the boxcar. The pig seems to be out cold whilst Bosko looks around, trying to understand what is going on. Bosko tries to revive the pig but is unsuccessful. The scene pans to show that the train is climbing a hill, which explains the tilted boxcar.
The train straightens itself at the top of the hill but then goes over a bridge, which bends exaggeratedly to accommodate its weight. Through a tunnel and then uphill again at almost a ninety degree angle, the train is now exhausted and starts panting as it begins to slow down. It then starts crawling like a giant caterpillar, curling and uncurling itself as it moves up the hill. Just a few feet from the summit, the train reaches out its wheels cum hands in an attempt to get a handhold but as it grabs the mountain, we see a part of the hillside peeling away and displaying spotted underwear. The mountain, using tree trunks as hands, reaches back and pulls up its pseudo-pants, looking quite angry as it does so. The train now begins to haul itself up using the railroad as a rope, manages to reach the top and goes over. However, the last boxcar breaks free and races back down the steep slope.
Bosko lifts a small hatch in the roof and looks out frantically. His head gets knocked off by an overhanging sign and is left bouncing by itself on the roof. His headless body then climbs onto the roof and manages to reattach his head. Next the boxcar splits in two and Bosko is left with one foot on each side, balancing precariously over the speeding vehicle. Oddly enough, we do not see any sign of the banjo playing pig inside the split boxcar, which eventually comes back together. The boxcar continues to split and come together in this fashion several times. At one point, Bosko lengthens his neck, twists it into a winch of sorts and uses it to haul the boxcar pieces back together. The next tunnel is so low that Bosko gets thrown off the roof and tumbles down the outside of the tunnel, falling astride a cow at the other end.
The cow starts galloping down the railtrack and Bosko gets thrown off as they enter another tunnel. He tumbles over it and ends up back on the roof of the boxcar which is now speeding along just behind the running cow. The boxcar goes over a bump and Bosko gets thrown off again, only to grab the edge of a pipe attached to the roof, which detaches from the side of the boxcar and drags Bosko along, bumping him hard against the ground. Bosko is then dragged through several trees and electricity poles when he eventually hits a bump in the road and gets thrown back onto the roof of the boxcar, which breaks and drops him inside.
The cow sees a tree and comes to halt, causing the boxcar to flatten it against the tree. The cow then unravels itself, in the manner of an accordion and walks away, whilst pieces of the shattered boxcar rain down including Bosko and the pig, who fall onto a flat, open wagon. The pig opens an umbrella to shield them from the falling debris. When the pig finally puts his umbrella away, assuming that the debris has stopped falling, one last piece falls directly on his head. This gives him a large bump and he starts to cry. Bosko dries his tears and pushes off down the track on the little wagon. He starts playing the banjo and singing as the pig cheers up and starts to sing along with him. They disappear into a tunnel as we see the closing credits.
Other.
This short is said to feature only rudimentary backgrounds although most other titles in the series include more complex backgrounds.
The gag involving a cow getting smashed against a tree and turning into an accordion is later reused in Bosko and Bruno (1932).

SB-205,384

SB-205,384 is an anxiolytic drug. It has similar effects to benzodiazepine drugs, but is structurally distinct and so is classed as a nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic. 
SB-205,384 is a GABAA positive allosteric modulator, which binds preferentially to α3, α5, and α6 subunit containing subtypes. It has a novel mechanism of action, prolonging the duration of GABA-mediated chloride flux but without increasing the intensity of the response, and this may give it an unusual pharmacological profile, with tests showing that it alters the firing of some populations of neurons while leaving others unaffected. Animal studies have shown it to produce both anxiolytic and anti-aggressive effects, but with little sedation or other behavioural changes.

William Hayes (composer)

William Hayes (26 January 1708 (baptised) – 27 July 1777) was an English composer, organist, singer and conductor. 
Life.
Hayes was born in Gloucester. He trained at Gloucester Cathedral and spent the early part of his working life as organist of St Mary’s, Shrewsbury (1729) and Worcester Cathedral (1731). The majority of his career was spent at Oxford where he was appointed organist of Magdalen College in 1734, and established his credentials with the degrees of B.Mus in 1735 and D.Mus in 1749. (He was painted by John Cornish in his doctoral robes around 1749.) In 1741 he was unanimously elected Professor of Music and organist of the University Church. He presided over the city’s concert life for the next 30 years, and was instrumental in the building of the Holywell Music Room in Oxford in 1748, the oldest purpose-built music room in Europe. He was one of the earliest members of the Royal Society of Musicians, and in 1765 was elected a ‘privileged member’ of the Noblemen’s and Gentlemen’s Catch Club. He died in Oxford, aged 69.
Music style.
William Hayes was an enthusiastic Handelian, and one of the most active conductors of his oratorios and other large-scale works outside London. His wide knowledge of Handel left a strong impression on his own music, but by no means dominated it. As a composer he tended towards genres largely ignored by Handel—English chamber cantatas, organ-accompanied anthems and convivial vocal music—and his vocal works show an English preference for non-da capo aria forms. Hayes also cultivated a self-consciously ‘learned’ polyphonic style (perhaps inspired by his antiquarian interests) which can be seen in his many canons, full-anthems, and the strict fugal movements of his instrumental works. Nevertheless, several of his late trio sonatas show that he was not deaf to newly emerging Classical styles. Although he published virtually none of his instrumental music, his vocal works were extremely popular, and the printed editions were subscribed to by large numbers of amateur and professional musicians. Substantial works like his ode "The Passions", the one-act oratorio "The Fall of Jericho", and his "Six Cantatas" demonstrate that Hayes was one of the finest English composers of the eighteenth century. 
As a writer, his "Art of Composing Music" includes the first published description of aleatoric composition—music composed by chance—albeit deliberately satirical in intent. In his "Remarks" he reveals much about his aesthetic outlook: in particular that he valued the music of Handel and Corelli over that of Rameau, Benedetto Marcello and Geminiani. Finally, the "Anecdotes" offer insights into the organization of provincial music festivals in the mid-eighteenth century. Hayes bequeathed his important and wide-ranging music library to his son Philip Hayes; the manuscripts of both father and son eventually passed to the Bodleian Library, Oxford, in 1801.

Islamgarh

Islamgarh () is a Municipal Committee of Mirpur District near Mangla Dam of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan. It is located on the southern part of the Pir Panjal Range, about 28 Kilometer in North-East of MirpurAzad Jammu & Kashmir, Pakistan is situated the talent producing Islamgarh, progressing rapidly in social, economic and educational fields. 
Before the construction of Mangla Dam, Islamgarh was 5 kilometer away from old Mirpur. The people of Islamgarh could easily approach that city on foot. But soon after the construction of Mangla Dam, the 5 kilometer distance was changed with 30 kilometer long distance (six times longer than the previous one). 
The road connecting Mirpur with Dadyal and Kotli passes through this town. On both sides of this road are fertile lands. Major crops of this region are wheat, maize and millet.
On the Northern side of this town are mountain stretches of Pirgali and on Northern-Western side lie patches of fertile land connected to Mangla dam. After Mangla Dam start the boundaries of New Mirpur city.
After the construction of Mangla dam, a large portion of fertile land submerged. Now due to Mangla Dam raising project, the people of adjoining villages (Chak Haryam, Andrah Klan, Bajar, Bandor, Lakhora and part of Kalyal Bainsi & Jammuie) of this town will sacrifice their homes once again. A perpetual sequence of problems will crop up again as a result of raising of Mangla Dam.
Rapid progress and fast growing population gave Islamgarh the status of town committee in 1979 and after attaching the union council Andrah Klan and village Kalyal Bainsi to Islamgarh, its status was raised to Municipal Committee in 1998. Total population of Municipal Committee, according to the 1998 census, was 15493.If the annual population growth rate is considered 2.9%, it means the population of Municipal committee must be 21000 in 2011. Total area of the municipal committee is 14,728 acres or 57 square kilometers. It means the density of population is 333 people per square kilometer. The population of area will increase if proposed bridge is constructed between Rathoa Muhammad Ali and Chak Haryam. In that case distance would be reduce to 5-7 Kilometers and it would become part of Mirpur. 
In 997 CE, Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi, took over the Ghaznavid dynasty empire established by his father, Sultan Sebuktegin, In 1005 he conquered the Shahis in Kabul in 1005, and followed it by the conquests of Punjab region. The Delhi Sultanate and later Mughal Empire ruled the region. The Punjab region became predominantly Muslim due to missionary Sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of Kashmir. 
After the decline of the Mughal Empire, the Dogra invaded and occupied Mirpur District. The Muslims faced severe restrictions during the Dogra rule. During the period of British rule, Mirpur District increased in population and importance. 
The predominantly Muslim population supported Muslim League and Pakistan Movement. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the minority Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India while the Muslims refugees from India settled down in the Mirpur District.
Many residents of Islamgarh have emigrated to the United Kingdom during the 1950-60s.
Islamgarh Welfare Trust established in 1992. Azad Jammu and Kashmir Council registered it on 28 April 1994 vide registration No: 90. The primary aim of Islamgarh Welfare Trust is to serve the distressed people and help the destitute.

Old Lace (comics)

Old Lace (often nicknamed as OL) is a fictional character in the Marvel Comics award-winning series "Runaways". She was created by Brian K. Vaughan & artist Adrian Alphona and debuted attacking the other characters in "Runaways" vol. 1 #2. Old Lace was given her name by Gertrude Yorkes after she had taken the code name Arsenic, making the pair Arsenic and Old Lace, which is a reference to a movie of the same name. Old Lace had originally belonged to Gert's parents. The dinosaur was genetically engineered to obey all of Gertrude's commands, meaning whenever Gert thought or felt something, so would the dinosaur. Initially believed to be a "Velociraptor", she is later correctly identified as a "Deinonychus" by Victor Mancha. Due to the psychic link that they share, Gertrude and Old Lace share emotions and physical pain such that if Old Lace had a cut, or was injured (which is often), Gert would have to endure her pain. After the death of Gert, the psychic link was transferred to Chase Stein.
Fictional character biography.
Initial appearance.
Old Lace was genetically engineered in the 87th century, the project being commissioned by Dale and Stacey Yorkes, the parents of Gertrude. At the parents request, the designer also put in several character traits which included a tele-empathic bond with Gertrude as well as being incapable of harming any of her immediate family, as discovered when Gertrude orders Old Lace to attack her parents and Old Lace refuses. Old Lace was originally intended to be part of Gert's inheritance for when her parents died but Gertrude and the rest of the Runaways stumble upon her while searching the Yorkes' basement for the body of a girl that they had witnessed their parents sacrificing.
As a Runaway.
Old Lace has a telepathic bond with Gert. This lets her feel each other's thoughts and pain, and allows Old Lace to act on Gert's emotions. Old Lace got her name from Gert Yorkes, who had temporarily been using "Arsenic" as her codename (essentially making the pair Arsenic and Old Lace, after the play and film of the same name). Though Gertrude later dropped the codename after deciding that some things from her parents (such as her real name) were worth keeping, Old Lace's name stuck. During their final encounter with The Pride Old Lace was briefly under the control of Alex Wilder while Gertrude was unconscious, but Gertrude quickly took control back when she came to. Seconds before Gert's death, she was able to pass her telepathic link with Old Lace to her boyfriend Chase Stein, since her death would have killed Lace as well via their telepathic link. Even though Old Lace has a telepathic bond with Chase now, she has been shown to have some free will. This is first shown when Old Lace attacks a vampire named Topher, despite Gertrude telling her to stop and again when Chase ties Nico up and Old Lace growls and tries to stop Chase.
Apparent death.
Chase, after his girlfriend's death, has been using Old Lace in a much more angry and aggressive manner, even going so far as to command Old Lace to rip an enemy's throat out; though eventually was called off by Chase after being scolded by Nico. The "Deinonychus" later went on to follow Chase but when ordered to hurt Karolina as well as Nico, Old Lace showed her own will by greeting them warmly.
In "Runaways" Vol. 3 #11, the first issue written by Kathryn Immonen and drawn by Sara Pichelli, Chase, Nico, Victor and Karolina hold a house prom. An outside source manages to send a UAV flying into the Runaways' Malibu home, in the upstairs living room where Klara and Old Lace lie. Nico, Victor and Karolina rush to save Klara and Old Lace - upon arriving at the top, however, it's revealed that Old Lace had heard the UAV coming but had only enough time to shield Klara with her body. Old Lace succeeds in protecting Klara but dies as a result.
In issue #13 Molly notices that Old Lace's body is missing.
In #14, Chase sees a girl resembling Gert. Before he runs out onto the street and gets hit by a truck, the girl yells at him to stop. Behind her in the shadows a dinosaur can be seen.
Years later, "Avengers Academy" revealed that Old Lace had in fact merely been transported to another dimension where she was alive and well, and she was rescued by the rest of the team.
Powers and abilities.
Despite being a normal dinosaur she has shown a good level of intelligence. In the first volume Old Lace had followed Gertrude and the group while they were traveling throughout Los Angeles after they discovered the dinosaur in her parents basement. She defeated the super hero Dagger with ease, because of her immunity to her light daggers. She was also useful when they first clashed with the Pride taking down the Stein's, and in their second battle when she defeated Mr. Hayes, and in their last battle with the Pride she was helpful in taking down Karolina's parents. It also should be mentioned on how she took down some of the Wrecking Crew. And while under Chase's leadership she has shown the intelligence in leaving a urine trail to be found on purpose and maneuvering on the side of a building to save Chase's life by sliding down the wall with her claws.
Old Lace's claws are also shown to be incredibly sharp, to a point where she can break through and hold onto a wall.
Relationship with other Runaways.
Gertrude.
Gert discovered that she had a telepathic bond to Old Lace when the dinosaur halted from attacking the Runaways because Gert yelled out "NO!" in fear. In one of the Runaways' early encounters with the Pride, Gert also discovered she had an empathic bond to Old Lace when she experienced the same pain Old Lace felt. Gert's telepathic bond to Old Lace allowed her to directly communicate with the dinosaur and command it to do anything she wished. The bond worked both ways, enabling Old Lace to transfer her thoughts directly to Gert, but Old Lace could not give commands to Gert in the same fashion. Old Lace was unconditionally loyal to Gert, even to the point of fighting against the team; Old Lace once lashed out at Nico without Gert's orders when Gert and Nico had their brief falling out. Gert and Old Lace's empathic bond allows them to share more than just thoughts, but physical pain as well. If Gertrude were to be hurt, Old Lace would feel the pain and vice versa. This is the reason why in "Runaways" volume 2, issue 7, Gert refuses to fight Swarm because she is allergic to bee stings and posits that even one sting on her could end the both of them.
Chase.
At the moment of Gertrude's death, she transfers her psychic link with Old Lace to her boyfriend Chase. From this moment, Old Lace becomes loyal to Chase. Chase uses Old Lace much more aggressively then Gertrude did, ordering her to rip an enemy's throat out. However, Old Lace does not follow Chase's order quite as well as she followed those of Gert. Old Lace sometimes protests and Chase has to remind her that he is in charge of her now. Just as with Gertrude, the psychic link with Chase shares the same disadvantage in that if either is injured, they will both share the pain.
Alex.
Alex was the original leader of the Runaways. He learned of Old Lace's existence before even Gertrude and masterminded a plan for her to stumble upon Old Lace seemingly accidentally. During the final battle with The Pride, Gertrude tells Old Lace that if anything happens to her, OL should obey Alex's commands. However, Gertrude is unaware that Alex is the teams traitor and is actually working for The Pride. Alex sees to it that Gertrude is knocked out and assumes control over Old Lace. Old Lace follows Alex until Gertrude revives and immediately takes control of Old Lace again and has the dinosaur turn against Alex.
Other Versions.
Old Lace can also be found in the "Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness" book. In several panels, the zombified Runaways are feeding upon Old Lace while a group of zombies chases down Blob.
In honor of "Pet Week", a celebration of all the Marvel Universe animals, several animal debut issues was available for free on Marvel's digital comics. "Runaways" #3 (June 2003), Old Lace's debut, was available to read for free on Friday, April 10.

The Great Kapok Tree

The Great Kapok Tree is an American children's picture book about rainforest conservation. It was written and illustrated by Lynne Cherry, and was originally published by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich in 1990. The book is dedicated to Chico Mendes, a Brazilian environmental activist who was murdered in 1988.
Plot.
This is the story of two people who go to an amazon rain forest to cut down trees for wood. When they arrive they stop beside a tree and the youngest person falls asleep. When the younger boy was sleeping several species of animals that lived in that tree came down, snakes, bees, butterflies, monkeys, and another species. They say why they need the tree and also say that this same tree is very important for our world. When the he woke up he took his ax, and he prepared to cut the tree. Before he cut the tree, he thought about what the animals had told him. Then he reflected and went on his way with his ax.
Inspiration.
Lynne Cherry conceived the idea for "The Great Kapok Tree" while on a train ride between Washington, DC and Connecticut. Afterwards, she started studying photographs from the World Wildlife Fund and roaming through the New York Botanical Garden for inspiration, but then decided to travel to Brazil to experience the rainforest firsthand. Arriving in 1989, she took a Jeep into the forest and spent several weeks sketching and photographing the animals she observed.
Cherry initially had trouble finding a publisher for the book, as it was deemed "too controversial". However, she refused to alter the basic message.When the book was released in 1990, coinciding with the twentieth anniversary of Earth Day, Cherry told a reporter, "When kids grow up, in another 20 years, they'll be the people making the decisions. If they're raised with these ideas ingrained in them, it will affect national policy. We will have raised a whole generation of environmentalists."
Reception.
Upon its release, the book received mixed reviews from some critics. Kimberly Olson Fakih in the "Los Angeles Times" praised it for its "splendid paintings in tropical colors" but said the story was undermined by "soap-box oratory". Similarly, Susan Bolotin in the "New York Times" said the book had "lush illustrations" but suffered from "peculiar language" and "preachiness". However, the book proved to be a popular seller. The first printing of 15,000 copies sold out within a few weeks after the book's release, and by 1995, it had sold a quarter-million copies. Many American elementary teachers started using the book in their classes, and the story even inspired some school plays.
"The Great Kapok Tree" has since received a Charlotte Award from the New York State Reading Association. It has also been named an NSTA-CBC Outstanding Science Trade Book for Children, an American Bookseller's Association "Pick of the Lists", and an International Reading Association Teacher's Choice.

Choi Jungsook

Choi Jungsook (10 February 1902 – 23 February 1977) was an activist in the Korean independence movement and women's movement. She was also an educator, a doctor, the first woman principal in Jeju, and the first woman superintendent in Korea. Through her achievements, she was conferred a decoration by the Pope and she was honored with 516 national awards. She was the woman who devoted herself to education, public welfare, and medicine of her hometown and country.
Early life and education.
Choi was born as the first daughter of Choi Wonsoon, who was a lawyer in Samdori, Jeju. Her father let her enter Shin-seong Girls' School, which a French priest established. 
Meanwhile, when Choi was 8, Korea came under Japanese rule. When she was 12, she received baptism because of the influence of her teacher nun. Then she became the first graduate in that school. After graduation, she entered Kyungsung National Women's High School to study education. Most of the teachers and students were Japanese, so Korean students faced much hostility. 
Career.
After Emperor Gojong died in 1919, she went to Daehanmun and wept with compatriots. She organized a girl's suicide squad for save-the-nation drive with 79 students. It was led by Park, Heedo, who drafted the Declaration of Independence. They also joined the March 1st Movement movement and shouted "Hurrah for Korean Independence Day" after leaping over the fences of their dormitories. Consequently, she was caught by the Japanese military police and tortured. 
After the hardships of prison life, she came back to her hometown. She was aware that teaching unenlightened people was necessary to get the country back. So she established Yeosuwon and taught students, illiterate people, women and girls. Because of the hardships of prison life, she was in poor health. Finally, she decided to learn medicine for philanthropic work. So she entered Kyungsung Women's Medical School when she was 37 years old. After getting a medical license, she worked in Seongmo Hospital.
Meanwhile, she heard the news that Jeju had a bad situation. So she came back to her hometown, opened Junghwa Hospital and treated patients. One year later, Korean Independence Day came, and she decided to make comrades be aware of their illiteracy. So she spread out movement of Shinseong's restoration and finally got a license of establishing Shinseong Girls' Middle School and High School. And she became the principal of those schools. She dedicated herself to women's education and welfare service in Jeju until she retired due to the age limit. After all, the Vatican conferred a decoration of the Pope for her merits of contribution to education, public welfare, and medicine. 
After retirement as the principal, she was concentrating on treating patients. At that time, she heard the news that she had been elected to the first superintendent in Jeju. She has been the only woman superintendent in Korea. During the four years of her tenure in office, she built 270 elementary classrooms and 66 secondary classrooms. She focused on women's education and touched off a boom of library construction. In the end, she was honored with 516 national award and she made a Junghwa scholarship fund with a prize of one million won. She devoted herself to the development of Jeju, but she couldn't accomplish her dream of becoming a nun. However, she lived like a nun as a spinster, and she gave her life to the work of God. She died at the age of 76 on 22 February 1977. After her death, she received a presidential citation in 1993, and she was selected as an independence movement fighter from Jeju in March 2006.

Edgehead

Edgehead (also known as Chesterhill) is a village in Midlothian, Scotland.
Location.
Edgehead is situated east of Dewartown and Mayfield, north-west of Pathhead and south-east of Dalkeith. Two areas of woodland, Windmill Wood and Chesterhill Wood, are located beside the northern end of the village.
History.
The village developed along the long straight Roman road Dere Street, and remains linear in nature. It expanded in the 19th century when a coal mine was opened in Windmill Woods. The village once contained four shops supplying both residents and local farms. It was designated a conservation area by Midlothian Council in 1982, and redesignated following a review in 1996. The population of Edgehead was 115 in August 2008.
Edgehead Colliery.
Edgehead Colliery was a coal mine located in Windmill Woods in the 19th and 20th century. It was initially owned by the Earl of Stair. Around 1930 ownership transferred to the Fordel Mains (Midlothian) Colliery Company, and it became part of the National Coal Board in 1949. The colliery was closed in 1959, and the site is now owned by the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland. In 1842 the mine employed 127 workers; by 1959 this had fallen to 40.
Naming.
Although the village is often called Edgehead, this name is in fact technically applied only to the farmhouse located at the top of the hill. The correct name for the remainder of the village is Chesterhill. Chesterhill is descended from an ancient cattlefold which later became a Roman camp; Edgehead literally means "fold".
Facilities.
Edgehead has no local shops as of 2010. A small park and children's play area is located near the top of the village. A telephone box and letter box are found near the top of the village.
Cranston Primary School was located at the south of the village. In 2004 it had 57 pupils. However it has since been closed following the opening of a number of new primary schools in Midlothian and the site sold for redevelopment.
Historic buildings.
Edgehead contains three listed buildings:
Transport.
Edgehead is located on a minor road which runs from Pathhead to join an unnumbered road north of Whitehill which leads to Dalkeith. The road into Dalkeith previously formed part of the trunk A68 road, but was bypassed in September 2008 to relieve traffic congestion in Dalkeith town centre. There is some evidence from 17th-century maps to suggest that the road through Edgehead was part of the main route between Edinburgh and Lauder now part of the A68. It was originally part of the Roman road Dere Street, which ran from York to Cramond.
The village is served by Perryman's Buses bus routes 51 (Edinburgh-Jedburgh) and 52 (Edinburgh-Kelso), which combine to provide an hourly service in each direction Monday to Saturday daytimes.

Áed Aired

Áed Aired (died 698) or Áed Airdd or Áed Airech was a Dal nAraide king of the Cruithne in Ulaid (Ulster). He ruled from 690-698.
In the 6th and 7th centuries the Dal nAraide were part of a confederation of Cruithne tribes in Ulaid (Ulster) and were the dominant members. He was a member of the Uí Dercu Chéin sept which resided in the Lagan river valley on the borders of modern County Down and Antrim.The annals call him King of Dal nAraide at his death obit whereas the normal title used during this time was King of the Cruithne. 
The annals record his death at the Battle of Telach Garraisc in Fernmag (Farney, County Monaghan) along with Conchobar Macha mac Máele Dúin, King of the Airthir (an Airgialla tribe of modern County Armagh) in 698. One explanation of the battle is that they were allies fighting against the Uí Cremthainn (another Airgialla tribe of eastern County Fermanagh and northern County Monaghan) Another is that Conchobar was his enemy and they slew each other in battle. The motivation may have been to protect the ecclesiastical independence of Armagh from the Cenél nEógan

In July 2008 it was announced on the band's official website that the recording of this song was complete. Bjorn Thorsrud was confirmed as a co-producer of the track, stating: "'G.L.O.W.' has me glowing all over". Later that month the band's website reported that the track had entered the mixing stage, with mixing by Chris Lord-Alge, and that it was still slated for a September release. The article also featured a photo of Billy Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlin among others at Ardent Studios in Memphis, Tennessee where "G.L.O.W." was recorded.

Ehrendorferia ochroleuca

Ehrendorferia ochroleuca (formerly Dicentra ochroleuca), commonly known as white eardrops or yellow bleeding-heart, is a biennial or perennial, native to gravelly areas in the chaparral and woodlands of California (Peninsular, Transverse, and southern Coast Ranges) and in Baja California.
Description.
Stems and leaves are glaucous. Stems grow tall; the record is , the tallest of any species in the Fumarioideae. Leaves are pinnately divided 2-4 times. They grow in a basal rosette the first year and later also on flowering stems.
Flowers are up-facing, in round clusters at the end of the stems. They have 2 round sepals and 4 dull white petals with purple tips. The 2 outer petals are pouched at the base and curved outwards at the tip. The 2 inner petals are connected at the tip and project out from between the outer petals. The flowers have no odor, unlike the closely related species "Ehrendorferia chrysantha". Hummingbirds visit the flowers for nectar.
Seeds are tiny and bumpy, in a rounded pod long, tapering to a point at both ends. They lack the elaiosomes present in many other members of the family. They do not easily germinate without being exposed to smoke. In cultivation, a liquid smoke extract is often used.

Nick Jordan (politician)

Nick Jordan (born 1949) is an American Republican politician who was formerly a member of the Kansas State Senate for the 10th District, which is centered around Shawnee, Kansas. He was also the unsuccessful Republican candidate for in 2008, losing to Democratic incumbent Dennis Moore. When Moore decided not to run for another term in 2010, Jordan briefly ran for the seat once again before dropping out. Jordan was nominated by Governor-elect Sam Brownback to serve as his Secretary of Revenue. His nomination was confirmed by the State Senate.
Early life.
Jordan was born in 1949 and is a lifelong Kansan. Jordan started his career as a busboy, eventually becoming a hotel manager and founding president of the Overland Park Convention and Visitors Bureau. Jordan has a 40-year career in the travel and tourism industry. Jordan has been married to his wife Linda for over 25 years; together they have a daughter and three grandchildren.
State Senator.
In 1995, Jordan was selected by Republican precinct committee people and appointed by then-Gov. Bill Graves to fill the seat vacated by a former state senator. Succeeding that, Jordan was reelected without serious opposition. One of the more powerful and influential senators in Kansas, Jordan served as chairman of numerous committees. He was the chairman of the Joint Committee on Economic Development and co-chairman of the Commerce Committee. Jordan retired in 2008 to run for Congress.
Education Voting Record.
Jordan like most Johnson County Representatives has continually voted against increasing education funding statewide. This insistence eventually led the Kansas City Star to endorse his 2004 opponent saying Jordan "can't be counted on to make tough votes raising money for our schools".
2008 Congressional race.
Jordan informally entered the Congressional race in August 2007. Upon his entry, the Kansas City Star noted Jordan claimed to have united the divided factions, the social conservatives and the economic conservatives, that have split the Republican Party in the recent past. The Kansas City Star concluded that he would be a formidable challenger to Moore in the 3rd, which has traditionally been the heartland of moderate Kansas Republicans. Steve Rose, publisher of The Johnson County Sun, however, has highlighted Jordan's consistently conservative voting record saying, "He votes with the right-wing crowd on education, embryonic stem cell research, and all the other hot-button right-wing issues. I know Nick Jordan, and he is no moderate." According to Jordan's website, his top campaign issues include making health care more accessible, keeping the economy strong and returning integrity back to Congress.
Jordan lost to Moore but garnered more than 142,000 votes. Mary Pilcher-Cook replaced him in the State Senate. He then became a director with Cohen-Esrey Real Estate Services in Mission, Kansas. He announced his intention to run for the seat again in 2010 but left the race a few months later before the primary election had occurred.
Jordan as Secretary of Revenue leads the $40 million effort to upgrade the DMS software in Kansas. This system was implemented in May of 2012 and it caused major problems for the county offices responsible for processing vehicle titles and registrations.

Last Tribe (Swedish band)

Last Tribe was a Swedish heavy metal/power metal band started by guitarist Magnus Karlsson. 
Karlsson was born south of Sweden in 1973. He started playing guitar at age 10 and quickly joined many bands. In 1996, he started an education at Malmö College Of Music and was awarded a master degree in music education in 2000. Karlsson joined the band Midnight Sun on the album "Nemesis" in 1999. He quickly received much attention due to his incredible skills with a guitar and decided that it was time for him to start his own band. The result was Last Tribe with their first album "The Ritual" in 2001. The album was widely successful and so the band decided to write another album, only this time, without Kristoffer and Pär. The two new members were bassist, Dick Lövgren and drummer, Jaime Salazar, going on to write two more albums together, "Witch Dance" (2002) and "The Uncrowned" (2003).

<doc id="18456928" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18456928" title="Samus Aran">
Samus Aran

Introduced in the 1986 video game "Metroid", Samus Aran is an ex-Galactic Federation soldier who turned into an intergalactic bounty hunter, usually fitted with a powered armor suit with weapons that include directed energy weapons and missiles. Throughout the series, she executes missions given to her by the Galactic Federation while hunting the antagonistic Space Pirates and their leader, Ridley, along with the parasitic energy-draining organisms called Metroids. Samus has appeared in all "Metroid" video games and has also been featured in media outside of the series, including the comic book version of "" and the "Super Smash Bros." series.
She is well known as one of the earliest female protagonists in video game history and remains a popular character over a quarter-century after her first appearance.
Character.
"Super Metroid's Player's Guide" describes Samus as a strong muscular woman who is tall and weighs without her armor. She is mostly seen inside the Power Suit, a powered exoskeleton which protects her from most dangers she encounters and can be enhanced by power-ups collected during gameplay. Typically, one of her suit's arms carries a cannon, which can be charged to shoot an extra-powerful blast, a limited number of missiles, and various beams. Samus's suit can collapse into a sphere, a mode called the Morph Ball, allowing her to roll through tight areas such as tunnels. The suit can scan objects to learn more about them, and has a grapple beam used to cross large distances, such as chasms. Since ', Samus has been accompanied by her Gunship, which is used in the games to save progress and restore health and ammunition. Appearances of Samus outside the Power Suit occur mostly in cutscenes, such as ending screens showing Samus in more revealing clothing. ' also introduced the Zero Suit, a form-fitting jumpsuit that she dons below the Power Suit.
The "Metroid" e-manga covers Samus's origins. She was born and raised on the mining planet K-2L, and when she was a child, the planet was raided by Space Pirates, led by Ridley, in an attack that killed both her parents and destroyed the planet. The orphaned Samus was then found by a bird-like alien race known as the Chozo, who brought her to their home planet Zebes. Samus was infused with Chozo DNA to give her a strong resistance to foreign environments, then trained as a warrior and given one of the alien race's artifacts, the Power Suit. She enlisted in the Galactic Federation Police, but left for disagreements with her commanding officer Adam Malkovich. Samus then started working as a freelance bounty hunter, and is called on by the Galactic Federation to execute missions "because of her superior skills and sense of justice". Most of her missions revolve around the galaxy while getting rid of unsavory elements like the enigmatic organism known as Metroids, who can drain life energy and are frequently used as biological weapons.
Development.
The style for the original "Metroid" game was designed to be a cross between the side-scrolling gameplay of the "Super Mario" games and the exploration and puzzle-solving aspects of "The Legend of Zelda" series, with inspiration from science fiction. The game's characters were conceived by Makoto Kano, while Hiroji Kiyotake designed the main protagonist Samus Aran. Samus is able to collapse into a ball to travel through tight areas. The ability, called the Maru Mari (meaning "round ball" in Japanese) in the original "Metroid" (1986), and later the more popular title of Morph Ball in "Super Metroid", was conceived by the developers because it required less effort to animate than "a cyborg crawling on all fours", and the producer for "Metroid", Gunpei Yokoi, took advantage of this shortcut.
The original game's atmosphere was influenced by Ridley Scott's film, "Alien" (1979). The series' co-creator Yoshio Sakamoto recalled, "We were partway through the development process when one of the staff members said 'Hey, wouldn't that be kind of cool if it turned out that this person inside the suit was a woman?'" The developers voted on the concept, and it passed. The game's instruction manual refers to Samus as if she were male to keep her true gender a secret until the end of the game. Samus was one of the first major female protagonists in a video game. Although Toby Masuyo ("Kissy") from Namco's Alien Sector predates her by one year as a female protagonist, "Guinness World Records 2013: Gamer's Edition" declared Samus as "the first playable human female character in a mainstream videogame", and as being "enduringly" popular, noting that sales of the "Metroid" series has exceeded 17.44 million copies as of 22 September 2012. Sakamoto noted that during the course of the "Metroid" series, developers constantly try to express Samus's femininity without turning her into a sex object. Samus's image was based on actress Kim Basinger from "9 Weeks" and "My Stepmother Is an Alien". Sakamoto and Kiyotake said that the character's last name "Aran" was taken from Edson "Aran"tes do Nascimento, the birth name of famous soccer player Pelé.
Appearances.
In the series.
In "Metroid", the Galactic Federation sends Samus to track down the Space Pirates on their home planet of Zebes. Deep within their base, she battles Mother Brain, the organism that controls the base's defenses, and she escapes just as the base self-destructs. In "", the Galactic Federation commissions Samus to exterminate all Metroid creatures on the planet SR388. She travels deep into the planet's caverns. After dispatching a Metroid Queen, Samus discovers a small Metroid hatchling, which imprints on her, thinking she is its mother. She spares its life and takes it back to her gunship.
In "Super Metroid", just after giving the hatchling to a Federation research station, Samus tracks the hatchling (stolen by Ridley) to a newly rebuilt Space Pirate base on Zebes. She travels deep underground, eventually finding the now-fully-grown Metroid, then battling a new, more powerful Mother Brain. The Metroid hatchling sacrifices itself to save Samus, and Samus in turn defeats Mother Brain and escapes as the entire planet is destroyed. In "Metroid Fusion", Samus returns to SR388, where a parasitic infection nearly kills her. Federation scientists surgically remove large sections of her corrupted Varia Suit and inject her with the Metroid hatchling's DNA to save her. To prevent the parasites from spreading beyond SR388 and the space station orbiting above it, Samus sets the station to crash into the planet.
"", which takes place between "Super Metroid" and "Fusion", provides more information about Samus's backstory and her emotional connection to both the Metroid hatchling and her former commander, Adam Malkovich, as well as her relation to all four Mother Brain designs, namely Zebes' Mother Brains, Aurora Unit 313 and MB.
In "Metroid Prime", Samus travels to the planet Tallon IV, which contains a Chozo colony in ruins and a Space Pirate base. There she learns of Phazon, a mysterious mutagen that can alter the genetic material of any organism. Samus is eventually able to access the source of the planet's Phazon contamination, a meteor impact crater, where she defeats the Phazon-infused creature Metroid Prime. In ', Samus is sent to the planet Aether, a Phazon meteor-ravaged planet split into light and dark dimensions. There she battles the Ing, creatures that are able to possess other organisms, and Dark Samus, an evil doppelgänger of herself formed from the remains of Metroid Prime. In "Metroid Prime Hunters", Samus competes against six rival bounty hunters in a race to recover an alien ultimate weapon. In ', Samus is infected by Phazon and is slowly corrupted by the mutagen while she works to prevent it from spreading to other planets. By the end of the game, she renders all Phazon inert by destroying its original source, the planet Phaaze, and defeats Dark Samus.
Other appearances.
Samus was featured in a series of comic books called "", published by Valiant Comics in 1990, based on the animated series of the same name, despite Samus never appearing in the cartoon version. In the comics, Samus is depicted as brash, money-hungry, and fiercely independent. 1UP.com described Samus in the "Captain N" comics as "rambunctious, reckless, and gets into pissing contests with Lana over Kevin's affections, which makes for some of the most entertaining situations in the series." Comic book and manga adaptations of "Metroid" games were also developed.
Samus is a playable character in all four games in the "Super Smash Bros." series of multiplayer fighting games, where she can use her array of weapons in combat against characters from other video games. "Super Smash Bros. Brawl" also features an alternate form of Samus called Zero Suit Samus, in which the heroine loses her Power Suit and has a different set of movements and attacks. She also stars in the Subspace Emissary fighting Ridley with Pikachu by her side.
Samus makes cameo appearances in the games "Galactic Pinball" (1995), ' (1996), "Kirby Super Star" (1996), and "Kirby's Dream Land 3" (1997), and also makes a non-playable appearance in ' by "Metroid: Other M" co-developers Team Ninja.
Many various figures based on the character were produced by various manufacturers. First 4 Figures built 2,500 Varia Suit Samus figures, selling all of them. Good Smile Company produced a figma and a statue of Samus based on the "Other M" Samus. 
Reception.
As a woman in a male-dominated role, Samus has been widely considered a breakthrough for female characters in video games. Samus' reveal in the original "Metroid" was named as the greatest twist in video games by "Game Informer" in 2007 and as the greatest moment in Nintendo's history by GameDaily in 2008. "The Irish Times" found it refreshing to learn that the series' protagonist, who is "well disguised under the suit of heavy armour", is female, but "The Independent" wrote that the "Transformer-like suit she wears could just as easily contain a large centipede; it's hardly a breakthrough for feminism." According to the book "Gaming Lives in the Twenty-First Century: Literate Connections", Samus was perhaps the most nonsexualized female video-game character ever, a belief shared in "Introduction to Game Development", which also considered Samus as one of Nintendo's most popular video game mascots. According to "The Sacramento Bee" in 2002, "Unlike most other female video game characters, Samus isn't some husky-voiced bimbo in tight leather included only for sex appeal. Samus is tough, silent, heavily armed and spends most of her time in a bulky suit of high-tech Power Armor." That same year, however, the "Toronto Star" stated that the "sexual politics" surrounding Samus and the "Metroid" series needed to stop, arguing that the original "big crazy shock to the gaming public" was "some seriously misspent energy" as she "is not a woman for the benefit of the sweaty/excited crowd, and neither is she a standard-bearer nor a courageous leader in the struggle for video game civil rights. She is a supremely talented action figure, and in the closeups on her helmet you can kind of see that she wears mascara, but that is all." Including her on the 2004 list of "top ten forces of good" (one section on their list of top 50 retro game characters), "Retro Gamer" opined she has remained "a distinct female character, not relying on cheap thrills to capture the attention of gamers, which is more than can be said for some."
Nevertheless, much of her media reception came from her sex appeal. GameTrailers named Samus number one on a 2006 list of the top ten women of gaming, and number three among top ten "gamer babes" in 2007. GameDaily ranked Samus seventh on a list of the top "hottest game babes", describing her as "a refreshing change of pace, a tough, no nonsense warrior that isn't afraid to remove her famous orange and yellow power suit and let her hair down, especially to reveal her skin tight clothing." She was also listed on GameDaily's list of "hottest" blondes in video games, described as both one of Nintendo's most famous protagonists as well as a "curvaceous, drop-dead-gorgeous woman," and used to illustrate the "smart and sexy heroine" archetype on the list of top video game archetypes. In 2008, Spike placed Samus on the top of their list of "video game vixen" as "a foxy broad that conceals her curves inside a weapon of death and destruction," while MSN listed her as one of "the best-looking game characters with perfect figures." In 2009, UGO.com ranked Samus as 11th on a list of the top "girls of gaming" and as the eighth "hottest sci-fi girl", also including her in the 2011 list of 50 video game "hotties". Her Zero Suit was ranked by ScrewAttack as fourth on their 2010 list of the sexiest outfits in games, while AfterEllen ranked Samus as the tenth "hottest" female video game character. In 2011, GameFront featured her twice on the list of the best "boobs" in video game history, at 40th spot for her reveal in the original game and at sixth place for her modern appearance in "a ridiculously form-fitting jumpsuit." In 2012, "Complex" ranked her as the 24th "hottest" video game character, also ranking her as the fourth top "hot female killer" from video games, while Revision3 had her top their list of the sexiest "game girls". In 2013, Steve Jenkins of CheatCodes.com declared her the tenth "hottest video game girl" of all time.
In 2009, GameDaily called Samus the video game industry's "first dominant female, a femme de force that didn't rely on a man to save her," also ranking her number one on a list of the top Nintendo characters of all time. In 2010, James Hawkins of Joystick Division ranked her as number one top "badass lady" in video games, adding that she "made every other character on this list possible." That same year, UGO.com ranked her as 20th in a list of top heroes of all-time. In 2011, "Nintendo Power" listed Samus as their third favourite hero, citing her bravery in the face of dangerous situations. That same year, UGO.com also included her on the lists of the best alternate costumes (for her one-piece bathing swimsuit in the original game) and video game characters who need their own movies. "Empire" ranked her as the 26th greatest video game character, adding, "whether you see her as a breakthrough for feminism or just another faceless sci-fi warrior, 1986's unexpected reveal that showed women could be more in gaming lore than eye candy for geeky boys was a refreshing and unforgettable moment." In 2012, GamesRadar ranked her as the fiftth "most memorable, influential, and badass" protagonist in video games, adding: "Whether she's 2D or 3D, in a sidescroller or FPS, her strength and determination always shine through, allowing her the power to defeat floating aliens and space pirates alike." In 2013, "Complex" ranked her as the 11th "most badass" video game character of all time, as well as the number one greatest heroine in video game history, and the third greatest soldier in video games.
Samus has been well received by the video game community. In 2001, IGN remarked that Samus has a cult following greater than most other female video game characters. She was chosen by the users of IGN as the most requested character who should have her own movie franchise by the website's users, the staff remarking that her tragic past makes her a perfect candidate for a movie, especially the loss of both her parents to the Space Pirates. Among their list of voted characters, IGN considered Samus to be the video game character that "could lead the pack of video game adaptations that actually manage to live up to the source material." IGN also stated that Samus's theme song should be "Dude (Looks Like a Lady)" by Aerosmith because she "spends her time running around in a manly battle suit blasting first and taking names later." Samus appeared in multiple GameFAQs "Character Battle" contests, winning the "Character Battle V" in 2006. In 2009, GameSpot featured her in their poll "All Time Greatest Game Hero", in which she lost to Mario in the semi-finals. Paul O'Connor, the lead game designer for Sammy Studios and a fan of the "Metroid" series, remarked that players empathize and identify with Samus because she is often rewarded for indulging in her curiosity. The book "Videogames and Art" notes that in the original "Metroid" the player is not briefed on Samus's past or future; the only interaction that they have with the character is by being her through gameplay, while bits of information can be gleaned from the handbook and through concept art, adding, "Samus is very rare for the character intimacy gained solely through game play and for her stasis and then drastic change," referring to the revelation that she is a woman.
In his review of "Super Smash Bros.", GameSpot editor Jeff Gerstmann called Samus one of the characters that made Nintendo "what it is today." Samus was ranked fifth on GameDaily's 2009 list of top characters in the "Smash Bros." series, while IGN ranked her as the third-best character for "Super Smash Bros." Her controversial portrayal in "Metroid: Other M" received mixed reactions. Unlike other "Metroid" games, where Samus took full advantage of weapons and abilities available, she deactivated most of them until Commander Adam Malkovich authorized their use, despite obvious uses for them. G4 TV considered the portrayal of Samus as "sexist", stating that as she "cannot possibly wield the amount of power she possesses unless directed to by a man" and that her anxiety attack cannot be reconciled with her previous portrayals. The A.V. Club echoed the misgivings about Samus's immaturity, petulant behavior, and misguided loyalty. According to "GamePro", while the story and Samus' monologues did not compel them, "it helped contextualize her entire existence" which developed the character to "an actual human being who's using the vastness of space to try and put some distance between herself and the past." 1UP.com found the portrayal "lifeless and boring" and "nonsensical". GamesRadar wrote that "Other M" painted Samus, widely considered a strong female lead character, as "an unsure, insecure woman who desperately wants the approval of her former commanding officer." "Game Informer" listed her 1st on their list of the top ten "dorks" of 2010, citing her "lame backstory" in "Other M". On other hand, ScrewAttack applauded the elaboration on Samus's character, arguing that her breakdown is an accurate depiction of posttraumatic stress disorder and that she is portrayed as a three-dimensional character, a step up from the fans' long-standing misconceptions of Samus as "pathologically emotionless man-hating ice queen," while "supposedly enlightened gamers and game commentators" are making gender assumptions that are "all in [their heads."

Internet censorship in Vietnam

Internet censorship in Vietnam prevents access to websites critical of the Vietnamese government, expatriate political parties, and international human rights organizations, among others. Online police reportedly monitor Internet cafes and cyber dissidents have been imprisoned. Vietnam regulates its citizens' Internet access using both legal and technical means. The government's efforts to regulate, monitor, and provide oversight regarding Internet use has been referred to as a "Bamboo Firewall". 
The OpenNet Initiative classified the level of filtering in Vietnam as pervasive in the political, as substantial in the Internet tools, and as selective in the social and conflict/security areas in 2011, while Reporters without Borders considers Vietnam an "internet enemy". 
While the government of Vietnam claims to safeguard the country against obscene or sexually explicit content through its blocking efforts, many of the filtered sites contain politically or religiously critical materials that might undermine the Communist Party's hold on power. Amnesty International reported many instances of Internet activists being arrested for their online activities.
Background.
Vietnam's Internet regulation commenced in large part as a result of the government's 1997 decree concerning Internet usage, wherein the General Director of the Postal Bureau (DGPT) was granted exclusive regulatory oversight of the Internet. As a result, the DGPT regulated every aspect of the Internet, including the registration and creation of Internet Service Providers, and the registration of individuals wishing to use the Internet through subscription contracts.
Legal framework.
Regulatory responsibility for Internet material is divided along subject-matter lines with the Ministry of Culture and Information focusing on sexually explicit, superstitious, or violent content, while the Ministry of Public Security monitors politically sensitive content. Vietnam nominally guarantees freedom of speech, of the press, and of assembly through constitutional provisions, but state security laws and other regulations reduce or eliminate these formal protections in practice. All information stored on, sent over, or retrieved from the Internet must comply with Vietnam’s Press Law, Publication Law, and other laws, including state secrets and intellectual property protections. All domestic and foreign individuals and organizations involved in Internet activity in Vietnam are legally responsible for content created, disseminated, and stored. It is unlawful to use Internet resources or host material that opposes the state; destabilizes Vietnam’s security, economy, or social order; incites opposition to the state; discloses state secrets; infringes organizations’ or individuals’ rights; or interferes with the state’s Domain Name System (DNS) servers. Law on Information Technology was enacted in June 2006. Those who violate Internet use rules are subject to a range of penalties, from fines to criminal liability for offenses such as causing chaos or security order.
In September 2013, Decree 72 came into effect; making it illegal to distribute any materials online that "harms national security” or “opposes" the government, only allows users to "provide or exchange personal information" through blogs and social media outlets—banning the distribution of "general information" or any information from a media outlet (including state-owned outlets), and requires that foreign web companies operate servers domestically if they target users in Vietnam.
Censored content.
Subversive content.
OpenNet research found that blocking is concentrated on websites with contents about overseas political opposition, overseas and independent media, human rights, and religious topics. Proxies and circumvention tools, which are illegal to use, are also frequently blocked.
The majority of blocked websites are specific to Vietnam: those written in Vietnamese or dealing with issues related to Vietnam. Sites not specifically related to Vietnam or only written in English are rarely blocked. For example, the Vietnamese language version of the website for Radio Free Asia was blocked by both tested ISPs while the English-language version was only blocked by one. While only the website for the human rights organization Human Rights Watch was blocked in the tested list of global human rights sites, many Vietnamese-language sites only tangentally or indirectly critical of the government were blocked as well as sites strongly critical of the government.
The website of the British Broadcasting Corporation (www.bbc.co.uk), which has a significant journalistic presence, is an example of a website that is blocked—albeit intermittently.
Social networking.
The popular social networking website Facebook has about 8.5 million users in Vietnam and its user base has been growing quickly after the website added a Vietnamese-language interface. During the week of November 16, 2009, Vietnamese Facebook users reported being unable to access the website. Access had been intermittent in the previous weeks, and there were reports of technicians ordered by the government to block access to Facebook.
A supposedly official decree dated August 27, 2009, was earlier leaked on the Internet, but its authenticity has not been confirmed. The Vietnamese government denied deliberately blocking access to Facebook, and the Internet service provider FPT said that it is working with foreign companies to solve a fault blocking to Facebook's servers in the United States.
Blogging.
In Vietnam, Yahoo! 360° is a popular blogging service. After the government crackdown on journalists reporting on corruption in mid-2008, many blogs covered the events, often criticizing the government action. In response, the Ministry of Information proposed new rules that would restrict blogs to personal matters.
Global Voices Advocacy maintains a list of bloggers who have been arrested for their views expressed online.
Instant messaging.
Yahoo! messenger is amongst the instant messaging software that appears to be monitored, with messages often blocked (i.e., not seen by intended recipient).
Persecution for Internet activities.
A component of Vietnam’s strategy to control the Internet consists of the arrest of bloggers,
netizens and journalists. The goal of these arrests is to prevent dissidents from pursuing their activities, and to persuade others to practice self-censorship. Vietnam is the world’s second largest prison for netizens after China.

Personal computer

A personal computer (PC) is a general-purpose computer, whose size, capabilities and original sale price makes it useful for individuals, and which is intended to be operated directly by an end-user with no intervening computer operator. This contrasted with the batch processing or time-sharing models which allowed larger, more expensive minicomputer and mainframe systems to be used by many people, usually at the same time. Large data processing systems require a full-time staff to operate efficiently.
Software applications for most personal computers include, but are not limited to, word processing, spreadsheets, databases, Web browsers and e-mail clients, digital media playback, games and myriad personal productivity and special-purpose software applications. Modern personal computers often have connections to the Internet, allowing access to the World Wide Web and a wide range of other resources. Personal computers may be connected to a local area network (LAN), either by a cable or a wireless connection. A personal computer may be a desktop computer or a laptop, tablet or a handheld PC.
Early PC owners usually had to write their own programs to do anything useful with the machines, even lacking an operating system. The very earliest microcomputers, equipped with a front panel, required hand-loading of a bootstrap program to load programs from external storage (paper tape, cassettes, or eventually diskettes). Before very long, automatic booting from permanent read-only memory became universal.
Today's users have access to a wide range of commercial software, freeware and free and open-source software, which is provided in ready-to-run or ready-to-compile form. Since the early 1990s, Microsoft operating systems and Intel hardware have dominated much of the personal computer market, first with MS-DOS and then with Windows. Popular alternatives to Microsoft's Windows operating systems include Apple's OS X and the free open-source Linux and BSD operating systems. AMD provides the major alternative to Intel's central processing units. Applications and games for PCs are typically developed and distributed independently from the hardware or OS manufacturers, whereas software for many mobile phones and other portable systems is approved and distributed through a centralized online store.
History.
The Programma 101, was the first commercial "desktop personal computer," produced by the Italian company Olivetti and invented by the Italian engineer Pier Giorgio Perotto. The project started in 1962. It was launched at the 1964 New York World's Fair, volume production started in 1965. Retail price $ 3,200. 
Pier Giorgio Perotto also invented the magnetic card system.
Before the Programma 101 computers were as big as trucks and used only by men in white coats, Programma 101 was the size of a typewriter and accessible to all.
NASA bought at least 10 Programma 101 and used them for the calculations for the 1969 Apollo 11 Moon landing. The ABC Television used the Programma 101 to predict the presidential election of 1969, the U.S. military to plan their operations in the Vietnam War . 
The Programma 101 was also used in schools, hospitals, government offices etc. etc. 
In 1968 due to the similarities of the machines, Hewlett-Packard was ordered to pay about $900,000 in royalties to Olivetti after copying some of the solutions adopted in the Programma 101, like the magnetic card, the architecture and other components too similar, the Hewlett-Packard 9100A.
The Soviet MIR series of computers was developed from 1965 to 1969 in a group headed by Victor Glushkov. It was designed as a relatively small-scale computer for use in engineering and scientific applications and contained a hardware implementation of a high-level programming language. Another innovative feature for that time was the user interface combining a keyboard with a monitor and light pen for correcting texts and drawing on screen.
In what was later to be called the Mother of All Demos, SRI researcher Douglas Engelbart in 1968 gave a preview of what would become the staples of daily working life in the 21st century - e-mail, hypertext, word processing, video conferencing and the mouse. The demonstration required technical support staff and a mainframe time-sharing computer that were far too costly for individual business use at the time.
By the early 1970s, people in academic or research institutions had the opportunity for single-person use of a computer system in interactive mode for extended durations, although these systems would still have been too expensive to be owned by a single person.
In 1973 the IBM Los Gatos Scientific Center developed a portable computer prototype called SCAMP (Special Computer APL Machine Portable) based on the IBM PALM processor with a Philips compact cassette drive, small CRT and full function keyboard. SCAMP emulated an IBM 1130 minicomputer in order to run APL\1130. In 1973 APL was generally available only on mainframe computers, and most desktop sized microcomputers such as the Wang 2200 or HP 9800 offered only BASIC. Because SCAMP was the first to emulate APL\1130 performance on a portable, single user computer, "PC Magazine" in 1983 designated SCAMP a "revolutionary concept" and "the world's first personal computer". This seminal, single user portable computer now resides in the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.. Successful demonstrations of the 1973 SCAMP prototype led to the IBM 5100 portable microcomputer launched in 1975 with the ability to be programmed in both APL and BASIC for engineers, analysts, statisticians and other business problem-solvers. In the late 1960s such a machine would have been nearly as large as two desks and would have weighed about half a ton.
Another seminal product in 1973 was the Xerox Alto, developed at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), it had a graphical user interface (GUI) that later served as inspiration for Apple Computer's Macintosh, and Microsoft's Windows operating system. Also in 1973 Hewlett Packard introduced fully BASIC programmable microcomputers that fit entirely on top of a desk, including a keyboard, a small one-line display and printer. The Wang 2200 microcomputer of 1973 had a full-size cathode ray tube (CRT) and cassette tape storage. These were generally expensive specialized computers sold for business or scientific uses. The introduction of the microprocessor, a single chip with all the circuitry that formerly occupied large cabinets, led to the proliferation of personal computers after 1975.
Early personal computers — generally called microcomputers — were sold often in kit form and in limited volumes, and were of interest mostly to hobbyists and technicians. Minimal programming was done with toggle switches to enter instructions, and output was provided by front panel lamps. Practical use required adding peripherals such as keyboards, computer displays, disk drives, and printers. Micral N was the earliest commercial, non-kit microcomputer based on a microprocessor, the Intel 8008. It was built starting in 1972 and about 90,000 units were sold. In 1976 Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak sold the Apple I computer circuit board, which was fully prepared and contained about 30 chips. The first successfully mass marketed personal computer was the Commodore PET introduced in January 1977, but backordered and not available until later in the year. At the same times was introduced the Apple II (usually referred to as the "Apple") (June 1977), and the TRS-80 from Tandy Corporation / Tandy Radio Shack at summer 77, delivered in september in a small number, and the only one for this year, massivly (more than ten thousands... staff plans only two) since November 1977. Mass-market ready-assembled computers allowed a wider range of people to use computers, focusing more on software applications and less on development of the processor hardware.
During the early 1980s, home computers were further developed for household use, with software for personal productivity, programming and games. They typically could be used with a television already in the home as the computer display, with low-detail blocky graphics and a limited color range, and text about 40 characters wide by 25 characters tall. One such machine, the ZX Spectrum introduced at 1982, totaled 8 million unit sold. Following came the Commodore 64, totaled 17 million units sold, making it the best-selling single personal computer model of all time. Another such computer, the NEC PC-98, sold more than 18 million units.
Somewhat larger and more expensive systems (for example, running CP/M), or sometimes a home computer with additional interfaces and devices, although still low-cost compared with minicomputers and mainframes, were aimed at office and small business use, typically using "high resolution" monitors capable of at least 80 column text display, and often no graphical or color drawing capability.
Workstations were characterized by high-performance processors and graphics displays, with large local disk storage, networking capability, and running under a multitasking operating system.
Eventually, due to the influence of the IBM PC on the personal computer market, personal computers and home computers lost any technical distinction. Business computers acquired color graphics capability and sound, and home computers and game systems users used the same processors and operating systems as office workers. Mass-market computers had graphics capabilities and memory comparable to dedicated workstations of a few years before. Even local area networking, originally a way to allow business computers to share expensive mass storage and peripherals, became a standard feature of personal computers used at home.
In 1982 "The Computer" was named Machine of the Year by "Time" Magazine.
In the 2010s, several companies such as Hewlett-Packard and Sony sold off their PC and laptop divisions. As a result, the personal computer was declared dead several times during this time.
Market and sales.
In 2001, 125 million personal computers were shipped in comparison to 48,000 in 1977. More than 500 million personal computers were in use in 2002 and one billion personal computers had been sold worldwide from the mid-1970s up to this time. Of the latter figure, 75 percent were professional or work related, while the rest were sold for personal or home use. About 81.5 percent of personal computers shipped had been desktop computers, 16.4 percent laptops and 2.1 percent servers. The United States had received 38.8 percent (394 million) of the computers shipped, Europe 25 percent and 11.7 percent had gone to the Asia-Pacific region, the fastest-growing market as of 2002. The second billion was expected to be sold by 2008. Almost half of all the households in Western Europe had a personal computer and a computer could be found in 40 percent of homes in United Kingdom, compared with only 13 percent in 1985.
The global personal computer shipments were 350.9 million units in 2010,
308.3 million units in 2009
and 302.2 million units in 2008.
The shipments were 264 million units in the year 2007, according to iSuppli, up 11.2 percent from 239 million in 2006. In 2004, the global shipments were 183 million units, an 11.6 percent increase over 2003. In 2003, 152.6 million computers were shipped, at an estimated value of $175 billion. In 2002, 136.7 million PCs were shipped, at an estimated value of $175 billion. In 2000, 140.2 million personal computers were shipped, at an estimated value of $226 billion. Worldwide shipments of personal computers surpassed the 100-million mark in 1999, growing to 113.5 million units from 93.3 million units in 1998. In 1999, Asia had 14.1 million units shipped.
As of June 2008, the number of personal computers in use worldwide hit one billion, while another billion is expected to be reached by 2014. Mature markets like the United States, Western Europe and Japan accounted for 58 percent of the worldwide installed PCs. The emerging markets were expected to double their installed PCs by 2012 and to take 70 percent of the second billion PCs. About 180 million computers (16 percent of the existing installed base) were expected to be replaced and 35 million to be dumped into landfill in 2008. The whole installed base grew 12 percent annually.
Based on International Data Corporation (IDC) data for Q2 2011, for the first time China surpassed US in PC shipments by 18.5 million and 17.7 million respectively. This trend reflects the rising of emerging markets as well as the relative stagnation of mature regions.
In the developed world, there has been a vendor tradition to keep adding functions to maintain high prices of personal computers. However, since the introduction of the One Laptop per Child foundation and its low-cost XO-1 laptop, the computing industry started to pursue the price too. Although introduced only one year earlier, there were 14 million netbooks sold in 2008. Besides the regular computer manufacturers, companies making especially rugged versions of computers have sprung up, offering alternatives for people operating their machines in extreme weather or environments.
Deloitte consulting firm predicted that in 2011, smartphones and tablet computers as computing devices would surpass the PCs sales. As of 2013, worldwide sales of PCs had begun to fall as many consumers moved to tablets and smartphones for gifts and personal use. Sales of 90.3 million units in the 4th quarter of 2012 represented a 4.9% decline from sales in the 4th quarter of 2011. Global PC sales fell sharply in the first quarter of 2013, according to IDC data. The 14% year-over-year decline was the largest on record since the firm began tracking in 1994, and double what analysts had been expecting. The decline of Q2 2013 PC shipments marked the fifth straight quarter of falling sales. "This is horrific news for PCs," remarked an analyst. "It’s all about mobile computing now. We have definitely reached the tipping point." Data from Gartner Inc. showed a similar decline for the same time period. China's Lenovo Group bucked the general trend as strong sales to first time buyers in the developing world allowed the company's sales to stay flat overall. Windows 8, which was designed to look similar to tablet/smartphone software, was cited as a contributing factor in the decline of new PC sales. "Unfortunately, it seems clear that the Windows 8 launch not only didn’t provide a positive boost to the PC market, but appears to have slowed the market," said IDC Vice President Bob O’Donnell.
Analysts predict that 2013 personal computer sales will exceed 300 million worldwide, while tablet sales are expected to reach 200 million. In comparison, smartphone sales could exceed a billion units in 2013. In August 2013, Credit Suisse published research findings that attributed around 75 percent of the operating profit share of the PC industry to Microsoft (operating system) and Intel (semiconductors).
According to IDC, in 2013 PC shipments dropped by 9.8 percent as the greatest drop-ever in line with consumers trends to use mobile devices.
Average selling price.
Selling prices of personal computers, unlike other consumer commodities, steadily declined due to lower costs of production and manufacture. Capabilities of the computers also increased. In 1975, an Altair kit sold for only around US $400, but required customers to solder components into circuit boards; peripherals required to interact with the system in alphanumeric form instead of blinking lights would add another $2,000, and the resultant system was only of use to hobbyists.
At their introduction in 1981, the US $1,795 price of the Osborne 1 and its competitor Kaypro was considered an attractive price point; these systems had text-only displays and only floppy disks for storage. By 1982, Michael Dell observed that a personal computer system selling at retail for about $3,000 US was made of components that cost the dealer about $600; typical gross margin on a computer unit was around $1,000. The total value of personal computer purchases in the US in 1983 was about $4 billion, comparable to total sales of pet food. By late 1998, the average selling price of personal computer systems in the United States had dropped below $1,000.
For Microsoft Windows systems, the average selling price (ASP) showed a decline in 2008/2009, possibly due to low-cost netbooks, drawing $569 for desktop computers and $689 for laptops at U.S. retail in August 2008. In 2009, ASP had further fallen to $533 for desktops and to $602 for notebooks by January and to $540 and $560 in February. According to research firm NPD, the average selling price of all Windows portable PCs has fallen from $659 in October 2008 to $519 in October 2009.

Workstation.
[[File:SPARCstation 1.jpg|right|thumb|Sun SPARCstation
1+, 25 MHz RISC processor from early 1990s]]
A workstation is a high-end personal computer designed for technical, mathematical, or scientific applications. Intended primarily to be used by one person at a time, they are commonly connected to a local area network and run multi-user operating systems. Workstations are used for tasks such as computer-aided design, drafting and modeling, computation-intensive scientific and engineering calculations, image processing, architectural modeling, and computer graphics for animation and motion picture visual effects.
Desktop computer.
Prior to the wide spread usage of PCs, a computer that could fit on a desk was remarkably small. Today the phrase usually indicates a particular style of computer case. Desktop computers come in a variety of styles ranging from large vertical tower cases to small form factor models that can be tucked behind an LCD monitor. In this sense, the term 'desktop' refers specifically to a horizontally oriented case, usually intended to have the display screen placed on top to save space on the desk top. Most modern desktop computers have separate screens and keyboards.
Gaming computer.
A gaming computer is a standard desktop computer that typically has high-performance hardware, such as a more powerful video card, processor, and memory, in order to handle the requirements of demanding video games, or often just called pc games instead of video games on this platform. A number of companies, such as Alienware, manufacture prebuilt gaming computers, and companies such as Razer and Logitech market mice, keyboards and headsets geared towards gamers.
Single unit.
Single unit PCs (also known as all-in-one PCs) are a subtype of desktop computers, which combine the monitor and case of the computer within a single unit. The monitor often utilises a touchscreen as an optional method of user input, however detached keyboards and mice are normally still included. The inner components of the PC are often located directly behind the monitor and many are built similarly to laptops.
Nettop.
A subtype of desktops, called nettops, was introduced by Intel in February 2008 and are desktops characterized by low-cost and lean-functionality. A similar subtype of laptops (or notebooks) are the netbooks (see below). The product line features the new Intel Atom processor which specially enables them to consume less power and to be built into small enclosures.
Home theater PC.
A home theater PC (HTPC) is a convergence device that combines the functions of a personal computer and a digital video recorder. It is connected to a television or a television-sized computer display and is often used as a digital photo, music, video player, TV receiver and digital video recorder. Home theater PCs are also referred to as media center systems or media servers. The general goal in a HTPC is usually to combine many or all components of a home theater setup into one box. They can be purchased pre-configured with the required hardware and software needed to add television programming to the PC, or can be cobbled together out of discrete components as is commonly done with MythTV, Windows Media Center, GB-PVR, SageTV, Famulent or LinuxMCE. More recently, home theatre PCs have been given the ability to connect to services that play movies and TV shows on demand.
Portable.
Laptop.
A laptop computer or simply laptop, also called a notebook computer, is a small personal computer designed for portability. Usually all of the interface hardware needed to operate the laptop, such as USB ports (previously parallel and serial ports), graphics card, sound channel, etc., are built into a single unit. Laptops contain high capacity batteries that can power the device for extensive periods of time, enhancing portability. Once the battery charge is depleted, it will have to be recharged through a power outlet. In the interest of saving power, weight and space, they usually share RAM with the video channel, slowing their performance compared to an equivalent desktop machine. For this reason, Desktop or Gaming computers are generally preferred to laptop PCs for gaming purposes.
One main drawback of the laptop is sometimes, due to the size and configuration of components, relatively little can be done to upgrade the overall computer from its original design. Internal upgrades are either not manufacturer recommended, can damage the laptop if done with poor care or knowledge, or in some cases impossible, making the desktop PC more modular. Some internal upgrades, such as memory and hard disks upgrades are often easy, a display or keyboard upgrade is usually impossible. The laptop has the same access as the desktop to the wide variety of devices, such as external displays, mice, cameras, storage devices and keyboards, which may be attached externally through USB ports and other less common ports such as external video.
A subtype of notebooks, called subnotebooks, are computers with most of the features of a standard laptop computer but smaller. They are larger than hand-held computers, and usually run full versions of desktop/laptop operating systems. Ultra-Mobile PCs (UMPC) are usually considered subnotebooks, or more specifically, subnotebook Tablet PCs (see below). Netbooks are sometimes considered in this category, though they are sometimes separated in a category of their own (see below).
Desktop replacement.
A desktop replacement computer (DTR) is a personal computer that provides the full capabilities of a desktop computer while remaining mobile. They are often larger, bulkier laptops. Because of their increased size, this class of computer usually includes more powerful components and a larger display than generally used in smaller portable computers and can have a relatively limited battery capacity (or none at all). Some use a limited range of desktop components to provide better performance at the expense of battery life. These are sometimes called desknotes, a portmanteau of the words "desktop" and "notebook," though the term is also applied to desktop replacement computers in general.
Netbook.
Netbooks (also called mini notebooks or subnotebooks) were a rapidly evolving category of small, light and inexpensive laptop computers suited for general computing and accessing web-based applications; they are often marketed as "companion devices," that is, to augment a user's other computer access. Walt Mossberg called them a "relatively new category of small, light, minimalist and cheap laptops." By August 2009, CNET called netbooks "nothing more than smaller, cheaper notebooks.".
Initially, their primary defining characteristic was the lack of an optical disc drive, requiring it to be a separate and external device. This has become less important as flash memory devices have gradually increased in capacity, replacing the writable optical disc (e.g. CD-RW, DVD-RW) as a transportable storage medium.
At their inception in late 2007 — as smaller notebooks optimized for low weight and low cost — netbooks omitted key features (e.g., the optical drive), featured smaller screens and keyboards, and offered reduced specification and computing power. Over the course of their evolution, netbooks have ranged in size from below 5 in to over 13 in, and from (). Often significantly less expensive than other laptops, by mid-2009, netbooks had been offered to users "free of charge", with an extended service contract purchase of a cellular data plan.
In the short period since their appearance, netbooks have grown in size and features, now converging with new smaller, lighter notebooks. By mid-2009, CNET noted "the specs are so similar that the average shopper would likely be confused as to why one is better than the other," noting "the only conclusion is that there really is no distinction between the devices."
Tablet.
A tablet is a type of portable PC with a "slate" form factor. Tablets de-emphasize the use of traditional input devices (such as a mouse or keyboard) by using a touchscreen display, which can be controlled using either a stylus pen or finger. Some tablets may use a "hybrid" or "convertible" design, offering a keyboard that can either be removed as an attachment, or a screen which can be rotated and folded directly over top the keyboard. Some tablets may run a traditional PC operating system such as Windows or Linux; Microsoft attempted to enter the tablet market in 2002 with its Microsoft Tablet PC specifications, for tablets and convertible laptops running Windows XP. However, Microsoft's early attempts were overshadowed by the release of Apple's iPad; following in its footsteps, most modern tablets use slate designs and run mobile operating systems such as Android and iOS, giving them functionality similar to smartphones. In response, Microsoft built its Windows 8 operating system to better accommodate these new touch-oriented devices.
Ultra-mobile PC.
The ultra-mobile PC (UMPC) is a specification for a small form factor of tablet PCs. It was developed as a joint development exercise by Microsoft, Intel, and Samsung, among others. Current UMPCs typically feature the Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Linux operating system and low-voltage Intel Atom or VIA C7-M processors.
Pocket PC.
A pocket PC is a hardware specification for a handheld-sized computer (personal digital assistant) that runs the Microsoft Windows Mobile operating system. It may have the capability to run an alternative operating system like NetBSD or Linux. It has many of the capabilities of modern desktop PCs.
Currently there are tens of thousands of applications for handhelds adhering to the Microsoft Pocket PC specification, many of which are freeware. Some of these devices also include mobile phone features and thus actually represent a smartphone. Microsoft compliant Pocket PCs can also be used with many other add-ons like GPS receivers, barcode readers, RFID readers, and cameras. In 2007, with the release of Windows Mobile 6, Microsoft dropped the name Pocket PC in favor of a new naming scheme. Devices without an integrated phone are called Windows Mobile Classic instead of Pocket PC. Devices with an integrated phone and a touch screen are called Windows Mobile Professional.
Hardware.
[[File:Personal computer, exploded 6.svg|thumb|300px|An exploded view of a modern personal computer and peripherals:
Hardware is a comprehensive term for all of the physical parts of a computer, as distinguished from the data it contains or operates on, and the software that provides instructions for the hardware to accomplish tasks. The boundary between hardware and software is slightly blurry - firmware is software that is "built-in" to the hardware.
Mass-market consumer computers use highly standardized components and so are simple for an end user to assemble into a working system. A typical desktop computer consists of a computer case which holds the power supply, motherboard, hard disk and often an optical disc drive. External devices such as a computer monitor or visual display unit, keyboard, and a pointing device are usually found in a personal computer.
The motherboard connects all processor, memory and peripheral devices together. The RAM, graphics card and processor are mounted directly onto the motherboard. The central processing unit microprocessor chip plugs into a socket. Expansion memory plugs into memory sockets. Some motherboards have the video display adapter, sound and other peripherals integrated onto the motherboard, while others use expansion slots for graphics cards, network cards, or other I/O devices. The graphics card or sound card may employ a break out box to keep the analog parts away from the electromagnetic radiation inside the computer case. Disk drives for mass storage are connected to the mother board with a cable, and to the power supply through another cable. Usually disk drives are mounted in the same case as the motherboard; formerly, expansion chassis were made for additional disk storage. For really large amounts of data, a tape drive can be used or extra hard disks can be put together in an external case.
The keyboard and the mouse are external devices plugged into the computer through connectors on an I/O panel on the back of the computer. The monitor is also connected to the I/O panel, either through an onboard port on the motherboard, or a port on the graphics card.
The hardware capabilities of personal computers can sometimes be extended by the addition of expansion cards connected via an expansion bus. Some standard peripheral buses often used for adding expansion cards in personal computers as of 2005 are PCI, AGP (a high-speed PCI bus dedicated to graphics adapters), and PCI Express. Most personal computers as of 2005 have multiple physical PCI expansion slots. Many also include an AGP bus and expansion slot or a PCI Express bus and one or more expansion slots, but few PCs contain both buses.
Computer case.
A computer case is the enclosure that contains the main components of a computer. Cases are usually constructed from steel or aluminum, although other materials such as wood and plastic have been used. Cases can come in many different sizes, or "form factors". The size and shape of a computer case is usually determined by the form factor of the motherboard that it is designed to accommodate, since this is the largest and most central component of most computers. Consequently, personal computer form factors typically specify only the "internal" dimensions and layout of the case. Form factors for rack-mounted and blade servers may include precise "external" dimensions as well, since these cases must themselves fit in specific enclosures.
Currently, the most popular form factor for desktop computers is ATX, although microATX and small form factors have become very popular for a variety of uses. Companies like Shuttle Inc. and AOpen have popularized small cases, for which FlexATX is the most common motherboard size.
Power supply unit.
The power supply unit converts general purpose electric current from the mains to direct current for the other components of the computer. The rated output capacity will be about 40% greater than the calculated system power consumption needs obtained by adding up all the system components. This protects against overloading the supply, and guards against performance degradation.
Processor.
The central processing unit, or CPU, is that part of a computer which executes software program instructions. In newer PCs the CPU is about a million transistors in one integrated circuit chip called the microprocessor. The microprocessor plugs into the motherboard. The chip generates so much heat that the PC builder is required to attach a special cooling device to its surface. Modern CPUs are equipped with a fan attached via heat sink.
IBM PC compatible computers use an x86-compatible microprocessor. Intel, AMD, VIA Technologies or Transmeta manufacture them. Apple Macintosh computers were initially built with the Motorola 680x0 family of processors, then switched to the PowerPC series. In 2006 they switched to x86-compatible processors by Intel.
Motherboard.
The motherboard, also referred to as "system board" or "main board", is the primary circuit board within a personal computer. Other major system components plug directly onto or cable into the motherboard. A motherboard will contain a microprocessor, the CPU supporting circuitry (mostly integrated circuits) that provide the interface between memory and input/output peripheral circuits, main memory, and facilities for initial setup of the computer immediately after power-on (often called boot firmware or, in IBM PC compatible computers, a BIOS). In many portable and embedded personal computers, the motherboard houses nearly all of the PC's core components. Often a motherboard will also contain one or more peripheral buses and physical connectors for expansion purposes. Sometimes a secondary daughter board is connected to the motherboard to provide further expandability or to satisfy space constraints.
Main memory.
A PC's main memory is a fast storage device that is directly accessible by the CPU, and is used to store the currently executing program and immediately needed data. PCs use semiconductor random access memory (RAM) of various kinds such as DRAM, SDRAM or SRAM as their primary storage. Which exact kind depends on cost/performance issues at any particular time. Main memory is much faster than mass storage devices like hard disks or optical discs, but is usually volatile, meaning it does not retain its contents (instructions or data) in the absence of power, and is much more expensive for a given capacity than is most mass storage. Main memory is generally not suitable for long-term or archival data storage.
Hard disk.
Mass storage devices store programs and data even when the power is off; they do require power to perform read and write functions during usage. Although flash memory has dropped in cost, the prevailing form of mass storage in personal computers is still the hard disk.
The disk drives use a sealed head/disk assembly (HDA) which was first introduced by IBM's "Winchester" disk system. The use of a sealed assembly allowed the use of positive air pressure to drive out particles from the surface of the disk, which improves reliability.
If the mass storage controller provides for expandability, a PC may also be upgraded by the addition of extra hard disk or optical disc drives. For example, BD-ROMs, DVD-RWs, and various optical disc recorders may all be added by the user to certain PCs. Standard internal storage device connection interfaces are PATA, Serial ATA, and SCSI.
Solid state drives or SSD has begun replacing traditional mechanical hard drives.
Visual display unit.
A visual display unit, or "computer monitor", or just "display", is a piece of electrical equipment, usually separate from the computer case, which displays visual images without producing a permanent computer record. A display device is usually either a CRT or some form of flat panel such as a TFT LCD.
The display unit houses the circuitry that generates its picture from signals sent from the computer. Within the computer, either integral to the motherboard, or plugged into it as an Expansion card, there is pre-processing circuitry to convert the microprocessor's output data to a format compatible with the display unit's circuitry.
The images from computer monitors originally contained only text, but as graphical user interfaces emerged and became common, they began to display more images and multimedia content.
The term "monitor" is also used, particularly by technicians in broadcasting television, where a picture of the broadcast data is displayed to a highly standardized reference monitor for confidence checking purposes.
Video card.
The video cardotherwise called a graphics card, graphics adapter or video adapterprocesses the graphics output from the motherboard and transmits it to the display. It is an essential part of modern multimedia computing.
On older models, and today on budget models, graphics circuitry may be integrated with the motherboard, but for modern and flexible machines, they are connected by the PCI, AGP, or PCI Express interface.
When the IBM PC was introduced, most existing business-oriented personal computers used text-only display adapters and had no graphics capability. Home computers at that time had graphics compatible with television signals, but with low resolution by modern standards owing to the limited memory available to the eight-bit processors available at the time.
Keyboard.
In computing, a keyboard is an arrangement of buttons that each correspond to a function, letter, or number. They are the primary devices of inputting text. In most cases, they contain an array of keys specifically organized with the corresponding letters, numbers, and functions printed or engraved on the button. They are generally designed around an operators language, and many different versions for different languages exist.
In English, the most common layout is the QWERTY layout, which was originally used in typewriters. They have evolved over time, and have been modified for use in computers with the addition of function keys, number keys, arrow keys, and OS specific keys. Often, specific functions can be achieved by pressing multiple keys at once or in succession, such as inputting characters with accents or opening a task manager. Programs use keyboard shortcuts very differently and all use different keyboard shortcuts for different program specific operations, such as refreshing a web page in a web browser or selecting all text in a word processor.
Mouse.
A Mouse on a computer is a small, slideable device that users hold and slide around to point at, click on, and sometimes drag objects on screen in a graphical user interface using a pointer on screen. Almost all Personal Computers have mice. It may be plugged into a computer's rear mouse socket, or as a USB device, or, more recently, may be connected wirelessly via a USB antenna or Bluetooth antenna. In the past, they had a single button that users could press down on the device to "click" on whatever the pointer on the screen was hovering over. Now, however, many Mice have two or three buttons(possibly "more"); a "right click" function button on the mouse, which performs a secondary action on a selected object, and a scroll wheel, which users can rotate using their fingers to "scroll" up or down. The scroll wheel can also be pressed down, and therefore be used as a third button. Some mouse wheels may be "tilted" from side to side to allow sideways scrolling. Different programs make use of these functions differently, and may scroll horizontally by default with the scroll wheel, open different menus with different buttons, among others. These functions may be user defined through software utilities.
Mice traditionally detected movement and communicated with the computer with an internal "mouse ball"; and used optical encoders to detect rotation of the ball and tell the computer where the mouse has moved. However, these systems were subject to low durability, accuracy and required internal cleaning. Modern mice use optical technology to directly trace movement of the surface under the mouse and are much more accurate, durable and almost maintenance free. They work on a wider variety of surfaces and can even operate on walls, ceilings or other non-horizontal surfaces.
Other components.
All computers require either fixed or removable storage for their operating system, programs and user generated material.
Formerly the 5¼ inch and 3½ inch floppy drive were the principal forms of removable storage for backup of user files and distribution of software.
As memory sizes increased, the capacity of the floppy did not keep pace; the Zip drive and other higher-capacity removable media were introduced but never became as prevalent as the floppy drive.
By the late 1990s the optical drive, in CD and later DVD and Blu-ray Disc, became the main method for software distribution, and writeable media provided backup and file interchange. Floppy drives have become uncommon in desktop personal computers since about 2000, and were dropped from many laptop systems even earlier.
Early home computers used compact audio cassettes for file storage; these were at the time a very low cost storage solution, but were displaced by floppy disk drives when manufacturing costs dropped, by the mid-1980s.
A second generation of tape recorders was provided when Videocassette recorders were pressed into service as backup media for larger disk drives. All these systems were less reliable and slower than purpose-built magnetic tape drives. Such tape drives were uncommon in consumer-type personal computers but were a necessity in business or industrial use.
Interchange of data such as photographs from digital cameras is greatly expedited by installation of a card reader, which often is compatible with several forms of flash memory. It is usually faster and more convenient to move large amounts of data by removing the card from the mobile device, instead of communicating with the mobile device through a USB interface.
A USB flash drive today performs much of the data transfer and backup functions formerly done with floppy drives, Zip disks and other devices. Main-stream current operating systems for personal computers provide standard support for flash drives, allowing interchange even between computers using different processors and operating systems. The compact size and lack of moving parts or dirt-sensitive media, combined with low cost for high capacity, have made flash drives a popular and useful accessory for any personal computer user.
The operating system (e.g.: Microsoft Windows, Mac OS, Linux or many others) can be located on any storage, but typically it is on a hard disks. A Live CD is the running of an OS directly from a CD. While this is slow compared to storing the OS on a hard drive, it is typically used for installation of operating systems, demonstrations, system recovery, or other special purposes. Large flash memory is currently more expensive than hard drives of similar size (as of mid-2008) but are starting to appear in laptop computers because of their low weight, small size and low power requirements.
Toxicity.
Toxic chemicals found in computer hardware include lead, mercury, cadmium, chromium, plastic (PVC), and barium. A computer is about 17% lead, copper, zinc, mercury, and cadmium; 23% is plastic, 14% is aluminum, and 20% is iron.
Lead is found in a cathode ray tube (CRT) display, and on all of the printed circuit boards and most expansion cards. Mercury is located in the screen's fluorescent lamp, in the laser light generators in the optical disk drive, and in the round, silver batteries on the motherboard. Plastic found mostly in the housing of the computation and display circuitry.
While daily end-users are not exposed to these toxic elements, the danger arises during the computer recycling process, which involves manually breaking down hardware, which leads to the exposure of a measurable amount of lead or mercury. A measurable amount of lead or mercury can easily cause serious brain damage or ruin drinking water supplies. Computer recycling is best handled by the electronic waste (e-Waste) industry, and kept segregated from the general community dump.
Software.
Computer software is any kind of computer program, procedure, or documentation that performs some task on a computer system.
The term includes application software such as word processors which perform productive tasks for users, system software such as operating systems, which interface with computer hardware to provide the necessary services for application software, and middleware which controls and co-ordinates distributed systems.
Software applications for word processing, Internet browsing, Internet faxing, e-mail and other digital messaging, multimedia playback, computer game play and computer programming are common. The user of a modern personal computer may have significant knowledge of the operating environment and application programs, but is not necessarily interested in programming nor even able to write programs for the computer. Therefore, most software written primarily for personal computers tends to be designed with simplicity of use, or "user-friendliness" in mind. However, the software industry continuously provide a wide range of new products for use in personal computers, targeted at both the expert and the non-expert user.
Operating system.
An operating system (OS) manages computer resources and provides programmers with an interface used to access those resources. An operating system processes system data and user input, and responds by allocating and managing tasks and internal system resources as a service to users and programs of the system. An operating system performs basic tasks such as controlling and allocating memory, prioritizing system requests, controlling input and output devices, facilitating computer networking and managing files.
Common contemporary desktop OSs are Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, Solaris and FreeBSD. Windows, OS X, and Linux all have server and personal variants. With the exception of Microsoft Windows, the designs of each of the aforementioned OSs were inspired by, or directly inherited from, the Unix operating system. Unix was developed at Bell Labs beginning in the late 1960s and spawned the development of numerous free and proprietary operating systems.
Microsoft Windows.
Microsoft Windows is the collective brand name of several software operating systems by Microsoft. Microsoft first introduced an operating environment named "Windows" in November 1985 as an add-on to MS-DOS in response to the growing interest in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) generated by Apple's 1984 introduction of the Macintosh. The most recent client and server version of Windows are Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, respectively, which have been available at retail since 26 October 2012.
Under this family of operating system, this includes Windows XP, Vista. 7 and 8 and also their server OS equivalent.
OS X.
OS X (formerly Mac OS X) is a line of operating systems developed, marketed, and sold by Apple Inc.. OS X is the successor to the original Mac OS, which had been Apple's primary operating system since 1984. OS X is a Unix-based graphical operating system and Snow Leopard, Leopard, Lion, Mountain Lion, and the new Mavericks are version titles. The most recent version of OS X is entitled OS X Mavericks.
AmigaOS.
AmigaOS is the default native operating system of the Amiga personal computer. It was developed first by Commodore International, and initially introduced in 1985 with the Amiga 1000. Early versions (1.0-3.9) run on the Motorola 68k series of 16-bit and 32-bit microprocessors, while the newer AmigaOS 4 runs only on PowerPC microprocessors.
On top of a preemptive multitasking kernel called Exec, it includes an abstraction of the Amiga's unique hardware, a disk operating system called AmigaDOS, a windowing system API called Intuition and a graphical user interface called Workbench. A command line interface called AmigaShell is also available and integrated into the system. The GUI and the CLI complement each other and share the same privileges.
The current holder of the Amiga intellectual properties is Amiga Inc. They oversaw the development of AmigaOS 4 but did not develop it themselves, contracting it instead to Hyperion Entertainment. On 20 December 2006, Amiga Inc terminated Hyperion's license to continue development of AmigaOS 4. However, in 30 September 2009, Hyperion was granted an exclusive, perpetual, worldwide right to AmigaOS 3.1 in order to use, develop, modify, commercialize, distribute and market AmigaOS 4.x and subsequent versions of AmigaOS (including AmigaOS 5).
Linux.
Linux is a family of Unix-like computer operating systems. Linux is one of the most prominent examples of free software and open source development: typically all underlying source code can be freely modified, used, and redistributed by anyone. The name "Linux" comes from the Linux kernel, started in 1991 by Linus Torvalds. The system's utilities and libraries usually come from the GNU operating system, announced in 1983 by Richard Stallman. The GNU contribution is the basis for the alternative name GNU+Linux.
Known for its use in servers as part of the LAMP application stack, Linux is supported by corporations such as Dell, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Novell, Oracle Corporation, Red Hat, Canonical Ltd. and Sun Microsystems. It is used as an operating system for a wide variety of computer hardware, including desktop computers, netbooks, supercomputers, video game systems, such as the PlayStation 3 (until this option was removed remotely by Sony in 2010), several arcade games, and embedded devices such as mobile phones, portable media players, routers, and stage lighting systems.
Applications.
A computer user will apply application software to carry out a specific task. System software supports applications and provides common services such as memory management, network connectivity, or device drivers; all of which may be used by applications but which are not directly of interest to the end user. A simple, if imperfect analogy in the world of hardware would be the relationship of an electric light bulb (an application) to an electric power generation plant (a system). The power plant merely generates electricity, not itself of any real use until harnessed to an application like the electric light that performs a service that benefits the user.
Typical examples of software applications are word processors, spreadsheets, and media players. Multiple applications bundled together as a package are sometimes referred to as an "application suite". Microsoft Office and OpenOffice.org, which bundle together a word processor, a spreadsheet, and several other discrete applications, are typical examples. The separate applications in a suite usually have a user interface that has some commonality making it easier for the user to learn and use each application. And often they may have some capability to interact with each other in ways beneficial to the user. For example, a spreadsheet might be able to be embedded in a word processor document even though it had been created in the separate spreadsheet application.
End-user development tailors systems to meet the user's specific needs. User-written software include spreadsheet templates, word processor macros, scientific simulations, graphics and animation scripts. Even email filters are a kind of user software. Users create this software themselves and often overlook how important it is.
Electronic waste.
Personal computers can become a large contributor to the 50 million tons of waste of discarded electronic goods that is being generated annually, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. To solve the electronic waste issue affecting developing countries and the environment, an Extended producer responsibility act was implemented. Organizations, such as the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition, Basel Action Network, Toxics Link India, SCOPE, and Greenpeace contribute to the strategy. The Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition and BAN (Basel Action Network) teamed up with 32 electronic recyclers in the US and Canada to create an e-steward program due to the lack of national legislation and regulation for the exporting and importing of electronic waste. The creation of an e-steward program created another option for manufacturers and customers to dispose of their electronic waste properly. The Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition founded the Electronics TakeBack Coalition, which is a coalition that advocates for the production of environmentally friendly products. The TakeBack Coalition works with policy makers, recyclers, and smart businesses to get manufacturers to take full responsibility of their products. There are organizations opposing EPR, such as the Reason Foundation opposes the EPR for two main reasons. The first reason is that the EPR relies on the idea that if the manufacturers pay for the harm they do to the environment, they will learn their lesson. The second reason is that the EPR assumes the current design practices are environmentally inefficient. The Reason Foundation claims that manufacturers are moving toward reduced material use and energy use instead.

Bavarian B VII

The Bavarian B VII was an experimental locomotive with the Royal Bavarian State Railways ("Königlich Bayerische Staatsbahn").
These turf-fired locomotives were the first ones delivered by Krauss to the state railways in Bavaria. They resembled the 0-4-0 vehicles of the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg State Railways ("Großherzoglich Oldenburgische Staatseisenbahnen"). They were equipped with a water tank frame and Allan valve gear with outside cylinders. They were rebuilt once during its short career, the boiler overpressure being changed. The locomotives, known as the "Angry Seven" ("Böse Sieben") by crews, were retired in 1877 after just 9 years in service.
They were equipped with tenders of the Bavarian class 3 T 6.7.

Singularity (video game)

Singularity is a video game developed by Raven Software and published by Activision and released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. "Singularity" is Raven Software's third title based on Epic Games' Unreal Engine 3. The title was announced at Activision's E3 2008 press conference.
Plot.
The game begins when an electromagnetic surge from an uninhabited island called Katorga-12, once held by the Soviet Union, damages an American spy satellite. A group of American soldiers, which includes the protagonist, Captain Nathaniel Renko, goes to investigate, when another surge disables their helicopter. After they crash land on Katorga-12, Renko begins to phase between the present and 1955, the date of a catastrophic accident on the island. He arrives in 1955 in time to save a scientist named Nikolai Demichev from dying in a fire. As he rescues Demichev, a man tries to warn Renko not to save him; the man is then killed in the fire.
Back in the present, Renko discovers that Demichev has taken over the world. He is captured by Demichev's soldiers, but is rescued by Katheryn, a member of a resistance group called Mir-12. Based on a journal they found on Katorga-12, they believe that Renko can put an end to Demichev's reign using a time manipulation device called the TMD, developed by Victor Barisov. Barisov was killed by Demichev long ago, so Renko uses the TMD to save Barisov.
Back in the present, Renko and Barisov determine that they can set history right by returning to 1955 and destroying Katorga-12 with a bomb made from Element-99, the material that caused the catastrophic accident in 1955. Renko and Katheryn manage to find such a bomb, but Katheryn is lost as they retrieve it. They use the bomb to destroy the island, and thus, the research facility that Demichev used to become so powerful.
Back in the present, Renko finds Demichev holding Barisov at gunpoint. Demichev reveals that he rebuilt the facility after it was destroyed, so that history remained unchanged. Barisov realizes that it was Demichev's rescue that changed history, so he asks Renko to go back and stop his past self from saving Demichev. Demichev, in turn offers Renko a place in his empire in exchange for the TMD. He also points out that Barisov's plan has failed before – the mysterious man who told Renko not to save Demichev in 1955 was Renko himself.
At this point, the player has a choice. If Renko shoots Demichev, he goes back in time to stop himself from saving Demichev in the first place. In order to do so, he decides to kill his past self. In the epilogue, it is implied that Barisov recovered the TMD and used it to conquer the world himself. If Renko instead shoots Barisov, he and Demichev rule the world together. After some time, Demichev begins to fear Renko's growing power, and a cold war develops between the lands ruled by Renko and those ruled by Demichev. If Renko shoots both Demichev and Barisov, Renko allows the world to fall into chaos. Later, he rises up as a new world leader, using the TMD to assert his power.
A scene then shows a wounded Katheryn, pulled into 1955 by a time distortion, writing the Mir-12 journal which will later be used to track down Renko.
Gameplay.
"Singularity" is a first-person shooter with survival-horror elements. A main gameplay device is an artifact known as the Time Manipulation Device (TMD). The TMD is powered by an E-99 core, and can manipulate time. The TMD can move an object backwards or forwards in time, attract something and hold it indefinitely, or send a pulse of energy that can stun or kill enemies. The TMD can only affect living beings or objects that have been in contact with E-99 (supposedly, almost everything on Katorga-12 is imbued with the element, but in practice, the TMD can only affect a limited set of objects). Some living beings, like the Spetsnaz troops who are covered in heavy armor designed to repel E-99, are immune as well.
The TMD can be used in conjunction with special power stations scattered across the island that greatly amplify its power. In some instances, the player can use this to restore ruined bridges or wrecked ships in order to progress.
Multiplayer.
There are two multiplayer modes. Both modes have the players fighting as either the soldiers or creatures, with each side having their own classes and abilities. One mode, simply called "Creatures vs. Soldiers", is a simple team deathmatch style game, while the other mode, called "Extermination", has the soldiers trying to take control of various beacons on the map, with the creatures tasked with defending said beacons to prevent eradication. Once the time runs out, or the soldiers capture all the beacons, the players switch roles.
Development.
The game's concept was based on Brian and Steve Raffel's memories of the Cold War era and exploration of old abandoned buildings including a WW2 military base in the vicinity of Madison, Wisconsin.
Some aspects of the game, especially the 1950s sections were inspired by pulp sci-fi movies.
Reception.
"Singularity" received generally favorable reviews. On review aggregator website Metacritic, "Singularity" received a rating of 76 for the PC and Xbox 360 versions, and 77 for the PlayStation 3 version. On GameRankings, the PC version received 78%, the PlayStation 3 version 79%, and the Xbox 360 version 77%. Activision was disappointed with "Singularity"s sales, which came out under 400,000.
Destructoid sang the game's praises, stating that: ""Singularity" is a game that manages to feel like its own thing despite being pieced together from previous FPS games, and if you want a great Summer shooter full of violent toys and silly super powers, then you won't get much better than this. Quite possibly the best new FPS of the year so far".
IGN was not so enthusiastic, and said that while "the gunplay is solid and there are a few memorable set pieces", the game is "ultimately limited by a lack of imagination where a neat time-manipulation idea is handcuffed to a by-the-numbers first-person shooter".
Some reviewers criticized the game for similarities to other games, such as "BioShock". Leon Thomas of the show "Heart Of Gaming" (showcased on Blistered Thumbs) said he preferred the game over "BioShock", saying it had a better ending, better weapons, harder puzzles, more enjoyable gameplay, and a better morality system.

Grand Duchy of Oldenburg State Railways

The Grand Duchy of Oldenburg Railway ("Großherzoglich Oldenburgische Eisenbahn or GOE") was the railway company that was run as a state railway for the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg ("Großherzogtum Oldenburg"), part of the German Empire.
Compared with the other states in the German Empire, Oldenburg's first railway line arrived relatively late. In this sparsely populated and economically poor area, the construction of railways appeared for a long while to be unsustainable due to the financial costs. In addition, the various ideas of its neighboring states, Hanover and Prussia prevented railway projects from coming to fruition for a long time.
Finally in 1864 a treaty was agreed between Prussia and Oldenburg over the construction of a railway line from Bremen to Oldenburg. At the same time Prussia committed itself to building a railway line from Heppens – later Wilhelmshaven – to Oldenburg (the Wilhelmshaven–Oldenburg line). The Grand Ducal Railway Commission, set up in 1864, was transferred on 1 April 1867, to the Grand Ducal Railway Division of Oldenburg. 
On 17 November 1866, the first section of the route Oldenburg–Delmenhorst was opened; in July 1867 its extension to Bremen followed, and in September of the same year the section from Oldenburg to Heppens was finally completed.
In 1869 the east-west line from Bremen to Oldenburg was extended to what was then Prussian Leer in East Frisia by a line from Oldenburg to Leer with a junction to the Hanoverian Western Railway and, in 1876 by the section from Ihrhove to Nieuweschans with a junction to the Dutch Railways. 
In 1871 the town of Jever was linked via Sande (part of the East Frisian Coastal Railway); Brake received a railway connexion in 1873 and Nordenham in 1875. The Grand Duchy of Oldenburg gained an important link to the south in 1876 with the so-called "Southern Railway" from Oldenburg via Quakenbrück as far as Eversburg on the Osnabrück–Rheine line.
In 1897 the route from Jever to the harbour at Harle, opened in 1888 as the Jever–Carolinensiel railway, was finally taken over by the GOE. At the same time boat services to Wangerooge were started and a narrow gauge railway, the Wangerooge Island Railway laid from the jetty to the town.
In 1920 the GOE was merged into the newly founded Deutsche Reichsbahn. The Oldenburg staff were transferred to the Reichsbahn divisions of Hannover, Hamburg und Münster/Westfalia after the disbandment of the railway division in Oldenburg town. In 1935 a monument was erected in Münster for the former Oldenburg railwaymen.
