Bavarian G 4/5 N

The Bavarian Class G 4/5 N was an early German steam locomotive built for the Royal Bavarian State Railways (K.Bay.Sts.B.). Its design was based on that of the Class E I and it had unmistakable similarities to the final series of that class. Had the K.Bay.Sts.B. not changed their locomotive classification system just before this engine was produced it may well have entered service as the latest variant of E I. 
In developing the E I and G 4/5 N, advantage was taken of the knowledge gained from two goods locomotives bought from the USA and which were also classified as E I's. 
The firm of Krauss supplied seven of these locomotives in 1905 and 1906. As a result of the relatively high position of the boiler, the firebox was located above the locomotive frame. This characteristic design feature of Bavarian locomotives, influenced by Maffei, could already be seen and was utilised subsequently by the Baden VIIIe, Schweitzer C 4/5 and eventually the Bavarian G 4/5 H - albeit the latter being developed by Maffei. 
The Deutsche Reichsbahn took over four examples from the Bavarian State Railways, which had survived World War I and gave them the operating numbers 56 401–404. They continued in service until 1927.
The engines were equipped with a Bavarian 2'2' T 18,2 tender.

Leeman is a small coastal town in the Shire of Coorow. 
Land was first surveyed and sub-divided in 1961 and the townsite was gazetted in 1961 as Snag Island, a name that is still in common use. Snag Island is a rocky island a small distance off-shore from the town.
The town was named after Abraham Leeman, a Dutch sailor, who visited the area in 1658 in search of the wreckage of the "Gilt Dragon" that was lost two years earlier. Leeman was in charge of the shore party to conduct a search and was abandoned when a storm blew in. Leeman and his crew then took a six-month open boat voyage to Batavia.
In 1971 the Western Australian Education department opened the Leeman Primary School, and the town adopted the new name.

St Martin Pomary was a parish church in the Cheap ward of the City of London. It was also known as St Martin Ironmonger Lane.
Location.
The church stood on the east side of Ironmonger Lane in the Cheap ward of the City of London. John Stow suggested that the name "Pomary" indicated that apple trees had once grown near the church.The patronage of the church belonged to the prior and canons of St Bartholomew the Great, until the dissolution of the priory, when it passed to the Crown.
In 1627 much of the north wall had to be rebuilt, and two years later the whole church was "repaired and beautified" at the cost of the parishioners.The church was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666 and not rebuilt. Instead the parish was united with that of St Olave Jewry and the site of the church retained as a burial ground.

Erik Viborg

Erik Nissen Viborg (April 5, 1759 - September 25, 1822) was a Danish veterinarian and botanist. 
Viborg studied veterinary science by P.C. Abildgaard at the Veterinary School in Copenhagen and soon became the professor’s assistant (in 1783). 
From 1784 to 1787, Viborg travelled in Europe. After his return, he won a prize from the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters for his thesis about the ‘sand plants’ (mainly Marram grass) and their use as sand-binders in protection of agricultural lands from aeolian sand. He was then appointed teacher (with the title of professor) at the Veterinary School (1787–1790). In 1796, the king sent Viborg to Poland and Romania to purchase stallions for the Frederiksborg stud farm. When the chair of botany was installed in 1797 at the University of Copenhagen, Viborg became its first holder, surpassing Martin Vahl. This was probably achieved more through ties to the upper circles than through scientific merit. After the death of Abildgaard in 1801, Viborg became professor and rector of the Veterinary School –a position he held to his death. In 1816, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.
The legume genus "Wiborgia" Thunb. was named for him.

<doc id="18417846" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18417846" title="The Parson's Wedding">
The Parson's Wedding

"The Parson's Wedding" is a Caroline era stage play, a comedy written by Thomas Killigrew. Often regarded as the author's best play, the drama has sometimes been considered an anticipation of Restoration comedy, written a generation before the Restoration; "its general tone foreshadows the comedy of the Restoration from which the play is in many respects indistinguishable."
Date and performance.
Firm evidence for the play's date of authorship is lacking. Scholars have generally dated the play to c. 1637 or to the 1639–41 period. The play was allegedly composed in Basel in Switzerland. Killigrew may have been in the city in December and January in the winter of 1635–36, and perhaps began to draft the play at that time. Yet Killigrew apparently was also in Switzerland, in Geneva and Basel, in March 1640, and in Switzerland again in April 1641.
The play was performed in 1641, by the King's Men, in the Blackfriars Theatre. In Act V, Scene i, Killigrew refers to Joseph Taylor, the long-time leading man of that company; here, Killigrew is imitating Ben Jonson, who played the same trick of reference in his "The Devil is an Ass" (1616). In that play, Jonson mentions Richard Robinson, a King's Man actor who was cast of the play in which he's mentioned.
Sources.
Killigrew based his play, loosely, on the Spanish drama "La Dama Duende" ("The Phantom Lady") by Pedro Calderón de la Barca. Some critics have also noted resemblances with Shackerley Marmion's "The Antiquary" (c. 1635) and Lording Barry's "Ram Alley" (c. 1607).
In the text of his play, Killigrew inserted prose paraphrases of poems by John Donne. Speeches in II,i borrow from Donne's "A Lecture Upon the Shadow" and "Breake of Day," while a speech in IV,i is indebted to "Loves Alchymie." "Killigrew probably intended his audience to catch the borrowings as part of an added level of wit."
Publication.
"The Parson's Wedding" did not appear in print until the collected edition of Killigrew's dramas, "Comedies and Tragedies", was published by Henry Herringman in 1664. In that volume, each of the plays is identified with the European city in which Killigrew wrote the given work, mainly during his periods of foreign travel; and the collected edition assigns "The Parson's Wedding" to Basel.
It is an open question as to how much of the 1664 text of "The Parson's Wedding" represents the original Caroline-era work, and how much is the result of later revision. The play's apparent anticipation of Restoration drama may be, to some significant degree, an illusion inspired by post-1660 revision.
The play was dedicated to "Lady Ursula Bartu, Widow."
Sexuality and religion.
The bawdy tone of the play, notably different from Killigrew's earlier tragicomedies "The Prisoners" and "Claricilla" and "The Princess", may have been a reaction to the highly artificial cult of Platonic love favoured at the Caroline era court of Queen Henrietta Maria. "The Shepherd's Paradise". Biographers have also speculated that the play's dark outlook on sexuality and marriage may have been part of Killigrew's reaction to the 1638 death of his first wife, Celia Crofts.
Many plays in English Renaissance drama exploit bawdy humour and risqué subject matter; but they normally maintain at least a formal commitment to the established morality of the social order. "Westward Ho" and "Northward Ho", two early Jacobean comedies by Thomas Dekker and John Webster, and the city comedies of Thomas Middleton, provide good examples of this tendency, as do many other dramas of the era. In "The Parson's Wedding", Killigrew abandons even a lip-service acceptance of socially-approved morality; he is overtly and even gleefully cynical about the moral claims and sexual mores of society – especially in regard to marriage.
The two characters in the play who come closest to representing the established order, Lady Loveall and the Parson, are the biggest hypocrites, and fare the worst. Without being heavy-handed, Killigrew expresses the hostility toward the Puritans that is typical of the drama of the age. The minor character Crop is a Brownist who is given rough treatment; and the thoroughly-humiliated Parson is compared to leading Presbyterian divines like Stephen Marshall.
"Dramatis personae".
The "Dramatis personae" of the 1664 edition:
Bawds, Servants, Drawers, Fiddlers.
The plot.
The play opens on a heated conversation between the Captain and his paramour, Mistress Wanton. (In the seventeenth century, the title "Mistress," or "Mrs.," was applied to both married and single women; Wanton is single, beautiful, clever, and highly desirable.) The Captain is "in choler," angry at the conduct of his erstwhile friend the Parson. In past periods of poverty, the Parson was a humble acquaintance of the Captain and Wanton; but now that he has obtained a comfortable clerical benefice (a "fat living") through the patronage of Lady Loveall, the Parson looks down on his old friends. When Wanton reveals that the Parson once proposed marriage to her, the Captain is struck with an inspiration: they will arrange a marriage between the Parson and Wanton, as a way of working their revenge.
When the Parson enters, the Captain attacks him with lush and imaginative verbal abuse. The Parson responds in kind. Wanton takes the Parson's side in the argument, and the Captain pretends to storm off. The Parson impulsively renews his suit for Wanton's hand in marriage.
The following scenes introduce a profusion of other characters. The main players are:
Most of the play is devoted to repartee among these characters. While the play contains some physical humour (in a scene in mid-play, Crop the Brownist is abused and ejected from London's Devil Tavern), it is dominated by verbal wit. The characters converse, quarrel, and flirt with each other, scheme with and manipulate each other, between eating and drinking. A small sample can be extracted from II,vii:
The Captain's plot against the Parson comes to fruition when the Parson goes to bed drunk; the plotters slip the elderly Bawd into his bed in place of Wanton, then burst in disguised as watchmen and constables. They drag him before a supposed Justice of the Peace (actually Mr. Wild in disguise). The Parson confronts social and professional ruin for his apparent sexual misconduct; even when the trick is revealed, he risks profound embarrassment over its possible exposure. The frightened Parson is cowed into the status of a wittol, a complaisant cuckold, as Wanton pursues her erotic adventures; he even joins in some of the further schemes of his tricksters.
Constant and Sad work their own scheme to trap Lady Wild and Mrs. Pleasant into matrimony; they exclude the two women from the Lady's own house by pretending that her coachman has died of the plague. (Killigrew's humour is bold enough to use bubonic plague as a casual element in his comedy.) The two women find refuge in the house of the Lady's nephew, Mr. Wild. Masters Careless and Wild work their own trick on the women, spreading the rumour that their marriages have already taken place and arranging appearances to that effect. To avoid public shame, the two women accept the two men as their husbands – marriages which are appropriate in the social world of the play. The Parson performs the ceremony that unites Mr. Careless with Lady Wild, and Mr. Wild with Mrs. Pleasant. (And Mrs. Wanton goes off with Mr. Jolly.)
This long prose play (it must have been cut significantly for stage performance) includes a range of noteworthy features. The character Faithful, who runs a charity hospital for the sufferers of sexually transmitted diseases, is one striking example.
Epilogue.
In the Epilogue to his play, Killigrew makes two references to his lack of formal education. He describes himself as "the illiterate Courtier who made this Play," and as "one that can scarce read, nay, not his own hand." This was an exaggeration; Killigrew was adopting the fashionable pose of the courtly amateur who lacks formal training.
Restoration productions.
In the 1660s and '70s, Killigrew was the head of the King's Company; and he gave his "Parson's Wedding" two of the more remarkable productions of the era. Twice, in October 1664 and in June 1672, he staged the play with all-female casts. Given the fact that women performers had been appearing regularly on the English stage only since 1661, the all-female productions were sensational and revolutionary in their day.
Critical responses.
Objections have been raised to "The Parson's Wedding" from its own time onward (Samuel Pepys called it "an obscene, loose play"). Traditional critics regularly condemned the play for "coarseness" and "vulgarity." Modern-day critics have judged the "libertine picaresque" aspect of the drama less harshly, and have praised the play as "energetic" and "unbridled" — "a loose, lively, bawdy city play." Mrs. Wanton's praise of sexual freedom is not offensive to modern readers who tend to accept her values.

Kiku-ichimonji in fiction.
Owing to the popularity of Shiba Ryōtarō's fiction, many modern fans of the Shinsengumi believe a Kiku-ichimonji made by Norimune to have been Okita Soji's sword. Historically, Okita used a sword made by Kiyomitsu of Kaga Province, among other blades.
In the anime and manga versions of Rurouni Kenshin, a Norimune-made Kiku-ichimonji is wielded by Seta Sōjirō (who is based on a darker Okita from the novel "Shinsengumi Keppuroku".) 
Swords styled as "Kiku-ichimonji", or which share characteristics with Kikiu-ichimonji, appear in many video games.

Tsujigahana is a variety of Kimono created by the technique of Shibori. 
The extravagant patterns were rather more picturesque and it was more eye-catching than other ordinary kinds of Kimono. 
Tsujigahana technique is in a shroud of mystery as it is not clearly known who invented it or why it was called Tsujigahana. 
The technique lasted for two era from Muromachi period to Edo period for about 300 to 400 years. It quickly became forgotten after the rise of Japanese handicrafts technique. 
But Tsujigahana nevertheless contributed a lot for the decorative art phase in Azuchi-Momoyama period.

Cobb was in the cast. Comi's character of YoYo in several "Rawhide" episodes came as a result of his original performance in the "No Dogs or Drovers" episode, where his character of "YoYo" was originally called to be killed. The producers liked his performance and the ending was changed leading to Comi being in a number of episodes in the season.

Comi's professional acting career began in 1957, when, as an apprentice at the famous La Jolla Playhouse in La Jolla, California, he was given a small part in the play "Career" that starred Don Taylor, Una Merkel, and Ray Danton. His comedy scene as a drunken GI earned rave reviews in "The Hollywood Reporter" and "Variety", leading to his being signed by 20th Century Fox for the role of Pvt. Abbott in "The Young Lions" with Montgomery Clift and Dean Martin. At Fox, he appeared in several films: "In Love and War" with Jeffrey Hunter and Robert Wagner; "A Private's Affair" with Ernie Kovacs; and was lent out to Warner Bros. for the role of "Jenkins" in the Michael Garrison production of "The Dark at the Top of the Stairs" with Robert Preston and Dorothy McGuire. He also played Lt Tim, Steve McQueen's assistant in "The Towering Inferno".
From 1961-62, he portrayed pilot Chuck Lambert on the syndicated TV show, "Ripcord", and was a series regular on the television series "Rawhide" with Clint Eastwood. Paul also played Catherine Hickland's father, Victor Markham for one and one half seasons on the daytime soap, "CAPITOL'. This was followed by two seasons as George Durnley in "General Hospital."
Graduating magna cum laude from the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, California, Comi earned a reputation as a constantly working, versatile actor. He currently retired as president and partner of Caffe D’ Amore Inc., a company started by his wife, Eva, with her creating the world's original instant flavored cappuccino. The company has been sold to :Kerry Group, which is headquartered in Ireland and has USA offices in Beloit, WI and Commerce, CA. In the process, Comi's business partner (Chris Julias) died.

Uva letzion

Uva letzion (ובא לציון "and redeemer shall come to Zion") are the Hebrew opening words, and colloquially the name, of the closing prayer of the weekday morning service, before which one should not leave the synagogue (as ruled by the Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 132). The prayer is also recited during Mincha on Shabbat and Yom Tov as well as during Ne'ila on Yom Kippur.
The prayer consists of a series of scriptural verses which include the "Kedusha" and its Aramaic translation, and two ancient prayers embodying an aspiration for enlightenment and Messianic Redemption. It is always preceded immediately or closely by Ashrei (Psalm 145)
Uva letzion is not chanted at length; the greater portion is read in an undertone after the Chazzan has intoned the introductory lines. The chant for these, in the ritual of the Ashkenazim, is founded on the prayer-motive of "Shabbat" afternoon service (see Music, Synagogal); but in the tradition of the Sephardim there is employed a special chant, of which a variant is used for Ps. xvi., recited shortly afterward, at the expiration of "Shabbat". It is this melody which is here transcribed. In the frequent repetition of a short phrase, and the modification of it to fit the text, it reproduces the chief peculiarity of the worship-music traceable to a Spanish source earlier than 1492.A. F. L. C.

Seymchan (meteorite)

Seymchan is a pallasite meteorite found in the dry bed of the river Hekandue, a left tributary of river Jasačnaja in the Magadan district, Russia, near the settlement of Seymchan, in June 1967. 
History.
The main mass of was found during a survey in June 1967 by geologist F. A. Mednikov. The mass was a triangular-shaped thumbprinted meteorite lying among the stones of the brook bed. A second specimen of was found with a mine detector at a distance of 20 m from the first in October 1967 by I. H. Markov. The main mass was turned over to the Academy of Sciences of the USSR.
During a new expedition in 2004, Dmitri Kachalin recovered about of new material. Remarkably, about 20% of the new specimens were found to contain olivine crystals, and so revealed the silicated nature of the meteorite. The pallasitic structure was not previously discovered during studies on small metal-only sections of the original mass.
Composition and classification.
Seymchan belongs to Main Group pallasites, but it is considered anomalous due to its high Ir content. Before the discovery of its pallasitic structure it had been classified as IIE anomalous coarse octahedrite. Seymchan is considered a stable and rust-resistant pallasite.
Specimens.
Due to the heterogeneous structure of Seymchan, there are two types of specimens: with or without olivine crystals. It is worthy to note that the specimen pictured to the left shows an interesting, seldom seen feature of iron meteorites. The Widmanstätten pattern on the left hand side of the specimen is visibly bent. This is caused by the shearing of the meteorite as it broke up during atmospheric re-entry and serves as testimony of the violent experience a meteor is subject to as it falls through the atmosphere.

All Pakistan Music Conference

The All Pakistan Music Conference (APMC) was founded in 1959 for the promotion of classical music in Pakistan. Ever since its inception, it has been a constant source of inspiration for thousands of music lovers nationwide.
History.
At the time of partition, Pakistan was so beset with insurmountable social, economic and political problems that fine arts virtually remained neglected. History’s largest migration of people had totally upset the equilibrium of the population not only physically but also emotionally and psychologically. During such times, the arts could not get attention of the people or the government. Pakistani music was neglected more than all else. With the sole exception of Radio Pakistan, not even a muffled sound of music was ever heard. The memory of live music concerts lingered in the minds of a few. If lovers of music had nostalgic memories, the musicians were totally frustrated. The height of despair was reflected in the decision of Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan to leave the country. Soon after, Roshan Ara Begum announced that she was giving up Riaz as no one seemed interested in listening to her music. Her announcement jolted concerned citizens into action. Accepting the challenge, they decided to find ways and means to revive and rejuvenate the seemingly lost but rich and glorious heritage of classical music.
On 15 September 1959, these concerned citizens met at the famous Coffee House of Lahore and launched a voluntary organization under the title and style of The All Pakistan Music Conference. The main objective of the APMC was to promote music and musicians by organizing concerts, conferences and festivals. It was decided to hold, as soon as possible, a large event on national level to focus attention on our melodic culture. A festival of folk, light, semi-classical and classical music was announced for February 19, 1960 to February 23, 1960. Spread over five evening and two morning sessions, the festival was an instant success. Musicians from all over the country had participated. People from all walks of life, from all the big cities, Dhaka, Quetta, Karachi and Peshawar, and from towns and villages all over Pakistan attended the concerts in large numbers. The programme started daily at eight in the evening and lasted for five to six hours with the last evening closing a couple of hours after sunrise - a glorious day had dawned. The festival was the first major step which gave new lease of life to music in Pakistan. Followed by monthly concerts, it helped promote this noble art. Simultaneously, the festival helped project musicians. Great masters of whom the general public had not even heard and who were hidden even from the discerning eye were brought to the fore.
Objectives.
The late Hayat Ahmed Khan has been the moving spirit behind APMC. To encourage the classical musicians/vocalists living in obscurity post partition, and particularly influenced by Roshan Ara’s claim to give up her Riyaz due to the lack of interested listeners, Mr. Hayat along with several music connoisseurs laid the foundation of APMC. This project, he hoped, would rejuvenate interest in classical music in Pakistan. Many well-established artists like Roshan Ara Begum, Akhtari Bai, Rasoolan Bai, Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, Ustad Fateh Ali Khan, Ustad Salamat Ali Khan and Ustad Ghulam Hassan Shaggan have performed at APMC concerts.
Over the years, APMC has also brought forth several amateurs in the field of classical music. Notable names include Fahim Mazhar, Abdur Rauf, Sara Zaman and several others. APMC attracts music luminaries and aspiring artists alike to keep the classical music alive in the country. Not only that, both vocalists and instrumentalists from Afghanistan, Turkey, India, Japan, the United States and Germany, have benefited from the regular musical sittings held at APMC over the past forty-five years.
The APMC programmes, held on a monthly basis greatly enrich the cultural ethos of Lahore. Besides these monthly mehfils, APMC also hosts a yearly five-day festival in which musicians/vocalists from all over Pakistan perform till the wee hours of morning. Few would know that APMC has also been instrumental in promoting classical dance in Pakistan. Performances of Naheed Siddiqui, Gopi Krishan and Sheema Kirmani hosted by the organization stand as evidence.

Sergio Daniel Urribarri (born 7 October 1958) is an Argentine Justicialist Party (PJ) politician, current governor of Entre Ríos Province.
Biography.
Born in the village of Arroyo Barú, Entre Ríos, to Antonia Martínez, a schoolteacher, and Arturo Urribarri, a railway engineer. Urribarri grew up and attended school in Colón, before moving to General Campos, where at the age of 20 he became Director of the public library. He was a successful footballer for the town's club, and in 1985 he was elected Mayor of General Campos. He and his wife Analía married in 1981 and had five sons; one of them, Bruno Urribarri, became a football defender for Club Atlético Colón. 
Urribarri had a lengthy tenure as director of the Concordia Football League and was elected provincial deputy on three occasions, sitting in the provincial legislature between 1991 and 2003. He served as head of CAFESG, the governing body of the hydroelectric plant at the Salto Grande Dam from 2003, and then as minister of government, justice, education and public works under Governor Jorge Busti, from 2004.
Urribarri was elected Governor on the Front for Victory slate in March 2007. He and Busti were on opposite sides of the 2008 Argentine government conflict with the agricultural sector over higher export tariffs proposed by President Cristina Kirchner (whom Urribarri supported). He bested the UCR candidate, Gustavo Cusinato, with 47% of the vote to Cusinato's 20%. He was re-elected in 2011 with 56% of the vote, defeating Atilio Benedetti of the UCR-led Progressive Civic Front Alliance as well as Busti, who ran on a Federal Peronist ticket.
Following the president's decision in March 2012 to partly renationalize the nation's leading energy firm, YPF, Urribarri suggested as a potential adviser or director Schlumberger oil engineer and executive Miguel Galluccio; the Entre Ríos native was appointed CEO of YPF upon the firm's renationalization on May 5.

Hermann Thyräus (b. at Neuss on the Rhine, 1532; d. at Mainz, 26 October 1591) was a German Jesuit theologian and preacher.
Life.
He studied first at Cologne, and then, after 1522, at the Collegium Germanicum at Rome. On 26 May 1556, he was received into the Society of Jesus by Ignatius Loyola.
In the same year, Thyräus was made a professor of theology at Ingolstadt, where he taught for three years the "Magister sententiarum", and in the fourth year controversial theology. In 1560 he became a professor at Trier, and lectured on the Epistles of St. Paul. He was rector of the college at Trier (1565–70), provincial of the Jesuit province of the Rhine (1571-8), and from 1578 until his death rector of the college at Mainz. 
The archbishops of the Rhine often employed him in important matters. He was also a noted preacher. When he occupied the pulpit at Trier as many as 4000 people often came together to hear him.
Works.
The "Liber de religionis libertate", ascribed to him, was written most probably by his younger brother Peter, also a Jesuit. His "Confessio Augustana", with controversial notes, appeared at Dillingen in 1567. He also left several volumes of sermons.

Pinocchio (1972 film)

Pinocchio (Italian: Un burattino di nome Pinocchio, literally "A puppet named Pinocchio") is a 1972 Italian animated film adaptation of Carlo Collodi's "The Adventures of Pinocchio".
Production.
The film was directed by Giuliano Cenci with assistance from his brother Renzo. During production, Carlo Collodis grandchildren Mario and Antonio Lorenzini were consulted. The subtle movements made by fidgeting children whilst speaking or under scrutiny were incorporated into Pinocchios movements, particularly when he lies to the Fairy with the Turquoise Hair over the fate of his gold coins. For the design of the Fairy, Italian portrayals of the Blessed Virgin Mary in art were used as starting points.
Cast.
Renato Rascel was chosen to serve as both the singer of the introductory song and as the narrator. He was permitted to occasionally ad lib in order to get the films message across, and to give it a truly Italian feel.
Design.
The characters were animated with unconventional uniform black outlines which contrasted with the complex styles characteristic of usual Italian animations and Disney films. For the design of Pinocchio, the animators took inspiration to illustrations made by Attilio Mussino. The backgrounds were painted by Sicillian artist Alberto D'Angelo and Abramo Scortecci who both used tone styles evocative of early 20th century Italian art with little focus on surrealism as in the Disney adaptation.
English Dubbed Version.
In 1978, an English-dubbed version was released in the US by G.G. Communications. The supposed voices are Jeremy Irons as the narrator, Pamelyn Ferdin as Pinocchio, Dallas McKennon as Gepetto, Martha Scott as the Blue Fairy, Peter Renaday as Mangiafuoco, Paul Kligman as Lucignolo, Alan Sues as the Fox, Don Messick as the Cat and the Talking Cricket, Paul Frees as the Green Fisherman, Tony Pope as the boy at the puppet theatre, John Stephenson as Allidoro, the tuna fish and a townperson, Bob Holt as Harlequin and also Hal Smith as the farmer (Paul Frees was also the voice of the farmer in another dubbed version of the English version of Pinocchio).

Barten Holyday

Barten Holyday or Holiday (1593–1661) was a clergyman, author and poet. He earned a Doctor of Divinity degree, and entered the clergy in 1615; he was appointed archdeacon of Oxford by King Charles I in 1626. "Technogamia" was his only play. In 1618, the year it was produced, Holyday served as Sir Francis Stewart's chaplain on Stewart's embassy to Spain. Holyday translated the "Odes" of Horace and works of Juvenal and Persius, and wrote "A Survey of the World, in Verse" (1661), plus sermons and miscellaneous works. He was summed up by one commentator as "a good scholar, a shrewd critic, and a fair wit." His translations show strong fidelity to their originals, and have often been considered the best of his works. Samuel Johnson said in "Idler" 69 that his translations were those of "only a scholar and a critick" not a poet.
He was subject of a derisory poem called ‘Whoop Holiday’, published in 1625 by Peter Heylin

Tricca

Tricca was an ancient city in Thessaly, Greece. It corresponds to modern Trikala. 
It was an ancient city, near the Peneius River and on the Lethaeus River. It is mentioned in Homer as the Kingdom of Machaon and Podaleirius, sons of Aesculapius and physicians of the Greek army. It possessed the oldest known temple of Aesculapius, which was discovered in 1902, with a hospital for pilgrims. Tricca is mentioned by other writers.
"Tricca and Stagoi" is the name of a bishopric of the Church of Greece. Tricca is also a Catholic titular see.
Bishops.
Socrates Scholasticus, Sozomenes, and Nicephorus Callistus say that Heliodorus, probably the same as the author Heliodorus of Emesa, became Bishop of Tricca. Another bishop was Oecumenius, to whom have been wrongly attributed commentaries on the Acts of the Apostles, the Epistles of St. Paul and the Catholic Epistles (for the works published in his name are not his), and lived at the end of the sixth century. He was an Origenist and Monophysite who wrote a commentary on the Apocalypse. 
Some Latin titular bishops in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries are also known.

The Last Guy

The Last Guy is a PlayStation Network title for the PlayStation 3. It is available as a downloadable game on the PlayStation Store. The game is a rescue game in which the eponymous player character must guide civilians to escape from monster-infested cities. On July 31, 2008, it was released in Japan. It was released in North America and Europe on August 28, 2008.
Gameplay.
The game is played from a top-down perspective of a city that has been overrun by giant monsters, which the game refers to as "zombies". The player controls The Last Guy, whose job is to find and lead stranded civilians to the escape zone before the time runs out, while evading enemy creatures. He can dash, manipulate the line of people following him, and use thermal imaging to find survivors. Over a dozen playable locations include cities from North America, Europe and Asia. Online features include a leaderboard for each city, a leaderboard for overall score, and counters that record the number of people rescued. Each city also hosts four VIPs which, when rescued, add bonus points to the final score and unlock additional bonus stages.
In May 2009, the game was updated to include trophy support and allow downloadable content to be purchased from the PlayStation Network.
Development.
The game was rumored to use high-resolution satellite imagery from Google Earth to render real world cities, but this claim was later confirmed to be incorrect by the US producer of the game.
Reception.
IGN's reviewer enjoyed the game, saying ""The Last Guy" is an outstanding title that's challenging, funny, and fresh." Gaming Target also enjoyed the game, stating that "The Last Guy" "features just enough quirky and clever gameplay to be worth the $10" and later selecting the game for their list of "40 Games We'll Still Be Playing From 2008"

Bavarian G 3/4 H

The Class G 3/4 H steam locomotive of the Royal Bavarian State Railways ("Königlich Bayerische Staatsbahn") was built between 1919 and 1923. Its striking features in comparison with the G 3/4 N were its superheater system, the feedwater preheater, the larger and higher-positioned boiler and its Adams axle. In addition, they were more powerful and efficient than their predecessors. All 225 examples that were built were taken over by the Bavarian Group Administration within the Reichsbahn and were initially operated under their old numbers. Later they were given operating numbers 54 1501–1725 following the final renumbering plan issued by the DRG. The majority of locomotives also survived the Second World War. The last engine (with operating number 54 1632) was not retired until 1966.
Numbers 54.1534, 1548, 1550, 1559, 1589 and 1663 remained in Austria after the war. The ÖBB added them to their fleet and ran them as ÖBB Class 654. All engines in this class were retired by 1957. Number 654.1663 was reassigned in 1956 as an industrial locomotive in the main workshop at Simmering, where it received the number 913.502.
The engines were equipped with a Bavarian 3 T 18,2 tender.

<doc id="18418412" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18418412" title="Hatley, Cambridgeshire">
Hatley, Cambridgeshire

Hatley is a civil parish in South Cambridgeshire, England. It lies between the villages of Gamlingay and Croydon, 12 miles south-west of the city of Cambridge and eight miles south-east of the town of St Neots. In 2001, the population of Hatley parish was 205 people living in 77 households.
History.
The Hatley name was in use as early as 986, derived from 'laie' or 'ley', a woodland clearing, or 'woodland clearing on the hill'. The spelling "Hatelaie" was used in the 1086 Domesday Book. The parishes were known as 'Hungry Hatley' by 1218, possibly because the clay soil could not be cultivated effectively until mechanisation in the 20th century. The adjoining parish of Cockayne Hatley, in Bedfordshire, is said to be unconnected to the Cambridgeshire Hatleys.
In 1831, the population of the parish of Hatley St George was 105 people. At the time of the census in 1921, it was 67 people.
Governance.
The parish was established in 1957 when the parish of Hatley St George was united with East Hatley. Hatley Parish Council comprises three members, a chairman, vice-chairman and a clerk. The parish is represented on the South Cambridgeshire District Council by two councillors for the Gamlingay ward and on Cambridgeshire County Council by one councillor for the Gamlingay electoral division. It is in the parliamentary constituency of South Cambridgeshire, represented at the House of Commons by Andrew Lansley.
Geography.
Hatley is 12 miles south-west of the county town of Cambridge and 45 miles north of London. The elevation ranges between 55 and 79 metres (180-260 feet) above sea level. The soil is clay subsoil with boulder clay. The parish covers an area of 958 hectares. 
Around half of the land in Hatley parish belongs to the Hatley Park Estate. 76% of land is used for crops or fallow land; 9.5% is covered by grass, 4.9% by woodland and 7.1% by set-aside. Wheat, barley and rapeseed are grown. In summer, the estate's parkland is grazed by beef cattle and by sheep in winter. The yard at Church Farm, owned by the estate, has been converted to small business units. One other farm is in the parish and two neighbouring farmers use land in it.
There are two main settlements in the parish, connected by a minor road. Hatley St George consists of a row of houses along the Gamlingay-Croydon road. It has a small shop and post office, (subsidised by the estate) a playing field, playground and cricket club. It is presumed that the hamlet's name is derived from that of the St George family, who were the principal landowners from the 13th century to 1658. Hatley St George is an 'estate village' - Hatley Park Estate owns all the houses except for five. About a third are used for current and retired estate workers, with the others rented out.
East Hatley is a row of houses along a smaller road. It was formerly known as Castell Hatley. In 1929, the hamlet was owned by the Master and Fellows of Downing College, Cambridge. Sir George Downing, 1st Baronet, after whom Downing Street is named, owned land in East Hatley (his grandson, Sir George Downing, 3rd Baronet, founded Downing College). 
Historically, East Hatley housed local farm labourers. Now, few agricultural workers live there and it has been described as a 'small, middle-class commuter settlement'. The houses are mainly privately owned but there are three council-owned bungalows. There is little interaction between East Hatley and Hatley St George. 
Hatley village hall was built by the estate in 1960. It was run as a social club before it became financially unviable, closing in 2005, and is now run by the Parish Council. 
Around one-third of the parish is occupied by Hatley Park, an area of private landscaped parkland south of the road, formerly owned by Sir John Astor MBE.
Demography.
At the time of the 2001 census, the population of Hatley parish was 205 people living in 77 households. The ethnic group of 98.6% of Hatley residents was white and 1.4% Asian or Asian British. 73.7% described themselves as Christian.
Hatley has a high rate of in-migration and commuting, and retains economically strong farming activities. Hatley Park once employed most Hatley St George residents. There was formerly a Thoroughbred stud farm in Hatley Park, employing 15 people, but it is now a livery yard staffed by two for most of the year. Seven Hatley St George residents were employed on the estate in 2007; a number of people work for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, whose headquarters is nearby at Sandy, Bedfordshire. At the time of the 2001 census, 17.7% of Hatley residents were self-employed, 2.1% were unemployed and 4% were employed in agriculture.
Landmarks.
Hatley St George has a church, dedicated to St George, which was first built in 1352. It is a Grade II* listed building. Services take place every two weeks. East Hatley's church, dedicated to St Denis, has been disused since 1980. It is also a Grade II* listed building. Hatley's churches are part of the ecclesiastical parish of "Gamlingay with Hatley St George and East Hatley", in the diocese of Ely.
There are remnants of ancient woodland: Buff Wood, south-west of East Hatley, is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) owned by the estate and managed by the local Wildlife Trust, and Hayley Wood, another SSSI, borders the parish in the north.

Martian geysers are putative sites of small-scale jet-like eruptions that occur in the south polar region region of Mars during the spring thaw. "Dark dune spots" and "spiders" are the two most visible types of features ascribed to these eruptions.
They are unlike any terrestrial geological phenomenon. The reflectance (albedo), shapes and unusual spider appearance of these features have stimulated a variety of hypotheses about their origin, ranging from differences in frosting reflectance, to explanations involving biological processes. However, all current geophysical models assume some sort of geyser-like activity on Mars. Their characteristics, and the process of their formation, are still a matter of debate.
These features are unique to the south polar region of Mars in an area informally called the 'cryptic region', at latitudes 60° to 80° south and longitudes 150°W to 310°W; this 1 meter deep carbon dioxide (CO2) ice transition area —between the scarps of the thick polar ice layer and the permafrost— is where clusters of the apparent geyser systems are located.
The seasonal frosting and defrosting of carbon dioxide ice results in the appearance of a number of features, such dark dune spots with spider-like rilles or channels below the ice, where spider-like radial channels are carved between the ground and the carbon dioxide ice, giving it an appearance of spider webs, then, pressure accumulating in their interior ejects gas and dark basaltic sand or dust, which is deposited on the ice surface and thus, forming dark dune spots. This process is rapid, observed happening in the space of a few days, weeks or months, a growth rate rather unusual in geology – especially for Mars. However, it would seem that multiple years would be required to carve the larger spider-like channels. There is no direct data on these features other than images taken in the visible and infrared spectra.
History.
The geological features informally called dark dune spots and spiders were separately discovered on images acquired by the MOC camera on board the Mars Global Surveyor during 1998–1999. At first it was generally thought they were unrelated features because of their appearance, so from 1998 through 2000 they were reported separately on different research publications ( and -respectively), with the first "jet" or "geyser" models starting to be proposed and refined from 2000 onwards.
The name 'spiders' was coined by Malin Space Science Systems personnel, the developers of the camera. One of the first and most interesting spider photos was found by Greg Orme in October 2000. The unusual shape and appearance of these 'spider webs' and spots caused a lot of speculation about their origin. The first years' surveillance showed that during the following Martian years, 70% of the spots appear at exactly the same place, and a preliminary statistical study obtained between September 1999 and March 2005, indicated that dark dune spots and spiders are related phenomena as functions of the cycle of carbon dioxide (CO2) ice condensation and sublimation.
It was also initially suggested that the dark spots were simply warm patches of bare ground, but thermal imaging during 2006 revealed that the temperature of these structures is as cold as the ice that covers the area, indicating they were a thin layer of dark material lying on top of the ice and kept chilled by it. However, soon after their first detection, they were discovered to be negative topographical features – i.e. radial troughs or channels of what today are thought to be geyser-like vent systems.
Morphology.
The geysers' two most prominent features (dark dune spots and spider channels) appear at the beginning of the Martian spring on dune fields covered with carbon dioxide (CO2 or 'dry ice'), mainly at the ridges and slopes of the dunes; by the beginning of winter, they disappear. Dark spots' shape is generally round, on the slopes it is usually elongated, sometimes with streams -possibly of water- that accumulate in pools at the bottom of the dunes. Dark dune spots are typically 15 to 46 metres (50 to 150 feet) wide and spaced several hundred feet apart. The size of spots varies, and some are as small as 20 m across, —however, the smaller size seen is limited by imaging resolution— and can grow and coalesce into formations several kilometres wide.
Spider features, when viewed individually, form a round lobed structure reminiscent of a spider web radiating outward in lobes from a central point. Its radial patterns represent shallow channels or ducts in the ice formed by the flow of the sublimation gas toward the vents. The entire spider channel network is typically 160–300 m across, although there are large variations.
Each geyser's characteristic form appears to depend on a combination of such factors as local fluid or gas composition and pressure, ice thickness, underlying gravel type, local climate and meteorological conditions. The geysers' boundary does not seem to correlate with any other properties of the surface such as elevation, geological structure, slope, chemical composition or thermal properties. The geyser-like system produce low-albedo spots, fans and blotches, with small radial spider-like channel networks most often associated with their location. At first, the spots seem to be grey, but later their centres darken because they gradually get covered with dark ejecta, thought to be mainly basaltic sand. It should be noted that not all dark spots observed in early spring are associated with spider landforms, however, a preponderance of dark spots and streaks on the cryptic terrain are associated with the appearance of spiders later in the season.
Time-lapsed imagery performed by NASA confirms the apparent ejection of dark material following the radial growth of spider channels in the ice. Time-lapsed imaging of a single area of interest also shows that small dark spots generally indicate the position of spider features not yet visible; it also shows that spots expand significantly, including dark fans emanating from some of the spots, which increase in prominence and develop clear directionality indicative of wind action.
Some branching ravines modify, some destroy and others create crust in a dynamic near-surface process that extensively reworks the terrain creating and destroying surface layers. Thus, Mars seems to have a dynamic process of recycling of its near surface crust of carbon dioxide. Growth process is rapid, happening in the space of a few days, weeks or months, a growth rate rather unusual in geology – especially for Mars. A number of geophysical models have been investigated to explain the various colors and shapes' development of these geysers on the southern polar ice cap of Mars.
Geyser mechanism models.
The strength of the eruptions is estimated to range from simple upsurges to high-pressure eruptions at speeds of or more, carrying dark basaltic sand and dust plumes high aloft. The current proposed models dealing with the possible forces powering the geyser-like system are discussed next.
Atmospheric pressure.
The surface atmospheric pressure on Mars varies annually around: 6.7–8.8 mbar and 7.5–9.7 mbar; daily around 6.4–6.8 mbar. Because of the pressure changes subsurface gases expand and contract periodically, causing a downward gas flow during increase of and expulsion during decrease of atmospheric pressure. This cycle was first quantified with measurements of the surface pressure, which varies annually with amplitude of 25%.
This model proposes downward gas flow during increase of and upward flow during decrease of atmospheric pressure. In the defrosting process, ices (clathrate) may partly migrate into the soil and partly may evaporate. These locations can be in connection with the formation of dark dune spots and the arms of spiders as gas travel paths.
Dry venting.
Some teams propose dry venting of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas and sand, occurring between the ice and the underlying bedrock. It is known that a CO2 ice slab is virtually transparent to solar radiation where 72% of solar energy incident at 60 degrees off vertical will reach the bottom of a 1 m thick layer. In addition, separate teams from Taiwan and France measured the ice thickness in several target areas, and discovered that the greatest thickness of the CO2 frost layer in the geysers' area is about 0.76–0.78 m, supporting the geophysical model of dry venting powered by sunlight. As the southern spring CO2 ice receives enough solar energy, it starts sublimation of the CO2 ice from the bottom. This vapor accumulates under the slab rapidly increasing pressure and erupting. High-pressure gas flows through at speeds of or more; under the slab, the gas erodes ground as it rushes toward the vents, snatching up loose particles of sand and carving the spidery network of grooves. The dark material falls back to the surface and may be taken up slope by wind, creating dark wind streak patterns on the ice cap. This model is consistent with past observations. It is clear that sublimation of the base of the seasonal ice cap is more than capable of generating a substantial overpressure, which is four orders of magnitude higher than the ice overburden pressure and five orders of magnitude higher than atmospheric pressure as discussed above.
The observation that a few dark spots form before sunrise, with significant spot formation occurring immediately following sunrise, supports the notion that the system is powered by solar energy. Eventually the ice is completely removed and the dark granular material is back on the surface; the cycle repeats many times.
Water-driven erosion.
Data obtained by the Mars Express satellite, made it possible in 2004 to confirm that the southern polar cap has an average of thick slab of CO2 ice with varying contents of frozen water, depending on its latitude: the bright polar cap itself, is a mixture of 85% CO2 ice and 15% water ice. The second part comprises steep slopes known as 'scarps', made almost entirely of water ice, that fall away from the polar cap to the surrounding plains. This transition area between the scarps and the permafrost is the 'cryptic region', where clusters of geysers are located.
This model explores the possibility of active water-driven erosive structures, where soil and water derived from the shallow sub-surface layer is expelled up by CO2 gas through fissures eroding joints to create spider-like radiating tributaries capped with mud-like material and/or ice.
Geothermal.
A European team proposes that the features could be a sign that non-solar energy source is responsible of the jets, subsurface heat wave for instance. This model is difficult to reconcile with the evidence collected in the form of thermal emission (infrared) imaging, which shows that the fans, spots and blotches are produced by expulsion of cold fluids or cold gases.
Carbon dioxide and water cycling.
Michael C. Malin, a planetary scientist and designer of the cameras used by the Mars Global Surveyor that obtained the images, is studying the images acquired of specific areas and he tracks their changes over a period of a few years. On 2000, he modelled the fans and spots' dynamics as a complex process of carbon dioxide (CO2) and water sublimation and re-precipitation. The typical pattern of defrosting proceeds from the initiation of small, dark spots typically located at the margins of dunes; these spots individually enlarge and eventually all coalesce. The pattern the enlargement follows is distinct and characteristic: a dark nuclear spot enlarges slowly, often with a bright outer zone or 'halo'. As these are progressive, centripetal phenomena, each location of the light zone is overtaken by an expanding dark zone. Although initially developed along dune margins, spot formation quickly spreads onto and between dunes. As spring progresses, fan-shaped tails ('spiders') develop from the central spot. Defrosting occurs as the low albedo polar sand heats beneath an optically thin layer of frost, causing the frost to evaporate. This is the dark nucleus of the spots seen on dunes. As the vapor moves laterally, it encounters cold air and precipitates, forming the bright halo. This precipitated frost is again vaporized as the uncovered zone of sand expands; the cycle repeats many times.
European Space Agency.
While the European Space Agency (ESA) has not yet formulated a theory or model, they have stated that the process of frost sublimation is not compatible with a few important features observed in the images, and that the location and shape of the spots is at odds with a physical explanation, specifically, because the channels appear to radiate downhill as much as they radiate uphill, defying gravity.
Hypothetical biological origin.
A team of Hungarian scientists propose that the dark dune spots and channels may be colonies of photosynthetic Martian microorganisms, which over-winter beneath the ice cap, and as the sunlight returns to the pole during early spring, light penetrates the ice, the microorganisms photosynthesise and heat their immediate surroundings. A pocket of liquid water, which would normally evaporate instantly in the thin Martian atmosphere, is trapped around them by the overlying ice. As this ice layer thins, the microorganisms show through grey. When it has completely melted, they rapidly desiccate and turn black surrounded by a grey aureole. The Hungarian scientists think that even a complex sublimation process is insufficient to explain the formation and evolution of the dark dune spots in space and time. Since their discovery, fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke promoted these formations as deserving of study from an astrobiological perspective.
A multinational European team suggests that if liquid water is present in the spiders' channels during their annual defrost cycle, the structures might provide a niche where certain microscopic life forms could have retreated and adapted while sheltered from UV solar radiation. British and German teams also consider the possibility that organic matter, microbes, or even simple plants might co-exist with these inorganic formations, especially if the mechanism includes liquid water and a geothermal energy source. However, they also remark that the majority of geological structures may be accounted for without invoking any organic "life on Mars" hypothesis. (See also: Life on Mars.)
Lander mission.
There is no direct data on these features other than images taken in the visible and infrared spectra, and development of the Mars Geyser Hopper lander is under consideration to study the geyser-like systems. It has not yet been formally proposed nor funded.

Charles Douglas, 6th Marquess of Queensberry

Charles Douglas, 6th Marquess of Queensberry, KT (March 1777 – 3 December 1837) was a Scottish peer.
Douglas was the first son and heir of Sir William Douglas, Bt, and his wife, Grace, née Johnstone. He inherited his father's baronetcy in 1783. On 13 August 1803, he married Lady Caroline Scott (1774–1854), the third daughter of Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch; they had eight daughters.
In 1810, he succeeded his fourth cousin once removed, William Douglas, 4th Duke of Queensberry, as Marquess of Queensberry. From 1812 to 1832, he was a representative peer for Scotland, was made a Knight of the Thistle in 1821, and created Baron Solway, of Kinmount, in the County of Dumfries, in 1833, which granted him an automatic seat in the House of Lords.
On his death without male heirs in 1837, the marquessate and baronetcy passed to his brother, and the barony became extinct.

Fuse (band)

Fuse was an American rock band formed in Rockford, Illinois, in 1967, after Rick Nielsen proposed the merging of two local bands: The Grim Reapers (Rick Nielsen and Joe Sundberg) and Toast and Jam (Chip Greenman, Craig Myers, and Tom Peterson later known as Tom Petersson). Managed by Ken Adamany, Fuse's line-up consisted of Rick Nielsen (keyboards/guitar), Joe Sundberg (vocals), Tom Peterson (bass guitar), Craig Myers (lead guitar), and Chip Greenman (drums/percussion).
A single was recorded for Smack Records, including the tunes "Hound Dog" and "Crusin for Burgers". In 1969, the band played in Chicago and was signed by Epic Records. Epic executives rushed the band into Columbia Studios in the fall and, in a matter of a few weeks, the album "Fuse" was recorded, which was released early 1970 (re-released in 2001). It remains their only album, though a bootleg disc, "Retrospective Foresight", was released some time later. 
Frustrated by their lack of success, Fuse recruited the two remaining members of Nazz (Thom Mooney and Robert "Stewkey" Antoni) in 1970 in place of Sundberg and Greenman, and ended up playing around the Midwest for six or seven months under two monikers, Fuse or Nazz, depending on where they were gigging. With Brad Carlson later known as Bun E. Carlos replacing Mooney on drums, Fuse moved to Philadelphia in 1971 and began calling themselves 'Sick Man of Europe'. After a European tour in 1973, Nielsen, Petersson and Carlos formed Cheap Trick with Randy Hogan.

Knock Castle, Aberdeenshire

Knock Castle is a ruined tower house in Aberdeenshire, north-east Scotland. It is typical of the traditional type of residence of a laird, a Scottish landed gentleman. The Castle sits in a strong position on a knoll in a field on the south side of Craig of the Knock, at the entrance to Glen Muick. It is located about west of the town of Ballater, and about east of Balmoral, just off the A93. The castle is in the care of Historic Scotland.
Description.
Knock Castle is a four-storey ruin, dating from approximately 1600. The rectangular keep strongly resembles that of a Borders pele tower, and measures about by , with walls of about thick. The external walls of the castle survive intact, although the tower is roofless. An unusual feature at Knock are the defensive shot holes, for pistols, under each of the numerous windows, each of these having a defensive grate protecting them. The shot holes are all angled to the ground, with the centre one pointing forward and the two outer holes pointing slightly askew.
The inside of the tower is entirely ruined, but the remains of a vaulted basement, used as a kitchen, and a spiral turnpike staircase can still be seen. At the top of the stair a lookout turret or cap house is still visible.
The foundations of an enclosing courtyard wall are still visible. The strong wooden door, protected by an iron yett, opened on to the north side of the surrounding courtyard. Various out buildings, including a brewery, stables, or bake house, for example, would have been set around the perimeter wall.
A short distance to the west is a motte, or mound, with the possible foundations of a 12th-century timber stronghold, known as the Old Castle Knock. Belonging to the Earls of Mar, this structure was destroyed in 1590 by the Clan Chattan (Macintosh). What little remains of the site appears to have evidence of a corn-drying kiln within.
History.
Knock Castle was granted to the Gordons of Abergeldie by the 4th Earl of Huntly, after the battle of Corrichie. Fought on the 28 October 1562, the Gordons were defeated by the forces of Mary, Queen of Scots during her suppression of the rebellious Huntly.
A feud between the neighbouring clan, the Forbes, intensified when Henry Gordon, the 2nd Laird of Knock, was murdered during a raid by the Forbes and Clan Chattan men. His brother Alexander Gordon succeeded Henry. It is said that one day, when Alexander sent his seven sons out to cut peat for the winter store, the brothers are said to have strayed onto the Forbes Clan lands, when after several hours cutting were discovered by the Forbes and his men. A battle ensued, by the end of which all the brothers were killed. After the affray the Forbes decided to make an example of the Gordons. They severed the heads of the brothers and impaled them on their peat spades. After a while, concerned about the whereabouts of his sons, the Laird sent out one of his servants with a meal for the boys to look for them. When the boy’s heads were discovered the servant, distraught, ran back to Knock with the news of what had transpired that day. Upon hearing the news, Alexander Gordon collapsed at the top of the turnpike stair and tumbled to his death. The Forbes Laird was then taken and executed and all his lands were forfeited to Abergeldie.

Raphanea

Raphanea or Raphaneae (present-day Rafniye) was a city of the late Roman province of Syria Secunda. Its bishopric was a suffragan of Apamea.
History.
Josephus mentions Raphanea in connection with a stream that flowed only every seventh days (probably an intermittent spring now called Fuwar ed-Deir) and that was viewed by Titus on his way northward from Berytus after the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70.
Near Emesa, Raphanea was the fortified headquarters of the Legio III Gallica from which was launched the successful bid of 14-year-old Elagabalus to become Roman Emperor in 218.
Raphanea issued coins under Elagabalus, and many of its coins are extant.
Hierocles and Georgius Cyprius mention Raphanea among the towns of Syria Secunda. The crusaders passed through it at the end of 1099; it was taken by Baldwin I and was given to the Count of Tripoli. It was then known as Rafania.
Episcopal see.

Wild Bill Elliott

Wild Bill Elliott (October 16, 1904 – November 26, 1965) was an American film actor. He specialized in playing the rugged heroes of B-Westerns, particularly in the Red Ryder series of films.
Early life.
Elliott was born Gordon A. Nance in Pattonsburg, Missouri, the son of cattle broker Leroy "Roy" Whitfield Nance and his wife, the former Maude Myrtle Auldridge.
The young Nance grew up within twenty miles of his birthplace, most of his youth spent on a ranch near King City, Missouri. His father was a cattle rancher and commissioner buyer for the Kansas City stockyards. Riding and roping were part of Gordon Nance's upbringing. He won first place in a rodeo event in the 1920 American Royal livestock show. He briefly attended Rockhurst College, a Jesuit school in Kansas City, but soon left for California with hopes of becoming an actor.
Career.
By 1925, he was getting occasional extra work in films. He took classes at the Pasadena Playhouse and appeared in a few stage roles there. By 1927, he had made his first Western, "The Arizona Wildcat", and in it, played his first featured role. Several co-starring roles followed and he renamed himself Gordon Elliott. But as the studios made the transition to sound films, he slipped back into extra roles and bit parts, as in 1929's "Broadway Scandals". For the next eight years, he appeared in over a hundred films for various studios, but almost always in unbilled extra parts.
Elliott began to be noticed in some minor B-Westerns, enough so that Columbia Pictures offered him the title role in a serial, "The Great Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok" (1938), which was successful enough that Columbia offered him a contract as a leading man. The popularity of the serial made Columbia president Harry Cohn rename him as "Wild Bill" instead of Gordon. Within two years, Elliott was among the Motion Picture Herald's Top Ten Western Stars, where he would remain for the next fifteen years.
In 1943, Elliott signed with Republic Pictures, which cast him in a series of Westerns alongside George 'Gabby' Hayes. The first of these, "Calling Wild Bill Elliott", gave Elliott the name by which he would best be known and by which he would be billed almost exclusively for the rest of his career. 
Following several films in which both actor and character shared the name "Wild Bill Elliott," the actor took over the role for which he would be best remembered, that of Red Ryder in a series of sixteen movies about the famous comic strip cowboy and his young Indian companion Little Beaver (played in Elliott's films by Bobby Blake). Elliott played the role for only two years, but would forever be associated with it. Elliott's trademark was a pair of six guns worn butt-forward in their holsters. 
Elliott's career thrived during and after the Red Ryder films, and he continued making B-Westerns into the early 1950s. He also had his own radio show during the late 1940s. His final contract as a Western star was with Monogram Pictures, where budgets declined as the B-Western lost its audience to television. When Monogram became Allied Artists Pictures Corporation in 1953, it phased out its Western productions, and Elliott finished out his contract with a series of modern police dramas, his first non-Westerns since 1938.
Elliott retired from films (except for a couple of TV Western pilots which were not picked up). He worked for a time as a spokesman for Viceroy cigarettes and hosted a local TV program in Las Vegas, Nevada which featured many of his Western films.
Personal life.
Elliott was a breeder of appaloosa and spotted horses and showed them in breeder contests for best in breed. He showed his horses in the Western States contest in Colorado Springs, CO, at the Broadmoor Hotel's Stadium in 1953.
Elliott married Helen Josephine Meyers in February, 1927. Their daughter, Barbara Helen Nance, was born October 14, 1927. Elliott and his wife were divorced in 1961, and Elliott remarried that same year, to Dolly Moore. 
Following his retirement in 1957, Elliott moved from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, Nevada, where he bought a ranch. He died there, from lung cancer, on November 26, 1965, at 61. He is interred at Palm Downtown Mortuary & Cemetery in Las Vegas.

Mihrimah Sultan Mosque (Edirnekapı)

The Mihrimah Sultan Mosque () is an Ottoman mosque located in the Edirnekapı neighborhood near the Byzantine land walls of Istanbul, Turkey. Located on the peak of the Sixth Hill near the highest point of the city, the mosque is a prominent landmark in Istanbul.
History.
The Mihrimah Sultan Mosque was designed by Mimar Sinan ("Sinan the Architect") for the favorite daughter of Suleiman the Magnificent, Princess Mihrimah. Its building took place from 1562 to 1565. The complex has been severely damaged by earthquakes several times (including 1719, 1766, 1814 and 1894), and although efforts were made to restore the mosque, its attendant buildings received less attention. The dome was further damaged during 1999 İzmit earthquake, and required restoration, along with the upper half of the minaret.
Architecture.
Exterior.
The mosque was built on a terrace overlooking the main street. A large courtyard ("avlu") whose interior portico is divided into individual cells forming a "madrasah" surrounds the mosque. In the center of the courtyard is a large ablution fountain　("sadirvan"). Entry to the mosque is through an imposing porch of seven domed bays with marble and granite columns. The mosque itself is a cube topped by a half-sphere, with symmetrical multi-windowed tympana on each of the four sides. The dome is supported by four towers, one in each corner; its base is pierced by windows. The single minaret is tall and slender; during the 1894 earthquake it crashed through the roof of the mosque.
Interior.
The interior is a cube under a dome 20 m in diameter and 37 m high. On the north and south sides, triple arcades supported by granite columns open onto side aisles with galleries above, each with three domed bays. A vast amount of surface area is covered by windows, making the mosque one of the brightest lit of any of Sinan's works. Some of the windows contain stained glass.
The interior stencil decorations are all modern. However, the mimbar in carved white marble is from the original construction.
Complex.
As built, the Mihrimah Sultan Mosque had a "külliye" which included (besides madrasah) a double hamman, "türbe" and a low row of shops under the terrace upon which the mosque was built, whose rents were intended to financially support the mosque complex.
The complex does not include the grave of Mihrimah Sultana herself (which is located at the Süleymaniye Mosque, but a ruined "türbe" (which is also a work of Sinan) behind the mosque houses the graves of her son-in-law, Grand Vizier Semiz Ali Pasha, as well as many other members of her family.

Thom Mooney

Thom Mooney (born 5 January 1948, Altoona, Pennsylvania) is an American drummer.
Strongly influenced by the British invasion during the sixties, he was a founding member of the East Coast rock group Nazz, along with guitarist Todd Rundgren, who later went on to have a successful solo career. With the release of the first album "Nazz" (the name derived from an old jazz expression as well as the Yardbirds hit "The Nazz Are Blue"), his group had a larger than life live show, touring with the then-nascent group Spirit, with a huge guitar-driven sound that was firmly propelled by Mooney's wildly energetic drumming style. Reviews were more than enthusiastic, but the group's demise, shortly after their return to the recording studio, was the result of growing pains and perhaps too much hype. Mooney went on to assist in the release of the second album "Nazz Nazz", and a posthumous third album "Nazz III", but then worked to become one of the most active rock drummers on the burgeoning 70s scene, eventually working as musical director and drummer for Rita Coolidge, as well as session work and writing with Men at Work's Colin Hay, John Hiatt, tours with Roger McGuinn, and many others. As well as Nazz, he has drummed with Fuse, Paris (with Bob Welch), the Curtis Brothers and Tattoo (with Wally Bryson). At present, Mooney lives on the West Coast, and is still active in music.

Numurkah railway station

Numurkah is a closed railway station on the Goulburn Valley railway in the town of Numurkah, Victoria, Australia. The station opened as the terminus of the railway from Shepparton on 1 September 1881 The line was extended north to Strathmerton and Cobram in October 1888, as well as a short distance west to Nathalia. The latter line was extended to Picola in 1896 as the Picola line, with the junction located to the north of the station at the down end.
New station buildings were opened on 29 May 1969. Passenger services beyond the station to Cobram were discontinued in 1981 as part of the New Deal timetable, but were resumed in 1983. The final closure was in 1993, when the Cobram service was cut back to Shepparton, as it is today. Present facilities at the station include a disused platform, a station building now leased to a local business, a footbridge over the tracks, a disconnected turntable, and grain silos.

<doc id="18418767" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18418767" title="C. H. Brown">
C. H. Brown

Early years.
Reverend Charles Hunter Brown, born February 2, 1907 to Lacy and Martha Brown in the Proffit Historic District, Virginia was one of several sons born to the Browns. He often missed school to help out at home during the growing and harvesting season. As a young man, he sought employment away from the grueling life he had known as a farmer. His early employment included work with a company that laid Macadam roads. Rev. Brown’s call to the Ministry came in his late twenties. He fellowshipped with various Pentecostal churches even after he met and married Angie Loving. He later worked at odd jobs including the now defunct Arthur’s Grill in downtown Charlottesville, Virginia. It was then that the early seeds of entrepreneurship started to grow. In the meantime, he met Dr. John L. Manahan [http://www.virginia.edu/topnews/releases2006/Century_Service.html who owned Fairview Farm in Scottsville, VA located in Southern Albemarle County. Dr. Manahan hired him to be caretaker for his dairy farm. Brown, along with his wife and children moved into the manor house. There he had no problem getting into the swing of farming. Milking cows and transporting the milk to the Monticello Dairy in Charlottesville provided an occasional break from the farm.
Master Builder.
Farming was what Brown did to earn the money he needed to move his family back to Charlottesville and pursue his dream of becoming a builder. He had frequently purchased tools and Audel manuals that he told his wife would one day make money for him. In the summer of 1945, Brown purchased a house on 10 ½ Street that he subsequently remodeled and added on a 3-room apartment. He moved his family of 3 daughters and 2 sons back to town. For a while, he worked for H. T. Ferron, a company that made cinderblock; and for R. E. Lee & Sons who would later become a major player in the construction industry in Charlottesville. Later, he hired himself out as a carpenter remodeling houses and doing additions. Soon he had a contract to build his first house. By the mid-1950s, Blacks who wanted to build in Charlottesville and the surrounding counties started to seek him out.
12th and Rosser.
It was in the mid-1940s that Rev. Brown and a few others started to hold worship services from house to house. They most often met in a 2-story house on Henry Avenue across from Moseley’s Store. Rev. Brown and Rev. Moseley managed to secure a plat of land on the corner of 12th Street, NW and Rosser Avenue. In 1947, it was there that Rev. Brown constructed Holy Temple Church of God in Christ, his first major non-residential building. Soon after building the church, Brown met E. R. Martin. After doing a number of jobs for Martin who owned a lot of property, a deal was struck that made Brown the owner of several acres of land on 12th Street, NW. 
It was there that he built what would become the “family home.” The land had been a dumping area on a dead end street. However, the location was ideally suited for Brown and his family that had swelled to 5 daughters and 5 sons. Brown seemingly could not get away from farming. He maintained huge gardens and several pigs until the late 1950s. The vegetables from the gardens were shared with church members and neighbors alike. Brown eventually built and sold 4 more houses on the same block. Most of the houses were constructed of cinder block with 2 front dormers for less than $10,000. In 2006, some 45–50 years later, the average market price was $190,000.
In April 2008, The Piedmont Area Preservation Alliance [http://preservecva.wordpress.com/about/] and the Charlottesville Architectural Review Board of Charlottesville, Virginia, recommended that Rev. Charles H. Brown's first non- residential structure, the Holy temple Church of God in Christ, be added to its list of important historic city buildings. In September 2008 the recommendation was accepted.
[http://preservecva.wordpress.com]
Building Innovator.
Rev. Brown became a licensed contractor in the city of Charlottesville in the mid-1950s. He built more than 50 residential and commercial structures as well as a dozen churches in Charlottesville and the surrounding counties. Because many were built for people with limited income and no means of financing such a project, Brown's challenge was to give his clients the best, as well as the most for their money. He became popular as a builder because he allowed his customers to make a small down payment and often financed the balance for them or sometimes even co-signed a note at the bank. His structure of choice was usually cinderblock. Many of his renovations or additions received a cosmetic coat of stucco. Brown’s reputation as a fair and honest man gained him the respect of both Whites and Blacks in the community. During his eulogy of Rev. Brown, Rev. Paul Coleman said "...Before there was urban renewal or redevelopment and housing, there was Rev. Brown."
Nearly all of his structures are still standing. Unlike houses that are constructed on a concrete slab today, Rev. Brown dug out the foundation; poured concrete footings and constructed the walls from the ground up. He studied drawings from books of plans that were available by mail. These books allowed him to use his natural artistic abilities sketch to out proposed house plans for his clients. He taught himself to read and interpret architectural drawings and blueprints. One of his most notable commercial structures was the EconoLodge, formerly the Econo Travel Lodge, at the University of Virginia [http://www.econolodgeuniversity.com/] which was demolished in 2013 http://insidecville.com/city/visionary-builder/ to create a green space. Having established himself in the business community as a master craftsman, Rev. Brown often did brickwork or concrete work for other contractors. As a skilled craftsman, he spent time teaching his laborers how to perform carpentry tasks and how to lay brick.
Rev. Brown's Ministry.
In 1960, Brown became Pastor of the church he had built some 13 years earlier. He and his sons, Ralph, an ordained Minister and Nehemiah Hunter Brown a musician (who became a minister in 1980); brought a community-oriented flavor to the worship experience. The elder Rev. Brown was extremely supportive of youth in and out of the church. He opened the doors of the church to Nehemiah and a contingent of University of Virginia students as well as to local high school students who wanted to start a choir. The high school students formed an Interdenominational Gospel Choir which later became the Dimensions of Gospel who later bridged the gap between UVA students and local towns people. The University of Virginia students had been denied the use of facilities on the school grounds for rehearsals, but under the leadership that they found at Holy Temple Church of God in Christ [http://cogic.net/cogiccms/default/, the renowned Black Voices [http://scs.student.virginia.edu/~bvoices/history.php] of the University of Virginia were born. Of note is the selection of the Holy Temple Church site for consideration to be added to the Register of Historical Buildings. The building was selected because of its enduring architecture and its cultural significance to the community.
During his tenure as Pastor, Brown also served as the District Superintendent over other churches in the Charlottesville and Waynesboro, Virginia areas. Most notably, he was known as a Bible scholar and teacher. Being a mild-mannered, soft-spoken man gave him an air of aloofness that often gave way to a fathomless wisdom and generosity. He was active as a Pastor, attending State and National meetings until shortly before his death from the complications of congestive heart failure in 1996. In 1998, shortly after his death, a Virginia State House of Delegates Joint Resolution [http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?981+ful+HJ408ER] was issued recognizing Reverend Brown's work and contributions to the community.

Point Lookout Light, Australia

Point Lookout Light is an active lighthouse on Point Lookout, a headland on North Stradbroke Island, Queensland, Australia. 
History.
A proposal for a lighthouse and a signal station on Point Lookout were made as early as 1825. A pilot station was built in 1825 elsewhere on the island, on Amity Point, lighting the South Passage into Moreton Bay. In 1848 this pilot station was also moved.
A lighthouse on Point Lookout was finally constructed in 1932, the first settlement at the point. The light source was a carbide lamp operated by acetylene gas, and a hut for storage of the gas cylinders was built at the close-by beach, which was to be named Cylinder Beach for this reason.
Structure and display.
The lighthouse is high, made of concrete and painted white. The current display is three white flashes every 15 seconds (Fl.(3)W. 15s).

Julio Gea-Banacloche

Julio Gea-Banacloche (born 1957) is Professor of Physics and currently the Head of Department of Physics at the University of Arkansas. He is notable for his contribution to the field of quantum information, where he has shown that the quantum mechanical nature of the fields used to manipulate the quantum information carriers (qubits) themselves might lead to unpredictable errors in the performance of the quantum logical operations. The lower bound on the size of these errors can be made smaller by increasing the energy of the control system. This has led Gea-Banacloche to predict a minimum energy requirement for quantum computation, which has given rise to some controversy.
Education.
He received his BS from Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, 1979; and obtained his PhD under Marlan O. Scully, 1985, on free-electron lasers, from the University of New Mexico with a thesis entitled: "Quantum Theory of the Free-Electron Laser."
Career.
In 1985-87, he served as a Research Associate, Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics. In 1988-90 he was a Staff Scientist, Instituto de Optica, Madrid, Spain. In 1990, he joined the University of Arkansas. He is an associate editor of "Physical Review A" and Fellow of the American Physical Society. He has carried out theoretical work in laser physics, quantum optics, and quantum information.

Lebuh AMJ

Lebuhraya Alor Gajah-Melaka Tengah-Jasin (Alor Gajah-Central Malacca-Jasin Highway),or popularly known as Lebuh AMJ (Alor Gajah - Central Malacca (Malacca) - Jasin), Federal Routes (Malaccan side) and (Johorean side) is a divided highway across Malacca state, Malaysia.
Route background.
Generally, the Lebuh AMJ runs north-south from Simpang Ampat to Malacca City before running from west-east from Malacca City to Muar. The entire Malaccan section of the Lebuh AMJ is signed as Federal Route 19, while the Johorean section of the highway is signed as Federal Route 5. Both route numbers overlap along the section between Sungai Duyong Intersection to Semabok Interchange. Meanwhile, the section between Malim and Semabok was formerly signed as Federal Route 191 but was later decommissioned in 2012 when the entire Lebuh AMJ was gazetted as FT19.
Historically, the Kilometre Zero of the Federal Route 19 was formerly located at Jalan Hang Tuah-Jalan Kubu intersection in Malacca City. After the Lebuh AMJ was gazetted as the Federal Route 19 in 2012, the Kilometre Zero of the Federal Route 19 was moved to Jalan Lama Kesang Intersection at Kesang, Johor.
History.
Lebuh AMJ was constructed due to the traffic congestion along the former Federal Routes 19 (Melaka-Simpang Ampat) and 5 (Melaka-Muar). The Simpang Ampat-Malim section of the highway was constructed as an upgrade of the existing Federal Route 19 route, while the Sungai Duyong-Kesang section of the highway was built as an entirely new route. The project was started from 2001 and was completed in 2007 with the total cost of RM505 million. Three interchanges were built along the highway, namely Semabok Interchange, Al Azim Interchange and Malim Jaya Interchange. The entire Lebuh AMJ was opened to traffic on 29 June 2007.
The Lebuh AMJ is notorious for having many unattended cows being left roaming along the Sungai Duyong-Kesang section, posing risks of accidents to motorists. To reduce accidents caused by the unattended cows, the state government of Melaka proposed safety measures such as street lights, high-mast lighting and fences to be installed along the section, which would cost RM5 million.
Features.
Notable features.
At most sections, the Lebuh AMJ was built under the JKR R5 road standard as a dual-carriageway highway with partial access control, allowing maximum speed limit of up to 90 km/h. This highway also features fast lane-to-slow lane U-turns.
Alternate routes.
None
Sections with motorcycle lanes.

Rhesaina

Rhesaina (Rhesaena) was a city in the late Roman province of Mesopotamia Secunda and a bishopric that was a suffragan of Dara
Rhesaina (Rhesaena, Resaena - numerous variations of the name appear in ancient authors) was an important town at the northern extremity of Mesopotamia, near the sources of the Chaboras (now the Khabur River. It was on the way from Carrhae to Nicephorium, about eighty miles from Nisibis and forty from Dara. Nearby, Gordian III fought the Persians in 243, at the battle of Resaena. It is now Ra's al-'Ayn, Syria.
Its coins show that it was a Roman colony from the time of Septimus Severus. The "Notitia dignitatum" (ed. Boecking, I, 400) represents it as under the jurisdiction of the governor or Dux of Osrhoene. Hierocles ("Synecdemus", 714, 3) also locates it in this province but under the name of Theodosiopolis; it had in fact obtained the favour of Theodosius the Great and taken his name. It was fortified by Justinian. In 1393 it was nearly destroyed by Tamerlane's troops. 
Bishops.
Le Quien (Oriens christianus, II, 979) mentions nine bishops of Rhesaena: 
The see is again mentioned in the 10th century in a Greek "Notitia episcopatuum" of the Patriarchate of Antioch (Vailhé, in "Echos d'Orient", X, 94). Le Quien (ibid., 1329 and 1513) mentions two Jacobite bishops: Scalita, author of a hymn and of homilies, and Theodosius (1035). About a dozen others are known.

Mike Baker (singer)

Mike Baker (September 2, 1963 – October 29, 2008) was the lead vocalist for the American progressive metal band Shadow Gallery.
Biography.
Baker was an integral part in the formation of Shadow Gallery in 1985 when the band was known as Sorcerer at the time of their inception. Heavily influenced by singers Alice Cooper, Ronnie James Dio of Black Sabbath, Rob Halford of Judas Priest and Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden, he integrated the musical attributes of these bands and vocalists into his style of singing.
Baker was primarily a self-taught vocalist, originally starting out as bass player during high school. Finding it difficult to sing and play bass simultaneously, he dropped the bass and switched over to lead vocal duties. Before forming Sorcerer, in the early 1980s he performed vocals on demos with local bands, including Nasty Nasty and Axxis.
Baker also performed guest vocals on the second single "Day Sixteen: Loser" from Ayreon's 2004 album "The Human Equation" and on the Original Cast of "Leonardo: The Absolute Man" amongst others.
According to an email sent to the Shadow Gallery News email list on October 31, 2008, Baker died after suffering a heart attack on October 29, 2008, at the age of 45.

Duyvis

Duyvis is a Dutch brand of salty snacks, of amongst others peanuts and nuts. Under the Duyvis brand also dip sauses are sold.
History.
The history of Duyvis begins with Teewis Duyvis, who inherited an oil mill from his uncle in the Netherlands in 1806. Such an oil mill was used for the production of cattle-fodder. The oil from the linseed was a just a by-product.
The grandson of Teewis, who was also called Teewis, took over the company in 1850. The company expanded with several oil mills and is called Teewis Duyvis Jansz., after the grandson of the first Teewis.
In 1880 Ericus Gerardus Duyvis, son of the second Teewis, builds a steam oil factory. He still produces mainly cattle-fodder. As of 1908 the company starts exporting linseed oil and in 1920 it starts with the refinery of the oil.
Between 1920 and 1930 the company becomes one of the largest oil exporting companies of the Netherlands. During the crisis years turnover declines and the company starts producing salad oil for consumers. During World War II the import of the necessary raw materials for the oil production declined. Therefore the company switches to other vegetable oils. The company keeps focusing on the consumer market and starts selling branded products. In 1957 Mayolande, a French daughter is founded, which sells products under the Bénénuts brand.
In 1958 the company receives the status of a ‘Royal’ company. In 1961 the company starts the with the production and selling of bagged peanuts and other nuts. In the same year the company is taken over by Akzo. This means the end of a 150 year old family business, and because of this takeover Duyvis loses its ‘Royal’ status. In 1987 Duyvis is taken over by Douwe Egberts. During these years a new factory is built in Zaandam and Duyvis becomes the largest peanut and nut brand in the Netherlands. In 2006 Douwe Egberts (at the time a part of Sara Lee) sells Duyvis to soft drink and snack manufacturer PepsiCo. PepsiCo is amongst others the owner of the brands Pepsi, Lay’s and Quaker.
In 2006 Duyvis celebrated its 200th anniversary.
Products.
Duyvis peanuts exist in many varieties. Besides plain peanuts there are peanuts that are roasted, marinated, sprinkled with herbs or in combination with other seeds and salty snacks. Some of the peanuts are covered with crunchy coatings of dough in different flavours. Besides peanuts, Duyvis produces noble nuts, some of them in combination with fruit and flavoured with herbs and spices.

1974 Huntsville Prison Siege

The 1974 Huntsville Prison Siege was an eleven-day prison uprising that took place from July 24 to August 3, 1974 at the Huntsville Walls Unit of the Texas Department of Corrections in Huntsville, Texas. The standoff was one of the longest hostage-taking sieges in United States history.
Siege.
From July 24 to August 3, 1974, Federico "Fred" Gomez Carrasco and two other inmates laid siege to the education/library building of the Walls Unit. “Fred” Carrasco, the most powerful heroin kingpin in South Texas, was serving a life sentence for the attempted murder of a police officer. He was also suspected in the murder of dozens of people in Mexico and Texas. Having smuggled pistols and ammunition into the prison, he and two other convicts took eleven prison workers and four inmates hostage. 
At the precise moment that a one o’clock work bell sounded, Carrasco walked up a ramp to the third-story library and forced several prisoners out at gunpoint. When two guards tried to go up the ramp, Carrasco fired at them. His two accomplices, who were also armed, immediately joined him in the library.
The prison warden and the director of the Texas Department of Corrections immediately began negotiations with the convicts. FBI agents and Texas Rangers arrived to assist them, as the media descended on Huntsville. Over the next several days the convicts made a number of demands, such as tailored suits, dress shoes, toothpaste, cologne, walkie-talkies and bulletproof helmets, all of which were provided promptly. With the approval of Texas Governor Dolph Briscoe, an armored getaway car was rolled into the prison courtyard. Carrasco claimed that they were planning to flee to Cuba and appeal to Fidel Castro.
After a grueling eleven-day standoff, the convicts finally made their desperate escape attempt just before 10 PM on Saturday August 3, 1974. They moved out of the library toward the waiting vehicle in a makeshift shield consisting of legal books taped to mobile blackboards that was later dubbed by the press the “Trojan Taco”. Inside the shield were the three convicts and four hostages, while eight other hostages ringed the exterior of the “taco”.
Acting on a prearranged plan, prison guards and Texas Rangers blasted the group with fire hoses. However, a rupture in the hose gave the convicts time to fatally shoot the two women hostages who had volunteered to join the convicts in the armored car. When prison officials returned fire, Carrasco committed suicide and one of his two accomplices was killed. Syndicated columnist Cal Thomas, who was an onsite reporter for Houston’s KPRC-TV at the time, later wrote, “It is a tragedy that two hostages died. It is a miracle all the rest lived.”
The two female hostages who died during the incident were Yvonne Beseda and Judy Standley.
Aftermath.
Ignacio Cuevas, the surviving perpetrator, received the Texas Department of Corrections Death Row ID#526. Cuevas was received as a death row prisoner on May 30, 1975. Cuevas was held at the Ellis Unit, and he was executed on May 23, 1991. Cuevas's last meal request consisted of chicken dumplings, steamed rice, sliced bread, black-eyed peas, and iced tea. Cuevas's last words were "I’m going to a beautiful place. O.K., Warden, roll ‘em."
Cultural references.
Tex-Mex musician Joe "King" Carrasco (born Joe Teusch) adopted the drug king's surname.
Los Socios de San Antonio have a tribute song entitled "La Muerte de Fred Gomez Carrasco."

Mitsubishi Motors concepts

Mitsubishi Motors concepts are those prototype and concept cars exhibited around the world by Mitsubishi Motors. In common with other automakers, Mitsubishi has used concept cars as both show cars—stylistically adventurous motor show exhibits with no production intentions behind them—or as precursors of future models destined for mass production.
The first Mitsubishi concept car was a two-seat convertible version of the Colt 600, which was introduced at the 9th Tokyo Motor Show in 1962 by Shin Mitsubishi Heavy-Industries, one of the companies which would combine to form Mitsubishi Motors in 1970. Although the company had no intention of marketing it, the convertible helped attract the public's attention to the more mundane sedan.
Latterly, Mitsubishi has exploited its heritage in its motor show exhibits, using vehicles from its past displayed in parallel with new model introductions. The Colt 600 convertible was brought out from the Mitsubishi Museum in 2005, alongside the new cabriolet version of the Mitsubishi Colt which debuted at the 75th Geneva Motor Show. The following year they revisited the theme by promoting the newest version of their Mitsubishi Pajero sport utility vehicle alongside a 1934 Mitsubishi PX33, a pre-World War II military prototype which was the first Japanese sedan equipped with four-wheel drive. They took the same approach a third time in 2007, with the tenth iteration of the rallying-derived Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution. It was exhibited at the North American International Auto Show in 2007 alongside the Mitsubishi Lancer 1600 GSR, which gained renown after winning the Safari Rally in 1974.

Christie's World Encyclopedia of Champagne &amp; Sparkling Wine

Christie’s World Encyclopedia of Champagne & Sparkling Wine is an encyclopedia written by Tom Stevenson, published by Absolute Press, which is devoted to subjects relating to Champagne and sparkling wine. The foreword is written by Michael Broadbent. A smaller reduced version, "Champagne & Sparkling Wine Guide", is published in the soft cover format.
When first published in 1998, the book became the only wine book to warrant a leader in a UK national newspaper ("The Guardian", October 14, 1998), for the first time revealing a 17th-century document proving that the English used a second fermentation to convert still wines into sparkling at least six years before Dom Pérignon arrived at the Abbey of Hautvillers, and nearly 40 years before the French claim that sparkling Champagne was invented. Although "Le Figaro" accused Stevenson of “trying to burn Dom Pérignon”, the French were prompt to award it The Best Wine Book of 1998 at the Salon International du Livre Gourmand in Périgueux.
Ranked among its "Top Ten Best Wine Books" by "The Independent" it has been characterised as "still the best guide to fizz”, "authoritative, opinionated and comprehensive", and a vital purchase for any Champagne lover.
Content.
The book opens with "A Little History", accounting numerous occurrences throughout time of accidental sparkling wine, and the first documented evidence of a deliberately produced sparkling wine, as recorded by Christopher Merret. In Merret’s eight-page paper "Some observations concerning the ordering of wines", which he presented to the newly formed Royal Society on December 17, 1662, he states “our wine-coopers of recent times use vast quantities of sugar and molasses to all sorts of wines to make them drink brisk and sparkling”. Stevenson explains why the French did not have the technology to produce any sparkling wine in 1662, and how it was almost inevitable that the English did. He explains the paradox of "sparkling champaign", which is mentioned by George Etheredge in The Man of Mode in 1676, yet did not exist in France until the late 1690s. The documentary evidence presented is a significant aspect of "Christie’s World Encyclopedia of Champagne & Sparkling Wine", though only a part of it.
An overview of the six different methods of sparkling wine production is provided in "How Sparkling Wines Are Made", exploring the most important of these in the sections "A Step-by-Step Guide to "Méthode Champenoise" and "The Elusive Quality Factor". Argumenting that intrinsic quality exists beyond the personal preference of taste, Stevenson analyses what precisely contributes to the intrinsic quality of a sparkling wine, starting with establishing the vineyard, from site selection to the varieties of grape, and how they should be grown, harvested, and pressed, looking at ripeness levels and acidity, through every aspect of the production process.
Stevenson offers an argument why chaptalisation might actually contribute to Champagne’s perceived "lean" structure. He discusses ideal fermentation temperatures to give a "fast and furious first fermentation" and a long "low-temperature second fermentation", the pros and cons of malolactic fermentation, what the "assemblage" is, how to obtain good mousse retention, the importance of small bubbles, what affects their size, the effects of autolysis, ageing on lees, adding a "dosage" and post-disgorgement ageing. Stevenson also tests out nine Riedel glasses on 100 different Champagnes and sparkling wines, offering his conclusions alongside Riedel’s official design purpose.
The main section of this book consists of a country-by-country, region-by-region assessment of sparkling wines, with every producer rated on a 100-point scale, and all their wines given a star wine rating (three star maximum). Champagne receives the largest coverage, occupying 98 pages, but 10 other French regions (Alsace, Loire, Burgundy, Bordeaux, Limoux, others) receive 45 pages, while 141 pages covers the rest of the world (Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Austria, Southeast Europe, other European, South Africa, The United States, California, Others USA, Canada, South America, Australia, New Zealand, Asia). These pages hold technical data and the historical development of sparkling wines locally, as well as Stevenson’s own critiques of the producers, the lowest rating of which is 35, demonstrating his policy to utilise all 100 points of the scale.

Progressive Librarians Guild

The Progressive Librarians Guild was founded in New York City in January 1990 by librarians concerned with the library profession's "rapid drift into dubious alliances with business and the information industry, and into complacent acceptance of service to an unquestioned political, economic and cultural status quo," according to the organization's statement of purpose. The PLG addresses issues especially relating to Librarianship and human rights. 
"Progressive Librarian: A Journal for Critical Studies & Progressive Politics in Librarianship".
The Progressive Librarians Guild publishes the journal Progressive Librarian" , a forum for critical perspectives in librarianship and information studies. The journal features articles, book reviews, bibliographies, reports, and documents. The first issue of "Progressive Librarian" (PL), published in the summer of 1990 on the heels of the founding of PLG, was given its title by Sanford Berman who exclaimed that the journal of PLG could have no other title than "Progressive Librarian" (the subtitle, "A Journal of Critical Studies and Progressive Politics in Librarianship", came later in 1998 with issue #14). The first issue was to be a contribution to the debate taking place within the American Library Association (ALA) in which the upper ranks of power in ALA were attempting to overturn the association's official support of the cultural boycott against apartheid institutions in South Africa. An index for 1990-1999 was published in 2007.
Miriam Braverman Memorial Prize.
The Guild also bestows the Miriam Braverman Memorial Prize to library and information science students attending a graduate level program in the United States or Canada who submit a paper based on an aspect of the social responsibilities of librarians, libraries, or librarianship.
Union Library Workers.
The Guild sponsors the blog Union Library Workers and publishes an annual review of librarians and labor in its journal. The "Progressive Librarian" article, "Collective Bargaining is a Human Right," summarized librarian involvement in 2011 public sector union protests to defend collective bargaining in Wisconsin.
PLG Discussion List.
The Guild sponsors a discussion list, PLGnet.
Statements and Resolutions.
The Guild has issued statements and resolutions such as:
Joint Conference of Librarians of Color.
The Progressive Librarians Guild was represented at the 2006 Joint Conference of Librarians of Color (JCLC) with a panel on Librarians and Social Movements. For the 2012 JCLC the "Progressive Librarian" #38/39 included a feature on the conference and the five caucus associations of color.
United States Social Forum 2007.
In 2007 members of the Progressive Librarians Guild participated in the United States Social Forum (USSF) in Atlanta. In homage to the USSF's statement on language accessibility, PLG's new banner read "Library" on one side and "Biblioteca" on the other for the Opening March that launched the first ever regional social forum in the United States. The Librarians program was held at the Auburn Avenue Research Library, the second largest collection of African-American materials in the U.S., located on the very street that is home to the Ebenezer Baptist Church and the gravesites of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Mrs. Coretta Scott King. PLG members collected materials from the USSF for the Labadie Collection at the University of Michigan.

Leon Douglass

Leon Forrest Douglass (March 12, 1869 – September 7, 1940) was an American inventor and co-founder of the Victor Talking Machine Company who registered approximately fifty patents, mostly for film and sound recording techniques.
Life and professional career.
Douglass was born in rural Nebraska, near present-day Syracuse. His parents were Seymour James Douglass, a millwright and carpenter, and Mate (Fuller) Douglass. He attended grammar school in Lincoln, Nebraska, was apprenticed to a printer, at eleven was working as a telegraph messenger, and by seventeen was telephone exchange manager for the Nebraska Telephone Company in Seward.
Phonograph.
In 1888 Douglass saw a phonograph for the first time and was fascinated. He made his own and took it to Omaha to show it to E.A. Benson, President of the Nebraska Phonograph Co., who hired him as the company’s agent for the western part of the state. In 1889 he invented a nickel-in-the-slot attachment for the phonograph. Benson paid $500 for the patent and promoted Douglass to a job with the Chicago Central Phonograph Company, which he also owned and that was part of the Thomas Edison-affiliated North American Phonograph Company, distributor for the Edison Phonograph. In the early 1890s Douglass invented a machine for duplicating phonograph cylinders and became known as "Duplicate Doug." He sold this patent to Edward Easton, director of the American Graphophone Company and president of the Columbia Phonograph Company, moved to Washington D.C. and worked for Easton briefly before returning to the Chicago Central Phonograph Company as a manager in 1892. He was elected Vice President and Treasurer, and secured a concession for a hundred slot phonographs at the World's Columbian Exposition, better known as the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. At the fair he also met Peter Bacigalupi of Lima, Peru and San Francisco; he shipped phonographs to Lima for him and later traveled to San Francisco where he met his step-sister Victoria Adams, whom he married in 1897. After the Chicago fair closed, Douglass bought the hundred slot phonographs and secured a concession for the 1894 Midwinter Fair in San Francisco; this concession and the phonographs were ultimately taken over by Bacigalupi, who then used the machines to open a phonograph arcade on Market Street. 
One business opportunity that Douglass was unable to bring to fruition was a contract to exhibit Thomas Edison’s kinetoscope at the World’s Fair. This would have been the first public exhibition of moving pictures, but Edison objected to a clause in the fair contract requiring a bond guaranteeing that the exhibit would be ready by the opening of the fair.
Victrola.
In August 1900, after a brief period working in Philadelphia for the Berliner Gramophone Co., which was closed by a legal action, Douglass agreed to go into business with Eldridge R. Johnson, who owned a machine shop in Camden, New Jersey and had supplied machines to Berliner. The company started doing business in September 1900 as The Consolidated Talking Machine Company but changed to using Johnson’s name because of a conflict with a Berliner company name. On October 3, 1901 it incorporated as the Victor Talking Machine Company. Douglass said it was named after his wife, but others think it more likely Johnson chose the name to celebrate his engineering and legal triumphs. 
As Vice President and General Manager at Victor, Douglass was totally responsible for publicity and sales at Victor and therefore is responsible for popularizing the image of the dog listening to “His Master’s Voice”. He also developed and patented the cabinet and stand that became the Victrola. As he wrote in his unpublished autobiography:
This made him the inventor of what was by the 1920s the most popular home entertainment device in America.
In fall 1906, a few months after the birth of his son Eldridge, Douglass had a nervous breakdown followed by other health problems and became unable to work. He moved his family from Philadelphia to San Rafael, California. He wrote in his autobiography:
Motion pictures.
The other large area of Douglass’ technical innovations was motion pictures. Inspired by an Ives Kromskop that he bought in 1898, he began experimenting with color in 1912, and in 1916 patented a process for filming in “natural color” (as opposed to hand-tinting), one of the forerunners of Technicolor. He wrote in his autobiography: 
The April 15, 1918 issue of "The Talking Machine World" described “Mr. Douglas' device” as “an inexpensive attachment that may be affixed to any motion picture camera and which permits of the production of a film containing a series of images so colored as to give, when projected, a moving picture in natural colors, without the use of the rotary colored shutter usually required.”
In 1918 Douglass produced "Cupid Angling", which may be the first American feature-length color film. It starred Ruth Roland, with Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks making guest appearances. In March 1921 "The Talking Machine World" stated: 
In 1921 Douglass moved his family to Menlo Park, California, where he bought a 52-room mansion that had been built by Theodore Payne, a San Francisco hardware manufacturer. Douglass named it Victoria Manor, in honor of his wife. He installed a workshop with lathes, milling machines, and drill presses in the basement, movie equipment on the first floor, and his laboratory workshop on the mezzanine. Since 1945 the house (now in Atherton) has been owned by the Menlo School and Menlo College and called Douglass Hall.
In 1932, at the invitation of the Smithsonian Institution, Douglass participated in a scientific expedition off Easter Island, where he filmed at depths up to 1,500 feet using his submarine cameras and also an underwater “flashlight” that he also patented. In the mid-1930s he participated in a classified US Navy operation filming the ocean floor near Pearl Harbor and other strategic sites in Hawaii.

History.
The station was assigned call letters WTFX on June 28, 1991. On April 19, 2002, the station changed its call sign to WTFX-FM, on August 19, 2005 to WLUE, and an application was filed as of September 3, 2009, to change the call sign to WLGX.
This station initially signed on with a classic rock format, which shifted more towards mainstream rock and then active rock by 2002. In 2005, the station shifted to a classic hits leaning variety hits format, called Louie FM. On September 3, 2009, in response to slipping market share, the station decided to shift towards a 90's pop/rock centered offering called Gen X Radio. According to a press release which was issued hours before the format change, the station promises to feature music from "grunge, hip-hop, hair bands and boy bands".
At 3pm on Nov 11, 2011, Gen X Radio dropped their 90's Hits format for Christmas Music, leaving listeners unsure of whether their Gen X format would return after the Christmas season or not. However, as the station had promised, the format returned after the holidays.
In 2013, it happened again except for having it play alongside the regular music, this time with the station airing a separate webstream of its full format under the same name on IHeartRadio, likely meaning the station's format will return after the holidays.

Friendship, Oklahoma

Friendship is an incorporated town located five miles east and four miles north of Altus in Jackson County, Oklahoma, United States. It had an estimated population of 16 in 2007.
History.
Friendship, a rural Southwestern Oklahoma community, has a unique, colorful history. At various times, Southwestern Oklahoma was claimed by England, France, Spain, Mexico and the Republic of Texas. Before Oklahoma became the 46th state, Friendship was located in Indian Territory, Oklahoma Territory and Greer County, Texas.
Southwestern Oklahoma was once part of a vast sea of grass stretching as far as the eye could see, populated by millions of buffalo and claimed by Texas, but ruled by the Comanches and Kiowas. After the last free bands of Comanches and Kiowas were confined to the reservation at Fort Sill in 1875, the area became safe for cattle drives. From 1876 to 1892, millions of longhorns were driven from Texas to Dodge City and Ogallala, Nebraska, over the Western Cattle Trail which passed through the middle of what is now the Town of Friendship.
In 1880, giant Texas cattle companies, attracted by the rich grazing land, started moving into Southwestern Oklahoma. At that time, the area was claimed by Texas as Greer County, Texas, based on its assertion that the North Fork of the Red River was the main channel of the Red River. In 1890, Oklahoma Territory was created, and a lawsuit was filed by the United States to resolve the boundary dispute. In 1896, the Supreme Court determined that the area was a part of Oklahoma Territory, not Texas, and it was opened for homesteading in 1897.
Over the years, a number of communities, including Clabber Flat, Alfalfa, Lone Oak, Ricks, Riverside, Pleasant Point and Navajoe, were settled in the Friendship area. Clabber Flat School, which opened in 1899, became the first Friendship School, changing its name to Friendship because of its association with the Friendship Baptist Church, which was organized and often met at the school.
Friendship was originally known as Alfalfa and was the site of the Alfalfa Post Office from 1903 to 1905. But, in 1908, the Friendship Baptist Church was built at Alfalfa, and the town soon became known as Friendship. In 1920, the Friendship and Navajoe School Districts, and parts of the Lone Oak and Riverside School Districts, consolidated to form a new Friendship Consolidated District. In 1935, Pleasant Point consolidated with Friendship, and in later years, students were gained from the Ozark and Headrick School Districts.
Friendship thrived during the first part of the 20th century. At its peak, the town included two service stations, two grocery stores, two cotton gins, two blacksmith shops, a garage, a hardware store, a barber shop, a cafe, a feed mill, a domino parlor and as many as twenty residences. In addition to the Friendship Baptist Church within the town, the Midway Methodist Church was constructed in 1913, one mile east of the town.
After World War II, improved transportation allowed area residents to take their trade to Altus, and there was a pronounced exodus from the farm to the city. One by one, the businesses in Friendship closed. Then, after the Friendship School burned in 1962, Friendship and Warren schools were consolidated to form a new school district known as Navajo, which built a new school midway between the two towns in 1963. 1982 marked the closing of the Midway Methodist Church.
Today.
Incorporated in 1999, Friendship has seen a recent surge in residential construction in its vicinity. However, only the Friendship Baptist Church, a community center (which houses the Friendship Volunteer Fire Department) and a few residences actually exist within the town limits.

After serving for five months as curate at Sasbach, and for a year as assistant at Freiburg Cathedral, he returned to Hohenzollern, and, from 1835 to 1838, was curate at Steinhofen near Hechingen. In 1838 he obtained civic rights in Württemberg, and as a priest of the Diocese of Rottenburg, he was pastor first in Dotternhausen; 31 January 1839, at Rosawangen; 11 May 1841, at Risstissen; from 1851 also school inspector in Ehingen. 
On 12 August 1867, the Catholic theological faculty of the University of Tübingen granted him the degree of Doctor of Theology. In May, 1877, he retired to Ober-Dischingen.
Works.
In 1857 he founded the "Rottenburger Kirchenblatt", which he published for three years. From 1860 he edited the "Katholisches Schulwochenblatt" Spaichingen), which, together with Hermann Rolfus, he continued as "Süddeutsches katholisches Schulwochenblatt" (1861–67), and with J. Haug and Fr. J. Knecht as "Magazin für Pädagogik" (1868–72). 
His major work was the editing with Rolfus of the "Real-Encyclopädie des Erziehungs- und Unterrichtswesens nach katholischen Principien" (4 vols., Mainz, 1863–66; 2nd ed., 1872–1874; a 5th vol., "Ergänzungsband", was published by Rolfus alone in 1884 after Pfister's death). Among Pfister's other writings were: 
he also compiled several prayer-books.

Alessandro Vespignani

Alessandro Vespignani is an Italian physicist and Sternberg Distinguished Professor of Physics, Computer Science and Health Sciences at Northeastern University.
Vespignani is known for his work on complex networks, and particularly for work on the applications of network theory to the spread of disease and for studies of the topological properties of the Internet. He is author, together with Romualdo Pastor-Satorras, of the book "Evolution and Structure of the Internet". Together with Alain Barrat and Marc Barthelemy he has published in 2008 the monograph "Dynamical Processes on Complex Networks". He is currently completing a book on "Self-organized criticality and avalanche phenomena" with S. Zapperi for Oxford University Press. Vespignani is an elected fellow of the American Physical Society and is serving in the board/leadership of a variety of professional associations, institutions and journals.
Career and Research.
Alessandro Vespignani received his undergraduate degree and Ph.D., both in physics and both from the University of Rome “La Sapienza”, in 1990 and 1993 respectively. Following postdoctoral research at Yale University and Leiden University, he worked at the International Center for Theoretical Physics in Trieste for five years, and briefly at the University of Paris-Sud, before moving to Indiana University in 2004. Vespignani has worked in a number of areas of physics, including characterization of non-equilibrium phenomena and phase transitions, and collaborated with, among others, Luciano Pietronero and Benoit Mandelbrot. He is best known, however, for his work on complex networks. He describes his current research as being focused on "interdisciplinary application of statistical and numerical simulation methods in the analysis of epidemic and spreading phenomena and the study of biological, social and technological networks."
Of particular note is his work with Romualdo Pastor-Satorras in which the two demonstrated that for a disease propagating on a random scale-free network the transmission probability or infectivity necessary to sustain an outbreak tends to zero in the limit of large network size. In practice this means that such a disease will never die out, no matter what steps are taken to reduce the probability of its transmission between individuals.

Planet of the Dead

"Planet of the Dead" is the second of the Doctor Who (2008–2010 specials) of the British science fiction television series "Doctor Who" that was simultaneously broadcast on BBC One and BBC HD on 11 April 2009. It was the second of five special episodes (including the animated serial "Dreamland") broadcast throughout 2009 and early 2010, which served as lead actor David Tennant's denouement as the Tenth Doctor. He is joined in the episode by actress Michelle Ryan, who plays Lady Christina de Souza, a one-off companion to the Doctor. The episode was co-written by Russell T Davies and Gareth Roberts, the first writing partnership since the show's revival in 2005.
The episode depicts Christina fleeing the police from a museum robbery by boarding a bus that accidentally travels from London to the desert planet of San Helios, trapping her, the Doctor, and several passengers on board the damaged vehicle. After the bus driver dies trying to return to Earth, the Unified Intelligence Taskforce, headed by Captain Erisa Magambo (Noma Dumezweni) and scientific advisor Malcolm Taylor (Lee Evans), attempt to return the bus while preventing a race of metallic stingray aliens from posing a threat to Earth. At the end of the episode, one of the passengers delivers a warning to the Doctor which foreshadows the remaining three specials.
"Planet of the Dead" is the first "Doctor Who" episode to be filmed in high definition, after a positive reaction to the visual quality of spin-off series "Torchwood" and the financial viability of HDTV convinced the production team to switch formats. To ensure that the desert scenes looked as realistic as possible, the production team filmed in Dubai for three days, sending several props—most notably, a 1980 double-decker Bristol VR bus—to the United Arab Emirates for filming. After the bus was unintentionally damaged in Dubai by a shipping container, Davies rewrote the script to explain the damage in the narrative.
The audience gave the episode an Appreciation Index of 88—considered excellent.
Plot.
A young thrill-seeking burglar, Lady Christina de Souza, steals a gold chalice once belonging to King Æthelstan from a London museum and narrowly evades the police by hopping on a 200 bus. The Doctor, who is tracking down a wormhole, joins her shortly before the bus suddenly passes through the wormhole and arrives on the desert planet of San Helios. The Doctor shows the passengers the wormhole and deduces the bus protected them like a Faraday cage. The bus driver tries to go through despite the Doctor's warnings. Seeing the driver's skeleton coming out on the other side of the wormhole, the police call in UNIT, commanded by Captain Erisa Magambo and aided by scientific adviser Malcolm Taylor. The Doctor manages to contact UNIT on a passenger's mobile phone and talks to Malcolm, who impresses him with his understanding of the wormhole.
The Doctor and Christina quickly get to know the handful of other passengers on the bus: Angela, Barclay, Nathan, Lou and Carmen, who has low-level psychic abilities. The Doctor and Christina decide to scout the planet, spotting an approaching storm, while Nathan and Barclay try to fix the bus. The Doctor and Christina encounter a couple of Tritovores, a species resembling anthropomorphic flies, who take them to their wrecked spaceship.
The Tritovores explain that they were making a routine goods collection with San Helios when they crashed, and that the planet very recently housed a hundred billion inhabitants and a thriving ecosystem. At the request of the Doctor, the Tritovores send a probe to investigate approaching cloud and discover a large swarm of stingray-like aliens who create wormholes by flying at terrific speed around planets, and are protected by their metal exoskeletons. They destroy the ecosystems of all the planets they visit as their biological imperative. The Doctor suspects that Earth may be the stingrays' next target due to the wormhole they passed through before, and makes to hasten their return to Earth.
Christina uses her burglary skills to retrieve a crystal that powers the spaceship, together with the clamps attached to it. This awakens the stingrays that had caused the ship to crash in the first place, costing the life of the two Tritovores. Captain Magambo, who has also worked out that the earth is threatened, orders Malcolm to close the wormhole but he refuses even at gunpoint to sacrifice the Doctor.
The Doctor throws away the crystal and attaches the clamps to the bus's wheels and steering wheel. He finds the systems are incompatible and convinces Christina to let him use gold from the chalice of Æthelstan to connect the bus to the spaceship technology. The Doctor reveals that the clamps are anti-gravity clamps. This allows the bus to fly through the wormhole, with the stingrays in hot pursuit. Taylor closes the wormhole but not before three of the stingrays pass through it. After UNIT shoots down the stingrays and the passengers have been debriefed, Christina pleads with the Doctor to let her travel with him, but he refuses because he has no wish to lose another companion.
The characters part ways again. The Doctor recommends that UNIT hire Barclay and Nathan. Christina is arrested by the police for the theft and Carmen has a premonition that visibly unnerves the Doctor:
Production.
Writing and casting.
Russell T Davies co-wrote the episode with Gareth Roberts, the first writing partnership for the show since its 2005 revival. "Planet of the Dead" was a departure from Roberts' usual stories—Roberts had previously only written pseudo-historical stories—and instead consisted of wild science fiction elements from his literary career and teenage imagination. The episode had no clear concept—such as Shakespeare and witches in "The Shakespeare Code" or Agatha Christie and a murder mystery in "The Unicorn and the Wasp"—and instead was a deliberate "clash concepts with many disparate elements". Roberts explained he was cautious to ensure that each element had to "feel precise and defined ... like we meant that", citing the serial "Arc of Infinity" as an example where such control was not enforced. The episode includes a common feature of Davies' writing in that there is no clear antagonist: the Tritovore are eventually sympathetic to the protagonists and the stingrays are only following their biological imperative.
Unlike the Christmas specials, the theme of Easter was not emphasised in the story; the episode only contained a "fleeting mention" of the holiday instead of "robot bunnies carrying baskets full of deadly egg bombs". The episode's tone word—"joyous"—was influenced by Davies' realisation that "every story since 'The Fires of Pompeii' a bittersweet quality" and his subsequent desire to avoid the recurring theme. The starting point for the story was Roberts' first novel "The Highest Science". Davies liked the image of a train on a desert planet and rewrote the train as a bus. Davies nevertheless emphasised it was not an "adaptation as such" because tangential elements were constantly being
conceived and added.
Michelle Ryan's casting as Lady Christina de Souza was confirmed by the BBC on 23 January 2009 and attracted media attention owing to Ryan's recent relatively high-profile roles in "EastEnders", "Jekyll", "Bionic Woman" and "Merlin". Ryan stated that she is "a huge fan of "Doctor Who" and very excited to be joining David Tennant and the "Doctor Who" team." Davies commented that "Michelle is one of the most sought after young actors in the country" and that they were "delighted to announce that she [would be joining the team." Ryan described her casting as a "real honour", noting that she "love the character".
Ryan was rumoured to be in line for a role as full-time companion to the incoming Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith) and her casting in "Planet of the Dead", combined with her previous working history with incoming Executive Producer Steven Moffat - the two working together on "Jekyll", fuelled speculation that she might return to "Doctor Who" accompanying the Eleventh Doctor in Series 5. Ryan herself has said that she is open for a return to the character, however, stating that she is a "commitment phobe" at the moment and with regards to her character she views her as "someone who is around for this one-time adventure"." It had been reported that Ryan auditioned to replace Billie Piper in the companion role when her character, Rose Tyler, left in 2006, but was unsuccessful. Ryan subsequently stated that this was false.
Ryan was interviewed by BBC News about her role as Lady Christina. Ryan praised her colleagues and the "family atmosphere" on set and described "Doctor Who" as "really something special to do". On 9 April 2009, Ryan guested on "Steve Wright in the Afternoon" on BBC Radio 2 and on "The Justin Lee Collins Show" on ITV2 to promote "Planet of the Dead". After a showing of a trailer for the episode on "The Justin Lee Collins Show", Ryan described the "fantastic" time she had filming in Cardiff and in Dubai.
Ryan's character Lady Christina de Souza is an adrenaline junkie and thief. Christina is a typical "Doctor Who" companion, Davies electing to draw parallels from the Time Lady Romana rather than new series companion Rose Tyler. Roberts described her as an "adventuress" who is "upper class and glam, suited and booted, and extremely intelligent" which the Doctor could relate to because they both rejected their heritages. The episode's director James Strong described the character as reverting to a traditional romantic-based companionship—rather than the platonic companionship of Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) in the fourth series—while still being a unique companion:
Comedian Lee Evans plays Professor Malcolm Taylor, a UNIT scientist devoted to his predecessor, the Doctor. Davies created Evans' character to serve as a foil for Noma Dumezweni's pragmatic character Captain Erisa Magambo, who previously appeared in the episode "Turn Left". Roberts noted after writing the episode that Evans' character had unintentionally become a "loving" caricature of "Doctor Who" fandom.
The episode was influenced by several works: Davies described "Planet of the Dead" as "a great big adventure, a little bit Indiana Jones, a little bit "Flight of the Phoenix", a little bit "Pitch Black"."; the relationship between the Doctor and Christina was influenced by 1960s films such as "Charade" and "Topkapi", which included Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn "being witty and sophisticated together, and then running for their lives"; and the Tritovore were influenced by 1950s and 1970s science fiction B-movies such as "The Fly" and
Davies' habit of including aliens that were recognisable to the audience as animals from Earth, such as the Judoon. Carmen's warning evoked memories of the Ood's warning to the Doctor and Donna in the fourth series episode "Planet of the Ood". Tennant explained the prophecy meant that the Doctor's "card become marked" and the three specials would thus be darker—characterising "Planet of the Dead" as the "last time the Doctor gets to have any fun"—and that the subject of the prophecy was not the obvious answer:
Filming.
Pre-production on the four specials started on 20 November 2008—four days before scheduled—because the episode's overseas filming in Dubai required the extra planning time. Two weeks later, the production team was on a recce for the special and the final draft of the script was completed. The production team examined overseas locations to film the episode because they wanted the scenery to feel "real" and thought that they would be unable to film on a Welsh beach in winter. After examining countries such as Morocco and Tunisia, the production
team decided to film in Dubai because the area was more amicable to the filming industry and viable filming locations were nearer to urban areas than other locations.
Production began on 19 January in Wales. The special was the first "Doctor Who" episode to be filmed in high-definition television resolution. The move to HD had previously been resisted for two major reasons: when the show was revived in 2005, high-definition television had not been adopted by an adequate portion of the audience to be financially viable; and special effects were considerably more expensive to create in high-definition than in standard-definition. "Planet of the Dead" was
used as a switch to HD because of the show's reduced schedule in 2009 and because the filming crew had become experienced with the equipment while they were filming "Torchwood".
Filming began at the National Museum Cardiff, which doubled for the history museum depicted in the episode's first scene. To portray the tunnel the bus travelled into, the Queen's Gate Tunnel of the A4232 road in Butetown was closed for four nights to accommodate filming. The last major piece of filming in Wales took place in the closed Mir (formerly Alphasteel) steelworks in Newport, which doubled almost unaltered for the Tritovore spaceship. Scenes set in London's Oxford Street where filmed at St Mary Street, Cardiff. Filming took place at the peak of the February 2009 Great Britain snowfall, where the sub-zero temperatures slowed filming and had a visible effect on the cast. To accommodate for the adverse conditions, Davies included a line in the script that specified that the Tritovore spaceship cooled as external temperatures increase.
Filming in Dubai took place in mid-February 2009. Two weeks previously, one of the two 1980 Bristol VR double-decker buses bought for filming had been substantially damaged when a crane accidentally dropped a container in Dubai City Port. After an emergency discussion by the production team, they agreed that the damage was unintentionally artistic and decided to include the damaged bus in the episode; instead of shipping the spare bus from Cardiff—which would have delayed the already hurried filming
schedule—the production team decided to partially reconstruct the bus in Dubai, damage the spare bus in Cardiff to match the bus in Dubai, and rewrite part of the script to accommodate and mention the damage to the bus. James Strong recalled the reaction of the production team to the damage to the bus in an issue of "Doctor Who Magazine":
The damaged bus was not the only problem to filming in Dubai: the first of the three days was afflicted by a sandstorm which left most of the footage shot unusable. The production team then struggled to complete three days of filming in two days; the last day was compared to "filming "Lawrence of Arabia"". To complete the episode's filming, interior scenes in the bus were filmed in a studio in Wales. To disguise the fact they were using a translite, a 360-degree background image, Strong utilised often-avoided techniques such as muddied windows and lens flares; the latter also served to create a warmer environment for the viewer. After filming ended, editing and post-processing took place until two days before transmission, leaving the BBC to resort to using an unfinished copy to market the episode.
200th story.
"Planet of the Dead" was advertised as "Doctor Who"'s 200th story. Writer Russell T Davies admitted that the designation was arbitrary and debatable, based upon how fans counted the unfinished serial "Shada", the season-long fourteen-part serial "The Trial of a Time Lord", and the third series finale consisting of "Utopia", "The Sound of Drums" and "Last of the Time Lords". Davies personally disagreed about counting "The Trial of a Time Lord" as one serial—arguing that it "felt like four stories" to him—and grouping "Utopia" with its following episodes, but agreed that it was only an opinion which did not override any others. Gareth Roberts inserted a reference to the landmark—specifically, the bus number is 200—and Davies emailed the show's publicity team to advertise the special as such. "Doctor Who Magazine"s editor Tom Spilsbury acknowledged the controversy in the magazine's 407th issue, which ran a reader survey of all 200 stories.
Broadcast and reception.
Overnight figures estimated that the special was watched by 8.41 million people, a 39.6% share of the audience. An additional 184,000 watched the programme on BBC HD, the channel's highest rating at that time. The initial showing had an Appreciation Index of 88: considered excellent. A BBC One repeat, two days later, gained an overnight figure of 1.8 million viewers. The special was therefore the second most watched programme of the day, beaten only by the premiere of the new series of "Britain's Got Talent". The final viewing figure
for the initial broadcast was 9.54 million viewers on BBC One and 200,000 viewers on BBC HD, making it the fifth most watched programme of the week and the most watched programme aired on BBC HD at that time. Including repeats in the following week and viewings on the BBC iPlayer, 13.89 million viewers watched the episode in total.
The episode received average critical reviews. Simon Brew of science fiction blog "Den of Geek" said the episode was "by turns ambitious and predictable" but "still quite entertaining". The first part of the review mentioned an objection from his wife that the bus trapped in the sand " really fake", despite the episode being actually filmed in Dubai, and then mentioned Brew's appreciation of the concept of people stranded in the desert and concluded that "made a fair fist of it". Brew positively reviewed Michelle Ryan's performance—comparing her performance to be on par to her role in "Bionic Woman" rather than her role as Zoe Slater in "EastEnders"—and Lee Evans' performance as Malcolm Taylor, calling him the highlight of the episode because of his dialogue. He closed his review by saying that "'Planet of the Dead' was passable enough": he thought it "never really gelled" for him; but he thought it was overall entertaining and was excited
for the remaining three specials as a result of Carmen's prophecy.
Charlie Jane Anders of io9 "mostly loved 'Planet Of The Dead'", commenting that it was a standard Russell T Davies script:
She compared it to two previous episodes, "The Impossible Planet" and "Midnight", both of which she enjoyed. She criticised three aspects of the episode: Lady Christina, who was the "first T Davies heroine who actually filled with revulsion", leaving her hoping that the character would be killed off-screen, Malcolm's reluctance to close the wormhole and the implausibility of only three stingrays travelling through it. She thought that the episode was "a pretty solid adventure with a cool set of monsters".
Ben Rawson-Jones of entertainment website Digital Spy gave the episode two stars out of five. He characterised the episode as being "as hollow as a big chocolate Easter egg" because it was "lacking in the enthralling drama and compelling characterisation that has been the lynchpin of the Russell T Davies era". His main criticism was towards Ryan's character, describing the romantic tension between Christina and the Doctor as "feeling forced" and arguing that Ryan was "utterly unconvincing" as Christina. Conversely, he was appreciative of Strong's direction and the UNIT subplot. Specifically, he approved of Evans' performance, noting that "the fact that Malcolm names a unit of measurement after himself is both inspired and hilarious". His review ended by describing the episode as "lifeless for much of the hour" and expressing his hope that the ambiguous entity from Carmen's premonition would "hurry up".
Orlando Parfitt of IGN gave the episode a 7.1 (Good) rating out of ten. Parfitt called it a "straightforward story" that did not elevate to the level of excitement typically seen in "Doctor Who" until the episode's climax, instead describing the majority of the story as being "taken up with Tennant and Ryan standing in the desert, swapping flirtatious banter in between proclaiming how dire their situation is", and criticised the writing of the part of the episode where the bus was on San Helios, claiming that plot devices such as the Tritovore or Taylor being held at gunpoint and ordered to close the wormhole as "feel forced and unnaturally shoe-horned into the script". His praise of the episode went to Ryan and Evans: although he thought of Christina as a "shameless Lara Croft ripoff", he said that the character "still proves a sexy and wise-cracking counterpart to the Doctor"; and Evans' acting alongside Dumezweni highlighted his "undeniably great comic acting" as opposed to his
"love-it-or-hate-it" stand-up comedy. The last paragraph of his review focused on the climax, which he thought was "a cracker just-about makes up for the previously plodding plot", and described the entire episode as having "enough enjoyable moments" to entertain fans before the transmission of "The Waters of Mars".
"Planet of the Dead" was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form, but lost to "The Waters of Mars".
International broadcast.
The special aired in Canada in July on Space, and in the US on BBC America on 26 July 2009. In Australia, the Special aired 31 May 2009, on ABC1. In South Africa, the Special aired on 18 October 2010, on BBC Entertainment. It is currently one of two episodes since the 2005 revival not featured on Netflix instant streaming. The other missing episode is "A Christmas Carol."

Chemin Craig

The Chemin Craig Road was a road created in the early 19th century at the order of James Henry Craig, Governor of British North America. It was intended to connect Quebec City with the United States and to promote settlement of the Eastern Townships.
History.
At the turn of the 19th century, in Lower Canada, nearly all of the population lived in communities along the St. Lawrence River. The land between the river and the U.S. border had been surveyed and was ready for settlement. In 1810, governor James Henry Craig authorized construction of a road to link Quebec and Boston in the U.S. He also wanted to promote colonization of the Eastern Townships by anglophones. His ultimate goal was to assimilate the French Canadian population. The planned route went from Saint-Gilles to Richmond, where an existing road (modern-day Quebec Route 143) continued to the American border.
Construction of the road began in August 1810 and took three months. The work force of 180 soldiers cut trees and built bridges to make the road suitable for traffic. Although the terrain was muddy and damaged in several places, it was suitable enough for a winter stagecoach service, which was established in January 1811 and took passengers from Quebec to Boston in only six days. The service ended at the March thaw and was later abandoned completely because of the difficult traveling conditions, including Lipsey's hill. 
The War of 1812 led to the abandonment of the road. Several bridges were destroyed, and the road became overgrown as nature took its toll. Although some repairs were made, the road was declared unfit for passage in 1829. To relieve this problem, the chemin Gosford was built to promote settlement in the area.
The chemin Craig had a mixed success. It opened the territory to new inhabitants, but the results were far from what the planners had desired. Not enough English-speaking settlers arrived, and the goal to assimilate the French Canadians failed. On the contrary, it was the French Canadians who settled the region and became the majority.
In 1983, Quebec writer Madeleine Ferron published the novel "Sur le Chemin Craig", which describes how Irish immigrants settled in the Beauce region of Quebec during the mid-19th century.
Route.
The chemin Craig begins in Saint-Gilles, southwest of Quebec City. It continues through the town of Saint-Jacques-de-Leeds and the canton of Inverness. It then passes near Kinnear's Mills and through Saint-Jean-de-Brébeuf and Irlande. The path from Saint-Gilles to Saint-Ferdinand d'Halifax corresponds to modern-day Quebec Route 216. From Saint-Ferdinand, the road continues through Vianney, Chester-Est, Chesterville, and Tingwick. It then passes through Danville, where it joins Route 116 until Richmond. The rest of the route past Richmond follows modern-day Route 143. Heading towards the U.S., it passes through Windsor, Bromptonville, Sherbrooke, Ayer's Cliff and finally Stanstead at the international border.

The Inheritance (2007 film)

The Inheritance is a Scottish road movie following 2 brothers journeying north to find their late father’s inheritance. Made by Lyre Productions, the film was shot for just £5000 and filmed over the course of 11 days in February 2007. It is the debut feature film from director Charles-Henri Belleville and stars Fraser Sivewright, Tim Barrow, Tom Hardy and Imogen Toner.
Plot.
Two brothers meet at their father's (Tom Hardy) funeral. David (Tim Barrow) has come up from London, Fraser (Fraser Sivewright) lives in the village he was brought up in. In their father's old workshop they discover a note instructing them to find his inheritance located somewhere on the Isle of Skye. They set off in his old VW van heading north, finding conflict, comedy and bitter memories as they are forced to confront their past and each other. Picking up a hitchhiker – the mysterious, enigmatic Tara (Imogen Toner) – finally brings them to breaking point as they reach Skye. She leaves them, taking off in the van, and David heads off on foot through the island searching for the destination – a remote place named Cille Chriosd. On a remote beach, as the sun sets, David and Fraser face their final confrontation.
Production.
"The Inheritance" was directed by Charles-Henri Belleville and written & produced by Tim Barrow. It was filmed in 11 days on miniDV by a cast and crew of 11, entirely on location in Scotland, only using natural light. The script allowed improvisation and the story was adapted to suit circumstances. Says Tim:
"Originally we were going to improvise everything – work with actors I knew, get a minibus, shoot at specific locations, drive north, film everything, live it, breathe it, edit together and present accordingly. But we needed a story to match the scenery and the music. So I wrote it."
DOP Chris Beck shot the road trip between Edinburgh and Skye and although the shoot was over in 11 intense days the editing took time to perfect. Those involved were working full-time and had to edit through the night and all weekends. By September the film was finished and had been invited by Raindance Film Festival to premiere at their festival in October 2007.
Success came at the British Independent Film Awardswith "The Inheritance"[http://www.theinheritancethemovie.co.uk/ winning the Raindance Award. More festival screenings followed, plus cinema screenings in London and throughout Scotland.
Reception.
"The Inheritance" received glowing reviews and screened at 11 film festivals including its premiere at Raindance Film Festival where it was nominated Best UK Feature. The film went on to win the Raindance Award at the 2007 British Independent Film Awards. Further nominations include Best Director & Best Producer at 2008 BAFTA Scotland New Talent Awards, and Best Debut UK Feature at London's East End Film Festival.
The film screened in cinemas and film societies across the UK, in Ireland and Canada.
Rotten Tomatoes gave it a glowing review, proclaiming it "independent filmmaking at its most exciting". Sky Movies called it "raw and enigmatic". Moviescope magazine declared the film "the stuff of low budget legend". And Time Out named director Charles-Henri Belleville "a talent to watch".
In January 2009, the film was released on DVD, partnered by a 60 documentary showing exactly how it's possible to make an award-winning, micro budget, independent feature film.

Adirondack Cottage Sanitarium

The Adirondack Cottage Sanitarium was a tuberculosis sanatorium established in Saranac Lake, New York in 1885 by Dr. Edward Livingston Trudeau. After Trudeau's death in 1915, the institution's name was changed to the Trudeau Sanatorium, following changes in conventional usage. It was listed under the latter name on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995.
Trudeau was born in 1848 in New York City to a family of physicians. During his late teens, his elder brother James contracted tuberculosis and Edward nursed him until his death three months later. At twenty, he enrolled in the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia University (then Columbia College), completing his medical training in 1871. He was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 1873. Following conventional thinking of the times, he went to live in the Adirondack Mountains, seeking a change of climate. He spent as much time as possible in the open and subsequently regained his health. In 1876 he moved to Saranac Lake and established a small medical practice. 
In 1882, Trudeau read about Prussian Dr. Hermann Brehmer's success treating tuberculosis with the "rest cure" in cold, clear mountain air. Following this example, Trudeau founded the Adirondack Cottage Sanitarium in February, 1885. The first patients were two sisters who had been factory workers in New York City. They were treated in a one-room cottage named "Little Red", built for $350 on land donated by the guides and residents of the village. As the sanitorium grew, it would be supported at first by wealthy sportsmen that Trudeau had met at nearby Paul Smith's Hotel, several of whom had built great camps on the nearby St. Regis Lakes. Early contributors included John W. Minturn, Anson Phelps Stokes, and Whitelaw Reid.
While the sanitarium did not offer its services free-of-charge, it treated poorer patients at less than cost, and fund-raising was a constant concern. Many physicians and staff members served without pay, and in later years Trudeau commented that he had never been able to pay his staff adequately. Like Trudeau himself, a number of physicians and nurses were themselves infected with tuberculosis.
The sanitarium also developed a school for nursing, and later the Trudeau School of Tuberculosis, which offered six-week summer courses for physicians who wished to learn the latest treatment methods for the disease.
Patients included authors Allen Seager and Walker Percy, Canadian physician and medical innovator Norman Bethune, and baseball player Larry Doyle.
In time, far more patients would be drawn to the area than the Sanitarium could handle. Many patients were treated in the small, often family-run, cure cottages that developed in the area to meet the demand. Large sanitoria were built at Ray Brook and Gabriels, and in 1927, the Will Rogers Hospital, the last of the institutional sanatoria, was built in Saranac Lake; it is now an assisted living facility, Saranac Village at Will Rogers.
The Trudeau Sanatorium closed in 1954, after the discovery of effective antibiotic treatments for tuberculosis. The property was sold by Trudeau's grandson, Dr. Francis B. Trudeau, Jr., to the American Management Association in 1957. The proceeds were invested in a new medical research facility, the Trudeau Institute, built on Lower Saranac Lake, which opened in 1964; subsequently Little Red and the Trudeau statue were moved to the new site as memorials. A number of the sanatorium buildings have been torn down, and many more have been badly renovated, but a substantial number are still intact. They are not generally open to the public, but tours are offered by Historic Saranac Lake, a local nonprofit, historic preservation organization.

1976 Moro Gulf earthquake

The 1976 Moro Gulf earthquake and tsunami took place on August 16, 1976, at 16:11 UTC (on August 17, 1976, at 00:11 local time), near the islands of Mindanao and Sulu, in the Philippines. Its magnitude was calculated as being as high as 8.0 on the moment magnitude scale. The epicenter was in the Celebes Sea between the islands of Mindanao and Borneo. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center's preliminary magnitude was given as 8.0 on the Richter scale and as 7.9 by other sources. There were many aftershocks following the main earthquake. A major aftershock on August 17 (local date) had a magnitude of 6.8. It was followed by at least fifteen smaller aftershocks.
Effects.
The initial earthquake was widespread and was felt as far as the central Philippine islands of the Visayas. A massive tsunami devastated 700 kilometers of coastline bordering the Moro Gulf in the North Celebes Sea, resulting in destruction and death in the coastal communities of the Sulu Archipelago and southern Mindanao, including Zamboanga City and Pagadian City. At least 5000 people died during the earthquake and tsunami, with thousands more remaining missing. Some reports say that as many as 8,000 people lost their lives in total, with ninety percent of all deaths the result of the following tsunami.
Initially over 8,000 people were officially counted as killed or missing, 10,000 injured, and 90,000 homeless, making the 1976 Moro Earthquake and Tsunami one of the most devastating disasters in the history of the Philippine Islands. After the initial earthquake the people were unaware of the need to move to higher ground; when the tsunami hit it sucked most of the victims out to sea. Based on the investigation on the affected region it was confirmed that the waves reached up to when they hit the areas. There were reports of weak tsunami activity as far as Japan, as well as Indonesian Hydrographic Office reports of unusual wave activity affecting the islands of Sulawesi (Celebes Island) and Borneo.
In Zamboanga City, 14 buildings were partially damaged. Zamboanga City was spared from serious damage of the tsunami triggered by this earthquake because the Basilan Island and the Santa Cruz Islands served as a buffer and deflected waves.
Response.
Warnings.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) in Honolulu issued a Tsunami Watch for the Pacific and queried tide gauge stations in Okinawa, Yap and Malakal. Based on negative reports from these stations, the watch was cancelled. Unfortunately, minutes after the earthquake, a large local tsunami struck the region. There was no time to issue a local warning.
Aid response.
The Philippine Government sent out aid and support as soon as news reached Manila. Later a team of US and Filipino geologists and officials surveyed the disaster zone with the help of the Philippine Air Force. The objective of the survey was to obtain measurements of the tsunami wave heights, extent of inundation and gather additional information on the earthquake and the tsunami and its effects in the region.
Aftermath.
The earthquake occurred at night, when offices and schools in Cotabato, Zamboanga and other cities were unoccupied, therefore the loss of life was greatly reduced. Pagadian, on the other hand, was the only city hardest hit by the tsunami that followed. Although the earthquake had a large magnitude, surprisingly, it produced little ground deformation on land areas. However, there was extensive earthquake damage to buildings, bridges and roads in Mindanao and particularly in the city of Cotabato.
Tectonic summary.
Several fault zones in the region are capable of producing major earthquakes and destructive local tsunamis. The two major fault zones that are most dangerous are the Sulu Trench in the Sulu Sea and the Cotabato Trench, a region of subduction that crosses the Celebes Sea and the Moro Gulf in Southern Mindanao. According to the PHIVOLCS historical catalog of earthquakes for the last 100 years, this region of the southern Philippines is characterized by moderate to high seismicity. The most recent earthquake along the Cotabato Trench region of subduction being the March 6, 2002 earthquake in Southern Mindanao.

St Mary Woolchurch Haw

St Mary Woolchurch Haw was a parish church in the City of London, destroyed in the Great Fire of London of 1666 and not rebuilt. It came within the ward of Walbrook.
History.
The church of St Mary Woolchurch Haw was an ancient foundation, dating from the time of William I, when it was given to the Abbot and Convent of St John's, Colchester, by Hubert of Ryes, who was the father of Eudo Dapifer, William's steward. In the Charter of Endowment, it is referred to as "St Mary of West Cheaping, which is called Newchurch"; the western end of Cheapside is now called Poultry. It became the property of the crown after the dissolution.
The name is said to be derived from a beam that was once fixed in the churchyard, which was used for weighing wool. The church was rebuilt in the reign of Henry VI. At the end of the sixteenth century John Stow described it as "reasonably fair and large", and John Strype recorded that it was "richly repaired and beautified, at the Charge of the Parishioners" in 1629.
St Mary Woolchurch Haw was one of the 86 parish churches destroyed by the Great Fire in 1666. The parish clerk and the sexton were able to rescue the "plate" (the silverware used during services), "the new great Bible" and some vestments; while the clerk was doing this, all his own property was burned. In 1670 a Rebuilding Act was passed and a committee set up under the stewardship of Sir Christopher Wren to decide which would be rebuilt. Fifty-one were chosen, but St Mary Woolchurch Haw was not among them. The parish was united to that of St Mary Woolnoth. 
The Mansion House now stands on the site.
Present day.
The parish now forms part of the combined parish of "St Edmund the King and Martyr, and St Mary Woolnoth Lombard Street with St Nicholas Acons, All Hallows Lombard Street, St Benet Gracechurch, St Leonard Eastcheap, St Dionis Backchurch and St Mary Woolchurch Haw" - usually shortened to "St Edmund & St Mary Woolnoth". It is part of the Church of England's Diocese of London.

Lorenz Kellner

Lorenz Kellner (born at Kalteneber in the district of Eichsfeld, 29 January 1811; died at Trier, 18 August 1892) was a German educator.
Life.
He was the son of Heinrich Kellner who had been a pupil of Pestalozzi at Yverdon and had introduced Pestalozzi's methods at the normal school he conducted, the first of its kind in the Catholic district of Eichsfeld. Out of these private courses for the training of elementary school-teachers developed a seminary for teachers at Heiligenstadt. 
Lorenz Kellner graduated at the Gymnasium Josephinum at Hildesheim, and then studied at the evangelical seminary for teachers at Magdeburg. After being a teacher at the Catholic elementary school at Erfurt for two years, he was made rector of the school.
In 1836 his father's normal school was enlarged into a seminary for teachers, of which the elder Kellner remained the head while Lorenz was made his only assistant. In 1848 von Eichhorn, the Prussian minister of worship and education, called Lorenz to Marienwerder in West Prussia as member of the government district council and of the school-board. After seven years at Marienwerder, Kellner was summoned to fill the same offices at Trier. Since there were at this date no institutions for the training of teachers in Trier, Kellner founded several seminaries both for male and female teachers during the twenty-nine years of his official activity here. 
In 1863 the Academy of Münster in Westphalia made Kellner Doctor of Philosophy honoris causa, in recognition of his services on behalf of the German language and of pedagogics.
Works.
In his major work, "Praktischer Lehrgang für den deutschen Unterricht" (1837–40), the teaching of grammar was systematically connected with the reading-book. This was, for that period, a very important advance when contrasted with the current methods of grammatical instruction. In 1850 appeared his best-known work, "Zur Pädagogik der Schule und des Hauses. Aphorismen", which was translated into several languages. It contains altogether 178 essays which cover the entire field of training and teaching. 
His "Skizzen und Bilder aus der Erziehungsgeschichte" (3 vols., 1862) was the first treatment of the history of pedagogics by a Catholic author. Kellner's "Kurze Geschichte der Erziehung und des Unterrichts" (1877) is a book of practical suggestions for teachers; his "Volksschulkunde" was a theoretical and practical guide for Catholic teachers of both sexes, school inspectors, and seminaries. Other works were "Lebensblätter, Erinnerungen aus der Schulwelt" (1891) and the posthumous "Lose Blätter, Pädagog. Zeitbetrachtungen und Ratschläge von Kellner" (1897).

All That (season 1)

All That's first season ran on April 16, 1994 as a special preview, but officially ran from December 24, 1994 to April 1, 1995. The first season began in 1994-1995 with the pilot and 14 episodes. On April 16, 1994, Nickelodeon aired The All That Pilot, which was the beginning of Season 1, The beginning of The "Golden Era", and the start of The All That series.
After You Can't Do That on Television ended production in 1990, Nickelodeon had interest in creating another sketch comedy series for the network. The network debuted another sketch show called Roundhouse in 1992. After the shows debut Nickelodeon asked Mike Tollin and Brian Robbins to create a new show. The network wanted a show that was similar to Saturday Night Live, but for kids. Joe Davola, Kevin Kopelow, Dan Schneider and Heath Seifert were brought on as producers and were a major part of the writing force for the show.
Producers went on a search to finds kids to join the cast after the network greenlighted the show. Angelique Bates, Lori Beth Denberg, Katrina Johnson, Kel Mitchell, Alisa Reyes, Josh Server, and Kenan Thompson were hired. Bates got a call from her agent about the show in late 1992. She auditioned by doing an impression of Steve Urkel, which she would get to do various times on the show. Denberg was discovered by producers at a drama competition; she was invited to audition and got the gig. Johnson, Mitchell, Reyes, Server, and Thompson went through a series of auditions to get on the show.
In 1994, Nickelodeon canceled Roundhouse and aired the pilot on April 16 of the same year. The show featured producer Kevin Kopelow as the stage manager which the cast members do something bad to him constantly, exclusively during the cold opens. The first season was broadcast from Orlando, Florida. The show's cold openings featured the cast in a green room and their departure from the room. To resemble Saturday Night Live, producers added the segment "Vital Information" which would be featured in every episode just like SNL's "Weekend Update" segment. Producers bumped Denberg up to anchor the segment.
The theme song for "All That" was performed by TLC. The intro features the entire cast in an alleyway. They are playing games and playing with a sheet with the All That logo on it. The cast jumps on unseen trampolines. The intro starts off with the announcer saying "Not quite live, but ready for prime time. Get Ready, get set, it's All That". After that the All That Song begins. It starts off with a sign of the word "Oh". The sign is held by Johnson. Then two people are shown playing racket ball in the alleyway. Then the cast is shown, their names are in bright red. Their first and last names are separated by a picture of the All That logo. The musical guest is shown after Thompson, the intro ends with a pan shot of the entire cast with the names of the producers flashing by.
Action League Now! aired as part of the show for two shorts. More were planned, but then the show was moved to All That's first spin-off, KaBlam!.
For reasons unknown, Season 1 was not the first to air on "The '90s Are All That", nor has it been confirmed whether it will even air in the future. Instead, the block began with Season 2, and the iTunes release has begun with Season 2 as well. Note, neither of the first 2 Seasons aired when The N aired the series in 2008, possibly due to music rights involved with the musical guests expiring.

All That (season 2)

All That's second season ran from October 7, 1995 to October 12, 1996. This season contained 22 episodes.
This season is similar to season one, because this season stars the same cast members and is also taped in Orlando, Florida. After the next season ended the show moved out of Florida and moved to Nickelodeon On Sunset (formerly The Aquarius Theater) in Hollywood, California. Season 2 is also the final season for Angelique Bates, whose contract with the show was not renewed.
The intro for the second season is the same as the first season.
The producers thought that Mitchell and Thompson had good chemistry on the show together. From there, the duo would begin starring on their own show, Kenan & Kel. The show debuted during this season, with Mitchell and Thompson performing on both shows and doing other promotional work for the network.
This was the first season to air on The '90s Are All That block on TeenNick on July 25, 2011; however the musical guests are not shown on the TeenNick re-airings

Nuremberg Transport Museum

The Nuremberg Transport Museum (') is based in Nuremberg, Germany, and consists of the Deutsche Bahn's own DB Museum and the Museum of Communications ('). It also has two satellite museums at Koblenz-Lützel (the "DB Museum Koblenz") and Halle ("DB Museum Halle"). The Nuremberg Transport Museum is one of the oldest technical history museums in Europe. 
In February 2007 the official name of the DB Museum became the Company Museum of the Deutsche Bahn AG (""). It is a milestone on the European Route of Industrial Heritage (ERIH).
The DB Museum.
History.
The forerunner of the present-day DB Museum was opened in 1899 as a royal Bavarian railway museum and it is therefore the oldest railway museum in Germany. Today it is a company museum belonging to the Deutsche Bahn and portrays, amongst other things, the history of the railways. The present building was built in 1925.
On 1 July 1996, the Deutsche Bahn AG (DB AG) took over the museum from the Deutsche Bundesbahn for the symbolic purchase price of one deutschmark. At the same time Dr. Jürgen Franzke, previously head of the Museum of Industrial Culture ("Museums Industriekultur") in Nuremberg, was appointed as the museum's chief. The DB AG planned at that time to invest 6 million DM up to the museum's centenary year.
Exhibits.
In the displays of historical railway vehicles are the following important exhibits:
Some of the original vehicles are not in the museum itself, but in the wagon shed situated in the open area belonging to the museum on the opposite side of the street. The museum also owns a range of historical vehicles that can be used for special rail services.
Model collection.
A further attraction of the museum is its collection of 160, 1:10 scale models occupying 1000 square metres of the museum. These models have been built over the years since the end of the 19th century and are very finely detailed. The first were made in 1882 by apprentices of the Royal Bavarian State Railways ("Königlich Bayerische Staats-Eisenbahnen"). 
The museum also offers a walk-through tunnel, a level crossing, signals and points that can be operated, models equipped with sound and light and simulators.
Model railway.
A model railway covering an area of 80 m² is used to demonstrate prototypical railway operations. During museum opening hours there is a ten-minute demonstration hourly, on the half-hour, with explanations of the key concepts of railway operating. The layout, built between 1960 and 1970, is worked using control panels with a total of some 5000 relays.
Library.
In the main building of the DB Museum there is a library with about 40,000 titles on railway subjects. The "Präsenzbibliothek" can be visited by appointment free of charge on workdays. Postal loans are not possible.
Damage following the fire of 17 October 2005.
On the evening of 17 October 2005 much of the roundhouse of the museum, less its steel frame, was burnt to the ground. Unlike the wagon shed, the locomotive shed was not located in the immediate vicinity of the museum and accessible to the public, but four kilometres away at the Nuremberg West locomotive depot in the suburb of Gostenhof. It was there that the DB Museum had stabled operational locomotives for which room could not be found in the museum.
A 1935 working replica of the "Adler", a locomotive from the first German railway between Nuremberg and Fürth, was badly damaged by the blaze. Apprentices and experienced specialists rebuilt the engine in the Meiningen Steam Locomotive Works. After two years of reconstruction the "Adler" was once again ready for operations in October 2007 and returned to the Nurember Transport Museum on 23 November 2007.
Federal Government MPs, members of the DB AG management and the Bavarian minister-president, Beckstein, took part in the first journey of the restored "Adler" on 26 April 2008. A further, non-operational, 1953 replica is displayed in the museum. 
Unfortunately the last surviving examples of the goods train locomotive, the DRG Class 45, the electric Class E 75 locomotive and other exhibits, especially locomotives, as well as numerous spare parts, also fell victim to the fire or were at least badly damaged.
A total of 24 historical engines and wagons went up in smoke. In the long term, the steam engines should be repairable, as should the E 75. The damaged diesel engines and railbuses, due to their light construction, were irreparable and were scrapped by July 2006. The burnt out and partly collapsed locomotive shed was torn down. Several locos were sold or loaned to railway museums for restoration. For example, number 23 105, the last steam engine bought by the Bundesbahn in 1959, was leased to the South German Railway Museum ("Süddeutsches Eisenbahnmuseum Heilbronn") in Heilbronn for visual restoration.
DB Museum branch in Koblenz.
In the Lützel district of Koblenz is the DB Museum, Koblenz, a branch of the museum that accommodates a number of vehicles including several Class 103, 110 and 113, E 44 and E 16 electric express locomotives, as well as several coaches belonging to the Joseph Goebbels special train. In addition a restored Prussian T 3, factory number 499 built by the Maschinenfabrik Christian Hagans in 1903 and stored under in accordance with strict heritage protection regulations, can be viewed. For decades it had been used as in a children's play park at Cologne Zoo. At present two of the steam locomotive exhibits damaged in the great fire at Nuremberg are also being restored there.
DB Museum branch in Halle (Saale).
The former locomotive shed in Halle (Saale) is a branch of the Nuremberg Museum. On display there are several Deutsche Reichsbahn vehicles, in particular the 03 1010 steam locomotive and the E 11 001 and E 18 31 electric locomotives. The vehicles are looked after by the Halle shed.
Museum of Communications.
The museum of communications in the Transport Museum came from the royal Bavarian postal museum and was integrated into the Transport Museum in 1902. It displays over 500 years of postal and telecommunication services history in Bavaria from the Middle Ages to the present. Major aspects covered are the development of postal transportation, post coach travel, telegraphy and telephony. Original vehicles, such as post coaches and motorised vehicles, are displayed, as well as technical equipment from old-fashioned teleprinters to modern news satellites.
Due to lack of space, several historical railway postal vehicles are located in the railway park at Augsburg.
Charter and tourist trains.
The Nuremberg Transport Museum owns several trains, not all stabled in Nuremberg, that are used for tourist and charter services including:

He gained tournament success in a range of disciplines in his prime. He represented Britain in the 2002 Chin Woo Championships in China; Euro-British Full Contact Champion in 1999; and the MAI National Chinese Forms Champion in 1992.

Mark has worked in Hong Kong on two feature films - "The Medallion" and "The Twins Effect" - alongside Jackie Chan and Donnie Yen. He has also worked on "Batman Begins".
Mark's debut as a lead actor, film producer, and action performer, arrived with the feature film "Displaced". The film, considered to be an ambitious project, gained worldwide distribution.
British independent film "Underground", produced by Intense Productions, provided Mark with his second starring role. The film achieved an honourable mention award for Stunts at the Accolade Film Festival in California.

All That (season 3)

"All That's" third season ran from November 16, 1996 to October 18, 1997. This season of "All That" contained 21 episodes.
Many changes to the show happened before the start of the season started. This was the only season recorded at Paramount Pictures after moving from Nickelodeon Studios, but before moving to Nickelodeon On Sunset.
Original cast member Angelique Bates did not return to the show after her contract had expired last season. Her absence left a hole in the cast, the producers hired Amanda Bynes to take her place as a new cast member. The producers also hired Tricia Dickson as a cast member mid way through the season. However she was put into featured status and mostly played supporting roles during her short time on the show.
This would be the final season for Tricia Dickson, Katrina Johnson and Alisa Reyes. Johnson disappeared from the show mid-season because her contract expired, but she was kept in the opening credits. Johnson was replaced by Dickson, who was let go at the end of the season to make way for more new cast members to join in the following season. Reyes left the show on her own terms.
This season is also notable for being the last season to feature more female cast members than male, until season 9.
During the summer the film Good Burger was released. It was All That's only feature film to be made based on a sketch that first aired on the show. The movie grossed more than 20 million dollars and received generally negative reviews from critics. Mitchell and Thompson were the main stars of the film. Denberg and Server had supporting roles in the film.
The intro remains the same as the first two seasons. However all of the Bates parts are edited out and are replaced with Bynes. New group shots of the entire cast were taped as well.
This was the first season to air on The N back in 2008, and it will be the second season to air on "The '90s Are All That" on August 22, 2011.

Pod People (band)

Pod People are a doom metal band from Canberra, Australia that formed in 1991. The band has since recorded six releases, playing a blend of stoner and sludge traits, with lyrics typically covering themes relating to either cannabis in their early days to topics themetically based around The Divine Comedy. During 1993-1996 founding members shifted drastically altering not only the make up of the band but their sound too.
History.
Pod People began in 1991 from the then thriving local heavy music scene that began in the very healthy underage youth centre all ages shows and as the generation came of age centred around the Terrace bar, a beloved venue that closed in 1995. Other Canberra bands of note that were around and some who continue now include Armoured Angel, Alchemist, Psychrist, Slug, Precursor and Exceed to name a very few.
The early lineup was fairly liquid early on, but founding members Ivan (guitar) of Precursor and Brad Nicholson (Vocals) of S.I.D. were joined by Duncan (Bass), Paul (guitar) and Adrian (Drums) the band built upon momentum of some successful party shows in their homebase of Havelock House and began playing regularly as well as recording their first demo at 2XX Radio studios called “Just One”.
The sound was a blend of early 90’s stoner bands, Tumbleweed in particular was a band who’s sound the early material was referenced too, however a little heavier and more overtly influenced by Black Sabbath which the band covered frequently in the early period.
The band played on numerous festivals and shows around the Canberra region and in Wollongong, which also had a thriving scene at the time, home to Tumbleweed, Dawn Patrol, Proton Energy Pills and many other bands playing a similar brand of fuzzed out heavy rock.
A CD EP was recorded in Sydney and released in 1995, the band played some launch shows before the beginning of a long period of line up changes which finally solidified in 1996 with the current line up of Brad, Dave or DD(Bass), Josh (also known JJ Lawhore from his 3 year stint in Blood Duster, guitar), Maggs (Drums) and Mel (guitar).
Pod People solidified their line up in late 95 with guitarist Mel Walker joining other new recruits Maggs (drums), Josh (guitar) and Dave (bass). They began writing and performing a heavier darker style than the previous line up. 1998's 'Swingin' Beef' EP sowed the seeds of the doom/stoner rock sound that lead to the 'Soil' EP in 2000. Before they signed with the High Beam Music label in 2001.
Recording "Doom Saloon" at Backbeach Studio’s in Victoria with DW Norton that the band had worked with on the EP’s, the album was very well received and lead to a number of high profile international supports. The Backbeach studio was expensive for the self funded band but Highbeam Records footed the bill and allowed the band time to produce the 10 track album over 9 days including mixing. However the result was the most realised combination of a style their bio at the time was touting as "stoom" or stoner doom among others.
The band had played two supports on successive tours by English doom lords Cathedral, but had not expected when through a friend and local doom aficionado, who sent Doom Saloon to Cathedral front man Lee Dorian’s doom uber-label Rise Above Records in the UK, that the album would be secured for an international licence.
The album received extremely positive reviews worldwide and a film clip for the opening track "Filling The Void" was added to high rotation on Australian domestic music TV.
Notable was the artwork for the Australian release. A 4x3 CD fold out cut into an upside down cross showing an interpretation of a map of Inferno from The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri by Canberra artist Roy Torkington of Alchemist. The artwork is significant as the band have taken the Divine Comedy as a theme for a three album series based loosely on the Divine Comedy.
In 2005 the band frustrated by the lack of doom acts coming out to Australia bit the bullet and promoted Electric Wizard's first Australian national tour, doing a thorough tour of the east coast of Australia.
The band had a hiatus whilst recording, yet maintained live shows with bands like Celtic Frost, Clutch and a slew of great Aussie bands like Whitehorse, Looking Glass, Clagg, Dread, Sons of the Ionian Sea, Grey Daturas and Peeping Tom.
The band then recorded over late 2007 and early 2008 largely self-financed after the High Beam Music label closed in 2004. Toyland Studios in Northcote Melbourne was the first session followed by three follow up sessions at Goatsound Studio’s and home the engineer and now label manager Jason PC of Blood Duster.
Jason and Matt Collins, Blood Duster guitarist had started the Goatsound record label for Blood Duster albums and had also just worked on albums by Australian grind acts The Day Everything Became Nothing and Captain Cleanoff.
The ten track album was recorded with the theme of Purgatory in mind and in keeping with the theme’s set out on the first album. Looking for a different artistic approach and having worked with Sydney artist Glenn Smith on the Electric Wizard tour, Glenn took to the theme with gusto and produced an immaculate painting for the album cover based on Mount Purgatory.
The album is entitled "Mons Animae Mortuorum", Latin for “Mountain of the souls of the Dead” and was released in 2008.

All That (season 4)

All That's fourth season ran from November 15, 1997 to November 28, 1998. This season had the most episodes, at 21 episodes aired.
The show saw many changes before the start of the season. Original cast members Katrina Johnson and Alisa Reyes both had left the show. New cast member Tricia Dickson was let go from the show before the start of this season to make way for the new cast members. Dickson and Reyes, however, would make an appearance together in an unused Good Burger sketch from season 3.
The producers decided to hire three new cast members to make up for the three that had left. In a bit of stunt casting they hired Danny Tamberelli. Tamberelli was a Nickelodeon veteran, he already had his own show on the network and had made numerous guest appearances on other shows on Nickelodeon. The producers also brought on Christy Knowings and Leon Frierson. The three would provide new life to the show. Midway through the season Victor-Cohn Lopez and Zach Mclemore were hired. Like Dickson they were added as featured players and did not have any major screen time. This was also the first season recorded at Nickelodeon On Sunset in Hollywood, California
This would be Lori Beth Denberg's final season on the show. In a live chat on Nick.com, she reasoned that she left "All That", because she "was getting older." Denberg was the last original female cast member on the show before her departure.
Like Dickson, Lopez and Mclemore were let go from the show to make way for more new cast members for the following season.
This is the first season to have more male cast members then female and will remain as such until Season 9.
The intro for this season is different than the first three. This intro features the cast on a red carpet premiere in old Hollywood. The cast exit separately out of a limo and walk down the carpet, where they are greeted by fans who are throwing roses and taking pictures. The cast are wearing nice clothing, compared to the first three seasons. In this season Thompson is the one holding the "Oh" sign. The announcer starts off by saying "Fresh out the box, stop look and watch, ready yet? Get set, It's All That!" However, like the first three seasons, their names are in bright red front and are separated by the All That logo. After Thompson the musical guest is shown followed by the entire cast standing on the stairs as people take their pictures.

<doc id="18419834" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18419834" title="Milk and meat in Jewish law">
Milk and meat in Jewish law

Mixtures of milk and meat (, "basar bechalav", literally "meat in milk") are prohibited according to "Jewish law". This dietary law, basic to kashrut, is based on a verse in the Book of Exodus, which forbids "boiling a (kid) goat in its mother's milk". This prohibition is repeated in Deuteronomy.
According to the Talmud, these almost identical references are the basis for three distinct dietary laws:
Background.
There are three categories of Kosher food - Meat, Dairy and Parve/Pareve.
Explanation of biblical law.
The rabbis of the Talmud gave no reason for the prohibition, but later authorities, such as Maimonides, opined that the law was connected to a prohibition of Idolatry in Judaism. Obadiah Sforno and Solomon Luntschitz, rabbinic commentators living in the late middle ages, both suggested that the law referred to a specific foreign religious practice, in which young goats were cooked in their own mothers' milk, aiming to obtain supernatural assistance to increase the yield of their flocks. More recently, a theogonous text named "the birth of the gracious gods", found during the rediscovery of Ugarit, has been interpreted as saying that a Levantine ritual to ensure agricultural fertility involved the cooking of a young goat in its mother's milk, followed by the mixture being sprinkled upon the fields, though still more recent sources argue that this translation is incorrect. Another explanation is the separation accommodates significantly the large percentage of the population, particularly those who are aging, who are lactose-intolerant.
The biblical suppression of these practices was seen by some rabbinic commentators as having an ethical aspect. Sforno argued that using the milk of an animal to cook its offspring was inhumane, based on a principle similar to that of Shiluach haken, the injunction against gathering eggs from a nest while the mother bird watches. Chaim ibn Attar compared the practice of cooking of animals in their mother's milk to the barbaric slaying of nursing infants.
The term "g'di".
Since the Book of Genesis refers to young goats by the Hebrew phrase "g'di izim", but the prohibition against "boiling a kid..." only uses the term "g'di" (גדי), Rashi, one of the most prominent talmudic commentators, argued that the term "g'di" must actually have a more general meaning, including calves and lambs, in addition to young goats. Rashi also argued that the meaning of "g'di" is still narrow enough to exclude birds, all the undomesticated kosher animals (for example, chevrotains and antelope), and all of the non-kosher animals. The Talmudic writers had a similar analysis, but believed that since domesticated kosher animals (sheep, goats, and cattle) have similar meat to birds and to the non-domestic kosher land-animals, they should prohibit these latter meats too, creating a general prohibition against mixing milk & meat from any kosher animal, excepting fish.
The term "non-kosher" means something is not allowed as food—non-kosher animals (e.g., pigs, camels, and turtles) were already generally prohibited, and questions about the status of mixtures involving their meat and milk would be somewhat academic. Nevertheless, the lack of a classical decision about milk and meat of non-kosher animals gave rise to argument in the late Middle Ages. Some, such as Yoel Sirkis and Joshua Falk, argued that mixing milk & meat from non-kosher animals should be prohibited, but others, like Shabbatai ben Meir and David HaLevi Segal, argued that, excluding the general ban on non-kosher animals, such mixtures should not be prohibited.
The term "halev immo".
Rashi expressed the opinion that the reference to "mother's milk" must exclude fowl from the regulation, since only mammals produce milk. According to Shabbethai Bass, Rashi was expressing the opinion that the reference to a "mother" was only present to ensure that birds were clearly excluded from the prohibition; Bass argued that Rashi regarded the ban on boiling meat "in its mother's milk" to really be a more general ban on boiling meat in milk, regardless of the relationship between the source of the meat and that of the milk.
Substances derived from milk, such as cheese and whey, have traditionally been considered to fall under the prohibition, but milk substitutes, created from non-dairy sources, do not. However, the classical rabbis were worried that Jews using artificial milk might be misinterpreted, so they insisted that the milk be clearly marked to indicate its source. In the classical era, the main form of artificial milk was almond milk, so the classical rabbis imposed the rule that almonds must be placed around such milk; in the Middle Ages, there was some debate about whether this had to be done during cooking as well as eating, or whether it was sufficient to merely do this during the meal.
The term "bishul".
Although the biblical regulation literally only mentions "boiling" (Hebrew:"bishul", בישול), there were questions raised in the late Middle Ages about whether this should instead be translated as "cooking", and hence be interpreted as a reference to activities like broiling, baking, roasting, and frying. Lenient figures like Jacob of Lissa and Chaim ibn Attar argued that such a prohibition would only be a rabbinic addition, and not the biblical intent, but others like Abraham Danzig and Hezekiah da Silva argued that the biblical term itself had this wider meaning.
Three distinct laws.
The Talmudic rabbis believed that the biblical text only forbade eating a mixture of milk and meat, but because the biblical regulation is triplicated they imposed three distinct regulations to represent it:
Jacob ben Asher, an influential medieval rabbi, remarked that the gematria of "do not boil a kid" (Hebrew:"lo t'vasheil g'di", לא תבשל גדי) is identical to that of "it is the prohibition of eating, cooking and deriving benefit" (Hebrew: "he issur achilah u'bishul v'hana'ah", היא איסור אכילה ובישול והנאה), a detail that he considered highly significant. Though "deriving benefit" is a superficially vague term, it was later clarified by writers in the middle-ages to include:
It is not known whether "not benefiting from the mixture in any other way" would also include deriving any benefit from associating with people who, themselves, directly derive nourishment from the mixture.
The classical rabbis only considered milk and meat cooked together biblically forbidden, but Jewish writers of the Middle Ages also forbade consumption of anything merely containing the mixed tastes of milk and meat. This included, for example, meat that had been soaked in milk for an extended period. The prohibition against "deriving benefit", on the other hand, was seen as being more nuanced, with several writers of the late Middle Ages, such as Moses Isserles and David Segal, arguing that this restriction only applied to the milk and meat of "g'di", not to the much wider range of milks and meats prohibited by the rabbis; other prominent medieval rabbis, like Solomon Luria, disagreed, believing that the prohibition of "deriving benefit" referred to mixtures of all meats and milks.
Stringencies and leniencies.
The classical rabbis interpreted the biblical phrase "heed my ordinance" (Hebrew:"ushmartem et mishmarti"), which appears in the holiness code, to mean that they should (metaphorically) create a protective fence around the biblical laws, an attitude particularly expressed by "The Ethics of the Fathers" (a Mishnaic tractate discussing the ethics surrounding adherence to biblical rules). Nevertheless, the rabbis of the classical and Middle Ages also introduced a number of leniencies. Another prohibition on mixtures in Jewish law is "kil'ayim".
Classification of foods.
To prevent the consumption of forbidden mixtures, foods are divided into three categories.
Food in the "parve" category includes fish, fruit, vegetables, salt, etc.; among the Karaites, Ethiopian Jews, and some Persian Jews it also includes poultry, but other Jewish groups consider poultry to count as "meat." However, classical Jewish authorities argue that foods lose "parve" status if treated in such a way that they absorb the taste of milk or meat during cooking, soaking, or salting.
Minuscule quantities.
The classical rabbis expressed the opinion that each of the food rules could be waived, if the portion of food violating the regulations was less than a certain size, known as a "shiur" (Hebrew: "size", שיעור), unless it was still possible to taste or smell it; for the "milk and meat" regulations, this minimal size was a "ke'zayit" (כזית), literally meaning anything "similar to an olive" in size. However, the "shiur" is merely the minimum amount that leads to formal punishment in the classical era, but even "half a shiur is prohibited by the Torah" (Hebrew: "Hatzi shiur assur min haTorah", חצי שיעור אסור מן התורה).
Many rabbis followed the premise that "taste is principle" (Hebrew: "ta'am k'ikar", טעם כעיקר): in the event of an accidental mixing of milk and meat, the food could be eaten if there was no detectable change in taste. Others argued that forbidden ingredients could constitute up to half of the mixture before being disallowed. Today the rabbis apply the principle of "batel b'shishim ("nullified in sixty;" that is, permissible so long as forbidden ingredients constitute no more than 1/60 of the whole) (Hebrew: "batel b'shishim").
Due to the premise that "taste is principle", "parve" (i.e. "neutral") foods are considered to take on the same "meat"/"dairy produce" classification as anything they are cooked with.
Dishes and cooking utensils.
Since some cooking vessels and utensils (such as ceramic dishes and wooden spoons) are porous, it is possible for them to become infused with the taste of certain foods and transfer this taste to other foods. For example, if a frying pan is used to fry beef sausage, and is then used a few hours later to fry an omelette with cheese, a slight taste of the sausage might linger.
Samuel ben Meir, brother of Jacob ben Meir, argued that infused tastes could endure in a cooking vessel or utensil for up to 24 hours; his suggestion led to the principle, known as "ben Yomo" (Hebrew: "son of the day", בן יומו), that vessels and utensils should not be used to cook milk within 24 hours of being used to cook meat (and vice versa). Although, after 24 hours, some residual flavour may still reside in porous cooking vessels and utensils, some rabbis hold the opinion that such residue would become stale and fetid, hence only "infusing taste for the worse" (Hebrew: "nosen taam lifgam", נותן טעם לפגם), which they do not regard as violating the ban against mixing the tastes of milk and meat.
Since "parve" food is reclassified if it takes on the flavour of meat or dairy produce, Ashkenazi Jews traditionally forbid eating "parve" contents of a pot that has been used within 24 hours to cook meat, if the "parve" contents would be eaten with dairy produce. Their tradition similarly forbids eating "parve" foods with meat if the cooking vessel was used to cook dairy produce within the previous 24 hours. According to Joseph Caro, the Sephardic tradition was more lenient about such things, but Moses Isserles argued that such leniency was unreliable.
In light of these issues, Orthodox Jews take the precaution of maintaining two distinct sets of crockery and cutlery; one set (known in Yiddish as "milchig" and in Hebrew as "halavi") is for food containing dairy produce, while the other (known in Yiddish as "fleishig"/"fleishedik" and in Hebrew as "basari") is for food containing meat.
Physical proximity.
Prominent rabbis of the Middle Ages insisted that milk should not be placed on a table where people are eating meat, to avoid accidentally consuming milk while eating meat, and vice versa. Tzvi Hirsch Spira, an early 20th-century rabbi and anti-zionist commentator, argued that when this rule was created, the tables commonly in use were only large enough for one individual; Spira concludes that the rule would not apply if the table being used was large, and the milk was out of reach of the person eating meat (and vice versa).
The rabbis of the Middle Ages discussed the issue of people eating milk and meat at the same table. Jacob ben Asher suggested that each individual should eat from different tablecloths, while Moses Isserles argued that a large and obviously unusual item should be placed between the individuals, as a reminder to avoid sharing the foods. Later rabbinic writers pointed out exceptions to the rule. Chaim ibn Attar, an 18th-century kabbalist, ruled that sitting at the same table as a non-Jew eating non-kosher food was permissible; Yechiel Michel Epstein, a 19th-century rabbi, argued that the risk was sufficiently reduced if individuals sat far enough apart that the only way to share food was to leave the table.
Problem of sequential foods.
Rashi stated that meat leaves a fatty residue in the throat and on the palate and Maimonides noted that meat stuck between the teeth might not degrade for several hours Jonathan Eybeschutz pointed out that meat and dairy produce mix during digestion, and Feivel Cohen maintained that hard cheese leaves a lingering taste in the mouth. Generally, rabbinic literature considers the collective impact of each of these issues.
Eating dairy after meat.
The Talmud reports that Mar Ukva, a respected rabbi, would not eat dairy after eating meat at the same meal, and had a father who would wait an entire day after eating meat before eating dairy produce. Jacob ben Meir speculated that Mar Ukva's behaviour was merely a personal choice, rather than an example he expected others to follow, but prominent rabbis of the Middle Ages argued that Mar Ukva's practice must be treated as a minimum standard of behaviour.
Maimonides argued that time was required between meat and dairy produce because meat can become stuck in the teeth, a problem he suggested would last for "about six hours" after eating it; this interpretation was shared by Solomon ben Aderet, a prominent pupil of his, and Asher ben Jehiel, who gained entry to the rabbinate by Solomon ben Aderet's approval, as well as by the later Shulchan Aruch. By contrast, tosafists argued that the key detail was just the avoidance of dairy produce appearing at the same meal as meat. Therefore it was sufficient to just wait until a "new meal"—which to them simply meant clearing the table, reciting a particular blessing, and cleaning their mouths. Some later rabbinic writers, like Moses Isserles, and significant texts, like the "Zohar" (as noted by Vilna Gaon and Daniel Josiah Pinto), argued that a meal still did not qualify as "new" unless at least an hour had passed since the previous meal.
Since most Orthodox Sephardi Jews consider the Shulchan Aruch authoritative, they regard its suggestion of waiting six hours mandatory. Ashkenazi Jews, however, have various customs. Orthodox Jews of European ancestry usually wait for six hours, although those of German ancestry traditionally wait for only three hours, and those of Dutch ancestry have a tradition of waiting only for the one hour. The medieval tosafists stated that the practice does not apply to infants, but 18th and 19th-century rabbis, such as Abraham Danzig and Yechiel Michel Epstein, criticised those who followed lenient practices that were not traditional in their region. In the 20th century, many rabbis were in favor of leniency. Moses Stern ruled that all young children were excluded from these strictures, Obadiah Joseph made an exception for the ill, and Joseph Chaim Sonnenfeld exempted nursing women.
Eating meat after dairy.
It has traditionally been considered less problematic to eat dairy produce before meat, on the assumption that dairy products leave neither fatty residue in the throat, nor fragments between the teeth. Many 20th century Orthodox rabbis say that washing the mouth out between eating dairy and meat is sufficient. Some argue that there should also be recitation of a closing blessing before the meat is eaten, and others view this as unnecessary. Ashkenazi Jews following kabbalistic traditions, based on the "Zohar", additionally ensure that about half an hour passes after consuming dairy produce before eating meat
Some rabbis of the Middle Ages argued that after eating solid dairy products such as cheese, the hands should be washed. Shabbatai ben Meir even argues that this is necessary if utensils such as forks were used and the cheese never touched by hands. Other rabbis of that time, like Joseph Caro, thought that if it was possible to visually verify that hands were clean, then they need not be washed; Tzvi Hirsch Spira argued that washing the hands should also be practiced for milk.
Jacob ben Asher thought that washing the mouth was not sufficient to remove all residue of cheese, and suggested that eating some additional solid food is required to clean the mouth. Hard and aged cheese has long been rabbinically considered to need extra precaution, on the basis that it might have a much stronger and longer lasting taste; the risk of it leaving a fattier residue has more recently been raised as a concern. According to these rabbinic opinions, the same precautions (including a pause of up to six hours) apply to eating hard cheese before meat as apply to eating meat in a meal when the meat is eaten first. Judah ben Simeon, a 17th-century doctor in Frankfurt, argued that hard cheese is not problematic if melted. Binyomin Forst argues that leniency is proper only for cooked cheese dishes and not dishes topped with cheese.
Eating dairy/meat after eating dairy/meat dishes.
The following guidelines apply when eating pareve food cooked on dairy or meat dishes:
Microwave cooking.
Though radiative cooking of meat with dairy produce is not listed by the classical rabbis as being among the biblically prohibited forms of "cooking" such mixtures, a controversy remains about using a microwave oven to cook these mixtures. Rav Moshe Feinstein argues that microwave cooking is a form of "cooking" that counts as "melacha" during a Sabbath, but Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach disagrees.

"All Thats fifth season"' ran from December 12, 1998 to October 16, 1999. The season contained 21 episodes with a 100th Episode Special Midway.
The show saw many changes before the start of this season. Lori Beth Denberg after leaving the show at the end of the previous season. Since she was one of the original cast members, her characters and presence was missed by fans alike. Since Denberg was the anchor of Vital Information, a new anchor was needed to fill the segment. Danny Tamberelli succeeded Denberg in the Vital Information sketch, and Tamberelli was given a new set and a new desk unlike that of Denberg's Vital Information.
Featured cast members Victor-Cohn Lopez and Zach Mclemore were both dropped from the show. Producers hired Nick Cannon and Mark Saul to fill the gap they left behind. Like that of Lopez and Mclemore, both Saul and Cannon were both put into featured status. However, producers did not bring on any replacement for Denberg, leaving the cast to only have two female cast members.
Like Mitchell and Thompson years earlier, producers offered Bynes her own show. Bynes's popularity with the audience was huge. Producers saw their chance to capitalize on her fame and gave her own show. The show would be known as The Amanda Show.
This would be the final season for Kel Mitchell and Kenan Thompson. For most of the season Mitchell was absent for 11 episodes, because he was off filming the movie Mystery Men. Mitchell and Thompson would both go on to film the final season of their own show and then leave Nickelodeon to venture into Hollywood.

Oneview

oneview is an English and German-speaking application for social bookmarking. The platform has already been brought into being from the multimedia-agency Denkwerk in 1998 and is therefore one of the first providers for social bookmarking worldwide. According to a statement, the platform has got a collection of more than 5 million bookmarks from its members by now.
Functions.
The basic functions from oneview, as a "social bookmarking service", consist in saving and organising links, tagging of links, central copying of saved links and in the provision of a spatio-temporal independent access on the link collection of one or all members. Moreover, the collected information can be shared with other users.
In order that the user can find the information quickly, oneview provides a search function. In this search, human filtered information is presented to the user. The combination of different tags, as a search survey, serves to find the favoured information quickly as well.
For registered users there is the possibility to set up an individual collection of bookmarks and to provide them with tags. Thus, the user has access on the individually collected links and can retrieve them at any time. The bookmarks collected by the user can be labeled as private or public. Bookmarks with public liberalisation are available for other users, no matter if they are registered or not. Public liberalisation contains placing of other tags from other users (see also Folksonomy).
History and development.
Due to early establishment, oneview is seen as one of the pioneers of the current social bookmarking and search offers. In these days, the idea has been welcomed from its users and has been available in 12 speeches online in 2001. oneview was awarded a. o. for the concept with the German Multimedia-Award in 1999 and the "World Medal" of the New York Festivals in the same year. In August 2000 the „Best in eBusiness Award" followed suit.
The Oneview 2.0 platform was released as beta in 2005, then in March 2007 the 2.0 platform came out of beta and replaced the 1.0 platform. The financial interest of the publishing company M. DuMont Schauberg in Cologne has been made public.

Hormone receptor positive breast tumor

A hormone-receptor-positive tumor is a tumor which consists of cells that express receptors for certain hormones. The term most commonly refers to estrogen receptor positive tumors (i.e. tumors that contain estrogen receptor positive cells), but can also include progesterone receptor positive tumors. Estrogen-receptor-positive tumors depend on the presence of estrogen for ongoing proliferation. 
Treatment.
Endocrine treatment may be beneficial for patients with hormone receptor positive breast tumors.
There are two ways for treating these kind of tumors:

USCGC Point Welcome (WPB-82329)

USCGC "Point Welcome" (WPB-82329) was an Point class cutter constructed at the Coast Guard Yard at Curtis Bay, Maryland in 1961 for use as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat. Since the Coast Guard policy in 1962 was not to name cutters under in length, she was designated as "WPB-82329" when commissioned and was named "Point Welcome" in January 1964 when the Coast Guard began naming all cutters longer than . She was notable for being the victim of an inter-service friendly fire incident during the Vietnam War.
Construction and design details.
"Point Welcome" was built to accommodate an 8 man crew. She was powered by two VT600 Cummins diesel main drive engines and had two five-bladed propellers. The main drive engines were later replaced by VT800 Cummins engines. Water tank capacity was and fuel tank capacity was at 95% full. Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360 degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment. 
The design specifications for "Point Welcome" included a steel hull for durability, and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room. Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service. The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly. Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a watertight door on the starboard side aft of the deckhouse. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer. The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode. Accommodations for a 13 man crew were installed for Vietnam War service.
History.
After delivery in 1962, "Point Welcome" was assigned a homeport of Everett, Washington, where she served as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat.
At the request of the United States Navy, in April 1965, she was alerted for service in South Vietnam and assigned to Coast Guard Squadron One in support of Operation Market Time, along with 16 other Point class cutters. While the crew completed overseas training and weapons qualifications at Coast Guard Island and Camp Parks, California, "Point Welcome" was loaded onto a merchant ship, and transported to Subic Bay, Philippines in May 1965. She was refit for combat service. Shipyard modifications included installation of new single-sideband radio equipment, additional floodlights, small arms lockers, additional sound-powered phone circuits, and the addition of four M-2 machine guns. The original bow-mounted machine gun was replaced with a combination over-under 50 caliber machine gun/81mm trigger-fired mortar that had been developed by the Coast Guard for service in South Vietnam.
For service in Vietnam, two commissioned officers were added to the crew to add seniority in the mission of interdicting vessels at sea. 
"Point Welcome" was assigned to Division 12 of Squadron One to be based at Danang, along with , , , , , and . After sea trials, the Division left Subic Bay for Danang on 16 July 1965 in the company of USN Snohomish County, their temporary support ship. After almost two weeks at sea, they arrived at their new duty station on 20 July and began patrolling the coastal waters near Danang. Duty consisted of boarding Vietnamese junks to search for contraband weapons and ammunition and checking the identification papers of persons on board. Permanent engineering and logistic support of Division 12 was provided by a U.S. Navy non-self-propelled floating workshop, YR-71. During this time, the WPB's were directed to paint the hulls and superstructures formula 20 deck gray to cover the Coast Guard's stateside white paint. This increased the effectiveness of night patrols.
Friendly fire.
"Point Welcome" was about three-quarters of a mile south of the 17th parallel, in the limits of the DMZ, when she was attacked in the pre-dawn hours of 11 August 1966 by three aircraft of the U.S. Air Force while on patrol in the waters near the mouth of the Cua Viet River. Her commanding officer, LTJG David Brostrom, along with one crewman, EN2 Jerry Phillips, were killed in this friendly fire incident. Brostrom and Phillips were two of seven Coast Guardsmen killed in action during the Vietnam War. All of the crew were hit by shrapnel except the ship's executive officer, LTJG Ross Bell, two other crewmen, GM2 Mark D. McKenney and FA Houston J. Davidson. A South Vietnamese liaison officer, LTJG Do Viet Vien, and civilian freelance journalist Timothy J. Page, were wounded more severely 
BMC Richard Patterson saved the cutter and the surviving crew at great risk to himself. He was awarded a Bronze Star with the combat "V" device for his actions that were described in his award citation:
"Point Caution" came to the assistance of the "Point Welcome" and along with other units, rescued those in the water. Soon thereafter Patterson and those of his crew that were not seriously wounded returned to their cutter. They then sailed "Point Welcome" back to Danang under her own power. She was repaired after a three-month overhaul and returned to service. Investigations by the Military Assistance Command Vietnam (MACV) involving 37 witnesses were conducted from the 15th through the 23rd of August 1966 and concluded with a statement to the Commandant of the Coast Guard that:
Tet 1968 action.
On 29 February and 1 March 1968, "Point Welcome" assisted in the destruction of an SL-class North Vietnamese trawler near Cu Lao Re island, southeast of Danang. On the afternoon of 29 February 1968 the took the trawler under surveillance after it was first detected by a P-2 Neptune aircraft south of the demilitarized zone. "Point Welcome" and , along with two U.S. Navy swift boats, waited close to shore as the trawler approached, with "Androscoggin" trailing. In the early morning of 1 March 1968 as the trawler closed to within seven miles (11 km) of the coast, "Androscoggin" closed and challenged the trawler. After receiving no response, "Androscoggin" illuminated the target with star shells. The trawler, positively identified as a North Vietnamese SL-class vessel, opened fire on the cutter with recoilless rifle and machine gun fire. "Androscoggin" then opened fire with her battery, scoring one hit on the trawler's "after starboard side." The trawler then headed for the beach. Two helicopters took the trawler under fire while the 82-footers and swift boats closed. "Point Welcome" illuminated the target with illumination rounds fired from her 81-mm mortar while "Point Grey" and the swift boats fired their .50 caliber machine guns into the trawler. It grounded from the mouth of the Song Tha Cau river. "Point Welcome" then hit the target with two high explosive mortar rounds from her 81-mm mortar. The trawler soon thereafter exploded, leaving little trace. The cutters were hit with debris but suffered no personnel casualties.
Vietnamization.
She was transferred to the Republic of Vietnam Navy as RVNS "Nguyễn Hấn" (HQ-717), 29 April 1970.

St Margaret, New Fish Street

St Margaret, New Fish Street, was a parish church in the City of London.
The Mortality Bill for the year 1665, published by the Parish Clerks' Company, shows 97 parishes within the City of London. By September 6 the city lay in ruins, 86 churches having been destroyed. In 1670 a Rebuilding Act was passed and a committee set up under the stewardship of Sir Christopher Wren to decide which would be rebuilt. Fifty-one were chosen, but St Margaret New Fish Street where the Monument now stands in Bridge Ward was one of the minority never to be rebuilt. Variously called "St Margaret Bridge Street" and "St Margaret Fish Street Hill", it received many gifts from the pilgrims who passed it on the way to and from London Bridge. Following the fire it was united to St Magnus-the-Martyr.

All That (season 6)

"All That"'s sixth season ran from January 15, 2000 to November 4, 2000. This season contained 14 episodes, in addition to 11 specials titled the Best of All That in 1999-2001.
Many changes occurred before the start of this season. Kel Mitchell and Kenan Thompson both left the show after five seasons. Mitchell and Thompson would both go on to film the final season of Kenan & Kel and then leave Nickelodeon altogether. Producers hired then unknown comic Gabriel Iglesias to replace the absence left by Mitchell and Thompson.
Producers also upgraded Nick Cannon and Mark Saul to repertory status. They were the first cast members in the show's history to survive featured status, unlike that of Tricia Dickson, Victor-Cohn Lopez and Zach McLemore in past seasons.
After 13 episodes the show was put on hiatus. To keep the show running, the producers compiled a series called "Best of All That", featuring the season four cast members: Amanda Bynes, Lori Beth Denberg, Kel Mitchell, Josh Server, Danny Tamberelli, and Kenan Thompson. After those six episodes, following were four episodes called "Tunes into TV" (that had skits saluting comedy series), "Peas, Cheese, Bag of Chips" (that had skits featuring food), "Music" (featuring musical guests from the sixth season), and "Dates, Goats, and Romance" (which shows clips from skits that had goats, dates, love or even all three elements). Leon Frierson and Christy Knowings did not have Best Of specials.
Eventually, Nickelodeon canceled "All That", due to crew disputes and a general desire to move on. However, "All That" still had a strong following and was one of the most popular shows on the network. Nickelodeon planned to relaunch the show, starting from scratch.
After the season ended, Bynes went on to have a successful film and television career. Nick Cannon got his own show on Nickelodeon called "The Nick Cannon Show". After the show ended, he went on to have a successful film and TV career and still has strong ties with Nickelodeon. Gabriel Iglesias went on to become a very successful stand-up comedian. Christy Knowings left show business. Leon Frierson left show business to have a normal life. Danny Tamberelli and Mark Saul left show business to focus on school. Josh Server was not successful after leaving the show. He has strong ties to Nickelodeon and has made guest appearances on current Nickelodeon shows.

FV Dresden 06 is a German association football club from Dresden, Saxony.
History.
The club was established in May 1906 as "Sportverein Pretoria Dresden". They soon changed their name to "Fußball Klub Habsburg Dresden" before becoming "Dresden SV 06" in 1914. The club earned its biggest honours to date in 1920 when the won the Gau Ostsachsen (East Saxony) championship. That moved "SV" into the Mitteldeutscher (Central Germany) regional playoff where they were advanced through the first round by defeating "National 1900 Chemnitz" (2:1) before later being eliminated by "VfB Leipzig".
The club was banned and dissolved in 1939 as politically unpalatable under the Third Reich. It was re-established in 1945, following the end of World War II as "Sportgemeinde Laubegast" and became part of East German football competition in the Soviet-occupied part of the country. As was common in East Germany, the team went through a number of name changes play as "BSG Zeiss Ikon Dresden" (1949–51), "BSG Aufbau Dresden-Ost" (1951–65), and "BSG Pentacon Dresden". Throughout this period the club remained an undistinguished local side.
The team was briefly known as "BSG Praktica Dresden" until the loss of their sponsor. On 13 December 1990, the footballers adopted the name "Fußballverein Dresden 06 Laubegast". The Dresdners won the Landesliga Sachsen (V) in 2002, winning promotion to the Oberliga Nordost-Süd where they competed until being sent down in 2005.

Great Lakes Megalopolis

The Great Lakes Megalopolis consists of the group of North American metropolitan areas which surround the Great Lakes region and Saint Lawrence Seaway. It is mainly within the Midwestern United States, the Southern Ontario area of Canada, along with large parts of Pennsylvania, New York, and Quebec. The region extends from the Milwaukee–Chicago corridor to the Detroit–Toronto corridor, and includes, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, Akron, Erie, Fort Wayne, Grand Rapids, Indianapolis, Louisville, Ottawa, Quad Cities, Rochester, South Bend and Toledo, reaching as far east as Buffalo and Pittsburgh, and as far west as Kansas City and the Twin Cities. The region had an estimated population of 59,144,461 as of 2011 and is projected to reach about 65 million by 2025.
History of the concept.
The region was partially outlined as an emergent megalopolis in the 1961 book "Megalopolis: The Urbanized Northeastern Seaboard of the United States" by French geographer Jean Gottmann. Gottmann envisaged the development of megalopoleis in the U.S.: BosWash, from Boston to Washington, D.C., Chipitts from Chicago to Pittsburgh, and SanSan, from San Francisco to San Diego.
In 1965, Herman Kahn speculated about the future of the three megalopoleis in the year 2000, referring to their names as "half-frivolous" and not mentioning Gottman. In the 1960s and 1970s, urban planner and architect Constantinos Doxiadis authored books, studies, and reports including those regarding the growth potential of the "Great Lakes Megalopolis". Doxiadis envisioned Detroit as the central urban area in the Great Lakes Megalopolis.
The Virginia Tech Metropolitan Institute's "Beyond Megalopolis", an attempt to update Gottmann's work, outlined a similar "Midwest" megapolitan area as one of ten such areas in the United States. Over 200 million tons of cargo are shipped annually through the Great Lakes. Half the nation's population growth and two-thirds of its economic growth is expected to occur within the megaregions over the next four decades. The America 2050 project has identified eleven Megaregions of the United States, including the Great Lakes Megalopolis. In Canada, parts of the region are also referred to as the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor.
Economy.
According to the Brookings Institution, if it stood alone as a country, the economy of the Great Lakes region which includes most of the Great Lakes Megalopolis, would be one of the largest economic units on earth (with a $4.5-trillion gross regional product). The Great Lakes contain one-fifth of the world's surface fresh water and have a combined shoreline of 10,210 miles (17,017 km). About 200 million tons of cargo are shipped by way of the Great Lakes each year.
Tourism is an important economic factor in and around the Great Lakes. The Great Lakes Cruising Coalition supports passenger ship cruises through a joint U.S-Canadian venture to Great Lakes Ports and the Saint Lawrence Seaway.

Milagro Vargas

Milagro Vargas (born June 11, 1955) is an American mezzo-soprano known for her distinctive voice and stage presence. She has appeared as an international soloist in operatic, orchestral, chamber music and recital settings.
Family Background and Studies.
Milagro Vargas was born in New York, the daughter of immigrants from Central America. She had early vocal training on scholarship at the Third Street Music Settlement with Beatrice Rippy and Lucy Shelton. She studied with Helen Hodam at Oberlin Conservatory of Music, receiving a Bachelor of Music in 1977, and with Jan DeGaetani at the Eastman School of Music, receiving a Master of Music in 1981. She had additional vocal training with Paul Sperry, Benita Valente and Anna Renyolds.

Career.
DeGaetani would become a major influence on Vargas's singing and approach to music, leading to praise from critics for her vivid but natural performances in traditional styles, and bringing that vocalism to contemporary works.
Vargas was a soloist at the Stuttgart Opera from 1984 to 1992, and worked with conductors including Dennis Russell Davies and Bernhardt Kontarsky, and with stage directors including Götz Friedrich, Achim Freyer and Harry Kupfer. Among her many roles at Stuttgart were Nefertiti in the world premiere and recording of ‘’Akhnaten’’ by Philip Glass, Cherubino in Mozart's ‘’Marriage of Figaro’’, Meg in Verdi's ‘’Falstaff’’, and Orlovsky in Strauss’ ‘’Die Fledermaus’’, Nancy in Britten's ‘’Albert Herring’’ and Tisbe in Rossini's ‘’La Cenerentola’’, Stimme des Waldes in Hans Werner Henze's ‘’König Hirsch’’. She sang Charlotte in Bernd Alois Zimmermann's ‘’Die Soldaten’’, and on the recording which won the Internationalen Schallplattenpreis in 1992. Kupfer brought her to the Komische Oper in Berlin to sing Dorabella in Mozart's ‘’Così fan tutte’’. Other opera engagements include appearances at the Opera de Paris Bastille, Kirov Opera, Bolshoi Opera and the Heidelberg Schlossfestspiele .
Vargas has appeared as a soloist with many orchestras including the Philadelphia Orchestra, Los Angeles Philharmonic, Staatsorchester Stuttgart, Houston Symphony and the Orchestra of St. Luke's. Her performances with conductor Helmuth Rilling include Bach's Mass in B Minor, Beethoven's "Missa Solemnis", and the Grammy Award winning recording Krzysztof Penderecki's Credo.
As a recitalist and chamber music vocalist Vargas has appeared with such artists as Gilbert Kalish, Walter Trampler, Eliot Fisk, Sharon Isbin, David Shifrin, David Finkle, and Wu Han.
Personal life.
Vargas resides with her husband Tom Manoff in Eugene, Oregon, where she is a professor of voice at the University of Oregon. Among her various interests, she works for pro-diversity issues at the university and in the community.

Revenge with Music

Revenge with Music is a musical comedy with book and lyrics by Howard Dietz and music by Arthur Schwartz, that opened on Broadway in 1934. This was the first "book" musical by Dietz and Schwartz.
Background and production.
Dietz, inspired by a trip to Spain, wrote his libretto based on the Spanish novel "El Sombrero de Tres Picos" by Pedro de Alarcon. The duo had wanted to write something other than the revues they had been doing. The musical takes place in Spain in 1800, and involves a young Spanish couple, played by Holman and Metaxa. The story is based on a Spanish folk tale about seduction. 
Produced by Arch Selwyn and Harold B. Franklin, the Broadway production, opened on November 28, 1934 at the New Amsterdam Theatre for a total of 158 performances. The dance ensembles were by Michael Mordkin, direction by Theodore Komisarjevsky, orchestrations by Robert Russell Bennett. The cast starred Charles Winninger, Libby Holman and Georges Metaxa. 
Although this show was considered a failure, it included two hit songs "You and the Night and the Music" and "If There Is Someone Lovelier Than You." The former was used again in "The Band Wagon."

Conquest of 1760

The Conquest (French La Conquête) is the term used in reference to the acquisition of parts of New France by Britain during the French and Indian War, otherwise referred to as part of the Seven Years War. The conquest was undertaken by the British as a campaign in 1758, with the acquisition of Canada made official in the Treaty of Paris that concluded the Seven Years War.
Overview.
The British campaign to conquer Canada began in 1758, starting with the capture of the port of Louisburg, which was followed by the significant victory at Quebec in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham in September of 1759. The campaign was completed with the surrender of Montreal in 1760, the possession of the lands taken by the British during The Conquest were secured during the Treaty of Paris in 1763 at the conclusion of the Seven Years War. 
Under the Treaty, Canada was ceded to the British in exchange for the return of Guadeloupe (which had rich sugar resources) and the right to retain the islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon off the coast of Newfoundland (access to the lucrative Atlantic fisheries). This has traditionally been interpreted by scholars as an indication of diverging ideologies concerning empire, with the British focusing further on land holding and colonization whereas the French focused more on mercantile interests, although some recent scholarship questions or tries to complicate this idea.
Surrender.
On 8 September 1760, Governor General Pierre, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal, surrendered the French colony known as Canada. Britain assured the 60,000 to 70,000 Francophone inhabitants freedom from deportation and from confiscation of property, freedom of religion, the right to migrate to France, and equal treatment in the fur trade (backbone of the local economy). The Treaty of Paris made the northern portion of New France (including Canada and some additional lands to the south and west) officially a British colony. The Quebec Act of 1774 confirmed the previous agreement.

Nail Within

Nail Within was a melodic death/thrash metal supergroup originating from Tel Aviv, Israel. The band was formed up in 2001 by Betrayer vocalist Yishai Swearts and Azazel members Alex Schuster, Evil Haim and Barak Zait. Later, Betzefer guitarist Matan Cohen was added as the second guitarist.<br>
Although the band was short-lived in its first run between 2001 and 2003, it proved to be very influential and in November 2007, the band was reunited, playing a one-off reunion show with Tomas Lindberg as a special guest.
History.
Formation and self-titled debut album (2001–2002).
The band was formed in 2001 by vocalist Yishai Swearts of Betrayer fame, who was joined by guitarist Alex Schuster (of Azazel), bassist Evil Haim (of Azazel and Betzefer) and drummer Barak Zait (of Azazel) under the name Emblaze (which later became a name of a song on the band's debut album). The four were later joined by Betzefer guitarist Matan Cohen who completed the line-up.
Because the band members were known in the Israeli underground metal scene, the band gained some attention right away as a supergroup, and started playing everywhere in Israel. In 2002, a day after supporting Salem on one of their biggest shows in Israel, the band left to Germany to start working on their first studio album with record producer Harris Johns who previously worked with such bands as Kreator, Sodom and Voivod.
While working on the album in Germany, the band got to meet some of the big names in the European heavy metal scene - Mille Petrozza of Kreator, Tomas Lindberg of At the Gates and Robert Gonella of Assassin. By July 2002, the band's record was completed and all of the musicians they met during recording guested as guest vocalists on the album. Tomas Lindberg, Mille Petrozza and Ze'ev Tananboim, of Israeli band Salem, all guested on the track "Dirty Colored Knife", Robert Gonella guested on "Bleed Forever", Lindberg alone on "Under the Spell" and producer Harris Johns himself on "King Obscenity". The drummer on the album was Nir Nakav of Salem, and Salem vocalist Ze'ev Tananboim co-produced the album with Johns. The album was released on the European record label Listenable Records.
Album release party and disbandment (2003).
In January 2003, Barak Zait left the band and Ido Levi, formerly of Betrayer replaced him as a drummer.
In March 2003, the band had a release show for their self-titled album at the Koltura club in Tel Aviv, with guest vocalists Tomas Lindberg and Ze'ev Tananboim. After the release show, vocalist Yishai Swearts announced that he'll be leaving the band. The self-titled album was later released worldwide on June 30, 2003, after the band's break-up.
Reunion (2007).
In October 2007, the band was reunited with Salem drummer Nir Nakav (who played drums on the band's debut album) as drummer. Vocalist Yishay Swearts, guitarists Alex Schuster and Matan Cohen and bassist Evil Haim stayed in the reunited line-up.
On November 23, 2007, the band played their first and only reunion show at the Barby club in Tel Aviv, Israel, featuring special guest Tomas Lindberg of At the Gates, who also guested on the band's album. At their reunion show, the band performed songs from their self-titled studio album, as well as some At the Gates songs.
Although the band haven't been seen together after their only reunion show, in an interview with band members Yishay Swearts, Alex Schuster and Matan Cohen, they all expressed their interest in performing live again and recording another studio album, even stating that during their hiatus Schuster wrote enough material for a new full-length album.
Musical style and influences.
The band's musical style is described by the band as a combination of Swedish death metal/melodic death metal and old school thrash metal.<br>
The band members stated such influences as melodic death metal bands At the Gates, In Flames, Dark Tranquility and The Haunted and thrash metal bands such as Slayer, Kreator, Sepultura and Testament.

Pneumatocele

A pneumatocele is a cavity in the lung parenchyma filled with air that may result from pulmonary trauma during mechanical ventilation.
Cause.
A pneumatocele results when a lung laceration, a cut or tear in the lung tissue, fills with air. A rupture of a small airway creates the air-filled cavity. Pulmonary lacerations that fill with blood are called pulmonary hematomas. In some cases, both pneumatoceles and hematomas exist in the same injured lung. A pneumatocele can become enlarged, for example when the patient is mechanically ventilated or has acute respiratory distress syndrome, in which case it may not go away for months.
Diagnosis.
Diagnosis can be made using chest X-ray; the lesion shows up as a small, round area filled with air. Computed tomography can give a more detailed understanding of the lesion. Differential diagnoses, other conditions that could cause similar symptoms as pneumatocele, include lung cancer, tuberculosis, and a lung abscess in the setting of Hyper IgE syndrome (aka Job's syndrome) or on its own, often caused by Staphylococcus aureus infection during cystic fibrosis.
Management and treatment.
Treatment typically is supportive and includes monitoring and observation.

WOFC

WOFC (1130 AM) is a daytime only radio station broadcasting a Sports Talk format, licensed to Murray, Kentucky. The station is currently owned by Forever Communications, Inc. and features programming from ESPN Radio.
In addition to games and commentary of national interest, WOFC features the area’s only local sports show hosted by prominent local athlete and play-by-play man for the Murray High Tigers, Travis Turner.
Local sports updates are given daily from Neal Bradley, and are given as "Brought to you by Froggyland Sports".
Local Programs.
1130 WOFC The Office boasts the only live and local sports talk show in Western Kentucky. The Travis Turner Sports Show offers interviews and insight of local high school sports, along with national guests.
The Travis Turner Sports Show has guests from not only Murray and Calloway County (the main coverage area), but from other parts of the region, because it is the only outlet on a daily basis. This is also assisted by the streaming of his show online at Froggyland Sports.
Froggyland Sports.
Travis Turner is the creator and force behind Froggyland Sports. The site is named for the sister station WFGS-FM and their coverage area. “FLS”, which is what the site is called for short, gives you updates on local “Froggyland” high schools, and streams online the Travis Turner Sports Show.
Along with streaming the Travis Turner Sports Show, “FLS” also broadcasts the Murray High School athletics. This gives extended families the opportunity to listen to how well their young relatives are playing.
Television Simulcasts.
Something unique for The Office is that at most points throughout the day, the programming that is airing can also be seen on television. Nationally this is done with the ESPN channels, but locally in Murray, Kentucky it’s due in part to local cable provide Murray Electric System.
Station Events.
1130 ESPN The Office (along with sister stations WNBS-AM and WFGS-FM) hold different events through the year.
History.
The station went on the air in 1976 as WSJP, owned by father-and-son businessmen Joe and Sam Parker. After merging with WNBS and the FM station now known as WFGS, they sold the stations to Forever Communications. It marked the first time that ownership of all of Murray's commercial broadcasters lay with an out-of-town company. WSJP and WNBS swapped formats and schedules in 2000 to take advantage of the better nighttime signal on WNBS. 
The call sign for 1130 was changed to WRKY and then to WJGY before becoming WOFC on 2007-01-11. This was originally a reference to the station's adult contemporary format, designed to be music that could be played in an office without distracting from work. Although the station reverted to sports talk a year later, the call letters did not change.
The call letters of WSJP coincided with the initials of co-founder Sammy Joe Parker, although the station's official claim was that it stood for their motto "Serving the Jackson Purchase".

Treaty of Namslau

The Treaty of Namslau or Namysłów, also known as the Peace of Namslau, was a peace treaty between King Charles IV of Bohemia and King Casimir III of Poland. It was signed at Namysłów () in Silesia, on 22 November 1348.
Since the restoration of a Polish kingdom under Przemysł II in 1295, the Crown had again disputed sovereignty over the many Duchies of Silesia with the neighbouring Kingdom of Bohemia. As King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia had been crowned Polish king in 1300, his successors from the House of Luxembourg, Bohemian rulers since 1310, also claimed the Polish Crown as their heritage. They took advantage of the tensions within the Piast dynasty and the fragmentation of the former Duchy of Silesia north of the Bohemian borders. By promises as well as by pressure, with the exception of Duke Bolko II the Small, an increasing number of the Silesian Piasts had recognized the sovereignty of Charles' father and predecessor, King John the Blind, from 1327–35.
When King Casimir III succeeded his father Władysław I the Elbow-high in 1333, he found the Polish borders threatened not only by the Bohemian kingdom, but also by the Margraves of Brandenburg, who had extended their territory further eastwards into the "Neumark" region, and foremost by the State of the Teutonic Order, whose plans for expansion had sparked the Polish–Teutonic War (1326–1332) over Pomerelia, Kuyavia and the Dobrzyń Land. In view of the hostile superiority, the Polish king sought for peaceful conflict resolutions: he concluded the Treaty of Trentschin in 1335, renouncing the suzerainty over Silesia, and in 1343 signed the Treaty of Kalisz with the Teutonic Order, which sealed the loss of Pomerelia.
After tensions had settled, Casimir acted cleverly in the rising conflict between the Luxembourgs and the Imperial House of Wittelsbach around the heritage of Countess Margaret of Tyrol. He was able to convert Emperor Louis IV to his column and occupied several Silesian territories south of the Polish border, including the castle of Namysłów. However, the Luxembourgs gained the upper hand, when King John's son Charles IV was elected King of the Romans in 1346. Casimir III had to sign the peace treaty at Namysłów, which affirmed the previous Treaty of Trentschin ratified at Cracow (1339) and Prague (1341). In the Namslau treaty, Casimir again renounced all Polish claims on Silesia, in return for Charles waving all Bohemian claims on the Polish throne. After the 1368 death of Duke Bolko II, all of Silesia passed to the Lands of the Bohemian Crown.

Armageddon (2006)

Armageddon (2006) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and presented by Activision's "Call of Duty 3", which took place on December 17, 2006, at the Richmond Coliseum in Richmond, Virginia. The event starred wrestlers from the SmackDown! brand.
The main event was a tag team match, in which the team of Batista and John Cena defeated the team of King Booker and Finlay. Two featured bouts were scheduled on the undercard, including The Undertaker versus Mr. Kennedy, in a match where the objective was to place an opponent in a hearse located on the entrance stage and drive them out of the arena, which Undertaker won. The other match was an Inferno match featuring wrestlers attempting to set the opponent on fire with flames surrounding the ring. Kane defeated Montel Vontavious Porter.
The event grossed over $423,500 in ticket sales from an attendance of 8,200. Canadian Online Explorer's professional wrestling section rated the WWE Tag Team Championship match a nine out of ten stars, the highest match rating. The event was released on DVD on January 16, 2007 by Sony Music Entertainment. The DVD reached second on "Billboard's" DVD Sales Chart for recreational sports during the week of February 18, 2007, and it dropped to the tenth spot the following week.
Background.
Armageddon (2006) was the seventh annual Armageddon event. Eight professional wrestling matches, were featured on the event's card.
The leading staged rivalry written into the event was between Batista and King Booker. At Survivor Series, WWE's November pay-per-view event, Batista defeated Booker to win the World Heavyweight Championship. On the December 1, 2006 episode of "SmackDown!", one of WWE's primary television programs, King Booker and Finlay both demanded a match against Batista for the World Heavyweight Championship. General Manager Theodore Long, a portrayed match maker and rules enforcer, announced that Booker and Finlay would instead form a tag team to compete against Batista and a partner of his choice at Armageddon. Later that night, Batista announced that his partner would be WWE Champion John Cena, a member of the "Raw" brand. The following week on an episode of "SmackDown!", Batista defeated Finlay by disqualification after Booker interfered on Finlay's behalf. On the December 15 episode of "SmackDown!", Cena defeated Finlay after lifting Finlay up on his shoulders and slamming him to the mat, a move that Cena dubbed the FU.
The secondary rivalry was between The Undertaker and Mr. Kennedy. On the September 8, 2006 episode of "SmackDown!", Kennedy announced that he was looking for a new opponent, one that he had never faced before. Long informed Kennedy that he knew a SmackDown! superstar that had never faced Kennedy, The Undertaker. A match was made between the two for No Mercy, in which Kennedy defeated Undertaker by disqualification. At Survivor Series, Kennedy once again defeated Undertaker in a First Blood match. On the December 1 episode of "SmackDown!", Undertaker fought Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) in a match where neither wrestler won. During the match, MVP was scripted to attempt escaping from the ring, but Kennedy caught him during the process and tried to throw him back into the ring. MVP instead threw Kennedy in. Undertaker then kicked Kennedy in the face, and Kane attacked MVP at ringside. The following week as Kennedy was in the ring, the hearse, appearing to have nobody in the driver's seat, drove into the arena; suddenly, The Undertaker appeared from the back of the hearse, as Kennedy sprung from the ring. Later that night, Kane defeated Kennedy by disqualification after MVP interfered on Kennedy's behalf. On the December 15 episode of "SmackDown!", The Undertaker and Kane teamed together to face Kennedy and MVP in a tag team match, which ended in neither team winning. Kennedy knocked Kane down in the aisle and jumped into the driver's seat of the hearse that had been at ringside for the match, and threatened to run him over with it however the Undertaker appeared in the passenger side seat scaring Kennedy off.
Event.
Preliminary matches.
The first match to air live was between Kane and MVP in an Inferno match. The only way to win an Inferno match was by throwing one's opponent into a fire that surrounded the ring on all four sides. This match was the first time that the Inferno match had been used on pay-per-view in more than . At the start of the match, MVP attempted to leave the ring, but was unable to as the flames surrounding the ring prevented him. Kane kicked MVP in the head and threw him into the ring corner. MVP escaped the ring and was unable to go past the fire, so he returned to the ring and was continuously knocked down by Kane. The finish of the match saw Kane grab MVP and force him backwards into the fire. MVP's costume caught on fire as he ran to the entrance ramp. MVP fell to the floor as WWE workers put out the flames with fire extinguishers.
The following match featured Paul London and Brian Kendrick, William Regal and Dave Taylor, MNM (Joey Mercury, and Johnny Nitro), and The Hardys (Matt and Jeff) in a four-team ladder match for the WWE Tag Team Championship. In this match, the only way to win and capture the titles was by climbing a ladder and releasing the championship belts that were suspended above the ring. Towards the end of the match, while MNM and The Hardys were out of the ring, Regal and Taylor attempted to climb the ladder, but Kendrick managed to knock the pair off. Kendrick fought off Regal and Taylor as London climbed the ladder and captured the titles to win the match for his team and retain the championships. During the match, Mercury suffered a legitimate nose injury after being hit by a ladder.
The third match was a standard wrestling match between The Boogeyman and The Miz. The Boogeyman controlled the majority of the match and eventually won by pinfall after a Falling Chokebomb.
The next match featured Chris Benoit versus Chavo Guerrero (accompanied by Vickie Guerrero) for the United States Championship. Before the bell rang to start the match, Chavo tried to attack Benoit, but as the match began, Benoit retaliated by rushing and hitting Guerrero with his forearm, a move called the clothesline. Benoit and Guerrero wrestled inconclusively until Benoit covered Chavo to try to pin him. Chavo managed to place his foot on top of the bottom rope, which forced Benoit to break the pin per official wrestling match rules. While Guerrero was lying on his stomach, Benoit held Guerrero's face back and legs back, stretching his body, and pinned Chavo to retain the championship and win the match.
The fifth match was the encounter of Gregory Helms and Jimmy Wang Yang for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship. Helms performed a swinging neckbreaker on Yang, a move where Helms grabbed Yang's neck under his armpit and turned around to slam him onto the mat. Yang retaliated, but Helms quickly moved back into the power position and pinned Yang to retain the championship. Helms was bleeding from the mouth as he left the ring.
Main event matches.
The following match was a Last Ride match between The Undertaker and Mr. Kennedy, where the only way to win was by throwing one's opponent into a hearse and driving it out of the arena. During the beginning of the match, The Undertaker tossed Kennedy into steel steps on the side of the ring and then onto the commentator's announcing table. The Undertaker then threw Kennedy into the ring apron, which is the apron covering the area under the ring. Kennedy and The Undertaker wrestled inconclusively until The Undertaker tossed Kennedy on top of the roof of the hearse. The Undertaker then grabbed and lifted Kennedy by the throat and slammed him down onto the roof of the car. After that, The Undertaker grabbed Kennedy and gave him a Tombstone Piledriver onto the roof of the hearse. As he was still in control of the match, The Undertaker threw Kennedy into the hearse and drove it out of the arena to win the match.
After the Last Ride match, Jillian Hall, Layla El, Ashley Massaro, and Kristal Marshall all took part in a "Naughty or Nice" contest, a lingerie contest, where the Diva with the loudest fan reaction would win. The host of the contest was Santa Claus (portrayed by Big Dick Johnson, otherwise Christopher DeJoseph). Johnson declared all four of the Divas as the winners and proceeded to take off his Santa costume and dance to music being played in the arena.
The main event was the tag team match between John Cena and Batista versus the team of King Booker and Finlay. Batista wrestled the match with his left arm taped up due to a previous injury. Both teams wrestlers inconclusively until Cena grabbed Finlay's face and bent it back, stretching Finlay's body, a submission move that Cena dubbed the STFU. Finlay broke the submission hold, and The Little Bastard ran into the ring. Little Bastard attempted to kick Cena, but accidentally kicked himself in his head when Cena moved out of the way. Then, Booker tried to kick Batista, but Batista moved out of the way, and Booker accidentally hit Finlay. Batista then lifted and sat Booker onto his shoulders and slammed him down onto the mat, a move he dubbed the Batista Bomb. Batista pinned Booker to earn the victory for his team.
Aftermath.
On the December 22, 2006 episode of "SmackDown!", King Booker and Finlay demanded a rematch against Batista and John Cena. General Manager Theodore Long informed the pair that they would instead be facing Kane and The Undertaker later that night in a match, which Kane and The Undertaker won. At the Royal Rumble, the Royal Rumble match was held, where the winner is the final person left in the ring after the other twenty nine wrestlers are eliminated by being thrown over the top ring rope. The Undertaker won the Royal Rumble match to earn a title shot at WrestleMania 23. At WrestleMania, he defeated Batista to win the World Heavyweight Championship and maintain his WrestleMania undefeated streak.
Chris Benoit continued to feud with Chavo Guerrero over the WWE United States Championship. On the December 22, 2006 episode of "SmackDown!", Benoit defeated Guerrero in a rematch for the title, with Vickie Guerrero accompanying Chavo to ringside. Benoit won the match by disqualification when Vickie hit Benoit in the head with the championship belt. On the January 12, 2007 episode of "SmackDown!", Mr. Kennedy defeated Chris Benoit in a standard match, with help from Chavo Guerrero. The following week, Benoit defeated Chavo yet again with the championship on the line.
The feuds between Kane and Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP), and The Undertaker and Mr. Kennedy did not continue after the event. On the January 5, 2007, episode of "SmackDown!", Kennedy set the time to beat in the "Beat the Clock" sprint, a tournament based on the time wrestlers win matches, to become the new number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship. On the January 12 episode of "SmackDown!", Kennedy won the "Beat the Clock" sprint by preventing The Undertaker from winning his match and from beating Kennedy's time. At the Royal Rumble, Batista defeated Kennedy to retain the title. The feuds between Gregory Helms and Jimmy Wang Yang, and The Boogeyman and The Miz also did not continue, as Helms was put into a rivalry with The Boogeyman. Yang was put into a temporary rivalry with Tatanka.
Reception.
The Richmond Coliseum has a maximum capacity of 13,000, but that was reduced for the 2006 Armageddon. The event grossed over $423,500 in ticket sales from an attendance of 8,200. "Canadian Online Explorer's" professional wrestling section rated the WWE Tag Team Championship match a nine out of ten stars, the highest match rating. The United States Championship, Cruiserweight Championship, and Last Ride matches all received seven out of ten stars. The main event match received a five and a half stars out of ten rating.
The event was released on DVD on January 16, 2007, by Sony Music Entertainment. The DVD reached second on "Billboard's" DVD Sales Chart for recreational sports during the week of February 18, 2007, and it dropped to the tenth spot the following week. It remained on the chart's "top ten" for two consecutive weeks until the week of March 4, 2007, when it ranked 17th.

Follett's Modern American Usage

"Follett's Modern American Usage" is the book published with the title "Modern American Usage" which was left in draft form and unfinished by Wilson Follett at his death. It was completed and edited by his friend Jacques Barzun in collaboration with six other editors. It is a usage guide for contemporary American English. "Modern American Usage" covers issues of usage, prose composition, and style, including English grammar, syntax and literary techniques.
Pre-publication.
Wilson Follett devoted his last years to composing a book on a subject he had studied all his life: the usage of American English. However, when he died more than two-thirds of the manuscript were still in first draft. People who had read this draft felt that it would be intolerable for this work never to be published, so his friend Jacques Barzun undertook the task of finishing and revising the work on the understanding that he would have help. This came from a group of writers and teachers of English: Carlos Baker, Frederick W. Dupee, Dudley Fitts, James D. Hart, Phyllis McGinley and Lionel Trilling.
Editions and Related Books.
The first edition was published in 1966 as "Modern American Usage", in both hardback and paperback editions. In 1979, an edition edited by Erik Wensberg appeared and this was reissued in hardback in 1998.
Reception.
As the quotations that follow show, Follett was generally compared favourably with Fowler, doing for Americans, as it were, what Fowler had done for the writer of British English. He was considered by expert reviewers to have struck the right balance of prescriptivity and to have trodden the right line between outdated, schoolmarmish rules and laissez-faire liberality in matters of grammar and usage.
The novelist, poet, literary critic and journalist Malcolm Cowley reckoned that the "Guide" was "Sensible, vigorous, and cogent ... Follett deserves a place on the shelf beside Fowler."
Poet and critic Mark Van Doren wrote "This is a book that any conscientious writer will continue to consult as long as he lives."
Clifton Fadiman wrote: "A work comparable to Fowler's classic "Modern English Usage".
Eliot Fremont-Smith wrote in "The New York Times": "Few have been more outspoken their attack on the permissive view than the late Wilson Follett; and his "Modern American Usage" ... may be taken as the most detailed and sustained attack so far on the notion that anything goes — or should go."
The critic and author Louis Kronenberger wrote that Follett's book was "the most highminded book of its kind since Fowler, and perhaps the only book with comparable credentials, sensibilities, and standards."

He also edited "The Work of Stephen Crane" in twelve volumes (1925–27), the first collected edition of Crane's writings.

Paddy Shea

Patrick 'Paddy' Augustus Shea (16 March 1886 – 29 May 1954) was an Australian rules footballer who played for Fitzroy and Essendon in the Victorian Football League (VFL). He was from a talented sporting family, with his brother Mark also having a career at Essendon and his nephew John played cricket for Western Australia. Shea himself was a first-class cricketer with Victoria.
Shea's VFL career began at Fitzroy in 1904 but after one season he opted to move to Western Australia where he joined Goldfields Football Association club Boulder City. He spent three years with Boulder City before returning to Victoria and making his Essendon debut in 1908. 
He played mostly as a half forward flanker and was one of the first players to use the 'banana kick' as well as the 'checkside' punt. This goal sense saw him top Essendon's goalkicking in 1909 with 40 majors. Such was his consistency up forward that he kicked a goal in each of his 17 games in the 1911 season but finished the year with just 25 goals. He was a member of Essendon premiership sides in 1911 and 1912. A Victorian interstate representative, Shea coached Essendon Association in the VFA for a period after retiring from the VFL. He holds the record for most VFL goals kicked at the East Melbourne Cricket Ground, with 85.
As a cricketer Shea was a left-handed batsman and right-arm medium pace bowler. He made three first-class appearances, his debut coming against Tasmania at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1912/13. Although Shea made little impact in the match, his Essendon premiership teammate Bill Sewart scored a century. His second match wasn't until seven years later and was a Sheffield Shield encounter against New South Wales at the SCG. He took the wickets of Test players Charlie Macartney and Arthur Mailey. His final match was against Queensland a week later and he finished his career with 84 runs at 14.00 and five wickets at 43.80.

MCOLN3

Mucolipin-3 also known as TRPML3 (transient receptor potential cation channel, mucolipin subfamily, member 3) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the "MCOLN3" gene. It is a member of the small family of the TRPML channels, a subgroup of the large protein family of TRP ion channels.
Gene.
In human, the "MCOLN3" gene resides on the short arm of chromosome 1 at 1p22.3. The gene is split in 12 exons, which entail the open reading frame of 1659 nucleotides. The encoded protein, TRPML3, has 553 amino acid with a predicted molecular weight of ≈64 kDa. Computational analyses of the secondary structure predict the presence of six transmembrane domains, an ion transport motif (PF00520) and a transient receptor potential motif (PS50272).
In the mouse, "Mcoln3", is located on the distal end of chromosome 3 at cytogenetic band qH2. Human and mouse TRPML3 proteins share 91% sequence identity.
All vertebrate species, for which a genomic sequence is available, harbor the "MCOLN3" gene. Homologs of "MCOLN3" are also present in the genome of insects ("Drosophila melanogaster"), nematodes ("Caenorhabditis elegans"), sea urchin ("Strongylocentrotus purpuratus") and lower organisms including Hydra and Dictyostelium.
Function.
TRPML3 is an inwardly-rectifying cation channel.
Phenotypes.
Mutations of the MCOLN3 gene in mice result in auditory hair cell death and deafness.

Government of Bangladesh

The Government of Bangladesh () is the central government of Bangladesh. The Government is led by the Prime Minister, who selects all the remaining Ministers. The Prime Minister and the other most senior Ministers belong to the supreme decision-making committee, known as the Cabinet.
The current Prime Minister is Sheikh Hasina, leader of the Bangladesh Awami League, who was appointed by the President on 6 January 2009 following the General Election on 29 December 2008. Bangladesh Awami League led by her, and its Grand Alliance (a total of 14 parties) won the two-thirds majority numerically the party controls 230 seats out of 299.
Executive branch.
The President is the head of state, a largely ceremonial post. The real power is held by the Prime Minister, who is the head of government. The president is elected by the legislature every five years and has normally limited powers that are substantially expanded during the tenure of a caretaker government, mainly in controlling the transition to a new government. Bangladesh has instituted a unique system of transfer of power; at the end of the tenure of the government, power is handed over to members of a civil society for three months, who run the general elections and transfer the power to elected representatives. This system was first practiced in 1991 and adopted to the constitution in 1996.
The prime minister is ceremonially appointed by the president, commanding the confidence of the majority of the MPs. The cabinet is composed of ministers selected by the prime minister and appointed by the president.
Legislative branch.
The 300 members are elected by universal suffrage at least every 5 years. There is universal suffrage for all citizens at the age of 18.
"On 16 May 2004, the Jatiyo Sangshad (the National Parliament) passed the 14th constitutional amendment to reintroduce quotas for women (article 65). The number of seats in parliament is to be raised to 345, 45 (15%) of which will be reserved for women in the next parliament. The seats will be allocated to parties in proportion to their overall share of the vote. This quota system replaces the previous quota law which expired in 2001. Until 2001 a system of reserved seats for women was used, where 30 seats out of 330 were reserved to women (chosen by indirect election by the 300 directly elected MPs). This provision of guaranteeing women reserved seats expired in April 2001. This quota system was first introduced by the 1972 Constitution (originally providing for 15 reserved seats for women, out of 315 seats, for a period of 10 years). In 1978 a presidential proclamation enlarged the number of reserved seats to 30 and extended the period of reservation to 15 years from the date of promulgation of the constitution of the Republic in December 1972. The constitutional provision lapsed in 1987 and was re-incorporated in the constitution by an amendment in 1990 to be effective for 10 years from the first meeting of the legislature next elected. This provision also lapsed in 2001. The Parliament elected in October 2001 does not have reserved seats for women. Women's groups are lobbying for these seats to become directly electe]d positions and for the number of reserved seats to be increased."
The 9th Parliament had its first sitting on January 25, 2009.
Judicial branch.
The highest judiciary body is the Supreme Court. Until recently, Chief Justice and judges were recommended by the Prime Minister and formally appointed by the President. Since 1991 political parties during their tenure in government have initiated the separation of the judiciary from control by the executive branch brought about by amendment of the Constitution of Bangladesh in 1975. The separation by presidential promulgation acts have signed and passed. Acts on the separation of Judiciary Administration, Remuneration, Pay and Leave, etc. have all been completed. The Supreme Court have now judiciary and administrative authority over all lower courts.
Administrative divisions.
At the local government level, the country is divided into divisions, districts, subdistricts (Upazila), unions, and villages. The lowest level of local government representative are Local officials of union council those who are elected at the union level election. All larger administrative units are run by members of the civil service.

<doc id="18420485" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18420485" title="Treaty of Trentschin">
Treaty of Trentschin

The Treaty of Trentschin or Trenčín was an agreement signed between King Casimir III of Poland and King John of Bohemia by the agency of Casimir's brother-in-law King Charles I of Hungary on 24 August 1335 at Trenčín Castle in the Kingdom of Hungary (present-day Slovakia). The treaty initiated the transfer of the suzerainty over the former Polish province of Silesia to the Kingdom of Bohemia.
Prelude.
For centuries the rulers of Bohemia and Poland had disputed sovereignty over the Silesian region. In 1137 Duke Soběslav I of Bohemia urged by Emperor Lothair III had officially renounced the lands in favour of the Polish duke Duke Bolesław III Wrymouth. Bolesław died the next year, and in his testament bequested the newly established Duchy of Silesia to his eldest son Władysław II the Exile. Władysław however was expelled by his Piast half-brothers and had to seek help from the Holy Roman Emperor to secure his and his son's rule in Silesia - the beginning of a gradual alienation, while after the death of Władysław's grand-grandson Duke Henry II the Pious in 1241 the Silesian duchy split into numerous petty states under his descendants of the Silesian Piasts.
In 1280 Duke Henry IV of Wrocław, induced by his ambition to gain the Polish Seniorate Province of Cracow, had paid homage to the German king Rudolph of Habsburg and indeed was able to succeed Leszek II the Black as Polish high duke in 1288. Meanwhile, considering the weakening of the Polish sovereignty, for the Bohemian Přemyslid dynasty the occasion arose to once again expand their sphere of influence into Silesia: King Wenceslaus II Přemyslid in 1289 made Duke Casimir of Bytom his vassal and in the renewed struggle of the Polish Seniorate Province upon the sudden death of Duke Henry IV in 1290 forged an alliance with Casimir's brother Bolko I of Opole against the rivaling Polish Piasts Władysław I the Elbow-high and Przemysł II, who finally had to cede Cracow to the Bohemian king one year later. However Wenceslaus at first failed to gain Polish regality, as Przemysł II became High Duke and was crowned in 1295 by Archbishop Jakub Świnka of Gniezno - the first Polish king after the deposition of Bolesław II the Bold in 1079. When Przemysł II was killed in 1296, Wenceslaus II again took the chance, assumed the title of a High Duke, married Przemysł's daughter Elisabeth Richeza and finally was crowned Polish king by Archbishop Jakub Świnka in 1300.
In 1305 King Wenceslaus II died and his son Wenceslaus III, the last Přemyslid, was murdered in the following year. The Polish sovereignty turned again to the Piasts, when Władysław I the Elbow-high became High Duke. Nevertheless Wenceslaus' successors in Bohemia, Henry of Carinthia and Rudolph of Austria also claimed the title of a Polish king but could not prevail. The Bohemian aspirations to power rose again after in 1310 John the Blind, son of King Henry VII of Germany of the mighty Luxembourg dynasty, had assumed the crown and the claims to the Polish throne. Though he failed to succeed his father as King of the Romans, he had several Silesian dukes sweared an oath of allegiance to him against the resistance of Władysław I the Elbow-high: in 1327 he vassalized the dukes of Wrocław and Opole, followed by the dukes of Legnica, Żagań, Oleśnica, Ścinawa und Brzeg in 1329. The tensions itensified when King John campaigned and annexed the Duchy of Głogów in 1331 and began to interfere in the Polish-Teutonic War that broke out in Kuyavia and Dobrzyń Land in the aftermath of the 1308 takeover of Gdańsk.
The treaty.
In 1333 Władysław was succeeded by his son Casimir III, who was prepared for compromise. He resorted to sue the Teutonic Order at the Roman Curia and settled the rising conflict with Bohemia by the provisory Trentschin Treaty: the king "in perpetuity" renounced all Polish claims to Silesia in favour of Bohemia, while John of Luxembourg finally waived his claims to the Polish throne derived from the Přemyslids. The agreement was to be confirmed at the Congress of Visegrád later in November 1335. 
King John now had a free hand to continue vassalizing the Silesian duchies of Ziębice (1336) and Nysa (1342). It was however not until February 9, 1339 that Casimir ratified the treaty in Kraków, however. The agreement was again reaffirmed for the Holy Roman Empire by John's son Charles IV, elected King of the Romans in 1346, in the 1348 Treaty of Namslau with King Casimir III and again in 1372 by Casimir's successor King Louis I.
Bolko II the Small remained the only Silesian duke, who was not content to accept Bohemian overlordship. However, as he had no male heirs and his niece Anna von Schweidnitz had married Emperor Charles IV in 1353, he signed an inheritance treaty, whreafter upon the death of his widow Agnes of Austria in 1392 his Duchy of Jawor finally fell to Bohemia.
Aftermath.
With the Treaty of Trentschin, the split of Silesia off the Polish Crown was made. In 1348 King Charles IV attached it to the Lands of the Bohemian Crown, whereby the Silesian dukes became indirect vassals of the Holy Roman Empire, with no immediate status and no representation at the Imperial Diet. Upon the death of the Bohemian king Louis II at the 1526 Battle of Mohács, his crown lands were inherited by the Habsburg king Ferdinand I and became a constituent of the Habsburg Monarchy. Archduchess Maria Theresa, Bohemian queen from 1740, lost most of the Silesian crown land in the 1742 Treaty of Breslau, after it had been conquered by King Frederick II of Prussia.

HMS Racoon (1808)

HMS "Racoon", sometimes spelled HMS "Raccoon", was an 18-gun ship sloop of the "Cormorant" Class of the Royal Navy. She was built by John Preston, of Great Yarmouth, and launched on 30 March 1808. She sailed as far as Fort Astoria on the Columbia River. She became a hospital ship in 1819 and finally was sold in 1838.
Service.
Her first commander was Commander James Welsh, under whom she was sent to operate off the African coast. He sailed her to Jamaica on 16 June 1809, but died there in November. His replacement was Commander William Black. returning to Portsmouth in 1812.
On 14 January 1813 "Racoon" captured the "Hope", which the enemy recaptured. Still, a £25,000 insurance payment was payable to "Racoon".
"Racoon" sailed from Rio de Janeiro on 6 July 1813 in company with HMS "Phoebe" and HMS "Cherub", sailing around Cape Horn to the Juan Fernandez Islands.
The Royal Navy had been under pressure from the Montreal based North West Company, who were agitating for them to capture the base of their rival, the Pacific Fur Company. At this point "Phoebe" and "Cherub" were detached to search for the USS "Essex", with "Racoon" continuing on. While sailing to the Columbia River an accident during gunnery exercises killed eight and wounded 20.
Before the "Racoon" arrived at their proposed destination of the fur trading outpost of Fort Astoria, the North West Company had completed a deal with the Pacific Fur Company that since British ships would be imminently arriving to "take and destroy everything American on the Northwest coast," that they would purchase the assets, for a third of their value. Black arrived to find the matter already settled, though he went through a ceremony of possession and renamed the facility Fort George.
One person aboard the "Racoon" when she arrived at Fort Astoria was Naukane (also known as John Coxe), a Native Hawaiian. The North West Company had hired him as a laborer and to serve as an interpreter for future visits to the Hawaiian Islands.
Black continued in command of "Racoon", sailing to Lima in 1814. On 15 January "Cherub" and "Racoon" left Rio de Janeiro, excorting a convoy that included the storeships "Prevoyanbte" and , and seven merchantmen. The left

Lieutenant John Mangles (acting) was in command of "Raccoon" at the Cape of Good Hope in 1815.
Captain Alexander Montgomerie replaced Black in 1815. Captain John Cook Carpenter was appointed to command in May 1815.
Post-war and fate.
"Racoon" was re-rated as a 20-gun sixth rate in January 1817, under Captain Robert Worgan Festing in 1817.
Between September and October 1819 she underwent conversion to a convict hospital ship at Portsmouth. She remained in service until the Navy sold her for £820 to Mr. Soames on 16 August 1838.

Frankfurt Egelsbach Airport () is a busy general aviation airport located near Egelsbach, a city in the German state of Hesse. It is just southeast of Frankfurt Airport.
History.
The airport was opened in 1955 with a single grass runway. It proved popular, and by 1957 was already seeing 37,000 movements a year. Because of this, in 1966, an asphalt runway was constructed and by 1977 the number of movements had increased to 126,000 a year. In 2007, about 77,000 movements were made, making it the busiest airport for general aviation in Germany.
To allow for larger aircraft to land, in 2004 construction was started on a runway expansion, which increased the runway length to its current 1,400 meters. In May 2009, NetJets Europe announced that they intended to purchase the airport.
Today NetJets owns 80% of the aerodrome (the other 20% being owned by local communities) and intends to establish IFR procedures at the airport, including an ILS approach. It is also planned to extend the runway by another 270 meters and increase the width by 5 meters.
Facilities.
The airport resides at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has two runways, both in the 09/27 direction (though no left (L) or right (R) markings or indicators are used): a asphalt runway and a grass runway.

Pot Belge is a French term that is used to describe a mixture of drugs illegally used by cyclists. It can be translated as "Belgian mix" or "Belgian stew." English sources have sometimes used the term Belgian pot.
History.
The term is commonly used to describe a mixture of drugs, variously constituted from cocaine, heroin, caffeine, amphetamines, and other analgesics. N.B. the use of the French word "pot" is not a reference to cannabis, and this drug is not normally associated with Pot Belge. A French reference also lists morphine in the mix, and notes that it can also be called "insane person mix," though it's unclear whether this refers to the potential results of its use, or the suggestion that "you have to be crazy to take it."
The mixture has become widely associated with the world of professional cycling where it was used for many years, before the institution of highly regulated testing. There are suggestions that its use among amateur participants has been on the increase as both a recreational and a (relatively cheap) performance enhancing drug.
In his memoir 'Prisonnier du dopage', former pro cyclist Philippe Gaumont describes using the pot belge for winter training purposes more than as aid during competition: "J'ai toujours entendu les anciens dire que prendre les amphétamines pour une grande sortie d'entraînement aide à 'débloquer le moteur'." (rough translation from French: ""I've always hear from old timers that taking amphetamines before a training ride helps to 'unclog the motor'"") Gaumont describes his use of pot belge during a seven-hour training ride of the Cofidis team at in the mountains at Arcalis in 1997, where he easily outdistanced the team's climbers thanks to the drug. After that, he became dependent on the pot belge for training: "Dès que j'étais mal dans ma peau, je prenais du pot belge" (translation: "I'd use pot belge as soon as I didn't feel so good").
The use of Pot Belge became more widely known during the 2006 Bordeaux-based trial following 2004's "Cahors affair". Several well-known professional cyclists were mentioned during the testimony of defendants.

St Laurence Pountney

St Laurence Pountney was a parish church in the City of London. It stood in Candlewick Street in Candlewick Ward until its destruction in the Great Fire of London.
Following the destruction of the majority of parish churches in the City by the Great Fire, the Rebuilding Act was passed and a committee set up under Sir Christopher Wren to decide which would be rebuilt Fifty-one were chosen, but St Laurence Pountney was not amongst them. It was one of the first to perish and many felt it had been helped on its way. Following the fire the parish was united to that of St Mary Abchurch 
The site of the church was retained as a graveyard, and is now a privately owned garden, as is the church's original graveyard, just to the south.

Paddy Bermingham

Patrick "Paddy" J. Bermingham (15 March 1886-Jan 1959) was an Irish police officer and sportsman, specialising in the discus. He was from Moyasta in County Clare and joined the Dublin Metropolitan Police, which in 1925 merged into the Garda Síochána.
Bermingham won ten Irish national discus titles: IAAA titles in 1919 and 1920, and NACAI titles in 1923–4–5–6–7, 1930, 1932, and 1933. He held the Irish record at until 1939. He won five English AAA discus titles: 1924–5–6, 1932, and 1934. He also won four Irish titles in each of the 56 lbs weight throw events: for height (1923, 1925–6, 1929) and for distance (1923, 1925–6–7). He represented Ireland at the Olympics in 1924, but was eliminated in the qualifying round of the discus competition; his longest throw would have qualified for the final six but was discounted as a foul. His best mark of ranked him eleventh overall. He is recorded as having competed in the 1934 British Empire Games, though sources vary as to whether he represented the Irish Free State or Northern Ireland. He finished outside the top seven.
Bermingham also played once for the Irish Free State national football team, in 1934.
He is buried in Mount Jerome cemetery.

Collar the Lot!

Collar the Lot! How Britain Interned & Expelled its Wartime Refugees is a book by Peter Gillman and Leni Gillman. It is a detailed account of British internment policy during the Second World War.
At first, the British government took a relaxed attitude to the tens of thousands of "enemy aliens", most of them refugees who had found sanctuary in Britain from the Nazis. But a panic following the fall of France and the invasion scare in May/June 1940 led to a mass round-up of most Germans in Britain, pro- and anti-Nazi alike. When Italy joined the war thousands of Italians were rounded up too, irrespective of their political allegiances or how long they had lived in Britain. It was at this time that Winston Churchill, so the cabinet minutes record, issued the order: "Collar the Lot!"
MI5 was supposed to be making sensible assessments but in fact contributed to the panic and misjudgment. The authors show that both the Home Office and the Foreign Office took a more liberal line, and would have preferred to allow most of the refugees to remain free.
The book also records the tragic tale of the Arandora Star, in which 1500 internees were being deported to Canada. It was sunk by a German U-boat and two-thirds of those on board were drowned. The authors interviewed survivors in Britain, the US, and Australia. Many of them were deported again on a second liner, the Dunera; this time heading for Australia. During the voyage the Dunera narrowly survived another U-boat attack. There were two more deportation voyages to Canada before the outcry over the Arandora Star led the British government to revise its policy. From that point on, the internees were gradually released from their holding camps in Britain, leaving only a hard core of confirmed Nazis and Fascists.
The book won very favourable reviews when it was published, and became the standard reference source on that topic, until the issue was reopened twenty years later.

The Light Corridor

The Light Corridor is a first-person puzzle game available for Atari ST, Amiga, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, DOS, MSX and ZX Spectrum. It was released in 1990 by Infogrames.
Plot.
The player must capture the light rays in order to accomplish the ultimate challenge: the illumination of the stars in a newborn universe.
Gameplay.
The game can be played by one or two players. Both gameplay modes are the same, with the two player mode allowing the players to take turns.
The player uses a paddle to navigate a metal sphere down a long corridor. The player releases the ball (which is stuck to the paddle at the beginning of the game) and it will fly down the corridor until it hits a wall or similar obstacle and bounces back towards the player. The player uses the time the ball spends travelling to walk down the corridor. The colour of the walls changes as the player moves further down the tunnel. When the ball returns, the player must deflect it and send it back down the corridor. The object of the game is to reach the end of the corridor without allowing the ball to avoid the paddle and hit the player. If this happens, the player will lose a life. The game will continue from where the player stopped, and the ball will once again be attached to the paddle.
Obstacles such as moving elevator-style doors make navigating corridors difficult and success relies on the player’s quick reactions. Collectable power-ups make progress easier. The colour of the corridor changes after every four levels, and there are 50 levels in total.
There is a level construction kit included, meaning the player can create their own levels and save them for future use.
Reception.
The game was well received at its release. Sinclair User gave it a 93% overall score, Crash called it "simple but wildly addictive" and Your Sinclair said it was frustratingly difficult but it was worth going back for more.

William Landymore

Rear-Admiral William Moss Landymore, OBE, CD (31 July 1916 – 27 November 2008) was a Canadian naval officer.
Career.
Landymore commenced studies at the Royal Military College of Canada as cadet # 2399 on 28 August 1936. As a cadet, he served aboard the Royal Navy training cruiser HMS "Frobisher" before being sent to the light cruiser HMS "Emerald". He was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy as a midshipman on 1 May 1937 and promoted to acting sub-lieutenant on 1 March 1939.
World War II.
Landymore was posted to the C-class destroyer HMCS "Fraser" in 1940 and survived her sinking after she collided with cruiser HMS "Calcutta" in the Gironde estuary. He was promoted to lieutenant on 1 November 1940 and served aboard the 'River'-class destroyer HMCS "Margaree" and survived her sinking. Landymore served on convoy escort missions in the Atlantic, Arctic, and Pacific Oceans, in the Second World War. He was promoted to acting lieutenant-commander on 5 June 1944.
Cold War.
Landymore was promoted to the substantive rank of Lieutenant-Commander on 1 May 1947 and served as Gunnery Officer aboard HMCS "Uganda" where he earned a Mention in Despatches (MID). He was then stationed as Staff Gunnery Officer at Naval Service Headquarters in Ottawa.
He was promoted to Commander on 1 July 1949 and given command of the 'Tribal'-class destroyer HMCS "Iroquois", where he was awarded a second mention-in-despatches. He was promoted to acting Captain on 14 June 1952. He commanded "Iroquois" for the duration of the Korean War from 21 October 1951 to 31 October 1953.
Landymore was promoted to the substantive rank of Captain on 1 January 1953, and was posted to a variety of stations throughout the remainder of the 1950s, including the position of Commander Canadian Destroyers Far East when he was awarded the Order of the British Empire (OBE).

<doc id="18420686" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18420686" title="Fly fishing tackle">
Fly fishing tackle

Fly fishing tackle comprises the fishing tackle or equipment typically used by fly anglers. Fly fishing tackle includes:
Fly rods.
Sizes and usage.
Fly rods normally vary between 2 m (6 ft) and 4 m (13 ft) in length. Fly rods and lines are designated as to their "weight", typically written as Nwt where 'N' is the number ("e.g." 8wt, 9wt, 10wt).
Rods are matched to the line according to weight. The rod's manufacturer will mark on the rod the fly line weights for which a rod has been designed. One-weight (1wt) rods and lines are the lightest; the weight designations increase up to the heaviest readily available rods and lines at 16-weight (16wt). In general, 1wt through 2wt would be in the class used for small trout, and panfish, 3wt and 4wt are popular for small-stream fishing, 5wt is often considered the all-around rod for trout, 6wt and 7wt are used on large rivers and for fishing with streamers, 8wt to 9wt rods and lines might be used for steelhead or salmon in medium rivers, as well as for bass fishing with large flies and as lightweight salt water use, and 10-11wt rods and lines would be used for pursuing large salt water gamefish under conditions of high wind or surf. The heaviest rods (12–16wt) are mostly used for bluewater species (billfish, tuna) while fishing from a boat. The characteristics of these rods reflect the fact that only short casts are needed during this type of fly fishing, while lifting ability is at a premium.
The species pursued, under which conditions, will largely determine the weight of rod selected. Next, it is important to match the line to the weight of the rod. Using too heavy a line on too light on a rod, or "vice versa", will dramatically affect casting performance. It may also permanently warp the rod blank. Generally speaking, you can safely go one line weight more or less (i.e. using an 8wt or 10wt line on a 9wt rod). There are also rods stamped with a range of weights. For example, a rod may be rated 7-8wt. This indicates the rod is designed for either a 7 or 8 weight fly line. There are also some rods rated for wider ranges (e.g. 8-9-10wt). The drawback to multi-rated rods is that compromises in flexibility or action are made in order to accommodate a wider range of line weights. For example, a rod rated for 8-9 weight line will be slightly stiffer than a straight 8wt but slightly softer than a straight 9wt rod.
Saltwater fly rods are built to handle powerful fish and to cast large, bulky flies over longer distances or into strong winds. Saltwater fly rods are normally fitted with heavier, corrosion-resistant fittings. The reel seat may also be equipped with a short extension often called a "fighting butt". Rods for saltwater fishing fall into the 8 to 15 weight class, with 12-weight being typical for most larger species like tuna, dorado (mahi-mahi) and wahoo (ono).
Bamboo and split cane.
The earliest fly rods were made from greenheart, a tropical wood, and later bamboo originating in the Tonkin area of Guangdong Province in China. The mystical appeal of handmade split-cane rods has endured despite the emergence over the last 50 years of cheaper rod-making materials that offer more durability and performance: fiberglass and graphite.
Split-cane bamboo fly rods combine sport, history and art. It may take well over 100 hours for an experienced rod builder to select and split the raw cane and then to cure, flame, plane, file, taper, glue, wrap and finish each rod. Quality rods made by famous rod makers may sell for prices well beyond US$2,000; a new rod from a competent, contemporary (though not famous) builder may sell for nearly as much. These rods offer grace, form, and, with their solid mass, surprising strength. Bamboo rods vary in action from slow to fast depending on the taper of the rod. In competent hands, they provide the pinnacle in performance.
Synthetic fly rods.
Today, fly rods are mainly made from carbon fiber/graphite with cork or, less frequently, hypalon being favored for the grip. Such rods generally offer greater stiffness than bamboo, are much more consistent and less expensive to manufacture, and require less maintenance. Fiberglass was popular for rods constructed in the years following World War II and was the "material of choice" for many years. However, by the late 1980s, carbon/graphite composite rods (including premium graphite/boron and graphite/titanium blends) had emerged as the materials used by most fly rod manufacturers. These premium rods offer a stiffness, sensitivity, and feel unmatched by any other synthetic material. Graphite composites are especially well-suited to the construction of multi-piece rods since the joints, known as ferrules, in better-quality graphite rods do not significantly affect overall flex or rod action. Today's modern carbon graphite composite fly rods are available in a wide range of sizes and types, from ultralight trout rods to bass fishing rods and two-handed "spey" rods.
Fly reels.
"Fly reels", or "fly casting reels", with a few exceptions, are really little more than line-storage devices. In use, a fly angler strips line off the reel with one hand while casting and manipulating the rod with the other. Slack line is picked up by rotating the reel spool. Even today, the vast majority of fly reels are manually operated, single-action reels of rather simple construction, with a simple click-pawl drag system. However, in recent years, more advanced fly reels have been developed for larger fish and more demanding conditions. These newer reels feature disc-type mechanical, adjustable drag systems to permit the use of lighter leaders and tippets, or to successfully capture fish that undertake long, powerful runs. Many newer fly reels have large arbors to increase the speed of the retrieve and to improve drag performance during long runs. In order to prevent corrosion, saltwater fly reels often use aluminum frames and spools or stainless steel components with sealed bearing and drive mechanisms.
Some reels with simple click drags are designed to be "palmed" when a fish runs with the line. Palming allows the angler to add additional drag with a light touch of the palm to the rim of the reel. On some reels, palming is difficult or impossible because the spool is fully skirted. With such reels, the only drag that an angler can apply to the line is with one or more fingers directly pinching the line.
The fly line can be retrieved using either hand. Most modern fly reels can be converted to or from left-hand or right-hand retrieve. Many fly anglers who have come to the sport after spending some years as spin casting anglers are more comfortable with a left-hand retrieve. Right-handed "big game" fishers may find the right hand retrieve more efficient. In either case, modern large-arbor reels can be retrieved with fair efficiency using either hand to retrieve.
Fly reels are often rated for a specific weight and type of fly line in combination with a specific strength and length of backing. For example, the documentation supplied with a reel may state that the reel can take of 50 pound-test backing and of fly line. An angler should be able to "load" the reel with the specified length of line and backing and still have sufficient room between the line and the spool's edge. As well, many modern reels are designed to take interchangeable spools. Such spools can be quickly switched, thus allowing an angler to change the type of line in a matter of minutes.
Fly lines.
Fly line is a specialized fishing line that supplies the weight or mass necessary to cast an artificial fly with a fly rod. The first fly lines were constructed of woven horsehair that eventually evolved into woven silk fiber lines. As plastics technologies improved, synthetic materials gradually replaced natural materials in the construction of fly lines. Today’s fly lines are generally constructed of an outside synthetic layer that determines the line’s slickness, buoyancy, shape and weight over an inside core material which determines the line’s strength and flexibility. The typical fly line is long although longer fly lines are manufactured. Fly lines have several characteristics which can be used to describe any given fly line. Some of these characteristics are based on industry standards and norms while others vary considerably between manufacturers.
Fly line manufacturers design and formulate their fly lines with other characteristics as well. Some fly lines are specifically formulated for warm water and cold water conditions, fresh and salt water conditions as well as designs that target a specific type or fish or fishing.
Backing.
Fly line is typically attached to a length of braided or gelspun line wound on the fly reel known as backing. The length and breaking strength of the backing required depends on the overall line capacity of the reel and the type of fish being sought. Backing may be as short as a few yards up to hundreds of yards if the reel has the capacity. Backing can serve two purposes. One is to create a larger diameter spooling surface that allows the fly line to fill the entire fly reel. The other is to provide additional line for fighting heavy or hard fighting fish. A fast running or hard fighting fish may take line from the reel and get "into the backing."
Terminal tackle.
Terminal fly fishing tackle connects the fly line to the artificial fly. This is typically a tapered or level ‘’leader’’ with a ‘’tippet’’ section. Other terminal tackle may include small ‘’strike indicators’’ or weights added to the leader to assist in strike detection and presentation. The leader is a section of fishing line that is attached directly to the end of the fly line. The ‘’tippet’’ section is a section of fishing line attached to the leader to which the artificial fly is attached. Leaders and tippets play a key role in the presentation of the fly to the fish and the subsequent landing of a fish when caught. Leaders and tippets are generally constructed of monofilament or fluorocarbon fishing line. In some fly fishing situations involving toothy fish, tippets are constructed of braided or single strand stainless steel wire.
Tapered leaders.
The tip of a fly line is usually more than 0.030" thick and the eye of a fly hook
may be less than a tenth that size. The two must be joined by a "leader," usually 7 to 10 feet long, nowadays of nylon or similar monofilament, either extruded in a continuous taper or made by knotting together several lengths of nylon of diminishing thickness. These taper from about 0.020" diameter to 0.010" for a large fly or 0.007" for a size 14 trout fly. The right size and stiffness of nylon also helps the leader "turn over" when cast, so as to present the fly naturally, as if not connected with a fishing rod. Anglers usually carry spools of extra fine nylon, to replace the tippet or other sections of a leader as required.
Level leaders and sink tips.
Level leaders are a single diameter of line that connects the fly line to the tippet or fly. Level leaders are typically much shorter than tapered leaders and used with sinking fly lines and heavy flies. Level leaders when used with sinking lines help get the fly deeper faster.
Tippets.
The tippet connects the leader to the fly. Tippet sizes were traditionally expressed as "X" sizes in a scale based on silkworm gut leader material, but nowadays gut has been superseded by a variety of synthetics, mainly monofilaments. Monofilament is calibrated in thousandths of an inch from 0.020" and larger (used for leader butts or in saltwater fishing) to 0.011" (old size 0X) and as small as 0.003" (8X.) Fly fishing records are classed by tippet diameter, not breaking strength, which varies between material and manufacturers. Choice of tippet involves a tradeoff: finer tippets are less visible to the fish, resulting in more strikes, but are more easily abraded and broken. Stiffer or softer tippets may be used depending on water temperature, visibility, and need for abrasion resistance. Some toothy species require specially strong and durable tippets so they will not be bitten through, called "shock tippets," made of thick monofilament or stainless steel wire.
Accessories.
Accessories include an abundance of different tools and gadgets used by fly anglers to maintain and prepare their tackle, deal with fish being caught and personal clothing and apparel specifically designed for fly fishing comfort and safety. Accessories include fly boxes designed to store and carry artificial flies.
Fly boxes.
Fly boxes are designed to store and carry artificial flies in an organized manner. The typical fly angler carries one or more fly boxes while fly fishing. Fly boxes are available in a wide variety of sizes, styles and configurations. Fly boxes store flies using a variety of foam, plastic, clip, metal and containing mechanisms. Probably the most famous fly boxes are made in England by Richard Wheatley who have been manufacturing these since 1860 and maybe the oldest continuous makers of fly fishing tackle in the world.

Paraspecies

A paraspecies (a paraphyletic species) is a species, living or fossil, that gave rise to one or more daughter species without itself becoming extinct. The concept of a paraspecies emerges naturally from the Evolutionary Species Concept. Geographically widespread species that have given rise to one or more daughter species as peripheral isolates without themselves becoming extinct (i.e. through peripatric speciation) are examples of paraspecies. A well-known example is the evolution of modern humans "Homo sapiens" from the ancestral species "Homo rhodesiensis". 
Paraspecies are expected from evolutionary theory (Crisp and Chandler, 1996), and are empirical realities in many terrestrial and aquatic taxa (e.g. Patton and Smith, 1989; Bell and Foster, 1994.; Crisp and Chandler, 1996; Funk and Omland, 2003.; Albert et al., 2004; Turner et al., 2004; Hoskin, 2007; Feinstein, 2008; Lozier et al., 2008). 
The evolution of the polar bear from the brown bear is a well-documented example of a living species that gave rise to another living species. Another examples of a living paraspecies is the North Island tuatara "Sphenodon punctatus", which gave rise to the Brothers Island tuatara "Sphenodon guntheri".

Skorokhod integral

In mathematics, the Skorokhod integral, often denoted "δ", is an operator of great importance in the theory of stochastic processes. It is named after the Ukrainian mathematician Anatoliy Skorokhod. Part of its importance is that it unifies several concepts:
Definition.
Preliminaries: the Malliavin derivative.
Consider a fixed probability space (Ω, Σ, P) and a Hilbert space "H"; E denotes expectation with respect to P
Intuitively speaking, the Malliavin derivative of a random variable "F" in "L""p"(Ω) is defined by expanding it in terms of Gaussian random variables that are parametrized by the elements of "H" and differentiating the expansion formally; the Skorokhod integral is the adjoint operation to the Malliavin derivative.
Consider a family of R-valued random variables "W"("h"), indexed by the elements "h" of the Hilbert space "H". Assume further that each "W"("h") is a Gaussian (normal) random variable, that the map taking "h" to "W"("h") is a linear map, and that the mean and covariance structure is given by
for all "g" and "h" in "H". It can be shown that, given "H", there always exists a probability space (Ω, Σ, P) and a family of random variables with the above properties. The Malliavin derivative is essentially defined by formally setting the derivative of the random variable "W"("h") to be "h", and then extending this definition to “smooth enough” random variables. For a random variable "F" of the form
where "f" : R"n" → R is smooth, the Malliavin derivative is defined using the earlier “formal definition” and the chain rule:
In other words, whereas "F" was a real-valued random variable, its derivative D"F" is an "H"-valued random variable, an element of the space "L""p"(Ω;"H"). Of course, this procedure only defines D"F" for “smooth” random variables, but an approximation procedure can be employed to define D"F" for "F" in a large subspace of "L""p"(Ω); the domain of D is the closure of the smooth random variables in the seminorm :
formula_6
This space is denoted by D1,"p" and is called the Watanabe-Sobolev space.
The Skorokhod integral.
For simplicity, consider now just the case "p" = 2. The Skorokhod integral "δ" is defined to be the "L"2-adjoint of the Malliavin derivative D. Just as D was not defined on the whole of "L"2(Ω), "δ" is not defined on the whole of "L"2(Ω; "H"): the domain of "δ" consists of those processes "u" in "L"2(Ω; "H") for which there exists a constant "C"("u") such that, for all "F" in D1,2,
The Skorokhod integral of a process "u" in "L"2(Ω; "H") is a real-valued random variable "δu" in "L"2(Ω); if "u" lies in the domain of "δ", then "δu" is defined by the relation that, for all "F" ∈ D1,2,
Just as the Malliavin derivative D was first defined on simple, smooth random variables, the Skorokhod integral has a simple expression for “simple processes”: if "u" is given by
with "F""j" smooth and "h""j" in "H", then

Paul Keres Memorial Tournament

The Paul Keres Memorial Tournament is a chess tournament played in honour of chess grandmaster Paul Keres (1916–1975). It usually takes place in Vancouver, Canada and Tallinn, Estonia.
An annual international chess tournament has been held in Tallinn every other year since 1969. Keres won this tournament in 1971 and 1975. Starting in 1977 after Keres' death, it has been called the Paul Keres Memorial Tournament. From 1991, the tournament has been held yearly and changed into a rapid event. From 1999 this tournament also had a women's section. In the past twenty years, apart from this rapid tournament, several other memorial tournaments have been played in honour of Keres.
In 1975, Keres won a tournament in Vancouver. It was his last tournament he would ever play in, as on his way back to his native Estonia, he died from a heart attack. There has been an annual memorial tournament in Vancouver ever since.
Tallinn.
Tallinn International.
The Tallinn International has been held every other year from 1969 to 1989. It was named after Keres from 1977.
Tallinn Rapid.
From 1991 the Tallinn international has been replaced by an annual rapid tournament. From 1999, the tournament has had a separate women's section.
Keres Memorial Festival.
In the 1990s there have been several Keres memorials in Tallinn which were played at regular time control. These tournaments seem to have been held irregularly. At present there is an annual Keres Memorial Festival which started in 2004 with a special rapid tournament, where Viswanathan Anand emerged as a winner, followed by a regular tournament. The winners of the regular tournament for 2004 and subsequent years are listed below. The field of these tournaments has been notably weaker than that of the rapid tournaments.
Vancouver.
The tournament in Vancouver has been played ever since Keres won it in 1975. It was Keres' final tournament, as he died shortly thereafter.

Wild Swans (ballet)

Wild Swans is a ballet by Soviet-born Australian composer Elena Kats-Chernin.
The story is based on "The Wild Swans" by Hans Christian Andersen, and tells the tale of Eliza, a princess whose wicked-witch stepmother has changed Eliza's eleven brothers into swans. Eliza must knit magic shirts from stinging nettles in order to break the spell and transform her brothers back into human form. With its basis in a fairy tale, the ballet follows in the tradition of Tchaikovsky's "The Nutcracker" and "Swan Lake", with ballet scores by Russian-born composers Prokofiev and Stravinsky also acknowledged influences.
The ballet was commissioned by the Australian Ballet and the Sydney Opera House. The score was completed in 2002 in collaboration with choreographer Meryl Tankard, who also worked with Kats-Chernin on part of the opening ceremony for the 2000 Sydney Olympics. It was given its premiere by the Australian Ballet at the Sydney Opera House on 29 April 2003.
Wild Swans Concert Suite.
Kats-Chernin arranged a 12-movement concert suite from the ballet score. This was recorded by the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra under Ola Rudner, with soprano Jane Sheldon, in 2004 and released on the ABC Classics label along with the composer's Piano Concerto and "Mythic". The suite features prominent parts for soprano soloist; percussion, in particular the xylophone, and alto saxophone. 
The suite was given its Australian concert premiere on 18 May 2008, by the SBS Radio and Television Youth Orchestra, with soprano Simone Easthope, under Matthew Krel, at the Verbrugghen Hall of the Sydney Conservatorium of Music.
Lloyds TSB advertisement.
The "Eliza Aria" recording featuring the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra and Jane Sheldon was chosen for use in a series of television and cinema advertisements for British bank Lloyds TSB under the tagline "For the journey", launched in January 2007. The adverts were created by agency Rainey Kelly Campbell Roalfe Y&R, and feature animations by Studio AKA. They follow the fortunes of a couple who meet on a futuristic-looking train, called The Black Horse, after Lloyds' logo, through to their retirement. Following the initial minute-long advert, further 30-second instalments were aired, each advertising a different financial product. The touching animations combined with Kats-Chernin's music caught the public's imagination, and brought the music to attention in the United Kingdom and further afield.
Following the success of the advertisements, the recording of the suite was re-issued by ABC Classics with a new cover depicting a scene from the advert and from 2011 onwards has been used as the theme music for an ABC Radio National programme ("Late Night Live"), replacing another piece of hers ("Russian Rag").
Derived works.
The "Eliza Aria" was also used as the basis of "The Journey Continues", a dance music single and music video by DJ Mark Brown and singer Sarah Cracknell. The video is notable for its use of thousands of still photographs played in sequence to produce a form of surreal animation.

South African Petroleum Industry Association

SAPIA (South African Petroleum Industry Association) was formed in July 1994 by six of South Africa's leading petroleum refining and marketing companies namely: 
The stated goal of the organization is to represent the interests of the petroleum refining and marketing industry in South Africa. The organization's aim is to ensure that all interested parties clearly understand the contribution that this industry makes to the economic and social development of South Africa. Zenex Oil (PTY) LTD has subsequently become part of Engen Petroleum LTD. Sasol LTD and TEPCO Petroleum (PTY) LTD joined the organization in 2000. Mossgas (PTY) LTD was replaced by PetroSA (PTY) LTD in 2002. 
SAPIA is managed by a board with representation from each of the member companies. The organization's headquarters is situated in Johannesburg with Mr. A (Avhaphani) Tshifularo as its current executive director.
The organization's website provides information as to how fuel prices in South Africa are determined (many liquid fuels in South Africa are subject to price controls). The site also has information on the demand for liquid fuel in South Africa.
SAPIA was in the news early in 1995 during the arguments about the protection that Sasol (then not yet a member) received from government. In protest, SAPIA withdrew from the NEDLAC initiative's liquid fuels task team and was strongly criticized for this move, especially by Cosatu.

CYP2C9*13

Cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9), a member of the CYP2C enzyme subfamily, ranks amongst the most important drug metabolizing enzymes in humans.
Human CYP2C9 has been shown to exhibit genetic polymorphism. In addition to the wild-type protein CYP2C9*1, at least 30 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been reported within the coding region of the CYP2C9 gene producing the variant allozymes. CYP2C9*13 is one of them. It involves a T-to-C transversion at nucleotide position 269 causing a mutation at codon 90, which results in a Leu->Pro substitution. Frequency analysis indicated approximately 2% of the Chinese population carry the allele.
CYP2C9*13 was found in Japanese and Korean, too. CYP2C9*13 allele frequencies in East Asian populations is summarized in Table S of this paper.
CYP2C9*13 allele was correlated with reduced plasma clearance of drugs that are substrates for CYP2C9.

House of hospitality

A house of hospitality is an organization to provide shelter, and often food and clothing, to those who need it. Originally part of the Catholic Worker Movement, houses of hospitality have been run by other organizations, including organizations that are not Catholic or Christian. Founded on principals of Christian anarchism, the houses provide hospitality without charge, and without requiring religious practice or attendance at services.
