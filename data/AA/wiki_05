Edward Said

Edward Wadie Said (; , ""; 1 November 1935 – 25 September 2003) was a professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University, a literary theorist, and a public intellectual who was a founding figure of the critical-theory field of Post-colonialism. Born a Palestinian Arab in the city of Jerusalem in Mandatory Palestine (1920–48), he was an American citizen through his father. Said was an advocate for the political and the human rights of the Palestinian people and has been described by the journalist Robert Fisk as their most powerful voice.
As a cultural critic, academic, and writer, Said is best known for the book "Orientalism" (1978), an analysis of the cultural representations that are the bases of Orientalism, a term he redefined to mean the Western study of Eastern cultures and, in general, the framework of how The West perceives and represents The East. He contended that Orientalist scholarship was, and remains, inextricably tied to the imperialist societies that produced it, which makes much of the work inherently political, servile to power, and therefore intellectually suspect. "Orientalism" is based upon Said's knowledge of colonial literature, literary theory, and post-structuralist theory. "Orientalism", and his other thematically related works, proved influential in the fields of the humanities, especially in literary theory and in literary criticism. "Orientalism" proved especially influential upon the field of Middle Eastern studies, wherein it transformed the academic discourse of the field's practitioners, of "how" they examine, describe, and define the cultures of the Middle East. As a critic, he vigorously discussed and debated the cultural subjects comprised by Orientalism, especially as applied to and in the fields of history and area studies; nonetheless, some mainstream academics disagreed with Said's "Orientalism" thesis, most notably the Anglo-American Orientalist Bernard Lewis.
As a public intellectual, Said discussed contemporary politics and culture, literature and music in books, lectures, and articles. Drawing from his family experiences as Palestinian Christians in the Middle East at the time of the establishment of Israel in 1948, Said argued for the establishment of a Palestinian state, for equal political and human rights for the Palestinians in Israel—including the right of return—and for increased U.S. political pressure upon Israel to recognize, grant, and respect said rights. Moreover, he also criticized the political and cultural politics of the Arab and Muslim regimes who acted against the interests of their peoples. Intellectually active until the last months of his life, he died of leukemia in late 2003.
Biography.
Early life.
Edward Said was born on 1 November 1935, to Hilda Said and her husband, the businessman Wadie Said, in the city of Jerusalem in the British Mandate of Palestine (1920–48). Edward's father was a Palestinian man who soldiered in the U.S. Army component of the Allied Expeditionary Force (1917–19), commanded by General John J. Pershing, in World War I; Wadie Said and his family were granted U.S. citizenship due to his military service, and after acquiring citizenship Wadie Said moved to Cleveland before returning to Palestine in 1920. His mother Hilda, who was born in Nazareth, had a Palestinian father and a Lebanese mother. After the war, in 1919, Wadie Said moved to Cairo and established a stationery business with a cousin. Although his parents practiced the Jerusalemite variety of Greek Orthodox Christianity, Edward was agnostic. He had four younger sisters.
At school.
Said described his childhood as lived "between worlds", the worlds of Cairo and Jerusalem, until he was twelve. In 1947, he attended the Anglican St. George's School in Jerusalem, about which experience he said:
With an unexceptionally Arab family name like "Said", connected to an improbably British first name (my mother much admired Prince of Wales VIII in 1935, the year of my birth), I was an uncomfortably anomalous student all through my early years: a Palestinian going to school in Egypt, with an English first name, an American passport, and no certain identity, at all. To make matters worse, Arabic, my native language, and English, my school language, were inextricably mixed: I have never known which was my first language, and have felt fully at home in neither, although I dream in both. Every time I speak an English sentence, I find myself echoing it in Arabic, and vice versa.
In the late 1940s, the latter school days of Said included attendance at the Egyptian branch of Victoria College (VC), where one classmate was Omar Sharif whom he remembered as a sadistic and physically abusive Head Boy; other classmates included King Hussein of Jordan, and Egyptian, Syrian, Jordanian, and Saudi Arabian boys whose academic careers progressed to their becoming ministers, prime ministers, and leading businessmen of and in their respective countries. In that colonial time, the VC school educated select Arab and Levantine lads to become the Anglicized ruling-class, who, in due course, were to rule their respective countries, upon British decolonization. Victoria College was the last school Edward Said attended before being sent to the U.S.:
The moment one became a student at VC, one was given the student handbook, a series of regulations governing every aspect of school life—the kind of uniform we were to wear, what equipment was needed for sports, the dates of school holidays, bus schedules, and so on. But the school's first rule, emblazoned on the opening page of the handbook, read: “English is the language of the school; students caught speaking any other language will be punished.” Yet, there were no native speakers of English among the students. Whereas the masters were all British, we were a motley crew of Arabs of various kinds, Armenians, Greeks, Italians, Jews, and Turks, each of whom had a native language that the school had explicitly outlawed. Yet all, or nearly all, of us spoke Arabic—many spoke Arabic and French—and so we were able to take refuge in a common language, in defiance of what we perceived as an unjust colonial stricture.
U.S. education.
Said proved a troublesome student; he was expelled from Victoria College in 1951 and ended up in Northfield Mount Hermon School in Massachusetts, a socially élite, college-prep boarding-school where he endured a miserable year of feeling out of place. Nonetheless, he excelled academically and achieved the rank of either first (valedectorian) or second (salutatarian) in a class of one hundred sixty students. In retrospect, Said said that having been sent away to a place so far from the Middle East was a parental decision much influenced by "the prospects of deracinated people, like us, being so uncertain that it would be best to send me as far away as possible". He obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from Princeton University (1957), and then a Master of Arts degree (1960) and a Doctor of Philosophy degree (1964), in English Literature, from Harvard University.
Academic career.
In 1963, Said joined Columbia University as a member of the faculties of the department of English and of the department of Comparative Literature, where he taught and worked until 2003 (he became professor there in 1991); in the course of that tenure, Barack Obama was one of his pupils at Columbia College. In 1974, he was Visiting Professor of Comparative Literature at Harvard College; in 1975–76 he was a Fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Science, at Stanford University; in 1977, he was the Parr Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University, and subsequently was the Old Dominion Foundation Professor in the Humanities; and, in 1979, he was Visiting Professor of Humanities at Johns Hopkins University. After receiving tenure at Columbia, Said would also go on to teach at Yale University.
Said served as president of the Modern Language Association; as editor of the "Arab Studies Quarterly" in the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; on the executive board of International PEN; in the American Academy of Arts and Letters; in the Royal Society of Literature; in the Council of Foreign Relations; and he was a member of the American Philosophical Society.
Claims of biographical dishonesty by Justus Weiner.
Justus Reid Weiner, an American lawyer and resident scholar at the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs think-tank, claimed that Said had been dishonest about his childhood biography. In the article "My Beautiful Old House and Other Fabrications by Edward Said", published in "Commentary" magazine in 1999, Weiner claimed Said lied when he said: "I was born in Jerusalem, and spent most of my formative years there; and, after 1948, when my entire family became refugees, in Egypt". Despite having acknowledged that Edward Said was born in Jerusalem (Palestine), Weiner reported that Edward Said's birth certificate lists a Cairo (Egypt) residential address for the Said family; that the boy Edward did not live his formative, boyhood years in Jerusalem with his family, but in Cairo; and that he had not been a full-time student at the St. George's School, in Jerusalem, because the school's register of students contained no record of his matriculation to the school.
Weiner's article came under criticism immediately ("The Guardian" referring to it as "fierce assault...in a small right-wing periodical"), and Said's account was defended by journalists and historians. In an article in "CounterPunch", Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair reported that Weiner had deliberately falsified the biographic record in order to attack Said. In evidence, the reporters presented an interview of Haig Boyadjian, who said that he had explicitly told Weiner about having been a classmate of Edward Said at the St. George's School, in Jerusalem, a fact omitted from Weiner's biography of Said.
In "The Nation", Christopher Hitchens described Weiner's article as a work of "extraordinary spite and mendacity" and reported that schoolmates and instructors confirmed that Edward Said had been a student at the St. George Academy. In "The New York Review of Books", historian Amos Elon called Weiner's article a "diatribe", and accused him of waging a "personal smear campaign" against Edward Said, and that Weiner had failed to disprove that, in the winter of 1947–48, when the Arab League declared the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the Said family moved from the Talbiya neighbourhood of Jerusalem and returned to Cairo: " and his family sought refuge from the war outside Palestine, as did hundreds of thousands of other Palestinians at the time. The fact remains, that shortly afterward, the family's property in Jerusalem was confiscated. Said and his family became political refugees as the result of the Israeli government's refusal to allow them to return to the country of their birth.
In retort, Justus Weiner accused Elon of intellectual dishonesty and accused Hitchens of having made himself "a poster boy for Palestine". To Hitchens's critique that he had not even interviewed Said, Weiner replied that three years of research had made it unnecessary to interview the man about his childhood in British Palestine, and said, in connection to Said's school days in the Middle East: "The evidence became so overwhelming. It was no longer an issue of discrepancies. It was a chasm. There was no point in calling him up and saying, 'You’re a liar, you're a fraud'".
Said himself, in a response published in "Al-Ahram Weekly" and "CounterPunch", said that Weiner's article was the third such attack to be published in "Commentary", and that the perspective of the authors only produced "calumny and falsehood" and that the article's credibility was "undercut by dozens of mistakes of fact".
Criticism.
Literary criticism.
Said's first book, "Joseph Conrad and the Fiction of Autobiography" (1966), expanded on his doctoral dissertation. In "Edward Said: Criticism and Society" (2010), Abdirahman Hussein said that the novella "Heart of Darkness" (1899), by Joseph Conrad, was the book that proved foundational to Said's entire career and project. Afterwards, Said redacted ideas gleaned from the works of the 17th-century philosopher Giambattista Vico, and other intellectuals, in the book "Beginnings: Intention and Method" (1974), about the theoretical bases of literary criticism. Said’s further bibliographic production featured books such as "The World, the Text, and the Critic" (1983), "Nationalism, Colonialism, and Literature: Yeats and Decolonization" (1988), "Culture and Imperialism" (1993), "Representations of the Intellectual: The 1993 Reith Lectures" (1994), "Humanism and Democratic Criticism" (2004), and "On Late Style" (2006).
Like his post-modern intellectual mentors, the post-structuralist philosophers Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault, Said was fascinated by how the people of the Western world perceive the peoples of and the things from a different culture, and by the effects of society, politics, and power upon literature; thus is Edward W. Said a founding intellectual of post-colonial criticism. Although the critique of Orientalism is his especially important cultural contribution, it was the critical interpretations of the works of Joseph Conrad, Jane Austen, Rudyard Kipling, William Butler Yeats, and other writers, that were the influential scholarship that established his intellectual reputation.
Orientalism.
Said is most famous for the description and analyses of Orientalism as the source of the inaccurate cultural representations that are the foundation of Western thought towards the Middle East, of how The West perceives and represents The East. The thesis of "Orientalism" is the existence of a "subtle and persistent Eurocentric prejudice against Arabo-Islamic peoples and their culture", which derives from Western culture's long tradition of false and romanticized images of Asia, in general, and the Middle East, in particular. That such perceptions, and the consequent cultural representations, have served, and continue to serve, as implicit justifications for the colonial and imperialist ambitions of the European powers and of the U.S. Likewise, Said also criticized and denounced the political and the cultural malpractices of the régimes of the ruling Arab élites who have internalized the false, romanticized representations of Arabic culture that were conceived and established by Anglo-American Orientalists:
So far as the United States seems to be concerned, it is only a slight overstatement to say that Moslems and Arabs are essentially seen as either oil suppliers or potential terrorists. Very little of the detail, the human density, the passion of Arab-Moslem life has entered the awareness of even those people whose profession it is to report the Arab world. What we have, instead, is a series of crude, essentialized caricatures of the Islamic world presented in such a way as to make that world vulnerable to military aggression.
In "Orientalism", Said argued that much Western study of Islamic civilization was political intellectualism meant for European self-affirmation, rather than for objective intellectual enquiry and academic study of Eastern cultures. Hence, Orientalism functioned as a method of practical, cultural discrimination applied as a means of imperialist domination, producing the claim that the Western Orientalist knows more about the Orient than do the Orientals. Said argues that the history of European colonial rule, and of the consequent political domination of the civilizations of the East, distorts the writing of even the most knowledgeable, well-meaning, and culturally sympathetic Western Orientalists; thus was the term "Orientalism" rendered into a pejorative word:
I doubt if it is controversial, for example, to say that an Englishman in India, or Egypt, in the later nineteenth century, took an interest in those countries, which was never far from their status, in his mind, as British colonies. To say this may seem quite different from saying that all academic knowledge about India and Egypt is somehow tinged and impressed with, violated by, the gross political fact—and yet "that is what I am saying" in this study of Orientalism.
"Orientalism" concluded that Western writing about the Orient depicts it as an irrational, weak, and feminised Other, an existential condition contrasted with the rational, strong, and masculine West. This binary relation derives from the European psychological need to create a difference of cultural inequality between West and East; that cultural difference is attributed to immutable cultural "essences" inherent to Oriental peoples and things. "Orientalism" has exerted great intellectual influence upon the academic fields of literary theory and cultural studies, human geography and history, and Oriental studies.
Response to "Orientalism".
"Orientalism" (1978) provoked much theoretic criticism of the work and its thesis as well as personal controversy about Edward Said, the author and the man.
The criticism by Orientalists such as Albert Hourani, Robert Graham Irwin, Nikki Keddie, Bernard Lewis, and Kanan Makiya, addressed what the historian Nikki Keddie said were "some unfortunate consequences" of "Orientalism" upon the perception and the status of their scholarship. 
In "Approaches to the History of the Middle East", the historian Keddie said that, as critical theory, Said's work on Orientalism had:
Moreover, the Anglo-American Orientalist Bernard Lewis was a nemesis especially at odds with the thesis of "Orientalism", wherein Said identified Lewis as:
Lewis replied to Said's characterizations, of his (Lewis's) works as political propaganda, and of him (Lewis) as an anti-intellectual, with essays critical of Said the academic, and of his works; Lewis later was joined in his criticisms of Said by the academics Maxime Rodinson, Jacques Berque, Malcolm Kerr, Aijaz Ahmad, and William Montgomery Watt who said that "Orientalism" (1978) is a flawed account of Western scholarship about "The Orient".
Said felt the consequences of being a politically-militant, public intellectual in 1985: per Said, the Jewish Defense League compared Said to a Nazi because of his anti-Zionism; an arsonist set afire his office at Columbia University; he and his family were repeatedly targeted with death threats.
Influence.
Edward Said was a charismatic public intellectual and something of an "intellectual superstar" in America. His field of inquiry included literary theory and comparative literature, history and political commentary, cultural criticism and music criticism, and other fields. "Orientalism" proved to be an intellectual document central to the field of post-colonial studies, its thesis being considered as historically factual, true, and accurate for the pertinent periods studied, and especially regarding the cultural representations of "Orientals" and "The Orient" presented in the mass communications media of the West. Nonetheless, Said's supporters acknowledged that concerning the German Orientalist scholarship, the scope of "Orientalism" is limited; yet, in the magazine article "Orientalism Reconsidered" (1985), Said said that no-one opponent provided a substantive rationale for claiming that the dearth of discussion about German Orientalism necessarily limits the scholarly value and practical application of the book's thesis. Moreover, in the Afterword to the 1995 edition of "Orientalism", Said presented follow-up refutations of the criticisms that Bernard Lewis registered against the first edition (1978) of the book.
Moreover, his critics and supporters acknowledge the transformative influence of "Orientalism" upon scholarship in the humanities—the former say that is an intellectually limiting influence upon scholars, whilst the latter say that it is an intellectually liberating influence upon scholars. Post-colonial studies, of which Said was an intellectual founder, and a scholarly reference, is a fertile and thriving field of intellectual enquiry that helps explain the post-colonial world, its peoples, and their discontents. Hence the continued investigational validity and analytical efficacy of the critical propositions presented in "Orientalism" (1978), especially in the field of Middle Eastern studies.
The scholarship of Said remains critically pertinent to and intellectually relevant in the fields of literary criticism and cultural studies, notably upon scholars studying India, such as Gyan Prakash (“Writing Post-Orientalist Histories of the Third World: Perspectives from Indian Historiography”, 1990), Nicholas Dirks ("Castes of Mind", 2001), and Ronald Inden ("Imagining India", 1990); and upon literary theorists such as Homi K. Bhabha ("Nation and Narration", 1990), Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak ("In Other Worlds: Essays in Cultural Politics", 1987), and Hamid Dabashi ("", 2007).
Elswewhere, in and about Eastern Europe, Milica Bakić-Hayden developed the concept of Nesting Orientalisms (1992), based upon and derived from the ideas of the historian Larry Wolff ("Inventing Eastern Europe: The Map of Civilization on the Mind of the Enlightenment", 1994) and upon the ideas that Said presented in "Orientalism" (1978). In turn, the Bulgarian historian Maria Todorova ("Imagining the Balkans", 1997) presented her ethnologic concept of Nesting Balkanisms ("Ethnologia Balkanica",1997), which is theoretically related to and derived from Milica Bakić-Hayden's concept of Nesting Orientalisms.
Politics.
Pro-Palestinian activism.
Said became politically active in 1967, to counter the perceived stereotyped misrepresentations with which the U.S. news media explained the Arab–Israeli wars; reportage which he felt was divorced from the historical realities of the Middle East, in general, and Palestine and Israel, in particular. His "The Arab Portrayed" (1968) was an essay wherein he described the images of the Arab, as presented in journalism and some types of scholarship, which he feels are meant to evade the specific discussion of the historical and cultural realities of the peoples who are the Middle East. Since then, he participated in political and diplomatic efforts for the establishment of a Palestinian state.
From 1977 until 1991, Said was an independent member of the Palestinian National Council (PNC). In 1988, he was a proponent of the two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict (1948), and voted for the establishment of the State of Palestine at a meeting of the Palestinian National Council meeting in Algiers. In 1993, Said quit his membership of the PNC to protest the politics that led to the signing of the Oslo Accords, because he thought the accord terms unacceptable, and because they had been rejected by the Madrid Conference of 1991. Especially troublesome to Said was his belief that Yasir Arafat had betrayed the right of return of the Palestinian refugees to return to their houses and properties in the Green Line territories of pre-1967 Israel; and that Arafat ignored the growing political threat of the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories established since the conquest of Palestine in 1967. By 1995, in response to Said's political criticisms, the Palestinian Authority banned the sale of Said's books; however, relations improved when Said publicly praised Yasir Arafat for rejecting Prime Minister Ehud Barak's offers at the Middle East Peace Summit at Camp David (2000) in the U.S.
In the essay "Zionism from the Standpoint of its Victims" (1979), Edward Said argued in favour of the political legitimacy and philosophical authenticity of the Zionist claims and right to a Jewish homeland; and for the right of national self-determination of the Palestinian people. Said's books on the matters of Israel and Palestine include "The Question of Palestine" (1979), "The Politics of Dispossession" (1994), and "The End of the Peace Process" (2000).
In 1998, for the BBC, Said made "In Search of Palestine" (1998), a documentary film about Palestine past and Palestine present. With his son, Said returned to Palestine to confront "Israeli injustice". Despite the social and cultural prestige that BBC cinema products usually enjoyed, "In Search of Palestine" was not broadcast by the television companies of the U.S.
In 2003, Haidar Abdel-Shafi, Ibrahim Dakak, Mustafa Barghouti, and Edward Said established the third-party political organization "Al-Mubadara" (the Palestinian National Initiative), headed by Barghouti, to be a reformist and democratic alternative to the usual two-party politics of Palestine, as an alternative to the respectively extremist politics of the social-democratic Fatah and the Islamist Hamas.
Stone-throwing incident.
On 3 July 2000, while travelling as a tourist in the Middle East with his son, Said was photographed throwing a stone across the Blue Line Lebanese–Israeli border. In the U.S., that image elicited much conservative political criticism that Said's action demonstrated an inherent, personal sympathy with terrorism, thus the "Commentary" magazine journalist Edward Alexander labelled Said as the "Professor of Terror". According to Said, there was not much to the incident: "Mr. Said said he was having a stone-throwing contest with his son and called it a 'symbolic gesture of joy' at the end of Israel's occupation of Lebanon...It was a pebble; there was nobody there. The guardhouse was at least half a mile away. However, the "As-Safir" newspaper reported that a local Lebanese resident said that Said was less than ten metres (ca. 30 ft.) from the IDF soldiers manning the two-storey guardhouse when he aimed and threw the stone over the border fence; the stone struck the barbed wire atop the border fence. Despite the political fracas among conservative Columbia University students and the Anti-Defamation League of B’nai B’rith International (Sons of the Covenant), the University Provost defended Said's action as an academic's freedom of expression: "To my knowledge, the stone was directed at no-one; no law was broken; no indictment was made; no criminal or civil action has been taken against Professor Said".
Nevertheless, Said endured repercussions, such as the cancellation of an invitation to give a lecture to the Freud Society, in Austria, in February 2001. The President of the Freud Society justified withdrawing the invitation from Said by explaining that “the political situation in the Middle East, and its consequences” had rendered an accusation of anti-Semitism a very serious matter, and that any such accusation "has become more dangerous" in the politics of Austria; the Freud Society thus cancelled their invitation to Said in order to "to avoid an internal clash" of opinions, about him, that might ideologically divide the Freud Society.
Criticism of U.S. foreign politics.
In the revised edition of "Covering Islam: How the Media and the Experts Determine How We See the Rest of the World" (1997), Said criticized the Orientalist bias of the Western news media's reportage about the Middle East and Islam, especially the tendency towards editorializing "speculations about the latest conspiracy to blow up buildings, sabotage commercial airliners, and poison water supplies". He referred to the military involvement of the U.S. in the Kosovo War (1998–99) as an imperialist action and described the 1998 Iraq Liberation Act as the political license that predisposed the U.S. to invade Iraq in 2003. He claimed that the continual support of Israel by successive U.S. presidential governments, as actions meant to perpetuate regional political instability in the Middle East. He criticized the 2003 invasion of Iraq in mid-2003, and, in the Egyptian "Al-Ahram Weekly" newspaper, said that the U.S. war against Iraq was a politically ill-conceived military enterprise:
My strong opinion, though I don’t have any proof, in the classical sense of the word, is that they want to change the entire Middle East, and the Arab world, perhaps terminate some countries, destroy the so-called terrorist groups they dislike, and install régimes friendly to the United States. I think this is a dream that has very little basis in reality. The knowledge they have of the Middle East, to judge from the people who advise them, is, to say the least, out of date and widely speculative.
In January 2006, anthropologist David Price obtained 147 pages of the 283-page political dossier that the FBI had compiled on Edward Said, which indicated that he had been spied upon since 1971, four years since he had become a public intellectual active in the politics to the U.S.
Music.
Said was an accomplished pianist. He worked as the music critic for "The Nation" magazine, and wrote four books about music: "Musical Elaborations" (1991), "Parallels and Paradoxes: Explorations in Music and Society" (2002, with Daniel Barenboim), "On Late Style: Music and Literature Against the Grain" (2006), and "Music at the Limits" (2007). In the latter book he spoke of finding musical reflections of his literary and historical ideas in bold compositions and strong performances.
In 1999, Said and Daniel Barenboim founded the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra, which is composed of young Israeli, Palestinian, and Arab musicians. They also established The Barenboim–Said Foundation in Seville, to develop education-through-music projects. Besides managing the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra, the Barenboim–Said Foundation assists with the administration of the Academy of Orchestral Studies, the Musical Education in Palestine Project, and the Early Childhood Musical Education Project, in Seville. Composer Mohammed Fairouz acknowledged the influence of Edward Said upon his works: compositionally, the "First Symphony" thematically alludes to the essay "Homage to a Belly-Dancer" (1990); and a piano sonata titled "Reflections on Exile"(1984), which thematically refers to the emotions inherent to the eponymous subject.
Awards.
Besides honors, memberships, and postings to prestigious organizations world-wide, Edward Said was awarded some twenty honorary university degrees in the course of his professional life as an academic, critic, and Man of Letters. Among the honors bestowed to him was the Bowdoin Prize by Harvard University. He twice received the Lionel Trilling Book Award; the first occasion was the inaugural bestowing of said literary award in 1976, for "Beginnings: Intention and Method" (1974). He also received the Wellek Prize of the American Comparative Literature Association, and was awarded the inaugural Spinoza Lens Prize. In 2001, Said was awarded the Lannan Literary Award for Lifetime Achievement. In 2002, he received the Prince of Asturias Award for Concord, and was the first U.S. citizen to receive the Sultan Owais Prize. The autobiography "Out of Place" (1999) was bestowed three awards, the 1999 New Yorker Book Award for Non-Fiction; the 2000 Anisfield-Wolf Book Award for Non-Fiction; and the Morton Dauwen Zabel Award in Literature.
Death and legacy.
On 25 September 2003, after enduring a twelve-year sickness with chronic lymphocytic leukæmia, Said died aged 67 in New York City. He was survived by his wife, Mariam, his son, Wadie, and his daughter, Najla, an actress, playwright, and a founder of Nibras, the Arab-American theatre troupe.
Eulogies included Alexander Cockburn, "A Mighty and Passionate Heart"; Seamus Deane, "A Late Style of Humanism"; Christopher Hitchens, "A Valediction for Edward Said"; Tony Judt, "The Rootless Cosmopolitan";, Michael Wood, "On Edward Said"; and Tariq Ali, "Remembering Edward Said (1935–2003)". In November 2004, in Palestine, Birzeit University renamed their music school the Edward Said National Conservatory of Music.
Tributes.
Verso Books published "Waiting for the Barbarians: A Tribute to Edward W. Said" (2008), edited by Müge Gürsoy Sökmen and Bașak Ertür; the essayists include Akeel Bilgrami, Rashid Khalidi, and Elias Khoury, . Routledge published "Edward Said: The Charisma of Criticism" (2010), by Harold Aram Veeser, a critical biography. The University of California Press published "Edward Said: A Legacy of Emancipation and Representations" (2010), edited by Adel Iskandar and Hakem Rustom, and featuring contributions about Said's intellectual legacy by Joseph Massad, Ilan Pappe, Ella Shohat, Ghada Karmi, Noam Chomsky, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, and Daniel Barenboim, among others.
Academic establishments such as Columbia University, the University of Warwick, Princeton University, the University of Adelaide, the American University of Cairo, and the Palestine Center have instituted annual series of lectures about the subjects, topics, and themes that Edward Said discussed in his works; notable among the speakers have been Daniel Barenboim, Noam Chomsky, Robert Fisk, and Cornel West.

Postcolonialism

Post-colonialism (also Post-colonial Studies, Post-colonial Theory, and Postcolonialism) is an academic discipline featuring methods of intellectual discourse that analyze, explain, and respond to the cultural legacies of colonialism and of imperialism, to the human consequences of controlling a country and establishing settlers for the economic exploitation of the native people and their land. Drawing from post-modern schools of thought, Post-colonial Studies analyse the politics of knowledge (creation, control, and distribution) by analyzing the functional relations of social and political power that sustain colonialism and neo-colonialism — the how and the why of an imperial régime’s representations (social, political, cultural) of the imperial colonizer and of the colonized people.
As a genre of contemporary history, Post-colonialism questions and reinvents the modes of cultural perception — the ways of viewing and of being viewed. As anthropology, Post-colonialism records human relations among the colonial nations and the subaltern peoples exploited by colonial rule. As critical theory, Post-colonialism presents, explains, and illustrates the ideology and the praxis of Neo-colonialism, with examples drawn from the humanities — history and political science, philosophy and Marxist theory, sociology, anthropology, and human geography; the cinema, religion, and theology; feminism, linguistics, and post-colonial literature, of which the Anti-conquest narrative genre presents the stories of colonial subjugation of the subaltern man and woman.
Colonialism was presented as “the extension of Civilization”, which ideologically justified the self-ascribed superiority (racial and cultural) of the European Western World over the non-Western world, which Joseph-Ernest Renan espoused in "La Réforme intellectuel et morale" (1871), whereby imperial stewardship would effect the intellectual and moral reformation of the coloured peoples of the lesser cultures of the world. That such a divinely established, natural harmony among the human races of the world would be possible, because everyone — colonizer and colonized — has an assigned cultural identity, a social place, and an economic role within an imperial colony; thus:
From the mid- to the late-nineteenth century, such racialist group-identity language was the cultural common-currency justifying geopolitical competition, among the European and American empires, meant to protect their over-extended economies. Especially in the colonisation of the Far East and in the Scramble for Africa (1870–1914), the representation of a homogeneous European identity justified colonisation — the subjugation of (native) coloured people, and the exploitation of their labour and of the natural resources of their countries. Hence, Belgium and Britain, and France and Germany proffered theories of national superiority that justified colonialism as delivering the light of civilisation to benighted peoples. Notably, "La mission civilisatrice", the self-ascribed civilising mission of the French Empire, proposed that some races and cultures have a higher purpose in life, whereby the more powerful, more developed, and more civilised races have the right to colonise other peoples, in service to the noble idea of “civilisation” and its economic benefits.
Post-colonialism defined.
As an epistemology (the study of knowledge, its nature and verifiability), as an ethics (moral philosophy), and as a politics (affairs of the citizenry), the field of Post-colonialism address the politics of knowledge — the matters that constitute the post-colonial identity of a decolonised people, which derives from: (i) The coloniser’s generation of cultural knowledge about the colonised people; and (ii) How that Western cultural knowledge was applied to subjugate a non–European people into a colony of the European Mother Country, which, after initial invasion, was effected by means of the cultural identities of “coloniser” and “colonised”.
A decolonised people develop a post-colonial identity from the cultural interactions among the types of identity (cultural, national, ethnic) and the social relations of sex, class, and caste; determined by the gender and the race of the colonised person; and the racism inherent to the structures of a colonial society. In Post-colonial literature, the Anti-conquest narrative analyses the Identity politics that are the social and cultural perspectives of the subaltern colonial subjects — their creative resistance to the culture of the coloniser; how such cultural resistance complicated the establishment of a colonial society; how the colonisers developed their post-colonial identity; and how Neo-colonialism actively employs the Us-and-Them binary social relation to view the non-Western world as inhabited by The Other.
The neo-colonial discourse of geopolitical homogeneity conflates the decolonised peoples, their cultures, and their countries, into an imaginary place, such as “The Third World”, an over-inclusive term that usually comprises continents and seas, i.e. Africa, Asia, Latin America, and Oceania. The post-colonial critique analyses the self-justifying discourse of neo-colonialism and the functions (philosophic and political) of its over-inclusive terms, to establish the factual and cultural inaccuracy of homogeneous concepts, such as “The Arabs” and “The First World”, “Christendom” and “The Islamic World”, actually comprise heterogeneous peoples, cultures, and geography, and that realistic descriptions of the world's peoples, places, and things require nuanced and accurate terms.
What West Europeans knew about the peoples of the non-Western world — the homogeneous cultural conceptions of “The Orient”, “The Islamic World”, “The Dark Continent” — originated under specific socio-economic relations between the European coloniser and the colonised non-European Other. The binary social relationship of subject-and-object, of the powerful Occident and the powerless Orient, was conceived, determined, and established with Orientalism, the Western interpretations and representations of non-Western peoples, places, and things.
Using Orientalist “knowledge” (ethnographic, sociologic, anthropologic, et cetera) about the people to be colonised, the colonisers subjugated the natives into a colony in service to the economic interests of their empires. As such, post-colonialism analyses and represents the social relations among the post-colonial world, between “the heart and the margins” of colonialism (the imperial centre and the colonial periphery) to show how “relations, practices, and representations” of the past are either reproduced or transformed, or both, by how knowledge of the world is generated, controlled, and distributed.
Characteristics.
Post-colonialism is the critical destabilization of the theories (intellectual and linguistic, social and economic) that support the ways of Western thought — Deductive reasoning, the Rule of Law, and Monotheism — by means of which colonialists “perceive”, “understand”, and “know” the world. Post-colonial theory thus establishes intellectual spaces for the subaltern peoples to speak for themselves, in their own voices, and so produce the cultural discourses, of philosophy and language, of society and economy, which balance the imbalanced Us-and-Them binary power-relationship between the colonist and the colonial subject.
As a contemporary-history term, "post-colonialism" occasionally is applied temporally, to denote the immediate time after colonialism, which is a problematic application of the term, because the immediate, historical, political time is not included to the categories of critical identity-discourse, which deals with over-inclusive terms of cultural representation, which are abrogated and replaced by post-colonial criticism. As such, the terms "post-colonial" and "post-colonialism" denote aspects of the subject matter, which indicate that the decolonised world is an intellectual space “of contradictions, of half-finished processes, of confusions, of hybridity, and of liminalities”.
In "Post-Colonial Drama: Theory, Practice, Politics" (1996), Helen Gilbert and Joanne Tompkins clarified the denotational functions, among which:
The term "post-colonialism" also is applied to denote the Mother Country’s neo-colonial control of the decolonised country, effected by the legalistic continuation of the economic, cultural, and linguistic power relationships that controlled the colonial politics of knowledge (the generation, production, and distribution of knowledge) about the colonised peoples of the non–Western world.
The cultural and religious assumptions of colonialist logic remain active practices in contemporary society, and are the bases of the Mother Country’s neo-colonial attitude towards her former colonial subjects — an economical source of labour and raw materials. Hence, in "The Location of Culture" (1994), the theoretician Homi K. Bhabha argued that so long as the way of viewing the human world, as composed of separate and unequal cultures, rather than as an integral human world, perpetuates the belief in the existence of imaginary peoples and places — “Christendom” and “The Islamic World”, The First World”, “The Second World”, and “The Third World”. To counter such linguistic and sociologic reductionism, post-colonial praxis establishes the philosophic value of hybrid intellectual-spaces, wherein ambiguity abrogates truth and authenticity; thereby, "hybridity" is the philosophic condition that most substantively challenges the ideologic validity of colonialism.
Critical purpose.
The critical purpose of post-colonial studies is to account for, and to combat, the residual effects (social, political, and cultural) of colonialism upon the peoples once ruled by the Mother Country. To that end, post-colonial theoreticians establish social and cultural spaces for the non–Western peoples — especially the subaltern peoples — whose native cultures were often suppressed by the Western value systems promoted and established as the dominant ideology of the colonial enterprise, said cultural suppression was meant to civilise the natives in the European image, as proposed and justified by the French philosopher Joseph-Ernest Renan in the book "La Réforme intellectuel et morale" (1871), and by the German philosopher G.F.W. Hegel, in the essay “The African Character” (1830).
The critical perspectives and analyses presented in the book "Orientalism" (1978), by Edward Saïd, argued that, in dealing with non–Western peoples, European scholars applied the high-abstraction idealism inherent to the concept of “The Orient”, in order to disregard the existing native societies, and their social, intellectual, and cultural ways of life, in Asia, the Middle East, and of the Muslim peoples. That, in their stead, Orientalist academics substituted their European interpretations and representations of what is and what is not “Oriental”, and of who is and who is not “an Oriental”. That Orientalism supported the self-ascribed cultural superiority of The West, and so allowed Europeans to name, describe, and define, and thereby control, non–European peoples, places, and things.
To that end, post-colonialism critically destabilizes the dominant ideologies of The West, by challenging the “inherent assumptions . . . the material and discursive legacies of colonialism”, by working with tangible social factors such as:
In the definition and establishment of a post-colonial identity, the literature of the Anti-conquest narrative genre is the praxis of “indigenous decolonisation”, whereby writers explain, analyse, and transcend the personal and societal experiences of imperial subjugation, of having endured the imposed identity of “a colonial subject”. By means of their post-colonial literature, the subaltern peoples reply to the Mother Country’s perceived misrepresentation of their humanity; an African example is the novel "Things Fall Apart" (1958), by Chinua Achebe, about the Nigerian experience of being part of the British Empire. Using the native varieties of the colonial languages, the Anti-conquest narrative addresses the Mother Country’s cultural hegemony; by “writing back to the centre” of the empire, the natives create their own national histories in service to forming and establishing a national identity after decolonisation. 
Notable theoreticians.
Frantz Fanon.
In "The Wretched of the Earth" (1961), the psychiatrist Frantz Fanon analysed and medically described the nature of colonialism as essentially destructive; that its societal effects — the imposition of a subjugating colonial identity — are harmful to the mental health of the coloured peoples who were subjugated into colonies. That the ideologic essence of colonialism is the systematic denial of “all attributes of humanity” of the colonised people; that such dehumanization is achieved with physical and mental violence, by which the colonist means to inculcate a servile mentality upon the native men and women, and that the native peoples must violently resist colonial subjugation.
Hence, Fanon described violent resistance to colonialism as a mentally cathartic practice, which purges colonial servility from the native psyche, and restores self-respect to the men and women whom the colonialist subjugated; thus did the psychiatrist Fanon support the "Front de Libération Nationale" (FLN) in the Algerian War (1954–62) for independence from Metropolitan France.
To wit, in 1909, more than fifty years before Frantz Fanon’s social and political diagnoses of colonial subjugation as dehumanizing and harmful to the mental health of the colonised people, Mahatma Gandhi had organised the campaigns for "Hind Swaraj" (Indian self-governance), to resist British colonial rule of India. (See: Benoy Kumar Sarkar) As post-colonial praxis, Fanon’s mental-health analyses of colonialism and imperialism, and the supporting economic theories, were partly derived from the essay "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism" (1916), wherein Lenin described colonial imperialism as a degenerate form of capitalism, which requires greater degrees of human exploitation to ensure continually consistent profit for investment. (See: "Imperialism", 1902, by J.A. Hobson)
Edward W. Saïd.
To describe the Us-and-Them "binary social relation" with which Western Europe intellectually divided the world into “Occident” and “Orient”, the cultural critic Edward W. Saïd developed the denotations and connotations of the term “Orientalism” (an art-history term for Western depictions and the study of The Orient). That the cultural representations generated with the Us-and-Them binary relation are social constructs, which are mutually constitutive and cannot exist independent of each other, because each exists on account of and for The Other.
Notably, “The West” created the cultural concept of “The East”, which Said claims allowed the European suppression of the ability of the peoples of the Middle East, of the Indian Subcontinent, and of Asia, to express and represent themselves as discrete peoples and cultures. Orientalism thus conflated and reduced the non–Western world into the homogeneous cultural entity known as “The East”. Therefore, in service to the colonial type of imperialism, the Us-and-Them Orientalist paradigm allowed Europeans scholars to represent the Oriental World as inferior and backward, irrational and wild, whilst representing Western Europe as superior and progressive, as rational and civil, as the opposite of the Oriental Other. In "Edward Saïd: The Exile as Interpreter" (1993), about "Orientalism", A. Madhavan said that “Saïd’s passionate thesis in that book, now an ‘almost canonical study’, represented Orientalism as a ‘style of thought’ based on the antinomy of East and West in their world-views, and also as a ‘corporate institution’ for dealing with the Orient.”
In concordance with the philosopher Michel Foucault, Saïd established that power and knowledge are the inseparable components of the intellectual binary relationship with which Occidentals claim “knowledge of the Orient”. That the applied power of such cultural knowledge allowed Europeans to rename, re-define, and thereby control Oriental peoples, places, and things, into imperial colonies. The power–knowledge binary relation is conceptually essential to identifying and understanding colonialism in general, and European colonialism in particular; hence:
Nonetheless, critics of the homogeneous “Occident–Orient” binary social relation, said that Orientalism is of limited descriptive capability and practical application, and proposed that there are variants of Orientalism that apply to Africa and to Latin America. To which Saïd replied that the European West applied Orientalism as a "homogeneous" form of The Other, in order to facilitate the formation of the cohesive, collective European cultural identity denoted by the term “The West”.
Gayatri Spivak.
In establishing the Post-colonial definition of the term "Subaltern", the philosopher and theoretician Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak cautioned against assigning an over-broad connotation; that:
Spivak also introduced the terms "essentialism" and "strategic essentialism" to describe the social functions of post-colonialism. The term "essentialism" denotes the perceptual dangers inherent to reviving subaltern voices in ways that might (over) simplify the cultural identity of heterogeneous social groups, and, thereby, create stereotyped representations of the different identities of the people who compose a given social group. The term "strategic essentialism" denotes a temporary, essential group-identity used in the praxis of discourse among peoples. Furthermore, essentialism can occasionally be applied — by the so-described people — to facilitate the subaltern’s communication in being heeded, heard, and understood, because a strategic essentialism (a fixed and established subaltern identity) is more readily grasped, and accepted, by the popular majority, in the course of inter-group discourse. The important distinction, between the terms, is that strategic essentialism does not ignore the diversity of identities (cultural and ethnic) in a social group, but that, in its practical function, strategic essentialism temporarily minimizes inter-group diversity to pragmatically support the essential group-identity.
Spivak developed and applied Michel Foucault’s term "epistemic violence" to describe the destruction of non–Western ways of perceiving the world, and the resultant dominance of the Western ways of perceiving the world. Conceptually, epistemic violence specifically relates to women, whereby the “Subaltern must always be caught in translation, never [allowed to be truly expressing herself”, because the colonial power’s destruction of her culture pushed to the social margins her non–Western ways of perceiving, understanding, and knowing the world.
In June of the year 1600, the Afro–Iberian woman Francisca de Figueroa requested from the King of Spain his permission for her to emigrate from Europe to New Spain, and reunite with her daughter, Juana de Figueroa. As a subaltern woman, Francisca repressed her native African language, and spoke her request in Peninsular Spanish, the official language of Colonial Latin America. As a subaltern woman, she applied to her voice the Spanish cultural filters of sexism, Christian monotheism, and servile language, in addressing her colonial master:
Moreover, Spivak further cautioned against ignoring subaltern peoples as “cultural Others”, and said that the West could progress — beyond the colonial perspective — by means of introspective self-criticism of the basic ideals and investigative methods that establish a culturally superior West studying the culturally inferior non–Western peoples. Hence, the integration of the subaltern voice to the intellectual spaces of social studies is problematic, because of the unrealistic opposition to the idea of studying “Others”; Spivak rejected such an anti-intellectual stance by social scientists, and about them said that “to refuse to represent a cultural Other is salving your conscience . . . allowing you not to do any homework.” Moreover, post-colonial studies also reject the colonial cultural depiction of subaltern peoples as hollow mimics of the European colonists and their Western ways; and rejects the depiction of subaltern peoples as the passive recipient-vessels of the imperial and colonial power of the Mother Country. Consequent to Foucalt’s philosophic model of the binary relationship of power and knowledge, scholars from the Subaltern Studies Collective, proposed that anti-colonial resistance always counters every exercise of colonial power.
Dipesh Chakrabarty.
In "Provincializing Europe" (2000), Dipesh Chakrabarty charted the subaltern history of the Indian struggle for independence, and countered Eurocentric, Western scholarship about non-Western peoples and cultures, by proposing that Western Europe simply be considered as culturally equal to the other cultures of the world, that is, as “one region among many” in human geography. 
Post-colonial nations.
As a critical-theory of literature, Post-colonialism deals with the literatures produced by the peoples who once were colonies of the European imperial powers (e.g. Britain, France, and Spain); and the literatures of the decolonised countries engaged in contemporary, post-colonial arrangements (e.g. "Francophonie" and the British Commonwealth) with their former mother countries.
Post-colonial literary criticism comprehends the literatures written by the coloniser and the colonised, wherein the subject matter includes portraits of the colonised peoples and their lives as imperial subjects. In Dutch literature, the Indies Literature includes the colonial and post-colonial genres, which examine and analyse the formation of a post-colonial identity, and the post-colonial culture produced by the diaspora of the Indo-European peoples, the Eurasian folk who originated from Indonesia; the peoples who were the colony of the Dutch East Indies; in the literature, the notable author is Tjalie Robinson.
To perpetuate and facilitate control of the colonial enterprise, some colonised people, especially from among the subaltern peoples of the British Empire, were sent to attend university in the Imperial Motherland; they were to become the native-born, but Europeanised, ruling class of colonial satraps. Yet, after decolonisation, their bicultural educations originated post-colonial criticism of empire and colonialism, and of the representations of the colonist and the colonised. In the late twentieth century, after the dissolution of the USSR (1991), the constituent soviet socialist republics became the literary subjects of post-colonial criticism, wherein the writers dealt with the legacies (cultural, social, economic) of the Russification of their peoples, countries, and cultures in service to Greater Russia.
Post-colonial literary study is in two categories: (i) that of the post-colonial nations, and (ii) that of the nations who continue forging a post-colonial national identity. The first category of literature presents and analyses the internal challenges inherent to determining an ethnic identity in a decolonised nation. The second category of literature presents and analyses the degeneration of civic and nationalist unities consequent to ethnic parochialism, usually manifested as the demagoguery of “protecting the nation”, a variant of the Us-and-Them binary social relation. Civic and national unity degenerate when a patriarchal régime unilaterally defines what is and what is not “the national culture” of the decolonised country; the nation-state collapses, either into communal movements, espousing grand political goals for the post-colonial nation; or into ethnically mixed communal movements, espousing political separatism, as occurred in decolonised Rwanda, the Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo; thus the post-colonial extremes against which Frantz Fanon warned in "The Wretched of the Earth", in 1961.
The Middle East.
In the essays “Overstating the Arab State” (2001), by Nazih Ayubi, and “Is Jordan Palestine?” (2003), by Raphael Israel, the authors deal with the psychologically fragmented post-colonial identity, as determined by the effects (political and social, cultural and economic) of Western colonialism in the Middle East. As such, the fragmented national identity remains a characteristic of such societies, consequence of the imperially convenient, but arbitrary, colonial boundaries (geographic and cultural) demarcated by the Europeans, with which they ignored the tribal and clan relations that determined the geographic borders of the Middle East countries, before the arrival of European imperialists. Hence, the post-colonial literature about the Middle East examines and analyses the Western discourses about identity formation, the existence and inconsistent nature of a post-colonial national-identity among the peoples of the contemporary Middle East.
Independence and the end of colonialism did not end social fragmentation and war (civil and international) in the Middle East. In "The Search for Arab Democracy: Discourses and Counter-Discourses" (2004), Larbi Sadiki said that the problems of national identity in the Middle East are consequence of the Orientalist indifference of the European empires when they demarcated the political borders of their colonies, which ignored the local history and the geographic and tribal boundaries observed by the natives, in the course of establishing the Western version of the Middle East.
In the event, “in places like Iraq and Jordan, leaders of the new sovereign states were brought in from the outside, tailored to suit colonial interests and commitments. Likewise, most states in the Persian Gulf were handed over to those [Europeanised colonial subjects who could protect and safeguard imperial interests in the post-withdrawal phase.” Moreover, “with notable exceptions like Egypt, Iran, Iraq, and Syria, most . . . [have had to invent, their historical roots” after decolonisation, and, “like its colonial predecessor, post-colonial identity owes its existence to force.”
Africa.
[[File:Colonial Africa 1913 map.svg|thumb|right|300px|Colonialism in 1913: the African colonies of the European empires; and the post-colonial, contemporary political boundaries of the decolonized countries.
In the late 19th century, the Scramble for Africa (1874–1914) proved to be the tail end of mercantilist colonialism of the European imperial powers, yet, for the Africans, the consequences were greater than elsewhere in the colonised non–Western world. To facilitate the colonisation — the European empires laid railroads where the rivers and the land proved impassable. To wit, the Imperial British railroad effort proved overambitious in the effort of traversing continental Africa, yet succeeded only in connecting colonial North Africa (Cairo) with the colonial south of Africa (Cape Town).
Upon arriving to Africa, the Europeans encountered the native African civilisations of the Ashanti Empire, the Benin Empire, the Kingdom of Dahomey, the Buganda Kingdom (Uganda), and the Kingdom of Kongo, all of which annexed by imperial powers under the belief that they required European stewardship, as proposed and justified in the essay “The African Character” (1830), by G.W.F. Hegel, in keeping with his philosophic opinion that cultures were stages in the course of the historical unfolding of The Absolute. Nigeria was the homeland of the Hausa people, the Yoruba people and the people; which last were among the first people to develop their history in constructing a post-colonial identity. (See: "Things Fall Apart", 1958).
About East Africa, the Kenyan writer Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o wrote "Weep Not, Child" (1964), the first post-colonial novel about the East African experience of colonial imperialism; in "The River Between" (1965), as James Ngugi, with the Mau Mau uprising (1952–60) as political background, he addressed the post-colonial matters of native religious culture, and the consequences of the imposition of Christianity, a religion culturally foreign to Kenya and to Africa; and the essay "Decolonizing the Mind: The Politics of Language in African Literature" (1986).
In post-colonial countries of Africa, the Africans and the non–Africans live in a world of genders, ethnicities, classes and languages, of ages, families, professions, religions and nations. There is a suggestion that individualism and post-colonialism are essentially discontinuous and divergent cultural phenomena.
Criticism.
The concentration of Post-colonial Studies upon the subject of "national identity" has determined it is essential to the creation and establishment of a stable nation and country in the aftermath of decolonisation; yet indicates that either an indeterminate or an ambiguous national identity has tended to limit the social, cultural, and economic progress of a decolonised people. In "Overstating the Arab State" (2001), by Nazih Ayubi, the Moroccan scholar Bin ’Abd al-’Ali proposed that the existence of “a pathological obsession with . . . identity” is a cultural theme common to the contemporary academic field Middle Eastern Studies.
Nevertheless, Kumaraswamy and Sadiki said that such a common sociologic problem — that of an indeterminate national identity — among the countries of the Middle East is an important aspect that must be accounted in order to have an understanding the politics of the contemporary Middle East. In the event, Ayubi asks if what ’Bin Abd al–’Ali sociologically described as an obsession with national identity might be explained by “the absence of a championing social class?”

Far-left politics

Far-left politics or extreme left politics are left-wing politics that are further to the left than mainstream centre-left politics. The far left seeks equality of outcome and the dismantlement of all forms of social stratification. Far leftists seek to abolish all forms of hierarchy, particularly the inequitable distribution of wealth and power. The far left seeks a society in which everyone is provided equal economic and social opportunities, and no one has excessive wealth or power over others.
The far left typically believes that inegalitarian systems must be overthrown through revolution in order to establish egalitarian societies, while the centre left works within the system to achieve egalitarianism. In societies that tolerate dissent, far-left groups usually participate in the democratic process to advance their goals. The far left demands radical changes to dismantle unequal societies, including confiscation of wealth that is concentrated in a small elite, and redistribution of that wealth in an egalitarian manner.
Definitions and characteristics.
In France, the term "extrême-gauche" ("far left") is a generally accepted term for political groups to the left of the French Communist Party (such as Trotskyists, Maoists, Anarchists and New Leftist).
Dr. Luke March of the School of Social and Political Science at the University of Edinburgh, defines the "far left" in Europe as those that place themselves to the left of social democracy, which they see as insufficiently left-wing. The two main sub-types are the so-called "radical left", for their desire for fundamental change to the capitalist system while accepting of democracy, and the "extreme left" who are more hostile to liberal democracy and denounce any compromise with capitalism. March sees four major subgroups within contemporary European far-left politics: communists, democratic socialists, populist socialists and social populists.
Hloušek and Kopeček add secondary characteristics to those identified by March and Mudde, such as anti-Americanism, anti-globalization, opposition to NATO and rejection of European integration.
McClosky and Chong surveyed a number of militant, revolutionary far-left groups in the US and they argue that, like far-right extremists, they tend to show traits of authoritarianism. McKlosky and Chong further assert that in the USA, the far-left groups they studied are deeply estranged from American society and highly critical of what they perceive as the spiritual and moral degeneration of American institutions, they view American society as dominated by conspiratorial forces that are working to defeat their ideological aims.
Political parties.
A substantial number of far-left parties gave birth to terrorist organisations during the 1960s and 1970s, such as the Red Brigades and the Red Army Faction.
In the United States, John George and Laird Wilcox have identified the Communist Party USA, Socialist Workers Party, Black Panther Party, Students for a Democratic Society and Progressive Labor Party as some of the groups active on what he refers to as the "far-left".

Dr. Morley Richard Kare (1922–1990) was a physiologist and biologist.
Morley Richard Kare was born in 1922 in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He received his bachelor’s degree in agriculture from the University of Manitoba in 1943, his master’s in nutrition from the University of British Columbia in 1948 and his Ph.D. in physiology from Cornell University in 1952.
Dr. Kare taught physiology at Cornell University, North Carolina State University and the University of Pennsylvania. Although his early research focused on muscle biochemistry and metabolism, he became increasingly interested in the senses of taste and smell and how these senses contribute to nutrition and food choice across species. Kare is best remembered for founding the Monell Chemical Senses Center, a multidisciplinary basic research institute devoted to the science of taste and smell, located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He served as the Center’s first Director from 1968 until his death in 1990, at which point Dr. Gary Beauchamp took over.
In his memory, the Monell Center created the Morley R. Kare Fellows Fund in 1990. The Fund helps support scientists beginning careers in the chemical senses.

Socialist International

The Socialist International (SI) is a worldwide association of political parties which seek to establish democratic socialism. It consists of democratic socialist, social democratic and labour political parties and other organisations.
Although formed in 1951 as a successor to the Labour and Socialist International it has antecedents to the late 19th Century. Initially dominated by parties from Western Europe, it has grown to include more than 160 member parties from more than 100 countries. Its members have governed in many countries including most of Europe. The Party of European Socialists, a European political party is an associated organisation of the SI, as is its European parliamentary group, the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats.
The current secretary-general of the SI is Luis Ayala (Chile), who has held the post since 1989. The current president of the SI is the former Prime Minister of Greece George Papandreou.
History.
The International Workingmen's Association (the First International) was the first international body to bring together organisations representing the working class. It was formed in London on 28 September 1864 by socialist, communist and anarchist political groups and trade unions. Tensions between moderates and revolutionaries led to its dissolution in 1876 in Philadelphia. The Second International was formed in Paris on 14 July 1889 as an association of the socialist parties. Differences over World War I led to the Second International being dissolved in 1916.
International Socialist Commission (ISC, also known as Berne International) was formed in February 1919 at a meeting in Berne by parties that wanted to resurrect the Second International. In March 1919 communist parties formed Comintern (the Third International) at a meeting in Moscow. Parties which did not want to be a part of the resurrected Second International (ISC) or Comintern formed the International Working Union of Socialist Parties (IWUSP, also known as Vienna International/Vienna Union/Two-and-a-Half International) on 27 February 1921 at a conference in Vienna. The ISC and the IWUSP joined to form the Labour and Socialist International (LSI) in May 1923 at a meeting in Hamburg. The rise of Nazism and the start of World War II led to the dissolution of the LSI in 1940. The Socialist International was formed in Frankfurt in July 1951 as a successor to the LSI.
During the post-World War II period, the SI aided social democratic parties in re-establishing themselves when dictatorship gave way to democracy in Portugal (1974) and Spain (1975). Until its 1976 Geneva Congress, the SI had few members outside Europe and no formal involvement with Latin America. In the 1980s, most SI parties gave their backing to the Nicaraguan Sandinistas (FSLN), whose left-wing government had incited enmity from the United States.
Since then, the SI has admitted as member parties not only the FSLN but also the left-wing Puerto Rican Independence Party, as well as former Communist parties such as the Democratic Party of the Left of Italy and the Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO).
Following the Tunisian revolution, the Constitutional Democratic Rally was expelled from the SI in January 2011. Later that month, the Egyptian National Democratic Party was also expelled. As a result of the 2010–2011 Ivorian crisis, the Ivorian Popular Front was expelled in March 2011. However, according to section 5.1.3 of the statutes of the Socialist International, an expulsion requires a decision of Congress by a majority of two-thirds.
On 22 May 2013, the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) along with other social-democratic political parties founded a rival organisation to the Socialist International known as the Progressive Alliance, out of criticism of the perceived corrupt and outmoded nature of the SI.

Dream Street (TV series)

Dream Street was a British children's television series that ran from 6 May 1999 to 2002 on "CITV". The show was narrated by British comedian Russ Abbot, and was aimed at children aged from 2 to 7. The show featured talking toy vehicles, which were radio controlled in real time. The characters were voiced by David Benson-Phillips, Charlotte Bellamy, Chris Jarvis and Emma Tate.
The show was set in a story book resting on the bedside table, and in later series with a child holding it, of a playroom during the night, whilst the child was asleep. The room also includes an element of Dream Street within it - the teddy bear clock. In later series, the title sequence revealed more of the things within the room, such as model Saturn bedposts.
The official slogan was; "Stimulate your child's imagination!, because Dream Street is a world of magical fun!". For Series 3, the theme tune contained the lyric "Get Streetwise", as part of the road safety campaign, which was repeated at the end of the show accompanying a short promo.
CITV, the original broadcaster, repeated the series in 2008-09, but it ended shortly after. However, "Mini CITV", a substandard version of CITV, are the current broadcaster of the series, along with "Tiny Pop".
There have been VHS releases of the series by Carlton Video.

Dunkelgrafen

The Dunkelgraf/Dunkelgräfin (French : "Comte et Comtesse des Ténèbres"; English: "Dark Count & Dark Countess"), is the nickname given by the locals to a wealthy couple who resided from February 1807 until their deaths in the vicinity of Hildburghausen, Thuringia, Germany, mainly in the castle of Eishausen where they settled in 1810. 
Count Vavel de Versay and Sophie Botta.
The man presented himself as Count Vavel de Versay and kept the woman’s identity secret, making only clear that they were neither married nor lovers. They led a secretive life, particularly the Countess who ventured out only in a carriage and with a veil covering her face. 
At her death, on 28 November, 1837, she was buried very fast, possibly without a religious service, in a tomb in the castle's garden. The Count gave her name as Sophie Botta, an unmarried woman from Westphalia. According to Dr. Lommler, the physician who confirmed her death, she was about 60 years of age. 
The Count remained at the castle and died there on April 8, 1845. He was buried in the local cemetery. In the 1920s his identity was found to be "Leonardus Cornelius van der Valck", born 22 September 1769 in Amsterdam, and secretary in the Dutch embassy in Paris from July 1798 to April 1799.
Theories and Marie-Thérèse of France.
The mysterious couple sparked much interest, and speculations about the identity of the Countess started early on. The most notable – though with very little support from historians – proposes that she would be the true Marie-Thérèse, (daughter of Marie Antoinette and her husband King Louis XVI of France), imprisoned with her family on 13 August 1792, during the French Revolution, in the Temple fortress, and redeemed in 1795 in exchange for French prisoners. According to this hypothesis, Marie-Thérèse, traumatized by her trials or pregnant by rape, would have refused to go back in the world; her half sister, Ernestine Lambriquet, would have taken her place.
The theory of substitution (German: "Vertauschungstheorie" / French: "théorie de substitution") sprang immediately after the wedding of Marie-Thérèse with the Duke of Angoulême in 1799. Pictures of the Duchess of Angoulême look remarkably different from pictures of Marie-Thérèse before 1795 and her social style is said to be very unlike that of the original "Madame Royale". Following the theory, it was her half-sister Ernestine Lambriquet ensuring at least a royal lineage. According to her lady in waiting, Mme von Heimbruch, Mary of Hanover believed that she was a Princess of Condé.
As counter evidence are letters of the "Dunkelgräfin" written in German; Sophie Botta, the name given by the count, was not found in any civil registry in Westphalia; as the Dark Count was later identified as Leonardus Cornelius van der Valck, it looks improbable that an officer fighting against the French monarchy would choose a life of covering a royal member for more than three decades; Ernestine Lambriquet's marriage (1810) and death (1813) certificates were registered in France.
Following the 1828 appearance of Kaspar Hauser, a boy who claimed to have been raised in a darkened room, a suspicion about the residents of Castle Eishausen arose. Paul Johann Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach, president of the Bavarian court of appeals, who was investigating the Hauser case, took the boy to castle to see if he recognised any part of it, but Hauser insisted he had no memory of the place.
The "Dunkelgraf/Dunkelgräfin" are the theme of numerous historical essays and fictions in German and French.
Later history.
The derelict Castle Eishausen was torn down in 1887; but the graves of the couple remained.
On 27 June 2012, the City Council ("Stadtrat") of Hildburghausen gave permission for the exhumation of Sophie Botta's body, to conduct DNA testing, and facial reconstruction, in a project sponsored by MDR-Thüringen. The grave was opened on 15 October 2013 and skeletal remains removed. The remains were reinterred with a formal public ceremony in early November, 2013.

Not Quite Human II

Not Quite Human II is a 1989 television program written and directed by Eric Luke and starring Jay Underwood, Alan Thicke, and Robyn Lively. As the second of three films in a series based on the "Not Quite Human" novels by Seth McEvoy, it follows the social development of an android that is designed to appear human, this time as he enrolls in college and is on his own for the first time. The filming locations were Arizona State University, Scottsdale, and Phoenix. 
Plot.
The film begins with Chip (Jay Underwood), the android, installing specially-ordered software designed to enhance his facial expressions; it is later discovered that he also inadvertently intakes a computer virus that causes him to malfunction very gradually, diminishing control over his own system's functions. Initially, the virus simply causes Chip to have momentary memory lapses resulting in poor judgment, but within three days it will completely destroy his internal systems, wiping his memory. That same day, Dr. Jonas Carson (Alan Thicke) and his daughter, Becky (Robyn Lively), attend Chip's high school graduation. Chip mentions that he wants to attend college and has already signed up for the summer session; however, his father does not feel Chip is ready to be on his own. Later, Dr. Carson finds Chip standing motionless in his room with a note attached to his shirt that says he has turned himself off and does not want to be turned back on until his dad agrees to let him attend college. Becky enters the room and manages to persuade her dad to grant Chip's request, and Chip suddenly turns to them and says "Thanks, Dad", revealing that he had merely been acting like he had turned himself off.
Since Dr. Carson only reluctantly agreed to allow Chip to attend college, he and Becky secretly follow him to the school in a vehicle that is set up as a monitoring station in order to watch from a distance. At the school, Chip sees a girl in a lab coat passing through the hall and becomes infatuated with her. The next day, he follows Roberta (Katie Barberi) into the robotics lab and asks her out on date, where she informs Chip that she is an android. Excited by this revelation, Chip tells her that he is also an android. Chip soon learns that Roberta is not able to decide anything for herself, so he introduces her to the concept of free will by reprogramming her. When Roberta chooses to go with Chip instead of returning to Dr. Phil Masters ("iCarly"'s Greg Mullavy) and the other scientists who developed her, the two of them are forced to flee. Prof. Victoria Gray (Dey Young) discovers that her fellow scientists are responsible for distributing a virus designed to disable competitors' androids, so she joins Dr. Carson in trying to catch up with Chip to provide the antidote.
After being relentlessly pursued a great distance, Chip and Roberta finally manage to escape the scientists, and they are surrounded by desert when Roberta explains that running has used up almost all of her power. With the virus's effects growing more pronounced, Chip is unable to control his body very effectively as he carries Roberta and desperately searches for a power outlet to recharge her. Not finding an adequate power source, Chip slumps to the ground as the virus overtakes him, saying haltingly to Roberta, "I... love... you." Dr. Carson and Becky arrive just a moment later with Prof. Gray, and they manage to successfully administer the antidote just before Chip's systems fail completely. Once he is fully revived, Chip reveals that he had utilized his magnetic finger to write all of Roberta's programming and memories to a diskette before she lost all power, preserving the character and personality of the girl that he had fought to protect. A photograph at the end shows the Carsons together with Roberta and Prof. Gray.
Character development.
In each of the three "Not Quite Human" films, Chip is at a distinct level of development in his social awareness. While Chip had difficulty carrying on a sensible conversation in the first film and didn't notice how people perceived him, in "Not Quite Human II" he communicates fairly well but just takes some statements too literally. For instance, when a restaurant waiter asks if the group enjoyed their leek soup, Chip scans the floor and asks "Did I leak soup?" He also sometimes comes close to inadvertently revealing that he is an android, such as when he successfully chases his bus going at full speed down the road. It is this naivety and peculiarity that hinder Chip's efforts to form friendships. Chip's roommate, Brandon Wilson (Scott Nell), does his best to engage Chip in the social scene, but Chip still feels like an outsider. This is why Chip is so glad to encounter Roberta, another android who is also not very developed socially.

Leda and the Swan (Leonardo)

Leda and the Swan is a painting by Leonardo da Vinci, by now lost and considered destroyed.
First Version.
Leonardo began making studies in 1504 for a painting, apparently never executed, of Leda seated on the ground with her children. Three sketches of Leda Kneeling by Leonardo himself exists:
A completed copy of kneeling "Leda and her Children" by Giampietrino is kept at Staatliche Museen, Kassel (c. 1520, oil on wood, 128 x 106 cm).
Completed version.
In 1508 Leonardo painted a different composition of the subject. Picture known as Leda and the Swan depicted a nude standing Leda cuddling the Swan, with the two sets of infant twins, and their huge broken egg-shells. The original of this is lost, probably deliberately destroyed, and was last recorded in the French royal Château de Fontainebleau in 1625 by Cassiano dal Pozzo: 
"A standing figure of Leda almost entirely naked, with the swan at her and two eggs, from whose broken shells come forth four babies, This work, although somewhat dry in style, is exquisitely finished, especially in the woman's breast; and for the rest of the landscape and the plant life are rendered with the greatest diligence. Unfortunately the picture is in a bad state because it is done on three long panels which have split apart and broken off a certain amount of paint."
However the picture is known from many copies, of which the earliest are probably the "Spiridon Leda", perhaps by a studio assistant and now in the Uffizi, and the one at Wilton House in England. Other copies by Leonardeschi include:

Mattabesset

Mattabesset or Mattabeseck refers to the Native American group which had its principal settlement at the Mattabeseck River of what is today Connecticut, United States. It is presumed that the portage offered the Mattabeseck additional opportunities for trade. The Mattabeseck River also forms an extensive swamplands where it meets the Connecticut, which would also have offered a variety of natural resources for exploitation.
Also spelled Mattabesic, or Mattabesec, their land appears to be also referred to as the "Makimanes" and are a branch of the Algonquian Indian tribe or tribes of people. Sowheag, Chief of the Connecticut Indians claimed the allegiance of the Indians of Hartford, Connecticut and Wethersfield, Connecticut also was considered chief of the Mattabesecks. He moved his principal residence to Middletown after Hartford and Wethersfield were occupied by English colonists. His son, Manitowese, claimed the allegiance of Quinnipiac Valley Indians, (Meriden, Connecticut to New Haven, Connecticut).
Whether the Mattabesecks were a distinct tribe or simply the members of a larger tribe resident at Mattabeseck is an open question. The 1920 "Encyclopedia Americana" lists them as part of the Wappinger Confederation. Given the close interplay of the various groups, the best option may simply be to consider them part of one larger tribe, the Connecticut Indians.
The last lands of the Mattabesecks were a small section in Portland on the east side of the river, and a larger tract in the Newfield section of Middletown, still close to the Mattabeseck marshlands. The last remnants of the tribe left in the late 18th century for upstate New York, and were among the many New England Indian groups that merged with the Indians at Schaghticoke.
The Mattabesset spoke a language of the Algonquian family. This language is now extinct.

Best known as an abstract modernist painter, Mr. Saru was very active in Romania, working as both an artist and professor of art at The Fine Art Academy of Bucharest. He is known for his ability to create transparency and a glowing quality through his fine brushwork. His abstract work has a very distinct style and often hides figurative motifs all throughout. George Saru has illustrated many books, children's books, has designed mosaic public art works and has collaborated on tapestry work with his wife, Liana Saru.
He moved to America in the late 80's and although legally blind, he painted until his last days taking on a much different and less detailed, striking brushwork style and painted in much brighter colors. He rests at Calvary Cemetery, New York.

Van Phillips (inventor)

Van Phillips (born 1954) is an American inventor of prosthetics. He is known for the Flex-Foot brand of artificial foot and limbs that he created, and for his charity work for amputees. An amputee himself, having lost a leg below the knee at age 21, Phillips was motivated by the limitations of then-existing artificial limbs to attend the Northwestern University Medical School Prosthetic-Orthotic Center. After graduation, he worked as a biomedical design engineer at the University of Utah before starting his own company, Flex-Foot Incorporated in 1984.
Phillips ultimately created a workable artificial foot made from carbon graphite. Unlike all previous prostheses, it stored kinetic energy from the wearer's steps as potential energy, like a spring, allowing the wearer to run and jump. A prosthetic foot that he created, the Flex-Foot Cheetah, is used by double-amputee and Paralympics gold-medalist Oscar Pistorius, and about 90 percent of Paralympics participants use a variation of the original Flex-Foot design, as well as thousands of people around the world. Phillips sold Flex-Foot to Ossur in 2000, which continues to manufacture the artificial foot. See also Össur#Prosthetics.
In 1999 he established Second Wind, a non-profit organization to provide inexpensive and resistant prostheses to amputees around the world, and is now working to create a prosthetic leg for land mine victims in developing countries. In 1998 he received the Brian Blatchford Memorial Prize from the International Society for Prosthetics and Orthotics.

Russia–Uzbekistan relations

Russia–Uzbekistan relations (, ) is the bilateral relationship between Russia and Uzbekistan. 
Overview.
Both countries have had diplomatic relations since 1992. Uzbekistan was once a former Soviet Socialist republic. It still has strong ties to Russia and the West. In the aftermath of the May 2005 unrest, Uzbekistan demanded that the United States leave the base at Karshi-Khanabad. In November 2005, both presidents Islam Karimov and Vladimir Putin signed a mutual cooperation agreement in Moscow. Uzbekistan has an embassy in Moscow and Russia has an embassy in Tashkent.
Recently, however, Uzbekistan has opted to formally withdraw from the Russian-led CSTO alliance in 2012, leading some to debate whether such a move indicated a shift in its foreign policy to the West. However, Uzbekistan remains a part of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, of which both Russia and China are part of, and of which it is the only non-founding member.

Anna Klemens

Anna Klemens (1718–1800) was a Danish murder victim and an alleged witch. She was lynched and accused of sorcery in Brigsted at Horsens in Denmark, a lynching considered to be the last witch lynching in her country and, most likely, in all Scandinavia.
Long after the legal courts stopped executing witches after the execution of Anne Palles, the belief led to private trials and lynching of alleged witches during the 18th century. On the country side in Øster Grønning in Salling in 1722, the villagers apprehended a woman, Dorte Jensdatter, whom they suspected of having caused several deaths and problems in the village by magic, and held a private witch trial. When they were convinced, they tied her up in her own home and burned the house down with her in it; several of the villagers were later sentenced to death for her murder. Anna Klemens was the last of these lynch cases. 
Anna Klemens was a beggar who consulted a cunning woman together with several other people. When she entered the room, the "Wise One" pointed at her and cried out: "Here we have the master of all the witch craft!" She ordered six of the men present to beat Anna up, as it was the belief that the magic of a witch left her when her blood had been spilt. The people gathered obeyed her, out of fear and respect for the wisdom and judgement of the "Wise one", and Anna died of the abuse. The cunning woman was executed for the murder and the men were banished.

Stropharia aeruginosa

Stropharia aeruginosa, commonly known as the verdigris agaric, is a medium-sized green, slimy woodland mushroom, found on lawns, mulch and woodland from spring to autumn. The edibility of this mushroom is controversial - some sources claim that it's edible, while others claim it to be poisonous, although effects are little known and its toxic constituents undescribed.
Taxonomy.
The French mycologist Lucien Quélet gave it its current binomial name in 1872, after it was initially described as "Agaricus aeruginosus" by William Curtis in 1784. The Dutch mycologist Machiel Noordeloos placed it in the genus "Psilocybe" in 1995. The specific epithet "aerūgǐnōsa" is Latin for "covered in verdigris (copper-rust)".
Description.
The cap is convex, broadening, and becoming umbonate with age. It is from 2–8 cm in diameter. At first it is a vivid blue/green, and very glutinous (slimy), with a sprinkling of white veil remnants around the edge. The colour in the gluten fades, or is washed off as it matures, and it becomes yellow ocher, sometimes in patches, but mostly at the centre. Finally, it will lose the blue-green coloration completely. The stem is quite long and of uniform thickness. It has a fragile brown/black ring, and below this the stem is covered in fine white scales, or flakes. The gills are initially white, then clay-brown, and sometimes have a white edge. The spore print is brownish-purple, and the oval spores 7–10 x 5 μm.
Distribution and habitat.
This mushroom is common in grassy woods, and on roadside verges in Britain, Europe, Asia (Iran) and parts of North America, growing on rotting wood. It particularly favours wood-chip mulches in gardens, and parks.
Edibility and toxicity.
The verdigris agaric is reported as poisonous in many guidebooks printed in the Western Hemisphere, yet the effect of poisoning is little known and toxic constituents unknown. <br>
According to some European guidebooks the verdigris agaric is actually edible, but undesirable due to mildly spicy taste

Charles Osborne (music writer)

Charles Thomas Osborne (born 24 November 1927 in Brisbane, Australia) is a journalist, theatre and opera critic, poet and novelist. He was assistant editor of "The London Magazine" from 1958 until 1966, literature director of the Arts Council of Great Britain from 1971 until 1986, and chief theatre critic of "Daily Telegraph" (London) from 1986 to 1991. He is the only author the Agatha Christie Estate has ever allowed to produce adapted works in her name.
Life and career.
Osborne's father hailed originally from Devon and his mother was from Vienna, a fact to which he attributes his lifelong love of opera. He went to school locally, then studied at the University of Queensland. Osborne then worked in literary and musical journalism and in repertory theatre in Australia and Britain, where he settled permanently in 1953. He played the role of Front Gunner Foxlee in the film "The Dam Busters" (1955), and acted in the play "Black Coffee" by Agatha Christie, which he later adapted as a novel.
From 1958, he was assistant editor of "The London Magazine", founded by John Lehmann, which publishes poems, short stories and literary reviews. Osborne himself wrote poetry from an early age. He has published three collections of poetry, including "Swansong" in 1968.
Between 1971 and 1986 he was literature director of the Arts Council of Great Britain. This involved dispensing government grants, and Osborne, perhaps inevitably, given the nature of the position, became embroiled in the so-called "poetry wars" that took place during the 1970s. Osborne has given an account of his tenure at the Arts Council in his autobiography.
Osborne's 1986 autobiography, "Giving it Away: Memoirs of a Uncivil Servant", sheds light on his influential role at the Arts Council, as does Peter Barry's 2006 book, "Poetry Wars: British Poetry of the 1970s and the Battle of Earl's Court".
Between 1986 and 1991, Osborne was chief drama critic for the "Daily Telegraph". He continued to write journalism on a wide variety of arts, leading to "Vogue" magazine dubbing him an "uomo universale" (universal man).
Osborne writes about opera and has published books on Verdi, Wagner, Mozart, Puccini, Richard Strauss and the bel canto operas. His book, "The Complete Operas of Verdi", was the first on that composer by someone who had actually seen all the operas staged. It was translated into Italian and published by Mursia. "The Opera Lover's Companion" appeared in 2004.
Osborne published an original novel, "Pink Danube", in 2000 and has adapted works for the stage as novels, which have been widely reprinted and translated into many languages. His novelised versions of "Black Coffee" (1998), "The Unexpected Guest" (1999) and "Spider's Web" (2000), all originally by Agatha Christie, have proved enduringly popular with readers. He has also adapted "Blithe Spirit" (2004), by Noël Coward, and Wilde's "The Importance of Being Earnest".
Osborne holds an honorary doctorate from Griffith University, Brisbane, Australia, for services to the arts and is a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. He is a former president, and now council member, of the UK Critics Circle.
In 2009, the Italian state conferred on him the honorific title of Commendatore dell'Ordine della Stella della solidarietà italiana, known as the Order of the Star of Italian Solidarity; for his outstanding contribution to the life and works of Verdi.
In 2011, The King's Head Theatre, London, staged a successful world premiere of an Oscar Wilde play, "Constance". The only play by Wilde previously unproduced, "Constance" was unearthed, translated and adapted by Osborne from the original French. Professor Joseph Bristow, a Wilde scholar based at UCLA wrote "Constance presents us with a startling Wildean drama in an arresting style. I left the King's Head Theater realizing that Wilde might have truly become the Irish Ibsen of his day."

Haller utca

Haller utca is a main street along the border of Mid-Ferencváros, in the 9th district of Budapest, Hungary. It links Nagyvárad tér in the north and Soroksári út in the west. Notable sidestreets include Tűzoltó utca, Balázs Béla utca, Gát utca, Mester utca and Vaskapu utca.
The 1.5-kilometre long "Haller utca" runs from "Nagyvárad tér" to the Danube, being flanked by the vast green expanses of Haller park and crossing" Mester utca" on its way. It is also famous for its planes and green hedges along the pavaments. The street used to be a dam to keep off floods, which is still evident in the fact that it actually descends from Nagyvárad tér and in that many sidestreets are lower. One of its sidestreets," Gát utca", indeed translates as "Dam Street". The southern side of Haller utca is occupied by municipal and office buildings including István kórház (a hospital), "Ferencvárosi Művelődési Központ "(a culture centre) the district's police station, the regional headquarters of the tax authority and the brand new Haller Gardens office block. Its northern side, by contrast, is dotted with apartment blocks of all kinds. Whereas the northern tip at "Nagyvárad tér "includes a housing estate from the 1980s, its western end at the Danube still sports some original purpose-built housing as workers' colonies from the early 20th century. The tramtracks can be found in the middle of the road; however, just a decade earlier, they used to be situated near the two pavements along a 1 kilometre stretch, a remainder of Pest's old time tram system.
Buildings of note.
The western side of Haller utca is lined with residential apartment blocks, three different small-size housing estates and a workers' colony at the Soroksári út end. The eastern/southern side is predominantly home to municipal and office buildings:
Transportation.
The street is served by tram line 24 (termini at Közvágóhíd and Keleti railways station), which has four stops on its route: Nagyvárad tér, Balázs Béla utca, Mester utca, and Soroksári út.

Roy Snelling

Roy R. Snelling (September 30, 1934, Turlock, California - April 21, 2008, on expedition in Kenya) was an internationally renowned American entomologist who studied Hymenoptera, mainly ants, wasps and bees. He was the emeritus collections manager at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County where he worked for over 30 years, joining the museum in 1963 and retiring in 1993. He dedicated his professional life to making insect biodiversity better known and appreciated.
As a foremost myrmecologist, he is credited with many important finds of rare or new ant species, such as the first "Aphaenogaster cockerelli" as "Novomessor cockerelli" colony in California, "Myrmecocystus tenuinodis" Snelling 1976 (the honeypot ant), "Neivamyrmex wilsoni" Snelling & Snelling 2007, and "Myrmecocystus wheeleri", named by Snelling after the noted myrmecologist William Morton Wheeler, who was also William Steele Creighton's academic adviser. Snelling wrote that he was much influenced by W. S. Creighton's important 1950 volume "The Ants of North America". In his career, Snelling would collaborate many times with Creighton, whose ant collection is now housed at the Los Angeles county museum.
Snelling studied at junior college in Modesto, California, but dropped out to become self-educated. Before going to the Los Angeles County museum, he spent time in the United States Army (1959) and as an inspector with the California Department of Food and Agriculture. Snelling also studied briefly at the University of Kansas but did not complete the graduate program.
Together with Charles Leonard Hogue, Snelling was a technical adviser for the Academy Award winning documentary The Hellstrom Chronicle.

Risaldar Badlu Singh, 14th Murray's Jat Lancers attached to the 29th Lancers, on 23 September 1918 at Kh. es Samariyeh, Jordan River, Palestine.
Citation: Risaldar Badlu Singh was attached to 29th Lancers when "on the morning of the 23rd September 1918, his squadron charged a strong enemy position on the west bank of the river Jordan, between the river and Kh. es Samariyeh village.
"On nearing the position, Risaldar Badlu Singh realised that the squadron was suffering casualties from a small hill on the left front occupied by machine guns and 200 infantry. Without the slightest hesitation he collected six other ranks and with the greatest dash and total disregard for danger, charged and captured the position, thereby saving very heavy casualties to the squadron. He was mortally wounded on the very top of the hill when capturing one of the machine guns single handed, but all the machine guns and infantry had surrendered to him before he died.
"His valour and initiative were of the highest order."

Krystyna Ceynowa

Krystyna Ceynowa, also spelled as "Cejnowa" (d. 1836), was an ethnic Polish victim of murder by lynching and an alleged witch in Germany. She was subjected to the ordeal of water and drowned in Ceynowa (today Chałupy) accused of sorcery. She was among the last people in Europe to be subjected to lynching on the grounds of sorcery and witch craft. 
Background.
Krystyna Ceynowa was the widow of a fisherman, living at Ceynowa on the Hel Peninsula, in the German Province of Prussia. 
She was regarded as suspicious by the community for various reasons, such as the fact that she was not a church-going person, which gave her a bad reputation in the eyes of the congregation: she never went to mass, and it was said that black crows were attracted to her chimney. People suspected that she was a witch. The authorities, however, were not willing to conduct a witch trial at this time.
The murder.
She was taken captive by a lynchmob determined to test her to see if she was a witch. Her suppressors were called from Zoppot, and she was subjected to the ordeal of water during an illegal trial. The ordeal took place in the Baltic Sea - she was transported in a boat and thrown overboard. To the disbelief of many, she remained afloat for a long time, which was taken as an evidence of witchcraft, whereas nobody thought that her gown and skirt had acted as a buoy. When Ceynowa did not drown, the people found her to be a real witch, and killed her with their paddles.
Her case exemplifies the fact that the belief in witchcraft continued among the public long after the legal authorities stopped accepting the charges of witchcraft, and that the public took the law in their own hands when they suspected witchcraft even after the courts had stopped accepting such charges.

Queer Visitors from the Marvelous Land of Oz

Queer Visitors from the Marvelous Land of Oz was a newspaper comic strip written by L. Frank Baum and illustrated by Walt McDougall, a political cartoonist for the "Philadelphia North American". "Queer Visitors" appeared in the "North American", the "Chicago Record-Herald" and other newspapers from 28 August 1904 to 26 February 1905. The series chronicles the misadventures of the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, the Woggle-Bug, Jack Pumpkinhead, and The Sawhorse, as the Gump flies them to various cities in the United States. The comic strip in turn produced its own derivation, "The Woggle-Bug Book" (1905).
Development.
The project was designed to promote "The Marvelous Land of Oz". Coincidentally, it ran at the same time as a comic strip featuring Oz characters that was written and drawn by W. W. Denslow. Denslow has drawn the illustrations for "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz" and shared in its copyright. After Baum and Denslow had a falling out, Denslow exercised his copyright through his strip, called "Denslow's Scarecrow and Tin-Man", which ran in relatively few newspapers from December 1904 to March 1905—an artistic and commercial failure.
Re-publication.
"The Visitors from Oz", published by Reilly and Lee in 1960, includes about half of Baum's Visitors stories rewritten and illustrated by Dick Martin.
The 27 "Queer Visitors" stories have been republished in book form as "The Third Book of Oz" (1989) from Buckethead Enterprises, which was censored. The Buckethead Edition was a reprint under a new cover of an earlier edition, and Dulabone was not aware at the time that it was censored. "The Third Book of Oz" also includes another early promotion project, "The Woggle-Bug Book" (written by Baum and illustrated by Ike Morgan); the volume is illustrated by Eric Shanower. Hungry Tiger Press corrected the censoring from the Buckethead edition but used "The Visitors from Oz" as the title, like the 1960 adaptation.
In June, 2009, Sunday Press Books released a collected edition of the newspaper strips in their original format and coloring. The book also included W. W. Denslow's competing strip "Denslow's Scarecrow And Tin-Man" as well as other comic strips by Walt McDougall, W. W. Denslow, and John R. Neill.

Agence nationale pour l'emploi

The "Agence Nationale pour l'Emploi", or ANPE (English: "National Employment Agency" or "National Work Agency") was a French government agency which provided counseling and aid to those who are in search of a job or of training. 
The ANPE was created in July 1967. In December 2008, the ANPE merged with the Assedic benefits agency to create a comprehensive employment agency called Pôle emploi, based on those of Germany and the UK. 
Activity.
The National Employment Agency (ANPE)'s main task was to encourage meetings between supply and demand, to help jobseekers find new jobs and help employers hire. With more than 3.7 million job entrusted by companies in 2007 and more than 3.3 million successful hiring, the ANPE was a central player in the labor market. It was open to all job seekers, whatever their situation, compensated or not. In 2007, 19 million maintenance consultants had been made. The main tasks were helping the unemployed back into work, supporting companies in their recruitment requirement, fighting against discrimination. To assist job seekers in their search, the agency offered services.
Starting on 1 January 2006, ANPE offered all job seekers monthly monitoring with a personal adviser referral until their return to employment. To facilitate recruitment, the ANPE had a partnership with 568,000 companies to promote the adequacy between supply and demand, including developing the skills of job seekers by training.
The ANPE administrations employed 28,459 people in France in 2007. The ANPE claimed 15 million visits per month on its website, anpe.fr. It had more than 1,300 settlements across France, with 22 regional units to define priority action plans in each region. The central administration gave the direction, planning implementation and assessing results.
Recent evolution.
In 1996 the registration of jobseekers was transferred to the Assedic to simplify the process.
In 1997, the official website was launched; it is now the first European website for jobs. From 2002, it has been possible for job seekers to demand jobs directly on the website. From 2003, it has published anonymous CVs profiles on the website. In 1998 the "Observatoire de l'ANPE" was created to publish studies.
In 2004 a National Plan against the recruitment difficulties was launched, and in 2005 an Emergency Plan for Employment was implemented. From 2006, a monthly personalized with a counselor referent has been implemented.
In 2008, a new public agency was created, resulting from the merging of the ANPE with the Unédic administration.

The A 92 essentially follows the lower Isar so that it passes Freising, Moosburg, Landshut, Dingolfing, Landau, Plattling and Deggendorf. Currently it is the most important connection between Munich and the East Central European countries like Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. After completion of A 94 (Munich–Passau) a part of the traffic load for eastern Europe will shift towards that Autobahn.
The 60 km stretch of the A 92 between Landshut and Plattling has a very low traffic density. This is also the reason that the A 92 is used in part as a test stretch by the BMW factory in Dingolfing. One notes that among other things the road surface is better in the vicinity of Dingolfing.
History.
The first conception of building of an Autobahn along the Isar was at the end of the 1960s. It started with the extension of Bundesstraße 11, and with the building of a bypass for Wallersdorf. Until 1970, a small piece of 5 km length of the autobahn was completed already around Wallersdorf, it was named "5-Minuten-Autobahn".
The last section between Dingolfing and Wallersdorf, 21 kilometers long, was completed in 1988.
Originally it was planned to extend the A 92 over its present end in Munich out to the Landshuter Allee, where it would have had a connection to the second Munich ring road A 999. This plan has not been executed.
Rest Areas.
At the A 92 there are no filling stations or rest areas in the conventional sense (with an own exit). Therefore smaller gasoline station booths developed to rest areas at many of the exits.

Lourdes effect

The term Lourdes effect has been coined by the Belgian philosopher and skeptic Etienne Vermeersch to account for the conjecture that some supernatural powers seem to have a sort of resistance to manifesting themselves in a completely unambiguous fashion. According to Vermeersch, should the miraculous power of Lourdes actually exist there would be no reason to think that it would be more difficult for the Virgin Mary or God to reattach a severed arm than to cure paralysis or blindness. According to Vermeersch, the visions and photos of, for instance, the Loch Ness Monster and the Yeti lack reliability and clarity due to a similar effect.
Vermeersch uses this term to mock what he calls the selective and uncritical approach to miracles, or the frivolous attribution of supernatural gifts to human beings. Skeptics note that the number of fatal accidents that occur on the way to and from Lourdes may well be considerably higher than the 67 alleged miracles due to faith healing recognized in 2005 by the Vatican.

Symphony No. 3 (Glazunov)

Alexander Glazunov composed his Symphony No. 3 in D major, Op. 33, in 1890, and it was published by 1892 by the Leipzig firm owned by Mitrofan Belyayev. The symphony is dedicated to Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and was first performed in St. Petersburg in December 1890 under the baton of Anatoly Lyadov. The symphony is considered a transitional work, with Glazunov largely eschewing the influences of Balakirev, Borodin, and Rimsky-Korsakov inherent in his earlier symphonies for the newer influences of Tchaikovsky and Wagner. Because of this change, the Third has been called the "anti-kuchkist" symphony in Glazunoiv's output ("kuchkist" from "kuchka", the shortened Russian name for the nationalist music group The Five). He would tone down these new influences in his subsequent symphonies as he strove for an eclectic mature style. The Third also shows a greater depth of expression, most evident in the chromatic turns of its third movement, reminiscent of Wagner's opera "Tristan und Isolde".

Structure.
Four movements make up the work:
Overview.
Although the earliest sketches of this work date to 1883, the symphony was an example of Glazunov's effort to break away in a larger form from the nationalist style that animated the compositions of The Mighty Handful (then the most important musical influence in Russia) to reflect what Glazunov felt to be universal forms, moods and themes. He had already explored this desire in smaller works such as the "Poem lyrique" for orchestra (1881-7), a piece much admired by Tchaikovsky, as well as in the elegy "To the Memory of a Hero" ("Pamyati geroya") (1881-5). The Symphony No. 3, however, was Glazunov's largest orchestral work to aspire to an artistic mould beyond that espoused by the Five. Tchaikovsky's influence is clear, especially in the work's lyrical episodes.
In 1924, when Glazunov shared his reminiscences of Tchaikovsky, he said, "He also knew my "Third Symphony", which is dedicated to him. Much in it found his approval and, at his request, I often played the scherzo of the symphony to him on the piano. When I asked him what he would regard as the most significant weakness in my works, he said: 'Some longevities and the lack of pauses.' Later, when Pyotr Ilyich had long departed this world, I always remembered his words, and in my subsequent production I always took pains to pay heed to them."

Michael Farthing

Professor Michael J. G. Farthing (born 1948) a British physician, medical researcher and academic administrator. He is the Vice Chancellor of the University of Sussex, having succeeded Professor Alasdair Smith in September 2007. Prior to his appointment as Vice Chancellor at Sussex, his academic career was in Medicine, specialising in Gynaecology.
Vice-chancellor.
Since becoming Vice-Chancellor at Sussex, Michael Farthing has led the creation of a new strategic plan for the University - "Making the future", which sets out a controversial growth agenda for Sussex, planning to grow its research income, double international student numbers and increase engagement with the business community. The plan also puts significant investment into the campus itself, with new academic buildings and residences on campus to support academic growth and to respond to student demand.
In July 2012 Michael Farthing demonstrated his medical expertise gained and closed the university’s Centre for Community Engagement (CCE), leading to a number of redundancies. CCE had played an important role offering lifelong learning and part-time degrees and short courses for those in employment and otherwise unable to attend university.
The term "Making the future" draws from a phrase used by the first Vice-Chancellor, Lord Fulton, which said that higher education at Sussex was concerned with making the future.
Michael Farthing has also led a move to greater international activity by the University, personally leading the creation of partnerships with institutions in China. This internationalisation has led to the appointment of a member of the executive specifically to lead this area of University work for the future.
Under his leadership, the University has also been restructured to create 13 schools of studies (beginning in August 2009), including the Brighton and Sussex Medical School, dramatically altering the scope for interdisciplinary communication and collaboration for which Sussex has been known. These new schools are headed by leading academics appointed from within the University and from institutions elsewhere.
A regular column in the University's Bulletin sets out his vision for the development of the University. He also holds termly meetings with staff, podcasts of which are available.
Since taking office, Farthing has effectively disbanded the renowned Linguistics Department — a move condemned by Noam Chomsky as "a serious blow to the intellectual life of the university" — and cut funding to many others. Whilst he is credited for having improved the University's finances, his large-scale culling of academic and other staff initiated in November 2009 has been unpopular, and has provoked strike action by the UCU lecturers union and widespread civil disobedience by students on the campus. In addition to the wide criticism by faculty and students alike of Farthing's proposals, there have also been a number of protests and occupations taking place at the University.
Controversy over protest.
In early 2013, the level of student protest at Sussex over privatisation resulted in Farthing publicly considering the defunding or underfunding of the Student Union and in December Farthing took action to suspend five students associated with recent occupations of administration buildings and restrict them from returning to campus. This action required a court order as it was not already within the authority of the Vice-Chancellor's office. A motion to retract the suspensions was raised in the House of Commons but was ultimately tabled.
Academic career in medicine.
Prior to his appointment as Vice Chancellor at Sussex, Professor Farthing's academic career was in medicine. He graduated from University College, London (UCL) and the University College Hospital Medical School in 1972 and held posts in Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, and St Bartholomew's Hospital ("Barts"), London, specialising in Gastroenterology.
In the early 1980s, Farthing was a Wellcome Tropical Lecturer and held overseas posts as visiting lecturer and Assistant Professor in India, Boston and Costa Rica, before returning to Barts.
In 1995 he was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at Barts and The London NHS Trust. In 2000 he moved to Glasgow before arriving at St George's in 2003.
He has been Honorary Consultant in Gastroenterology to the British Army since 1991, and is a member of the Editorial Boards of a number of national and international Gastroenterology journals. He was President of the British Society of Gastroenterology for 2007-08.
As a member of the Education Committee of the General Medical Council, Farthing played a part in curriculum planning for the new Medical School established jointly by the Universities of Hull and York, opened at the same time as the similar establishment created by Sussex along with the University of Brighton.
He served as chair of the Committee on Publication Ethics (Cope).
His last post before moving to Sussex was as principal of St George's medical school, University of London. He is the 2009-10 Chair of the Health and Social Care Policy Committee of Universities UK.

Fanny de Beauharnais, née Marie-Anne-Françoise Mouchard, (4 October 1737, Paris – 2 July 1813) was a French lady of letters and salon-holder. She was the mother of French politician Claude de Beauharnais. She was the grandmother of Stéphanie de Beauharnais, Grand Duchess of Baden, and through her she is the ancestor of former royal families of Romania and Yugoslavia, and the present royal families of Belgium, of Luxembourg and of Monaco.

She was godmother to Hortense de Beauharnais, Alexandre's daughter by Marie Josèphe Rose de Tascher de la Pagerie, better known to history as Josephine.
She wrote poetry from her childhood onwards and, after separating from her husband, devoted herself to literature, become friends with literary figures such as Claude Joseph Dorat and Michel de Cubières-Palmézeaux. Her salon became a choice social venue, and she became a member of the Académie des Arcades. 
In 1787 she wrote and put on a five act prose comedy entitled "la Fausse inconstance", though it was not a success. In 1790 she was received into the Académie de Lyon.
Her detractors attributed her work to Dorat and other friends of hers. The marquise de Créquy, in his "Souvenirs", adjudged that Lebrun had very rudely and unjustly applied to her an old epigram of Pavillon about Charlotte-Rose de Caumont La Force:

<doc id="18247921" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18247921" title="Georges Palante">
Georges Palante

Georges Toussaint Léon Palante (November 20, 1862 – August 5, 1925) was a French philosopher and sociologist.
He advocated aristocratic individualist ideas similar to Nietzsche and Schopenhauer. He was opposed to Émile Durkheim's holism, promoting methodological individualism instead.
Life.
Palante was born in Saint-Laurent-Blangy in the Pas-de-Calais, 20 November 1862. His father, Emile Palante, was an accountant from Liège. Palante's older brother, Emile, died when he was only five years old. He studied successively at the college of Arras, where he excelled in Latin, then at Lycée Louis-le-Grand where he earned his bachelor's degree. 
He obtained a Bachelor of Arts at the University of Douai. In 1885, he began his career as professor of philosophy at Aurillac, where he met his future wife, Louise Genty, whom he married three years later. The couple had a daughter, Germaine, in 1890. Between 1886 and 1888, he studied in Châteauroux. In 1888 he received his Agrégation in philosophy. 
He separated from his first wife in 1890 and was appointed to teach at the Lycée de Saint-Brieuc, Brittany, then in the following years at Valenciennes, La Rochelle and Niort. In 1893, he translated a work by Theobald Ziegler and began to publish articles. He returned in 1898 to the Lycée de Saint-Brieuc, at which he worked for the remainder of his teaching career. Meanwhile, he continued to work on his philosophical ideas, publishing articles and essays in journals. He published collections of his articles in various books, notably "Combat pour l'individu" (Fight for the Individual) (1904) and "La Sensibilité individualiste" (The Individualist Sensibility) (1909) 
In 1907, he completed a draft doctoral thesis at the Sorbonne, but it was never authorized. However, he published the draft under the title "Antinomies entre l'individu et la société" (Antinomies between the individual and society) in 1912, expanding it two years later under the title "Pessimisme et individualisme" (Pessimism and Individualism). 
In 1908, he stood in municipal elections as a socialist candidate but was not elected. He took over from Jules de Gaultier at the philosophy journal "Mercure de France", holding the position for 13 years. In 1916, he befriended the writer Louis Guilloux. 
During this period he lived a bohemian lifestyle, drinking heavily and, notoriously, marking his students' essays in a local brothel. He married his second wife, Louise Pierre, in 1923 and retired from teaching a year later. 
On 5 August 1925 he died from a self-inflicted bullet wound to the head. The reasons for Palante's suicide are not certain, but he is known to have been suffering from acromegaly, a condition diagnosed when he was a student. A severe degenerative disease, which had no cure at time, it was making his life more and more painful.
Philosophy.
A thoroughgoing Individualist, he admired Nietzsche and showed early interest in the work of Freud.« Freud a raison de reconnaître l'importance énorme de la sexualité dans l'évolution psychologique de l'individu », cited by Yannick Pelletier, préface de "L'individu en détresse".</ref> His thinking is also critical towards the mass "herd instinct", which he thought oppresses and prevents individuals from developing fully. He did not, however, oppose social networks, and insisted that his philosophy did not seek to destroy society for the benefit of the individual, but to help to build new networks of social interaction. In sociology, he objected to the holistic model espoused by Emile Durkheim.
Political ideology.
Initially close to Socialist theories, although critical of Marxist state socialism, he increasingly rejected it as a political ideal, though he did participate in 1908 municipal elections as a Socialist candidate. He rejected the label "anarchist", but his ideas are nevertheless often regarded as a form of anarchism or at least as libertarianism. His ideas have some commonality with classical liberalism, including his definition of the individual and his opposition to various barriers to trade. However, he opposed it in so far as, in his view, individual "being" is not determined by rational choice, since social determinism is constantly at work. In the economic field, he also objected to capitalists seeking profits to the detriment of the poor, and called for a "politics of the belly."
Influence.
Louis Guilloux wrote "Souvenirs sur Georges Palante" ("Memories of Georges Palante") and took his inspiration from Palante to model his character Cripure (short for "Critique de la raison pure"; in English, "Critique of pure reason") in his novel "Le Sang noir" ("Dark Blood"). He also puts Palante's ideas into the mouths of characters in other novels.
He is quoted in one of the footnotes to Camus' classic treatise" The Rebel". Jean Grenier who was Camus' philosophy teacher, met Palante and devoted a full chapter to him in his book "Les Grèves" ("The Strikes").
Michel Onfray's thesis and first published book, "Physiologie de Georges Palante" ("Georges Palante's Physiology") contributed to the renewed interest in his work. The 2002 and 2005 reissues of the book were subtitled "portrait d’un nietzschéen de gauche" ("Portrait of a left-wing nietzschean").

Nicola Bellomo

Nicola Bellomo (Bari, Apulia, Italy, February 2, 1881 – Island of Nisida, Naples, Italy September 11, 1945) was a general in the Italian Army during World War II. He was tried for war crimes at a courts-martial for the murder of a British prisoner of war. He was found guilty. He was one of the few Italian commissioned officers prosecuted for war crimes during World War II, and the only one to be executed by a British-controlled court.
Career.
Military service.
Bellomo was a career officer in the Italian Army from the regular class of the Italian Military Academy of Modena. At the outbreak of World War I, he held the rank of Artillery Captain and during that war he was awarded the Italian Military Order for gallantry in action. He gave up active duty in 1936, but was reactivated in 1941, when he was assigned as commander of the XII MVSN Zone, and Bari province.
Shooting of prisoners.
On November 30, 1941, two British prisoners of war, Captain George Playne of the Royal Armoured Corps and Lieutenant Roy Cooke escaped from Torre Tresca POW detention camp but were recaptured a few hours later. According to the results of the Italian Army investigation board, Bellomo was already waiting for them when they arrived back at the camp. He wanted to personally investigate the course of events leading to their escape, and asked the two British officers to show him the location from which they had launched their plan. Again, the two British prisoners took their chances to escape, although this time Italian sentries opened fire, killing Captain Playne and wounding Lieutenant Cooke. The investigation into the incident revealed no misconduct on Bellomo's part.
1943 armistice.
On September 9, 1943, a day after the Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces, Bellomo formed a makeshift Italian force to counterattack German forces that tried to occupy the port of Bari. Bellomo was wounded, but the action was successful; the Italians forced the Germans to retreat, leaving the port facilities intact. This allowed the safe and undisturbed landing of British troops on September 22, 1943 under Italian Army protection. A British force quickly moved north to Foggia, which they took on September 27. By the end of the month, the entire Apulia region and most of southern Italy had been secured by Allied forces. Winston Churchill said, "September was a handful month for allied armies." In the meantime, Bellomo kept his position as commander of the XII MVSN Zone in Bari.
Shortly afterward, he was detained and arrested by the British military authority and charged with murder and attempted murder for his actions in shooting the two British POWs.
War crimes trial.
On January 28, 1944 Bellomo was placed under arrest by the British Military Police and charged with "shooting or ordering to shoot two British officers, causing the death of one of them and the wounding of the other one." Lieutenant Cooke, the surviving prisoner, filed a report against Bellomo on June 5, 1945. In the following weeks, Bellomo was moved around several Allied POW camps, namely in Grumo Appula, Padula and Afragola. On July 14, 1945, Bellomo received formal communication of his trial. The court martial took place on July 28, 1945 and within an hour, he was sentenced to death. Bellomo was executed by a firing squad on the Island of Nisida north of Naples on September 11, 1945. At that time, the island was occupied by the British Army and used as a prison facility.
Italian award.
In 1951, the new Italian Government posthumously awarded Bellomo the Italian Silver Medal for his role in the defense of the seaport of Bari.

Ling Jihua

Ling Jihua (; born October 1956) is a politician of the People's Republic of China. He serves as a secretary of the Central Secretariat of the Communist Party of China, and the head of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee. He was reportedly former party general secretary Hu Jintao's "most trusted and notorious political fixer".
Career.
Ling was born Linghu Jihua (令狐计划) to a CPC official's family in Pinglu County, Shanxi Province. He and all his three brothers received names related to the Communist Party's policies. His own name, "Jihua", means "planning". In December 1973, as many other young Chinese, he was sent to work in the countryside, and used to serve in a printing factory. In June 1975, Ling was admitted into the Communist Youth League committee in Pinglu County, and was soon elevated to vice secretary of the committee. He joined the Communist Party of China in June 1976. In December 1978, Ling was transferred to CPC Yuncheng committee in Shanxi. In 1979, Communist Youth League elected young cadres nationwide, and Ling, at the age of 23, was elevated to the propaganda department of CYL Central Committee. He obtained an "on-job master's degree" in commercial management at Hunan University.
From August 1983, Ling studied at China Youth Political Academy, affiliated to CYL, majoring in political education. In July 1985, Ling was promoted to the deputy chief of theory section of propaganda department of CYL. At that time, Hu Jintao was the head of CYL. From June 1988, Ling served in various posts in CYL, including office chief of central secretariat, vice chief of general office of CYL Central Committee, editor-in-chief of "Chinese Communist Youth League", and the chief of propaganda department of CYL.
In December 1995, after serving in CYL for over ten years, Ling was transferred to general office of CPC Central Committee, and became the head of 3rd group of research office. In June 1998, he was promoted to head of research office, under the general office. In December 1999, Ling was appointed as vice chief of general office of CPC. Later, he also served as vice minister of general office of the State Commission for Public Sector Reform of the State Council, and chief of Hu Jintao's office.
From September 19, 2007 to August 31, 2012 Ling served as the chief of General Office of CPC Central Committee, when he was demoted to the United Front Work Department. Ling was succeeded by Li Zhanshu.
Ling was an alternate member of 16th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and a full member of 17th Central Committee of CPC.
Family.
Ling is married to Gu Liping, Director General of Youth Business China a non-profit program that aims to promote youth entrepreneurship that is headquartered in Beijing. In 2010 she was deputy director of the Ying public interest foundation, a charity sponsored by the Communist Youth League. In that role she reportedly solicited money for the foundation.
Ling Jihua had a son Ling Gu, who died in March 2012 at the age of 23. Ling Gu was involved in a car crash while driving a black Ferrari 458 Spider accompanied by two women (reportedly of minority ethnicity) who survived. Gu was found naked, as was one of the women, while the other was semi-naked. These circumstances have led to speculation that Gu was involved in a sex game, while they were driving.
News of the crash was reported in mainland Chinese media shortly after it happened, but the story was then rapidly suppressed. Reportedly, Ling Jihua, after viewing the body of the driver at the morgue, denied it was his son. It was not until September 2012 that the driver's identity was revealed by a Hong Kong newspaper. In China, Internet search terms such as "Ferrari", "Little Ling" and "Prince Ling" were blocked.
Many commentators have questioned how Ling Gu could afford a car worth £500,000 when his parents have government jobs. The crash is thought to be connected with Ling Jihua's demotion in August 2012, and Gu Liping's removal from her job in January 2013.

2KY

2KY is a commercial radio station based in Sydney, broadcasting throughout New South Wales and Canberra on a network of over 140 narrowcast transmitters as well as the main 1017 AM frequency in Sydney. 2KY broadcasts live commentary of thoroughbred, harness and greyhound racing. Over 1500 races are covered each week, including the pre and post race form and TAB betting information.
History.
2KY was founded by Emil Voigt under the ownership of the Labor Council of New South Wales with the aim of broadcasting 'musical entertainment, news, weather, market reports, public debates and matters of educational value'. Night broadcasts of trotting began in 1949 with greyhound racing following soon after. In the 1960s the station took over thoroughbred racing commentary from 2GB. By the mid-1970s Saturday afternoon racing broadcasts had started.
Current.
In 1992 the station started establishing a statewide network of narrowcast relay transmitters. 2KY was one of the pioneering stations of Digital Audio Broadcasting in Australia. In 2001 the station was acquired by Sky Channel Pty Ltd.
More recentlym Sky Channel Pty Ltd and 2KY were acquired by the NSW TAB, which in turn was acquired by Tabcorp. 2KY, and Tabcorp's other broadcast network Sport 927 (Victoria) jointly present the National Racing Network, originating from the Sport 927 Melbourne (Carlton) studios.
Programming.
The National Racing Service on 2KY features every TAB meeting throughout Australia, as well as coverage of race meetings in New Zealand and Hong Kong and to a lesser extent the USA and UK.

A. V. Baliga

A. V. Baliga FRCS (1904–1964) was a physician, an educationist and a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons.
Several institutes in India are named after him.
Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru the first Prime Minister of India said about Baliga:
""...He was not only a Brilliant Surgeon but also a good man devoted to good causes, for which he subscribed liberally...His sudden death has deprived India of an outstanding surgeon, a man and a patriot of great merit and accomplishment...""
Early childhood and education.
Baliga was born on April 26, 1904 in Kallianpur. His early education was in the Hindu Higher elementary school in Kallianpur. Since there was no high school in Kallianpur, he joined the Christian High School in Udupi. In 1920, Mahatma Gandhi gave a call to students to leave educational institutions run by the British Raj. Baliga left school, but was not readmitted. He joined the National School in Udupi which was affiliated to the Gujarat Vidyapith, a Nationalist institute. Baliga passed his matriculation from there. Since the matriculation was not recognized by the British authorities, he could not be admitted to the M.B.B.S course. He was forced to join the L.C.P.S course at the National Medical College, Bombay. Baliga also had to finance his education by giving private lessons. He finished his L.C.P.S course by standing first in the examinations; he caught the attention of G. V. Deshmukh of KEM Hospital who appointed him house surgeon and physician.
His career.
Baliga went to the U.K. on a fellowship. He had to pass the London matriculation for his LRCP, MRCS and finally FRCS. He returned to India in 1933 and was appointed as an assistant honorary surgeon at the KEM Hospital, Bombay; he also started his private practice. From then on until 1964, he rapidly rose in stature as a surgeon both nationally and internationally.
Philanthropy.
Baliga was instrumental in establishing the Kanara College of Arts and Sciences in Kumta (renamed as Dr. A. V. Baliga college, Kumta. He also helped establish the M. G. M. College in Udupi, the Kasturba Medical College, Manipal and the Orthopedic children’s hospital in Haji Ali, Bombay. He was a founding member of the Association of Surgeons of India and took part in the discussions at the annual conference of the association.
As an International Figure.
After independence, he was involved in the Goa liberation movement. He was also the chief architect of India's political relations with the former Soviet Union. After the 1962 debacle, he also went on an unofficial diplomatic mission to China.
Being a true democrat, he always dreamt of a free, frank and fearless press. This dream became a reality with the publishing of the “PATRIOT”, a daily, and “LINK”, a magazine through which he could express independent social and political views.

Vincelestes

Vincelestes ("Vince’s thief") is an extinct genus of actively mobile mammal, that lived in what would be South America during the Early Cretaceous from 130—112 mya, existing for approximately .
"Vincelestes neuquenianus" is the only species known to date. Specimens were found at La Amarga Formation of southern Neuquén Province, Argentina. Only nine individuals were recovered from this site. 
The back teeth of "Vincelestes" were similar to those of therians in that they were capable of cutting and grinding. This enabled them to process food more efficiently. Although not the direct ancestor of therians, "Vincelestes" is important because it gives us an idea of what the ancestor of both placental and marsupial mammals might have looked like, and also gives an indication of when these mammals may have originated.

Pultusk (meteorite)

Pultusk is an H5 ordinary chondrite meteorite which fell on 30 January 1868 in Poland. The event has been known as the stony meteorite shower with the largest number of pieces yet recorded in history. Made up of rocky debris, it consists of pyroxene or olivine chondrules deployed in mass plagioclase, there being also kamacite.
History.
The fall occurred on January 30, 1868 at 7:00 pm near the town of Pułtusk, about northeast of Warsaw. Thousands of people witnessed a large fireball followed by detonations and a very large shower of small fragments falling on ice, land and houses within an area of about 127 sq km. The estimated number of fragments was 68780. 
The fragments ranged in weight from half a gram to (the largest specimen). The overall estimated mass of the meteorites was . The vast majority of the fragments were small (few grams), known as "Pultusk Peas". The Pultusk meteorite is the largest stony meteorite shower ever recorded.
Composition and classification.
Pultusk is brecciated and contains two varieties of xenoliths embedded in a dark brecciated matrix. It is a veined and brecciated chondrite with abundant xenoliths with various degrees of recrystallisation. Petrologic type 5 xenoliths prevail, so it has been classified as H5: an ordinary chondrite significantly thermally metamorphosed and with the contours of the chondrules frequently difficult to distinguish. The main minerals are olivine and bronzite. Kamacite, troilite and chromite are also present.
Chemical composition.
The chemical elements and the respective quantity found in the Pultusk meteorite have been described as SiO2 36.44 wt%, TiO2 0.18 wt%, Al2O3 1.88 wt%, Cr2O3 0.37 wt%, FeO 9.48 wt%, MnO 0.25 wt%, MgO 23.75 wt%, CaO 1.82 wt%, Na2O 0.83 wt%, K2O 0.09 wt%, P2O5 0.22 wt%, Fe 16.02 wt%, Ni 1.61 wt%, FeS 5.97 wt%, Fe (metallic) 17.62 wt%, Ni (metallic) 9.13 wt%, Fe as iron sulfide 3.80 wt%, S as iron sulfide 2.17 wt%, total content of iron 27.19 wt%.

Spore (2008 video game)

Spore is a 2008 multi-genre single-player god game developed by Maxis and designed by Will Wright. The game was released for the Microsoft Windows and Macintosh operating systems in September 2008 as Spore. A special edition of the game, "Spore: Galactic Edition", additionally includes a "Making of Spore" DVD video, "How to Build a Better Being" DVD video by National Geographic Channel, "The Art of Spore" hardback mini-book, a fold-out "Spore" poster and a 100-page Galactic Handbook published by Prima Games.
As part of its license, Electronic Arts released Spore Origins, an arcade-style game for mobile devices, and Spore Creatures, a light RPG for the Nintendo DS, , an expansion pack for the PC game, Spore Hero and Spore Hero Arena for Wii and Nintendo DS respectively, is in the fall 2009 lineup, and "Spore" Creature Keeper were announced as part of the 2009 lineup. 
Covering many genres including action, real-time strategy, and role-playing games (RPG), "Spore" allows a player to control the development of a species from its beginnings as a microscopic organism, through development as an intelligent and social creature, to interstellar exploration as a spacefaring culture. It has drawn wide attention for its massive scope, and its use of open-ended gameplay and procedural generation. Throughout each stage, players are able to use various creators to produce content for their games. These can then be uploaded to the online Sporepedia and downloaded by other players.
"Spore" was released after several delays to generally favourable reviews. Praise was given for the fact that the game allowed players to create practically any creature, vehicle and building. However, "Spore" was criticised for its gameplay which was seen as shallow by many reviewers; GameSpot remarked: "Individual gameplay elements are extremely simple." Controversy surrounded "Spore" for SecuROM, its DRM software, which can potentially open the user's computer to security risks.
Gameplay.
"Spore" allows the player to develop a species from a microscopic organism to its evolution into a complex animal, its emergence as a social, intelligent being, to its mastery of the planet and then finally to its ascension into space, where it interacts with alien species across the galaxy. Throughout the game, the player's perspective and species change dramatically.
The game is broken up into distinct yet consistent, dependent "stages". The outcome of one phase affects the initial conditions and leveling facing the player in the next. Each phase exhibits its own style of play, and has been described by the developers as ten times more complicated than its preceding phase. While players are able to spend as much time as they would want in each, it is possible to accelerate or skip phases altogether. Some phases feature optional missions; when the player completes a mission, they are granted a bonus, such as a new ability or money. If all of a player's creations are completely destroyed at some point, the species will be respawned at its nearest colony or at the beginning of the phase.
Unlike many other Maxis games, "Spore" has a primary win condition, which is obtained by reaching a supermassive black hole placed at the center of the galaxy and receiving a "Staff of Life". Another major achievement involves defeating or befriending the Grox, a cyborg species with a large empire guarding the core. However, the player may continue to play after any goal has been achieved.
There is a difficulty selector to each stage, allowing players to choose the difficulty for each part of the game. "Spore" defaults to the easiest level. The first four phases of the game, if the player uses the editors only minimally, will take up to 15 hours to complete, but can take as little as one or two hours. Note that there is no time limit for any stage: the player may stay in a single stage as long as s/he wishes, and progress to the next stage when ready. At the end of each phase, the player's actions cause their creature to be assigned a characteristic. Each phase has three characteristics, usually based on how aggressively or peacefully the phase was played. Characteristics determine how the creature will start the next phase and give it abilities that can be used later in the game.
Stages.
"Spore" is a game that is separated into stages, each stage presenting a different type of experience with different goals to obtain. The five stages are the Cell stage, the Creature stage, the Tribal stage, the Civilization stage, and the Space stage. In order to advance to the next stage of the game, players must complete the objective for each stage. Once completed, the player has the option to advance to the next stage, or to continue playing.
Cell stage.
The cell stage (sometimes referred to as the tide pool, cellular, or microbial stage) is the very first stage in the game, and begins with a cinematic explanation for how the protagonist's cell got onto the planet through the scientific concept of panspermia, with a meteor crashing into the ocean of a planet and breaking apart, revealing a single-celled organism. The player guides this simple microbe around in a 3D environment on a single 2D plane, reminiscent of flOw, where it must deal with fluid dynamics and predators, while eating meat chunks (from dead weaker microbes) or plants. The player may choose whether the creature is a herbivore or a carnivore prior to starting the stage. Once the microbe has found a part, the player can call a mate to enter the editor, in which they can modify the shape and abilities of the microbe by spending "DNA points" earned throughout eating organisms in the stage. A player may choose to remove a part, which will refund the full price of DNA, or add more parts, despite the quantity he already has of them. The player may scale the parts of his cell, including the spinal cord, eyes, and mouth to personalize the look. The paint editor, accessible from the parts editor, also gives a variety of patterns and colors for a nice look.
As the game progresses it becomes possible to make creatures omnivorous as compared to just herbivorous or carnivorous, allowing them to eat both plant matter and smaller living cells by earning the proboscis mouth or by using both the herbivorous and carnivorous mouths together. The balance of what type of food is eaten (plant matter vs. meat bits) determines whether the creature will be a herbivore, omnivore, or carnivore for the following stages. Despite the given mouth, the food the player has eaten directly affects the types of mouths available for him in the creature stage. Parts are acquired by seeking out special "part tokens" from meteor fragments and other organisms, which provide new parts to use in the editor, including spikes, mouths or better propulsion mechanisms. If the creature dies, the player restarts from wherever the creature last spawned.
The stage consists of five phases; every half-phase, the creature expands. As the microbe grows, objects that are in the background draw to the foreground, making enormous microbes that formerly lay harmless in the background a possible threat while simultaneously making smaller microbes too minuscule to notice for the player. Most creatures play a major role, and usually represent a threat. Even harmless herbivores can provide a challenge by stealing food if the player is also a herbivore. Carnivorous creatures will continually try to eat the player, or compete for food. If the player can eat flesh, then they can kill and consume other cells their size or, with smaller organisms, they can be swallowed up instantly. Larger, carnivorous cells will occasionally chase the player's cell and can be very dangerous. These larger cells can be killed, but only if the player's cell has weapon parts. They are difficult to kill with such a large amount of health, but If they do die, they still cannot be eaten, because a smaller cell's mouth can't penetrate their skin. Killing cells at around the player's creature size and larger will earn them new parts, if the killed cell has them, but will not earn any new abilities from smaller, easier to kill cells.
The cell's eating habits in the Cell Stage directly influence its diet in the Creature Stage, and only mouths appropriate to the diet (Herbivore, Carnivore, or Omnivore) established in the Cell stage will become available in the Creature Stage (however, diet restrictions can be overcome by swapping the cell's mouthpiece before entering the Creature phase, regardless of what diet is assigned to the creature). The ocean floor becomes more prominent as the player progresses, and once the player decides to progress to the next stage, the creature editor appears, prompting the user to add legs before the shift to land. The first creature editor is very limited, with only the unlocked cell parts (with new functions) and legs to be had, yet the color styles become more complex than before. When out of the water a cutscene will appear in which the player's creature will call nestmates to join it on land and then move to a nest where the creature stage will start.
Originally another stage, known as the "Aquatic Stage" involving sea life was after the cell stage but was edited out due to disk space and poor playability with three dimensions.
Creature stage.
At the beginning of the second stage in the game called the creature stage, the player creates his/her own land creature. At the very beginning it is similar to the cell stage as it uses the same parts, but one now has legs and arms (which are not necessary but greatly benefit the player). Also the shape of the creature becomes a 3D format instead of the cell stage's 2D format. The biosphere contains a variety of animal species, which carnivorous and omnivorous player creatures can hunt for food. There is also a range of plants, some of which bear fruit, a reliable food source for herbivores and omnivores. Environmental phenomena, as well as the creature's vital health and hunger meters, are always a concern and sometimes a challenge. One of the main problems is hunger. The player must always be wary of the food bar, which must be replenished every few minutes. Attempting to cross an ocean will lead to the player's death if he ventures into water that is too deep; a giant fish-like creature will leap up and eat the player.
In the creature stage the player has a home nest where the members of his own species are located. The nest is where one respawns after dying or mating. The nest is the 'base of operations' for the creature and one should stay near the base for healing and mating. There are many other species in their nests that can be found across the virtually infinite playing map. While interacting with them, the player can choose to be friendly (or as the game refers to it: "social") or to be aggressive. Most creatures work together in their nests and live with each other, just like the player's species. In their nests, a wide variety of things may be found besides the standard creature. There are Alpha creatures, which have higher health and stats, and babies, which have lower health and stats. There are also eggs, which may be destroyed for experience points, but will hatch eventually. Occasionally, instead of creatures there will be pulsating cocoons that will hatch into creatures after a while. How the player interacts with the nest will affect how they think of him. For instance, if the player decides to befriend the creatures, they will act friendly toward him and become allies to help him by following him around, but if player attacks and kills some of them, the nest will either get angry and frequently try to attack the player or develop a fear of the player and run away if the player gets close enough to interact or spends enough time near them.
The player can then decide whether to use social skills to befriend, or combat skills to hunt, these other species; these decisions will affect the abilities of the player's species in the subsequent stages of the game. Successful socialization and hunting attempts will gain varying amounts of DNA Points, the continued 'currency' of this stage. DNA points may be spent on many new body parts, which influence how the creature will perform when attacking other creatures or socializing with them . New body parts may be obtained and equipped by examining bone piles or fragmentary skeletons scattered throughout the landscape. Also, when a player defeats or befriends an "alpha" creature, he is given a part, albeit a part that doesn't always have better stats than previously acquired parts.
Interacting with other species progresses in the stage and also gives the player's creature the ability to form a pack, or posse, eventually containing up to three creatures. Any befriended creature may be added to an empty pack slot by making a successful socialization attempt after the species is your ally. Pack members will travel, socialize and fight alongside the player's creature, increasing the odds of befriending other creatures and of surviving combat. Pack members may heal at the home nest, or at the nests of allied or extinct species. This entire process can be done with the player's own species as the player can add his own creatures to the pack instead of trying to befriend other creatures as allies; this is excellent if the player wishes to focus only on either socializing or hunting other races.
Rogue creatures are solitary members of other species. They can be neutral or predominantly angry towards the player's creature, which is usually the result of the Rogue creature's feeding habits. Their most significant difference from normal creatures is that they require massively larger amounts of health than other creatures, making them harder to kill. They can be befriended, and are valuable pack members because of their excellent statistics. However, befriending them can be a difficult task. Either method will, however, lead to a large bonus of DNA.
Epic creatures are enormous creatures which appear randomly throughout the phase. They are always hostile, and cannot be befriended . They have 1000 health, and rarely 500 in which they are called "half-epics", and can kill most creatures with a single strike. Epics also have the ability to pick up other creatures and throw them over long distances, which usually results in death. As a result, epic creatures are almost impossible to kill during this stage and are often best avoided; during later stages they present a less serious threat. Killing one in this stage grants the 'epic killer' achievement.
As the player's creature befriends or hunts more of the other creatures, its intelligence increases. Eventually it will be ready for the subsequent Tribal stage; in these, only cultural evolution is possible and the Creature Editor is no longer available.
To add new parts, the player's creature can mate with another member of his nest. Then, the creature creator pops up (similar to the one on entry to the creature stage when coming from the cell stage), and the player can add new parts to his creature, and take off old ones, earning a full refund on the DNA points used to purchase these parts. He can also mold the shape of his creature and color it differently using three coats of paint and texture, so that the new creature can look wholly different from the previous version. More expensive parts will upgrade the player's abilities for their method of interaction. After the player is finished editing, a newly evolved generation of creatures will appear with the new parts and form.
Occasionally, a random meteor shower may occur, in which relatively small meteors will shower over the landscape. These meteors can harm the player's creature and other creatures. Another random event is spaceships appearing in the sky, which can move about freely and will randomly abduct creatures using an abduction beam. However, the player's creature cannot be abducted.
Tribal stage.
After the brain of the player's species evolves sufficiently, the species may enter the tribal stage. Physical development ceases, as does the player's exclusive control over an individual creature, as the game focuses on the birth of division of labor for the species. The player is given a hut, a group of fully evolved creatures, as well as two of six possible Consequence Abilities, unlocked depending on the species' behavior in the previous phases. This is only possible if the player played the previous stages; if the player started directly from the "Galaxy Screen", they are locked.
This stage begins with a humorous cutscene parodying "", depicting the player's creature attempting to make fire using a stick tool, throwing it into the air, swaying as the stick comes down on its head, and finally succeeding. The game during this stage is similar to an RTS. Rather than controlling one creature, the player now controls an entire tribe and can give them commands, such as gathering food, attacking other tribes or simply moving to a certain location. The player may give the tribe tools such as weapons, musical instruments, and healing or food-gathering implements. Food now replaces "DNA points" as the player's currency, and can be spent on structures and additional tribe members, or used to appease other tribes. Creatures also gain the option to wear clothes, the editing of which replaces the Creature Editor in the 'Tribal Editor'. If creatures of a different species were added to the player's pack in the Creature phase, they are now used as pets. Additional creatures may be domesticated in the Tribal phase, which provide eggs for food. Contact with other tribes of the same species, or even different species, can take place in this stage. Creatures also "speak", most noticeably in a cutscene where the player advances to the civilization stage, with icons embedded in word balloons.
Tribe members are created by giving birth to babies (which costs ten food) and waiting for them to grow up, although the tribe can only support a certain number of members. After reaching maturity, they can do jobs like gather food, hunt animals, attack opposing tribes, and befriend other tribes. Combat can be made more effective with weapons like stone axes or throwing spears (for attacking units) and flaming torches (for destroying buildings). For socializing, a player can obtain musical instruments: wooden horns, maracas and didgeridoos for the tribe. Those are more essential than weapons, for other tribes will get annoyed if the creatures don't play music correctly (or at all). Also, miscellaneous tools can be used for fishing and gathering food, and for healing tribe members. All tools, however, require a specialized tool shack, which costs food to build. Tribe members can also gather food, an essential concept.
Creature stage mouths affect what kind of food they can gather and eat. For instance, herbivores cannot eat meat or fish (although they will fish for seaweed), and carnivores can't eat fruit. Obviously, omnivores have a slight advantage because they can eat anything, although they have to eat more food in order to be full. Animals can be hunted for meat, and fish can be speared for food. Fruit is gathered from trees and bushes, and players can also domesticate animals for eggs. Eggs can be eaten by carnivores, herbivores and omnivores, and "can" be taken from non-domesticated animals, but this angers them and causes them to instantly turn hostile. Herbivores can use fishing hotspots, but will get seaweed instead of fish. Any foreign animals belonging to the player's pack in creature stage are automatically added to the tribe as farm animals, but non-domesticated ones will sometimes sneak up and attempt to eat some of the player's food. Other tribes also can provide food for the player. An allied tribe will occasionally bring the player a gift (a basket of food tied with a large purple bow) to show their gratitude. Also, players can steal food from other tribes (though it angers them), and dead tribes may be pillaged for their food, if they had any.
The creatures' behaviors are affected by the way the player utilizes them. If a player uses them aggressively, their autonomic behavior will reflect that; conversely, if the player uses them peacefully, allying other tribes, their behavior will be more kind. Even their idle behavior will reflect this; warlike tribal members will practice combat while docile members will practice playing musical instruments and throw parties.
There are five other tribes that appear along with the player's tribe. 3 are aggressive, 2 are passive, and all 5 can either be destroyed or befriended. For every tribe befriended or destroyed, a piece of a totem pole is built, which may increase the population limit of the player's tribe or grant access to new tools and clothes. Depending on the means the tribe used to overtake the neighboring tribe—by forming an alliance or annihilating the tribe—the totem piece will either be a music-playing figure or an angry, axe-wielding figure. When the totem pole has five pieces, symbolizing the five foreign tribes, the player may move forward to the Civilization stage.
Civilization stage.
This stage begins with a cutscene showing a brainstorming between several members of the player's tribe about what they should do. One tribesman suggests the building of a city, another suggests the creation of vehicles, one reminds the gathering of the tribe's ideal, and another shouts "PIE!" The rest of the tribe are confused by this and the chief dismisses it, shouting town, ideal, vehicles. Fireworks then come from around the city hall.
The events of Tribal Stage have left the player's tribe the dominant species of the planet, but the species itself has now fragmented into many separate nations, similar to the way humanity now lives. The player retains control of a single nation with one city. The goal in the civilization phase is to gain control of the entire planet, and it is left to the player to decide whether to conquer it using military force, diplomacy, or religious influence. When entering the phase, the tribal camp is now a city. Two new editors (the building and vehicle editors) are used to create city buildings and vehicles. The player can place three types of buildings (House, Factory, and Entertainment) around the City Hall (which can also be customized) and may build up to 3 types of vehicles (sea, land and air). These vehicles can also serve military, economic or religious purposes. The main unit of currency is "Sporebucks", which is used to purchase vehicles and buildings. To earn income, players can capture spice geysers and set up spice derricks at their locations, conduct trade, or build factories (see below).
In constructing vehicles and buildings, as with most real-time strategy games, there is a capacity limit; building houses will increase the cap, and constructing various buildings adjacent to one another will provide a productivity bonus or deficit: for example, building an entertainment centre next to a house will provide happiness, but a factory will decrease happiness, though increase income. Putting an entertainment centre next to a factory defeats the purpose of the entertainment center, as it creates a red line of unhappiness. Like "Civilization III" and "IV", the player's territory is marked with a colored border that increases as the player gains more power through militarism, influence or economic negotiations.
For the first couple of minutes upon beginning the civilization stage, the player's nation is the only existing one on the planet, with one city. Tribes can still be found across the planet, and their members will all be of your species. These tribes may turn hostile towards your vehicles, and can be killed. The general goal at this point is to set up spice derricks at spice geysers to improve the nation's income and expand your territory. But soon other nations will form and will be looking at the same goal. Their existence means you will not be able to continue expanding your empire without using military force, propaganda or simply buying out cities. Players can choose to gain global domination depending on the types of cities they own. Military states grow solely by attacking other cities. Instead of military conquest, players with a religious trait construct special missionary units that convert other cities via religious propaganda. Likewise, economic players communicate solely by trade and have no weapons (except for defensive Turrets). They also gain more money by trading. However, if the player's state captures a city of a different type, they can choose to have the city retain its original type if they wish.
Diplomacy also becomes more complex in the Civilization Stage. Aside from the aforementioned trading with other cities, players can improve relations with another nations by complimenting them, giving them gifts of money and fighting their enemies. Players can also form alliances with a rival civilization, and when the entire world has been conquered by both factions, the rival faction will join the player's.
Capturing cities is the key to Civilization stage. With more cities, players can support bigger armies or merchant fleets. An economic player can send trade ships and vehicles to the opponent's cities to trade with them, if they have a trade route. Each one will bring in a small profit, as well as swifter "buyout". After trading with a city for a while, the player can buy it. A military player can use vehicles armed with weapons to destroy buildings to lower morale, so the city eventually surrenders. In addition, a city will surrender faster if they are unhappy (i.e. if the city has few entertainment buildings and a lot of factories). The third strategy, religious domination, involves converting cities to the player's religion. Religious vehicles spread propaganda to cities via a gigantic hologram of a god in the species' image, but can be harmed and destroyed in the process, as enemies don't like their cities defecting. All three paths can eventually use a superweapon, which requires a large number of cities and Sporebucks, but will allow the player to conquer the world in one shot.
Epic creatures are also seen in the stage. They are much larger (perhaps meaning they too have evolved), with 3000 health, and will attack cities. Defense turrets will open fire at the epic creature the second it begins damaging the city. This will only draw the epic's attention to the turret, which will most likely be destroyed very quickly. The player will probably have to use a large amount of military force in order to defeat the epic creature. However, the player no longer needs to kill them, as they can be temporarily charmed and manipulated by religious vehicles. When the player has neutralized all the civilizations on the planet and decides to move on to the Space Stage, the spaceship editor appears.
Space stage.
The space stage provides new goals and paths as the player begins to spread through the galaxy.
The player may now terraform and colonize neighboring uninhabited planets with special tools. Although these tools start off as limited and very expensive one-use items, the player can later obtain limitless energy-based versions. Terraforming tools include a heat-ray which can create more favorable conditions on, for example, an ice planet. If left unchecked, this can cause oceans to rise, then eventually to evaporate and transform the world into a desert planet, followed by a molten rock in space (though since Heat Ray is a manual tool, this will only happen if the tool is left on). There are four levels of planet quality, called T0, T1, T2, and T3; each subsequent level allows the player to place more cities and buildings on the planet. Plant and animal life are needed to support and stabilize an atmosphere by balancing the ecosystem. Terraforming can also be used as a weapon, sucking out the atmosphere or altering the temperature of a planet in order to kill the inhabitants without a pitched battle. This can be useful when dealing with planets that are T3 and have more than three cities on it. When lowering the terrascore cities will begin to be destroyed. For example, terraforming a T3 planet down to T2 will leave 2 cities on the planet. The ultimate terraforming tool is a technology called the Staff of Life, dubbed the 'Genesis device' prior to the game's release, which instantly can transform any planet into an ideal (T3) planet, complete with stable temperature and fully filled ecosystems, although it is limited to 42 uses. Players may build colonies on the surface of an inhospitable planet to create bubbled cities, similar in function to self-sustaining arcologies. When establishing colonies on alien worlds, players have to take care of them as they would any other city and keep morale up.
The player may also abduct creatures and transport them to other planets to test a planet's habitability and to create ecosystems to stabilize a planet's atmosphere. The player may utilize various tools such as crop circles to interact with primitive lifeforms, or place a monolith (in the style of "") on a planet, triggering evolution of intelligence. On some worlds, the player may also find strange "artifacts" with functions varying from planet terraforming tools to treasures which can be sold to other empires for a good price. Artifacts can be present on lifeless worlds and inhabited worlds, although taking them from planets occupied by sapient beings angers the inhabitants.
The player can encounter space pirates throughout the galaxy, which are hostile. The player's colonies will sometimes come under attack from pirate raids, and the player will be called upon to fight them off.
The player controls a single starship, built at the beginning of the Space Stage. The player can travel by clicking on other planets and moons and stars, though each jump costs a little bit of energy. By making more interstellar trips, the player can get upgraded jump drives that allow him to extend his jump range. However, near the center of the galaxy there lie denser star clusters, so the jump range is shortened as the player nears the core. Also, later in the game there is a wormhole key which enables the player to travel through black holes, offering instant transportation to a sister black hole. There are around 500,000 planets in the game's galaxy orbiting around 100,000 stars (including Earth and its star, Sol).
Players can make contact with other space-faring civilizations, called "empires", most of which contain species created by other players. This is a very important aspect of the game because almost half of the solar systems have other lifeforms already inhabiting them. The empires the player encounters can have different personalities. For example, the player may encounter a diplomatic empire who communicate politely, welcome the player's presence and are relatively easy to ally. However, the player may encounter a more unfriendly empire who doesn't trust the player and requires more in order to be pleased. If the player chooses to interact with them he can either befriend them or attack. If the player chose to interact with them he can be nice or rude while introducing himself which can add to them liking him or add negative points to how much they like him. Diplomacy in the Space Stage is the same as the Civilization Stage, but with the added option of doing missions, and using various devices on a planet's inhabitants. Completing missions for an empire improves the player's relationship with them, as does trading and assisting in fending off attacks. When the player has become allied with an empire, they can ask certain favors of the empire. For example, they can ask for a ship from their fleet to assist them in their travels. The player can even ask an allied empire to attack another empire, though a considerable sum of Sporebucks is usually demanded in return. Allied empires can sometimes ask favors of the player, which mainly includes helping to fight off attacks from other empires. If the player becomes enemies with an empire, they will send a small fleet of ships to attack the player's ship as soon as they enter their territory.
One of the main goals in the Space Stage is for the player to push his way toward a supermassive black hole at the galaxy's center. Completing this mission rewards the player with the previously mentioned Staff of Life while introducing the game's final antagonists, the Grox, a unique species of cybernetic aliens with a powerful empire of 2400 systems surrounding the core. The Grox have an extreme hate for everyone, and allying them is extremely hard, as they will attack whenever one enters one of their systems. If done, the player can receive the "Dancing with devils" badge, but all the empires will instantly become enemies. One mission the player can get is to find the Grox, another is to fight them (They are mostly based on The Borg of the Series).
If Galactic Adventures is installed, the player may be given missions which involve travelling to planets, beaming down and completing Maxis-created, planetside 'adventures'. With this expansion, the player can also upgrade his Captain with weapons and accessories which assist in these adventures. The occupants of allied ships can also take part in these adventures.
Editors/creators.
User-generated content is a major feature of "Spore"; there are eighteen different types of editors (some unique to a phase), including a music editor which allows players to create (but not share) songs to be used as a national anthem in the Civilization stages and above. Will Wright has stated that in addition to being simple, all the editors will be as similar as possible so that skills learned are easily transferable from one editor to the next.
The editors start simply in the cellular phase and move to higher levels of complexity, acting as tutorials for progressive levels of gameplay. For example, the cell editor has nine choices and a two-dimensional environment while the creature editor has dozens of options and a 3D environment. The structure ranges from a spine and body model in the creature editor to more free-form editors for the buildings. You may make and edit as many creatures as desired from the 'galaxy' menu.
For example, the creature editor allows the player to take what looks like a lump of clay with a spine and mold it into a creature. Once one has molded the torso, the player can add parts such as legs, arms, feet, hands, noses, eyes, mouths, decorative elements, and a wide array of sensory organs. Many of these parts affect the creature's abilities (speed, strength, diet, etc.), while some parts are purely decorative. Once the creature is formed, it can be painted using a large number of textures, overlays, colors, and patterns, which are procedurally applied depending on the topology of the creature. The only required feature is the mouth, and the player cannot save their creature if it has no mouth, as it cannot do a mating call and find a mate, opening the creator in-game. All other parts are optional; for example, creatures without legs will slither on the ground like a slug or an inchworm, and creatures without arms will simply be unable to pick up objects in the Creature Stage (see above). Eyes are optional, though an eyeless creature can only "see" a short range around them. This range is in grey-scale.
Other editors are used for buildings and for vehicles. Eventually, players can even edit entire planets, using various in-game processes. Electronic Arts has promised new editors to be released after the game's release, such as a flora editor. However, a beta flora editor and expanded cell editor are available in the game code and can be accessed by changing the target parameters for the shortcut executable. It is worth noting that the beta flora editor does not affect gameplay, as no creation can be used or uploaded.
There are also simple means of creating visual media, such as a screenshot facility that captures the screen without the surrounding user-interface and a 640x480 video creator with a built-in YouTube upload service. Maxis has also partnered with a third party to provide a Spore-branded Comic Book Creator service, which was live at launch. All creations are placed inside the "Sporepedia". These creations can be viewed and downloaded by other players and vice versa. So far, over 170,000,000 creations have been shared.
There are two new editors seen in the new expansion : these include the captain editor (also called the captain outfitter) and the adventure creator, which enables terraforming and placing objects freely on special adventure planets. On July 21, 2009, Maxis released a patch for the game that allows players to create asymmetric creations without hacks. This feature applies to all the editors in the game. (This excludes any building editors, as they supported asymmetry before the patch.)
Community.
"Spore's" user community functionality includes a feature that is part of an agreement with YouTube granting players the ability to upload directly from within the game a YouTube video of their creatures' activity, and EA's creation of "The "Spore" YouTube Channel", which will showcase the most popular videos created this way. In addition, some user-created content will be highlighted by Maxis at the official "Spore" site, and earn badges of recognition. One of "Spore's" most social features is the "Sporecast", an RSS feed that players can use to subscribe to the creations of any specific "Spore" player, allowing them to track their creations. There is a toggle which allows the player to restrict what downloadable content will be allowed; choices include: "no user generated content", "official Maxis-approved content", "downloadable friend content", and "all user-created content". Players can also ban any content in-game, at any time, and Maxis monitors content with notable numbers of player bans.
Spore API.
"Spore" has also released an API to allow developers to access data about player activity, the content they produce and their interactions with each other. The "Spore" API is a collection of RESTful public web services that return data in xml format. In April 2009, the results of the "Spore" API Contest was concluded with winners building interactive visualizations, games, mobile applications and content navigation tools. The API also includes a Developers forum for people wishing to use all the creations people have made to create applications.
Interplay.
The game is referred to as a "massively single-player online game" and "asynchronous sharing." Simultaneous multiplayer gaming is not a feature of "Spore". The content that the player can create is uploaded automatically to a central database, cataloged and rated for quality (based on how many users have downloaded the object or creature in question), and then re-distributed to populate other players' games. The data transmitted is very small — only a couple of kilobytes per item transmitted – due to procedural generation of material.
Via the in-game "MySpore Page", players receive statistics of how their creatures are faring in other players' games, which has been referred to as the "alternate realities of the "Spore" metaverse." The game reports to the player on how other players have interacted with him or her. For example, the game reports how many times other players have allied with the player's species. The personalities of user-created species are dependent on how the user played them.
Players can share creations, chat, and roleplay in the Sporum, the game's internet forum hosted by Maxis. Multiple sections allow forum users users to share creations and tips for the game, as well as roleplay.
Sporepedia.
The "Sporepedia" keeps track of nearly every gameplay experience, including the evolution of a creature by graphically displaying a timeline which shows how the creature incrementally changed over the eons; it also keeps track of the creature's achievements, both noteworthy and dubious, as a species. The "Sporepedia" also keeps track of all the creatures, planets, vehicles and other content the player encounters over the course of a game. Players can upload their creations to Spore.com to be viewed by the public at the "Sporepedia" website. The ever-growing list of creations made by players is past the 100 million mark so far.
Procedural generation.
"Spore" uses procedural generation extensively in relation to content pre-made by the developers. Wright mentioned in an interview given at E3 2006 that the information necessary to generate an entire creature would be only a couple of kilobytes, and went on to give the following analogy: "think of it as sharing the DNA template of a creature while the game, like a womb, builds the 'phenotypes' of the animal, which represent a few uploaded and downloaded freely and quickly from the "Sporepedia" online server. This allows users to asynchronously upload their creations and download other players' content, which enriches the experience of the game as more of its players progress in the game."
Reception.
IGN Australia awarded "Spore" a 9.2 out of 10 score, saying, "It ["Spore"] will make you acknowledge just how far we’ve come, and just how far we have to go, and "Spore" will change the way you think about the universe we live in." "PC Gamer" UK awarded the game a 91%, saying ""Spore's" triumph is painfully ironic. By setting out to instill a sense of wonderment at creation and the majesty of the universe, it's shown us that it's actually a lot more interesting to sit here at our computers and explore the contents of each other's brains." In its 4.5 (of 5) -star review, GameSpy wrote ""Spore" is a technological triumph that introduces a whole new way of tapping into a bottomless well of content."
Most of the criticism of "Spore" came from the lack of depth in the first four phases, summarized by Eurogamer's 9 of 10 review, which stated, "for all their mighty purpose, the first four phases of the game don't always play brilliantly, and they're too fleeting." 1UP.com reasoned in its B+ graded review, "It's not a perfect game, but it's definitely one that any serious gamer should try." GameSpot in its 8.0 of 10 review called "Spore" "a legitimately great game that will deliver hours of quality entertainment", but criticized the "individual gameplay elements are extremely simple." Jason Ocampo's IGN 8.8 of 10 review stated, "Maxis has made an impressive product that does so many incredible things" but added, "while "Spore" is an amazing product, it's just not quite an amazing game."
"The New York Times "review of "Spore" mostly centered on lack of depth and quality of gameplay in the later phases of the game, stating that "most of the basic core play dynamics in "Spore" are unfortunately rather thin." While a review in "PC Gamer" US stated that "it just isn't right to judge "Spore" in the context of so many of the other games we judge", it was named "the most disappointing game of 2008" by Chris Kohler of "Wired". "Zero Punctuation" was also critical of the game, claiming it did not live up to the legacy of The Sims: "The chief failing of "Spore" is that it's trying to be five games, each one a shallow and cut down equivalent of another game, with the Civilization stage even going so far as to be named after the game it's bastardizing."
Criticism has also emerged surrounding the stability of the game, with "The Daily Telegraph" stating:
"The launch of "Spore", the keenly anticipated computer game from the creators of "The Sims", has been blighted by technical problems." In an interview published by MTV, "Spore" designer Will Wright responded to early criticism that the phases of the game had been dumbed-down by explaining "We were very focused, if anything, on making a game for more casual players. "Spore" has more depth than, let’s say, "The Sims" did. But we looked at the Metacritic scores for "Sims 2", which was around ninety, and something like "Half-Life", which was ninety-seven, and we decided — quite a while back — that we would rather have the Metacritic and sales of "Sims 2" than the Metacritic and sales of "Half-Life"".
In its first three weeks on sale, the game sold 2 million copies, according to Electronic Arts.
DRM controversy.
"Spore" uses a modified version of the controversial digital rights management (DRM) software SecuROM as copy protection, which requires authentication upon installation and when online access is used. This system was announced after the originally planned system met opposition from the public, as it would have required authentication every ten days. Additionally, EA released the game under a policy by which the product key of an individual copy of the game would only be authenticated on up to three computers. In response to customer complaints, this limit was raised to five computers. After the activation limit has been depleted, EA Customer Service will consider further activations on a case-by-case basis. A survey conducted by EA revealed that only 14% have activated on more than 1 PC and less than 1% of users have tried to activate "Spore" on more than 3 PCs.
By September 14, 2008 (ten days after the game's initial Australian release), 2,016 of 2,216 ratings on Amazon.com gave the game one out of five stars, most citing EA's implementation of DRM for the low ratings. Electronic Arts cited "SecuROM" as a "standard for the industry", and Apple's iPod song DRM policy as justification for the control method. Former Maxis developer Chris Harris labeled the DRM a "screw up" and a "totally avoidable disaster".
The "SecuROM" software was not mentioned on the box, in the manual, or in the software license agreement. An EA spokesperson stated that "we don't disclose specifically which copy protection or digital rights management system we use [...] because EA typically uses one license agreement for all of its downloadable games, and different EA downloadable games may use different copy protection and digital rights management.” A pirated version without the DRM was released two days before the initial Australian release making "Spore" the most pirated game of 2008.
On September 22, 2008, a class action lawsuit was filed against EA, regarding the DRM in Spore, complaining about EA not disclosing the existence of SecuROM, and addressing how SecuROM runs with the nature of a rootkit, including how it remains on the hard drive even after "Spore" is uninstalled. On October 14, 2008, a similar class action lawsuit was filed against EA for the inclusion of DRM software in the free demo version of the Creature Creator.
EA began selling "Spore" without SecuROM on December 22, 2008 through Steam. Furthermore, EA Games president Frank Gibeau announced that maximum install limit would be increased from 3 to 5 and that it would be possible to de-authorize and move installations to new machines, citing the need to adapt their policy to accommodate their legitimate customers. EA has stated, "By running the de-authorization tool, a machine 'slot' will be freed up on the online Product Authorization server and can then be re-used by another machine. You can de-authorize at any time, even without uninstalling Spore, and free up that machine authorization. If you re-launch "Spore" on the same machine, the game will attempt to re-authorize. If you have not reached the machine limitation, the game will authorize and the machine will be re-authorized using up one of the five available machines." However, the de-authorization tool to do this is not available on the Mac platform.
Scientific accuracy.
The educational community has shown some interest in using "Spore" to teach students about evolution and biology. However, the game's player-driven evolution mechanism differs from real world evolution in some key ways:
In October 2008, John Bohannon of "Science" magazine assembled a team to review the game's portrayal of evolution and other scientific concepts. Evolutionary biologists T. Ryan Gregory of the University of Guelph and Niles Elredge of the American Museum of Natural History reviewed the Cell and Creature stages. William Sims Bainbridge, a sociologist from the U.S. National Science Foundation, reviewed the Tribe and Civilization stages. NASA's Miles Smith reviewed the Space stage. The "Science" team evaluated "Spore" on twenty-two subjects. The game's grades ranged from a single A in galactic structure and a B+ in sociology to Fs in mutation, sexual selection, natural selection, genetics, and genetic drift. In addition, Yale evolutionary biologists Thomas Near and Thomas Prum found "Spore" fun to play and admired its ability to get people to think about evolutionary questions, but consider the game's evolutionary mechanism to be "severely messed up."
According to "Seed" magazine, the original concept for "Spore" was more scientifically accurate than the version that was eventually released. It included more realistic artwork for the single-celled organisms and a rejection of faster-than-light travel as impossible. However, these were removed to make the game more friendly to casual users. While "Seed" does not entirely reject "Spore" as a teaching tool, admiring its ability to show the user experimentation, observation, and scale, biological concepts did not fare so well:
Will Wright argues that developers "put the player in the role of an intelligent designer," because of the lack of emotional engagement of early prototype focusing on mutation. Intelligent design advocate Michael Behe of Lehigh University reviewed the game and said that "Spore" "has nothing to do with real science or real evolution — neither Darwinian nor intelligent design," contradicting the argument that the game promotes intelligent design over evolution.
Licensing.
Electronic Arts is using the "Spore" license to develop many related products, including console games and merchandising. Such licensing includes
Software.
Electronic Arts confirmed that "Spore" will be receiving post-release expansion packs.
The Nintendo DS spinoff is titled "Spore Creatures", focusing on the Creature phase. The game is a 2D/3D story-based role-playing game as the gamer plays a creature kidnapped by a UFO and forced to survive in a strange world, with elements of "Nintendogs". Another "Spore" title for the DS called "Spore Hero Arena" was released in 2009. "Spore Origins" is the mobile phone/iPhone/iPod spinoff of "Spore", and as with the Nintendo DS version, focuses on a single phase of gameplay; in this case, the cell phase. The simplified game allows players to try to survive as a multicellular organism in a tide pool, similar to "flOw". The iPhone version takes advantage of the device's touch capabilities and 3-axis accelerometer.
A Wii spinoff of the game now known as "Spore Hero" has been mentioned by Will Wright several times, such as in his October 26, 2007 interview with "The Guardian". Buechner confirmed it, revealing that plans for a Wii version were underway, and that the game would be built from the ground up and would take advantage of the Wii Remote, stating, "We're not porting it over. You know, we're still so early in design and prototyping that I don't know where we're going to end up, so I don't want to lead you down one path. But suffice to say that it's being developed with the Wii controls and technology in mind." Eventually, a spin-off under the title "Spore Hero" was announced, an adventure game built ground up for the Wii with a heavier focus on evolution, was announced." The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of "Spore" are still under consideration. Frank Gibeau, president of Electronic Arts' Games Label announced that the publisher might use the underlying technology of "Spore" to develop electric software titles, such as action, real-time strategy, and role-playing games for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii.
An expansion pack named "" was released on June 23, 2009. It allows the player's creature to beam onto planets, rather than using a hologram. It also adds an "Adventure Creator" which allows for the creation of missions and goals to share with the "Spore" community. Creatures can add new abilities, including weaponry, tanks, and crew members, as well as a section of the adventure creator that involves editing a planet and using 60 new flora parts.
"Spore: Creepy & Cute".
In late 2008, EA released the Creepy and Cute expansion pack which includes new parts and colors for creature creation. The pack also includes new test-drive animations and backgrounds.
"Spore Bot Parts".
As part of an EA promotion with Dr. Pepper in early 2010, 14 new robotic parts for "Spore" creatures were released in a new patch (1.06.0000) available only from the Dr. Pepper website. Codes found on certain bottles of Dr Pepper allow the player to redeem these parts, albeit only for the USA, excluding Maine. It was only available for Windows PC, and was eventually extended to Canadian residents. The promotion ended in late 2011.
The Spore Bot Parts Pack has caused controversy within the "Spore" community, because of many problems with the download and its exclusive nature.
Merchandising.
There is an iTunes-style ""Spore" Store" built into the game, allowing players to purchase external "Spore" licensed merchandise, such as t-shirts, posters, and future "Spore" expansion packs. There are also plans for the creation of a type of "Spore" collectible card game based on the "Sporepedia" cards of the creatures, buildings, vehicles, and planets that have been created by the players. There are also indications of plans for the creation of customized creature figurines; some of those who designed their own creatures at E3 2006 later received 3D printed models of the creatures they created. On December 18, 2008, it was announced that players could now turn their creations into 3D sculptures using Z Corporations 3D printing technology.
The "Spore" Store also allows people to put their creatures on such items as T-shirts, mugs, and stickers. The "Spore" team is working on a partnership with a comic creation software company to offer comic book versions of players' "Spore stories". Comic books with stylized pictures of various creatures, some whose creation has been shown in various presentations, can be seen on the walls of the "Spore" team's office. The utility was revealed at the on July 24, 2008 as the "Spore Comic Creator", which would utilize MashOn.com and its e-card software.
Theatrical film.
EA, 20th Century Fox, and AIG announced the development of a "Spore" film on October 1, 2009. The movie adaptation will be a CGI-animated film created by Blue Sky Studios. Chris Wedge, the director of "Ice Age", "Robots", and "Epic" is set to direct the upcoming film. A release date for the film adaptation is currently unknown at this time.
Soundtrack.
Cliff Martinez composed the main menu Galaxy theme track. Brian Eno created the generative music together with Peter Chilvers and is credited for the ”spore compositions”. "Solar System", "Timeline" and a few other tracks on Spore—"Religious Vehicle Editor", and "Sporepedia"—might also be the work of Martinez.

Bélo

Bélo (born 29 October 1979, Port-au-Prince, Haiti) is the stage name of Jean Bélony Murat, who is a famous Haitian interpreter, composer and guitarist. His first album "Lakou trankil" ("Quiet Streets") is treasured by Haitians because the songs explain and reflect the problems the country faces. Bélo is popular in Europe and Africa where he won the Discovery RFI Prime in April 2006. This award had already helped other artists like Tiken Jah Fakoly and Rokia Traoré to reveal their talent in the music industry. Bélo's musical approach is influenced by other Caribbean styles but mostly by jazz and reggae.
Life.
Jean Bélony Murat was born on October 29, 1979, at Croix des Bouquet in the north of Port-au-Prince, the capital of Haiti. He grew up at Petion Ville an area where music has an important role in the Haitian community. He started to sing at a very young age and at 11 years old interpreted Buju Banton, his idol. In 1994, he and his friend formed the Mega Boys which was not very successful. In 1997, he met Fabrice Rouzier and San, two artists who discovered his talent and encouraged him to play an instrument. At first, he chose the bass but changed later to the guitar. He knew that music could not be his only occupation if he was to please his supporters. He went to university in 2001 where he studied accounting for four years. Then he was ready to devote his life to music and released his first album in 2005.
Music.
After "Lakou trankil", the first album which had a lot of success locally and internationally, Bélo released "Reference". This is also close to reggae and has a touch of pop and jazz. He exposed the social problems of humankind, such as violence, AIDS and homeless children. In other words, Bélo is an ambassador of the Haitian music; he shows love and affection for his homeland.

The Outlaws of Sherwood

The Outlaws of Sherwood is a retelling of the legend of Robin Hood by Robin McKinley. In McKinley's "Afterword", the history of the tales of Robin Hood is described as "the retellings through the centuries have echoed concurrent preoccupations."
The story includes both the traditional Robin Hood characters like Little John, Friar Tuck, and Allan-a-Dale, alongside characters of McKinley's own invention, with detailed attention to the motivations and thoughts of characters. Notably, three of the most important characters are women, and all of them escape marriage to prospective spouses chosen for economic or political reasons by their fathers.
Summary.
Robin is on his way to meet his friends Marian, a noblewoman, and Much, the miller's son, at the Nottingham Fair. Robin serves as a king's forester in Sherwood forest and fletches arrows to make enough income to keep his holding. Robin is just a mediocre archer - his father Robert was much better, and Robin feels he doesn't live up to his father's legacy. On his way, Robin is accosted by some of the other foresters. An archery contest ensues between Robin and one of the foresters, Tom Moody, and Robin miraculously wins. As he is walking away, one of the foresters shoots an arrow at Robin that nearly kills him. Without thinking, Robin shoots at arrow at Tom Moody's leg, but it instead hits his heart and kills him. Robin runs away and hides in the forest until Much and Marian find him. Much hides Robin in his father's barn at the mill, and Marian steals Robin's father's longbow for him from Robin's house. 
Much thinks that Robin should hide in Sherwood Forest and gather a band of men with him as an idealistic resistance to the tyrannous sheriff of Nottingham. Robin disagrees, not wanting to put others in danger, but is overruled when Much begins to hold meetings in his house with other disgruntled members of the community. Robin finds a place in the woods, which later earns the name Greentree, for the outlaws’ camp. Marian assists the effort by procuring green fabric for clothing.
The band grows, and they live by killing the king’s deer with arrows they make themselves. They also begin to rob the rich who pass through the forest to assist the local families. Many members join the band, including the huge man Little John, who killed a man coming to arrest him for the debt he owed on his farm, and Will Scarlet, a cheerful nobleman, as well as several female members and families. Will soon receives troubling news that his younger sister has locked herself in her room rather than wed a Norman baron, but Robin refuses to help, thinking the effort too dangerous and not worthwhile.
Soon a young minstrel named Alan-a-dale seeks their help. His beloved, Marjorie, is to wed a baron, and he wants to rescue her. Despite Robin’s misgivings, the band agrees. They seek out Will’s friend Friar Tuck to perform the wedding ceremony and show up at the chapel on Marjorie’s wedding day, where Marjorie marries Alan instead of the original groom, the disgruntled baron. Meanwhile, Little John and others rob the baron’s house. Following the wedding, Alan and Marjorie join Robin’s band.
Robin’s band soon after takes on a mysterious young man named Cecil, who Robin suspects was once an aristocrat because he avoids Will and Marian, who frequently visits the outlaws, as they are people who possibly once knew him in his former life. He is assigned to Little John for training.
Robin soon hears word that Sir Richard of the Lea, a man who was very kind to him when Robin was a king’s forester, is about to lose his property due to debts racked up by bailing his troublesome son out of trouble. The son was sent off to fight with King Richard in the Holy Lands, but Sir Richard will lose his castle. Robin and his men gather up the riches “collected” from those who pass through their forest and head off to Sir Richard’s castle the day it is to be turned over to its new owner. The only reason the outlaws are not all killed is because Marian is present and negotiated on Robin’s behalf. Her suitor, Nigel, is jealous of the way that Robin and Marian act towards each other, and Robin and Nigel even get into a fight that Robin wins. Though Sir Richard is grateful, Robin’s worries increase because he realizes the sheriff of Nottingham has even greater cause to hate him because Robin made him appear foolish.
The day before the Nottingham fair, a year after Robin became an outlaw, Cecil is discovered to be a girl, and Will recognizes her as his sister, Cecily, who had hid in her room so she wouldn’t have to be married. They make up, and Cecily is allowed to stay in the band.
Marian brings Robin news of an archery contest at the fair with a prize of a golden arrow – it is obviously a trap for Robin. Robin does not go, but Cecily and Little John go in disguise to see what happens. They watch an archer win the contest, who everyone believes to be Robin Hood. However, Little John and Cecily realize that the man is actually Marian in disguise. Guy of Gisbourne, a mercenary hired by the sheriff of Nottingham, attacks Marian, thinking she is Robin. Cecily and Little John, with the help some traveling performers, spirit Marian away to Friar Tuck’s hideout in the forest. Marian has a deep wound to the stomach. Little John runs to get Robin back at Greentree, who recklessly runs to Tuck’s place as fast as he can. He and Marian talk, and for the first time, he tells her he loves her. He also asks her to marry him, and is slightly relieved when Tuck thinks Marian will recover.
Soon after, Guy of Gisbourne and his men find Tuck’s hideout, believing he is hiding an injured Robin. Robin and his band attack Guy’s men, and though they are heavily outnumbered and sustain many injuries, they manage to defeat them. However, several members of their band die in the effort. During the battle, Marjorie runs to get help from Sir Richard, who arrives the next morning and takes the outlaws back to his castle to keep them safe from the sheriff. The sheriff is furious that Sir Richard is hiding the outlaws, and both he and Sir Richard send word to King Richard the Lionheart, who has just returned from captivity in a German prison. During their stay, Little John and Cecily profess their love for one another, and the outlaws begin to recover from their wounds.
After some days, King Richard shows up at Sir Richard’s castle unannounced. He makes all the outlaws swear fealty to him, and then discusses their fates. He tells them that every able-bodied one of them must go to fight in the Holy Lands against the Saracens for their punishment. He offers the injured ones a chance to stay in England, but they all wish to go with Robin to the Holy Lands. Since Sir Richard’s son died in the war, the king makes Robin the heir to Sir Richard’s lands and will allow Robin and Marian to marry before the band must leave for the Holy Lands. The book closes with a toast to health, victory, the king’s mercy, and comrades.

Joan George Erardus Gijsbertus Voûte (June 7, 1879–August 20, 1963) was a Dutch astronomer.
He was born in Madioen, Java to a Huguenot family. He studied civil engineering at Delft, but while a student he gained an interest in astronomy—studying variable stars. After graduating he joined the staff of the Leiden Observatory, where he worked on binary stars. In 1913 he gained a post at the Cape Observatory in South Africa, where he worked on double stars and parallax measurements. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1917. His preliminary account of the parallax of Proxima Centauri was published in 1917, demonstrating that Proxima was the same distance from the Sun as the Alpha Centauri system.
He returned to Java in 1919, where he served as an assistant at the Weltevreden meteorological and magnetic observatory. There he was able to gain the interest of wealthy friends for the construction of an observatory. Voûte became the Director, and he selected the 1,300 m altitude Lembang for the site. The main instrument was a 60 cm Zeiss double refractor. The work of the observatory focused on double stars, parallax measurements, photometry of variable stars and clusters, and so forth. The results were published in the "Lembang Observatory Annals".
Following the Japanese occupation of Java, Voûte was imprisoned. As a result of his captivity he suffered from poor health, so after the war he moved to Australia. Later he settled at The Hague, Holland, where he died in 1963.

Drusenfluh

The Drusenfluh is a mountain in the Rätikon mountain range (Alps), located on the border between Austria and Switzerland.
According to the Swisstopo map, the mountain both includes the 2827 m Drusenfluh on the border and the three peaks named the :de:Drei Türme or Dri Türm ("Three Towers"), the highest of which (2830 m) is north of the main ridge on the Austrian site. The Drusenfluh and Drei Türme are separated by the 2628 m "Eisjöchle". 
After Christian Zudrell's first ascent, it took 18 years before a second ascent was successful. This second tour ended all doubts about the first ascent as the two mounaineers, Karl Blodig und Eugen Sohm, encountered a rock on the peak of the mountain, that had the signs "C Z 70" engraved, the "visiting card" that Zudrell had left on the peak. This piece of rock was brought to the Lindauer Hütte in 1995 to protect it, as weather and lightnings had destroyed it more and more.
There is several routes for climbers mainly in the sheer drops of the southern face (which is the Graubünden side on Swiss territory. From the Austrian site, one of the Drei Türme can be reached via a mountain path from the Lindauer Hut (Swiss grade T4, signposted white and blue). 
The multiday hike "Prättigauer Höhenweg" passes south of the mountain.

Étienne Pavillon

Étienne Pavillon (1632 - 10 January 1705) was a French lawyer and poet.
Biography.
Grandson of a famous lawyer and nephew of bishop Nicolas Pavillon, Pavillon was born and died in Paris. He first studied theology before renouncing this to become "avocat général" to the parliament of Metz. Before having spent ten years in that role, he had a reverse in his fortunes and returned to Paris. Suffering from gout and pensioned off by Louis XIV, he set up a salon to which high society flocked. "She found in him conversation that was fine and witty, clever and polite, instructive without being pedantic". Thus, against La Bruyère and without having asked for it, he was elected a member of the Académie française in 1691, then of the Académie des inscriptions in 1701.
Étienne Pavillon was an author of "vers de circonstance", in stanzas and madrigals, and of letters in verse or prose in the Voiture genre, gathered together for the first time in a posthumously-published volume, reissued several times between 1715 and 1750. Voltaire called him "doux mais faible Pavillon".

Valsoia

Valsoia is an Italian health food, functional foods and functional drinks company, listed on the Italian stock exchange, Borsa Italiana.
History.
Valsoia, was founded in 1990 by Lorenzo Sassoli de Bianchi, currently also President of the Italian Advertisers Association Utenti Pubblicità Associati - UPA and the Bologna Museum of Modern Art MAMbo. One of the first Italian health food companies to apply mass marketing techniques, Valsoia's branding was innovative in emphasising the pleasures as well as the health qualities of its products, helping its growing product range achieve a wider appeal than traditional health foods. Valsoia's emphasis on "Italian" taste and texture as well as health was reflected in its strapline "Bontà e salute", literally "Deliciousness (as well as goodness) and health" and this brand positioning was supported by regular cross-media advertising over the years. Valsoia's total annual sales are currently around €55m.
Product range and philosophy.
Covering a broad spectrum of soya-based, dairy-free and other sweet and savoury foods and snacks, the Valsoia product range is one of the most complete in the sector, supported by strategic partnerships with other industry leaders, including Weetabix and Tival. The company aim is to provide a complete lifestyle choice as well as to offer a broad product range.
Management approach and market position.
Valsoia has also been innovative in its management style. It was one of the first companies in Italy to offer a manager buy-in stock option and encourages staff participation at all levels. It was in this spirit that the company went public in 2006, listed on the Milan stock exchange not primarily to raise capital, but to spread the base of involvement in the company, although the operation was also a financial success.
Valsoia is Italy's number one health food company by product range and turnover, and has been growing at an average annual rate of 15% per year, which is more than three times the ACNielsen figure for growth in the Italian food sector as a whole.
The company strategy is focused on further growth through product range extension and diversification, increased market penetration and expansion into new markets. Valsoia products are currently distributed in Austria, Croatia, Germany, Greece, Slovenia, Spain and Switzerland, as well as Italy.
The future.
Although Sassoli de Bianchi has been the architect of this innovation and growth, he has consistently emphasised the contributions of his colleagues and involved as broad a range of staff as possible in the development of the company's ethos and strategic direction. The resultant shared culture appears capable of ensuring Valsoia continues to build a strong future when he is no longer at the helm. In addition, he has carefully laid the foundation for effective succession management with the 2006 flotation.

The Capitol Center for the Arts is an entertainment venue in Concord, New Hampshire, which features a 1,310 seat theatre designed with an Egyptian motif. The Center opened in its current form in 1995 after a multiyear renovation of the Capitol Theater, which had existed in the same location from 1927 to 1989. The theatre is equipped to host major Broadway shows, and has played host to the Billy Joel musical "Movin' Out", pianist George Winston, and humorist David Sedaris.
The renovation of the Capitol Center was made possible by $4.2 million in donations received for the then-newly formed center, with Chubb Life providing the majority of the support. The Chubb Theatre was named in honor of the company that made the center possible. Volunteers, some 250 of them, also contributed 3,000 hours of service to repaint the interior and restore the Egyptian motif. Paul Hodes, who subsequently became a US Representative from New Hampshire, was also instrumental in the renovation and reopening of the Center, heading up the effort at the urging of fellow lawyer and patron of the arts Martin L.

Milbemycin oxime/lufenuron

The combination milbemycin oxime/lufenuron (trade names Sentinel Flavor Tabs, by Novartis Animal Health, and Program plus) is a parasite control drug in which the active ingredient, milbemycin oxime, eliminates worms, while a second active ingredient, lufenuron, arrests the development of eggs and larvae, preventing them from maturing and continuing the infestation of an animal. This combination is registered for animal use only. To achieve efficacy, the treatment is administered once monthly, together with food, in a dosage suitable for the weight of the affected animal. The usual ratio is 500 µg milbemycin oxime and 10 mg lufenuron/kg body weight. Novartis indicates the proper dosage by color-coding the packages. 
Several 2002 studies by Novartis demonstrate that milbemycin oxime/lufenuron compares favorably to some other treatments, such as the moxidectin injection. The combination is considered effective in the elimination of fleas, and the prevention of infection from hookworm ("Ancylostoma caninum"), heartworm ("Dirofilaria immitis"), roundworms, whipworms ("Trichuris vulpis"), and ascarids ("Toxocara canis" and "Toxascaris leonina"). The USA FDA approval for Sentinel says "Concurrent use of insecticides may be necessary". It is the concurrent use of Sentinel and nitenpyram (Capstar) that has an FDA-approved indication "to kill adult fleas".
Side effects.
Milbemycin oxime/lufenuron can lead to a negative physical response in some animals, most dangerously those that test positively for heartworm disease before receiving the treatment. Less serious side effects are an upset stomach or loss of appetite, various skin irritations, and mood changes.

History.
Château de Linardié employed secretarial and administrative personnel and appointed as Artistic Director, Danielle Delouche, a graduate from the University of Sorbonne VIII, Paris, and a specialist in Art History, who has been a contributor to numerous art and design periodicals. The Association collaborated with the University of Toulouse le Mirail, where the Director of the Department of Fine Arts and Applied Arts, Xavier Lambert, as well as the Maître des Conférences, Carole Hoffman, were responsible for seminars, colloquia, and conferences. They were especially helpful in helping Linardié develop its artistic policy. Another key person was Francis Pratt, a former research fellow at the University of Stirling in Scotland where he was a founder member of the Vision Group.
Due to legal difficulties encountered by Gaillac, the town was forced to cede ownership of the Château in September 2006.

Pamphilus the Theologian

Pamphilus the Theologian was probably a late sixth century Palestinian compiler writing in the aftermath of the Council of Chalcedon and the fall-out this produced in the eastern Christian provinces. His work is in the form of questions and answers illustrating the points at issue at the Council and subsequently, i. e. in the form of chapters dealing with points such as: hypostasis, ousia, physis, and other points at debate between neo-Chalcedonians and Monophysites. The philosophical implication of such terms for Christology is thoroughly developed.
The work includes a number of quotations from standard authors such as the Cappadocians, John Chrysostom and Cyril of Alexandria, and also Pseudo-Dionysius, but also from a number of authors condemned at various councils (e.g. Apollinarius, Eunomius, Eutyches, Nestorius, Paul of Samosata, Valentinian).

He was convicted for Åsane church arson on Christmas Eve of 1992 along with Varg Vikernes and spent 2 years in prison. He gave interviews in "Satan Rides the Media" (a documentary focused on Varg Vikernes and the whole early Norwegian black metal scene) and '. Tunsberg says in both these documentaries, and also in an interview with "Bergensavisen" that he regrets nothing. In the 1990s, in "Satan Rides the Media", Tunsberg stated that the action was a response to Christian morals and that "Norway should not be Christian", the point being "very symbolic". When Sam Dunn interviewed Tunsberg for his 2005 documentary "Metal: A Headbanger's Journey", he replied that: "The most important thing that happened was that the church were… were burnt up. So… that's something I… stand for, and… I stood for it then, I will stand for it now and I will stand for it, like, 'til I die. […] It's kind of a… it's kind of a statement, uh, to… to… break down Christianity." He also worked as metal music reviewer in "Bergensavisen" tabloid.

Siegfried Horn

Siegfried Herbert Horn (March 17, 1908 – November 28, 1993) was a Seventh-day Adventist archaeologist and Bible scholar. He is perhaps best known for his numerous books and articles and for his excavations at Tell Hesban in Jordan. He was Professor of History of Antiquity at the Seventh-day Adventist Theological Seminary in Berrien Springs, Michigan (now part of Andrews University). The Siegfried H. Horn Museum at Andrews University was named in his honor. A scholar of wide-ranging interests and abilities, he made significant contributions especially in the areas of Ancient Near Eastern chronology and archaeology. In a 1985 questionnaire of North American Adventist lecturers, Horn tied for seventh place among the Adventist authors who had most influenced them.
Biography.
Horn was born March 17, 1908, to Albin and Klara Horn in Wurzen, Saxony, Germany. His father was one of the world's earliest aviators, trained as a pilot by Louis Blériot. Horn served as a minister and as a missionary from 1930 to 1940, first in the Netherlands and then in the Dutch East Indies. Because he was German, Horn spent six and a half years as a prisoner of war during World War II, from 1940 to 1946, first as a prisoner of the Dutch in Indonesia and then imprisoned by the English in India. Granted access to books, Horn made use of this time to develop his skills in Greek and Hebrew and to teach his fellow inmates. Upon gaining his freedom at the end of World War II, Horn immigrated to the United States and completed his education. He earned a B.A. at Walla Walla College (now a University) in Washington State (1947), an M.A. at the Seventh-day Adventist Theological Seminary in Washington, D.C. (1948), and a Ph.D. in Egyptology at the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago (1951). He studied briefly under William F. Albright at Johns Hopkins University.
Horn taught at the Adventist Theological Seminary from 1951 to 1976. He started an archaeological museum (later named for him), was the founding editor of the journal "Andrews University Seminary Studies", started up the Seminary's doctoral programs, and initiated and directed the archaeological dig at Tell Hesban, biblical Heshbon. The dig at Hesban eventually developed into the Madaba Plains Project, with excavations at Hesban, Umayri, and Jalul. Horn also dug at Tell Balatah, biblical Shechem, in the early 1960s. A prolific author, he authored some 800 books and articles. Horn died of lymphoma on November 28, 1993, in St. Helena, California, at the age of 85.

Tubunae in Mauretania

Tubunae is a Catholic titular see. The original diocese was in Mauretania Caesariensis, according to the "Gerachia cattolica", or in Numidia according to Battandier, "Annuaire pontifical catholique" (Paris, 1910), 345. The official list of the Roman Curia does not mention it. The confusion is explained by the fact that it was located at the boundary of the two provinces. 
Bocking, in his notes to the "Notitia dignitatum" (Bonn, 1839); 523, and Toulotte ("Greg. de l'Afrique chret., Mauretanies", Montreuil, 1894, p. 171), speak of two distinct cities, while Muller ("Notes to Ptolemy", IV, 12, ed. Didot, I, 611) admits only one. It was a "municipium" and also an important frontier post in command of a "praepositus limitis Tubuniensis". 
Augustine of Hippo and Alypius sojourned there as guests of Count Boniface (Ep. ccxx). In 479 Huneric exiled a large number of Catholics there. Its ruins, known as Tobna, are in the Department of Constantine, Algeria, at the gates of the Sahara, west of the Chott el-Hodna, the "Salinae Tubunenses" of the Romans. They are very extensive, for three successive towns occupied different sites, under the Romans, the Byzantines, and the Arabs. Besides the remains of the fortress, the most remarkable monument is a church now used as a mosque.
Bishops.
Three bishops of Tubunae are known. St. Nemesianus assisted at the Council of Carthage in 256. St. Cyprian often speaks of him in his letters, and we have a letter which he wrote to St. Cyprian in his own name and in the name of those who were condemned with him to the mines. An inscription testifies to his cult at Tixter in 360, and the "Roman Martyrology" mentions him on 10 September. Another bishop was Cresconius, who usurped the see after quitting the Bulla Regia, and assisted at the Council of Carthage in 411, where his rival was the Donatist Protasius. A third, Reparatus, was exiled by Huneric in 484.

Midori (operating system)

Midori is the code name for a managed code operating system being developed by Microsoft with joint effort of Microsoft Research. It has been reported to be a possible commercial implementation of the Singularity operating system, a research project started in 2003 to build a highly-dependable operating system in which the kernel, device drivers, and applications are all written in managed code. It was designed for concurrency, and can run a program spread across multiple nodes at once. It also features an entirely new security model that sandboxes applications for increased security. Microsoft has mapped out several possible migration paths from Windows to Midori.
The code name "Midori" was first discovered through the PowerPoint presentation "CHESS: A systematic testing tool for concurrent software".
A new reference to Midori was found in a presentation shown during the OOPSLA 2012 conference in October 2012.

Zenbu Media

Zenbu Media is a media company located in New York City, United States and founded by Steve Bernstein. While the word zenbu means "everything" in Japanese the company is focused on the music industry, sporting the slogan "we live for music." 
Print.
Zenbu Media formerly published Relix "Magazine" Global Rhythm "Magazine" "Metal Edge Magazine" and Metal Maniacs "Magazine". 
Relix Magazine.
Relix "Magazine" was founded in 1974 by Les Kippel as a newsletter focusing on The Grateful Dead. Originally the publication was called "Dead Relix" and was less than twenty pages thick with a hand-drawn black and white cover. By 1978 "Dead Relix" had dropped the word "Dead" from its title and expanded to include articles about the entire Bay Area psychedelic scene. From here the scope of "Relix" expanded to encompass a vast array of musical genres such as reggae and heavy metal. This caused the magazine to lose direction until it rallied behind its original focus on The Grateful Dead. However, "Relix" did not revert entirely to its old ways and managed to also cover various genres of music and even some non-music related issues. Soon after this transformation "Relix" became known as a magazine that broke acts, with many emerging bands making their debut in "Relix" columns such as "Independents Daze” and “On the Edge.”
After the passing of Jerry Garcia in 1995 "Relix" was forced to move away from its coverage of The Grateful Dead. Embracing change, it began to report on jambands and other genres of music not considered as mainstream. In 2000 the magazine was purchased by Steve Bernstein and in 2007 it entered the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Today, Relix covers a variety of jambands, indie rockers, singer-songwriters, and the live music scene in general. Also, each issue comes with a free CD sampling various up and coming bands. Bernstein sold "Relix" to Relix Media Group in 2009.
Global Rhythm Magazine.
Global Rhythm was founded in 2000 by Publisher, Alecia Cohen. In November 2005 "Global Rhythm" was acquired by Steve Bernstein who subsequently became publisher. Alecia Cohen remained on staff as associate publisher. Global Rhythm is a music and lifestyle magazine featuring coverage of world music, film, cuisine and travel. Published monthly and circulated across North America, Europe and hundreds of other locations worldwide, New York-based Global Rhythm is a vital source of music and arts news and reviews for a worldly and sophisticated consumer niche. Each issue of "Global Rhythm" incdlues a 15 track compilation CD.
Metal Edge.
"Metal Edge" was the longest running metal magazine in America. It was first published by Sterling Publishing in 1985 and was closed in 2009. Its founding editor was Gerri Miller.
Metal Maniacs.
Metal Maniacs covered heavy metal music and was founded in 1989 by Mike Greenhaus and Kathrine Ludwig. The magazine was focused on covering underground metal with an emphasis on the black and death metal genres. It was published by Sterling until Zenbu Media purchased it. "Metal Maniacs" was published ten times annually and every issue came with a free CD. It was closed in 2009.
Events.
Zenbu Media is in charge of two major events: The Jammys and the Green Apple Music & Arts Festival.
The Jammy Awards.
The Jammys is an award show geared towards jam bands but also including other live improvisational genres of music.
Green Apple Music Festival.
The Green Apple Music & Arts Festival (GAMAF) is America’s largest Earth Day celebration. Founded by music producer and former Wetlands Preserve club owner Peter Shapiro and Relix Magazine, the annual event features an eclectic array of musical performances in venues and rock clubs, as well as large-scale free public outdoor concerts. The Festival’s mission is to raise environmental awareness by combining live musical performances from diverse genres with educational outreach and cultural events suitable for all audiences. The festival is held around Earth Day, April 22, the world’s largest secular holiday observed by over a billion people each year.
In 2006, the event’s first year, the Green Apple Music & Arts Festival took place in New York City. A year later, the celebration had spread across the United States to over 60 live music venues featuring over 200 performances in New York, Chicago and San Francisco.
In 2008, continuing its partnership with Earth Day Network, Green Apple Music & Arts Festival will expand to additional U.S. cities including Miami, Washington D.C., Dallas and Denver.
“By featuring a diverse group of musicians and uniting these venues under one cause, we are able to coordinate an exciting, and unprecedented event. We hope the national footprint of the Festival will help inform as many people as possible on these important issues. And, we hope to keep expanding in future years. I think everyone would agree that Earth Day should be recognized in a big way every year.” -Peter Shapiro, Executive Producer

Proactive Cyber Defence

Proactive Cyber Defence or active cyber defence (ACD) means acting in anticipation to oppose an attack against computers and networks. Proactive cyber defence will most often require additional security from internet service providers.
Some of the reasons for a proactive defence strategy are about cost and choice. Making choices after an attack are difficult and costly. Proactive defence is key to mitigating operational risk.
History.
In the fifth century, B.C., Sun Tzu advocated "foreknowledge" or predictive analysis as part of a winning strategy. He warned that planners must have a precise understanding of the active threat and not "remain ignorant of the enemy's condition". The thread of proactive defence is spun throughout his teachings.
Psychiatrist Viktor Frankl was likely the first to use of the term proactive in his 1946 book "Man's Search for Meaning" to distinguish the act of taking responsibility for one's own circumstances rather than attributing one's condition to external factors.
Later in 1982, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) used "proactive" as a contrary concept to "reactive" in assessing risk. In the framework of risk management "proactive" meant taking initiative by acting rather than reacting to threat events. Conversely "reactive" measures respond to a stimulus or past events rather than predicting the event. In military science, then and now considers defence is the science-art of thwarting an attack. Furthermore doctrine poses that if a party attacks an enemy who is about to attack this could be called active-defence. Defence is also a euphemism for war but does not carry the negative connotation of an offensive war. Usage in this way has broadened the term to include most military issues including offensive, which is implicitly referred to as active-defence. Politically the concept of national self-defence to counter a war of aggression refers to a defensive war involving pre-emptive offensive strikes and is one possible criterion in the 'Just War Theory'. Proactive defence has moved beyond theory. It has been put into practice in theatres of operation.
In 1989 Stephen Covey's "The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People", published by Free Press, transformed the meaning "to act before a situation becomes a source of confrontation or crisis". Since then, "proactive" has been placed in opposition to the words "reactive" or "passive".
Origins.
Cyber is derived from "Cybernetics", a word originally coined by a group of scientists led by Norbert Wiener and made popular by Wiener's book of 1948, "Cybernetics or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine". Cyberspace typically refers to the vast and growing logical domain composed of public and private networks; independently managed networks linked together through the lingua franca of the Internet, the Internet Protocol (IP). The definition of Cyberspace has been extended to include all network-space which at some point, through some path, may have eventual access to the public internet. Under this definition, cyberspace becomes virtually every networked device in the world, which is not devoid of a network interface entirely. There is no air-gap anymore between networks.
The origins of cyber defence undoubtedly evolved from the original purpose of the Internet which was to harden military networks against the threat of a nuclear strike. Later cyber defence was coveted by the tenets of information warfare and information operations.
The rapid evolution of information warfare operations doctrine in the 1990s embraced a proactive preemptive cyber defence strategy.
Current status.
"Information Warfare is an emergent reality that comes from a self-organization process that has never seen before. The problem is that we talk about it using terms that have well known connotations. And it is difficult to talk about something completely new using words that bring with them specific understanding and expectancies. The early period of the automobile faced a similar situation. At one time it was called a "horseless carriage" as this was the only way to define its essential quality. The car is more than a carriage without a horse. This is the dilemma we face when we discuss Information Warfare. The danger is that the uses of familiar words misrepresent and mask the true extend of the revolution that will have to take place if we are to be able to retain a military capacity in a new physical, social and cognitive space." - Dr. Garigue, 1994.
The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace was published in February 2003 to outline an initial framework for both organizing and prioritizing efforts to secure the cyberspace. It highlighted the necessity for public private partnerships. Proactive threads include the call to deter malicious activity and prevent cyber attacks against America's critical infrastructures.
The notion of "proactive defence" has a rich history. The hype of "Proactive cyber defence" reached its zenith around 1994. This period was marked by intense "hype" discussions under the auspices of Information Warfare. Much of the current doctrine related to proactive cyber defence was fully developed by 1995. A number of programs were initiated then, and advanced to full operation by 2005 including those of hostile states. Meanwhile the public discussions diminished until the most recent resurgence in proactive cyber defence 2004-2008. Now most of the discussions around proactive defence in the literature are much less "proactive" than the earlier discussions in 1994 or existing operational programs. 'Proactive' is often used to hype marketing of security products or programs, in much the same way that "extreme" or "quality" adjectives have been misused.
The hype-cycle of discussion reached its peak in 1994. Present-day proactive cyber defence strategy was conceived within the context of the rich discussion that preceded it, existing doctrine and real proactive cyber defence programs that have evolved globally over the past decade. Robert John Garigue, a computational epistemologist and father of information warfare in Canada, published Information Warfare, Developing a Conceptual Framework. This was a landmark document in 1994 and genesis for proactive cyber defensive theory in Canada.
Proactive pre-emptive operations.
"Effective cyber defenses ideally prevent an incident from taking place. Any other approach is simply reactive. FedCIRC, the NIPC, the NSIRC, the Department of Defense and industry components realize that the best is a pre-emptive and proactive approach." - Sallie McDonald, the Assistant Commissioner for the Office Of Information Assurance and Critical Infrastructure Protection, Federal Technology Service and General Services Administration; in offering testimony about the National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC) and the Federal Computer Incident Response Center or FedCIRC; before The Subcommittee on Terrorism Technology and Government Information Committee on Judiciary and the United States Senate on July 25, 2001.
The notion of a Proactive Pre-emptive Operations Group (P2OG) emerged from a report of the Defense Science Board (DSB), 2002 briefing. The briefing was reported by Dan Dupont in Inside the Pentagon on September 26, 2002, and was also discussed by William M. Arkin in the "Los Angeles Times" on October 27, 2002. The "Los Angeles Times" has subsequently quoted U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld revealing the creation of the "Proactive, Pre-emptive Operations Group". The mission of the P2OG is reportedly to conduct Aggressive, Proactive, Pre-emptive Operations to interdiction and disruption the threat using: Psychological operations, Managed Information Dissemination, Precision Targeting, Information Warfare Operations, and SIGINT... The proactive defence strategy is meant to improves information collection by stimulating reactions of the threat agents, provide strike options and to enhance operational preparation of the real or virtual battle space. The P2OG has been recommended to be constituted of "one hundred 'highly specialized people with unique technical and intelligence skills such as information operations, PSYOPS, network attack, covert activities, SIGINT, HUMINT, SOF, influence warfare/deception operations and to report to the National Security Council with an annual budget of $100 million". The group would be overseen by the White House's deputy national security adviser and would carry out missions coordinated by the secretary of defense or the CIA director. "The proposal is the latest sign of a new assertiveness by the Defense Department in intelligence matters, and an indication that the cutting edge of intelligence reform is not to be found in Congress but behind closed doors in the Pentagon." - Steven Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists. DoD doctrinally would initiate a 'pre-emptive' attack on the basis of evidence that an enemy attack is imminent. Proactive measures, according to DoD are those actions taken directly against the preventive stage of an attack by the enemy.
Strike-back doctrine aligns with pre-emptive and counter-attack tactics of a proactive cyber defence strategy.

Lean Six Sigma

Lean Six Sigma is a managerial concept combining Lean and Six Sigma that results in the elimination of the eight kinds of wastes / "muda" (classified as Defects, Overproduction, Waiting, Non-Utilized Talent, Transportation, Inventory, Motion, Extra-Processing) and an improved capability of performance. The term Six Sigma is statistically based on the provision of goods and service at a rate of 3.4 defects per million opportunities (DPMO). A mnemonic for the wastes is "DOWNTIME."
The Lean Six Sigma concepts were first published in the book titled "Lean Six Sigma: Combining Six Sigma with Lean Speed" by Michael George and Peter Vincent in 2002. Lean Six Sigma utilises the DMAIC phases similar to that of Six Sigma. The Lean Six Sigma projects comprise the Lean's waste elimination projects and the Six Sigma projects based on the critical to quality characteristics. The DMAIC toolkit of Lean Six Sigma comprises all the Lean and Six Sigma tools. The training for Lean Six Sigma is provided through the belt based training system similar to that of Six Sigma. The belt personnel are designated as white belts, yellow belts, green belts, black belts and master black belts, similar to karate.
For each of these belt levels skill sets are available that describe which of the overall Lean Six Sigma tools are expected to be part at a certain Belt level. These skill sets provide a detailed description of the learning elements that a participant will have acquired after completing a training program. The level upon which these learning elements may be applied is also described. The skill sets reflects elements from Six Sigma, Lean and other process improvement methods like TOC (Theory of Constraints) and TPM (Total Productive Maintenance).
It seems very important to take into account in Lean Six Sigma projects also about automation. A rule of thumb coming from many years of application at GE is that the benefits of a Lean Sigma project come roughly 50% from organizational and layout modifications and 50% from digitization.

Leelai

Leelai () is a 2012 Tamil romantic comedy film directed by Andrew Louis and produced by Ramesh Babu. It stars débutantes Shiv Pandit and Manasi Parekh in lead roles along with Santhanam and Suhasini Raju in pivotal roles. The film which began in May 2008, opened after production delays on April 27, 2012 to positive reviews.
Production.
Andrew Louis met Ravichandran and narrated the script of "Leelai" and two months later he agreed to produce the film. The producer subsequently moved the film on to the hands of his brother, Ramesh Babu, under the subsidiary company 'R Films', which was also making Ravi Varman's "Moscowin Kavery" at the time. The director selected North Indian actor Shiv Pandit in the lead role after seeing him an advertisement for a mobile phone company, Airtel. After Pandit was signed on, he practised his Tamil dialogues by reading them repeatedly and understanding the emotions and punches. He also watched a lot of Tamil films to get attuned to the culture. The female lead in the film is played by Manasi Parekh who has been part of popular shows on Television such as Star One’s India Calling and Star Plus's Gulaal. A major portion of the film was shot in the popular software company 'HCL' (Chennai Office). The song "Oru Killi" was shot at the Maheshwar Fort in Madhya Pradesh, while the other songs were shot in Goa and Puducherry respectively.
The film ran into a legal battle over its title "Leelai" with another film claiming it as their own. Ravichandran eventually won the case, forcing the other film to change its title from "Leelai" to "Naan Aval Adhu". The film had been ready for release since 2010, with Shiv Pandit in between making his début in Hindi films with "Shaitan". The failure of Ramesh Babu's other production "Moscowin Kavery" starring Rahul Ravindran and Samantha, also became a factor behind the delay.
After two years of remaining complete but unreleased, the film was given a fresh lease of life after producer Ravichandran signed a deal to distribute "Billa II", dubbed in trade circles as the "hottest film of the year", and thus theatres have shown their support for his brother by giving "Leelai" a big release. Furthermore after the success of "Oru Kal Oru Kannadi", actor Santhanam's popularity heightened with several of his films being released around the same period such as "Kadhal Pisase" and "Vinayaga" to capitalize on his market reach.
Critical Reception.
"Leelai" opened on April 27, 2012 alongside another Tamil film "Aathi Narayana", and won predominantly positive reviews. Critics from Sify.com gave the film a positive review citing that ""Leelai" is an enjoyable romantic ride, laced with peppy music and good fun" adding that "the director has worked out the romantic situations and spun it around to make it entertaining". Behindwoods.com mentioned that "Leelai" is "a light hearted simple romantic tale...a decent family flick for the holiday season". Pavithra Srinivasan of Rediff.com noted that "it's a feel-good, simple, urban romance that has its funny moments and is worth a watch", and added that "Shiv Pandit and Manasi Parekh bring the urban Chennaiite alive - they are expressive, emote well, and nowhere do their lines sound jarring". Vivek Ramz of in.com rated the film 3/5 and noted that ""Leelai" is a watchable rom-com" and added "If you are game for urban romance, then "Leelai" is worth a watch for its simple yet realistic treatment with fun". Another critic gave the film three stars out of five, concluding ""Leelai" may have its drawbacks, yet it is feel-good, fun and engaging. Job well done Andrew Louis". Rohit Ramachandran of Nowrunning.com rated it 2.5/5 stating that "For the most part, Andrew Louis's "Leelai" is earnest in its narration and interested in its characters".
Release.
Despite positive reviews from the critics, the film managed to do average business at the box office mainly due to a complete lack of publicity and predominantly having new faces in the cast. The film also saw a delayed release due to production issues.
Soundtrack.
The music is composed by debutant Satish Chakravarthy, a classmate of the director, Andrew Vasanth Louis. Satish also wrote the lyrics for two of the songs. The soundtrack released on August 24, 2009, whilst the music composer later stated that he has also worked on a song for the theatrical trailer.

<doc id="18248654" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18248654" title="Oliver Farm Equipment Company">
Oliver Farm Equipment Company

The Oliver Farm Equipment Company was an American farm equipment manufacturer from the 20th century. It was formed as a result of a 1929 merger of four companies: the American Seeding Machine Company of Richmond, Indiana, Oliver Chilled Plow Works of South Bend, Indiana, Hart-Parr Tractor Company of Charles City, Iowa, and Nichols and Shepard Company of Battle Creek, Michigan
On November 1, 1960, the White Motor Corporation of Cleveland, Ohio purchased the Oliver Farm Equipment Company. 
The Merger.
Four companies joined forces on April 1, 1929. The Oliver Chilled Plow Company dated from 1855. Hart-Parr Tractor Company began operations in 1897, and the American Seeding Machine Company, dated back to 1848. Nichols and Shepard Company, likewise began operations in 1848.
By 1929, each of these companies had essentially outgrown its usefulness to the industry. For most of them, the market had some time earlier reached a saturation point. In some instances, their machines were badly dated and rapidly approaching obsolescence. For each of these companies to have attempted further activity on solo basis would almost have certainly been disastrous. By uniting their various and somewhat diverse product lines into a single company, Oliver Farm Equipment instantly became a virtual full-line manufacturer.
Companies merged to form Oliver Farm Equipment Company.
American Seeding Machine Company.
The American Seeding Machine Company was organized in 1903 from the a merger of seven different manufacturers of grain drills, corn planters and other "seeding machines." The leading corporate component among the seven merged companies was the Superior Drill Company of Springfield, Ohio. Accordingly, the American Seeding Machine Company established its corporate headquarters at Springfield in the facilities formerly operated by the Superior Drill Company. Other companies which formed the 1903 merger include P. P. Mast and Company (est. 1856), Hoosier Drill Company (est. 1857), the Empire Drill Company, and Bickford & Huffman. The Superior Drill Company named lived on for many years following the merger that created Oliver, in the "Oliver Superior" line of seeding drills and related equipment.
Oliver Chilled Plow Works.
The business called the Oliver Chilled Plow Works was established by James Oliver in 1853. James Oliver first settled in Mishawaka, Indiana in 1836 where he worked in a local foundry business. Later he bought into an already existing small foundry in South Bend, Indiana. Plows with cast iron bottoms and moldboards had been successfully used by farmers and planters in the eastern states of the United States since the time of Thomas Jefferson. However, in the sticky soils of North Dakota and various other portions of the Midwest, the cast iron plows would not "scour"; that is, the sticky soil would cling to the plow, disrupting the flow of soil over the plow's surface, making plowing impossible. Thus, when settlement of North America moved over the Allegheny Mountains into the Midwest, there was a real need for a new plow that would scour in the soils of the Midwest. To allow a cast iron bottom to scour in sticky soil, various methods of heat treating for creating a hardened surface on the metal plow bottom had been attempted. All of these processes failed because the hard surface created was very thin and would soon wear through to the soft iron under the heat-treated surface. James Oliver developed his sand casting process to include rapid chilling of the molten iron near the outside surface of the casting, which resulted in a bottom that had a thick hardened surface with far greater wearability than competing plow bottoms.
Another problem common to cast iron plow bottoms was the lack of soundness and uniformity in the metal's molecular structure, which meant that some cast iron bottoms would have soft spots in the hardened surface, reducing the wearability of the plow bottom. Improvements made by James Oliver to his casting process overcame this problem also. Consequently, on June 30, 1857, James Oliver obtained his first patent from the United States government for his chilled plow shares and in February 1869, he obtained another patent for his process. What Oliver accomplished by this invention is sometimes referred to as chill hardening, or simply chilling. The purpose of chilling, whether it be a plowpoint or a wheel for a railroad car, is to produce an extremely hard and durable exterior of the object. This is done by including "chills", pieces of metal, into the sand mold, such that when the molten iron is poured into the mould, the portion next to the chill cools rapidly, hardening in a way akin to quenching. This chilled area forms the exterior of the plowpoint. This metal cools more quickly than the metal which forms the other portion of the plowshare, and effectively becomes case hardened. Also, the vapors which arise as the molten metal comes in contract with the mould are expelled through a spout. Had these vapors been trapped in the mould, they would have caused impurities and would have weakened the plowpoint at the place where it should have been the hardest. To harden the plowpoints, Oliver arranged his moulding apparatus in such manner that the surface of the chill was in a position so that the melted metal first came into contact with the chill at the edge of the plowshare. This insured a hard plow cutting point.
Thus, James Oliver's chilled plow bottom became a practical success and on July 22, 1868, the Oliver's business was incorporated as the South Bend Iron Works. In 1871, the company sold 1,500 plows per year. By 1874 this figure had increased to 17,000 plows a year. At the time of death of James Oliver in 1908, the company had again changed names to the Oliver Chilled Plow Works. and their factory site in South Bend, Indiana covered with 25 of those acres under roof. Upon the death of his father in 1908, Joseph D. Oliver, the only son of James and Susan (Doty) Oliver took over the management of the Oliver Chilled Plow Works. By 1910, the company was manufacturing a wide variety of farm tillage implements in addition to the chilled plow. Production had reached the point that, in 1910, the company purchased over 40,000 tons of pig iron, alone.
Hart-Parr Gasoline Engine Company.
Charles Walter Hart was born at Charles City, Iowa in 1872. At the age of twenty, he transferred from Iowa State College of Agriculture and Mechanical Arts, to the University of Wisconsin–Madison. It was here that he met Charles H. Parr, and the two young men quickly
became friends. Together they worked on their Special Honours Thesis and from that thesis they built three working internal combustion engines right there on the campus at Madison.
Following their graduation from the University of Wisconsin in 1897, Hart and Parr gathered $3000 in capital and formed the Hart-Parr Gasoline Engine Company. Towards the end of 1899, Charles Hart paid a visit to his parents in Charles City, Iowa. He complained to his father that development funds could not be found for his tractor project. "There's money around here that might be interested," replied the elder Hart, admitting for the first time that his son's ambition was not folly. They then found another investor in Charles D. Ellis, a local attorney, who invested $50,000 in additional capital.
In 1900, as the engine business expanded, Hart and Parr decided to move their company from Madison to Charles City. Hart-Parr Company was organized on June 12, 1901 at Charles City, Iowa. Ground was broken for the new factory on July 5 that year. By the following December, the Hart-Parr Company was now ready to do business, and had an authorized capitalization of $100,000.00.
Hart-Parr number 1 was completed in 1902. Customers did not immediately beat the proverbial path. However, Hart-Parr was able to field one salesman to run demonstrations at county fairs and other events. Hart was patient. "We can't force it," he said. "We have to let it simmer into the market."
Little by little, the Hart-Parrs began to gather defenders. Some of the first tractors delivered were gaining a reputation of usefulness that far surpassed that of the steamers.
W.H. Williams, Sales Manager in 1906, decided the words "traction engine" were vague and too long to be used in press releases, so he coined the word "Tractor", a combination of the words traction and power, instead. For this reason, and because the Charles City plant was the first to be continuously and exclusively used for tractor production, Hart-Parr has been given the title of "Founders of the Tractor Industry".
Nichols and Shepard Company.
In 1848, John Nichols opened a blacksmith shop in Battle Creek, Michigan. In the blacksmith shop, John Nichols began making various farm tools for local farmers. He built his first thresher/separator in 1852. The business was successful from the start, so successful that some time in the 1850s he took on a partner by the name of David Shepard. Together they formed a partnership known as Nichols, Shepard and Company which manufactured farm machinery, steam engines and mill machinery. The first thresher/separator of small grains (largely wheat and oats) was developed in about 1831 by the Pitts brothers—Hiram and John Pitts of Buffalo, New York. However, this early thresher, called the "ground hog," was quite unlike the conventional thresher/separators that developed since that time. For instance, the ground hog's separating unit was largely a slatted apron which pulled the grain across a screen. John Nichols and David Shepard realized that the apron style separator was not a technology that was going to work. Consequently, in 1857, the Nichols and Shepard Company developed the first "vibrator" separating unit for the small grain thresher. This vibrator-style of separator soon became universally adopted by all other thresher/separator manufacturers. The Nichols and Shepard Company received a patent from the United States government for their "Vibrator" grain separator on January 7, 1862. The company also obtained a number of other patents for other advances in the thresher/separator technology, for original improvements in steam engine traction technology. During the 1920s, the Nichols and Shepard Company developed a successfully functioning corn picker. Following the acquisition of the Nichols and Shepard Company by the Oliver company. This corn picker became the direct ancestor of the famous Oliver cornpicker.
Acquisitions after the 1929 merger.
For the first couple of years, the tractors carried the Oliver-Hart-Parr designation, but the Hart-Parr essence soon disappeared, just as an entirely new line of purely Oliver tractors made their appearance.
McKenzie Manufacturing Company.
Following the 1929 merger of the four companies into the Oliver Farm Equipment Company, several other corporate acquisitions were made by the new company over a period of years. The first of these post-merger acquisitions occurred a mere year later, in 1930, when the Oliver Farm Equipment Company purchased the McKenzie Manufacturing Company of La Crosse, Wisconsin. The McKenzie Manufacturing Company was a leading maker of potato planting and potato harvesting equipment. Acquisition of the "McKenzie Company" broadened the line of farm equipment offered by Oliver to include potato diggers which were then sold under the "Oliver" name. However, following the 1930 merger production of the "Oliver" potato diggers moved out of La Crosse, Wisconsin to Chicago, Illinois.
Ann Arbor Agricultural Machine Company.
In 1943, the Oliver Farm Equipment Company purchased the Ann Arbor Agricultural Machine Company of Ann Arbor, Michigan. Founded in 1885, the Ann Arbor Agricultural Machine Company became the leading manufacturer of "hay presses" or stationary balers.
Cleveland Tractor Company.
The Cleveland Tractor Company became a part of the Oliver family in 1944. At the October 3, 1944 stockholders meeting, with approval of the stockholders, the corporate name was changed to "The Oliver Corporation". Crawler tractor production ended at Charles City in 1965.
A.B. Farquhar Company.
In 1952 the A.B. Farquhar Company was sold to the Oliver Corporation. Founded in York, Pennsylvania, in the 1850s as W.W. Dingee & Co, in 1861 young businessman Arthur Briggs Farquhar bought the business and enlarged it during the Civil War as the Pennsylvania Agricultural Works. In 1889, the A. B. Farquhar Company began building threshing machines and other farm machinery. Later, the company started the production of cultivators for farm use (especially potato harvesting equipment). Farquhar produced some steam engines early then moved onto the production of traction engines.
Product Development.
Crawlers.
In 1944 Oliver acquired the Cleveland Tractor Company (Cletrac). They continued production of the existing Cletrac HG model until 1951. The agricultural Cletrac HG gradually evolved into the more industrial Oliver OC-3 which was produced from 1951 through 1957.
In 1956 Oliver announced the slightly larger OC-4 with a four cylinder Hercules IXB3 engine. In late 1957 (diesel) and early 1958 (gas) OC-4's came equipped with 3 cylinder Hercules 130 engines. Most noticeable was the change to a 'beefier' more industrial front grill. In 1962 at the new Charles City, Iowa crawler production line, the last incarnation of the OC-4 was produced. It was a sturdier industrial model named the Series B. They were powered with the same 3 cylinder Hercules GO-130 and DD-130 engines of the mid-series models. The OC-4 product line was discontinued in 1965.
Oliver also produced larger crawlers:
the OC-6 from 1953 to 1960;
the OC-9 from 1959 to 1965;
the OC-12 from 1954 to 1961;
and the OC-15 and the large OC-18.
All crawler production was halted in 1965.
Tractors.
In 1948, Oliver was ready with an entirely new line of tractors. These were built over the successes of the past, including the Oliver 60, 70, and 80 tractors.
The latter was even built with a diesel engine, although very few were sold. However, in the 1950s, Oliver was an industry leader through their promotion of diesel power. Oliver led the industry in the sale of diesel tractor for several years.
The Oliver 66, 77 and 88 tractors of the 1948 to 1954 period, marked an entirely new series of Fleetline models. The 77 and 88 could be bought with either gasoline or diesel engines. During 1954, the company upgraded these tractors with the new "Super" series models, and added the Oliver Super 55. It was the company's first compact utility tractor.
In 1958, Oliver began marketing the new 660, 770, 880, 990, and other new models.
Non-Agricultural Products.
During the war years of the 1940s Oliver Corporation expanded rapidly into non-agricultural production, most notably in the defense sector. By 1947, the Oliver Corporation employed 9,000 with 37% of Oliver's production for defense contracts. Product lines included graders, forklifts, road rollers, crawlers, and power units incorporated into products by other companies.
Oliver also built airplane fuselages for Boeing's RB-47E Reconnaissance planes at a Battle Creek, Michigan aviation division set up exclusively for defense contracts. The Charles City, Iowa plant assembled transmissions for the 25-ton crane carriers and built and assembled 106MM recoilless rifle gun mounts for the Army. The Cleveland, Ohio plant built the MG-1 crawler for the Army as well as tank parts. The Gilroy, California plant produced the 76MM guns for the Walker Bull-Dog tank. The Shelbyville, Ohio plant built 155MM Howitzer gun parts.
Acquisition by White Motor Corporation.
White Motor Corporation of Cleveland, Ohio had a long history of truck manufacturing. On November 1, 1960, White Motor acquired Oliver, changed the name to Oliver Corporation, and made it a wholly owned, separately operating subsidiary of the White Motor Corporation.
White also acquired Cockshutt Farm Equipment of Canada in February, 1962, and it was made a subsidiary of Oliver Corporation. Cockshutt had also previously in 1928, marketed tractors made by Hart-Parr and again from 1934 through the late 1940s, marketed tractors made by Oliver, only changing the paint color to red, and changing the name tags to Cockshutt.
Minneapolis-Moline became a wholly owned subsidiary of White Motor Corporation in 1963. The Minneapolis-Moline line was blended into that of Oliver until there was virtually no difference between them.
In 1960, the new four-digit tractor models appeared. Among them were the 1600, 1800 and 1900 models. In 1969 White Motor Corporation formed White Farm Equipment Company, almost immediately after a transitional period when virtually identical tractors were marketed under different trade names. A few models were sold as Oliver, Minneapolis, or Cockshutt, the major difference being the paint colour. As the transaction continued, the White name was more and more applied to the tractor line, with the Oliver 2255, also known as the White 2255, being the last purely "Oliver" tractor. With the introduction of the White 4-150 Field Boss in 1974, the White name would be used, henceforth to the exclusion of all others.
White Motor Corporation shut down the original Oliver Chilled Plow Works factory (factory no. 1) in 1985. The Oliver buildings remained vacant until 2002 when most were demolished to make way for an industrial park. The Oliver powerhouse is now restored and occupied by Rose Brick & Material Rose Brick & Material.
FIAT tractors were marketed under the Oliver name in the mid 1970's, such as the Oliver 1465 tractor.

Lach dialects

The Lachian dialects (Lach dialects, , , not to be confused with the Lechitic language group), are a group of West Slavic dialects that form a transition between the Polish and Czech language. They are spoken in parts of Czech Silesia, the Hlučín Region, and northeastern Moravia, as well as in some adjacent villages in Poland. Most Czech researchers consider Lach a dialect of Czech, whereas Polish dialectologists tend to ascribe Polish origins to Lach.
Lachian, which is close to the Polish language, is divided into numerous subdialects (Western, Eastern and Southern), it can therefore also be regarded as a dialect continuum, with limited mutual intelligibility between the eastern and western dialects. This dialectal differentiation is not typical for the Czech Republic, where there is a good deal of dialect leveling, especially in the west of the republic.
Most Lachs, especially younger speakers, now speak Czech, and use it as a written language, while Lach remains the language of everyday speech. Lachian contains many German loanwords, according to some sources, up to 8% of the vocabulary.
The poet Óndra Łysohorsky is probably the best-known writer in a Lachian dialect. Łysohorsky was notable for refusing to write in Czech, instead writing in the local dialect of Upper Silesia. In doing so, he helped contribute greatly to the development of the Lach literary language.

List of people indicted in the International Criminal Court

The list of people who have been indicted in the International Criminal Court includes all individuals who have been indicted on any counts of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, or contempt of court in the International Criminal Court (ICC) pursuant to the Rome Statute. An individual is indicted when a Pre-Trial Chamber issues either an arrest warrant or a summons after it finds that "there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person has committed a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court". An arrest warrant is issued where it appears necessary "to ensure the person's appearance at trial, to ensure that the person does not obstruct or endanger the investigation or the court proceedings, or, where applicable, to prevent the person from continuing with the commission of that crime or a related crime which is within the jurisdiction of the Court and which arises out of the same circumstances". The Pre-Trial Chamber issues a summons if it is satisfied that a summons is sufficient to ensure the person's appearance. Individuals can only be charged with genocide, crimes against humanity, or war crimes. Although mentioned in the Statute, the Court cannot currently prosecute individuals for the crime of aggression. While this crime has been defined at the Review Conference of the Rome Statute in 2010, the conditions for the ICC to exercise jurisdiction are not yet fulfilled. 
Overview.
To date, the ICC has opened investigations into eight situations (shown in the table below under the column titled S) in: the Democratic Republic of the Congo (1); Uganda (2); the Central African Republic (3); Darfur, Sudan (4); the Republic of Kenya (5); Libya (6); the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire (7); and the Republic of Mali (8).

Ali was alleged to be criminally responsible for murders, deportations, rapes and other forms of sexual violence, persecutions, and other inhumane acts perpetrated by Mungiki against civilians who were perceived to be loyal to the Orange Democratic Movement (the political party of President Kibaki's rival) in the towns of Kibera, Kisumu, Naivasha, and Nakuru. Ali was summoned to appear before the Court on 8 April 2011 and the confirmation of charges hearing was held from 21 September 2011 to 5 October 2011, in conjunction with the cases against Muthaura and Uhuru Kenyatta.

Abdallah Banda.
Abdallah Banda was indicted on 27 August 2009 on three counts of war crimes with regard to the situation in Darfur, Sudan. Banda is alleged to have been a commander of a splinter group of the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), a rebel group fighting in the Darfur conflict against the Sudanese government. He is accused of leading JEM forces under his command (in conjunction with other rebel forces) in a raid on the Haskanita base of the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) on 29 September 2007, in which 12 AMIS peacekeepers were killed and eight were seriously injured; the base was also extensively damaged. Banda is accused of ordering murders, pillaging, and "intentionally directing attacks against personnel, installations, materials, units and vehicles involved in a peacekeeping mission". Banda was summoned to appear before the Court on 17 June 2010 and the confirmation of charges hearing was held on 8 December 2010, in conjunction with the case against Saleh Jerbo.

The Prosecutor alleges that from 20 May to 25 July 2013 in Kampala, Uganda, Barasa persuaded or attempted to persuade three protected witnesses to withdraw their cooperation to the prosecution. Specifically, he offered one witness between 1,000,000 and 1,500,000 Kenyan shillings, a second witness 1,400,000 shillings, and a third witness an inducement to meet with an intermediary "for the purpose of offering her a bribe". Barasa is currently in Kenya, where the government initiated extraditions proceedings against him. In January 2014, the High Court of Kenya ruled that he can be extradited, but he is currently appealing the ruling.
Omar al-Bashir.
Omar al-Bashir was indicted on 4 March 2009 on five counts of crimes against humanity and two counts of war crimes with regard to the situation in Darfur, Sudan. On 12 July 2010 he was additionally charged with three counts of genocide. During the Darfur conflict (specifically from April 2003 to 14 July 2008), al-Bashir, from his position as President of Sudan, is accused of implementing a government policy that used the state apparatus (the military, police, security, and Janjaweed forces) to attack Fur, Masalit, and Zaghawa populations that were perceived to be sympathetic to rebel groups. Al-Bashir is accused of ordering the rape, murder, extermination, forcible transfer, and torture of civilians, as well as the pillaging of numerous villages and camps. Additionally, he is accused of intending to partially destroy the Fur, Masalit, and Zaghawa ethnic groups by killings, "causing serious bodily or mental harm", and "deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about physical destruction" of the ethnic groups. The Court has issued two arrest warrants for al-Bashir and he is currently a fugitive openly living in Sudan, where he serves as President. As such Sudanese state policy has been not to cooperate with the Court. Since the warrants have been issued, al-Bashir has traveled to several other countries and has not been arrested. Among the counties he traveled to include Chad, Kenya, Djibouti, and Malawi which are states parties to the Rome Statute, and were therefore obligated to have arrested him. On 26 March 2013, Pre-Trial Chamber II made a finding that Chad had failed to cooperate with the Court and therefore referred the non-compliance to the Security Council. On 5 September 2013, however, Pre-Trial Chamber II found that a similar visit to Nigeria did not constitute non-compliance, but it requested Nigeria "to immediately arrest Omar Al Bashir and surrender him to the Court should a similar situation arise in the future".

Francis Muthaura was indicted on 8 March 2011 with five counts of crimes against humanity with regard to the situation in the Republic of Kenya. As the Head of the Public Service, Secretary to the Cabinet, and Chairman of the National Security and Advisory Committee of Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki, he is alleged to have planned, financed, and coordinated the violent response against the perceived supporters of the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), the political party of the President's rival, during post-election violence from 27 December 2007 to 29 February 2008. Specifically, Muthaura is alleged to have directed and paid Mungiki forces loyal to the President to attack civilians and instructed Mohammed Ali, the Commissioner of the Kenya Police, not to intervene against Mungiki forces. Muthaura is allegedly criminally responsible for murders, deportations, rapes and other forms of sexual violence, persecutions, and other inhumane acts perpetrated by Mungiki forces against civilians who were perceived to be loyal to the ODM in the towns of Kibera, Kisumu, Naivasha, and Nakuru. Muthaura was summoned to appeared before the Court on 8 April 2011 and the confirmation of charges hearing was held from 21 September 2011 to 5 October 2011, in conjunction with the cases against Mohammed Ali and Uhuru Kenyatta. On 11 March 2013, the Prosecutor announced that her office would withdraw all charges against Muthaura, citing a lack of cooperation from the Kenyan government, the death and killing of witnesses, and the recantation of testimony by a key witness who was bribed by agents of the accused. On 18 March 2013, the Trial Chamber granted the Prosecutor permission to withdraw the charges and terminated all proceedings against Muthaura.
Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui.
Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui was indicted on 6 July 2007 on three counts of crimes against humanity and six counts of war crimes with regard to the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). He was alleged to have been the commander of the Nationalist and Integrationist Front (FNI), an armed group involved in the Ituri conflict. On and around 23 February 2003, he was alleged to have led his forces into the village of Bogoro and ordered them to indiscriminately attack its civilian population in coordination with another armed group, the Front for Patriotic Resistance in Ituri (FRPI). The attack resulted in 200 civilian deaths. Ngudjolo Chui was accused of ordering his forces to attack, murder, sexually enslave, and inhumanely treat civilians in and around Bogoro. He was also accused being criminally responsible for destroying property, pillaging the village, and using children to participate in the attack. After the Court issued an arrest warrant, Ngudjolo Chui was detained on 6 February 2008 by Congolese authorities and transferred to the Court the next day. He first appeared before the Court on 11 February 2008 and on 10 March 2008 the case against him was joined with the case against Germain Katanga. The confirmation of charges hearing was held from 27 June 2008 to 18 July 2008 and on 26 September 2008. His trial began on 24 November 2009. On 18 December 2012, Trial Chamber II acquitted Ngudjolo Chui.
Bosco Ntaganda.
Bosco Ntaganda was indicted on 22 August 2006 on three counts of war crimes with regard to the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). On 13 July 2012 he was additionally charged with three counts of crimes against humanity and four counts of war crimes. He is alleged to be a third highest-ranking official in the Patriotic Force for the Liberation of the Congo (FPLC), the armed wing of the Union of Congolese Patriots (UCP), a rebel movement in the northeast part of the DRC, that fought in the Ituri conflict. From July 2002 to December 2003, Ntaganda is alleged to have ordered FPLC troops to conscript and enlist children to the FPLC and UCP, and of using them "to participate actively in hostilities". He is also alleged to have ordered attacks on Lendu and other non-Hema civilian populations in the town of Mongbwalu and the villages of Bambu, Kobu, Lipri, and Sayo, and the surrounding areas, from 1 September 2002 until 30 September 2003. In the course of the attacks, murders, rapes, and other forms of sexual violence were allegedly committed and homes were pillaged, resulting in the death of approximately 800 civilians and the displacement of 60,000.
The Congolese government refused to arrest him and in 2009 Ntaganda became a general in the armed forces in the city of Goma in North Kivu province. In April 2012 he and his troops defected from the military and left Goma to form the March 23 Movement, an armed group that began attacking villages and towns around Goma. Ntaganda was an alleged leader of the group and since his defection the Congolese government announced its intentions to arrest him. On 18 March 2013, following reports of clashes between factions of the March 23 Movement, Ntaganda fled to Rwanda and entered the Embassy of the United States in Kigali. He requested that the United States facilitate his surrender the Court. On 22 March, the ICC took custody of Ntaganda and transferred him to The Hague. His first appearance before the Court took place on 26 March 2013.
Okot Odhiambo.
Okot Odhiambo was indicted on 8 July 2005 on three counts of crimes against humanity and seven counts of war crimes in regard to the situation in Uganda. He is alleged to be an integral member of the policy-making leadership of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), an armed group which has been wagging a guerrilla campaign since 1987 against the Ugandan government. Additionally, he was also a military commander and sometime after 1 July 2002 (the date the Rome Statute entered into force) he allegedly issued "standing orders to attack and brutalise civilian populations". These attacks on civilian populations allegedly resulted in murder, pillaging of camps, enslavement, and the forcible conscription of children. In 2014, an LRA defector claimed that the Ugandan military wounded Odhiambo in October 2013 during an ambush in the Central African Republic and that he later died from his injuries. This claim has not been confirmed and Odhiambo is still considered to be at large as a fugitive.
Dominic Ongwen.
Dominic Ongwen was indicted on 8 July 2005 on three counts of crimes against humanity and four counts of war crimes in regard to the situation in Uganda. He is allegedly a military commander and a member of the leadership of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), an armed group which has been wagging a guerrilla campaign since 1987 against the Ugandan government. Sometime after 1 July 2002 (the date the Rome Statute entered into force) he allegedly issued orders to his forces to attack civilian populations which resulted in pillaging, murder, enslavement, cruel treatment, and other inhumane acts. Ongwen is currently a fugitive and is believed to be in the Central African Republic, where in August to September 2012 he was wounded, but escaped, after an armed encounter with the Uganda People's Defence Force.
Vincent Otti.
Vincent Otti was indicted on 8 July 2005 on 11 counts of crimes against humanity and 21 counts of war crimes in regard to the situation in Uganda. He was allegedly a military commander and the second-in-command of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), an armed group which has been wagging a guerrilla campaign since 1987 against the Ugandan government. Sometime after 1 July 2002 (the date the Rome Statute entered into force) he allegedly issued orders to attack civilian populations. These attacks allegedly resulted in sexual enslavement, rape, forcible conscription of children into the LRA, enslavement, cruel treatment, murders, pillaging of camps, and other inhumane acts. In December 2007, BBC News reported that on 2 October 2007 Otti had been executed on orders from Joseph Kony, the commander-in-chief of the LRA. Kony later confirmed that Otti was dead to Riek Machar, a mediator between the Ugandan government and the LRA. Because Otti's death has not been independently verified, the Court still considers him to be at large as a fugitive and proceedings against him are ongoing.
William Ruto.
William Ruto is the current Deputy President of the Republic of Kenya. He was indicted on 8 March 2011 on four counts of crimes against humanity with regard to the situation in the Republic of Kenya. He is alleged to be the leader of an "ad hoc" organization created by members of the Kalenjin ethnic group which was created to perpetrate violence on behalf of the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), the political party of presidential candidate Raila Odinga, during post-election violence in December 2007 and January 2008. On 1 August 2011, the charges were reduced to three counts. Ruto, as the a top leader in the "ad hoc" Kalenjin organization, directed Kalenjin youths to target civilians of the Kikuyu, Kamba, and Kisii ethnic groups, which were perceived to be supporters of the Party of National Unity, the political party of Odinga's opponent during the election. Ruto is alleged to be criminally responsible for the murder, deportation, torture, and persecution of civilians in the towns of Kapsabet, Nandi Hills, Turbo, the greater Eldoret area. Ruto first appeared before the Court, voluntarily, on 7 April 2011 and through the confirmation of charges hearing, which was held in conjunction with the cases against Henry Kosgey and Joshua Sang. All the charges against Ruto were confirmed by Pre-Trial Chamber II on 23 January 2012 Ruto's trial began on 10 September 2013, in conjunction with the case against Joshua Sang, and is ongoing. On 5 September 2012 he was extradited to Libya. On 11 October 2013, Pre-Trial Chamber I decided that the case against Senussi was inadmissible before the ICC because of ongoing proceedings against him Libya. This decision is subject to appeal.

Michael McGinnis

James Michael McGinnis (12 July 1944 – ) is a physician, epidemiologist, and long-time contributor to national and international health programs and policy, including continuous policy responsibilities for leadership in disease prevention and health promotion through four Administrations (Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton). An elected member of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, he currently also serves as IOM Senior Scholar, as well as Executive Director of its Roundtable on Value & Science-Driven Health Care.
Early years.
Born in Columbia, Missouri in 1944, McGinnis moved to California in 1949 when his father was sent by his employer, a manufacturer of power line equipment, to help open a west coast office in San Francisco. He attended public schools for K-12 in San Mateo, but from ages 9 to 17, his summers were spent back in Missouri, working on his maternal grandfather’s corn, wheat and soy bean farm in central Missouri. Active in student government from an early age, he continued those interests as a pre-med undergraduate at the University of California at Berkeley, serving as the president of his graduating class.
Education and professional training.
During his undergraduate years at U.C. Berkeley, he created the Cal in the Capital internship program, which sends Berkeley students to Washington, DC, every summer to work in Congress, federal agencies, think tanks, and voluntary organizations. This competitive program still thrives 50 years later, sending over 75 students to DC every summer. McGinnis graduated from Berkeley in 1966 with a BA in political science (political theory), and then attended UCLA, receiving both an MA in political science (international relations) and an MD in 1971. He later went on to study public policy at the Kennedy School at Harvard University, receiving an MPP in 1977. He was class commencement speaker for all three of his university graduating classes: Berkeley, UCLA Medical, and the Kennedy School at Harvard. After an internship in internal medicine at the Boston City Hospital, McGinnis completed a residency in preventive medicine while serving in the U.S. Public Health Service in 1972 as an international medical officer.
International contributions.
As part of his graduate studies in international relations, McGinnis spent time in residency at the World Health Organization offices in Lausanne and Geneva, exploring the diplomatic dynamics at the formation of the organization and the role it played in using its practical humanitarian mission to forge collaborative activities among often competing nations. When the time came for McGinnis to serve his military obligation, he joined the U.S. Public Health Service in 1972 as an international medical officer, serving as a coordinator for U.S.-Eastern European health programs. In 1974, he was recruited by DA Henderson to join the World Health Organization's smallpox eradication program in India. Working initially as a field epidemiologist tracking and containing reported cases, McGinnis assumed responsibility as WHO's State Coordinator for the eradication program in Uttar Pradesh, India's largest state, and oversaw the completion of the eradication effort and the implementation of the surveillance system for the maintenance phase of the program.
Returning to the United States after the end of smallpox, McGinnis shifted his focus for the next two decades to domestic health policy (see below), but from 1995 to 1996, again at the request of the World Health Organization, he became chair of the World Bank/European Commission Sectoral Task Force on Health and Human Services in Bosnia. This was one of several task forces established to manage support for postwar reconstruction of the basic infrastructure, economic, and human service capabilities in the war-torn region. Under McGinnis’ leadership, the Task Force developed the first bilateral agreement outside of the Dayton Accords, forging consensus on primary care reconstruction priorities by the health ministries of both the Republica Srpska and Bosnia & Herzegovina.
Health determinants.
The contribution for which McGinnis is best personally known is improving understanding and insights into the basic determinants of health. His 1993 paper in the Journal of the American Medical Association, “Actual Causes of Death” co-authored with William Foege, focused attention on the root causes of the nation’s leading killers and underscored the preventability of many of the nation’s leading health threats. Building on a growing evidence base linking lifestyle, environment, and behavior to health, the McGinnis and Foege article pointed out that the conditions holding leading positions on mortality tables—e.g. heart disease, cancer, stroke, injury, diabetes—were in fact caused substantially by factors such as tobacco, diet and activity patterns, alcohol, toxic agents, and other potentially controllable sources. They identified nine leading preventable root causes of death, and calculated that the behavior-related factors on the list alone accounted for about 40% of deaths in the United States.  
McGinnis extended his work to reframe the notion of health, from a view that is disease-centric to one that captures more broadly the full range of factors that lead to disease and early death—or to good health. Drawing from the work on actual causes, as well as a developing evidence base on the influence of stress, class distinctions, socio-economic status, and genetics, he organized his assessment around the perspective that health is fundamentally shaped by determinants that fall within five domains: genetic predispositions, social circumstances, physical environments, behavioral choices, and medical care. Underscoring that the most important dynamics occur at the intersections of the determinant domains, his 2002 paper in Health Affairs, “The Case for More Active Policy Attention to Health Promotion”, co-authored with Pamela Russo and James Knickman, summarized quantitative assessments of the relative contributions of each of these five domains to the overall burden of early death in the population. As noted in the paper’s title, the most notable policy asynchrony they pointed out was that, while only 10 to 15% of premature deaths could be avoided through improvements in health care, 95% of aggregate national spending on health goes to medical care services.  
The Healthy People program.
In 1977, McGinnis was a Fellow at Harvard Medical School’s Center for Community Health and Medical Care when he accepted an offer from the newly appointed Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare Joseph Califano to return to Washington to work in the Carter Administration. He was appointed Deputy Assistant Secretary for Health in the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare (now Department of Health and Human Services), and served through four Administrations—Presidents Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and William J. Clinton—while also serving as Assistant Surgeon General and Director of the U.S. Office of Disease Prevention. 
During this period, McGinnis chaired the Secretary’s Task Force on Smoking and Health, which resulted in Secretary Califano's 1974 decision to elevate the federal leadership profile on tobacco control; led the development of Healthy People, the nation's prevention agenda; developed, with USDA, the first Dietary Guidelines for Americans; and created the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force in 1984 to develop an ongoing systematic and comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of clinical preventive services, thereby helping to pioneer the broader advance of evidence-based medicine.
Healthy People is perhaps the most widely known of McGinnis’ policy contributions. Begun when he was serving as Chair of the Secretary’s Task Force on Disease Prevention and Health Promotion for HEW Secretary Joseph Califano and Surgeon General Julius Richmond in 1978, it started as an effort to develop a Surgeon General’s report to serve as a U.S. answer to A New Perspective on the Health of Canadians, a groundbreaking report released in 1974 by Canadian Minister of Health Marc Lalonde. 
McGinnis felt the U.S. report could go beyond simply marshaling the scientific evidence underpinning the power of prevention, to establish quantifiable, evidence-based goals for improving the health of Americans through preventive interventions. This strategy reflected McGinnis' experience in India with the successful eradication of smallpox, which used quantified targets to drive focus and the deployment of resources. Published in 1979, "Healthy People: The Surgeon General's Report on Health Promotion and Disease Prevention" included the first-ever measurable, decade-long goals for reducing death rates for Americans by 1990 at each of the major life stages: reducing infant mortality by 35%, childhood mortality by 20%, adolescent and young adult mortality by 20%, and adult mortality by 25%. For older adults, the goal was to reduce the average number of sick days by 20% over the decade. 
McGinnis also launched a parallel effort involving each of the agencies of the U.S. Public Health Service (National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control, Food and Drug Administration, Indian Health Service, Health Resources and Services Administration, and Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration), in cooperative work with non-governmental experts from around the country to develop measurable 1990 objectives in 15 priority areas within the three prevention domains: health promotion, health protection, and clinical preventive services. These objectives targeted improvements on issues such as tobacco use, environmental quality, and high blood pressure control, child passenger restraints, occupational health, and environmental quality deemed necessary to achieve the national goals. The objectives were released in 1980 in Promoting Health/Preventing Disease: Objectives for the Nation. 
A broad range of stakeholders rallied around the newly-minted national prevention agenda, including through the Healthy People Consortium, which brought states, major cities, and voluntary national organizations together to adopt and tailor these national objectives to their particular needs and priorities. When the 1990 results came in, progress toward better health was on or close to the stated goals in each case: a 35% reduction in infant mortality, a 25% reduction in child deaths, a 12% reduction for adolescent and young adult deaths, a 25% lower adult death rate, and 17% fewer days of disability for older adults. The Healthy People process continues today, building on national goals and objectives over more than three decades through Healthy People 2000, Healthy People 2010, and the current objectives, Healthy People 2020. A number of other countries have since developed similar efforts, and related work in the U.S. led to the development of a high priority set of national Leading Health Indicators, the pilot work group for which was chaired by McGinnis as part of the Healthy People 2010 process.
Other U.S. policy initiatives.
Other programs and policies launched by McGinnis include: the first HHS/USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans, now in its seventh edition; the first Surgeon General's Report on Nutrition and Health (1988); and the work of the Public Health Functions Steering Committee to develop the 10 Essential Services of Public Health. The latter initiative was an outgrowth of the town hall meetings he co-hosted in 1994 with the health commissioners in each of the 50 state capitals for public discussions on the importance of public health as a component of health reform. 
McGinnis also initiated: the National Coordinating Committee on Worksite Health Promotion (1979–1987) to catalyze employer commitment to healthier workforces, the National Coordinating Committee on School Health (co-chaired by HHS, the Department of Education and USDA), and the Panel on Cost Effectiveness in Health and Medicine, which developed guidelines for the conduct of economic analyses of the returns to health investments. 
From 1999 to 2005, McGinnis served as Senior Vice President and founding Director of the Health Group, and as Counselor to the President of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF). At RWJF, his charge was to build the Foundation’s contribution to the development of national leadership and capacity for a stronger focus on population health. Hallmarks of this work include the launch of the RWJF Active Living family of programs, the Health & Society Scholars Program, and the Young Epidemiology Scholars Program. Along with RWJF's flagship work in tobacco control, The Active Living Programs represented the first major national health promotion initiative focused on design, engineering, and policy strategies to re-engineer physical activity back into peoples’ living and working environments. 
The RWJF Health & Society Scholars Program was created to train a generation of extraordinary interdisciplinary scientific and policy experts to lead understanding and action at the intersections of the domains determining health prospects—genetics, social circumstances, physical environments, behavioral choices, and medical care. The RWJF Young Epidemiology Scholars Program was a competitive regional and national program to engage high school students in innovative project work in epidemiology—the basic science of public health, modeled on the prizes established by the Westinghouse and Intel corporations to encourage student interest and initiative in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology.
The IOM Learning Health System Initiative.
Since 2005, McGinnis has served as IOM senior scholar and executive director of the Roundtable on Value & Science-Driven Health Care. He founded and stewards the IOM’s initiative to accelerate the evolution of a continuously learning health system, described in the Roundtable’s Charter as one “in which science, informatics, incentives, and culture are aligned for continuous improvement and innovation, with best practices seamlessly embedded in the delivery process and new knowledge captured as an integral by-product of the delivery experience.” Motivated by rapid changes in the complexity and costs of care, shortfalls in its performance, and newly-emerging digitally-based tools to address these challenges, the initiative focuses both on improving awareness of the possible and on stimulating activities to capture it. The work to improve understanding is being undertaken through the Roundtable’s Learning Health System Series of publications exploring in detail the prospects and strategies in areas ranging from research and the clinical data utility to shared decision-making and care culture. On the action front, the Roundtable has developed the concept of Innovation Collaboratives, in which the good offices of The National Academies serve to steward cooperative projects requiring a trusted scientific forum to accelerate progress aimed at transformational change in the value, science, and culture of health and health care. Currently, the Roundtable steward about two dozen projects across six collaboratives: Best Practices (health professions societies), Clinical Effectiveness Research (clinical research organizations), Evidence Communication (marketing community), Digital Learning (IT community), Systems Approaches (operations engineers), and Value Incentives (payers and employers).  
Voluntary service and recognitions.
McGinnis has served on various national committees and boards, including the National Academies IOM Committee on Children's Food Marketing (chair), the NIH State-of-the-Science Conference on Multivitamins in Chronic Disease Prevention (chair), and the Health Professionals Roundtable on Preventive Services (chair), the National Governors Association Commission on Childhood Obesity (co-chair), the Board of Directors of the Nemours Foundation, and the Partnership for Prevention (chair, policy committee). He previously served on the NAS Board on Agriculture, Health and the Environment; the NAS Food and Nutrition Board; the Institute of Medicine’s Roundtable on Health and the Environment; the HHS Nutrition Policy Board (chair); the HHS Working Group on Leading Health Indicators (chair); the HHS Task Force on Health Risk Assessment (chair); the National Coordinating Committee on Clinical Preventive Services (chair); and the Armed Forces Epidemiological Board. 
McGinnis is an elected member of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, Fellow of the American College of Epidemiology and Fellow of the American College of Preventive Medicine. McGinnis' recognitions for his contributions to society include the Wilbur Cohen Award, the Porter Prize, the Distinguished Service Medal of the U.S. Public Health Service, the National Health Leader of the Year Award, and the Public Health Hero Award.

Jean-Baptiste de Mirabaud

Jean-Baptiste de Mirabaud (1675, Paris – 24 June 1760, Paris) was a French writer and translator.
His life and work.
He studied with the Oratorians and fought at the battle of Steenkerque in 1692. A friend of Jean de La Fontaine, he wrote various works of literature, history and philosophy, but failed to publish them. The Duchess of Orléans (1677-1749) made him her secretary and put him in charge of her two daughters' educations. In 1724, he published a translation of "Jerusalem Delivered" by Torquato Tasso, which brought him much admiration and led to his election two years later to the Académie française. In 1741, his translation of "Orlando Furioso" by Ludovico Ariosto had a more mixed reception. Becoming secrétaire perpétuel to the Académie in 1742, he left this post in 1755 when he felt age no longer allowed him to carry it out.
The name of Mirabaud remains associated with that of Baron d'Holbach, who had his "Système de la Nature" published under Jean-Baptiste Mirabaud's name in 1770. Voltaire, who violently condemned the Baron's work, denounced the deception thus" "Alas! our good Mirabaud was not capable of writing a single page of the book of our redoutable adversary." » 
On his death in 1760, Buffon gave him a glowing homage : "Mirabaud always joined feeling to esprit, and we liked to read him just as we liked to hear him ; but he had so little attachment to what he produced, he so feared the noise and glare, that he sacrificed those which could contribute most to his glory . »

Benchō

, is considered the second patriarch of the main Chinzei branch of the Jōdo-shū sect of Japanese Buddhism, after Hōnen. He is often called by another name: "Shōkōbō Benchō" (聖光房弁長) or just "Shōkō". According to biographies, he first ordained as a priest of the Tendai sect at the age of fourteen, and entered Enryaku-ji temple in 1183. He first met Hōnen in 1197. Later, after Hōnen and many of his followers were exiled in 1207, Shōkō was exiled on the island of Kyūshū and taught the practice of the nembutsu there.
Unlike other disciples of Hōnen, Shōkō favored studying the more traditional Buddhist paths along with the Pure Land path. He also criticized the interpretations by other disciples of Hōnen, particularly Kōsai and Shōkū, who emphasized the nembutsu over other practices. However, unlike Chōsai, his teachings still emphasized repeated recitations of the nembutsu as the primary practice in Jōdo-shū. In the spectrum of followers of Hōnen, Benchō balances faith in the nembutsu with acceptance of other practices leading to rebirth in the Pure Land of Amida Buddha.
After Hōnen died, Benchō attempted to counter divergences in Hōnen's teachings among other disciples by writing a treatise titled , which contained a full account of the teachings that Benchō heard directly from Hōnen. He also wrote "The Way of Practice for Birth by the Nembutsu" ("nembutsu ojo shugyomon") to counter teachings from other disciples of Hōnen, particularly Kōsai and the "single-nembutsu" movement.
Benchō died in 1238 and was succeeded by the third patriarch, Ryōchū (良忠, 1199–1287), who formally established Chinzei branch.

<doc id="18248787" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18248787" title="Fingerweaving">
Fingerweaving

Fingerweaving is a Native American art form used mostly to create belts, sashes, straps, and other similar items through a non-loom weaving process. Unlike loom-based weaving, there is no separation between weft and warp strands, with all strands playing both roles.
North and Central American Fingerweaving.
Some patterns and color combinations were originally restricted to certain societies or clans, while others were available for general use by all. Belts, sashes, leg bands, capes, gun straps, even dresses, shirts, and pants were created by the sometimes intricate patterns and methods. Often beads or feathers were interwoven into the patterns of the articles.
The French Voyagers (fur traders in the northern US and southern Canada) adapted the finger weaving patterns to create belts and sashes which showed which company they belonged to. The belts were the original weight belts, as they added extra support to their stomachs when they were lifting heavy canoes or packets of beaver pelts, which sometimes weighed up to 600 lbs.
The Spanish conquistadors used fingerwoven sashes to proclaim which command they were in, as well as to record their conquests over the Native Americans.
South American Fingerweaving.
Although South American styles shared much in common with those from North America, some differences are reliably observable. In addition to many of the specific weaves from the north, additional styles were created by using multiple weft strands at a time.
Basic Weaves.
The most basic weave is called a diagonal weave, as it creates a series of parallel lines running down the length of the weave at a diagonal. Whether one weaves from left to right or from right to left does not matter, as the pattern is the same; however, the direction must stay the same or the pattern will change.
As with loom weaving, one starts with an even number of warp strands, but with "no weft strand". Divide the warp strands into two groups, a top and bottom row. Take the top left (or top right) strand, and run it between the top and bottom rows, turning it into a weft. Reverse the position of each warp strand (from top to bottom or bottom to top), making sure to keep all strands in the same order and placement to form a single interlocked row.
For the second row, take the new top left (or top right) warp strand, and tuck it between the top and bottom, forming a new weft strand. Again, interlink the top and bottom rows, making sure to use the old weft strand from row #1. Continue this process until the desired length is completed.
Other common but more difficult patterns include those of lightning bolts, arrowheads, and chevrons. By making slight changes to the weaving process, a wide variety of unique patterns can be created.

Fort Bridger Rendezvous

The Fort Bridger Rendezvous is an annual reenactment of trading which took place during the Fur Trade Era between mountain men, Native Americans, fur trappers and traders. The event takes place at Fort Bridger, Wyoming.
History.
The fur trade era was from 1825-1840. It was caused by the popularity of beaver skin hats on the east coast of the United States and Europe. In response to the high demand fur trappers and traders headed west to hunt for beaver. In the fall and winter the beavers would be hunted and their pelts would be scraped, stretched and salted for shipment. Then in the spring and summer these trappers would travel over 1,000 miles one way to St. Louis so they could sell their product for supplies. The suppliers decided it would be more effective coming to the mountain men and trading supplies for the furs there instead of St. Louis, thus the Rendezvous was born. The first Rendezvous took place in southern Wyoming in 1825. 
Every year over Labor Day weekend the town of Fort Bridger, Wyoming holds a reenactment of the Rendezvous which took place during the Fur Trade Era. Marksmanship contests are held with rifles of the time period, along with axe throwing contests and archery. Foods of the time period are also sold, and the Fort Bridger Historical site has workshops people can get involved in to learn about what life was like in those days.

Piz Lischana

Piz Lischana is a mountain in the Sesvenna Range of the Alps, overlooking Scuol in the Swiss canton of Graubünden. With an elevation of 3,105 metres above sea level, Piz Lischana is the highest summit of the Sesvenna Range north of the Fuorcla Sesvenna (2,819 metres).
The normal route of ascent is from the "Chamanna Lischana" a mountain hut operated by the Swiss Alpine Club, to the Fuorcla de Rims (2940 m), a col at the low point between Piz Lischana and Piz San Jon, and then along the South-East ridge of the mountain passing over the intermediate summit at pt. 3044. The route is graded T3+ or T4 in the Swiss Hiking Scale. The final section of this route can also be reached from S-charl via the Fora dal'Aua and via the Val d'Uina, but these routes are longer and involve more ascent. Other routes to the summit involve technical climbing.
A substantial rock fall from the summit pyramid into the Val de Triazza was recorded on camera by a party who had just left the summit on July 31, 2011. It is estimated that 2000 cubic metres of rock fell. The route from the saddle below the summit was assessed by the local authorities and re-routed with prominent red dot route marks to avoid the areas prone to further rock falls.
During the last quarter of the 20th Century the Vadret de Lischana plateau glacier covered the 4 km2 plateau between Piz Lischana and the Lai da Rims. The has disappeared except for two relics, the small glacier Vadret de Triazza below the South-East ridge and one which retains the original name below Piz San Jon.

Line 4, Beijing Subway

Line 4 of the Beijing Subway () is the 9th subway line in Beijing's mass transit network. It entered into operation on September 28, 2009, and runs from north to south, parallel and to the west of Line 5, through Haidian, Xicheng, Xuanwu and Fengtai Districts in the western half of the city. It is 28.2 km long with 24 stations. Riding on this line costs a flat fare of RMB(¥) 2.00 with unlimited transfers. This line is coloured teal on the subway map.
Line 4 and Daxing Line operate as a single line although they are classified as separate lines.
Hours of operation.
The first south-bound trains departs from Anheqiao North at 5:00am. The first north-bound train departs from Gongyixiqiao at 5:10am. The last north-bound train leaves Anheqiao North at 10:45pm. The last south-bound train leaves Gongyixiqiao at 11:10pm. Each train completes the entire journey in 48 minutes.
Route.
In the north, Line 4 begins in Anheqiao, just beyond the Summer Palace and heads south past the Old Summer Palace, through the university district and Zhongguancun, Beijing's high-tech silicon village, before turning east at the National Library of China and passing the Beijing Zoo en route to Xizhimen. After entering the 2nd Ring Road at Xizhimen, Line 4 resumes southwards at Xinjiekou and traverses the old city through Xisi, Xidan, Xuanwumen, Caishikou, and Taoranting Park. It passes the city's high-speed rail link at the Beijing South Railway Station before reaching the terminus at Gongyixiqiao. Construction began 2004 but delays have pushed back the opening date by two years to September 28, 2009.
List of Stations.
The following is the list of stations, from north to south (with transfer points* to other lines):
Planning and Construction.
Plans for Line 4 date back to the 1950s when Beijing's first subway line was still under construction. It was planned to run from the Summer Palace, east towards Xizhimen, southeast to Zhongshan Park, terminating at the Beijing Stadium, which near today's Tiantandongmen Station. Ultimately, the section between Summer Palace to Xizhimen was built as planned. However, construction only formally started in 2004.
On December 3, 2004 Hong Kong's MTR Corporation, Beijing Infrastructure Investment Co., Ltd., and Beijing Capital Group Co., Ltd. signed the Beijing Metro Line 4, investment, construction, operation principle of cooperation agreement, making Line 4 the Mainland China's first rail transit line financed using a public-private partnership framework. Subsequently in November 8, 2005 a Joint Venture between the 3 companies was established. The Hong Kong MTRC will invest 735 million RMB to the construction of Line 4 and in return have the right to operate Line 4 for 30 years.
In February 11, 2009 the construction of Line 4 is nearing completion with all tunnels bored. In March 6, four subway trains begin testing while Hong Kong's then Chief Executive, Donald Tsang, visited the project. On September 28, 2009, Beijing Subway Line 4 is officially opened for trial operation. Bringing the number of subway lines in Beijing to 9. On December 30, 2010, the Daxing Line started trial operation, with direct service into Line 4. Creating a 35 station 50 km long line.
Operation.
Unlike the other lines of the Beijing Subway, which are completely state-owned and operated, Line 4 was built and is managed by the Beijing MTR Corp. Ltd., a three-way joint-venture among the Hong Kong MTR Corporation, the Beijing Capital Group ("BCG"), and the Beijing Infrastructure Investment Co. ("BIIC"). The Hong Kong MTR, which operates the Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway, and the state-owned BCG each holds a 49% stake in the venture and the BIIC has 2%. The JV is responsible for 30% of the investment capital to build Line 4, mainly to finance the purchase of electrical and mechanical equipment, while the Beijing Municipal Government provided the remaining 70%, to cover civil engineering, station, and track work costs.
The Beijing government has also awarded the JV a concession to manage Line 4 for 30 years. The PPP JV model was designed to introduce private capital as well as advanced metro management methods to the growing Beijing Subway. Among the most visible differences in management of Line 4 is a ban on food and beverage consumption inside Line 4 trains and stations. No such ban exists for other Beijing subway lines.
Future development.
Planners in Haidian District have proposed extending the line to the north by 8 km with four additional stations. The planned stations have been identified as Baiwangshan (百旺山), Xibeiwang (西北旺), Aerospace City West (航天城西), and Yongfeng (永丰站). The extension remains in the planning stages as there are no plans to build it yet. However according to the June 2010 plans, Line 4’s northern extension will be replaced by the northern extension of Line 16.

Roslyn Village Historic District

The Roslyn Village Historic District encompasses the center of that village in the U.S. state of New York. It includes within its boundaries the earlier Main Street Historic District, although that is considered a separate district by the National Park Service, which added the Roslyn Village district to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987.
Distinct from the Main Street district, the newer one includes more commercial property along Old Northern Boulevard, which makes a loop through downtown Roslyn off North Hempstead Turnpike (NY 25A), the main through road along Long Island's North Shore. Its contributing buildings, including several listed separately on the Register, are generally distributed over a wider range of architectural styles from the 19th and early 20th centuries.
Geography.
All but 25 of the district's 65 acres (6 of 26 ha) are accounted for by the Main Street District, which includes all property along that Street between Glen Avenue and the intersection with East Broadway. The Roslyn Village district includes most of the remaining properties within the triangle created by Main, East Broadway and Old Northern, and some areas to the northeast along Glen Avenue going up to Route 25A and the old northern mill pond.
History.
Since the settlement's earliest days, in the mid-17th century, its development had clustered around Main Street. That growth took off in the early 19th century after independence, when most of the houses on Main were built. After the Civil War, demand still existed for houses in Roslyn, and buyers and builders turned to East Broadway, which shared the steep hillside and Roslyn Pond shoreline as Main, although in opposite directions.
As a result the East Broadway houses skew to the late 19th century, with Victorian styles predominating. James K. Davis, who had earlier designed some of the Main Street houses, embraced the new Second Empire mansard roofed look in 1876 for his own house at 139 East Broadway. The Queen Anne style is exemplified by Evangeline Charman's 207 East Broadway home, built in 1895.
In the early 20th century there was still some room left to build on at the edges of the district, and in 1921 the Bryant Library on East Broadway gave the future district its major Colonial Revival building. By 1930 the East Broadway area was as developed as Main Street had been several decades before, and builders turned elsewhere, leaving the district to retain its own historic character.
As Roslyn's Landmark Society began to focus local attention on idenitifying and preserving the village's historic buildings in the 1960s, leading to the creation of the Main Street district, threatened older houses from elsewhere in the village and greater Roslyn area were moved to East Broadway to better protect them. An expanded historic inventory in 1979 led to a local Multiple Property Submission, which included the Roslyn Village district. The reviewers of the National Park Service initially balked at the idea of having two separate districts, suggesting instead that the state Office of Historic Preservation apply to expand the boundaries of the existing district. The state resubmitted the application, carefully explaining how Main Street constituted a visually and historically distinct collection of properties even within the proposed new district, and the Roslyn Village Historic District was added to the National Register.
Preservation.
Roslyn has added to its ordinances a provision protecting the buildings in both its historic districts. They are recognized in its zoning and any additions, demolition or alterations are subject to approval by the six-member Historic District Board. The Roslyn Landmark Society also holds a restrictive covenant on some of the properties.

Fort Street Presbyterian Church (Detroit, Michigan)

The Fort Street Presbyterian Church is located at 631 West Fort Street in Detroit, Michigan. It was originally constructed in 1855, and completely rebuilt in 1876. The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1971. Its steeple stands , making it one of the tallest churches in the United States.
Early history.
The lot for the church was purchased from Mr. Shadrack and Mary (Stead) Gillett, whose home was located there prior to the contsruction of the church. The population of Detroit grew rapidly in the 1830s and 1840s, in particular bringing an influx of English Protestants to the city. In 1849, Reverend Robert Kellogg organized the Second Presbyterian Church, which had 26 charter members at that time. The congregation met for worship in the old Capitol building until they a church was constructed on the corner of Lafayette and Wayne the next year.
Construction and reconstruction.
In 1852, Albert Jordan and his brother Octavius arrived in Detroit from Hartford, Connecticut, and soon established a place among the leading architects of the city. In the mid-1850s, despite a membership of only 167 people, the Second Presbyterian congregation hired Albert and Octavius Jordan to design a new, larger church. The location the congregation picked was on Fort Street just west of downtown; Fort Street at that time was a fashionable residential area, boasting homes of such Detroit notables (and congregation members) as Russell A. Alger, James F. Joy (Henry B. Joy's father), Theodore S. Buhl, Henry D. Shelden, and Zachariah Chandler. After the move, the congregation changed their name to the "Fort Street Presbyterian Church."
The original church was completed in 1855 at a cost of $70,000. The construction cost prevented the congregation from fully finishing the interior until 15 years later, when the gallery and pews conforming to the original design were installed.
However, the building was destroyed by fire in 1876, completely demolishing the interior, destroying the roof, and sending the spire crashing onto Fort Street. The church was rebuilt according to the original architectural plans the following year. Another major fire in 1914 again destroyed the roof, but the church was again rebuilt, and it remains as it had been designed by the Jordan brothers in the mid-1850s. Upon completion, the current church with its steeple at ranked as the tallest building in the city and state from 1877 to 1909, and is among the tallest churches in the United States.
Architecture.
The Fort Street Presbyterian Church is an ornately detailed Gothic Revival structure built of limestone ashlar from Malden, Ontario. The facade features a 265-foot (81 m) tall square tower with spire on one side with a shorter octagonal turret (modeled after King's College Chapel in Cambridge) on the other. A central stained glass window illuminates the sanctuary. There are seven bays along the side of the church with flying buttresses, crocketed finials, lacy stonework and tall windows, designed to give the impression of lightness.
The interior of the Fort Street Presbyterian Church features a three-aisle nave and a horseshoe balcony capable of seating almost 1,000 people. The pews are of hand-carved black walnut. The baptismal font is constructed of Caen stone, supported by onyx columns imported from Mexico. The solid brass lectern, in the shape of an eagle, was exhibited in 1893 at the Chicago World's Fair. Tiles dotting the stone floor are early works of Mary Chase Perry Stratton, founder of Pewabic Pottery.
The church organ was built by in 1914 by Wangerian-Weickhardt, and contains 3,253 pipes ranging in length from 1/4 inch to 16 feet. It incorporates a small portion of the original 1855 organ.
Significance.
The Fort Street Presbyterian Church exemplifies an important step in the rise of "revivalist" architecture in 19th-century America. American architects of the mid-19th century imported and re-interpreted the English Gothic Revival style, based on the visually lush details of Medieval cathedrals. The American architects copied the "Gothic" elements and combined them with simple building plans to create an American architectural style known as "Victorian Gothic". The Jordan brothers subscribed to this ethic, and their Fort Street Presbyterian Church, as well as being one of Michigan's oldest churches, is a premier example of Victorian Gothic architecture. The church has remained essentially unchanged despite fires there in 1877 and 1914.
Later history.
In the early 20th century, the church began focusing more on social service programs, as people of more modest incomes moved into the surrounding, formerly aristocratic, area. In 1908, James Joy donated property adjoining the church, and Mrs. Oren Scotten gave $50,000 to pay for the construction of the Church House. This enabled the church to minister to the newer congregants, and the church used the gymnasium in the Church House as a kind of "health club," enrolling men, women, and children in gym classes. The church also sponsored one of the first Boy Scout troops west of the Alleghenies.
Membership grew steadily up through the middle of the Great Depression; however, membership, revenue, and attendance fell off afterward. In the early 1940s, plans were afoot to close the expensive church and perhaps pool with other congregations to open a combined church elsewhere in the city. However, World War II intervened. During the war, the church converted the gymnasium of the Church House into a dormitory for servicemen who were arriving at the train station then across the street. By the war's end, the church had provided transient accommodations for 60,000 men.

Giana Roberge

Giana Roberge (born December 16, 1970, in New Hampshire) is an American female road cycle racer from who after retiring from professional cycling in 1999 due to a heart condition, began another successful career as a team director, leading the Saturn Women's road team to become one of the most successful teams in the world. In 2003, she returned to cycle racing and has now competed in every major women's one-day and stage race in the world.
On August 5, 2005, Roberge was inducted into the International Cycling Hall of Fame in Utica, New York. Roberge was honoured for both her racing career and her contribution to the sport as the Director of the Saturn Women's Cycling Team and the president and owner of Team Speed Queen.
Success.
Early Racing Career (1992-2003).
Entered the world of cycling in 1992 when she worked for Paradox Bicycle Center in Saratoga Springs, New York. After two years as manager and purchaser, she bought the shop. Simultaneously to owning the shop, Giana began to foray into road and mountain biking, quickly rising to the top of the women’s road peloton. In 1996 she turned pro with the Timex Women’s Cycling Team, and was met with good successes. She went on to become a member of the US National Team and raced with Timex until 1999 when a heart condition determined her premature retirement.
Manager and Director Sportif.
Tom Schuler (Team Sports) hired Giana in August 1999 as the manager of the Timex Team, and in 2000 she was both manager and Director Sportif of the team. In 2001 she merged the Timex Team with the Saturn Team and became the Assistant General Manager of the Saturn Team as well as the women’s Director Sportif. She led them to become the #1 UCI ranked women's team and ensured back to back World Cup series titles, as well as assisting in the qualifying over 20 Saturn and Timex Team men and women athletes for the 2000 and 2004 Olympics.
Return to Racing (2003 onwards).
In 2003, Roberge was given a clean bill of health and returned to racing when she had time between directing the Saturn Women to the #1 ranking in the US and managing both the men’s and women’s teams. She won the Master’s US National Time Trial Championships and was Silver Medalist at the Master’s World Championships. She was later quoted in interview say that "I'm really bummed that I got silver at Masters World's last year - I really wanted to get gold."
In 2004, a lifelong ambition to compete in the RAAM was put on hold because of three broken ribs and mononucleosis. In lieu of RAAM, she focused on winning the World Championship title, which she did in August riding an Independent Fabrication XS. Along with racing in 2004, she focused time on her new company, Team Speed Queen] and managing the Quark Team. She also led European coaching tours, which included five weeks in Spain and four weeks at the Tour de France.

Nantmor railway station

Nantmor is a railway halt in North Wales serving the nearby hamlet of the same name. It is located between the stations of and on the recently restored Welsh Highland Railway. It had existed during the first period of the WHR, 1923–1936, and was rebuilt for the current line, opening on 27 May 2010.
History.
It was originally constructed as part of the Welsh Highland Railway in 1922-23. In 1934 the Festiniog Railway Company assumed direct control of the WHR and renamed the station Aberglaslyn as part of an attempt to attract more passengers. The station closed in 1936 when passenger traffic on the historic railway ceased.
The original station had a corrugated iron building. A replica was built in 1996, by the WHR Ltd, at its terminus at .
Present day.
Although there were plans for a halt serving Nantmor when the re-building of the WHR was proposed, they were dropped because of local objections. Subsequently, on 23 and 24 February 2007, a parish vote was held and by a large majority, (36 to 11) they agreed to ask for a halt to be located in the village. The plans were revived, and submitted to the Snowdonia National Park Authority on 18 July 2007.
Approval was granted on 6 December 2007. Construction was delayed until February 2010 due to a shortage of resources and work was completed by 16 March 2010. It re-opened on 26 May 2010, when the line was extended to . The rebuilding had been funded by the Welsh Highland Railway Society using funds donated in memory of one of its members.

Fathers and Sons (short story)

"Fathers and Sons" is a short story by Ernest Hemingway published 1933, in the collection "Winner Take Nothing". It later appeared in "The Fifth Column and the First Forty-Nine Stories" and "The Snows of Kilimanjaro and Other Stories".
The story is a personal narrative that follows the path of Nick Adams as he drives through his hometown with his son. Most of the story is told through memories of Nick's childhood and Father. The story chronicles the relationships between three generations of men. 
Important themes in "Fathers and Sons" include father–son relationships, Nick's homecoming, growing up, and role models.
Plot.
"Fathers and Sons" is a story about Nicholas Adams driving home with his son after a hunting trip in his hometown. Hunting imagery and small-town agriculture make Nick think about his father, who taught him how to hunt. Nick’s father had fantastic vision, but Nick says this skill made him nervous. Nick’s father was a sentimental man, and Nick says that most sentimental people are both cruel and abused. Nick loved his father, but hated the way he smelled. Nick lost his sense of smell when he started smoking, which he reflects is a good thing because a good sense of smell is not necessary to man. Nick never shared anything with his father past the age of fifteen. Nick’s father taught him how to hunt by giving him only three bullets a day. Nick learned much from his father about hunting, but little about sex. Nick learned about sex from his lover Trudy Gilby, an Ojibway girl from a nearby Indian camp. Nick would go hunting with her and her brother Billy.
Nick is interrupted from his memories by his son, who asks what it’s like to live with Indians and if he can have a gun. Nick tells him that it’s his son’s decision if he wants to live with Indians, and that he can have a gun at age twelve. Nick thinks about, but does not tell his son, how Trudy “did first what no one has ever done better." He also thinks to himself that shooting one flying bird is like shooting all flying birds—the experience is always just as good. Nick’s son does not believe that his grandfather could have been a better hunter than Nick, but Nick says that the man was always disappointed in the way Nick shot. Nick’s son expresses regret that they have never yet prayed at his grandfather’s grave and concern that he will not be able to pray at his father’s grave, and Nick says that he can see that they will need to do that soon.
Style.
"Fathers and Sons" is another example of the classic "Hemingway Style". Characterized by economy and iceberg theory, the "Hemingway Style" is the product of obsessive revision. Hemingway himself, when asked about his style, said "I must say that what amateurs call a style is usually only the unavoidable awkwardness in first trying to make something that has not heretofore been made."

<doc id="18249206" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18249206" title="Thomas J. Fogarty">
Thomas J. Fogarty

Dr. Thomas J. Fogarty (born in Cincinnati, Ohio on February 25, 1934) is an American surgeon and inventor of the embolectomy catheter. Before his invention the success rate for removing an embolus, or blood clot, was forty to fifty percent. In 1963, Dr. Thomas Fogarty published an article describing "a new method for extraction of arterial emboli and thrombi."
The balloon embolectomy catheter was used on a human patient for the first time six weeks after Fogarty came up with the idea in 1961. Today, using only local anesthesia, the procedure only takes about an hour.
Fogarty’s inventions and the many others that resulted from his original embolectomy catheter heavily influenced the way surgery was performed. When asked about the time the impact his invention had on the field, he says, "I had no concept that surgery would reach the magnitude that it has." As a result of the invention, Dr. Fogarty, still alive today, went on to win many prizes and patent over sixty inventions.
Early life and education.
On February 25, 1934, Fogarty was born into a poor, Irish Catholic family as the youngest of three children living in Cincinnati. His father worked as a railroad engineer, but he died when Fogarty was just eight years old.
Fogarty assumed a role of greater responsibility at a young age, but, as he points out later in life, his father’s absence also nurtured his own creative nature as an inventor. He fixed things that his mother needed fixed, and he worked with soapbox derby cars and model airplanes. "I just had a natural inclination and inquisitive nature about building things. I looked at things and just naturally thought, 'Okay, how can I make this better?'" His business side was evident in childhood as well. The model airplanes that he built were sold to neighborhood kids. When he became frustrated with motor scooter gears, he built and sold a centrifugal clutch.
As for Fogarty’s educational background, he was not a top-notch student, and his original career goal was to be a boxer. “I wasn’t a very good kid. They sent me to a camp to keep me out of trouble. One of the routine activities was boxing. I became the Midwest Golden Glove champ.”
To help his family get by in the late 1940s, fourteen-year old Fogarty started working at Good Samaritan Hospital during a time when hospitals were still exempt from child labor laws. He began the job cleaning medical equipment in the eighth grade, but he continued working during his high school summer vacations and was soon promoted to scrub technician, a person who handed medical instruments to surgeons.
During his last year of high school, Fogarty discovered that he wanted to be a doctor. At the age of 17, he quit his boxing career after he broke his nose in a match that ended in a draw. A family priest gave him a recommendation, and because of his awful grades, he was admitted to Cincinnati’s Xavier University on probation.
In order to get through college, Fogarty took on three jobs and received financial assistance from Dr. Jack Cranley, Fogarty’s mentor and one of the most prominent vascular surgeons in the United States. Fogarty was Cranley’s private scrub technician at Good Samaritan Hospital. “I had a mentor who encouraged me and helped to persuade me to go to college…He had 10 kids and I became the 11th. He always told me, ‘You are smarter than you think.’”
Fogarty graduated from Xavier University with a bachelor’s degree in biology in 1956 and went on to attend the Cincinnati College of Medicine where he graduated in 1960. From 1960 to 1961, he interned at the University of Oregon Medical School in Portland, Oregon, and he completed his surgical residency at the same school in 1965.
Invention of the embolectomy catheter.
During Fogarty’s years at Good Samaritan Hospital, he witnessed the deaths of many patients who died from complications in blood clot surgeries in their limbs. “Fifty percent of the patients died. I thought there must be a better way.” Before Fogarty’s invention, surgeons had to use forceps to remove the blood clots only after a huge part of an artery had been cut open, and the patient would be under general anesthesia for hours. Blood flow is usually interrupted in the procedure, increasing the risk of the patient losing a limb.
At home, the ideas that went through Fogarty’s head concerned different ways of making the procedure better, and he especially concentrated on avoiding the risky incisions. He tinkered with a urethral catheter and a balloon in his attic. Because a catheter only required a small incision, it would be able to get to the clot without much trauma to the patient. The urethral catheter is also flexible yet strong enough to be pushed through a blood clot. As for the balloon, he basically cut off the tip of the pinky finger of a size 5 surgical latex glove and attempted to incorporate it onto the end of the catheter. The resulting balloon could be inflated with saline using a syringe, and once it expands to the size of the artery, it is then retracted, withdrawing the clot through the artery and out the incision.
The main problem in building this device was the way the balloon could be attached to the catheter. Glue that could hold vinyl, the material making up a catheter, and latex, the type of glove used, was not available. Fogarty’s own take on the catheter came about because of fly fishing techniques he learned as a child. Precise hand-tying was needed in fly fishing, and with these techniques, he tied the balloon to the catheter. "I'd always tied flies and made lures so it was just a natural thing." His experimental balloon catheter, however, always seemed to burst when it was over inflated. It even broke when he dragged it through glass tubes filled with Jell-o, a model he thought simulated a clot within an artery. After some time, he figured out the type and thickness of rubber that was firm enough when inflated to extract a clot and still flexible enough to move through without breaking. The device, made before Fogarty even received his MD from University of Cincinnati in 1960, became the first minimally invasive surgical device.
Fogarty, however, came across difficulties in getting a manufacturer to produce it. From 1959 to 1961, nobody was willing to help. "Companies thought I was some stooge fooling around. I didn't have any credibility." Dr. Cranley continued to encourage him, and soon, during his fellowship training at the University of Cincinnati in 1961 and 1962, Fogarty started to make the catheter system by hand for himself and for other vascular surgeons.
At the University of Oregon, while Fogarty was completing his residency in surgery, Dr. Al Starr, head of the cardiothoracic division, used Fogarty’s balloon catheters. After he was informed that no company was willing to manufacture Fogarty’s device, he asked one of his acquaintances, Lowell Edwards, an electrical engineer and president of his own company, to give the device consideration in producing it. In 1969, Fogarty patented his device, and Edwards Life Sciences from Irvine, California, was assigned the patent to begin manufacturing the Fogarty embolectomy catheter.
Because of the decreased risk associated with the device, it became the industry standard. It is still the most widely used catheter for blood-clot removal today and has been used in over three hundred thousand procedures every year all over the world. It is estimated to have saved the lives and limbs of approximately fifteen million patients.
Other inventions.
Numerous sequel applications of Fogarty’s catheter came about. The first balloon angioplasty, for example, was performed with a Fogarty catheter in 1965, and has led to over six hundred fifty thousand such operations per year. Fogarty has also modified his catheter to less invasive biopsy techniques.
After completing his residency and becoming a cardiovascular surgeon, Fogarty continued to invent new medical devices as a holder of more than 60 patents, with more still pending. Based on many of the devices founded in his own Fogarty Engineering, Inc., around twenty companies have been started.
One of Fogarty’s most successful products is the Stent-Graft. This dealt with the difficult problem of abdominal aortic aneurysms, which is a term referring to a weakened blood vessel. The old method was to remove the bad part of a weakened blood vessel, but Fogarty’s idea was to support it with an implant. He used a stent, a thin polyester tube that grabs onto the blood vessels. A catheter transports the stent to the weakened blood vessel, and once the balloon is inflated, the stent expands to the size of the blood vessel, and blood flows normally.
He also invented the Fogarty Clamp, which is used in cardiac surgeries.
Thomas Fogarty Winery and Vineyards.
In 1969, when he began teaching surgery at the Stanford University Medical Center, Fogarty was first introduced to the wine industry. He helped out a Stanford colleague’s small winery with vineyard and cellar practices. Later on, he purchased land in the Santa Cruz Mountains. He established a cellar there and began making wine with grapes bought from nearby growers. He planted his first vines in 1978 and set up a commercial winery, Thomas Fogarty Winery and Vineyards, in 1981. The estate now consists of three hundred twenty-five acres. Fifteen thousand cases of wine are produced annually.
Fogarty’s basis for winemaking also stems from his explanation that certain elements in the extracts from grape skin relax the blood vessels and lower the affinity for blood to clot.
Of the wines produced in Fogarty’s vineyard, the 2004 SCM Lexington Meritage wine received “double gold” status in the San Francisco International Wine Competition in 2008, and the 2005 Santa Cruz Mountains Chardonnay was the gold medal winner and the “Best Chardonnay of Class” in the 2008 San Francisco Chronicle Wine Competition.
Dr. Fogarty's eldest son, Tommy, 47, has taken over the day-to-day operations of the Winery. Like his father, Tommy was also an avid boxer in his youth, winning multiple amateur golden-glove tournaments throughout the Bay area. The younger Fogarty is famously credited for knocking down Danny Bonaduce in a celebrity boxing match in San Jose in 1997.
Three Arch Partners.
Fogarty, along with Mark Wan and Wilfred Jaeger, co-founded a venture capital firm called Three Arch Partners in Portola Valley, California, in 1993. Wan and Jaeger both had noteworthy experience in the venture capitalism field, but it was Fogarty’s prestige that caused the firm to grow.
Three Arch Partners focused on early stage medical device companies and has helped with the growth of more than fifty new healthcare companies. It manages over one billion dollars in capital.
In 2004, however, Fogarty was fired from the firm. He was let go due to issues pertaining to the amount of time Fogarty devoted to the firm. His time spent teaching, making wine, and working Fogarty Engineering, Inc. contributed to this decision. “It’s like giving birth to a child, but then having to leave it behind, which is hurtful, but I’ve been kicked of better places than Arch, and I wouldn’t say that I wish them well.”
The Fogarty Institute for Innovation.
Fogarty left Stanford Medical School after about fourteen years as a professor and practicing cardiovascular surgeon. In September 2007, at Mountain View, California, in Silicon Valley, he founded the Thomas Fogarty Institute for Innovation. It occupies forty-five hundred square feet of offices and engineering labs on the campus of El Camino Hospital. The educational, non-profit organization mentors and trains medical innovators. The idea for the institution dates back to Fogarty’s early life when he received encouragement from Dr. Jack Cranley.
“We are teaching people (doctors and engineers) how to get their concepts and products into use. Very few have gone through the process of coming up with a concept and getting it funded. That does not come naturally. It comes through experience. We will teach how to address these challenges.” Physician innovators, including Fogarty, serve as the faculty of the Institute and make use of their networks and experiences in the private industry to help those with projects that are ready for commercialization.

Safety Catch

Safety Catch is a sitcom on BBC Radio 4 created by Laurence Howarth and written by Howarth and John Finnemore. The series was first broadcast in 2007. It is about Simon McGrath (played by Darren Boyd), a man who works in a job that he does not like – the arms trade. The show mocks issues of morality, although Howarth claims that the show is not satirical. Because of the subject matter and the light-hearted way it is treated, the series is one of Radio 4's most controversial. A second series was broadcast in April 2009.
Plot.
Simon McGrath, the narrator and anti-hero of the series, works as an arms dealer whose main job is selling arms to Gambia. Simon claims that he would prefer to work elsewhere, but due to a combination of laziness and cowardice he has failed to change to a job which is less problematic in terms of morality. He tries to do the good thing, such as donating blood and recycling, but he knows that he could do better. He tries to defend himself by saying that if he was not doing the job, then someone else would.
Simon's job puts strains on his relationships. His girlfriend Anna Greig (Joanna Page) wants to settle down and have a family with Simon, but it is mainly because it is easier than trying to find another boyfriend. Simon's sister, Judith (Sarah Smart), who works for Oxfam hates her brother's job and would like to disown him, but she cannot bring herself to do it. Angela (Brigit Forsyth), Simon's mother, does not mind the ethical implications surrounding her son's job as long he has a steady occupation. Simon's main work colleague is Boris Kemal (Lewis MacLeod), who has no problem with the morality with his job, claiming that his work is a humanitarian service, once saying, "Give a man a fish and he can feed himself for a day. Give a man a gun and he can steal fish for the rest of his life." Despite his exotic name, Boris is actually a Scot who lives in Folkestone.
Controversy.
"Safety Catch" has attracted controversy due to its material. One viewer complained to the BBC complaints show "Feedback", saying that the show was, "Morally vacuous". However, after this complaint was broadcast, fans of the show wrote in to praise the show. In response, Howarth claimed that his aim in writing the series was just trying be funny, claiming that if the series was trying to be moral, then it would probably fail. Howarth also said that the series is not actually about the arms trade, but the life of some who works in the arms trade. The producer of "Safety Catch", Dawn Ellis, said that the arms trade is a subject that should not be avoided in comedy.
A listener also complained about the references to Gambia being the country to which the arms are dealt, despite the fact that Gambia is one of the most peaceful countries in Africa. Howarth said that he was writing it so that Gambia was at the brink of a war, not at war, because of a recent coup d'état in the country. Howarth also complained about people demanding that his show should be taken off the air, claiming it was censorship.

45th Reconnaissance Squadron

The 45th Reconnaissance Squadron is a United States Air Force unit. It is assigned to the 55th Operations Group and stationed at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska.
Overview.
The mission of the 45th Reconnaissance Squadron is to maintain, operate, and support OC/RC/TC/EC/WC-135 aircraft providing worldwide reconnaissance and treaty support to the National Command Authorities, warfighters, and international treaty members.
Squadron personnel fly world-wide reconnaissance and treaty missions on demand, often on extremely short notice. The 45th Reconnaissance Squadron provides data for the National Command Authorities, theater CINCs, and international treaty members.
History.
World War II.
Organized on 17 August 1943 as the 423d Night Fighter Squadron, the 45th Reconnaissance Squadron is one of the most colorful units in the Air Force, with a battle record composed of the great campaigns of three wars, and a peacetime record of vital contributions to world-wide reconnaissance, treaty monitoring, and pilot proficiency training.
The squadron was organized at Orlando Army Air Base, Florida, and was stationed at Kern County Airport, California, before heading overseas in January 1944. 
On 22 June 1944, the 423d was redesignated the 155th Photographic Reconnaissance Squadron. On 3 December 1945, the 155th was redesignated the 45th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, Night Photographic. The 155th participated in the Normandy invasion in June 1944, landed in France in August 1944, and fought its way across northern France into the Low Countries that winter. In December 1944, the 155th was involved in the Battle of the Bulge. The most notable geographic names associated with the 155th were Chormy Down and Chalgrove, England; Rennes, Chateaudun, and St. Dizier, France; LeCulot, Belgium; and Maastricht, Holland.
The squadron crossed into Germany at Kassel/Rothwestern in early July 1945, and was later stationed at Darmstadt, Furth, and Furstenfeldbruck. On 1 July 1948, the unit was redesignated the 45th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, Night Photographic and inactivated on 25 March 1949.
Cold War.
As the focus of world attention shifted to the growing crisis in the Orient in 1950, the 45th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, Night Photographic was redesignated the 45th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron on 19 September 1950 and activated on 26 September 1950 at Itazuke, Japan.
When hostilities erupted 27 December 1950, the 45th was deployed to Taegu, Korea, and served in every major campaign throughout the war. In mid-summer 1951, the squadron shifted its base of operations to Kimpo AB (K-14), Korea. On 1 January 1953, the 45th was redesignated the 45th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, Photographic-Jet. The 45th remained at Kimpo until March 1955 when it relocated to Misawa Air Base, Japan.
The 45th remained at Misawa until the overthrow of President Diem of South Vietnam in November 1962. A detachment of the 45th had earlier been deployed to Thailand due to the turmoil in South Vietnam. In December 1962, the unit deployed to Tan Son Nhut Airfield, Saigon, recalling the detachment deployed to Thailand. The unit was redesignated the 45th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron on 1 January 1967.
During its nine years in Vietnam, the 45th was involved in most major operations of the war. On 31 May 1971, the unit was inactivated at Tan Son Nhut. On 5 October 1971, the unit was activated at Bergstrom AFB, Texas, replacing the 4th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron. The 45th participated in various training exercises while at Bergstrom, including a 1973 deployment to RAF Alconbury, England for a NATO exercise dubbed CREEK BEE II. Later, the unit transferred its aircraft to Shaw AFB, South Carolina, and was inactivated on 31 October 1975.
The squadron was activated again on 8 September 1981 as the 45th Tactical Reconnaissance Training Squadron. It received the RF-4C aircraft from the 363rd Tactical Reconnaissance Wing at Shaw AFB, South Carolina and began operations at Bergstrom AFB, Texas on 1 April 1982. The unit trained over 600 students and supported numerous operational deployments and exercises until it was inactivated on 30 September 1989, a result of national budgetary reductions.
Modern era.
On 1 July 1994, the squadron was reactivated at Offutt AFB, Nebraska, as the 45th Reconnaissance Squadron. It assumed the mission of the former 24th Reconnaissance Squadron, which was inactivated on 30 June 1994. 45th Reconnaissance Squadron personnel are members of a professional team dedicated to the maintenance, operation, and support of the RC/OC/WC/EC/TC-135 aircraft.

The Devil's Sword

"The Devil's Sword" (Indonesian: "Golok Setan") is a 1984 Indonesian sword and sorcery film directed by Ratno Timoer. The film stars Indonesian action star Barry Prima who appears in such films as "Ferocious Female Freedom Fighters" and "The Warrior". "The Devil's Sword" crosses over into many different genres of film. The film features martial arts, and also elements of fantasy, horror, sci-fi, and also some mild sexual content due to the portrayal of the Alligator Queen.
Background.
Just like the better known character Jaka Sembung, protagonist of the film is taken from a comic book. 1987 film "Mandala Dari Sungai Ular" ("Mandala from the Snake River"), a sequel to "The Devil's Sword", is an eponymous adaptation of the cartoon. The main difference between two characters is that Mandala is a warrior from mythical pre-Islamic times of the Archipelago while Jaka Sembung is a Muslim and West Javanese freedom fighter against Dutch colonial rule.
Plot.
The Devil's Sword follows a quest to find an ancient sword that was forged from a mysterious metallic substance that fell to earth in the form of a meteorite. An old man who finds the meteorite creates the Devil's Sword, and he hides it after it burns down his hut. Whoever wields the sword holds the greatest power imaginable in his hands. Banyujaga (Advent Bangun) is sent by the Alligator Queen (Gudhi Sintara) to steal the fiancé of a local village's princess (Enny Christina) to keep as her own subject. During the raid on the village, Mandala (Barry Prima), a one time colleague of Banyujaga, sees the scuffle and helps defend the village, and ends up helping the princess recover her husband to be. Mandala recovers the Devil's Sword, but will it ultimately be enough to defeat the Alligator Queen and Banyujaga?

John Richardson (orientalist)

John Richardson (1740/1741 – 1795), FAS of Wadham College, Oxford, was the editor of the first Persian-Arabic-English dictionary in 1778-1780. His seminal work on Persian grammar, written in collaboration with Sir William Jones, was noteworthy amongst the early works on this subject; and it remains significant in the context of that philological foundation from which all subsequent grammatical studies were to evolve. 
Richardson's scholarly compilation was organized in a format similar to Mesgnien-Meninski's "Thesaurus Linguarum Orientalis, Turcicæ, Arabicæ, Persicæ" (1680).
Each book in the two-volume set was sold separately; many more of the first part (the Persian-Arabic-English volume) were sold than the second part (the English-Persian-Arabic volume). When booksellers found themselves with an overstock of first edition broken sets, a greater number of copies of the second edition's first book were printed. 
Richardson's ground-breaking scholarship was more broadly disseminated in Charles Wilkins' several revised versions of the dictionary. Subsequent work by the 19th century philologists Francis Johnson, Francis Joseph Steingass and others ensured that Richardson's name continued to be well known as an orientalist and as a scholar.
Selected works.
Richardson's reputation has been burnished by the work of subsequent lexicographers who have revised and extended his work.

"No Escapin' This" is the first single from "Take It or Squeeze It", a 2001 album by East Coast hip hop group The Beatnuts. It was released by Loud Records in 2001 in both 12 inch and CD format. The song is produced by The Beatnuts and features braggadocious raps by Juju and Psycho Les, as well as ad libs performed by Greg Nice and a chorus performed by Claudette Sierra. The track's beat samples "A Little Fugue for You and Me" by Enoch Light. The song's refrain contains a vocal sample from Psycho Les' verse on "Off the Books" by The Beatnuts.
"No Escapin' This" is the only single from "Take It or Squeeze It" to chart, but it failed to appear on both the "Billboard" Hot 100 and Rhythmic Top 40 like prior singles. It reached #56 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks charts and #12 on the Hot Rap Singles chart, though, because of its "party and bullshit formula" and "percussive choral loop". Its popularity landed it on two Beatnuts hits compilations: "Beatnuts Forever" and "Classic Nuts, Vol. 1". It can additionally be found on two 2001 hip hop compilations: "Lovin' It: The Cream of R&B & UK Garage" and "Wrap It Up". Its music video was directed by Nzingha Stewart.

Criminal Justice (TV series)

Criminal Justice is a British television drama series produced by the BBC and first shown in 2008. Written by Peter Moffat, each five-episode series follows the journey of an individual through the justice system and was first broadcast over five successive nights on BBC One.
The first series, first shown in 2008, starred Ben Whishaw as Ben Coulter, a young man who is accused of murder after a drunken and drug-filled night out, though is unable to remember committing the crime. It was directed by Otto Bathurst and Luke Watson. In 2009, the second series featured Maxine Peake as troubled housewife Juliet Miller whose husband was stabbed in their bed. Yann Demange and Marc Jobst directed the second series.
The first series won two British Academy Television Awards for Best Drama Serial and Best Writer, three Royal Television Society Awards and an International Emmy.
Series one.
The first series was composed of five episodes, which were broadcast nightly from 30 June to 4 July 2008 on BBC One. The first series starred Ben Whishaw as Ben Coulter, a young man who is accused of murder after a drunken and drug-filled night out, though is unable to remember committing the crime. As well as Whishaw, the show starred Pete Postlethwaite, Con O'Neill, Lindsay Duncan, David Westhead, Ruth Negga and Bill Paterson.
Overview.
Ben Coulter takes his parents' black cab out for the night. At a traffic light, a young woman gets into the cab. Despite telling her he does not take fares, she insists on going to the seaside. While there, she offers Ben ecstasy, which he accepts. The pair go back to her house, and after sleeping together, Ben awakes downstairs, seeing a knife on the table at which he was sleeping. He goes upstairs to find the girl dead, with a stab wound to the chest.
Police stop Ben after he crashes the taxi in shock. They later find he matches a description given by a neighbour, who saw Ben break into the girl's house to wipe his DNA off the house. They also find a knife in Ben's pocket. He is arrested on suspicion of murder. He is later charged and refused bail.
Ben spends his first day in prison. He seeks protection from a feared inmate, after being beaten up by Milroy, a feared jailbird. In return for being protected, Ben must smuggle an item past the prison guard. He also re-employs his former lawyer. This episode sees the first appearance of Vineeta Rishi as Frances Kapoor. 
He shares his cell mostly with Hooch, who has the status of "Listener" in the prison. His advice and support to Ben are marred by his own limitations and ties. Finally he makes the sacrifice to open the path to Ben's release and his own absolution.
Ben's expensive new barrister persuades him to plead self-defence despite his misgivings, he then takes to the witness box before returning to prison and getting into a brawl. Ben's barrister, Frances Kapoor, appears to be the only person who believes Ben's pleas of innocence and so tries to free him. However, Ben's solicitor persuades him to appeal on the grounds of inappropriate relationship with his (female) barrister, therefore perhaps ruining Frances' career as a barrister. Ben is freed when CCTV evidence is eventually released, of a man who committed another murder in the area on the same night, chasing the girl Ben is accused of killing. Ben wants to withdraw the chamber's inquiry against Frances, but his solicitor says it is too late, as the ball was already rolling, and Ben should get on with his life.
Cast and crew.
The series was written by Peter Moffat, and produced by Pier Wilkie. Otto Bathurst directed the first three episodes, with Luke Watson directing the final two.
Reception.
The first series was generally praised by critics, "The Sunday Telegraph" calling it "nerve-shreddingly exciting". However, the series received complaints from lawyers and solicitors over the way they were portrayed over the five episodes - the character of Stone (played by Con O'Neill) being particularly controversial for his attitude, saying that, in the criminal justice system, "the truth can go to hell". 
Sally Kinnes of "The Sunday Times" wrote that "Criminal Justice" "takes the worn-out formula of the cop show and demonstrates there is something new to be said" and that the show offers an "inventive critique of the criminal justice system".
Jasper Rees of "The Times" calls "Criminal Justice" a "Great creation," though John Cooper says the series "fails to address the real dilemmas of the criminal justice system" and that there is "little excuse for implausible plot and dialogue". The same paper says the drama has "devastating performances and the stench of authenticity".
Series two.
A second series of the drama was commissioned by the BBC and was broadcast from 5–9 October 2009 as part of the BBC's autumn drama line-up. It returned with another five episodes, starring Maxine Peake as Juliet Miller. The series follows Juliet as she struggles to lead a normal life and, after stabbing her abusive husband, following her trail through the criminal justice system. Matthew Macfadyen plays Joe, a barrister at the height of his professional powers. He is married to Juliet who is fragile and isolated at home. They have one daughter, 13-year-old Ella, played by Alice Sykes. Other cast members include Sophie Okonedo, Denis Lawson, Steven MacKintosh, Eddie Marsan, Zoe Telford and Kate Hardie.
Overview.
Juliet prepares for her husband, Joe's, return from work. He arrives with flowers and greets wife and daughter but both seem jumpy. Unsettling clues as to what might be going on are revealed and that night, Juliet stabs Joe. She calls the emergency services but leaves the house and her daughter finds Joe seriously injured and removes the knife, before being instructed not to. The police and paramedics take Joe to hospital and Ella is taken to the police station. Juliet eventually arrives at the hospital where Joe is in intensive care and arrested. While in custody, she behaves abnormally, leading her solicitor to question her mental state but admits stabbing Joe in a second interview, without her solicitor.
Juliet's solicitor asks that Juliet be released on bail but this is refused due to fears of her absconding or attempting contact with Ella and/or Joe. Ella goes into emergency care but soon moves in with her best friend's family, suffering nightmares about the way she found Joe. She visits Juliet in prison but the visit only makes matters worse, thanks to Juliet's lack of remorse. Her solicitor tries to get Juliet to talk about her and Joe's marriage but get nowhere so her legal team try prompting her. They question if she was raped but that is revealed not to be the case and that she is pregnant. Only after Juliet gives birth to her second daughter and deemed a risk to the baby does she open up about her marriage. 
Joe's condition, meanwhile, worsens and he dies in hospital. Juliet is charged with murder but pleads not guilty, due to provocation. She is found not guilty after revealing the domestic abuse she suffered at Joe's hands but does, however, plead guilty to manslaughter.
Cast and crew.
Peter Moffat wrote the series, with Steve Lightfoot producing. Yann Demange directed the first three episodes, with Marc Jobst directing the final two.
Reception.
The second series also garnered a positive reception from critics. John Preston of "The Telegraph" praised the first episode for successfully ratcheting up the tension with "Hitchcockian precision", and how writer Peter Moffat allowed "the weight of the character's dilemmas to drive the narrative forward". He also acclaimed Maxine Peake's performance as a "marvel".
In "The Independent" Brian Viner hailed the serial as a "well written" and "superbly acted" drama, and noted Moffat's script as "particularly clever" in how it "manipulated sympathies".
Awards and nominations.

Kamothe is located on the Mumbai-Pune Expressway at a less than one hour drive from the heart of Mumbai city. It is the third node (Panvel being 1st and Khandeshwar being 2nd) which lies after Mumbai-Pune Express Highway, when you drive down from Pune. The area started developing from 2000 and now it has number of ready and under construction projects both in the commercial and residential segments.
Introduction.
Navi Mumbai is envisaged as a metro sized counter magnet to reduce the pressure on the Mumbai metropolis. It is planned as a polycentric new town with a series of nodal concentrations along mass transport corridors. When fully built, it is expected to have 14 such townships with a combined population holding capacity of four millions and one million jobs.
Location.
The site of Kamothe adjoins the Central Business District of Belapur (CBD Belapur) of Navi Mumbai and is surrounded by Kharghar in its north, Taloja in north-east, Kalamboli in its east and Panvel in its south. The western region of Kamothe is a wet land area with enormous mangroves.
Characteristics.
Kamothe is divided into 48 Sectors. Though these sectors are not placed evenly, they are systematic and are in a planned manner. Each sector has its own information map. Kamothe is one of the slum-free and modern node of Navi Mumbai.
Infrastructure.
With Rs 40,000 million (US $ 1140 million) worth of basic infrastructure already in place, Navi Mumbai is ready, willing and able to absorb the imminent, large scale shift of population, business, commerce and non pollutant industry from Mumbai and elsewhere. Kamothe has large network of wide roads.
There is no water scarcity in Kamothe and water supply is usually for 24 hours in some areas. Landlines are also well established for communication purpose.

Kamothe boasts of number of ready and under-construction projects both in the commercial and residential segments. Bhoomi Homes, Manas are some of the oldest residential complexes of Kamothe.
The upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport near Kamothe has boomed the real estate of Kamothe on new heights.
There are a number of premium residential projects sprung up in Kamothe. CIDCO also has plans to build shopping malls which should make the town one of the better locations in Navi Mumbai. It also attempts to put Navi Mumbai on international map.
Transportation.
Kamothe is located on the outskirts of Mumbai. It lies in what is commonly regarded as the Konkan part of Maharashtra and fall in Raigad district.
Train: Kamothe has two railway stations Mansarovar and Khandeshwar that lie on the harbour line, a part of Mumbai suburban railways. It takes 71 minutes from Mumbai CST (छत्रपति शिवाजी टर्मिनस) for a local to reach Mansarovar and 74 minutes to Khandeshwar. 
Bus: Roads here are very well developed. The new wide road that connects Mansarovar and Khandeshwar railway stations has become operational. Auto rickshaws provide the primary means of personal local transportation. They ply from Mansarovar railway station to the Mumbai-Pune Expressway. These auto rickshaws also serve share-rickshaw facility.
NMMT and ST buses serve as a much cheaper means of transportation over a long distance to various nodes through Navi Mumbai. Buses starting from Panvel halt at Kamothe bus stop on the highway allowing passengers direct and fast passage to destinations across Mumbai, Thane and Navi Mumbai. A NMMT bus stand is coming up near Mansarovar railway station.

Utenti Pubblicità Associati

Utenti Pubblicità Associati (UPA) is the Italian Advertisers' Association based in Milan.
History.
Utenti Pubblicità Associati (UPA) was founded in 1948 to represent the interests of Italian advertisers. The association engages actively and proactively with industry, political, legislative and regulatory bodies, while helping its members enhance the effectiveness of their advertising through a range of services. These currently include free consultancy, market monitoring data and surveys from a variety of media research companies that are either owned or supported by UPA.
The Association is a member of the World Federation of Advertisers (WFA), supports the Italian Advertising Self-Regulation Institute and sponsors the University Ca’ Foscari of Venice Master in Business Communications.
The UPA's Board and active members include the directors of many of Italy's leading companies and multinationals.
Much of the groundwork for the UPA's recent achievements was laid by Giulio Malgara, its President from 1984 to 2007 and currently President of Quaker Europe and Chairman and Managing Director of the bakery products company Malgara Chiari Forti SpA. Malgara was particularly influential in giving the UPA a strong research basis, founding the television audience research company Auditel in 1984.
Recent developments.
Lorenzo Sassoli de Bianchi, the founder of Italy's leading health food company, Valsoia, and President of the Bologna Museum of Modern Art (MAMbo), took over from Malgara in June 2007. Widely-respected by Italian industrialists for Valsoia's use of cross-media advertising and his personal skills as a communicator and consensus-builder, Sassoli de Bianchi was appointed President on a modernising agenda. Acting in the participative style for which he is renowned and applying the methodology he developed at Valsoia, Sassoli de Bianchi immediately worked with the organisation's active members to formulate a clear mission statement and objectives, as well as to restructure the governance of the association and to increase participation, accountability, innovation and transparency. 
The projects launched under this programme include a research centre, initiatives to promote regional representation and national growth, and an extensive series of services and strategic partnerships to help members orientate themselves with respect to the complex and rapidly-changing social, regulatory and technological developments in modern advertising. 
Lorenzo Sassoli de Bianchi was reappointed President of the UPA for a further 3 years in 2009.
As well as playing a lobbying and educating role, the UPA adopts a proactive partnership approach in its dealings with the government, legal and regulatory authorities, advertising agencies and the media, supported by issuing regular trend reports and analyses. These initiatives have consolidated the already influential role, profile and authority of the UPA, which organised a large international conference held in Rome in March 2009.

The Trio is a 1973 live album by Oscar Peterson, Joe Pass and Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen.

Reception.
In his Allmusic review, critic Scott Yanow complimented the playing of Pass and Pedersen, but wrote "the reason to acquire this set is for the remarkable Oscar Peterson. The pianist brilliantly investigates several jazz styles... Peterson really flourished during his years with Norman Granz's Pablo label, and this was one of his finest recordings of the period."

Maidstone-on-the-Potomac

Maidstone-on-the-Potomac is a historic house and farm near Falling Waters, West Virginia. Located on the Potomac River immediately opposite Williamsport, Maryland, the property consists of a tract with a main house dating from c. 1741. The house was built by Evan Watkins, who operated Watkins Ferry on the Potomac, which was used by George Washington and General Edward Braddock.
In 1795 the property was sold to Peter Light. The Light family retained the property until 1854, substantially expanding the house. The ferry and house, by now known as Light's Ferry passed to Robert Lemen, who converted the ferry into a cable ferry.
In 1861 the ferry was used by Union forces under Captain Abner Doubleday to cross into Virginia for raids. In 1863 Doubleday again crossed the river by fording while pursuing Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia as it advanced on Gettysburg. A month later, following Lee's defeat, 70,000 confederate soldiers crossed at Lemen's Ferry.
In the late 19th century the first bridge crossing was built at this location. Today, US 11 crosses here, bisecting the property.
The Watkins Family also became associated with the Boone Family during the time of their ownership of the Ferry. A great-great grandson, John Watkins (His father John T Watkins was born at Watkins Ferry), of the original Evan Watkins married Elizabeth Karn, a 1st and 2nd cousin of Daniel Boone's. Elizabeth was the daughter of Christopher Karn and Leah Boone.
John and Elizabeth's son Christopher Columbus Watkins married Rachel Bristow who was the granddaughter of Leah's sister, Hannah Boone.
Fire.
Maidstone-on-the-Potomac was damaged in a fire of suspicious origin the night of March 7, 2009, one of several similar fires in Berkeley County, West Virginia and Washington County, Maryland in a short span of days.

Opera Carolina

Opera Carolina is a professional opera company located in Charlotte, North Carolina. Founded in 1948 by the Charlotte Music Club as the Charlotte Opera Association, the company was renamed Opera Carolina after its 1986 merger with North Carolina Opera which combined the main stage, educational, and touring operations of the two companies. Its past leadership has included Artistic Directors Richard Marshall and Charles Rosekrans, and General Director James Wright. Since 2000, Opera Carolina has been under the direction of General Director and Principal Conductor James Meena.
Opera Carolina is a member of Opera America and is supported by the Arts and Science Council of Charlotte-Mecklenburg, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the North Carolina Arts Council. Opera Carolina presents three main stage productions, featuring the Opera Carolina Chorus and the Charlotte Symphony Orchestra, in the Belk Theater located in the Blumenthal Performing Arts Center. Opera Carolina also presented an annual Valentine's Day Concert, Love Notes, from 2008 to 2010 held at Dana Auditorium, Queen's University and at the Knight Theater in its final year. Opera Carolina's season begins in October and runs until mid April.
Opera Carolina has remained solvent during the recession, which began in 2008, while other opera companies of similar size have closed their doors. The company has achieved this through discontinuing the Love Notes concert, reducing the season to three main productions, reduction in staff, and inreased frugality in production costs. Also, Opera Carolina enjoys sustained corporate and private charitable support.
