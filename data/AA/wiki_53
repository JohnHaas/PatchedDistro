Record of Lodoss War

Origins.
"Record of Lodoss War" was created in 1986 by Group SNE as a "Dungeons & Dragons" "replay" serialized in the Japanese magazine "Comptiq". Replays are not novels, but transcripts of RPG sessions, meant to both hold the interest of readers and convey the events that took place. They have proven to be popular, even to those who do not play role-playing games but are fans of fiction (including fantasy fiction). Similar to light novels, many characters and parties in replays have become popular as characters of anime. An example of such a character is the female elf Deedlit in "Record of Lodoss War", who was played by science fiction novelist Hiroshi Yamamoto during the RPG sessions.
The popularity of the "Record of Lodoss War" replays was such that the Dungeon Master Ryo Mizuno started to adapt the story into some of the earliest Japanese-language domestic high fantasy novels in 1988.
When the replay series went on to become a trilogy, Group SNE had to abandon the "Dungeons & Dragons" rules and create their own game, dubbed "Record of Lodoss War Companion" and released in 1989. All three parts of the replay series were eventually published as paperbacks by Kadokawa Shoten from 1989 to 1991:
The last volume of Mizuno's novelization was published by Kadokawa Shoten in 1993, and followed by two collections of short stories in 1995:
The first volume forms the basis for the first eight episodes of the "Record of Lodoss War" OVA series, as well as the "Record of Lodoss War: The Grey Witch " manga series. The second was also adapted in manga form, and as a four-CD radio drama. The final five episodes of the OVA series are loosely based on the story told across the third and fourth novels and, having caught up with the ongoing novelization at that point, feature an original ending. The "Record of Lodoss War: Chronicles of the Heroic Knight" TV series is a more faithful adaptation of volumes three to seven. The first collection of short stories was adapted into the "Record of Lodoss War: Deedlit's Tale" manga series.
Mizuno later went on to pen two new series of novels: a prequel titled (1994 to 2002) and a sequel titled (1998 to 2006), the first of which forms the basis for the "Record of Lodoss War: The Lady of Pharis" manga series.
Characters.
The manga (and its anime derivative) "Record of Lodoss War" centers around the adventures of a youth by the name of Parn, the son of a dishonored knight. Part of his motivation for adventuring is to find out what happened to his father, and to restore his family's honor. Despite his inexperience, Parn is considered the leader, who is accompanied by his childhood best friend Etoh, his friend and sometimes advisor Slayn (and later on Slayn's lover Leylia), and his newfound mentor Ghim. They are accompanied by Parn's romantic interest, the high elf Deedlit, who comes from the Forest of No Return seeking an answer to her people's isolationism and an end to what she sees as a slow march to extinction and a thief named Woodchuck. Throughout the series, Parn comes into contact with friends and foes alike. His allies include King Kashue, King Fahn, Shiris, and Orson; his enemies include Emperor Beld, Ashram, and the evil necromancer Wagnard.
The manga and its anime derivative Chronicles of the Heroic Knight continues the adventures of Parn for the first eight episodes, but then centers around Spark and his adventures to complete a quest tasked onto him to protect Neese, the daughter of Slayn and Leylia. He is accompanied by his own cast of friends in the form of Leaf, Garrack, Greevus, Aldo, and Ryna. The television series shares similarities with the plot of the OVA, such as Wagnard seeking to kidnap Neese in order to use her as a reagent for the resurrection of Naneel, a priestess and the Avatar of Kardis who was slain by Leylia's mother, the high priestess Neese a short time after the battle with the demonic god. Leylia was the reincarnation of Naneel, but when she lost her virginity she was no longer capable of being the doorway or reagent needed to unseal Naneel.
The third series, "Legend of Crystania", places the former villain Ashram into the seat of a would-be hero who is placed under a spell by a "god beast" of Crystania. The series then centers around Pirotess, his dark elven lover, as she tries to find a way to free him from the clutches of the spell and to restore him back to his living self.

The following is a timeline of the events as they take place in the original events surrounding "Record of Lodoss War", and is derived from the replays and manga. All events are measured on the "NRC" (New Royal Calendar) as used on the continent of Alecrast.

Home video releases.
The original OVA series and the TV series had both been released in North America through Central Park Media on VHS and on DVD. The OVA and TV series were slated for a Blu-ray release through Media Blasters, but they have now dropped all plans to re-release the series.
Lodoss Online.
The Japanese online game company GameOn announced that it acquired the global license to make an online game for computers and mobile phones based on the Record of Lodoss War fantasy franchise from Kadokawa Production and Slowcurve. Ryo Mizuno, the novelist and co-creator of the franchise, will serve as a supervisor on the development of the online game. GameOn plans to release the game outside of Japan. GameOn also said that the new game will not be browser-based.

About a Girl (The Academy Is song)

"About a Girl" is the first single by The Academy Is... from their third studio album, "Fast Times at Barrington High". The single reached the pop charts at #88, making it the band's first charting single and this song was ranked #74 on MTV latinoamerica list of the Top 100 Hits of 2008. This song was number 39 on "Rolling Stone"'s list of the 100 Best Songs of 2008. It has been noted that the chorus shares a similar melody to that of a-ha's hit single "Take on Me".
Music video.
The video for the single revolves around William Beckett and his bandmates in high school. Beckett has it made; he has the girl, the friends and the popularity. However, this turns out to just be a daydream; his sole friends at school are his bandmates and the girl (played by American model Brittany Moser) is in a relationship with a jock football player. Throughout the course of the video, Beckett dreams of having the girl until finally, they embrace and drive off in what appears to be another one of his daydreams. However, this daydream is revealed to be that of the girl's, longing for Beckett though trapped in a relationship with another guy (played by American male model James Ellis). Beckett and she exchange eye contact, creating a possible future for the two. 
This music video was created as a spoof of "Fast Times at Ridgemont High". The iconic daydream sequence in the film may have influenced the theme of the video. It was filmed at Van Nuys High School in Los Angeles, California, which was also the location where "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" was shot.

The Red Willow Creek is a tributary of the Republican River in Nebraska. The name is reported to be a mistranslation of the Dakota Indian name "Chanshasha Wakpala," which literally means Red Dogwood Creek. The Dakota referred to the creek as such because of an abundance of the red dogwood shrub that grew along the banks. Its stem and branches are deep red in color, and it is favored in basket making.

GEM Impact

GEM Impact is an audio production studio founded by game composer and saxophonist Norihiko Hibino in 2005. It is located in Tokyo, Japan, and employs a number of composers, producers, and artists. Hibino’s fluency in English has allowed him to take the GEM Impact brand to a worldwide platform, which is the basis for the studio’s motto: “From Japan to worldwide.”
The studio employs a number of composers, including Norihiko Hibino himself, Takahiro Izutani, Yoshitaka Suzuki, and Takahide Ayuzawa. They have often made use of the talents of artist Uetake MacARTHUR for their graphical needs.
While Norihiko Hibino is well known for his contributions to the Metal Gear Solid series, many were left wondering what role GEM Impact had on the score for "", as their contributions were not publicized. Hibino later revealed via an interview with Original Sound Version that GEM Impact in fact provided 90 minutes of music for the cinematic sequences in the game.
GEM Impact operates alongside GEM Factory, an in-house record label that has released two albums including The Outer Rim and the Ninja Blade Original Soundtrack. Vanilla Mood, a night club in Japan, was also operated under GEM Impact, but closed at the end of 2008.
On September 2, 2008, FromSoftware announced the ninja action title, "Ninja Blade", and named Norihiko Hibino and GEM Impact as the composers for the title. The team has already completed the music for the title, totaling close to three hours of original music. Hibino noted in a preview article at Original Sound Version that he believes this project represents the studio's greatest achievement to date, and it is a landmark for the studio. On February 10, 2009, it was announced that the group would work alongside Platinum Games sound director Masami Ueda and composer Hiroshi Yamaguchi on the company's action title "Bayonetta".

Treaty of Lyck

The Treaty of Lyck was a treaty between Vytautas the Great, future Grand Duke of Lithuania, and the Teutonic Knights, represented by Marquard von Salzbach, "komtur" Arnold von Bürglen, and Thomas, son of Lithuanian duke Survila. It was signed on January 19, 1390 in Lyck (now Ełk, Poland). Vytautas, in exchange for a military alliance against his cousin Jogaila during the Lithuanian Civil War (1389–1392), agreed to cede Samogitia up to the Nevėžis River and become the Order's vassal. In essence Vytautas confirmed the Treaty of Königsberg (1384) that he had signed with the Knights during the Lithuanian Civil War (1381–1384). Once betrayed, the Knights now asked for hostages as a guarantee of Vytautas' loyalty. The Order demanded as hostages his two brothers Sigismund and Tautvilas, wife Anna, daughter Sophia, sister Rymgajla, brother-in-law Ivan Olshanski, and a number of other nobles.
Vytautas initiated the negotiations when he failed to capture Vilnius, capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. He sent Marquard von Salzbach and the Count of Rheineck, two knights held captive since 1384, to negotiate on his behalf. The treaty was signed in secret as not to alert Jogaila and his brother Skirgaila. The Knights managed to convince Skirgaila that they were ready to negotiate peace with him, and he even returned from Polotsk to Vilnius anticipating the Teutonic envoy.
The Treaty of Lyck was strengthened by the Treaty of Königsberg (1390), signed between the Knights and a Samogitian delegation, which promised its loyalty to the "Samogitian king" Vytautas. The Knights helped Vytautas to wage a war against Jogaila, but the cousins reconciled in 1392 and signed the Ostrów Agreement. The Knights were once again betrayed: Vytautas burned three of their castles and did not cede Samogitia. They continued to wage war until the Treaty of Salynas of 1398; territorial disputes over Samogitia dragged until the Treaty of Melno of 1422.

Allstadt House and Ordinary

The Allstadt House and Ordinary was built about 1790 on land owned by the Lee family near Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, including Phillip Ludwell Lee, Richard Bland Lee and Henry Lee III. The house at the crossroads was sold to the Jacob Allstadt family of Berks County, Pennsylvania in 1811. Allstadt operated an ordinary, or tavern in the house, and a tollgate on the Harpers Ferry-Charles Town Turnpike, while he resided farther down the road in a stone house. The house was enlarged by the Allstadts c. 1830. The house remained in the family until the death of John Thomas Allstadt in 1923, the last survivor of John Brown's Raid.
The property was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.
John Brown's Raid.
The house's chief historic significance came in 1859, when John Brown launched his raid on Harpers Ferry. Brown ordered a detachment of his forces under John Cook to go to Beall-Air and take hostage the owner, Colonel Lewis Washington, and three of his slaves. On their return to Harpers Ferry with Washington the party stopped at Allstadt's and took Allstadt, his son John Thomas, and seven slaves prisoner. All survived the siege and liberation.
Description.
The property comprises a small complex of buildings. The main Allstadt House ("c." 1790) is a two-story L-shaped structure with a central brick chimney, built of nogging; stuccoed brick between timber uprights. The present structure was expanded from a -story house c. 1830. The original interior comprises only two rooms on the ground floor, each with Georgian period mantels. The upstairs portion comprises two rooms and a hall., with one fireplace. Windows are 6-over-6 double-hung sashes. A one-story kitchen was originally a separate building, now attached by a connecting room, probably at the time the second floor was added. A porch was added on the east side c. 1930, since removed.
A separate two-story stone building was built c. 1830, with a two-tiered porch on the south side leading to two rooms on each level. The attic is a finished, plastered room, accessible by a ladder.
A nearby stone bank barn also dates to the 1830 period. The barn was used as a stable for the tavern's customers. The barn's overhang is supported by unusual chamfered stone piers.
The Allstadt Cemetery is also nearby, serving as the central burial place for the extended family. Graves span the period 1821 to 1880, including the grave of five Russell family infants who may have died of diphtheria.

The group has performed at the House of Blues in Walt Disney World, Hard Rock Live at Universal Studios Florida and has opened for Molly Hatchet, among other acts. He is the grandson of the late boxing hall-of-famer Eddie Futch.
Northwest Airlines incident.
On June 14, 2009, Futch was en route to a show in Ft. Wayne, Indiana on Northwest Airlines flight 2363 from Detroit, Michigan. During that time, baggage handlers damaged his double-necked mountain dulcimer. Encouraged by fans to write a song about the incident, and after seeing Dave Carroll's "United Breaks Guitars" on YouTube, Futch penned "Only A Northwest Song" on July 10, 2009 and posted it to the service, hoping it would help to avoid a "lengthy reimbursement battle." Within a day of the video's posting, Northwest Airlines contacted Futch to offer their apologies along with compensation.
Question on Jeopardy!
On February 16, 2011, during the finale of a three-day Jeopardy! pitting returning champs Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter against IBM's Supercomputer Watson, Futch's name appeared as one of three possible questions for the answer "Nearly 10 million YouTubers saw Dave Carroll's clip called 'this friendly skies' airline 'breaks guitars.'" Watson offered up "United Airlines" with an 81% probability of being correct, "United Breaks Guitars" was the second choice with a probability of 13% and "Futch" was the third choice with a probability of 7%.

Reepham railway station (Lincolnshire)

Reepham railway station was a railway station in Reepham, Lincolnshire which opened in 1848 and closed in 1965. It was located a few miles east of Lincoln. It should not be confused with Whitwell & Reepham railway station or Reepham railway station, both in Norfolk. The line is still in use.
The station's building is now a private residence. The former coal yard and sidings are occupied by two bungalows. There is no trace of the platforms which were located either side of the level crossing, the staggered layout being typical of the company that built the line. The manual signal box and crossing gates were removed a few years ago and replaced by barriers. They are controlled by the still manned signal box at Langworth further up the line towards Market Rasen, the next still-in-use station on the line. The removal of the manned signal box has resulted in much longer waiting times for road traffic and pedestrians since the control was moved to Langworth. Up to closure the station was used by grammar school pupils to go to De Aston School in Market Rasen. There are occasional calls for the station to be re-opened. It was the only village station on the line which was actually in the village. Most others being a few miles outside the villages from which the stations took their names.
The line links Newark North Gate/Newark Castle-Lincoln Central-Grimsby-Cleethorpes. A couple of miles east of the village is the Welton Oil field where a gathering station is located and the oil is tanked for transportation making the line very busy for freight.

Glitz and Glamour EP

Glitz and Glamour is the debut EP from Las Vegas, Nevada-based alternative rock band The Cab.
History.
In an interview with AbsolutePunk, vocalist Alexander DeLeon had this to say about the EP:
"When we wrote the "Glitz and Glamour" EP, I had only been singing for a few weeks. I was just the guitar player before and had never sung in my life and Cash, our bassist, told me to sing because he liked my voice. At the time I was embarrassed and thought he was crazy, but it seemed to have turned out pretty well. The songs on the "Glitz" EP are so old and even though they hold a special place in our hearts because those were some of the first songs we wrote."
Availability.
The EP was self-released by the band, and it is now very rare and out of print. The only way to listen to the tracks is to download them from a file sharing service. It was well received by fans, who had been eagerly anticipating a release to accompany the songs on the band's MySpace.
Sound.
The band's sound has changed since the release of this EP, and the band acknowledges this change. Many fans like the sound from "Glitz" better than the band's LP, "Whisper War", but the band realizes they had to mature at some point. Alex DeLeon had this to say about the change in the band's sound:
"(We) have definitely grown from (the "Glitz" songs) and our music now is much different. Since then, us and our old guitarist have also gone our separate ways. We are now more soulful and poppy, I think I have finally found my niche and groove in this band and with the songs. Although, the new stuff is way different from our older material, I think that our old fans will still dig it. Like I said before, we just play the music we love and feel and hopefully people like it half as much as we do. I have been listening to a lot of Brian McKnight, Maroon 5, Joss Stone, Justin Timberlake, Stevie Wonder, and Robin Thicke lately."

Oyler v. Boles

Oyler v. Boles, , was a case heard by the Supreme Court of the United States.
Syllabus.
A West Virginia habitual criminal statute provided for a mandatory life sentence upon the third conviction "of a crime punishable by confinement in a penitentiary." The increased penalty is to be invoked by an information filed by the prosecuting attorney "immediately upon conviction and before sentence." In such proceedings, in which they were represented by counsel and did not request continuances or raise any matters in defense, but did concede the applicability of the statute to the circumstances of their cases, petitioners were sentenced to life imprisonment. Subsequently they petitioned the state supreme court (the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia) for writs of habeas corpus, alleging that the Act had been applied without advance notice and to only a minority of those subject to its provisions, in violation of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Their petitions were denied by the court.
The Supreme Court held that:
The Supreme Court affirmed, 5-4. Associate Justice Tom C. Clark wrote the opinion of the court, and was joined by Justices Felix Frankfurter, Charles Evans Whittaker, Potter Stewart, and John Marshall Harlan II. Harlan wrote a separate concurring opinion. Justice William O. Douglas wrote the dissenting opinion, joined by Chief Justice Earl Warren and Justices William J. Brennan, Jr. and Hugo Black.

Southern Methodist University football scandal

The Southern Methodist University football scandal (also known as Ponygate) was an incident in which the football program at Southern Methodist University was investigated and punished for massive violations of NCAA rules and regulations. The most serious violation was the maintenance of a slush fund used for "under the table" payments to players from the mid-1970s through 1986. This culminated in the NCAA handing down the so-called "death penalty" by canceling SMU's entire 1987 schedule. SMU was allowed to return for an abbreviated 1988 season, but opted to sit that season out as well after school officials determined it would be impossible to field a viable team.
The severity of the penalty left the SMU football program in ruin. The Mustangs had only one winning season over the next 20 years and failed to make another bowl game until 2009. To date, it is one of the most severe penalties ever imposed on a Division I program, and the only time the NCAA has canceled a football-playing school's entire season at any level.
Background.
The SMU Mustangs had won the 1935 national championship (as determined by the Dickinson System), 10 Southwest Conference titles, and had attended 11 bowl games. They also had numerous All-Americans including a Heisman Trophy winner (Doak Walker in 1949). From 1980 to 1984, SMU enjoyed its most successful era since the late 1940s and early 1950s. They posted a record of 45-5-1 and won three Southwest Conference titles. They nearly won their second national title in 1982, when they finished the season as the only undefeated team in the nation. However, the team lost its shot at a title when it settled for a tie against Arkansas in the last game of the season in order to lock up the conference title and a spot in the Cotton Bowl, rather than risk a two-point conversion that could have won the contest. For most of the first half of the 1980s, the Mustangs played at Texas Stadium, then the home of the NFL's Dallas Cowboys.
SMU was the second-smallest school in the Southwest Conference (only Rice was smaller) and one of the smallest in Division I-A, with a total enrollment of just over 9,000 students in 1986. From the 1950s onward, SMU found it difficult to compete against schools that were double (or more) its size. Prior to the 1980s, SMU had tallied only nine winning seasons since 1949. The effort to keep up with the bigger Southwest Conference schools resulted in SMU straying very close to the ethical line and in many cases going over it. While SMU was not the only SWC school to be sanctioned for recruiting violations— in fact, at one point five of the conference's nine member schools were on some form of probation— SMU's violations seemed to be the most egregious. According to the 2010 ESPN documentary film "Pony Excess", many of these violations took place with the full knowledge of school administrators.
As a result of their attempts to compete with the larger schools in the SWC, SMU's football program was under nearly constant scrutiny from the NCAA from 1974 onward. SMU was placed on probation five times between 1974 and 1985, and had been slapped with probation seven times overall—more than any other school. 
Sean Stopperich.
The most recent probation came as the result of an investigation into the recruiting practices of several assistant coaches and team boosters. Sean Stopperich, an offensive lineman from Pennsylvania who was part of the 1983 recruiting class and who had initially given an oral commitment to the University of Pittsburgh Panthers, told investigators that he and his family had received several thousand dollars from SMU boosters and assistant coaches to renege on that commitment and sign with the Mustangs. Stopperich would later go on to drop out of SMU after suffering a series of injuries which ended his football career, as well as a desire to return home to the Pittsburgh area.
SMU, which had just come off of a season that saw them finish eighth in the country and win the Aloha Bowl against Notre Dame, was banned from bowl games for 1985 and 1986 and was also kicked off live television for 1986. It appeared that the sanctions had some effect on the Mustangs. They struggled to a 6-5 record in 1985 after entering the season ranked third in the AP Poll. Things didn't get much better in 1986, a season that saw the Mustangs lose four of their final five games after a 5-1 start which saw them ranked as high as #18. And even though SMU had already started to drop back, the bad situation was about to get much worse for the university. 
David Stanley.
In June 1986, John Sparks, a producer at the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex's ABC affiliate, WFAA-TV, received a tip about further wrongdoing at SMU. Sparks' investigation eventually led him to David Stanley, a member of the same recruiting class that included Sean Stopperich. Stanley had played linebacker for SMU during the 1983 and 1984 seasons, but due to a substance abuse problem he was kicked off the team. Stanley tried to convince SMU to allow him to finish his degree but university administrators ruled against him and his scholarship was rescinded. 
Sparks and WFAA's sports director, Dale Hansen, decided to follow up on the tip and brought the former Mustang in to speak with them regarding this newest set of allegations of impropriety by SMU. Stanley claimed that SMU athletic officials paid him $25,000 to sign with SMU in 1983 and continued to pay him monthly while he played for the Mustangs. If these claims were proven true, this would have meant that SMU was still paying players after assuring the NCAA that payments had stopped. 
More ominously, a new set of rules had been put in place that would have jeopardized the future of the program. Earlier in 1986 the NCAA had called an emergency meeting in New Orleans to deal with a rash of violations that had been uncovered in the late 1970s and early 1980s. At that meeting, the NCAA Council implemented several new rules to combat the problem. Among the decisions made at that meeting was to reinforce the NCAA's power to shut down athletic programs found guilty of egregious violations--a power popularly known as "the death penalty." The new bylaw stated that if a school had been found guilty of two major violations within five years, it could be barred from competing in the sport involved in the second violation for up to two years. In cases where the so-called "death penalty" was warranted for a so-called "repeat violator," the NCAA now had to either hand down the penalty or explain why it chose not to do so. (It should be noted that three SWC schools--SMU, Houston, and Texas--voted against the new guidelines; at the time Houston, like SMU, was being investigated for paying players and Texas had been penalized twice for major violations in the previous decade.)
WFAA was taking a calculated risk in investigating SMU, as the school's alumni had long dominated Dallas' business and social scene. For example, the "Dallas Times Herald" suffered serious losses in advertising revenue when it broke the Stopperich story. Though the paper was vindicated when SMU was placed on probation, the "Times Herald" was already struggling to maintain competition with its rival paper, "The Dallas Morning News", and the backlash caused even more damage that eventually led to the paper's folding after "Morning News" owner A.H. Belo Corporation purchased it in 1991. 
Coincidentally, A.H. Belo also owned WFAA. Thus, the company was taking a large and calculated risk in investigating SMU. If SMU's alumni chose to retaliate in the same manner as they had with the "Times Herald", Belo risked losing twice as much advertising revenue, if not more, due to the dual ownership of the newspaper and television station Nonetheless, Sparks and Hansen pressed on, as they had concrete evidence of further wrongdoing. 
On October 27, Hansen confronted athletic director Bob Hitch, head coach Bobby Collins and recruiting coordinator Henry Lee Parker with Stanley's allegations. Hitch, Collins, and Parker denied everything, as Hansen had expected. Hansen then produced several envelopes that had been allegedly sent to Stanley and his family with money inside. One of the envelopes was particularly implicating as it had come directly from the recruiting office with Parker's initials, HLP, printed in black ink on the upper left corner. When Hansen showed Parker the envelope he initially said it was sent by him, but after a second Parker paused to put his reading glasses on and perused the envelope again. This time he backtracked, claiming that the handwriting on the envelope was not his and that someone else had printed his initials on it. Hansen later said this was the moment where he "had him", as he had not specified to Parker what would have been in the envelope and therefore had no need to cover his tracks as he did. To confirm that Parker was lying, Hansen consulted a handwriting expert. After showing her a sample of Parker's writing and the envelope, the expert said that there was no doubt that the initials were written by Parker. She further stated she would affirm it in court. 
On November 12, 1986, Hansen's report was aired as part of a 40-minute post-news special on WFAA. The report also revealed that Stanley had also talked to the NCAA, and that an NCAA investigation was well under way.
Two days later, the "Morning News" revealed that starting tight end Albert Reese was living rent-free in a Dallas apartment. The rent was being paid by George Owen, one of the boosters who had been banned from the athletic program for his role in the events leading up to the 1985 probation. Reese was suspended for the last two games of the season pending an investigation.
Slush fund.
On November 19, 1986, 200 professors submitted a petition calling for the end of "quasi-professional athletics" at SMU—including a ban on athletic scholarships. SMU Board of Governors Chairman Bill Clements, who had just been elected to a second non-consecutive term as Governor of Texas (having been defeated by Mark White for reelection in 1982) and was departing the university, announced that the school would tighten its admissions standards for all athletes. He also said that school officials would drop football entirely if necessary to restore the school's integrity.
Eventually, the NCAA investigation revealed that in 1985 and 1986, 13 players had been paid a total of $61,000 from a slush fund provided by a booster. Payments ranged from $50 to $725 per month and had started only a month after SMU had been handed its latest probation. The "Times Herald" later identified the booster as Dallas real-estate developer Sherwood Blount, Jr., who played for the Mustangs from 1969 to 1971 (though according to Parker, other boosters were almost certainly involved). The players had received a total of $47,000 during the 1985-86 school year. Eight of those players were paid an additional $14,000 from September to December 1986. The slush fund was due to be discontinued when the 13 players had all left the school. These payments were made with the full knowledge and approval of athletic department staff. According to the "Morning News", Hitch knew about the existence of a slush fund as early as 1981 and was involved in the decision to continue the payments even after SMU was placed on probation in 1985. The "Morning News" also said Collins knew certain players were being paid, but did not know who they were.
Two months after being sworn in as governor, Clements admitted that he had learned about the slush fund in 1984. An investigation by the board of governors revealed players had been paid to play since the mid-1970s. According to Clements, the board secretly agreed to phase out the fund at the end of the 1986 season, since the members felt duty-bound to honor previous commitments to players who had already been promised payments. A 1987 investigation by the College of Bishops of the United Methodist Church revealed that Clements had met with Hitch in 1985, and the two agreed that despite the probation, the payments had to continue because the football program had "a payroll to meet." 
At least two NFL players were identified as receiving payments—New England Patriots running back Reggie Dupard and Tampa Bay Buccaneers cornerback Rod Jones. A third player, wide receiver Ron Morris, was drafted by the Chicago Bears. By the end of the 1986 season, according to the "Times Herald", only three of the 13 players still had eligibility remaining.
Soon afterward, school president L. Donald Shields resigned; Hitch and Collins followed suit a few days later. According to the United Methodist Church investigation, Hitch, Collins and Parker were each paid $850,000 to maintain their silence on the matter.
The "death penalty".
The nature of the violations led to speculation about the possibility of SMU receiving the "death penalty." The revelations came at a time of great concern over the integrity of college sports.
On February 6, 1987, SMU's faculty athletics representative, religious studies professor Lonnie Kliever, delivered a report to the NCAA which recommended an extension of the school's probation an additional four years, until 1990. During this period, the school would be allowed to hire only six assistant coaches, and only four of them would be allowed to participate in off-campus recruiting. It also recommended that the school's ban from bowl games and live TV be extended until 1989. During those two seasons, SMU proposed dropping two non-conference games from its schedule. SMU's cooperation so impressed the enforcement staff that it recommended that the Infractions Committee accept SMU's proposed penalties, with the exception of a ban on non-conference play for two years.
The committee, however, decided to take a different track. On February 25, the committee voted unanimously to cancel SMU's entire 1987 football season and all four of SMU's scheduled home games in 1988. The committee praised SMU for cooperating with the investigation, saying that Kliever's efforts "went far beyond what could fairly be expected of a single faculty athletics representative." It also praised SMU's stated intent to operate within the rules when it returned to the field. This cooperation saved SMU from the full "death penalty"; had this happened, SMU would have had its football program shut down until 1989 and would have also lost its right to vote at NCAA conventions until 1990. However, it said that it felt compelled to impose the "death penalty" in order to "eliminate a program that was built on a legacy of wrongdoing, deceit and rule violations." SMU's record, the committee said, was "nothing short of abysmal," and the school had made no effort to reform itself over the past decade. The committee also found that SMU had gained a "great competitive advantage" over its opponents as a result of its cheating, and the "death penalty" was one way of rectifying this advantage.
David Berst, the chairman of the Infractions Committee, said years later that the Mustang football program was so riddled with corruption that "there simply didn't seem to be any options left." Several members of the committee that imposed the sanctions later said that when the NCAA first enacted the "repeat violator" rules, it never anticipated that there would ever be a situation meriting a "death penalty." However, they said their investigation of SMU revealed a program completely out of control. The director of enforcement for the NCAA at the time was Dan Beebe.
Penalties.
The penalties handed down, in detail:
No football in 1988.
As a result of the "death penalty," a full release was granted to every player on the team, allowing them to transfer to another school without losing any eligibility; most immediately announced they were considering going elsewhere. As soon as the NCAA announced its decision, hundreds of recruiters from 80 universities—including such powerhouses as Penn State, Oklahoma, and Alabama—traveled to SMU in hopes of persuading players to transfer to their schools.
Combined with the year-plus ban on off-campus recruiting, this led to speculation that SMU's football team would stay shuttered in 1988 as well. Indeed, as early as February 27—two days after the sanctions were announced—school officials expressed doubt that SMU would have enough players to field a viable team in 1988. That day, acting athletic director Dudley Parker said that the football team would not return in 1988 "unless we can really have a team" rather than merely "a bunch of youngsters (who) aren't capable of competing."
On April 11, 1987, SMU formally canceled the 1988 season. Acting president William Stallcup said that under the circumstances, SMU could not possibly field a competitive team in 1988. The only way SMU could have returned that year, Stallcup said, was with "walk-ons and only a handful of scholarship athletes and continuing players." Under these circumstances, Stallcup and other officials felt the players would have faced "an undue risk of serious injury." By this time, more than half of the Mustangs' scholarship players had transferred to other schools. Also, according to Southwest Conference commissioner Fred Jacoby, there would not have been nearly enough time to find a coach, and the school still did not have a permanent replacement for Hitch.
Aftermath.
SMU returned to football in 1989 under coach Forrest Gregg, a former Hall of Fame lineman with the NFL's Green Bay Packers who had been a star at SMU in the early 1950s. He was hired in the spring of 1988 and inherited a team made up mostly of freshmen and walk-ons. Gregg's new charges were mostly undersized and underweight; he was taller and heavier than all but a few of the players on the 70-man squad. The new squad was particularly short on offensive linemen; Gregg had to make several prospective wide receivers bulk up and move to the line. By nearly all accounts, it would have been unthinkable for SMU to have allowed such a roster to play a competitive schedule in 1988.
Games were moved to Ownby Stadium, a 23,000-seat on-campus facility. It had to be heavily renovated to meet Division I-A standards; SMU had not played there regularly since 1947 and had not played any games on campus at all since 1948. The Mustangs played there until 1994, when they moved to the Cotton Bowl, the scene of SMU's first glory era in the 1940s and 1950s. Since 2000, the Mustangs have played at Gerald J. Ford Stadium, which was built at the location of the razed Ownby Stadium.
The scandal devastated what had consistently been a top 20-ranked team that had recently contended for the national championship. SMU's players were younger, smaller, and less experienced than their opponents; one team captain later stated that he questioned whether some of his teammates had played high school football. The new team was, as the Associated Press later reported, "scared, almost terrified" to leave the locker room to play number one-ranked Notre Dame on November 11, 1989. They lost that game 59-6, although Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz reportedly went easy on them. As bad as that loss was, it was better than the Mustangs' 95-21 thumping at the hands of Houston several weeks earlier--the second-worst loss in school history. Eventual Heisman Trophy winner Andre Ware threw six touchdown passes against SMU in the first half, and David Klingler added four more in the second half even with the game long out of reach. Gregg was so disgusted that he refused to shake Houston coach Jack Pardee's hand after the game. Thirteen players needed knee surgery after the 1989 season compared to the normal three or four. Gregg, who left coaching to become SMU's athletic director in 1991, said years later, "I never coached a group of kids that had more courage. They thought that they could play with anyone. They were quality people. It was one of the most pleasurable experiences in my football life. Period."
Next to the cancellation of two seasons, the most severe sanction in the long term was the loss of 55 scholarships over four years. As a result, the Mustangs did not have a full complement of scholarships until 1992, and it was another year before they fielded a team entirely made up of players unaffected by the scandal. Additionally, in the wake of the scandal, school officials opted to significantly increase the admissions standards for prospective athletes, effectively removing them from contention for the kinds of players they attracted in the 1980s. Since 1989, SMU has had an overall record of 91-193-3 (.329), a regular season record of 2-68-0 (.029) on the road against teams that went on to finish their seasons with winning records, and a regular season record of 2-35-1 (.056) against top-25 ranked opponents.
Clements apologized for his role in continuing the payments in March 1987. He said that the board had "reluctantly and uncomfortably" decided to continue the payments, feeling it had to honor previous commitments. However, he said, in hindsight "we should have stopped (the payments) immediately" rather than merely phase the fund out. He faced calls for his impeachment as a result of admitting his role in the payments; two state legislators argued that he would have never been elected had he honestly addressed his role in the scandal. While none of these efforts materialized, the scandal effectively ended Clements' political career; he did not run for re-election in 1990.
Collins was not sanctioned by the NCAA for any role in the events leading up to the "death penalty," though the final report criticized him for not providing a convincing explanation for why players were still being paid after the school assured the NCAA that the payments had stopped. Nonetheless, his reputation was ruined. While he was a finalist for an opening at Mississippi State in 1990 (which eventually went to Jackie Sherrill), he has not returned to the collegiate ranks in any capacity since leaving SMU.
The Southwest Conference suffered greatly as a result of the scandal. It already had a dubious reputation with the number of NCAA violations at its member schools (at one point, only three of its nine members - Arkansas, Baylor and Rice - were not on probation), and the discovery of the scandal was a blow from which the conference never recovered. The SWC dissolved in 1996, and SMU moved initially to the Western Athletic Conference along with former SWC rival TCU. The Mustangs eventually transferred to Conference USA along with Rice in 2005, joining former SWC rival and C-USA charter member Houston. The team continues to compete in the Division I Football Bowl Subdivision despite having an undergraduate enrollment of about 6,000 students—one of the smallest in the division. 
Prior to joining Conference USA, SMU had only one winning season since returning from the "death penalty," in 1997. In 2009, the Mustangs made their first bowl appearance since 1984, a 45-10 victory over Nevada in the Hawaii Bowl. They succeeded in winning the C-USA West Division in 2010, giving them their first shot at winning a conference since 1984, but they lost in the Conference USA Championship to UCF. They did receive a second consecutive bowl bid, however. SMU was invited to participate in that year's Armed Forces Bowl to face Army in what amounted to another home game for SMU: because of construction at the game's primary site, Amon G. Carter Stadium in Fort Worth, the game was held at SMU's Gerald J. Ford Stadium. They would end losing this game despite playing it on home turf with a score of 16-14. In 2011, the Mustangs were invited to the BBVA Compass Bowl in Birmingham, Alabama—the first time they'd made three consecutive bowl appearances since the glory years of the early 1980s. The game was played on January 7, 2012, the first January bowl game for SMU since their appearance in the Cotton Bowl in 1983. By coincidence, they played Pittsburgh, the team they had defeated in that Cotton Bowl game, in the BBVA Compass Bowl and defeated them 28-6 for their second bowl win in three seasons. They will move to the American Athletic Conference in 2013.
The NCAA and the Death Penalty since the SMU case.
The far-reaching effects that resulted from enacting the "death penalty" on SMU has reportedly made the NCAA reluctant to issue another one. Since 1987, 31 schools have committed two major violations within a five-year period, thus making them eligible for the "death penalty." However, the NCAA has seriously considered shutting down a Division I sport only three times since then—against Kentucky men's basketball in 1989, Penn State football in 2012 and Texas Southern University football and men's basketball in 2012. It has actually handed down a "death penalty" only twice, both against smaller schools—Division II Morehouse College men's soccer in 2003 and Division III MacMurray College men's tennis in 2005.
In 2002, John Lombardi, then president of the :University of Florida: and now president of the Louisiana State University System, expressed the sentiment of many college officials when he said:
Despite the NCAA's apparent wariness about imposing such an extreme sanction, it has indicated that the SMU case is its standard for imposing it. For instance, in its investigation of Baylor basketball, the NCAA deemed Baylor's violations to be as serious as those SMU had engaged in almost 20 years earlier. However, it praised Baylor for taking swift corrective action, including forcing the resignation of coach Dave Bliss. According to the committee, Baylor's actions stood in marked contrast to SMU's behavior; as mentioned above, SMU officials knew serious violations were occurring and did nothing to stop them. Bliss was coach at SMU at the same time as the football scandal. Baylor did receive what amounted to a half-season death penalty - the cancellation of its non-conference games for the 2005-2006 season.
Further supporting this, the NCAA handed down a "death penalty" to Morehouse in 2003 for what it deemed "a complete failure" to comply with NCAA rules and regulations, even though it was Morehouse's first major infractions case.
The NCAA seemed to underline this even further in its 2012 announcement of sanctions against Penn State for school officials' cover-up of former defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky's rampant abuse of children. In a sweeping consent decree implementing the sanctions, the NCAA stated that the "death penalty" was primarily reserved for repeat violators that had neither cooperated with the NCAA nor taken any corrective measures. Although there had been serious discussion about imposing a death penalty on Penn State without any preliminaries, the NCAA ultimately decided against it because the school took swift corrective action once the scandal broke out in full, including firing head coach Joe Paterno and forcing the resignation of president Graham Spanier.
In popular culture.
The 1991 film "Necessary Roughness" touches on an up-and-coming season at the fictional higher learning institution of Texas State University and its football team nicknamed the Fightin' Armadillos. (At the time the film was made, there was no Texas State University, but in 2003, Southwest Texas State University changed its name to Texas State University, nicknamed the Bobcats, which coincidentally was the "season opener" opponent of the fictional Texas State Armadillos). Texas State's predicament—they are forced to start the season with a host of new coaches and players after the previous staff and players were removed after a scandal—is based on the "death penalty" handed out to the Southern Methodist University football team by the NCAA in 1987 for team violations very similar to the ones that the fictional Texas State is accused of.
"Pony Excess".
As noted above, ESPN's "30 for 30" documentary series profiled the SMU football scandal in one of its productions. "Pony Exce$$" (purposely spelled with dollar signs) was the thirtieth and last of the original series, airing on December 11, 2010. Among those who were interviewed for the program were Verne Lundquist, a Texas native who grew up during the Doak Walker era at SMU; Ron Meyer, who was the team's head coach through the first five years of its run, and his assistant coach Steve Endicott; then-KRLD radio reporters Chuck Cooperstein and Brad Sham, who also was the station's sports director; Skip Bayless, who covered SMU during this era for both "The Dallas Morning News" and "Dallas Times Herald"; Dallas radio hosts Norm Hitzges and Randy Galloway, the latter of whom was writing for the "Morning News" at the time; and Dale Hansen, who as noted above broke the story of David Stanley's allegations. The documentary was narrated by Patrick Duffy, who had starred in the television series "Dallas" during this time. The program also included interviews with several former SMU boosters.
In addition to the media personalities, former players Eric Dickerson, Craig James, David Richards, Bobby Leach, Lance McIlhenny, Harvey Armstrong, and Rod Jones were also interviewed for the program as was David Stanley's mother and Vinita Lee Piper, who was Stanley's fiancee at the time of his death in 2005 from his continued substance abuse issues. The film portrayed Stanley as a loose cannon and showed some instances where he committed personal fouls for late hits. Dickerson in particular was harshly critical of Stanley, due to an incident at an Italian restaurant in 1983; the university had asked Dickerson, who was starting his rookie season with the Los Angeles Rams, to come and meet with several incoming freshmen. After Stanley made a wisecrack about being bigger than him Dickerson responded by angrily confronting him, calling him a "motherfucker" and threatening him with bodily harm. He then strongly advised the coaches and recruiters not to sign Stanley, calling him "bad news". 
It was noted in the review of "Pony Exce$$" written by "The Dallas Morning News" reporter Barry Horn that Thaddeus Matula, himself an SMU alum, tried to reach out to both former coach Bobby Collins and booster Sherwood Blount for interviews but both refused to speak to Matula. This did not stop Matula from featuring them in the film.

Project Vote

Project Vote (or Voting for America, Inc.) is a national nonpartisan, nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization that works with marginalized and under-represented voters. Its current executive director is Michael Slater, who has worked for Project Vote since 2004. Project Vote's efforts to engage low income and minority voters in the civic process include the provision of training, management, evaluation and technical services.
Project Vote was founded in 1994 as Voting for America, and changed its name in 1997 to Project Vote/Voting for America. In 2010, the organization dropped Voting for America from its name. An earlier, unrelated organization, known as Project VOTE!, was active between 1984 and 1994. It is best remembered for a highly successful Chicago voter registration drive run by Barack Obama in 1992.
Between 1994 and 2008, Project Vote often coordinated voter registration campaigns with local chapters of ACORN. Project Vote's board was made up entirely of ACORN members prior to the summer of 2008 when news of an embezzlement scandal at ACORN made headlines.
Project Vote has also worked with organizations such as Demos, National Voting Rights Institute, Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law, and the Fair Elections Legal Network regarding election administration policy and voting rights, including enforcement of the National Voter Registration Act through research, litigation and technical assistance.

Knott's Scary Farm

Knott's Scary Farm or Knott's Halloween Haunt is a seasonal Halloween event at Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park, California. It is an event in which the theme park is transformed into "160 acres of horror", via a series of over 1,000 monsters, 10 mazes and a series of 'scare zones'. It is the largest Halloween event to be held at a theme park.
History.
Originally a three-night affair, beginning on October 26, 1973, the annual, month-long event celebrates its 42nd year in 2014. It has become the largest event of any theme park. Knott's Berry Farm was originally modeled after Calico, California, a ghost town that was a result of the California silver rush. Already having a dedicated "Ghost Town" section in the theme park, this area would become the designed area for the original Halloween Haunt, eventually expanding to the entire park.
The 1980s would continue to be a success for the theme park, and popular culture icons were employed to represent the event. In 1981, actor and parodist "Weird Al" Yankovic joined the cast, as did Elvira in the following year. Elvira was prominently featured in many Halloween Haunt events until 2001. According to postings on her My Space page, Cassandra was released from her contract by the park's new owners due to their wanting a more family friendly appeal. The 1990s would show a different approach to Halloween. Humor was added to many facets in the theme park and Knott's turned from the explicit horror to black comedy. This continuing balance of horror and humor has been a key to the continuing success of Knott's Halloween Haunt.
Park transformation.
While Knott's Berry Farm is a year-round theme park, the entire acreage is modified to fit the Halloween motif. Rides and other attractions are converted into macabre themes. Over 1,000 seasonal workers are specifically employed to play the roles of "vampires, clowns, ghouls, werewolves, and monsters", roaming the park in five terrifying scare zones, amidst haze produced by giant fog machines. Charlene Parker has been playing the role of Sarah Rebecca Ann "The Green Witch" Morgan-Marshall since 1982, and is the longest serving of all the 1,000 "monsters" who scare the guests at this event.
The park has constructed 10 mazes and 5 scare zones as well as performing live shows. The controversial "Hanging" live show is a staple of the Haunt that lampoons celebrities and persons in the news through a series of staged hangings. The Hanging has been an annual event since the 1979 Halloween Haunt.

Howard Terpning

Howard Terpning (born November 5, 1927) is an American painter and illustrator best known for his paintings of Native Americans.
Life and career.
Terpning was born in Oak Park, Illinois. His mother was an interior decorator, and his father worked for the railroad. He grew up in the Midwest living in Iowa, Missouri and Texas as well as Illinois. As a boy he liked to draw and knew by the age of seven that he wanted to be an artist. At age 15, he became fascinated with the West and Native Americans when he spent the summer camping and fishing with a cousin near Durango, Colorado. When he turned 17, he enlisted in the Marine Corps and served from 1945 through 1946. He was stationed in China for nine months.
After leaving the Marines he enrolled at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts in their two-year commercial art program using the G.I. Bill to pay his tuition. To further his study he attended the American Academy of Art in Chicago for six months where he honed his life drawing and painting skills. 
After art school a family friend introduced Terpning to Haddon Sundblom, a successful and highly regarded illustrator of that time. Based on the recommendation and the strength of Terpning's drawings Sundblom hired Terpning to work at his Chicago studio as an apprentice for $35 per week. Initially, Terpning ran errands, cut mats, built crates and cleaned brushes. After about a year and a half he began to work on his own commissions. In 1955, he moved to a Milwaukee studio where he stayed for three years before relocating to New York where he was hired by a major Chicago studio. By 1962, he was working as a freelance artist using an agent to facilitate the business side of his craft. As a result Terpning was able to work from his home studio eliminating the long commute into NYC. During his 25 years as an illustrator he created magazine covers, story illustrations and advertising art for publications such as "Reader's Digest", "Time", "Newsweek", "Good Housekeeping", "Field & Stream", "McCall's", "Redbook", and "Ladies' Home Journal".
In addition to illustrating for magazines Terpning completed over 80 movie posters starting with "The Guns of Navarone" in 1961. Other examples include "Cleopatra", "Doctor Zhivago", "The Sound of Music", "The Sand Pebbles", and the 1967 re-release of "Gone with the Wind".
In 1967 in the midst of his commercial art career Terpning left his home in Connecticut and headed to Vietnam as a civilian combat artist. Invited by the Marine Corps to document the war by living with the Marines for one month. After two weeks of training he wound up in Da Nang, South Vietnam with camera and sketch pad going out on patrols with combat troops. Of the experience Terpning stated he was "profoundly changed" by the experience. Upon his return home he created six paintings which are now at the National Museum of the Marine Corps.
Fine art.
Around 1974, Terpning began to tire of commercial work and decided to follow his interest in the American West and Plains Indians. Consequently, he began to transition into fine art by creating paintings and selling them in Western galleries. The first paintings sold for $2,000 to $2,500. After three years, he left Connecticut and the commercial art world and moved to Arizona to devote himself entirely to painting the American West. Within two years he was elected to both the National Academy of Western Art and the Cowboy Artists of America (CA). In the 22 years he was an active member of the CAA, Terpning earned 42 awards for his work.
In 1985, Terpning was honored with a retrospective at the Gilcrease Museum with 38 original works on display. His work has also been displayed in Peking, China, and the Grand Palais in Paris. 
Some of what has been written of Terpning and his work:
"That Terpning is a realist is plain enough, since his work is primarily representational, not formal. But it is not a realism of minute detail for its own sake, without regard to the context of light and of the subject's character. Nor is it the sort of pop realism that places subjects in happenstance circumstances like tourists with a snapshot camera. Terpning's realism takes for granted the representational nature of art and takes it from there."
"Although his paintings actually read as bold declarations, Terpning's choice of palette is typically restrained in order to ensure that narrative is the first impression imparted upon a viewer."
The late Fred A. Myers, director of Gilcrease Museum said of Terpning, " is simply the best and best-known artist doing Western subjects at this point... He is among a very small group of painters of the West in the late 20th century whose art will still be hanging in museums and appreciated a hundred years from now."
In 2006 at the Coeur d'Alene Art Auction Terpning's "Search for the Renegades" sold for over 1.4 million, "The Stragglers" sold for just over 1 million.
Terpning was profiled November 30, 2008 on "CBS Sunday Morning".
Some of the museums Terpning's work can be found at include the Phoenix Art Museum, National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution, Autry National Center of the American West, Gilcrease Museum, Eiteljorg Museum and the Booth Western Art Museum.

Gun laws in California

Gun laws in California regulate the sale, possession, and use of firearms and ammunition in the state of California in the United States.
The gun laws of California are some of the strictest in the United States. A Handgun Safety Certificate, obtained by passing a written test, is required for handgun purchases, although there are exemptions to this requirement. (This requirement was extended to long guns on January 1st, 2014.) Handguns sold by dealers must be "California legal" by being listed on the state's roster of handguns certified for sale. Private sales of firearms must be done through a licensed dealer. All firearm sales are recorded by the state, and have a ten-day waiting period. Unlike most other states, California has no provision in its state constitution that explicitly guarantees an individual right to keep and bear arms. The California Supreme Court has maintained that most of California's restrictive gun laws are constitutional based on the fact that the state's constitution does not explicitly guarantee private citizens the right to purchase, possess, or carry firearms. However recent US Supreme Court decisions of "Heller" (2008) and "McDonald" (2010) established that the Second Amendment applies to all states within the Union, and many of California's gun laws are now being challenged in the federal courts.
Semi-automatic firearms that the state has classified as assault weapons, .50 BMG caliber rifles, and magazines that can hold more than ten rounds of ammunition may not be sold in California. Possession of automatic firearms, and of short-barreled shotguns and rifles, is generally prohibited.
California is a "may-issue" state for permits to carry concealed guns. The willingness of issuing authorities in California ranges from "No-Issue" in most urban areas to "Shall-Issue" in rural counties. However, concealed carry permits are valid statewide, regardless of where they were issued. This creates a situation where residents in presumptively "No-Issue" locations such as Los Angeles and San Francisco cannot lawfully carry a concealed firearm, but residents from other counties with more permissive CCW issuance policies can lawfully carry within these same jurisdictions. California does not recognize concealed carry permits issued by other states, and non-residents are generally forbidden from obtaining a California concealed carry permit.
California has state preemption for many, but not all, firearms laws. Actual enforcement of California's firearms laws also varies widely across the state. Urban areas, such as the San Francisco and Los Angeles metropolitan areas strictly enforce firearms laws, and some communities within these areas have passed local ordinances that make legally owning a firearm difficult. Meanwhile, some rural jurisdictions narrowly enforce the same firearms laws by prosecuting only those who demonstrate malicious intent, or not enforcing portions of the state's firearms laws at all.
Summary table.
<onlyinclude>
</onlyinclude>
Preemption.
California law (§53071 GC) restricts county and city authorities from enacting firearm regulations. This provides for uniform firearm laws and prevents situations found in other states (such as New York) where traveling with an otherwise legal firearm could put a citizen at risk of violating local city ordinances.
Because of their inability to regulate firearms directly some cities, such as Los Angeles, have enacted ammunition regulations.
Firearm sales.
The buyer of a firearm must fill out an application to purchase a particular gun. The firearms dealer sends the application to the California Department of Justice (DOJ), which performs a background check on the buyer. The approved application is valid for 30 days. There is a 10 day waiting period for the delivery of any firearm.
Sales of firearms from one person to another (private party transfers) must be through a licensed firearms dealer using a Private Party Transfer form. The licensed dealer may charge a $10 fee, in addition to the $25 transfer fee that the state charges. Any number of firearms may be transferred at one time using this method. The dealer submits a Dealer's Record of Sale (DROS) form to the state, and the purchaser must wait 10 days before picking up the guns. Federally defined curio or relic long guns over 50 years old may be sold without going through a licensed dealer.
Handgun purchases, except for private party transfers and Certificate of Eligibility (COE) holders, are limited to one per 30 day period. To purchase a handgun, a buyer must have a Handgun Safety Certificate. This is obtained by passing a written test, given by a Department of Justice certified instructor, on the safe and legal use of handguns. The certificate is valid for five years. A buyer must also perform a Safe Handling Demonstration when taking possession of a handgun. Some individuals are exempt from the Safety Certificate and Handling Demonstration requirements, including active and retired military and law enforcement personnel, hunter safety certificate holders, and concealed carry license holders.
Roster of handguns certified for sale.
Dealers may not sell any new handgun unless it is listed in the state Department of Justice roster of handguns certified for sale. Listed handguns must include certain mechanical features and pass a set of laboratory tests. Private party transfers, curio/relic handguns, certain single-action revolvers, and pawn/consignment returns are exempt from this requirement.
Microstamping.
On May 17, 2013, the state began enforcing a new law requiring that semi-automatic pistols incorporate microstamping. With this technology, very small markings are engraved, using a laser, on the tip of the firing pin and on the breechface of the firearm. When the gun is fired, these etchings may be transferred to the primer by the firing pin, and to the cartridge case head by the breechface, using the pressure created when a round is fired. If successful, this imprints two identifying numbers, unique to that gun, on each spent cartridge casing. This requirement applies to new guns being added to the California Department of Justice's roster of handguns certified for sale; semi-automatic handgun models already listed on the roster are not required to incorporate microstamping.
Concealed carry.
California is a "may issue" state for concealed carry. A license to carry a concealed firearm may be issued or denied to qualified applicants at the discretion of the County Counsels or City Attorneys in their place of residence. In practice, the attitudes of different sheriffs and police chiefs toward the issuance of permits vary widely and, consequentially, different jurisdictions in California can vary anywhere from de facto shall-issue to de facto no-issue. A permit may be issued, by a county Sheriff or city Chief or head of municipal police, in one of two formats:
California does not recognize any concealed carry permits issued by other states or their political subdivisions. With exceptions for nonresident Active Duty military members permanently stationed within California, state law generally forbids nonresidents from obtaining a California CCW permit.
California law provides that the Sheriff of a county or a city Police Chief may issue a license to carry a concealed weapon upon proof that the person applying is of good moral character and that "good cause" exists for the issuance. While it is generally believed to be extremely difficult to obtain a license to carry a concealed weapon (CCW) in California, the difficulty varies greatly by city and county of residence. In some rural counties, qualified applicants are usually successful in obtaining a license, while some cities and counties, such as San Francisco and Los Angeles, are extremely restrictive in what they perceive to be good cause, such as a clear and immediate threat on the applicant's life that cannot be avoided or mitigated by other means. Some jurisdictions have established additional local requirements the applicant must meet before the issuing authority grants a CCW permit. For example, Monterey County requires applicants to obtain a mental health assessment at the applicant's expense as part of that county's permit application process.
In some of the more restrictive cities and counties, licenses tend to be issued mainly to "Friends of the Sheriff" (or Police Chief), celebrities and campaign donors. Some of these departments are now being challenged in Federal Lawsuits, under the Equal Protection clause of the 14th Amendment.
Some argue that the California system for CCW issuance fosters systematic discrimination of applicants, as it has been publicized that numerous celebrities and government officials have been issued CCW licenses in cities and counties where the general public have been consistently denied. CCW issuance is also extremely low in areas where the population has a high concentration of minorities and minority applicants are more frequently denied, causing some to allege institutional racism.
Carrying a concealed firearm without a permit is a very serious misdemeanor with a minimum penalty of 90 days in jail. It may be prosecuted as a felony if any one of over a dozen specific circumstances exist, such as carry by a felon, carry in relation to gang activity, carry with the intent to commit a violent crime, etc.
Peruta v. San Diego.
On February 13, 2014, a three-judge panel of a federal appeals court, in the case of "Peruta v. San Diego", ruled that California's may-issue concealed carry rules as implemented by the County of San Diego, in combination with its ban on open carry in most areas of the state, violate the Second Amendment, because they together deny law-abiding citizens the right to bear arms in public for the lawful purpose of self-defense.
The San Diego County Sheriff's Department issued a press release dated February 21, 2014 stating it will not seek review of the decision by the entire membership of judges sitting in the Ninth Circuit, and "Should the decision of the Ninth Circuit become final, the Sheriff's Department will begin to issue CCW's in situations where the applicant has met all other lawful qualifications and has requested a CCW for purposes of self-defense." This paves the way for California's may-issue law to be replaced with a shall-issue law.
On February 27, 2014 California Attorney General Kamala Harris filed a petition for en-banc review of the decision. As the state was not a formal party of the case, her action is not an appeal, but merely a request that the full court re-hear the case en-banc on its own initiative. 
Open carry.
Open carry of loaded or unloaded firearms in public is generally prohibited, although open carry may be allowed in unincorporated rural areas under certain circumstances.
Personal possession (i.e., carry) of a loaded firearm is prohibited in incorporated areas (such as inside city limits) or prohibited areas of unincorporated territory without a license to carry or other exemption provided for by law. A license to carry "loaded and exposed" may be issued by a Police Chief or County Sheriff in a county with population of less than 200,000 persons at the last census. No license or permit is required to openly carry a loaded firearm in unincorporated areas where discharge is not prohibited by local ordinance.
Carrying a loaded magazine separate from the handgun is also not prohibited under the penal code (Subdivision (g) of California Penal Code §12031 defines what constitutes a loaded weapon).
In the case of "People v. Clark" (1996) a shotgun shell attached to the shotgun, although not chambered or placed in a position where it was able to be fired, was declared to be legal under California law and the charge of having a loaded firearm against Clark was dismissed.
Prior to January 1, 2012, it was legal to openly carry an unloaded handgun in public. In October 2011, Governor Jerry Brown signed a bill that modifies the law on openly carrying an unloaded firearm to match the restrictions for openly carrying a loaded weapon. Legislation was later signed by Governor Brown to expand these restrictions to long guns and shotguns.
Transportation.
When being transported, handguns must be unloaded and in a locked fully enclosed container other than the glove box or any console attached to the vehicle. The trunk of a car is considered to be a locked container but a glove box or "utility box" is specifically forbidden. If one believes he or she is within a "gun-free school zone" (area surrounding 1,000 feet from the edge of school grounds which teaches any grade from kindergarten to 12th grade) then the handgun must be locked in a fully enclosed container. Failure to lock up a handgun while in a school zone is a violation of federal and state law.
Long guns (rifles, shotguns) must be unloaded when transported in a vehicle. There is no requirement for a locked container with the exception of long guns considered to be "assault weapons". Federal law requires locking containers when inside of a "gun-free school zone." The constitutionality of the federal Gun-Free School Zone Act is in question due to the "U.S. v. Lopez" ruling.
Assault weapons, as defined by California law, must always be transported in locked containers and may only be transported under certain circumstances
Child safety.
Firearms must be kept locked up when children may be present. The 2008 California Dangerous Weapons Control Law modified California Penal Code §12035 defining criminal storage of a firearm as
keeping "any loaded firearm within any premises that are under his or her custody or control and he or she knows or reasonably should know that a child is likely to gain access to the firearm."
A person may be charged with a crime, if he or she keeps a loaded firearm, and the child takes the firearm to a public place or causes
injury.
Assault weapons.
It is illegal to sell a firearm that the state has defined as an "assault weapon", and which has been listed in the DOJ roster of prohibited firearms, which includes many military look-alike semi-automatic rifles and .50 caliber BMG rifles. DOJ rostered firearms may be legally possessed if already registered with the state prior to January 2005. Military look-alike firearms that are not listed on the DOJ roster of prohibited firearms, known as "off-list lowers", are legal to own and possess, as long as state laws concerning configuration are followed. It is illegal to import, sell, give, trade, or lend a magazine that holds more than 10 rounds of ammunition, except for fixed tubular magazines for lever-action rifles and .22 caliber rifles; however, the possession of such magazines is legal. It is illegal to possess an automatic firearm or a short-barreled shotgun or rifle without permission from the Department of Justice; such permission is generally not granted. Enforcement of the Assault Weapons Ban varies widely throughout the state. Authorities in most urban areas will prosecute someone for merely possessing a banned assault weapon regardless of intent, whereas officials in some rural counties have either refused to enforce the ban entirely or only prosecute those in possession of banned weapons who demonstrate malicious intent. It must be noted that the latter statement applies only to county sheriffs and local police, as the California Highway Patrol strictly enforces the Assault Weapons Ban and will arrest those in violation of the ban, regardless of where in the state the violation occurs. 
Assault Weapons Control Act of 1989.
The Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act of 1989, its subsequent augmentation in 1999, and the .50 Caliber BMG Regulation Act of 2004 have led to many restrictions on semi-automatic firearms. In addition to a lengthy list of specific firearms that are banned by name, the following firearms are banned by characteristic (from Penal Code §12276.1) :
In addition, (Penal Code §12001.5) bans, by definition, short-barreled shotguns and short-barreled rifles.
Defined in Penal Code §12020; a short-barreled shotgun is defined as a firearm (designed, redesigned, or altered) to fire a fixed shotgun shell and has a barrel or barrels of less than 18 inches or an overall length of less than 26 inches.
A short-barreled rifle is defined as a semiautomatic, center fire rifle with a barrel length of less than 16 inches or an overall length of less than 26 inches.
Bullet Button.
Methods of obtaining particular styles of firearms similar to assault weapons have been achieved by design changes by gun parts manufacturers to allow a person to obtain a style of rifle used in sport shooting and competitions. One of the most common modifications is a "bullet button", which modifies a rifle so that the magazine is not removable without the use of a tool (a bullet was defined as a tool per state law), which presses a button that a finger alone cannot press. Weapons with this feature no longer have a "detachable magazine" within the assault weapons definition, and therefore may be exempt depending on the other requirements. As certain portions of firearms (the lower receiver, or "lower" for short, which is legally considered to be the firearm) are banned by model name under California state law, multiple requirements are made to allow a rifle to comply under state law.
The recent court case Haynie v Pleasanton validated that a Bullet Button is legal and guns that have one installed do not qualify as assault weapons.
Many tools have been devised to make it easier and faster to drop the magazine from the gun, as California law states that you must use an external tool not attached to the gun. A popular tool, the "magnet button", which sticks on the bullet button, has not been determined to be illegal. The use of illegal buttons may cause the weapon to be determined to be an assault weapon, which is a felony and could result in jail time and/or confiscation of the owner's entire gun collection, and a lifetime ban under federal law from possessing firearms in the future. This penalty has been called "unconstitutional" amongst other things by gun owners and politicians alike.
Exceptions.
A few exceptions to the assault weapons ban exist. The first is for those who owned listed assault weapons before the 1989 assault weapons ban went into effect are allowed to keep such firearms; owners were required to register their assault weapons with the California Department of Justice by a deadline established in the assault weapons ban legislation.
The second exception allows non-resident active duty military members to bring their assault weapons into California when permanently assigned to a military installation within the state. Prior to arrival, the military member must submit a registration form and a copy of his or her assignment orders and an authorization letter from the installation commander to the DOJ, and the firearm(s) in question are legal to obtain and possess in his or her home state.
Resident police officers in California may also own "assault weapons", with permission of their police chief and the California Department of Justice. As of 2011, police officers may keep their "assault weapons" and "high capacity magazines" after retirement or separation from the force. No permission is needed for police to purchase and possess "high capacity magazines".
Firearms that would have been classified as assault weapons but are used for Olympic and International competitions are exempt. There is a list of the exempt firearms, and new firearms can be added to the list if needed by USA Shooting, the governing body for Olympic and International Shooting Sport competition.
Finally, assault weapons intended for use in the film industry are allowed, with approval from the Department of Justice.
Nonresidents Transporting Assault Weapons Through California.
Because the states that neighbor California have more permissive gun laws, it is conceivable that one may travel through California with banned weapons to reach other states (i.e., traveling from Oregon to Arizona). There are limited federal protections under the Firearm Owners Protection Act for nonresidents traveling through California with firearms that meet the state's assault weapon criteria that would otherwise be legal for private citizens to own or possess under federal law. First, the weapon must be legal for the traveler to own in his or her home state. Additionally, the weapon in question must be unloaded with the firearm and ammunition locked in separate cases and placed in an area of the vehicle that is not easily accessible, such as the trunk of a car or bed of a truck. Finally, the traveler should traverse the state by the shortest route and make the minimum number of stops practicable.
Other laws.
There are also numerous other laws, such as prohibition on possession of tracer ammunition, handgun armor piercing ammunition, .50 BMG rifles, and the sale or transfer of magazines with a capacity of more than 10 rounds. All rifles are normally exempt for the original owner if properly registered at the time of the acts which prohibited them.
In addition, the law states that any weapon that is part of the AR-15 series or AK series is also an assault weapon, regardless of manufacturer; this dates back to 1989 ban, and was confirmed in the "Kasler v. Lockyer" decision, filed 6/29/2000. However, the California Supreme Court declared the identification of assault weapon by series membership to be too dubious and difficult for the average citizen or even trial court to make without specific and clear model identification guidelines. The court thus set some specific requirements for the "series" identification portion of the law in their ruling of "Harrott v. County of Kings", filed 6/28/2001. This decision required banned firearms to be specifically listed by make and model in California Code of Regulations (the "Kasler list"); it did not address assault weapons defined by features. Thus, only firearms specifically listed by exact combination of manufacturer and model name, or conforming to explicit exterior characteristics (such as a pistol grip or folding stock in combination with a detachable magazine) can be banned under current legislation.
Once it was realized the California Department of Justice (CA DOJ) had not updated the "Kasler list" in the five years after the "Harrott" decision, many Californians found they could legally purchase and possess AR and AK rifles not yet officially identified as "series" members. As of February 2006, over 10,000 "off-list" receivers (frames) for such rifles have been legally imported to, and purchased within, California. The only requirement for these receivers are that the combination of make and model is not explicitly listed as banned, and as long as the owner does not add certain "characteristic features" turning the firearm into an assault weapon (i.e. pistol grip, flash suppressor, etc.). These characteristic features can be used, however, if a nondetachable 10-round (or less) magazine, conforming in the converse to the California Code of Regulations §5469, formerly §978.20, definition of detachable magazine, is affixed to such "off-list" rifles. These off-list rifles can also be used without a pistol grip, folding stock or flash hider, in which case it is legal to own and use them with detachable magazines.
The CA DOJ produced a report from the Ferranto Commission in response, intimating that this list will be updated in early 2006; as of December 2006, it had not done so. On February 1, 2006, the CA DOJ also issued a controversial memorandum about this subject; critics say the described actions are not founded or supported within statutory law in Penal Code §§12275–12290. This memo stated that once off-list "series" firearms are declared and registered as assault weapons, they will not be able to have characteristic features added or fixed magazines removed. This is being challenged by pro-gun groups, since there is no criminal violation in the California Penal Code for adding or changing features to a legally acquired, registered assault weapon.
On November 8, 2005, San Francisco voters enacted Proposition H, a total ban on the manufacture, sale, transfer or distribution of firearms or ammunition in San Francisco, as well as a ban on the possession of handguns within the city by San Francisco residents (excepting peace officers, security guards and the like). The ban did not prohibit possession of weapons other than handguns, nor did it prohibit residents of other cities from possessing handguns in San Francisco.
While this measure made San Francisco the third major U.S. city, following Washington, D.C. and Chicago, to enact a ban on handguns, San Francisco's ban extended further, not implementing a grandfather clause found in Chicago's and Washington D.C.'s laws that protected existing gun owners. Proposition H stated that handgun owners in San Francisco must turn over their handguns to the police by the end of March 2006, have them confiscated, or move outside the city limits. In June 2006, Judge James Warren of the San Francisco County Superior Court struck down Proposition H, asserting that under California law local officials do not have the authority to ban handgun ownership by law-abiding citizens. On January 9, 2008, a California appellate court upheld Judge Warren's decision. The National Rifle Association (NRA) opposed the ban from its inception.
In May 2013 Los Angeles banned the possession of magazines that can hold more than ten rounds of ammunition. In November of the same year, the city of Sunnyvale passed a similar ordinance along with three other firearm related restrictions. The new ordinance requires city residents to "dispose, donate, or sell" any magazine capable of holding more than ten rounds within a proscribed period of time once the measure took affect. Measure C also requires: 1) city residents to report firearm theft to the police within 48 hours, 2) residents to lock up their guns at home, and 3) gun dealers to keep logs of ammunition sales. The city of San Francisco then passed similar ordinances a short time later.

Gillespie Field is a San Diego Trolley station located across Marshall Avenue from Gillespie Field airport which is served by the Green Line. The next station north is Santee Town Center, which is the Green Line's terminus, and the next station south is Arnele Avenue.
Prior to July 2005, all Orange Line trolleys used to continue through this station to Santee Town Center. With the opening of the new Green Line trolley, this service was replaced, and Orange Line trolleys used to terminate at this station. This was due to the path between Gillespie Field and Santee Town Center being single tracked, and having two lines running on that route would cause operational issues. Orange Line service was further truncated towards El Cajon Transit Center on September 2, 2012 as part of a system redesign due to low ridership between the two stations.

Cynthia McKinney presidential campaign, 2008

Cynthia McKinney began her campaign for President of the United States on December 16, 2007 as a candidate for the Green Party presidential nomination via YouTube. She and her running mate Rosa Clemente accepted the Green Party's presidential nomination July 12, 2008 at the 2008 Green National Convention. Her campaign focused on issues such as racial profiling, September 11, 2001 attacks, and the Green Party's 10 key values.
She also supports statehood for the District of Columbia, slavery reparations, electoral reforms including instant runoff voting, and calls for abolishing the death penalty and the War on Drugs.
On November 4, 2008 McKinney finished sixth in the election with 161,603 votes.
Early stages.
On December 11, 2007, McKinney announced her candidacy for the Green Party nomination for President of the United States in the 2008 presidential election. Green Party members attempted to recruit McKinney both in 2000 and 2004. In 2000, she was widely mentioned as a possible vice-presidential running mate for Ralph Nader; in 2004, attempts were made to convince McKinney to run on the Green Party ballot line for president.
While there had been a great deal of excitement among party members about a possible McKinney run in those prior elections, the congresswoman had little to do with the party apart from having had Green Party loyalists working on her congressional campaigns. This changed drastically following her defeat in the 2006 election. McKinney attended the California Green Party strategy retreat in Sonoma, California, where she was the keynote speaker. On May 25, 2007, she was asked about a presidential run on WBAI and confirmed that she had thought about a Green run: "2008 has not been ruled out, some kind of effort. Certainly now it is questionable as to whether that effort would come under the banner of the Democratic Party."
On June 9, speaking at a Harlem fundraiser for her Congressional campaign debt, McKinney addressed speculation that she might run for president in 2008. At the end of the program, Robert Knight of Pacifica Radio, who emceed the evening's events, took the pulpit to ask: "I can't hardly wait for 2008. Ms. McKinney, in 2008, what color is your parachute?" McKinney responds from the audience, "it's not red and it's not blue." McKinney also appeared at the July 15 Green Party National Meeting in Reading, Pennsylvania, where she suggested that the Green Party could become a progressive political force. "he disgust of the American people with what they see before them — all they need is the blueprint and a road map. Why not have the Green Party provide the blueprint and the road map?"
On July 17, McKinney also received the endorsement of the Workers World Party, the first time that party chose not to nominate a candidate of its own.
At an August 27 peace rally in Kennebunkport, Maine McKinney confirmed the depth of her disenchantment with the Democratic Party, urging San Francisco voters to replace Nancy Pelosi with antiwar activist Cindy Sheehan. On September 10, in a letter to the Steering Committee of the Green Party of the United States, McKinney stated she would not seek the Green Party nomination for president. However, in early October it appeared that McKinney was making moves toward declaring herself an official Green Party candidate.
By October 9, 2007, Green leaders were receiving emails indicating McKinney had formally joined the Green Party. The emails also indicate McKinney could announce a Green Party presidential bid by the third week of October. Following a brief exploratory visit to California in mid-October, McKinney filed with the FEC. She formally announced her candidacy with a video on her website and on YouTube on December 16, 2007. Later that month she agreed to join with others on the Green Party California Primary Ballot for an event in San Francisco entitled Campaign 2008: A Presidential Debate That Matters. McKinney has also filed with the State Board of Elections of Illinois for the Green party in the presidential race.
On July 9, 2008 she named her running mate as Rosa Clemente and clinched the party's nomination three days later at the 2008 Green Party National Convention.
Green Party Nominee.
Democratic National Convention.
During the Democratic National Convention from August 25 – 28th Cynthia McKinney, and Rosa Clemente appeared at several events and demonstrations in Denver. On August 24 McKinney appeared at the End the Occupations March and Rally organized by Recreate 68, and spoke to the crowd from the West Steps of the Colorado State Capitol Building. McKinney's appearance at the event caused some controversy after the Green_Party_of_Colorado's decision not to support Recreate 68. On the 27th, Rosa Clemente spoke at a "Open The Debates" rally organized by the Nader/Gonzalez campaign.
During the first week in September McKinney traveled to Wisconsin for several events. On the 5th McKinney spoke in Racine, Wisconsin to the local We Are Change group.
On September 6 McKinney spoke in Baraboo, Wisconsin at Fighting Bob Fest the largest annual political festival in the United States. The eight-year old festival is named in honor of Bob La Follette.
2008 Hurricane Katrina conspiracy theory.
Cynthia McKinney was reported by Fox News on October 2, 2008 to have had a conspiracy theory stating that during the aftermath Hurricane Katrina, The Pentagon dumped 5,000 executed felons that were killed by a single bullet to the head. In the article (bad link) McKinney stated that she was informed by the mother of a National Guard, with verifications from "insiders."
Third party debate.
McKinney accepted an invitation to attend the third party presidential debate.
Ballot status.
The Green Party had announced plans to get on all 50 state ballots and D.C. for 2008. They did not meet their goal. McKinney was on 32 ballots with 368 electoral votes (68.4% of the total possible) as well as another 17 states as a write-in candidate.<br>

Immingham Dock railway station

Immingham Dock railway station was a railway station which served the dock in Immingham, Lincolnshire, England.
History.
Immingham Dock was opened on 22 July 1912 by the Great Central Railway at a point where the deep water channel came close to the Lincolnshire bank of the river Humber. In order to get their workers from Kingston-upon-Hull, and and the surrounding villages to the dock the company built the Barton and Immingham Light Railway, which terminated at Immingham Dock railway station by the western arm of the dock. Other workers were catered for by the Grimsby and Immingham Electric Railway, an inter-urban system running from Grimsby to the Eastern Arm of the dock.
The station was a single platform affair with a run round facility and a small, pagoda - style station building which housed the usual facilities. Services were provided from New Holland, leaving what is now the Barton Line south of , passing through East Halton and Killingholme stations before reaching Immingham.
The station surprisingly escaped closure when passenger services were withdrawn from the branch line on 17 June 1963 with an alternate service provided via the previously freight only link to . Trains were run from Grimsby Town via Habrough usually at times coinciding with dock workers' shift changes. However, this single stop branch was short lived, services being withdrawn on 6 October 1969 when the station was finally closed.

George Gray (Australian politician)

George Henry Gray (2 October 1903? – 2 August 1967) was an Australian politician.
Early life.
Gray claimed to have been born at Hay, New South Wales on 2 October 1903 to bank manager George Henry Gray and his wife Priscilla Maud Kerr. He grew up near Orange and was educated at Burwood Public School in Sydney, then becoming a grocer's assistant at Thornleigh. He later became a customs officer at Shanghai in China in the middle 1920s.
Gray returned to Australia around 1926 and moved to Queensland, becoming a farmer and organiser for the Douglas Credit Party. On 4 August 1939 he was the leader of a raid comprising thirty-seven members of the League for Social Justice on Parliament House in the Queensland capital of Brisbane. The raiders demanded lower unemployment and better conditions for primary producers from the government. Gray and the others were arrested for unlawful assembly but were acquitted at the subsequent trial. Later, he claimed to have been spying on the league for intelligence authorities. On 20 April 1944 he married Elsa Noelen Braham Stratton, aged 19, at Woollahra in Sydney.
Military service.
Gray was mobilised on 29 May 1940 and served in Queensland and Papua New Guinea. In May 1942 he was commissioned in the Australian Imperial Force, and on 12 December 1944 he transferred to the Reserve of Officers as a captain. Returning to Brisbane, he became an accountant for Queensland Cement & Lime Co. and owned a business (run by his wife Elsa) at Bowen Hills.
Return from the military.
In 1946, the Grays moved to Toowoomba, where Gray managed Co-operative Sales and Service Co. and joined the Australian Labor Party. Having formed the Roseneath Pastoral Company in 1950 with two associates, he began dairy farming near Laidley. Unfortunate weather and a fire in May 1951 that burnt Gray's house down compromised the venture. In 1955 he became secretary of the Rockhampton Agricultural Society.
Federal politics.
In 1961, Gray was elected to the Australian House of Representatives as the Labor member for Capricornia. In parliament he was chiefly concerned with northern development and defence. He designed a combined tank and tank-carrier for the army, which received serious consideration.
Gray was an elder of the John Knox Presbyterian Church in Rockhampton, and was a teetotaller. On 2 August 1967 he died of pulmonary oedema at Rockhampton and was buried in the North Rockhampton cemetery; he was survived by his wife, three sons, and three daughters. His wife Elsa ("Bray") was an alderman with Rockhampton City Council (1973-91) and was State secretary of the Australian Local Government Women's Association for eight years.

Island Resort () is a high-rise complex located in the Siu Sai Wan district of Hong Kong (address: 28 Siu Sai Wan Road, Siu Sai Wan, Chaiwan, Hong Kong). The complex contains four towers, each of which rises 60 floors and in height; although the property is classified as containing nine towers, real estate data company Emporis ranks the complex as only four skyscrapers, as several are interconnected. The entire complex began construction in 1999, and was completed in 2001. The buildings are composed almost entirely of residential units, with a total of 3,098 apartments; the lowermost floors are used as retail and restaurant space. 
There is a swimming pool complex, with outdoor and indoor pools. The outdoor pools are in the middle of the tower area and the indoor one is within the main complex.
The land on which the Island Resort complex is situated holds the distinction of being the most expensive in the city; in 1997, prior to the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong, the Sino Land purchased the piece of land for US$1,515,384,620 in order to develop the Island Resort complex. The purchase was the last major land sale in Hong Kong that took place while the United Kingdom was still in control, and was also the most expensive land transaction in the city's history.

Otto Gottlieb Mohnike

Otto Gottlieb Mohnike (July 27, 1814 - January 26, 1887) was a German physician and naturalist who was a native of Stralsund. He was the son of philologist Gottlieb Mohnike (1781-1841).
He received his education in medicine at the Universities of Greifswald and Bonn, and following his studies, returned to Stralsund to practice medicine. From 1844 to 1869 he was a doctor in the services of the Dutch military, afterwards working as a physician in Bonn, where he died on January 26, 1887.
Mohnike is remembered for implementing the first successful nationwide smallpox vaccination in Japan. Previous attempts at vaccination in Japan had failed due to vaccines losing their effectiveness while being transported on long sea journeys. In 1849 he instituted the practice of delivering fresh cowpox vaccine from Batavia in the Dutch East Indies to the Japanese port of Nagasaki, thus creating a sharp reduction of smallpox in Japan. Afterwards, he conducted research as a naturalist on Java, Sumatra, Celebes and the Moluccas.

Novelty Press

Novelty Press (a.k.a. Premium Service Co., Inc.; a.k.a. Novelty Publications; a.k.a. Premier Group) was an American Golden Age comic-book publisher that operated from 1940–1949. It was the comic book imprint of Curtis Publishing Company, publisher of "The Saturday Evening Post". Among Novelty's best-known and longest-running titles were "Blue Bolt" and "Target Comics". 
During its nine-year run, Novelty had a roster of creators that included Al Avison, Dan Barry, Carl Burgos, L.B. Cole, Bill Everett, Al Gabriele, Joe Gill, Tom Gill, Jack Hearne, Jack Kirby, Tarpé Mills, Al Plastino, Don Rico, Joe Simon, Mickey Spillane, and Basil Wolverton.
Although published in Philadelphia, Novelty Press's editorial offices were in New York City.
History.
Novelty Press launched its first title, "Target Comics", debuted with a cover date of February 1940, followed shortly thereafter by "Blue Bolt".
"Target Comics" featured such stars as Bull's-Eye Bill, Lucky Byrd, and The White Streak ("Target"'s first superhero). Material for the book was supplied by Funnies, Inc., a packager also responsible for many of Marvel Comics' early characters. Creators included Bill Everett, Joe Simon, and Tarpé Mills. Basil Wolverton's Spacehawk (which originated in "Circus" comics) made its "Target Comics" debut with issue #5, and ran for many issues. The superhero Target, created by cartoonist Dick Briefer under the pen nam "Dick Hamilton", was introduced in issue #10 (Nov. 1940), accompanied by the Targeteers the following issue. The "Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide" suggests that the first comic book letter column may have appeared in "Target Comics" #6. The page in question also has an early mention of comic-book collecting.) 
"Blue Bolt"'s title character superhero was created by Joe Simon, and "Blue Bolt" #2 (July 1940) featured the first pairing of the longstanding and pioneering creative team of Simon and Jack Kirby.
"4 Most", launched in 1941, was Novelty's answer to DC Comics' omnibus title "World's Finest Comics" and All American's "Comic Cavalcade".
"Young King Cole", debuting in 1945, was an anthology title headlined by one the comic genre's first private detectives.
In 1949, due to the growing criticism over violence in comic books, Novelty Press sold its assets to "Blue Bolt" cover artist L.B. Cole. Using his new assets, Cole began his own company, Star Publications.

Far Eastern Front in the Russian Civil War

During the Russian civil war, the Far Eastern part of the former Russian Empire was a battleground for violence between the Communists and the remnants of the Whites. The fighting in this front expanded from Outer Mongolia, through Eastern Siberia, and in the Ussuri and Amur districts of Outer Manchuria in Russia.
Combatants.
The fighting forces on the Communist side were the Red Army, Kuban Cossacks, Communist Mongolian militias, and the Far Eastern Republic. On the White side, there were local White army units, pro-white Mongolian militias, Mongolian government forces, and the Beiyang army. Allied intervention forces arrived which included 70,000 Imperial Japanese soldiers and 10,000 US Marines.
The Japanese Goals.
During the Bolshevik revolution, the Japanese were already gaining influence in Chinese Manchuria. They were surprised when the Bolsheviks successfully took power in Russia. While the Americans were interested in supporting Kolchak's White government, the Japanese aimed to take over Russian ports and coastal territories. In 1918 Japan occupied Vladivostok with the United States Marines.
The Japanese had plans of rapid expansion starting in Amur and Ussuri river region all the way to Lake Baikal. In response to the Russians' establishment of the Far Eastern Republic, the Japanese backed the Provisional Priamur Government.
The American Aims.
The United States was interested in helping Admiral Kolchak's government in Siberia, which was in need of aid.
They wanted to press the Red Army out of Siberia and allow the White Movement to establish control of Russia and defeat the Bolsheviks. A major contributing factor was the United States government fears that communism would spread through the U.S if the Bolsheviks won the civil war.
Communist/Bolshevik Response.
The Bolshevik effort in the Far East was the same as on the other fronts: to retake or hold on to territory of the former Russian Empire. The goal of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic (RSFSR) was to stop the Allied advance into Siberia. The Soviets set up the Far Eastern Republic as a buffer state to hold off the White and allied armies.
Mongolia.
The war expanded into Mongolia as White armies in the far east retreated. While others retreated to Japan or China some tried to hold on to Mongolia which was a Czarist puppet state. As the war dragged on, Mongolians were forced to take sides. Some joined the Communists, either by entering their armies or forming militias to help fight the Whites. Others went with the whites, as part of the puppet government's forces or militias. The Communists burned Buddhist temples and killed white supporters to terrify Mongolians into joining them, and the Whites used similar tactics.
Aftermath.
In the aftermath of the civil war was the Whites were forced into exile. The Americans left Siberia and the Russian far east in 1920. Japan held it even after the Whites were defeated, and would not withdraw until October 1922. With the war over the Soviet Government in Russia got to keep all of Russia's pre-war territories in the far east. Future clashes over territory in the region would continue into the next decade, invasions by Japan in 1938 and 1939.

Keith Webb Wright (born 9 January 1942) is a former Australian politician and convicted sex offender.
Born in Toowoomba, Queensland, he was educated at the University of Queensland and Kelvin Grove Teachers College in Brisbane before becoming a teacher and author.
On 17 May 1969, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland as the Labor member for Rockhampton South and after a seat redistribution, represented Rockhampton (1972–1984). In 1982, he became Leader of the Opposition, with Labor in 1983 coming within one seat (and perhaps 3,000 votes) of toppling the National Party government led by Premier Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen. Wright remained opposition leader until he left the Assembly in 1984, transferring to federal politics as the Labor MP for Capricornia in the Australian House of Representatives.
In 1993, he was charged with under-age sex offences and rape, and as a result lost his Labor endorsement. He contested the 1993 election as an independent, gaining 5.9% of the vote but losing to endorsed ALP candidate Marjorie Henzell. In December 1993 he was convicted and jailed for more than five years.
In 2006, the Australian Electoral Commission formed a new electoral division, taking territory from Capricornia and the neighbouring divisions of Hinkler, Maranoa and Wide Bay. The Commission suggested naming it the "Division of Wright" in honour of the poet Judith Wright, but inevitable association with Keith Wright led them to name it instead the Division of Flynn after John Flynn, founder of the Royal Flying Doctor Service. A Division of Wright, named after Judith Wright and based in the Gold Coast Hinterland, was first contested at the 2010 election.
Wright now runs a company, International Language Academy, which trains ESOL teachers in Southeast Asia.

Also the community turns out for the annual Fourth of July parade, including the town fire truck and various other participants.
Aggressive Christianity Missionary Training Corps.
Shim Ra Na Ekklisia (also called Miracle River) is located in Fence Lake. It is a small community of Christians about 10 miles to the east of the actual town.

<doc id="18415788" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18415788" title="Judiciary of Vermont">
Judiciary of Vermont

The Judiciary of Vermont is the state court system of Vermont, charged with Vermont law. All officers are considered state employees, whether elected or appointed.
Vermont Constitution.
The Vermont courts are established in the Vermont Constitution in sections 28-41 (Judiciary Department). The justices of the Vermont Supreme Court and judges of all lower courts except assistant judges and probate judges are hold six-year terms, which are renewable following a majority retention vote in the Vermont General Assembly.
All Vermont Constitution provides for a mandatory retirement of Supreme Court justices and lower court judges at 90 years of age, as prescribed by law by the General Assembly, or if the General Assembly has not so provided by law at the age of 70 or at the end of the term of election during which they attain the age of 70. The constitution also provides that justices and judges be given a pension as provided by law and that the chief justice "may from time to time appoint retired justices and judges to special assignments as permitted under the rules of the Supreme Court."
Supreme Court.
The Vermont Supreme Court is the state supreme court, based in the state capital of Montpelier. Because Vermont has no intermediate appellate courts, it is the sole state appellate court, mainly hearing appeals on questions of law from lower courts, although there are a few instances in which the Court has original jurisdiction. The Supreme Court also is responsible for administration of the Vermont court system; it makes state court procedural rules.
The Supreme Court is established in the Vermont Constitution which provides in section 29 that the court shall consist of a chief justice and four associate justices and in section 30 that:
In 2008, justices were paid $129,245 annually. This ranks 41st in the nation.
County courts.
The state constitution provides for the creation of lower courts that may have original and appellate jurisdiction and be divided into geographical and functional divisions, "as provided by law or by judicial rules adopted by the Supreme Court not inconsistent with law." The state constitution also provides that state courts may act as both courts of law and courts of equity.
Vermont Statutes have established a number of courts, each exercising jurisdiction in one of the 14 Vermont counties. The courts are based in shire towns (County seats), where the courthouses are located. The state's attorney may earn $89,003.20 annually. The county sheriff may earn $65,790.40 annually.
In 2010 the court system was integrated. The criminal, civil, family and environmental courts became part of a new Superior Court. The Probate Court will be merged with the family court in February 2011. That is when all county employees become state employees.
Superior courts.
Superior Courts exercise exclusive jurisdiction over most civil cases, including torts and lawsuits over small claims of $5000 or less. Superior courts also reviews decisions of lower courts and appeals to administrative agency decisions. Three judges, a presiding judge and two assistant judges sit on each Superior Court. The assistant judges (or side judges) are elected county officials, who sit with the judge in certain cases and are responsible for non-judicial county affairs as well, an unusual system unique to Vermont. Each Superior Court also has a court clerk and deputy court clerk, appointed by the court. The Superior Court clerk is also the county clerk and the clerk of the county court.
District courts.
District Courts hear almost all criminal cases and a few civil cases, including civil suspension of driver's licenses and fish and wildlife, traffic ticket, and municipal ordinance violations. There are 17 District Court judges: one in each county except for Chittenden County (the most populous in the state), which has six. A district judge may earn $122,865 annually.
Family courts.
Family courts hear family law matters, including marriage (divorce, annulment, desertion, and separation); child support; parentage; domestic violence and orders of protection for domestic abuse victims; juveniles (delinquency, abuse and neglect) and commitments to the Vermont State Hospital, the state psychiatric hospital. District Court judges, Superior Court judges, Family Court magistrates and assistant judges sit in Family Court. All Family Court matters except for child support are mainly decided by the presiding judge; child support orders are the responsibility of Family Court magistrates. No jury trials take place in Family Court. If one or both are available, side judges may sit with the presiding judge. In some jurisdictions, the Superior Court judge may be the presiding judge of the Family Court as well.
Probate courts.
Probate Courts deal with probate, wills and testamentary trusts, adoptions, guardianship, emancipation of minors, uniform gifts to minors, and name changes. There are 18 Probate Court judges, elected for four-year terms; Probate Court judges need not be attorneys. The clerk of the probate court is appointed. A typical salary for the judge is $51,542.40. A typical salary for the clerk is $30,721.60.
Vermont Environmental Court.
The Vermont Environmental Court is a specialized court dealing with environmental law. The Court hears appeals from municipal boards and commissions and appeals from Act 250 decisions as well as cases from the Agency of Natural Resources, Natural Resource Board, and municipal enforcement. There are two Environmental Court judges on the court, which is based in Barre.
Vermont Judicial Bureau.
The Vermont Judicial Bureau is a quasi-judicial body whose jurisdiction is over complaints issued by state and local law enforcement officers, including civil violation complaints (traffic tickets), municipal ordinances, fish and wildlife violations, hazing, and minors possessing alcohol. Defendants may admit to the complaint and pay the penalty, usually a fine, or can contest the violation cited and have the cases decided by a hearing officer. During the hearing, both parties may present evidence and call witnesses. The burden of proof for the state or municipality is clear and convincing evidence. Either party may appeal the decision in District Court. There are four hearing officers.
Budget.
The judiciary system budget was approximately $30 million in 2009.

List of cruisers of the Russian Navy

Cruisers of the Russian Imperial Navy (1873–1917).
Note on official classification.
Until 1892, there was no standardized name for ships of the cruiser type. They were classified as armoured frigates, armoured corvettes and even screw corvettes. The "Cruiser" \ «крейсер» designation appeared in 1878, but only for auxiliary non-protected ships. Starting in 1892 and up to 1907, all of these ships were divided between 1st rank cruisers and 2nd rank cruisers, although this division did not coincide with the delineation between armoured cruisers & protected cruisers. The designation "auxiliary cruiser" officially appeared in 1904. According to the new classification table of 1907, all cruisers, except auxiliary ships, were divided between "armoured cruisers" and "cruisers". During the first decades of the Soviet Navy the only one "cruiser" designation existed, but in 1949 cruisers were divided between "light cruisers", "heavy cruisers" and "training cruisers". Later "missile cruisers", "anti-submarine cruisers", "aircraft-carrying cruisers", "heavy nuclear missile cruisers" appeared.
Armoured cruiser.
This type of warship was invented by Russians. The ships were intended to conduct the traditional cruiser operations against merchant ships and their protectors. For this reason, they had been armed with heavy main guns and medium armour to fight with light cruisers. The ships also possessed relatively high speed to escape from an opponent's battleships. All of them were officially classified as 1st rank cruisers and were assigned to the Baltic Fleet.
Protected cruiser.
Russia had nearly not developed this British-designed type of ship, and had instead concentrated on armoured cruisers. Most of these ships were classified officially as 1st rank cruisers, they were assigned to the Baltic Fleet, with the exception of a handful of ships.
Yacht cruisers.
These ships were simply yachts equipped with large calibre artillery. "Svetlana" was protected, but the others were not.
Torpedo cruisers.
The Russian Navy classified these ships as "minnyi kreiser" \ «минный крейсер» (Torpedo Cruiser): something between cruiser and torpedo boat, and the direct predecessor of destroyers, but were rather larger and stronger than the destroyers of the 1900s (decade). The ships were purposed to struggle with an opponent's torpedo boats, as well as to serve as a torpedo boat squadron leader, escort ship, tow-ship, and other missions. Later, the first Russian destroyers were originally classified as torpedo cruisers.
Battlecruisers.
Actually, they were not battlecruisers, but rather fast super-dreadnoughts and the strongest warships of the world at the time of their launching.
Non-protected & auxiliary cruisers.
Commissioning of these ships was an extraordinary measure taken during the periods of political crises of 1878 and 1904–1905. Auxiliary cruisers, which were used in 1904–1905, were specially constructed or reconstructed as ships of "double destination": ocean liners at the times of peace and cruisers during war. Most of them were officially classified as cruisers and auxiliary cruisers and belonged to the Baltic Fleet (but two).
<br>
NOTE: There were some other Dobroflot liners used in the Navy during the Russo-Japanese War, but they were classified as transports.
Cruisers of the Soviet and modern Russian Navy.
Light Cruisers (KRL).
Legkiy kreiser \ «лёгкий крейсер» (КРЛ).
Heavy cruisers (TKR).
Tyazhelyi kreiser \ «тяжёлый крейсер» (ТКР). Prior to and during the Second World War, the Soviet Navy attempted to procure heavier cruiser types, including two different battlecruiser designs. Despite these attempts, not one ship of these types was commissioned into Soviet Navy.
Guided Missile Cruisers (RKR).
Raketnyi kreiser \ «ракетный крейсер» (РКР).
NOTE: Large Antisubmarine Ships of Project 1134A (NATO codename Kresta II) and Project 1134B (Kara) never classified as Cruisers in the Soviet Navy, nor were cruisers in reality: it was a type of large Frigates (due to arming of antisubmatine torpedo-missiles).
Heavy Nuclear Guided Missile Cruisers (TARKR).
Tyazhelyi atomnyi raketnyi kreiser \ «тяжёлый атомный ракетный крейсер» (ТАРКР). Were reclassified to Heavy Guided Missile Cruisers (TRKR) in 1997.<br>
Antisubmarine Cruisers (PKR).
Protivolodochnyi kreiser \ «противолодочный крейсер» (ПКР). Helicopter-carrying cruisers. Ships were purposed to searching and destroying opponent's guided missile and multi-purpose submarines at the remote boundaries of antisubmarine defence, consisting of ships' squadrons and cooperating with other antisubmarine ships and aircraft.
Heavy Aircraft-carrying Cruisers (TAKR).
Tyazhelyi avianesushchii kreiser \ «тяжёлый авианесущий крейсер» (ТАКР). Ships were purposed to air cover of patrol regions of Soviet ballistic missile submarines (to destroy opponent's antisubmarine helicopters and airplanes), as well as searching and destroying opponent's guided missile & multi-purpose submarines and (3rd purpose) to striking the opponent's above-water ships by guided missiles, consisting of ships' squadrons and cooperating with other fleets' forces. Despite the superficial resemblance, they were not aircraft carriers in that sense, in which this term is applicable to American and British carriers. They were not intended to be the main shock force of the Navy, but only a part of own strategic submarines' defense system (first three units). Fourth ship really became a large training base for fifth, her aircraft (Yak-141) was not completed and she remained with helicopters only, i.e. as antisubmarine cruiser. Fifth unit (and uncompleted sixth) were designed as ships of transitional type, and only seventh, non-completed nuclear "Ulyanovsk", although classified officially to cruisers, could become a first Russian relatively full aircraft carrier.
Auxiliary Cruisers (VKR).
Vspomogatel'nyi kreiser \ «Вспомогательный крейсер» (ВКР).

Scandal mac Bécce

Scandal mac Bécce (died 646) was a Dal nAraide king of the Cruithne in Ulaid (Ulster). He was the grandson of Fiachra Cáech (died 608), the brother of Fiachnae mac Báetáin (died 626), a king of all Ulaid.
In the 6th and 7th centuries the Dal nAraide were part of a confederation of Cruithne tribes in Ulaid (Ulster) and were the dominant members. Scandal was an ancestor of the branch of this family which settled in Mag nEinli, a plain between the Bann and Bush in County Antrim. His son Dúngal Eilni mac Scandail (died 681) bore a byname associated with this plain. This plain had been conquered by the Dal nAraide by the middle of the seventh century.
The chronology of the Kings of Dál nAraidi is difficult to ascertain between the Battle of Mag Roth in 637 and the plague of 666. Scandal is omitted from the king lists in the "Book of Leinster" and the "Laud Synchronisms". Scandal is called King of the Cruithne in his death obit in the annals however. he may have ruled from 637-646.

Back to Bacharach and David

Back To Bacharach and David is an Off-Broadway revue that featured the songs of Burt Bacharach and Hal David in a show created by Steve Gunderson and Kathy Najimy and directed by Najimy, with musical arrangements and orchestrations by Gunderson. The revue comprises the Bacharach/David songs from 1960-1970. 
Production history.
The show originally had a limited run at Steve McGraw's Club in New York City in September 1992 and starred Gunderson, Melinda Gilb, Susan Mosher and Carla Renata Williams. It workshopped with Alice Ripley and Lillias White. The show then ran at "Club 53" in New York City from March 11, 1993 through September 11, 1993, with Gunderson, Gilb, Mosher and White. 
The revue was produced by the North Coast Repertory Theatre in San Diego in August 2006 with Gunderson and Gilb in a production directed by original choreographer Javier Velasco, and was attended by Burt Bacharach himself, and later by Hal David, who had been a supporter of the show during its original Off Broadway run.
The revue was produced at the Music Box, Los Angeles, California, April 19, 2009 through May 17, 2009. Directed by Najimy, the cast featured "American Idol" finalist Diana DeGarmo, "American Idol" contestant Tom Lowe, Tressa Thomas and Susan Mosher. The show was revised and includes two songs not previously featured, including "What's New Pussycat," for DeGarmo. 
Another revue featuring the works of Bacharach and David, "The Look of Love", was produced on Broadway in 2003.
Concept and songs.
There is no narrative. 
Songs include "A House is Not A Home", "Alfie," "Always Something There to Remind Me", "Another Night," "Any Old Time of the Day," "Anyone Who Had a Heart," "April Fools," "Are You There With Another Girl," "Close to You," "Do You Know the Way to San Jose," "Don't Make Me Over," "I Just Have to ," "I Say a Little Prayer for You," "I'll Never Fall in Love Again," "Just Don't Know What to Do With Myself," "Knowing When to Leave," "Let Me Be Lonely," "Let Me Go to Him," "The Look of Love," "Message to Michael", "My Little Red Book," "Nikki," "One Less Bell to Answer," "Promises, Promises," "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head," "Reach Out for Me," "This Empty Place," "This Guy's in Love With You," "Trains and Boats and Planes," "24 Hours from Tulsa," "Walk on By," "What the World Needs Now Is Love," "Whoever You Are I Love You," and "You'll Never Get to Heaven."
Critical response.
Stephen Holden in his "New York Times" review of the 1993 production wrote: "Ms. Najimy has staged many songs as comic tableaux in a frenetic teen-age soap opera. Decked out in such tacky vintage paraphernalia as peace symbols, chain belts and go-go boots, the show's four performers...emote them with the sobby fervency of a high school clique having a collective hormone attack. What lifts "Back to Bacharach and David" above run-of-the-mill 60's nostalgia is the show's nearly perfect balance between tribute and comedy."

Crossroads (1976 film)

Crossroads is a 1976 short film directed by Bruce Conner. It features 36 minutes of extreme slow-motion replays of the July 25, 1946 Operation Crossroads Baker underwater nuclear test at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific. The event was captured for research purposes by five hundred cameras stationed on unmanned planes, high-altitude aircraft, boats near the blast, and from more distant points on land around the Atoll. The location was selected in part because the network of islands formed an almost complete ellipse around the detonation site, allowing for a comprehensive documentation of the event from numerous angles. The music is by Terry Riley with additional soundtrack effects by Patrick Gleeson. The first section of the film is coupled with an apparently synchronous on-location soundtrack. It is not initially evident that these sounds are not authentically tied to the images they accompany. Conner first allows doubt of his simulation when he breaks the sound delay displacement to set the sound of the blast "in sync" with the visual event. In the first shots of the film, the blast is heard moments after it is seen. This accounts for the disparity between the speeds of light and sound. Having the visual and sonic events occur simultaneously, which is to say out of what would be actual sync, makes the depiction an aesthetic simulation of the event rather than a document of an actual one. This choice serves as a deliberate cinematizing of its content.

BASFI

The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index was named for the location of the institution (Bath England) where authors "A. Calin and co-workers" developed this validated index to determine the degree of functional limitation in patients with the inflammatory autoimmune disease Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS). These researchers recognized that although treatment for AS is focused on pain control and the improvement of function, the available methods of assessing function were not specific to AS and were inadequately validated. In their seminal 1994 publication, Calin and his associates stated that
"after pain and stiffness (measured by the BASDAI test), one of the most important complaints of patients with AS is disability."(Calin et al., 1994, p 2281).
The ten questions that comprise the BASFI were chosen with input from patients with AS. The first 8 questions evaluate activities related to functional anatomical limitations due to the course of this inflammatory disease. The final 2 questions evaluate the patients’ ability to cope with everyday life.
The Questions on the BASFI.
1. Putting on your socks or tights without help or aids (e.g. sock aids)? 
2. Bending forward from the waist to pick up a pen from the floor without an aid? 
3. Reaching up to a high shelf without help or aids (e.g. helping hand)? 
4. Getting up out of an armless dining room chair without using your hands or any other help? 
5. Getting up off the floor without any help from lying on your back? 
6. Standing unsupported for 10 minutes without discomfort? 
7. Climbing 12-15 steps without using a handrail or walking aid (one foot on each step)? 
8. Looking over your shoulder without turning your body? 
9. Doing physically demanding activities (e.g. physiotherapy exercises, gardening or sports)? 
10. Doing a full day activities whether it be at home or work? 
A visual analogue scale (with 0 being "easy" and 10 "impossible) is used to answer the questions on the test. The authors stated that this range of scoring improves both the sensitivity of the index to change in the state of the disease and improves the test's capacity to elicit a range of responses across the entire scale (Calin et al., 1994). 
The mean of the ten scales gives the BASFI score – a value between 0 and 10.

Naveed is a single from Our Lady Peace's debut album of the same name, "Naveed". It was released April 17, 1995 in the United States and in January 1996 in the United Kingdom as the fifth and final single from the album. The song performed well on the charts, and became a smash hit in Canada, although it was not officially released to radio there. The music video also climbed the charts on MuchMusic, and in 1998 was ranked the thirty-third favourite video of all time.
Since the album's release, Naveed has been a staple in the band's live performances. The song was also performed on Late Night with Conan O'Brien. It is also many times combined with another song, most notably "Life" from the album "Spiritual Machines". This form of the song appeared on the band's 2003 album, "Live".
Music video.
The music video for "Naveed", directed by George Vale, alternates between the band performing in front of a crowd, and children playing in an overly brightened salvage yard meant to represent a war-torn country. A large military tank and other war symbols play a role in the video.

Fuji Station

History.
In 1889, when the section of the Tōkaidō Main Line connecting Shizuoka with Kōzu was completed, stations were built at Suzukawa (Yoshiwara) and Iwabuchi (Fujikawa), with Kashima village in between without a train station. Due to the strong petition of the local residents, and political pressure applied by Oji Paper Company, who had established a paper mill nearby, a station was opened on April 21, 1909 and named “Fuji Station”. The terminus of the Minobu Line was established at Fuji Station on July 13, 1913. The station building was rebuilt in 1964. Container freight services began operations from 1994.
Layout.
The Fuji Station has three island platforms serving six tracks, which are connected each other an overpass, which leads to station building, which is also constructed over the tracks. The station building has automated ticket machines, TOICA automated turnstiles and a manned "Green Window" service counter.

Fujikawa Station (Shizuoka)

Station history.
Fujikawa Station first opened as on February 1 1889, when the section of the Tōkaidō Main Line connecting Shizuoka with Kōzu was completed. The initial plan for the Tōkaidō Main Line was to construct stations in accord with the traditional 53 stages of the Tōkaidō road. However, in between Fujikawa-juku and Kanbara-juku there was a traditionally unnumbered intermediary post station where a branch road led to the pilgrimage location of Mount Minobu. It was decided to build a railroad station at this location, and to bypass nearby Kambara Town instead. This led to a predicable uproar from Kambara, so Kambara Station was built a year later, but at an inconvenient distance outside of town, so as to keep the spacing between stations fairly even. A station in the center of Kambara was not actually built until Shin-Kambara Station in 1968. Iwabuchi Station was renamed "Fujikawa" in 1970. Regularly scheduled freight services were discontinued in 1972, and all freight services by 1985. 
Layout.
Fujikawa Station has a single side platform serving Track 1 and an island platform serving Track 2 and Track 3, connected to the station building by an overpass. Track 2 is used for through transit of express trains. The station building has automated ticket machines, TOICA automated turnstiles and a manned "Green Window" service counter.

Frank C. Hibben

Frank Cumming Hibben (December 5, 1910-June 11, 2002) was a well-known archaeologist whose research focused on the U.S. Southwest. As a professor at the University of New Mexico (UNM) and writer of popular books and articles, he inspired many people to study archaeology. He was also controversial, being suspected of scientific fraud during his studies of Paleo-Indian cultures.
Hibben was born in Lakewood, Ohio and became interested in archaeology as a child, working a number of summers at a number of digs. He received his bachelor's degree in archaeology from Princeton University in 1933 and a master's degree in zoology from the UNM in 1936. While a graduate student, Hibben was put in charge of the university's archaeology collections (the core of what became the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology). He returned East for one year to attend Harvard University, which awarded him a Ph.D. in anthropology in 1940. Hibben then taught at UNM until his retirement, except for a period of service in the U.S. Navy during World War II. During much of his career, Hibben was the director of the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology.
Hibben's first marriage and subsequent investments made him a millionaire. In 2000, he donated part of his fortune to build an archaeology research building at UNM. (Due to the controversies surrounding his career, the decision to name the new building after him was questioned.)
When Hibben died, the remainder of his fortune was used, as he had directed, to endow scholarships at UNM.
The primary source of the controversies was Hibben's claim to have found a deposit with pre-Clovis artifacts (including projectile points, which he termed "Sandia points") in Sandia Cave (in the Sandia Mountains near Albuquerque, New Mexico). Hibben believed the layers to be about 25,000 years old, much older than the Paleo-Indian cultures previously documented in the U.S. Southwest. The layers also included the bones of Pleistocene species such as camels, mastodons, and horses.
The 25,000 year age for the "Sandia Man" deposits was a best guess based on the strata in the cave, and was later called into question, in part through radiocarbon dating. Also, research notes by Wesley Bliss (who had excavated in the cave in 1936) and others indicate that animal burrowing led to a mixing of deposits. The notion of a "Sandia Man" occupation of the U.S. Southwest is no longer accepted by professional archaeologists, but that in itself is not the source of controversy. Instead, some researchers believe that artifacts were "salted" (fraudulently placed) in the cave deposits to support the notion of the "Sandia Man" occupation. Those who believe that fraud was committed often suspect Hibben of being involved in the fraud.
The evidence is inconclusive, however, and Hibben maintained his innocence in the matter until his death.
In 1943, Hibben described a visit to Chinitna Bay on the west side of Cook Inlet in Alaska, where he reported finding Yuma-like projectile points like those found at the Clovis Site in New Mexico and a projectile point similar to those produced by the Folsom culture, who lived on the High Plains and adjacent regions 10,000 years ago. In addition to the projectile points, he reported finding mammoth bones. A later investigation of the geology and geoarchaeology of Chinitna Bay using personal notes, photographs, and directions personally supply by Hibben successfully relocated the locations and strata from which the mammoth bones, Yuma-like projectile points, and projectile point "possibly affiliated with, Folsom" were reported. They found that the strata from in which Hibben reported finding Folsom- and Yuma-like projectile points and mammoths bones all accumulated during the Late Holocene in "a muddy, intertidal environment". As result, they concluded that the projectile points are not associated with any Paleo-Indian cultures and the identification of the bones as being those of a mammoth is questionable.
Hibben's research on later cultures was far less controversial. While a graduate student he excavated and reported on Riana Ruin in the Rio Chama drainage. His Harvard dissertation was based on extensive field studies of the Gallina Culture of northern New Mexico. In 1954 he began a long term research project on Pottery Mound, a site best known for its many kiva murals. Hibben also excavated at Comanche Springs south of Albuquerque, locating Spanish Colonial period and other remains.
In addition to being an archaeologist, Hibben was a big-game hunter, and was awarded the Weatherby Hunting and Conservation Award in 1964. He also served in various capacities related to wild animals, such as chairman of the Albuquerque Zoological Board (1960–1970) and chairman of the New Mexico State Game and Fish Commission (1961–1971). Hibben's big game experience carried over into a series of popular books and articles on hunting.

Hassan and Marcus

Hassan and Marcus () is an Egyptian film released in 2008.
Background.
Being the first collaboration between Adel Imam and Omar Sharif, arguably the most prominent actors in Egypt and the Middle East, the movie was a much-anticipated summer blockbuster. However, its message proved so controversial that Facebook groups sporting Adel Imam's picture in Coptic garb called for a boycott of his movies, and the resulting emotional distress is reported to have prompted Imam to move from his home in Cairo to a summer house in Porto Marina, a resort on Egypt's northern coast. Imam, Sharif and other collaborators on the film have vehemently defended its content and criticised many conservatives and religious extremists who consider it blasphemous.
Plot.
When the lives of Mahmoud, a Muslim Sheikh (Omar Sharif) and Boulos, a Christian Priest (Adel Imam) are threatened by religious extremists on both sides, the Egyptian government inducts them into a witness protection program that requires them to disguise themselves as the Christian Marcus and a Muslim Sheikh, Hassan el-Attar, respectively.
When, unwittingly, they move into the same building, a friendship blossoms that must, along with a romance between the protagonists' children, withstand the difficulties of prejudice and social persecution.
Hassan and Morcos doesn't attempt to name the reasons for the tension between Christians and Muslims. But according to the political writer and Coptic Christian Sameh Fawzi, the conflicts have nothing to do with religion.
Themes.
The film addresses issues of religious extremism, intolerance and sectarian violence, and emphasises the possibility of friendship and love between members of different religions.
Imam said of the film: 
Criticism.
Muslim movie star Adel Imam was accused of apostasy by Facebook activists over his role as a Coptic Christian priest in the film. The group accused him of promoting Christianity and discouraged Muslims from seeing the film. The group's mission statement read “This man is promoting conversion to Christianity and I am calling upon you to boycott him." Another group was also created for the same purpose under the title “Boycott Imam’s new movie.” The criticism of Imam occurred during a tense period marked by violent clashes between Muslims and Coptic Christians in Egypt.

<doc id="18416193" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18416193" title="Order of the Star (France)">
Order of the Star (France)

The Order of the Star () was an order of chivalry founded on 6 November 1351 by John II of France in imitation of the Order of the Garter recently founded (1347) by Edward III of England. The inaugural ceremony of the order took place on 6 January 1352 at Saint-Ouen, from which it is sometimes called the Order of Knights of the Noble House of Saint Ouen. 
The order was inspired by the Geoffroy de Charny, theoretician of chivalry. In part it was intended to prevent the disaster of Crécy and to this end only success on the battlefield counted towards a member's merit, not success in tournaments. By its statutes, members also received a small payment and the order provided housing in retirement. They were sworn not to turn their back on the enemy or retreat more than four steps. This last provision cost the lives of ninety members of the order at the Battle of Mauron in 1352, and at the Battle of Poitiers in 1356 cost the king his freedom when many, if not most, of his fellow knights of the Star lost their lives. The Order fell rapidly into disuse during John's captivity in London, but afterwards the nominal ranks swelled so enormously that by the time of Charles V its bestowal was meaningless. 
The badge of the order was a collar with a white star on red enamel; the device "Monstrant regibus astra viam" ("the star show the way to kings") refers to the Three Kings led by the Star of Bethlehem. If an existing manuscript illumination ("illustration") depicting the founding meeting of the Order is accurate, the Order's garb consisted in red robes lined with vair bearing eight-pointed black stars set with various gemstones worn on the upper left side of the mantle. The exact size of this star and the number and value of the gemstones with which it was set varied according to the knight's own choice since the this star was made at the knight's own expense. The insignia also included a gold ring of which the bezel was circular, enamelled red with an eight-pointed star in white enamel at its center and extending the diameter of the bezel, while the motto of the Order was inscribed on the outside of the ring around this bezel. While the Order itself was short-lived, the use of an eight-pointed star worn on the left breast became very influential in the design of the insignia of many later orders of chivalry and still later orders of merit. 
The Order also had a red banner sprinkled with white eight-pointed stars and bearing an image of the Virgin at its center.

Tactile programming language

Tactile programming is the specification, development, interaction with and interpretation of computer programs through a touch-centric interface. It is based on the ideas behind visual programming languages, particularly in the interaction and development of software with visual-graphic, rather than text-based, interpretations which can be "dragged-and-dropped" with a mouse in order to develop the software's functionality.
However, tactile programming applies the visual programming paradigm within a touch-centric framework: 
At the moment, the only example which exist of tactile programming IDEs is "Visual AgenTalk", which is implemented within AgentSheets. Similar drag and drop programming can be found in the Etoys language (part of Squeak), in Alice and in Scratch.

Birtukan Mideksa

Birtukan Mideksa (also spelled Birtukan Midekssa; born 1975) is an Ethiopian politician and former judge who is the founder and leader of the opposition party, the Unity for Democracy and Justice (UDJ) party. 
Early life.
Birtukan Mideksa was born in Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia and attended the Yekatit 12 secondary school (also known as Etege Menen). After graduating from high school, she attended Addis Ababa University where she graduated with a Bachelors Degree in Law. She practiced law in the third district of the federal judiciary.
Career.
While she was working for the federal judiciary, Birtukan was appointed to be a judge at the 3rd district court of the federal first instant court. During that time, she presided over a high profile case of the former defense minister and top ranking official of TPLF, Siye Abraha who was accused of corruption. She set the defendant free on bail, and was surprised minutes later when government authorities arrested Siye while he was walking out of the court accompanied by his family and friends.
Politics.
Mideksa decided to join a political party to help bring about change, including recognition of the rule of law, and full respect for the implementation of the constitution. She joined the Party, and later, Coalition for Unity and Democracy (CUD). In the election of 2005, her party won over a third of the seats. Party members believed they would have won even more seats if not for voting and counting irregularities. After the election, the governing party started to round up opposition party leaders, Mideksa, who was convicted of attempting to overthrow the constitutional order and was sentenced to life in prison. She was pardoned in 2007 after lengthy negotiations and after she, along with other leaders of the opposition, spent 18 months in prison. 
Mideksa later founded UDJ (Unity for Democracy and Justice) with the same principles that guided CUD. The need for having the new party name came from the fact that the ruling party's election commission awarded to a splinter group from CUD (aka Kinijit). Birtukan was elected to be a chairperson of the UDJ, which has the goal of bringing about change in Ethiopia by peaceful means.
Life sentence.
On December 28, 2008, Mideksa was re-arrested. Her 2007 pardon was revoked and she was sentenced to life in prison. Human Rights Watch called the arrest politically motivated. The Ethiopian government claimed that her pardon had been conditional on "an apology for her crimes," and that it had ordered her re-arrest after hearing reports that she had publicly denied having apologized for her actions or asking for a pardon. Elizabeth Blunt of the BBC said that since her arrest, Mideksa, whom she described as “one of the younger and more charismatic leaders of the coalition which did so astonishingly well against the ruling party in the 2005 elections,” had become “even more of a heroine, attracting widespread sympathy as a single mother separated from her baby daughter.” 
In December 2009, Amnesty International categorized Birtukan's imprisonment as "unjust and politically motivated" The organization also launched an international campaign demanding her release, challenging the Ethiopian government's claim that her incarceration was a legal matter. Many of her supporters refer to her as Ethiopia's Aung San Suu Kyi, the Burmese prisoner of conscience.
In December 2009 Amnesty International categorized Birtukan Mideksa's imprisonment as "unjust and politically motivated". It launched an international campaign demanding her release, challenging the Ethiopian government's claim that her incarceration was a legal matter. When asked about her release at a December 2009 news conference, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, who rarely refers to her by name, replied, "There will never be an agreement with anybody to release Birtukan," he said. "Ever. Full stop. That's a dead issue."
On October 6, 2010, Mideksa was released from prison. According to government spokesman Shimeles Kemal, Mideksa submitted a pardon plea in October 2010, while the justice ministry quoted a statement in which she expressed regret for denying her 2007 pardon. The United Kingdom's Minister for Africa, Henry Bellingham, welcomed her release, stating "This is an important step forward. We have always taken the view that her re-imprisonment was not in Ethiopia's interest and a solution should be found ... for her to be released." Amnesty International maintained that Mideksa had been a prisoner of conscience, stating that "she was imprisoned solely for the peaceful exercise of her right to freedom of expression and association."
In 2011, Mideksa was awarded the Reagan-Fascell Democracy Fellowship of the U.S. National Endowment for Democracy, giving her five months in Washington, D.C. to "study the principles of democracy."
As of 30 March 2013, Mideksa was a fellow at Harvard University's W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Research.

Sod (word)

Sod in British English is a somewhat offensive, pejorative term for a person, derived from "sodomite" but rarely nowadays used with this meaning. As an insult, it is generally teamed with 'off', i.e., 'sod off' meaning to get lost/go away/fuck off. It can generally be applied to refer to a person in a most basic sense and frequently preceded by a modifying adjective (“That crazy sod almost ran me over!”). It can be used as many different parts of speech – e.g. in the imperative mood, “Sod off, you slag!”; or in adjective form, “sodding bastard”. Such uses as “Sod it!” and “Sod this” are often exclamations of frustration.

Washington County Museum of Fine Arts

Washington County Museum of Fine Arts is an art museum located in Hagerstown, Maryland, United States. The building is located off Park Circle and serves as a centerpiece in Hagerstown City Park. The museum was donated in 1929 by Mr. and Mrs. William Singer, Jr. It was completed in 1931 and two wings were added in 1949. The Museum provides residents and visitors with access to a nationally recognized permanent collection and a rotating schedule of exhibitions, musical concerts, lectures, films, art classes and special events for children and adults throughout the year. The collections include 19th & early 20th Century American Art, Old Masters, and Decorative art.
Washington County Museum of Fine Arts has no entrance fee and relies on public and private donations. The museum is accredited by the American Alliance of Museums (AAM).
History of the Museum.
The New York architectural firm of Hyde & Shepherd designed the original building for the Washington County Museum of Fine Arts. Built in the neo-Georgian style, the building is red brick trimmed with local limestone. The original facade features the museum’s name inscribed in large capitals flanked by rosettes. Inset in the rooftop balustrade, a panel showing an artist’s palette further denotes the building’s use. Founder Anna Singer frequently referred to the original structure as the “first unit” of the building. She followed through with this plan for enlargement with her 1946 offer to fund two new wings, which were completed in 1949. A later addition, begun in 1994, formed an open courtyard around the original entrance.
Architects Hyde & Shepherd designed a building that would sit nobly behind the lake and the cornerstone was placed on July 15, 1930. The Museum opened its doors to the public on September 16, 1931. Since then the Museum's collection has grown to over 6,000 art objects.
The Founders.
While the artist William Henry Singer, Jr. and his wife Anna Brugh Singer lived most of their lives in Europe, the couple bestowed a rare legacy on the people of Washington County. In 1931, the Singers gave the Museum of Fine Arts to the community along with a substantial collection of American and European art. The gift was motivated by Anna's deep affection towards her hometown of Hagerstown. The couple continued to make gifts to the Museum throughout their lives. In 1949, Anna greatly expanded the original museum with the addition of two wings given as a memorial to her late husband.
Devoted to each other and to William’s artistic pursuits, William and Anna Singer traveled throughout the United States and Europe, making friends with artists and gaining exposure to the artistic world. 
Mr. Singer was an talented American post-impressionist painter influenced by the European atheistic crosscurrents of the late 19th century and the son of a Pittsburg steel magnate. Singer's mature work concentrated almost exclusively on the isolated mountains and fjords of Norway, a country that he adopted almost as a homeland. His major achievement was an interpretation of the majestic scenery of Norway.
Anna was clearly the more outgoing of the pair. She spent much of her time entertaining guests at the couple’s Dutch and Norwegian homes and developing the couple’s collection of artwork. Apart from founding the Washington County Museum of Fine Arts, the couple made numerous philanthropic gifts to churches, towns, and hospitals in Norway, the Netherlands, and the United States. After William’s death in 1943, Anna turned much of her attention to finding suitable homes for the objects in their collection and supporting art institutions. She founded The Singer Laren Museum and theater in Laren, the Netherlands, in 1956, and remained an enthusiastic supporter of the visual and performing arts until her own death in 1962.
The Collection.
The strength of the Museums’ Collection has always been in 18th and early 20th Century art with paintings from such artists as Benjamin West and Thomas Sully. The American landscape tradition is represented with works by Thomas Cole, Thomas Moran, Frederic Edwin Church, Jasper Cropsey, Albert Bierstadt, George Innes, John Frederick Kensett 
and other members of the Hudson River School. Classic works by American impressionists Childe Hassam, and Willard Leroy Metcalf, came into the collection through William and Anna Singer’s friendships with these artists. The Ashcan School has excellent examples of paintings by George Luks, Robert Henri, William Merritt Chase, Arthur B. Davies, and Eduard Steichen. A small but significant groups of European, Asian, African art are complimented by art Decco glass by Tiffany and Lalique. Contemporary and early American art and the pottery of the eccentric George Ohr fill out the WCMFA’s diverse collection. Along with American Decorative and Folk art, The Museum has always been interested in Maryland art and its collection boasts portraits by the Charles Willson Peale family of painters including Rembrandt Peale and Sarah Miriam Peale. European Old Masters such as ”Saints Mary Magdalene and Paul” by Giovanni Mazone and Jusepe de Ribera are hung in the museum’s Schrieber Gallery. The Singers acquired an important group of thirteen works by French sculptor Auguste Rodin including his "Saint John the Baptist" in Amsterdam in 1931. At the same time, Mrs. Singer acquired a study of Lincoln for Mt. Rushmore by Gutzon Borglum. After Mrs. Singer death, the museum has continued to collect 20th-century and Contemporary art and owns significant works by Milton Avery, Philip Guston, Norman Rockwell, Frank Stella, Helen Frankenthaler, Grace Hartigan and Robert Indiana.

Zero Order Phase is the debut solo album by former Nevermore guitarist Jeff Loomis. It was released on September 30, 2008 through Century Media Records. The album was produced by Neil Kernon and features guest appearances by guitarists Ron Jarzombek, Pat O'Brien, and the jazz bassist Michael Manring. An instrumental album, "Zero Order Phase" was recorded in March 2008 at Robert Lang Studios in Seattle, Washington. In addition to Loomis on guitar, keyboards and bass, the album features ex-Nevermore member Mark Arrington on drums.
History.
Jeff Loomis explained in an interview that the album had been written after the end of "This Godless Endeavor" tour. Loomis wrote two months before starting production. "Zero Order Phase" was recorded during a month and a half, at the Robert Lang Studios in Richmond Beach, Washington, with producer Neil Kernon and featuring the former Nevermore drummer, Mark Arrington. The choice of Kernon to produce the album had been made several years before while both he and Loomis were working on the third Nevermore album "Dreaming Neon Black". Loomis told Kernon that "if I ever did a solo project he would produce it." During the recordings Loomis commented about the album's production, saying: "Being able to do this entire recording with Neil is really amazing as well. We've done some great work in the past, but being able to focus on an entire instrumental record is going to be great".
The album also features several guest appearances. Ron Jarzombek splits solos with Loomis on "Jato Unit", former Nevermore bandmate Pat O'Brien-who joined Cannibal Corpse after recording "The Politics of Ecstasy"-on "Race Against Disaster", jazz musician Michael Manring on "Cashmere Shiv" and producer Kernon playing a fretless guitar solo on the same track. As Loomis explained in an interview with Komodo Rock, because the guest musicians lived in different parts of the United States, he e-mailed recordings of the rhythm guitar and drums. Each guest recorded his solos at his own home studio and sent the tracks back to Loomis in Seattle.
Critical reception.
"Zero Order Phase" was described as "a good instrumental guitar CD" by About.com reviewer Chad Bowar. He also praised Loomis stating: "excellent guitar skills [...] technical riffs, creative solos and nonstop shredding". Ryan Ogle of Blabbermouth.net said the album was "one goddamned fiery tribute to the instrumental shred lords that have inspired his Loomis playing".
Eduardo Rivadavia of Allmusic wrote: "guitarist Jeff Loomis has unearthed the instrumental guitar hero template that was briefly made popular by Joe Satriani in the late '80s and early '90s," he also stated that "tracks like 'Shouting Fire at a Funeral,' 'Jato Unit,' and 'Devil Theory' are entrenched in the metallic music ingredients he Loomis is renowned for." 'Azure Haze' and 'Sacristy', were defined as "sweeping ballads"; on the last one, Loomis was again compared with Joe Satriani, Rivadavia stated: "admittedly very Satriani-esque."

Jacques Guillemeau (1550–1613) was a French surgeon from Orléans. He is credited for making pioneer contributions in the fields of obstetrics, ophthalmology and pediatrics.
He was a surgeon at Hôtel-Dieu de Paris, and a favored student of Ambroise Paré (1510–1590), who was also his father-in-law. Guillemeau, like Paré, was a surgeon to French royalty.
In 1584 Guillemeau published "Traité des maladies de l'oeil" ("Treatise on eye diseases"), considered one of the best Renaissance-era works in ophthalmic medicine. He is also credited for providing the first description involving repair of palpebral coloboma, an eyelid defect he referred to as "paupieres accurcies".
In 1609 he published "De l'heureux accouchement des femmes" ("The happy delivery of women"), the first description of a method of assisted breech delivery popularized by other physicians, and sometimes known as the "Mauriceau-Smellie-Veit maneuver". Guillemeau was a practitioner of the podalic version for use in cases of placenta praevia, a procedure earlier revived by Ambroise Paré. 
Other publications by Guillemeau include "Tables anatomiques" and "La chirurgie française".

Finningley railway station

Finningley railway station was a railway station built to serve the villages of Finningley and Blaxton, South Yorkshire, England.
History.
The first railway station to be built was some to the west of the level crossing on the main Bawtry to Thorne road (A614). The second station, still in South Yorkshire, was on the east of the level crossing, some west of the county boundary. It was located on the Doncaster to Lincoln Line approximately from RAF Finningley (now Robin Hood Doncaster Sheffield Airport). Although the station closed to passengers on 11 September 1961 it was opened specially for trains from Doncaster to the Finningley Air Show in the early 1960s and on one occasion to serve the Royal Train when H.M. The Queen visited the Royal Air Force airfield.
Future.
Nowadays only the now derelict platforms remain, along with the former station buildings (which are now a private residence) and the signal box, which remains in use to operate the adjacent level crossing. 
Planning permission for a new station slightly further north to serve the airport has recently been granted by Doncaster Council and discussions regarding station design and service levels took place between the local authority, Network Rail and the various TOCs with a view to opening the new station in 2012 (which has not yet happened). A 2012 report by Network Rail stated that more trains on the line would be required to make the station viable.

Silt fence

A silt fence, sometimes (misleadingly) called a "filter fence," is a temporary sediment control device used on construction sites to protect water quality in nearby streams, rivers, lakes and seas from sediment (loose soil) in stormwater runoff. Silt fences are widely used on construction sites in North America and elsewhere, due to their low cost and simple design, although their effectiveness in controlling sediment is often rather limited, due to problems with design, installation and/or maintenance.
Design and installation.
Silt fences are perimeter controls, typically used in combination with sediment basins and sediment traps, as well as erosion controls, which are designed to retain sediment in place where soil is being disturbed by construction processes (i.e., land grading and other earthworks).
A typical fence consists of a piece of synthetic filter fabric (also called a geotextile) stretched between a series of wooden or metal fence stakes along a horizontal contour level. The stakes are installed on the downhill side of the fence, and the bottom edge of the fabric is trenched into the soil and backfilled on the uphill side. The stormwater slowly passes through the fence while depositing its sediments on the uphill side of the fence. The fence is not designed to concentrate or channel stormwater. The fence is installed on a site before soil disturbance begins, and is placed down-slope from the disturbance area.
Sediment is captured by silt fences primarily through ponding of water and settling, rather than filtration by the fabric. Sand and silt tends to clog the fabric, and then the sediments settle in the temporary pond. 
Super silt fence.
Some government jurisdictions in the United States recommend or require the use of a reinforced fence, sometimes called a "super" silt fence or an enhanced silt fence, on some construction sites. This design uses filter fabric reinforced by a wire mesh or chain link fence. The metal backing gives the fence increased strength to resist the weight of soil and water which may be trapped by the fence in a large drainage area, and discourages construction site operators from driving vehicles over the fence. However, an improper installation of a super silt fence can create an inadvertent sediment basin if the filter fabric becomes clogged. This typically causes flooding, failure of the fence, and increased downstream pollution.
Effectiveness.
Silt fence fabrics (geotextiles) tested in laboratory settings have shown to be effective at trapping sediment particles. Although there have been few field tests of silt fences installed at construction sites, these tests have shown generally poor results. (Effectiveness testing involved measurements for both total suspended solids and turbidity.) Other studies and articles about silt fence usage and practice document problems with installation and maintenance, implying poor performance.
Silt fences may perform poorly for a variety of reasons, including improper location (e.g. placing fence in an area with concentrated stormwater flows), improper installation (e.g. failure to adequately embed and backfill the lower edge of fabric in the soil) and lack of maintenance. The fabric may become damaged with holes and tears if construction materials are stored next to or on top of the fence. During various phases of construction at a site, a silt fence may be removed relocated and reinstalled multiple times. It may be difficult to maintain effectiveness of a silt fence under such operating conditions. Location of fences in areas with high flows may lead to fence failures.
Static slicing installation.
Some state agencies recommend an installation technique called "static slicing" as an improved method for ensuring effectiveness and longevity of a silt fence system on a construction site. The technique involves inserting a narrow blade into the soil and simultaneously inserting the silt fence fabric while the blade is moving. This step is followed by mechanical soil compaction, setting of fence posts, and attaching the fabric.

Harry Rosenthal

Harry Rosenthal (15 May c. 1893 – 10 May 1953) was an orchestra leader, composer, pianist and actor.
Biography.
Rosenthal was born in Belfast in 1893, and by the 1920s he was in London where he had a thriving musical career as a composer, bandleader and pianist, including composing five operettas which met with great success. He came to the United States by 1929, when he wrote songs for Herbert Stothart's musical "Polly" on Broadway, and in 1930 acted in Ring Lardner and George S. Kaufman's play "June Moon", which was revived in 1933. After he met Edward, the Prince of Wales at a reception, he accompanied the heir to the British throne on a world tour.
Rosenthal's film career began in 1931 and ended in 1948, during which time he worked on 19 films, playing pianists, orchestra leaders and also non-musical roles, as well as composing music (for "The Sin of Harold Diddlebock") and conducting (on "For Me and My Gal"). In the early 1940s, Rosenthal was part of writer-director Preston Sturges' unofficial "stock company" of character actors, appearing in all of Sturges' films from "The Great McGinty" (1940) through "The Sin of Harold Diddlebock" (1947) with the exception of "Hail the Conquering Hero".
Both in New York and in Hollywood, Rosenthal was often mentioned in gossip columns, surprisingly so, given the small size of the parts he played. His death in 1953, from a heart attack, was similarly noted.

Mount Toromocho

Mount Toromocho, meaning in Spanish "a bull with no horns", is a mountain in the Junín Region, Peru that sits next to the long established mining camp of Morococha and hosts a large polymetallic metal deposit. It is now owned by the Aluminum Corporation of China (Chinalco) who are planning to establish a large open pit mine on the mountain to produce 210,000 tonnes copper annually.
History.
The mineralisation on Toromocho has been known and mined on a small scale for many years and was drilled by both the Cerro de Pasco Corporation and its successor (after nationalization) Centromin between 1966 and 1976 but it was evidently not considered worth exploiting, possibly due to lack of finance in the case of Centromin and the spectre of nationalization in the case of Cerro, or because it did not look economically viable at the prevailing metal prices.
Peru Copper Inc was formed in February 2004 and took over the Toromocho option that had been successfully bid for from Centromin by its predecessor company. The five year option required certain expenditures which Peru Copper completed satisfactorily and the option was exercised on 5 May 2008. There is no indication of any further payment for the exercise of the option.
In the meantime on 11 July 2007 Chinalco purchased Vancouver listed Peru Copper Inc for C$840 million and it became a wholly owned subsidiary of Chinalco. The new owner now plans to establish an open pit copper mine at a cost of US$2.16 billion to produce 210,000 tonnes of copper annually.
The deposit and its resources.
Much of the technical information comes from a report prepared by Independent Mining Consultants of Tucson, Arizona entitled Toromocho Project Technical Report, Prepared For Peru Copper, Inc.
The mountain of Toromocho is located about 140 km east of Lima on the main road to La Oroya. High tension power lines pass close by (although inadequate for Toromocho at present) as does the Central Railroad though part of this may have to be relocated as it runs over the projected limit of the open pit. It is next to the mining camp of Morococha where SIMSA and Pan American operate underground silver/lead/zinc mines. It is not clear how Toromocha will affect these operations but it has already been decided to move part of the Morococha mining camp. Chinalco is offering guaranteed housing and US$2,000 compensation to residents that have to relocate due to the development of the mine, and the offer has been accepted by a majority of the population via a referendum according to a BBC report.
The deposit is very high with elevations over the deposit ranging from 4,700 metres (15400 feet) to 4,900 metres (16,100 feet). Neither humans nor diesel powered machinery work very well at that altitude as anyone who travels up from Lima on the main road over the 4,818 metre (15,800 feet) El Ticlio pass realises as the engine starts to struggle towards the top. Also there is anecdotal evidence of geologists being quite unable to understand their notes made on top of the mountain due to the befuddling of their minds by the lack of oxygen. Hence, the early years of the development of the mine may not easily be progressed.
The deposit is complex but has the general characteristics of a porphyry copper. It consists of a core of copper with molybdenum and silver, surrounded by a lead/zinc zone then a lead/silver zone that is being mined to the north-east of Toromocho by various small companies. It has been mined on a small scale in the past and the underground workings have proved to be valuable drill sites. The ore reserves and resources released in the IMC Technical Report were as follows:
Using the recoveries estimated by IMC, the recoverable metal from the reserves would be 5.7 million tonnes of copper, 148,000 tonnes molybdenum and 188 million ounces of silver, giving a life of over 25 years at an average production rate of 210,000 tonnes copper annually, plus another 8 years if the resources prove payable, a total of 35 years.
The mine.
Chinalco estimate that it will cost US$2.16b to bring the mine to production in 2012 and that annual production will be 210,000 tonnes copper.
Operating costs are likely to be relatively high per pound of copper despite a low stripping ratio (the amount of waste that has to be moved to access the ore), again due to the low grade coupled with the adverse working conditions. On the other hand the molybdenum and silver will be very valuable sources of byproduct income which at current prices could cover operating costs.
Metallurgically the concentrate is likely to be relatively complex. It will contain arsenic which could well incur smelter penalties in the early years because of the enargite (Cu3AsS4) in the top of the deposit. The zinc and antimony are unlikely to be a problem. A more serious problem is the presence of variable quantities of talc which come out with the copper/molybdenum concentrate and tend to depress the copper grade of the concentrate. Sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), will suppress the talc in the flotation process but it has the unfortunate side effect of reducing molybdenum recovery. It gives a higher grade copper concentrate but also lower recovery. A high grade copper concentrate is very desirable because smelters generally deduct 1% from the copper content which is a higher percentage of a low grade concentrate than a high one.

There are two piers in the village, both of which are regularly used, mainly for personal rather than business use. 
The village of Crossbost was formed in the 1840s after the clearances of the people from Lemreway and other surrounding villages from the opposite side of Loch Erisort. Many of the families gathered the few possessions they could and came across the loch, most surviving their first winter in their upturned boats.

<doc id="18416476" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18416476" title="Bird vision">
Bird vision

Vision is the most important sense for birds, since good eyesight is essential for safe flight, and this group has a number of adaptations which give visual acuity superior to that of other vertebrate groups; a pigeon has been described as "two eyes with wings". The avian eye resembles that of a reptile, with ciliary muscles that can change the shape of the lens rapidly and to a greater extent than in the mammals. Birds have the largest eyes relative to their size within the animal kingdom, and movement is consequently limited within the eye's bony socket. In addition to the two eyelids usually found in vertebrates, it is protected by a third transparent movable membrane. The eye's internal anatomy is similar to that of other vertebrates, but has a structure, the pecten oculi, unique to birds.
Birds, unlike humans but like fish, amphibians and reptiles, have four types of colour receptors in the eye. These give birds the ability to perceive not only the visible range but also the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, and other adaptations allow for the detection of polarised light or magnetic fields. Birds have proportionally more light receptors in the retina than mammals, and more nerve connections between the photoreceptors and the brain.
Some bird groups have specific modifications to their visual system linked to their way of life. Birds of prey have a very high density of receptors and other adaptations that maximise visual acuity. The placement of their eyes gives them good binocular vision enabling accurate judgement of distances. Nocturnal species have tubular eyes, low numbers of colour detectors, but a high density of rod cells which function well in poor light. Terns, gull and albatrosses are amongst the seabirds which have red or yellow oil drops in the colour receptors to improve distance vision especially in hazy conditions.
Extraocular anatomy.
The eye of a bird most closely resembles that of the reptiles. Unlike the mammalian eye, it is not spherical, and the flatter shape enables more of its visual field to be in focus. A circle of bony plates, the sclerotic ring, surrounds the eye and holds it rigid, but an improvement over the reptilian eye, also found in mammals, is that the lens is pushed further forward, increasing the size of the image on the retina.
Most birds cannot move their eyes, although there are exceptions, such as the Great Cormorant. Birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field, useful for detecting predators, while those with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate distances when hunting. The American Woodcock probably has the largest visual field of any bird, 360° in the horizontal plane, and 180° in the vertical plane.
The eyelids of a bird are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third concealed eyelid that sweeps horizontally across the eye like a windscreen wiper. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds when they are under water. When sleeping, the lower eyelid rises to cover the eye in most birds, with the exception of the horned owls where the upper eyelid is mobile.
The eye is also cleaned by tear secretions from the lachrymal gland and protected by an oily substance from the Harderian glands which coats the cornea and prevents dryness. The eye of a bird is larger compared to the size of the animal than for any other group of animals, although much of it is concealed in its skull. The Ostrich has the largest eye of any land vertebrate, with an axial length of 50 mm (2 in), twice that of the human eye.
Bird eye size is broadly related to body mass. A study of five orders (parrots, pigeons, petrels, raptors and owls) showed that eye mass is proportional to body mass, but as expected from their habits and visual ecology, raptors and owls have relatively large eyes for their body mass.
Behavioural studies show that many avian species focus on distant objects preferentially with their lateral and monocular ﬁeld of vision, and birds will orientate themselves sideways to maximise visual resolution. For a pigeon, resolution is twice as good with sideways monocular vision than forward binocular vision, whereas for humans the converse is true.
The performance of the eye in low light levels depends on the distance between the lens and the retina, and small birds are effectively forced to be diurnal because their eyes are not large enough to give adequate night vision. Although many species migrate at night, they often collide with even brightly lit objects like lighthouses or oil platforms. Birds of prey are diurnal because, although their eyes are large, they are optimised to give maximum spatial resolution rather than light gathering, so they also do not function well in poor light. Many birds have an asymmetry in the eye's structure which enables them to keep the horizon and a significant part of the ground in focus simultaneously. The cost of this adaptation is that they have myopia in the lower part of their field of view.
Birds with relatively large eyes compared to their body mass, such as Common Redstarts and European Robins sing earlier at dawn than birds of the same size and smaller body mass. However, if birds have the same eye size but different body masses, the larger species sings later than the smaller. This may be because the smaller bird has to start the day earlier because of weight loss overnight.
Nocturnal birds have eyes optimised for visual sensitivity, with large corneas relative to the eye’s length, whereas diurnal birds have longer eyes relative to the corneal diameter to give greater visual acuity. Information about the activities of extinct species can be deduced from measurements of the sclerotic ring and orbit depth. For the latter measurement to be made, the fossil must have retained its three-dimensional shape, so activity pattern cannot be determined with confidence from flattened specimens like "Archaeopteryx", which has a complete sclerotic ring but no orbit depth measurement.
Anatomy of the eye.
The main structures of the bird eye are similar to those of other vertebrates. The outer layer of the eye consists of the transparent cornea at the front, and two layers of sclera — a tough white collagen fibre layer which surrounds the rest of the eye and supports and protects the eye as a whole. The eye is divided internally by the lens into two main segments: the anterior segment and the posterior segment. The anterior chamber is filled with a watery fluid called the aqueous humour, and the posterior chamber contains the vitreous humour, a clear jelly-like substance.
The lens is a transparent convex or 'lens' shaped body with a harder outer layer and a softer inner layer. It focuses the light on the retina. The shape of the lens can be altered by ciliary muscles which are directly attached to lens capsule by means of the zonular fibres. In addition to these muscles, some birds also have a second set, Crampton’s muscles, that can change the shape of the cornea, thus giving birds a greater range of accommodation than is possible for mammals. This accommodation can be rapid in some diving water birds such as in the mergansers. The iris is a coloured muscularly operated diaphragm in front of the lens which controls the amount of light entering the eye. At the centre of the iris is the pupil, the variable circular area through which the light passes into the eye.
The retina is a relatively smooth curved multi-layered structure containing the photosensitive rod and cone cells with the associated neurons and blood vessels. The density of the photoreceptors is critical in determining the maximum attainable visual acuity. Humans have about 200,000 receptors per mm2, but the House Sparrow has 400,000 and the Common Buzzard 1,000,000. The photoreceptors are not all individually connected to the optic nerve, and the ratio of nerve ganglia to receptors is important in determining resolution. This is very high for birds; the White Wagtail has 100,000 ganglion cells to 120,000 photoreceptors.
Rods are more sensitive to light, but give no colour information, whereas the less sensitive cones enable colour vision. In diurnal birds, 80% of the receptors may be cones (90% in some swifts) whereas nocturnal owls have almost all rods. As with other vertebrates except placental mammals, some of the cones may be double structures. These can amount to 50% of all cones in some species.
Towards the centre of the retina is the fovea which has a greater density of receptors and is the area of greatest forward visual acuity, i.e. sharpest, clearest detection of objects. In 54% of birds, including birds of prey, kingfishers, hummingbirds and swallows, there is second fovea for enhanced sideways viewing. The optic nerve is a bundle of nerve fibres which carry messages from the eye to the relevant parts of the brain and vice-versa. Like mammals, birds have a small blind spot without photoreceptors at the optic disc, under which the optic nerve and blood vessels join the eye.
The pecten is a poorly understood body consisting of folded tissue which projects from the retina. It is well supplied with blood vessels and appears to keep the retina supplied with nutrients, and may also shade the retina from dazzling light or aid in detecting moving objects.
The choroid is a layer situated behind the retina which contains many small arteries and veins. These provide arterial blood to the retina and drain venous blood. The choroid contains melanin, a pigment which gives the inner eye its dark colour, helping to prevent disruptive reflections.
Light perception.
There are two sorts of light receptors in a bird’s eye, rods and cones. Rods, which contain the visual pigment rhodopsin are better for night vision because they are sensitive to small quantities of light. Cones detect specific colours (or wavelengths) of light, so they are more important to colour-orientated animals such as birds. Most birds are tetrachromatic, possessing four types of cone cells each with a distinctive maximal absorption peak. In some birds, the maximal absorption peak of the cone cell responsible for the shortest wavelength extends to the ultraviolet (UV) range, making them UV-sensitive. Pigeons have an additional pigment and are therefore pentachromatic.
The four spectrally distinct cone pigments are derived from the protein opsin, linked to a small molecule called retinal, which is closely related to vitamin A. When the pigment absorbs light the retinal changes shape and alters the membrane potential of the cone cell affecting neurones in the ganglia layer of the retina. Each neurone in the ganglion layer may processes information from a number of photoreceptor cells, and may in turn trigger a nerve impulse to relay information along the optic nerve for further processing in specialised visual centres in the brain. The more intense a light, the more photons are absorbed by the visual pigments, the greater the excitation of each cone, and the brighter the light appears.
By far the most abundant cone pigment in every bird species examined is the long-wavelength form of iodopsin, which absorbs at wavelengths near 570 nm. This is roughly the spectral region occupied by the red- and green-sensitive pigments in the primate retina, and this visual pigment dominates the colour sensitivity of birds. In penguins, this pigment appears to have shifted its absorption peak to 543 nm, presumably an adaptation to a blue aquatic environment.
The information conveyed by a single cone is limited: by itself, the cell cannot tell the brain which wavelength of light caused its excitation. A visual pigment may absorb two wavelengths equally, but even though their photons are of different energies, the cone cannot tell them apart, because they both cause the retinal to change shape and thus trigger the same impulse. For the brain to see colour, it must compare the responses of two or more classes of cones containing different visual pigments, so the four pigments in birds give increased discrimination.
Each cone of a bird or reptile contains a coloured oil droplet; these no longer exist in mammals. The droplets, which contain high concentrations of carotenoids, are placed so that light passes through before reaching the visual pigment. They act as ﬁlters, removing some wavelengths and narrowing the absorption spectra of the pigments. This reduces the response overlap between pigments and increases the number of colours that a bird can discern. Six types of cone oil droplets have been identified; five of these have carotenoid mixtures that absorb at different wavelengths and intensities, and the sixth type has no pigments. The cone pigments with the lowest maximal absorption peak, including those that are UV-sensitive, possess the 'clear' or 'transparent' type of oil droplets with little spectral tuning effect.
The colours and distributions of retinal oil droplets vary considerably among species, and is more dependent on the ecological niche utilised (hunter, fisher, herbivore) than genetic relationships. As examples, diurnal hunters like the Barn Swallow and birds of prey have few coloured droplets, whereas the surface fishing Common Tern has a large number of red and yellow droplets in the dorsal retina. The evidence suggests that oil droplets respond to natural selection faster than the cone's visual pigments. Even within the range of wavelengths that are visible to humans, passerine birds can detect colour differences that humans do not register. This finer discrimination, together with the ability to see ultraviolet light, means that many species show sexual dichromatism that is visible to birds but not humans.
Migratory songbirds use the Earth’s magnetic field, stars, the Sun, and polarised light patterns to determine their migratory direction. An American study showed that migratory Savannah Sparrows used polarised light from an area of sky near the horizon to recalibrate their magnetic navigation system at both sunrise and sunset. This suggested that skylight polarisation patterns are the primary calibration reference for all migratory songbirds. However, it appears that birds may be responding to secondary indicators of the angle of polarisation, and may not be actually capable of directly detecting polarisation direction in the absence of these cues.
Ultraviolet.
Some birds can perceive ultraviolet light, which is involved in courtship. Many birds show plumage patterns in ultraviolet that are invisible to the human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers. Male Blue Tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers. Male Blue Grosbeaks with the brightest and most UV-shifted blue in their plumage are larger, hold the most extensive territories with abundant prey, and feed their offspring more frequently than other males do.
The bill’s appearance is important in the interactions of the Blackbird. Although the UV component seems unimportant in interactions between territory-holding males, where the degree of orange is the main factor, the female responds more strongly to males with bills with good UV-reflectiveness.
A UV receptor may give an animal an advantage in foraging for food. The waxy surfaces of many fruits and berries reﬂect UV light that might advertise their presence. Common Kestrels are able to locate the trails of voles visually. These small rodents lay scent trails of urine and faeces that reﬂect UV light, making them visible to the kestrels, particularly in the spring before the scent marks are covered by vegetation.
Perception.
Movement.
Birds can resolve rapid movements better than humans, for whom flickering at a rate greater than 50 Hz appears as continuous movement. Humans cannot therefore distinguish individual ﬂashes of a ﬂuorescent light bulb oscillating at 60 Hz, but Budgerigars and chickens have flicker thresholds of more than 100 Hz. A Cooper's Hawk can pursue agile prey through woodland and avoid branches and other objects at high speed; to humans such a chase would appear as a blur.
Birds can also detect slow moving objects. The movement of the sun and the constellations across the sky is imperceptible to humans, but detected by birds. The ability to detect these movements allows migrating birds to properly orient themselves.
To obtain steady images while flying or when perched on a swaying branch, birds hold the head as steady as possible with compensating reflexes. Maintaining a steady image is especially relevant for birds of prey.
Edges and shapes.
When an object is partially blocked by another, humans unconsciously tend to make up for it and complete the shapes (See Amodal perception). It has however been demonstrated that pigeons do not complete occluded shapes. A study based on altering the grey level of a perch that was coloured differently from the background showed that budgerigars do not detect edges based on colours.
Magnetic fields.
The perception of magnetic fields by migratory birds has been suggested to be light dependent. Birds move their head to detect the orientation of the magnetic field, and studies on the neural pathways have suggested that birds may be able to "see" the magnetic fields. The right eye of a migratory bird contains photoreceptive proteins called cryptochromes. Light excites these molecules to produce unpaired electrons that interact with the Earth's magnetic field, thus providing directional information.
Variations across bird groups.
Diurnal birds of prey.
The visual ability of birds of prey is legendary, and the keenness of their eyesight is due to a variety of factors. Raptors have large eyes for their size, 1.4 times greater than the average for birds of the same weight, and the eye is tube-shaped to produce a larger retinal image. The retina has a large number of receptors per square millimeter, which determines the degree of visual acuity. The more receptors an animal has, the higher its ability to distinguish individual objects at a distance, especially when, as in raptors, each receptor is typically attached to a single ganglion. Many raptors have foveas with far more rods and cones than the human fovea (65,000/mm2 in American Kestrel, 38,000 in humans) and this provides these birds with spectacular long distance vision. The fovea itself can also be lens-shaped, increasing the effective density of receptors further. This combination of factors gives "Buteo" buzzards distance vision 6 to 8 times better than humans.
The forward-facing eyes of a bird of prey give binocular vision, which is assisted by a double fovea. The raptor's adaptations for optimum visual resolution (an American Kestrel can see a 2–mm insect from the top of an 18–m tree) has a disadvantage in that its vision is poor in low light level, and it must roost at night. Raptors may have to pursue mobile prey in the lower part of their visual field, and therefore do not have the lower field myopia adaptation demonstrated by many other birds. Scavenging birds like vultures do not need such sharp vision, so a condor has only a single fovea with about 35,000 receptors mm2
Raptors lack coloured oil drops in the cones, and probably have similar colour perception to humans, and lack the ability to detect polarised light. The generally brown, grey and white plumage of this group, and the absence of colour displays in courtship suggests that colour is relatively unimportant to these birds.
In most raptors a prominent eye ridge and its feathers extends above and in front of the eye. This "eyebrow" gives birds of prey their distinctive stare. The ridge physically protects the eye from wind, dust, and debris and shields it from excessive glare. The Osprey lacks this ridge, although the arrangement of the feathers above its eyes serves a similar function; it also possesses dark feathers in front of the eye which probably serve to reduce the glare from the water surface when the bird is hunting for its staple diet of fish.
Nocturnal birds.
Owls have very large eyes for their size, 2.2 times greater than the average for birds of the same weight, and positioned at the front of the head. The eyes have a field overlap of 50–70%, giving better binocular vision than for diurnal birds of prey (overlap 30–50%). The Tawny Owl's retina has about 56,000 light-sensitive rods per square millimetre (36 million per square inch); although earlier claims that it could see in the infrared part of the spectrum have been dismissed.
Adaptations to night vision include the large size of the eye, its tubular shape, large numbers of closely packed retinal rods, and an absence of cones, since cone cells are not sensitive enough for a low-photon nighttime environment. There are few coloured oil drops, which would reduce the light intensity, but the retina contains a reflective layer, the tapetum lucidum. This increases the amount of light each photosensitive cell receives, allowing the bird to see better in low light conditions. Owls normally have only one fovea, and that is poorly developed except in diurnal hunters like the Short-eared Owl.
Besides owls, bat hawks, frogmouths and nightjars also display good night vision. Some bird species nest deep in cave systems which are too dark for vision, and find their way to the nest with a simple form of echolocation. The Oilbird is the only nocturnal bird to echolocate, but several "Aerodramus" swiftlets also utilise this technique, with one species, Atiu Swiftlet, also using echolocation outside its caves.
Water birds.
Seabirds such as terns and gulls that feed at the surface or plunge for food have red oil droplets in the cones of their retinas. This improves contrast and sharpens distance vision, especially in hazy conditions. Birds that have to look through an air/water interface have more deeply coloured carotenoid pigments in the oil drops than other species.
This helps them to locate shoals of fish, although it is uncertain whether they are sighting the phytoplankton on which the fish feed, or other feeding birds.
Birds that fish by stealth from above the water have to correct for refraction particularly when the fish are observed at an angle. Reef Herons and Little Egrets appear to be able to make the corrections needed when capturing fish and are more successful in catching fish when strikes are made at an acute angle and this higher success may be due to the inability of the fish to detect their predators. Other studies indicate that egrets work within a preferred angle of strike and that the probability of misses increase when the angle becomes too far from the vertical leading to an increased difference between the apparent and real depth of prey.
Birds that pursue fish under water like auks and divers have far fewer red oil droplets, but they have special flexible lenses and use the nictitating membrane as an additional lens. This allows greater optical accommodation for good vision in air and water. Cormorants have a greater range of visual accommodation, at 50 dioptres, than any other bird, but the kingfishers are considered to have the best all-round (air and water) vision.
Tubenosed seabirds, which come ashore only to breed and spend most of their life wandering close to the surface of the oceans, have a long narrow area of visual sensitivity on the retina This region, the "area giganto cellularis", has been found in the Manx Shearwater, Kerguelen Petrel, Great Shearwater, Broad-billed Prion and Common Diving-petrel. It is characterised by the presence of ganglion cells which are regularly arrayed and larger than those found in the rest of the retina, and morphologically appear similar to the cells of the retina in cats. The location and cellular morphology of this novel area suggests a function in the detection of items in a small binocular ﬁeld projecting below and around the bill. It is not concerned primarily with high spatial resolution, but may assist in the detection of prey near the sea surface as a bird flies low over it.
The Manx Shearwater, like many other seabirds, visits its breeding colonies at night to reduce the chances of attack by aerial predators. Two aspects of its optical structure suggest that the eye of this species is adapted to vision at night. In the shearwater's eyes the lens does most of the bending of light necessary to produce a focused image on the retina. The cornea, the outer covering of the eye, is relative flat and so of low refractive power. In a diurnal bird like the pigeon, the reverse is true; the cornea is highly curved and is the principal refractive component. The ration of refraction by the lens to that by the cornea is 1.6 for the shearwater and 0.4 for the pigeon; the figure for the shearwater is consistent with that for a range of different nocturnal bird and mammal.
The shorter focal length of shearwater eyes give them a smaller, but brighter, image than is the case for pigeons, so the latter has sharper daytime vision. Although the Manx Shearwater has adaptations for night vision, the effect is small, and it is likely that these birds also use smell and hearing to locate their nests.
It used to be thought that penguins were short-sighted on land. Although the cornea is flat and adapted to swimming underwater, the lens is very strong and can compensate for the reduced corneal focusing when out of water. Almost the opposite solution is used by the Hooded Merganser which can bulge part of the lens through the iris when submerged.

Adventure City

Adventure City is a theme park located in Anaheim, California near the city of Stanton. The park's slogan is "The Little Theme Park that's BIG on Family Fun". Occupying an area of over , Adventure City is one of the smallest theme parks in California, and receives an average attendance of between 200,000 and 400,000 per year. The Coca-Cola Company is the park's only major sponsor.
History.
The park opened in 1994 at a cost of $4 Million, as an expansion of Hobby City, a nearby collection of novelty shops and museums. The park was initially marketed to families with children, as an affordable alternative to other Southern California area theme parks such as Disneyland, also in Anaheim, and Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park. Hobby City's original miniature railroad attraction, which opened in 1938 (25 years before the park opened), was extended and incorporated into the new park. A classic 1946 Carousel was also part of the parks opening day attractions roster.
In 1999, the park purchased and refurbished a classic 1950s-era Wild Mouse style rollercoaster from an Amusement company in Brisbane, Australia. The park named its new roller coaster "Tree Top Racers", and expanded its boundaries westward into an adjacent former parking area to incorporate its new attraction. The ride was the park's first new attraction since opening, adding to its collection of classic rides. In 2012, "Tree Top Racers" was permanently closed. Plans to replace the ride with a new family rollercoaster attraction are currently underway. 
In 2005, the park opened "Drop Zone", its second new attraction since opening day.
In 2014, "Rewind Racers", a $2 million family shuttle coaster will open on the former site of "Tree Top Racers", in time for the park's 20th anniversary. The ride will be a first of its' kind attraction in North America, built by Gerstlauer Amusement Rides GMBH, a German ride manufacturer, and will be the largest single investment in the park's history.

Reedness Junction railway station

Reedness Junction railway station was a railway junction near Reedness, East Riding of Yorkshire, England on the Axholme Joint Railway. Immediately to the west of the station, the Fockerby Branch, which continued eastwards, turned off from the main line to Epworth, which curved to the south.
History.
The Goole and Marshland Light Railway was one of the early lines to be authorised under the Light Railway Act of 1896, which was designed to ease the problems facing the building of rural railways. Four railways were authorised by the Light Railway Order of 16 August 1898, one from the to main line at Marshland Junction to Reedness, another from Reedness to Adlingfleet, a branch to Swinefleet and another to Luddington. The first was built as authorised, but the remainder were replaced by a line which followed the course of the second to , and then ran to via .
Another Light Railway Order was obtained on 11 March 1899, for a line from via and to join the Goole and Marshland Railway at Reedness Junction. Both railways negotiated with the North Eastern Railway in January 1900, and the larger company agreed to take over the lines. The station was opened for goods traffic on 8 January 1900. A Directors' train, consisting of a contractor's engine and two open trucks, ran on 26 June 1900, and included a trial run to Crowle over the Isle of Axholme Light Railway line. Another inspection, on behalf of the North Eastern Railway before purchasing the line, passed through the station and along the Fockerby Branch to Luddington, as the final section to Garthorpe, later renamed as Fockerby station, had not been completed. Eastoft station was noted to be complete, and the inspector expected Reedness Junction, Luddington and Garthorpe to be finished to a similar standard.
The inspector recommended that a water tank should be installed at Reedness, with a petroleum gas-engine capable of filling it in two hours, and two water columns, one to fill locomotives on the main line and another in the sidings. He also noted that there was no signalling, but he expected the company to install such equipment as the Board of Trade required.
When the takeover of both lines occurred at the beginning of 1903, the North Eastern Railway was acting jointly with the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, and the line became the Axholme Joint Railway, although its official title from 17 February 1904 was the Isle of Axholme Joint Railway (NE and L&Y Joint). The Goole and Marshland line and the Isle of Axholme Light Railway line from Reedness to Crowle were opened for passengers and goods traffic on 10 August 1903, with the line southwards to Haxey Junction following in January 1905, once it was completed.
As built, the junction was to the west of the station, which had two platforms, one on the main line and another on the Fockerby Branch. There were sidings to the north of the single lines, accessible from the Fockerby Branch, and a loop just beyond the sidings. The station master's house was situated between the two lines, and there were wooden buildings used as a signal cabin and a ticket office. A water tank supported by a tall brick tower was located to the north of the sidings. It fed three water columns, and was supplied by a pumping station at Shipcote Drain, from the station. The connecting pipe was in diameter and was not always adequate. A second tank was erected near the pumping station, but after consideration, the cost of replacing the pipe with a one was not thought to be justified. 
The railway company held a heated debate in 1906, when Colonel Thompson requested permission for a group of about 16 female potato pickers to be allowed to walk from the station through Reedness Goods Yard, and then cross over Swinefleet Warping Drain by walking along the main line of the railway. His request was to reduce the distance that the ladies had to walk to work each day, and was granted, although the Colonel had to indemnify the railway against claims if any of them were involved in an accident while following this route.
There is some doubt as to the name of the station, as the Railway Clearing House map and some tickets showed it as Reedness, while NER promotional materials and other tickets showed it as Reedness Jct. There is no evidence for a station nameboard, and consequently no photographic evidence either. Traffic was sparse, since the village of Swinefleet was away, and Reedness was .
The station closed on 15 July 1933 when passenger services were removed from the line. The line through the station remained open for goods traffic until 1965. 
Despite its name, the junction and station were in the adjacent parish of Swinefleet, although both the Fockerby Branch and the main line to Epworth passed through the parish of Reedness to the east of the station.

Peperomia pellucida

Peperomia pellucida(a.k.a. pepper elder, shining bush plant) is an annual, shallow-rooted herb, usually growing to a height of about 15 to 45 cm. it is characterized by succulent stems, shiny, heart-shaped, fleshy leaves and tiny, dot-like seeds attached to several fruiting spikes. It has a mustard-like odor when crushed. The family Piperaceae comprises about a dozen genera and around 3000 species. The genus "Peperomia" represents nearly half of the Piperaceae with the genus "Piper" making the bulk of the rest.
Habitat.
Flowering year-round, the plant is found in various shaded, damp habitats all over Asia and the Americas. It grows in clumps, thriving in loose, humid soils and a tropical to subtropical climate.
Uses.
"Peperomia pellucida" has been used as a food item as well as a medicinal herb. Although mostly grown for its ornamental foliage, the entire plant is edible, both cooked and raw.
Pharmacology.
The analgesic properties of the plant seem to be related to its effect on prostaglandin synthesis. It may have potential as a broad spectrum antibiotic, as demonstrated in tests against "Staphylococcus aureus", "Bacillus subtilis", "Pseudomonas aeruginosa", and "Escherichia coli". Chloroform extracts from dried leaves of "P. pellucida" have been shown to exhibit antifungal activity against "Trichophyton mentagrophytes" "in vitro".
Although the plant can cause asthma-like symptoms in patients with known hypersensitivity reactions to the species, no clinical data have yet been reported on human toxicity.
Traditional medicine.
Ethnomedicinal uses for the plant vary. "P. pellucida" has been used for treating abdominal pain, abscesses, acne, boils, colic, fatigue, gout, headache, renal disorders, and rheumatic joint pain. In Bolivia, Alteños Indians use the whole plant to stop hemorrhages. The roots are used to treat fevers and the aerial parts are used as dressing for wounds. In northeastern Brazil, the plant has been used to lower cholesterol. In Guyana and the Amazon region, it is a popular cough suppressant, emollient, and diuretic. It is also used to treat proteinuria. In the Philippines, a decoction of the plant is used to decrease uric acid levels and to treat renal problems. It is also used topically for skin disorders such as acne and boils.
Common names.
Throughout the Americas, it is known as "pepper elder, silverbush, rat-ear, man-to-man, clearweed" (North America); "konsaka wiwiri" (Suriname); "coraçãozinho" or "little heart" (Brazil); "lingua de sapo, herva-de-vidro, herva-de-jaboti or herva-de-jabuti" (South America). In Oceania, it is called "rtertiil" (Belauan); "podpod-lahe" or "potpopot" (Chamorro). In the different dialects of the Philippines, it is called "pansit-pansitan" or "ulasimang-bato" (Tagalog), "olasiman ihalas" (Bisaya), "sinaw-sinaw" or "tangon-tangon" (Bikol), "lin-linnaaw" (Ilocano) and "clavo-clavo" (Chavacano). In other parts of Asia, it is known as "càng cua" (Vietnam); "pak krasang" ผักกระสัง (Thailand); "krasang teap" ក្រសាំងទាប (Cambodia); "suna kosho" (Japan); "rangu-rangu, ketumpangan" or "tumpang angin" (Bahasa/Malay); "rinrin" (Nigeria), "shining bush" (Trinidad and Tobago)

Joel Chimelis

Joel Chimelis (born July 27, 1967) is a minor league baseball hitting coach and a former professional baseball infielder. Although he never played in Major League Baseball, he briefly was called up to the major league roster of the San Francisco Giants in June 1995. He also played one season in the CPBL in 1997, and one season in the Korea Baseball Organization in 1998. In all, Chimelis played in baseball's minor leagues for 13 years.
Early life and education.
A native of Puerto Rico, Chimelis grew up in Brooklyn, New York. He graduated from Eastern District High School in Brooklyn. He attended Howard College in Big Spring, Texas and also attended the University of Texas, where he played baseball on the 1988 squad and was named to the 1988 NCAA Central Region team.
Baseball career.
In early June 1988, Chimelis was drafted as a shortstop by the Oakland Athletics in the 11th round of the major league draft and sent to their Southern Oregon A's rookie-league minor league team in Medford, Oregon for the remainder of the 1988 season. Chimelis then was promoted to play for the Modesto Athletics Single-A minor league team in and .
Chimelis then played for the minor league Shreveport Captains, a Double-A minor league team in the San Francisco Giants organization, in 1992, 1993, and 1994, and also played for the Giants' Triple-A minor league team, the Phoenix Firebirds, in 1992 and 1993.
Replacement player controversy.
While major league players were on strike during spring training in 1995, Chimelis agreed to take the field as part of the San Francisco Giants' replacement team. Once the strike ended, Chimelis headed to the Giants' Triple-A Phoenix minor league club.
On June 4, 1995, the Giants called up Chimelis to their major league roster to replace the injured infielder Matt Williams, who had broken a bone in his foot. Although several other major league teams had called up former replacement players, the Giants hadn't done so yet, and its players grumbled about the idea of welcoming a strikebreaker on the team. As a result, Chimelis, who had been hitting .294 at Phoenix, immediately was treated as an outcast by Giants players, who held a players-only meeting at which they excluded Chimelis. "I never associated with a replacement player, and I wasn't about to now," Giants first baseman Mark Carreon told the "San Francisco Chronicle" in an article that appeared on June 6, 1995. "A lot of us for eight months made sacrifices. I'm sure he's a great guy (Chimelis), but we stood for something."
After a threat of player revolt, the Giants sent Chimelis back down to the minor leagues just two days later, on June 6, 1995, without Chimelis ever having appeared in a major league game. "They told me they would get me a flight out the next morning," Chimelis told the "Daily Press (Virginia)" in an article that was published on August 13, 1996. "But I said, 'The hell with that. I'll go right now.' Why stay when you aren't happy and you aren't wanted? It's hard not to be angry, but there are two ways you can react to that anger. You can cry about it and dig yourself a hole, or you can build from it. All I did was try to support my family. Now I'm just trying to play baseball and do my job." Chimelis was never called back up to the major leagues again, and finished his season in Phoenix. He was released by the Giants during the first week of September in 1995.
Remainder of his minor league career.
In 1996, Chimelis started the season with the Guerreros de Oaxaca in the Mexican League. On July 26, 1996, he was signed by the Norfolk Tides, the Triple-A minor league club for the New York Mets, and spent the balance of the season there. In 1997, Chimelis played for the Brother Eleplants of CPBL in Taiwan. In 1998, Chimelis played for the Hanwha Eagles in South Korea.
Chimelis played in the Mexican League in 2000, for what the Tecolotes de los Dos Laredos (now the Tecolotes de Nuevo Laredo. In 2001, Chimelis played in the Mexican League and for the Quebec Capitales in the independent Northern League. He played a stint in Puerto Rico during the winter of 2002, then returned to the Tecolotes later that year, but retired in 2003.
Coaching career.
In 2004 and 2005, Chimelis was the hitting coach for the Single-A Savannah Sand Gnats minor league team in the Washington Nationals organization.
In January 2006, the Houston Astros announced that Chimelis would become the hitting coach for the Tri-City ValleyCats, who play a short season in the New York-Penn League. Chimelis continued in that role through the 2010 season.
In 2011, Chimelis served as the hitting coach for the Astros' Class A Lexington Legends team. In 2012, Chimelis is serving as the hitting coach for the Astros' Class AA Corpus Christi Hooks team.

Halal tourism

Halal tourism is a subcategory of religious tourism which is geared towards Muslim families who abide by Sharia rules. The hotels in such destinations do not serve alcohol and have separate swimming pools and spa facilities for men and women. Malaysia, Turkey and many more countries are trying to attract Muslim tourists from all over the world offering facilities in accordance with the religious beliefs of Muslim tourists.
The Halal tourism industry also provides flights where no alcohol or pork products are served, prayer timings are announced, and religious programs are broadcast as part of entertainment offered on board. 
A Euromonitor International report released at World Travel Market in 2007 in London says that there is potential for a boom in halal tourism in the Middle East. The report mentions a market for a halal startup airline, which could provide halal food, prayer calls, Qur'an in seat pockets and provide separate sections for male and female travelers. 
Many international hotels do serve halal food that is slaughtered in accordance with the teachings of Islamic Sharia and is free of any substances forbidden by Islam such as pork and alcohol. Some hotels have employed people of Arab/Muslim Countries origin to provide translation services and other assistance that may be needed by tourists from Muslim countries.
The Economist's article on Halal Business published on May 25, 2013: "It is not just manufactured halal products. Services such as halal holidays are booming, too. Crescent Tours, a London-based online travel specialist, books clients into hotels in Turkey that have separate swimming pools for men and women, no-alcohol policies and halal restaurants, and rents out private holiday villas with high walls."

Too Many Walls

"Too Many Walls" is a song by British singer-songwriter Cathy Dennis. 
Released as a single from her album "Move to This" in September 1991, "Too Many Walls" became Dennis' fourth Top 10 hit on the U.S. pop chart, where it peaked at #8. Her other American Top 10 singles were: "C'mon and Get My Love" (officially credited to 'D Mob introducing Cathy Dennis'), #10 in 1990; "Just Another Dream", #9, also from 1990; and "Touch Me (All Night Long)", #2 from earlier in 1991. "Too Many Walls" also spent two weeks atop the U.S. adult contemporary chart. In the UK, the song was released in October and reached #17 on the British pop chart. In Australia, the song reached #57 on the Australian pop chart. 
"Too Many Walls" is a midtempo pop ballad and was co-written by Dennis and Anne Dudley, member of the avant-garde synthpop musical group The Art of Noise. The song was originally a composition of Dudley's with strings but no lyrics, until Dennis adapted the song and added words before it appeared on her debut album. The song was then remixed into a more radio-friendly version before being released as a single. 
In an interview with "Rolling Stone" magazine, Dennis stated that she thinks the ballad is "the best song on the album, especially in terms of lyrics. The other songs are fun, but they can be quite vacant." She said the song is "about when you want to be together with someone, but other people's opinions and prejudices get in the way."
"Too Many Walls" was Dennis' final Top 10 hit in the U.S. as a featured singer; she has, however, written other hit songs, notably Kylie Minogue's worldwide hit "Can't Get You Out of My Head".
The video was filmed at the newly opened Stansted airport. It was directed by Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel.
Ashley Tisdale covered the song for her promotional deal with deodorant mark Degree.

An all-freight spur line operated by the privately held Hekinan Electric Railway connected Anjō to Hekinan in 1939 and began passenger operations from March 1951, but was discontinued in 1961. In October 1980, the JNR discontinued all freight services to Anjō Station. With the privatization and dissolution of the JNR on 1 April 1987, the station came under the control of the Central Japan Railway Company. At that time, an additional side platform was constructed.

Xue Chen (; born 18 February 1989 in Fuzhou, Fujian) is a Chinese female beach volleyball player, measuring in height. Her hometown is Fuzhou, but she trains in Sanya, Hainan. She has also trained in California under coach Dane Selznick.
Career.
Xue began playing basketball as a child, but disliked the physical contact of that sport. She then played indoor volleyball from the age of 10 to 13 before settling into beach volleyball. She began training for her sports career in 2000 at the Fuzhou Sports Training School. In 2002, she attended the Athletic Sports College of Fuzhou and became a member of the Chinese national beach volleyball team. Xue then made her Swatch-FIVB World Tour debut in 2005, playing in two events with You Wenhui and winning the FIVB Top Rookie award for 2006.
Early 2006 Xue became the youngest player to ever win a major event, when on 28 May 2006 the 17-year-old won the $400,000 China Shanghai Jinshan Open.
Later in 2006, Xue and Zhang Xi won the gold medal in the women's team competition at the 2006 Asian Games. The pair also won the bronze medal in women's beach volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics.
The pair had great success in 2010, which included winning the Grand Slam in Moscow, Russia, for the second time. They also achieved an extraordinary gold-medal win on the FIVB World Tour Women's Final in Åland, Finland, by snapping the record gold-medal winning-streak of Brazil's França–Silva duo on 21 August 2010. In 2009 they had won the gold medal in the Asian Beach Volleyball Championships in Haikou, China, and repeated the title in 2010. They then went on to win gold at the Sanya Open in Hainan, the Guangzhou Asian Games, and the Asian Beach Games. The team of Xue and Zhang are ranked 4th overall on the 2010 FIVB Beach Volleyball World Rankings and finished the season ranked first in the FIVB World Rankings. Xue and Zhang represented China in the 2012 London Olympics and ended 4th in the female beach volleyball competition.

Artemia salina

Artemia salina is a species of brine shrimp – aquatic crustaceans that are more closely related to "Triops" and cladocerans than to true shrimp. It is a very old species that does not appear to have changed in .
Description.
Adults have three eyes and 11 pairs of legs and can grow to about in size. Their blood contains the pigment haemoglobin, which is also found in vertebrates. Males differ from females by having the second antennae markedly enlarged, and modified into clasping organs used in mating.
Life cycle.
Males have two reproductive organs. Prior to copulation the male clasps the female with his clasping organ, assuming a dorsal position. The claspers hold the female just anterior to the ovisac. Male and female may swim clasped together for a number of days. In this state, the movements of the swimming appendages of the pair beat in a co-ordinated fashion. The females can produce eggs either as a result of mating or via parthenogenesis. There are two types of eggs: thin-shelled eggs that hatch immediately and thick-shelled eggs, which can remain in a dormant state. These cysts can last for a number of years, and will hatch when they are placed in water. Thick-shelled eggs are produced when the body of water is drying out, raising the salt concentration. If the female dies, the eggs develop further. Eggs hatch into nauplii that are about 0.5 mm in length. They have one single simple eye that only senses the presence and direction of light. Nauplii swim towards the light but adult individuals swim away from it. Later, the two more capable eyes develop but the initial eye also stays, resulting in three-eyed creatures.
Ecology.
In nature, they live in salt lakes. They are almost never found in an open sea, most likely because of the lack of food and relative defenselessness. However, "Artemia" have been observed in Elkhorn Slough, California, which is connected to the sea. Unlike most aquatic species, "Artemia" swims upside down.
"Artemia" can live in water having much more or much less salt content than normal seawater. They tolerate salt amounts as high as 50%, which is nearly a saturated solution, and can live for several days in solutions very different from the sea water, such as potassium permanganate or silver nitrate, while iodine—a frequent addition to edible salt—is harmful to them. The animal's colour depends on the salt concentration, with high concentrations giving them a slightly red appearance. In fresh water, "Artemia salina" dies after about an hour. It feeds mainly on green algae.
Uses.
The resilience of these creatures make them ideal test samples in experiments. "Artemia" is one of the standard organisms for testing the toxicity of chemicals. In addition, the eggs survive for years. Hence it is possible to buy eggs and also ""Artemia" growing kits" for children, containing eggs, salt, food and most necessary tools. These have been most popularly marketed under the name "Sea-Monkeys". Children have the possibility to observe the life cycle of this interesting organism. Shops catering for Aquarists also sell frozen "Artemia" as fish food. "Artemia" occurs in vast numbers in the Great Salt Lake where it is commercially important. However, nowadays it is believed that this lake is inhabited by a second brine shrimp species, "Artemia franciscana".
Taxonomy.
"Artemia salina" was first described (as "Cancer salinus") by Carl Linnaeus in his "" in 1758. This was based on a report by a German called Schlosser, who had found "Artemia" at Lymington, England. That population is now extinct, although specimens collected there are retained in zoological museums.

Little Black Sambo (film)

Little Black Sambo was a 1935 Cinecolor, sound animated film, based on the controversial children's book of the same name. This film was created at the Iwerks Studio, and released by Celebrity. The film marked the first appearance of an unnamed dog, who appeared in three of Iwerks' films.
Plot.
Sambo's mother is bathing him, and she dries and clothes him as their dog watches. After that, his mother warns, in dialect, "Now, go along and play, honey child. But watch out for that bad, old tiger." and the controversial line, "That old tiger sure do like dark meat." As Sambo goes out to play, the dog sneaks out the window with a fiendish idea. He uses undried brown paint on a fence for stripes and a paint brush for them on his tail. He sees his teeth, and finds a bear trap to resemble sharp teeth. He tests his appearance in a mirror and walks away, although it was an "actual" tiger.
Sambo is whistling, as the dog is hiding in a tree, sneaking on him. The dog follows him, until Sambo runs away. He finally hides on a coconut tree, and throws coconuts at him, until he grabs a monkey's ear, who throws him out to the ground. Then, the dog tells Sambo that he is not a tiger. Then, Sambo plays fetch, and when the dog retrieves, the real tiger appears, and chases them home. They block the door, and the tiger uses a rock to reproduce a banging sound. He creeps in the house, and they use molasses to trap him. Sambo grabs a skillet and burns the tiger, and he is chased away.
Availability.
The film was available for purchase for home viewing between 1942 and 1968 from Castle Films, the company having acquired the rights for it among the many acquired from the defunct Ub Iwerks Studio in 1941. It was listed as #757 in its catalog in 1948 in various formats, including 8mm and 16mm, in color and in black-and-white, condensed to 3:30 minutes or full-length, with sound or silent with minimal dialog on interstitial cards.
It is currently available on video and DVD in several public domain cartoon anthologies, including "Johnny Legend Presents: The Complete Weird Cartoons." The Castle Films color/sound version has been digitized and is available as part of the collection at the Internet Archive, mislabeled there as "Loittle Black Sambo."
In popular culture.
Clips of the cartoon was seen in "Bamboozled", a Spike Lee movie about black stereotypes.
Various parts of the cartoon can be seen in the opening credits of the independent film "Spinning Into Butter", starring Sarah Jessica Parker and Victor Rasuk.

Median algebra

In mathematics, a median algebra is a set with a ternary operation formula_1 satisfying a set of axioms which generalise the notion of median or majority function, as a Boolean function.
The axioms are 
The second and third axioms imply commutativity: it is possible (but not easy) to show that in the presence of the other three, axiom (3) is redundant. The fourth axiom implies associativity.
There are other possible axiom systems: for example the two
also suffice.
In a Boolean algebra, or more generally a distributive lattice, the median function formula_8 satisfies these axioms, so that every Boolean algebra and every distributive lattice forms a median algebra.
Birkhoff and Kiss showed that a median algebra with elements 0 and 1 satisfying < 0,x,1 > = x is a distributive lattice.
Relation to median graphs.
A median graph is an undirected graph in which for every three vertices "x", "y", and "z" there is a unique vertex < x,y,z > that belongs to shortest paths between any two of "x", "y", and "z". If this is the case, then the operation < x,y,z > defines a median algebra having the vertices of the graph as its elements.
Conversely, in any median algebra, one may define an "interval" ["x", "z"] to be the set of elements "y" such that < x,y,z > = "y". One may define a graph from a median algebra by creating a vertex for each algebra element and an edge for each pair ("x", "z") such that the interval ["x", "z"] contains no other elements. If the algebra has the property that every interval is finite, then this graph is a median graph, and it accurately represents the algebra in that the median operation defined by shortest paths on the graph coincides with the algebra's original median operation.

Miroslav Kraljević

Miroslav Kraljević (1885–1913) was a Croatian painter, printmaker and sculptor, active in the early part of the 20th century. He is one of the founders of modern art in Croatia.
Kraljević studied painting in Vienna and Munich at the prestigious Academy of Arts along with Oskar Herman, Vladimir Becić and Josip Račić. This group of Croatian artists were later called the Munich Circle, known for their influence on modern art in Croatia. After Munich, Kraljević spent time in the family home at Požega, and then in Paris where he produced his best work. He died in Zagreb in April 1913, aged 27, from tuberculosis.
Miroslav Kraljević painted in many different styles, including Impressionism, Pointillism and Expressionism. He also became known for his drawings of grotesque or erotic characters, in a similar way to Aubrey Beardsley, and for his sculptures. Working in a variety of media, he used almost every painting and drawing technique in his portraits, figures, still lifes, animals and landscapes. His graphics used etching and woodcut, and sculptures were created in clay, plaster and bronze.
Biography.
Miroslav Kraljević was born on 14 December 1885 in Gospić, in the area of Lika. His early childhood up to 7th grade high school (1888 to 1902) was spent in Zagreb, though he completed high school in Gospić (1902–1904). He loved poetry and music, and he was often seen drawing. In 1904, the young Kraljević left for Vienna. There, in addition to studying law, he took painting lessons privately with George Fischhof. After two years he gave up the study of law and devoted himself to painting.
In the autumn of 1906 Kraljević moved to Munich, where he spent two terms at the private school of Moritz Heymann, known for training excellent printermakers. After seven months in Munich, he enrolled in the prestigious Academy of Fine Arts and became a student of Hugo von Habermann. During his time there (1907–1910) he studied with fellow Croatian painters Josip Račić, Oskar Herman and Vladimir Becić. At that time Munich was an important center of the European art scene, particularly for Realism, Post-Impressionism, Symbolism and Jugendstil.
Upon completion of his studies in Munich, Kraljević returned to his family, who had by then moved to Požega, and where he spent 1910 and a good part of 1911. During this time, he painted "Self-portrait with Dog" (Croatian: Autoportret sa psom), and many of his other well-known portraits, landscapes and other works with rustic themes. He also returned to his interest in sculpture, producing works in clay, plaster and bronze.
In 1911, Kraljević received a state grant to study in Paris. He formally enrolled in the Academy La Grande Chaumiére, but instead began to paint intensively at the studios of friends. Here Kraljević's creative talent came to the fore, and despite the advancing effects of tuberculosis, he produced some of his best work, a range of motifs of Parisian life in drawings and oils. After a year, he left Paris and returned home to Požega.
In the autumn of 1912 Kraljević went to Zagreb, where he organized his first solo exhibition, which had a retrospective character. He rented a studio, where he continued to paint until December 1913. Then he went to a sanatorium in Berstovca for treatment. After two months, he left the hospital to return to Zagreb, where he died two days later on 16 April 1913 of tuberculosis. He was only 27 years old. He is buried in the family grave in Požega.
Legacy.
[[File:1912, Miroslav Kraljevic, Bonvivant.jpg|thumb|left|
"Bonvivant", 1912, oil on canvas, Modern Gallery in Zagreb.]]
The "Munich Circle" marks the beginning of Croatian Modernism. The term was coined in the 1950s, referring to the four artists who studied at the Munich Academy of Art in the early 1900s. Miroslav Kraljević, along with fellow Croatian artists Joseph Račić, Vladimir Becić and Oscar Herman established modern art in Croatia, setting a new direction from the previously dominant academic traditions. Their art was autonomous artistic expression, without literary, historical or moralistic framework, which puts them in direct contact with French impressionism, particularly with Manet and Cézanne as role models.
Miroslav Kraljević is one of the founders of Croatian modern painting, and almost from the beginning was an extremely versatile artist.
His art can be hard to categorize, as he explored many different styles and techniques. Kraljević's graphic work displays strong tonal qualities and an excellent sense of light and dark relationships, perfectly suiting a sensitive temperament which could express extreme joy, but soon transform into deepest melancholy.
The most mature pictures of Kraljević's creative period were produced while he was in Požega: Krave na paši (Cows at Pasture), Bik (Bull), and U staji (In the Stables). Broad strokes and sharp contrasts of color show the artist in his natural element, the countryside, rather than the bourgeois parlor atmosphere. Also in Požega, he painted one of his best-known and finest self-portraits: Self-portrait with Dog. There he created and anthological works of Croatian art, such as Portret tete Luike (Portrait of Aunt Luike), Djevojčica s lutkom (Girl with Dolls) and portraits of his mother and father, and the poetic landscape painted with impressionistic atmosphere. His work contains elements of both Impressionism (for example in Park Luxembourg), and Expressionism (Women in the Park). His pipe pictures, also created in Paris, show methods similar to Cézanne.
The Gallery Miroslav Kraljević is an independent and non-profit contemporary art platform and gallery in Zagreb dedicated to promoting cutting edge contemporary Croatian art and building links to the international art scene. It is named after Miroslav Kraljević "whose innovations exercised a decisive influence on Croatian visual art in the beginning of the 20th century".

Key Net Radio

Format.
"Key Net Radio" was hosted by three people: Shinji Orito, a signature musical composer and co-founder of Key; Itaru Hinoue, a signature art director, character designer, and co-founder of Key; and another woman named Chiro from the visual novel studio Pekoe, also under Visual Art's. The greeting was used by the hosts to address the listeners, and was also used by the listeners as an opening greeting in submissions. For the first six episodes, the show had five corners, or parts, but from the seventh broadcast on two more corners were added to the program. When the show had five corners, each episode started with opening greetings from the hosts and went onto thoughts and impressions that listeners had about the show. This moved on to an informal talk between the hosts, followed by a section where entries previously submitted by listeners concerning their enthusiasm for Key were read by the hosts. The fourth corner concerned answering questions that had been submitted by listeners, and the final corner had Orito playing the flute; listeners could submit suggestions for songs he was to play. The first corner added concerns scary stories that the hosts can tell themselves, or read from submissions by listeners, and was added partly because Hinoue enjoys such stories. The second corner added deals with submissions by listeners describing a new fictional character, and Hinoue will take these submissions and form a new fictional character out of combining elements from multiple submissions together. During the broadcasts, tracks from the soundtracks released under Key Sounds Label play in the background.
Broadcast history.
2007–2008.
The first broadcast was released on December 13, 2007 and was originally over an hour long, but was cut down to 30 minutes. The main topic of discussion of the first broadcast was Key's products at Comiket 73 held in late December 2007. The second broadcast was an end-of-the-year special released on December 28, 2007 and was longer than the first broadcast at 41:30 minutes. The third broadcast was a New Year Expansion edition released on January 22, 2008 and ran for 43:30 minutes. The fourth broadcast was released on February 25, 2008, covered the then-upcoming OTSU Vol. 2 album release as the main topic, and ran for 39:06 minutes. The fifth broadcast was released on March 19, 2008 and was so long that it was split it into two parts, the first at 38:12 minutes, and the second at 30:40 minutes. The main feature of the fifth broadcast was of having Na-Ga as a guest on the show.

History.
Kyōwa Station was opened on December 7, 1933 as a passenger station on the Japanese Government Railways (JGR) Tōkaidō Main Line. The station was closed on November 1, 1940 and reopened on July 11, 1945 but only for seasonal operations. The JGR became the Japan National Railway (JNR) after World War II. Full passenger operations did not resume until September 1, 1951. Small parcel operations were discontinued from November 1971. With the privatization and dissolution of the JNR on April 1, 1987, the station came under the control of the Central Japan Railway Company. Automatic turnstiles were installed in May 1992, and the TOICA system of magnetic fare cards was implemented in October 2007.

Chichester Theological College

Chichester Theological College (1838-1994) was an Anglican theological college for the Diocese of Chichester in Sussex, England.
History.
It was founded by William Otter in July 1838, the first such Diocesan college in England. Charles Marriott of Oriel College, Oxford was its first principal and the first donation, of £50, for the college was from W. E. Gladstone.
From 1886, during Josiah Sanders Teulon's time as principal, the college experienced a gradual decline in students. This was exacerbated in 1899, when he resigned, but retained his income as a resident canon. At a meeting of the college council, it was resolved to close the college. However, the vice-principal made a successful case for continuing and Herbert Rickard was appointed the new principal.
In 1903, a hostel in West Street, Chichester was bought for £1000 by the college council, the balance being paid by the principal in memory of his wife. This was refitted and became the college headquarters. This hostel was sold in 1919 and the proceeds went towards the purchase of new headquarters in Westgate, Chichester for £3500. On May 1st 1919 the college was formally re-opened by Bishop Charles Ridgeway (his last episcopal act) and was dedicated to St Richard of Chichester.
During the Second World War the college was forced to move temporarily to Cambridge, while its buildings in Chichester were used by the military authorities. At the end of the War, the college buildings were sold, except for Marriott House, which was used to house the re-opened college from 21st October 1946.
Closure.
After its closure in 1994, its theological library was transferred to the University of Chichester. In addition, St. Bartholomew's Chapel, which served as the chapel to the theological college is now the Chaplaincy building of Chichester College.

Winteringham railway station was built by the North Lindsey Light Railway in Winteringham, Lincolnshire, England and opened for public service on 15 July 1907 although the first train, a village sports club special, had run two days previously.
Just north of the station the line divided in two; the "main line" ran to Whitton, and a "branch line" to a wharf at Winteringham Haven on the Humber where the company had installed two shutes for handling coal and slag. A weekly ferry service operated from the Haven to Hull, outward on Monday and returning on Wednesday.
The station closed to passengers on Monday 13 July 1925, though in all probability the last train ran on Saturday 11 July. It remained open for goods traffic until 1 October 1951, with local farmers objecting strongly to its closure, citing particularly the station's use for onward transportation of their sugar beet to the Brigg sugar factory.

No Way Out (2000)

No Way Out (2000) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), which took place on February 27, 2000 at the Hartford Civic Center in Hartford, Connecticut. It was presented by PhoneFree.com. It was the first event produced under the No Way Out name, although it was preceded in 1998 by an event named .
The main event was a Hell in a Cell match, a match where the ring and ringside area was surrounded by a 20-foot-high roofed steel cell between WWF Champion Triple H and Cactus Jack; Triple H won the match to retain his championship. The featured bout on the undercard was a standard wrestling match, also known as a singles match, for a championship match at WrestleMania 2000 in which The Big Show defeated The Rock.
Background.
The event featured eleven professional wrestling matches with outcomes predetermined by WWF script writers. The matches featured wrestlers portraying their characters in planned story lines that took place before, during and after the event.
The Main Feud going into No Way Out was between Triple H and Cactus Jack fighting over the WWF Championship inside a Hell in a Cell. The feud started after Triple H defeated his father-in-law Mr. McMahon at Armageddon in No Holds Barred and also winning the WWF Title from The Big Show on Raw only a few weeks later. These events would start the McMahon-Hemesly Era with his wife Stephanie McMahon. Mankind would rebel against this new era and would receive attacks from D-X and Triple H. Mick Foley would drop the Mankind character to Cactus Jack. At the Royal Rumble Triple H and Cactus Jack would fight in a Street Fight Match for the WWF Championship, which was won by Triple H. The next night on Raw Triple H would grant Cactus another chance at the title at the PPV No Way Out and that the match can be any kind he wants. Cactus would later decide that the match will be a Hell in a Cell. Triple H said that it was deal only if he would put his career on the line, which he would agree to. Over the next few weeks Triple H would start predicting that he would end the fifteen year career of Mick Foley.
Another feud heading into No Way Out was between The Rock and The Big Show over who should get the chance to face for the WWF Championship at WrestleMania. The feud began at the Royal Rumble in the Royal Rumble Match, The Rock and The Big Show were the last two competitors in the match both trying to throw each other over the rope. Both wrestlers fell out of the ring hitting the floor, The Rock hit the floor first but the officials thought The Big Show hit the ground first making The Rock the winner of the Royal Rumble. The next night on Raw The Big Show complained that it was no fair that nobody saw what happened so he got evidence and sent it to Triple H. Triple H would later make a match between The Rock and The Big Show at No Way Out where the winner will get the WWF Championship Chance at WrestleMania.
Event.
Before the event began and aired live on pay-per-view, an episode of "Sunday Night Heat", one of WWE's secondary television programs, was taped live. In a singles match, Mosh defeated WWF Light Heavyweight Champion Essa Rios by disqualification. Following that match, in a mixed tag team match, the team of Ivory and Mideon defeated Jacqueline and Funaki
Preliminary matches.
After "Sunday Night Heat", the pay-per-view began with a singles match for the WWF Intercontinental Championship with Chris Jericho and Kurt Angle. Both Angle and Jericho wrestled inconclusively in the beginning, including an attempt by Jericho to force Angle to submit by applying the Walls of Jericho, but Angle grabbed the ropes surrounding the ring, which forced Jericho to break the hold. While the referee Tim White was (kayfabe) unconscious, Jericho attempted to hit Angle with a Lionsault, but was hit in the face with the Intercontinental Championship belt. Angle then covered Jericho for the pinfall, winning the Intercontinental Championship. Following the match, referees White and Hebner argued over the conclusion.
The following bout was a tag team match for the WWF Tag Team Championship, where the champions, the New Age Outlaws (the Road Dogg and Billy Gunn), defended their titles against the Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray and D-Von). Throughout the match, both teams performed many offensive maneuvers, though The Dudley Boyz were able to gain the upper hand when Bubba Ray struck Billy Gunn with a lead pipe on the outside of the ring and did the 3D on Road Dogg inside the ring. Bubba Ray then covered Road Dogg to win the WWF Tag Team Championship for his team.
The third contest was Viscera versus Mark Henry in a standard match. Late in the match, Viscera hit Henry with a spinning heel kick and got the advantage. Then Viscera crushed Henry with the ladders on the outside and performed a belly to belly suplex until Mae Young interfered on behalf of Mark Henry. After she distracted Viscera, Mark Henry Spear and then Scoop powerslam him. He then pinned Viscera for the win.
The next match was a tag team match where Edge and Christian faced the Hardy Boyz (Matt and Jeff), who were escorted by Terri Runnels. Prior to the match, Terri had (kayfabe) hired the Acolytes Protection Agency (Bradshaw and Faarooq) as protection, and they were at ringside throughout the match. Both teams attempted to gain the advantage throughout the contest, and Edge and Christian ultimately gained it when Terri turned on the Hardy Boyz, pushing Jeff off the top rope as he attempted his finisher called the Swanton Bomb. As Matt questioned her, Terri slapped him and Christian struck Matt from behind and pinned him for the win. Following his loss, the Hardy Boyz attempted to pull Terri into the ring, but the APA attacked them.
The fifth contest was a standard match between Tazz and The Big Boss Man. Soon after the match began, Tazz applied the Tazzmission to Boss Man in an attempt to make him submit, but Prince Albert interfered and attacked Tazz, causing a disqualification. As Tazz was the one attacked, the victory was given to him. Following the match, Prince Albert and Boss Man assaulted Tazz in the ring.
Main event matches.
The next match was X-Pac, escorted by Tori, versus Kane, escorted by Paul Bearer, in a No Holds Barred match. X-Pac and Kane wrestled extensively on the entrance ramp including X-Pac throwing Kane into a steel cage, and Paul Bearer interfered often, attacking X-Pac. X-Pac gave Kane an X-Factor but he recovered. Kane then chokeslammed X-Pac followed by a tombstone piledriver to Tori.The match ended when X-Pac dropkicked the steel ring steps into Kane's face and covered him for a pin.
The seventh match on the card was a six man tag team match where Too Cool (Rikishi, Scotty 2 Hotty, and Grand Master Sexay) faced The Radicalz (Chris Benoit, Dean Malenko, and Perry Saturn). Both teams performed many offensive maneuvers throughout the match, but Too Cool gained the upper hand when Rikishi delivered a Banzai Drop to Malenko. This was followed by a cover for the pin.
The featured bout on the undercard was The Big Show versus The Rock for a championship match at WrestleMania 2000. During the match, referee Tim White was knocked out, and upon recovering he was involved in a fight with fellow referee Earl Hebner, causing referee White to not count the pin when the Big Show covered the Rock. Shane McMahon came to officiate the match. The Rock then delivered the Rock Bottom, one of his finishing manoeuvres, and was attempting to perform the People's Elbow on his fallen opponent, when McMahon hit the Rock with a steel chair. The Big Show then covered the Rock and got a pin.
The main event was a Hell in a Cell match for the WWF Championship, in which WWF Champion Triple H defended his championship against Cactus Jack, with the added stipulation that if Jack lost he would have to retire from professional wrestling. The match began inside a structure of metal surrounding the ring and ringside area. Throughout the match, many weapons were employed, such as steel chairs and a 2x4 with barbed wire wrapped around it (the 2x4 was also set on fire later in the match). When the ring steps were repeatedly thrown against the wall of the cell, it tore open and Cactus Jack jumped through it to the outside of the cage. The men fought first on the announcers' table with Jack piledriving Triple H on it, and later both men wrestled on the top of the cage. While on top of the cell, Cactus Jack attempted a Piledriver, but the move was reversed and Triple H backdropped him onto the cell roof. The move broke the cell roof and Cactus Jack fell through to the mat below, buckling the surface of the ring. After Jack stood up again, Triple H performed the Pedigree on him. He then covered Cactus Jack for a successful pin to win the match.
Aftermath.
After The Rock lost against The Big Show, they continued their feud the next night on Raw Is War in a match where if The Rock lost he must leave the company. Shane McMahon was made special guest referee, and during the match Shane hit The Rock with a steel chair and tried to get The Big Show to cover him. Vince McMahon ran into the ring, hit his son, and allowed The Rock to perform a Rock Bottom on the Big Show and cover him for the pin. Vince sided with The Rock and promised him a match at WrestleMania for the WWF Championship. Shane McMahon came out the next night on Raw and announced that the match would be a Triple Threat match (a standard match with three participants) also including the Big Show. Following this match taking place on a Raw Is War preceding WrestleMania 16, Linda McMahon appeared and announced that the match occurring at WrestleMania would instead be a Fatal Four Way Elimination (a match with four participants where three must sequentially be eliminated via pinfall or submission) with Mick Foley whom Triple H had retired, filling the last spot. At WrestleMania Triple H defeated the three other men and thus retained his WWF Title. Both Vince and Shane McMahon betrayed the wrestlers they were backing and joined Triple H and Stephanie McMahon's faction, while Linda remained with Foley. The Rock received a rematch at Backlash 2000 and defeated Triple H, thanks to the help of Linda McMahon and Stone Cold Steve Austin. The two would also have an Iron Man Match (a match lasting sixty minutes where the victor is the performer with the most decisions at the end of the time limit) with Shawn Michaels as Special Guest Referee, which saw Triple H regain the title after Michaels disqualified The Rock due to interference from The Undertaker giving Triple H the deciding decision. They would finally end their feud at King of the Ring 2000 in a Six-Man Tag Team Match in which the participant on the Rock's team who gained the victory would be named champion The Rock would have both Kane and The Undertaker on his team, while Triple H had Vince McMahon and Shane McMahon. The Rock would win his fifth world championship after beating Vince.

No Way Out (2001)

No Way Out (2001) was a professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It was the third such annual event and took place on February 25, 2001 at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. It was presented by Weider Nutrition.
Seven professional wrestling matches were scheduled on the event's card, which featured a supercard, a scheduling of more than one main event. The first saw The Rock defeat Kurt Angle in a standard wrestling match, also known as a singles match to win the WWF Championship, despite interference by The Big Show. The other main event was a Three Stages of Hell match, in which Triple H defeated Steve Austin, two falls to one. The featured bout on the undercard was a Fatal Four Way match between defending WWF Intercontinental Champion Chris Jericho, Chris Benoit, Eddie Guerrero and X-Pac, in which Chris Jericho was victorious.
Background.
The main feud heading into the show was between The Rock and Kurt Angle for the WWF Championship. At SummerSlam on August 27, The Rock defeated Kurt Angle and Triple H in a Triple threat match to retain the WWF title. In a rematch at No Mercy (2000), Kurt Angle beat the Rock for the WWF Championship. In the match, Rikishi interfered on Rock's behalf but accidentally nailed him with a savate kick, enabling Angle to finish off Rock with the Angle Slam. The following two months at Armageddon (2000), Angle pinned The Rock to retain the WWF title in a Hell in a Cell, also involving Steve Austin, Triple H, Rikishi and The Undertaker. On the January 1 episode of "Raw Is War", The Rock lost a number one contenders match to Kane by countout after WWF Champion Kurt Angle interfered. A few days later on "SmackDown!", Rock lost a non-title match to Angle by disqualification after nailing Angle with the steel chair. On the February 8 episode of "SmackDown!", The Rock defeated The Big Show to become the number one contender to face the WWF Champion Kurt Angle at No Way Out. On the final episode of "SmackDown!", WWF Champion Kurt Angle teamed with Edge and Christian against The Rock, Kane and The Undertaker in a six man Tables match. At the end, Angle's team won when Angle performed an Angle slam to The Rock through a table for the victory. After the match, he finished off Rock with the ankle lock at the close of the show.
Another main feud was between Steve Austin and Triple H which began at SummerSlam (1999) when Triple H, after failing to win the WWF title from Steve Austin in a Triple threat match, involving Mankind, decided to hit Austin with a steel chair and targeted his leg with it. Austin would get his rematch at No Mercy (1999) against Triple H but lost after The Rock accidentally struck him with a sledgehammer that was meant for Triple H. At the Survivor Series (1999), Austin was booked into a triple threat match for the WWF Championship that also included then-WWF Champion Triple H and The Rock. Instead, however, Austin was run down by a car in the parking lot. The Big Show would replace Austin in the match and would win the WWF Championship. What followed was neck surgery by Dr. Lloyd Youngblood and a nine-month rehabilitation with the car angle as his reason for leaving. In September 2000 at Unforgiven, Austin made his official return and tried to find out who ran him down at Survivor Series the previous year. On the October 9, 2000 episode of "Raw Is War", Rikishi finally admitted to being the driver because "he did it for The Rock." The following Pay per view, No Mercy, Austin was back to face Rikishi in a No Holds Barred Match. During the match, Austin motioned he was going to drive his truck into Rikishi, who by that time was a bloody mess. Before he could, he was stopped by officials and the match was deemed a no contest. Austin was then arrested and was later bailed by Commissioner Mick Foley. During a handicap match against Rikishi and Kurt Angle, Triple H came down with the apparent intention of teaming with Austin. After clearing the ring, Triple H smashed his sledgehammer over Austin's head, and revealed it was actually him behind the whole scheme by paying off Rikishi to run Austin over, devised to shield the WWF Championship from Austin and end his career. At Survivor Series, Triple H had plotted to run Austin down again during their match (thus repeating the events of the previous year's Survivor Series) but his plot failed when Austin lifted Triple H's automobile with a forklift, then let it drop 20 feet. On the January 8 episode of "Raw Is War", Austin challenged Kurt Angle for the WWF Championship. The title match ended in a no contest when Triple H interfered and struck Austin with a Steel pipe. At the Royal Rumble, Austin got back at Triple H by interfering and costing him the WWF title then during the latter event, he won the Royal Rumble match, last eliminating Kane. On the February 5 episode of "Raw Is War", during the contract signing segment WWF Chairman Vince McMahon announced a Three Stages of Hell match between Steve Austin and Triple H at No Way Out to settle their differences. McMahon then warned that if Triple H and/or Austin lays a hand on one another before No Way Out, Triple H gets suspended for six months and Steve Austin loses his WrestleMania title shot. After Austin signed his name on paper, Triple H nailed him from behind with the brief case and stomped on him. McMahon then reminded him that he has been suspended but he stated that he has yet to sign his name on the contract and did it anyway. On the final episode of "Raw Is War", Austin nailed Triple H's wife Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley with the Stone Cold Stunner on the same week on "SmackDown!", where Triple H performed a Pedigree on Austin's friend and Raw play-by-play commentator Jim Ross.
Aftermath.
After No Way Out, Steve Austin set his focus back to the WWF Championship and the new champion, The Rock. Austin won the WWF championship at WrestleMania X-Seven from The Rock in a No Disqualification match after Mr. McMahon handed Austin a steel chair to hit Rock with. The following night on Raw is War, Austin and Triple H truly laid their differences to rest by teaming up and assaulting The Rock following a steel cage match The Rock had with Austin.
Triple H felt that after he'd defeated Austin, there was no one left in the WWF to beat and that he had deserved to be in the main event at WrestleMania. The Undertaker then told Triple H that he'd never beat him and challenged him to a match at WrestleMania, which was made official by WWF Commissioner William Regal after Kane threatened to throw Stephanie McMahon over a balcony. Undertaker would go on to defeat Triple H at WrestleMania and improve his record at WrestleMania to 9–0. Their feud continued, however, with Steve Austin at Triple H's side as The Two-Man Power Trip and Kane at Undertaker's side. The two teams would face-off at Backlash where Austin and Triple H would come out victorious.

Ostad Mohammad Baharloo

Mohammad Baharloo (Persian: محمد بهارلو) (April 1929 – February 14, 2007) was a renowned Iranian musician, violinist, composer and conductor.
Biography.
Maestro Mohammad Baharloo was born in Tehran. In his family, Mohammad was the only one that adopted music as a profession. His oldest brother, Abdollah Baharloo was familiar with music and tried to familiarize Mohammad with beautiful folk songs as a child. At a very early age, Baharloo lost his father, a man of important stature in the Iranian political arena of the time. Thereafter, the responsibility of raising the young Baharloo fell on the shoulders of his cultured and patient mother.
Baharloo began playing the violin as an adolescent under the directions of Seyed Mohammad Bahrini Poor. However, in order to become familiarized with the international techniques of playing the violin, Baharloo took lessons from Carl Yan Zubeck who was one of the twelve music instructors sent to Iran at the time from the Czech Republic. After Yan Zubeck left Iran for his home country, Baharloo became a pupil of Rubick Gregorian, a skillful Armenian violinist.
As an adolescent, young Baharloo began thinking of researching the forming techniques of classical Persian music. However, none of the masters of music at the time could provide him with concrete responses. Hence, young Baharloo decided to take matters into his own hands; it was this decision that led to the publication of six volumes of his work fifteen years later. His pupils were Mohsen Molana, Salmak Saghaie and Hamed Ibrahimi.

Old Meldrum railway station

Old Meldrum railway station was a railway station in Old Meldrum, Aberdeenshire.
History.
Background.
Until the turn of the 18th century Oldmeldrum - then written Old Meldrum - was the principal market town between Aberdeen and Banff. However, with the building of the canal between Aberdeen and Port Elphinstone - on the River Don at Inverurie (then spelled Inverury) - the pre-eminence of Oldmeldrum waned. Whereas goods had been transported by road via Oldmeldrum and the small port of Newburgh at the mouth of the River Ythan, trade increasingly concentrated on Inverurie and its canal link with Aberdeen. By 1850, Inverurie was almost twice the size of Oldmeldrum.
When railway mania came to the North East in the 1840s, the canal in turn made way for the new Great North of Scotland Railway (GNSR), which was opened from Aberdeen to Huntly in 1854. The people of Oldmeldrum had high hopes that a link to the new railway would restore its prosperity. Although the Oldmeldrum branch was not initially included in the raft of branch lines planned by GNSR, it became the first to be opened, in 1856. Proposals for the Oldmeldrum branch included its extension northwards to join the Banff, Macduff and Turriff Junction Railway. Consideration was also given to a line extending via Methlick to join the Formartine and Buchan Railway to Fraserburgh and Peterhead. Eventually, though, these ideas were discarded in favour of a simple branch to Oldmeldrum.
The Inverury and Old Meldrum Junction Railway (I&OJR) was promoted with GNSR support and its Act received Royal Assent on 15 June 1855. This authorised the construction of the line from a junction near Inverurie, running for 5 miles, 1194 yards to its destination. Subsequently, in 1902, the original was moved half a mile northwards to its current location, with the result that the official length of the Oldmeldrum branch became 4 miles, 1617 yards. Originally there was only one intermediate station - at , which served the important oatmeal mill - but later a halt was opened at , where there were wool-carding mills.
Construction of the line was easy, as it lay along fairly flat ground. A cast iron girder bridge, of 50 foot span, over the River Ury was the only notable engineering feature. Thus it was that the line, which was started in September 1855, was completed by June 1856, at a cost of £5,000 per mile. After an inspection and satisfactory report by the Board of Trade officer on 23 June 1856, the official opening took place just three days later. A special train of a dozen carriages left Aberdeen at 1:15 pm, containing a large number of gentlemen and picking up others on the way to Oldmeldrum. The press report of the day waxed lyrical: "The engine was gaily busked with flowers, fog signals were let off at the various stations and the excellent band of the 79th, which accompanied the party, contributed largely to the spirited and harmonious character of the proceedings".
The train reached Oldmeldrum station at 2:30 pm and was welcomed by the cheers of a crowd of several hundreds from the town, where a general holiday was enthusiastically observed. The station house was decorated with evergreens and flags and there was a grand triumphal arch of evergreens and flowers over the line, with a crown in the centre. On arrival at Oldmeldrum, wine and cake were served to the ladies and gentlemen on the platform. At 4:00 pm, a party of 300 of the great and good sat down to dinner in the engine shed, which had been got up as a banqueting hall decorated with flags and with the Meldrum Arms over the chair. After the dinner, there were the usual lengthy speeches and toasts proposing the health and prosperity of the line and optimism about it being extended. After the train departed on the return journey to Aberdeen at 8:00 pm, the "gala day" was completed with a bonfire and display of fireworks in the town square.
The station.
In common with many other locations, the Oldmeldrum line did not actually enter the town it was intended to serve. The station was at Strathmeldrum, some 5 minutes walk downhill to the south from the main square. Then, it was surrounded by fields - with fine open views, particularly westwards to Bennachie’s Mither Tap. Today, the station area is hemmed in on all sides, with housing to the north and east and a large industrial site on its southern and western boundaries.
Oldmeldrum station comprised a fine granite station house, an engine shed, a carriage shed, a range of goods sheds and the usual loading bay. There was a turntable, to meet the Board of Trade’s requirement that engines did not run tender first. The turntable seems to have been a relatively short-lived installation and was removed in the 1880s. As with the turntable, the station was to lose its original station building, which was replaced by the present wooden structure in the early 1890s. It is a testament to the materials and workmanship that it remains in such generally good shape 120 years later. The roof structure is as pristine as the day it was erected. The design of this replacement followed the standard format for other GNSR stations - a good example of which can be seen on the Deeside line at Pitfodels Halt. Against these losses must be set the addition of a signal box in 1895 and the introduction of interlocked signalling and the telegraph.
Looking around the site today, whilst there is no trace of the signal box, it is still possible to gain a clear picture of what the complex looked like in its heyday, with not only the main station building on the platform, but also the goods loading platform and two of the sheds remain as shown by the attached photos. It is perhaps ironic that the main part of the site is now used by a bus company, since - as we shall see - it was to be the motorbus which led to the eventual withdrawal of passenger services from the town.
The ups and downs of the railway.
Traffic on the line started on 1 July 1856, with a service of four mixed passenger and goods trains from Oldmeldrum and three trains from Inverurie, all connecting with trains to/from Aberdeen. The exception was the lunchtime train from Oldmeldrum, which worked forward as a goods train to Waterloo Quay - then the Aberdeen terminus of GNSR - returning at 3:00 pm. The service was subsequently increased to 6 trains in each direction, with a typical journey taking 20 minutes for the .
In terms of goods exported, the station relied mainly on its agricultural hinterland, with the transport of livestock, milk, potatoes, sawn timber, oats and most importantly casks of whisky from the nearby Glen Garioch distillery. This institution was also to provide regular traffic inwards with the carriage of coal and barley for the malting process. It is reported that the handling of the coal brought its own problems. In winter, after a hard frost, it had to be loosened with a pick-axe before it could be unloaded from the wagons, whilst in summer it had to be sprinkled with water to counter the “stew” (dust). The other main commodities imported to Oldmeldrum were cattle feed, fertilisers and cereal seed, as well as coal for home fires and for the Oldmeldrum gasworks (which supplied the lighting for the station building).
The branch’s passenger train ranked high in the affection of the locals, who bestowed the sobriquet of "Meldrum Meg" on the branch engine, which at the time was a Samuel tank it had acquired from the Morayshire railway. The Inverurie poet Dufton Scott had referred to it in one of his readings as "Meldrum Meg". From then on, every engine was known by this name.
Unfortunately the expectations of the townsfolk of Oldmeldrum for a revival of its fortunes from the arrival of the railway proved to be forlorn. The anticipated boom failed to materialise. Indeed, traffic on the branch developed so slowly that the income generated was insufficient to finance the company’s debts. As a result, as early as 1858, the I&OJR decided to transfer its operations to GNSR. It was finally wound-up in 1866. It seems that matters improved slightly thereafter, the report from the General Manager to the Directors of GNSR in 1870 recording that "The entire train expenses including fuel, wages of drivers, guards, etc do not exceed £350 per annum and the station expenses amount to about £250. The traffic to and from Oldmeldrum and Lethenty Stations yielded last year a gross revenue of £4935."
Increasingly, though - with improving highways - road transportation expanded and took traffic away from the railway. Not only did road hauliers undercut the railway’s freight charges, but the travelling public turned to buses for their convenience and economy. Attempts were made by the railway company to counter the drift to the roads and, in 1905, it experimented with steam railcars to find a more viable way of transporting passengers. That these were withdrawn in 1907 suggests the experiment was unsuccessful.
The writing was on the wall for the passenger service when a direct bus service between Fyvie and Aberdeen, calling at Oldmeldrum, was introduced in 1923. As the standard of comfort and speed of the buses improved, passenger traffic was further eroded. A 1930 internal report of the LNER, which had taken over from GNSR, highlights the stark economic reality: “ . . . the passenger receipts were £122 and the gross revenue on contributory passenger traffic was £121. One engine undertakes both the passenger and goods traffic and a Sentinel Cammell car for passengers traffic would be no saving since an engine would be required for goods traffic. It is reckoned . . . that if passenger traffic were withdrawn the following saving will accrue;
Thus it was that on Saturday 31 October 1931, the last passenger service was operated, although from time to time excursions were to run on the line. Its loss was lamented in the following verse:
Thereafter, Oldmeldrum became purely a goods station and was further downgraded by the loss of its stationmaster. Competition from the roads continued unabated and - as with so much of the rural network - the Oldmeldrum branch’s economics spiralled ever-downwards, with the service reduced to one train a day.
It came as no surprise therefore that the branch was consigned to history by the Beeching Report of 1963. Only a small crowd turned up on 20 December 1965 to watch the last train pull out of Oldmeldrum. Though it was not an occasion for celebration, perhaps fittingly it was a 666 gallon consignment of whisky from the Glen Garioch distillery that formed the last train. Following the official closure of the branch line on 3 January 1966, it was temporarily used to store wagons before the demolition team arrived to lift the track.
Renaissance.
The Oldmeldrum station building itself survived into the 21st Century. The volunteers of the Royal Deeside Railway (a local heritage railway) conceived the idea of moving it for restoration as the station building at their . , the core of the building has been re-erected at the new site, the roof is on and restoration continues.

Campos was later traded to Real Salt Lake on July 15, 2009. Campos scored his first goal for Salt Lake on August 26, 2009 in a home match against Chivas USA at Rio Tinto Stadium. The strike turned out to be the winning goal in a 4–0 RSL triumph. A few days later, he scored the lone goal in Real Salt Lake's 1–0 victory against the Kansas City Wizards – the club's first-ever win in Kansas City. Campos and Real Salt Lake won the MLS Cup in 2009 after a great season.
Campos played sparingly for RSL in 2010 and was released by the club on February 28, 2011.

Madern Gerthener

Madern Gerthener (1360/1370 – 1430) was a German stonemason and late Gothic architect.
Gerthener was born in Frankfurt to Johann Gerthener, a stonemason whose business the younger Gerthener took over by 1391. In 1395 he entered the city payroll, and soon took a leading role in the city's large construction works. One of his earlier works was involvement in building the Alte Brücke (Old Bridge) over the Main in 1399, and, although his role in only a few other works is directly attested, he was probably involved in a number of other projects around Frankfurt as its "Werkmeister", including the city walls and town hall.
Of high architecture, the largest portion of his career in Frankfurt was spent on the Frankfurt Cathedral, whose works he was appointed to oversee in 1408. Of note here are the Cathedral's single tower, which Gerthener designed and began building in 1415, and which would become a symbol of Frankfurt's independence; and innovative use of hanging and vaulted tracery forms on the cathedral's portals that would become a characteristic of his style. He may have also been responsible for the tympanum above the south portal of the Liebfrauenkirche in Frankfurt, depicting a scene of the Adoration of the Magi.
By the 1410s his services were in enough demand that he worked on a number of projects outside Frankfurt as well, though most are only attributed to Gerthener based on style. The most important and confidently attributed of these are the portal to the Memorial Chapel of the Mainz Cathedral, dated to around 1425, which also includes several sculptures attributed to him, partly on the basis of payment records indicating he had at least occasionally worked as a sculptor.

Laurenz Forer

Laurenz Forer (1580 – 7 January 1659) was a Swiss Jesuit theologian and controversialist.
Life.
He was born at Lucerne, entered the Society of Jesus at the age of twenty, in Landshut, and made part of his studies under Paul Laymann and Adam Tanner. He taught philosophy at Ingolstadt (1615–1619), and theology, moral and controversial, for six years at Dillingen. In the latter institution he held also the office of chancellor for several years. 
He spent the years 1632–1643 in Tyrol, where he had withdrawn with Heinrich von Knoringen, Bishop of Augsburg, on account of the inroads of the Swedes. Forer visited Rome (1645–1646) as the representative of the province of Upper Germany in the eighth congregation. He became rector of the college of Lucerne in 1650. He died at Ratisbon.
Works.
Sommervogel enumerates 62 titles of publications from the pen of Forer, not all of them long works.
He wrote one or more treatises each against the apostates Reihing and de Dominis, and against Melchior Nicolai (1578–1659), Hottinger, Kallisen, Schopp, Molinos, Haberkorn, Voet, Hoe, the Ubiquists, and others. Such works as "Lutherus thaumaturgus" (Dillingen, 1624), "Septem characteres Lutheri" (Dillingen, 1626), "Quaestio ubinam ante Lutherum protestantium ecclesia fuerit" (Pt. I, Amberg, 1653; P. II, Ingolstadt, 1654), "Bellum ubiquisticum vetus et novum inter ipsos Lutheranos bellatum et needum debellatum" (Dillingen, 1627) are directed against all Protestants. Others, as "Anatomia anatomiae Societatis Jesu" (Innsbruck, 1634), "Mantissa Ant-anatomiae Jesuiticae" (Innsbruck, 1635; Cologne, 1635), "Grammaticus Proteus, arcanorum Societatis Jesu Daedalus" (Ingolstadt, 1636), "Appendix ad grammaticum Proteum" (Ingolstadt, 1636), attack the enemies of the Society of Jesus.
Two of his works, written for Catholics, "Disputirkunst fur die einfaltigen Catholischen" (Ingolstadt, 1656) and "Leben Jesu Christi" (Dillingen, 1650–1658), were re-edited and republished at Würzburg (1861) and Ratisbon (1856).

In 1791 he was elected a member of the Société d’histoire naturelle and in the same year joined Bruni d'Entrecasteaux's voyage in search of Jean-François de Galaup, comte de La Pérouse. The expedition visited Tenerife, Cape of Good Hope, Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania), New Ireland, Admiralty Islands, Ambon, Esperance Bay (Western Australia), Van Diemen's Land again, Tongatapu and Balade (New Caledonia) before disintegrating on royalist and republican lines in the Dutch East Indies on receiving news of the execution of Louis XVI. 
Riche appears to have been consumptive and sought appointment as a naturalist on the Espérance because he believed the sea air would benefit his condition. It is also said that he wished to impress the family of a young woman with whom he was in love. Riche’s main responsibilities were the study of minerals, birds and invertebrates, but he also assumed responsibility for meteorological observations and chemical studies. During the expedition’s sojourn at Esperance he became separated from his colleagues for two days and was nearly given up for dead. 
Like Labillardière, Riche lost his collections when the expedition disintegrated in the Dutch East Indies. He was allowed to sail for the Ile-de-France (Mauritius) on the "Scagen" in 18 July 1794 (in company with Willaumez, Legrand, Laignel, Ventenat and nineteen other crew members). With the assistance of Governor Maures de Malartic’s of the Isle de France (now Mauritius), Riche returned to Batavia in November 1794 on the "Nathalie" (Captaine Brion), under a flag of truce and carrying Dutch prisoners of war) in the hope of retrieving his papers and collections. Alas, the Dutch ignored his requests and he departed Batavia again on 29 March 1795, on the "Nathalie", but nevertheless after having secured the release of Jacques Labillardière, the artist Jean Piron and some fifty other crew members from the original expedition. 
He returned to France in June 1796 and died the following year at Mont Dore in the Auvergne.

A. Seshayya Sastri

Sir Amaravati Seshayya Sastri () KCSI (March 22, 1828 – October 29, 1903), or Sashiah Sastri, was an Indian administrator who served as the Diwan of Travancore from May 1872 to May 4, 1877 and as the Diwan of Pudukkottai from 1878 to 1894. He is credited with having modernized the city of Pudukkottai.
Seshayya Sastri was born in the village of Amaravati in Tanjore district, Madras Presidency in 1828 in a poor Hindu family. At the age of nine, Seshayya Sastri moved to Madras city with his uncle Gopala Aiyer. Seshayya Sastri had his schooling and higher education in Madras and graduated in 1848 in first class. 
In 1848, Seshayya Sastri was employed as a clerk in the Revenue Office and rose to become Tahsildar, Naib Sheristadar and later, Head Sheristadar. In 1872, Seshayya Sastri was appointed Diwan of Travancore and served from 1872 to 1877, when palace intrigues forced him to quit. Seshayya Sastri served as Diwan of Pudukkottai from 1878 to 1886 and Diwan-Regent from 1886 to 1894. He rebuilt the town of Pudukkottai and created the Pudukulam Lake. Seshayya Sastri retired from service in 1894. He died on October 29, 1903 at the age of 75.
Seshayya Sastri was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India in 1902.
Early life.
Seshayya Sastri was born on March 22, 1828 in the village of Amaravati in Tanjore district in a Vathima Iyer family. He was the youngest of six children and his father was a Vaidika priest. Sastri's parents were poor and Seshayyah Sastri had a troubled upbringing. At a very early age, he moved with his uncle Gopala Aiyer, to Madras. In Madras, he learnt Tamil from a private tuition master and had his first English lessons at a school run by a Portuguese named Francis Rodriques. In 1837, Seshayya Sastri joined Anderson's school. As a child, Seshayya Sastri mastered verses from the Bible and became a favorite with the Rev. Mr. Anderson. In 1840, as a result of violent protests and accusations of proselytization against Anderson, an Education Board was set up by the Madras Government and a preparatory and a high school established by the board. Seshayya Sastri joined the preparatory school in 1841. The school was later upgraded to a high school and Seshayya Sastri studied in the school till 1848 when financial difficulties forced him to quit. The headmaster of the school was the legendary E. B. Powell who took a special liking for the boy. Sastri's classmates at the school were the illustrious Ramiengar and T. Madhava Rao. In 1848, he joined Pachaiyappa's school and studied with the aid of a regular stipend from the Government. 
Meanwhile, Sastri's uncle Gopala Aiyer died in 1847. The very same year Seshayya Sastri married Sundari, a native of Konerirajapuram and became a householder. Seshayya Sastri rigorously practised oratory and drama along with his close friend Ramiengar. He graduated on May 29, 1848 in first class. In September 1848, Sastri was employed as a clerk in the Revenue Office.
Career.
Seshayya Sastri's performance as a clerk won him a place in the Roving Commission. Later, Seshayya was transferred to the Currents Department and was eventually appointed Tahsildar of Masulipatnam in May 1851. Sastri was promoted as Naib Sheristadar in 1853 and Head Sheristadar on November 5, 1855. Seshayya served in the Imam Commission from November 1858 to 1865, when he was appointed Deputy Collector of Tanjore. Sastri took charge in April 1866 and served for a year till he was appointed Vice President of the Tanjore municipality. In 1869, Seshayya was appointed Head Sheristadar of the Board of Revenue. In May 1872, he succeeded his classmate Madhava Rao as the Dewan of Travancore.
As Dewan of Travancore.
During the tenure of Seshayya Sastri as Dewan, the Varkala Tunnel connecting two lakes in Varkala, forty kilometres from Tiruvananthapuram city was opened for traffic. The first systematic census of Travancore state was taken on May 18, 1875.
Seshayya Sastri became Dewan at a time when Travancore was gripped by political intrigues. Sastri's predecessor Madhava Rao had tried to overrule the king and was dismissed. Sastri, too, was dominant and uncompromising as Madhava Rao and had frequent clashes with the king. Notwithstanding this strained relationship, Kerala Varma, the ruler of Cochin, wrote a letter to Seshayya Sastri warning him about the designs of Maharaja Ayilyam Thirunal but the letter fell into the hands of the Raja of Travancore.
In August 1877, Seshayya Sastri resigned as Diwan of Travancore and retired to Trichinopoly where he was appointed Vice-President and Secretary of the Mansion House Famine Relief Committee. In January 1878, Seshayya was nominated to the Madras Legislative Council and served till August 1878 when he took charge as the Diwan of Pudukkottai.
As Dewan of Pudukkottai.
In 1878, when Ramachandra Tondaiman was the ruler of Pudukkottai, Seshayya Sastri was appointed Dewan. He brought forth a number of reforms. He remodelled the town and rebuilt it incorporating modern principles of town planning. The Pudukkottai administrative office building was constructed during the tenure of Seshayya Sastri. The famous Pudukkulam Lake in Pudukkottai was a creation of Seshayya Sastri. Under Seshayya Sastri's advice, Ramachandra Tondaiman renovated many temples in the state. At the suggestion of his Tanjore-born wife, Ramachandra Tondaiman adopted the name "Brihadambaldas" with consent of Dewan Seshayya Sastri. 
In 1886, Ramachandra Tondaiman died and Martanda Bhairava Tondaiman, then a minor, succeeded to the throne of Pudukkottai. Seshayya Sastri, who was the Dewan, ruled Pudukkottai as Regent till Martanda Bhairava Tondaiman came of age. His tenure as dewan came to an end in 1894 and he returned to private life.
Later life.
In 1902, Seshayya Sastri was knighted for his services to the Crown. 
Seshayya Sastri died on October 29, 1903.
Honours.
Seshayya Sastri was made a fellow of the University of Madras in 1868 and on January 1, 1878, made a Companion of the Order of the Star of India in the New Year Honour's List. In 1901, Seshayya Sastri was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India in the King's Birthday Honour's List.

Rule complex

A rule complex is a set consisting of rules and/or other rule complexes. This is a generalization of a set of rules, and provides a tool to investigate and describe how rules can function as values, norms, judgmental or prescriptive rules, and meta-rules. Also possible is to examine objects consisting of rules such as roles, routines, algorithms, models of reality, social relationships, and institutions. In game theory, rules and rule complexes can be used to define the behavior and interactions of the players (although in generalized game theory, the rules are not necessarily static. Rule complexes are especially associated with sociologist Tom R. Burns and Anna Gomolinska and the Uppsala Theory Circle.
Formalization.
Rules.
In this setting, a rule is type of knowledge (in the sense of epistemic logic (see Fagin, 2003)) formalized as a set of premises or conditions, a set of justifications, and a set of conclusions (this may be written as a triple, a rule formula_1). Elements of "X" should hold, and of "Y" may hold. If "Y", the justifications, do not hold, then the rule cannot be applied. If "X", the premises, obtain and the justifications are not known to not apply, then the rule is applied, and formula_2 is concluded. If "X" and "Y" are empty, then the rule is axiomatic (a "fact" or unconditional directive). Thus, rules can be seen as the basic objects of knowledge.
Rule complex.
Formally, a rule complex is the class which contains all finite sets of rules, is closed under set-theoretical union and power set, and preserves inclusion:
This means that for rule complexes formula_8 and formula_7, formula_11 are also rule complexes. A complex formula_12 is a subcomplex of the complex formula_13 if formula_14 or formula_12 may be obtained from formula_13 by deleting some rules from formula_13 and/or redundant parentheses (Burns, 2005).

Georgia State Route 96

State Route 96 (SR 96) is a state highway that travels west-to-east through portions of Talbot, Taylor, Crawford, Peach, Houston, Twiggs, and Wilkinson counties in the west-central part of the U.S. state of Georgia. The route travels from its western terminus at US 80/SR 22/SR 41 in Geneva to its eastern terminus at US 441/SR 29 south of Irwinton.
The Geneva–Fort Valley segment is planned to be incorporated into the Fall Line Freeway, a long-distance route for commercial vehicles that is to travel from Columbus to Augusta. This segment may also be included as part of the proposed routing of Interstate 14 (I-14), an Interstate Highway that is planned to travel from Natchez, Mississippi to Augusta.
Route description.
The route runs east from Geneva to Junction City, both in Talbot County, to Butler and Reynolds in Taylor County. Still heading east, the route briefly traverses the southernmost corner of Crawford County before heading to Fort Valley in Peach County. Still in Peach County, the route then crosses I-75 and heads east into Houston County and through Warner Robins, and continues into Twiggs County, where it turns northeast. Before reaching Jeffersonville, the route crosses I-16, then turns in an easterly direction once more towards its eastern terminus.
Future.
The Fall Line Freeway, which begins from Columbus along US 80, is planned to follow SR 96 from Geneva to Fort Valley, where the freeway will then follow SR 49 and its connector to Byron, where it will then follow to Macon on Interstate 75 (I-75). This is also part of the route envisioned for the yet-to-be-constructed I-14 that will stretch from Louisiana or Mississippi to either Georgia or South Carolina.

Tom Chantrell

Tom Chantrell (born Thomas William Chantrell in Manchester on December 20, 1916 - July 15, 2001) was a British illustrator and film poster artist.
Biography.
The son of a trapeze artist, Chantrell was the youngest of nine children. He left Manchester Art College and went into advertising, eventually starting in 1933 at Allardyce Palmer who had accounts with Warner Brothers and 20th Century Fox. In 1938 he designed his first film poster "The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse". 
He continued with posters until World War II service with the Royal Engineers bomb disposal units. After demobilisation he returned to Allardyce Palmer eventually doing over 7,000 film posters.
Chantrell did not see the films he drew for; he would receive a plot line and a handful of stills and use friends and family for poses. Examples of this were taking photographs of himself trying to look like a vampire for "Dracula Has Risen from the Grave" and his wife Shirley held a plastic sword in the back garden to pose for Princess Leia on the original "Star Wars" poster. Chantrell's posters were often produced prior to the film being made in order to raise money from investors. 
Chantrell designed many posters for Hammer Films and the Carry On films. The latter brought him some trouble when the poster for "Carry On Spying" had to be changed to avoid looking too much like the Renato Fratini poster for "From Russia with Love" whilst the "Carry On Cleo" poster was pulled and redesigned after a lawsuit from 20th Century Fox that the send up looked too much like the original Howard Terpning "Cleopatra" artwork. 
In the 1960s Chantrell was often drawing artwork for 5 different films or double bills at one time.
With the move away from illustrated artwork for motion pictures, Chantrell designed covers for videos. 
Among films he designed the artwork for were "The King and I", "Von Ryan's Express", "One Million Years B.C.", "The Anniversary" and "".

The 2008–09 GP2 Asia Series season was the second season of the GP2 Asia Series. It began on 18 October 2008 and ended on 26 April 2009 and consisted of twelve races at six events. 
All teams from the 2008 GP2 Series season except for Racing Engineering took part in the competition, with the thirteenth slot being filled by Qi-Meritus Mahara. The reigning champion Romain Grosjean did not defend his title. Kamui Kobayashi clinched the title with a fourth place at the penultimate race in Bahrain.
Calendar.
On 12 July, GP2 Series organisers announced a provisional calendar for their second season. Unlike the first season of the GP2 Asia Series, this season will start prior to the new year, and be expanded to six events from the previous five. The Indonesian round has been dropped, while Bahrain earns a second event and Shanghai earns its first GP2 races. Shanghai will also host the official GP2 Asia Series test session prior to the start of the season.
The sprint race of the second round of the championship – at the Dubai Autodrome – was cancelled due to flooding. 
On 17 December, an alteration was made to the calendar, with the Losail International Circuit in Qatar replacing the February meeting in Dubai. The meeting was also moved to February 12–14 because the original date on the calendar was unsuitable, due to MotoGP testing. This event will also introduce night racing to GP2, following the circuit's lead with MotoGP and its support classes and also Formula One's night race in Singapore.
Championship standings.
Points are awarded to the top 8 classified finishers in the Feature race, and to the top 6 classified finishers in the Sprint race. The pole-sitter in the feature race will also receive two points, and one point is given to the driver who set the fastest lap inside the top ten in both the feature and sprint races. No extra points are awarded to the pole-sitter in the sprint race.
Points are awarded to the top 6 classified finishers.

Henry Formby

Henry Formby (born 1816; died at Normanton Hall, Leicester, 12 March 1884) was an English Roman Catholic priest and writer. 
Life.
Henry Formby was educated at Clitheroe grammar school, the Charterhouse School, London, and Brasenose College, Oxford, where he took his M. A. Having taken Anglican orders, he became vicar of Ruardean in Gloucestershire, where in 1843 he completed his first book, "A Visit to the East", and he showed the interest in ecclesiastical music that always characterized him in a pamphlet reprinted from "The English Churchman" called "Parochial Psalmody Considered" (1845). 
At this time he was profoundly influenced by the Oxford Movement, and soon after his friend John Henry Newman became a Catholic, he decided to resign his living and join the Catholic Church. His reception took place on 24 January 1846, at Oscott, where he continued studying theology till he was ordained priest, 18 September 1847.
He was attached to St. Chad's Cathedral.
Works.
He published three works on plain chant: 
He also published "The Young Singer's Book of Songs" (1852), "School Songs and Poetry to Which Music Is Adapted" (1852), and he was one of the editors of the "First Series of Hymns and Songs for the Use of Catholic Schools and Families" (1853). Other works belonging to this period were: "The Duties and Happiness of Domestic Service" (1851), "The March of Intellect; or, The Alleged Hostility of the Catholic Church to the Diffusion of Knowledge Examined" (1852), and "State Rationalism in Education; An Examination into the Actual Working and Results of the System of the Board of Commissioners of National Education in Ireland" (1854).
Besides his interest in ecclesiastical music, he published a series of illustrated books, including his "Pictorial Bible and Church History Stories", which began with "Pictorial Bible Stories for the Young" (1856). An edition of the complete work was published in 1857, followed by another in three volumes with new illustrations in 1862, and an abridged one-volume edition in 1871. 
From 1857 to 1864 he took charge of the mission at Wednesbury; during which time he published "The Fifteen Mysteries of the Rosary" (1857), "The Life of St. Benedict" (1858), "The Parables of Our Lord Jesus Christ" (1858), "The Life of St. Patrick" (1862), all of which were illustrated. A sermon on "Our Lady of Salette" (1857) and "The Inquiry of a Retired Citizen into the Truth of the Catholic Religion" (1863) were also published while he was at Wednesbury. 
In 1864 he retired from active missionary work and withdrew to the Dominican priory at Hinckley in Leicestershire, where he spent the remaining twenty years of his life in issuing books and pamphlets and in helping to train the novices; For some years he edited "The Monthly Magazine of the Holy Rosary". His later publications included: 
He also wrote other devotional and educational books and a recollection from a journey, printed in 1843, and called A Visit to the East.
Family.
His father, Henry Grenehalgh Formby, was the second son of Richard Formby of Formby Hall, Lancashire. The family had been Catholic until the eighteenth century, when, with the exception of a younger branch, they lost their faith and closed the chapel of their fifteenth-century mansion.

Condlae mac Cóelbad

Condlae mac Cóelbad (flourished later 5th century) was a Dal nAraide king in the time of Saint Patrick. He was the son of Cáelbad mac Cruind Ba Druí, a high king of Ireland and King of Ulster and brother of the previous Dal nAraide king Sárán mac Cóelbad.
His exact dates are unknown as he is only listed in king lists and not in the Irish annals. The Vita tripartita Sancti Patricii preserves the story that he received Patrick with humility and granted him Domnach Combair (Muckamore, County Antrim) for a church. As a result Patrick gave him and his descendants his blessing over those of Sárán who had violently opposed him.
Condlae's descendants the Uí Chóelbad would eventually dominate the kingship. His son Eochaid mac Condlai (died 553) was king of all Ulaid.

Arthur Galston

Arthur W. Galston (1920-2008) was an American botanist and bioethicist. As a graduate student, he identified the defoliant effects of a chemical the British military and the U.S. military later developed into Agent Orange which was employed extensively in Malaya and Vietnam. When chairman of Yale's botany department, his ethical objections led President Nixon to end its use.
Biography.
Galston grew up in a Jewish family in Brooklyn, impoverished during the depression. He was the youngest child of Hyman and Freda Galston. He abandoned his ambition for medical school, and enrolled at Cornell's Agricultural College because it was free. He could play saxophone to earn living espenses. Under the influence of a botany professor, he came to love botany, turned down admission to Cornell Veterinary School, and earned a B.S. in botany in 1940. University of Illinois offered him a teaching assistant position, so he took the bus to Champaign-Urbana, to study botany and biochemistry.
Galston's research and 1943 Ph.D. dissertation focused on finding a chemical means to make soybeans flower and fruit earlier. He discovered both that 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA) would speed up the flowering of soybeans and that in higher concentrations it would defoliate the soybeans.
The Imperial Japanese Army had captured most of the world's rubber plantations in British Malaya, and Caltech hired him for research on guyaule a plant substitute for rubber. The U.S. achieved success in synthetic rubber instead, and the project ended.
He was drafted into the U.S. Navy as an enlisted man and ultimately served as Natural Resources officer in Naval Military Government on Okinawa until his discharge in 1946.
In 1951, biological warfare scientists at Fort Detrick, Maryland began investigating defoliants based upon Galston's discoveries with TIBA, eventually producing the toxic defoliant Agent Orange used by the British Air Force during the Malayan Emergency and the U.S. Air Force during the Vietnam War. During this time, Galston taught as an associate professor at the California Institute of Technology before moving to Yale University where he taught from 1955 onwards.
Beginning in 1965, Galston lobbied both his scientific colleagues and the government to stop using Agent Orange. 
Galston and U.S. geneticist Matthew S. Meselson appealed to the U. S. Department of Defense to investigate the human toxicology of Agent Orange. The research conducted by the Department of Defense led to the discovery that Agent Orange caused birth defects in laboratory rats. In 1971 this information led to U.S. President Richard M. Nixon banning the use of the substance. Galston made numerous trips to Vietnam and China, including, with Ethan Signer of MIT, as the first American scientists invited to visit the People's Republic of China. In 1971, he met Chou En-lai, then Prime Minister, as well as King Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia, who then resided in Shanghai.
After his retirement as a biologist in 1990, he became affiliated with Yale's Institution for Social & Policy Studies, where he helped to found the Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics. He also taught bioethics to Yale undergraduates. In 2003-2004 his introductory bioethics course attracted 460 students, making it one of the most popular courses in Yale College.
Galston authored more than 300 papers on plant physiology and co-edited two books on bioethics.
He also co-founded the Gray Is Green: The National Senior Conservation Corps, a non-profit organization dedicated to helping older Americans lead more sustainable lives.
Galston died on June 15, 2008, in Hamden, Connecticut.

<doc id="18417537" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18417537" title="Bavarian G 5/5">
Bavarian G 5/5

The Bavarian G 5/5 goods train, steam locomotives were intended for steep stretches of line belonging to the Royal Bavarian State Railways ("Königlich Bayerische Staatsbahn") network in northern Bavaria. The extremely sharp rise in the levels of traffic on these lines in the years leading up to the First World War meant that the eight-coupled Bavarian E I and G 4/5 N classes previously employed there were increasingly unable to cope.
The first 15 examples were built in 1911 by Maffei. The G 5/5 was the first Bavarian goods train locomotive to be built with a superheater and four-cylinder compound engine. It acquitted itself well in practice and achieved very good consumption figures. As a result, a further 80, more powerful, engines were procured from 1920 to 1924. 
The Bavarian G 5/5 was the most powerful, ten-coupled locomotive of all the German state railways ("Länderbahnen"). In this respect it was far superior to the Prussian G 10 and even the Prussian G 12 was unable to match it.
Of the first series, the seven remaining examples left after the First World War and the associated reparations were taken over by the Deutsche Reichsbahn, being renumbered as 57 501–507. The 80 engines from the follow-on order went straight into the Bavarian Group Administration of the Reichsbahn and were later allocated operating numbers 57 511–590. 
In 1930, as a consequence of the worldwide economic crisis, former "Länderbahn" freight locomotives were increasingly retired even if they had not reached their full service life. In addition to antiquated Prussian classes such as the G 4 and G 5, large numbers of clearly much newer locomotives of south German manufacture were withdrawn. How much the "Berlin veto" ("Bannstrahl") of the Reichsbahn's Chief Mechanical Engineer, Richard Paul Wagner, was responsible, is difficult to say at this distance, but it was very probably a major factor.
In addition to the 57.5, this also affected the Bavarian 56.8, as well as ex-Baden (e.g. the Baden VIII e), ex-Württemberg (e.g. the Württemberg H and HH) and ex-Saxon (e.g. the Saxon XI V, XI H and XI HV). 
Increasing electrification of the south German railway network and the low numbers of some engine classes also played their part. Transferring the complex and demanding south German machines to depots in the north was out of the question, despite their relative newness. In addition, enough new or relatively new Prussian locomotives were already available there.
At the end of the Second World War 20 vehicles remained in service. Most of them were retired by 1947 with war damage; some survived in the Deutsche Bundesbahn until 1950 as a splinter group.

JANUS clinical trial data repository

Janus clinical trial data repository is a clinical trial data repository (or data warehouse) standard as sanctioned by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It was named for the Roman god Janus (mythology), who had two faces, one that could see in the past and one that could see in the future. The analogy is that the Janus data repository would enable the FDA and the pharmaceutical industry to both look retrospectively into past clinical trials, and also relative to one or more current clinical trials (or even future clinical trials thru better enablement of clinical trial design).
The Janus data model is a relational database model, and is based on SDTM as a standard, in terms of many of its basic concepts such as the loading and storing of findings, events, interventions and inclusion data. However, Janus itself is a data warehouse independent of any single clinical trials submission standard. For example, Janus can store pre-clinical trial (non-human) submission information as well, in the form of the SEND non-clinical standard.
The goals of Janus are as follows:

Hindustani people

Hindustani people "(People of Hindustan)," also known as Hindavi "(People of Hind)" are a panethnicity primarily living in the Hind Region of India also known as the Hindi belt, which is located in the Gangetic Plain of North India, between the Himalayas and the Vindhyas. They are identified as such on one or more of genealogical, linguistic, or cultural grounds. Traditionally, Hindustani or Hindavi identity is primarily cultural, with Hindustanis or Hindavis being those who the Hindi Language with any variety of Hindi is their prime language — mainly residing in present day Indian States of Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Haryana & Delhi. in other words the Hindi belt. The Hindustani or Hindavi People seems to be of ethnolinguistic in origin rather than as an ethnic group but certain Indo-Aryan ethnic groups are identified as Hindustani people. 
If the diverse Hindustani pan-ethnicity is regarded as a single ethnic group, then it constitutes one of the world's largest.
Present circumstances.
Although the word "Hindustani" refers to people, it is historically important to understand the complex history, culture, ethos & demography of India. Certain groups of Hindustani people are identified with multiple identities, with a more localized prioritized ethnic orientation, for example, Haryanvi people, Avadhi people, Malvi people, Himachali people, Rajasthani people, in addition to further tribal, village,and/or religious identities
However, whenever used, it is used to generally denote persons, whose native language is variety of Hindi and belong to certain parts of north India ( i.e. Hindi belt ). Hindi, the main unifying feature among Hindavis, is an Indo Aryan language of Sanskrit heritage originating in ancient India. In the present day, Hindustani people are generally identified with the Hindi-speaking population of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and also the Hindi-speaking people of Bihar and Jharkhand. The use of the word "Hindustani people" in general & in the media is becoming scarce in 21st century.
Use of term in media and culture.
The word Hindustani people is used in many patriotic songs and films, made during British rule in India and even after independence, wherein it implies to persons belonging to India or Hindustan as a whole and not restricted to imply only persons of Hindi belt.
One famous film implying the above definition, was "Hum Hindustani" made in 1960 and another was "Hum Hindustani" (Television Serial) directed by Hrishikesh Mukherjee in 1986.
The word "Hindustani people" is also used in a national sense, when used in broad sense with culture, heritage and the customs of Hindustan.
Surname.
Hindustani & Hindavi is also found to be used by many people from North India, especially from Uttar Pradesh as their Surname. The surname is also found among persons of Indian origin, who had migrated out of India, during last two centuries.
One famous use of word Hindustani as Surname in media was in film Raja Hindustani, where lead role was known by this name.

Carpobrotus rossii

Carpobrotus rossii, commonly known as karkalla or pig face ("Western Australia"), is a succulent coastal groundcover plant native to southern Australia.
Karkalla leaves are succulent, long and wide, and curved or rarely straight. The flowers are light purple in colour, and wide. The globular purplish red fruit is about long and wide.
Distribution.
The species occurs in the states of Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania and Victoria. 
It can be found year-round in large patches covering sand dunes close to the ocean, due to its hardy nature and salt resistance.
Uses.
Aboriginal people eat the fruit traditionally, fresh and dried. The salty leaves were also reported to have been eaten with meat.
Extracts of the plant have significant "in vitro" antioxidant, antiplatelet, and anti-inflammatory activity.

Fraserburgh railway station

Fraserburgh railway station is a former railway station that once served the town of Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire. It formed a junction where two lines met, the main line from the south terminated here, where it was joined by a small coastal branch line from St Combs (which opened in 1903). It is now closed, and the site has been redeveloped. The GNSR engine shed and BR goods offices remain in alternative uses.
Fraserburgh railway station opened in 1865 and closed to passengers in 1965. The railway line was built by the Formartine and Buchan Railway Company, which became part of the Great North of Scotland Railway. In 1923 the GNSR was incorporated into the London and North Eastern Railway, which was in turn nationalised on 1 January 1948. Passenger services on the Buchan lines were withdrawn in 1965 as part of the Beeching cuts. Freight trains continued to operate Fraserburgh until 1979. The track was subsequently lifted.

Standard for Exchange of Non-clinical Data

SEND, or the Standard for Exchange of Nonclinical Data, is an implementation of the CDISC Standard Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) for nonclinical studies, which specifies a way to present nonclinical data in a consistent format. These types of studies are typically related to animal testing as part of pre-clinical (pre-Phase 1) clinical trials.
Having a common model to which the industry can conform enables benefits such as the ability for vendors to develop tools, for interorganizational data exchange that is consistent in format regardless of the parties involved, and so on.
A SEND package consists of a few parts, but the main focus is on individual endpoint data. Endpoints typically map to domains (essentially, datasets), with a number of variables (a.k.a., columns or fields). The SEND Implementation Guide (SENDIG) is a document that provides implementers with specifications for implementing SEND, including how to model various nonclinical endpoints, rules to doing so, and examples with sample data.
The SEND Implementation Wiki is a wiki hosted by PhUSE designed to assist with the implementation process, most notably containing:
History.
The work on this standard began in July 2002—subsequently, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration pilot project was initiated in July 2003 through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA). Feedback from this pilot and continuous efforts to more closely align this implementation with the SDTM for human clinical trials led to development of SEND 2.3, but without widespread adoption.
In 2006, with renewed FDA interest, the industry met to revive SEND and work on a version that, with FDA backing, would cover regulatory submission as well as operational data transfer needs. By 2007, an FDA pilot was announced, during which time the SEND team worked on the SENDIG (implementation guide).
SENDIG 3.0 was released to production in July 2011. This was soon followed by the FDA's statement of preference for SEND datasets.

Lily Mazahery

Lily Mazahery (born October 10, 1972) is an Iranian-American lawyer (suspended), formerly a human rights activist, and a source on Iran. She is principal of Mazahery Law Firm and the founder and president of Legal Rights Institute (LRI), a non-governmental organization (NGO).
Overview.
Mazahery received her Juris Doctor in 1999 and was admitted to the District of Columbia bar on December 2, 2002. Her license to practice law was suspended on November 16, 2011 due to claims of disability. She is also pending disciplinary before the DC Court of Appeals on the basis of misrepresenting prominent human rights victims, including Ahmad Batebi. An Ad Hoc Committee of the DC Court of Appeals has so far recommended that she be disbarred.
Prior to her suspension, Mazahery's practice primarily focused on immigration law. She assisted individuals who had been victims of human rights violations in Iran and other countries in North Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Mazahery also advocated for equal rights for women in Islamic countries, including the abolishment of stoning as a form of execution and honour killings.
Advocacy.
Prior to the suspension of her law license, Mazahery worked on women's rights issues and their violation by oppressive regimes, notably women and girls who have been unjustly placed on death row in Islamic countries. She was selected as a celebrity judge for HAMSA's The "Dream Deferred" essay contest on Civil Rights in the Middle East along with feminist Gloria Steinem, and Dr. Azar Nafisi, author of "Reading Lolita in Tehran" and a professor at Johns Hopkins University. Mazahery has, however, been the subject of controversy. Specifically, an Ad Hoc Committee of a DC Court of Appeals found that Mazahery had failed to properly handle donations that were provided to her to assist Akram Mahdavi, a woman on death row in Iran.
Mazahery has also publicly opposed Islamic Law, Sharia and particularly stoning for executions, which are carried out in certain countries that observe Sharia, including in the Islamic Republic of Iran. In a speech delivered to members of the United States Congress in 2006, Mazahery provided a description of stoning executions. In the same speech, Mazahery condemned Iran's government for committing a variety of inhumane acts against its own people, and called upon American lawmakers to take "immediate and concrete steps" that would force Iranian officials to permanently ban stoning executions.
Mazahery has been an opponent of human rights violations in Iran. In various public speaking engagements, Mazahery specifically identified Iran's president, Ahmadinejad, for blatant disregard of international human rights treaties to which Iran is a signatory and demanded international action to stop the violations. She publicly opposed Iran's clerical regime and Mohammad Khatami, the former president of Iran. In 2006, she publicly opposed Khatami's speech at Harvard University. In September 2008, at the same time that Ahmadinejad was scheduled to speak at the United Nations headquarters, Mazahery spoke as an expert source on Iran in a number of venues in New York and Washington DC, including before a panel in the United States Congress. 
In Spring 2008, Mazahery helped Iranian dissident Ahmad Batebi flee Iran for the U.S., where he was granted political asylum.
She also led panels at the World Technology Summit in New York City in 2009 and 2010 about the usage of technology to promote democracy and human rights by activists living under the rule of oppressive regimes.
Acknowledgement.
In her most recent book, ""One Can Make A Difference: Original stories by the Dalai Lama, Paul McCartney, Willie Nelson, Dennis Kucinich, Russel Simmons, Brigitte Bardot and Dozens of Other Extraordinary Indiv.iduals"" PETA founder and president, Ingrid Newkirk, included a chapter on Mazahery's work on behalf of Iranian women who were persecuted based on their gender, including some who had been sentenced to execution by stoning on charges of adultery. In a November 2008 interview, Newkirk was asked whether she favored any particular essay over others in her new book. She responded with the following explanation:
I think the one by Lily Mazahery — an essay on Iranian women who are stoned to death or buried alive for being in the company of a man or even a boy and suspected of having had a sexual intercourse. She’s helping them enormously from her daily work in Washington, D.C. Instead of just going about her daily work, she has carved a lifeline for these women and literally tries her very best to save their lives with what she does.
Suspension of License to Practice Law.
On September 15, 2011, an Ad Hoc Hearing Committee of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, Board of Professional Responsibility, issued an opinion finding that that Mazahery had committed "multiple acts of dishonesty and even criminal conduct." The opinion related to allegations of misconduct stemming from Mazahery's representation of human rights advocates Ahmad Batebi and Kianoosh Sanjari and mishandling of funds relating to execution of Akram Mahdavi. The Hearing Committee held that Mazahery committed 23 violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct and recommended that she be disbarred. The ruling included one dissenting opinion which believed that Mazahery should not be disbarred but that her bar membership should be suspended for three years. On November 16, 2011, Mazahery's bar membership was suspended on an interim basis pursuant to D.C. Bar R. XI, § 13(e), which holds that "if in the course of a disciplinary proceeding, the attorney claims to be suffering from a disability because of mental or physical illness or infirmity, or because of addiction to drugs or intoxicants, which makes it impossible for the attorney to present an adequate defense, the Court shall enter an order immediately suspending the attorney from the practice of law until a determination is made of the attorney's capacity to practice law in a proceeding under subsection (c) of this section., claim of disability by attorney." As a result of the suspension, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals has not ruled on the Ad Hoc Committee's recommendation.
