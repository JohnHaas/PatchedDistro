Sussex Manifesto

The Sussex Manifesto was a report on science and technology for development written at the request of the United Nations and published in 1970.
History.
In the late 1960s the United Nations asked for recommendations on science and technology for development from a team of academics at the Institute of Development Studies (IDS) and SPRU Science and Technology Policy Research (formerly called Science Policy Research Unit) at the University of Sussex, UK. This team became known as the Sussex Group and their report, "Science and Technology to Developing Countries during the Second Development Decade", became known as the "Sussex Manifesto".
The "Sussex Manifesto" was intended as the introductory chapter to the "UN World Plan of Action on Science and Technology for Development". But the solutions presented in the Manifesto were deemed too radical to be used for that purpose. It was instead published in 1970 as an annex in "Science and Technology for Development: Proposals for the Second United Nations Development Decade", a UN report by the Advisory Committee on the Application of Science and Technology to Development (ACAST).
The "Sussex Manifesto" helped raise awareness of science and technology for development in UN circles influenced the design of development institutions and was used for teaching courses in both North and South universities.
The Sussex Group were Hans Singer (Chairman), Charles Cooper (Secretary), R.C. Desai, Christopher Freeman, Oscar Gish, Stephen Hill and Geoffrey Oldham.
Today.
In 2008 one of the authors of the original report Professor Geoff Oldham gave a seminar at the STEPS Centre – a research centre and policy engagement based at IDS and SPRU. Following this event the STEPS Centre decided to create a new manifesto in association its partners around the world and Professor Oldham. The new publication, "Innovation, Sustainability, Development: A New Manifesto", was launched in 2010, forty years after the original.
The New Manifesto has also been translated into Chinese, French, Portuguese and Spanish. 
The STEPS Centre is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC).

If You Ever See an Owl...

If You Ever See an Owl... is the first album by The Terrible Twos, a children's music alter-ego of The New Amsterdams.
History.
In 2005 after The Get Up Kids split up, lead singer Matt Pryor turned his focus on his other band The New Amsterdams and, primarily, his children. The main reason The Get Up Kids split up was due to Pryor's disenfranchisement with touring, and his desire to spend more time with his children. As he spent more time with them, he began writing children's songs. Eventually, he showed them to his bandmates, and they decided to perform them. Pryor's goal was to create music that would engage children, but entertain their parents as well. Eventually, they recorded their first album, "If You Ever See an Owl...". After the album was complete, however, it was not released immediately due to the band members focusing on The New Amsterdams. Alongside this, they wanted artist and friend Travis Miller to illustrate a storybook to be packaged with the album. Finally, in 2005 the album was released independently, then re-released on Vagrant Records in 2007.

.475 Nitro Express

The .475 Nitro Express is a British rifle cartridge.
One of several rounds (including the .470, .475 No. 2, and .476) designed and introduced between 1905 and 1910, after the British Army banned the .450, all with comparable performance, the .475 was intended for both single and double rifles.
A good general purpose round, it is suitable for all big game, and was preferred by experienced hunters for elephant, lion, or Cape buffalo at close range, though somewhat more than needed for anything in North America. Its performance is little different from the others, and its ballistics resemble the .458 Winchester Magnum, with a larger diameter bullet; whether this is an advantage remains in dispute. 
The weight and bulk of the rifle and ammunition have made the round less attractive in the face of smaller calibers with performance approaching the .475's, and slugs for handloading it are only available from Britain (though Fred N. Barnes did offer a 600 gr {38.9 g} variety at one time), and the Berdan primer militates against this, as well.
Two or three wildcats have been based on the .475. The factory load used 75 gr (4.86 g) of cordite over a 480 gr (31.1 g) slug; 70 gr (4.54 g) of 3031 will duplicate the factory ballistics.

Westby-with-Plumptons

Westby-with-Plumptons is a civil parish in Lancashire, North West England. The parish is in Fylde district and contains the hamlets of Great Plumpton, Little Plumpton, Lower Ballam, Higher Ballam, Moss Side (formerly "Brown Moss Side"), Peel, and Westby. As of the 2001 census, the parish had a population of 1,107. Westby and Plumpton were both mentioned in the Domesday Book, as ""Westbi"" and ""Pluntun"".
Westby-with-Plumptons is part of the Warton and Westby ward, which is represented by three councillors on Fylde Borough Council On Lancashire County Council it is part of Fylde West ward, which elects one councillor.
The parish is generally low-lying, with arable land in the south and pasture in the north, which rises to above sea level at Great Plumpton in the north-east of the parish.
The railway from Preston to Blackpool South runs through the parish, with one station in the parish, at Moss Side where the railway crosses the B5259 Lytham to Kirkham road at a level crossing.
The parish is now the home of the steel farm-building construction company J. Wareing & Son (Wrea Green) Ltd [http://www.wareingbuildings.co.uk], which was for many years based in the neighbouring village of Wrea Green.
St. Anne's Church.
Westby is notable for the fine Catholic church of St. Anne's, designed by E. W. Pugin and built in 1860.
The conventional church exterior does not prepare the visitor for the striking interior with its elaborate timber roof [http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/466357]. Above the altar the timbers follow the apse and form a frame or focal point. At the west end is a gallery.
Despite the unusual shape of the nave windows, the stained glass is largely unspectacular. But two of the windows are noteworthy - the Pre-Raphaelite styled "St Cecilia" in a green gown, with roses in the cusps, and the "Millennium" window with its inscription.

Christy Moylan

Christy Moylan (1916-?) was an Irish sportsperson. He played hurling with his local club Dungarvan and with the Waterford senior inter-county team from 1935 until 1949.
Playing career.
Club.
Moylan played his club hurling with his local club in Dungarvan and enjoyed some success. He won a senior county title with the club in 1941. This was Dungarvan’s last victory in the county championship.
Inter-county.
Moylan first came to prominence on the inter-county scene with Waterford in the1930s. He made his senior debut with the team in 1935, however, Waterford were regarded as the ‘sick men’ of Munster hurling because the team had never won a provincial title. 
All this changed in 1938 when Moylan lined out in his first Munster final. Surprisingly, the game saw Clare providing the opposition. In a close game Waterford emerged as the victors on a score line of 3-5 to 2-5. Not only was it Moylan’s first Munster medal but it was also the first time that Waterford had won the provincial title. Waterford later accounted for Galway allowing Moylan’s side to advance to their first-ever All-Ireland final. Dublin provided the opposition on that occasion and the game turned out to be a good one. Declan Goode scored a goal for the Decies after just six minutes, however, Dublin fought back with goals of their own. Eventually, victory went to ‘the Dubs’ on a score line of 2-5 to 1-6.
Waterford went into decline following this defeat. A two-point loss to Cork in the Munster final of 1943 was the only high point for Moylan. 
In 1948, then years after their first provincial title, Waterford were back in the Munster final. Cork, the outstanding team of the decade, provided the opposition on that occasion and another exciting game followed. Waterford emerged victorious on a score line of 4-7 to 3-9 giving Moylan his second Munster medal. Galway fell again in the penultimate game of the championship, allowing Waterford to advance to the All-Ireland final. Just like ten years previous Dublin provided the opposition. Once again Waterford got off to a good start and led by nine points at half-time. Four goals followed in the second-half courtesy of John Keane, Willie Galvin, Eddie Daly and Moylan. Waterford won on a score line of 6-7 to 4-2 giving Moylan his first All-Ireland medal.
Moylan continued playing in 1949, however, Waterford surrendered their provincial and All-Ireland crowns at the first hurdle. Moylan retired from inter-county hurling following this defeat.
Provincial.
Moylan also lined out with Munster in the inter-provincial hurling competition and enjoyed much success. He first lined out for his province in 1937 and captured his first Railway Cup medal in 1937. It was the first of four inter-provincial titles in-a-row. Moylan won his fifth and final Railway Cup medal in 1942.
Post-playing career.
In retirement from playing Moylan maintained a keen interest in the game as he came to be regarded as one of the great players of his generation. Long after his playing days were over his brilliance as a player was recognised when he was the recipient of the prestigious GAA All-Time All-Star award. Past winners of the award included Mick Mackey, Jack Lynch and Jim Langton.

<doc id="18483087" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18483087" title="Pinisi">
Pinisi

The pinisi or phinisi is a traditional Indonesian two-masted sailing ship. It was mainly built by the Konjo tribe, a sub-ethnic group of Bugis-Makassar mostly residents at the Bulukumba regency of South Sulawesi but was, and still is used widely by the Buginese and Makassarese, mostly for inter-insular transportation, cargo and fishing purposes within Indonesian archipelago.
General description.
The hull of the ships looks similar to that of a dhow while the fore-and-aft rigging reminds of western schooners, although it might be more correctly termed to resemble a ketch, as the front mast is the larger.
The large mainsails differ from western style gaff rigs though, as they often do not have a boom and the sail is not lowered with the gaff. Instead it is reefed towards the mast, much like a curtain, thus allowing the gaff to be used as deck crane in the harbour. The lower part of the mast itself may resemble a tripod or is made of two poles.
Pinisi may be 20 to 35 meters long and 350 tons in size. The masts may reach to 30 meters above the deck.
Types of pinisi.
There are two general types of Pinisi. 
History.
The first pinisi ships are said to have been built after the example of the Dutch "pinas" (pinnace) introduced to the region by the V.O.C. around 1600. 
These probably carried lateen or other type of sails, as the modern schooner rig did not become prominent before the 19th century.
Traditional Buginese lontara manuscripts and stories document the use of pinisi by Buginese for transport, as a sailing boat, and a warship.
During the alliance with the Dutch colonialists, pinisis were mainly used as trade ships, transports, and for fishing. Some sources say that at the time of the Indonesian National Awakening pinisi were used by Buginese and people of Sulawesi as warships during the Indonesian struggle for independence.
Design and construction.
Several parts of the pinisi are referred to by their original Buginese names, such as:
1. Anjong, (balancing triangle) located at the front deck (Anjungan)
2. Sombala (main sail) the largest sail in the ship 
3. Tanpasere (small sail) triangle-shaped, located at each mast
4. Cocoro pantara (front additional sail).
5. Cocoro tangnga (middle additional sail)
6. Tarengke (row additional sail))
7. etc.
Modern use.
Today, pinisi mainly used for trade, serves as inter-insular cargo, such as to transport timber from Kalimantan to Java, in exchange to transporting grocery and goods from industrialized Java to more remote ports in Indonesian archipelago. Pinisi often frequent traditional ports, such as Sunda Kelapa port in Jakarta, Surabaya, Banjarmasin, and the port of Makassar.
As with many traditional ship types, pinisi have been provided with motors, largely since 1970. This has changed the appearance of the ships. Comparable to modern dhows, the masts have been shortened, or omitted as deck cranes vanished completely, while structures on deck, usually aft, have been enlarged for the crew and passengers.
The pinisi is modified into diving charter boat by foreigner investors for tourism purpose.

Elizabeth Shepherd (musician)

Elizabeth Shepherd is a Canadian, Montreal-based singer, songwriter, pianist, arranger and producer. Along with artists such as Esperanza Spalding and Jose James, she is often credited with invigorating and reinventing the jazz song and bringing jazz influenced music to a younger audience. "Real Detroit Weekly" called her "a jazz virtuoso blessed with a pop sensibility", while "The London Evening Standard" described her as an "insightful singer/songwriter of evident talent and originality". 
Shepherd arrived on the international jazz scene when her debut album, "Start to Move", was voted among the Top 3 jazz albums of 2006 by the listeners of "The Gilles Peterson Show" on BBC Radio 1. This collection of mostly original material was nominated for a Juno award (Canada's Grammy equivalent) in 2007. 
Although "Start to Move" would be found in the jazz section at your local music shop, Elizabeth’s blend of jazz-funk, soul, blues and samba reaches far beyond just the jazz massive. "Besides" is a collection of dancefloor remixes, b sides, exclusives and unreleased gems designed to appeal to all music lovers.
Shepherd's second album of new music "Parkdale", released in May 2008, deals sympathetically with its Toronto neighbourhood namesake, which is known for its grit. The album, produced by London-based producer/DJ Nostalgia 77, was also nominated for a Juno award in 2009. 
Shepherd's 2010 release, "Heavy Falls the Night" featured only one cover song: a reworking of the 1970s soft-rock radio staple "Danny's Song". Shepherd produced the album herself, with the exception of the first single "Seven Bucks", which was co-produced by Japanese DJ Mitsu the Beats and climbed up to #37 on the "Tokio Hot 100" chart. The record was praised by jazz and pop critics alike, and was long listed for the 2010 Polaris Music Prize, Canada's most prestigious popular music prize.
2012 brought Shepherd several changes, not the least of which was news that she and her husband Johan were expecting their first child. As she wrote in the liner notes of her most recent record "Rewind", "the fears and anticipation surrounding imminent motherhood were largely the impetus to make this record. I knew I needed to keep myself busy during pregnancy, and I knew I had to make something that would connect me to an aspect of myself that "wasn't" changing as every other piece of my being was." The album, all cover tunes ranging from composers such as Cole Porter and Gershwin Bros. to Kurt Weill and Jose Luis Perales, is dedicated to her daughter Sanna, and is nominated for the 2012 Vocal Jazz Juno award. 
Biography.
Raised by ministers of the Salvation Army, Shepherd had early exposure to choirs and brass bands. Trained extensively in conservatories, Shepherd completed a degree in jazz piano from McGill University. She initially entered the music program to pursue a career in music therapy, turning later to songwriting and performing. She returned to Toronto in 2004 and worked as a server at a piano bar. She became the restaurant’s key entertainer and formed a trio with Scott Kemp on bass and Colin Kingsmore on drums.
Shepherd has sold out jazz clubs across the world, from Tokyo's Cotton Club to Detroit's Cliff Bell's. She has also appeared at festivals on both sides of the Atlantic, including Montreal Jazz Festival and the North Sea Jazz Festival. In 2009, she was personally invited by British souljazz star Jamie Cullum to open for him at a sold-out show at the Hollywood Bowl.
Shepherd has appeared and performed live on many radio shows, including "The Gilles Peterson Show" on BBC Radio 1 (UK), J-Wave's Modaista (Japan) and Q with Jian Ghomeshi on CBC Radio (Canada).

Stitcher Radio

Stitcher is an on-demand internet radio service that focuses on news and information radio and podcasts. It provides free online streaming through the website and also using native mobile applications such as the iPhone, Android, BlackBerry and Palm webOS. The company was founded in 2008 and is privately held and venture backed. 
Stitcher aggregates content from thousands of content providers and organizes the content into "stations" that listeners can browse and listen to. Audio content is delivered from large media providers such as NPR, CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, BBC, AP, TechCrunch and thousands of smaller providers. Content is kept continually up to date via Stitcher's proprietary back-end application, allowing listeners to have access to fresh content while on the go without having to sync their mobile device. However, this access may require costly usage of mobile data in contrast to true podcasts which can be synced through WiFi Internet access and listened to "on the go."
Usage and Features.
Stitcher simplifies the consumption of podcasts by eliminating the need to synchronize content to a device. Content is instead streamed to listener's phones on-demand. Stitcher 3.0 for the iPhone (released in December 2009) introduced live streaming to the app, which allowed users to select on-demand shows and live streamed talk-radio programming.
A user can add shows to their favorites station using the “Add to Favorites” button. iPhone users can choose to receive SMS updates when their favorite shows are updated. When new content becomes available, Stitcher will send an email message to a user alerting them that the show was updated along with a direct-play link.
Stitcher offers an Editor's Picks station that provides listeners access to the content editor’s favorite shows.
Stitcher offers stations targeted to specific local audiences.
Customization.
The application provides personalization via a "favoriting" scheme, where listeners can favorite content they like; Stitcher will then aggregate this content in the listener's favorite station. Stitcher also uses a proprietary customization algorithm to order stations according to a user's listening habits.
The personalization algorithm influences which audio shows are recommended to the user. It draws on data such as listening patterns to personalize the content of each station according to the listener's interests and gains more knowledge about the listener over time. Listeners can also "stitch" together a personalized list of their favorite shows.
The customization has been compared to Pandora by CNET, who wrote that Stitcher "is to news and information what Pandora is to music."
Stitcher and Internet Radio in cars.
At the 2010 Consumer Electronics Show, Ford Motor Company CEO Alan Mulally announced a partnership between Ford, Stitcher, Pandora and a Twitter client called OpenBeak that would bring internet radio into Ford vehicles. 
Following this announcement, General Motors has also announced partnerships with Stitcher and Pandora.
Awards and honors.
Stitcher has received numerous awards for its services:
Stitcher has been featured several times by Apple in the App Store and has been designated as an Apple Staff Pick. It was featured once by Palm in the App Catalog.
Platform Support.
Stitcher is currently available on the iPhone, iPad, Android, and WebOS devices. In addition to mobile clients, Stitcher is also available on the Sonos platform.
Stitcher was first introduced to Apple App Store in August 2008, as Stitcher made the native app available in private beta to 100 testers. The native app provided the same interface as the web application along with features such as automatic updates and "interrupt handling" during phone calls.

Four penny coffin

The four penny coffin (also referred to as a coffin house) is a Victorian term that described one of the first homeless shelters to be created for the people of central London. It was operated by the Salvation Army during the late 19th and early 20th centuries to provide comfort and aid to its destitute clients. 
The Salvation Army operated other homeless shelters in the area. These shelters charged the clients different amounts depending on the amenities offered. At the low end was a penny sit-up, where a homeless client could get food and shelter from the cold in exchange for a penny. He was allowed to sit on a bench all night, but was not allowed to sleep. For an additional penny, there was the "two penny hangover". It was like a penny sit-up except that a rope was placed in front of the bench. The client was allowed to sleep when he leaned on (or hung over) the rope during the night. He was not allowed to lie down flat on his back and sleep. The rope was cut at daybreak in order to encourage the clients to wake up early and leave. For four pennies, a homeless client could stay at a coffin house. He received food and shelter. Moreover, he was allowed to lie down flat on his back and sleep in a coffin shaped wooden box. A client was given a tarpaulin for covering. What made this unique is that it was the cheapest homeless shelter in London at that time that allowed its clients to lie down on their back and sleep. The Salvation Army also offered shelters that allowed its clients to sleep on a bed for a much higher price. Hence, the coffin house was popular because it offered an economical and midrange solution for homeless clients looking for relief from the cold.
Compared with modern examples this shelter in London is considered inadequate for these individuals. It was however considered an inexpensive and compassionate attempt to deal with the relatively new problem of homelessness. This shelter provided relief from the harsh London winters and was viewed by many at the time as having the benefit of attracting new followers to the Christian faith.

Luckley-Oakfield School

Luckley-Oakfield School is a private day and boarding school for girls in Berkshire in England. It has a community of about 250 girls, with about 200 pupils in the first five year groups, and 50 girls in the Sixth Form. The school is set in a rural location, south of the historic market town of Wokingham.
History.
Luckley School, founded in 1918, has always occupied its present site. The main house, which dates from 1907, replaced Luckley Manor, an ancient property mentioned in the Domesday Book. Oakfield School was established in the Lake District in 1895. The two schools were amalgamated on the Wokingham site in 1959 as an independent educational trust regulated by the Charity Commissioners.
House system.
There are four houses at Luckley: Beatty (red), Nelson (blue), Drake (green), Jellicoe (yellow).
There are house events throughout the year, which include the annual Christmas Cracker Drama event, Sports Day, Swimming Gala, Junior and Senior Rounders, Tennis, Netball, Badminton, Hockey, and the House Music Competition. Each event contributes points towards the end of year House Cup and the winners go on a House outing at the end of the summer term. 
On an ongoing basis the four houses are expected to devise community service events or fundraisers to include as many house members as possible. The project has to be co-ordinated and promoted by the girls. House Captains and deputies are also responsible for liaising with staff about transport and guidance, as well as building links with staff at the places that they are supporting.

Illinois Intercollegiate Athletic Conference

The Illinois Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (IIAC) was a college athletic conference that existed from 1908 to 1970 in the United States.
History.
At one time the IIAC was a robust league that claimed most of the Illinois institutions of higher education. It was nicknamed the "Little Nineteen," but in 1928 had a membership of 23 schools. Former Illinois State University track coach Joe Cogdal, associated with the IIAC for 43 years of its 62-year history, noted that the league had roots in the 1870s when a number of schools banded together for oratorical contests. Their first intercollegiate football game was played in 1881 between Illinois State University and Knox College, and by 1894 a football association was established. 
The IIAC was formed in April 1908 with eight charter members: Illinois State University, Illinois Wesleyan University, Bradley University, Millikin University, Monmouth College, Knox College, Lombard College and Illinois College. The first track meet was held on May 22, 1908. The group quickly expanded. Eastern Illinois University and Western Illinois University joined in 1912 and 1915 respectively. 
In 1920, the name "Illinois Intercollegiate Athletic Conference" was adopted, providing the initials IIAC. Conference membership reached a peak of 23 member schools in 1928, when virtually all of the small colleges in Illinois were included. 
Private schools withdrew during much of the 1930s, until in 1942 only the five state schools remained: Illinois State University, Eastern Illinois University, Northern Illinois University, Southern Illinois University Carbondale and Western Illinois University. In 1950, the league name became the Interstate Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, when Central Michigan University and Eastern Michigan University brought the membership to seven. In 1961, Eastern Michigan University and Southern Illinois University Carbondale withdrew; Northern Illinois University followed in 1966. The conference disbanded at the end of the 1969–1970 academic year.

The .475 No. 2 Nitro Express is a British rifle cartridge.
One of several rounds (including the .470, .475, and .476 Nitro Express) designed and introduced between 1905 and 1910, after the British Army banned the .450, in India and the Sudan, all with comparable performance, the .475 No. 2 was used in a number of double rifles. In addition, Jeffery chambered a slightly less powerful loading in his rifles.
A good general purpose round, it is suitable for all big game. Its power is almost identical to the .458 Winchester Magnum, with a larger diameter bullet; whether this is an advantage remains in dispute. 
The standard factory load used a 480 gr (31.1 g) slug over 85 gr (5.51 g) of cordite, while Jeffery used a 500 gr (32.4 g) bullet which dropped 0.6 in (15 mm) more at 200 yd (180 m).

Samantha Bumgarner

"Aunt" Samantha Bumgarner (October 31, 1878 - December 24, 1960) was an acclaimed early country and folk music performer from Dillsboro, North Carolina. She won much praise for her work with the fiddle and banjo. In 1924, accompanied by guitarist Eva Davis, she traveled to New York City and recorded about a dozen songs for Columbia Records. The recordings are also notable for being the first use of a 5-string banjo on a recording. She was a yearly staple at Bascom Lamar Lunsford's Mountain Dance and Folk Festival from 1928 until shortly before her death.
Folksinger Pete Seeger attended Lunsford's festival in 1935 at the age of 16 in the company of his father, composer Charles Seeger, then working for the music division of the WPA, and his stepmother, noted modernist composer Ruth Crawford Seeger, and would have heard Bumgarner perform there. Seeger has credited Bumgarner as his inspiration for wanting learn the five-string banjo. "He learned (he says) to play the banjo after first hearing one played by a mountain girl named Samantha Bumgarten from the Great Smokies" 
Bumgarner was also among the artists Lunsford assembled to play before George VI and Queen Elizabeth of England in June 1939 at the invitation of President and Mrs. Roosevelt at a White House concert of American music arranged by Charles Seeger and Adrian Dornbush (of the WPA) for the benefit of the first visit by a reigning British monarch and his consort on American soil. Among the other (racially integrated) performers were American concert artists Marian Anderson, Lawrence Tibbett, and Kate Smith, singing classical and light popular music; and folk performers Lily May Ledford and the Coon Creek Girls; Josh White; the Golden Gate Quartet; Sam Queen and the Soco Gap Square Dance Team, who demonstrated clog dancing; and Alan Lomax, singing cowboy songs. According to Judith Tick, Professor of Music at Northeastern University, "It was a singular moment of glory for the Washington WPA folklorists."
First female Country recording artist.
Bumgarner and her friend, Eva Davis, recorded the same year as another female country singer, Roba Stanley. Stanley, whose recordings were made in July, 1924, is believed by many to have been the first female to record country music, but Bumgarner and Davis' recordings were made three months earlier, in April. The pair recorded both in duet and as singer and accompanist and thus qualify for the distinction of having been the first female country solo recording artists.

Diligence

Diligence is steadfast application, assiduousness and industry; the virtue of hard work. It is one of the seven heavenly virtues.
Diligent behaviour is indicative of a work ethic; a belief that work is good in itself.
Diligence in students.
Bernard et al. suggest diligence in a student is defined as an effort he or she puts towards balanced and holistic development in mental, physical, social and spiritual dimensions. They find diligence in students is correlated with academic performance. This is especially found in younger students. The support of parents and educators encourages students to be diligent. Other factors which encourage diligence in students include motivation, discipline, concentration, responsibility and devotedness.
Diligence in Buddhism.
The last words of the Buddha was "Strive on with diligence". Diligence is an integral part of all Buddhist teaching, and is considered the fourth of the pāramitā. In Mahayana tradition diligence is the third pāramitā and the first which is said to lead to liberation. The practice of diligence will bring an increase of qualities.
Diligence in Christianity.
Diligence, in Christianity, is the effort to do one's part, while keeping faith and reliance in God. In other words, diligence and faith are two sides of a mystery. One doesn’t know how, despite one's effort, it all works out. But diligence when combined with faith assures spiritual success. Diligence as one of seven virtues describes thoroughness, completeness and persistence of an action, particularly in matters of faith.
Diligence in Hinduism.
According to Brian Hatcher, the precepts of Hinduism require a human being to discover and live a "dharmic" life. To live a "dharmic" life, one must live with right intention with diligence, and with concern for well being of others. The Hindus celebrate Diwali, a festival of lights, where Goddess Lakshmi (also called Goddess Sri) is worshipped; the goddess symbolizes thorough preparation, being organized, diligent and honest. These characteristics are considered by Hindus as essential for success and Shubh Labh (ethical profit).
Due diligence.
Due diligence is the necessary amount of diligence required in a professional activity to avoid being negligent. This commonly arises in major acquisitions where the legal principle of "caveat emptor" (let the buyer beware) requires the purchaser to make a diligent survey of the property or service.

Beard and Chuang model

The Beard and Chuang model is a well known and leading theoretical force balance model used to derive the rotational cross-sections of raindrops in their equilibrium state by employing Chebyshev polynomials in series. 
Applications.
The description of raindrop shape has some rather practical uses. Understanding rain is particularly important with regard to the propagation of electromagnetic signals. A portion of atmosphere that has rain in it, or a rain cell, has the characteristic of attenuating and de-polarizing EM signals that pass through it. The attenuation of such a signal is approximately proportional to the square of the frequency of the signal, and the de-polarization is proportional to the shape distribution of raindrops in the rain cell.

Allan Byron (Teddy) Morris (March 1910 - September 5, 1965) was a Canadian Football Hall of Fame player and coach for the Toronto Argonauts.
Morris began playing Canadian football with Toronto playground teams and moved on to the Winnipeg Native Sons junior football team. Upon his return to Toronto he joined the Argonauts junior squad and quickly earned a spot on the senior team. He was a star player for the Argonauts for nine years and was named All-Eastern running back three times and flying wing twice and named the 1937 Jeff Russel Memorial Trophy winner as the player who best exemplified skill, sportsmanship, and courage in the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union.
Morris' recovery of an Argonauts' punt blocked by Winnipeg's Bud Marquardt in the 25th Grey Cup is often cited as the first of the fabled "Argos Bounces" as it bounced off the field and right into Morris' hands preventing a Blue Bomber possession deep in Argos territory.
In 1940, the year following his last game as a player, Morris began as a backfield coach for the Argonauts then, during IRFU's break from playing during the Second World War, coached the HMCS York Navy football team, and upon IRFU's return to play in 1945, became Argonauts head coach earning three consecutive Grey Cups from 1945 to 1947 and respect from fans and players alike.

It was released as a digital download through the band's website on July 15, 2008, and made available on iTunes on July 29, 2008. It is one of the songs that marked a change in direction in Hinder's music, transitioning from post-grunge to more of a glam metal sound, while still retaining the post-grunge and hard rock influences that were used on Hinder's previous album, "Extreme Behavior".The song was put on as downloadable content for the video games and Rock Band 2. 
Music video.
A video was made for the song. It depicts the band arriving at a large mansion where a large party is occurring along with many women. Andrew Dice Clay stands at the door and acts as a bouncer. Intercuting with scenes of the band performing the song in front of the houseguests, the video follows a mysterious blonde woman. This woman proceeds to seduce and have sex with all the members of the band. The climax occurs when the blonde walks past the band and they realize that they all have slept with her. It ends with them toasting to their conquests and praising the madness of the party.
Chart performance.
The single debuted at #36 on the "Billboard" Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, peaking at #3 in September 2008. It only managed to "bubble under" the Billboard Hot 100 song chart, reaching #2 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart.

1733 slave insurrection on St. John

The 1733 slave insurrection on St. John in the Danish West Indies, (now St. John, United States Virgin Islands) started on November 23, 1733 when African slaves from Akwamu revolted against the owners and managers of the island's plantations. The slave rebellion was one of the earliest and longest slave revolts in the Americas. The Akwamu slaves captured the fort in Coral Bay and took control of most of the island, intending to resume crop production under their own control and use other ethnic Africans as slave labor. The revolt ended in mid-1734 when several hundred French and Swiss troops sent from Martinique defeated the Akwamu.
Background.
Slave trade.
When the Spanish first occupied the West Indies, they used the indigenous people as slave labor but disease, overworking, and war wiped out this source of labor. When the Danes claimed Saint John in 1718, there was no available source of labor on the island to work the plantations. Young Danish people could not be persuaded to emigrate to the West Indies in great enough number to provide a reliable source of labor. Attempts to use indentured servants from Danish prisons as plantation workers were not successful. Failure to procure plantation labor from other sources made importing slaves from Africa the main supply of labor on the Danish West Indies islands. Slaves exported from Africa on ships flying under the Danish flag totaled about 85,000 from 1660 to 1806.
The Danes embarked in the African slave trade in 1657, and by the beginning of the 18th century, the Danish West India and Guinea Company had consolidated their slave operation to the vicinity of Accra on the Guinea coast. The Akwamu were a dominant tribe of Akan people in the district of Accra and were known for being "heavy-handed in dealing with the tribes they had conquered." After the Akwamu king died, rival tribes in the area attacked the weakened Akwamu nation, and by 1730 the Akwamu were defeated. In retaliation for years of oppression, their enemies sold many Akwamu people into slavery to the Danes; they were transported to plantations in the West Indies, including estates on St. John. At the time of the 1733 slave rebellion on St. John, hundreds of Akwamu people were among the slave population on St. John. Approximately 150 Africans were involved in the insurrection, and all of them were Akwamu.
Danish occupation of St. John.
In 1718 the Danish made claim of the island of St. John for the purpose of establishing plantations. One hundred nine plantations and more than 1,000 slaves existed on St. John by the time of the 1733 slave rebellion. Many of St. John's plantations were owned by people from St. Thomas, who resided on their estates on that island. The absentee landowners hired overseers to manage their lands and slaves on St. John. The population of African slaves on St. John was more than five times larger than that of the European inhabitants: 1087 slaves and 206 whites. The Danish West India Company did not provide a strong army for the defense of St. John; it had six soldiers stationed on the island to supplement local militia raised from the whites.
Marooning.
In 1733, in response to harsh living conditions from drought, a severe hurricane, and crop failure from insect infestation, slaves in the West Indies, including on St. John, left their plantations to maroon. In October 1733, slaves from the Suhm estate on the eastern part of St. John, from the Company estate, and other plantations around the Coral Bay area went maroon. The "Slave Code of 1733" was written to enforce obedience from slaves. Penalties for disobedience were severe public punishment, including whipping, amputation, or death by hanging. A large section of the code intended to prevent marooning and stop slaves from conspiring to set up independent communities.
Slave revolt.
In their homeland many of the Akwamu were nobles, wealthy merchants or other powerful members of their society; marooning was a natural response to their intolerable living conditions, as they did not accept the status of slaves. (SEE: "1733 St. John's Slave Revolt", Discovery Channel: "Moments in Time" link title Narrator: James Woods; Actor: Jamall Sprauve; Actress: Jackie Smalls). The Akwamu intended to take control of St. John in the insurrection and rule it, continuing the production of sugar and other crops. They would use other slaves of differing tribal origin as slave laborers in turn. The leader of the revolt was an Akwamu chief, King June, a field slave and foreman on the Sødtmann estate. Other leaders were Kanta, King Bolombo, Prince Aquashie, and Breffu. According to a report by a French planter, Pierre Pannet, the rebel leaders met regularly at night to develop the plan.
Events on November 23, 1733.
The 1733 slave insurrection started with open acts of rebellion on November 23, 1733 at the Coral Bay plantation owned by Magistrate Johannes Sødtmann. An hour later, slaves were admitted into the fort at Coral Bay to deliver wood. They had hidden knives in the lots, which they used to kill most of the soldiers at the fort. One soldier, John Gabriel, escaped to St. Thomas and alerted the Danish officials. A group of rebels under the leadership of King June stayed at the fort to maintain control, another group took control of the estates in the Coral Bay area after hearing the signal shots from the fort's cannon. The slaves killed many of the whites on these plantations. The rebel slaves then moved to the north shore of the island. They avoided widespread destruction of property since they intended to take possession of the estates and resume crop production.
Accounts of the rebel attacks.
After gaining control of the Suhm, Sødtmann, and Company estates, the rebels began to spread out over the rest of the island. The Akwamus attacked the Cinnamon Bay Plantation located on the central north shore. Landowners John and Lieven Jansen and a group of loyal slaves resisted the attack and held off the advancing rebels with gunfire. The Jansens were able to retreat to their waiting boat and escape to Durloe's Plantation. The loyal Jansen slaves were also able to escape. The rebels looted the Jansen plantation and moved on to confront the whites held up at Durloe's plantations. The attack on Durloe's plantation was repelled, and many of the planters and their families escaped to St. Thomas.
End of the rebellion and the aftermath.
Two French ships arrived at St. John on April 23, 1734 with several hundred French and Swiss troops to try to take control from the rebels. With their firepower and troops, by mid-May they had restored planters' rule of the island. The French ships returned to Martinique on June 1, leaving the local militia to track down the remaining rebels. The slave insurrection ended on August 25, 1734 when Sergeant Øttingen captured the remaining maroon rebels. The loss of life and property from the insurrection caused many St. John landowners to move to St. Croix, a nearby island sold to the Danish by the French in 1733.
Franz Claasen, a loyal slave of the van Stell family, was deeded the Mary Point Estate for alerting the family to the rebellion and assisting in their escape to St. Thomas. Franz Claasen's land deed was recorded August 20, 1738 by Jacob van Stell, making Claasen the first 'Free Colored' landowner on St. John.
The slave trade ended in the Danish West Indies on January 1, 1803, but slavery continued on the islands. When the British emancipated their slaves in the British West Indies in 1838, slaves on St. John began escaping to nearby Tortola and other British islands. On May 24, 1840, eleven slaves from St. John stole a boat and escaped to Tortola during the night. The eight men (Charles Bryan, James Jacob, Adam Cato, Big David, Henry Law, Paulus, John Curay), and three women (Kitty, Polly, and Katurah) were from the Annaberg plantation (one) and Leinster Bay (10) estates. Brother Schmitz, the local Moravian missionary, was sent to Tortola by the St. John police to persuade the slaves to return. After meeting with the Tortola officials and the runaway slaves, Schmitz returned to St. John to relay the slaves' resolve to stay away because of abusive treatment by the overseers on the plantations. After the overseers were replaced, Charles Bryan, his wife Katurah, and James Jacobs returned to work at Leinster Bay. Kitty, Paulus, David, and Adam moved to St. Thomas. Henry Law, Petrus, and Polly West Indies on Tortola. John Curry relocated to Trinidad. None of the runaway slaves were punished.
On July 3, 1848, 114 years after the slave insurrection, enslaved Afro-Caribbeans of St. Croix had a non-violent, mass demonstration; the Governor-General declared emancipation throughout the Danish West Indies.

1953 Vicksburg, Mississippi tornadoes

The 1953 Vicksburg, Mississippi tornadoes were a deadly severe weather event that affected northeastern Louisiana, southeastern Arkansas, and western Mississippi on December 5, 1953. At least four confirmed tornadoes touched down; one of the tornadoes produced F5 damage on the Fujita scale as it moved through the city of Vicksburg, causing 38 deaths in the area. It remains the fourth-deadliest tornado to affect the U.S. state of Mississippi, behind the 1840 Natchez tornado, the 1936 Tupelo, Mississippi, tornado, and the March 3, 1966, tornado in Jackson, Mississippi. It is one of just four F5 tornadoes recorded in Mississippi since 1950.
Summary.
The first tornado touched down near Bernice, Louisiana, and moved northeast to the Mount Union area, injuring 16 people. The second tornado featured the longest continuous track of the event, traveling 58.3 miles (93.8 km) across northeastern Louisiana and southeastern Arkansas. Both tornadoes caused damage equivalent to F2 intensity. The third tornado became the deadliest event during the outbreak. It touched down over the Mississippi River and moved northeast across the city of Vicksburg, dissipating south of Villanova, Mississippi. The tornado was preceded by heavy rains as it moved through the city. Twelve blocks of the city's business district were affected by the tornado, and fires also burned cotton. The tornado broke the city's gas line, and it remained out of service after repairs. Residents were forced to avoid cooked food as temperatures dropped to 31°F overnight on December 6. In total, 270 people received injuries. The tornado is officially estimated to have been a F5 tornado on the Fujita scale; however, the rating is questionable, since the tornado demolished frail structures. The final tornado of the day produced F2 damage and caused 11 injuries near the Mississippi River in Coahoma County, Mississippi. In addition, severe thunderstorm winds injured seven people near Clarksdale, Mississippi.

Pisgah Home Historic District

Pisgah Home Historic District is a historic district in the Highland Park section of Los Angeles, California. It was the site of the Pisgah Home movement begun by faith healer and social reformer, Finis E. Yoakum, in the early 1900s. The site is closely aligned with the founding of the modern Pentecostal church. It has been a mission used for religious and charitable purposes for more than 100 years. The area today is operated as the Christ Faith Mission/Old Pisgah Home.
Finis E. Yoakum.
Finis Yoakum (1851-1920), the founder of the Pisgah Home movement, began his career as a medical doctor specializing in mental and neurological disorders and serving as the chair of mental disease on the faculty of Gross Medical College in Denver, Colorado. In July 1894, Yoakum was badly injured when he was struck by a buggy. He moved to Los Angeles in 1895, hoping the mild climate would assist in his recuperation. After attending a Christian Alliance prayer meeting in 1895, Yoakum recovered and considered his healing to be a miracle. He later wrote that he received visions telling him to create a mission for the needy.
Gold mining.
Though he began his mission around 1900, he continued to have other business interests as well. One of those interests was gold mining. In 1897, the "Los Angeles Times" published an article on Yoakum's claim that he had discovered a new method of "X-Ray Prospecting" for gold. Yoakum reported that he had laid a bit of gold-bearing quartz on the x-ray plate while taking an x-ray of a patient with a tumor. The x-ray showed the location of the gold deposits in the quartz, and Yoakum proposed using x-rays in mine tunnels to "ascertain decisively if gold is present, and if so, exactly where it lies and in what quantities." Following this report, Yoakum became active in gold and copper mining. In 1902, he ran a newspaper advertisement ("pictured at left") offering stock at 25 cents a share in his new mining company. Yoakum later claimed that it was while traveling in Mexico, the location of his mining interests, that he spoke for the first time in "tongues." He reported: "I was in the heart of Mexico in a church, speaking through an interpreter to the Mexicans and Indians, when suddenly a distinct rush of some might wind came upon me, and when I opened my mouth it was not English, but a beautiful smooth Castilian language, and for 20 or 30 minutes I held that large audience."
Pisgah Home movement.
Around 1900, Yoakum formed an institution that was initially known as Yoakum's Sanatorium at his house in the Highland Park section of Los Angeles. The home originally had room for only eight persons and was founded "to give free care to drunkards and outcasts who wished to reform." In March 1903, the "Los Angeles Times" reported that Yoakum was building a cottage to the north of his "Faith home" and had plans for a series of cottages for the use of patients at his sanatorium. In June 1903, the "Times" reported that proposed additions to Yoakum's sanatorium would increase the capacity from 50 to 150 patients. Some patients stayed in the main home, others stayed in the cottages, and others still stayed in tents and wagons on the property.
By 1903, Yoakum's Sanatorium had become the "Pisgah Faith Home", named after the mountain peak from which the Bible indicates that Moses first saw the promised land. Yoakum used his barn as a tabernacle for church services and also as additional living space for patients. Yoakum and the Pisgah Home movement became well-known not only in Los Angeles but nationally and internationally. The Pisgah Home was supported by voluntary offerings, and no specific charges were made for care or treatment. As Yoakum's fame spread, donations came in from all over the world to support its operations. The inmates (as they were known) were fed simple home-cooked meals, instructed on the Bible, then bathed and put to work around the home. Among the tasks given to the residents was the construction of a lavish Tudor-style mansion which became Yoakum's new home at 140 South Avenue 59, and has itself been designated a historic landmark.
In 1952, the "Los Angeles Times" described the origins of the Pisgah Home movement:"He (Yoakum) walked the back streets, among the down-and-outers, calling on them to give themselves to Christ. One by one at first, and then in droves, society's outcasts heeded and followed the fervent doctor with the white hair and trimly clipped white beard. Drunkards and cripples, paupers and habitual criminals—he befriended them all, and to them he preached the love of God." A more recent newspaper account described the origins of Pisgah Home this way:"The property, first known as Yoakum's Sanatorium, came to look like a tent city, offering a vegetarian diet and ample portions of the Gospel. Followers erected the tents, bungalows and other buildings next to his Queen Anne-style home, where he and his wife, Mary, continued to live. His barn became a church lined with beds. Yoakum was an early leader in the Pentecostal movement, which began in L.A. in 1906. By then, his home was already a mecca for 'foot-sore' hobos and the downtrodden."
By 1913, whole families were living at various Pisgah Home facilities. A newspaper reported on a trip to Redondo Beach by the Pisgah Home residents: "Sweet-faced old women, bent with age and crippled with rheumatism, sat side by side yesterday with tiny tots, all from the Pisgah Home, and enjoyed with them for the first time the thrills of a ride on the Lightning Racer. ... The occasion was a picnic given to the inmates of the Pisgah Home which includes the Pisgah Home for Reformed Drunkards, The Ark for Homeless Girls, the Pisgah Orphanage, and the Pisgah Gardens, and a Home for Destitute Consumptives."
Relations with neighbors of the Pisgah Home.
Yoakum reportedly had his followers distribute nickels to indigents on skid row, a sum that would permit them to ride the train to the station near Pisgah Home. As the crowds of "down and outs" continued to come to Pisgah Home, the movement drew the enmity of neighbors. And indeed, Yoakum's flock was the source of some crime in the area. In 1912, two of the "inmates" from Pisgah Home were arrested for the attempted robbery of a safe at a nearby business. In 1913, Halstead "Billy" Stiles, claiming to be a reformed gunslinger who was part of the James-Younger Gang when it attempted the Northfield, Minnesota bank robbery, moved into the Pisgah Home. Stiles' story was published in the Pisgah publication (with a reported circulation of 100,000), in which he wrote: "My soul was black with many a crime, but he Lord took me and washed me as white as wool. I was not reformed, but transformed." Later still, a large crowd assembled when boxing champion and accused murderer Kid McCoy (the man for whom the expression the "real McCoy" was coined) came to Pisgah Home "under heavy guard" to visit his mother, a resident. Other problems included elderly inmates wandering off in a "dazed condition" from the home. The Highland Park News-Herald reported in the late 1910s about the parade of people flowing to Pisgah Home:"It may be that some Sunday afternoon has found you in a spirit of criticism or pity for these poor deluded people ... From every direction you see them coming—in wheel-chairs, on crutches, stumbling in blindness, tottering with age, bent with burdens, painted with sin, stamped with greed ..." Complaints from his Highland Park neighbors were reportedly among the reasons for Yoakum's development of the remote Pisgah Grande community in the Santa Susana Mountains.
Faith healing.
Much of the publicity and funding for the Pisgah Home movement came from Yoakum's work as a faith healer and an early Pentecostal evangelist, traveling to many locations in California, the Eastern United States and Europe. His work as a healer received praise in many religious publications, and a secular writer noted that some of the lame and blind who came to Pisgah Home "left wheel chairs, crutches, braces, and canes to be hung in impressive testimony along the walls."
Other secular writers questioned Yoakum's faith healing practices. As early as 1903, Yoakum claimed his movement had performed some 800 healings, and the "Los Angeles Times" described Yoakum as the "leading apostle of the 'faith-healing' movement in this city." However, the "Times" noted discrepancies in the dates and circumstances of the "healings" under the headline "Pouring Oil on the Sick ... Stories Don't Jibe." In 1909, the "Los Angeles Times" published a lengthy article criticizing Yoakum's tactics. The article, titled "No Miracles Without Cash: Services Halt While Money Is Collected," described events at one of the healing services held at Pisgah Home. The "Times" opened by quoting the Pisgah Home motto: "God loves a cheerful giver." It then described a "Healing and Testimony of the Healed" service:"Collection boxes were placed on the grounds about the home and in the tabernacle, and an extra large one was on the platform, where Dr. Yoakum and his assistants perform their miracles. A large audience was present, but the sight alone of the collection boxes did not draw the dollars quite fast enough for the doctor, so the testimony service was stopped long enough for him to tell how necessary it is for one to give away all his money before entering the kingdom of heaven. Dr. Yoakum said that he performs such miracles as mentioned in the Bible, but that the one-tenth of a person's income for the purposes of the Lord was entirely too small, and that every one should give all their money to God's servants, or rather servant. After his talk the large box was placed on the front of the platform with the simple statement that there were several more at hand should one not prove large enough to hold all. This admonition opened the persons of many and soon the space around the platform was crowded with cheerful givers, many of whom looked as though they needed the money at home. ... Dr. Yoakum said: 'If you have a debt to pay, do not hoard your money in trying to pay it and be a tight-wad, but give it for God's work and he will find a way for you to get along.'"
The "Times" article also raised questions about the validity of Yoakum's "healings." They reported that, when an aged blind man began hobbling toward the platform, Yoakum hurriedly had the man seated with a statement that he "had not time during the meeting, but would see the patient privately." Yoakum also sold blessed handkerchiefs for $5. A newspaper account of Yoakum's 1909 healing event in Pomona, California noted: "A special feature of the meeting was the praying over handkerchiefs to be sent to the sick and laid upon their persons." The healing power of the handkerchiefs was reported in the Pisgah newsletter, and soon believers across the country were sending in $5 for a healing handkerchief.
Controversy over Yoakum's healings continued even after his death. In the late 1920s, a man sued Yoakum's estate to collect a $3,300 loan made to Yoakum as consideration for driving a demon from the man's invalid daughter. The litigation resulted in two published cases, including a decision of the California Supreme Court, "Mix v. Yoakum", 200 Cal. 681 (1927), and "Mix v. Yoakum", 138 Cal. App. 290 (1934).
Pisgah Home expands.
As the Pisgah Home movement became successful, Yoakum built other facilities. Pisgah Ark was built in Arroyo Seco where "wayward girls" and prostitutes were sheltered and taught midwifery under the direction of Sister Nell. Pisgah Gardens was built in North Hollywood, where beds were maintained for 100 patients suffering from tuberculosis, cancer and mental disorders. Yoakum also built the Pisgah Store in Arroyo Seco where donated clothing and other goods were distributed free of charge. There was also a gospel mission in West Los Angeles. In the late 1910s, a local newspaper described the breadth of services provided by Pisgah Home:"Its door is ever open any hour, day or night, to receive the poor, needy, homeless, the drunkard, fallen, or outcast. Across the Arroyo, the 'Ark' makes a home for rescued women and girls. Nearby is the 'Workers' Home,' and the 'Store,' over whose counter no money has ever passed in the five years of its existence. Voluntary contributions keep its supply ever ready for the needs of the many people who apply. Eighteen or twenty miles (32 km) away are the 'Gardens,' of fruit, vegetable and farm land near Lankershim, with under cultivation. Here a hundred more are gathered, a colony of consumptives fighting their way back to health, a group of epileptics and feeble minded, and an orphanage for 'nameless' and homeless children. Apricot, plum and peach trees furnish fruit which is dried by the ton, and cannery preserves much of the fruit which, together with other products, is distributed to the poor, 'without money and without price.'"By 1914, Pisgah Home had outgrown its facilities, and Yoakum bought a 3,300 ranch in the Santa Susana Mountains north of Simi Valley, California. Yoakum paid $50,000 for the property, and there he built Pisgah Grande, a residential and religious utopian community that has since been reclaimed by nature.
Later uses of the property.
Fifteen days before his death in August 1920, Yoakum executed deeds to his two sons of all his real property and also executed a will leaving his estate in trust for the Pisgah Home movement. The Pisgah Home movement sued Yoakum's two sons claiming that the real property had been conveyed to the sons to be held in trust for the movement. The lawsuit was ultimately settled with the properties being divided between the family and the movement. The original Pisgah Home in Highland Park continued to be operated as a mission. In 1936, the home was taken over by Arglee F. Green, known as Mother Green, of Christ Faith Mission; Mother Green used it as a shelter for homeless women and children. From 1950-1993, Pisgah Home was operated by the Rev. Harold James Smith; Smith published the "Herald of Hope" newspaper (with a reported circulation of 60,000) from the Pisgah Home and his "Prayer Tower" radio broadcasts also emanated from the Pisgah Home property. Since 1993, the property, known as Christ Faith Mission/Old Pisgah Home, has been directed by Richard A. Kim as its Administrator and Chief Executive Officer.
Historic designation.
In 1994, the City of Los Angeles adopted a historic preservation overlay zone around Pisgah Home. In 2000, the Pisgah Home received a preservation grant from the Getty Trust, and in December 2007, the Pisgah Home Historic District was listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

Palladius of Embrun

Saint Palladius of Embrun (, ) (d. ca. 541 AD) was a 6th-century bishop of Embrun. Born to a Christian family, he studied under Catulin, bishop of Embrun, who had attended the Council of Épaone in 517. When the Arians and Sigismund of Burgundy opposed the council, Catulin was exiled to Vienne. Palladius accompanied him there, and took the opportunity to extensively study Scripture. Palladius was ordained a priest and, according to legend, gained the gift of prophecy. He is said to have predicted the death and fall of Sigismund. Catulin died around 518, and Palladius would later be elected bishop of Embrun. During his episcopate he built numerous churches, in Chorges, Sauze, and Rama, as well as sanctuaries dedicated to Saint Martin of Tours, and Saints Vincent, Orontius, and Victor, as well as to Genesius of Arles. One source states that Palladius "possessed an exceptional efficacy in obtaining whatever he petitioned God for." Many miracles were attributed to him, and, besides the gift of prophecy, he enjoyed a "mystical familiarity with the angels... successfully defeated the machinations of the devil simply by making the sign of the cross."
Veneration.
In Catalonia, he is known as "Patllari" or "Pal•ladi". According to a legend associated with his relics, some Benedictine monks decided to go to Embrun to steal Palladius' relics to take them with them to Spain. Once they were in possession of the relics, the monks placed them in a container, which was carried by a donkey. When the travelers reached the outskirts of the town of Camprodon, the animal refused to travel any longer and did not move. The monks tried to get the donkey to budge, but the animal refused. It stamped its feet against the ground: miraculously, three springs of water gushed out from the ground where the donkey had stamped its feet. The monks let the donkey go free. The animal wandered into the town, passing the churches of Carme, Santa Maria, entering the monastery of Sant Pere, where it remained. The monks decided to leave the relics at Camprodon, at Sant Pere.
Contrary to the legend, the relics can actually be found at the church of Santa Maria de Camprodon, a church of mixed Romanesque, Gothic, and Baroque architectural styles.
However, the 14th century reliquary of Saint Palladius ("Arqueta de Sant Patllari") may have proceeded from the monastery of Sant Pere before being moved to Santa Maria.
In Camprodon, the feast day of Palladius is celebrated with dances (such as the sardana), music, and a procession of “giants” ("Cercavila de gegants"), which are sculptures of giant historical figures.

107.3 Abbey FM

Abbey FM was a local radio station for Barrow-in-Furness and the Furness Peninsula. The station ceased transmission at 3pm on 30 January 2009 and was placed into administration with the loss of seven jobs. This followed one of the station's main backers, The Local Radio Company, withdrawing their support three weeks earlier. The Station Manager at the time Amanda Bell told the North West Evening Mail that this “forced the hand of the other shareholders” and that she was only informed of their decision on the day of the closure at 12.30pm.
Abbey FM was owned by The Radio Business Ltd (35%), CN Group Ltd (30%) and The Local Radio Company Ltd (35%). The licence was for a locally-focused, full-service, music and information lifestyle station for 25-64 year-olds service to serve the town of Barrow-in-Furness and the immediately surrounding area, which has an adult population (aged 15+) of around 65,000.
The licence was issued for a twelve-year period.
As of 3pm on Friday 30 January 2009 Abbey FM stopped broadcasting, shortly after the announcement that the South Cumbria station had been placed into administration by its joint owners CN Group, TLRC and The Radio Business.

Freedom of Information Act 1982

The Freedom of Information Act 1982 (FOI) is Australian Commonwealth Freedom of Information legislation which gives members of the public rights of access to official documents of the Government of the Commonwealth and of its agencies.
Outline of the Act.
Members of the public have certain rights of access. These include the right to access documents about the operation of government departments and documents that are in the possession of government Ministers or agencies (Freedom of Information Act 1982). Certain documents are exempt from this, including (but not limited to) documents that could damage national security, defence or international relations, or any document that could damage Commonwealth-State relations (Freedom of Information Act 1982).
Requesting Information.
The request for access to a document must be in writing, and contain a reasonable amount of information about the requested document in order for it to be easier to locate (Freedom of Information Act 1982). The application process can also incur charges (Freedom of Information Act 1982).
The government agency or Minister who receives the application must endeavor to inform the applicant that their request has been received within 14 working days, and must also notify the applicant of their decision in relation to the request within 30 working days (Freedom of Information Act 1982).
History of the FOI.
Before the FOI act of 1982 the various governments of Australia had no obligation to release information to the public, because the traditional Westminster system of governance is fairly closed to public scrutiny.
Between the 1960s and 1980s a number of enquiries were made, looking into the transparency of the Australian government and public services which lead to New Industry Law (NAL) reforms. One of the NAL initiatives was Freedom of Information and is considered a "landmark in the development of Australian democracy".
Update to legislation.
The Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Act 2010 was passed in May 2010, and came into effect from November 2010. The changes were largely targeted at reducing the cost of FOI applications, which had been criticised by journalists as prohibitively costly (Ricketson and Snell, 2002). 
Some of the changes (Freedom of Information Amendment (Reform) Act 2010) for applications received on or after 1 November 2010 include:

Asylum Case (Colombia v. Peru)

In the Asylum Case (Colombia v Perú), judgement 20 November 1950 (General List No. 7 (1949–1950)), the International Court of Justice (ICJ) recognised that the scope of Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice encompassed bi-lateral and regional international customary norms as well as general customary norms, in much the same way as it encompasses bilateral and multilateral treaties. The Court also clarified that for custom to be definitively proven, it must be continuously and uniformly executed.
The Colombian Ambassador in Lima, Perú allowed Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre, head of the American People's Revolutionary Alliance sanctuary after his faction lost a one day civil war in Peru on 3 October 1948. The Colombian government granted him asylum, but the Peruvian government refused to grant him safe passage out of Peru.
Colombia maintained that according to the Conventions in force - the "Bolivian Agreement of 1911 on Extradition", the "Havana Convention of 1928 on Asylum", the Montevideo Convention of 1933 on Political Asylum - and according to American International Law, they were entitled to decide if asylum should be granted and their unilateral decision on this was binding on Perú. 
Both submissions of Colombia were rejected by the Court. It was not found that the custom of Asylum was uniformly or continuously executed sufficiently to demonstrate that the custom was of a generally-applicable character.

Nathaniel "Nat" Williams (born May 18, 1956) is an American law-enforcement officer who is the current sheriff of St. Helena Parish, Louisiana, and the first African American ever elected to hold that position in the parish's history.
Background.
Williams was born in East Feliciana Parish, Louisiana, and graduated from high school there. He is a graduate of the Louisiana State University Basic Training Academy, in Baton Rouge, the D.E.A. Training Academy and has received Police Internal Affairs training, as well as Police Supervisory training. He was first employed by the Sheriff's Department on May 8, 1990, when he started as a patrolman, working his way through the ranks to Chief of Operation. He was the chief criminal deputy sheriff when he was appointed acting sheriff following the resignation of the elected sheriff in early 2007. He then won the October 2007 primary election for sheriff, garnering 51.6% of the vote in a five-candidate field.
Controversies.
In the past 11 years, three elected sheriffs and one deputy sheriff in St. Helena Parish have been convicted and sent to jail. In 1997, Sheriff Eugene Holland was found guilty of misuse of government funds and property and using prison inmates for personal labor. His replacement, Chaney Phillips, served for only a year before he was convicted for fraud and money laundering that he committed while Parish Assessor. Ronald "Gun" Ficklin took over the Sheriff's office in 1998. Ficklin, the sheriff Williams replaces, resigned after pleading guilty in federal court last year. Ficklin admitted that he worked with a stolen car ring and had state prisoners housed in the parish jail work as his personal race car pit crew. On June 26, 2008, detectives with the Louisiana State Police arrested Jessie Hughes a deputy with the St. Helena Parish Sheriff's Office on charges of molestation of a juvenile and aggravated rape. Williams suspended then fired Hughes as a result of the allegations.
Sheriff Williams recently stated that he will arrest members of citizens patrols that are carrying "assault weapons" and has described them as threats to the community. 
As sheriff.
Given the 11-year history of corruption in the sheriff's office, Williams has indicated any further criminal activity would not be tolerated. Williams has also said that he would revive a plan to build a new 150-bed jail, add road deputies to improve response time and drug interdiction as well as step up speed limit enforcement on highways.

Court Improvement Project

The Court Improvement Project was created as part of the US federal Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1993, Public Law 103-66. OBRA designated a portion of these funds ($5 million in fiscal year 1995 and $10 million in each of FYs 1996 through 1998) for grants to state court systems to conduct assessments of their dependency courts, and to develop and implement a plan for system improvement. The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (ASFA), Public Law 105-89, reauthorized the CIP through 2001, which Congress funded at $10 million annually. There were no substantive changes made to the CIP in the 1997 reauthorization.
The Promoting Safe and Stable Families Amendments of 2001, Public Law 107-133, reauthorized the Court Improvement Program through FY 2006. The law also expanded the scope of the program to: (1) include improvements that the highest courts deem necessary to provide for the safety, well-being, and permanence of children in foster care, as set forth in ASFA; and (2) implement a corrective action plan, as necessary, in response to findings identified in a child and family services review of the State's child welfare system. Public Law 107-133 authorizes a mandatory funding level of $10 million for CIP and new discretionary funding for FYs 2002 through 2006. From any discretionary funding appropriated annually for the Promoting Safe and Stable Families Program, the law authorizes a 3.3 percent set-aside for the CIP. Finally, the Court Improvement Program authority was transferred to a new section 438 of the Social Security Act.
A substantial increase in funding for CIP occurred in 2006, when two additional ten million dollar grants were authorized.
Funded in 2004 by the Children's Bureau, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the National Evaluation of the Court Improvement Program is a five-year study being carried out by a partnership of three organizations consisting of Planning and Learning Technologies (Pal-Tech, Inc.) of Arlington, VA; The Urban Institute of Washington, DC; and The Center for Policy Research of Denver, Colorado

<doc id="18483886" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18483886" title="Grapefruit knife">
Grapefruit knife

A grapefruit knife is a special type of knife designed specifically for cutting grapefruit. Grapefruit knives are small with a unique curved serrated blade, designed to hug the curves of the grapefruit. This is used to separate the outer edge of the segments from the rim of the fruit. The term "grapefruit knife" can refer to a type of knife with short, serrated twin blades about 2mm apart, used to separate the sides of each section from the dividing membrane. Some grapefruit knives incorporate both types, a double-sided curved blade on one side and the parallel twin blades on the other. Another type includes an angled tip and double sided serrated blade. When both types are used, the result is an intact-looking fruit with sections which lift out easily - especially if a "grapefruit spoon" is used.
English law.
A legal case in the English Criminal Courts has held that a grapefruit knife is, in fact, a knife. It is illegal under the Criminal Justice Act 1988 to sell knives to persons under 18. Trading Standards officers of the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead brought charges in East Berkshire Magistrates' Court against W J Daniel and Company Limited, one of whose employees had sold a grapefruit knife to a test purchaser under the age of 16 on 17 February 2009. The magistrates were persuaded that it is was not, in fact, a knife but a "gadget" and duly dismissed the case. At an appeal in the High Court, Sir Anthony May found that this was wrong. Using the definition of "knife" in the "Oxford English Dictionary" (""A cutting instrument consisting of a blade with a sharpened longitudinal edge fixed in a handle either rigidly, as in a table knife, carving or sheath knife, or with a joint, as in a pocket or clasp knife. The blade is generally of steel, but sometimes of other material, as in the silver fish and fruit knives, the blunt edged paper knife of ivory, wood, etcetera, and the flint knives of early man."") which, he said, accorded with his own understanding, he ruled that a grapefruit knife was indeed a knife within the meaning of the Act and upheld the appeal. The case was remitted to the magistrates to continue the hearing.

Charles-Joseph Coursol

Charles-Joseph Coursol QC (3 October 1819 – 4 August 1888) was a Canadian lawyer and politician, the Mayor of Montreal, Quebec between 1871 and 1873, and a member of Canadian Parliament from 1878 until his death.
Baptised Michel-Joseph-Charles Coursol, he was born at Fort Malden, Upper Canada, located at what is now Amherstburg, Ontario. He was the son of Michel Coursol (d.1820), of the Hudson's Bay Company, and Marie-Mélanie Quesnel, daughter of Joseph Quesnel. His father died before he was one year old, and he was adopted and brought up like a son in the home of his uncle, The Hon. Frédéric-Auguste Quesnel.
His early education was at the Petit Séminaire de Montréal, and afterwardss he was apprenticed to his step-father Côme-Séraphin Cherrier for the legal profession until his formal installation as a lawyer on 24 February 1841.
During his legal career in Montreal, he was a city councillor in Saint-Antoine ward between 1853 and 1855. Coursol left politics for numerous years, yet maintained a high profile in the Montreal community with other activities such as business and culture. He returned to local politics and was acclaimed Mayor in both 1871 and 1872. During that time, Coursol established urban parks for public use.
After he left the Mayor's office, Coursol served as President of the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society from 1872 to 1876. His attention turned to national politics, winning the Montreal East riding for the Conservatives in the 1878 federal election. He served second and third terms in the riding, running uncontested in the 1882 and 1887 federal elections. However, Coursol died in office at Montmagny, Quebec on 4 August 1888.
Coursol's honours included Spain's Order of Charles III in 1872, then his appointment as Queen's Counsel in February 1873.

Longmont Potion Castle Volume 5

Longmont Potion Castle Volume 5 is the sixth, and, at the time it was released, supposedly final album of prank phone calls by the anonymous artist known only as Longmont Potion Castle. It was released May 31, 2005 by Reptillian Records.
"Volume 5" featured several tracks where the caller used voice modification technology (to alter the pitch and speed of his voice) and three-way calling, both with the goal of confusing the people on the other line. Some of the businesses dialed include Orange Julius, Blockbuster Video, Waffle House, Wall Units, Albertsons, Twist & Shout Records, Sears and Office Max. Several calls are placed where LPC impersonates a frustrated UPS employee attempting to deliver a large and expensive crate of wildlife to various unassuming parties. Another track features Longmont Potion Castle contacting various homes in the Denver area to ask them who they voted for in the (then-recent) 2004 United States presidential election.
"Volume 5" was also included in the 2006 retrospective box set, "Longbox Option Package".
Reviews.
"Volume 5" was praised by Prank Call Central as "great stuff" and "a magical wonderland of non sequitor telephonic hilarity". The "Denver Westword" said in their review that the record succeeded in helping "further advance absurdity as art form."

The Tektronix Phaser 740 was a series of color laser printers sold by Tektronix's printer division, now a part of Xerox. The Phaser 740 is notable for being the industry's first true 1200×1200 dpi color laser printer. The printer was available in several different configurations, from the 740L ($1499 MSRP, only black toner included) to the fully tricked out 740 Extended (128 MiB RAM, duplexing, hard drive, etc.). The "plus" feature set was required for 1200×1200 color printing. Standard features included 10baseT Ethernet, LPT connectivity, SCSI connectivity, an expansion port for other networking options, 133 MHz PowerPC CPU, and PostScript. Network protocols included Telnet, FTP, AppSocket, IPP, HTTP, and AppleTalk. One upgraded the lowest model to the Extended functionality by adding components. A notable feature of this printer is its ability to accept PDF files directly, through FTP or Telnet. The onboard computer would then process the PDF to PS and print it. Phaser 740 series printers required little maintenance compared to other printers of the time. The only consumables were toner, fuser, imaging drum, and transfer roller.

E. E. Rehmus

E. E. Rehmus, also alternatively given as Ed Rehmus, Edward Rehmus or Edward E. Rehmus (June 1929 – March 2004), was an American occultist, linguist, Egyptologist, classicist, writer, editor, translator, illustrator, cartoonist, and occasional graphic artist primarily known for being the author of "The Magician's Dictionary".
Biography.
Early life and youth.
Joseph Haskew, his long-term partner, wrote of Rehmus's early life and youth:
Maturity.
Haskew further adds:
Involvement with High-IQ societies.
As a polymath and philomath, Rehmus was actively involved with the quest to understand and expand human intelligence, himself being a member of several high-IQ support groups. Among these affiliations was his involvement with the San Francisco area Mensa society; he often contributed to that local society's publication, "The Ecphorizer". Rehmus was also a member of the Prometheus Society, a high-IQ society with admission standards 600 times more stringent than Mensa's. His contributor notice from "The Ecphorizer" runs thus:
Author of "The Magician's Dictionary".
His public reputation rests mainly on his contribution to the study of the occult through his renowned book "The Magician's Dictionary", a vast pseudo-encyclopaedic work first published in 1990 that proposes a re-evaluation of some of the core building blocks of modern belief structures through definition and commentary on key words and phrases, from "Aaron" to "Zuvuya".
Other activities.
Apart from founding and editing various magazines and journals (sometimes under pseudonyms), Rehmus was a regular contributor to numerous and diverse scholarly and amateur publications, providing articles, texts, artworks, and even erudite crossword puzzles. While he remained an obscure figure to the public eye during his lifetime, the posthumous volume "The Magic of Ed Rehmus", compiled and edited by Fred Vaughan and published in 2006, sheds light on his personal life and many other previously inaccessible aspects of his thought, wide interests, and activities.

In Session is a blues album by Albert King with Stevie Ray Vaughan recorded live for television on December 6, 1983, at CHCH-TV studios in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, and released as an album on August 17, 1999. The album was released on DVD on September 28, 2010.[http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003KUSUE0][http://www.oldies.com/product-view/23481G.html]
It was the first of two collaborations captured for television [http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000ALZI38. It was recorded for one of a series of live television sessions recording the performances of various artists. The show was called "In Session". The album includes a few short segments of the banter by King and Vaughan between songs.
Initially, King was not going to do the show as he did not know who Vaughan was. He did not realize that Vaughan was actually 'little Stevie', the 'skinny kid' that he let sit in when King played in Texas. King talks about this on one of the conversation tracks. When he realized who Vaughan was, he agreed to play.
The album's material is mostly King's concert line up, with one Vaughan cut, "Pride and Joy." King is 'driving' the session, but he purposefully features Vaughan on a number of the songs.

Calderglen High School

Calderglen High School is a state-run secondary school in the St Leonards area of the Scottish new town East Kilbride, in South Lanarkshire. The complex of buildings is situated on the precipitous bank of the Rotten Calder Water, overlooking a meander named the School Bend. The school derives its name from the Calder glen (gorge) which the river occupies, which is a site of special scientific interest (SSSI). The school has a pupil roll of approximately 2,000, and 130 teachers, making it one of the largest secondary institutions in Europe. The School's houses are named Cameron, Torrance, and Struthers.
The school was established after the merger of Hunter High School and Claremont High School. Calderglen occupies the site of the former Claremont High, and was opened on 18 February 2008, in a new purpose-built building. The campus is shared with Sanderson High School, a special school catering for students with learning difficulties. Mrs Elizabeth White is the school's Head Teacher.
Modernisation.
The schools of Hunter and Claremont High School (East Kilbride) were in need of renewal due to wear and tear of the buildings. Leaks had started and asbestos damage was becoming a major issue. After consideration by South Lanarkshire Council, it was proposed to merge the two, and rename the new school Calderglen High. The other four high schools in East Kilbride have also merged into another two new schools.
Construction of the school started in 2004/2005 next to the existing Claremont building in St Leonards, and was to be ready at the start of the 2007/2008 school year, but was completed 6 months late. The Claremont building has been demolished and in its place is a new all-weather sports pitch facility.
Notable former pupils.
Notable alumni of Calderglen's predecessor schools, Claremont and Hunter, include footballer and current Rangers F.C. manager Ally McCoist, television presenter Lorraine Kelly, actor John Hannah, and MSP and former health minister Andy Kerr.

Voices in Harmony

Voices in Harmony (VIH), Northern California’s Premier Men’s A Cappella Chorus, is an award-winning, all-volunteer, 80+ voice male a cappella chorus known for its mastery of technically demanding close harmony. Their repertoire is diverse and encompasses music from the classics to jazz, contemporary to patriotic, pop and traditional choral selections. Voices in Harmony was founded in 2006 and is based in San Jose, California. VIH is currently under the musical direction of Chris Hébert. Now in their 7th year, VIH has rapidly become one of the finest a cappella choruses in the world.
All members of Voices in Harmony are non-paid volunteers. A 501 (C)(3) organization, the chorus is self-sustaining through gifts, performance fees, admissions to shows, and sales of recordings and merchandise. Members of the chorus work in a myriad of professions, with backgrounds in high school music programs, church choirs, contemporary and collegiate a cappella groups.
History.
In late 2005, the idea of merging the San Jose Garden City Chorus and the Bay Area Metro Pot O' Gold Chorus from Pleasanton, CA, began to take shape. The abundance of experienced singers and musical leadership from both choruses provided a strong foundation from which to grow quickly. With the merger in hand, VIH was able to secure four-time International Chorus Champion director, Dr. Greg Lyne as musical director and move him to California. 
The newly combined chorus began meeting in January 2006 and competed in their first qualifying competition in April 2006, with 87 men on stage. VIH won the contest handily, and went on to place second in the Far Western District contest in October 2006. This earned the chorus a wild card invitation to the International contest, held in July 2007 in Denver, CO. VIH placed sixth in their first-ever International contest appearance, with 103 men on stage.
Voices in Harmony again placed second in the Fall 2007 contest of the Far Western District, behind the Masters of Harmony - (7-time International Chorus Champion). At their second International appearance in Nashville, TN in July 2008, VIH won a 3rd place medal bronze with an average score of 89.7%.
The chorus won their first Far Western District chorus championship in October 2008, with an average score of 88.4%. They represented the Far Western District at the 2009 International Chorus Contest in Anaheim, CA in July 2009, placing 8th with an average of 89.0%.
In addition to annual competitions at regional and international levels, the chorus produces a few concerts each year and also performs publicly throughout the Bay Area. Performance engagements include commercial bookings, community concerts, corporate meetings, charity events and other special events. Voices in Harmony also supports and promotes Youth in Harmony activities in bay area schools and colleges. 
Voices in Harmony’s first recording, Now & Then – Popular American Music from Six Decades of Classics, was released in 2008. The recording was nominated for Best Barbershop Album for the 2009 Contemporary A Cappella Recording Awards (CARA’s).
In August 2009, Voices in Harmony represented the United States at the 10th Annual Russian Barbershop Festival in St Petersburg, Russia, where they taught master classes and performed multiple concerts at many different venues throughout the historical city.
Voices in Harmony again placed second in the Far Western District contest in October 2009 with an average score of 88.3% - which qualifies them to compete at the international competition to be held in July 2010 in Philadelphia, PA. 
On June 12, 2010, Voices in Harmony performed with the GRAMMY-winning super group, The Manhattan Transfer at the historic California Theatre in downtown San Jose.
On August 28, 2012, Dr. Greg Lyne resigned as the Artistic Director of Voices in Harmony to concentrate on his world-wide coaching and clinician business, as well as directing his other chorus, Pacific Masterworks in Pleasanton, California.
Chris Hébert, former director of San Jose's Garden City Chorus, was named as the interim director of Voices in Harmony until a permanent replacement is found. In the meantime, Voices in Harmony will continue their pursuit of musical excellence in the Barbershop Harmony Society and the highest level of excellence as a performance chorus in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Chadstone High School

Chadstone High School (State School number 7710) was a former Victorian Government high school, located in the Melbourne suburb of Chadstone. Chadstone High School was often referred to as "Chaddy High".
History.
The school was established in the late 1950s in what was then a rapidly growing outer-suburban area. It initially operated out of demountable classrooms until a purpose-built three storey school building was finished in the early 1960s. The RK Senior Hall (named after one of the school's principals) was constructed in the 1970s.
It was established adjacent to the Chadstone Park Primary School. The school also took students from other neighbouring primary schools including Solway Primary School, Lloyd Street, Murrumbeena and Hughesdale.
The demographics of the area changed from the 1960s through to the 1980s with the area's population ageing. The school's population declined and the school was closed in 1991.
School Symbols and Uniform.
Chadstone's symbol was the mythical Phoenix, a fabled bird that rose from the ashes of defeat. "The Phoenix" became the name of the annual school magazine.
The name Phoenix lives on through Phoenix Park which is located on the school's site.
The school's motto was "Faith and Decision", as celebrated in the chorus of the school song...
""Let us resolve, like the phoenix to arise"
"From ashes of our lesser selves and strive"
"Throughout our lives, with honour and with truth"
"In faith and decision wise"" (composed by Haslam, Dombrain and Lamb.)
Boys wore long grey trousers with a white shirt and black shoes (or desert boots). Jacket and ties were worn in the 1960s and early 1970s but their use abated in the 1970s and a grey jumper became standard winter uniform.
Girls wore a chequered dress in summer and a grey skirt, white shirt and grey jumper in winter.
At formal events, such as concerts by the school's band or orchestra, boys and girls wore maroon blazers with the school emblem on the breast pocket.
Sporting uniforms were variations of red and black, or sometimes red, black, and white. Typical was a red tee-shirt and black shorts for athletics.
Famous Ex-Students.
Richmond Football Club player David Cloke attended Chadstone High School.
Redevelopment.
The school itself, apart from the RK Senior Hall, was demolished in the 1990s and the site redeveloped as Phoenix Park.

Paperback Dreams

Paperback Dreams (2008) is a documentary film about the fate of bookstores in the new economy, that was part of the KQED (San Francisco's PBS station) documentary film series, "Truly CA". It is "the story of two landmark independent bookstores and their struggle to survive. The film follows Andy Ross, owner of Cody's Books, and Clark Kepler, owner of Kepler's Books, over the course of two tumultuous years in the book business." 
"Publishers Weekly" notes that Beckstead became interested in the topic after becoming a "fan" of Cody's and Kepler's. While working in Menlo Park, California, he frequently shopped at Kepler's. Beckstead stated: “When I heard Kepler's was closing in 2005, I was shocked: it's in one of the most affluent, educated cities in America—just 15 minutes from Stanford University—and it made me realize that if an independent bookstore couldn't survive there, there must be a larger story.” After making the documentary, Beckstead stated that he discovered "four elements essential to the survival of an independent bookstore: Own your own building [...] Hire experienced staff [...] Sell used books [...] Figure out some way to sell books online." 
Screenings.
"Paperback Dreams" aired on PBS stations beginning in November 2008. It was previously screened at Book Expo America on May 31, 2008. and at the Oakland Museum of California (presented jointly with the Oakland Film Office) on August 1, 2008.

It is second most famous surname of Gujarat. Its variants include "Sah", "Shaha", "Sahu", "Sav", "Sha" or "Shaw".
History.
Sometimes the Indian surname "Shah" is mistakenly thought that it is derived from the Persian "Shah" meaning "King". Actually it is of Indian origin. It is derived from Sanskrit "Sadhu" (meaning gentleman) and Prakrit "Sahu", while the actual spelling "Shah" in Western culture was popularized by the title of the former Persian King. As a result, especially in Western culture, the usuage of the spelling "Shah" has become far more pronounced than the other variants. The word "Sadhu/Sahu" is also separately used to indicate a Jain monk. "See Namokar Mantra."
In the Gujarat region, the surname Shah derives from the Gujarati "sah" (from Sanskrit "Sadhu", "merchant"). The surname appears to have been altered under the influence of the Persian word for 'king' (Shah) or its variants. 
In numerous 12-13th century inscriptions the shravaka who installed the image, is given the title "Sahu".
For example:
Here the word Sahu is equivalent to Sanskrit word "sadhu". Some inscriptions use "sadhu" itself :
madhavannandinugrahitah sadhu-shri sarvadharah .."
The word Sadhu here does not mean a monk but a "gentleman". Some inscriptions abbreviate sahu by just "sa" just like 
many English speakers write "Mr."
In some business communities, genealogies are recited during marriages, all ancestors would be respectfully called "sahu".The term "sahukari"means the profession of banking/trading. In the Bundelkhand Jain community, the father-in-law (or
son's/daughter's father-in-law) used to be called "sahaji". Thus the words "Shah" etc. all indicate a respected member of 
the mercantile community. Today it is used by Gujarati business communities.

Electorate of Salzburg

The Electorate of Salzburg ( or "Kursalzburg"), occasionally known as the Grand Duchy of Salzburg, was an electoral principality of the Holy Roman Empire from 1803–05, the short-lived successor state of the Salzburg Prince-Archbishopric.
History.
In 1800 the territory of the Prince-Archbishopric had been occupied by French forces during the War of the Second Coalition, whereby Archbishop Count Hieronymus von Colloredo fled to Vienna. Augmented by the Berchtesgaden Provostry and parts of the former prince-bishoprics of Eichstätt and Passau, his lands were reorganized as the Electorate of Salzburg, created for Ferdinand III of Habsburg-Lorraine, younger brother of Emperor Francis II. 
Ferdinand had held the Grand Duchy of Tuscany until 1801, when Emperor Francis had to cede the rule over Tuscany to France and Louis of Bourbon-Parma according to the Treaty of Lunéville. The Grand Duke, on good terms with Napoleon, reached his compensation with the former Archbishopric in December 1802. The secularisation was accomplished, when Prince-Archbishop Colloredo in his Vienna exile formally resigned in favour of Ferdinand on 11 February 1803. Two weeks later, the episcopal territory was secularized as part of the German Mediatisation ("Reichsdeputationshauptschluss"). 
Ferdinand turned out to be a capable ruler. He established the Faculty of Medicine at the Salzburg University and insatted the distinguished pedagogue Franz Michael Vierthaler to introduce an education reform. He also ordered the improvement of mountain pass roads to Bad Gastein, Sankt Johann im Pongau and Radstadt, while his economic reforms roused opposition by the Salzburg guilds. When in October 1805 French troops again moved in during the War of the Third Coalition, Ferdinand, like his predecessor Archbishop Colloredo, had to leave his residence for his brother's court in Vienna.
Upon the crushing Austrian defeat in the Battle of Austerlitz, the Salzburg electorate was dissolved by the Peace of Pressburg signed on 26 December 1805. The lands of the former Archbishopric with Berchtesgaden passed to the Austrian Empire, while the Eichstätt and Passau territories were annexed by the Kingdom of Bavaria. Ferdinand was again compensated, this time with the newly established Grand Duchy of Würzburg. 
With the final dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, the Electorate was re-established as the Austrian Duchy of Salzburg and Francis added "Duke of Salzburg" to his title as Emperor of Austria. However, Salzburg remained an object of interests and negotiations during the Napoleonic Wars. After the War of the Fifth Coalition it passed to Bavaria according to the 1809 Treaty of Schönbrunn, incorporated into the Salzach District together with Tyrolean Kitzbühel, Traunstein and Ried im Innkreis in 1810. 
The Salzburg region was finally divided between Austria and Bavaria in the 1814 Peace of Paris. From 1816 the major part east of the Salzach River was subsequently administered from Linz within Upper Austria, until the Salzburg duchy was re-established in 1850.

Resource intensity

Resource intensity is a measure of the resources (e.g. water, energy, materials) needed for the production, processing and disposal of a unit of good or service, or for the completion of a process or activity; it is therefore a measure of the efficiency of resource use. It is often expressed as the quantity of resource embodied in unit cost e.g. litres of water per $1 spent on product. In national economic and sustainability accounting it can be calculated as units of resource expended per unit of GDP. When applied to a single person it is expressed as the resource use of that person per unit of consumption. Relatively high resource intensities indicate a high price or environmental cost of converting resource into GDP; low resource intensity indicates a lower price or environmental cost of converting resource into GDP.
Resource productivity and resource intensity are key concepts used in sustainability measurement as they measure attempts to decouple the connection between resource use and environmental degradation. Their strength is that they can be used as a metric for both economic and environmental cost. Although these concepts are two sides of the same coin, in practice they involve very different approaches and can be viewed as reflecting, on the one hand, the efficiency of resource production as outcome per unit of resource use (resource productivity) and, on the other hand, the efficiency of resource consumption as resource use per unit outcome (resource intensity). The sustainability objective is to maximize resource productivity while minimizing resource intensity.

Talchum

Talchum could be characterized as a Korean dance performed while wearing a mask, miming, speaking and even sometimes singing. Although most Koreans believe that talchum refers to all mask dance dramas, it is in fact a regional term only properly applied to dances of Hwanghae Province in present day North Korea. Dances from the Seoul or Gyeonggi Province region are known as sandae noli, whereas the dances from the southern coast are known as yayu which means field play or ogwangdae which means dance of five clowns. Korean mask dance dramas are not just dances performed by masked dancers but also include significant dramatic content with masked characters portraying people, animals and sometimes supernatural beings. These folk dramas reflect the frustrations felt by the lower classes towards the Confucian literati Yangban, due to the latter's treatment of the commoners, show the life of the common man and process social problems such as monks who ignore their precepts and men who cast off their old wives.
Characteristics.
Mask dance dramas share fundamental characteristics, even though they vary considerably according to region and performer. Their basic themes are exorcism rites, ritual dances, biting satire, parody of human weaknesses, social evils and the privileged class. They appeal to the audiences by ridiculing apostate Buddhist monks, decadent upper classmen, and shamans. Another popular theme is the conflict between an old wife and a seductive concubine. With regional variations, the mask dance drama was generally performed on the First Full Moon, Buddha's Birthday on the Eighth of the Fourth Moon, Dano Festival and Chuseok. Variations may have been performed at festive state occasions or at rituals to supplicate for rain. The enthusiastic participation of the audience is the most remarkable feature of Korean mask dance drama. There is little distinction between the actors and the audience toward the end of a performance, as they join together in robust dance and bring it to a finale.
Styles.
Mask dance dramas have been transmitted from all parts of the country. There are about thirteen different types of mask dance drama in Korea ― Hwanghaedo province's "Haeseo" style, such as Bongsan Talchum, Gangnyeong Talchum, Eunyul Talchum; Gyeonggi-do province's Yangju Byeolsandae, Songpa Sandae Noli Mask Dances; Gyeongsangnam-do province's Suyeong Yayu, Dongnae Yayu, Gasan Ogwangdae, Tongyeong Ogwangdae, Goseong Ogwangdae; Gyeongsangbukdo province's Hahoe Byeolshin'gut Talnoli; Gangwon province's Gangneung Gwanno Gamyeon'guk Mask Dance; and the Namsadang (Male Itinerant Entertaining Troupe of the Northern Line) "Deotboegichum" Mask Dance. Among those, Bongsan Talchum and Hahoi Byeolshin'gut Talnoli are best known today.
Imaginary Creatures in Talchum.
Yongno: A monster that eats bad Yangbans
Bibi: Kind of Yongno, makes 'Bi-bi' sound.
Jangjamari: Water spirits. Very fat, play instruments, has seaweed all over the body.
Juji: Strange beings. looks like a bird with a very small head. Two couples jumps all around.

Alexander of Lyncestis

"For other persons with the same name, see Alexander"
Alexander (Ἀλέξανδρος), son of Aeropus II of Macedon, was a native of the upper Macedonian district called Lyncestis, whence he is usually called "Alexander of Lynkestis" or Alexander Lyncestes. Justin makes the singular mistake of calling him a brother of Lyncestas, while in other passages he uses the correct expression.
He was a contemporary of Philip III of Macedon and Alexander the Great. He had two brothers, Heromenes and Arrhabaeus; all three were under suspicion of involvement in the assassination of Philip II of Macedon, in 336 BC. Alexander the Great, on his accession, put to death all those who had taken part in the murder, and Alexander the Lyncestian was the only one that was pardoned, because he was the first who did homage to Alexander the Great as his king. But king Alexander not only pardoned him, but even made him his friend and raised him to high honors, he was first entrusted with the command of an army in Thrace, and afterwards received the command of the Thessalian cavalry. In this capacity he accompanied Alexander on his eastern expedition. In 334 BC, when Alexander was laying at Phaselis, he was informed that the Lyncestian was carrying on a secret correspondence with King Darius III of Persia, and that a large sum of money was promised, for which he was to murder Alexander. The bearer of the letters from Darius was taken by Parmenion and brought before Alexander, and the treachery was considered proven. Yet Alexander the Great, dreading to create any hostile feeling in Antipater, the regent of Macedonia, whose daughter was married to the Alexander Lyncestes, thought advisable not to put him to death, and had him merely deposed from his office and kept in custody. In this manner he was dragged about for three years with the army in Asia, until in 330 BC, when, Philotas having been executed for similar crime, the Macedonians demanded that Alexander Lyncestes should likewise be tried and punished accordingly. Alexander the Great gave way, and as the traitor was unable to exculpate himself, he was put to death at Alexandria Prophthasia, the capital of Drangiana.
The object of this traitor was probably to gain possession of the throne of Macedonia, which previous to the reign of Amyntas III of Macedon had for a time belonged to his family.

He is two time Dutch and European Muay Thai champion, "K-1 World GP 2006 in Amsterdam" tournament finalist and "K-1 World Grand Prix 2008 in Hawaii" champion as the first ever Turkish fighter holding a K-1 tournament title. As of January 2013, Saki is ranked the #3 heavyweight in the world by LiverKick.com.
Biography and career.
Early life and career.
Saki was born and raised in Schiedam, a town located in the Netherlands, to a large family. He started practicing kickboxing at the age of 11 when he also began playing football (soccer). He quit playing soccer at the age of 16 because of his preference for kickboxing.
His initial trainer was Jan Pasztjerik, under whom he became Dutch, European and World Muay Thai champion within three years, before moving to the Golden Glory gym in 2003. In 2006, he returned to Pasztjerik as he embarked on a joint production with Golden Glory and Pasztjerik. Training at Golden Glory with Cor Hemmers, Saki became a well-known fighter as he took wins over André Tete, Vitali Akhramenko and Henriques Zowa, while also facing well-established fighters such as Badr Hari and Nicholas Pettas. Despite his success under Hemmers, Saki considers Pasztjerik as the main influence who helped him develop to the fighter he would become.
2006–2007.
Saki made his K-1 debut at the "K-1 World Grand Prix 2006 in Amsterdam" on May 13, 2006 where he defeated Alexey Ignashov in the quarter-finals and Rani Berbachi in the semis, before losing to Bjorn Bregy by first round knockout in tournament finals.
Saki returned to K-1 in March the following year, taking on Hiromi Amada at the "K-1 World Grand Prix 2007 in Yokohama" and winning via technical knockout by using Dutch-style low kicks. On June 23, 2007, he defeated Mourad Bouzidi at the "K-1 World Grand Prix 2007 in Amsterdam" by unanimous decision.
He finished off the year by taking a unanimous decision victory over Russian muay Thai fighter Magomed Magomedov at "K-1 Fighting Network Turkey 2007" in Istanbul on November 2.
2008.
On February 16, 2008, Saki won the WFCA World Thaiboxing Super Heavyweight (+95 kg) Championship by defeating Englishman Chris Knowles via TKO (left low kick) in his hometown of Schiedam. Following this, his next significant bout came in a super fight at the "K-1 World Grand Prix 2008 in Amsterdam" on April 26 where he knocked out Paul Slowinski with a left hook in the first round.
Following these impressive victories, he was invited to take part in the sixteen-man tournament at the "K-1 World Grand Prix 2008 in Hawaii" on August 9. Saki was able to win the tournament in devastating fashion by knocking out all three of his opponents, Deutsch Pu'u, Rick Cheek and Randy Kim. This victory earned Saki a place in the 2008 K-1 World Grand Prix final sixteen, and also marked the first time a Turkish fighter had won a K-1 Grand Prix.
Later that year at the "K-1 World Grand Prix 2008 in Seoul Final 16" on September 27, he was drawn against legendary New Zealander Ray Sefo. After three rounds, the judges had scored the fight a decision draw so it went to an extra round to determine the winner, after which Saki was announced the victor by unanimous decision. Advancing to the final eight at the "K-1 World Grand Prix 2008 Final" on December 6, Saki defeated Ruslan Karaev in the quarter-finals before being knocked out by the eventual champion, Remy Bonjasky, in the semis by a jumping kick to the rib cage.
2009.
Gökhan Saki began 2009 with a defence of his WFCA World Thaiboxing Super Heavyweight Championship, finishing Germany's Arndt Bunk witha body shot in round 1 on February 28.
A month later, he took part in the "K-1 World Grand Prix 2009 in Yokohama", an eight-man tournament to determine the inaugrle K-1 Heavyweight (−100kg) Champion. In the semi-finals, his fight with Tyrone Spong went into an extra round where he was able to win via knockout. In the final, he faced Keijiro Maeda in a bout which also went into an extra round. However, he lost via majority decision this time.
He returned against Pavel Zhuravlev on August 2 in a super fight at the "K-1 World Grand Prix 2009 in Seoul". He lost the fight via unanimous decision and also injured his knee in the fight, which meant that he could not participate in the World Grand Prix last sixteen.
He was still able to take part in a reserve fight at the "K-1 World Grand Prix 2009 Final", however, where he faced the legendary Dutchman Peter Aerts. He was defeated via unanimous decision, meaning that he had now lost three fights in a row.
2010.
In early 2010, Saki was able to bounce back by taking two wins in January and February, including a defence of his WFCA Muay Thai title against Utley Meriana, before rejoining the K-1 circuit in April. He took a decision victory over Singh Jaideep at the "K-1 World Grand Prix 2010 in Yokohama" before taking on Melvin Manhoef in a highly anticipated bout at "It's Showtime 2010 Amsterdam" on May 29. Saki won via TKO in the second round after the referee stopped the fight due to Manhoef being knocked down three times.
Having made a full recovery from his injuries and poor form, Saki was invited to the "K-1 World Grand Prix 2010 in Seoul Final 16" on October 2 where he knocked out Frenchman Freddy Kemayo in the first round. 
Following this, he entered the United Glory 2010/11 World Series at "United Glory 12" fourteen days later where he KO'd Russian Nikolaj Falin in Amsterdam, Netherlands.
Saki then returned to Japan for the "K-1 World Grand Prix 2010 Final" on December 11. He faced Daniel Ghiţă in the quarter-finals and won by unanimous decision after four rounds. However, he broke his right hand during the fight and went on to battle Golden Glory team mate Alistair Overeem in the semis. Using only his left hand and his kicks, he managed to outpoint his larger opponent; knocking Overeem down with a spin kick that was not counted, although Alistair landed a heavy left kick to Saki's right elbow that was also broken in his quarter-final fight. The fight was stopped in the first round as Saki could not continue however he gained huge respect for his heart and courage.
2011.
After recuperating from the injuries he sustained in the K-1 Grand Prix, Saki returned to the United Glory World Series in March 2011 where he took a decision victory over Wendell Roche in the semis at "United Glory 13".
He then went on to win the World Series at "United Glory 14: 2010–2011 World Series Finals" on May 28 in Moscow, Russia where he defeated Brice Guidon by decision.
2012.
On January 28, 2012, Saki faced Badr Hari at "It's Showtime 2012 in Leeuwarden" in what was to be Hari's last kickboxing match before moving into boxing. Hari defeated Saki with ease, scoring three knockdowns in the first round before the referee stopped the fight, earning him a TKO victory. He dropped him with a right uppercut first, the second knockdown came by a right hook. Finally, he landed a right uppercut again which dropped Saki for the third time.
When Saki's trainer, Cor Hemmers, took up a position working in the Glory promotion and was unable to spend as much time in the gym as before, Saki moved to Mike's Gym to train under Mike Passenier.
He faced Mourad Bouzidi at "" on October 6, 2012 in Brussels, Belgium and won by unanimous decision.
Saki ended the year by competing in the sixteen-man 2012 Glory Heavyweight Grand Slam at "" in Saitama, Japan on December 31, 2012. Saki defeated Raoumaru with ease at the opening stage, flooring the out-matched Korean twice in round one and forcing the referee to stop the bout. Then, in the quarter-finals, he knocked out Anderson "Braddock" Silva with his patented left hook in the closing seconds of round one. Advancing to the semis, Saki was eliminated by the eventual tournament winner, Semmy Schilt. Dwarfed by eleven inches and outweighed by twenty seven kilograms, Saki's high work rate was not enough to outpoint Schilt and he lost on points after the judges awarded the giant Dutchman the first two rounds.
2013.
Saki rematched Daniel Ghiţă at "" in Istanbul, Turkey on April 6, 2013 in a #1 contender's bout for the Glory Heavyweight Championship held by Semmy Schilt. The fight started out a little rough, as Saki caught a kick from the Romanian. He then backed Ghiţă up and threw him to the mat with a sweep. Ghiţă landed hard, looking to have suffered an arm injury. According to Glory's official rules, leg sweeps and trips are illegal moves and should thusly be counted as such. Instead, referee Joop Ubeda counted it as a down as Ghiţă took a while to get to his feet. Even though injured, round two saw again Ghiţă being more consistent but midway through the round, the Turk began landing heavy punches on him and simply did not let up, dropping durable Romanian three times to take a win via TKO after the referee stepped in, calling the fight.
In the semi-finals of "" in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, United States in October 2013, Saki gave a lackluster performance and was on the receiving end of a controversial knockdown in round one as he lost a majority decision to eventual tournament champion Rico Verhoeven. On November 2, 2013, Saki released a statement declaring that he was looking into taking legal action against Glory over the decision.
Competing for the inaugural Glory Light Heavyweight Championship, he will face Nathan Corbett in the semi-finals of "" in Istanbul, Turkey on April 12, 2014.
Personal life.
Saki holds dual Dutch and Turkish nationality, as his parents are immigrants from Turkey. He has stated that he respects Ramon Dekkers, and referred to Fedor Emelianenko as his favorite fighter.

Meditationes Vitae Christi

The "Meditationes Vitae Christi", also known as the "Meditationes de Vita Christi" ("Meditations on the Life of Christ", later translated into Middle English as "The Mirror of the Blessed Life of Jesus Christ") is a popular and important fourteenth century religious text. 
During the Middle Ages, until the late nineteenth century, it was traditionally ascribed to Bonaventure. Once it was realised that the work was not by him, but by an unknown author, the ascription was changed to pseudo-Bonaventure, representing a work previously thought to have been written by Bonaventure, but now of unknown author.
Its precise date of composition, and its author, remains unknown, but has occasioned much recent debate. Stallings-Taney (1997) ascribes the work to Johannes de Caulibus. Sarah McNamer (2009), has recently disagreed. She agrees that de Caulibus may well have produced the Latin text and two-thirds of its material. She argues, however, that the core of the "Meditationes" in fact originated in early fourteenth Italy and was written by an Italian nun – a core which now survives in a single Italian manuscript. Michelle Karnes (2010), though, is critical of McNamer’s argument, and prefers the traditional view that the work was written in the early fourteenth century, and that the author was probably a Franciscan, given that the work is addressed to a Poor Clare.
It was clearly popular in the Middle Ages, as evidenced by the survival of over two hundred manuscript copies, including seventeen illuminated ones. The popularity of the work increased further with early printed editions. A Venetian edition of 1497 is the only known Italian blockbook. 
The work's detailed evocations of moments from the Gospels influenced art, and it has been shown to be the source of aspects of the iconography of the fresco cycle of the "Life of Christ" in the Scrovegni Chapel by Giotto. It has also been credited with inspiring the great increase in depictions of the Veil of Veronica from the late 14th century.

St John's College, Hastings

St John's College is a State Integrated, Catholic, Day School for boys, located in Hastings, a provincial city in Hawkes Bay, New Zealand.
Founded in 1941 by the Marist Fathers, St John's College has a non-selective enrolment policy (although gives preference to students from Catholic families) and currently caters for approximately 450 students from Year 9 (3rd Form) to Year 13 (7th Form).
St John's College has a diverse, multicultural roll. In 2006 its ethnic composition was Pākehā 73%, Māori 23%, and Pacific 4%
. The college excels in sporting and cultural activities. Academically, the school offers for senior years the National Certificate of Educational Achievement assessment system (NCEA).
St John's College is the oldest private/state integrated secondary for boys in New Zealand outside the traditional main centres of Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, and Dunedin (Te Aute College, also in Hawkes Bay was previously the title holder but became coed during the 1990s).
History.
St John's College was established in 1941, on Frederick St, Hastings (the current site of St Mary's Primary School). It was founded by the Marist Fathers in response to the lack of Catholic education for young men in Hawkes Bay. It was also to be a brother school to the already established all girls Sacred Heart College, Napier, some 20 km north. 
Enrollment proved so popular that the school needed to expand, so in 1946, with an allotment of donated land, St John's College moved to its present site on Jervios St, Mayfair. Old boys recall that on the day of the move, they carried the school furniture, back and forth to the new premises over 3 km away, and still had to attend afternoon class. The roll grew more slowly after that. Part of the problem was the transportation of students from around the Hawkes Bay region as many students from Napier found it difficult to reach school before school bus lines were established. There were even calls to make both Sacred Heart and St Johns co-ed, to prevent Napier boys travelling to Hastings and Hastings girls traveling to Napier. Today this issue is non existent, although around 40% of St John's College students come from the Napier area.
In 1975, St John's College was "integrated" into the state system under the "Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975" "on a basis which will preserve and safeguard the special character of the education provided by them".
Over time St John's quietly expanded with the addition of new buildings and land. The 1990s saw drastic changes with the completion of 'The Centre' (the school gymnasium), the music suite and geography room, and the purchase of the old Firth industrial land to expand the playing fields. This gave St John's an additional rugby field, a new area for cricket nets, and another drive way towards Karamu road with additional car spaces. Since 2000 several remodels have been undertaken and includes the construction of the new technology wing. 
St John's College celebrated its 50th Jubilee in 2001 which was easily the colleges biggest event ever. An abundance of old boys returned for the weekend and included several speakers and functions as well as a variety of activities and inter house competitions for the students.
Campus.
St John's College is situated on Jervois St, Mayfair, in Hastings' northern suburbs. The site layout has all academic buildings close to the main road and are named after former rectors of the school, for example 'The Dowling Block' which contains the Library and Humanities subjects. Behind the buildings are the school playing fields, which separate the swimming pool and the tennis courts from the academic areas.
Facilities.
Current facilities of St John's include:
St John's tradition.
Crest.
The school crest incorporates four symbols. It incorporates the major elements of Archbishop Redwood's Crest the star and the AM as well as the "Redwood Cross" i.e. the cross on top of a pile of rocks. The five 5 pointed stars that sits in the upper left side representing the Virgin Mary; originally the star was a six-pointed star but quickly was corrected into the correct version. The second is the cross that appears on the right side of the crest. It is the Calvary Cross, which represents the place where Jesus was crucified while also representing Christianity. Third directly below the star, is an A imposed over an M, a common symbol for Ave Maria, which is Latin for Hail Mary. The fourth is the Eagle situated across the top section of the shield, which represents St John. In the shield's compartment is the College's motto.
Anthem.
"John knew a lord whose love was real,
"felt his power, saw love heal
"Love one another was the call,
"John remembered, taught us all,
"Trusting, Loyal and Faithful,
"Loving in word and deed,
"Opere et Viritate
"In Love, Real and Active, Lord We Pray
House system.
The current house system was bought into the College in 1999, and was named after early Catholic missionaries who came to New Zealand. All except Redwood are French, and staff and students pronounce them in the traditional ways. The names and colours of the St John's College Houses are: 
Prefects.
Every year, the school selects prefects from Year 13 students. This is done through a process of teacher recommendations and voting from Year 13 students at the end of Year 12. There is never a specified number though 16 is common. There are also house captains.
Curriculum.
Academic results.
The number of students achieving national qualifications is well above the national mean for similar decile schools at all levels of NCEA. The percentage of students obtaining NCEA Level 1 increased from 61% in 2003 to 66% in 2004. Levels of attainment in the literacy requirement have recently improved to the current level of over 91%. Achievement in university entrance results has steadily improved over the past three years and is above the national average for schools at this decile level.
The percentage of Year 12 Māori students leaving school with qualifications is well above the national rates for schools in this decile. Retention of Māori students to complete their Year 12 studies is high.
Co-curriculum.
Sport.
Playing a winter sport is compulsory for junior students (Year 9 and 10) to encourage social integration into the college environment. Although sport is not compulsory in the senior years, the majority of seniors participate in sport with large numbers competing in the Summer sports offered. 
Rugby is the most popular sport at the college and enjoys a large following from St John's old boys. There are at least 8 teams, which does not include special teams selected for events like the Under 15s tournament and the Father Fisher trophy.
Soccer is widely played at the college, and with hockey make up the rest of the majority of winter sport participants. There are also teams for basketball, badminton, squash, table tennis, athletics, swimming, tennis, orienteering, canoe polo and touch. Cricket is by far the largest sport during the summer. The Cricket teams are usually divided into Hastings or Napier teams in lower grades.
Many inter school sporting events take place, most notably with Catholic schools around the lower North Island. The main rivalry remains with other Marist Schools St Pat's Silverstream and St Pat's Town in Wellington, Hato Paora in the Manawatu, and St Johns in Hamilton.
Religion.
As a Catholic school, religion plays an important factor in the day to day lives of St John's College students. As well as participating in Masses and Chapel, prayers are formally conducted at staff meetings, in form classes to start the day, at assemblies and at school meetings.
Kapa Haka.
St John's College has a long and proud tradition of Kapa Haka. Along with Māori studies, students actively participlate in Māori cultural activities like the inter house Haka competition.

<doc id="18484591" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18484591" title="Cryptdin">
Cryptdin

Cryptdin is a term that refers to mammalian defensins of the alpha subfamily that are produced within the mouse small bowel. The word is a portmanteau that combines the terms 'crypt' and 'defensin'. Formally, in the scientific literature they are known as mouse enteric alpha-defensins.
Variation.
Cryptdins are the protein products of a related family of highly polymorphic genes that are specifically expressed by mouse Paneth cells at the base of intestinal crypts. They were first characterized as products of cDNAs derived from mouse small intestinal RNA. To date, over 25 cryptdin-encoding transcripts have been described. Despite the expression of a relatively large number of cryptdin isoforms, only 6 cryptdins have been isolated at the protein level. Conventional nomenclature labels the isoforms cryptdins-1 through -6 in order of discovery. The primary structures of cryptdin isoforms are highly homologous. Most differences between the isoforms lie in the identity of residues at the N- and C-termini.
Structural features.
Like other alpha-defensins, cryptdins are small, 32-36 amino acid long cationic peptides. They possess 6 conserved cysteines that form a tridisulfide array with an arrangement of cysteine pairings that typify alpha-defensins. Cryptdins also display a secondary and tertiary structure that is dominated by a three-stranded beta-sheet. The topology that arises from this structure is an amphipathic globular form in which the termini are paired opposite a pole including a cluster of cationic residues.
Gene structure and expression.
Genes encoding cryptdins are located on the proximal arm of mouse chromosome 8. They are similar to other enteric alpha-defensins genes in that they involve a two exon structure. The first exon encodes an N-terminal canonical signal peptide and proregion that is present in the cryptdin precursor. The processed, mature peptide is encoded by the second exon which is separated from the first exon by a ~500 bp intron. 
Biosynthesized as precursors possessing an anionic, N-terminal proregion, cryptdins are packaged into the apically-directed secretory granules of Paneth cells. During this process and perhaps succeeding it, the precursors are cleaved by matrix metalloproteinase-7 (matrilysin; MMP-7). As a result of this proteolysis, the C-terminal mature form is released from the proregion.
Functional characteristics.
With the ability to kill gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, fungi, spirochetes and some enveloped viruses, cryptdins are classified as broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptides. Although it is the least expressed of the six isoforms, cryptdin-4 is the most bactericidal. Procryptdins, however, are nonbactericidal and thus require degradation of the proregion by MMP-7 for activation. In response to bacterial antigens, Paneth cells release their secretory granules into the lumen of intestinal crypts. There, cryptdins, along with other antimicrobial peptides expressed by Paneth cells, contribute to enteric mucosal innate immunity by clearing the intestinal crypt of potential invading pathogens.

Pseudo-Bonaventura

The Pseudo-Bonaventura, or Pseudo-Bonaventure is the name given to the authors of a number of medieval devotional works which were believed at the time to be the work of Saint Bonaventure: "It would almost seem as if 'Bonaventura' came to be regarded as a convenient label for a certain type of text, rather than an assertion of authorship". Since it is clear a number of actual authors are involved, the term "Pseudo-Bonaventuran" is often used. Many works now have other attributions of authorship which are generally accepted, but the most famous, the Meditationes Vitae Christi, remains usually described only as a work of the Pseudo-Bonaventura.

The assault on Bogoro, which occurred on February 24, 2003, was an attack on the village of Bogoro in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) by the Nationalist and Integrationist Front (FNI) and the Front for Patriotic Resistance of Ituri (FRPI). The attackers allegedly went on an "indiscriminate killing spree", killing at least 200 civilians, imprisoning survivors in a room filled with corpses, and sexually enslaving women and girls. Two rebel leaders, Germain Katanga and Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui, have been charged by the International Criminal Court with war crimes and crimes against humanity over their alleged role in planning the attack.
Background.
Bogoro is a village in Ituri Province, in the north-east of the DRC. Between 1999 and 2003, Ituri was the scene of a violent conflict between the Lendu, Ngiti and Hema ethnic groups. The Hema-dominated Union of Congolese Patriots (UPC) seized control of Bunia, the district capital, in August 2002.
Bogoro was a strategically important town on the road between Bunia and the border with Uganda, with a UPC military camp in the middle of the town. The attack aimed to drive the UPC from Bogoro, but it also appeared to be a "reprisal operation against the Hema civilian population". It was part of a plan by Lendu and Ngiti rebels to attack predominantly Hema villages in preparation for an assault on Bunia.
Attack.
On 24 February 2003, hundreds of FNI and FRPI fighters — including children under the age of fifteen — attacked Bogoro with machetes, spears, arrows, mortars, rocket-propelled grenades, rocket launchers and semi-automatic weapons. According to the ICC, they circled the village and "converged towards the centre on a killing spree", killing at least 200 civilians, imprisoning survivors in a room filled with corpses, and sexually enslaving women and girls. Some residents of the village were killed by setting their houses on fire, others were hacked to death with machetes. The UN reported that 173 of the victims were under the age of 18.
UPC leader Thomas Lubanga claimed that 400 people were killed and 500 were missing after the attack. "The civilian population was very, very coldly massacred," he said.
The attack succeeded in pushing UPC forces out of Bogoro within a few hours and, ten days later, the Lendu and Ngiti drove the UPC from Bunia.
International Criminal Court proceedings.
In March 2004, the DRC government referred the situation in the country to the International Criminal Court (ICC). In July 2007, the Court found that there were reasonable grounds to believe that two rebel leaders, Germain Katanga and Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui, bore individual criminal responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the Bogoro attack, and issued sealed warrants for their arrest. Both men were charged with six counts of war crimes (willful killing; inhuman treatment or cruel treatment; using children under the age of fifteen years to participate actively in hostilities; sexual slavery; intentionally directing attacks against civilians; and pillaging) and three counts of crimes against humanity (murder, inhumane acts and sexual slavery). They are alleged to have ordered their fighters to "wipe out" the village of Bogoro.
Katanga, who had been held by the Congolese authorities since March 2005, was transferred to the ICC in October 2007. Ngudjolo was arrested by the Congolese authorities on 6 February 2008 and surrendered to the ICC. The two men will be tried jointly; the hearing to confirm the charges against them began on 27 June 2008.

Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement

Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement (CCI, Iowa CCI, occasionally ICCI) is a membership-based grassroots organization dedicated to community organizing in the state of Iowa.
CCI's stated mission is to "empower and unite grassroots people of all ethnic backgrounds to take control of their communities; involve them in identifying problems and needs and in taking action to address them; and be a vehicle for social, economic, and environmental justice."
CCI is a 501(c)(3) non-profit, affiliated with sister 501(c)(4) organization Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement Action Fund.
History.
CCI was formed in 1975 by a group of ministers in Waterloo, Iowa who felt Iowa needed an organization to fight for social justice issues. CCI began by focusing mainly on neighborhood-level organizing, but soon grew into a state-wide organization. Early issues addressed by CCI members included misuse of public funds, slum landlords, and the practice of redlining. Notable victories from the 1970s included the establishment of the Peoples Community Health Clinic in Waterloo, passage of the state-wide Iowa Uniform Residential Landlord and Tenant Act, and the state Neighborhood Revitalization Law.
As Iowans faced the Midwest farm crisis of the 1980s, CCI members added fights for justice in rural areas to their urban organizing. CCI members stopped farm foreclosures, renegotiated mortgages, and helped family farmers gain access to much-needed credit. In the 1990s, as agriculture began to be ever more tightly controlled by corporate interests with the appearance of factory farms and the mandatory pork checkoff, CCI members led their communities in fighting to save the rural way of life.
CCI made national news in August 2011 when members questioned Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney at a soapbox appearance at the Iowa State Fair, leading Romney to respond, "Corporations are people, my friend." Video footage of this remark was picked up by media outlets as an indication that Romney was out of touch with ordinary Americans.
Current campaigns.
CCI members continue to organize against factory farms today, but also work to regulate payday lending, institute public campaign financing in the form of Voter-Owned Iowa Clean Elections (VOICE), and defend the social safety net, among other campaigns to fight corporate power.
Many CCI members are also members of Iowa's growing Latino community. Issues addressed by CCI in this community include ending widespread wage theft and enacting sensible immigration reform.
Recognition.
John Nichols of "The Nation" named CCI the "most valuable grassroots advocacy group" of 2009.
CCI was featured on the final episode of "Bill Moyers Journal", where the group was described as "advocates for the people."

Alpha blocker

Alpha-blockers, α-blockers, or α-adrenergic-antagonists are pharmacological agents that act as receptor antagonists of α-adrenergic receptors (α-adrenoceptors).
Classification.
When the term "alpha blocker" is used without further qualification, it sometimes refers to α1-blockers, and sometimes refers to agents that act at both types of receptors.
Examples of non-selective α-adrenergic blockers include:
Selective α1-adrenergic blockers include:
Selective α2-adrenergic blockers include:
The agents carvedilol and labetalol are both α- and β-blockers.
Uses.
α-Blockers are used in the treatment of several conditions, such as Raynaud's disease, hypertension, and scleroderma.
α-Blockers can also be used to treat anxiety and panic disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
While most commonly used to treat hypertension (usually in conjunction with diuretics when other treatments are ineffective), they are also often used to treat the symptoms of BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia).
Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists, such as clonidine and guanfacine, act at noradrenergic autoreceptors (presynaptic) to inhibit the firing of cells in the locus ceruleus, effectively reducing the release of brain norepinephrine. Clonidine has shown promise among patients with Anxiety, Panic and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder aka PTSD in clinical trials and was used to treat severely and chronically abused and neglected preschool children. It improved disturbed behavior by reducing aggression, impulsivity, emotional outbursts, and oppositionality. The following Sleep disorders of Insomnia along with the Parasomnia disorders of Nightmares and /or Night Terrors aka pavor nocturnus were all reported to be reduced.
Kinzie and Leung prescribed the combination of clonidine and imipramine to severely traumatized Cambodian refugees with Anxiety, Panic and PTSD. Global symptoms of PTSD were reduced among sixty-six percent and nightmares among seventy-seven percent. Guanfacine brand name Tenex produces less sedation than clonidine and thus may be better tolerated. Guanfacine reduced the trauma-related nightmares. A recently completed randomized double-blind trial among veteran patients with chronic PTSD showed that augmentation with guanfacine was associated with improvement in anxiety and PTSD.
Prazosin aka Minipress is an alpha1-receptor antagonist. Raskind and colleagues studied the efficacy of prazosin for PTSD among Vietnam combat veterans in a 20-week double-blind crossover protocol with a two-week drug washout to allow for return to baseline. The CAPS and the Clinical Global Impressions-Change scale (CGI-C) were the primary outcome measures. Patients who were taking prazosin had a robust improvement in overall sleep quality (effect size, 1.6) and recurrent distressing dreams (effect size, 1.9). In each of the PTSD symptom clusters the effect size was medium to large: 0.7 for reexperiencing or intrusion, 0.6 for avoidance and numbing, and 0.9 for hyperarousal. The reduction in CGI-C scores (overall PTSD severity and function at endpoint) also reflected a large effect size (1.4). Prazosin appears to have promise as an effective treatment for PTSD-related sleep disturbance, including trauma-related nightmares, as well as overall Anxiety and PTSD symptoms.

Jackie Oakes

Jackie Oakes (6 December 1919 – 3 December 1995) was a Scottish footballer who played for Wolverhampton Wanderers, Queen of the South, Blackburn Rovers and Manchester City. Born in Hamilton, South Lanarkshire, his position was left winger. He died three days before his 76th birthday.
Wolverhampton Wanderers.
Oakes started his senior football career in England with Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1935 signed by Major Frank Buckley. From official club records there is no mention of any first team appearances for Oakes whilst he was at Wolverhampton Wanderers.
Queen of the South (first spell).
In 1936, Oakes signed for Dumfries club Queen of the South for the first time signed by George McLachlan. Players at the club during this time included Willie Savage, Willie Culbert, Willie Ferguson, Joe Tulip and Irish international Laurie Cumming.
His Queens career began with a reserve game against Third Lanark on Christmas Day 1936. His first team debut was on 24 April 1937 with a hint of irony by playing Hamilton Academical. Willie Ferguson had recently become the Queen of the South manager. Oakes at this point played on the right wing despite being ultimately known for playing on the left flank.
Taking a pass from Phil Watson, the mighty Oakes opened the scoring in Queens 1937–38 season ending 3–2 victory against Rangers at Ibrox Park, Queens first ever league win against Rangers. Jackie Law scored the other two Queens goals that day.
Oakes was at Queens under Jimmy McKinnell Snr when they finished sixth in the league in 1939.
Blackburn Rovers.
Oakes joined Blackburn Rovers in February 1947 after turning down Manchester City. Blackburn Rovers paid £26,000 on three players in an attempt to buy the club out of relegation trouble. These players were Jock Weir, Frank McGorrigan and Oakes.
Oakes made his debut for Blackburn Rovers in the 1–1 draw at home to Derby County on 15 February 1947. He was an ever-present for the remainder of the season, making a total of 16 appearances and scoring two goals. His first goal for the club came against that season's eventual league champions, Liverpool F.C., in a 2–1 defeat at Anfield on 8 March 1947. Oakes' second goal that season came in the 2–0 win against Chelsea F.C. at Stamford Bridge on 4 April 1947.
In season 1947–48, Oakes made 19 appearances in the league and two in the FA Cup, both against West Ham United He scored seven league goals. His first of the season was also his first at Ewood Park, in the 4–0 win over Grimsby Town F.C. on 20 September 1947. He scored a penalty in the 3–1 win at Maine Road against Manchester City a week later and then made it three goals in as many games after scoring in the 3–2 defeat at home to Preston North End F.C. on 4 October 1947. He scored twice, one being a terrific 13th minute dribble and drive and the other a penalty, as Blackburn Rovers defeated Bolton Wanderers 4–0 on 1 November 1947. He then scored the only goals in defeats to Middlesbrough F.C. at home on 29 November 1947 and at Goodison Park against Everton F.C. on 20 December 1947. His final appearance for Blackburn Rovers came in the 2–1 defeat at home to Liverpool F.C. on 10 April 1948.
In total Oakes played 35 league and two FA Cup games for Blackburn Rovers scoring 9 goals. Playing alongside many Blackburn Rovers stalwarts, his best known team mate was probably the England full back, Bill Eckersley. As Blackburn Rovers were relegated from the top tier of English football at the end of season 1947–48, Manchester City stepped in to keep Oakes in the top flight.
Manchester City.
Oakes joined Manchester City at the start of season 1948–49, where he lined up alongside Joe Fagan and also two highly distinguished goalkeepers in Frank Swift and Bert Trautmann. When at Manchester City things were never dull. In that first season he and his fellow Maine Road team mates improved on the previous season's 10th place by finishing 7th. In the F.A. Cup that season Manchester City were defeated in the third round by Everton F.C., now the club of Dumfries born forward Jimmy McIntosh. Manchester City found themselves in another relegation battle during season 1949–50. Near the season's end and battling for their top flight survival, Manchester City defeated Sunderland A.F.C. 2–1 and this ultimately cost Sunderland the title. Former Queen of the South player Ivor Broadis played for Sunderland at that particular time. Oakes scored the opening goal and this was the only double league defeat that Sunderland endured all season. This win, unfortunately, was not enough to save Manchester City from relegation.
Manchester City's visit to the second tier of English football, season 1950–51, was to be short lived, as they were promoted back to the top tier for the start of season 1951–52, as they finished runners-up to Preston North End. Oakes clocked up 77 league appearances in which he scored 9 goals.
Queen of the South (second spell).
Oakes rejoined Queen of the South in the summer of 1951 signed by Jimmy McKinnell Junior 
(McKinnell had replaced his father as manager in 1946 before Oakes' departure to England). Ahead of him lay many great times at Queen of the South, playing alongside in particular, goalkeeper Roy Henderson, the goals king of Queens Jim Patterson and sterling full backs Dougie Sharpe and Jimmy Binning. Bobby Black joined them a year later in 1952.
Oakes scored Queens goal in the game with the highest recorded attendance at Palmerston Park. On 23 February 1952 a staggering crowd of 26,552 squeezed very tightly in to see Queens play in a Scottish Cup third round 3–1 win for Hearts.
Late in his Queen of the South career, Oakes was joined by Ivor Broadis, previously of Oakes' tussles for Manchester City against Sunderland. Oakes played in the 7–1 win Boxing Day win against Queens Park F.C. in 1959. Ivor Broadis scored four of the goals in this match. Sir Alex Ferguson was the Queens Park scorer. Sir Alex Ferguson recalled this match recently by saying "The other reason to remember the game was the ages of the Queen of the South forward line, it probably averaged about 34! Black, Broadis, Patterson, Dunlop, Oakes. I remember it all too well."
Shortly after in February 1960, Oakes was joined on the playing staff by another ex-opponent from his days in England's top division, goalkeeper George Farm.
Twenty three years after his debut, Oakes played at Queens until aged 40 in 1960, clocking up a total of 457 games and 81 goals for the club. Oakes is the fourth highest in the club's record appearances list behind Allan Ball and Iain McChesney and in between team mates Jim Patterson and Dougie Sharpe. With the exception of his last season, all his time as a Queen of the South player was spent in Scotland's top flight. He then replaced Neil Gibson Junior to become the club trainer for three years.

Congregation Beth Israel (Worcester, Massachusetts)

Congregation Beth Israel () is an egalitarian Conservative congregation located at 15 Jamesbury Drive in Worcester, Massachusetts. Founded in 1924 as an Orthodox synagogue, it formally affiliated with the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism in 1949, and describes itself as the "leading Conservative congregation in Central Massachusetts."
The congregation first worshiped at a house on Pleasant Street; it constructed a synagogue building in its place in 1941. It completed its current location on Jamesbury Drive in 1959.
The congregation hired its first permanent rabbi in 1938. Subsequent rabbis have included Israel Chodos (1939-1942), Herbert Ribner (1948–1955), Abraham Kazis (1955–1971), Baruch Goldstein (1971–1986), and Jay Rosenbaum (1983–2003). In 1994, the synagogue and Rosenbaum were the subject of the book "And They Shall be My People: An American Rabbi and His Congregation" by Paul Wilkes.
Joel Pitkowsky succeeded Rosenbaum as rabbi in 2003. Pitkowski left in 2011 and was succeeded by Rabbi Steven Schwarzman. , the cantor was Elise Barber.
Early history.
Beth Israel was founded in 1924 as an Orthodox synagogue. The congregation initially worshiped at 835 Pleasant Street, in a house that had room for up to 75 worshipers. That same year it also founded a Sunday school.
Beth Israel hired its first permanent rabbi in 1938, and constructed its first building, on Pleasant Street (replacing the existing house) in 1941, at a cost of $42,000 (today $). The new building's sanctuary could accommodate 450 people. After World War II the congregation grew rapidly, from 242 member families in 1945, to 451 in 1953; by then the Hebrew school had 261 children in it. In 1945 the congregation voted to become Conservative, and in 1949 formally joined the United Synagogue of America (now United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism).
Herbert Ribner served as rabbi from 1948 to 1955, and was followed by Abraham Kazis in 1955. In 1957, Beth Israel was the second largest of Worcester's eleven Jewish congregations, with 532 member families; the largest, the Reform Temple Emanuel, had 1,340 member families (42 families were members of both).
Jamesbury Drive building.
In 1953, Beth Israel purchased of land on Jamesbury Drive for $42,000 (today $), and began construction of their current building on it in 1958. Completed in 1959, the building cost $735,000 (today $), of which over $300,000 (today $) was mortgaged. The building had a main sanctuary that sat 476, a chapel with seating for 110, and a social hall that could accommodate up to 950 people. For the High Holidays, the sanctuary could be expanded into the social hall, providing seating for 1,450. The mortgage was retired in 15 years. The structure at 835 Pleasant Street was sold on September 10, 1959 to the Orthodox Shaarai Torah Synagogue, to serve as its west side branch.
Kazis was succeeded as congregational rabbi by Baruch Goldstein in 1971. A native of Mława (then in East Prussia), Goldstein had been sent to Auschwitz concentration camp in 1942. His entire family perished in the Holocaust, but he survived and emigrated to the United States, where he became a rabbi.
Goldstein was succeeded by Jay Rosenbaum in 1986. A graduate of New York University and Rutgers University, he had been ordained by the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTSA) in 1980.
1990s to present.
In the early 1990s, the congregation still numbered around 530 member families. In 1994, the synagogue and Rosenbaum were the subject of the book "And They Shall be My People: An American Rabbi and His Congregation", the observations of Paul Wilkes, who had spent two and a half years with Rosenbaum and the congregation.
During that period, the synagogue operated with annual budget deficit, which had risen to $210,000 (today $). The board of directors raised annual dues from $650 (today $) to $950 (today $), but membership fell to 499 families, and Wilkes was concerned that Rosenbaum's job was threatened. By 1995, however, the deficit had been eliminated, and Rosenbaum was signed to a new three-year contract.
In the fall of 2001, Hazzan Devin Goldenberg was elected the Congregation's cantor, succeeding Hazzan Stephen Freedman. When Rabbi Rosenbaum left to lead Herzl-Ner Tamid Congregation in Mercer Island, Washington in the Spring of 2002, Hazzan Goldenberg continued to lead the Congregation alone until the Fall of 2003 when he was joined by Rabbi Joel Pitkowsky. Rabbi Pitkowsky, a graduate of Rutgers University and who received his ordination at the JTSA in 2001, had served as assistant rabbi of Conservative Synagogue Adath Israel of Riverdale before joining Beth Israel. Marina Shemesh joined as cantor in 2004. She was succeeded in 2010 by Elise Barber, a fifth year cantorial student at Hebrew College.
, Steven Schwarzman was the rabbi, and the cantor was Barber.

Congregation Beth Israel (Milwaukee)

Congregation Beth Israel () is an egalitarian Conservative synagogue located at 6880 North Green Bay Road in Glendale, Wisconsin, a suburb north of Milwaukee.
Founded in 1884 as Congregation B'ne Jacob, the congregation split, re-amalgamated, and went bankrupt before re-organizing as Beth Israel in 1901. The synagogue building it constructed on Teutonia Avenue in 1925, and sold in 1959, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. The current building was constructed in three phases, completed in 1962, 1966, and 1980.
Solomon Scheinfeld was the congregation's first permanent rabbi, serving in 1892, and again from 1902 until his death in 1943. Herbert Panitch joined Beth Israel as rabbi in 1970, and served until his retirement in 1995. Jacob Herber became rabbi in 2003.
Early years.
In 1884 Congregation B'ne Jacob was formed in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. By 1886 it had split into two congregations, Moses Montefiore Gemeinde and Anshe Jacob. In 1891 they re-amalgamated, creating Beth Hamedrash Hagadol, and the following year hired Solomon Isaac Scheinfeld as the congregation's first permanent rabbi. Scheinfeld had been born in Lithuania in 1860, and had moved to Milwaukee soon after receiving "semicha" in 1890. He stayed less than a year before moving to Kentucky.
The congregation completed a new synagogue building at 462 Fifth Street in 1893, but was unable to afford the mortgage, and in 1900 the courts foreclosed on the property. The following year the congregation was re-organized as Congregation Beth Israel and re-acquired the synagogue building on Fifth Street, and in 1902 Scheinfeld was re-hired as rabbi. By 1918, the synagogue had 108 member families, and annual revenues of $7,000 (today $). 
Scheinfeld served as Beth Israel's rabbi until his death in 1943. During his tenure, he established a "maot chitim" (literally "money for wheat") fund, to provide for the needs of Milwaukee Jews too poor to afford food for the Passover Seder. That fund continued after his death as the "Rabbi Solomon I. Scheinfeld Moath Chitim Fund", and in 2003 distributed $20,000 worth of food to 600 families.
Teutonia building.
Beth Israel sold its Fifth Street building in 1924, and, after meeting in temporary quarters for a year, constructed a new building at 2432 North Teutonia Avenue. However, as the Jewish community of Milwaukee migrated north to suburbs in the 1940s and 1950s, the location became inconvenient. In 1957, a property was purchased at 6880 North Green Bay Avenue in Glendale, a suburb north of Milwaukee, and construction began on new facilities there in 1959. The Teutonia Avenue building was sold in 1959, and vacated in 1960. On March 5, 1992 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.
Move from Orthodox to Conservative Judaism.
Beth Israel was founded as an Orthodox synagogue, and its rabbi, Solomon Scheinfeld, also served as chief rabbi of the United Orthodox Congregations of Milwaukee. However, the congregation had done away with separate seating for men and women in 1920s or 30s; at the same time Beth Israel also instituted English language sermons. The congregation associated with the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, and eventually became fully egalitarian.
1960s to 1990s.
Beth Israel's current facilities were built in three phases. In 1962 a new school building was completed, and the congregation began holding services there. In 1966, the sanctuary building and social hall were completed and dedicated, and in 1980 work on the sanctuary was completed.
In 1970, Herbert Panitch joined Beth Israel from Congregation Agudath Achim in Altoona, Pennsylvania. He served as rabbi until his retirement in 1995.
Events since 2000.
Toronto native Mitchell Joshua Martin, a graduate of the cantorial school at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTSA), joined as cantor in 2002. In August, 2008, Fortunée Belilos joined as interim cantor. The following July, the synagogue hired as cantor Jeremy Stein, who had graduated that year from the JTSA's cantorial school.
Jacob Herber became rabbi of Beth Israel in August 2003. A graduate of the University of California, Davis, he was ordained by the JTSA in 1996. Before coming to Beth Israel, he served as assistant and then senior rabbi of Philadelphia's Har Zion Temple. His rabbinate there was a subject of the book "The New Rabbi" by Stephen Fried. Funded by congregation members and the Milwaukee Jewish Federation, Herber traveled to Uganda in July 2008 to assist in the Abayudaya in converting to Judaism. That year the congregation had 700 member families.
, Beth Israel was the only synagogue in Milwaukee associated with the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism. The rabbi was Jacob Herber, the rabbi emeritus was Herbert Panitch, the cantor was Jeremy Stein, and the president was Gayle Weber Rakita.

Beth Israel's first building still stands in Heritage Park, which is adjacent to Old Town San Diego State Historic Park. The wooden building was erected in 1889 at Second Avenue and Beech Street, in the wake of a boom in economic activity and population that resulted from the November 1885 completion of the California Southern Railroad connecting San Diego to the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad in Barstow, California. One of the oldest synagogue buildings in the American West, it was used by the Congregation until 1926, when the Congregation moved to its second, larger building at Third and Laurel. At the time the congregation numbered around 60 families.
The Third and Laurel site occupied a full city block, and included a number of structures. In addition to the synagogue building, there was an adjacent social hall, a school building, and number of small apartments. When the congregation moved in early 2001, it retained the school and social hall.
Beth Israel purchased a lot in University City in 1993. Construction on new facilities there began in January 2000 and were dedicated in October 2001. The site comprises five buildings totaling more than .

Temple Beth Israel (Eugene, Oregon)

Temple Beth Israel () is a Reconstructionist synagogue located at 1175 East 29th Avenue in Eugene, Oregon. Founded in the early 1930s as a Conservative congregation, Beth Israel was for many decades the only synagogue in Eugene.
The congregation initially worshipped in a converted house on West Eighth Street. It constructed its first building on Portland Street in 1952, and occupied its current LEED-compliant facilities in 2008.
In the early 1990s conflict between feminist and traditional members led to the latter leaving Beth Israel, and forming the Orthodox Congregation Ahavas Torah. Beth Israel came under attack from neo-Nazi members of the Volksfront twice, in 1994 and again in 2002. In both cases the perpetrators were caught and convicted.
Services were lay-led for decades. Marcus Simmons was hired as the congregation's first rabbi in 1959, but left in 1961. After a gap of two years, Louis Neimand became rabbi in 1963, and served until his death in 1976. He was followed by Myron Kinberg, who served from 1977 to 1994, and Kinberg in turn was succeeded by Yitzhak Husbands-Hankin. Maurice Harris joined Husbands-Hankin as rabbi in 2003, and served until 2011, when he was succeeded by Boris Dolin. , led by Husbands-Hankin and Dolin, Beth Israel had approximately 400 member households, and was the largest synagogue in Eugene.

Small numbers of German Jews began settling in Eugene in the late 19th century, but most moved on. In the early 20th century the first Eastern European Jews settled there, and by the 1920s Eugene's Jewish community began gathering prayer quorums for holding Friday night and Jewish holiday services in individuals' homes. Historian Steven Lowenstein writes that "fter Hymen Rubenstein's death in 1933, his home at 231 West Eighth Street was remodeled and named Temple Beth Israel". It was a traditional Conservative synagogue, and from that time until the 1990s it was the only synagogue in Eugene.
In 1952, the congregation constructed a one-story synagogue building on an almost property at 2550 Portland Street. Designed by architect and Holocaust-survivor Heinrich Hormuth (H.H.) Waechter, the building featured an interior courtyard that provided natural lighting, and "a network of ceiling beams painted with symbols and shapes" by Waechter.
Temple Beth Israel's services and religious functions were lay-led for decades. Its first rabbi was Marcus Simmons. Originally from England, he was a graduate of University of London and Oxford University, and was ordained at the Hebrew Theological Seminary. He emigrated to the United States in 1957, and joined Beth Israel in 1959. The members were not, however, agreed that a full-time rabbi was required, and in 1961, he accepted a rabbinical position in Downey, California.
Following a hiatus of two years, Louis Neimand was hired as rabbi in 1963. Born in New York City in 1912 to immigrant parents, he was a graduate of City University of New York and was ordained at the Jewish Institute of New York. He had previously worked for the United Jewish Appeal, and from 1959 to 1963 was the first rabbi at Syracuse University. There was some concern about Neimand's hiring, as he had a police record as a result of his involvement in freedom marches in the African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968). He served until his death in 1976.
Kinberg era.
Myron Kinberg was hired as rabbi in 1977. Ordained in the Reform movement, he had previously served as a rabbi in Topeka, Kansas for two years, then lived in Israel for two years, before coming to Eugene. Kinberg was known for his support for minority rights and gay rights, anti-nuclear and anti-war activism, support of reconciliation between Israel and the Palestinians, and outreach to non-observant members of Eugene's Jewish community.
Kinberg attempted to revive the Biblical concept of the ""ger toshav"" in his approach to intermarriage. He was willing to officiate at an intermarriage if the non-Jewish partner, after discussions with the rabbi, agreed of his or her own free will to fulfill a set of commitments, including "a commitment to a Jewish home life, participation in Jewish life and tradition, and raising future children as Jews". The non-Jewish partner making this commitment became a ""ger toshav"", or "non-Jewish member of the Jewish people".
Kinberg's wife Alice was a strong feminist, and during the 1980s he and his wife supported a number of changes to the liturgy and ritual. These included allowing women to read from the Torah and lead the prayers, and changing prayers to be more gender inclusive - for example, using gender-neutral terms and pronouns for God, and adding references to the Biblical matriarchs in prayers like the "Amidah", which traditionally only mentioned the Biblical patriarchs. While most congregation members approved of these changes, a minority resisted them.
Schism.
By the early 1990s serious divisions developed among the members of the congregation over a number of issues, including personal antagonisms, the rabbi's activism and "advocacy of 'ultra-liberal' causes", political differences over the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, and
a myriad of additional Jewish cultural/religious issues, such as the acceptance of intermarried couples, adherence to kosher dietary laws, the use of modern language and music during worship services, rewriting of certain prayers such as the "Aleynu" to make them less ethnocentric, and so on.
However, the biggest source of division, which underlay all others, was "the roles and rights of men and women in the synagogue."
In the early 1990s a group of newly observant members began holding more traditional services in a back room of the synagogue, complete with a "mechitza", a partition separating men and women. The "more feminist-minded" members strongly objected to having a "mechitza" anywhere in the Temple Beth Israel building, even if it were not in the services they attended. The latter group eventually circulated a petition which stated that either the "mechitza" would have to be taken down, or those members who wanted it would have to leave. Kinberg also signed the petition. Faced with this opposition, in 1992 the Orthodox members left, renting new premises and hiring their own rabbi, creating Eugene's second synagogue, originally called "The Halachic Minyan", and in 1998 renamed "Congregation Ahavas Torah".
Kinberg held himself responsible, and the schism led to his "reassessment of the needs of Temple Beth Israel and his role as a rabbi". As a result, he left Beth Israel in 1994 to lead a synagogue on Long Island. During his tenure at Beth Israel, membership rose from 118 to 350 families. Kinberg died two years later at age 51.
Husbands-Hankin era.
Yitzhak Husbands-Hankin succeeded Kinberg in 1995. Husbands-Hankin began his involvement at Temple Beth Israel first as a congregant, then as cantor, and then as an assistant rabbi. He was active in forming the Jewish Renewal movement, and was ordained by its leader Zalman Schachter-Shalomi.
The congregation decided to leave the Conservative movement in 1995, and for a year had no affiliation. In late 1996, after considering both Reform and Reconstructionist as alternatives, the congregation affiliated with the Reconstructionist movement. By 1999, membership had grown to around 370 families.
Husbands-Hankin was instrumental in developing the concept of "Ethical Kashrut", the idea that one should only purchase goods that are produced in an ethical way. His essay, "Ethical Kashrut," was selected for publication in Arthur Kurzweil's "Best Jewish Writing 2003". A singer, cello and guitar player, he composes and performs Jewish music.
Husbands-Hankin has had three assistant or associate rabbis working with him. Shoshana Spergel joined Temple Beth Israel in 1998 as interim rabbi when Husbands-Hankins went on a sabbatical; Jonathan Seidel was assistant rabbi from 2001 to 2003. Maurice Harris, a 2003 graduate of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College, joined as assistant rabbi in 2003. He is one of the signators of The Open Letter Concerning Religion and Science From American Rabbis, part of the Clergy Letter Project which "encourages and embraces the teaching of evolution in schools".
Attacks by neo-Nazis.
On March 20, 1994, Chris Lord, an individual associated with the Volksfront and American Front, fired ten rounds with an assault rifle into the temple, damaging the interior. The attacks were prompted by a newspaper article about several members of Eugene's Jewish community, including a lesbian. Community organizations, including a local gay rights group, responded by standing vigil outside the synagogue during Passover services. Lord and an associate were caught and convicted, and Lord was sentenced to four and a half years in prison.
On October 25, 2002 Jacob Laskey, his brother Gabriel Laskey, Gerald Poundstone, Jesse Baker, and one other man, all members of the Volksfront, drove to Beth Israel with the intent of intimidating the congregants. While a service with 80 members attending was taking place, the men threw rocks etched with Nazi swastikas through the synagogue's stained glass windows, then sped off. The men were caught, pleaded guilty, and were convicted. They served sentences ranging from a 6-month work release term and five years probation, to eleven years and three months in federal prison for the ringleader, Jacob Laskey.
East 29th Avenue building.
Originally sized for 75 families, Temple Beth Israel's Portland Street building had been renovated and enlarged over the years to to accommodate 250 families and 150 students. Despite these additions and the loss of members to Congregation Ahavas Torah, the synagogue was not large enough, particularly during the High Holidays, when extra space had to be rented. In 1997 the congregation purchased the property of the University Street Christian Church for $500,000 (today $), and began planning for a new facility. The members considered renovating the existing building on the property, but felt a new building would better suit their requirements, and razed the church.
In 2003 the congregation got a permit to begin construction of a new facility on the now-vacant plot of land at the northwest corner of East 29th Avenue and University Street. An initial capital campaign raised more than $1.8 million, which fully paid for the land, and by August 2007 an additional $1.7 million had been raised towards anticipated overall project costs of $5 million.
The environmentally sensitive building was designed by Mel Solomon and Associates of Kansas City and local company TBG Architects & Planners, and built by McKenzie Commercial Construction of Eugene. The building used "energy efficient heating, ventilation and lighting": specific design issues with the building's energy efficiency included the fact that the largest room in the building, the sanctuary, was also the least-used, and, in accord with Jewish tradition, had to face east (towards Jerusalem).
On June 8, 2008 the congregation dedicated its new building at 1175 East 29th Avenue. At approximately , the facility included a sanctuary, commercial kitchen, banquet facilities, and classrooms, and housed the synagogue, the Lane County Jewish Federation, and the local Jewish Family Service. The project ended up costing $6 million, of which $4 million had been raised.
Made of concrete, steel, and wood, the building achieved Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design compliance "through the integration of stormwater management strategies, high efficiency irrigation, the use of recycled and/or recyclable materials, and drought tolerant plantings." Completely recyclable materials used in the structure included carpeting and wood beams.
Recent events.
In 2008, Temple Beth Israel participated in Banners Across America, an "interfaith witness against torture coordinated by the National Religious Campaign Against Torture," as part of the Jewish Campaign Against Torture. Organized by Rabbis for Human Rights—North America in honor of Torture Awareness Month, the Jewish campaign included over 25 synagogues which hung banners protesting "the use of abusive interrogation techniques by the American military and intelligence community". That year, congregational membership reached almost 400 families, and the Talmud Torah and pre-school had about 200 and 40 students respectively.
The congregation sold the old synagogue building on Portland Street to Security First (Portland Street) Child Development Center for $815,000 in 2009, carrying the Center's financing. The building was converted for use as an educational center, while retaining some of the original architectural elements. Difficult economic conditions forced the Child Development Center to give up the building in 2011, and Eugene's Network Charter School planned to move into it in autumn 2011.
Harris announced he would be stepping down as rabbi in 2011, and the synagogue hired Boris Dolin as his successor. Born and raised on Oregon, Dolin had worked at Temple Beth Israel as a teacher and youth group adviser from 1999 to 2001. A graduate of the University of Oregon, with a master's degree in Jewish Education from the Jewish Theological Seminary, he was ordained by the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College.
, Temple Beth Israel was the largest synagogue in Eugene. It was a member of the Community of Welcoming Congregations, "an Oregon and SW Washington interfaith ministry and advocacy organization working toward full inclusion and equality for transgender, lesbian, bisexual, gay and questioning persons." The rabbis were Yitzhak Husbands-Hankin and Boris Dolin.

Bunurong Marine National Park is a protected national marine and coastal park located along and off the coast of Cape Paterson and Inverloch in South Gippsland, Victoria, Australia. The 5 km by 3 nm park is used for walking, picnicking, boating, education and research.
Bunurong Marine National Park is a state park in Cape Paterson and Inverloch and is about 21 km2 or about 5 km in length along the coast, stretching from 2.5 km east of Cape Paterson eastwards to a point 6 km south-west of Inverloch and extending seawards for 3 nm to the limit of Victorian waters. The restricted zone/state park (Bunurong Marine National Park inside Bunurong Marine Park), on foot begins after Undertow Bay heading towards Inverloch from Cape Paterson. It is an area on the coast, past Safety Beach and rockpool and past Undertow Bay beach namely; The Oaks, Twin Reefs, Shack Bay and Eagles Nest (beaches). It ends at Wreck Creek in Inverloch. Twin Reefs, Shack Bay and Eagles Nest are in Inverloch.
Bunurong Marine National Park is an outstretching middle section of Bunurong Marine PARK.
Bunurong Marine Park.
Bunurong Marine Park, also known as Bunurong Marine And Coastal Park, is a 17 km coastal park along the coast and reef of Harmers Haven, Cape Paterson and Inverloch, namely Coal Point (beach) to Wreck Creek. Bunurong Marine Park has the designated state park (Bunurong Marine National Park) in the middle of it.
Ecology.
The Bunurong Marine Parks are considered special due to the unusual set of environmental conditions. It supports many marine animals including seastars, featherstars, crabs, snails, 87 species of fish, whales and seals. It has the highest recorded diversity of intertidal and subtidal invertebrates in eastern Victoria. The range of seaweed species is large.
Restrictions.
It is prohibited to kill or take any matter (i.e., catch fish, collect seashells or kill or take any sea or land creature, living or dead) from the Bunurong Marine National Park, but fishing (only with a rod) is permitted in the Bunurong Marine Park, which is on either side of the National Park.
History.
Australia’s first dinosaur bone, the Cape Paterson Claw, was discovered in 1903 by William Ferguson at what is now Bunurong Marine Park at Eagles Nest beach in Inverloch. Since then more than 6000 bones and teeth of small dinosaurs, mammals, birds, turtles and fish have been excavated. There is a Dinosaur exhibibition at the Inverloch Shell Museum
Name.
The Bunurong parks are named after the Bunurong Aboriginal people whom were custodians of this stretch of coast for thousands of years prior to white settlement. The Boakoolawal clan lived in the Kilcunda area south of the Bass River, and the Yowenjerre were west of the Tarwin River along what is now the Bunurong Marine and Coastal Parks near Wonthaggi. Middens containing charcoal and shellfish mark the location of their campsites along the coast.
Attractions.
The principal feature of the park are the striking rock formations. Another feature of the park ia a large rock structure called Eagles Nest, located adjacent to the coastline at the eastern end of Bunurong Marine National Park. Eagles Nest also resembles the top half of a map of Australia. Other attractions include Flat Rocks where there are large rockpools for rockpooling/rockpool rambling and direct access from Cape Paterson-Inverloch Road. Bunurong Marine Park is accessed at many different points along this coast, a popular one being near Cape Paterson caravan park on Surf Beach Road as it has a modified rockpool for swimming. The National Park is around to the left. Direct and more difficult access to the National Park is via car parks off Cape Paterson-Inverloch Road. Exploring, snorkelling and scuba diving are popular. There are boat launching facilities at Inverloch on Anderson Inlet.

Cost Sports Center

"Not to be confused with Charles L. Cost Field."
The Charles L. Cost Sports Center is a multi-purpose indoor sports complex at the University of Pittsburgh and located at its upper campus area above and behind the Petersen Events Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Cost Sports Center sits on top of the seven-story University's Tower View Parking garage directly above Pitt's Trees Field, the university's former baseball and softball facilities as well as the school's intramural fields. The fields, planned to be converted into a new track and field complex, can be reached via elevator from within the Cost Sports Center. 
Designed by architectural firm Celli, Flynn, and Associates, ground was broken on February 9, 1989 and the Cost Sports Center opened in 1990 at a cost of $3.5 million ($ million today). The facility was named after three-sport letterman and former Pitt football running back Charles L. "Corky" Cost who donated an excess of $1 million ($ million today) for its construction.
Description.
Cost Sports Center is high and houses a regulation football field that can be converted into nine tennis courts or four indoor soccer fields. It features locker room facilities and a catwalk for filming or viewing practices.
Originally the primary indoor practice facility for the University's football team, since 2000 the football program has taken up primary residence at the UPMC Sports Performance Complex on Pittsburgh's South Side just across the Monongahela River from Pitt's campus. Prior to the opening of the UPMC Sports Performance Complex, the Cost Sports Center was also occasionally used by the Pittsburgh Steelers as an indoor practice facility. The Cost Center currently serves as an indoor practice facility for the Panthers' varsity baseball, softball, soccer, and track and field teams during inclement weather. It also is the site of the annual Blue and Gold inter-squad track and field meet. The baseball team has utilized it for workouts, batting practice, and to host winter Diamond Baseball Clinics, but has moved some activities into its new facilities across the street at the Petersen Sports Complex. The Cost Sports Center is also used by other varsity and club sports, as well as for intramural activities.
Injury.
On March 23, 1996, Pitt wide receiver Demale Stanley of Belle Glade, Florida crashed into a padded cement wall at the Cost Center resulting in a broken neck and quadriplegia. The incident resulted in an out-of-court settlement between Stanley and the University. Pitt's football team presents an annual Demale Stanley Award for Courage to an inspiring player.

Alpha-2 blocker

α2-blockers are a subset of the alpha blocker class of drugs and are antagonists to the α2 adrenergic receptor. They are mainly used in research, finding limited clinical application in human medicine. 
Uses.
Historically, yohimbine was used as an aphrodisiac, and is still sometimes used in veterinary medicine (although now largely replaced by atipamezole) for reversing the effects of alpha-2 agonists such as medetomidine which are used as sedatives during surgery. 
α2-blockers have found medical uses in treating depression; the tetracyclic antidepressants mianserin and mirtazapine are α2-blockers, although their efficacy as antidepressants may come from their activity at other receptor sites.
Mechanistically, α2-blockers significantly increase adrenergic, dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmitters, and induce insulin secretion and decreases blood sugar levels. 
Withdrawal from α2-blockers can be difficult or dangerous as the global down regulation of neurotransmitters may cause symptoms of depression and other neurological problems, and increased blood sugar levels together with decreased insulin sensitivity can cause diabetes. Reduced microcirculation together with adrenaline supersensitivity in organs such as liver can also be difficult problem when withdrawing from adrenergic blockers. 
Examples.
Examples include atipamezole, efaroxan, idazoxan, yohimbine, and rauwolscine.

Psi Sigma Phi

Psi Sigma Phi (ΨΣΦ) Multicultural Fraternity, the first fraternity in the United States founded under the ideal of multiculturalism, was founded December 12, 1990, at Montclair State University and New Jersey City University. The Eighteen Founding Fathers believed that multiculturalism is not indicative of the physical composition of an organization on a chapter or national level; it is viewed as a state of mind––a philosophy that embraces any and all aspects of cultural identity with unconditional respect and equality. 
About Psi Sigma Phi.
Psi Sigma Phi Multicultural Fraternity Inc. was co-founded on December 12, 1990, at Montclair State University and New Jersey City University (at the time Jersey City State College) as a service-oriented, multicultural organization. 
At the time of its founding, male college students could join only mainstream fraternities or fraternities that were predominantly Latin-American, African-American, or Asian-American. Psi Sigma Phi's founders created the fraternity to emphasize the importance of multiculturalism in the lives of college students.
Psi Sigma Phi's fraternal goal is to establish a unique bond among men of different cultures. This goal is to be accomplished through hard work, sacrifice and courage from all of its brothers - brothers who together strive to break social fears and ignorance.
Philanthropy.
Psi Sigma Phi's national philanthropy is the Kidney and Urology Foundation. Other services participated in on a national level include:

Tant Fant

Tant Fant is a two-player abstract strategy game from India. It is related to tic-tac-toe, but even more related to Tapatan, Three Men's Morris, Nine Holes, Achi, Shisima, and Dara, because pieces are moved on the board to create the 3 in-a-row. It is an alignment game. 
Tant Fant uses the same board as Tapatan and Achi, and have very similar rules and game play. The difference is that in Tant Fant the pieces are lined up initially on each player's side (referred to as "home row" in this article). Furthermore, player's cannot win with a 3 in-a-row formed with their own pieces in their home row. 
There are two versions to this game. The standard version allows a player to make any kind of 3 in-a-row (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) except in one's home row. The second version is more challenging, and allows only for diagonal 3 in-a-rows. 
Goal.
Version 1 (Standard): To create a 3 in-a-row of one's pieces either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 3 in-a-rows formed in the player's home row with their own pieces do not count. 
Version 2: To create a diagonal 3 in-a-row.
Equipment.
A 3 x 3 board is used. Three horizontal lines form the three rows. Three vertical lines form the three columns. Two diagonal lines connect the two opposite corners of the board. Each player has 3 pieces. One plays the black pieces, and the other plays the white pieces, however, any two colors or distinguishable objects will suffice.
The board is easily drawn on the ground or paper.
Rules and Game Play.
1. Players decide what colors to play, and who will start first. 
2. Each player's pieces are initially lined up on their side of the board called the home rank. 
3. Each piece can move one space at a time following the pattern on the board. Only one piece can be moved per turn.
4. 3 in-a-rows formed in player's home row with their own pieces do not count.
5. HOUSE RULES: These are rules that you and the other player can agree upon. They are not standard for the game. 
a) A stalemate where one player cannot make a move is cause for a draw of the game, or a loss to that player. 
b) Repeating a position three times can be cause for a draw.
Analysis.
Analysis has shown that the game is a draw with perfect play.

Alejandro Guanes

Alejandro Guanes was born in Asunción, Paraguay, November 28, 1872. He was son of Francisco Guanes and Matilde Recalde. 
He was a poet, prose-writer, teacher and journalist. While still a teenager, he traveled to Buenos Aires, Argentina, to continue his studies at the San José High School of the capital. There he released his first poems, "Primavera" (Spring) among them, that was dedicated to his far and beloved country.
First steps and career.
Back to his country, he collaborated with journals and magazines, among them the "Paraguayan Institute Magazine" that, influenced by Guanes, included permanently a section devoted to poetry of young authors like Ignacio A. Pane, Juan E. O'Leary, Guanes himself among the local, and of foreigners like Victorino Abente y Lago and Martín de Goycochea Menéndez. He cultivated the journalistic satyr using the alias of "Uncle Camándulas". He was redactor of "El Diario", "La Tribuna" and "El Orden", important journals related to the so-called "Paraguayan Novecentism", an aural movement and with great literary production in the Paraguay of that times.
He taught "Literary Preceptive" in the National High School of the Capital and translated English and Portuguese literature to the Spanish. One of the most famous was the poem "Ulalime" from Edgar Allan Poe.
He wrote when the memories of the Paraguayan War (1864–1870) were still fresh, and his poetry tries to settle down the spiritual values of a nation after the catastrophe.
In a prolix study about "The romantic modernist cycle in Paraguay", Juan Manuel Marcos says that Guanes "Died without publishing a single book, and without giving the title of the ones published after his death: 'Del viejo saber olvidado' (Of the old forgotten knowledge, 1926), essays of theosophic tendency, a mythic isle in the middle of the positivism, and 'De paso por la vida' (Passing through the life, 1936), post-romantic poems inspired in Lamartine, Musset, Espronceda, Zorrilla. His poem 'Las leyendas' (The Legends, 1909) calls out the Paraguayan traditions. 'Salve, Patria' (Hail Fatherland) motivates to the nation to stand up, majestically, its 'now beaten head', 'Primavera' (Spring) is the poem of the nostalgic youth, far away from the country. The intense lyricism of Guanes don't dissimulates the 'patriotic passion' common in every novecentist". "Del viejo saber olvidado" reunites his production in prose and "De paso por la vida" the poethic.
Hugo Rodríguez-Alcalá, in his “Paraguayan Literature” says: "His most representative poem, 'The Legends', is an impressive evocation of the ancient house of his ancestors that revives the most tragic moments of the history of his family. In this poem, and in another entitled 'Ocaso y aurora' (Sunset and Aurora), Guanes reveals to be a writer representative of his time..."
In 1984, Editorial Alcándara published a Poetic Anthology with the best of his literary production. In the presentation of the book could be read: "Bordering between the late romanticism and the initial approaches to the Paraguayan poetic modernism, the scarce but refined work from Alejandro Guanes [...] drops a tenuous crepuscular illumination through a hole generation of national writers. From the penumbra of the pain, dressed of invincible memories, with the evidence of the immortal luck that darkly motivates the precarious palpitation of men, the poet named his time and his people, never forgetting a raised love to the fatherland, the scenario of unfortunate blood that occupied his youth".
Carlos R. Centurión on his impressive "History of the Paraguayan literature" says that "Alejandro Guanes, in the first decade of the 20th Century, wrote "La cámara oscura" (The Dark Chamber", a dramatic comedy that never released".
The illustrate man of the Paraguayan theater, José Luís Ardissone, released a play based on the life of Guanes entitled "Caserón de añejos tiempos" (House of older times), like one of the verses of the emblematic "The Legends". This play was recorded and diffused profusely.
Last years.
Married with Serviliana Molinas, he died May 28, 1925, at the age of 52.

Pietro Maletti

Pietro Maletti (24 May 1880 – 9 December 1940) was an Italian military officer who participated in World War I, the subjugation of Italian North Africa, the Italo-Abyssinian War, and World War II. He was killed in action during the early stages of the North Africa Campaign.
Early life.
Pietro Maletti was born in Castiglione delle Stiviere, Province of Mantua, Lombardy, Kingdom of Italy. 
In 1898, Maletti volunteered for the Italian Royal Army ("Regio Esercito"). In 1904, he was admitted to the Military Academy of Modena. 
In 1909, Maletti was promoted to Lieutenant ("Tenente") and, in 1914, he was promoted to Captain ("Capitano").
World War I and Libya.
Maletti participated in World War I but, in August 1917, he was sent to Libya. With only a few brief postings elsewhere, Maletti remained in Italian North Africa ("Africa Settentrionale Italiana", or ASI) until 1934 to quell Libyan resistance there. In 1926, he was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel ("Tenente Colonnello") and, in November of that year, Maletti returned to Italy for a short period of time. In 1931,may be after his participation in the campaign aiming Kufra under Rodolfo Graziani in January that year, he was promoted to Colonel ("Colonnello").
Ethiopia.
In May 1934, Maletti again returned to Italy. But, in January 1935, he was transferred to Italian Somaliland for the Italian invasion of Ethiopia. He fought throughout the campaign on the "southern front" under the overall command of General Rodolfo Graziani. Maletti earned a promotion to Brigadier-General ("Generale di Brigata").
Prior to the Battle of Genale Doria, Maletti commanded a flying column which was sent to attack a group of retreating Ethiopians. His pursuit ended when the Ethiopians were joined by a relief column and then turned on Maletti. Both sides claimed victory after some confused fighting. 
After Ethiopia was defeated, Maletti stayed in Italian East Africa ("Africa Orientale Italiana", or AOI) until April 1937. He assumed the command of the 2nd Colonial Brigade.
World War II.
In June 1938, Maletti was promoted to the rank of Major General ("Generale di divisione"). In 1939, he was intended to assume command of the 28 Infantry Division Aosta. 
On 10 June 1940, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini declared war on Britain and France. On 22 June, France fell and signed an armistice. British-occupied Egypt became the focus of the Italian forces in Libya. Maletti was diverted from his intended command and returned to North Africa ("Africa Settentrionale"). In Libya, he took command of a special "ad hoc" grouping of motorized infantry and tanks which was called the "Maletti Group" ("Raggruppamento Maletti").
In September 1940, Maletti commanded this "ad hoc" group during the Italian invasion of Egypt. After initially becoming lost whilst making his way to the staging area, he advanced into Egypt and occupied fortified positions near Sidi Barrani. 
On 9 December 1940, Maletti was killed in action at the fortified Nibeiwa Camp when British forces counterattacked during the early stages of Operation Compass. The destruction of the Maletti Group is described by Walker in "Iron Hulls, Iron Hearts":
Walker's indication that none of the Italian artillery were able to penetrate the armour of the Matilda tanks is confirmed by the war diaries of the British Armored regiments and the British official histories which show that only a single Matilda was knocked out. Research by Sadkovich erroneously says that the Maletti Group's anti-amour guns were able to destroy 35 out of 57 Matildas prior to their own destruction.
Also Walker's statement that Maletti was "caught completely off guard" should be revised. On January 8 Maletti had already correctly alerted the nearby 2nd Libyan Division that the unusual low-level flying activity by the RAF was probably intended to mask the movement of armoured units and at 06.30 January 9th (well before the beginning of the actual main assault) he was already in contact with the commanders of both the 1st and 2nd Libyan Divisions reporting the British preparatory movements. In reality Maletti was killed at about 09.00 AM, while directing the fire from a 47/32 anti-tank guns section on the northern sector of the Nibeiwa strongpoint.

Wiscoy Creek

Wiscoy Creek is a stream, approximately 15 miles long, in western New York in the United States. It is a tributary of the Genesee River and joins that river in the town of Hume in northern Allegany County. The Wiscoy originates from two branches in Wyoming County. The North Branch begins in the township of Wethersfield and the West Branch originates in the township of Eagle. The branches meet in the hamlet of Bliss and flow southeast through the village of Pike. The creek's name is derived from the Seneca tribe word meaning "five falls creek."
Trout Fishing.
Nursed by cold springs, the water temperature in this stream rarely exceeds 70 degrees, enabling the Wiscoy to provide good trout fishing all season long. The stream is managed almost exclusively as a wild trout fishery; the only stretch that is stocked is a 1-mile section in Allegany County. Recent NYSDEC surveys estimate an impressive 1,600 adult wild brown trout per stream mile in the Wyoming County section of Wiscoy Creek. The stream is not known for producing large trout due to the high number of fish overall, however a 19 inch fish was captured in the 2006 survey. Anglers have abundant access to this 22 mile long stream with 12.5 miles of public fishing easements, 12 angler footpaths and three angler parking areas. Other areas are open by landowner permission.

First-hitting-time model

In statistics, first-hitting-time models are a sub-class of survival models. The first hitting time, also called first passage time, of a set formula_1 with respect to an instance of a stochastic process is the time until the stochastic process first enters formula_1.
Examples.
A common example of a first-hitting-time model is a ruin problem, such as Gambler's ruin. In this example, an entity (often described as a gambler or an insurance company) has an amount of money which varies randomly with time, possibly with some drift. The model considers the event that the amount of money reaches 0, representing bankruptcy. The model can answer questions such as the probability that this occurs within finite time, or the mean time until which it occurs.
First-hitting-time models can be applied to expected lifetimes, of patients or mechanical devices. When the process reaches an adverse threshold state for the first time, the patient dies, or the device breaks down.
First passage time of a 1D Brownian Particle.
The probability density function (PDF) for a particle in one dimension is found by solving the one-dimensional diffusion equation. (This equation states that the position probability density diffuses out over time. It is analogous to say, cream in a cup of coffee if the cream was all contained within some small location initially. In the long time limit the cream has diffused throughout the entire drink evenly.)
given the initial condition formula_4; where formula_5 is the position of the particle at some given time, formula_6 is the tagged particle's initial position, and formula_7 is the diffusion constant with the S.I. units formula_8 (an indirect measure of the particle's speed). The bar in the argument of the instantaneous probability refers to the conditional probability. The diffusion equation states that the speed at which the probability for finding the particle at formula_5 is position dependent.
It can be shown that the one-dimensional PDF is
This states that the probability of finding the particle at formula_5 is Gaussian, and the width of the Gaussian is time dependent. More specifically the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) - technically, this is actually the Full "Duration" at Half Maximum as the independent variable is time - scales like
Using the PDF one is able to derive the average of a given function, formula_13, at time formula_14:
where the average is taken over all space (or any applicable variable).
The "First Passage Time Density" (FPTD) is the probability that a particle has "first" reached a point formula_16 at time formula_14. This probability density is directly calculable from the "Survival probability" (a more common probability measure in statistics). The Survival probability is calculated from the PDF, namely
which is the probability that a particle is still at a position formula_19 at time formula_14.(The subscript c for the absorption point formula_16 is an abbreviation for "cliff" used in many texts as an analogy to an absorption point.) The relation between the Survival probability and the FPTD is as follows(the probability that a particle has reached the absorption point between times formula_14 and formula_23 is formula_24. If one uses the first-order Taylor approximation, the definition of the FPTD follows):
By working through the relevant mathematics (using a technique known as the Method of Images - borrowed from Electrodynamics), the explicit FPTD is
For formula_27, it follows from above that
where formula_29. This equation states that the probability for a Brownian particle achieving a first passage at some long time
(defined in the paragraph above) becomes increasingly small, but always finite.
The first moment of the FPTD diverges (as it is a so-called "heavy-tailed" distribution), therefore one cannot calculate the average FPT, so instead, one can calculate the
"typical" time, the time when the FPTD is at a maximum (formula_30), i.e.
Latent vs observable.
In many real world applications, the process is latent, or unobservable. When first hitting time models are equipped with regression structures, accommodating covariate data, we call such regression structure "Threshold regression". The threshold state, parameters of the process, and even time scale may depend on corresponding covariates.
A first-hitting-time (FHT) model has two underlying components: (1) a "parent stochastic process" formula_32, and (2) a "threshold". The first hitting time is defined as the time when the stochastic process first reaches the threshold. It is very important to distinguish whether the sample path of the parent process is latent (i.e., unobservable) or observable, and such distinction is a characteristic of the FHT model. By far, latent processes are most common. To give an example, we can use a Wiener process formula_33 as the parent stochastic process. Such Wiener process can be defined with the mean parameter formula_34, the variance parameter formula_35, and the initial value formula_36.

Glen E. Conrad

Glen Edward Conrad (born 1949) is a U.S. district judge on the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia and a former federal judicial nominee to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.
Background.
Born and raised in Radford, Virginia, Conrad was the son of an elementary school teacher mother and a father who worked in the post office. Conrad earned a bachelor's degree from the College of William and Mary in 1971, where he wrote his senior thesis on the Republican Party. While writing that thesis, Conrad met James C. Turk, the federal district judge whom he eventually would succeed on the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia.
Conrad then earned a law degree from the College of William and Mary's Marshall-Wythe School of Law in 1974.
Conrad's first job was as an interpreter/host at Colonial Williamsburg in 1974. He then worked as a U.S. probation officer for the Western District of Virginia from 1975 until 1976. 
In 1976, Conrad became a U.S. magistrate for the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia. He served in that capacity until 2003. Conrad applied for a federal judgeship in 1990.
On April 28, 2003, President George W. Bush nominated Conrad to become a U.S. district judge for the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia. "I felt like I had done just about all I could do with the responsibilities I had," Conrad told the Roanoke Times. The U.S. Senate confirmed Conrad in an 89-0 vote on September 22, 2003. Conrad received his commission on September 24, 2003. Since 2010 he has served as chief judge.
Fourth Circuit nomination under Bush.
On May 8, 2008, President George W. Bush nominated Conrad to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, to fill the seat of H. Emory Widener, Jr., who had taken senior status in July 2007 (Widener died in September 2007). Bush had withdrawn the nomination of his previous choice for that seat, E. Duncan Getchell, after objections by both of Virginia's senators. Previous to Getchell, from September 2003 until January 2007, William J. Haynes, II had been nominated to the seat, but his nomination had met stiff opposition from Senate Democrats over the role he had played during his tenure as the general counsel of the United States Department of Defense in the formulation of rules concerning the use of torture in Iraq. Eventually, Haynes withdrew his nomination. Conrad's nomination to the Fourth Circuit expired upon the end of President Bush's presidency in January 2009.
Personal.
Conrad's wife, Mary Ann, is active in the Republican Party.

Early life and Military career.
R.D. Mehta was born into a family of Muhiyal brahmins.
"Indian Express" states that he was a math wizard in his younger days. He joined the Indian Army in 1976 and went on to become a highly rated officer. His selection as Defence Attaché in Kabul is said to have followed an intensive screening process that shortlists the candidate pool to unofficially the "top three" officers of the Indian Army, prior to making the final selection for the job .
He had proficiency in many languages including Pashto, Mandarin and Tibetan. His work as defence attache in Kabul was praised in both Indian media and Pakistani media. In the words of a columnist of the "Dawn newspaper", he was: 
It is speculated that he was targeted, allegedly by the Taliban and the ISI, due to his significant role in training the Afghan army and his close monitoring of the re-established links between Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) and the Taliban. He was said to have a "good relationship" with Afghan defense minister Abdul Rahim Wardak. Brig. Mehta had earlier also served as the head of the Indian Army's Intelligence Corps in the state of Jammu and Kashmir.
Legacy and honours.
A road in his hometown Simla near his childhood home is now named after him. He is also slated to be posthumously awarded the Kirti Chakra, India's second-highest peacetime gallantry award. His funeral was attended by Chief of Army Staff General Deepak Kapoor, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Suresh Mehta and Chief of the Air Staff Fali Homi Major.
Brigadier Mehta's wife was also working in Afghanistan for empowerment of women during his stay there. Brigadier Mehta has a son who is also serving in the Indian Air Force as a fighter pilot.

Francis Cassidy QC (17 January 1827 – 14 June 1873) was a Canadian lawyer and politician, the Mayor of Montreal, Quebec for three months in 1873, until his term was cut short by death.
Cassidy was born at Saint-Jacques-de-l’Achigan, in what is today Quebec's Montcalm Regional County Municipality, Quebec. Despite spending childhood in a poor family, he attended Collège de l’Assomption with the support of Abbé Étienne Normandin. He began legal studies in Montreal, formally becoming a lawyer on 18 August 1848. After developing a distinguished legal career, he was designated Queen's Counsel on 5 August 1863.
He was a founder of the Institut canadien de Montréal and served as its president between 1849 and 1850 and again between 1857 and 1858. From 1871 to 1873, he served as a Conservative member for Montréal-Ouest riding during the first portion of the 2nd Legislative Assembly of Quebec.
Just months after becoming Montreal's uncontested mayor in February 1873, Cassidy died in office that June. He never married.

<doc id="18485056" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18485056" title="USS Utowana (SP-951)">
USS Utowana (SP-951)

USS "Utowana" (SP-951) – also known as USS "Victorine" (SP-951) -- was a fishing trawler acquired by the U.S. Navy during World War I. The Navy had planned to use her as a minesweeper based out of Kittery, Maine; however, "Utowana" spent most of her service time operating as an armed patrol craft, responsible for escorting Allied ships across the dangerous North Atlantic Ocean. She served through the war and the armistice before returning to the United States for decommissioning.
A yacht built in Philadelphia.
"Utowana" (SP-951) -- a yacht built in 1891 at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, by Neafle & Levy and rebuilt as a trawler at Staten Island, New York, in 1917 for the Commonwealth Fisheries Co., Boston, Massachusetts -- was acquired by the Navy during the summer of 1917 for service as a minesweeper in the 1st Naval District and placed in commission on 30 October 1917, Lt. Comdr. Reuben K. Dyer, NNV, in command.
World War I service.
Though some records indicate that the ship was later renamed "Victorine", they give no date for the renaming. Moreover, the trawler was consistently referred to thereafter as "Utowana" both in official and unofficial publications. 
In any event, the trawler was assigned to Division 13, Squadron 5, Patrol Force. That organization, made up various types of ships and craft, was responsible for patrol and escort duties overseas. In addition to the European bases such as Brest in France and Queenstown in Ireland, ships of the Patrol Force operated in such diverse areas as the Caribbean and the Azores. 
While no records have been found indicating where "Utowana" served before arriving on the French coast early in 1918, she operated briefly at Bermuda and perhaps for a short period at Ponta Delgada in the Azores. 
Crossing the Atlantic.
It is known that she departed Newport, Rhode Island, on 4 November 1917 in company with "Hannibal", "Helenita" (SP-210), "Margaret" (SP-527), "May" (SP-164), "Rambler" (SP-211), and "Wenonah" (SP-165). Each yacht towed a submarine chaser. After five days at sea and in spite of a breakdown apiece for "Margaret", "May", "Helenita" and "Utowana", the little task group arrived in Hamilton, Bermuda. 
Apparently, "Helenita" and "Utowana" remained behind in Bermuda when the other four yachts—augmented by "Cythera" (SP-575), "Artemis" (SP-593), and "Lydonia" (SP-700) departed Hamilton on 18 November bound for Ponta Delgada. Presumably, "Utowana" -- like "Helenita" -- stayed in Bermuda to conduct patrols in surrounding waters, though it is also possible that she remained behind for repairs. Records giving details simply do not exist.
In any event, the former yacht reached the French coast in February 1918. Thereafter, in all probability, she provided escort services to coastal convoys and conducted antisubmarine patrols of French coastal waters. 
Post-war service.
About the time of the armistice, the armed trawler began to assist "Favorite" (SP-1385) in salvage and repair work. Following the armistice, she probably continued her salvage work. 
Post-war decommissioning.
"Utowana" returned to the United States in August 1919 and was assigned to the 3d Naval District. She was placed out of commission on 11 September 1919. Just over a year later, on 13 September 1920, she was sold to the Denton Shore Lumber Co., Tampa, Florida.
In the mid-1920s, "Utowana" was purchased by Allison V. Armour and refitted for scientific exploration (1926 - 1927) in the Canary Islands, the Balearic Islands, Southeast Asia, and West Africa. Source: The story appears in David Fairchild's book "Exploring for Plants" (1930), pp. 1 - 2, 221 (Grand Canary and Lanzarote), 234 (Balearic Islands), Ceylon (282), and West Africa (457). A photo of Utowana after refitting appears on p. 9. On p. 580 Fairchild again refers to the Utowana expedition. David Fairchild's later book "The World Grows Round My Door" (1947) says that the yacht "disappeared in the explosions of war" (307). He mentions yellowing photographs.

Old Customhouse (Monterey, California)

The Old Customhouse is a Spanish Colonial style adobe structure built around 1827 by the Mexican government in the Pueblo de Monterey, Alta California, in present day Monterey County in the U.S. state of California. The Customhouse is the state's first designated California Historical Landmark, marking the site where U.S. Commodore John Drake Sloat raised the American flag and declared California part of the United States in 1846.
History.
In 1821 New Spain—Mexico won independence from Spain, in the Mexican War of Independence, and for nearly 25 years Monterey was in the Mexican Territory of Alta California. Under Mexican rule the trade restrictions were lifted and coastal ports were opened to foreign trade. This drew in trade from British, American, and South American traders. 
To collect customs duties (tax monies) at the Monterey Bay port, the Mexican government built the Customhouse, making it the oldest government building in present day California. On July 7, 1846, during the Mexican-American war, Commodore John Drake Sloat raised the American Flag, declaring California part of the United States. 
Landmark.
The Monterey Customs House was a landmark that the Native Sons of the Golden West determined should not disappear if within their power to prevent it. The property belonged to the United States Government, but the Native Sons of the Golden West obtained a lease of the buildings and grounds and restored them in the early 1900s. The lease was ultimately transferred to a State Commission appointed under a legislative act passed in 1901 which act also carried an appropriation for further restoration of the building.
The Customhouse became the first California Historical Landmark on June 1, 1932, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960. It is part of the larger Monterey State Historic Park, itself a National Historic Landmark District along with the nearby Larkin House.

46th Pennsylvania Infantry

The 46th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry was a Union Army regiment in the American Civil War. It served in both the Eastern and Western Theaters, most notably at the 1862 Battle of Cedar Mountain and during the 1864 Atlanta Campaign. During the war, the regiment lost 17% of it strength through combat losses and disease.
History.
Organization and early movements.
The regiment was recruited in Allegheney, Berks, Dauphin, Luzerne, Mifflin, Northampton, Northumberland, and Potter counties, and formally mustered into service on September 4, 1861, under the command of Colonel Joseph Farmer Knipe. At Camp Curtin, in Harrisburg, they were formally accepted into the service of the United States and received their uniforms and equipment. Additionally, they were presented with their regimental colors by Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Curtin.
From late September 1861 through February 1862, the 46th was stationed on the upper Potomac River in Maryland, performing guard and outpost duty in Brig. Gen. Alpheus Williams' division, assigned to Maj. Gen. Nathaniel Banks' corps. During this time, on September 22, Maj. Arnold Lewis was shot and killed by Pvt. Dennis Lanaghan of Company I while trying to enforce discipline, for which he was sentenced by military court to be executed. He was hanged on December 23 of that year, in front of his gathered brigade.
By March 1862, the regiment had crossed the Potomac and reached Winchester, Virginia, beginning their part in what was to become the Valley Campaign. After a brief foray to Manassas, they were ordered back to Winchester and subsequently started a long march up the Shenandoah Valley, reaching as far south as Harrisonburg. From there they began a retrograde movement in which they fell back to the vicinity of Strasburg. On May 24 they again arrived at Winchester after a desperate march to reach the town before General Stonewall Jackson's troops. The next day they fought the First Battle of Winchester, in which, heavily outnumbered, General Banks' troops were forced to frantically retreat thirty-five miles to Williamsport, Maryland, on the north bank of the Potomac.
Battle of Cedar Mountain.
In early August, Banks' corps, now part of Maj. Gen. John Pope's Army of Virginia, was stationed at Culpeper, Virginia. With reports of Jackson's Confederate troops marching in their direction, the 46th and the rest of their brigade under Brig. Gen. Samuel W. Crawford were ordered to attack them near a promontory named Cedar Mountain. Advancing across a wheat field, Crawford's brigade smashed into the left of Jackson's line and collapsed elements of two brigades there, including the vaunted Stonewall Brigade. During the confusion of battle, the 46th split in two directions, with the right half engaging the right flank of the Stonewall Brigade, and the left half tangling with the left end of Brig. Gen. Richard B. Garnett's brigade. The fighting here was close and savage, including hand-to-hand combat. However, with no Union reinforcements immediately sent to sustain this breakthrough, and with pressure from additional Rebel troops sent to shore up and rally this end of the line, Crawford's men were soon outflanked and forced to retreat back across the wheatfield.
The Battle of Cedar Mountain devastated the ranks of the 46th. Out of a total of 504 engaged, the regiment lost 31 killed, 102 wounded, and 111 taken prisoner or missing, a casualty rate of 48%. Due to these losses, the regiment was not actively engaged in the Second Battle of Bull Run at the end of August. However, at the Battle of Antietam on September 17, in spite of still having a fraction of their former number, they nevertheless saw action and lost an additional six killed and three wounded.
After Antietam, the regiment occupied Maryland Heights opposite Harpers Ferry, Virginia, where they were placed on picket duty, lasting through the middle of December, when they marched to Fairfax, Virginia, and remained there until mid-January 1863.
1863.
Subsequent to having taken part in Burnside's Mud March January 20–24, 1863, the 46th went into winter camp at Stafford Courthhouse, Virginia and remained there into late April. That spring, Union Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker reorganized the Army of the Potomac, of which he was now in command. One of Hooker's initiatives included assigning each army corps a particular badge symbol, color-coded to indicate the division to which the wearer of the badge belonged. Hence, the men of the 46th now wore a red star, indicative of their assignment to the First Division of the XII Corps.
Thus organized, at the end of April, the regiment marched up the Rappahannock River around Gen. Robert E. Lee's left flank, on their way toward the Battle of Chancellorsville. On the Morning of May 3 (after General Jackson's wounding), the resumption of the famous 'Flank Attack' bore heavily upon the 1st Division. Generally, the XII Corps played a significant role throughout the battle in defending their part of Hooker's line and covering the army's retreat afterward.
In June, Lee began advancing his Army of Northern Virginia through Maryland and into Pennsylvania, and the 46th likewise marched north with the Army of the Potomac to stop him, at the Battle of Gettysburg. However, the regiment had a limited role in the battle. After first occupying a position near the Union line's right flank on Culp's Hill late July 1, they were ordered to march toward the left flank in support of the line on Cemetery Ridge. They later countermarched back to Culp's Hill, but now found the enemy occupying the breastworks they had earlier constructed, and instead remained in a reserve position. The only casualties the 46th suffered at Gettysburg were the result of friendly fire from a Union battery posted on Powers Hill behind them. With Lee defeated at Gettysburg and retreating back into Virginia, the Army of the Potomac pursued him to the Rappahannock River. 
In September, the XI and XII Corps were detached from the Army of the Potomac and transferred west by rail to Tennessee to aid Maj. Gen. William Rosecrans, who was besieged in Chattanooga. For the remainder of 1863, the 46th was assigned to guard duty near Bridgeport, Alabama, on the rail lines leading to Nashville.
1864.
In January 1864, enough of the officers and men of the regiment volunteered to re-enlist for an additional three years' service that the unit was granted “veteran” status, which entitled them to a thirty-day furlough, and to thenceforward be referred to as 46th Pennsylvania Veteran Volunteer Infantry. Additionally, the XI Corps and XII Corps were now consolidated into one and reorganized as the XX Corps, taking the XII Corps badge as their insignia. However, still being assigned to the First Division of the corps, the men of the regiment retained their red star badges.
The first week of May saw the beginning of Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman's Atlanta Campaign. The 46th was actively engaged in the fighting at the Battle of Resaca on May 14 and 15, and the Battle of New Hope Church on the 25th of the same month. 
Throughout June, Sherman continued to attempt to outmaneuver Confederate Gen. Joseph E. Johnston's forces. On the 22nd, the regiment saw a stiff fight at the Battle of Kolb's Farm. In this battle, the men had stacked their arms toward the rear of a position they had just begun to fortify with breastworks, when suddenly two divisions of Confederate troops appeared in the clearing. After running to retrieve their rifles and loading them as they returned to the line, the 46th and the rest of their brigade, supported by artillery, proceeded to handily repulse the Rebels, inflicting terrible casualties, but incurring very few of their own.
Peachtree Creek.
In mid-July, with Sherman practically on the doorstep of Atlanta, Confederate President Jefferson Davis demonstrated his dissatisfaction with Gen. Joseph Johnston's efforts to stop him by relieving him of command and placing the troops under Gen. John Bell Hood instead. Living up to his aggressive and often reckless nature, Hood wasted little time in ordering an attack on the Union forces near Peachtree Creek. Late in the afternoon on July 20, the Confederates assaulted Union Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas' Army of the Cumberland, to which the XX Corps was assigned, catching them completely off guard. Occupying the right flank of Alpheus Williams' First Division, the 46th was in danger of being overlapped by the Confederates. The companies positioned on the right were ordered to refuse the regiment's line, or pull back to form a right angle to the companies on the left. Eventually, with reinforcements arriving to plug a gap between Williams and the next Union division to his right, the Confederates were beaten back. For the 46th, the Battle of Peachtree Creek was second only to Cedar Mountain in the losses they sustained: 26 officers and men killed or mortally wounded, 86 wounded, and 1 missing. 
Following the Battle of Atlanta on July 22, Sherman enveloped the fortifications around the city and settled in for a siege, which lasted until September 2. After occupying Atlanta for two and a half months, the Union forces then set out on Sherman's March to the Sea, with the 46th among the ranks, on November 15, ending with the capture of Savannah, Georgia, on December 22.
End of the war.
From Savannah, the 46th turned north with Sherman's army and marched through South Carolina and into North Carolina in what became known as the Carolinas Campaign. At the Bennett Place near Durham, North Carolina, Confederate Gen. Joe Johnston surrendered his forces to Sherman. With hostilities now being ended, the regiment continued their march north through Virginia and into Washington, D.C., where on May 24 they took their place in the Grand Review of the Armies. On July 16, the men of 46th Pennsylvania Veteran Volunteers were formally mustered out of service of the United States.
Losses.
Over the course of the war, the 46th Pennsylvania had 1794 officers and men enrolled in its ranks. Of these, 179 were killed or mortally wounded, or 10%. An additional 138 died of disease, for a total of 317 deaths, or 17%. John Wadsworth Vodrey, son of noted American potter Jabez Vodrey, was killed at the Battle of New Hope Church while serving with the regiment.
Re-enactors.
There is a group of musicians from Central Pennsylvania known as the 46th PA Regiment Band (The Logan Guard), which portrays the regimental band that accompanied the 46th in the first part of its service, until being discharged in August 1862.

.475 A&amp;M Magnum

The .475 A&M Magnum is a rifle cartridge developed in the United States. At the time of its development it was considered the most powerful sporting rifle cartridge ever developed. However, as the .475 A&M Magnum was a wildcat cartridge, the .460 Weatherby Magnum continued to be the most powerful commercial sporting cartridge available.
The cartridge and rifle were designed by the Atkinson & Marquart Rifle Co. of Prescott, Arizona, by necking up the then new .460 Weatherby Magnum to accept a diameter bullet. Fred N. Barnes, the founder of Barnes Bullets for whom the first rifle chambered for this cartridge was made, supplied the bullets. According to anecdotes, Fred Barnes gathered a group of people to demonstrate the rifle. The rifle was fired at the base of a small tree which was uprooted while Fred Barnes who had been shooting from a crouched position on a gravel bed had slid a few feet and ended on his back due to the recoil.
The .475 A&M Magnum was never available commercially, and was only Barnes Bullets and Custom Brass and Bullets provided bullet for the cartridge. Only a small number of rifles have been chambered for this cartridge. Brass is easily fireformed using .460 Weatherby Magnum brass. Dies are available from Custom Brass and Bullets.

The pointed hat was worn by clowns and jugglers who wanted to portray clumsiness or stupidity during medieval times. Because of this, pointed hats were used when vexing criminals. The criminals were forced to wear pointed hats and walk through the streets, while people threw rotten vegetables at them, spat on them, and insulted them. 
Later, during the celebration of the Holy Week/Easter in Mediterranean countries, "Penitentes" (people doing penitance for their sins) would walk through streets with pointed hats. It was a way of self-injury; however, they covered their faces so they wouldn't be recognized.

Iron Mountain Baby

Iron Mountain Baby refers both to a folksong and the subject of that song, William Moses Gould Helms.
On August 14, 1902, William Helms (June 5, 1835 – December 13, 1917), a 72-year old farmer and civil war veteran, was walking along the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway (later the Missouri Pacific Railroad) where it crosses Big River outside of Irondale (Washington County, Missouri), collecting lumber for a barn he intended to build. He saw No. 4 speed northbound over the bridge. Then, hearing a strange noise and following its source, he found what is described as "an old fashioned telescoping valise." The case turned out to contain a baby, whose age was later estimated at approximately five days. Having fallen about , the child was badly bruised, with a pronounced dent in its head. Helms took the child home to his wife, Sarah Jane Knight Helms (July 10, 1850 – April 15, 1925) and they nursed him back to health. 
The child was named for his foster father, Bill Helms, and "Gould," the owner of the railroad, but also "Moses," because he was taken from the river. The story spread throughout the United States, and gave rise to the folksong. Many women came forward, claiming to be the boy's mother. However, when the child was six years old, the elderly couple formally adopted him. 
After the death of the elder Helms, William and his mother moved to Salem, Missouri. He attended Braughton's University and Southwest Missouri State Teachers College (now Missouri State University); his education was paid for by the St. Louis Iron Mountain & Southern Railway. He became a printer. 
On August 5, 1933 he married a woman named "Sally," (September 17, 1904, d. Racine, Wisconsin, September 1987). They had one son, William (died at age 14, according to some sources). 
They later moved to Texas, where William died January 31, 1953, aged 51.
When the corpse was carried by train back to Washington County, it was only the second time William had ridden a train. 
He was interred at Hopewell, Missouri Cemetery. The funeral got no publicity; Helms did not enjoy his peculiar fame.
The Ballad of the Iron Mountain Baby (likely has changed from the original version, written by Rev. J.T. Barton in late 1902 or early 1903, which is said to have had 14 stanzas)
"(the ballad mistakes certain key details—the number of the train, the names of the principals, etc.)."

Balanced-growth equilibrium

In macroeconomics, the balanced-growth path of a dynamic model is a trajectory such that all variables grow at a constant rate. In the standard exogenous growth model, balanced growth is a basic assumption, while other variables like the capital stock, real GDP, and output per worker are growing. Developing economies may adopt a strategy of unbalanced growth to rectify previous investment decisions, as put forward by economist Albert O. Hirschman.
In microbiology, the state of balanced-growth in liquid cultures is ideal for performing experiments because all bacteria are at about the same state (as opposed to stationary phase, for example, where some cells are alive and others are dead). Machines like chemostats can be used to culture bacteria and keep them in a state of balanced-growth for long-term experiments.

Uberabatitan

Uberabatitan (meaning "Uberaba titan", in reference to where it was found) is a genus of titanosaurian sauropod dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous of Brazil. It is known from bones including neck, back, and tail vertebrae, pelvic bones, and limb bones. These fossils were found in the uppermost portion of the Maastrichtian-age Marília Formation of the Bauru Group, in Uberaba, Minas Gerais. The type species, described by Salgado and Carvalho in 2008, is "U. ribeiroi". To date, it is the most recent titanosaur from Bauru Group rocks; other titanosaurs from the Bauru Group, including "Baurutitan" and "Trigonosaurus", come from lower (thus older) levels. Like other sauropods, "Uberabatitan" would have been a large quadrupedal herbivore.

Houston Bright

Life.
Houston Bright was born January 21, 1916, in Midland, Texas. He was the son of a Methodist minister. He attended high school in Shamrock, in the Texas Panhandle (although the 1938 West Texas yearbook showed his hometown to be Plainview). After graduating high school in 1932, he attended West Texas State. He organized a dance band, the "Kampus Katz," in the 1935-1936 school year; the band played locally and also toured Texas, New Mexico, and Colorado during the following summer. While a student he also became known as a classical vocalist, singing baritone; a brother, Weldon, sang tenor.
Bright received his Bachelor of Science degree in music in 1938. Afterward he was the first student to be designated as a "graduate assistant." He received his Master of Arts degree in music education in 1940 and took a full-time faculty appointment at that time. He served as an infantry officer in Europe 1942–1945 and then returned to WTS. Through summer study and a leave of absence, he completed his work for a Ph.D. degree in musicology in 1952 at the University of Southern California. There he studied conducting under Dr. Charles C. Hirt and composition under Halsey Stevens. His dissertation was titled "The Early Tudor Part-song from Newarke to Cornyshe."
Bright held the rank of Professor; he taught composition and music theory, and directed the college's A Cappella Choir, which he founded in 1941. The various West Texas choirs (which included a larger Chorale and a women's choir, along with other, smaller ensembles) frequently toured the Texas Panhandle and premiered many of Bright's works. His earliest published compositions are the choral pieces "Weep You No More, Sad Fountains" and "Evening Song of the Weary," both dating from 1949. In 1965 college president James Cornette, honoring Bright's twenty-five years of service to the college, would grant him the additional title of Composer-in-Residence.
Throughout his career at West Texas, Bright was surrounded by musical genius. His colleagues included Royal Brantley, the original musical director and eventual artistic director of the musical drama "Texas"; band director Gary Garner, chosen by the Texas Bandmasters Association as 1987's "Bandmaster of the Year"; and Hugh Sanders, who served as assistant director of the choral program at West Texas, subsequently succeeded Bright as the college's director of choral activities, and ultimately gained great acclaim as choral director at Baylor University. He also mentored the young choral teacher Alfred R. Skoog, who went on to serve as director of choral activities at Arkansas State University for over three decades.
Bright's professional memberships included the American Choral Directors Association, the Choral Conductors Guild of America, the Texas Composers Guild, and the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP). He also conducted numerous workshops, including two for the Texas Choral Directors Association.
Houston Bright continued composing until his death, of cancer, on December 8, 1970 in Canyon. He donated his original works to the West Texas State Music Library. In 1974, Shawnee Press published his "We'll Sing a Glory" as a concluding "opus posthumous".
Musical Works.
The works of Houston Bright comprise around a hundred original compositions, including pieces for concert band, choir, piano, and instrumental chamber ensembles. They have been performed not only throughout North America and Europe but in South America, Taiwan, Japan, and Africa as well. Diverse choral and instrumental groups have performed and recorded his music, including the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, the Wiener Singakademie, the American Woodwind Quintet, the Slovak Philharmonic Choir (Slovenský Filharmonický Zbor) of Bratislava, and Fred Waring and His Pennsylvanians. Most of Bright's scores were originally published by Waring's Shawnee Press.
Wind Band.
During preparations for the two-hundredth anniversary of the founding of the United States of America (1776-1976), the National Association for Music Education (NAfME/MENC) appointed a Bicentennial Commission to recognize, and promote the performance of, "significant" works by American composers. Two works by Bright — his Prelude and Fugue in F minor and his Passacaglia in G minor — were so honored in the commission's "Selective List of American Music for the Bicentennial Celebration," alongside music by such canonical U.S. composers as Sousa, Gershwin, and Copland.
Bright's Prelude and Fugue in F minor, in particular, has come to be considered a standard of the wind band repertory. In the 2007 volume "Composers on Composing for Band," for example, Dr. Jared Spears (professor emeritus of music, Arkansas State University) ranks that composition as being among "Ten Works All Band Conductors at All Levels Should Study," categorizing the piece as "intelligently written, historically important," and "educationally worthwhile."
Brass Quartet.
Bright's "Legend and Canon" was included in a "Selected List of Twentieth-Century Ensembles for Three or More Brass Instruments," published in "Music Educators Journal" after the composer's death. In the accompanying article ("Music for Brass Comes into Its Own"), Prof. John R. Shoemaker described the works so chosen as "outstanding" pieces of music numbering "among the most important in the literature." The compositions were selected by a group consisting of classical-music critics and members of the National Association of College Wind and Percussion Instructors who were recognized as "specialists in the brass chamber-music field"; their wide-ranging list encompasses a variety of works by American and European composers such as Gunther Schuller, Francis Poulenc, Paul Hindemith, Nicolai Berezowsky, and Malcolm Arnold.
Choir.
"(select list; arranged alphabetically)"
Bright's best-known choral piece, the original spiritual "I Hear a Voice A-Prayin’" (1955), was composed for mixed chorus (SATB); this work proved so popular that the composer subsequently transcribed it for men's chorus (TTBB); a transcription for women's chorus (SSAA) followed, and later an SSAB arrangement (made by Greg Gilpin) for "young and developing" choirs as well. Other well known and widely performed Bright compositions include (to cite but a few examples) "Rainsong," "Never Tell Thy Love," "Three Quatrains from the Rubaiyat," "Reflection," the "Trilogy for Women's Voices," and his "Te Deum laudamus."
Most of his musical work was completely original, although he made a handful of arrangements of American folk songs. Several pieces were settings of poems by Percy Bysshe Shelley, such as "Lament of the Enchantress," "Winter Night on the Mountain," and "Clouds that Veil the Midnight Moon." His choral works often put to music texts by nineteenth-century British and American poets (among them Shelley, Tennyson, Thomas Hood, Emily Brontë, Christina Rossetti, Felicia Hemans, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and William Cullen Bryant). Other works set sacred Christian liturgical texts (such as his "Kyrie Eleison," "Benedictus and Hosanna," and "Antiphonal Gloria"); while still others set Bright's own original lyrics (including "Premonition," "Rainsong," and "Summer Evening").
Houston Bright composed, on commission, numerous pieces for high-school choruses as well as for college and festival choirs in several states. In so doing, he wrote largely for student singers and amateur musicians. Yet, according to Nick Strimple of the USC Thornton School of Music at the University of Southern California, Bright "created several little pieces that have stood the test of time, the musical content making them still appropriate for university and community choruses…"
Citing Bright's "Four Sacred Songs for the Night" as ranking among his favorites in the choral repertory, Dr. Floyd Slotterback, choral director and professor of music at Northern Michigan University, told an interviewer in March 2001: "Certain pieces kind of stick… I really enjoyed those Houston Bright pieces; the pieces sing well; he treats the voice very nicely. And they're very attractive; I think they'll please people… Good repertoire is just good repertoire, period."
Similarly, in singling out "Lament of the Enchantress," Forrest Daniel, director of the Sisters (Oregon) Community Chorus, observed: "Shelley and Houston Bright, two very good artists. Houston Bright didn't really get his due. He lived in this little town in Texas and he had this magnificent talent."

Christina Machamer

Christina Machamer (born March 13, 1982) is an American chef who won the fourth season of Fox Network's reality cooking show "Hell's Kitchen". She was awarded the position of "Senior Sous Chef" (not the Executive Chef position as promised) at Gordon Ramsay's new London West Hollywood restaurant where she earned a $250,000 yearly salary.
Early life.
Christina, the daughter of Rick and Leasa Machamer, was born and raised in St. Louis, and began working in restaurants at age 16. She graduated from Lafayette High School in 2000 and after some time in college, she dropped out of pre-law and decided that cooking was her calling in life. After an apprenticeship with chef Larry Forgione at An American Place, she began her formal training at Forest Park Community College in 2003. She moved on to the The Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, in the spring of 2006 and graduated on February 29, 2008.
At the Culinary Institute, she graduated at the top of her class.
"Hell's Kitchen".
Machamer decided to apply to "Hell's Kitchen" after watching season 3. She went to the open audition in Manhattan and was called back for a screen test. The casting director thought she was "hilarious".
As a culinary student, Machamer was the contestant with the least cooking experience and was repeatedly nominated for elimination, mostly due to what her peers described as a threatening intellect. Despite this, she broke the standing record for the number of challenges won with 9 wins and finished as the final competitor, defeating the season's runner-up, Louis Petrozza. What most impressed Ramsay was her special potential, something he did not see nearly enough of in any of the other contestants. After winning, Machamer had the choice of accepting her $250,000 prize money at once or earning it as a paycheck for working a year at Gordon Ramsay's restaurant.
After "Hell's Kitchen".
Although promised the position of executive chef at the new Gordon Ramsay at the London West Hollywood restaurant, Machamer, as the winning contestant, was instead given the position of senior chef under executive chef Andy Cook.
While waiting for the show to be aired and permission to disclose her win, Machamer worked at Revival, a restaurant in St. Louis started by her mentor, chef Cary McDowell.
Together with Cory Lemieux, Machamer began BCBC Blends, a small artisan spice company that has recently been launched nationally.
Gordon Ramsay at the London West Hollywood was awarded a Michelin Star in the 2009 Michelin Guide. As of early 2009, Machamer is the executive sous chef at the London West Hollywood, where she works nearly 14 hours a day and is also charged with supervising the kitchen's various stations.
Machamer will be blogging for BuddyTV.com after each episode of season 5 and has recently completed her sommelier diploma in wine service.
Since being invested with celebrity status from her win, Machamer has been invited to a number of culinary events. She and the 2007 "Hell's Kitchen" winner Rock Harper competed in a cookoff and both will be among those presenting at the 2009 Scottsdale Culinary Festival in Arizona.
After Gordon Ramsay at The London West Hollywood was sold back to LXR hotels, Machamer traveled to Napa to study wine at CIA Greystone in St. Helena, California. Shortly after, she returned to Los Angeles as part of the opening team at Bouchon in Beverly Hills for celebrated chef, Thomas Keller. 
In 2008, she relocated to the Napa Valley, where she has found a new niche bridging the gap between food and wine at the much celebrated B Cellars, in Calistoga, California.
In January 2009, she was featured as a host at the St. Louis Food & Wine Experience.

Japan Railway Construction Public Corporation

The JRCC was established in 1964 as the successor to JNR's railway line construction division. Kakuei Tanaka, then an influential member of the House of Representatives, was said to have been involved in its creation. Since by 1964 the existing railway network had been largely completed, the JRCC's primary responsibility was the planning and construction of the new shinkansen lines, urban railway lines, and third-sector lines.
The opening of the Tōkaidō Shinkansen and Seikan Tunnel and the planning of the Honshu-Shikoku Bridge Project all proved beneficial to JRCC's bottom line. However, in spite of debate over JNR's plan to eliminate little-used local lines and become profitable again, JRCC was forced to build new local lines in response to pressure from Diet politicians. Ultimately construction of new lines continued to ensure "balanced development of the nation."
In September 1979, it was revealed that JRCC had used money intended for overtime and other expenses for personal vacations, and it became the target of the Board of Audit of Japan. As a result, six people (including the director, Hiromori Kawashima) were forced to step down and 352 had their salary reduced, received warnings, or were otherwise reprimanded. A special accounting committee was also formed to return the mis-spent funds and pay taxes as was deemed necessary.
In 1998 JRCC assumed the assets and liabilities of the JNR Settlement Corporation; JNRSC's existing long-term debts were incorporated into the national government's general debt. The JRCC was dissolved on October 1, 2003 and its responsibilities were passed to the Japan Railway Construction, Transport and Technology Agency (JRTT).

Robert Fotherby

Robert Fotherby (died 1646) was an early 17th-century English explorer and whaler. From 1613 to 1615 he worked for the Muscovy Company, and from 1615 until his death for the East India Company. 
Family ties.
There was a family of Fotherbys in Grimsby, Lincolnshire. Robert Fotherby may have belonged to this Grimsby stock. 
Whaling voyages to Spitsbergen (Svalbard), 1613-1615.
1613.
Fotherby was among the crew of seven ships sent by the Muscovy Company to Greenland (Spitsbergen) in May 1613. He served as master's mate aboard the ship "Matthew" (250 tons), vice-admiral of the fleet. The only notable occurrence Fotherby spoke of in his journal was that he ascended a glacier in Josephbukta, a bay on the western side of Recherchefjorden. This is significant in that this is the first recorded glacier expedition in Spitsbergen's history. The glacier in question was probably Renardbreen (Fox glacier). 
1614.
In this year Fotherby sailed as master's mate in the ship "Thomasine", one of the two ships sent by the Muscovy Company to explore the coast of Spitsbergen. The ship left England early in May and had arrived in the latitude of 75° N, just south of Spitsbergen, by the end of the month. 
On 22 June Fotherby came into Magdalenefjorden, claiming it and the small sheltered bay on its southern shore for King James I of England by setting up the King's Arms on a wooden cross. He named the former "Maudlin Sound", the latter "Trinity Harbor".
Several times in July and August, Fotherby, along with William Baffin, pilot of the "Thomasine", using two shallops, explored the northern coast of Spitsbergen. They explored and named Raudfjorden "Red-cliff Sound" (its modern name is merely a corruption of this earlier namesake). Fotherby named the cape separating its two southern branches "Point Deceit" (now called Narreneset, its Norwegian equivalent), and its eastern entrance "Point Welcome" (which modern maps have misplaced further east). The large, open bay to the east he named "Broad bay" (Breibogen, its Norwegian equivalent), and its shore "Red Beach". Along Red Beach Fotherby saw evidence of the presence of Thomas Marmaduke's 1612 expedition by the fires his crew had made. The eastern point of Red Beach, now wrongly marked Velkomstpynten on modern charts, Fotherby named "Redbeach Point". The two fjords (Liefdefjorden and Woodfjorden) south of Breibogen and Reinsdyerflya he marked "Wiches Sound", named after the London shipowner and merhant Richard Wyche. 
Climbing atop a high hill along the eastern shore of Woodfjorden in early August, Fotherby and Baffin saw a long, wide bay (Wijdefjorden) and a point to the northeast (Verlegenhuken). He called the former "Sir Thomas Smith's Inlet" (it apparently was named earlier). Seeing another shallop heading towards Gråhuken, or "Castlins Point" as Fotherby named it, they went north, meeting at the aforementioned point. Here they found a cross set up by Marmaduke's men in 1612. It had Laurence Prestwood, as well as two or three other names, engraved on it. It bore the date 17 August 1612. By traveling overland and by sea they made their way around Gråhuken and several leagues into Wijdefjorden, where, because of thick ice, they were forced to travel solely overland to explore further into the fjord. Walking along its western shore, Fotherby and Baffin traveled almost a league further, where, from a point of land jutting into the fjord, they were able to see the end of Wijdefjorden several leagues to the south. The ice would not allow them to explore further, so they made their way back to their ship, which was anchored in the southern harbor of Fairhaven (Smeerenburgfjorden). 
They attempted to sail the ship around the northern coast of Spitsbergen, but could only reach the mouth of Wijdefjorden before being forced to turn back because of the ice. The "Thomasine" left the latitude of Spitsbergen in early September and arrived back in England early the next month.
1615.
In 1615 Fotherby again was part of an exploratory expedition, this time commanding his own ship, the pinnace "Richard" (20 tons). Although he failed to find Henry Hudson's elusive Hold-with-Hope (generally believed to be part of the east coast of Greenland), he did stumble upon Jan Mayen, becoming the first documented English expedition to reach the island. Thinking it was a new discovery, he named it "Sir Thomas Smith's Island", and the large volcano, Beerenberg, dominating the northeastern part of the island "Mount Hackluyt". The island may have been discovered the year before by the Dutchman Fopp Gerritsz., sailing in command of a whaleship sent out by the Englishman John Clarke, of Dunkirk.
East India Company.
In October 1615, after his return from this expedition, a court's minute of the East India Company stated that Fotherby was "a very fit person to be employed upon a discovery for the south side of the Cape." We next find him appointed as the Company's overseer for making cordage in Deptford in November 1618. Three years later he was said to be "confirmed in his place and salary." In August of the same year he moved to Blackwall Yard to act as the Company's agent there, and in October 1624 he had his wages increased. Fotherby is mentioned as the clerk at Blackwall in August 1627, and again in August 1639, in reference to his son, also named Robert, where he is said to be "the Company's old and well deserving servant and clerk at Blackwall". In July 1644, he is mentioned as one of the men chosen as officers of the Company: "Robert Fotherby, clerk at Blackwall". In September of the same year the court minutes of the Company stated that Fotherby had served as the Company's "clerk and storekeeper at Blackwall Yard" the last twenty-six years. He is last mentioned in the Company's service in the court minutes of May 1646. In October the Company learned of his death, and on 16th of the same month he was buried. His son died three years later.

<doc id="18485586" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18485586" title="Beta-adrenergic agonist">
Beta-adrenergic agonist

Beta-adrenergic agonists are a class of sympathomimetic agents which act upon the beta adrenoceptors. In general, pure beta-adrenergic agonists have the opposite function of beta blockers. Beta adrenoreceptor agonist ligands mimic the action of epinephrine and norepinephrine signaling in the heart, lungs and smooth muscle tissue, with epinephrine being the highest affinity. The activation of β1, β2 and β3 activates the enzyme, Adenylate cyclase. This in turn leads to the activation of the secondary messenger Cyclic adenosine monophosphate and induces smooth muscle relaxation and contraction of the cardiac tissue.
Function.
Activation of β1 receptors induces positive inotropic, chronotropic output of the cardiac muscle, leading to increased heart rate and blood pressure, secretion of ghrelin from the stomach, and renin release from the kidneys.
Activation of β2 receptors induces smooth muscle relaxation in the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, uterus, and various blood vessels. Increased heart rate and heart muscle contraction is also associated with the β2 receptors. β3 receptors are mainly located in adipose tissue.
Activation of the β3 receptors induces the metabolism of lipids.
Medical uses.
Indications of administration for beta agonists include the following:
Side effects.
Although minor compared to epinephrine, beta agonists usually have mild to moderate adverse effects, which includes anxiety, hypertension, increased heart rate and insomnia. Other side effects include headaches and essential tremor. Indications of hypoglycemia were also reported due to secretion of insulin in the body from activation of beta-2 receptors.
In 2013, Zilpaterol, a beta-agonist sold by Merck was temporarily withdrawn due to signs of sickness in some cattle that were fed the drug.
Receptor selectivity.
Most agonists of the beta receptors are selective for one or more beta-adrenoreceptors. For example, patients with low heart rate are given beta agonist treatments that are more "cardio-selective" such as dobutamine, which increases the force of contraction of the heart muscle. Patients who are suffering from a chronic inflammatory lung diseases such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are treated with albuterol, which mainly induces smooth muscle relaxation in the lungs and less contraction of the heart.
Beta-3 agonists are currently in clinical research and are thought to increase the breakdown of lipids in obese patients.
β1 agonists.
β1 agonists: stimulates adenylyl cyclase activity; opening of calcium channel. (cardiac stimulants; used to treat cardiogenic shock, acute heart failure, bradyarrhythmias). Selected examples are:
β2 agonists.
β2 agonists: stimulates adenylyl cyclase activity; closing of calcium channel (smooth muscle relaxants; used to treat asthma and COPD). Selected examples are:
Undetermined/unsorted.
The following agents are also listed as agonists by MeSH.

The Freechild Project is a nonprofit organization focused on creating connections between adults and young people through programs, technical assistance, publications, training, and curriculum. Adam Fletcher is the director, and the project is located in Olympia, Washington. The "School Library Journal" has said Freechild's website is, "By far the largest repository of projects, ideas, and organizational links, this resource provides more than adequate information to help students brainstorm ideas in order to start their own initiatives."
History.
Fletcher started the Project in 2001. Long affiliated with a national nonprofit youth engagement organization called CommonAction, today Freechild is independent.
Activities.
The mission of Freechild is "to advocate, inform, and celebrate social change led by and with young people around the world, particularly those who have been historically denied the right to participate. The Freechild Project provides examples and resources to youth and their adult allies." The group advocates "radical democracy."
The Freechild Project believes it is completely unethical to exclude young people from participating in the actions that affect them most. Their projects include service-learning, topic-specific workshops and activist group incubation. The group consults with local and national nonprofit groups in strategic planning, capacity building and product development with youth empowerment at the center of their priorities. They also perform networking services through conferences and online communications.
The organization is coordinated by one full-time staff member, offers activities through a network of trainers, and is advised by youth and adult experts from across the US. The website SoundOut.org is one of their projects. The director of Freechild also talks with the media about youth.

There are (five) homogeneous species...whose specific differences such as chromatic models and body size, as shown in literature (Caudell 1912), do not help us in their identification.

Vaikom Temple

The Vaikom Mahadeva Temple is a temple for the Hindu god Shiva in Vaikom, Kerala.
The temple, along with Ettumanoor Siva Temple, Kaduthuruthy Thaliyil Mahadeva Temple is considered a powerful trisome. The belief is that if a devotee worships at these three temples before 'Ucha pooja', all the wishes are fulfilled.
The Vaikom Mahadeva temple is one of the few temples which is held in reverence by both Shaivaites and the Vaishnavaites. Vaikom’s Shiva is fondly called Vaikkathappan. The Shiva Linga here is believed to be from the ‘Treta yuga’ and considered as one of the oldest temples in Kerala where pooja has not been broken since inception.
Pre-Colonial history.
Kharasura on receiving the Shaiva Vidya Upadesh from Malyavan went to Chidambaram, and did severe penance and Tapasya for the attainment of Moksha. Pleased with his penance Lord Siva granted all the boons he asked, and presented him with three great Siva Lingas drawn out of Him. Assuring that He will ever be present in them, Lord Siva disappeared, asking Khara to worship the Lingas to attain Moksha. When Khara was returning south from Himalayas with the three Lingas, one in his right hand, one in left hand and other by the neck, he felt tired and rested awhile. After rest when he tried to pick up the lingas, they wouldn’t budge. He realized that it was Shiva’s maya and when called unto, the heavens spoke thus, “I shall remain here giving Moksha to whom so ever * take refuge in Me”. Khara having attained Moksha entrusted the holy Lingas to the custody of Maharshi Vyaghrapada who had followed him invisibly and asked the sage to protect and worship them.
Myths & Beliefs.
Belief is that the Siva Linga placed by Khara Asura by his right hand is being worshipped at Vaikom, the one in left hand at Ettumannoor and the one by neck at Kaduthuruthy even to this day.
The Linga carried by Khara with his neck is believed to be at Kadathuruthy and the one by his left hand is at Ettumanoor. The fact that the distance from Vaikom to Kadathuruthy and from there to Ettumanoor is more or less the same, gives credence to this legend. So the Darsana of all these three Lingas on a same day is considered as good as the Siva Darsana at Kailas – the Abode of the Lord.
On a *Vritchika - Krishna paksha – Ashtami dahy (According to Malayalam Era), the Lord of Lords and God of Gods - Siva the Paremeswara appeared to the Maharshi with his consort Parvati - the Jagat Janani. The Lord proclaimed, “This place shall be known as Vyaghrapadapurma”, and disappeared. The world famous Vaikkathashtami and all connected holy festivals are observed here even to this day on the same Vrichika – Krishna*- Ashtami.
Vyaghrapada Maharshi continued the Pooja in most esteem and devotion for some time and went on pilgrimage.Months and years passed. Sri Parasurama – the Chiramjeevi was going by the sky one day. Seeing good omens alighted here and saw a Holy Siva Linga emerged in water emitting heavenly rays. He could understand that it was the Siva Linga placed by Khara.
Sri Parasurama thought himself that, the holiest and noblest Siva Chaitanya could be a great refuge for the devoted who wish to attain Moksha. He consecrated the auspicious Linga here with His earnest Prayers and recitation of Siva Manthras.
The most benign Lord Siva at once appeared with his consort Parvati Devi before Parasurama. He was so pleased that the Linga was consecrated with the Manthras by Parasurama – the incarnation of Vishnu, his greatest devotee. The kind Lord Siva said to Parasurama, “From now onwards I shall stay here as Shaiva-Vaishnava Chaithanya granting all blisses and Moksha to all devotees”.
Full of joy and gratitude Parasurama performed Siva Linga pooja there for some days. Then he himself built a temple here and entrusted a noble Brahmin of Taruna village whom he taught Pooja Manthras. The Brahmin had learned all the 28 Sivagama and wore rudraksha and bhasma. Parasurama donated the whole temple with Linga to Brahmins and disappeared.It is the belief that the temple and all rites and customs are planned and fixed by Parasurama himself.
It is believed that the ‘Vyaghralayesha’ Siva gives His Blessings to the Devotees in three Bhavas or forms in the morning, noon, and evening in this Holy Temple. As Dhakshinamoorthy in the morning time, Kirathamoorthi in the noon time & Shakti Panchakshari in the evening.
The closed door.
The Vaikom Temple was in the ownership of one hundred and eight families in olden days. The owners were divided into two groups and one group joined the ruler’s side. Their disputes and quarrels increased day by day. One day a section of the divided group came to the temple at noon. The chief among them a certain Njallal Namboothiri was prepared to stop the pooja in the noon. At that time the Nivedya was used to be placed in the western side of the Namaskara Mandapa. There was an entrance in the western courtyard. The Njallal Namboothiri after keeping his apron (Randam Mundu) above the western door came near the Nivedyas and spat the remains of his betel chewing on the Nivedya. So the pooja was disrupted. On return, while he was taking his apron from the door top it is stated that a highly poisonous snake bit him to death. He crawled himself outside the west and died. The Western door of the temple courtyard automatically closed itself then and a voice was heard from inside the Sreekovil thus “This door should not be opened any more”. The door remains closed to this day to show the wrath of the Great Lord against the disruption of His poojas
Architecture.
One of the bigger temples in Kerala, the Vaikom Mahadeva Temple has a courtyard of about eight acres of land. The premises levelled with river sand is protected by compound walls with four Gopuras or towers on all the four sides. The Sreekovil is round in shape roofed with copper sheets and with two chambers. The Mukha Mandapa - the first chamber is built in shaped stone and single piece woods. The walls and pillars are very strong. The Garbha Griha(Sanctum Santorium) – the second chamber is built completely in stone including the roof in a square shape.It is a very curious and peculiar fact that we are unable to obtain the Darsana of the Supreme Saiva Chaitanya from this Sreekovil without passing through a 'six steps' either from the Gopura or the Nada. It may be reminding us the Shad (six) vikaras (emotions) such as Kama, Krodha, Lobha, Moha, Madha and Mathsarya or the thantrik chakras as per the thanthrik Kalpana.
Vaikom Ashtami.
The Vaikom temple is famous for the Vaikom Ashtami (Vaikathashtami}, one of its main festivals, which is held in November–December. The exact date of the festival is determined by the Malayalam calendar.
Vaikathashtami is celebrated on the day of Krishna Ashtami. The legend behind this festival is that years ago a saint man named Vyaghrapada prayed to God siva for years after many years God siva and his wife Parvathy Devi appeared in front of him. It is believed that god Siva appeared in front of him in the day of Krishna Ashtami. So as a memory of this Vaikathashtami is celebrated. It is the festival extending for 12 days. 12th day is Vaikathashtami.

2008 Stone Temple Pilots Reunion Tour

The 2008 Stone Temple Pilots Reunion Tour was a 75-date reunion tour for the popular American rock band Stone Temple Pilots, who originally disbanded in 2003. The tour, which kicked off on May 17, 2008 in Columbus, Ohio at the Rock on the Range festival, ran throughout the summer and ended on October 31 at the Verizon Wireless Center in Pelham, Alabama. The Stone Temple Pilots reunion tour was a success, receiving positive reviews from critics and fans alike as well as high ticket sales. At one point, the Stone Temple Pilots tour was ranked at #1 on Pollstar's "Top 50" list. According to "Rolling Stone", the band sold an average of $230,000 of tickets a night.
Tour history.
After Stone Temple Pilots broke up in 2003, the members established different side projects; lead singer Scott Weiland formed the popular supergroup Velvet Revolver with former members of Guns N' Roses, and brothers Robert (bass) and Dean DeLeo (guitar) were in the short-lived band Army of Anyone. Drummer Eric Kretz kept a low-profile, operating out of his own studio, Bombshelter Studios, in Los Angeles. Army of Anyone announced an indefinite hiatus in 2007 and Weiland departed from Velvet Revolver on April 1, 2008.
According to Dean DeLeo, steps toward a reunion started with a simple phone call from Weiland's wife, Mary Forsberg. She would later invite the DeLeo brothers to play at a private beach party, which led to the reconciliation of Weiland and the DeLeo brothers. In 2007 Dean DeLeo discussed with Weiland an offer from a concert promoter to headline several summer festivals. Weiland accepted and said he had cleared the brief tour with his Velvet Revolver bandmates. Weiland said "everything was cool. Then it wasn't", and stated that the rest of the band stopped talking to him. As a result, Weiland announced in the middle of a Velvet Revolver show on March 21, 2008 in Glasgow that it would be his last performance with the group.
Stone Temple Pilots first show since 2002 was at a private show on April 7 at Harry Houdini's estate outside of Los Angeles. The band performed for a second time on "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on May 1, and officially kicked off the tour on May 17 in Columbus.
Despite several positive reviews regarding the tour from fans and critics, there were some negative reviews regarding Scott Weiland's performance early on in the tour. Most notably, at the PNC Bank Arts Center on May 31 in New Jersey, Weiland appeared extremely intoxicated during the band's performance. The band was over an hour late onstage and Weiland forgot lyrics and mumbled some lyrics, lost his balance, and at times didn't sing in sync with the music. His speeches in between songs were unintelligible and would often be cut off by other members starting the next song. At one point he had even apologized to his band mates for "messing up".
Due to the recent death of his father, Eric Kretz did not play with the band for a few shows in October. Ray Luzier, current drummer for Korn and former drummer for Army of Anyone, played in Kretz's place. Kretz returned for the last few dates of the tour.
Tampa Show Incident.
STP had to postpone their performance for the Ford Amphitheatre show (August 22, 2008). The second opening act, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, played an extended set to push time for STP, ending at 9:30 pm. It wasn't until 10:30 that it was announced the show had been canceled due to the band's inability to make it to the venue as a result of Tropical Storm Fay. Several fans have accused the band of canceling due to Weiland being in no condition to perform at the band's curtain time, citing that they had seen the other members of the band at the venue before it was announced that they were unable to travel. Also, the storm cited as the reason for the cancellation was already well to the north of the route the band would have taken to make it to Tampa from the previous show in Ft. Lauderdale.
Setlist.
Not every single show had the same setlist, but all of STP's "hits" were played nightly, with the song "Big Empty" opening every show, except during the Virgin Mobile Festival in Baltimore where the band opened with "Vasoline". The hits "Dead and Bloated" and "Trippin' on a Hole in a Paper Heart" were traditionally the tour's two encore songs, with the band's other hits, rarer tracks, and covers played throughout each night's setlist. STP also covered artists such as Queen, The Beatles, and Bob Marley on the tour. Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Pixies singer Black Francis, Meat Puppets, The Secret Machines, Tommy Joe Wilson, (artist signed to Weiland's label Softdrive Records) and 10 Years were the opening bands on the tour. The band came onstage to the song "Manhattan Rumble" by Electric Light Orchestra at the beginning of each performance on the tour.

Rumis

Rumis is a game about optimal placement of blocks of various shapes within a confined space. The name means "stones" in the language of Quechua. The theme and artwork are inspired by the Inca architecture. Rumis has also been published under the name Blokus 3-D.
Rules.
Equipment.
There are several playing boards available – each with a different architectural theme. The pieces are composed of two, three, and four cubes. Each player has eleven colored blocks, each block with a different shape (two of the four cube blocks are reflections of each other).
Setup.
Start with the board empty. Each player should have all of the blocks of their color available to them.
Object.
The goal of the game is to have the most blocks of your color visible from the top at the end of the game.
Play.
Play rotates among the players. The first piece may be placed anywhere. The other pieces played in the first round must be placed touching a piece of another color. On each following round, newly played pieces must touch a piece of their own color. Each playing board has a height restriction that limits how tall the structure may be, and pieces must rest wholly on the ground or other pieces, so that there can never be empty space underneath part of a piece.
If a player cannot legally place a piece, (which may happen because they have already placed all of their pieces), their turn is skipped. Play continues until no player can legally play any more pieces. Players are penalized one point for each piece of their color that they have not placed, and earn one point for each 1x1 portion of a piece which is visible when looking straight down from above the structure.
Strategy.
Being a game for younger players, the strategic element is not as deep as other block games such as Pueblo, however it still does have a strategic element of limiting other player's moves, ensuring that you have space to make more plays, and saving your own pieces with a large surface area for play at the top of the structure.

Euphorbia polycarpa

Euphorbia polycarpa (formerly "Chamaesyce polycarpa") is a species of spurge known by the common name smallseed sandmat. It is native to the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, especially the deserts and other dry, sandy areas. This is a perennial herb producing stems that trail along the ground to form a clump or mat, sometimes growing somewhat upright. The leaves are each under a centimeter long. They are round or oval-shaped and have triangular stipules at the bases. 
What looks like a single flower is actually an inflorescence of many staminate (male) flowers united around a single central pistillate (female) flower. Bracts surrounding the flower unit are white and petal-like. The fruit is a thin spherical capsule less than 2 millimeters wide layered over a seed.
"Chamae" derives from the Greek meaning "on the ground", referring to its spreading low lying growth near the ground, and "Syke" is from Greek for "fig". 
Uses.
Among the Zuni people, a warm gruel made with the plant and white cornmeal and taken to promote milk flow.

Traffic sign recognition

Traffic Sign Recognition is a technology by which a vehicle is able to recognise the traffic signs put on the road e.g. "speed limit" or "children" or "turn ahead". This is part of the features collectively called ADAS. The technology is being developed by many automotive suppliers, including Continental and Delphi.
These first TSR systems which recognize speed limits were developed in cooperation by Mobileye and Continental AG. They first appeared in late 2008 on the redesigned BMW 7-Series, and the following year on the Mercedes-Benz S-Class. Currently these systems only detect the round speed limit signs found all across Europe (e.g.).
Second generation systems can also detect overtaking restrictions. It was introduced in 2008 in the Opel Insignia, later followed by the Opel Astra and the Saab 9-5. This technology is also available on the 2011 Volkswagen Phaeton and since 2012 in Volvo S80, V70, XC70, XC60, S60, V60 and V40 (model year 2013-), as a technology called Road Sign Information.

Jacques Blanchard

Jacques Blanchard (1600–1638), also known as Jacques Blanchart, was a French baroque painter who was born in Paris. He was raised and taught by his uncle, the painter (ca. 1560–1630). Jacques’s brother and son, (after 1602–1665) and Gabriel Blanchard (1630–1704), respectively were also painters. 
Jacques spent the years from 1624 to 1628 studying in Bologna and Venice. After briefly working in Turin at the court of the Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy (ca. 1628) he returned to France and set himself up in Paris in 1629. Jacques Blanchard is best known for his small religious and mythological paintings. He died in Paris in 1638. This painter should not be confused with the French sculptor of the same name who lived from 1634 to 1689.
Nothing seems to be known of his work before he left for Rome at the age of twenty-four. After two years he moved to Venice, where he remained for two more years. It was there that his style was formed. He then went to Turin, where he worked for the Dukes of Savoy, before returning to France 1628. It is from the brief but productive period after his return that all his dated works survive. They show him to stand quite apart from his contemporaries, not only in his painting style but also in his choice of sensual subject-matter, for example the "Bacchanal" at Nancy.
The chief influences were the sixteenth century painters, especially Titian and Tintoretto with their rich, warm colours, and Veronese, whose blond and silvery colour and limpid light he used most effectively in his small religious and mythological subjects. The several versions of "Charity", depicted as a young woman with two or three children, are excellent examples of his tenderness of colour handling, and of a softness of sentiment nearer to the 18th than to the 17th century. He was also a sensitive portrait painter, and played a leading part in French painting of the 1630s.

Rugosuchus

Rugosuchus (meaning "uneven or wrinkled crocodile", in reference to texturing on its upper jaw bones) is an extinct genus of neosuchian crocodyliform from the late Early Cretaceous of China. It is known from most of a skull, a partial postcranial skeleton, and a second partial skeleton including part of the hips. It was described by Wu and colleagues in 2001, with "R. nonganensis" as the type species. At the time of its description, it was the most complete crocodyliform from northeastern China, and only the second known.
Description and history.
"Rugosuchus" is based on IGV 33, most of a skull. Wu "et al.". assigned two other specimens to this genus: IGV 31, much of a skeleton lacking a skull and most of the limbs; and IGV 32, three vertebrae, a partial hip, and a fragment of thigh bone. These three specimens had been collected in 1958 by the Petroleum Geological Survey of the Song-Liao Basin, and remained unstudied for many years. The locality is near Fulongquan, Nong'an County, Jilin, in the Song-Liao Basin. The formation is not known for certain, but is probably the Nenjiang Formation. The age of the Nenjiang Formation has been debated, but as of the description of "Rugosuchus" was though to be latest Early Cretaceous, based on ostracode, bivalve, and fish fossils.
Skull IGV 33 is thought to have come from an adult, based on the fusion of bones. It is somewhat elongate, being about 28 centimeters (11 in) long but only an estimated 13 centimeters (5 in) at its widest. The maxillae, the main tooth-bearing bones of the upper jaw, had unusual elongate depressions on their sides, nine or ten per maxilla. Other skull bones had heavily textured surfaces, as is seen on other crocodyliforms. The premaxillae at the tip of the snout had five teeth each, and the maxillae 16 or 17, with wide spacing; because the jaws are closed, the teeth of the lower jaw cannot be observed.
Wu "et al.". noted that their new genus was not an eusuchian because of the form of the palatal bones, but it was probably more closely related to the eusuchians than other extinct crocodyliforms like "Goniopholis" by having more than two rows of bony armor running its length, and by the form of the armor. They interpreted "Rugosuchus" as similar to "Bernissartia", "Shamosuchus" and the unnamed "Glen Rose Form", but not as derived. However, a more recent phylogenetic analysis by Turner and Buckley (2008) places it with the "Glen Rose Form" in a clade with Eusuchia, more derived than "Bernissartia".

National Network for Youth

National Network for Youth (NN4Y) was founded in 1974 as the National Network of Runaway and Youth Services (NNRYS). Back then, NNRYS was the membership association of community-based organizations that had emerged in the 1970s to focus on the needs of youth in runaway and homeless situations. Today, NN4Y represents more than 500 community-based organizations that provide an array of services to youth and families in the United States and territories. NN4Y members work with their neighborhood youth, adults, associations, and regional and state networks of youth workers to provide street-based services, emergency shelter, transitional living programs, counseling, and social, health, educational and job-related services to over 2.5 million youth each year.
Funding.
Many of NN4Y's members receive funding through the federal Runaway and Homeless Youth Act of 1974. Funds and practices from the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, the McKinney-Vento Act on homelessness, and the Workforce Investment Act also assist local runaway and homeless youth program operators in leveraging state and local and private funding and accomplishing their mission with a positive youth development philosophy. NN4Y was the architect of the federal Runaway and Homeless Youth Act (RHYA) and still considers that law today as their primary public policy accomplishment. Additionally, NN4Y works closely with Learn & Serve America [http://www.learnandserve.gov/] to engage young people in youth led, youth initiated volunteerism projects in their communities.
Activities.
National Network for Youth (NN4Y) has five focus areas: public policy, professional development, program dissemination, materials development and publication, and Symposium.

In the county jail, Wade gets into a brawl the first night after being attacked by an inmate in the community cell.
After his sentencing is given, he is transferred to Corcoran State Prison. On the bus ride over, Danny Sampson, leader of the local Aryan Brotherhood, kills a man and hides the knife with a young Aryan member sitting behind Wade. In a moment's panic, the young man hides the knife under Wade and forces him to deny knowledge of the knife. As a result, Wade is sent to solitary confinement until the mess can be sorted out. Upon further investigation by Lieutenant Jackson (Harold Perrineau), Jackson is convinced Wade is an accessory to murder, and decides to send Wade to the Security Housing Unit (SHU), of which Jackson is the commanding officer.
Life is tough for Wade in the SHU. In addition to 23-hour lockdown days, and the inability to see his family at first, the 1-hour yard days consist of fights, to which the guards bet on.

In mitra medusa inri

In Mitra Medusa Inri (IMMI) is a German darkwave band formed in 1992, characterized by a blend of melancholic vocals and electro atmospheric gothic-wave.
History.
In 1992, when wave was believed to be dead, In Mitra Medusa Inri was founded. With the intention to convert their events and emotions into music, Volker and Holger started their musical work and Michael joined soon. Only a short time later, they signed their first record deal at Spirit Productions. Very soon various concerts, for example at Zwischenfall ( D-Bochum ) and Kassablanca ( D-Jena ) followed. The reaction of the audience was positive without exception and so the band became famous in the scene. Due to internal problems in 1995 IN MITRA MEDUSA INRI firstly was winded up for a while.
1996
Because a lot of fans demanded Mozart (Spirit Productions) about IMMI and the reason of their musical pause, they made the purpose to the original members of the band to publish a CD. After intensive talks which should eliminate the known problems they decided to restart.
The CD Long forgotten world was produced and sold about 2.000 units. Fans from Italy, Poland, Switzerland and Germany got in touch with the band. Unfortunately, the problems which caused the first cut came up again. Holger and Michael separated from their singer Volker in order to go choose new ways.
1998
Holger and Michael concentrated on organising concerts for a club. Wishing to compose further songs and to take opportunity of the creative output they founded MY PERSONAL COUNTDOWN just a little later. This new project should start at the point where IN MITRA MEDUSA INRI collapsed.
After Volker had published a second CD under the name of IN MITRA MEDUSA INRI in the meantime, his band collapsed definitely. Without further ado Holger and Michael decided to operate again as IN MITRA MEDUSA INRI. The clear statement is: "This band is an important part of our life." The two create new old sounds with the following message: Close your eyes and let yourself fall.
2003
With their actual longplayer Darkness between us (release November 2003, Apollyon) IN MITRA MEDUSA INRI created a world of melancholy, longing and also critical impressions. Far from cliché it offers an individual sound. Ten tracks melting to a work of art, carried by a warm voice and wistful guitars. A collection of emotions coupled with love for details which has the intention to take the listener on a journey to his inner mind. Style: JOY DIVISION meets NEW ORDER meets THE CURE. Darkness between us is a soulfood-album which invites to undiscovered sphere - the masterpiece of IN MITRA MEDUSA INRI so far. Produced by O.Müller ( S.I.T.D. - Cyber Axis - Megadump )
The name.
IN MITRA MEDUSA INRI - a name of phantasy - if you want, a number of expressions. It has, however, a deeper sense, although - or even because - the members of the band, realize and express the meaning of their music in their very own way.
In Greek legends, MEDUSA is described as a female monster/god, whose look lets everything become stone. With their music the band hopes to receive a similar penetrate effect at their listeners.
In form of fish's head MITRA originally symbolized the hat of god Dagon. It counts as a sign of friendship. We, IN MITRA MEDUSA INRI (IMMI) are friends, not just a few people who joined in order to make music. Common ways through ups and downs unite them so that the original meaning of "Mitra" has characterising meaning for the guys.
INRI is the abbreviation for Christian religion (as well as inscription of the cross: Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum, in English: Jesus of Nazareth, king of Jews) - religion need not be a given schema but may be everything - a song, a poem, a feeling.

The American Israelite

The American Israelite is a Jewish weekly newspaper published in Cincinnati, Ohio. Founded in 1854 as The Israelite and assuming its present name in 1874, it is the longest-running English-language Jewish newspaper still published in the United States.
The paper's founder, Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise, and publisher, Edward Bloch and his Bloch Publishing Company, were both very influential figures in American Jewish life.
During the 19th century, "The American Israelite" became the leading organ for Reform Judaism in America. During the early 20th century, it helped geographically dispersed American Jews, especially in the West and the South of the country, keep in touch with Jewish affairs and their religious identity.
Founding and early history.
The first Jewish newspaper published in Cincinnati was the English-language "The Israelite", established on July 15, 1854. It was also among the first Jewish publications in the nation. It was founded by Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise, who became known as the father of Reform Judaism in the United States. Its initial issues were published by Charles F. Schmidt. The paper lost $600 in its first year, and although Wise repaid the publisher out of his own funds, Schmidt terminated the relationship. Edward Bloch and his Bloch Publishing Company began to publish the paper with the issue of July 27, 1855. Bloch, who was Wise's brother-in-law, subsequently became known as the dean of American Jewish publishers.
From the start, the newspaper's motto was יהי אור "Let There Be Light," and still is. Its two goals were to propagate the principles of Reform Judaism and to keep American Jews, who often lived in small towns singly or in communities of two or three families, in touch with Jewish affairs and their religious identity.
The publication, along with "Die Deborah", a German-language supplement that Wise started the following year, soon attracted a large circulation and was influential in helping the nascent Reform Judaism movement spread throughout North America.
Both Wise and the paper had a reach beyond Cincinnati, and especially to the growing Jewish communities in the American Midwest and South.
In 1858, for instance, the members of Congregation B'nai Israel in Memphis, Tennessee advertised for their first rabbi in "The Israelite", at the same time they advertised for a kosher butcher.
Despite its spread, the early years of "The Israelite" were a financial struggle. Most subscribers did not pay their bills, the Panic of 1857 adversely affected it, and the paper lost half its subscribers in the South during the Civil War. Bloch travelled east several times in the late 1850s in order to solicit subscriptions and advertising. Wise's admitted sloppiness in monetary matters did not help either. Nevertheless, the newspaper and Bloch stayed out of bankruptcy and relocated to larger offices twice during this period.
Wise, a prolific writer, published in the editorial columns of "The Israelite" numerous studies on various subjects of Jewish interest.
Besides being the leading organ for American Reform Judaism, it also forcefully defended the civil and religious rights of all Jews.
Wise tirelessly expounded his call to the "ministers and other Israelites" of the United States, urging them to form a union which might put an end to the prevalent religious anarchy. In 1873, twenty-five years after he had first broached the idea, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations was organized at Cincinnati.
Another campaign he presented in the columns of "The Israelite" was the desire for an educational institution, and this eventually led to success in 1875 when the Hebrew Union College opened its doors for the reception of students.
Wise also wrote a number of novels, which appeared first as serials in the "Israelite".
New name and continued influence.
"The Israelite" was renamed "The American Israelite" beginning with the issue of July 3, 1874. The goal was to make the name more in consonance with the ideas it represented. Despite the change, the paper continued to cover and advocate for not only American Jews but also Jews around the world. By 1879, a typical issue had eight pages 28-by-42-inch in size, and a subscription cost $4, or $5 if the "Die Deborah" four-page supplement was included.
Rabbi Wise's son Leo Wise, who had become business manager for the paper in 1875, took over as its publisher from 1883 to 1884, and then he did so again, permanently, in 1888 (due apparently to some kind of rupture between Leo Wise and Bloch).
A sister publication, "The Chicago Israelite", was started in 1885. The papers stressed their reputation in trade publications, stating "None but clean advertisements of reputable houses accepted."
Leo Wise gradually took over the principle editorial functions from his father, but Rabbi Wise remained active on the paper until his death on March 26, 1900, writing an editorial for it just a few days before. Ownership then passed to Leo Wise.
By 1900, "The American Israelite", in combination with "The Chicago Israelite", claimed a circulation of other 35,000, about 12,000 in Ohio and Illinois and the balance spread across almost every other state as well as Canada and Mexico. The publication "Printer's Ink" said they had the largest guaranteed circulation of any Jewish newspaper in the U.S., and it continued to be especially strong in the West and the South. One 1902 book characterized "The American Israelite" as "the leading Jewish newspaper in the United States and the National Journal of the Jews."
In the early 20th century, the paper's short articles were sometimes picked up and run by "The New York Times" with a credit "From The American Israelite". In those years, "The American Israelite" became known for its very strong stance against the new Zionism movement, calling it in 1902 a "pernicious agitation" that would undermine the acceptance of Jews in the countries where they currently resided. Rabbi David Philipson was among the editorial contributors to the paper who used it to oppose Zionism, arguing that Judaism was a religion exclusively, and thus stateless. Other noted contributors to the paper in this era included Rabbi Moses Mielziner and Jewish history scholar Gotthard Deutsch, as well as other prominent rabbis and Jewish thinkers within the country. The paper gave extensive coverage to the goings-on of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations and the Hebrew Union College (and was sometimes viewed as a publication of them), as well as notices of various rabbinical conferences.
"Die Deborah" was discontinued after Isaac Wise's death, then resumed for a while.
"The Chicago Israelite" ceased publication in 1920.
Leo Wise edited "The American Israelite" until his retirement at age 78 in 1928 (he died in 1933). Another son of Isaac, Isidor Wise, worked as a writer and associate editor for the paper until his death in 1929.
Subsequent history.
Leo Wise was succeeded as editor and publisher of "The American Israelite" in 1928 by his half-brother, Rabbi Jonah Wise of New York, who remained in that city and who himself became a long-time leader of American Reform Judaism.
The Jonah Wise arrangement did not last long, and in 1930, journalist Henry C. Segal bought the paper and became its editor and publisher for more than five decades, until his death in 1985. Along with Isaac Wise, Segal is still named on the paper's masthead. Contributors to the newspaper in this era included writer Donald Swerdlow (later Don Canaan).
By the 1990s, the paper was focusing on local Jewish news.
In 1995, "The American Israelite" was sued for $2 million by an Ohio lawyer for calling him and his son anti-Semitic.
By 2010, Ted Deutsch was the editor and publisher. A typical issue ran 24 pages, with color front and back pages and black-and-white inside. Some stories were locally written, while many others were run from the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. It published full facsimile copies of its issues on its website.

Nothobranchiidae

Nothobranchiidae are a family of bony fishes containing roughly 300 species. They are small killifish, usually measuring about . They are essentially limited to Africa, and were formerly included in the family Aplocheilidae (that family is now limited to Malagasy and Asian species, and the single West African "Pseudepiplatys annulatus"). They live in fresh water but are somewhat salt-tolerant. They are also found in muddy or brackish water. Some species are kept as aquarium pets. They have frilly fins and many are brightly colored.
Members of genus "Nothobranchius" are found in mud pools on the plains of Africa, a habitat shared by no other fish except the lungfishes. Their life cycle is only a year long – and they die when the pools dry up, however the species survive because their eggs remain inactive (in diapause) in the dry bottom substrate throughout the dry season. (This is not true for lungfish, which are capable of surviving seasonal drying out of their habitats by burrowing into mud and estivating throughout the dry season. They can live to be at least 80 years of age.) Pools of this type are often sprayed with poison to reduce mosquito populations, which also kills the fish. As might be expected with short-lived species living in an ephemeral habitat, many of these fish reach sexual maturity within weeks of hatching, and are prolific breeders.
"Nothobranchiidae furzeri" is the shortest-living vertebrate that can be bred in captivity, having a lifespan of between three to nine months. "Nothobranchius furzeri" needs much food because it grows quickly, so when food supplied is inadequate, bigger fish will eat the smaller fish.

Braindead Soundmachine

Braindead Soundmachine were an industrial rock band and the brainchild of founding members Cole Coonce, Warren Croyle (aka "Mr. Reality"), and the late Ikky Shivers. Eschewing the genre "industrial", they coined the name "metaldisco" in reference to their musical style.
History.
Braindead Soundmachine was founded in Los Angeles, California in 1989 as a joint effort between Coonce and speed metal record producer Croyle, as they conceptualized "metaldisco," a genre that melded Black Sabbath riffs topped by disco-y rhythm guitar and ethereal female vocals. The band was rounded out by Shivers, a Los Angeles sound engineer, whose aural contribution consisted of non-musical screeching noises coerced out of his collections of refurbished vintage analog synthesizers.
Following Coonce's edict that "singers are like spark plugs, you screw them in and then you screw them out," Braindead utilized the services of sundry female vocalists, including those of Joan Jones from Sun 60, Khalsoum Salloum and JenJen (Jenny Homer from Downy Mildew).
As "a band obsessed with drag racing, drag queens and the apocalyptic downfall of the entertainment industry," Braindead reveled in the absurdity of life in Los Angeles, as well as in its own anarchy.
The band followed a simple ethos that "there are no mistakes", with only one rule: "no chord changes".
The band's zen anarchic approach to making music was also informed by its insistence that Yoshi, a transplanted Japanese transvestite working as a cocktail waitress in East Hollywood, was in fact "Dogvillasan", a deity (or "Coyote God") summoned by the group in the song of the same name.
In 1990, and with the band's theology, philosophy and musical approach finalized, Braindead procured a recording contract with Chicago's Wax Trax! Records, which put out the band's first long-playing compact disc, "Come Down from the Hills and Make My Baby".
Singles from that album included "I'm in Jail", and a throbbing, discordant cover of Patsy Cline's "Walkin' After Midnight" (whose release included remixes of the song produced by KMFDM founder Sascha Konietzko).
In 1992, Coonce scored the Greg Araki indie film "The Living End", a "queer" road movie that also featured Braindead's version of the Jesus and Mary Chain song that gave the film its title.
As Wax Trax! began to succumb to an eventual collapse and bankruptcy, Braindead sought to extricate itself from their contract.
With their release eventually granted, Braindead's second album, "Give Me Something Hard I Can Take To My Grave", was distributed on Shiver Records in the US, and Artlos in Europe.
The group disbanded in 1994 during pre-production for its never-released third album, after Mr. Reality suggested taking the band's ethos of only using one chord per composition into further musical deconstruction by mandating new songs use only "one note," an idea that Coonce found unworkable.
After its creative collapse, the three founding members quit music and procured employment as sound engineers in game shows and the adult film industry, an existential downturn documented in Coonce's memoirs about the music business, released in 2005 and also entitled "Come Down from the Hills and Make My Baby".
In 1995, the band re-grouped for its final musical endeavor, recording the source music in Dan Zukovic's cult film "The Last Big Thing". With its scathing satirical attack on the entertainment culture of Los Angeles, the film's ethos is quite similar to Braindead's.
Eventually Coonce changed occupations and became a freelance drag strip journalist of some renown, writing for publications as varied as "National Dragster", "Hot Rod Magazine" and "WIRED". This pursuit peaked with feature-length book on the history of the land speed record, "Infinity Over Zero".
In 2007, JenJen collaborated with Coonce in a new musical venture entitled Prozac Pop Machine. Their first single is "Shampoo" and is currently available podcast-only.
Croyle is now CEO of the multi-media conglomerate Reality Entertainment. Originally an outlet for ponderous and aggressive speed metal bands, in 2006 Reality signed seminal disco music superstars KC and the Sunshine Band to a recording contract, a move which Croyle heralded by stating that: "KC has affected generations of music lovers around the world, we are thrilled to have KC on the Reality roster." It could be argued that with its signing of KC and The Sunshine Band, and by finally synergistically melding heavy metal with disco, Reality Entertainment succeeded where Braindead failed. Ikky Shivers died in June, 2001.
Musical style.
In interviews, Braindead has never been shy about citing their influences. They ripped off N.W.A's hip hop drum machine sound, Black Sabbath's bass lines and the guitar stylings of Chic, Fela Kuti and Funkadelic. The floaty, dreamy and drolly defiant female vocals are reminiscent of Julee Cruise and Leslie Gore.

1949 Rose Bowl

The 1949 Rose Bowl was a college football bowl game. It was the 35th Rose Bowl Game, and the third since the Big Nine Conference and Pacific Coast Conference (PCC) agreed to an exclusive agreement to match their conference champions. The Northwestern Wildcats defeated the 20-14. Northwestern halfback Frank Aschenbrenner was named the Rose Bowl Player Of The Game when the award was created in 1953 and selections were made retroactively. The Wildcats were underdogs going into the game but pulled off an upset. Until the 2013 Gator Bowl, this was the only bowl game win in the history of Northwestern Wildcats football program.
Teams.
Northwestern Wildcats.
Northwestern had finished 8-2 in the Big 9 conference, losing only to perennial powerhouses Michigan (0–28) and Notre Dame (7–12). Northwestern blanked 19–0, 21–0, and 48–0. Northwestern rallied from three turnovers and a 16-point deficit to defeat Minnesota 19–16 as well as defeating Ohio State 21–7, Wisconsin 16–7, and 20–7. Big 9 conference "no repeat" rule prevented two-time champion Michigan from making a second consecutive trip to the Rose Bowl, so second-place Northwestern received the invitation to the game.
California Golden Bears.
California had a perfect record going into the game and had averaged 28 points per game over the course of the season. Although neither team had faced each other before, Coach Waldorf had previously been the Wildcats coach from 1935 to 1946 before leaving for the Golden Bears. Northwestern head coach Bob Voigts was only 33 years old and had been named an All-American in 1938 playing for Waldorf.
Game summary.
Frank Aschenbrenner ran 73 yards, the longest touchdown return in Rose Bowl history. In the second quarter, the Wildcats were awarded a touchdown in a controversial call when Art Murakowski fumbled the ball entering the endzone, but miss the point-after. Although Jensen is injured early in the third quarter, Cal mounted a 56-yard drive for a touchdown and point-after giving them a one-point lead. In the fourth quarter, with less than 3 minutes and 88 yards to go, the Wildcats launched a historic drive: Aschenbrenner made the only complete pass of the game to Stonesifer for 18 yards, followed by a 14-yard run by Perricone, a 5-yard penalty against Cal, and then a Statue of Liberty play and 45-yard run by Ed Tunnicliff for a touchdown. The Bears attempted a passing drive in the last minute, but PeeWee Day intercepted a pass to end Cal's hopes of a title.
Both Aschenbrenner's and Jensen's runs were from scrimmage, not returns. Final touchdown was not a "statue of liberty" play but involved a direct snap from center to a running back (Tunnicliff) from a T-formation set.

Stúdentspróf

The Stúdentspróf () is the university entrance examination in Iceland, which takes place towards the end of the last term in gymnasium. Studies leading to the Stúdentspróf generally take three to four years to complete, but in some cases a diploma containing fewer years of study can be regarded as a sufficient equivalent. Most students finish their Stúdentspróf in their 20th year of age, after 14 years of formal schooling.
The curricula for the examination are regulated by the Ministry of Education. Schools specialising in these curricula are called "menntaskólar" (grammar schools) but they are also offered by nearly all "fjölbrautaskólar" (comprehensive schools), and in fact, any secondary school can offer the Stúdentspróf as long as it conforms to the ministry's regulations.

Calgarypuck

Calgary Puck is an online community of ice hockey enthusiasts, primarily supported by fans of the Calgary Flames. Calgary Puck, also known as "CP", "CalP" and "CPuckers" is visited by thousands of people every day.[http://www.calgarypuck.com/about/] The site provides information and discussion through proactive moderation of the board, making it a source for its fan base and casual browsers alike. The Calgary Puck community prides themselves in maintaining integrity in discussions of all things related to both the Flames and the National Hockey League. Flames employees, players and local sportswriters have been known to frequent the site, including team President and CEO Ken King, and former player Andrew Ference, both of whom have interacted with members via the forums.
History.
Calgary Puck was originally founded by Calgary Herald writer Mike Board. In the year 2000 Board merged the site with current owner and writer D'arcy McGrath's Fire on Ice forum. McGrath's user name on CP is "Bingo". Board has since moved on, leaving McGrath at the helm as both owner and publisher of the site. Calgary Puck bills itself as "the premier Calgary Flames fan site on the Internet". It features news and analysis on the Flames, as well as an active message board.
Calgary Puck Culture.
Like many Internet forums, Calgary Puck has some unique cultural memes.
Calgary Puckers often refer to re-posts of the same news articles or discussions as "Fatas" or "Red Hot Fatas". This came about after numerous new threads were started simultaneously to announce that former first round draft pick Rico Fata had been claimed by the New York Rangers on waivers in the 2001–02 season.
Flames' sixth defenceman David Hale, nicknamed "the Hale Storm" by Calgary Puck members, was an unlikely local hero during the 2008 Stanley Cup Playoffs. Led by Calgary Puck members, fans in the Pengrowth Saddledome took to emphasizing the word "HALE" during the American national anthem when the line ""...what so proudly we hailed..."" was sung. Fans as far away as Halifax, Nova Scotia helped to popularize the player most notable for having played more games than any other player without scoring a goal.
Source of Inside Information.
The CP user "Potty" had information regarding the Calgary Flames signing of Todd Bertuzzi on July 6, 2008. This was a full day before TSN announced and confirmed the signing on July 7, 2008. Calgary's Fan960 radio personality and blogger Pat Steinberg credited the site for having the information first.
Flames President and CEO Ken King has at times made himself available to talk directly to the fan base on the site under the user name "kinger", his identification was verified by the moderation team. King made his first appearance in February 2005 to discuss fan reaction to the cancellation of the 2004–05 NHL season due to the ongoing lockout. Former Flame Andrew Ference also interacted with fans on site under the handle "okotoker". Upon his trade to the Boston Bruins in 2007, Ference left a message on Calgary Puck thanking the fans of Calgary for their support.
Calgarypuck was also the first to break news of Rene Bourque's 6 year, 20 million dollar extension. They did so almost a week in advance to the official release.

Selfotel

Selfotel (CGS-19755) is a drug which acts as a competitive NMDA antagonist, directly competing with glutamate for binding to the receptor. Initial studies showed it to have anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, analgesic and neuroprotective effects, and it was originally researched for the treatment of stroke, but subsequent animal and human studies showed phencyclidine-like effects, as well as limited efficacy and evidence for possible neurotoxicity under some conditions, and so clinical development was ultimately discontinued.

Melchior de Gualbes

Melchior de Gualbes (also spelled Melcior) was a Catalan knight, politician, and author of three short poems. His poetry is preserved in the Cançoner Vega-Aguiló, in a section badly damaged by humidity. Only the use of ultraviolet radiation has made possible full readings of all his pieces. 
The Gualbes family of bankers played an active role in the local government of Barcelona during the interregnum between 1410 and 1412. They supported Ferdinand of Antequera and were richly rewarded on his accession. Bernat de Gualbes sat on the council which decided the Compromise of Caspe and Melchior was the messenger who, in a rapid journey of seven hours, brought the news of the Compromise to the Parliament convened at Tortosa. In 1413 Ferdinand rewarded Melchior for his service with the castellany of Castellví de Rosanes and the procuratorship of Martorell. That same year Alfonso the Magnanimous, Aragonese "infante", appointed Melchior commissioner of the regions Girona and Roussillon. 
Melchior was of the same generation as the poets Jordi de Sant Jordi, Andreu Febrer, and Gilabert de Próixita. In his poetry love was de-sensualised and idealised. The phrase "cor gentil" ("gentle heart"), a favourite of the "stilnovisti", appears in his poem "Molt m'es plasens, belha, com senyorega". This phrase was ignored by the Occitan troubadours and in this way Melchior appears more influenced by the Italians. Other phrases borrowed from Petrarch and Dante Alighieri have been found in Melchior's poetry. His metre and diction are nonetheless influenced by the troubadour lyric. His other poems are "Acompanyat d'un amoros desir" and "Pus me suy mes en l'amorosa questa".

Owen Glenn

Sir Owen George Glenn (born 19 February 1940) is an expatriate New Zealand businessman and philanthropist, who supports hundreds of humanitarian causes worldwide through his family charity.
Born in Calcutta, India, his family emigrated to New Zealand in 1952. Glenn attended Balmoral Intermediate School and Mount Roskill Grammar School in Auckland.
Career.
Mr. Glenn is the founder and former executive chairman of Vanguard Logistics Services, which is the USA's largest neutral non-vessel operating common carrier industry participant and among the top five largest NVOCCs in the world. He stated "Top quality business education is vital to the future success of New Zealand and I am delighted to be able to help in this way and to be a part of the vision of the business school and The University of Auckland."
Philanthropy.
In 2002, Glenn donated $7.5 million to the University of Auckland for the development of the Business School’s premises and facilities and ongoing improvements. This contribution is believed to be the largest private donation in New Zealand educational history, and was driven by Mr. Glenn's belief in the business school's mission and in the benefits high quality business education holds for New Zealand business and society. As a result of this gift the business school’s complex, opened in early 2008, was named the Owen G. Glenn Building. Owen Glenn followed his initial $7.5 million donation by, in 2008, donating an additional $500,000 to establish the Barry Spicer and Owen G Glenn PhD Scholarships. These scholarships received matched funding of $250,000.
Glenn was also the potential candidate for diplomatic posting overseas in Monaco, where he would represent the people of New Zealand interest's there. His political donations to the New Zealand Labour Party and the New Zealand First Party, which both the political parties denied receiving, caused some controversy in New Zealand politics. 
On 9 September 2008, Glenn voluntarily provided evidence to the New Zealand Parliament's Privileges Committee regarding the accuracy of statements made by Winston Peters, Leader of the New Zealand First Party, about the donations Mr. Glenn had given to Peters. Parliament ultimately censured Peters for failing to declare the donations, which New Zealand Law requires of all political parties. Glenn was thanked by Parliament.
Mr. Glenn supports a number of international charities through The Glenn Family Foundation and helped establish the International SeaKeepers Society. Owen Glenn provided huge support for Hockey NZ through the Glenn Family Foundation, this has helped Hockey NZ achieve rights to the hosting of the 2011 Champions Trophy which was taken from India due to organisation failures.
Following a 6.3-magnitude earthquake that struck New Zealand's South Island in February 2011, Owen Glenn donated $1 million to the Christchurch quake recovery fund on behalf of the Glenn Family Foundation. He stated "I grew up in New Zealand, it holds a special place in my heart and to see such devastation, such hurt and such loss makes you want to help. This donation is something I can do and I strongly urge other expatriate business people to do the same. We all need to pull together and while we are a small country, it is a country made up of people with huge hearts. That's what gets you through in times like this."
Honours and awards.
In the New Year Honours 2008 Glenn was appointed an Officer of The New Zealand Order of Merit "for services to business and the community". 
In May 2011, Owen Glenn was awarded CPA Australia's highest honour - Honorary Fellow of CPA (FCPA) - in recognition of his global entrepreneurial success.
In the New Year Honours 2013 Glenn was promoted to a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for "services to philanthropy".

<doc id="18486383" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18486383" title="Chance Magazine">
Chance Magazine

Chance was a men's monthly magazine founded in Sydney in 1966 by Gareth Powell Associates, which was basically Gareth Powell in association with Jack de Lissa. It used Playboy and Penthouse magazines as a model, creating a magazine that Australia had not seen before with both pictures of beautiful unclothed ladies and articles worth reading. The magazine was originally printed in Australia with the Griffin Press in Adelaide but almost immediately switched to Hong Kong as high quality printing at an affordable price was not then available in Australia.
In 1968, the Australian customs seized an issue of "Chance" at the wharf as it was being imported from Hong Kong on grounds that it was generally obscene and the point was made that it was published without permission, that is, the Customs had not been given a copy to approve before printing. One feature that annoyed and puzzled them was a cartoon strip called Barbarella, later made into a film starring Jane Fonda. The judge in the Equity Court in an early hearing ruled against Gareth Powell, and said in his summing up: 'I am not sure what Barbarella was about but I suspect lesbianism.' He ordered that issue of the magazine to be destroyed.
The dispute was a landmark case. An agreement had been reached, without consulting the plaintiff, that Customs officers would not have to give evidence. If this had not been the case and the customs officers had been made to give evidence, they would have been forced to either commit perjury or accept the magazine was not in breach of community standards. This resulted in the Australian customs, in effect, ceasing to take a moral view on the content of printed matter entering the country.
In the early 1970s, Gareth Powell sold "Chance", and other magazines he published including POL magazine, and moved his operations to Hong Kong.
The magazine published works by some of Australia's best young photographers and was in many ways a breakthrough publication for Australia in terms of printing quality, photography and design.
