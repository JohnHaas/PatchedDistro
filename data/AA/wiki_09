Three of a Kind (The X-Files)

"Three of a Kind" is the twentieth episode of the sixth season of the science fiction television series "The X-Files". It premiered on the Fox network on May 2, 1999 in the United States. The episode was written by Vince Gilligan and John Shiban, and directed by Bryan Spicer. The episode is a "Monster-of-the-Week" story, unconnected to the series' wider mythology. "Three of a Kind" earned a Nielsen household rating of 8.2, being watched by 12.9 million people in its initial broadcast. The episode received mixed reviews from critics, with many noting that the episode served as a stop-gap.
The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. In this episode, The Lone Gunmen run into the enigmatic Susanne Modeski. After deceiving Scully into joining them, the trio soon find out that Susanne's fiancé is planning to use her new brainwashing drug for political assassinations. 
"Three of a Kind" functions as a sequel of sorts to the fifth season episode "Unusual Suspects", concluding the story of The Lone Gunmen and Susanne Modeski, the woman who led to the creation of the trio. While Mulder played a supporting role in "Unusual Suspects", the concept is reversed in "Three of a Kind", with Scully helping out The Lone Gunmen.
Plot.
During a high stakes poker game Lone Gunman John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood) is thrown out after being exposed as a fraud at a government convention in Las Vegas. Unbeknownst to Richard Langly (Dean Haglund) and Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood), Byers is still harboring an attraction to Susanne Modeski, a fellow conspirator who mysteriously disappeared almost ten years ago. Byers hopes that he will meet her at the convention.
The Gunmen cleverly trick Agent Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) into coming to Las Vegas using a text to speech program. Their friend Jimmy uses his special technique for gaining access to a secret meeting room where he believes he will learn about new assassination techniques employed by the government. However, Jimmy is discovered and injected with a mystery drug which forces him to kill himself. Meanwhile, Byers discovers that Susanne is alive and well, but has seemingly become a secretive government agent.
Scully performs Jimmy's autopsy when she is attacked by an agent who injects something into her, who collapses. After being confronted by Byers, Susanne reveals that she is pretending to have switched sides so she, along with her fiancee Grant Ellis, can slow progress on the government's harmful initiatives. She works alongside the Gunmen to set up Grant, whom she discovers has been lying to her.
Timmy, the late Jimmy's friend, asks Langly to attend a Dungeons & Dragons game in Jimmy's honor. The game, however, is a setup to inject Langly with a drug that effectively controls the subject's mind, much like Scully and Jimmy. Frohike finds an extremely flirtatious Scully at the bar with a large cluster of men around her. He takes her back to the suite where Susanne recognizes the effects of the drug, which she identifies as anoetic histamine. She reveals that she had not actually made the compound, except for a small batch accessible only to her and Grant, confirming his betrayal.
Susanne counteracts the weapon's effect on Scully as Langly returns. Langly reports to Timmy the next morning and is given his instructions: Enter the meeting room using the provided pass and fire three rounds into Susanne Modeski. Scully attempts to enter the meeting hall but is stopped by security outside. Langly draws a gun and shoots Susanne Modeski three times in the chest during the break. Scully comes in with the guard and has him call for an ambulance. Byers and Frohike arrive as the EMTs and take her away on a stretcher. It is revealed that Susanne realized Langly had been injected and counteracted the drug's effect on him. Together, Scully, Susanne, and the Lone Gunmen orchestrated an elaborate ruse to allow Susanne to escape. Unfortunately the ruse fails, as Timmy Landau tastes the "blood" on the floor and realizes it is just corn syrup.
Grant Ellis is taken to Susanne Modeski by Scully so she can confront him about why he gave the drug to the government. She is furious as she could have been killed had she not checked Langly the night before. Ellis admits that he only betrayed her because the government threatened his own life. Timmy arrives, guns down Grant Ellis, and takes Susanne to the Lone Gunmen's suite.
Timmy prepares to gun down Langly and Frohike, but is injected with the mind control drug by Byers. As it takes hold of him and he collapses, and the Lone Gunmen successful mind control him into turning himself in. Byers explains to Susanne Modeski that, for all intents and purposes, she is deceased and that she has a new identity. She asks Byers to go with her to start a new life, but he explains he has to keep up the fight. She kisses him goodbye and hands over a wedding ring meant for Grant Ellis.
Production.
Background and writing.
"Three of a Kind" functions as a sequel of sorts to the fifth season episode "Unusual Suspects", concluding a minor story-arc featuring The Lone Gunmen and Susanne Modeski, the woman who led to the creation of the trio. At the time of filming for "Three of a Kind", David Duchovny, who portrays Fox Mulder, was unavailable for filming because he was preparing his directing debut, "The Unnatural". Only David Duchovny's voice appears in the episode, during a scene when The Lone Gunmen electronically synthesize it in order to convince Scully to travel to Las Vegas. In order to compensate for this loss, co-executive producers Vince Gilligan and John Shiban decided to write an episode based around The Lone Gunmen. The two wanted to bring back several characters and unresolved plot lines, mostly notably the disappearance of Susanne Modeski. Gilligan explained, "I'd been thinking a lot about what happened to Susanne Modeski—what happened to her after she drove off with X in that mysterious car at the end of 'Unusual Suspects'". Gilligan and Shiban soon formulated a plot that revolved around the Lone Gunmen in Las Vegas. "Las Vegas just seemed a really good place to put these guys. First of all, because the idea of them running through a casino is instantly hilarious. But the other thing [...] is that Las Vegas is in some ways the most watched city in the world". Furthermore, Michael McKean, who portrayed Morris Fletcher in the two-part episode "Dreamland", makes a brief cameo as one of the men flirting with Scully.
The entire sub-plot featuring Susanne Modeski caused a minor continuity error that had to be retconned. Bruce Harwood, the actor who portrayed Byers, originally wore a wedding ring when he first portrayed the character, noting, "I'd worn my wedding ring the first part of the series so I imagined a married life for Byers". During the filming of "Unusual Suspects"—an episode that would largely feature Byers feeling a romantic connection to Susanne—Harwood removed his wedding ring, deducing that in 1989, when the episode took place, Byers had not been married yet. However, "Three of a Kind"—which takes place in 1998—features Byers once again romantically drawn to Susanne. Harwood explained, "And then producers brought back the character Suzanne Modeski back in season six, and that was supposed to be in the present. So I had to redo my back story; I said Byers had been divorced".
Filming.
Despite budgetary constraints, the crew of "The X-Files" were given the green-light to film on location in Las Vegas. This would make Las Vegas only one of the few cities to effectively "play itself" in the series. However, only two days were scheduled for Las Vegas, and most of the scenes were filmed in California at the Century Plaza and Park Hyatt, two hotels relatively close to the Fox studio. Furthermore, Gillian Anderson never had to leave Los Angeles to film the episode. Location manager Ilt Jones noted that "The X-Files" crew's desire to film on location at various hotels in Las Vegas caused a bidding war, "We went down this list of forty or fifty hotels known to be film-friendly. [...] At first, the reaction was sort of luke-warm, then all of a sudden someone realized that this was "The X-Files", for heavens sake, seen by I-can't-tell-you-how-many millions [...] then this huge bidding war broke out". Eventually, Monte Carlo Resort and Casino was selected for shooting. In exchange for a special billing denoting "Production Assistance Provided by" and several shots of the hotel's name appearing in the episode, "The X-Files" crew received fee-free permission to film anywhere in the hotel during day hours, full access to the hotel's illuminated message board.
Broadcast and reception.
"Three of a Kind" first aired in the United States on May 2, 1999. This episode earned a Nielsen rating of 8.2, with a 12 share, meaning that roughly 8.2 percent of all television-equipped households, and 12 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. It was viewed by 12.94 million viewers. The episode aired in the United Kingdom and Ireland on Sky1 on July 4, 1999 and received 0.87 million viewers, making it the second most watched episode that week. Fox promoted the episode with the tagline "What's gotten into Scully? Tonight, when Scully hits Vegas, you'll see a side of her you've never seen before."
The episode received mostly mixed reviews from critics, with many noting that the episode served as a stop-gap. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book "Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen", rated "Three of a Kind" two-and-a-half stars out of five, calling the episode "likeable and good-natured, and utterly redundant, this passes forty-five minutes pleasantly enough, but you'll be hard pushed to remember them afterwards". Paula Vitaris from "Cinefantastique" gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris noted that the episode did "an adequate job, but all in all, this is a filler episode, more substitutes than the real thing".
Tom Kessenich, in his book "Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files" wrote that, "'Three of a Kind' took the premise the Lone Gunmen and ran with it, offering up a quasi-entertaining effort that indulges trio's paranoia, banishes Mulder from sight and offers up a very flirtatious Dana Scully. It was all cute and harmless. Kinda like The Lone Gunmen themselves." Zack Handlen of "The A.V. Club" awarded the episode a "B+" and called it "the second part of a story which didn’t really need one" but also noted that the "laid-back, let’s just hang out and have some fun vibe" of the episode made the entry "very, very easy to watch." Furthermore, he praised the scene wherein Scully is drugged, calling it "hilarious" and "glorious".

Marvin Brown grew up in the Methodist Orphanage home in Waco, Texas from age 5-17. The home took Brown and his sister Alice in after they found them digging through trash cans in the area. Their mother was not able to take care of them and they were living with their grandfather who worked security at night and slept during the day. While at the Orphanage, Marvin met and was coached by J. M White. White had a large influence on Marvin's life. Brown ran away from the orphanage at age 17 and White got Marvin a scholarship at Tarleton State University, where he was voted best player in Tarleton History, was All Conference three years, led the conference in rushing and punt returns and intercepted 10 passes. He was voted most valuable player and Jr. College All American. He was inducted into Tarelton's Hall of Fame later in life. From there he went to East Taxas State University (Now Texas A & M Commerce) on a football scholarship and played for "Catfish" Smith, who once said Marvin was the greatest football player he ever coached. Marvin received his Bachelors and Masters from this University. While at East Texas State he was voted Most Valuable Player in the 1953 Tangerine Bowl (now the Capital One Bowl), he was ranked 9th nationally in scoring, had the longest run of 107 yards in one game (a record that stood for years), was an All American and still holds 9 records at the school in football. In track, he ran the 100-yard dash in 9.5 seconds and was all conference in the 100 and 220. Brown was inducted into East Texas Hall of Fame in the 1970s.
Marvin was in the Air Force from 1953-1956 and completed his flight training in 1956 and then played for the Detroit Lions for one year and then served in the Vietnam War from 1968-1969. From 1958 to 1991, Brown was a commercial airline pilot, flying for Braniff for 16 years and Continental Airline for seven years.
Brown was also a world-class tennis player. He took up tennis at the age of 45 and was consistently ranked in the top three seniors in the state of Texas, a top-10 senior player in the United States and a top 20 player in the world. He represented the United States in the Senior Division of the World Cup for a number of years in New Zealand, Austria and Turkey along with his team Captain Russel Seymore.

<doc id="18260230" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18260230" title="Karbi, Armenia">
Karbi, Armenia

Karbi () is a village in the Aragatsotn Province of Armenia situated near the town of Ashtarak. Within the area is a triple-nave basilica of S. Astvatsatsin dated to 1691-93 with an unattached adjacent belfry of 1338. In the village are also S. Gevorg or S. Kiraki church of the 11th to 13th centuries, Tsiranavor, a Tukh Manuk shrine, and "Zargarents Jam" chapel built between the 11th and 13th centuries.
History.
Karbi was recorded in manuscripts as early as the 13th century and is also mentioned in an inscription of the same period upon the southern wall of the Katoghike Church of the Astvatsnkal Monastery built between the 5th and 13th centuries. It reads, 
The history of Karbi has been one marked by invasions, destruction and plundering. In the manuscripts (late 14th to mid-15th centuries) written by Thomas of Metsoph, he left an account of the invasions of Timur Lenk in the 14th century and stated that, "Next came to the Araratean country and Karbi and the Kotayk country." During this time, development in the village was suspended. 
In the first half of the 17th century, Karbi was severely damaged in the Perso-Turkish wars. After the period of peace ensuing in 1639, restoration of the buildings began and trade broadened. 
In 1724, the Ottoman military commanders Güç Ali and Yalguz Hasan were dispatched under the orders of Abdullah Pasha to advance and lay siege to Karbi, and plunder the village and enslave its inhabitants. Each of the leaders originally had under thir command approximately 1,800 soldiers, and had suffered high casualties during their advance on the city of Yerevan at a battle near Yeghvard in March 1724. 
The residents of Karbi learned of the advancing armies and began to fortify their settlement to help defend against the Ottoman army. Village elders sent a messenger to Khan Mehr Ali of Yerevan with word that, "The Ottoman army has arrived and laid siege to Karbi. If you are willing to send troops, we are ready to defend our town with our lives. We shall attack the enemy and shall drive them out." The Khan of Yerevan did not respond to their urgent plea, nor did he send his troops. 
The residents of the village decided to stand firm and defend their land from the invading forces, and successfully did so for forty days. Abdullah Pasha came with his troops to support his two military commanders, but did not attack Karbi. He instead sent word and asked that the village return to being subject to the Ottoman Empire, and in return he would leave troops behind to protect them. The elders asked for ten days to convince the other defenders to submit to the Pasha. He agreed to their request. 
During these ten days, the elders secretly sent a message to Khan Mehr Ali of Yerevan and said, "Besieged by Ottoman forces, we were forced to give our word to the Ottoman commander that we would surrender Karbi in ten days, for we cannot withstand such a large army. Tell us what we should do." The Khan gave a response that he would send gunpowder as well as small cannons, and ordered for them not to surrender but instead to keep fighting as they have. He added that, "Your Catholicos, Asdvadzadur, has gone to see Shah Tahmasp to seek advice on this dangerous conflict which is upon us. Have patience, therefore, until we hear some news of assistance from them."
The elders decided after the end of the ten days to return control of Karbi to Abdullah Pasha's army. The Ottoman's sent word to "Prepare to submit and surrender your arms." When asked how many residents were living in the confines of the village, the elders responded that "There are some six thousand individuals." The residents did as was asked of them and surrendered their weapons to the Ottoman army. The Pasha gave each of the high elders a "kalat" which are robes of honor made of fine material, and also ordered that six companies of troops stay behind to guard the village. He then went on with the rest of his troops to lay siege to Yerevan.
Karbi is known to have had a brief visit during October 1734 by Abraham Kretatsi during the time while he was serving the Catholicos Abraham II. He wrote, "The next day, at my request, we went to Parpi and from there to Karbi, where we spent the night at the residences of Paron Khachatur and Paron Ohazar."

Crossroads (series)

The Crossroads is an ongoing high fantasy series of books written by Kate Elliott consisting of three books to date. The story takes place in a land known as the Hundred, as well as several neighbouring lands. The story revolves around a large cast of characters who struggle against a growing army that is slowly covering the land with its shadow. The army is led by a mysterious group of people known as Guardians, and in particular by a woman. The ultimate goal of the Guardians is yet to be revealed.
Book One: "Spirit Gate".
In the first book in the Crossroads series, we are introduced to Reeve Joss, a proud and vain man who searches for answers to the murder of his lover Marit. At the same time, newlywed couple Mai and Anji are sent into exile when political turmoil threatens their lives. They decide to go to the Hundred and start a new life with an entourage of servants and soldiers under Anji's command.
The outlanders soon find that this new land that they thought would be a resting place has been thrown into turmoil as bands of brigands and thieves pillage small villages and a much larger army stands poised to attack the cities. Looming over the intersecting paths of each lead character is the question of where the Guardians have gone. Why did they abandon their people, and what has happened to them?
Book Two: "Shadow Gate".
The second book focuses on the Guardians. We are introduced to Marit, the Reeve who died at the beginning of the series. Early in the book, it is revealed that somehow she was brought back from death before she could pass through the Spirit Gate and into an afterlife. As Marit searches for answers about who she has become, she encounters several other Guardians who were once ordinary people: a young woman named Kiriya who came from the plains beyond the Hundred, the long-lost brother Hari who outlanders Mai and Shai believe to be dead, and a man who dresses as an envoy of Ilu. Meanwhile, after the successful defence of the city of Olossi, the Qin have begun to settle down and build their own community around a new Reeve Hall nicknamed Naya Hall after the oil of naya that repelled the invaders. Bai accompanies a small band of men and a woman to infiltrate the army in the North, while her brother Kesh travels back to the southern lands to find out information about a group of assassins that has been sent to kill Anji and his men.
The Eight Children.
According to the beliefs of the folk of the Hundred, the Four Mothers created the Eight children, the eight races of the Crossroads universe.
Numbers.
In the land of the Hundred, numbers have multiple associations and significance. Also known as the Hundred count, numbers give hidden order to life.
Gods.
According to the beliefs of the folk of the Hundred, there are Four Mothers: Earth, Fire, Air and Water. They gave birth to the Gods of the Hundred who in turn created the first Guardians.
Reeves and Eagles.
The Reeves handle disputes, settle disagreements and generally seek to keep the peace in the Hundred. They are divided between Halls, which also house fawkners who care for the many Eagles. Each Hall is run by a Marshal. Reeves are chosen by their Eagles and usually share similar personality traits (Nallo and Tumna are both irritable and short tempered). Once an Eagle is jessed by its Reeve, they form a bond that can only be broken by death.
It is often said that a Reeve never outlives their Eagle.
Guardians and Winged Steeds.
There are nine Guardians who have been bestowed with a gift from each of the Gods: a cloak which grants protection from death, altars which can speak across vast distances, winged horses to travel swiftly, a light which radiates from their hand, a 'staff' of judgment, an offering bowl, and a third eye and second heart to see into and understand the hearts of all. In Book 2, "Shadow Gate", it is revealed that a cloak found its way to Kiriya. The only way to kill a Guardian is to take their cloak beforehand. This suggests that when a Guardian is killed, their cloak is passed on to another, possibly chosen by the cloak itself.
Although there are other means of killing a Guardian, it takes five to judge one. Therefore, the only way to destroy Night would be for five Guardians to stand against her.
In Book Three, "Traitors' Gate", the names of the winged steeds that belong to Marit, Kirit and Jothinin are revealed: Seeing, Telling and Warning.

Antsiferovo () is a rural locality (a village) in Orekhovo-Zuyevsky District of Moscow Oblast, Russia, located near the Likhotsa River, south-east of Moscow. In the past, it was named Ontsyforovo () and Antsyferovo (). Postal code: 142641.
Municipally, the village is a part of Davydovsky Rural Settlement (the administrative center of which is the village of Davydovo). Population: 518 (1997). Postal code: 142642.
History.
In the 17th century, a female Paraskevi skete operated near Antsiferovo.
The village was first mentioned in the 18th century as a rural estate of Count Ivan Illarionovich Vorontsov. In the first half of the 19th century the village was owned by poruchik Gerasim Stepanovich Myagkov. In 1852, it again changed ownership, this time to Privy Councillor Mikhail Ivanovich Pozen.
The village is located in the historical area of Zakhod (a part of Guslitsa). In the 19th century, it was a part of Zaponorskaya Volost of Bogorodsky Uyezd of Moscow Governorate. The overwhelming majority of the population of Antsiferovo were Old Believers, who from the end of the 19th century were guided by the Russian Orthodox Old-Rite Church.
As in many other Guslitsa's villages, icon painting was a developed craft in Antsiferovo. The craft was started in Guslitsa around 1730 by Antsiferovo peasants F. Yevseyev, who studied iconography in Veliky Novgorod, and A. Afanasyev, who studied in Moscow. In later times, twenty-five icon-painters worked in Antsiferovo.
In 1862, there was already an Old Believers' chapel in the village.
On April 23, 1911, an Old Believers' house of prayer burned down in the village, and the residents petitioned the government to build a new one.
Population.
In 1852, the village consisted of 160 homesteads comprising 1,006 inhabitants (464 male and 542 female). By 1862, the population increased slightly to 175 homesteads comprising 1,070 people (520 male and 550 female). By 1925, the population grew to 211 households comprising 1,137 inhabitants. As of January 1, 1997, the population was 515.

List of rulers of Mecklenburg

This list of dukes and grand dukes of Mecklenburg dates from the origins of the German princely state of Mecklenburg's royal house in the High Middle Ages to the monarchy's abolition at the end of World War I. Strictly speaking, Mecklenburg’s princely dynasty was descended linearly from the princes (or kings) of a Slavic tribe, the Obotrites, and had its original residence in a castle (Mecklenburg) in Dorf Mecklenburg (Mikelenburg) close to Wismar. As part of a feudal union under German law from 1160—at first under the Saxons—Mecklenburg was granted imperial immediacy in 1348 and its princely rulers styled Dukes of Mecklenburg. Despite several partitions, Mecklenburg remained an integral state until the end of the monarchy. The First Partition of Mecklenburg came in 1234, causing the principality to lose land. Thus arose the partial principalities (lordships) of Werle, Parchim-Richenberg, Rostock and Mecklenburg. In modern times it was divided into the two (partial) duchies of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (I) and Mecklenburg-Stargard (1348–1471), Mecklenburg-Schwerin (II) and Mecklenburg-Güstrow (1555–1695), and with the Partition of Hamburg (1701) into Mecklenburg-Schwerin (III) and Mecklenburg-Strelitz. However, the dynasty always retained feudal rights to the entire fief and the rulers of both parts of the country always had identical titles, which led to diplomatic confusion.
The Congress of Vienna in 1815 granted the ruling dukes an adjustment in rank with the title Grand Duke of Mecklenburg and the personal style "Royal Highness". Both parts of the country were henceforth designated Grand Duchies. Besides both rulers, each heir to the throne, their respective wives and all other members of the princely family used the title of Duke (or Duchess) of Mecklenburg, notwithstanding the customary name of Princes and Princesses. The rulers of Mecklenburg were styled Duke of (from 1815 Grand Duke of) Mecklenburg, Prince of the Wends, Schwerin and Ratzeburg, and Count of Schwerin, Lord of the Lands of Rostock and Stargard ("Herzog zu / Großherzog von Mecklenburg, Fürst zu Wenden, Schwerin und Ratzeburg, auch Graf zu Schwerin, der Lande Rostock und Stargard Herr").
At the end of the monarchy in 1918, the House of Mecklenburg was the oldest ruling princely dynasty in Germany. During the Weimar Republic, the former princely title was turned into a commoner’s surname, "Herzog zu Mecklenburg" ("Duke of Mecklenburg").

The period of rule is indicated next to the name of the duke and his relationship to his predecessor. The partitions played a role, particularly from the Middle Ages; administration changed more frequently, and any period of rule or reign is noted separately for the respective ruler.

Zunil is an impact crater near the Cerberus Fossae on Mars, with a diameter of . It is named after a town in Guatemala. The crater is located in the Elysium quadrangle. Visible in images from the Viking 1 and Viking 2 Mars orbiters in the 1970s, Zunil was subsequently imaged at higher resolution for the first time by the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) in 2000. 
A ray system associated with the Zunil impact, visible in infrared images from the Mars Odyssey Thermal Emission Spectrometer (THEMIS) was later detailed by McEwen et al. (2003); prior to this, large craters with ray systems had not been seen on Mars.
The debris from a recent landslide was first spotted on the south-east wall of the crater by the Mars Global Surveyor Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) in 2003, and was subsequently imaged at higher resolution by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) in December 2006.

The impact which formed Zunil occurred no more than a few million years ago and hence the crater is in a relatively pristine form. It was probably not produced in a high velocity impact, such as from a comet. If the interpretation that Zunil is the source of the basaltic shergottite meteorites is correct, then the crater formed in basalt deposited 165–177 million years ago.
The impact created a ray system, visible in the infrared, that extends up to 1600 km from the crater and produced hundreds of millions of secondary craters with diameters ranging from 10 m to 100 m. Very few of these secondary craters lie within 80 km of Zunil. Around 80% of the craters in Athabasca Valles are Zunil secondaries. If similar impacts also produced comparable amounts of secondaries, this calls into question the accuracy of crater counting as a dating technique for geologically young Martian surface features.
A simulation of the Zunil impact ejected on the order of ten billion rock fragments greater than 10 centimeters in diameter, the total ejecta comprising 30 km3. These formed about a billion secondary craters 10 m in size up to 3500 km away from the primary impact. It is possible that some of these fragments from the impact made it to Earth to become shergottites, a form of Martian meteorite.
Research published in the journal Icarus has found pits in Zunil Crater that are caused by hot ejecta falling on ground containing ice. The pits are formed by heat forming steam that rushes out from groups of pits simultaneously, thereby blowing away from the pit ejecta.

Podlaskie Voivodeship

Podlaskie Voivodeship (, ) is a voivodeship in northeastern Poland. It borders on Masovian Voivodeship to the west, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship to the northwest, Lublin Voivodeship to the south, the Belarussian Voblasts of Grodno and Brest to the east, the Lithuanian Counties of Alytus and Marijampolė to the northeast, and the Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia to the north. Its capital is Białystok. It was created on January 1, 1999, out of the former Białystok and Łomża Voivodeships and the eastern half of the former Suwałki Voivodeship, pursuant to the Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998.
Etymology.
The voivodeship takes its name from the historic region of Poland called "Podlasie".
There are two opinions regarding the origin of the region's name. People often derive it from the Slavic "les" or "las", meaning "forest", i.e., it is an area "by the wood(s)" or an "area of forests", which would bring "Podlasie" close in meaning to adjacent "Polesia". This theory has been questioned, as it does not properly take into consideration the vowel shifts "a" > "e" > "i" in various Slavic languages (in fact, it mixes vowels form different languages). Heavily-wooded Podlasie is home to the primal Białowieża Forest and National Park, habitat of the European wisent bison and tarpan.
A second view holds that the term comes from the expression "pod Lachem", i.e., "under the Poles" (see: Lechia). Some claim it to mean "under Polish rule", which does not seem historically sound, as the area belonged to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania until 1569, and the southern part of it—until 1795.
A better variant of the latter theory holds that the name originates from the period when the territory was within the Trakai Voivodeship of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, along the border with Mazovia Province, primarily a fief of the Poland of the Piasts, and later part of the Kingdom of Poland of the Jagiellons. Hence "pod Lachem" would mean "near the Poles", "along the border with Poland". The historical Lithuanian name of the region, "Palenkė", has exactly this meaning.
History.
The voivodeship was created on January 1, 1999, out of the former Białystok and Łomża Voivodeships and the eastern half of the former Suwałki Voivodeship, pursuant to the Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998.
Geography.
Varied landscape, shaped in the north of the Baltic glaciation, the rest of the Middle Poland glaciation. The highest peaks are in the north (Rowelska Top - 298 m), where the landscape is dominated by hilly lake district. Lakeland: Zachodniosuwalskie, Wschodniosuwalskie, Ełckie) and sandrowy lake district (Augustów Plain) in the central and southern plains prevail peryglacjalne (plateaus: Kolneńska, Białystok, Wysokomazowiecka, Drohiczynska, Sokólskie Hills, Międzyrzecko łomżyński, Plain Bielsko), varied in wcinającymi not kotlinami and river valleys, lies on the west edge of the outwash plains Kurpie. Predominate on the surface of sand, gravel, clay, moraine, and in the valleys and basins of the rivers silt, sand and peat river.
Environment.
The vast forests and forests (Białowieża, Augustów, Knyszyń, Kurpiowska), some of which are the only ones in Europe have retained their original character, contain a unique wealth of flora and fauna. The vegetation of the region is extremely rich and diverse, which contributes to the richness of the animal world. Visitors can also see moose, wolves, lynx and bison living in the Białowieża Forest and Knyszyń Forest.
Podlaskie has the lowest population density of the sixteen Polish voivodeships, and its largely unspoiled nature is one of its chief assets. Around 30% of the area of the voivodeship is under legal protection. The Polish part of the Białowieża Forest biosphere reserve (also a World Heritage Site) is in Podlaskie. There are four National Parks (Białowieża, Biebrza, Narew and Wigry), three Landscape Parks (Knyszyń Forest, Łomża and Suwałki), 88 nature reserves, and 15 protected landscape areas. The voivodeship constitutes a part of the ecologically clean area known as "the Green Lungs of Poland".
Climate.
Podlaskie has a or Hemiboreal climate (Dfb) according to the Köppen climate classification system, which is characterized by warm temperatures during summer and long and frosty winters. It is substantially different from most of the other Polish lowlands. The region is one of the coldest in Poland, with the average temperature in January being -. The average temperature in a year is . The number of frost days ranges from 50 to 60, with frost from 110 to 138 days and the duration of snow cover from 90 to 110 days. Mean annual rainfall values oscillate around , and the vegetation period lasts 200 to 210 days.
Podlaskie is the coldest region of Poland, located in the very northeast of the country near the border with Belarus and Lithuania. The region has a continental climate which is characterized by high temperatures during summer and long and frosty winters. The climate is affected by the cold fronts which come from Scandinavia and Siberia. The average temperature in the winter ranges from -15°C (5°F) to -4°C (24.8°F).
Subdivisions and Białystok Metropolitan Region.
Podlaskie Voivodeship is divided into 17 counties (powiats): 3 city counties and 14 land counties. These are further divided into 118 gminas.
Metropolitan Białystok was designated by the Voivodeship of the Regulation No. 52/05 of 16 May 2005 in order to help economically develop the region. In 2006, the metropolitan area population was 450,254 inhabitants. It covers an area of 1.521 km ². For one km2, there are about 265 people. Among urban residents are more women - 192 thousand. on 100 men, 108 women on average. The municipalities adjacent to Białystok are slowly erecting their dispensers and losing their agricultural character, becoming the residential suburban neighborhoods.
Demographics.
Podlaskie is the land of the confluence of cultures – Polish, Belarusian, Ukrainian and Lithuanian – and is indicative of the ethnic territories limits. Eastward of Podlaskie lie historic Polish lands (Belarusian, while westward ethnically non-West 
Ruthenian (Ukrainian and Belarusian) and non-Lithuanian lands too. Today, mainly Polish and Ruthenian (Ukrainian and Belarusian) is spoken in Podlaskie, while Lithuanian is preserved by the small but compact Lithuanian minority concentrated in the Sejny County.
At the end of 2009 in Podlaskie Voivodeship there were 1,189,700 inhabitants, 3.1 per cent of the total population of Poland. The average density of the population, the number of the population per 1 km2, was 59. The urban population in the same period was 60.2 per cent of the total number of inhabitants of the voivodeship, where the percentage of females in the total population amounted to 51.3 per cent. A statistical inhabitant of Podlasie was 37.7 years old, whereas in 2008 – 37.5 years old. The latest population projection predict consistent decrease in the population in Podlaskie Voivodeship. In the next 26 years it will decrease by 117 thousand persons due to the aging of the population.
Culture.
Podlaskie is the most diverse of all Polish voivodships.
The area has been inhabited for centuries by members of different nations and religions: Belarusians, Lithuanians, Ukrainians, Russyns, Gypsies, Tatars, Jews and Filipons.
Many places of religious worship remain:
Economy.
General Economic Indicators.
The following are general economic indicators for Podlaskie:
According to REGON register in the year 2002 there were around 95 thousand companies registered in Podlaskie region (97% of them in private sector), dealing with;
Agriculture.
Arable land constitutes around 60% of the total area of the region – most of which is ploughland (around 40%), forests, meadows and pastures. Over 120 000 farms are registered, roughly half of which are small farms of 1–5 ha and medium-sized farms of 5–10 ha. The smaller farms prefer intensive production (gardening, orcharding), whereas the larger ones engage in cattle and crop production. The cattle-raising farms are mainly oriented towards milk production.
The natural conditions of the region are conducive to the development of organic growing, which at present is practised by around 100 farms. Over 600 farms in the region offer agritourist services.
Government.
The voivodeship's seat is the city of Białystok. Like all voivodeships, it has a government-appointed Provincial Governor (), as well as an elected Regional Assembly (sejmik) and of the executive elected by that assembly, headed by the voivodeship marshal ("marszałek województwa"). Administrative powers and competences are statutorily divided between these authorities.
Cities and towns.
The voivodeship contains 40 cities and towns. These are listed below in descending order of population (according to official figures for 2006 ):

James Hemings

James Hemings (1765 – 1801) was an American mixed-race slave owned and freed by Thomas Jefferson. He was an older brother of Sally Hemings and is said to have been a half-sibling of Jefferson's wife Martha Wayles Skelton Jefferson because their father was John Wayles. As a young man, Hemings was selected by Jefferson to accompany him to Paris when the latter was appointed Minister to France. There Hemings was trained to be a French chef; independently, he took lessons to learn to speak the French language.
He returned to the United States with Jefferson, likely because of kinship ties with his large Hemings family. Jefferson continued to pay Hemings wages as his chef when he worked for the president in Philadelphia. Hemings negotiated with Jefferson for his freedom, which he gained in 1796, after training his brother Peter for three years to replace him as chef. Said to suffer from alcoholism, Hemings committed suicide at age 36.
Biography.
Early life and education.
James Hemings was born into slavery to Betty Hemings, who was the mixed-race daughter of Susannah, an enslaved African mother, and John Hemings, an English sea captain father. James was the second of her six children said to be by her master John Wayles, who took Betty as a concubine after he was widowed for the third time. They had a relationship for 12 years, until his death, and he had a "shadow family" of six children with her. They were three-quarters European by ancestry. Betty had four older children by another man. Wayles died in 1773, leaving Betty and her 10 children to his daughter Martha Jefferson, half-sister to his children by Betty. Martha was then married to Thomas Jefferson, who also inherited them by marriage.
In 1784 Thomas Jefferson took James Hemings with him when he went to Paris as Minister of France, as he wanted the young man, then 19, trained as a chef. While they were in France, Jefferson paid Hemings a wage of four dollars per month. Hemings studied cooking and apprenticed to pastry chefs and other specialists. He paid personally to learn the language from a French tutor. He earned the role of "chef de cuisine" in Jefferson's kitchen on the "Champs-Elysées". He served his creations to the European aristocrats, writers and scientists whom Jefferson invited to dinner.
Career.
In Paris, Jefferson became concerned that Hemings might learn that he could be free when France had abolished slavery in 1789. He wrote about this issue to another American slaveholder in a similar situation. According to the 1873 memoir of Madison Hemings, his uncle James and (future) mother Sally actively considered staying in France for freedom while they were in Paris. (Sally Hemings had accompanied one of Jefferson's daughters to France and worked for the family until they returned to the United States.) While fearful of their seeking freedom, Jefferson, who was in debt for most of his life, was also concerned about having paid for training James.
In 1789, however, both the Hemingses returned to America with Jefferson; he continued to pay James wages to work as his chef. They first returned to Monticello. They lived briefly in a leased house on Maiden Lane in New York City (when the national government was based there), where James Hemings ran the kitchen. In the spring of 1791, when James Hemings and Jefferson were resident in Philadelphia, then the capital, the young slave accompanied Jefferson and James Madison on a month-long vacation in the Northeast. The party traveled through New York and Vermont, stopping at Albany, Lake George, Lake Champlain and Bennington. Jefferson often entrusted Hemings to travel alone ahead of the others to arrange accommodations along the way. After returning south through western Massachusetts and Connecticut, Jefferson and Hemings returned for a long-term stay in Philadelphia.
As Pennsylvania did not allow slavery, Jefferson paid Hemings a wage while he worked there. After two years in Philadelphia, Jefferson made plans to return to Virginia. Reluctant to return to a slave state, Hemings negotiated a contract with Jefferson by which he would gain freedom after training a replacement chef at Monticello to take his place.
In the 1793 agreement, Jefferson wrote:
Having been at great expence in having James Hemings taught the art of cookery, desiring to befriend him, and to require from him as little in return as possible, I hereby do promise & declare, that if the said James should go with me to Monticello in the course of the ensuing winter, when I go to reside there myself, and shall there continue until he shall have taught such person as I shall place under him for that purpose to be a good cook, this previous condition being performed, he shall thereupon be made free... Considering that Hemings had served Jefferson well for years, some historians have described this as a grudging manumission.
For two years, Hemings trained his younger brother Peter, also born into slavery, as chef at Monticello, and finally gained his freedom in 1796. He spoke French and English and was literate; his handwritten inventory of kitchen supplies made before he left Monticello is held by the Library of Congress. He also left recipes and other writings. After traveling to Europe, Hemings eventually returned to the United States, where he found work as a cook in Philadelphia.
In 1801, Jefferson offered Hemings a position at the White House, which the young man refused. Hemings returned briefly to Monticello to work in the kitchen. After a month and a half, Jefferson paid him thirty dollars, and Hemings left. Later, while employed as a cook in a tavern in Baltimore, he committed suicide, at age 36.
Jefferson's friend William Evans in Baltimore made inquiries, and on November 5, 1801, he wrote: The report respecting James Hemings having committed an act of suicide is true. I made every inquiry at the time this melancholy circumstance took place. The result of which was, that he had been delirious for some days prior to committing the act, and it was the general opinion that drinking too freely was the cause.
On November 9, 1801, Jefferson wrote from Washington, DC to James Dinsmore, the Irish joiner managing much of the construction at Monticello, recounting the circumstances of Hemings' death, presumably with instructions to tell his mother Betty and his brother John, who was Dinsmore's assistant. On December 4, 1801, Jefferson wrote to his son-in-law, Thomas Mann Randolph, characterizing Hemings' death as a "tragical end."

Changos de Naranjito

The Naranjito Changos are a professional volleyball team based in Naranjito, Puerto Rico. The team is the most successful franchises in Puerto Rico in all sports. www.loschangosdenaranjito.com
The team colors are: orange, white and black.
Their chairman is Ángel L. Colón.
Club history.
The history of volleyball in Naranjito goes back to 1915.
In 1911, Reverend Howard T. Jason arrived in Naranjito to preach for the Presbyterian Church, finding resistance in this devoutly Catholic town. In 1915, two North American professors known as Mr. Esbaugh and Mr. Foster arrived in town and brought volleyball to Naranjito, attracting the town's youth. Reverend Jason took the opportunity to approach and share with the town's youth as well, helping the professors teach the game's rules, subsequently making friendships.
Reverend Jason remained in Naranjito until 1920, during which time he moved to the neighboring town of Corozal. Having now a good knowledge of the sport, he utilized the same technique of teaching the sport to young kids in order to get acceptance in town. Whenever he had the chance, Rev. Jason would create tournaments between teams both in Naranjito and in Corozal, which fueled a rivalry between both towns that lives to this day.
In 1938, Naranjito finally had a professional volleyball team, joining the North and South association as a professional team in 1940. Naranjito won five championships during this period.
In 1958, Naranjito joined the Puerto Rican Volleyball Federation.
Club Record.
Since 2004, Los Changos have the Guinness World Record in volleyball for the Most Championships in the world with 23 between 1958 and 2007.

Dutch Loaf

"Dutch Loaf" (Also called "Old Fashioned Loaf","Spiced Luncheon Loaf",and "Spiced Lunch Meat") is a luncheon meat made from coarse-ground lean pork and beef mixed or coated with spices, formed into a loaf shape and then smoked over a hardwood fire. It is a popular sandwich filler in America. Most major deli-meat companies make their own variation.
It is known by different names in various parts of the country because different makers of it named it what they wished. 
The name "Dutch Loaf" is probably derived from "Pennsylvania Dutch Meatloaf", a similar dish from rural Pennsylvania introduced by German immigrants. The name "Old Fashioned Loaf" was simply the result of a different meat producer's desire to brand their version with that name instead.

The Witch Tree as it is commonly known, also called Manidoo-giizhikens, or Little Cedar Spirit Tree by the Ojibwa Indian tribe is an ancient "Thuja occidentalis" growing on the shore of Lake Superior in Cook County, Minnesota. The earliest written records of the tree by Europeans in the Americas are by French explorer Sieur de la Verendrye in 1731, who commented on the tree as a mature tree at that time, making it at least 300 years old today. The tree is held sacred by the Ojibwe, who traditionally leave offerings of tobacco to ensure a safe journey on Lake Superior. Due to its sacred nature and vandalism problems in the past, the tree is considered off limits to visitors unless accompanied by a local Ojibwe band member.
The tree is small for a mature conifer, as it is growing out of bare rock on the shoreline. Its gnarled, stunted, and twisting branches have been the subject of many photographs.

Priscilla Welch

Priscilla June Welch (born 22 November 1944 in Bedford, England) is a British retired marathon runner. She had a most unlikely career in international athletics, having been a smoker of a pack a day until she began running competitively at age 35. An officer in the British Army, Welch met her husband Dave while serving in Norway. She quit smoking, and under his tutelage, she ran in the 1980 London Marathon at age 35. 
Four years later, she qualified for the British Olympic team at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. In the first women's Olympic marathon, Welch finished sixth, remarkable for someone who was nearly 40 years old. On her 40th birthday, Welsh qualified for the masters division and began setting age group world records. 
In 1987, she won the New York Marathon with a 2:30:17. This was coupled with her second place finish in London where she set an age group world record running a 2:26:51, good for the sixth fastest time in the world for 1987. She was criticised for passing up the chance to win a medal at the World Championships in Rome that year. Welch set the age group world record in Boston by running a 2:30:48 in 1988. This record stood for 14 years.
Welch continued to run until a 1992 bout with breast cancer curtailed her career. She currently resides in Bend, Oregon, with family living in Northampton, England.

Kollage (band)

Kollage is a Hindi Rock/Pop Band from Kolkata, India, which has performed all over India and has helped popularize different genres of music likes soul, blues, jazz in Hindi music through their original work. They are most popular for their live acts in the corporate and club circuit and have created a niche for themselves as the "Rockers from the IT industry". They have the distinction of being a very rare instance (probably the first) of a Hindi band from the Software Industry (TCS) in India to have cut an original album.
History.
Kollage is a Hindi Rock/Pop/Blues band formed by musicians who are also associates of TATA Consultancy Services (TCS), Kolkata. The band started back in 2003 and was brought together by Biswabijoy Sen and Koushik Chakraborty.Jishnu Dasgupta, Anirban Gomes and Prosenjit Bhattacharyya completed the initial line-up of the band. Back then, Kollage mostly played covers; ones that were closer to the Indipop genre. Their IT background, especially, was a novelty and during 2003, they played quite a few gigs in Kolkata.
The Second Coming.
Back from an overseas assignment in early 2005, Biswabijoy Sen along with a new group of musicians - all of them once again from TCS - regrouped and "Kollage" was back; albeit as Rock/Blues inspired outfit. The new lineup included Shonit Bagchi, Parantap "Taps" Basu, Amritava "Amri" Biswas, Shuddha Satya Dey Mallick and Saikat Chatterjee. The big break came when they participated and won the TCS organized band contest named "RockMetazz" in Mumbai. And one more unexpected reward was waiting. An album which TCS Maitree wanted to produce. "June", their first album, released on 16 October 2006.
The future.
After another work induced hiatus, Kollage were back in the studios recording their second album tentatively titled "Aath".The pre-release live shows started in August 2008.
However, Aath was delayed for a number of reasons. Songs like "Vodka", "Aath", "Sukoon" " Shikhar" and "Baarish" have attained tremendous popularity among the live audience. Biswabijoy Sen has just started working with "The Frozen Orchid" to get theses songs finally on tape.
Collaboration with The Frozen Orchid.
In 2008, Biswabijoy Sen, the lead voalist and composer of Kollage started a collaboration with "The Frozen Orchid" - an alternative band from melbourne Australia. What started as an exchange of musical ideas blossomed into "Maya" - a full fledged album in Hindi. Maya was recorded in Melbourne and mixed by Dan Groth of "The Frozen Orchid". It was mastered at "Jack the Bear", Melbourne. Maya has not been released yet but most of the songs are available on YouTube.

Old Sugar Mill of Koloa

The Old Sugar Mill of Kōloa was part of the first commercially successful sugar plantation in Hawaii, which was founded in Kōloa in 1835 by Ladd & Company. This was the beginning of what would become Hawaii's largest industry. The building was designated a National Historic Landmark on December 29, 1962. A stone chimney and foundations remain from 1840.
History.
Although sugarcane had been raised by ancient Hawaiians on small personal plots, this was the first large-scale commercial production in Hawaii.
Joseph Goodrich of the Hilo mission and Samuel Ruggles of the Kona Mission had experimented with using agriculture to support their missions as well as give employment to their students.
After trying unsuccessfully to get Rev. Goodrich, Hooper moved to the land as manager, despite having no training in engineering nor agriculture.
The plantation was established here due to the overall fertility of the soil, proximity to a good port, and location near the Maulili pool which allowed them the use of a waterfall for processing power. This first lease was not easily acquired and connections to missionaries played a large part in its acquisition. Previously molasses would end up being distilled into rum, which the conservative missionaries were constantly battling.
The founders of Ladd & Co. were William Ladd (1807–1863), Peter A. Brinsmade (1804–1859), and William Northey Hooper (1809–1878).
Hawaiians resisted the lease of the land and initially forbade the sale of provisions to plantation managers. The two groups eventually struck an uneasy partnership that resulted in multiple conflicts as time progressed.
Although were leased from King Kamehameha III, only were planted in September 1835. A small mill powered by water from Maulili pool produced a small amount of molasses in 1836. The wooden rollers in the mill quickly wore out, so were replaced with iron ones for increased production. By 1837, the mill produced over of sugar and of molasses.
A subsequent mill, whose chimney and foundation are still visible, was built from 1839 to 1841 on Waihohonu Stream. It cost close to US$16,000 to build.
Labor disputes.
Managers of the sugar plantation expressed significant frustration with the Hawaiian laborers suggesting they have shown "complete worthlessness ... as laborers". The Hawaiian people are described as being so strongly rooted in their cultural heritage that "centuries, at least, will intervene ere they will understand that it is a part of their duty to serve their masters faithfully". The plantation manager goes on to state that the work of 10 white men was equivalent to that of 400 Hawaiians. 
Plantation owners paid workers $2 per month using "Kauai Currency" which could only be redeemed at plantation stores for goods (marked up no more than 2% over market). They were provided furnished houses but had to pay 1 cent per day for them. In an 1841 revolt against these conditions, Hawaiian workers commenced an unsuccessful strike for higher wages. A review of Kōloa history and working conditions reveals the motivations of plantation owners to import labor resulting in a massive wave of globalization for the islands.
Kōloa plantation used a contract system that gave laborers an interest in the crop, but prevented them from finding other employment without penalties. These methods were later adopted by other planters in the Territory of Hawaii that became to be known as the "Big Five".
Demise.
Ladd & Co. shut down in 1844 after a failed attempt to colonize the rest of the Hawaiian Islands. 
The Kōloa plantation was repossessed by the Hawaiian government and sold to Dr. Robert Wood, Hooper's brother-in-law, who ran it until 1874. In 1853 a steam engine was used to power a mill for the first time in Hawaii. Samuel Burbank developed a deep plow to increase production.
Koloa Agricultural Company was purchased by the Duncan McBryde family in 1899, who added it to their estate and the Eleele Plantation. Their agent was Theo H. Davies & Co. In 1910 Alexander & Baldwin became the agent, and would eventually buy out the other partners. The old mill was replaced by a much larger one to the east in 1912, which was acquired from the planned American Sugar Company plantation on Molokai. Frank A. Alexander managed the company from 1912 to 1937. Cedric B. Baldwin managed the company from 1938 until World War II, when he was killed on Iwo Jima. McBryde merged with the Grove Farm Company in 1948.
The plantation was shut down in 1996. In 2000 Grove Farm was sold to Steve Case, whose grandfather A. Hebard Case had worked on the plantation. He paid US$25 million and assumed $60 million of debt, but was sued by other shareholders since his father had served as lawyer for the company. The lawsuit went to court but was dismissed in 2008.

Bavarian D V

The 10 examples of the Class D V (pronounced "D 5") steam engine belonging the Royal Bavarian State Railways ("Königlich Bayerische Staatsbahn") were the first six-coupled tank locomotives in Bavaria. They were intended specifically for working the hilly route between Plattling and Eisenstein. Because they did not deliver the expected performance, however, they were soon relegated to shunting duties. 
That said, all 10 engines went into the Reichsbahn where they were incorporated into the numbering plan as the Class 89.81. However they were soon replaced by Class 89.6, the ex-Bavarian R 3/3 engines. The last two, numbers 89 8106 and 89 8107 were retired in 1928.

Biogenesis (The X-Files)

"Biogenesis" is the twenty-second episode and the sixth season finale of the science fiction television series "The X-Files". The episode first aired in the United States and Canada on May 16, 1999 on the Fox Network, and aired in the United Kingdom and Ireland on July 25, 1999 on Sky1. It was written by executive producers Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz, and directed by Rob Bowman. "Biogenesis" earned a Nielsen household rating of 9.4, being watched by 15.86 million people in its initial broadcast. The episode received mixed reviews from critics.
The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. In the episode, Mulder and Scully investigate a bizarre rock inscribed with Navajo writing found in Côte d'Ivoire, and the death of the African scientist involved. While its appearance in Washington begins to affect Mulder’s mental health, leading him to turn to Agent Fowley for help; a disturbed Scully—determined to disprove the theory that life on Earth began with aliens—heads to New Mexico and finds a dying Albert Hosteen—who has discovered that the rock includes passages from the Bible, and a map of the human genome. While Mulder breaks down in a mental institution, Scully journeys unexpectedly to Africa.
"Biogenesis" was a story milestone for the series, along with "The Sixth Extinction" and "," and introduced new aspects to the series' overarching mythology. The episode was written due to series creator Chris Carter's fascination with the possibility that extraterrestrials were involved in the great extinctions that had happened millions of years ago.
Plot.
On a beach in Côte d'Ivoire, a metallic artifact with inscriptions is discovered by Solomon Merkmallen, a biology professor. When he takes it to his office and places it together with a similar artifact, the two suddenly fuse and fly across the room, becoming embedded in a Bible. Merkmallen then travels to the United States to meet with Steven Sandoz, an American University biologist who has a third artifact. However, he is murdered by a man posing as Sandoz; when the real Sandoz finds the body, he flees.
Walter Skinner assigns Fox Mulder and Dana Scully to investigate Sandoz's disappearance, giving them a rubbing of Merkmallen's artifact. Mulder tells Skinner that both Merkmallen and Sandoz espoused panspermia, a theory suggesting an extraterrestrial origin to life on Earth. Mulder begins suffering from a headache and is unable to hear Scully speak, a condition seemingly caused by the rubbing. At the university, the agents meet Dr. Barnes—the man who posed as Sandoz—who professes disbelief in his theories. Mulder's condition worsens, but he refuses to go to the hospital and, due to seeming telepathic abilities, realizes that Barnes murdered Merkmallen. Later, in Mulder's office, Chuck Burks tells them that the symbols on the artifact are from Navajo.
In Sandoz's apartment, Mulder and Scully find a picture of him with Albert Hosteen; they also find Merkmallen's dismembered body in a trash bag. The agents report to Skinner, with Mulder believing that Sandoz is being framed and that the artifact emits galactic radiation. He also seems to know that someone else is involved on the case, but Skinner remains silent. However, after the agents leave, Skinner hands a video tape of their conversation to Alex Krycek, who later provides it to Barnes. Scully travels to New Mexico and discovers that Hosteen is dying of cancer; Scully runs into Sandoz and corners him. Sandoz claims that Albert was helping him translate the artifacts, which had included passages from the Bible. Meanwhile, Mulder goes to the university to tail Barnes, but is overcome by his headache and passes out in the stairwell.
Scully contacts Mulder, who is now resting at home. He believes that the artifact proves that humanity was created by aliens. Diana Fowley, who is with Mulder, contacts the Cigarette Smoking Man. A healing ceremony is held for Albert, but Scully is forced to leave when Skinner contacts her, telling her Mulder is in the hospital. Mulder is being held in a padded cell and is displaying abnormal brain activity. Scully, after learning that Skinner knows about their earlier conversation with Burks, calls him and Fowley liars and leaves. Scully is about to find a surveillance camera in the X-Files office when she is called by Sandoz telling her that the artifact contains information on human genetics. Sandoz is killed by Krycek shortly afterwards. Scully then heads to the West African Coast where she discovers that the artifact is part of a large spacecraft partially buried in the beach.
Production.
The episode started a new mythology for the series questioning the origin of human life. Series creator Chris Carter claimed to be interested in the subject for a while, citing the possibility of extraterrestrial involvement in great extinctions that had happened millions of years ago. Carter claimed that early in the show he had met with a man who was one of the people responsible for leading the project of mapping the human genome and that he was interested enough in the subject to tie it into the show's alien mythology. The scientific basis for extraterrestrials pursued the writers to help Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully's (Gillian Anderson) beliefs come together, which was furthered in the later seasons of the show. Frank Spotnitz claimed that the ideas used in this episode had been discussed between him and Carter for a few years, and had become easier to bring up after clearing away elements of the conspiracy in the episodes "Two Fathers" and "One Son". Carter developed the script in Vancouver, Canada while working on the pilot for his series "Harsh Realm", providing pages to the production crew via the fax machine.
Professor Solomon Merkmallen was portrayed by Michael Chinyamurindi, who had moved to the U.S. ten years earlier and had previously tried out for the episode "Teliko" in season four. A number of Los Angeles, California based African immigrants were used for the fishermen on the African coast. Duchovny expressed anxiety during filming due to the imminent birth of his first child, who was born two days after filming concluded.
The University scenes were shot at UCLA. The African coastline was filmed at Leo Carillo State Beach. Conditions meant that the crew only had approximately 45 minutes per day for filming there. The spacecraft was created digitally and the effect ended up costing approximately $150,000. The extraterrestrial writing on the artifacts was based on the Kecksburg Incident, where an extraterrestrial object appeared in a small town in December 1965. Hosteen Etsity, who previously assisted with the episode "The Blessing Way" oversaw the Navajo symbols and religious ceremonies in the episode.
A large portion of the episode was based on the ancient astronaut theory, which proposes that intelligent extraterrestrial beings have visited Earth in antiquity or prehistory and made contact with humans. Frank Spotnitz later remarked that he was astounded at how little negative fan mail the show received, despite the fact that the "Biogenesis"/"The Sixth Extinction"/"" story arc heavily hinted that aliens were the originators of the notion of God and religion. He credited the manner in which the show handled this delicate subject, saying, "Often in the past, we've done stuff where I was sure we would get angry letters. But we rarely do. And the reason is because of the way we handle things. In 'Amor Fati' we treated the religious side with respect." The ancient astronaut themes were later revisited in the two season nine episodes "Provenance" and "Providence."
Reception.
"Biogenesis" first aired in the United States on May 16, 1999. This episode earned a Nielsen rating of 9.4, with a 14 share, meaning that roughly 9.4 percent of all television-equipped households, and 14 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. It was viewed by 15.86 million viewers. The episode aired in the United Kingdom on Sky1 on July 25, 1999 and received 0.55 million viewers and was the eighth most watched episode that week. Fox promoted the episode with the tagline "You've heard every theory about how man evolved... except for one." The episode was later included on "The X-Files Mythology, Volume 3 – Colonization", a DVD collection that contains episodes involved with the alien Colonist's plans to take over the earth.
Tom Kessenich, in his book "Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files" gave the episode a positive review, writing "'Biogenesis' gave us a Mulder gone mad, duplicitous allies and enemies, a rising body count, and Scully on the brink of an amazing discovery. It was pure "X-Files" and a terrific conclusion to a standout sixth season." Den of Geek writer Nina Sordi ranked "Biogensis," along with "The Sixth Extinction" and "," as the fifth best episode of the series, writing, "it is evident that as ["The X-Files"] progressed, the episodes surrounding those storylines and the breaking points Mulder and Scully endured push them further and further towards total, irreversible defeat. This is especially poignant when viewing this anxiety inducing trio of episodes." Monica S. Kuebler from "Exclaim" magazine called "Biogenesis", along with "The Sixth Extinction" and "Amor Fati", one of the "best" episodes during the show's "colonization" phase. "Michigan Daily" reviewer Melissa Runstrom said "Biogenesis," along with "One Son" and "Two Fathers," were the highlights of the sixth season.
Zack Handlen awarded the episode a "B" and called it "crazy enough at the end that, if nothing else, I really want to know what happens next". He enjoyed the basic premise, involving the idea that aliens were active in the development of humanity—comparing it to Stanley Kubrick’s film "" and Ridley Scott’s movie "Prometheus". However, Handlen, since he was reviewing the series retrospectively, was slightly disappointed that the plot was dropped in subsequent season. In the end, he noted that the entry was "ambitious, but it doesn’t exactly make sense, which is pretty much where ["The X-Files" mythology] is at now."
Other reviews were more critical. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book "Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen", rated the episode two stars out of five. The two heavily criticized the episode for recycling story lines, writing, "With the Syndicate destroyed, this episode was widely touted as the beginning of a fresh new mythology for the show. So why does watching it give such a strong sense of déjà vu?" Paula Vitaris from "Cinefantastique" gave the episode a largely negative review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris summarized the episode as "if someone took the script to 'Anasazi'—one of the best "X-Files" episodes ever—changed the plot a bit, and then stripped it of virtually all human interest."

Getabako

A is a Japanese shoe cupboard, usually situated in the genkan, an entryway or porch of the house. In Japan, it is considered uncouth to not remove one's shoes before entering the house. Near the getabako is a slipper rack, and most people in Japan wear slippers around the house, except for rooms which have tatami flooring as they are bad for the floor. The getabako is usually made of wood and bamboo, and there are many sold all over the world.
The word getabako is originated from 下駄 (geta - a type of Japanese footwear) + 箱 (hako - box).
Usually there are big getabako in schools and kindergartens, and each student has his own section. Sometimes students stores personal things there, or use them to leave love letters.

BMW M1 Procar Championship

The BMW M1 Procar Championship, sometimes known simply as Procar, was a one-make auto racing series created by Jochen Neerpasch, head of BMW Motorsport GmbH, the racing division of automobile manufacturer BMW. The series pitted professional drivers from the Formula One World Championship, World Sportscar Championship, European Touring Car Championship, and other international series against one another using identically modified BMW M1 sports cars.
Billed as an opportunity to see a mix of drivers from various motorsport disciplines, the championship served as support races for various European rounds of the 1979 Formula One season, with Formula One drivers earning automatic entry into the Procar event based on their performance in their Formula One cars. Austrian Niki Lauda won the inaugural championship. In 1980, the series held some events outside of Formula One schedule, and was won by Brazilian Nelson Piquet. BMW chose not to continue the championship in 1981 to concentrate on their entrance into Formula One.
Origin.
Jochen Neerpasch, the head of BMW's Motorsports division, was the first to propose the idea of a one-make championship. The division had started construction of the first sports car for BMW in 1978, the M1, and had planned from the start to enter the new sports car in the World Sportscar Championship in 1979, as well as offering the cars to customers for other series. BMW Motorsport planned to build M1s to meet regulations known as Group 5, but a rule change instituted by the Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA) in 1977 altered the requirements for Group 5. The new regulations required a minimum of 400 examples of the M1 to be built to meet Group 4 regulations before the car could be further homologated for the Group 5 category.
Development of the Group 4 racing car was already under way at the time of the regulation change. Neerpasch believed that rather than delaying their racing program until 400 road cars had been built, racing cars could be built at the same time since they too counted toward the 400 example minimum. A one-make series consisting of the M1 racing cars intended for Group 4 was devised by Neerpasch since the racing cars could not yet legally compete elsewhere, while at the same time allowing BMW to develop the race cars through experience.
To attract drivers to the series, Neerpasch entered into discussions with Max Mosley. Mosley was the head of March Engineering, a constructor which BMW was partnered with in their factory efforts in the European Formula Two Championship. Mosley was at the time a member of the Formula One Constructors Association, and was able to use his position to convince other Formula One constructors to support the use of Neerpasch's one-make series as a support race for European Formula One events. A ruling and organisation body for the series, known as The Procar Association, was set up by BMW and approved by FISA.
Format.
With the Procar Championship announced in spring 1978 at the official unveiling of the M1 road car, Neerpasch and the newly formed Procar Association laid out regulations for the 1979 season. Races were planned for the middle of the Formula One season, when the championship remained in Europe for several months. Practice and qualifying were held on Friday of the race weekend, while the race itself occurred on Saturday. The winner of each race received US $5,000, second place received $3,000, and third place $1,000. Races varied in length, but each lasted for approximately half an hour.
To attract Formula One drivers to the championship, seats were guaranteed in the Procar races by cars which were entered by the factory BMW team. The five fastest Formula One drivers from Friday practice were assigned to the factory team, and were even guaranteed the first five grid positions for the Procar race, regardless of their qualifying times in the cars. This not only guaranteed Formula One driver participation, but also allowed for a variety of drivers to be seen over the course of the season. However, because the series ran Goodyear tyres, several Formula One drivers were not allowed to compete due to contractual obligations with competing tyre manufacturer Michelin. As Scuderia Ferrari and Renault were selling roadcars themselves, they did not allow their Formula One drivers to participate and implicitly endorse BMW.
Other teams were allowed to participate, assigning a variety of sportscar and touring car drivers as well as Formula One drivers who had not earned spots in the factory cars. Points were awarded to the top ten finishers, starting with 20 points and decreasing down to 15, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 3, 2, and finally 1 for the nine remaining drivers. An overall championship was awarded to the driver who had accumulated the most points at the end of the season. A new M1 road car was awarded to the championship winner.
Cars.
All cars used in the Procar Championship were built to identical standards, although their origins varied. BS Fabrications constructed five cars for the BMW factory team, while cars for other competitors were constructed by the British Formula Two team Project Four (led by Ron Dennis) and the Italian constructor Osella. The racing cars, designed to meet Group 4 technical regulations, shared only some basics from the M1 road cars.
For the M1's exterior, simple modifications were made to adapt the car aerodynamically. A deep spoiler was added under the nose of the car, while an adjustable wing was added on two mounts at the rear of the engine cover. The arches for the wheels were extended outward to shroud the wider wheels in the front, and wheels at the rear. The alloy wheels, designed by Campagnolo, featured a central locking nut and mimicked the straked design of the production car's wheels. Inside, the car featured no finishing or luxuries from the road car, only a rollcage for driver protection. The glass windows were replaced with clear plastic.
Mechanically, the Procar M1s were extensively modified to meet the requirements of circuit racing. The standard M1 featured the cast iron block BMW M88 straight-6 with displacement. Modified into the M88/1 by a team led by Paul Rosche, it was capable of producing 470 horsepower at 9000 rpm, compared to 277 hp from the standard M1's engine. The 5-speed ZF gearbox housing from the road car was retained, but with multiple gear ratios allowed, as well as its own oil cooler.
The suspension was entirely new, adding adjustable anti-roll bars. The brakes were redesigned to adapt the use of a driver-adjustable brake pressure balance, while the servo-activated braking system was removed. A racing steering rack was used in place of the standard power steering unit. Pneumatic jacks were later added to the cars in the 1980 season to allow for quicker pit stops. Goodyear racing tires were used on all cars. All other non-essential items from the road car were not included, bringing the Procar M1's weight down to . The performance of the Procar M1s was increased to a top speed of dependent upon gear ratios, and acceleration from 0– in 4.3 seconds. Each Procar M1 cost approximately US $60,000.
Series history.
1979 season.
An announced schedule for the inaugural season of the Procar Championship featured events taking place from May to September, when the Formula One World Championship ran eight consecutive Grands Prix in Europe. A ninth event was scheduled at Donington Park as part of the Gunnar Nilsson Memorial Trophy, a charity event for the Gunnar Nilsson Cancer Fund, although it did not award points towards the overall championship.
Different Formula One drivers earned spots on the factory team over the season based on their performance in Formula One practice. These included Mario Andretti, Patrick Depailler, Emerson Fittipaldi, James Hunt, Jean-Pierre Jarier, Alan Jones, Jacques Laffite, Niki Lauda, Nelson Piquet, Didier Pironi, Clay Regazzoni, and John Watson. Teo Fabi, Tiff Needell, Hans-Georg Bürger and Michael Bleekemolen were invited to drive in the factory BMW cars as well although they were not Formula One drivers at the time.
As well as the standard five car entry from BMW, several other notable teams participated. Procar constructor Project Four entered a car for Niki Lauda when he was not in the factory entries, while Osella entered cars for a rotating driver line-up. Touring car teams Tom Walkinshaw Racing, Eggenberger Racing, Ecurie Arvor, and Schnitzer Motorsport entered cars, as did Team Konrad and GS Tuning from sports cars.
Championship standings.
The following are the ten highest finishing drivers in the points standings. Niki Lauda won the inaugural championship, initially earning a spot in the factory BMW team in the first round, before running the remaining seven races for Project Four.
1980 season.
For the second running of the Procar Championship, the schedule was altered and expanded so that the races did not rely exclusively on Formula One events. This allowed the season to start slightly earlier, this time in April. Donington Park was retained from the previous year but now counted towards the championship. Two German events were added, with the Procar Championship designated as that year's Avusrennen at the AVUS circuit, and the Procars serving as a support race for the Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft's 200 Miles of Norisring. Six Formula One Grands Prix remained on the schedule.
Unlike the previous year where the fastest drivers in practice earned seats with the factory BMW team, five drivers were designated as the primary drivers for events which did not share a Grand Prix weekend. These five were Alan Jones, Jacques Laffite, Nelson Piquet, Didier Pironi, and Carlos Reutemann. Other Formula One drivers to participate during Grands Prix were Mario Andretti, Derek Daly, Jean-Pierre Jarier, Riccardo Patrese, and Alain Prost.
Several teams from the previous year entered once more, including Project Four, GS Tuning, Eggenberger Racing, Cassani Racing, and Schnitzer Motorsport. Newcomers included personal teams from Arturo Merzario, Dieter Quester, and Helmut Marko, as well as Swiss sportscar manufacturer Sauber.
Championship standings.
The following are the ten highest finishing drivers in the points standings. Nelson Piquet won the championship, aided by three consecutive wins to finish the year.
Afterwards.
At the start of the 1980 season, BMW announced their intention to enter Formula One as an engine supplier for Brabham. The deal came in part due to Bernie Ecclestone, then head of Brabham, as well as the head of BS Fabrications, who had built several of the Procar M1s. BMW planned to enter the series in 1982, and BMW Motorsport was tasked with concentrating their efforts on the new Formula One engines instead of the Procar series.
That same year, BMW officially met FISA's requirements by having built approximately 400 cars. The M1 was therefore homologated for Group 4 on December 1, 1980, allowing BMW to enter the Championship for Makes in 1981. As BMW shifted towards Formula One, the company ended their plans to enter the Group 5 category after the construction of only two race cars. With BMW no longer needing to quickly build race cars, and with BMW Motorsport shifting to Formula One work, the series was not held in 1981. The M1s used in the Procar series were sold to various customers for use in the World Championship, as well as smaller series such as the Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft and Camel GT Championship.
In 1988, Motor Racing Developments, the owners of the Brabham Formula One Team, were sold to Alfa Romeo. Wishing to revive the Procar series, Brabham and Alfa Romeo developed a prototype racing car using a mid-mounted Formula One-based V10 engine, covered in a bodywork silhouette mimicking the Alfa Romeo 164. Alfa Romeo intended to use identical copies of the car for a resurrected Procar series, but the plans never came to fruition and only the prototype was built.
Revival.
On June 30, 2008, BMW announced plans to revive the Procar series in an exhibition event at the 2008 German Grand Prix at the Hockenheimring. The races involved ten original M1 Procars driven by several drivers who had participated in the original series as well as modern drivers. Each car included a passenger seat for a guest. The line-up included former competitors Christian Danner, Harald Grohs, Niki Lauda, Dieter Quester, and Marc Surer. Former BMW driver Prince Leopold of Bavaria, BMW Sauber test driver Christian Klien, and a current M1 Procar owner, Marco Wagner, also competed. The BMW M1 Art Car designed by Andy Warhol was involved, driven by series founder Jochen Neerpasch and with fellow Art Car artist Frank Stella as his passenger.
Lauda won the first race held on Saturday, July 19, while Neerpasch was able to win the race held on Sunday, July 20, the morning of the Grand Prix.

ERIM (army Sumerogram)

ERIM is the capital letter-(majuscule) sumerogram for the Akkadian language word "army", or "troops". The akkadian language word for army is ("ṣābu"-using s-dot, the special s); consequently the cuneiform character for ERIM is also equivalent to "sab", "zab", etc.-(also using s-dot).
The cuneiform-compound for the enclosed use of the 'army' cuneiform character is the akkadian language word for "battle", or "warfare", akkadian "tāhāzu"-(also a sumerogram: MÈ-no. 098, Parpola). In the Yašdata letter with the place-name for Hannathon, the determinative is used at the beginning of the word battle, then tāhāzu is spelled ta-ha-(zu).
Epic of Gilgamesh.
The cuneiform character for "army"-"sab" is used 19 times in the Epic of Gilgamesh tablets-(chapters). It is used only once as "zab"; also only once as ERIM, for "armies" in Chapter XI, as ERIM-mesh(the plural), for "men, troops".
Amarna letter usage.
In the 1350 BC Amarna letters, the army sumerogram ERIM is used in the formulaic introduction to the pharaoh of ancient Egypt-(mostly Amenhotep IV-"Akhenaten", or his father Amenhotep III). The addressing is towards the 'good health'-Shalom-(Akkadian language "šālāmu"-"to be safe") of the list of pharaoh's charges, and near the end of the list his "troops", or armies are addressed: as ERIM-mesh; (mesh is the plural as "s", in the Akkadian language). The more notable kings used this formal introduction to the pharaoh, for example Tushratta of Mitanni, the "King of Alashiya"-(now known as the island Cyprus); also the king of Babylon, Burna-Buriash; also Kadashman-Enlil I of Babylon.
A more distinctive use of the army cuneiform character in the Amarna letters, is in the cuneiform-compound for the word 'battle', as a determinative in Amarna letter no. 245, concerning a story about Yašdata, with the subject being the Habiru man, Labaya.

Ah, But Your Land Is Beautiful

Ah, but Your Land is Beautiful is the third novel of Alan Paton, the South African author who is best known for writing "Cry, the Beloved Country". "Ah, but Your Land is Beautiful" is an anti-apartheid novel, in a similar vein to "Cry, the Beloved Country". It is a fictional reworking of Paton's own years working as a political activist and of the experience he gained working as the president of the South African Liberal Party.
In the foreword, Paton describes how the book contains both real and fictitious characters, but that two of the real characters were still alive at the time of his writing. They were Helen Joseph and Archbishop Trevor Huddleston, both of whom gave permission for Paton to introduce them, without sight of the text. Other real characters, who were dead at the of publication, were Albert Lutuli, Dr. Monty Naicker, Patrick Duncan, Advocate Donald Barkly Molteno and Archbishop Geoffrey Clayton. He also describes the novel as set in the years 1952 to 1958.
Plot summary.
The novel has multiple storylines that alternate one another, all reminiscent of the true-life experiences faced by Alan Paton and his political colleagues in resisting National Party rule in South Africa during the 1950s.
The book is divided into six parts:
Part One: The Defiance Campaign
Part Two: The Cleft Stick
Part Three: Come Back, Africa
Part Four: Death of a Traitor
Part Five: The Holy Church of Zion
Part Six: Into the Golden Age
It was originally conceived as the first part of a trilogy.

Mars hoax

The Mars hoax was a hoax circulated by e-mail that began in 2003, that claimed that Mars would look as large as the full Moon to the naked eye on August 27, 2003. The hoax, which has since resurfaced every year from 2005 through 2013, began from a misinterpretation and exaggeration of a sentence in an e-mail message that reported the close encounter between Mars and the Earth in August 2003. At that time, the distance between the two planets was about 55,758,000 kilometers, which was the closest distance between them since September 24, 57,617 BC, when the distance has been calculated to have been about 55,718,000 kilometers.
Background.
Both Earth and Mars are in elliptical orbits around the Sun in approximately the same plane. By the nature of the laws of physics, the distance between them varies periodically from a minimum equal to the distance between their orbits at some point along them, to a maximum when they are on opposite sides of the Sun. These minimum (opposition) and maximum distances vary considerably as the two planets progress along their elliptical orbits, and occur about every 780 days. Mars was closer to the Earth in August 2003 (at the opposition than it had been since 57,617 BC, and than it will be until 2287 or possibly much later.
There was another opposition on 30 October 2005, but with a minimum distance about 25% greater than in 2003 (as reported in the original email, text below) and apparent diameter correspondingly smaller. The magnitude was −2.3, about 60% as bright as 2003. (The Moon has an apparent diameter of around 30 minutes of arc, i.e., 1800 arcseconds, with magnitude of about −12.7 when full, about 9,000 times brighter than Mars in the 2003 approach.)
Origin.
The Mars hoax originated from an e-mail message in 2003, sometimes titled "Mars Spectacular", with images of Mars and the full moon side by side:
Although the e-mail itself is correct, the hoax stemmed from a misinterpretation of the sentence "At a modest 75-power magnification Mars will look as large as the full moon to the naked eye". The message was often quoted with a line break in the middle of this sentence, leading some readers to mistakenly believe that "Mars will look as large as the full moon to the naked eye" when, in reality, this sentence means that Mars "enlarged 75 times" will look as big as the moon unenlarged.
It is quite obviously scientifically incorrect that Mars, normally never more than a dot in the night sky, could suddenly become visibly large due to normal variations in orbit. If Mars did appear as large as the moon it would be so close that it would cause catastrophic gravitational effects — Mars has about twice the diameter of the Moon, and hence would be about twice as far away for the same apparent size. It has nine times the mass of the Moon, and would have over twice the gravitational effect (nine times the larger mass divided by relative distance squared).
Resurfacing.
The hoax has resurfaced a number of times since 2003, and may continue to do so, always announcing an imminent close Earth–Mars approach. The content of the original email, although almost entirely correct for August 27, 2003, has falsely been redated to announce a new close Earth–Mars approach — the real close approach was in 2003 only — also misinterpreting the original e-mail by saying that Mars will look as large as the Moon. The later e-mails are incorrect, as Mars will not come as close to Earth as it did in 2003 until August 28, 2287, or later.

7.62mm UKM

The 7.62mm UKM (7.62 x 57 mm) is a specialized rimless bottlenecked centerfire cartridge developed for long-range rifles. The commercially successful .338 Lapua Magnum cartridge has functioned as the parent case for the 7.62mm UKM, which is essentially a necked-down shortened version of the .338 Lapua Magnum. The .338 cartridge case was used for this since it has the capability to operate with high chamber pressures which, combined with smaller and hence lighter bullets result in high muzzle velocities.
History.
The 7.62mm UKM was developed by Michael Uekötter and C.I.P. (Commission Internationale Permanente pour l'Epreuve des Armes à Feu Portatives) certified in 2002, so it is an officially registered and sanctioned member of the Finnish "family" of super magnum rifle cartridges. The 7.62mm UKM is not commercially available today and currently (2008) exists only as a C.I.P. datasheet. It is however still used by a few shooters who produce the cases from .338 Lapua Magnum brass by reshaping the shoulder and neck, and handloading it with .30 calibre bullets.
Cartridge dimensions.
The 7.62mm UKM has a 5.84 ml (90 grains) H2O cartridge case capacity. The exterior shape of the Lapua Magnum case was designed to promote reliable case feeding and extraction in bolt action rifles and machineguns alike, under extreme conditions.
7.62mm UKM maximum C.I.P. cartridge dimensions. All sizes in millimeters (mm).
Americans would define the shoulder angle at alpha/2 ≈ 20 degrees. The common rifling twist rate for this cartridge is 254 mm (1 in 10 in), 6 grooves, Ø lands = 7.62 mm, Ø grooves = 7.82 mm, land width = 2.79 mm and the primer type is large rifle magnum.
According to the official C.I.P. guidelines the 7.62mm UKM case can handle up to 470 MPa (68,167 psi) piezo pressure. In C.I.P. regulated countries every rifle cartridge combo has to be proofed at 125% of this maximum C.I.P. pressure to certify for sale to consumers.
This for rifles very high maximum allowed chamber pressure level indicates that the cases of the .300 and .338 Lapua Magnum and 7.62mm UKM are built extremely sturdy to cope with this for rifles very high operating pressure. The large boltface combined with the high 470 MPa maximum pressure makes that the 7.62mm UKM should only be chambered in rifles that are capable of handling such large and fierce cartridges and thus high bolt thrust safely. Chambering such powerful super magnum cartridges in rifles intended for normal magnum rifle cartridges and using 470 MPa loads can cause serious or fatal injury to the shooter and bystanders.
Additional information.
The 7.62mm UKM’s main appeal is long-range shooting. Due to the large case capacity in relation to the 7.62 mm (.308 inch) calibre bore size the 7.62mm UKM is harsh on barrels. The 7.62mm UKM typically wears out a rifle barrel in 750 to 1500 rounds. A lot of thorough barrel cleaning (after every 5 to 10 shots) and carefully avoiding long strings of shots help to minimize barrel wear.
The American .300 Dakota proprietary cartridge, based on the .404 Jeffery case, is probably the closest currently (2008) commercially available ballistic twin of the 7.62mm UKM. The .300 Dakota is however a rebated rim cartridge.

Blackfoot Mountains

The Blackfoot Mountains, also called the Blackfoot Range, is a small range of mountains located east of Blackfoot, Idaho. Most of the area is private property, including the range's tallest mountain, Taylor Mountain. This mountain was named after Sam Taylor, an early settler and brother of Matt Taylor. The Blackfoot River carves through the region. Within this range is Wolverine Canyon, a public area that features sites for hiking, camping, kayaking, rock climbing and other recreational pursuits.
Ecology.
This area is mainly a hilly shrub-steppe, covered in sagebrush and juniper. However, there are many springs and small streams which form microclimates with more water-loving plants. The mountains themselves are mainly basalt.

Blocco Automatico a Correnti Codificate

BACC is a train protection system used in Italy on railway lines using 3kV DC electrification. The term is an abbreviation of Blocco automatico a correnti codificate ("automatic block system with codified currents").
It is an extension of RS4 Codici. While RS4 Codici is a simple cab signalling system that only requires the driver to acknowledge any change in the aspect of the next signal, SSB (On board sub system) RS9 equipment also continuously monitors the train speed and computes braking curves according to the train's length, mass, and braking ability.
The information is conveyed by superposition of two amplitude-modulated alternating currents in the rails (with a carrier frequency of 50 Hz and 178 Hz, respectively). Receiver coils in front of the first axle of a locomotive or control car are used to detect the signal.
The frequency of the modulating signal encodes the signal aspect:
RS4 Codici uses a single 50 Hz alternating current. All codes that do not use the 178 Hz carrier are used identically for both BACC and RS4 Codici. Thus, BACC is backward-compatible to RS4 Codici.
An alarm is sounded in the cab if the train exceeds the speed setpoint by more than 3 km/h. If the train exceeds the speed setpoint by more than 5 km/h or misses the designated stopping place, the system applies emergency brakes.

R. A. Chandrasena

R A Chandrasena was a Sri Lankan musician who earned his reputation as a highly talented and gifted artist and also by his contribution to the Sri Lankan music discipline and the industry during 1940-1980. 
He commenced his career when he was twelve years old in late 1930s at his entry to the musical programmes in Radio Ceylon (now known as Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation) with his gifted talents in playing many musical instruments whatever came to his hands. Notably, excelling in keyboard instruments such as Harmonium, Piano accordion, Piano, Organ and also the oriental instruments such as Tabla, Mandolin and Violin.
Chandrasena established his institute of music in December 1951 and titled it as Chandrasena Sangeethaayathanaya (Chandrasena Institute of Music). This institute turned out be the stepping stone for many musicians in that era and in the subsequent generation. R A Chandrasena provided his experties, knowledge and mentorship to many artists in a humble and relentless manner during his lifetime. 
In 1969, Chandrasena launched a gramophone record company by which 45 RPM EP records were issued to the Sri Lankan Sinhala songs market under the labels of RAC and Shrimath. All the songs in these records were composed and music directed by R A Chandrasena and he managed to use the talents of many professional singers and lyrics writers effectively in these master pieces.
During his relatively short life, he achieved reputations as a professional composer, a singer, a drama/film music director, a music teacher and more over as a mentor for many musicians and artists at the early stages of their professional path, especially in refining their talents. Among the many, the key personalities who were well coached and mentored by Chandrasena are, Dharmadasa Walpola (1949), Guruge Khemadasa Perera later known as Premasiri Khemadasa (1953), and Victor Ratnayake (1962)".
Life in brief (1924–1980).
Chandrasena was born on August 27, 1924 in Mahanuvara, much known as Kandy, in central Sri Lanka to a Sinhala Buddhist family. At birth, he was named as Ranasinghe Arachchige Chandrasena Perera. His parents were Ranasinghe Arachchige Jeiris Perera and Selesthina Dias Abeysinghe whose generations had been from Mahanuwara. Chandrasena was the third child of the eleven children in the family. His father was not a musician by profession, but a highly talented musician whose exposure could have influenced Chandrasena to admire music since his childhood.
Chandrasena was educated at Sri Rahula college in Kandy, Prince College in Kotahena and Sri Dharmaloka College in Keleniya. He had the previllege of being mentored by Ananda Samarakoon at Prince College, D B Dhanapala and C M Weerartne at Sri Dharmaloka College. D B Dhanapala was the principle at Sri Dharmaloka College who later became a veteran journalist in Sri Lanka and the Editor-in-Chief at DAVASA newspaper founded in 1961 by M. D. Gunasena and Company, Sri Lanka. C. M. Weeraratne was a teacher at Sri Dharmaloka College who later became the Vice Principal of Ananda College. Further, Chandrasena was also mentored and well supported by U A S Perera, well known as Siri Ayya in his children musical programmes at Radio Ceylon.
In 1943, Chandrasena met a young talented singer, named Mohoppu Arachchige Shriyaawathie Perera who was later known as Sriyani Chandrasena, at an audition programme that was conducted at Radio Celyon. They got married on July 26, 1946. Sriyani had a brief career as a singer, but largely, she became the devoted lifetime supporting partner for Chandrasena in his all musical creations and events throughout. They had three children Thilangani, Lalith and Darshani.
R A Chandrasena died in the early hours of March 1, 1980, after a brief heart illness. Sriyani continued Chandrasena's vision and the practice at Chandrasena Sangeethaanayathanaya and prepared the youngest daughter Darshani in the music profression. Darshani was graduated in music at the Faculty of Esthetic Studies at University of Kelaniya, Sri Lanka and became a teaching professional in music. 
Sriyani Chandrasena died on August 4, 2009.
As a singer.
Chandrasena's singing voice became much heard and popular by the famous song "Dasabaladhari Budu Raju Pera Kala" in 1948 March. This was the theme song of the stage drama Sanda Kinduri that was produced by Vasantha Kumara, a well reputed oriental dancer. The lyrics of the song was done by S L Kakulawela who later became the vice chancellor of University of Kelaniya, Sri Lanka. The lyrics was based on the story of a previous life (Chanda Kinnara Jaathakaya) of Gautama Buddha during which he was born as a mermaid species in the Himalayan mountain range in India. This song was composed by R A Chandrasena himself and this was supposed to be his first ever melody. This is still a well known and much respected song in the Sri Lankan music.

Pesukei dezimra

Pesukei dezimra (Aramaic: פְסוּקֵי דְּזִמְרָא, P'suqế dh'zimra "hymnal verses") or "zemirot", as they are called in the Spanish and Portuguese tradition, are a group of prayers that are recited daily during Jewish morning services. The prayers consist of various blessings, psalms, and sequences of verses.
The purpose of "pesukei dezimra" is so an individual will recite praises of God prior to making requests of God which take place later during Shacharit and throughout the day.
Origin.
Initially, pesukei dezimra consisted of only psalms 145-150, initiated by Rabbi Jose in the 2nd century. For a long time, these prayers remained optional. But Maimonides said that prayer should be recited in an upbeat mood, and as a result, these prayers became a part of the regular service. Maimonides also said that these prayers should be recited slowly and wholeheartedly, and that rushing through them as many who recite them daily do defeats their purpose.
Shabbat/Yom Tov additions.
On Shabbat, holidays of Biblical origin, and Hoshana Rabbah, various psalms are added between "Hodu" and "Yehi Khevod". The reason for additions is that no one has to rush off to work on these days, thereby allowing extra time for praise.
Ashkenazi Judaism includes the followings psalms in the following order: 19, 33, 34, 90, 91, 135, 136, 92, and 93.
Sephardic Judaism includes the followings psalms in the following order: 103, 19, 33, 90, 91, 98, 121, 122, 123, 124, 135, 136, 92, and 93.
On Shabbat and Yom Tov, Nishmat is inserted between the Song of the sea and the closing blessing.
Following Nishmat, Shochein Ad is inserted. On Shabbat, the chazzan is changed prior to the recitation of Shochein Ad. On Yom Tov, this occurs one paragraph earlier ("Hakel B'Tzatzumot"). On High Holidays, the new chazzan takes over at the word "Hamelekh" ("the King").
Do women recite Pesukei Dezimra?
There are questions as to whether women are required or even permitted to recite Pesukei Dezimra, given that it is considered by some to be a timebound commandment. The opinions either require women to recite it completely, prohibit its recitation among women, allow but not require its recitation, or allow its recitation but prohibit Barukh She'amar and Yishtabach from being recited.
Ashkenazi Judaism considers Pesukei Dezimra to be an obligation on the basis that it is not timebound, and it can be recited at any time of day.
Opinions in Sephardic Judaism are divided. Some opinions allow women to recite Pesukei Dezimra without its accompanying blessings.

Menwhopause

Menwhopause is a five-member rock band based in Delhi, India.
Early career.
The band was formed in 2001 by guitarist Anup Kutty with an original lineup of singer/songwriter Sarabjit Chadha and acoustic guitarist Inder Pal Singh (IP). The trio became a full fledged band after recruiting bassist Randeep Singh and drummer Rahul Chatterjee. In a country where popular music is dominated with commercial Bollywood music and the live rock music scene is generally full of cover bands, Menwhopause stuck to playing original compositions and were one of the first bands in India to distribute their music for free over the internet. Their first EP called "The story begins..." was released online as a free download in 2003. Ever since its formation, the band has gone through two line-up changes - the first with original drummer Rahul Chatterjee being replaced by Hemendra Nath "Hemzi" in 2008. The current line-up includes French drummer Paul Schneiter. In mid-2012, Sarabjit Chadha quit the band citing personal commitments.
Album and tour.
In 2006 they released their first full length album "Home" on their own record label, "The Middle Earth Company". The album gained the band international recognition, making them the first Indian rock band to be invited to perform at the SxSW festival in Austin, Texas. The band's tour was sponsored by the Indian Centre for Cultural Relations, which made them the first ever rock band to be supported by the cultural arm of the Government of India. 
The band also did a month long tour of the southwestern United States playing in around 10 cities in and around Texas.
In February 2008, the band won an online poll for the Best Band of the Year 2007 conducted by Jack Daniel's in India. This got them a chance to fly to Lynchburg, Tennessee in April 2008 where they performed at the "Legendary Mash Festival" and worked with R.E.M.'s producer David Barbe.
The band signed a major record deal with EMI-Virgin Records (India) in 2008 to release their second full length album "Easy". Instead of conventional studio recording, the band began work on the album by recording the tracks in a makeshift studio set up by them in a village in Uttaranchal, a state in the Himalayas, during September 2006. The album took four years to be produced with the band bringing in mixing engineer and co-producer Miti Adhikari (BBC London) and Grammy Award winning mastering engineer Richard Dodd.
The album was initially released on digital format through iTunes and Amazon.com in early-January 2011 followed by physical CD format on 26 January 2011. The album immediately received favourable reviews by critics with The Times of India calling it "by far, one of the most brilliant works from an Indian rock act."
The album artwork for "Easy" was done by award-winning art director Abhishek Dey who has been a regular with the band having designed the layouts for the band's first album.
In December 2011, the band did a 20-day workshop with the inmates of Tihar Jail - South Asia's largest complex of prisons - and helped them form a band called The Flying Souls which later performed inside Tihar Jail. The band has also been actively involved in recording and producing songs composed by The Flying Souls through frequent visits to the prison.
Etymology.
The name "Menwhopause" was borrowed from Anup's quiz team in college that went by the same name. The band has always maintained that the pun was actually unintentional and they were more interested in the word "pause" being part of the band's name. In recent interviews, the band has been quoted giving different origins of the name. Some of them include a tyre company in Brazil, tattooed fans and an attribution to Randeep's mother.

Green DeWitt

Green DeWitt (February 12, 1787 – May 18, 1835) was an empresario in Mexican Texas. He founded the DeWitt Colony.
Early years.
DeWitt was born in Lincoln County, Kentucky, moving with his family while still an infant to Missouri. At the time, Missouri was a part of Spanish-held Louisiana. At 18, he returned to Kentucky, and studied for two years at the college level, then returned to Missouri once again. In 1808 he married Sara Seely of St. Louis, Missouri, and enlisted in the Missouri militia. He fought in the War of 1812, rising to the rank of Captain by the wars end, then was elected Sheriff of Ralls County, Missouri.
Texas.
In 1822, DeWitt petitioned the Mexican government for permission to settle colonists in Texas but was denied. After gaining the support of Stephen F. Austin, an influential Texas empresario, DeWitt's second petition, in 1825,
was granted. He was given permission to settle 400 respectable, industrious, Catholic families in an area bounded by the Guadalupe River, San Marcos River, and Lavaca River. This colony was southwest of Austin's. DeWitt hired James Kerr as his surveyor. Kerr placed the capital, called Gonzales after Rafael Gonzales, provisional governor of Coahuila y Tejas, at the confluence of the San Marcos and Guadalupe Rivers. The first settlers arrived in the summer of 1825. DeWitt visited the colony in October, but spent much of 1825 in Missouri recruiting settlers. DeWitt was accused of misappropriation of funds in San Antonio, Texas, by settler Peter Ellis Bean, but was exonerated on October 16, 1825. Sara DeWitt, whose Brooke County, Virginia family was quite wealthy, contributed to her husband's endeavors, selling off some of her property in Missouri to help finance his venture. 
In July 1826 Gonzales was raided by Indians who were looking for horses. Most of the settlers fled temporarily to Austin's colony. Although the colonization laws specified that settlements should not be established within 10 leagues of the coast, DeWitt gained permission from the Bexar authorities to establish a temporary settlement, which they called Old Station, on Matagorda Bay near the mouth of the Lavaca River. The settlement would be allowed until enough colonists had arrived to be able to see to their own safety in Gonzales. By October 1826 40 people lived in Old Station, including Dewitt and his family. His family included his wife, two sons, and three of his four daughters in Gonzales, the fourth daughter having already married in Missouri. 
Because the Mexican government had made an error and included another colony in the contract grant, DeWitt had numerous disputes with colony founder Martín De León. At one point, DeWitt was arrested, on the authorization of the Mexican government, due to Martín De León claiming tobacco being shipped into the colony was contraband. Tensions eased somewhat when Stephen Austin stepped in, but the damage caused to the relationship of DeWitt and De León would never be repaired. As a result of his arrest, however, Mexican authorities ordered that Old Station be abandoned, and Gonzales was reestablished. 
In 1827, DeWitt joined Austin and De Leon in signing a peace treaty with the Karankawa so that their colonies would be safe from their raids. DeWitt also negotiated a peace treaty with the Tonkawa, but were unable to reach terms with the Comanche. As Comanche raids took a toll on the settlement, the political chief in Bexar sent the settlers of Gonzales a small cannon that they could use for their protection. In 1830 Mexican authorities passed a law prohibiting further immigration to Texas from the United States. Austin was able to secure a waiver for DeWitt's colony, but the measure made it difficult for him to recruit families. When his contract expired on April 15, 1831, he had settled a total of 166 families. Because he was unable to meet the terms of the contract, any unassigned lands in his colony reverted to the Mexican government, and DeWitt was unable to get a further contract.
By 1831 the colony was becoming successful, but DeWitt's finances were depleted, having used a lot of his family's funds to help keep the colony going. In 1835, near the time of the start of hostilities that would result in the Texas Revolution, DeWitt traveled to Monclova, in Mexico, in an attempt to obtain more premium land for the colony, but was unsuccessful. While in Monclova, he contracted cholera, and died on May 18, 1835, being buried in an unmarked grave. During the Battle of Gonzales, following his death, his wife Sara and daughter Naomi cut up a dress to make the banner "Come and Take It", which has since become a symbol of pride for the community.

Hogao

Hogao, also known as criollo sauce, is typically used in Colombian cuisine. It is made with round onions, long green onions, tomatoes, garlic, cumin, salt and pepper that are sauteed during the cooking process. It is used for meats, arepas, rice and other dishes, and can complement the famous bandeja paisa. The recipe varies from region to region. 
Its name comes from the old use of the verbs 'ahogar' and 'rehogar' that reference a slow cooking technique.
Goya Foods sells bottled Hogao commercially, in the United States.

Umnumzaan

The Umnumzaan is a folding pocket knife manufactured by Chris Reeve Knives of Boise, Idaho, and designed by Chris Reeve. The name "Umnumzaan" is derived from the Zulu language, meaning "Head of the family," or "Boss" (colloq.), a tribute to Mr. Reeve's South Africa origins.The Umnumzaan was designed to meet the needs of operators seeking a heavy-duty folder capable of handling heavy use and even abuse. Building upon the Sebenza’s success, the Umnumzaan features: a stronger pivot joint, a thicker blade, a different blade grind with a reinforced tip, improved ergonomics, thicker titanium handles, a thicker titanium lock bar, a stronger ceramic ball detent system, a larger titanium spacer (sometimes called a “stand off”), a phosphor-bronze washer system designed to act as a ‘dry-sump’ to retain lubrication and keep dirt out, an oversized ambidextrous-thumb studs & extended lock bar to aid operation when wearing gloves, a lanyard pivot joint that uses pivoting lanyard tie bars, and a deeply textured grip.
Design.
The Umnumzaan implements a version of the Chris Reeve Integral Lock. The original Integral Lock (sometimes referred to as the “frame lock” or“titanium frame lock”) developed by Reeve in 1987, was first implemented in the Sebenza folding pocket knife. This lock employs a titanium lock bar, milled out of the knife's handle material. At lock up, the titanium lock bar comes in direct contact with the back of the blade, thus locking the blade in the open position. The Umnumzaan Integral Lock utilizes a ceramic ball that serves two functionsthe ball acts as the interface between the blade locking surface and the integral locking arm as the knife assumes the open position. The ball also mates with a detent in the blade in the closed position to secure the blade from opening accidentally.
The Umnumzaan blade pivot is implemented with a pivot screw and pin, and is supported by perforated phosphor bronze thrust washers. The functions of the perforations are to reduce friction due to a reduction in surface area relative to that of a solid washer, and to increase the duration of use between cleanings by housing lubricant in the perforations. Over the life of the Umnumzaan, the pivot and washers have been incrementally modified.
The thumb lug on the Umnumzaan is used for opening the knife blade, as well as serving as the stop pin that contacts the titanium handle slabs upon lockup. Around each lug is a polyurethane o-ring that acts as a shock absorber to cushion the shock of opening, and reduce the audible noise of opening. The use of the shock absorber concept was pioneered by knife designers Grant and Gavin Hawk, and is being implemented in the Umnumzaan with their consent.
The knife also features a glass-breaker, but unlike many other glass-breakers on folding knives, the tip is part of the blade itself which protrudes from the pivot side when the knife is closed. The Umnumzaan also was the first Chris Reeve folding knife to incorporate a lanyard pivot joint, which dramatically reduces the friction wear that over time destroys paracord lanyards. It also allows easy swapping of lanyards without a need to cut and retie if the owner has multiple lanyard pivots (referred to as a “cord tie bar” by Chris Reeve Knives). The lanyard pivot joint has since been incorporated on the Sebenza Classic 2000, Sebenza 21, and Sebenza 25.
The specifications of the Umnumzaan are as follows:
The Umnumzaan was introduced at the 2008 Blade Show and International Cutlery Fair, and was named the 2008 Blade Show "Overall Knife of the Year."
Generation Revisions and Incremental Changes & Upgrades.
Since the 2008 introduction, the Umnumzaan has seen several incremental improvements and one generational change. These changes have all been minor and very few visual changes have occurred since initial introduction. Around 2011, changes to the lock bar were made to make engaging the lock with one hand easier (through making the bottom portion of the lock bar slightly more flared, which was a common request voiced by owners on various knife forums). 
The second generation Umnumzaan saw numerous modifications that utilizes some of the newer technologies found on the Sebenza 25. The single-most visual change was replacing the oversized custom pivot with a more traditional (Sebenza-style) pivot brushing. This new pivot no longer requires the Umnumzaan Take-down Tool and instead a traditional hex wrench is all that is needed to disassemble and reassemble the knife. This pivot is larger than most blade pivot brushing systems and is identical to the one used on the newer Large Sebenza 25 (mid-2012 release and with a pivot that is significantly thicker than the pivot used on the previous Large Sebenza 21). This pivot also incorporates a newer generation washer system with larger washer perforations, which helps retain lubricating grease better than previous designs, while simultaneously keeping elements out of the pivot system to increase service intervals. The change in pivot and washers is complimented by the modifications made to the ceramic ball and detent system, in which a larger ceramic ball in a slightly different location is used to make opening smoother and reduce wear (although it is unclear as to exactly when this specific change began). 
Shortly before this generational change, a Lock Bar Stabilizer (or LBS) was added to prevent 'hyperextension' of the titanium lock bar. While this change is commonly referred to as part of the second generation Umnumzaan, there are a few models made in early-mid 2012 which have both the old pivot brushing and the lock bar stabilizer, although these are relatively rare. 
The blade steel has also seen a minor revision. While not made at any specific point of revision, like other Chris Reeve Knives that had used CPM-S30V stainless blade steel, the Umnumzaan saw a blade steel phase to CPM-S35VN. While similar to S30V, S35VN is an incremental improvement in which Vanadium is used to make sharpening easier and increase toughness and Niobium to increase toughness and further refine uniform grain formation. Rockwell Hardness is still at 58-59 HRC and edge retention is not much different than S30V. This change was made progressively as S30V blade supply was exhausted. 
Dating changes and specific points of change is difficult as no single source provides all of the information on the revisions made, and Chris Reeve Knives is known for making frequent small and incremental changes to their knives over periods of years, often as a response to owner feedback and not always with any formal notice. 
Variations.
While many folding knives are available with many different options (for example, blade steels, blade coatings, handle material, handle color, graphic designs, different blade shapes, etc.), the Umnumzaan is largely a ‘what-you-see-is-what-you-get’ knife as there are very few different variants available. When the knife was first produced, a limited edition of 20 Umnumzaans were produced with the word “UMNUMZAAN” and “1 of 20” engraved into the titanium handle. Two decorated Graphic Umnumzaans shortly followed. When Chris Reeve changed to S35VN, two Unique Graphic Umnumzaans were made which advertised a ‘mystery steel’. This steel was later revealed to be CPM-S35VN. 
As for mass-produced variants of the Umnumzaan, only three options exist: the standard Umnumzaan, a Tanto Umnumzaan, and a Wilson Combat Umnumzaan; all are available in right-handed and left-handed configurations. While the Tanto Umnumzaan looks identical to the standard Umnumzaan other than the blade shape, the Wilson Combat has a significantly different handle pattern. Commonly labeled the ‘Star Tac’, the Wilson Combat Umnumzaan has a heavily textured design that spans the entire handle, and a different lanyard with a “Wilson Combat” labeled titanium bead.

Spinetta Marengo

Spinetta Marengo (Marengh in piedmontese) is a town in Piedmont, Italy located within the municipal boundaries of the "comune" of Alessandria. The population is 6,417.
On 14 June 1800 the village was the scene of an important battle between the French army commanded by Napoleon and an Austrian army led by Melas. Every second Sunday in June, there is traditionally a costumed commemoration of the battle, drawing many international visitors. According to local legend, Majno, a thief who was said to have robbed Pope Pius VII whilst on his way to Paris in 1804 to crown Napoleon emperor, laid up in hiding in the woods of Fraschetta, just by Spinetta Marengo. 
The famous dish Chicken Marengo is named after the town. According to legend, Napoleon's chef created the dish from the few ingredients he could find after the battle, using a sabre instead of a cooking knife.
Museum.
There is a museum, founded in 1846, containing weapons and relics of the battle.
The Marengo treasure.
In 1928 precious objects from the Roman period were uncovered by farmers in a field near the village of Marengo. Dating from the 2nd century, the objects, all in very bad condition, included a silver bust representing the emperor Lucius Verus and a silver vase decorated with acanthus leaves. The objects today are conserved in the Museum of Antiquity of Turin, awaiting restoration.

List of Blue Peter presenters

"Blue Peter" is a British children's television programme created by John Hunter Blair. The first programme was broadcast on 16 October 1958, and the series still airs as of 2013. It is the longest-running children's television programme in the world, and also one of the longest-running television programmes in the world. "Blue Peter" currently airs weekly on Thursdays in the United Kingdom on CBBC, a digital television channel. "Blue Peter" is produced in a magazine format, often transmitting live, and features a combination of studio presentation, interviews and outside broadcasting items. There have been thirty-six official presenters of "Blue Peter".
The first presenters of "Blue Peter" were Christopher Trace and Leila Williams. Trace presented for nearly nine years, and Williams for just over three years (although no footage of her has been retained by the BBC). In the early days, as the show ran continuously on a weekly basis, other presenters occasionally stepped in to give the regular team a break. Artist Tony Hart and actress Ann Taylor both presented the show either in place of either Trace or Williams, or sometimes in place of both, with Taylor replacing Williams for six weeks in 1959 and presenting the show at least once alone, as did Hart. When Williams was fired from the show in 1962 following a series of spats with a newly appointed producer, Trace continued to present the show alone or with one-off presenters until a replacement was found. The role went to Anita West, who presented sixteen editions over a four-month period in 1962—the shortest tenure of any full-time presenter—before abruptly resigning due to her imminent divorce, a reason she hid from the producers. Her tenure was so short that no footage from her time on "Blue Peter" exists in the BBC Archives, although footage of her audition remains, along with that of Valerie Singleton and other auditionees. It was not until 1998 that West was officially recognised as a former presenter. John Noakes is the longest-serving presenter, having presented the show for over twelve years, and Konnie Huq is the longest-serving female presenter, with a tenure of over ten years, beating Valerie Singleton by three months. However, although Singleton left the series full-time in 1972 to present the spin-off series "Blue Peter Special Assignment", she continued to be an occasional presenter until 1975. Sandra Michaels presented the show twice in April 1964 in the absence of Singleton and impressed producer Edward Barnes enough that he considered replacing Singleton, but Michaels turned him down and he opted to carry on with Singleton, something he admits in hindsight he was glad he did. The youngest presenter of "Blue Peter" was Yvette Fielding, who was eighteen when she began presenting, and the oldest was John Noakes, who was forty-four when he left. Only one presenter, Peter Duncan, had two stints of presenting, his first being from 1980 to 1984, and his second being from 1985 to 1986.
The only presenter to have been fired from "Blue Peter" mid-contract is Richard Bacon, who was dismissed from the show in 1998 after it emerged that he had taken cocaine. A number of other presenters have garnered negative publicity for aspects of their private lives, which has been described in some sections of the British media as the "curse of "Blue Peter"". Nevertheless, many of the show's former presenters have continued to work in the media. Indeed, Bacon's career survived his dismissal; he has since presented "The Big Breakfast" and "Top of the Pops" among numerous other radio and television shows, some of which were for the BBC.
Since its move to Salford in September 2011, "Blue Peter" has had a format with two permanent presenters, currently Helen Skelton and Barney Harwood, supplemented by guest presenters for particular topics, such as Naomi Wilkinson for wildlife.
On 4 March 2013, the BBC announced they were searching for a new presenter to start in the summer of 2013. They announced that CBBC stars Dick and Dom would be hosting a new TV show to find the next presenter. The show began on 24 June as "Blue Peter - You Decide!". The judges were Myleene Klass, Eamonn Holmes and Ceallach Spellman. The winner was chosen after five weeks of competition, via a public vote. On 25 July 2013, it was announced that 22-year-old Lindsey Russell had won the public vote to become "Blue Peter"'s 36th presenter. 
On 8 August 2013, Skelton announced on air that she was leaving the show in September after five years, to be replaced by Radzi Chinyanganya.

Two the Hard Way Tour

The Two The Hard Way Tour (also known as "Allman and Woman Tour") was a concert tour by American singer-actress Cher and American singer Gregg Allman, designed to promote their joint "Two the Hard Way" album.
"Two the Hard Way" was a commercial flop, and dates of the tour in the United States were very limited. There were more dates in Japan, Oceania and Europe.
History.
At the time of the tour, Cher had just finished production of "The Sonny & Cher Show" after a broken six-year run. Allman's band, The Allman Brothers Band, was in the middle of an acrimonious breakup.
The European leg of the tour covered the Netherlands, Belgium, France, England, Wales, Scotland, and West Germany, over a span of 29 days. The tour would start November 6, 1977, and was to be a 29 date tour, but on December 3, 1977 Cher pulled the plug on the tour and left Gregg in Europe while she headed back to the United States with her children. 
The pair were backed by an eight-piece band. The show, whose material was selected by both of them, combined both Allman's material, which he sang solo, and numerous duets between the two on softer material in a Blues or Country-Western vein. Cher avoided the gaudy, over-the-top outfits of her normal stage self, and instead wore jeans, a tank top, and a cowboy hat. The two also engaged in some married-couple stage banter, although not to the Sonny and Cher level. 
In November 1977, following their opening show in Bruxelle, Belgium, Allman said that he had had some concerns about the endeavor. "It's the first time ever we've given concerts together. We wondered a lot about how it would work out. For one thing, we didn't know if we'd be accepted." Cher said, "It's different, but not that different, and I also find it real easy to sing this type of music," sentiments she had said before the tour as well, "We sound like we've been singing together for a long time." 
Allman did not want this tour's road expenses to mount up, as they had for the last Allman Brothers Band tour. However, this tour too lost money from the start. The Hard Way Tour also led to the final breakup of the couple. While pre-tour publicity had emphasized that Gregg Allman was free from drug and alcohol problems, Cher discovered during the tour that Gregg Allman's drinking had returned, and once the tour was complete, she told him that their marriage finally was done for good.
Partial set list.
The set list included:

Tour dates.
For some dates* the opening act was Splinter.
Broadcasts and recordings.
Concerts were only recorded in Oceania and Japan. Video or photographic records of these concerts are very hard to come by, but in early 2008, three low quality videos emerged on YouTube from the Japanese concerts. Cher is only in one video, but in Japan she sing also "You've Really Got A Hold On Me". The couple were guests on the UK television show "The Old Grey Whistle Test" in 1977 to promote the album and tour, clips of which can be seen in the documentaries "Still Cher" and "A&E Biography". They performed at least "Love Me" and "Move Me".

In 2004, the team was the 2004 Division I champions. He played club volleyball for Eden Volleyball Club in Eden, New York. Anderson followed an uncharacteristic growth path in his youth - only reaching his full height (6'10") as a Sophomore at Penn State. His original position was middle - playing that in his Sophomore and Junior seasons of high school. As he became more acclimated to the game he spent more time at Outside and at Right-side for Eden VBC. He ranks amongst the top alumni of the distinguished club to this day.
Penn State.
Anderson finished his career with 1,212 kills and 82 aces, both which rank in the top 13 in Penn State history. He had a decorated career, especially in 2008 as he helped lead the Nittany Lions to their second ever NCAA Men's Volleyball Championship against Pepperdine. He was named the NCAA Championship Most Outstanding Player for his 29 kill performance against the Waves. Other awards for 2008 include EIVA Player of the Year, AVCA National Player of the Year, AVCA First Team All-America, and All-EIVA First Team.
Professional.
On July 1, 2008, he announced he would forgo his 2009 senior year at Penn State and signed a professional contract with Hyundai Capital Skywalkers of the Korean league. In his debut season, Anderson helped the Skywalkers claim first in the regular season before losing 3-1 in the championship series. Anderson then played in the Italian League for Tonno Callipo Volley from July 2010 until 2011. In the season of 2011-2012 he played with Modena Volley.

Japanese Chilean

History.
The number of Japanese settlers in Chile never went above 900 between 1910 and 1940. Among those who entered the nation, there was a wide diversity of persons ranging from professionals and businessmen to laborers re-migrating from neighboring countries, especially Peru, where it has the second largest Japanese population in Latin America and the sixth largest in world. They were possibly isolated in the nitrate-rich north and attracted particularly to the southern regions of Valparaíso and Santiago. They found employment in a variety of jobs as salaried workers and in small business interests, especially as barbers. The early Nikkei community was largely male. The majority of Issei men married Chilean women . Their children, the Nisei, were raised with the belief of "If they are going to live in Chile, let them be Chilean".
However, World War II once more motivated anti-Japanese sentiments and interrupted the Nikkei’s process of integration into Chilean society. Starting in early 1943, several dozen Japanese Chileans were forced to move from strategically sensitive areas (such as copper mines) to the national interior. Meanwhile, the Japanese community received bigger unity, offering mutual support in the face of wartime oppositions. These ties would later resurface after the war with the organization of the Japanese Beneficence Society ("Sociedad Japonesa de Beneficencia"). 
By the 1990s, Chilean Nikkei enjoyed middle-class status, a high educational level, and employment in white-collar jobs. Contrary to trends in other Latin American countries with a Nikkei population, only less than 5% of the ethnic Japanese population has gone to Japan to work as "dekasegis". The small size of the Japanese community, its lack of unity, and the increase of mixed marriages call into question the future of the Chilean Nikkei. There are an estimated 3,800 Japanese and descendants.
Language.
Most Japanese Chileans only speak Spanish. Only a selected number can speak Japanese, while those with higher education speak English. There are even a number of Japanese Chilean schools that offer English-language teaching to the recent Japanese residents.
Religion.
The majority of Japanese Chileans are Roman Catholic Christians, while the rest are Buddhists and Shintoists.

William Robert Davidge

William Robert Davidge (1879-1961) was an Architect and Surveyor, who combined these skills with an enthusiasm for urban improvement to become one of the pioneering leaders of the British town planning movement of the early twentieth century. He also played a key role in the introduction of town planning to Australia and New Zealand. He served as President of the Royal Town Planning Institute from 1926-27.
Biography.
Early and Personal Life.
William Robert Davidge was born on February 17th 1879 in Teddington, Middlesex. His parents were Henry Thomas Davidge and Louisa Anderson Davidge. He entered University College in 1896, and also studied at Kings College, graduating with a degree in architecture in 1900. He married Kathleen Mary Lane and had three children, Kathleen Enid Grace Davidge (24 Sep 1910), Margaret Mary Davidge (6 Jun 1912), and Helen Joyce "Jane" Davidge (15 May 1919).
Architect.
From 1902 to 1907 Davidge was an assistant to W.E. Riley in the architect's department of the London County Council. He became an associate member of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1904. In July 1912 he was made a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects. 
Surveyor.
While a student Davidge was articled to Marshall Hainsworth, Surveyor to the Teddington Urban District Council. From 1907 to 1916 he was District Surveyor for Lewisham, Greenwich, and Woolwich. In 1919 he became Housing Commissioner for the Southern Counties and later for the London area.
Town Planner.
In the early 1900s Davidge took an interest in the emerging British Garden City Movement. In 1909 he presented a paper to the Institution of Surveyors (later to become the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors) in support of the Housing, Town Planning, &c. Act 1909 which proposed to make it mandatory for local authorities in the United Kingdom to introduce town planning systems. 
From 1921 Davidge practiced as a consulting town planner and architect-surveyor, and in 1926 he was elected President of the Royal Town Planning Institute, as well as serving as Chair of the Executive of the Garden Cities and Town Planning Association (later to become the Town and Country Planning Association). Davidge prepared professional planning reports for places throughout the United Kingdom, including recommendations for Bedfordshire, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, Hertfordshire, West Kent and Belfast, Northern Ireland. As well as being a member of architecture and planning institutes, he was also an associate member of the Institution of Civil Engineers.
Influence in New Zealand and Australia.
In 1914, Davidge travelled to New Zealand and from there to Australia. In both New Zealand and Australia Davidge gave a series of public lectures with Charles Reade (1880 - 1933), another enthusiast of town planning, to promote the new planning paradigms. As a result of this tour Davidge drew up New Zealand's first civic improvement scheme, a plan for the Taranaki city of New Plymouth. Davidge's plan was not, however, implemented.

On March 27, 2008 Shut Up Stella was dropped by Epic and Malakouti decided to go solo.
In 2008 Malakouti's songs "Trash Me" and "Outsider" appeared in episodes of MTV's "The Hills". The songs were also independently released as music videos and digital downloads by Malakouti herself.
She is published as a songwriter by EMI and has been splitting her time between Los Angeles and London working on her debut solo album as well as writing for The UK's top pop production house Xenomania.
Jessie and the Toy Boys.
Jessie and the Toy Boys was launched in March 2010 with the first single "Push It" being released in February 2011 which peaked at 7 on the Billboard dance chart. As well as Push It, on the same day she released two other songs "Valentine" and "We Own The Night", which was used by The CW Network in their general promos for the network, as well as the station's written "motto" in their station promos.
In June 2011, Jessie and the Toy Boys released an EP titled, "Show Me Your Tan Lines", and made her network television debut on the Conan O'Brien Show. During this time, Jessie and the Toy Boys was one of the opening acts during Britney Spears' sixth concert tour, the Femme Fatale Tour. During this time she filmed her next single, "Lets Get Naughty" which was released in October 2011 and performed on Femme Fatale Tour.
Jessie and the Toy Boys debut album "This Is How Rumours Start" was due out in early 2012 but has failed to surface. Although there was no album release, she released a few YouTube videos of unreleased songs during 2012 as well as a music video for "On With My Bad Self" but the song was later not released.
In May 2013 Jessie released a music video for what was originally a Toy Boys song "White Girl Wasted" under her own name, Jessie Malakouti. This has sparked rumours that she will no longer be releasing music under the name Jessie and the Toy Boys.
On September 27, 2013, Malakouti uploaded a picture via her Facebook page confirming that she had signed a new recording contract with Virgin Records.
Discography.
In 2011 Jessie released the promotional albums "Push It Featuring Yelawolf: The Remixes" and "Show Me Your Tan Lines" under the moniker "Jessie and The Toy Boys".

Tius

Tius was an ancient settlement on the southern coast of the Black Sea, in what is now Turkey; it is still the name of a Catholic titular see. The original diocese was a suffragan of Claudiopolis in Honorias; its see was also known as Tium, Tieium, Tieion, Tios or Tion (). It corresponds to modern Filyos (Hisarönü). Modern Filyos (Filyas) stands on the ruins of ancient Tium, which included remains of ramparts and sculptures. It is not far from the mouth on the Black Sea of the Filyas River, the Billaeus in the antique period. 
According to Strabo (542, 545) the town was only remarkable as the birthplace of Philetaerus, founder of the royal dynasty of Pergamus. The coins give a certain Dionysius as the founder; in fact it was the site of a temple of Dionysius and one of Jupiter. Tieion was a Greek colony of Miletus
Novel xxix of Justinian locates the town in Paphlagonia but geographically is in Bithynia. George Pachymeres (I, 312) mentions Tium among the Byzantine towns which escaped the attacks of the Seljuks in 1269.

University of New Mexico School of Law

The University of New Mexico School of Law is the law school of the University of New Mexico, located in Albuquerque. It is the only law school in the state of New Mexico. Approximately 350 students attend the school, with approximately 115 enrolled in the first-year class. By design, the school has remained this size in order to provide students more hands-on learning and individual attention from professors. Its student-to-faculty ratio of 10.0 is one of the best in the nation. It also has one of the highest student diversity indexes of any law school in the country, with Hispanics as the largest minority group. The National Jurist legal magazine ranked UNM the 6th Best Value among law schools, a ranking based on several criteria including students' average indebtedness after graduation, student employment rates, and tuition costs.
The school is currently ranked 69th by U.S. News & World Report and boasts the 7th ranked Clinical Law program in the country. UNM Law School is one of only 80 law schools nationwide to have a chapter of the Order of the Coif. 
Academics.
Notable Programs.
Highly regarded educational programs at the law school include clinical education, Indian law, and natural resources and environmental law.
The in-house Clinical Law Program has been consistently recognized as among the country’s best. Though clinical education is optional at most law schools, participation in the clinic is required of all UNM law students. The Indian Law Program includes a specialized program of study leading to a certificate in Indian Law, the Southwest Indian Law Clinic, and the faculty-edited "Tribal Law Journal".
The Natural Resources and Environmental Law Program includes a specialized program of study leading to a certificate in the field and the faculty-edited "Natural Resources Journal".
The School of Law has a unique relationship with the state government. Under the terms of the Constitution, the Dean of the School of Law has the responsibility of chairing the state's judicial selection process. The Dean also has the statutory responsibility of chairing the state's Judicial Compensation Commission and serving on numerous other boards, committees and commissions. Moreover, the School of Law has the primary responsibility for all judicial education within the state. 
Exchange and Study Abroad Programs.
Study abroad opportunities are available with special UNM exchange programs in Mexico, Canada, and Tasmania. The law school also has an exchange program with the Franklin Pierce Law Center, which allows UNM students to study patent and intellectual property law at that New Hampshire school.
Joint Degrees.
The school offers the following joint degrees:
Students may seek other dual programs with permission of the relevant graduate or professional school at the University of New Mexico and the law school.
Admissions.
The School of Law describes its admissions process as follows:
A five-member Admissions Committee reviews all applications and makes final decisions on acceptance for admission into the next fall’s entering class. The Committee is three full-time faculty members, the Assistant Dean for Admissions, and one third-year law student elected by the student body.
The Committee begins reviewing files near the end of the Fall semester; however, in many instances, a final decision is not made until late April. The Admissions Committee considers quantifiable factors (LSAT and grade point average) and non-quantifiable factors (letters of recommendation, personal statement, and extracurricular activities) in making decisions. A substantial preference is given to New Mexico residents. The Committee also recognizes that special pre-law programs for minority and disadvantaged applicants provide valuable information about an applicant’s ability to succeed in law school, and participation in such programs is taken into account.
Applicants will receive email notification when their applications have been received and again when they are complete and ready for review. Applicants will receive decision letters by mail.
Competitions and Moot Courts.
Students may participate in the following competitions and moot courts at the law school:
Campus.
In 1971, the law school moved into its current building, designed by the architect Antoine Predock while he was working for George Wright & Associates.
In 2002, the law school opened the Fred Hart wing, designed by architect Edward Mazria.

The novel Harvesting the Heart is author Jodi Picoult's second novel, after "Songs of the Humpback Whale", published in 1993 by Viking. The novel comprises three parts: Conception, Growth and Delivery.
A review by ConsumerHelpWeb describes Picoult's novels as "absorbing and entertaining", and this is no exception, it "poses questions that are relevant to reviewer's own life and to [his/her] own relationships".
Synopsis.
Paige O'Toole only has a few memories of her mother, who left her when she was five, one of the most vivid being painting winged horses on the ceiling of her childhood home. After she grows up, marries Nicholas and gets pregnant, she starts to doubt her own maternal love and ability, based on her history and lack of maternal care as a child. After their son Max slips off the couch and gets a nosebleed, she, questioning her own competence as a mother, flees and goes on a journey of self-discovery.
Paige revisits her childhood home in Chicago and tracks down her mother, now teaching children how to ride horses. She understands more about her childhood and her mother, and returns to her husband and child.

History.
Trentino Volley SpA was founded on May 23, 2000; and two days later, it purchased the rights to play in the Serie A1 (Italy's First Division) from Ravenna, that had retired due to financial problems. The club played its first Serie A1 match in Parma on October 15, 2000, against Maxicono Parma, and was defeated 3–0. The first home match of the Trentino Volley was played on October 22, 2000, against Padova, and the home team came out victorious with a result of 3–2.
During its first two seasons, the team managed a tenth, and a ninth place finish at the end of the regular season. 
Players acquired by the team in his first Italian Serie A years included Lorenzo Bernardi and Andrea Sartoretti. In the summer of 2007 Trentino Volley made substantial purchases, as part of a strategy that would focus on a young team with talented players, such as Serbian Nikola Grbić, Bulgarians Vladimir Nikolov and Matey Kaziyski and Italian Emanuele Birarelli. Itas Trentino Diatec ended the following regular season with a first place finish, and stepped into the finals. On May 7, 2008 Trentino Volley defeated Piacenza 3–0, to win its first national championship title, and gain access to the CEV Champions League 2008–2009.
Trento run undefeated in the pool stages, with a first place finish in Group E. On April 5, 2009, at the "O2 Arena" in Prague, Trento defeated Iraklis Tessaloniki 3–1 in the final.
In 2009, the team flew to Doha (Qatar), to compete in the FIVB Men's Club World Volleyball Championship. On Sunday 8 November, Trentino Betclic won the final, with a score of 3–0 against the Poles of Skra Bełchatów, and became FIVB Club World Champion. In 2010, it won the Italian Cup and then successfully defended its Champions League title with a 3–0 victory (25–12,25–20, 25–21) over Dynamo Moscow.

Reformists and Democrats

Reformists and Democrats ("Riformisti e Democratici", ReD) is a predominantly social-democratic faction within the Democratic Party (PD), a political party in Italy.
It was founded in June 2004 as an association of more than 100 MPs close to the "Fondazione ItalianiEuropei", the think tank of Massimo D'Alema, and is basically composed by long-time "Dalemiani", such as Pier Luigi Bersani, Nicola Latorre, Marco Minniti, Barbara Pollastrini and Michele Ventura. Also some "Lettiani", including Paolo De Castro and Francesco Boccia, and some Populars, including Nicodemo Oliverio and Lino Duilio, formerly president of Popular Italy, joined the group. Paolo De Castro was appointed president, Lino Duilio vice president and Michele Ventura coordinator.
ReD, which proposes a structured model of party and its entry in the Party of European Socialists, had been increasingly critical of Walter Veltroni when secretary, so that in the 2009 Democratic Party leadership election most of its leading members supported the leadership bid of Pier Luigi Bersani, who was elected as the new party secretary.

Canada Stadium

The Canada Stadium (Hebrew: אצטדיון קנדה) in Ramat HaSharon is the main tennis venue in Israel and is used mainly by the Israeli Davis Cup and Fed Cup teams.
History.
Canada Stadium, seating 6,000 spectators, opened in 1977 on land that had been an old strawberry patch, which was given to the Israel Tennis Centers (ITC) by the government.[http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1066544/index.htm] It was part of an ITC project that included the opening of 13 other tennis centres in the country. After the opening, floodlights were added to the court, so that play could continue into the night.
The stadium is the "main court" of the tennis centre at Ramat Hasharon, which is the biggest in the country. A large number of up-and-coming Israeli tennis professionals regularly train at the centre, as well as some top-quality players. 
Future extension.
On December 20, 2007, it was announced that the capacity of the stadium would increase to around 9,000, by 2012. It is estimated that the total cost of the project will be around $4 million. Also, a roof will be installed over the court, so that play will be able to continue in the event of rain.

Yurii Tiutiunnyk

Yuri (Yurko) Yosypovych Tyutyunnyk () (Born April 20, 1891 in Budyshche, Pendivsky district, Zvenyhorodka county, Kiev Governorate of the Russian Empire — currently Zvenyhorodka Raion, Cherkasy Oblast, Ukraine — died October 20, 1930 in Moscow, Soviet Union) was a general of the Ukrainian People's Army of the Ukrainian People's Republic (UNR) during the Ukrainian-Soviet War.
Early years.
Yuri Tiutiunnyk was born on April 20, 1891, to a peasant family, former serfs Yosyp and Maryna, in the village of Budyshche, near Kiev. Remarkable is the fact that he was the grandson of Taras Shevchenko's sister Yaryna on the mother's side. His older cousins Levko and Ananiy Shevchenkos were one of the organizers of the Free Cossacks, later joining the UPSR. Only 5 out of 9 children in his family reached adulthood. Tiutiunnyk finished primary education at the village school and later an agrarian school in Uman. He was married, and had two daughters.
Military Service in World War I.
Tiutiunnyk was drafted into the Imperial Russian Army in 1913 and initially served in the 6th Siberian battalion in Vladivostok. With the outbreak of World War I, in 1914 he became a non-commissioned officer and was wounded during the Battle of Lodz, in Poland in October of that year. For his recovery Tiutiunnyk was transferred to a reserve regiment in Kremenchuk. Upon recovery he came back to the 6th battalion which at that time was fighting near the Lake Narach (today - in Belarus).
Later Tiutiunnyk was offered command of the 6th Siberian battalion by the regimental command, but because he was interested in military strategy, the army suggested he undertake formal military studies. Tiutiunnyk successfully took entrance tests to the 1st Kiev gymnasium, but soon he was sent to the Caucasus where he finished a military school in Gori (today in Georgia). After completing his studies, he was again offered command of the 6th battalion, which was still actively fighting during the war. Tiutiunnyk was wounded a second time, and after recuperating, he was sent to Simferopol, where he joined the 32nd Auxiliary battalion.
Revolution.
With the coming of the February Revolution, Tiutiunnyk's military acumen caught the attention of Alexander Kerensky, who was in Crimea at the time. Kerensky offered Tiutiunnyk command of the Headquarters of Odessa Military District, however Tiutiunnyk did not place much faith in the future of the Provisional Government, and declined the post. In Spring of 1917 he participated in creation of the 1st Simferopol Regiment of Hetman Doroshenko.
Tiutiunnyk left for Kiev as military representative for the 2nd All-Ukrainian Military Congress, the meeting of which was unsanctioned. There he became elected as a non-partisan member of the Central Rada, and chairman of the "Kiev Revolutionary Committee". Officially Tyutyunnyk was transferred to the 228th Reserve Regiment in Yekaterinoslav.
Ukrainian-Soviet War.
In the Autumn of 1917, Tiutiunnyk organized a unit of "Free Kozaks" in Zvenyhorodka, and became its leader. After the fall of Kiev to Bolshevik forces in 1918, Tiutiunnyk transformed the unit to a kish-size of 20 thousand and engaged in battles throughout central Ukraine. He had a number of victories over the Bolshevik forces, including winning battles against the Bolshevik's 8th Army and 8,000 group of Mikhail Muravyov, while reclaiming the towns and cities like Birzula and Vapniarka from Bolshevik forces. Later, in 1918, Tiutiunnyk's unit waged a guerilla warfare against both the occupying German forces and the forces of the new Hetmanate.
In February 1919, Tiutiunnyk merged his unit with that of Matviy Hryhoryev. Hryhoryev became the Commander in Chief while Tiutiunnyk became the Chief of Staff. The combined force was formidable, numbering over 23,000 soldiers, 52 cannon, and 20 armoured trains. The force cooperated through various battles, including with and against Bolshevik forces, against Entente forces and the White Army, taking under control cities of Kherson and Odessa.
Later, however, Tiutiunnyk concluded that the Bolshevik's aims in Ukraine were not beneficial, he united with the units of Ukrainian People's Army near Zhmerynka. In summer of 1919 along with the 3rd Steel Rifle Division, 2nd Volyn Division, and 2nd Halych Brigade conducted series of successful military operations liberating several cities such as Zhytomyr, Bratslav, Uman, and others. By the end of the summer his forces were faced against the Southern group of Iona Yakir and later in the fall dealing against the White movement General Yakov Slashchov.
From December 6, 1919 to May 5, 1920 took part in the First Winter Campaign under the command of Mykhailo Pavlenko, leading the Kiev Rifle Division with which he fought against the Bolsheviks to the fall of 1920.
Tiutiunnyk remained undaunted by the failure of the campaign, and participated in planning of the Second Winter Campaign. This campaign took place in 1921, and although there were some early victories, it ultimately ended in failure. The unit was overrun, and over 300 soldiers were executed by the Red Guard near Zhytomyr. Tiutiunnyk, together with a small number of soldiers, escaped.

Because of the Ukrainization policies of the Soviet government at that time, Tiutiunnyk was able to return to Soviet Ukraine after he was arrested on June 16, 1923 after crossing Dniester. The Soviet government invited him to work cooperatively, and he agreed, lecturing at the "School of Red Commanders" in Kharkiv. Later he co-wrote a movie script for the film "Zvenigora" by Alexander Dovzhenko He also played himself in an anti-Symon Petliura propaganda film.
Later, however, there was a reversal of Ukrainization policies in Soviet Ukraine and many Ukrainians became victims of political repression by the Stalinist regime. On February 12, 1929, Tiutiunnyk was arrested in Kharkiv, and deported to Moscow where he was put on trial. On December 3, 1929 he was found guilty of anti-Soviet agitation and sentenced to death. On October 20, 1930, he was executed by firing squad in Lubyanka, Moscow.
Family.
Tiutiunnyk's family was secretly transferred by the Cheka from abroad to Kharkiv, then after the death of Yurii they lived in Kuban until 1932. The further fate of Tiutiunnyk's family is unknown.
Tiutiunnyk in popular Ukrainian culture.
Through playing himself in various movie films, Tiutiunnyk created an image of himself as a dashing revolutionary in popular Soviet Ukrainian culture. This image was captured in verse by the Ukrainian writer Ivan Bahrianny and set to music by Hryhory Kytasty. The song "Pisnya Pro Tiutiunnyka" ( — "Song about Tiutiunnyk") describes a popular image of his unit rushing to Ukraine from Siberia to help the Petliura government of the Ukrainian National Republic in 1919.

Raffaello Squarise

Raffaello Squarise (13 November 1856—15 April 1945), also known as Raphael Squarise, was an Italian violinist, teacher, conductor, and composer, who settled in Adelaide, South Australia, and Dunedin, New Zealand. He was a pioneer in the establishment of classical music in New Zealand.
Biography.
Early years in Italy.
Raffaello Squarise was born in Vicenza, Italy, where his father, Antonio Squarise, worked as a sculptor. He attended the Istituto Musicale, Turin, for six years, studying violin under Francesco Bianchi and Pietro Bertuzzi, and composition under Carlo Pedrotti. Around this time he played in the orchestra of the Teatro Regio. Squarise graduated in 1875, completing a miniature "Symphony in C Minor" for his final examination. On returning to Vicenza he completed further study under Francesco Canneti. He afterwards served as military bandmaster at Contarina and municipal bandmaster at Arzignano.
Australian years.
Squarise left Italy for Australia in 1882, arriving in Melbourne in August that year. He spent much of the next year as a violinist in the touring opera orchestras of the Williamson, Garner and Musgrove Company, and the Cagli and Paoli Opera Company. He arrived in Adelaide in July 1883 with Heywood's Minstrel Troupe and decided to settle in the city. He established a performing and teaching partnership with fellow Italian Faustino Ziliani and featured in many local concerts.
Squarise established 'Squarise's Band' and this led to the formation of the South Australian Militia Band in 1886, with Squarise appointed Lieutenant Bandmaster. The band enjoyed the patronage of Governor William Robinson, and Squarise's violin pupils included Robinson's daughter. Squarise was associated with the Adelaide String Quartet Club, St. Francis Xavier's Cathedral, and various local music societies. His compositions during this period included a polka for the opening of the Adelaide Arcade, a funeral march in memory of Wilhelm I of Germany, and battle fantasia "The Battle of Sedan". A proposed opera, "The Magic Dice", did not come to fruition.
In 1887 Squarise married Camille Villanis (née Chapuis), the Swiss widow of an Italian vigneron, at the residence of Adolph Marvale in Norwood.
New Zealand years.
Squarise arrived in Dunedin, New Zealand, in September 1889 to take up the position of leader of the orchestra of the New Zealand and South Seas Exhibition. He featured as a soloist and his "Symphony in C Minor" was performed on several occasions. He was also one of the judges at exhibition's brass band contest
The exhibition concluded in May 1890 and Squarise decided to settle in Dunedin. That year he established the Otago Conservatorio of Music in association with the German pianist Arthur Barmeyer. During the next several years Squarise also organised chamber concerts, served as conductor of the Dunedin Engineers' Band and Dunedin Garrison Band, and established the Dunedin Citizens' Band. He was conductor of the Dunedin Liedertafel and briefly choirmaster at St. Joseph's Cathedral.
Some of Squarise's piano compositions were published during the 1890s and in 1894 he composed a comic opera, "Fabian", to a libretto by Donald Cargill. "Fabian's" ten-night season was a critical and popular success, but Squarise did not compose any further operas.
In 1904 Squarise formed the Dunedin Philharmonic Society, an amateur orchestra of fifty to seventy players. The string players were all his own pupils. The society performed the New Zealand premieres of many orchestral works, including Tchaikovsky's "Symphony Pathetique" (1905). It frequently featured Squarise's own compositions, including his "Symphony in C Minor", numerous marches, and the patriotic battle fantasia "Military Caprice" (1914). Squarise continued to conduct the orchestra until it was disbanded in 1933.
In 1905 Squarise was elected President of the Otago Society of Musicians, a position he held for eight years.
Squarise retired from public life in July 1933, at the age of 76. The complimentary concert held to mark the occasion was also the final concert of the Dunedin Philharmonic Society. Squarise's wife Camille died in 1941, and Squarise eventually moved to Roxburgh, Central Otago, to live with friends. He died there on 15 April 1945.

On 5 October 2009, Alexander died while on tour in Luleå, Sweden, due to a pulmonary embolism, a blood clot on the lungs. Evile unveiled a memorial site to Alexander on 25 October 2009.
Biography.
Alexander was born in London, England. In 2000, after Matt Drake and Ben Carter formed a Metallica cover band, Alexander saw an advertisement in a local guitar store for a "metal bassist". After calling Drake and rehearsing with the group, the band (then including Drake's brother Ol Drake) asked Alexander to join.
In 2004, they formed Evile. They recorded an EP "All Hallows Eve" in 2004 and a demo "Hell Demo" in 2006.

Enver Mamedov

Enver Nazim oglu Mammadov (Azerbaijani: "Ənvər Məmməd oğlu Məmmədov"; born 15 August 1923 in Baku, Azerbaijan), is a former Soviet diplomat and a mass media manager. During his career, spent mostly in Russia and the West, he was primarily known under the Russianized form of his name, Enver Nazimovich Mamedov (), or just Enver Mamedov.
Early life.
Enver Mammadov's mother's maiden name was Ivanov, and he occasionally used it as his pen name during his media career.
After graduating from high school in Baku, Azerbaijan with the "excellent" grades in all subjects (including the Azerbaijani and German languages), in June 1941, Enver Mammadov joined a fighter pilot school. After Hitler's invasion of the USSR in 1941, Enver asked to be sent to the front line, but was instead sent to be trained as a military translator at a GRU school.
After seeing some action first as a Sr. Sergeant, later as a Sr. Lieutenant, at the Soviet Union's Caucasus Front, Mammadov was sent to work with the USSR Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, where he was posted to the Soviet embassy in Italy as the press secretary. According to Mammadov himself, he was probably selected to that position because he spoke Italian, in addition to German, English, and French.
After the end of the war, Mammadov participated in the Nuremberg Trials, as one of the handlers of the Soviet prosecutors' star witness, Field Marshal Friedrich Paulus.
The nation's publicist.
Since ca. 1950, and for the rest of his life, Mammadov was working in Soviet mass media. In 1950–56 he was one of the officials in charge of the Soviet radio broadcasting to the UK, US, and Latin America.
In the late 1950s, Mammadov edited the "USSR" magazine: a Soviet English-language journal for the US audience – the Soviet counterpart of the "Amerika" magazine, – and visited the US on a number of public relations missions.
Enver Mammadov was appointed the Deputy Chairman of the State Committee for Radio and Television in 1962, and occupied this post from the late days of Nikita Khrushchev administration and throughout the Leonid Brezhnev era. Together with Alexander Yakovlev, he is credited with the creation in August 1964 of Radio Mayak, a national news and music radio broadcasting channel meant to compete with the Western radio stations broadcasting to Russia. From 1970 to 1985 he was directly in charge of Soviet television, being second in command to the Gosteleradio chief
Sergey Lapin.
At the time of his 85th birthday in 2008, Enver Mammadov still was an adviser to the Director General of RIA Novosti.
Family.
Enver Mammadov's son, Georgiy Enver oglu Mammadov, is a Russian diplomat, currently serving as Russia's ambassador in Canada.

He was sent a prisoner to the Gatehouse in London, but in the autumn of 1598 was helped to escape by his brother, Nicholas Tichborne, and Thomas Hackshot, who were both executed shortly afterwards. Betrayed by Atkinson, an apostate priest, he was re-arrested and on 17 April 1602, was brought to trial with Robert Watkinson (a young Yorkshire man who had been educated at Rome and ordained priest at Douai a month before) and James Duckett, a London bookseller. On 20 April he was executed with Watkinson and Francis Page, S.J. The last named was a convert, of a Middlesex family though born in Antwerp.

William H. McRaven

William Harry McRaven (born November 6, 1955) is a United States Navy admiral, and Commander, U.S. Special Operations Command, since August 8, 2011. He previously served from June 13, 2008 to August 2011 as Commander, Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) and from June 2006 to March 2008 as Commander, Special Operations Command Europe (SOCEUR). In addition to his duties as COMSOCEUR, he was designated as the first director of the NATO Special Operations Forces Coordination Centre (NSCC), where he was charged with enhancing the capabilities and inter-operability of all NATO Special Operations Forces.
Early life and education.
McRaven was born in Pinehurst, North Carolina, and spent most of his formative years in San Antonio, Texas, where he graduated from Roosevelt High School. He is the son of the late Col. Claude "Mac"
McRaven, World War II pilot who played briefly in the NFL. McRaven attended the University of Texas at Austin on a track scholarship, and was a member of the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps. He graduated in 1977 with a bachelor's degree in journalism. McRaven holds a master’s degree from the Naval Postgraduate School, where he helped establish and was the first graduate from the special operations/Low intensity conflict curriculum.
In 2012, McRaven—along with former First Lady Laura Bush, Charles Matthews, Melinda Perrin, Julius Glickman and Hector Ruiz—was named a Distinguished Alumnus of the University of Texas.
Career.
Special operations.
McRaven has commanded at every level within the special operations community, including assignments as deputy commander for operations at JSOC, Commodore of Naval Special Warfare Group 1, Commander of SEAL Team 3, task group commander in the CENTCOM area of responsibility, task unit commander during the Persian Gulf War, squadron commander at Naval Special Warfare Development Group, and SEAL platoon commander at Underwater Demolition Team 21/SEAL Team 4.
McRaven's thesis at the Naval Postgraduate School was titled "The Theory of Special Operations".
McRaven has also served as a staff officer with an interagency coordination focus, including as the director for Strategic Planning in the Office of Combating Terrorism on the National Security Council Staff, assessment director at U.S. Special Operations Command, on the Staff of the Chief of Naval Operations and the chief of staff at Naval Special Warfare Group 1.
On April 6, 2011, McRaven was nominated by President Barack Obama for appointment to the rank of admiral and as the ninth Commander of USSOCOM, of which JSOC is a component. In his confirmation hearings, McRaven "endorsed a steady manpower growth rate of 3% to 5% a year" and favored more resources for USSOCOM, including "additional drones and the construction of new special operations facilities." After the Armed Services committee hearings, in late June, McRaven was confirmed unanimously by the Senate for his promotion to four-star admiral and as commander of USSOCOM and took command August 8. The transfer ceremony was led by Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta in Tampa, with Admiral Olson also in attendance, two days after the Wardak Province helicopter crash which cost 30 Americans, including 22 SEALs, their lives. With several hundred in attendance, Panetta spoke of sending "a strong message of American resolve ... carry[ing on the fight."
Operation Neptune Spear.
McRaven is credited for organizing and executing Operation Neptune Spear, the special ops raid that led to the death of Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011. CIA Director Leon Panetta delegated the raid to McRaven who has worked almost exclusively on counter-terrorism operations and strategy since 2001.
According to the "New York Times", "In February, Mr. Panetta called Vice Adm. William H. McRaven, commander of the Pentagon's Joint Special Operations Command, to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, to give him details about the compound and to begin planning a military strike. Admiral McRaven, a veteran of the covert world who had written a book on American Special Operations, spent weeks working with the CIA on the operation, and came up with three options: a helicopter assault using U.S. Navy SEALs, a strike with B-2 bombers that would obliterate the compound, or a joint raid with Pakistani intelligence operatives who would be told about the mission hours before the launch." The day before the assault, President Obama "took a break from rehearsing for the White House Correspondents Dinner that night to call Admiral McRaven, to wish him luck." Years later, a June 2013 Freedom of Information request revealed that on May 13, 2011, McRaven sent email titled "OPSEC Guidance / Neptune Spear" that instructed redacted recipients that "all photos UBL's remains should have been turned over to the CIA; if you still have them destroy them immediately" or "get them to" a recipient whose identity was redacted.
In December 2011, McRaven was runner-up for Time Person of the Year for his role in the operation.
Personal life.
Admiral William McRaven is married to Georgeann Brady McRaven. They have three kids.
McRaven attended the 2012 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner as the guest of his fifth grade classmate, Karen Tumulty.

Trảng Bàng dew-wetted rice paper

Trảng Bàng dew-wetted rice paper (Vietnamese language: Bánh tráng phơi sương Trảng Bàng) is a speciality of Lộc Du, Trảng Bàng District, Tây Ninh Province, Vietnam. This is a flexible two layer- rice paper. There is a saying:
"Ai về xứ ấy Trảng Bàng," Whoever comes to that land, Trảng Bàng, 
"Mua giúp một tràng bánh tráng phơi sương". Please buy for us a bundle of dew- wetted rice paper.
Process of production.
There are seven steps in making the dish: steeping the rice, husking the rice, mixing the flour, spreading the flour, drying the rice paper in the sun, grilling the rice paper and wetting the paper by dew in the night. Commonly used rice strains are Bằng Cóc rice, So Miên rice or Nàng Miên rice. Rice is soaked in water equal to the volume of rice. If it is soaked too long, the rice will lose its fragrance. The soaked rice is mixed with salt and grilled, spread over a flat pan in a very thin round shape. When spreading, the water temperature must be kept constant. The next piece is spread over the pan just as the last piece is removed, and skilled workers time the rice paper cooking process by smelling the smoke. Next, the rice paper is spread over a bamboo grid and left to dry in the sun, and wind. If the rice paper is left to dry too long, it will be brittle, but if not left to dry long enough, it will be tough. The rice paper is then grilled over a fire of peanut shells, and the cooks turn the rice paper over regularly to prevent it from being burned or smoke-stained. When night dews begin to drop, the rice paper is left outside to be wetted by the dew; the length of time it's left outside depends on the amount of dew which falls that day.
Trảng Bàng dew-wetted rice paper summer roll.
People wrap rice paper around a range of ingredients: pork simmered in coconut water, and a variety of vegetables, such as cucumber, coriander, Thai basil, spearmint, houttuynia cordata, peppermint or perilla. People serve it with sweet and sour fish sauce.

360 Association

360 Association ("Associazione 360") is a centrist faction within the Democratic Party (PD), a political party in Italy. It is led by Enrico Letta and that is why its members are often called "Lettiani".
The association was founded during the summer of 2007 in support of the candidacy of Enrico Letta, a former Christian Democrat, to the leadership of the newly formed party and represents a centrist position within the party, as he has good relations with almost all the factions of the party, including "Veltroniani", "Rutelliani", "Dalemiani" and the Reformists and Democrats, Ulivists, of which he has been considered a member, and The Populars, of which he is currently member.
One major goals of the group is to lead the party into an alliance with the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats (UDC), while it is critical with the populist Italy of Values party, a traditional ally of the Democrats. In a meeting organized by 360 in June 2008 in Piacenza, UDC leader Pier Ferdinando Casini, explained that he could easily be member of a party alongside Letta, but not with Antonio Di Pietro's Italy of Values.
Umberto Ranieri, a former Democrat of the Left, is president of the association.
History.
Democrats for Letta.
The candidacy of Letta in the 2007 Democratic primary election was supported by the "Democrats for Letta" lists, representing the liberal component of the Ulivists, that is to say the faction which was closer to Romano Prodi, and including Paolo De Castro, Umberto Ranieri, Gianni Pittella (leader of the Italian delegation to the Party of European Socialists in the European Parliament), Renato Soru (and his Sardinia Project party), Vito De Filippo, Gian Mario Spacca, Lorenzo Dellai, Marco Stradiotto and Francesco Boccia. Soru, De Filippo, Spacca and Dellai were respectively President of Sardinia, Basilicata, Marche and Trentino, and the last three represented the more conservative and traditionally Christian-democratic faction within Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy, the party of which Letta was a leading member, while Ranieri and Pittella represented the more centrist wing of the Democrats of the Left.
The "Democrats for Letta" list won 11.0% of the vote nationally, having its strongholds in Northern Italy and in some regions of the South.
Bersani-Letta.
In June 2008 some "Lettiani" joined forces with "Dalemiani", the group around Massimo D'Alema, who himself supports the alliance with UDC and a more structured party. Paolo De Castro even became president of the new association of D'Alema, the Reformists and Democrats, while Francesco Boccia, a former Christian Democrat like Letta, announced that he, as "left-wing Catholic", has no problems with joining the Party of European Socialists, which is the main goal of "Dalemiani".
In the 2009 Democratic Party leadership election Letta and his group thus supported Pier Luigi Bersani. Soon after his election, Bersani appointed Letta as his deputy forming the so-called "Bersani-Letta" ticket.
In June 2010 the association organized a three-day meeting in Verona, during which the party, through its deputy-leader Letta, met entrepreneurs and key leaders of Lega Nord, the largest party in Veneto and eastern Lombardy. An opinion poll among northern Democrats, released during the "Nord Camp", showed that they are keener on an alliance with Lega Nord than The People of Freedom (43% vs. 30%). Letta was praised both by Roberto Maroni and Umberto Bossi.

The Very Best of Rufus Featuring Chaka Khan

The Very Best of Rufus featuring Chaka Khan is a greatest hits album by funk band Rufus (billed as 'Rufus featuring Chaka Khan'), originally released on the MCA Records label in 1982. The collection comprises ten of the group's biggest hits on the ABC/MCA labels, including "You Got the Love," "Sweet Thing". "At Midnight (My Love Will Lift You Up)", "Do You Love What You Feel", "Tell Me Something Good", "Stay", "Hollywood" and "Dance Wit Me".
"The Very Best of..." was released in late 1982, prior to the recording of the band's two final albums, both for the Warner Bros. Records label, and does consequently not include their hits "Ain't Nobody" and "One Million Kisses", both from the 1983 double-set "Stompin' at the Savoy - Live". However, it doesn't contain any material from their 1973 self-titled debut album or their recent album at the time, 1981's "Camouflage". It also doesn't contain any material from the Khan-less albums "Numbers" (1979) and "Party 'Til You're Broke" (1981).
The ten track "Very Best of Rufus featuring Chaka Khan" was re-released on CD by MCA/Geffen Records in the mid 1990s in both the US and Europe and is to date the only career retrospective available with the band. 
Rufus and Chaka Khan's ABC/MCA back catalogue (1973–1982) is as of 2003 distributed by the Universal Music Group.

Giovanni Battista Borra (27 December 1713 - November 1770) was an Italian architect, engineer and architectural draughtsman.
Life.
Borra was born in Dogliani. Studying under Bernardo Antonio Vittone from 1733 to 1736 (producing 10 plates for his teacher's "Istruzione elementari per indirizzo de'giovani allo studio dell'architettura civile", published in Lugano in 1760), in 1748 he published a work of his own. This was a handbook on buildings' stability, practical in tone. He met Robert Wood in Rome, and joined his 1750-51 antiquarian expedition to Asia Minor and Syria as its architectural draughtsman before returning with Wood to England. There he used his sketchbooks (now in the library of the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies, London) to produce the original drawings (now in the Royal Institute of British Architects) for Wood's "The Ruins of Balbec" and "The Ruins of Palmyra", and from 1752 to 1760 carried out commissions for English patrons. These works and their images led to motifs from Baalbek and Palmyra becoming fashionable for ceiling and interior decorations in England and Italy (Borra used them, for example, in his own work on the south facade of the Palazzo Isnardi and the interior decoration of its Sala d'Ercole and Sala di Diana, on the piano nobile). He is thought to have died in Turin.

List of Slipknot band members

Slipknot is a heavy metal band formed by vocalist and percussionist Anders Colsefni, guitarists Donnie Steele and Josh "Gnar" Brainard, bassist Paul Gray, drummer Joey Jordison and percussionist Shawn Crahan, in Des Moines, Iowa. Since its inception in 1995, the band has gone through multiple lineup changes, many occurring before the release of its debut album "Slipknot", in 1999. The band is known for its large lineup, which consists of nine members, including a vocalist, two guitarists, a bassist, a primary drummer and two additional percussionists, a sampler, and a turntablist.
In 1996, during the mixing stage of the band's demo album "Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat.", Slipknot saw its first lineup change when guitarist Donnie Steele left the band and was replaced by Craig Jones. Shortly after, drummer Jordison suggested they would need a full-time sampler and Jones fit the position as "he liked doing that anyway." Mick Thomson was brought in to fill the open position on guitar. After the release of "Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat." the band members were working on new material which required more vocal melody and vocalist Colsefni struggled with this. In 1997, Corey Taylor was recruited from local band Stone Sour and after practicing with Slipknot "everything just clicked." As a result, Colsefni was moved to backing vocals and percussion. However, Colsefni became unhappy with his new role and left the band a month later.
Wanting to retain their percussive edge, the band chose Greg Welts as Colsefni's replacement. Towards the end of 1997, each member chose a number as his alias. Slipknot considered including a DJ in their lineup, but had difficulty finding one because "the people knew who were DJs all sucked!" Sid Wilson approached the band after seeing them live. He proceeded to impress the band with his ability and his antics, especially his crowd surfing skills.; Wilson was considered "Slipknot material" and his hiring brought the lineup to nine members. In 1998, Welts was asked to leave the band and was replaced by Brandon Darner, who, in turn, didn't stay for long and was replaced by Chris Fehn. The final change in the lineup came in the latter stages of the recording of the band's debut album, "Slipknot", in 1999; during a break in recording, Brainard decided to leave the band and was replaced by Jim Root.
This lineup remained unchanged until May 2010, when bassist Paul Gray was discovered dead in a hotel room near his Iowa home. On June 21, the cause of his death was confirmed as an accidental overdose of morphine and fentanyl, a synthetic morphine substitute. The band toured in the summer of 2011 with former guitarist Donnie Steele filling in for Gray. In December 2013, during writing for the band's fifth album, original drummer Joey Jordison left the band, reportedly for "personal reasons", leaving Shawn Crahan as the only remaining original member of Slipknot.

Northfield House, East Lothian

Northfield House is a seventeenth-century historic house at Preston, East Lothian, Scotland, UK. It is situated very close to Hamilton House and Preston Tower, and one mile east to Prestongrange House and the Royal Musselburgh Golf Club.
This L-plan house was built for the Hamiltons of Preston (who occupied nearby Preston Tower) in the late 16th century and was sold to Joseph Marjoribanks, a burgess of Edinburgh in 1607. He and his wife Marion Symesoune enlarged and embellished the house, the completion of the work being commemorated by the magnificent door on the south side of the house which incorporates the date 1611 and the motto (in Scots) "Excep the Lord Buld Inwane Bulds Man" and the Marjoribanks and Symesoune arms. The house was occupied for most of the 17th century by the Marjoribanks family, and was eventually sold around the year 1700. In 1746 it was owned by a surgeon named A. Nesbit, and later by James Syme, a slater, whose son, a Royal Navy Captain, later sold it in 1896 to James McNeill a mining engineer from Wishaw who had acquired the estate to work the coal.
In 1954 the architect W. Schomberg Scott bought Northfield House with its walled garden of about 2 acres from Miss McNeill, James McNeill's daughter. Miss McNeill sold off the remainder of the estate for development over the ensuing years with the result that the house is now surrounded by 19th and 20th century development of mixed quality and the old home farm buildings are converted into dwellings. By 1999 the house and garden were in serious disrepair and in late 1999 the trustees of Mr & Mrs Scott's contract of marriage trust sold it to Finlay Lockie who has been restoring both house and garden gradually since. Finlay Lockie gave a tour of the House on BBC Two's "Castle in the Country", season 4, episode 9 (part of the Floors Castle series), first broadcast on July 23, 2008.
Apart from a brief period between the death of Schomberg Scott and acquisition of the house by Finlay Lockie, the house has been continuously occupied as a private house. It has never belonged to East Lothian Council, though the Council was concerned as to its future when it was empty and has been supportive of Mr Lockie's restoration efforts. The National Trust for Scotland did at one time consider making the house into a museum of painted ceilings - the house has several fine ceilings (beam and board painted in floral patterns and arabesques in egg tempura) in good, unrestored condition, but this plan never came to fruition. The Trust does have a continuing interest in the future of the house.
In the former grounds of Northfield House stands an 16th-century beehive doocot (Scots for dovecot). There are also some interesting garden features including brick-lined walls (18th and 19th century) and a mock bartizan accessible by a stone stair within the garden.

The Waiting Game (game show)

The Waiting Game was a Saturday night game show that aired on BBC One from 17 November 2001 to 15 June 2002 and it was hosted by Ruby Wax.
Gameplay.
Round 1.
Three teams of two start the game. One player from each team is at the buzzers; the other player stands behind them. Ruby asks a total of 8 questions during the first round. Once she finishes the question, a 10-second timer starts, increasing the point value of the question the longer the teams wait to buzz in; the question's value starts at 1 point, and increases to 3, 5, 8, 12, and finally 15 points just before time expires. When a player buzzes in, his/her partner must give the answer without conferring. A correct answer wins the points; a wrong answer or no answer awards the points to both of the other teams; for the last 3 questions of the round, an incorrect/no answer awards 15 points to the opposing teams regardless of the points on the timer. At the end of the first round, the team with the lowest score is eliminated. If, on the last question, the last-place team buzzes in too early to be able to catch up, they are eliminated without being permitted to answer the question.
Round 2.
The two remaining teams' scores are reset to zero. Game play is the same as round 1, except that the partners switch places, and only 6 questions are available. Just as in round 1, for the last 3 questions, an incorrect answer awards 15 points to the other team. At the end of this round, the winning team plays the bonus round.
Bonus Round.
The partners are isolated from one another. The goal is now to answer a total of 6 questions correctly within 60 seconds; the round is timed to 1/100 of a second. This 60 seconds is thinking time only; it only runs after Ruby asks a question, and stops whenever either partner buzzes in. The partners now buzz in to answer themselves. The amount of money for the question increases each second, as follows:
As before, no conferring is allowed. An incorrect answer/pass wastes the time used on that question, as does allowing 10 seconds to elapse on the question.
If the team answers 6 questions correctly before time expires, they win all of the money accumulated, otherwise, they leave with nothing.

<doc id="18263267" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18263267" title="The Great Favourite">
The Great Favourite

The Great Favourite, or the Duke of Lerma is a stage play written by Sir Robert Howard, a historical drama based on the life of Francisco Goméz de Sandoval y Rojas, Duke of Lerma, the favourite of King Philip III of Spain. The play has often been considered Howard's best dramatic work, as well as a step in the development of the heroic drama of the Restoration era.
Performance and publication.
The play was premiered onstage on 20 February 1668, acted by the King's Company at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. Nell Gwyn played Lerma's daughter Maria. Samuel Pepys saw the play in the company of King Charles II and his court at its first performance, as he recorded in his Diary. (Pepys interpreted the play as a veiled criticism of Charles's conduct with his mistress, and wrote that he had expected the King to interrupt the performance — though this did not occur.)
The play was published in a quarto edition that same year by Henry Herringman, and printed again in a folio collection of Howard's works in 1692.
Authorship.
In his Preface to the 1668 edition, Howard states that the King's Company had possessed an old play on the subject of the Duke of Lerma — an "unfit" thing that was yet "written with higher Style and Thoughts than I could attain to." Howard reworked the old play, "altering the most part of the Characters, and the whole Design..." Alfred Harbage has argued that this old play was a lost work by John Ford, based on resemblances between "The Great Favourite" and Ford's distinctive drama. Other scholars have suggested that the old play reworked by Howard was "The Spanish Duke of Lerma", a lost drama by Henry Shirley that was entered into the Stationers' Register on September 9, 1653, but never published.
"The Great Favourite" is written in a mixture of blank verse and rhymed verse. Rhyme was coming to be the dominant fashion in the heroic drama of the Restoration, while the earlier Caroline drama of Ford and Shirley and their contemporaries had favoured blank verse. The two contrasting styles within "The Great Favourite" may yield some insight into the extent of Howard's rewrite versus the surviving portions of the original text.
Dryden.
Howard's brother-in-law John Dryden composed the play's verse Prologue, spoken in the theatre. Though Howard and Dryden were colleagues and occasional collaborators (on "The Indian Queen" of 1664), they also had a brief controversy about the use of rhyme and the role of public taste in drama. Their dispute was played out in their writings of the later 1660s, especially Dryden's "Essay of Dramatick Poesie" and the Preface to "The Great Favourite".
The plot.
Howard depicts Lerma as "a Renaissance Overreacher, a Grand Machiavel characterized by enormous ambition, unscrupulousness, and magniloquence." The Duke is a cynical and blasphemous manipulator who promotes his own followers and opposes the established nobility; he is willing to prostitute his daughter Maria to gain influence over the young prince Philip; he even plots the murder of the Queen Mother. The ageing King Philip II moves to restrain Lerma and even banishes him; but then the old king dies, and Lerma ascends in power with the new reign of Philip III. In time, Lerma appears to go too far; the virtuous members of the court, including the Duke of Alva and Lerma's brother the Duke of Medina, re-assert themselves, and it seems that Lerma will endure the conventional fall from grace of his character type. Yet Lerma escapes this expected fall in the final act, by purchasing a cardinal's office from a corrupt Papacy.
Interpretation.
Seventeenth-century readers and audiences were adept at drawing socio-political implications from works of literature and drama (as with the example of Pepys, cited above). Howard's portrayal of the Duke of Lerma was seen by contemporaries as a critique of the Earl of Clarendon, formerly Charles's Lord Chancellor and close confidante. Howard was associated with the "country party" that was then evolving in opposition to Court interests in the English political scene of the day. (Since Clarendon had, by 1668, already fallen from favour — he had been impeached by the House of Commons and fled to France the previous year — Howard's perceived criticism was far less risky than it would have been a few years earlier.)

Task loading

Task loading in scuba diving is a term used to refer to a multiplicity of responsibilities leading to an increased risk of failure on the part of the diver to undertake some key basic function which would normally be routine for safety underwater.
Common examples.
Common examples of activities which can cause task loading are:
Task loading represents an elevated risk when a new activity is undertaken by an inexperienced diver. A diver learning how to use a drysuit, or starting underwater photography, will need to dedicate considerably more attention to the proper functioning of the new and unfamiliar piece of equipment which leads to the elevated risk of neglect of other responsibilities. Those risks will normally diminish with experience.
Common examples of routine functions that can be overlooked as a result of task loading are:
Task loading is often identified as a key component in diving accidents, although statistically it is difficult to monitor because divers of differing levels of experience can cope with a more complex array of tasks and equipment. Whilst simply getting used to using a drysuit can call for great levels of attention in an inexperienced diver, it would be a routine piece of equipment for an experienced technical diver to use, whilst carrying a camera and also penetrating a cave or wreck at depth or using a DPV.

Donald Pomerleau

Donald D. Pomerleau (August 31, 1915 – January 19, 1992) was the City Police Commissioner of Baltimore, Maryland from 1966 to 1981.
Background.
Pomerleau was born on a ranch near Medicine Lake, Montana, with an unusual western, rural upbringing for a future big-city police supervisor.
After graduating from high school in Whitehall, Montana in 1933, Pomerleau joined the Marines and served in China from 1934 to 1937. He was discharged honorably from the Marines as a sergeant in 1938. After his discharge, Pomerleau worked for a construction company in Nevada, and then for the U. S. Border Patrol in California and Arizona. In 1942, after World War II began, he re-enlisted and served in the Military Police Corps of the United States Army. Pomerleau served in the Guadalcanal Campaign, the Battle of Tarawa, the Battle of Saipan, and Battle of Tinian. Pomerleau was discharged in 1945.
During the Korean War, Pomerleau served as a combat commander. He served as provost marshal at the Marine Corps School and University, retiring in 1958 with the rank of lieutenant colonel.
Pomerleau became the Director of Public Safety in Kingsport, Tennessee. He assumed a similar position later in 1962 in the City of Miami-Dade County. But he was not well-respected or liked by the Miami-Dade County police force, and generally could not get his way or institute his programs and policies.
By 1964, he became a consultant for the Baltimore City Police Department sent by the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP). The IACP then also sent Pomerleau in 1965 to investigate Baltimore during the heat of the earlier years of the civil rights movement, with rising fears of civil unrest in the wake of the Watts Riots in Los Angeles that year. Pomerleau declared that "the Baltimore City Police Department was amongst the nation's most antiquated and corrupt police forces which had practiced excessive force and had a non-existent relationship with Baltimore's large Negro (then Black, later African American) community". To improve the Department and try to prevent future racial rioting, Maryland's 54th Governor, J. Millard Tawes, (1894-1979), 1959-1967, an Eastern Shore Democrat, whose Office had for a century, before the American Civil War, held the appointive power to select Baltimore City's Commissioner of Police and in consultation with Baltimore's then progressive Republican Mayor (and former 1950s Governor himself), Theodore R. McKeldin, (1900-1974), and 42nd Mayor, served 1943-1947, 1963-1967. So they then hired Pomerleau the following year of 1966 with a mandate and charge to "clean up" the Department. It seemed however that the new Commissioner came with a seemingly more liberal and progressive attitude towards race relations, urban poverty and crime and many observors and scholars feel that he gradually turned more conservative and even autocratic as his tenure wore on and the number of incidents of nation-wide civil strife skyrocketed from issues of integration, civil rights, poverty as unemployment and economic money inflation began to spiral out of control and continued to worsen throughout the 1960', so that by the time of the conservative Republican presidency of Richard M. Nixon in the 1970s, Pomerleau's attitudes and policies reflected much more the attitude of the infamous "silent majority" espoused by Nixon, his Vice President Spiro T. Agnew (and also former 55th state Governor, 1967-1969, earlier suburbia's 3rd Baltimore County Executive, 1962-1966), and even conservative/reactionary national spokesmen like Alabama Governor George C. Wallace, with his perennial presidential campaigns during the era and the election of Republican Gov. Ronald W. Reagan, becoming an instant star in California during his 1966 election. This is what opinions Pomerleau soon espoused, rather than the Democratic Party idealism, liberalism and progressives that men like Governor Tawes and Mayor McKeldin expected.
The new police commissioner moved to the City and lived at 4009 Keswick Road (off University Parkway) in the southern lower neighborhood of Roland Park in North Baltimore.
Impact on the police force.
Soon after his appointment, Pomerleau made it easier for people to join the force, decreasing vacancies from 418 to 370 within six months. His first budget proposal included higher salaries and bigger pensions for patrolmen/officers, new vehicles (with a re-designed "friendlier" blue and white paint scheme, to replace the long-time traditional "black and whites"), setting up of an analysis center, additional money for recruitment, and a school for continuous training of officers, following up on the police academy. He quickly equipped police with mace, helmets, walkie-talkies, and more vehicles with radio-contact communications and body radios for officers, phasing out the old green "call boxes" on a post, dotting city streets, after securing a $48 million budget from the City — an increase of $15 million over a three year span.
Operations.
Pomerleau was a believer in a military hierarchy and created a strict chain of command. He also introduced new riot control tactics: for example, distinguishing 'offensive' weapons ('chemical agents such as tear gas') from defensive weapons (nightstick, revolver).
African Americans.
Pomerleau immediately recognized racial tension as a major challenge for the BCPD. Soon after his appointment, he asked officers to take crash courses in Black (now African-American) history.
Pomerleau also lifted remaining job restrictions on African American officers from when the Department first tentatively recruited a limited number of "Colored" patrolmen in the 1930s, who were previously limited to foot patrols, quarantined in rank, barred from patrolling in "White" neighborhoods, and given limited specialty assignments. However, the percentage number of blacks on the force, and particularly the number of black promotions, remained low, during Pomerleau's tenure and only began to rise dramatically by the 1980s.
Spying.
Inspectional Services Division.
Immediately after his appointment, Pomerleau created the "Inspectional Services Division" (ISD), an agency responsible for "active surveillance of individuals or groups outside the normal criminal behavior". Over the next 10 years, the ISD spied on nation-wide plus local affiliates of organizations like the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Friends Service Committee, and the Black Panther Party. Interestingly, this activity sort of pre-dated by thirty years, the same intensive decade-long build-up of similar tactics, spying and even foreign intelligence-gathering by officers and units of the New York City Police Department (NYPD) under Commissioner Raymond Kelly, following the massive terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan during the infamous "9/11" of September 11, 2001, with the deaths of over 2,000 Americans, both in the skyscrapers that fell and the two airliner planes that hit them. Continued to be extremely controversial, first under the Republican presidential administration of George W. Bush and even under the more liberal Democratic administrations of successor President Barack Obama, by Kelly's retirement and interviews by 2013
Outside reports.
Year after year from 1971 to 1978, Representative Parren Mitchell (from the 7th Congressional District) called for Pomerleau's resignation because of alleged spying (and even possible harassment) on black-oriented organizations and associations especially those involved in the growing anti-Vietnam War movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s.
He was also accused of spying on and harassing members of Police Local 1195 for the purpose of union-busting.
In 1976, The Maryland Senate issued a report stating that Pomerleau had used illegal spying methods, including wiretapping, surveillance, and illicit acquisition of credit reports. Pomerleau said he had done nothing illegal and that any spying was a necessary countermeasure against 'subversive elements' in the Department.
Journalists reported that Pomerleau had intimidated them using information from his spy network. Michael Olesker of the "Baltimore Sun" described meeting Pomerleau in the mid 1970s: "'Listen,' he said, 'I know where you've been, I know who you've talked to, and I know what you've been told.'" And he did."
Praise and criticism.
Pomerleau received constant support and praise from Mayor Schaefer and Governor Mandel.
In 1976, Pomerleau was the Advertising Club of Baltimore's "Man of the Year".
Post-police commissioner career.
Pomerleau was one of the longest serving police commissioners of Baltimore holding that post for a period of 15 years, the longest tenure since Charles Gaither who held the first posting of the newly created Office of Commissioner of Police at the last major re-organization and structuring of the BCPD from 1920–1937.
Baltimore's Best Security.
Pomerleau retired from the Baltimore City Police Department in September 1981.
In October 1981, Commissioner Pomerleau was hired by the Abacus Corporation, a nation-wide private security and guard force agency which then received an expanded contract with the city and established "Abacus Security Services".
The following month of November, Pomerleau created a private firm called "Baltimore's Best Security". This firm was to create special quasi-private police force for maintaining security of public buildings. Members of this force would have more authority than those of ordinary private firms; however, they would not be subject to city personnel regulations. The creation of the company—and its immediate endorsement and announcement of a no-bid contract by Mayor Schaefer—provoked an outcry from Baltimoreans, who called it expensive and unaccountable and feared that it would be favored over some of the city's preexisting black-owned firms.
The City Council, in late 1981, led by President Walter Orlinsky, accused Pomerleau and Schaefer of attempting to establish a "shadow government". The Council attempted to pass rules that would restrict the role of quasi-private agencies in city governance. This was the beginning of a 30-year controversy involving the use of a massive "slush fund" treasury, issuance of city-backed bonds for various "civic improvement" and commercial/residential "urban renewal" by a newly created public-private agency, the Baltimore Development Corporation and its powerful Trustees, which continued the major re-development of the "Inner Harbor" area where previous city agencies from the 1950s to 1970s left off, and soon expanded its reach and influence among its projects throughout the City. The controversies endured through six more mayoral administrations up to 2013, upon the retirement of long-time BDC head, M. Jay Brodie. It even became a matter for local humor as one time at an event, Mayor William Donald Schaefer, showed up with a long black cape draped and curled around his body and arm, topped by a black slouch fedora hat of the 1940s detective-style novels and cartoons or the old prime-time radio drama "The Shadow" with character "Lamont Cranston". Newspaper photographs flew around the Nation! "Baltimore's Best Security" was not heard from again; however, Abacus continued to receive no-bid city contracts.
Pomerleau died of cancer at his new retirement home in Edwardsville, Virginia.

Cry Now, Laugh Later

"Cry Now, Laugh Later" is a song by Grace Jones from her 1982 album "Living My Life".
Background.
The single was released in the U.S. and Canada only, simultaneously with "My Jamaican Guy" which was aimed at the European, Asian and Australian market. The 12" remix of the track, by Steven Stanley, is especially notable in the Grace Jones discography as it differs substantially from the album version. It more or less only retains the lead and backing vocals from the original and has new overdubs of drums, bass and keyboards - and a different chord progression on the choruses. In the UK the Steven Stanley remix of "Cry Now, Laugh Later" was released as the B-side of the "My Jamaican Guy" 12" single. Both the 12" remix and the 12" dub of "Cry Now, Laugh Later" remain unreleased on CD.

James Dawkins (antiquarian)

James Dawkins (1722, Jamaica – 6 September 1757, Sutton's Plantation, Jamaica) was a British antiquarian and Jacobite.
Life.
He was the eldest of four sons born to Henry Dawkins (1698–1744), who was also a wealthy sugar planter of Clarendon, Jamaica, and his wife, Elizabeth (1697?–1757, third daughter of Edward Pennant of Clarendon, chief justice of the island). He went to England for his education, attending Abingdon School (then headed by the Tory Thomas Woods) and matriculating at St John's College, Oxford on 7 December 1739 before graduating DCL in 1749. He then embarked on a continental Grand Tour to Paris then Rome, meeting more Jacobite sympathisers along with the experienced traveller Robert Wood. On 5 May 1750, Wood, Dawkins, Dawkins' Oxford friend John Bouverie and the Italian draughtsman Giovanni Borra set off from Naples in the "Matilda" to tour and study the Aegean, the coast of Asia Minor, Egypt, Nazareth, Syria (including the ruins of Palmyra and Baalbek), Tripoli and Cyprus, returning in Naples on 7 June 1751. Borra, Wood and Dawkins returned to England, where Dawkins funded Wood's publication of as well as that of James Stuart and Nicholas Revett's "The Antiquities of Athens" (it was on Stuart's suggestion that, in 1755, Dawkins was elected to the Society of Dilettanti).
In May 1753 Dawkins travelled to Berlin to meet Frederick the Great, in an inconclusive attempt to gain his support for a Jacobite conspiracy by William King of Oxford, the earl of Westmorland, and the Prussian ambassador Earl Marischal. The British government issued a warrant for Dawkins's arrest in retaliation, but it was not put into effect when he returned to England in 1754. Once back, he bought an estate in Laverstoke and was elected MP for the open borough of Hindon. He also owned, with his brother, the Sutton's Plantation in Jamaica.
The anonymous 1756 pamphlet, "Reflections physical and moral upon the … numerous phenomena … which have happened from the earthquake at Lima", attributed to Dawkins, shows his philosophy to have been opposed to that of Descartes and Isaac Newton. On his death in Jamaica in 1757, unmarried, he was buried in Old Plantation, Clarendon before he and his parents' remains were reburied in St Paul's Church, Chapelton, Jamaica when the family estates were sold in 1922.

Locally normal space

In mathematics, particularly topology, a topological space "X" is locally normal if intuitively it looks locally like a normal space. More precisely, a locally normal space satisfies the property that each point of the space belongs to a neighbourhood of the space that is normal under the subspace topology. 
Formal definition.
A topological space "X" is said to be locally normal if and only if each point, "x", of "X" has a neighbourhood that is normal under the subspace topology.
Note that not every neighbourhood of "x" has to be normal, but at least one neighbourhood of "x" has to be normal (under the subspace topology).
Note however, that if a space were called locally normal if and only if each point of the space belonged to a subset of the space that was normal under the subspace topology, then every topological space would be locally normal. This is because, the singleton {"x"} is vacuously normal and contains "x". Therefore, the definition is more restrictive.
Theorems.
Theorem 1
If "X" is homeomorphic to "Y" and "X" is locally normal, then so is "Y".
Proof
This follows from the fact that the image of a normal space under a homeomorphism is always normal.

Locally regular space

In mathematics, particularly topology, a topological space "X" is locally regular if intuitively it looks locally like a regular space. More precisely, a locally regular space satisfies the property that each point of the space belongs to an open subset of the space that is regular under the subspace topology. 
Formal definition.
A topological space "X" is said to be locally regular if and only if each point, "x", of "X" has a neighbourhood that is regular under the subspace topology. Equivalently, a space "X" is locally regular if and only if the collection of all open sets that are regular under the subspace topology forms a base for the topology on "X".

Environmental Technology Verification Program

The Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) Program of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the United States develops testing protocols and verifies the performance of innovative environmental technologies that can address problems that threaten human health or the natural environment. ETV was created to accelerate the entrance of new environmental technologies into the domestic and international marketplace by providing objective technology information on commercial ready technologies. ETV is a voluntary program. Developers/vendors of environmental technologies are not required to participate in the program, nor are they required to seek verification. ETV does not pass or fail and does not rank technologies. All verification reports and statements are made publicly available on the ETV Web site.
Centers.
ETV has five centers which are called verification organizations. These verification centers are run through a cooperative agreement
Advanced Monitoring Systems Center.
The center verifies the performance of commercial-ready technologies that monitor contaminants and natural species in air, water, and soil. The center tests both field-portable and stationary monitors, as well as innovative technologies that can be used to describe the environment (site characterization).
Air Pollution Control Technology Center.
This center verifies commercial-ready technologies that control stationary and mobile air pollution sources, and mitigate the effects of indoor air pollutants.
Drinking Water Systems Center.
This center verifies the performance of commercial-ready drinking water treatment systems for use in small communities, or individual homes and businesses.
Greenhouse Gas Technology Center.
This center verifies the performance of commercial-ready technologies that produce, mitigate, monitor, or sequester greenhouse gas emissions.
Water Quality Protection Center.
This center verifies the performance of commercial-ready technologies that protect groundwater and surface waters from contamination.
Environmental and Sustainable Technology Technology Verifications (ESTE).
A component of ETV which was added in 2005 to address priority environmental technology categories for meeting the USEPA needs for credible performance information. Priority is given to technologies that can address high-risk environmental problems. 
Other topical efforts are listed below.
ETV Accomplishments, Impacts, and Outcomes.
ETV has verified over 400 technologies and developed more than 90 protocols. A survey of participating vendors completed in 2001 showed overwhelming support for the ETV program. Responses indicated that 73 percent of the vendors were using ETV information in product marketing, and 92 percent of those surveyed responded that they would recommend ETV to other vendors.
In 2006, EPA published a two-volume set of case studies which document actual and projected outcomes from verifications of technologies in 15 technology categories (ETV Program Case Studies Vol 1 EPA/600/R-06/001 and ETV Program Case Studies Vol II EPA/600/R-06/082).
An Association of State Drinking Water Administrators (ASDWA) survey showed that 34 states recognize and use ETV reports. ASDWA and its members rely heavily on these evaluations to support the use of new technologies and products in the drinking water industry.
Designating a product or technology as ETV “verified” does not mean a given technology reduces every emission, has no drawbacks, or outperforms solutions "not" on the “verified” list.
Designating a product or technology as “verified” means that a given technology produced “X” outcome, when tested according to a specific protocol.
Verified diesel emission reduction technologies and their outcomes.
of 5% during "line haul duty", but the % of error was + / - 4%, and under the heaviest load, there was no reading given for fuel consumption reduction. The Envirofuels verification report indicates that TPM increased as little as 40%, and as much as 170%. Envirofuels Diesel Fuel Catalyzer, while "verified', actually increased TPM emissions, and showed what amounts to an inconclusive result for fuel use reduction.
Composition of total diesel particulate matter and the relation to smoke opacity.
The composition of TPM (total diesel particulate matter) is the sum of "dry" particulates,and "wet" particulates.
"Dry" Particulate emissions are also known as inorganic soot, black carbon, or elemental carbon.
"Wet" particulates are also known as organic carbon, soluble organic fractions ( SOF's)and volatile organic carbon ( VOC's).
The exact ratio of "wet to dry" diesel particulate matter will vary by engine load, duty cycle, fuel composition and specification,and engine tuning. 
An opacity reading is a measurement of the level of "visible" inorganic carbon, also known as soot. Opacity measurements cannot detect organic carbon emissions, VOC / SOF emissions, or NOx emissions. 
Specialized instrumentation is required to determine organic carbon levels,and to detect other unseen particulates. When used in conjunction with an opacity meter, the technician can detect ( for example) an increase in TPM, and detect a decrease in visible smoke ( opacity ) emissions.
Function as a neutral clearinghouse.
The ETV verification program ( and other verification pathways )publish the verification reports, technology options charts, and technical summaries, once testing has been completed.
The ETV testing facility will issue press releases on behalf of the technology vendor, upon completion of testing.
The ETV verification program reports all outcomes, and leaves the ultimate decision regarding the suitability and applicability of a given technology to the discretion of the end user. Additional research may be necessary in order to adequately address specific situations.
Disclaimers.
"By “verify,” ETV means to establish the performance of a technology (i.e., confirm, corroborate, substantiate, validate). ETV verification does not imply approval, certification, or designation by EPA, but rather provides a quantitative assessment of the performance of a technology under specific, predetermined criteria or protocols and adequate data quality assurance procedures."
"The ( VDRP) Verification Program evaluates technologies to support their use in the market while providing customers with confidence that verified technologies will provide emission reductions as listed. This Verification process evaluates the emission reduction performance of retrofit technologies, including their durability, and identifies engine operating criteria and conditions that must exist for these technologies to achieve those reductions."
"Mention of commercial product names does not imply endorsement or recommendation"

George Keith, 10th Earl Marischal

George Keith, 10th Earl Marischal (1692/3?, probably at Inverugie Castle – 1778, Potsdam) was a Scottish and Prussian army officer and diplomat. Jacobite by persuasion, he was the tenth and last Earl Marischal, having inherited the title from his father the 9th earl in 1712.
Life.
He served in Flanders under the duke of Marlborough from 1708 to 1711, but for considering placing the Old Pretender on the British throne on Queen Anne's death in he was deprived of his commission (or resigned). He fought on the Jacobite side during the 1715 Jacobite rising (including at the battle of Sheriffmuir) and was attainted for treason by the Hanoverian government, with his estates falling to the crown. He fled to the continent and went on to serve the Jacobite court at Avignon and to be its ambassador to Spain and then Prussia. He then served Frederick the Great as his ambassador to Spain from 1759 to 1761, informing the Hanoverian government of Spanish preparations to enter the war on France's side, which gained him his pardon by George II on 29 May 1759. Further actions by the Hanoverian government returned him his right to use his title and regain his estates in Great Britain but, despite brief return trips to Scotland in 1761 and 1763–64, eventually settled in Prussia for good, dying in Potsdam. His brother James Francis Edward Keith also served Prussia as a field marshal.

Paul Griffiths (born 8 August 1973) is a Welsh writer, theatre critic and director. He won the Drama Medal at the National Urdd Gobaith Cymru Eisteddfod three times in succession between 1995 and 1997 – the only person ever to do this. Since March 2006 he has contributed a controversial weekly theatre column to the National Paper of Wales Y Cymro. He is also a regular contributor on the Welsh language Television Channel S4C and BBC Radio Cymru.
Early life.
Griffiths was raised in Dolwyddelan, North Wales He set up his own theatre company aged 13 years old called Cwmni Ieuenctid Dolwyddelan. The company became successful and toured Wales competing in local theatre festivals. He was educated at Dolwyddelan school and later at Ysgol Dyffryn Conwy Secondary school in Llanrwst, North Wales. Griffiths took a three-year Media Course at the Y Coleg Normal, University of Wales, Bangor and after graduating in 1994, worked for numerous television companies as a Production Assistant, and later as an Assistant Producer and Director.
National Urdd Eisteddfod.
Griffiths won the Drama Medal at the National Urdd Gobaith Cymru Eisteddfod for the first time at the Preseli Eisteddfod in 1995 for a short play entitled "O Gysgod y Cyll" ("From the Shadows") . He repeated his success in 1996 at the Bro Maelor Eisteddfod in Wrexham with another short play called "B’echdan?" ("Sandwich?") later adapted and televised on the S4C Digital as "B'echdan Wŷ?"[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVuAp5-9MgQ] ("Egg Sandwich?"). In 1997 he won again at the Islwyn Eisteddfod in Crosskeys with the play "Ai am fod haul yn Machlud?" ("Is it because the sun is setting?") which was also later adapted and televised on S4C Digital under the new name of "Traeth Coch" ("Red Beach") starring Mali Harries. In 2000, at the Bro Conwy Eisteddfod held in Llandudno he was invited to adjudicate the competition and at the 2008 Eisteddfod, again held in Llandudno presented the Ceremony live on S4C. In 2010, Griffiths adjudicated the Drama Medal for the second time at the Ceredigion Urdd Eisteddfod. In May 2013, he was a TV studio guest for S4C during the Award Ceremony, celebrating 18 years since he won his first Medal, on the same Eisteddfod field.
TV production career.
Griffiths started his career in television production as a part of his work experience in his second year at Y Coleg Normal, University of Wales, Bangor, when he worked as a Runner on S4C's adaptation of the Saunders Lewis play "Brad" ("Treason"). After completing his Degree, he joined Eryri Films and worked on several drama series such as "Tydi Coleg yn Gret" ("Isn’t College Great") and "I Dir Drygioni" ("Into the Evil Earth") and numerous light-entertainment series for S4C. In 1995, he spent a year working as an Assistant Film Editor on S4C's eight-part family drama series "Lleifior". He joined Cwmni Da as a Researcher and later Assistant Producer in 1997, and contributed to BAFTA Cymru Award Winning series such as "Y Sioe Gelf" ("The Arts Show"), "Popeth yn Gymraeg" ("Everything in Welsh") and "Jones Jones Jones". In 2006, he filmed and directed a 30 minute documentary in the series "Love Hurts" for ITV1 Wales. He has also worked on co-productions for TG4, S4C and ITV1 Wales with Midas Productions, Dublin such as "Frongoch - Coláiste na Réabhlóide" [http://www.s4c.co.uk/ffeithiol/e_frongoch.shtml] ("Frongoch – University of Revolution") and "Celtic Monsters" which won an Award at the Celtic Film and Television Festival in 2006. In June 2007, he left North Wales and re-located to London. Griffiths continues to work from time in Wales, and his last contribution was as Assistant Producer on the live six-day coverage for S4C of the Urdd Gobaith Cymru Eisteddfod from the Conwy Valley held in May 2008. He has previously worked on the 2006 and 2007 festival broadcast.
Writing career.
In 2000, Griffiths received several writing commissions from S4C including his first feature film commission. Two other scripts had also been turned into short dramas for the Welsh-language channel. He has worked on a number of scripts for S4C series like "Pengelli" and "Tipyn o Stad" ("A Bit of a State") and wrote a 13 episode children’s animation series called "Bibi Bêl" ("Bibi the Ball") for Griffilms. His work is inspired by everyday life and gets his inspiration from listening to people talking and picking things up from conversations. In 2000, S4C's commissioning editor for drama, Angharad Jones said Griffiths’ scripts contained warmth and a sense of humour. “He also has quite a good understanding of female characters as he has got sensitivity”, she added.
Following being diagnosed with depression in 2012, Griffiths was commissioned by BBC Radio Cymru to write a short radio play about his battle with the illness and attempted suicide. "Dan y Don" (Under the Wave) scheduled for transmission in November 2013, conveys the safe haven of an underwater womb that comforts sufferers of the illness, and echoes the poetical voices of Under Milk Wood by fellow Welshman, Dylan Thomas. He is also in development with "Theatr Genedlaethol Cymru" for his inaugural full length historical drama based on the deep friendship between prize winning Poet Prosser Rhys and Morris T Williams, husband of Welsh novelist, Kate Roberts.
Theatre career.
After his Youth Company parted in 1994, Griffiths was invited to co-write, produce and direct a musical for a Festival to celebrate the centenary of poet and Archdruid Cynan in Pwllheli, Wales. In collaboration with Musical Director and Composer Annette Bryn Parry and author Glyn Roberts, Griffiths successfully produced "O Docyn Brwyn i Ben Draw’r Byd" ("From ‘Tocyn Brwyn’ to the Ends of the Earth") at Neuadd Dwyfor Theatre, Pwllheli in May 1995, with a cast of over 50 local and professional artists including the Hogia’r Wyddfa and Rosalind and Myrddin. Following the success of the production, an annual May Festival was set up in the town, and Griffiths co-wrote and directed three further productions with the cast; "Dan Hwyl Wen" ("Under a White Sail") in 1996 based on the sea-shanties of J.Glyn Davies, "Dan Gysgod y Graig" ("In the Shadow of the Rock") in 1997 based on the true story of the "Carreg yr Imbyll" Granite Company, and "Ail-Godi’r Llen" ("Raising the Curtain") in 2005, to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the company.
In 1998, Griffiths was commissioned along with composer Einion Dafydd to write a musical for the Urdd Gobaith Cymru Eisteddfod in Pwllheli, and "Yn y Ffrâm" ("Framed") was produced at Neuadd Dwyfor, during the festival week in May 1998. A second commission followed in 2000, and Griffiths worked with composer Gareth Glyn on "Ail-Liwio'r Byd" which was staged at the Venue Cymru, Llandudno in May 2000.
Since re-locating to London in June 2007, Griffiths has worked as a production assistant on "Moonwalking in Chinatown" at the Soho Theatre, "The Masque of the Red Death" at the Battersea Arts Centre, and musical productions with .
Y Cymro.
Since March 2006, Griffiths has contributed a controversial weekly theatre column to the National Paper of Wales Y Cymro. His frank and honest comments were well received, and gained the respect of many actors and theatre directors. He openly disagreed with the appointment of Cefin Roberts, as the Artistic Director of the 'Theatr Genedlaethol Cymru' (National Theatre of Wales in Welsh), and received much criticism for his honest remarks. He often declared his jealousy of the National Theatre of Scotland, under the leadership of Artistic Director Vicky Featherstone and longed that Wales could one day match their production standards.
Griffiths regularly has to defend his views, especially in respect to the Welsh language National Theatre of Wales on numerous arts programmes on BBC Radio Wales and S4C. In February 2010, Griffiths was interviewed on S4C's youth current affairs series "Hacio" in which he defended his right to criticise the work of the "Theatr Genedlaethol", on an artistic level.
To date Griffiths has covered well over 300 productions from Wales to London's West End and the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.
Youth Music Theatre UK.
Between July 2008 and March 2012, Griffiths became Operations Manager for and managed their 2008 Summer productions which included Marie Jones' "The Chosen Room" at Belfast, Terry Pratchett' "Mort" at the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre, Guildford and Nick Stimson and Jimmy Jewell's production of "Peter Pan" at the Barbican, Plymouth. YMT's production of Conor Mitchell and Kath Burlinson’s "Missing Mel" transferred to the Cochrane Theatre in the West End in October 2008.
Griffiths' Summer 2009 productions included "A Winter's Tale" by Howard Goodall and Nick Stimson at the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre, Guildford, by James Bourne and Elliot Davis directed by Steven Dexter at the South Hill Park Arts Centre in Bracknell with "Mamma Mia!" Musical Director Martin Lowe and second year developments of Marie Jones' "The Chosen Room" in Belfast and "Peter Pan" at the Aberdeen International Youth Festival. YMT also commissioned four new musicals called "Fool's Gold" and "According to Brian Haw...?" at the Barbican, Plymouth,"The Watchers" at the Bradford Playhouse and "EIGHT" at Casterton in Cumbria. In December 2009, Peter Pan transferred to the Bridewell Theatre, London for a short pre-Christmas run.
In February 2010, Griffiths appeared on S4C's early evening TV show 'Wedi 7' to promote YMT's 2010 Cardiff Auditions.
YMT's 2010 Summer productions, which Griffiths oversaw, included further development of Nick Stimson and Jimmy Jewell's "Peter Pan" alongside their new interpretation of John Gay's "The Beggar's Opera" at South Hill Park Arts Centre in Bracknell with Choreographer David Leighton. Other projects included Jenifer Toksvig's adaptation of David Almond's children's novel, "The Savage" in Casterton, Cumbria; "Scheherazade" at the Bradford Playhouse; "A Song for Eurydice" at the Barbican Plymouth and a sequel to the 2009 production of the vampire musical "The Watchers" called "Ghosts of the Past" at the Aberdeen International Youth Festival. Conor Mitchell's "The Dummy Tree" originally commissioned by the National Theatre's Connections Festival and presented by YMT members in 2009, ran for 2 weeks at London's Tristan Bates Theatre.
2011 saw further developments of Terry Pratchett' "Mort", a new musical version of Shakespeare's Macbeth and "Out There" by James Bourne and Elliot Davis directed by Steven Dexter who gave YMT in 2009. YMT's 2011 flagship show was "Korczak" based on the life and work of Janusz Korczak at the Rose Theatre, Kingston. YMT also visited the Aberdeen International Youth Festival with a new show by Kath Burlinson called "Tales of the World's End" and two shows in Plymouth, "Love and Madness" and "Jabberwocky" based on an adaptation of Jabberwocky.
In August 2011, Griffiths and the "Korczak" company were featured on S4C's 'Wedi 7' to promote the show. He resigned from the charity in March 2012, due to illness.

Magic 91FM

Magic 91FM or 91FM was a local radio station in Auckland. 91FM began broadcasting on 91.0 FM using the call sign 1MJK in 1983 and was one of the first FM stations to start in Auckland and New Zealand, along with 89 Stereo FM. 91FM played Hit Music format similar to that of ZM and in the early nineties actually used the same "Rock of the Nineties" slogan used by 91ZM in Christchurch and ZMFM in Wellington.
In 1993 91FM changed format and became The Breeze on 91FM; also at the same time 898 FM in the Waikato and Radio Windy in Wellington were all renamed to The Breeze but all three stations operated separately. 91FM had several owners during its run and in the mid-nineties was sold to Prospect Media who also owned Radio Hauraki and Easy Listening i98FM as well as several other stations. In 1996 Prospect Media was purchased by The Radio Network. During 1997 The Radio Network made several changes to their radio stations in Auckland and Hamilton, and as a result The Breeze on 91.0 FM and also The Breeze on 89.8 FM in Hamilton ceased operating and The Radio Network used these frequencies to start ZM in Auckland and Hamilton. The Breeze station in Wellington was not owned by Prospect Media or The Radio Network so was not affected by this change. The Breeze, under different ownership, made a return to Auckland in 2006 as an Easy Listening station.

"Rosemary's Baby" is the fourth episode of the second season of "30 Rock", and the twenty-fifth episode overall. It was written by Jack Burditt and was directed by Michael Engler. The episode first aired on October 25, 2007 on the NBC network in the United States. Guest stars in this episode include Elijah Cook, Carrie Fisher, Marcella Roy, Paul Scheer, Megan Blake Stevenson, Jean Villepique and Stuart Zagnit.
The episode focuses on Liz Lemon's (Tina Fey) escapade with her idol, Rosemary Howard (Carrie Fisher); Tracy Jordan's (Tracy Morgan) family problems; and Jenna Maroney's (Jane Krakowski) attempt to replace Kenneth Parcell's (Jack McBrayer) burnt page jacket. The episode was praised by critics, with Alec Baldwin winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series.
Plotlines.
Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) announces that Liz Lemon is the winner of the "G.E. Followship Award", a prize awarded to the G.E. employee who best exemplifies a follower, which also includes $10,000. Liz takes Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) to a book signing to meet Rosemary Howard (Carrie Fisher), her idol when she was a girl, and invites her to be a guest writer on "The Girlie Show". Rosemary pitches several controversial ideas to Jack, who orders Liz to fire her, but when Liz refuses, Jack fires them both. Liz goes to Rosemary's house, and once she realizes that Rosemary is crazy, she flees. Liz goes back to Jack's office and begs for her job back, and he happily rehires her. Jack promises to help Liz invest her prize money, and she swears that she will send Rosemary $400 a month for the rest of her life.
When Tracy causes a stir at a public event, Jack assures him that as a movie star, he can do anything he wants, except for dog fighting. Jack finds Tracy disobeying his order, but Tracy shouts that Jack is not his dad. Jack and Tracy meet with an NBC shrink, and Jack role-plays Tracy's father, Tracy, and Tracy's mom, among several other people from Tracy's childhood, conveying the message that even though Tracy's parents may have divorced, they still loved him. This comforts Tracy, and affirms that while he loves his family, they are crazy, and he needs to stay away from them. Tracy hugs Jack, and tells him that he is the only family he needs.
Jenna accidentally burns Kenneth's page jacket on a hot plate, and Kenneth worries that head page Donny Lawson (Paul Scheer) will punish him. Jenna finds Donny backstage at the studio, who is ecstatic that he finally has a reason to send Kenneth to CNBC in New Jersey. Donny offers Kenneth a choice: go to New Jersey, or compete in a "page off", a contest of physical stamina and NBC trivia; Jenna agrees to the page off. Before the event starts, Pete comes in and yells at the pages to get back to work. He forces Donny to give Kenneth a new jacket, but Donny swears to Jenna and Kenneth that he will get back at them.
Production.
"Rosemary's Baby" was mainly filmed on September 11, 2007, while Fisher's scenes were filmed the next day on September 12, 2007. "Star Wars" is frequently referenced in "30 Rock", beginning with the pilot episode where Tracy Jordan is seen shouting that he is a Jedi. Liz Lemon admits to being a huge fan of "Star Wars", saying that she had watched it many times with Pete Hornberger, and dressed up as the "Star Wars" character Princess Leia during four recent Halloweens. "Star Wars" is also referenced when Tracy Jordan takes on the identity of the character Chewbacca. Fey, a fan of "Star Wars" herself, said that the weekly "Star Wars" joke or reference "started happening organically" when the crew realized that they had a "Star Wars" reference "in almost every show". Fey said that from then on "it became a thing where tried to keep it going", and that even though they could not include one in every episode, they still had a "pretty high batting average". Fey attributed most of the references to Robert Carlock, who she described as "the resident expert". Prior to the airing of the episode, fans were "raving" about the much awaited guest appearance of Fisher. Fisher's last line in the episode, "Help me, Liz Lemon! You're my only hope!", was a spoof of the line "Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope!" from her past role in the original "Star Wars" trilogy, in which she played Princess Leia.
Reception.
According to the Nielsen ratings system, "Rosemary's Baby" was viewed by an average of 6.5 million American viewers. The episode achieved a 3.1/8 in key 18–49 demographic. The 3.1 rating refers to 3.1% of all 18–49 year olds in the U.S., and the 8 share refers to 8% of all 18–49 year olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. In the U.S., "Rosemary's Baby" was up by 19% in the rating demographic compared to the previous episode, "The Collection," receiving its highest result since the second season premiere episode, "SeinfeldVision," on October 4, 2007.
"Rosemary's Baby" was named as one of the "Top 11 TV Episodes of 2007" by "UGO", and ranked thirteenth on "The Futon Critic"'s list of "the 50 Best Episodes of 2007"; both citing the Baldwin and Morgan therapy scene as the reason. Matt Webb Mitovich of "TV Guide" declared it as "one of "30 Rock's" best episodes ever." Webb Mitovich praised Carrie Fisher's guest appearance, but felt that Baldwin's role-playing during Morgan's therapy session stole the show. Bob Sassone of TV Squad felt that even though the plot was "insane", the episode still managed "to have a heart at its core". Sassone called the therapy scene "one of the funniest scenes ... on TV this season". Robert Canning of IGN felt that the episode has "great storylines to great guest stars", making it "one of the best the series has produced so far". Canning called the therapy scene "the best moment of the episode". "Entertainment Weekly" put it on its end-of-the-decade, "best-of" list, saying, " Between Carrie Fisher's delightfully bonkers guest role and Jack Donaghy's hijacking of Tracy Jordan's therapy session, this 2007 episode was so wrong. And so good."
Michael Engler, the director of this episode, was nominated for the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Directing – Comedy Series. This episode also earned Carrie Fisher a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series and earned Jack Burditt a nomination for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series.

USS Northern Pacific

USS "Northern Pacific" was a transport ship for the United States Navy during World War I. She was known as SS "Northern Pacific" before the war and, after her Navy service, as USAT "Northern Pacific" as a United States Army transport. She was destroyed by fire in 1922.
History.
SS "Northern Pacific", a steamer laid down on 25 September 1913, was completed by William Cramp and Sons of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1914 as a sister ship to . She was acquired by the United States Shipping Board (USSB) from the Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway of Portland, Oregon, on 17 September 1917 and commissioned on 3 November 1917 at Bremerton, Washington, with Lieutenant Commander Alfred T. Hunter in command.
The passenger steamer was originally built to serve between Astoria, Oregon, and San Francisco, before World War I. The Navy operated the ship during the war. She departed San Francisco on 7 March for New York via the Panama Canal. Joining the Cruiser and Transport Squadron during the war, "Northern Pacific" operated between Hoboken, New Jersey and Brest, France, making a total of 13 trips taking 22,645 troops and passengers to France and returning 9,532 to the United States. The influenza epidemic hit the ship hard in September 1918 en route to Brest. Cots were set up in the brig and in the open corridors. There were 7 deaths. On 2 October, sister ship collided with the British ship "Brinkburn", which caused "Great Northern" to lose contact with the convoy. "Northern Pacific" searched and found her sister seaworthy enough to rejoin the convoy.
"Northern Pacific" ran aground off Fire Island, New York on 1 January 1919. Her troops were transferred to other ships. She was refloated on 18 January, and proceeded to Staten Island. She was decommissioned on 20 August 1919 and was subsequently transferred to the Army Transport Service.
Returned to the USSB on 22 November 1921, she was sold to the Pacific Steamship Company on 2 February 1922; while being towed to their yard at Chester, Pennsylvania, she was destroyed by fire.

SN76477 "complex sound generator" was a sound chip produced by Texas Instruments (TI). The chip came to market in 1978, and TI production of the part ceased some time ago. More recently, a 100% compatible version, identified as ICS76477, has been listed as 'in stock' by at least one US-based component stockist. The chip was typically used as a sound effects generator in arcade games and toys and for hobby projects. The following quotation summarizes its facilities:
The use of the SN76477 in a musical context was limited by the fact that it was difficult to electronically control the pitch of the produced sound.

2008 Chelopechene explosions

The 2008 Chelopechene explosions were a series of explosions that began early on Thursday morning 3 July 2008 at around 6:30 am local time at a munitions depot in the suburb of Chelopechene, 10 kilometres east of the centre of the Bulgarian capital, Sofia. The initial explosions were powerful enough to be heard in the entire capital and surrounding villages. The depot was part of a military facility ("Podelenie 18 250") that specialised in dismantling obsolete ammunition.
Timeline.
At 6:28 am, Sofia residents were awakened by a powerful, deafening explosion so loud it set off car alarms in districts as far away as Lyulin, some 15 km from the blast. Further east there was great panic among residents as the shockwave shattered windows and some trees were blown down. There was another powerful blast at 6:45 am. Explosions continued throughout the day prompting authorities to evacuate the residents of Chelopechene, Chepintsi and Botunets.
A mushroom cloud formed after the first explosion and rose quickly into the morning sky, obscuring the sun.
Smaller explosions occurred after midnight on the morning of July 4.
Panic and first media reports.
The first official reports of the blast came on the Bulgarian National Radio 7:00 am news bulletin. TV stations and Internet media also reported that "loud explosions were heard in Sofia but the source was not immediately clear".
Bulgarian Nova Television, which is in close proximity to the blast site, showed residents leaving their homes in panic. Some complained of difficulty breathing. Two men wept on TV, saying their homes were absolutely devastated.
Police and emergency services were inundated with calls from frantic residents. Ambulances and fire engines rushed to the scene but there was little they could do since loud explosions were still being heard in the area.
Official response.
The mayor of Sofia, Boyko Borisov, was among the first officials to arrive at the scene. He arrived and issued a warning to local residents to stay indoors or leave the area and to the inhabitants of Sofia to stay at home, and close all windows.
Later, all residents were ordered to evacuate an 8-km zone around the site for fear of another, more powerful explosion.
Representatives from the Bulgarian Red Cross, the Ministry of Emergency Situations, the Ministry for the Environment, the Ministry of Defense, Civil Defense Units and Pirogov paramedics were all at the scene.
The first few hours were characterised by many accusations in front of television crews between Borisov and Etem that the situation had not been, and was not, being handled well. [http://news.netinfo.bg/?tid=40&oid=1215874][http://www.today.bg/news/34443.html]
It is an interesting coincidence that a modernised system of the pan-European 112 emergency telephone line had only become operational at midnight on the same day. "Even if we had organized it, we could not have planned it so well," the Emergency Situations Minister told MPs.
Injuries and property damage.
Two people suffered cuts from broken glass and one man was taken to hospital with smoke inhalation. Four soldiers on duty at the depots escaped unscathed.
Damage to the area was extensive. Aerial photos showed that the facility was completely obliterated. The ammunitions depot and surrounding buildings were destroyed.
Nearby homes suffered broken windows and smashed doors and cracks appeared on several homes. Sofia Airport and the Russian Cultural and Information Centre also suffered broken windows. The airport was closed after debris from the blasts fell near a taxiway.
Contents.
A total of 1,494 tonnes of ageing artillery shells, rocket propelled grenades, depth charges, hand grenades and other explosives were stored at the depots, the Defense Ministry said in a statement. The communist-era ammunition had been due for disposal by army experts.
Sofia airport closure.
The international Sofia Airport had to close down as broken glass was reported at Terminal One and debris on the runways. All flights were redirected to Plovdiv International Airport, about 160 kilometers east of Sofia.
Possible causes.
By Sunday, June 6 there were already rumours circulating that the explosions were intentionally caused. Defence Minister Nikolai Tsonev said that a fire (such as the one that caused the explosions) could not have accidentally occurred, and if it had indeed been an accident, that "whole blocks of flats would have been toppled". Instead, it was carefully engineered to spare casualties, Tsonev told reporters. He said that information from as far back as 2002 had suggested of wrongdoing at the unit.

Prosecutor General Boris Velchev considers the security of the facility inadequate and intends to investigate why the 1,500 tonnes of munitions were guarded only by two retired servicemen.The commander of the base is also under investigation for improprieties in the auctioning of the products of the dismantling.[http://www.dnes.bg/article.php?id=53965. On June 10, it became clear that 200 tonnes of munitions had been missing from the warehouses; one version being circulated was that the explosions aimed to cover up wrongdoings.[http://mediapool.bg/show/?storyid=140884&srcpos=2&p=2]
On Friday, July 11, it became clear that investigations would be carried out on suspicions into the possibility that the explosions were carried out on land due to be privatised. [http://www.mediapool.bg/show/?storyid=141137&srcpos=2][http://www.mediapool.bg/show/?storyid=141084&srcpos=10]
Afternoon earthquake.
To make matters worse, there was a moderate earthquake at 15:12 EET measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale. The epicentre was 15 km south of the centre of Sofia, in the borough of Pancharevo. Residents thought this was another explosion and rushed to the streets in panic, especially those living in high-rise buildings in the Mladost district. Scientists from the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences said it was extremely unlikely that the earthquake was triggered by the blasts. The geological institute also said that there was no link to the blasts. Bulgaria's defense minister Nikolay Tsonev said that there were no underground galleries at the military facility and thus no underground blasts that could have caused the recorded tremor.
Environmental impact.
"Large quantities of conventional ammunition are stored in the facility, but there are no toxic chemicals or radioactive substances stored there," said Nikolai Kolev, a former army chief of staff. There was visible air pollution in the area and residents said there was a strange smell in the air near the blast zone.

Vaginal septum

A vaginal septum is a congenital partition within the vagina; such a septum could be either longitudinal or transverse.
Longitudinal septum – double vagina.
A longitudinal vaginal septum develops during embryogenesis when there is an incomplete fusion of the lower parts of the two mullerian ducts. As a result, there is a "double vagina". There may be associated duplications of the more cranial parts of the mullerian derivatives, a double cervix, and either a uterine septum or uterus didelphys (double uterus).
The person with a longitudinal vaginal septum may be asymptomatic and not aware of the condition. If dyspareunia is a problem a simple resection of the septum could be performed.
Transverse septum.
A transverse septum can form during embryogenesis when the mullerian ducts fuse improperly to the urogenital sinus. A complete transverse septum will block menstrual flow and is a cause of primary amenorrhea. The accumulation of menstrual debris behind the septum is termed cryptomenorrhea. Some transverse septa are incomplete and may lead to dyspareunia or obstruction in labor. A surgical incision will relieve the situation.

Lake Hotel

The Lake Hotel is one of a series of hotels built to accommodate visitors to Yellowstone National Park in the late 19th and early 20th century. Built originally in 1891, it was re-designed and substantially expanded by Robert Reamer, architect of the Old Faithful Inn in 1903. In contrast to the Old Faithful Inn, the Lake Hotel is a relatively plain clapboarded Colonial Revival structure with two large Ionic porticoes facing Yellowstone Lake.
The original 1891 hotel was a large three-story structure with projecting bays at each end. Its construction was supervised by R.R. Cummins for the Northern Pacific Railroad, which was building two other, similar hotels in the park. Reamer's 1903 remodeling changed these projections to the present Ionic porticoes. An eastward extension was added at this time, with a third matching portico. In 1922-23 a further extension to the east was undertaken, this with a flat roof. In 1928 a two-story west wing was added, expanding the dining room and adding a solarium to the front. The entire hotel was extensively renovated from 1984 to 1990.
The Lake Hotel is adjoined by the Lake Fish Hatchery Historic District and the Grand Loop Road Historic District.
The west wing of the Lake Hotel was renovated in the winter and spring of 2012, including the formal dining room and beautiful sun room/lounge. The remaining rooms in the east end of the hotel will be renovated during the fall and winter of 2013-2014.
Lake Yellowstone Hotel & Cabins is a member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.
