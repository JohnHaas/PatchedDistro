Gedling and Carlton railway station

Gedling and Carlton railway station was a former railway station built to serve the villages of Gedling and Carlton in Nottinghamshire. It was opened by the Great Northern Railway (Great Britain) on its Derbyshire Extension in 1875–6 and closed in 1960.
History.
It was on the climb from the junction at Colwick with the Ambergate, Nottingham, Boston and Eastern Junction Railway into Nottingham London Road.
From Gedling and Carlton, the line climbed through Mapperley Tunnel between the Trent and Leen valleys, reaching the first summit of the line at Arno Vale.
Mapperley Tunnel was extremely unstable due to mining subsidence and the heavy traffic through it. In 1925 part of the roof collapsed, blocking the line, and this was part of the reason that this section of line closed prematurely.

Félix Granda

Rev. Félix Granda y Álvarez Buylla (Mieres, 1868–1954) was a Spanish Roman Catholic priest and sacred artist who founded the liturgical art workshop "Talleres de Arte" and directed its activities until his death. The workshop is now known as "Talleres de Arte Granda" in Spanish-speaking countries and as "Granda Liturgical Arts" in English-speaking countries.
Early life.
Felix Granda was born on 21 February 1868 in Mieres, in the Spanish principality of Asturias. He was the oldest of the six children of Wenceslao Granda, a physician, and his wife Elvira. He began studies for the priesthood at the minor seminary in Oviedo at the age of ten, and refined his skills in draftsmanship, painting, sculpture and metalwork by studying with artisans. He spent many summers in Muros de Nalon with a group of painters that included Joaquín Sorolla y Bastida and Cecilio Pla y Gallardo.
He was ordained a priest of the Diocese of Madrid in 1891.
"Talleres de Arte".
That same year, at the age of 23, Granda founded "Talleres de Arte" in Madrid. The Archbishop-Bishop of Madrid-Alcalá, Jose Maria Cos y Macho, whom Granda had known when Cos was the rector of Oviedo Cathedral, approved the young priest's ministry, writing:
The works of art that leave your factories will open paths, as much in the republics of South America as in the European nations... by the profundity of the thought and the Christian spirit that animates them, by the newness and beauty of the drawing and the careful execution... Continue without hesitation, for the good of religion, the profession of the arts, joining perfectly your sacerdotal vocation with your artistic aptitude.
The original workshop was located on "Calle Fernando el Santo" in Madrid, but was soon relocated to the "Hotel de las Rosas" residence in the "Altos del Hipodromo" to accommodate the growing number of artisans. Granda described the location:
To be able to make the art that we intend, we all live within a morally and physically sanitary environment... In the healthiest part of Madrid, at the extension of "la Castellana", to the left of the racetrack, are buildings surrounded by gardens, with studios, workshops and living quarters that are spacious and flooded with air and light. 
Felix Granda lived at the "Hotel de las Rosas" with his sister Candida, a childless widow who assisted him in the administration of the workshop. By 1900, over 200 artisans were employed by "Talleres de Arte", creating altarpieces, statuary, tabernacles, reliquaries, monstrances, sacred vessels and other works of sacred art. The relationships with artists in various media that Granda had established in his formative years proved invaluable when gathering together so many artisans into a single enterprise. In 1911, he wrote:
My desire is to decorate; that is, to bring order, subordinating to a determined end various works of art, and that is why I have tried to gather under one address all those artistic professions that I believe most necessary for my aim: painting, sculpture, goldsmithery, enamelwork, carpentry, work in bronze; as well as drawing and embroidery for religious vestments. 
Granda began no new project without a detailed explanation of its iconography to all of the artisans who would contribute. Each studio was directed by a master of the craft who managed the artisans and trained the apprentices. Labor ceased at dusk, when the workers were given time for formation, classes and conferences. The sculptors Jose Capuz Mamano, Luis Ortega Bru and Juan Vargas Cortes were among the many artisans who received their training at "Talleres de Arte".
In 1911, the year of the International Eucharistic Congress in Madrid, Felix Granda won the gold medal at the city's Exposition of Decorative Arts. The same year saw the publication of the workshop's first general catalogue.
Artistic philosophy and influences.
The animating principle of the workshop was taken from Psalm 25.8: "I have loved, O Lord, the beauty of Thy house; and the place where Thy glory dwelleth". This, coupled with Felix Granda's own aspiration: "I am moved by the ideal of employing all my strength to make beautiful Thy temples and Thine altars", became the motto of "Talleres de Arte". The emblem of the workshop depicted a man praying at the foot of an olive tree shedding many of its branches. The words that the man speaks are written on a banderole: "Vetera novis augere et perficere" (a motto of Pope Leo XIII: "To augment and perfect the old by way of the new") and "Defracti sunt rami ut ego insererer" (Romans 11.19: "The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in").
When Granda wrote a short exposition of his purpose in 1911, he began by quoting the aforementioned motto of Pope Leo XIII, as well as that of Pope Pius X: "Instaurare omnia in Christo" (Ephesians 1.10: "To restore all things in Christ"). The twofold theme of innovation and restoration was essential to his artistic and religious mission. Ernest Grimaud DeCaux, the Madrid correspondent for "The Times" explained:
At first sight he but returns to the first ages of the Church, when art was utilized to bring home to the multitudes, by the aid of symbols, religious dogmas and mysteries. Where Father Granda's originality shows itself, however, where a new art appears, is in his method of representing the eternal Christian symbolisms. He buries himself in the past and by patient study absorbs the spirit of the ancient symbols and with the knowledge thus acquired, aided by his mastery of the Scriptures, which are his code, he throws such power of expression into his work that not only every article dealt with, but even every line and shape of each piece has its symbolical voice recalling some act of Christ, a saying of the Holy Fathers, or a dogma of the Catholic religion. This eternal theme would be cold and monotonous if clothed in the past forms of art. In the hands of this artist priest penetrated with the spirit of the past, versed in the essence of Christianity, but with a modern mind, it takes a new shape, and it is in this respect that Father Granda is an innovator, because, whilst still going to the old well of tradition, he draws fresh water from it.
Granda himself wrote:
To make an art impregnated with the scent of Christ, saturated with memories of the past, where the Biblical spirit beats; and that this art be alive, united to the trunk of the traditions; and because it is of the past, that it correspond to the needs of the present: such is my desire... To begin a work from those same origins; to drink from the same fonts that inspired Christian art in its most glorious epochs. All this, deeply felt and executed with careful study, is what I desire to do with my own labors, and is what I want the artists and workers who form these workshops to do. 
Under his direction, "Talleres de Arte" fabricated work in a variety of styles: Mozarabic, Romanesque, Gothic, Baroque and Rococo. Granda sought inspiration for his artwork from the beginnings of Christian history to his own time. When describing the iconographic schemes in his work, he often justified them by the precedent of Christian antiquity, citing studies by the archaeologists Antonio Bosio, Giovanni Giustino Ciampini, Giovanni Caetano Bottari, Rev. Giuseppe Marchi, Giovanni Battista de Rossi, Louis Perret, Rev. Joseph-Alexander Martigny and Alphonse de Boissieu.
Yet Granda also corresponded with the architects of the Catalan "Art Nouveau", such as Antoni Gaudí, who represented the artistic vanguard of his time, and he shared their enthusiasm for daring incorporation of natural forms into sacred art. For example, both Gaudí and Granda were fond of using figures of sea turtles as supports; Gaudí for the bases of the columns of the "Sagrada Familia", and Granda as the legs of his monstrances. Granda was at times even bolder than Gaudí in his imagery. He wrote:
Today it is not enough to study the works of God as they have been studied before, to admire only the world that our eyes see... Through the microscope we can see the infinitely varied microorganisms; more powerful images have never come to the imagination of the artist. Should we not take advantage of this immense arsenal of scientific data that they provide to us, to make richer and more varied our decorations, and to teach the truth contained in the verse of the Kingly Prophet: "nimis profundae factae sunt cogitationes tuae Domine!"? 
Granda discerned his principles from intense study of art history, scripture, patristics, sacred liturgy, religious tradition and nature; his purpose was to apply the same principles to everything made in his workshops, regardless of historical style. In 1929, Rev. Demetrio Zurbitu Recalde, SJ wrote an essay describing the work of "Talleres de Arte"; according to him, the whole of Felix Granda's philosophy of art could be condensed into four words: dignity, religiosity, popularity and symbolism.
Dignity.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the quality of religious art declined, as artisanal traditions were replaced by industrial models of production. A sentimental style of mass-produced art, known as "l'art Saint-Sulpice" after a Parisian neighborhood famous for its religious goods stores, became the international standard of sacred art for the Roman Catholic Church. Zurbitu decried the prevalent artistic standards of his time:
It would be said that the artists had ceded their posts to the merchants; it would seem that the sculptor and the goldsmith had no concern for making a beautiful object to inspire piety, but rather for making an industrial model able to be multiplied by the dozen. The noble carving of marble and wood had been laid aside before the invasion of common plaster... And in this inundation of so many profane and vulgar objects, as wretched in form as in material, it would be useless to look for any sign of religious inspiration or even a recollection of the respect deserved by the noble destiny for which they were forged: honor to the House of God and participation in the most august sacrifice.
In contrast, the artwork produced at "Talleres de Arte" was made according to the highest standards of craftsmanship and material. The finest sacred metalwork produced at "Talleres de Arte" was the richest then produced in Spain, embellished with repoussage, set gemstones, carved ivory figures, vitreous enamels, and medallions, figurines and friezes worked in metal. But Granda also believed that humbler objects, produced for churches and monasteries without wealthy patrons, although lacking the splendor of richness must never lack the dignity of beauty. He wrote that "it has more value that a man venerate a statue of Tanagra clay than a shapeless gold sculpture of decadent art".
Granda preferred the direct carving of wood and stone to cast sculpture, believing that the easy methods of mass production resulted in a paganized sensuousness of form. The sculptures carved by his artisans were rather "noble and sober, full of gravity and purity, without tragic poses or excessive gestures; the most proper to the serene beauty of religious art". Granda decried theatricality in religious art, applying to it Saint Jerome's condemnation of pompous rhetoric: "Like a strumpet in the streets, it does not aim at instructing the public, but at winning their favor."
Religiosity.
Felix Granda's second principle was religiosity; he wrote of his desire "o use art as we use language, to speak and to teach about Christ - not to teach about ourselves, and much less to boast of our luxury and vanity". As a devout priest, Granda's imagination was saturated with the images of Holy Scripture, which he described as "an inexhausible treasury of motifs and figures". Zurbitu commented:
Scripture, doctrine, liturgy, tradition... are the perennial fonts from which spring his artistic ideas; the arsenal of his decorative themes. An altarpiece designed by Father Granda is not merely a set of architectural elements... The great altars built in "Talleres de Arte" are truly poetic, each developing an entire cycle of liturgical and theological ideas, full of doctrine and religiosity.
As an example, Zurbitu explained the symbolism of a monstrance that Granda designed for Nocturnal Adoration in Madrid. Figures of the Four and Twenty Elders who worship the Lamb in St. John's Apocalypse are placed around the base, separated into three groups; eight kneel, eight bow profoundly, and eight lift bowls of smoking incense according to their degree of spiritual perfection. Around the base of the monstrance's throne, men of the Old Testament prefiguring the Eucharistic sacrifice stand as caryatids. Abraham and Isaac walk to Mount Moriah, recalling the sacrifice of Calvary. Moses and a snakebitten Israelite represent salvation through the Holy Cross. Melchizedek presents his offering of bread and wine, and Isaiah and David proclaim their messianic prophecies.
Between them are sculpted warriors keeping watch. An inscription from identifies them: "Behold threescore valiant ones of the most valiant of Israel surrounded the bed of Solomon. All holding swords, and most expert in war: every man's sword upon his thigh, because of fears in the night" (Song of Songs 3.7). This is an allegory for Nocturnal Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament. Around the monstrance holding the Divine Solomon (Christ), the chosen men of Israel (Christians), armed with prayer and mortification, stand guard against the fears in the night (the traps that the Prince of Darkness has prepared in the shadows against the Church Militant).
On another monstrance, Granda fashioned the base in the likeness of the City of God, with twelve gates guarded by angels bearing the names of the twelve tribes. The monstrance stands on seven pillars that rise from this base, which recall the Proverb: "Wisdom hath built herself a house, she hath hewn her out seven pillars" (Proverbs 9.1).
Popularity.
Demetrio Zurbitu wrote that "the adornment of our temples cannot be an exclusive gift to a few aesthetes; it needs to be understood and savored by the believing masses". According to this spirit, Felix Granda insisted that the art produced at "Talleres De Arte" not be abstruse; that it be able to be understood and enjoyed by all worshippers, including the simple and unschooled. He employed forms that would translate into popular imagination; angels and demons, monsters and mythological creatures, regional flora and fauna, and men at their everyday labors.
Symbolism.
The restoration of a symbolism to sacred art was a foundational principle of "Talleres de Arte". In his initial instructions to Felix Granda in 1891, Archbishop Cos encouraged him to "restore to the objects of divine worship the sacred symbolism that they have lost through the centuries". Ernest Grimaud DeCaux wrote of Father Granda:
A fervent admirer of the works of infinite beauty created by the artists, sculptors, carvers and metal-workers of the Middle Ages with their richness of symbolism, he laments that the Christian art of today hardly exists as a symbolical art. He ardently desires, therefore, to revive modern church art. He would see, in each sanctuary, sacred vessels symbolical in themselves and not merely dead objects in the hands of the officiant.
Commonly recurring symbols included fountains with seven streams representing the sacraments; the pious pelican giving blood to its chicks; the thirsting deer, representing souls longing for God; roses representing the Holy Wounds; the dove and the wolf, symbols of the pure soul and the perverse soul; the olive tree, symbol of peace; the peacock, symbol of immortality; the asp and the basilisk, representing sin; the Tree of Life; and the Good Shepherd. Granda himself wrote:
The Holy Bible, the hymns and prayers of the Church, offer to us an inexhaustible treasure of motifs and figures... The lines, the lights and reflections of gold, the luster and color of precious stones, the roses and the irises, the passion flowers and the daisies, the pomegranates, the grapevines, the leaves and the flowers, the fish and the birds, the waters and the clouds, the signs and the mysterious things that the sacred books suggest to us are the words with which we stammer the name of our hearts' beloved.
Zurbitu described a candlestick made at "Talleres de Arte", with a base formed by three hooded men sleeping while mounted on the backs of monsters; the monsters represent vice, and the candle is a perennial symbol of Christ. The sleepers are those to whom St. Paul speaks: "Rise thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead: and Christ shall enlighten thee" (Ephesians 5.14).
Major works.
Under the direction of Felix Granda, "Talleres de Arte" designed and fabricated elaborate monstrances for the cathedrals of Leon, Lugo, Madrid, Oviedo and Burgos. An altarpiece built for the episcopal palace in Madrid, dedicated to the Virgin of Almudena, is now prominent in the city's new cathedral.
The crown for Our Lady of Guadalupe in Caceres was created at "Talleres de Arte" in 1928. The canonical coronation of was attended by King Alfonso XIII, the papal nuncio, and every cardinal of Spain. Other major works included the main altar in the Cistercian Abbey of San Isidro de Dueñas in Palencia, an altar in the Basilica del Pilar in Zaragoza, the altar of Nuestra Señora del Buen Consejo in the Church of San Isisdro in Madrid; and the murals in the apse of the seminary chapel in Madrid.
Church of St. Thomas — Avilés, Spain.
In 1903, Felix Granda designed the interior furnishings for the new Church of St. Thomas of Canterbury in Avilés, designed by Luis Bellido Gonzalez. 
The main altar has a mensa supported by three winged figures worked in bronze, holding shields which display the attributes of the Theological Virtues. Between them are marble bas-reliefs of the sacrifice of Abraham and of Melchizedek, expressing the double aspect of the Mass as Sacrifice and as Sacrament. The tabernacle is composed of two statues holding an ark; the men are Melchizedek, representing the natural law, and Aaron, representing the Mosaic law. The ark they support represents the Church. On its door is the Lamb of God, flanked by a dove, symbol of the pure soul, and a wolf, symbol of the perverse soul. At its corners stand figures of the four Evangelists, and on its other façades are depicted the Holy Trinity, the Last Supper and the Wedding at Cana, which St. Cyril of Jerusalem saw as an image of transubstantiation. Behind the tabernacle are five paintings; the central one of Mary, and the others showing scenes from the lives of St. Thomas of Canterbury and from the foundation of the Order of Mercy.
Side altars are dedicated to Our Lady of Mount Carmel, the Madre del Amor Hermoso, and St. Joseph. The pulpit is crowned by a griffin, representing the two-natured Christ. Winged monsters representing the vices tumble beneath it. The lower part of the pulpit's rostrum is decorated with four animals: a lion, a dog, a rooster and a ram, representing the necessary virtues of a good preacher: strength, fidelity, opportunity and courage.
Tomb of St. John of the Cross — Segovia, Spain.
The sepulchral chapel of St. John of the Cross in Segovia was built in 1926 to commemorate the bicentennial of the saint's canonization, and includes an altarpiece, several statues and reliefs, mosaics, a tabernacle, and an elaborate coffin above the altar containing the torso and head of the saint.
Belen Jesuit Church — Havana, Cuba.
The altarpiece of the Belen Church in Havana was built by "Talleres de Arte" in 1915. This Jesuit church is one of the only Gothic Revival buildings in Cuba. The altarpiece is also Gothic, with pinnacles, elaborate tracery and tiny hunkypunks. The central image is a large statue of the Sacred Heart. A procession of figures representing the Patriarchs and Prophets stand on a plinth of marble and carry the Ark of the Covenant; above them statues of angels lift up the triumphant Christ Child. The lateral sections house statues of Jesuit saints.
Virgin of Covadonga — Covadonga, Spain.
The triptychal throne and crown for the Virgin of Covadonga were made at "Talleres de Arte" in 1928. Demetrio Zurbitu described the work:
It has the fantastic richness of an oriental tale... when the doors of the throne are opened wide so that the image may be venerated, it seems like the opening of the pages of a great book written for the people: for Asturias and for Spain... Because everything here has been done for them, everything is within reach of their intelligence. They know the patriarchs, prophets and kings... who recall the lineage of the Virgin of Nazareth. They know also the two larger figures... who represent the church of Asturias; they are her patrons, St. Matthew and St. Eulalia. They know the animals scattered throughout the ornamental borders to be symbols of the land of Asturias, because they live... in her forests and mountains. And they know, most of all, the four representations of Asturian life - plowing the land, forging iron, fishing and mining - who, hammered in relief on the bottom part of the portals, are like men offering their daily struggles at the foot of the throne of their Queen.
On the pedestal of the statue's throne is carved the story of Pelayo, founder of the Kingdom of Asturias and hero of the Reconquest. On the throne itself, a concept of sublime Marian theology is expressed. The days of creation are represented by worlds budding from chaos, rays of light tearing the clouds, waters separating, vegetation blooming, beasts and fish and birds filling the earth. The Virgin who sits here is presented as greater than all creation, because the world and the things that fill it deserve to be no more than the throne of her majesty. This composition recalls the words which are read as the lesson at the Mass of the Immaculate Conception: "I was set up from eternity, and of old before the earth was made. The depths were not as yet, and I was already conceived" (Proverbs 8.22-30).
Sanctuary of la Gran Promesa — Valladolid, Spain.
A 17th-century church in Valladolid that had formerly served as the chapel of the Jesuit College of St. Ambrose; the parish Church of St. Stephen, and the Expiatory Temple of the Sacred Heart was rededicated as the National Sanctuary of "la Gran Promesa" in 1941 to commemorate an especially Spanish devotion to the Sacred Heart propagated by the 18th century Jesuit Bernardo de Hoyos.
"Talleres de Arte" created the new interior artwork for the Sanctuary over the next decade, replacing altarpieces and shrines destroyed by fire in 1869. The main altarpiece includes a large sculpture of the Sacred Heart and reliefs of John the Apostle, Mary, the Last Supper and the Doubt of Thomas. Felix Granda also designed side altars dedicated to Christ the King of Martyrs and Our Lady of the Pillar, as well as reliefs of "la Gran Promesa" and the Adoration of the Magi; a processional float of Christ the King; the Pulpit; the Stations of the Cross; the tabernacle; the rood and the monstrance.

Ashdot Ya'akov (, lit. "Ya'akov Rapids") is a kibbutz in northern Israel. It was founded in 1924 by a kvutza of Hashomer members from Latvia on the land which is today Gesher. It was named after the rapids of the nearby Yarmouk River and James "Ya'akov" Armand de Rothschild. 
Between 1933 and 1935 the kibbutz moved north-east of its original location, onto land which had been bought by the Palestine Jewish Colonization Association. 
The children of Ashod Yaacov were evacuated during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war when the kibbutz took intensive shelling from Syrian, Iraqi and Transjordanian forces.
In 1953, as a result of the split in the HaKibbutz HaMeuhad movement, the kibbutz was split in two:

Kimberley East railway station

Kimberley East Railway Station was a station serving the town of Kimberley in Nottinghamshire, England.
History.
It was opened by the Great Northern Railway on its Derbyshire Extension in 1875-6
It was on the second summit on the climb through Watnall Tunnel from Basford and Bulwell of what was a hilly line, crossing as it did, several river valleys. Passenger services finished in 1964 and the line finally closed in 1968.
Following the trackbed of this line takes you to the Bennerley Viaduct. This is a grade II listed structure which is still in place on the Nottinghamshire Derbyshire border.
Kimberley's other station was on a line from the Midland Railway's Erewash Valley Line to Nottingham.
Present day.
The line is now disused although it can still be traced and is used by walkers and horse riders from Kimberley as far as Hempshill Vale towards Nottingham where its trackbed has been used to accommodate Hempshill Hall Primary School.
The station buildings have been converted to residential accommodation. Part of the site of the station platforms is occupied by a car park and commercial workshop units. The former goods yard was occupied as a timber storage yard for many years but was subsequently redeveloped for housing. The rest of the station site and the trackbed towards Watnall (as far as the Newdigate Street road bridge where the cutting has been filled) has been preserved as a nature reserve.

Quarto

Quarto (abbreviated 4to or 4°) is a book or pamphlet produced from full 'blanksheets', each of which is printed with eight pages of text, four to a side, then folded twice to produce four leaves (that is, eight book pages). Each printed page now presents as one-fourth size of the full blanksheet.
The earliest known European printed book is a quarto, the Sibyllenbuch, believed to have been printed by Gutenberg in 1452–53, before the Gutenberg Bible, surviving only as a fragment. Quarto is also used as a general description of size of books that are about 12 inches tall, and as such does not necessarily indicate the actual printing format of the books, which may even be unknown as is the case for many modern books. These terms are discussed in greater detail in Book sizes.
Quarto as format.
A quarto (from Latin "quartō", ablative form of "quartus", fourth ) is a book or pamphlet made up of one or more full sheets of paper on which 8 pages of text were printed, which were then folded two times to produce four leaves. Each leaf of a quarto book thus represents one fourth the size of the original sheet. Each group of 4 leaves (called a "gathering" or "quire") could be sewn through the central fold to attach it to the other gatherings to form a book. Sometimes, additional leaves would be inserted within another group to form, for example gatherings of 8 leaves, which similarly would be sewn through the central fold. Generally, quartos have more squarish proportions than folios or octavos.
There are variations in how quartos were produced. For example, bibliographers call a book printed as a quarto (four leaves per full sheet), but bound in gatherings of 8 leaves each, a "quarto in 8s."
The actual size of a quarto book depends on the size of the full sheet of paper on which it was printed. A demy quarto (abbreviated demy 4to) is a chiefly British term, referring to a book size of about , a medium quarto , a royal quarto , and a small quarto equalled a square octavo, all untrimmed.
The earliest surviving books printed by movable type by Gutenberg are quartos which were printed before the Gutenberg Bible. The earliest known one is a fragment of a medieval poem called the Sibyllenbuch, believed to have been printed by Gutenberg in 1452–53. Quartos were the most common format of books printed in the incunabula period (books printed before 1501). The British Library Incunabula Short Title Catalogue currently lists about 28,100 different editions of surviving books, pamphlets and broadsides (some fragmentary only) printed before 1501, of which about 14,360 are quartos, representing just over half of all works in the catalogue.
Quarto as size.
Beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, technology permitted the manufacture of large sheets or rolls of paper on which books were printed, many text pages at a time. As a result, it may be impossible to determine the actual format (i.e., number of leaves formed from each sheet fed into a press). The term "quarto" as applied to such books may refer simply to the size, i.e., books that are approximately 12 inches (30 cm) tall.
Quartos for separate plays and poems.
During the Elizabethan era and through the mid-seventeenth century, plays and poems were commonly printed as separate works in quarto format. Eighteen of Shakespeare's 36 plays included in first folio collected edition of 1623, were previously separately printed as quartos, with a single exception that was printed in octavo. For example, Shakespeare's "Henry IV, Part 1," the most popular play of the era, was first published as a quarto in 1598, with a second quarto edition in 1599, followed by a number of subsequent quarto editions. Bibliographers have extensively studied these different editions, which they refer to by abbreviations such as Q1, Q2, etc. The texts of some of the Shakespeare quartos are highly inaccurate and are full of errors and omissions. Bibliographer Alfred W. Pollard named those editions Bad quartos, and it is speculated that they may have been produced, not from manuscript texts, but from actors who had memorized their lines.
Other playwrights in this period also published their plays in quarto editions. Christopher Marlowe's "Doctor Faustus", for example, was published as a quarto in 1604 (Q1), with a second quarto edition in 1609. The same is true of poems, Shakespeare's poem "Venus and Adonis" being first printed as a quarto in 1593 (Q1), with a second quarto edition (Q2) in 1594.
In Spanish culture, a similar concept of separate editions of plays is known as "comedia suelta".

Aslam Jairajpuri

Aslam Jairajpuri (Urdu:علامہ اسلم جیراجپوری) was a scholar of Qur'an, Hadith, and Islamic history who is best known for his books "Talimat-e-Qur'an" and "History of Qur'an. He was Distinguished Professor of Arabic and Persian at Aligarh Muslim University and Jamia Millia Islamia. He was born on 27 January 1882 in Jairajpur, Azamgarh, in Uttar Pradesh, India, and died on 28 December 1955 in Delhi.
Early life.
His father, Salamtullah Jairajpuri (1850–1904) was a member of Ahl-e-Hadith movement (not the Ahl-e-Hadith sect), hence Allama Aslam's house at his birth, was a city center for Ahl-e-Hadith ullema. After his birth his father was asked by Nawab Siddik Hasan Khan (نواب صدیق حسن خان) to take the chair of presidency of Madrisah Vakfiah in Bhopal, which he took whilst his son stayed behind in Jairajpur. For his infancy years he was mostly raised by his maternal parents, which made him closer to the two.
His father sent him to the maktab (school) at the age of five. This school was just next to Allama Aslam's house in Jairajpur. Next year his father took him and his mother to Bhopal and enrolled him to memorize the Qur'an. After memorizing Qur'an he learned Mathematics, Persian, Fiqh and Arabic. The subject of Tafsir was taught by his own father. Aslam also learned the martial arts of Bana, Bank, Banot and shooting.
In his early years, with his friend Tauqeer al-Hasan (توقیر الحسن), after research and discussion regarding the reason of tradition (تقلید) for a long time, these two scholars came to the conclusion that according to principles of Fiqh, i.e. Muslim Jurisprudence,the laws can be changed and amended according to the time and necessity.
After finishing the education, in 1903 Aslam Jairajpuri joined Paisa Newspaper in Lahore, as a translator.Next year in June 1904 he received the letter regarding his father's illness and he hurried back to Bhopal. Next day his father died. It was 15 June 1904 / 30 Rabi-ul-Avval 1322.
In 1904 Aslam met with Maulvi Abdullah Chakralvi (مولوی عبداللہ چکڑالوی). When he heard that he did not believe in all hadith but after a discussion of three hours he was not able to convince Allama Aslam of his own ideas. Even after this, Aslam kept searching about the true place of hadith in Islam.
Professor at Aligarh Muslim University.
In 1906 Aslam came to Aligarh College and for six years taught Arabic and Persian at college level. In 1912 he was put in charge of the Eastern section of the Litton Library of the college where he cataloged the books. When the college turned into Aligarh Muslim University, he was made the professor of Arabic and Persian.
This was around 1912 when he was in Aligarh Muslim University, that which he wrote "Talemat-e-Koran."
Professor at Jamia Millia Islamia.
See also Jamia Millia Islamia
At the insistence of Maulana Mohammad Ali, he left the job, joined Jamia Millia Islamia where he taught history of Islam, hadith, and Qur'an. He wrote many scholarly articles in the journal "Jamia" of the Jamia Millia Islamia. He was so famous in this Jamia, (University), for his knowledge and scholarship, that if someone uttered the only word Mualana, (Arabic name for doctor or scholar), all the persons understood that he meant Mualana Aslam Jairajpuri.
He was also a regular contributor of The Journal Tolu-e-Islam. He was also a friend and fan of Muhammad Iqbal, and visited him many time. Muhammad Iqbal had a great respect for him due to his scholarship of Qur'an.
His meeting with Ghulam Ahmed Pervez.
See also Ghulam Ahmed Pervez
Ghulam Ahmed Pervez respected him. It was in 1930, when he, Ghulam Ahmed Pervez, (aged 27 years at that time), read one of his article in this journal, and was so impressed by him, that he requested him for an appointment, and thereafter he became his disciple and friend. Maulana Aslam Jairajpuri also wrote introduction for the first edition of "Ma'arf Qur'an" written by Ghulam Ahmed Pervez. After the emergence of Pakistan Maulana Aslam Jairajpuri, who lived in Delhi, visited Pakistan at the request of Ghulam Ahmed Pervez, and stayed at his home in Karachi. Afterwards Ghulam Ahmed Pervez published his many books including "Tareekh-al-Ummat", "Novadrat" from his publication house "Idara Tolu-e-Islam".
Qur'an and hadith.
The question of status of Qur'an and Hadith in the Islamic history is a complex one. Maulana Aslam Jairajpuri also solved this subject in his many books.Though was doing fine in his practical world, but in his spiritual world he was still haunted by only one subject, namely: the position of Hadith in Islam. This he ultimately solved and in his own words, "When Allah showed me the facts of Qur'an at that point I came to know the position of hadith in Qur'an, which is history of Islam. To consider the hadith as Islam is not correct. If they were in Islam, then Muhammad would also have left a written manuscript of these, like he did in case of Qur'an. For Islam, Qur'an is enough which is a complete book and in which Islam has been finalized."
However this position regarding hadith is in contradiction with its historically accepted status among majority school of thoughts.
Works.

Louis Lusky (May 15, 1915 – January 4, 2001) was an American legal scholar. Considered a pioneer in the field of civil rights law, he was the Betts Professor of Law at Columbia Law School, where he taught from 1963-86.[http://books.google.com/books?id=aUaTAAAAIAAJ&q=%22Louis+Lusky%22+betts&dq=%22Louis+Lusky%22+betts&hl=en&ei=as8ZTsOgB-G60AGd472WBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA]
A native of Louisville, Kentucky, Lusky graduated from Louisville Male High School in 1931. He later attended the University of Louisville and Columbia Law School and graduated as the highest ranking member of the Columbia Law School Class of 1937. During that time he helped draft the famous “Footnote 4” of "United States v. Carolene Products Co." (1938).

<doc id="18489984" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18489984" title="Folio">
Folio

The term "folio", from the Latin "folium" (leaf), has three interconnected but distinct meanings in the world of books and printing. It is firstly a term for a common method of arranging sheets of paper into book form, folding the sheet only once, and a term for a book made in this way. Secondly it is a general term for a sheet, leaf or page in (especially) manuscripts and old books, and thirdly an approximate term for the size of a book, and for a book of this size. 
Firstly a folio (abbreviated fo or 2°) is a book or pamphlet made up of one or more full sheets of paper, on each of which four pages of text are printed, two on each side; each sheet is then folded once to produce two leaves. Each leaf of a folio book thus is one half the size of the original sheet. Ordinarily, additional printed folio sheets would be inserted inside one another to form a group or "gathering" of leaves prior to binding the book.
Secondly "folio" is used in terms of page numbering for some books and most manuscripts that are bound but without page numbers as an equivalent of "page" (both sides), "sheet" or "leaf", using recto and verso to designate the first and second sides, and (unlike the usage in printing) disregarding whether the leaf concerned is actually physically still joined with another leaf. This usually appears abbreviated: "f26r." means the first side of the 26th leaf in a book. This will be on the right hand side of the opening of any book composed in a script that is read from left-to-right, such as Latin (as used in English), Cyrillic, or Greek, and will be opposite for books composed in a script that is read from right-to-left, such as Hebrew and Arabic.
Thirdly "folio" is also used as an approximate term for a size of book, typically about tall, and as such does not necessarily indicate the actual printing format of the books, which may even be unknown as is the case for many modern books. Other common book formats are "quarto" and "octavo", which are both also printing formats, involving two and three folds in the sheet respectively.
Famous folios (in both senses) include the Gutenberg Bible, printed in about 1455, and the First Folio collected edition of Shakespeare's plays, printed in 1623; however their actual size is rather different.
Format.
A folio (from Latin foliō, abl. of folium, leaf ) is a book or pamphlet made up of one or more full sheets of paper, on each sheet of which four pages of text are printed, two on each side; each sheet is then folded one time to produce two leaves. Each leaf of a folio book thus is one half the size of the original sheet. This contrasts with a quarto, folding each sheet twice, and octavo, folding each sheet three times. Unlike the folio, these last, and further types involving more folds, require the pages of the book to be cut open after binding, which might be done mechanically by the printer, but in historic books was often left for the reader to do with a paper-knife. 
There are variations in how folios are produced. For example, bibliographers call a book printed as a folio (two leaves per full sheet), but bound in gatherings of 8 leaves each, a "folio in 8s." 
The Gutenberg Bible was printed in about 1455 as a folio, in which four pages of text were printed on each sheet of paper, which were then folded once. The page size is 12 x 17.5 inches (307 x 445 mm), a "double folio" size. Several such folded conjugate pairs of leaves were inserted inside one another to produce the sections or gatherings, which were then sewn together to form the final book. Shakespeare's First Folio edition is printed as a folio and has a page height of 12.5 inches (320 mm), making it a rather small folio size. 
Folios were a common format of books printed in the incunabula period (books printed before 1501), although the earliest printed book, surviving only as a fragment of a leaf, is a quarto. The British Library Incunabula Short Title Catalogue currently lists about 28,100 different editions of surviving books, pamphlets and broadsides (some fragmentary only) printed before 1501, of which about 8,600 are folios, representing just over 30 percent of all works in the catalogue.
Page numbering.
In the discussion of manuscripts, a folio means a leaf with two pages, the recto being the first the reader encounters, and the verso the second. In Western books, which are read by turning the pages over from right to left, when the book is begun with the open page edges at the reader's right, the first page to be seen is "folio 1 recto", typically abbreviated to "f1 r.". When this page is turned over "f1 v." is on the left and "f2 r." on the right of the "opening", or two pages that are visible. For books in Arabic, Hebrew, Japanese and other languages, where the book is begun from the back in Western terms, with the open page edges at the reader's left, the numbering also follows the sequence in which the reader encounters.
Size.
The actual size of a folio book depends on the size of the full sheet of paper on which it was printed, and in older periods these were not standardized, so the term's meaning is only approximate. Historically, printers used a range of names such as (with approximate maximum page height): Double Elephant Folio (50 inches, 127 cm), Atlas Folio (25 inches, ca 63 cm), Elephant Folio (23 inches, ca 58 cm), Royal Folio (20 inches, ca 51 cm), Medium Folio (18 inches, ca 46 cm), Crown Folio (15 inches (ca 38 cm), and the most common). 
From the mid-nineteenth century, technology permitted the manufacture of large sheets or rolls of paper on which books were printed, many text pages at a time. As a result, it may be impossible to determine the actual format (i.e., number of leaves formed from each sheet fed into a press). The term "folio" as applied to such books may refer simply to the size, i.e., books that are approximately 15 inches (38 cm) tall.
Shakespeare folios.
From the earliest days of printing, folios were often used for expensive, prestigious volumes. In the Seventeenth Century, plays of the English Renaissance theatre were printed as collected editions in folio. Thirty-six of Shakespeare's plays, for example, were included in the First Folio collected edition of 1623, which was followed by additional folio editions, referred to as the Second Folio, etc. Other playwrights in this period also published their plays in folio editions, such as Ben Jonson's collected works of 1616.

Pinxton South railway station

Pinxton South railway station was a former railway station that served Pinxton, Derbyshire; the station site lies within the parish of Selston, Nottinghamshire. It was opened by the Great Northern Railway (Great Britain) as "Pinxton" on its Derbyshire Extension in 1875-6 In some timetables it was listed as "Pinxton for South Normanton". It was renamed "Pinxton South" in January 1954.
Pinxton (South) station closed in January 1963 with the withdrawal of all regular passenger services beyond Awsworth Junction. At the time of this withdrawal Awsworth Junction signal box moved from 24 to 8 hour opening with the ramaining Pinxton branch freight traffic being confined to 'morning shift' working. It retained the South suffix to the end although the nearby Midland Railway Pinxton & Selston station siuated on the Pye Bridge to Kirkby-in-Ashfield line had closed to all regular passenger services many years earlier.
It was the 'Friargate' line itself that closed in to all regular passenger services in September 1964 although this remained open for freight traffic throughout for a few more years.

Ambulatory care nursing

Ambulatory care nursing is characterized by rapid, focused assessments of patients, long-term nurse/patient/family relationships and teaching and translating prescriptions for care into doable activities for patients and their caregivers.
Ambulatory care nurses work in outpatient settings, responding to high volumes of patients in short term spans while dealing with issues that are not always predictable. The specialty spans all populations of patients, and care ranges from wellness/prevention to illness and support of the dying.
The American Academy of Ambulatory Care Nursing (AAACN) is the specialty nursing association of professional nurses who identify ambulatory care practice as an essential to the continuum of high-quality, cost-effective health care. Its mission is to advance the art and science of ambulatory care nursing. The Core Curriculum for Ambulatory Care Nursing; 2nd Edition, represents a major effort toward that goal.
AAACN (formerly the American Academy of Ambulatory Nursing Administration) was founded in 1978 as a non-profit education forum. In 1993, the organization's name was changed to the American Academy of Ambulatory Care Nursing. Membership was broadened to include nurses in direct practice, education and research roles, as well as those in management and administration.
The official newsletter is AAACN Viewpoint.

Grapico

Grapico is a caffeine free, artificially flavored carbonated soft drink with a purple color and a grape taste that is sold in the Southeastern United States. When introduced in 1914, the product quickly became a success, which in part was due to implying that Grapico contained real grape juice even though it did not. In the spring of 1926, J. Grossman's Sons sold the Grapico business to New Orleans business Pan American Manufacturing Co. Pan American continued J. Grossman's Sons' improper practice of implying that Grapico contained real grape juice and lost the right to use the word "Grapico" to designate their artificial grape drink in 1929.
Although the J. Grossman's Sons line of the brand had ended, the Grapico brand continued on through Alabama businessman R. R. Rochell and his Birmingham, Alabama based Grapico Bottling Works. R. R. Rochell had first become a wholesale syrup customer of J. Grossman's Sons in the Summer of 1917 to serve the Alabama soft drink market. By the time Pan American had lost their artificial grape drink name in 1929, Rochell was selling bottled Grapico in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, and Louisiana.
Rochell received the federal trademark on Grapico in 1940, giving his Grapico Company of America the right to use the name "Grapico" everywhere in the United States. In 1955, Grapico Company of America attempted to expand its fruit flavored brands with Orangico, a sister product to Grapico that included real orange juice. The orange juice based Orangico did not sell well and the federal trademark eventually expired. In September 1981, both the franchising rights to the Grapico brand name and The Pepsi Bottling Group in Newnan, Georgia were acquired by Buffalo Rock, an independent Pepsi bottler based in Birmingham, Alabama. Buffalo Rock revived the Orangico trademark in 1999 for an artificially flavored orange drink and introduced Diet Grapico in 2005. Grapico is presently produced at Buffalo Rock's Columbus, Georgia bottling facility, Sun Fresh Beverages, Inc.
History.
Grapico was first sold in 1914 in New Orleans, Louisiana by J. Grossman's Sons. In the Summer of 1917, businessman R. R. Rochell and his Birmingham, Alabama based Grapico Bottling Works purchased Grapico syrup barrels from J. Grossman's Sons and bottled and sold Grapico to the Alabama soft drink market. Present Grapico distributor Buffalo Rock, an independent Pepsi bottler based in Birmingham, Alabama, purchased the Grapico business in 1981. The J. Grossman's Sons' Grapico retail sales line ended in 1929 and the present Grapico traces its roots to the Summer of 1917 in Birmingham, Alabama through R. R. Rochell's Grapico.
J. Grossman's Sons' Grapico.
J. Grossman's Sons was a business that had been operating in New Orleans, Louisiana since at least 1884. By the early 1900s, the business was being run by both Adolph Grossman and Isidore Grossman. Prior to developing Grapico, J. Grossman's Sons served as creditors. In 1905 for example, a collection attorney successfully sued J. Grossman's Sons to recover legal fees for reducing to judgment a debt of $875 owed to J. Grossman's Sons. Also in 1905, J. Grossman's Sons unsuccessfully prevented the sale of their securing collateral, a debtor's home, to the debtor's daughter. In January 1912, J. Grossman's Sons lent $1000 to a Lewisburg, Louisiana saloon owner who they successfully sued eleven months later to recover the amount against his real estate.
J. Grossman's Sons began manufacturing Grapico in 1914. At that time, Grapico consisted of a syrup that, when mixed with soda water, had the taste, smell, and color of a genuine grape drink. The product was artificially colored and flavored with only an infinitesimal amount of grape juice or fruit of the grape.
Prior to 1916, J. Grossman's Sons contacted American jazz composers Peter DeRose and Ivan Reid to write a song about Grapico. DeRose, who would later be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, produced the piano accompanied song, "Meet Me in the Land of Grapico". "Meet Me in the Land of Grapico" is a sentimental ballad from Tin Pan Alley that imagined a faraway Land of Grapico where love lives forever. The song ("see below") and its cover sheet alluded to a grape vine-covered arbor in the Land of Grapico, even though Grapico contained no grape juice. Dedicating the song to all the drinkers of Grapico, J. Grossman's Sons published the song in 1916 and provided it free on request.
In the Summer of 1917, businessman R. R. Rochell and his Birmingham, Alabama based Grapico Bottling Works began purchasing Grapico syrup barrels from J. Grossman's Sons to bottle and sell the Alabama soft drink market. In that same year, Laurel, Mississippi based Grapico Bottling Company also became a wholesale customer of J. Grossman's Sons and began bottling and selling Grapico in Mississippi. In 1918, Rochell's Grapico Bottling Works opened a bottling plant in Hattiesburg, Mississippi as a second Mississippi bottler and seller of Grapico.
By 1919, Grapico manufacturer J. Grossman's Sons was successful enough in their efforts to distribute Grapico that they awarded the Grapico advertising account to the Chambers Agency, Inc. of New Orleans. As early as November 1919, businessman J. C. Kramer was doing business in Louisiana under the name of the Grapico Bottling Works (Louisiana), a business unconnected with Rochell's Grapico Bottling Works.
In 1920, the demand for soft drinks significantly increased as a result of the prohibition against alcohol in the United States that began on January 29, 1920. The Grapico product was so successful by 1920, that Grapico specifically was listed in the Louisiana law among generic items, Coca-Cola, and RC Cola as items to be taxed: Section 22 of Act No. 233 of 1920, which read:That all persons, associations of persons, firms and corporations engaged in the sale of soda water, ice cream, confections, soda pop, Coca Cola, Chero-Cola, Grapico or other similar soft drinks or beverages or refreshments, shall pay license based on the gross annual sales, and such licenses are hereby fixed and graded as follows.
In addition to experiencing taxes as a result of its success, the Grapico efforts found labor troubles. In 1920, the International Union of United Brewery, Flour, Cereal, Soft Drink and Distillery Workers presented Grapico Bottling Company (Mississippi) with a union agreement. When the company refused to sign the agreement, the 112 employees at Grapico Bottling Company were called to strike. The Grapico Bottling Co. eventually signed the agreement.
In June 1922, Grapico Bottling Works furthered the connection between the artificially flavored beverage and real grape juice through an advertisement campaign. On June 1, 1922, The Jacksonville Metropolis published a Grapico Bottling Works advertisement announcing a ten-day writing contest that offered US$116 in prize money for essays on why a consumer would prefer "Sparkling Grapico" over real, fresh grapes. The advertisement indicated that Grapico was made from Pure Grape Juice with pure sugar and carbonated water and had no coloring or preservatives. Although not true, this information was consistent with the Grapico product labels used by J. Grossman's Sons on the barrels that were shipped to and received by R. R. Rochell.
Mississippi based Grapico Bottling Company troubles did not end with its union problems. In September 1924, John Henry Ennis of Ellisville, Mississippi purchased a Grapico. On drinking it, Ennis discovered that the contents were filled with filthy flies, some of which he swallowed and became sick. On filing a lawsuit against Grapico Bottling Company and its sole stockholder, Philip Carriere, Ennis learned that Grapico Bottling Company had filed for and successfully dissolved itself as a corporation between the time Ennis consumed the flies and filed suit against Grapico Bottling. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Mississippi issued an opinion that serve as precedent in Mississippi for the rule that a stockholder of a corporation is not liable for the debts, liabilities, and other acts of the corporation. After Grapico Bottling Company (Mississippi) dissolved in 1925, Rochell's Grapico Bottling Works became the sole supplier of Grapico to Mississippi.
Unfair competition through deceptive advertising.
Since almost its inception in 1914, Grapico was associated with real grape juice by J. Grossman's Sons through its advertisements and business stationery. Publicly associating Grapico with genuine grape juice allowed J. Grossman's Sons to compete directly with real grape juice producers such as Welch Grape Juice Co. and have an advantage over other imitation grape flavored beverage producers. A problem with this approach was that Grapico was an artificial grape drink that included neither real grape juice nor fruit from the grape.
In May 1926, J. Grossman's Sons became a defunct corporation and sold its Grapico formula and all rights connected to that formula to Pan American Manufacturing Co., Inc., a Louisiana corporation that had been manufacturing and selling extracts, ice cream powder, and syrups and flavors for soft drinks from New Orleans since 1911. Pan American began manufacturing Grapico syrup and concentrate and continued supplying its wholesale customers outside of Louisiana with one-gallon bottles of concentrated Grapico to allow them to make Grapico. In addition, through its subsidiary corporation, World Bottling Co., Pan American continued supplying its retail customers in Louisiana with bottled Grapico for consumption. At the time Pan American acquired the Grapico business, it had three wholesale Grapico customers: Rochell's Grapico Bottling Works in Birmingham, Alabama and two bottling plants operating in Mississippi. Grapico concentrate was sold by Pan American to its wholesale customers for $7.50 per gallon and the finished bottled Grapico was by sold by Pan American and its three wholesale customers at 5 cents per 7-oz bottle.
Pan American continued associating their artificial grape drink with real grape juice in advertisements in trade periodicals, display cards, newspapers, boys' caps for customers' use, and in its company stationery. Typically, advertising material displayed images of grape vineyards and bunches of grapes together with the qualifying statements:
Sparkling
Grapico
Naturally Good
Acknowledged
The Best
Grape Drink
On The Market
Sparkling
Grapico
Naturally Good
The Drink of The Nation
In addition, Pan American continued J. Grossman's Sons practice of using 7-oz clear bottles with molded labels prominently featuring a pictorial representation of a bunch of grapes with word "Grapico". Given that the product was artificially colored and flavored to simulate the appearance, taste and smell of grape juice, the combination of the advertisements, the bottle grape bunch mold, and the product itself implied to others that the Grapico product was composed of pure grape juice.
In July 1928, the Federal Trade Commission charged Pan American with unfair methods of competition and deceptive practices. After learning of the Federal Trade Commission complaint, Pan American altered the labels it used on its one-gallon concentrate jugs. However, the efforts were too little, too late and Pan American and its "representatives, agents, servants, employees, and successors" lost the right to use the word "Grapico" to designate their artificial grape drink as of 1929. Pan American's wholesale customers, including R. R. Rochell, were seen as victims of Pan American's unfair competition and the cease and desist order regarding the Grapico name did not extend to them.
R. R. Rochell's Grapico.
R. R. Rochell was a successful business man operating in Birmingham, Alabama. His success came despite the fact that he was . He was one of two major stock holders in the Edgewood Amusement Company, which dissolved in 1924. Rochell began selling bottled Grapico in Alabama in 1917 and then in Mississippi in 1918. In June 1920, Rochell's Grapico Bottling Works formally incorporated in Alabama as "The Grapico Bottling Works".
Rochell's early Grapico efforts were not without problems. For example, in November 1921, Grapico Bottling Works acquired a US$648 Baltimore Semi-Automatic Machine, Model B-1485 from New Orleans based Crown Cork and Seal Co. to cork and seal soda water bottles. Within three months, the bottle capper began to fail. Frequently, the neck of the moving bottles became stuck in the machine, which additionally broke bottles whose contents drenched workers. In addition, the caps made by the machine did not seal properly so that carbonation gas escaped from the Grapico bottles. After Grapico refused to pay the US$358 balance, the Sheriff seized the bottling machine from Grapico. The matter was resolved 3½ years later by the Louisiana First Circuit Court of Appeal, who set aside the machine sales contract so that Grapico Bottling Works no longer owed the balance.
By 1922, R. R. Rochell's Grapico had been expanded into the Florida soft drink market. With Grapico Bottling Company (Mississippi) dissolved in 1925 and Pan American prohibited from using the name "Grapico" in connection with the Grapico artificial grape drink, Rochell became the sole supplier of bottled Grapico in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, and Louisiana in 1929.
In 1938, R. R. Rochell was doing business in Alabama as "Orange Crush 7-Up Bottling Company." At that time, it cost .44312 cents to produce a case of Grapico at Rochell's plant in Birmingham and to deliver that same case approximately away cost .32734 cents, making a total cost of approximately .77 cents per case to deliver a case of soft drinks to the areas surrounding Birmingham. The product was sold at .80 a case, for a .03 cent profit per case.
Just before he died in early 1940, R. R. Rochell filed for a federal trademark on Grapico on behalf of Orange Crush 7-Up Bottling Company. The federal trademark issued just after Rochell. secured the national rights to the Grapico mark to the Orange Crush 7-Up Bottling Company. In that same year, Grapico was sold using the trademarked slogan, "The Drink of the Nation • Made its Way by the Way its Made."
In June 1947, Rochell's business began using the names "The Grapico Bottling Company" and "The Grapico Company of America." In October 1949, "The Grapico Bottling Company" name was changed to "Orange Crush 7 Up Bottling Company" to reflect the work it was doing in Alabama on behalf of the Seven-up Company. Despites the Alabama company's efforts, the Seven-up Company refused to grant The Grapico Company of America a bottling franchise to handle Seven-up soft drinks. The business was operating as Orange Crush-Grapico Bottling Company by 1953. In July 1957, the bottling business name was officially changed to "Orange Crush Grapico Company."
In 1955, Grapico Company of America expanded its fruit flavored brands into orange with Orangico, a play on the name Grapico. Orangico was to include real orange juice. The orange juice based Orangico did not sell well and the federal trademark eventually expired in 1999.
In September 1981, both the franchising rights to the Grapico brand name and The Pepsi Bottling Group in Newnan, Georgia were acquired by Buffalo Rock, an independent Pepsi bottler founded in Birmingham, Alabama in 1901. Both Buffalo Rock and R.R. Rochell's businesses were located in Birmingham since the early 1900s. For example, in October 1940, R.R. Rochell's business was located at 1031 11th Avenue North and Buffalo Rock's business was located at 10th Avenue and 26th Street North -- a distance of about three miles (5 km).
Between at least 1981 and 1988, Grapico was distributed in only three states: Alabama, Florida and Georgia. In August 1988, Buffalo Rock announced that they would expand distribution of Grapico the rest of the Southeastern United States. The announcement coincided with the new, more contemporary Grapico packaging. By June 1990, Grapico was being sold in South Carolina.
Buffalo Rock revived the Orangico trademark in 1999, this time to be used on an artificial orange syrup rather than a real orange based drink. Buffalo Rock introduced Diet Grapico in 2005. Grapico presently is produced by Buffalo Rock through its Columbus, Georgia bottling facility, Sun Fresh Beverages, Inc.
In popular culture.
Grapico is mentioned in "Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Cafe," 1987 best selling novel by Fannie Flagg. Anne George's 1996 novel "Murder on a Bad Hair Day: A Southern Sisters Mystery," and the 2004 novel "Making Waves" by Cassandra King, Grapico mixed with Absolut Peppar jalapeño flavored vodka is a drink called the Ex-girlfriend. It's called the Ex-girlfriend because "it's sweet and seems like a good idea, but eventually it's going to burn you and make you sick."

Stretton and Claymills railway station

Stretton and Claymills railway station is a former railway station in Stretton, near Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire.
History.
The station was opened by the North Staffordshire Railway in 1901.
The line itself dated back to 1848, and from 1878, was shared by the Great Northern Railway with its Derbyshire Extension. Although the correct name is "Clay Mills", both companies referred to it as one word. 
The station was built of timber throughout. There was a small booking office, and general and ladies’ waiting rooms on the main platform, with an open-fronted shelter on the other. Access was by inclined ramps from the road way outside. The LMS rebuilt the platforms in concrete, halving them to 150 foot.
The station closed in 1949 but remained intact until it was demolished in 1964. The preceding station, Horninglow, also closed in 1949 but continued to be used by occasional excursion trains, but it is not known if this was the case with Stretton. Goods traffic continued to use the line until 1966. 
Present day.
The track has since been removed, and the way hard-surfaced to make the 'Jinnie Trail'. The station master's house has been a private dwelling since the line closed.

Mirandornithes

Mirandornithes (name coined by Sangster (2005)) is a clade that consists of flamingos and grebes. 
Determining the relationships of both groups has been problematic. Flamingos had been placed with numerous branches within Neognathae, such as ducks and storks. The grebes had been placed with the loons. However recent studies seem to confirm these two branches as sister groups.
Both primitive phoenicopteriformes and their closest relatives, the grebes, were highly aquatic. This indicates that the entire mirandornithe group evolved from aquatic, probably swimming ancestors.

Landenberg Bridge

The Landenberg Bridge is a truss bridge carrying Landenberg Road across the White Clay Creek in Landenberg, Pennsylvania.
The bridge was originally built by the Schuylkill Bridge Company of Phoenixville, Pennsylvania in 1899, using the stone abutments from an earlier (1871) bridge. The 1899 bridge was a Pratt pony truss design, with an unusual cantilevered sidewalk along the north side of the bridge.
Because of its architectural features, the Landenberg Bridge was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. However, a PennDOT inspection in the summer of 1999 found that the bridge had undergone serious structural deterioration, and it was immediately closed to traffic. Due to local opposition to widening the bridge, replacement did not begin until 2009, after a compromise was reached to reuse elements of the old bridge in the replacement span and to construct the new span no wider than the roadway. Doing this meant that New Garden Township had to agree to assume control of maintaining the bridge from PennDOT, due to the bridge being narrower than what state design specifications required. The bridge was removed from the National Register of Historic Places on March 23, 2010 as the truss system changed from being functional on the original span to ornamental on the new span, which is a simple concrete beam bridge. The new span opened to traffic on July 25, 2010.

The musical style of "In The County Of Kings" is more country-sounding than any previous Eric Stuart Band album, and is described by Eric Stuart as "Concrete Country." With regard to this, Stuart writes,
I was trying to come up with a way to explain the type of music I play. Americana was too rootsy, Folk-Rock only touched on a part of my sound and County/Rock made it sound like I wore a cowboy hat. I am born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, but I play music with a strong lyrical, melodic, story based approach. There are many country elements as well. I thought the combination of "Concrete" to connect with the sidewalks and buildings I grew up around as well as the rock connotations that word brings plus the "Country" would show I was touching on string songwriting and storytelling that went with country music.
"In The County Of Kings" includes a re-release of Stuart's songs "The Bottom Line" (1996, from the album "Picture Perfect World"), and "Paint the Town Tonight" (2000, from the album "BombShellShocked"). The album also incorporates more guest musicians than in previous ESB albums. Stuart sings with his sister Barbara Brousal in "The Land Of What Might Have Been." Not all the songs call in numerous accompaniments however; in "This Love," Stuart is only accompanied by band members Jenna Malizia (background vocals) and Questar Welsh (background vocals and keyboards).

Peter Browne (Mayflower passenger)

In records of the time, his name was either Peter Browne or Peter Brown.
Peter Browne (c.1594–1633), was a passenger on the historic 1620 voyage of the "Mayflower" and was a signatory of the Mayflower Compact. 
Life in England.
Browne was baptized on January 26, 1594/5 in Dorking, Surrey, England. This was the same home town as other "Mayflower" passengers – the Mullins family.
Peter Browne was a son of William Brown of Dorking. He had two older siblings, Jane and Thomas, as well as three younger brothers, Samuel, John and James. In or about 1605, when Peter was about ten years of age, his father died and the children may have been sent to family members and friends under apprenticeships. A local weaver probably apprenticed the three youngest sons in that line of work.
Browne may have heard of the proposed "Mayflower" voyage from his relationship with the Mullins family. William Mullins was a shoe and boot maker in Dorking and was one of Londoners who was later involved in the financial support of the "Mayflower" voyage. Peter’s sister Jane had married John Hammon in Docking in 1610 and her mother-in-law, Jane Hammon, had appointed William Mullins as her estate administrator. Also, John Hammon’s sister Susan married Ephraim Bothell, who purchased William Mullins property and home before he and his family boarded the "Mayflower".
On the "Mayflower".
The relationship between Peter Browne and the Mullins family in Dorking did seem quite close. As a single man of about age twenty-five, and possibly coming from an apprenticeship, he boarded the "Mayflower" in the company of the Mullins family. But unfortunately these ties were to be broken with the death of William Mullins, his wife Alice and son Joseph soon after arrival in the New World.
The "Mayflower" departed Plymouth, England on September 6/16, 1620. The small, 100-foot ship had 102 passengers and a crew of about 30-40 in extremely cramped conditions. By the second month out, the ship was being buffeted by strong westerly gales, causing the ship‘s timbers to be badly shaken with caulking failing to keep out sea water, and with passengers, even in their berths, lying wet and ill. This, combined with a lack of proper rations and unsanitary conditions for several months, attributed to what would be fatal for many, especially the majority of women and children. On the way there were two deaths, a crew member and a passenger, but the worst was yet to come after arriving at their destination when, in the space of several months, almost half the passengers perished in cold, harsh, unfamiliar New England winter.
On November 9/19, 1620, after about 3 months at sea, including a month of delays in England, they spotted land, which was Cape Cod. And after several days of trying to get south to their planned destination of the Colony of Virginia, strong winter seas forced them to return to the harbor at the Cape Cod hook, where they anchored on November 11/21. Realizing they were not at the intended destination they determined to bind themselves as a democratically governed and administered colony loyal to England. This document became known as the Mayflower Compact and was signed by all eligible men on behalf of themselves, their families, their fortunes and property.
Peter Browne was one of the men who signed the Mayflower Compact.” 
In Plymouth Colony.
An interesting incident (from Mourt’s Relations pg 27) regarding Peter Browne took place in January 1621 while the Pilgrims were building their settlement of Plymouth. On January 12 Peter Browne, John Goodman and others had entered the forest some distance from the Pilgrim plantation in order to find material for roofing thatch. Sometime around noon, Browne and Goodman wandered further into the forest while the other men stayed behind to make up the thatch into bundles. After these men had done that work, they tried to locate Browne and Goodman in the forest, but they could not be found. These men went to the settlement and informed others that the men could not be located. This caused about 10-12 armed men to search for them, in fear they were captured by Indians. As it happened, Browne and Goodman were eating lunch when their dogs starting chasing a deer and they were soon lost. According to records, “they wandered all that afternoon being wet, and at night it did freeze and snow, they were slenderly appareled and had no weapons but each one sickle.” At night they thought they heard “lions” in the forest and climbed a tree for shelter. They stayed by the tree that night in case they had to escape to safety. The next day they finally climbed the highest hill they could find, were able to see their harbor and find their way back to the settlement. After the searchers had given up hope of finding them, Browne and Goodman finally arrived in Plymouth quite cold, forest-bitten, tired and hungry, having survived their first experience alone in the New England forest.
In the Plymouth settlement of 1620, the house of Peter Browne was near that of John Goodman and was close to the harbor on the south side of the village street. John Goodman is listed as having been alive at least on January 19, 1621 and is noted as having not survived that first winter, but his name does appear in records of the 1623 Division of Land and he may have died sometime after that.
In the 1623 Division of Land, as a single man, Peter Browne received one “aker” of land “these lye on the South side of the brooke to the baywards.” In that record, his name appears as “Peter Browen.”
Sometime after the Division of Land, Peter Browne married the widow Martha Ford, arriving in November 1621 on the ship Fortune as the only recorded woman on board. Her husband ______ Ford apparently died on the voyage or just after arrival. Martha gave birth to a son the day of arrival but he died soon after. Per Banks, Mourt’s Relations (p. 63) records this event: “the good wife Ford was delivered of a sonne the first night shee landed, and both of them are very well.” 
Widow Martha Ford received four lots (shares) in the 1623 Division of Land, to which she was entitled by this family count. In those records, she is listed as “Widow Foord.”
In 1626 Peter Browne was one of twenty-seven Purchasers involved with the colony joint-stock company which afterwards was turned over to the control of senior colony members. That group was called Undertakers, and were made up of such as Bradford, Standish and Allerton initially who were later joined by Winslow, Brewster, Howland, Alden, Prence and others from London, former Merchant Adventurers. On the agreement, dated October 26, 1626, his name appears as Peter Browne.
By the time of the 1627 Division of the Cattle, Peter Browne and his wife Martha had a daughter Mary and was pregnant with another daughter, Priscilla. Also in the family were children from Mary Browne’s first marriage, John and Martha Ford. The two Ford children shared in the 1627 division of the cattle. The “eaight lot” of the Division under ‘Samuell ffuller”, consisted of the “Peeter Browne” family listed as “Peeter Browne, Martha Browne, Mary Browne, John fford, Martha fford.”
His wife Martha died about 1630, and Peter Browne remarried to a woman named Mary _____ whose surname and ancestry have not been discovered. With the second wife, Peter Browne had two more children, Rebecca, about 1631, and another child about 1633, name and gender unknown, who may have died as a youth.
On the 1633 Tax List he was recorded as Peter Browne.
On January 1, 1633, Browne was fined three shillings by Plymouth Colony Court for failing to appear at the court session and on January 2 was fined by the court in the same amount for the same reason. When he did appear in court on January 7, he was sued by fellow "Mayflower" passenger Dr. Samuel Fuller for “divers accounts…wherein they differ.” They were sent to arbitration, the outcome of which is not known. Also in 1633, he appeared on the Tax List for that year as “Peter Browne.”
Marriages and Children.
Peter Browne married:
Children of Martha _____ and her first husband, ______ Ford:
Children of Peter and Martha Browne:
A deed dated October 27, 1647 notes that Ephraim Tinkham and wife Mary sold to Henry Sampson land in Duxbury which was one-third of the land belonging to Peter Brown, deceased.
Children of Peter and Mary Browne:
Peter Browne, death, estate and burial.
Peter Brown had health issues which became serious in late 1632. He died later in 1633, possibly in early fall from a probable infectious disease. The inventory of his assets was taken on October 10, 1633. He had apparently been attended to by Dr.Samuel Fuller and his inventory shows a debt by Browne’s widow of Dr. Samuel Fuller for one peck of malt and some purgative, and a debt for “letting her man bleed.” His estate also owed Kenelm, brother of "Mayflower" passenger Edward Winslow, twelve shillings for building his coffin. Browne’s estate inventory detailed such as grain, animals, a firearm, tools, household goods, clothing, etc.. Ironically, his attending doctor Samuel Fuller also died from the same disease at that time, as did fellow Mayflower passenger Francis Eaton and others.
Following Browne’s death, his widow Mary was made administrator of his estate on November 11, 1633. She was ordered by the court to pay 15 pounds to John Doane to assume custody of Browne’s daughter Mary and the same amount to William Gilson for the custody of Browne’s daughter Priscilla with the court placing Mary with Doane for nine years and Priscilla with Gilson for twelve years until both were age seventeen. Mary retained custody of her two children by her first husband and was allowed the rest of Browne’s estate for her own third for raising her own two children.
At age seventeen, Mary and Priscilla Browne asked the Plymouth Court to assign their custody over to their uncle, John Browne, a weaver then residing in Duxbury. Browne was a brother of their father Peter Browne.
Peter Browne died shortly before October 10, 1633, when the after-death inventory of his property was taken. His death was not recorded in the records of Plymouth County. Both he and his first wife Martha were both buried at Burial Hill in Plymouth.

Ron Obvious (Monty Python)

Ron Obvious is a Monty Python character played by Terry Jones, appearing in a sketch in episode 10, 'Untitled', of the first series.
In the sketch, the extremely naïve Ron Obvious, encouraged by his unscrupulous manager Luigi Vercotti (Michael Palin), undertakes several impossible tasks for publicity, in this order:
1. Jumping the English Channel: In the opening scene, Ron Obvious from Neepsend is shown running along the seashore in a track and field uniform. The announcer (John Cleese) says that Obvious hopes to become the first man to jump the Channel, and will be landing in the center of Calais itself. The scene momentarily cuts away to a group of Frenchmen standing under a sign that reads "Fin de Cross Channel Jump" as traditional accordion music plays in the background. When asked how he plans to jump 26 miles (since Obvious's longest jump is almost twelve feet (unofficially)), he says that "You see if you're five miles out over the English Channel, with nothing but sea underneath you, there is a very great impetus to stay in the air." Obvious has his passport checked by a customs officer, and carrying a 56-pound bag full of bricks that is provided by the Chippenham Brick Company, the event's sponsor, he sprints toward the sea and jumps, splashing into the water only a few feet from shore. 
2. Eating Chichester Cathedral: As the announcer mentions that Obvious is about to attempt to become the first man to eat an entire Anglican Cathedral, Obvious is shown brushing his teeth, putting on a bib and flexing his jaws, before biting into the corner of an old stone building and breaking his jaw.
3. Tunnelling to Java: Vercotti shows a map illustrating the route Obvious will use while digging his way from Godalming to Java, which should make Obvious a household name overnight. When the announcer asks him where Obvious is, after a couple of evasive answers Vercotti yells, "Ron, how far have you got?" Obvious sticks his head out of a very shallow hole and replies, "Oh, about two foot six," and inquires if there is a spade he can use.
4. Splitting a railway carriage with his nose: Vercotti and the announcer walk along a railroad track discussing Obvious' next endeavour, and allegations that Vercotti is exploiting him. The sound of an approaching train is heard, followed by a loud scream.
5. Running to Mercury: Vercotti explains that once Obvious gets out of Earth's atmosphere and is in orbit, he should be able to run straight to Mercury. Obvious, wrapped in head-to-toe bandages from his previous exploits, is shown jumping off a wooden ramp with a crutch under his left arm. The frame freezes in mid-jump, and another loud scream is heard. 
6. Most time being Underground (Deceased): The next scene shows Ron Obvious' tombstone with the legend "Very Talented" written on it. Vercotti says that he hopes to break the world record for remaining underground.

<doc id="18490473" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18490473" title="Oxford University Dancesport Club">
Oxford University Dancesport Club

Oxford University Dancesport Club (OUDC) is one of Oxford University’s largest sports clubs. Founded in 1968 it currently has an annual membership of around 800 members. It runs professionally taught classes in the following dance styles:
Its classes are open to all (including non-university members) and cater to all levels of experience. The Club also runs occasional workshops and a weekly social dance on Sundays in full term and on some Sundays out of term.
History.
Prior to the establishment of the Oxford Ballroom Dancing Club (OBDC), (later OUBDC and still later OUDC) undergraduates at the University of Oxford were not allowed to attend the popular Brett’s dancing school in the centre of Oxford, nor attend any public dance at the Carfax Assembly Rooms, Headington Hill Hall or Town Hall. Private dancing lessons were also not permitted. In a bid to provide students at the university with an opportunity to dance a meeting was held on Wednesday May 8, 1968 at the Iffley Road Stadium for all those interested in forming a ballroom dancing club. This first meeting was attended by just over 50 people.
The Club’s first coach was Anne O’Hagan, assisted by Lexa Duckett, with the Club’s first Senior Member, Dr. Acheson, and his wife helping out where possible. The Club received its University accreditation in 1969 and by 1971 had 143 members. Initially it was a purely social dancing club – it was only later that it started running medals examinations and competitions.
The first competition in Oxford was held at Rhodes House on March 8, 1974. The competition was against Cambridge and Oxford won the competition by 106.5pts to 106pts. The judges were the Tanakas, an eminent ballroom dance couple who represented Japan. The two teams have been rivals ever since. Oxford won its first Inter Varsity Dance Competition in 1980, a year after Cambridge won their first such competition. The Club was awarded Full Blue status for women in 1997 and discretionary Full Blue status for men in 2003.
Team.
The Club's Main Team is one of the most successful university dancesport teams in the country. The Team, which usually consists of 24 couples, competes at a number of university circuit dancesport competitions during the year, including the Inter Varsity Dance Competition (IVDC) and is the reigning Inter Varsity Dance champion. In 2004 and again in 2006 it won the Intercontinental Dance Festival team match competition, a title it still holds as the competition has not been run since that date.
Each year the Team competes in a Varsity dancesport competition against Cambridge . This consists of an A-Team match, a B-Team match, a Beginners Team match and a variety of other open events. Oxford and Cambridge take it in turns to host the event. Both the A-Team (Varsity) match and the B-Team (Challenge Shield) match are contested by 9 couples from each university. Each University splits its nine couples into three groups of three couples. Each of these groups of three couples then dances against each of the three groups from the other university in each of the four dances (waltz, quickstep, cha and jive). The results from each of these nine group-to-group matches for each of the four dances are then added together to determine the winning team. The Varsity and Challenge Shield match format is extremely unusual as it requires dancers to be good at both ballroom and Latin American style dances.
Beginners team.
The Club also has a Beginners Team. This consists of dancers who have not received professional tuition in ballroom or Latin American dancing prior to the Inter Varsity Dance Competition of the previous year. There are separate Beginners events at all the University circuit dancesport competitions and the Beginners Team has its own match at the annual Oxford Cambridge Dancesport Varsity competition. In 2010 the OUDC Beginners Team won the Beginners Team competition at the Varsity match and was 2nd at the Inter Varsity Dance Competition. In 2011, the Team won the Best Beginners Team trophy at the Inter Varsity Dance Competition.
Coaches.
Bruce Richardson.
Bruce Richardson is the Club's Head Coach. As such he has ultimate responsibility for all coaching within the Club (including the employment of other coaching staff) and for all trials and selections for the Team and Beginners Team. Bruce, who was trained by ballroom dancer Guy Howard (the creator of the IDTA Ballroom Technique book) has been the Club's ballroom coach for many years and has a considerable record of success in university dancesport. Teams trained by Bruce have been victorious at the Inter Varsity Dance Competition on 11 occasions. In 2009 he reached the shortlist of three for the Ballroom, Latin and Sequence Teachers Award at the Carl Alan Awards after being nominated by his peers in recognition of the longevity of his coaching.
Neil Kelly.
Neil Kelly teaches the Club’s Latin medals classes, the competitive Latin technique classes and provides private lessons to Team members and others. Neil is also Principle of the Rubies Dance Centre.
Zoey Price.
Zoey coaches the Club’s competitive ballroom technique classes and provides ballroom private lessons to Team members. A pupil of Marcus Hilton, she is an active competitor at UK and international ballroom competitions, and, with her partner Anthony, has won the United Kingdom Closed Professional ballroom competition. She continues to teach in Reading.
Lee Williams.
Lee Williams trains the Beginners Team in Latin technique and provides private lessons to Team members and others.
Bea Prentiss.
Bea teaches the Club’s salsa and rueda classes. A specialist in Cuban style salsa she also directs the Club’s Komrades salsa display team.
Former coaches.
Former coaches include Ian Waite.
Cuppers.
The Club runs an annual inter-college dancesport competition called Cuppers. Colleges enter teams of four couples. Each couple performs one of four dances: waltz, quickstep, cha and jive. The highest scoring team wins their college the Acheson Shield. The College with the most points overall across all of the teams they enter takes home the Rob Stevens Memorial Cup. The rules of the competition require that at least one member of each partnership must be an ‘inexperienced dancer’. Hence, the success of a college depends as much on the beginners it recruits as on its established dancers.
Results.
Oxford Cambridge Dancesport Varsity match.
A Team
"(+) indicates that this couple was also best overall across Oxford and Cambridge in their respective category."

This trophy was awarded for the first time in 2010.

Whitstable Harbour railway station

Whitstable Harbour railway station was the name of three disused railway stations serving Whitstable the terminus of the Canterbury and Whitstable Railway. The line approached the harbour between Station Road and Clare Road, before curving west to the Harbour station around Tower Parade, and then the railway continued onto the harbour itself.
History.
The original C&W station was opened in 1830 on Harbour Street. The harbour itself was built by the railway company as well as extending the line into the harbour. Its principal trade in the harbour was the import of Northumberland coal.
When the South Eastern Railway took over the line they built a second station in 1846, also on the north side of Harbour Street but further east, near the entrance to the harbour where the harbour offices and public toilets now stand. A larger third station was opened south of Tower Parade in 1895 but closed to passenger trains in 1931. The line continued to carry freight traffic until 1952 but was re-opened for a few weeks in February 1953 to aid rescue work following the floods that badly affected the town. Today all evidence of the three stations have been removed, a health centre has now been built on the site of the 1895 station south of Tower Parade. Some railway fencing can be seen between Tower Parade and the harbour, and a railway logo in one of the gates. The only railway building that remains is now the Whitstable Marine showroom, which occupies the stables of the horses used for shunting wagons around the harbour.

Eugène Mage

Eugène Abdon Mage (30 July 1837 – 19 December 1869) was a French naval officer and explorer of Africa. Mage published the first detailed description of the Toucouleur Empire created by El Hadj Umar Tall.
Early life.
Abdon-Eugène Mage was born in Paris. His father, Abdon-Jean-René Mage, was head teacher of a private secondary school. His mother, Henriette Cattant, was born in Beauvais and came from a bourgeois family in northern France. At the age of 13 years Mage passed the entrance exam for the École Navale, the French Naval Academy based in Brest, France. Two years later, at the age of 15, he was assigned to the frigate "La Forte" and in December 1852 set sail for Callao in Peru, stopping at Tenerife, Rio de Janeiro, Cape Horn and Valparaiso. Over the next two years he served on several ships, transporting troops and visiting Martinique and French Guiana. In the summer of 1855, during the Crimean War, he participated in the Anglo-French blockade of the Gulf of Finland in the Baltic. He then returned to Brest and in September 1855 at the age of 18 was promoted to the rank of sub-lieutenant.
West Africa.
Mage lived as adjudicator of the General Louis Faidherbe since 1858 in West Africa (in modern Senegal). After the 1860 voyage into north Senegal and toward Tagant (in modern Mauritania) and many expeditions north along the rivers Saloum and Sine toward Gambia, in 1863 with the Marines' doctor Louis Quintin (and others) traversed Bafoulabe, Kita, Nioro and Diangounté Camara in western Mali. He arrived in February 1864 at Ségou, where he stayed for 26 months as the guest of Ahmadu Tall. It was not until early June 1866 that Mage returned to Saint Louis.
In February 1868, Mage was given command of the paddle corvette "La Gorgone". He patrolled the coast of the Iberian peninsula during 1869 and then headed back to Cherbourg. On 19 December 1869, while attempting to round the Britanny peninsula, the ship was wrecked on the Pierres Noires rocks, south of Ushant. All 93 crew were drowned and Mage's body was never recovered.
By their astronomical navigation and close attention to cartography Mage and Quintin are responsible for the first detailed map of western Sudan. Mage describes his journey in his literary works (see below).

Retekulation

Retekulation is an American developed environmental remediation process, established since the mid-eighties by United Retek Corporation (USA). The Retek Process can be simultaneously applied to a broad range of contaminated material associated with land, infrastructure and industrial waste. When utilised at its optimum, it would be applied on-site, helping its procurement redress and enhance budgetary implications associated with redevelopment hindered by soil contamination, especially from an environmental and commercial perspective.
The Retek Process mixes chemicals, reagents and binding agents in order to eliminate, modify and immobilise the hazardous physical and chemical constituent properties of the contaminated material. Its primary function is to remove the risk, protecting health and the environment by preventing migration of contaminants to human, animal, and plant receptors. The intention is that the treated material will be rendered safe for on-site or off-site reuse. Source waste can be inorganic or organic material, sludge or dredge. In short, it is stated that the process simultaneously converts multiple contaminants from hazardous waste to a re-usable product leaving no residual waste.

Jarvis Street

Jarvis Street is a north-south thoroughfare in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada, passing through some of the oldest developed areas in the city. Its alignment extends from Bloor Street in the north to Queens Quay East in the south. South of Front Street, it continues as Lower Jarvis Street. Jarvis carries much of the downtown-bound traffic that uses Mount Pleasant Road, which connects to Jarvis at Charles Street East.
The road (originally called "New Street"), originally extending only as far as Wellesley Street in the north, was created from the sale of Samuel Jarvis's (the street's namesake) estate Hazel Burn and surrounding lands in 1845 and was later developed as a residential neighbourhood for the city's rich. Major landmarks on or near Jarvis include Jarvis Collegiate Institute, Ryerson University, Rogers Building, Allan Gardens, 222 Jarvis Street, the Consulate General of Indonesia, St. Lawrence Market, and St. Lawrence Hall. Since the end of the nineteenth century, much of the wealthier population moved northward toward Rosedale.
In October 2009, Toronto City Council voted in favour of renaming the final block of Jarvis, from Charles to Bloor and running alongside the 777 Jarvis section of the Rogers Building, "Ted Rogers Way".
In 2010, Sugar Beach opened at the foot of Jarvis and Queen's Quay. This urban waterfront park features a landlocked man-made beach, the second one located in Toronto.
Bicycle Lanes.
On May 25, 2009, Toronto City Council voted 28–16 to remove the reversible centre commuter traffic lane and improve the streetscape by widening sidewalks, planting trees, installing heritage plaques, and implementing bicycle lanes.
In 2011, however, a new council voted to remove the bicycle lanes and reinstate the original configuration, instead opting for an expanded bicycle route along the parallel Sherbourne Street.
On November 17, 2012, following removal of the bicycle lanes, the reversible centre lane reopened.

Heanor (GNR) railway station

Heanor railway station was a former railway station at Heanor in Derbyshire, opened in 1891. It was the terminus of the branch from Ilkeston on the Great Northern Railway (Great Britain) Derbyshire Extension line.
It was one of two stations called "Heanor". The other had been opened by the Midland Railway the year before. It was not until 1950 that British Railways renamed them Heanor North and Heanor South. Unofficially, the station was known locally as 'Heanor Gate' to separate it from the other Heanor station before they were both officially renamed.
The GNR station closed to passenger services in 1939 and for goods in 1963. The last stationmaster was H.H. Voss, also a Derbyshire County Council Alderman who retired after 44 years service on the railway locally in October 1963.

Drill pipe

Drill pipe, is hollow, thick-walled, steel piping that is used on drilling rigs and horizontal drilling to facilitate the drilling of a wellbore and comes in a variety of sizes, strengths, and weights but are typically 30 to 33 feet in length. They are hollow to allow drilling fluid to be pumped through them, down the hole, and back up the annulus.
Because it is designed to support its own weight for combined lengths that often exceed 1 mile down into the Earth's crust, the case-hardened steel tubes are expensive, and owners spend considerable efforts to reuse them after finishing a well, replacing the drill stems with thinner walled tubular casing, tapping the natural resources of oil reservoirs. Used drill stem is often sent to a yard for inspection, sorted, and stored until new drill sites can be explored. Modified instruments similar to the spherometer are used at inspection sites to identify defects in the metallurgy, in order to prevent fracture of the drill stem during future wellboring.
Drill pipe is a portion of the overall drill string. The drill string consists of both drill pipe and the drill stem which is the tubular portion closest to the bit or downhole assembly. Drill pipe and drill stems can be differentiated in that the drill pipe is quite flexible and produced in longer segments whereas the drill stem is much more rigid and manufactured in shorter task specific segments.

Ilkeston North railway station was a railway station in Ilkeston, Derbyshire. It was opened by the Great Northern Railway (Great Britain) on its Derbyshire Extension in 1878 and closed in 1964.
History.
From Awsworth the line crossed the Erewash Valley by means of the impressive Bennerley Viaduct which has been partly preserved. It then made the climb to Ilkeston before crossing the Nut Brook towards West Hallam. At Stanton Junction lines led northwards to Heanor and southwards to Stanton Ironworks.
Ilkeston at one time had three stations, being on a branch leading from the Midland Railway's Erewash Valley Line at the third station, Ilkeston Junction and Cossall.
Present day.
Bridges have been filled in, and the station demolished. The town's 1990's Police Station has been built on its site. Some of the remaining track bed has also been built on, with the remainder forming the Cotmanhay Linear Park.

William Jarvis (Upper Canada official)

William Jarvis (September 11, 1756 – August 13, 1817) was the American-born head of the famous Jarvis family of Toronto.
Jarvis was born in Stamford, Connecticut to Samuel Jarvis, who was the town's clerk and Martha Seymour. The Jarvis family was forced to flee when his home was seized at the start of the American Revolution. His father fled to Long Island, New York, but William chose to settled further north in Upper Canada. 
William was an officer in the Queen's Rangers and served in the Revolutionary War. In early Toronto politics, Jarvis was a member of the Family Compact. He was appointed Provincial Secretary of Upper Canada by John Graves Simcoe from 1791 and served until his death in 1817. He was chairman of the Home District Council from 1800 to 1811.
Jarvis was married to Hannah Owen Peters, the daughter of Reverend Samuel Peters of Hebron, Connecticut. They had three children. Their son was Samuel Jarvis, who also became a prominent member of the Family Compact. Their two daughters were Maria Lavinia (1788) and Augusta (1790).

<doc id="18490682" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18490682" title="Thermal low">
Thermal low

Thermal lows, or heat lows, are non-frontal low-pressure areas that occur over the continents in the subtropics such as near the Sonoran Desert, the Mexican plateau, California's Great Central Valley, Sahara, South America over northwest Argentina, Australia, the Iberian peninsula, and Tibetan plateau during the warm season as the result of intense heating when compared to their surrounding environments. Over land, intense, rapid solar heating of the land surface results in heating of the lowest layers of the atmosphere via reradiated energy in the infrared spectrum. The resulting hotter air is less dense than surrounding cooler air. This, combined with the rising of the hot air, results in the formation of a low pressure area. Elevated areas can enhance the strength of the thermal low as they warm more quickly than the atmosphere which surrounds them at the same altitude. Over the water, thermal lows form during the winter when the air overlying the land is colder than the warmer water body. Thermal lows tend to have weak circulations, and can extend to in height. Thermal lows over the western and southern portions of North America, northern Africa, and southeast Asia are strong enough to lead to summer monsoon conditions. Development of thermal lows inland of the coastline lead to the development of sea breezes. Sea breezes combined with rugged topography near the coast can encourage poor air quality.
Formation.
In deserts, lack of ground and plant moisture that would normally provide evaporative cooling can lead to intense, rapid solar heating of the lower layers of air. The hot air is less dense than surrounding cooler air. This, combined with the rising of the hot air, results in a low pressure area called a thermal low. Over elevated surfaces, heating of the ground exceeds the heating of the surrounding air at the same altitude above sea level, which creates an associated heat low over the terrain and enhances any thermal lows which would have otherwise existed. During the cold season, (winter), warm water bodies such as the Great Lakes can induce a thermal low. Thermal lows which develop near sea level can build in height during the warm season, or summer, to the elevation of the 700 hPa pressure surface, which lies near above sea level. Heat lows normally are stationary and have a weak cyclonic circulation. As they are strongest at the surface and warm near their center, and weaker aloft where the air is more stable, the thermal low is considered warm core. The strongest versions of these features globally are over Arabia, the northern portion of the Indian subcontinent, Arizona, Mexican plateau, northwest Argentina, southwestern Spain, Australia, and northern Africa. The formation of the heat low over northern Africa leads to a low-level westerly jet stream from June into October.
Role in the monsoon regime.
Monsoons are caused by the larger amplitude of the seasonal cycle of land temperature compared to that of nearby oceans. This differential warming happens because heat in the ocean is mixed vertically through a "mixed layer" that may be fifty meters deep, through the action of wind and buoyancy-generated turbulence, whereas the land surface conducts heat slowly, with the seasonal signal penetrating perhaps a meter or so. Additionally, the specific heat capacity of liquid water is significantly higher than that of most materials that make up land. Together, these factors mean that the heat capacity of the layer participating in the seasonal cycle is much larger over the oceans than over land, with the consequence that the air over the land warms faster and reaches a higher temperature than the air over the ocean. The hot air over the land tends to rise, creating an area of low pressure. This creates a steady wind blowing toward the land, bringing the moist near-surface air over the oceans with it. Similar rainfall is caused by the moist ocean air being lifted upwards by mountains, surface heating, convergence at the surface, divergence aloft, or from storm-produced outflows at the surface. However the lifting occurs, the air cools due expansion in lower pressure, which in turn produces condensation.
In winter, the land cools off quickly, but the ocean keeps the heat longer due to its higher specific heat. The hot air over the ocean rises, creating a low pressure area and a breeze from land to ocean while a large area of drying high pressure is formed over the land, increased by wintertime cooling. Monsoons are similar to sea and land breezes, a term usually referring to the localized, diurnal (daily) cycle of circulation near coastlines everywhere, but they are much larger in scale, stronger and seasonal.
Role in sea breeze formation.
The sea is warmed by the sun to a greater depth than the land due to its greater specific heat. The sea therefore has a greater capacity for absorbing heat than the land, so the surface of the sea warms up more slowly than the land's surface. As the temperature of the surface of the land rises, the land heats the air above it. The warm air is less dense and so it rises. This rising air over the land lowers the sea level pressure by about 0.2%. The cooler air above the sea, now with higher sea level pressure, flows towards the land into the lower pressure, creating a cooler breeze near the coast. The strength of the sea breeze is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the land and the sea. If the environmental wind field is greater than and opposing the direction of a possible sea breeze, the sea breeze is not likely to develop.
Along the California coast, the cooler water sets up a surface marine layer that is much cooler than inland areas during the summer. At the same time, the intense heating inland creates a pronounced thermal trough aligned with the Great Central Valley and typically linked to the broader thermal low across the North American deserts. As a consequence, a strong pressure gradient is created which draws cool marine air landward. As temperatures plummet, fog and stratus stream in and through the gaps of the Coast Ranges, and especially through the Golden Gate at San Francisco ("see" San Francisco fog). The same thermal trough is sometimes pushed toward the coast, especially in late Fall as higher pressure develops to the east due to cooling further east. This setup often brings the warmest temperatures of the year to the normally cool coastline as the seabreeze stops or is even replaced by a dangerously dry land breeze.
Role in air pollution.
In areas where it is hilly or mountainous near the coastline, thermally-forced sea breezes combined with wind circulations up the sides of the mountains can encourage the production of chemicals which can lead to the development of smog. Pollution has been tracked into the mid-levels of the troposphere in the form of ozone, which is concentrated over the circulation of the thermal low as well as adjacent oceanic areas.

Belilena

Belilena is a famous large cave in Sri Lanka. It is located 8 km from the town of Kitulgala. It holds evidence of a lost generation of Sri Lankans some 12,000 years old; at this time the cave was occupied by Balangoda Man, described as "Homo sapiens balangodensis" by Paul E. P. Deraniyagala, who found ten skeletons of these people. They lived 2,000 feet above sea level. It is believed they lived than 32,000 years ago.
A visit requires a rope or rope ladder for entry. The part of the cave beyond the lake that fills it a short way from its mouth still remains unexplored.

Beli Lena Cave at Kitukgala was scientifically excavated and researched between the years 1978 and 1983 by the Archeological Department of Sri Lanka. Twenty five radiometric tests dated the cultural deposits to 30,000–9,000 years before present. A rich assemblage of cultural, faunal and human remains were excavated. These included geometric microlithic stone tools which, at 30,000 years old, are among the earliest in the world; and bone tools and evidence of the use of fire from 30,000 years ago onwards. The site yielded numerous remains of animals that had been used for food such as sambhur, pig, barking deer, monkeys, porcupines, giant squirrels and an assortment of reptiles and fish. The smaller mammals and aquatic and tree snails were prominent in the diet of Balangoda man, as were food plants such as wild breadfruit and canarium (Kekuna) nuts. An exchange network in salt from coastal lagoons some 80 km away had also been established by 30,000 years ago. Rubble foundations dated to 16,000 years before present constitute the earliest evidence of substantial structures in South Asia. 
The skeletal parts of several humans were found in the 16,000 years old level. These have been intensively analysed by an international team of Anthropologists. They are invaluable for unserstanding of the physical anthropology of Balangoda man. Beli Lena occupies a very special place in the cultural heritage of Sri Lanka. It awaits further investigations by future generations of Sri Lankan archeologists with progressively sharp analytical skills. As such, the site has been declared Archeological Reserve of the Archeological Department under the Antiquities Ordinance.

Horacio Etchegoyen

Horacio Etchegoyen (born January 13, 1919) is a prominent Argentine psychoanalyst, who in 1991 was elected president of the International Psychoanalytical Association (IPA).
Life and career.
Ricardo Horacio Etchegoyen was born in the Greater Buenos Aires area in 1919. His father, a physician, died when Etchegoyen was five months old. He studied at the Colegio Nacional de la Universidad Nacional de La Plata, a college preparatory school, and enrolled at the University of La Plata, earning a degree in medicine in 1948. During his university studies in the 1940s, he agitated for the university reform movement, which sought to strengthen secular education in Argentina. He was analyzed by Heinrich Racker, and began his psychoanalytic training in Argentina with Enrique Pichon Rivière, Marie Langer, León Grinberg, and José Bleger. Among his salient influences were the works of psychoanalyst Melanie Klein.
He practiced privately in La Plata, and taught at the National University of Cuyo from 1957 to 1965. Etchegoyen headed the Psychiatry Department at the university, and earned recognition from the World Health Organization during his tenure. He relocated to London in 1966, where he worked in the Adult Department of the famed Tavistock Clinic, where he received analysis from Donald Meltzer. He returned to Argentina within a year, and joined the Argentine Psychiatric Association, where from 1970, he provided advanced training to doctoral candidates in the field.
Etchegoyen was the first Latin American doctor to have the honor of being elected President of the IPA, and continued to practice and attend international conferences until 2008.
On psychoanalytic technique.
'The book written by R. Horacio Etchegoyen, "The Fundamentals of Psychoanalytic Technique" (1991) Aperçu Karnac Books ed., New Ed, 2005, ISBN 1-85575-455-X], is undoubtedly a work of international standing, presented as it is in the form of a well-researched and well-written handbook which is easy both to read and to consult'.
In it Etchegoyen examines how 'psychoanalytic technique is influenced by the wide variety of theoretical points of view...throughout the world from Klein to Lacan...and he emphasises the advantages and disadvantages of the various approaches in the light of his own clinical experience'.
On the link between theory and practice, Etchegoyen wrote: "if you want to be rigorous in technique, sooner or later, you will run into the question of theory, because - as Freud stated - they are always coupled as a 'Junktim'" - one implies the other. Etchegoyen considered indeed that the 'permanent interaction of theory and technique is peculiar to psychoanalysis... inextricable union'.
On the Lacanians.
Etchegoyen held discussions in Buenos Aires in 1996 with Jacques-Alain Miller, a prominent figure in the Lacanian movement. Etchegoyen invited Miller to the 1997 IPA Congress in Barcelona, where the latter's comments from the floor were greeted with warm applause.
Etchegoyen's capacity for bridge-building with the Lacanians had already been presaged by his "Fundamentals", where he had discussed Lacanian concepts in an impartial and unpolemical way.
Criticism.
It has been suggested that 'Etchegoyen's (1991) influential book, "The Fundamentals of Psychoanalytic Technique" may be read as an attempt to work through his (often conflicted) feelings towards two major influences on his own professional development - Melanie Klein, his dominant theoretical inspiration, and Heinrich Racker, his first analyst and mentor', whose work on transference/countertransference stands as a precursor of intersubjective psychoanalysis: Etchegoyen's 'retreat to a conservative Kleinian "one-person psychology"' from Racker's influence would then appear as something of a retrograde step.
Etchegoyen's 'attention to certain similarities between the analysand's verbalization in the psychoanalytic process and Husserl's so-called eidetic reduction' shows however his continuing sensitivity to the phenomenological aspects of the patient/analyst interaction.

Stepping Stone (Duffy song)

"Stepping Stone" is the fourth single by Duffy from her debut album, "Rockferry". The single was officially released as both a digital download and CD single on 1 September 2008 in the United Kingdom. Although it followed the massive success of previous singles "Mercy" and "Warwick Avenue", it did not perform well in worldwide music charts. However, the single received widespread acclaim.
Writing and inspiration.
"Stepping Stone" was written by Duffy and Steve Booker (who also co-wrote international success "Mercy"), and recorded at Booker's "Bookerland studios". It was the first song the pair completed together. According to Booker in an interview with HitQuarters, Duffy firstly wanted to do the song "completely Supremes and up-tempo" because she felt that her album still needed a "big song" to complete it. The following day she changed her mind about the song's direction and the ongoing search for a big up-tempo song would eventually lead to "Mercy".
Release.
It was released worldwide as the third single from "Rockferry", and the fourth in the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Ireland, after "Rockferry", "Mercy" and "Warwick Avenue". The single was not released in mainland Europe, despite reaching the charts in many countries in this region. The cover art was produced by Studio Fury, and photographed by Max Dodson.
The single was released in both CD single and 7" vinyl (see release history). In a press release for the single it was stated that there would be a two-track exclusive single available for digital download, although this never came to fruition.
One press release commented about the context and content of "Stepping Stone":
"Stepping Stone is one of the many album highlights, it is a song about self-possession, strength and restraint. The music is dramatic, pulsating yet sparse, compelling the listener to focus on Duffy's remarkable vocals and evocative lyrics."
– I Like Music 
Reception.
Critical.
"Clash" gave the single a very successful review. In this particular review, the song was heavily praised for its "orchestral grandeur" and "slick production". Ending the review, it congratulated Duffy for being "one of the most potent pop talents in the UK". "Daily Music Guide" followed the positive style of "Clash"'s review, giving the single a "4/5" rating. The writer said that Duffy "stands out" and that when compared to other soul singers such as Adele and Estelle, her "songs are better". However, the Daily Music Guide did point out that "Stepping Stone" is not as good as previous singles, when saying "'Stepping Stone' doesn't quite have the majesty of 'Warwick Avenue', the oomph of 'Mercy' or the epic sweep of the song 'Rockferry'". The review closed with the writer noting that the song is "a thoughtful and emotional piece of music". As with a Digital Spy review, Duffy and the song were compared to Burt Bacharach. Another reviewer for "The Independent" compared "Stepping Stone" to "elegant Bacharach style".
Following the positive trend of reviews by critics, "The Hollywood Reporter" said that the song "shows what all the fuss is about", referring to Duffy's success worldwide. It went on to say that Duffy "sheds so many previous vocal comparisons" with the song, also noting that the single is "clearly aimed at adults who may have shied away from the party vibe of 'Mercy'". 
However, many critics gave the single mixed reviews. Digital Spy, in particular, gave the single a mixed review. Giving the song three stars out of five, the reviewer noted that "["Stepping Stone"] is her weakest to date". This is against previous reviews given by the website, which were generally positive. The review went on to say that "["Duffy (with the song)"] plays into the hands of critics who brand her music "coffee table soul". Finally, the reviewer said that "it Stone lacks the heart-melting chorus which made the former ["Warwick Avenue"] a triumph". A reviewer for the BBC said that "Stepping Stone" was "noticeably hanging limply" when compared to the full tracklisting of "Rockferry".
Commercial and chart performance.
Elsewhere, in mainland Europe, despite not being released as an official single, the song managed to chart on various singles charts in that region. In Belgium (Flanders), the song reached a peak of 27 on the Ultratop charts, whilst in Switzerland, the song reached a peak of 49 on the official Swiss Singles Chart, becoming Duffy's worst charting position there.
Music video.
The music video for "Stepping Stone" depicts a mature, sophisticated style as Duffy is involved with one mysterious man. Early anticipation suggested that Duffy would be "depicted as a 1960s sexpot who is seduced by a stranger in a nightclub". 
The video begins with Duffy sitting in bed, singing that she "will never be a stepping stone" to her lover. The video continues with Duffy trying on many different outfits throughout the day whilst singing the song, as if trying to impress somebody. Each time she leaves her house, she is seen going back to get changed, before finally building up the courage to leave. It ends with Duffy entering a filled bar, whilst someone enters and she looks up. The storyline suggests that Duffy is in love, however he does not love her in the same way. This fits in with the theme of the song, with its chorusline "I will never be a Stepping Stone", perhaps showing that Duffy is the bridge between two better relationships.
The music video was directed by Sophie Muller, and was first shown on video-sharing website, YouTube on 4 August 2008.

138th meridian east

The meridian 138° east of Greenwich is a line of longitude that extends from the North Pole across the Arctic Ocean, Asia, the Pacific Ocean, Australasia, the Indian Ocean, the Southern Ocean, and Antarctica to the South Pole.
The 138th meridian east forms a great circle with the 42nd meridian west.
In Australia, the border between the Northern Territory and Queensland approximates the meridian. The border runs north from Poeppel Corner at a bearing of 359° 59' 30", reaching the Gulf of Gulf of Carpentaria several hundred metres west of the meridian.

Louis Joseph Watteau

Louis Joseph Watteau (10 April 1731 - 17 August 1798), known as the Watteau of Lille (a title also given to his son) was a French painter active in Lille. 
Watteau was born in Valenciennes. His father Noël Joseph Watteau (1689-1756) was brother to Jean-Antoine Watteau, the painter of fêtes galantes, and he was himself father to the painter François Watteau.
He played a decisive role in the foundation of what would become the musée lillois des Beaux-Arts, opened in 1803, by producing the first ever inventory of paintings confiscated by the state during the French Revolution.
He died in Lille, aged 67.

Caribou Wilderness

The Caribou Wilderness is a federally designated wilderness area created by the Wilderness Act of 1964 and is part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. It is located east of Redding in the state of California, USA. The Caribou Wilderness comprises and is adjacent to the east side of Lassen Volcanic National Park. Although the park (which includes its own Lassen Volcanic Wilderness area) is surrounded by Lassen National Forest, it is managed separately by the National Park Service, whereas the U.S. Forest Service manages the wilderness.
Elevations range from to .
The terrain is a volcanic plateau with 75% covered by water and conifer forests and the remainder being barren rock such as cliff faces, talus slopes and cinder cones. Most of this area has been preserved since 1932 which makes the Caribou Wilderness one of the few remaining pristine forests of the California Cascade region. There are 23 named lakes, innumerable unnamed ponds and tarns, cinder cones and volcanic buttes within the wilderness. Although there are no year round surface streams, the area provides high quality water for the headwaters of the Susan River, and Bailey Creek, a tributary of the Feather River. The high point is Red Cinder (8,363 ft) located near the boundary between the wilderness and the park. Other peaks are North Caribou (7,785 ft), South Caribou ( 7,753 ft) and Black Butte in the northeast at 7,989 ft.
Recreational activities include day hiking, backpacking, fishing, horseback riding, cross-country skiing, nature photography and rock climbing. The Forest Service encourages the practice of Leave No Trace principles of outdoor travel to minimize human impact on the environment.
Flora, fauna and fungi.
The forest is lodgepole pine, Jeffrey pine, Ponderosa Pine, Douglas Fir, white and red fir, western white pine, Incense Cedar, and hemlock.
21 of Caribou's lakes are stocked by air with rainbow trout. Black-tailed deer and black bears along with squirrels, chipmunks, and the protected (from hunting) pine marten live here. There are bald eagles and ospreys overhead, mergansers and grebes on the ponds and lakes.
Much smaller in size, but critically important to the forest ecosystem are the fungi.
The cup fungus, for instance, can be found in the Caribou. As the sanitary agents of the forest that consume dead organic matter, fungi spread on the floor of a conifer area. Fungal spores blow in on the winds and take up residence at the foot of trees. One type, called the king bolete, is the edible mushroom most sought. Not all fungi have a symbiotic relationship with the trees, some fungi are parasitic, causing heartwood rot.
Along some trails in the Caribou, hikers will see a timber-destroying (causes brown rot) pore fungi called the red-belt fomes. It is a white and yellow fungi on the bark of both white fir and red fir trees. An interesting aspect of red-belt fomes is that it has a laquared feel if touched.
Area history.
Before this area became a federally protected wilderness in 1964, it had been previously protected as a primitive area since 1932. When the National Park Service was created in 1916, most of the first National Parks were carved out of National Forest Lands.
Beginning in 1929, The United States Forest Service set some areas aside as primitive areas to keep the Park Service from continuing to acquire forest lands. At least that is the conclusion of economist David Gerard, who wrote about the competing interests between the two federal agencies: The Park Service under the federal Department of the Interior and the Forest Service, managed by the federal Department of Agriculture.
The forest service already managed of forest reserves before the National Park Service was even in existence. And each new national park had to be approved by the U.S. Congress.
These political maneuverings by the US Forest Service in the years 1929 - 1964 helped in the development of the wilderness preservation system of today.
Recreation.
Wilderness areas are managed to preserve the natural, undeveloped conditions as much as possible so there are limitations in the use for recreation. No motorized equipment, vehicles or bicycles can be brought into a wilderness. There are no man-made structures or conveniences, although occasionally evidence of prior land use before the wilderness designation, such as old fences and tree blazes are found.
The Caribou is one of the areas protected by the first major legislation for setting aside lands from development and resource extraction. The 1964 Wilderness Act created the Caribou Wilderness out of what was a primitive area since 1932. As a result, an almost pristine, old-growth forest describes the Caribou. 
Three trailheads give access to the wilderness; Hay Meadows in the south, Cone Lake in the north and Silver Lake on the east which is also the most popular entry point; as well, the Wilderness can be accessed by trails leading in from Lassen Volcanic National Park to the west. Travel by foot or horseback is easy because the landscape has only moderate hills and valleys. No wilderness permits are required, only a California campfire permit for open fires.
There are many other trails connecting to other lakes such as Evelyn Lakes as well as trails to the national park's backcountry wilderness area on the west. Backpacking and day hikes are possible with a variety of one-way or loop trips of any length. There are lakes within two miles (3 km) of any trailhead as well as volcanic cinder cones and rocky cliffs for the more adventurous visitors. Off-trail travel is possible but challenging due 
to many large fallen trees and brush between wet meadows which is the nature of a wilderness area.
A wilderness addition was proposed for areas just outside the present boundaries including Indian Meadow (near Hay Meadow) and the lake for which the wilderness is named. These have been identified by the forest service for having ancient forests of white fir, western white pine, sugar pine, lodgepole pine, red fir, incense cedar and Jeffrey pine. This proposed addition did not make it into the 2006 Northern California Coastal Wild Heritage Wilderness Act.

2002 Denali earthquake

The 2002 Denali earthquake occurred at 22:12:41 UTC (1:12 PM Local Time) November 3, 2002, with an epicenter 66 km ESE of Denali National Park, Alaska, United States. This 7.9 "M"w earthquake was the largest recorded in the interior of the United States for more than 150 years. The shock was the strongest ever recorded in the interior of Alaska. Due to the remote location, there were no fatalities and only a few injuries.
Earthquake damage.
Minor damage was reported over a wide area but the only examples of severe damage were on highways that crossed the fault trace and areas that suffered liquefaction, e.g. Northway Airport Several bridges were damaged but none so severely that they were closed to traffic.
Due to the general self-sufficiency of those living near the fault rupture, very few lifeline systems were compromised. These people tend to get water from private wells, heat their homes and cook their meals with gas furnaces and stoves, and maintain individual septic systems.
The Trans-Alaska Pipeline System crosses the rupture trace; the pipeline suffered some minor damage to supports during the earthquake. There was no oil spillage, as the pipeline at that location was designed to move laterally along beams to withstand major movement on the Denali Fault. The pipeline was shut down for three days to allow for inspections but was then reopened.
Tectonic setting.
The Denali-Totschunda fault is a major dextral (right lateral) strike-slip system, similar in scale to the San Andreas fault system.
In Alaska, moving from east to west, the plate interactions change from a transform boundary between Pacific and North American plates to a collision zone with a microplate, the Yakutat terrane, which is in the process of being accreted to the North American plate, to a destructive boundary along the line of the Aleutian islands. The Denali-Totschunda fault system is one of the structures that accommodate the accretion of the Yakutat terrane.
Earthquake characteristics.
On October 23, 2002, there was a magnitude 6.7 earthquake located on the Denali fault. Because of its location close to the November 3 event and the fact that it preceded it by only 11 days, this earthquake is regarded as a foreshock that probably directly triggered the main shock.
The initial rupture on November 3 was on a thrust fault segment, the previously unknown Susitna Glacier thrust, to the south of the Denali fault. The epicenter lies just east of the October 23 foreshock. The rupture then jumped to the main Denali fault strand propagating for a further before jumping again onto the Totschunda fault and rupturing another of fault plane. The total surface rupture was ca. .
There is evidence of local supershear propagation inferred from ground motions.

West Hallam railway station

West Hallam railway station was a railway station located between the villages of Stanley and West Hallam in Derbyshire, England. It was opened by the Great Northern Railway (Great Britain) on its Derbyshire Extension in 1878.
History.
The station was originally called Stanley, but its name was quickly changed to West Hallam for Dale Abbey to avoid confusion with another station in Yorkshire. It was provided with substantial brick buildings; a two-storey station master's house and the usual single storey offices on the main platform with a small timber waiting room on the other. 
On a Sunday evening in October 1884 Godfrey Bostock (68) and his wife Mary (67), who lived in Kimberley and had been visiting relatives in Smalley Common, were killed while crossing the track at West Hallam Station. Apparently they mistook a light engine working from Derby as their train and while hurrying to cross the line to the platform were both hit and died immediately from head injuries. Following a recommendation of the coroner at their inquest, West Hallam became one of the few intermediate stations on the line to be given a footbridge.
Beside the presence of productive collieries, it was particularly busy during World War II due to a nearby ordnance depot, a satellite of that at Chilwell. Sunday passengers services finished in 1939, and it closed completely in 1964.
From Ilkeston the line climbed through West Hallam to a summit at Morley Tunnel before descending towards Breadsall.
Present day.
Most signs of the railway have disappeared apart from the station building itself. Part was demolished on closure, but the main part is now a private dwelling known as 'Station House'. The large cutting which took the line from the station past Stanley was filled in using spoil from the neighbouring former Stanley colliery so that the route of the line can only be established by using field boundaries today.

History.
World War II.
Established in the Middle East during late 1942 to aid British Forces during the Western Desert Campaign. Initially equipped with obsolete B-17C/D Flying Fortresses transferred from Tenth Air Force. Replaced with B-24 Liberators flown from Florida via South America; over to then across Central Africa then north to Egypt in early 1943. Became part of United States Middle East Air Forces (USMEAF), later Ninth Air Force.
Operating from bases in British Palestine, Egypt, Libya and Tunisia, attacked shipping in the Mediterranean and harbor installations in Libya, Tunisia, Sicily, and Italy to cut enemy supply lines to North Africa. Struck airdromes, marshalling yards, and other objectives in Sicily and Italy after the fall of Tunisia in May 1943. Reassigned to Fifteenth Air Force in late 1943, and moved to southern Italy. Squadron flew long range strategic bombardment missions to targets in Italy, France, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Hungary, and the Balkans to bomb factories, marshalling yards, oil refineries, oil storage facilities, airdromes, bridges, harbors, and other objectives.
After the German Capitulation in May 1945, returned to the United States; was re-equipped with B-29 Superfortress bombers and trained under Second Air Force for deployment to the Pacific Theater. However with the Japanese Capitulation in August, the training ended and most personnel demobilized by the end of October. Remained in active status but not fully manned or equipped, and subsequently inactivated in early 1946 due to budget restrictions. The squadron was not fully manned or equipped between 10 November 1945 and 26 March 1946 and was unmanned from, 23 May 1947 – 20 September 1948.
Korean War.
Based in Japan at the beginning of the Korean War, the 512 RS, flying RB/WB-29s, performed daily strategic weather reconnaissance missions over the combat zone, conducted shipping surveillance and visual reconnaissance, and accomplished electronic countermeasures reconnaissance until 20 February 1951. In the early days of the conflict, the squadron also dropped leaflets. Initially unarmed, and later only lightly armed with two .50-caliber machine guns in the tail turret, the WB-29s flew daily missions over enemy-held territory. During 27 June through 27 December 1950, the squadron flew over 200 combat missions, making over 5,000 vitally needed weather observations. These missions were exceptionally hazardous because of extremely varying weather conditions and exposure to attack over enemy territory. One of the squadron's WB-29s served as an aerial command post and weather station, giving on-the-spot weather data and directions to incoming bombers on the first B-29 strike (13 July 1950) against North Korean installations. On this and several later such missions, the WB-29 carried Major General Emmett O'Donnell, Jr., USAF, Commander, FEAF Bomber Command. The 512 RS was replaced by the 56th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron in February 1951.
Cold War.
Reactivated in May 1951. Practiced electronic countermeasures with B-29 aircraft from c. 1952 until conversion to B-47 Stratojet jet medium bombers in 1954. Between 1954 and 1965, the 513 Bombardment Squadron flew a long series of simulated combat bombardment missions to maintain readiness as a unit of the Strategic Air Command, testing electronic warfare devices and radar techniques, using B-47 and EB-47 aircraft. Inactivated in 1965 with the retirement of the B-47.
Modern era.
Currently the 512th participates in Special Operations contingencies, exercises, and humanitarian rescue helicopter training.

Breadsall railway station

Breadsall railway station was a former railway station in Breadsall, Derbyshire. It was opened by the Great Northern Railway (Great Britain) on its Derbyshire Extension in 1878.
History.
From West Hallam and the summit at Morley Tunnel, the line descended to Breadsall, on a gradient of 1 in 100.
The station itself was very close to the village and was provided with substantial brick buildings; a two-storey station master's house and the usual single storey offices on the platforms.
The passenger service finished in 1953 and services on the line ended completely in 1964 (passenger services) and 1968 (goods). 
From Breadsall, the line then crossed the Derwent valley by a long succession of embankments and viaducts. It then entered the town through a deep cutting before reaching Derby Friargate. Near Derby Racecourse was a siding with facilities for handling horses and there were plans for a station but this never came to fruition.
Present day.
The platforms and their buildings were gradually demolished, although traces remain. The single storey buildings became unsafe and were pulled down. The stationmaster's house survived until 1978 in an increasingly decrepit state until it became unsafe following an arson attack and it too was demolished.
A length of the old trackbed has been opened up as the Great Northern Greenway bridlepath through Breadsall since 2009 and the site of the station is now more accessible.

<doc id="18490868" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18490868" title="Sexual script">
Sexual script

The idea of sexual script brings a new metaphor and imagery for understanding human sexual encounters as social and learned interactions. The concept was first introduced by sociologists John H. Gagnon and William Simon in their 1973 book "Sexual Conduct". The idea highlights three levels of scripting: the cultural/historical, the social/interactive and the personal/intra-psychic. It draws from a range of theories including symbolic interactionism, discourse theory and feminism. It is the foundation of the new Critical Sexualities Studies and the reshaping of the field of sexualities studies in the late twentieth and early twenty first century. The theory of sexual scripting brings sociological, cultural, anthropological, historical and social psychological tools to the study of human sexualities. Whereas human sexuality is usually seen as the province of the biologist and the clinician, scripting helps research and analysis to understand sexualities as less biological and more cultural, historical and social.
Sexual script.
Sexual scripting suggests the importance of meanings and symbols in human sexuality. According to Gagnon and Simon, scripts can be layered through three dimensions: 'cultural scenarios', 'interpersonal scenarios', and 'intrapsychic scenarios'. Sexual feeling does not simply happen from within the body but needs meanings and symbols which provide cues and clues to enable sexualities to develop. Cultural scenarios are linked to different historical periods and social change; for example scripts can be shown to change with the arrival of HIV/AIDS in the 1980s (Epstein, Lauman ...). Interpersonal scenarios are linked to encounters and interactions (for example in rape, as illustrated in the early work of Stevi Jackson). And intra-psychic scenarios indicate the ways in which personal sexual 'turn ons' and imageries grow. (cf William Simon's). Sexual scripts can be seen as providing guideline for appropriate sexual behaviour and sexual encounters as sexual behaviour and encounters are learned through culture and others in interactions. It can be linked to theories of sexual desire but is critical of their tendency to stress the purely biological aspects of desire.
Developments.
Drawing upon conversational analysis, Firth and Kitzinger, sexual encounters are considered to be scripted if the parties involved use any of these five linguistic devices:
See: Hannah Firth, Celia Kitzinger, Reformulating Sexual Script Theory. Theory and Psychology, 11 (2). pp. 209–232. Sass, November 2007.
Research on sexual scripts and sexual script theory have concluded that sexual scripts are organised through gender, class, ethnicity and other social vectors. 
Sexual Script Theory (SST) and its application in clinical practice are founded on the undeniable reality that the subjective understandings of each person about his or her sexuality (and called a sexual script) substantively determine that person's choice of sexual actions and the subsequent qualitative experiencing of those sexual acts. Scripts refer to social functions. They dictate what one should be doing at a particular time and in a particular place if one is to play the role characteristically associated with that script. There may be several people involved in the same situation, but they may differ in the roles that they have been given or have chosen to ena Script theory is a form of social scripting theory which has been defined clearly by Michael W. Wiederman who says, "Social scripting theory points to the fact that much of sexual behavior seems to follow a script. Similar to scripts that stage actors use to guide their behavior, social scripts instruct members of a society as to appropriate behavior and the meanings to attach to certain behaviors.".
Social scripting theory directly relates to sexual scripts as it is just a specified example regarding sexual encounters and sexual behavior in social context. Social Theory is also a 
useful resource in determining the construction of social scripts.
Effects of Sexual script.
Some of the characteristics demonstrated in sexual scripts have been proved that it can increase the risk of sexual aggression. These scripts can lead to sexual through the effects of alcohol consumption, miscommunication of sexual purposes and a lot of sexual experience.
Social construction.
The theory is linked to the wider development of Social construction social constructionism on the socially created nature of social life. See the social construction of sexuality.
Social construction is important to sexual script because sexual scripts can come from how a child is raised through the beliefs of social construction.
In other words, women are to be subjected to Male Gaze in order to be a part of the social construction system and maintain social norms of a long living society.
Sexuality.
Sexuality is the behavior of human beings with regard to the activities that causes or is associated with sexual arousal. It is influenced by the genetically inherited sexual response patterns, societal attitudes toward sex, and each individual's upbringing. "Physiology sets only very broad limits on human sexuality; most of the enormous variation found among humans results from learning and conditioning. What is deviant in one society may be normal in another. Sexuality covers gender identity, sexual orientation, and actual practices, as well as one's acceptance of these aspects of one's personality, which may be more important than their specifics." [http://www.answers.com/topic/reproductive-health]
Sexual norms.
A sexual norm can be an individual or a social norm, which is a rule that is socially enforced. Norms affect a wide variety of human behavior.
Social norms regarding sexuality are present in most cultures. For example, the norm in most cultures consists of heterosexual acts between married individuals. Sexual norms are constantly changing and normal sexual behavior is a spectrum and cannot be rigidly defined. 
Deviance from normal sexual behavior is common and can be classified in several ways. If non-restrictive sexual norms are regarded positively they may be called "sexual freedom:, "sexual liberation", or "free love". If regarded negatively they may be called "sexual license" or "licentiousness". Restrictive behavior when judged negatively is called sexual oppression"; if judged positively they are called "chastity", "sexual restraint", The Maritial Effect, or "sexual decency".
In the West, sexual normality can be defined as any sexual practice which does not involve sexual perversions. There has been a liberalization in attitudes which has resulted in the legalization of homosexuality in many countries. There is a tendency in Western countries toward serial monogamy as a normal heterosexual lifestyle.
Sociologists believe that emotion emerges in relation to dominant sexual scripts and sexual identity. Sexual script is also believed to have different scripts for males and females in relation to sexual activity. In sexual script's link to sexual activity; sexuality, sexual norms, social construction and gender roles all play a part in what makes sexual script differ between males and females.
Gender roles.
Gender Schema Theory also plays a part in sexual script because studies show that males and females interact in different ways, even from a young age.
In 1991, Martha Boston and Gary Levy found that through their research observations, children, primarily boys, were better with being able to sequence own-sex rather than other-sex scripts.
"As well as acquiring knowledge about the sex-role stereotypes of their culture, young children also develop sex-typed attitudes, preferences, and behaviors that pervade many aspects of their lives." 
At a young age, children learn from their sex-roles in which later relate to the way in which they interact through their sexual scripting. 
A double standard exists in the traditional heterosexual sexual script. It endorses different sexual behavior for women and men, whereby women are expected to confine sexual behavior to the context of a committed relationship and men are expected to engage in sexual behavior in all kinds of relationships. Research, however, demonstrates that the expectation that women and men follow this traditional sexual script has lessened and become more subtle over time, especially in the context of established relationships, and that couples may use other kinds of scripts instead.
Application of the theory.
The theory has now been applied to a wide range of areas including:

Mickleover railway station

Mickleover railway station was a railway station serving the village of Mickleover, Derbyshire, England (now part of the city of Derby). It was opened by the Great Northern Railway on its Derbyshire Extension in 1878.
History.
From Derby Friargate the line climbed at 1 in 100 for two miles southwards. On the outskirts shortly after the present Derby ring road the line entered a deep cutting leading to Mickleover Tunnel. The summit of the climb lay at the other end and, being curved, it presented a particular challenge to train drivers.
The station was about a mile north of the village along Station Road. It was labelled Mickleover for Radbourne, since it was in that parish, albeit some two miles distant. Originally it was spelt "Radburn" and, for a while, "Radbourn".
It was provided with substantial brick buildings; a two-storey station master's house and the usual single storey offices on the platforms. Regular passenger traffic finished in 1939, although it saw excursions until 1959, until complete closure in 1964.
The line from Friargate remained open for some years, being used as a test track by the British Rail Research Division.
Present day.
The main station building has been converted into two private dwellings.

Fady Maalouf

Fady Maalouf ( pronounced Fādī Maʿlūf) (born on April 20, 1979 in Zahlé, Lebanon) is a Lebanese-German pop singer. He is known as runner up of the fifth season of "Deutschland sucht den Superstar", the German version of "Pop Idol". He has released three albums to date, "Blessed" (2008), "Into the Light" (2010), and "City of Gold" (2012).
Early life.
Maalouf was born to a Lebanese family and his father Mounir Maalouf had German roots. He started at a very early age to show interest in music and singing. He sang in a church children's choir and took some piano lessons. Later on he received professional voice training with a vocal coach. At age of 17, he started performing as a club singer in piano bars, night clubs, as well as events and galas in Lebanon. He also made some Arabic language songs using the artistic name Alex, including the single "Ya leil" written and composed by Fady Maalouf himself, accompanied by a music video and a cover of "Hebbina Hebbina" from Farid al-Atrash
Besides singing, he studied fashion design, earned a degree and made an internship with the now famous Lebanese international fashion designer Elie Saab. He also lived for a time in a French town near Bordeaux, France. and shared his time between Lebanon and France. During the civil war in Lebanon, he was wounded by shrapnel in his face and had to undergo a series of facial operations for recovery. When in 2006 the political situation in Beirut worsened, he went to his half-brother in Germany where he worked in Hamburg as a barista (espresso specialist).
DSDS.
Having lived in Hamburg for only 10 months, upon insistence from his friends, he auditioned for the German reality show "Deutschland sucht den Superstar" (DSDS, the German version of "Pop Idol" or "Superstar") in autumn 2007. He reached the finals of the show, where on 17 May 2008 he competed against Thomas Godoj in finale where Maalouf received 37.8% of the public votes finishing in the second place.
The song "Blessed" was written for Fady by Jörgen Elofsson and Peer Åström, to be released as the winning song in case Fady won. Elofsson and Åströma were a songwriter team of international standing, who have worked with such names as Kelly Clarkson, Leona Lewis, Madonna, Britney Spears, Cyndi Lauper, Il Divo, and especially Céline Dion. The song was produced by Alex Christensen, who has worked with artists such as Justin Timberlake, Tom Jones, Paul Anka or Michael Bolton. He sang the song on May 17, 2008, in the final showdown between him and Thomas Godoj who eventually won. 
Career.
Even though Fady did not win the DSDS title, his extraordinary voice and his charming personality had won him the hearts of an enormous fan base, which then, in an unprecedented effort, organized a letters, mails and phone call campaign with Sony BMG, demanding the release of Fady Maalouf's title "Blessed", performed during the final show.
After a contract with Columbia, a subsidiary of Sony BMG Music Entertainment "Blessed" was released on 4 July 2008 as a single and went straight to no. 2 in the German single charts.
The album, also named "Blessed" including 14 tracks, was released on 25 July 2008, and went as well straight to no. 2 in the German album charts. These simultaneous single and album charts positions made Maalouf the most successful DSDS finalist of all time.
On 21 November 2008, Maalouf released a new single called "Amazed", a cover of a hit by the band Lonestar. This single CD included the song "Vole mon âme", the French version of "Show Me Your Love" to which Maalouf wrote the French language lyrics himself.
On 28 November 2008, Sony Music Entertainment released a new edition of Maalouf's album "Blessed", including a double CD package and new unreleased tracks.
On 12 March 2010, he had his follow up album "Into the Light" and released the title song as a single.
In 2011, he collaborated with Russian pop singer Valeriya and toured Europe with her, recording a Russian-language song with her entitled "Ty Grustish".
In 2012, he released his third studio album entitled "City of Gold", containing English, French with a special Arabic language song "Neyla" co-written by Fady Maalouf, Bernd Klimpel and Charlie Mason. Video was edited and directed by Judith Klinger and Fady Maalouf.
Charity.
Soon after his success, Fady Maalouf helped to establish a charity organization "Blessed E.V.", named after his successful debut single "Blessed". It donates aid relief for people in need, especially in states of emergency such as war, famine and natural disaster or otherwise in distress, irrespective of their religious, political or ideological orientation. It is also active in advancement of the public healthcare and development aid.

Etwall railway station was a former railway station in Etwall, Derbyshire. It was opened by the Great Northern Railway (Great Britain) on its Derbyshire Extension in 1878.
History.
From Mickleover the line dropped at about 1 in 110 towards Etwall.
The station was very close to the village, being adjacent to the Uttoxeter road which crossed the line by a steeply sloped bridge. It was provided with substantial brick buildings similar to others on the line; a two-storey station master's house and the usual single storey offices on the platform, with a small timber waiting room on the other.
Regular passenger traffic finished in 1939, although it saw excursions until 1963, and it closed in the following year.
The line from Friargate remained open for some years, being used as a test track by the British Rail Research Division. After public services finished, the stationmaster continued to live in the house.

Cambrian News

The Cambrian News is a weekly newspaper distributed in Wales. It was founded in 1860 and is based in Cefn Llan Science Park, Aberystwyth. Cambrian News Ltd was bought by media entrepreneur Sir Ray Tindle in 1998.
History.
First published in Bala in October 1860 as the four page supplement "The Merioneth Herald." Having subsequently become a distinct paper printed in Oswestry, in 1864 it became the "Cambrian News." In 1870 it was bought by Sir John Gibson, who moved the headquarters to Aberystwyth, but kept printing in Oswestry.
In May 1880, the company integrated editorial and printing in a former Malthouse in Mill Street, Aberystwyth. In 1926, Henry Read bought the paper and became Managing Director.
In the 1930s, his son Robert Read became the major shareholder, succeeded by his son Henry Read. It was under his direction that after 113 years, printing was contracted out. This enabled the move of editorial staff to the new open-plan offices on the Science Park at Llanbadarn Fawr. On the death of Henry Read, the paper was purchased by Sir Ray Tindle, whose company owns more than 200 weekly newspapers in Britain.
After 146 years as a broadsheet, the paper transformed to a tabloid format in 2006.
Today.
Today, the "Cambrian News" is Wales' biggest-selling weekly newspaper with the second largest circulation newspaper in Wales, with 24,000 copies in sixth regional editorial versions, read by 60,000 weekly readers. The circulation area of mid, west and north Wales covers .
The paper publishes editions in several locations across north Wales and mid-Wales including Bala, Criccieth, Dolgellau, Machynlleth, Porthmadog, Pwllheli, Tywyn, the entirety of Ceredigion and parts of north Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire. It maintains offices in Aberystwyth and Porthmadog, closing its Lampeter office in October 2008. The Aberystwyth head office was originally based in Bridge Street, before moving to Terrace Road, and Gray's Inn Road. It is now produced from a unit in the town's Science Park.
In April 2010, all the weekly editions of Cambrian News became available to view as an online digital newspaper on a subscription basis.
"Cambrian News Ltd" also publishes the Welsh language weekly newspaper Y Cymro, Pembrokeshire weekly paper The County Echo, Welsh weekly Y Dydd and seasonal Holidaymaker magazine.

Egginton Junction railway station is a former railway station in Egginton, Derbyshire.
History.
It was opened by the Great Northern Railway (Great Britain) on its Derbyshire Extension in 1878, jointly with the North Staffordshire Railway.
It was arranged in angle of the junction, with separate pairs of platforms for each company. 
It was provided with substantial brick buildings; a two-storey station master's house and the usual single storey offices on the main GNR platform in the vee of the junction, with small timber-built waiting rooms on the two outer subsidiary platforms.
Regular passenger traffic finished in 1939, although it saw excursions until 1959, and it closed in 1962. The Egginton Dairy creamery had a dedicated siding for the dispatch of milk trains around the country, until the mid-1960s.
Present day.
The line from Friargate remained open for some years, being used as a test track by the British Rail Research Division. The station area was leased by a caravan dealer who later moved on. By 1974 the main station was derelict and would have been pulled down had not a building company bought it in 1978 and renovated it for use as offices. The NSR side of the station has disappeared.

<doc id="18490928" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18490928" title="Nonqualified deferred compensation">
Nonqualified deferred compensation

In the United States, the question whether any compensation plan is qualified or non-qualified is primarily a question of taxation under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). Any business prefers to deduct its expenses from its income, which will reduce the income subject to taxation. Expenses which are deductible ("qualified") have satisfied tests required by the IRC. Expenses which do not satisfy those tests ("non-qualified") are not deductible; even though the business has incurred the expense, the amount of that expenditure remains as part of taxable income. In most situations, any business will attempt to satisfy the requirements so that its expenditures are deductible business expenses.
A non-qualified deferred compensation plan or agreement simply defers the payment of a portion of the employee’s compensation to a future date. The amounts are held back (deferred) while the employee is working for the company, and are paid out to the employee when he or she separates from service, becomes disabled, dies, etc. As will be discussed later, one of the keys in designing a non-qualified deferred compensation plan is making sure that the employee will not be required to pay income tax on those deferred amounts until the amounts are actually paid to the employee.
Basics.
In describing a "non-qualified deferred compensation plan", we can consider each word.
Types of plans.
There are two general types of unfunded deferred compensation plans:
(1) Elective Deferral Plans.
Under an elective deferral plan, the Employee elects to defer a portion of compensation, which he or she would otherwise receive currently. The election is contained in a written agreement that specifies the amount of salary, bonus, commissions or other deferrals and the time and manner of payment, such as retirement.
(2) Supplemental Benefit Plans.
Under a supplemental benefit plan, the Employer makes a legally binding agreement to pay "supplemental" compensation (compensation in addition to regular salary and bonus), typically upon retirement. These plans are often called Supplemental Employee Retirement Plans or "SERPs." SERPs are frequently designed as defined benefit pension plans, either as a stand-alone plan or paired with a qualified pension plan.
Flexible benefit structure.
Deferred compensation plans offer flexibility for both the employer and the employee.
Deferred amounts credited to a book account.
Unfunded deferred compensation plans offer very flexible benefit structures compared to qualified retirement plans, even after the enactment of new Internal Revenue Code IRC §409A (discussed below). 
Account-based plans: Elective deferrals are credited to an account in the participant’s name along with any company contributions (such as matching contributions). Earnings may be credited to the plan with interest at a set rate or flexible rate, or treated as if the deferred amounts were invested in specific investments designated by the employee. 
Non-account plans (defined benefit plans): The benefit amount may also be a specified dollar amount payable annually after retirement or termination. Payments continue as specified in the plan, usually over the life of the employee or the joint lives of the employee and the employee’s spouse.
Timing of deferral elections.
Generally, deferral elections are required to be on file with the employer before the employee has a “legally binding right” to the compensation. 
Election filed prior to the calendar year salary, commission and some bonuses are earned.
Later elections for certain types of contingent compensation ("performance-based" pay earned over 12 months or more, rights subject to forfeiture, etc.)
Sign-on, retention, spot bonus, project bonus, severance at the time the compensation is awarded or negotiated.
Unfunded plan.
With unfunded deferred compensation plans, the employer may purchase insurance to help satisfy its obligations under the plan, but the nonqualified deferred compensation plan should not tie the amount of benefits directly to the amounts payable under the life insurance policy. Note that the employee should have only the rights of an unsecured general creditor.
Forfeiture of benefits.
Some common provisions relating to forfeiture of benefits in unfunded deferred compensation plans include:
Forfeiture provisions usually will be included only if the amounts deferred are supplemental benefits provided by the employer; normally the employee would not voluntarily defer current compensation if there is risk that he or she will forfeit those amounts (however, as discussed below, deferral plans for tax-exempt organizations often must include forfeiture provisions).
Income tax consequences for employees.
If the plan is designed properly, compensation will not be included in the employee's taxable income until paid under the terms of the plan. Four rules must be considered—the constructive receipt doctrine, the economic benefit doctrine, IRC §83, and IRC §409A.
Constructive Receipt Doctrine does not require immediate taxation.
Although individuals (as cash-basis taxpayers) normally include amounts in taxable income only when the amount is actually received, under the "constructive receipt doctrine," the individual is taxed on the amount when it is made available to him or her so that he or she may draw upon it at any time. For example, if an individual receives a check for services performed in 2008, he or she cannot simply hold the check and then cash it in 2009 and defer the tax on the amount from 2008 to 2009. The applicable Treasury Regulations provide that an amount is not constructively received if "the taxpayer's control of its receipt is subject to substantial limitations or restrictions." Whether a taxpayer has constructively received an amount depends on the facts and circumstances of the particular case. The constructive receipt doctrine does not require immediate taxation when the nonqualified deferred compensation arrangement is properly structured.
In a nonqualified deferred compensation arrangement, the employee receives no present benefit. The employee is only an unsecured creditor.
The benefits are includible in taxable income when they are paid or made available, whichever is earlier.
Under the "economic benefit" doctrine, an employee will be taxed on certain rights if the employee enjoys the economic benefits from those rights. Under this doctrine, benefits are included in gross income when assets are unconditionally and irrevocably transferred into a fund for the employee's sole benefit and the employee has a nonforfeitable vested interest. In Minor v. United States, 772 F.2d 1472 (9th Cir. 1985), the court stated that "the economic benefit doctrine is applicable only if the employer's promise is capable of valuation," and "a current economic benefit is capable of valuation where the employer makes a contribution to an employee's deferred compensation plan which is (i) nonforfeitable, (ii) fully vested in the employee, and (iii) secured against the employer's creditors by a trust arrangement." Since the employee's rights will not be "secured against the employer's creditors," the economic benefit doctrine should not trigger immediate taxation upon the creation of the NQDC plan.
Section 83 does not require immediate taxation but includes in income the value of "property" transferred to an employee or independent contractor in exchange for services rendered, when the property becomes transferable or is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, whichever occurs earlier. For purposes of § 83, an unfunded and unsecured promise to pay money or property in the future is not "property." Thus, as long as the employer’s promise under the plan is "unfunded and unsecured," Section 83 will not apply and will not cause taxation before the benefit is paid. The benefits under a non-qualified deferred compensation plan are considered to be "unfunded" as long as the employee has no rights in any specific assets of the employer, the deferred amounts are subject to the claims of the employer's general creditors, and the employee has no power to assign his or her rights. The benefits are "unsecured" as long as the employee is considered merely a general creditor of the company.
New IRC §409A does not require immediate taxation.
Plans that are documented and administered according to the requirements under IRC§409A will not cause deferrals to be immediately taxed. Although the final regulations under IRC §409A are lengthy, the basic components of an IRC §409A-compliant plan are:
State tax laws do not require immediate taxation.
State tax laws generally follow federal law as to the timing of income inclusion. 
Amounts are subject to Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax (FICA) and Federal Unemployment Tax Act tax at the later of (i) when the services are rendered or (ii) when the compensation is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. 
Generally, the employee already has income above the wage base ($113,700 in 2013) for purpose of the Old Age, Survivors, Disability Insurance (OASDI) portion of the FICA tax; however, the deferred compensation will be currently subject to the hospital insurance portion of the FICA tax (referred to as the "HI" portion, or "Medicare Tax") because the hospital insurance wage base is unlimited. The employee portion of the Medicare Tax is 1.45% of wages.
Tax consequences for employers.
The employer cannot claim a deduction until the benefits are taxable to the employee.
ERISA considerations.
An unfunded plan is exempt from a majority of the provisions of ERISA as long as it constitutes a "Top Hat" plan.
Unfunded plans.
A Top Hat plan is an unfunded plan maintained by the employer to provide deferred compensation to a select group of management or highly compensated employees. If coverage extends beyond this group then the plan is not a Top Hat plan.
A plan with insurance contracts in which the premiums are paid by the employer is considered unfunded.
In Miller v. Heller, 915 F.Supp. 651 (S.D.N.Y. 1996), the court held that the deferred compensation plan was unfunded although the employer would pay the benefits from amounts received under a life insurance policy subject to a split-dollar plan.
Department of Labor (DOL) Advisory Opinion 81-11A provides that a deferred compensation plan internally financed with life insurance generally will be treated as unfunded if the following criteria are satisfied:
Belka v. Rowe Furniture Corp..
571 F. Supp. 1249 (D. Md. 1983), found that between 1.6% and 4.6% of the employees were covered by the plan and thus were a "top hat" group. In Duggan v. Hobbs, 99 F.3d 307 (9th Cir. 1996), the court concluded that a plan which covered one of the company’s twenty-three employees qualified as a "top hat" plan. 
However, no regulations explain what constitutes a top hat group. Some DOL advisory opinion letters have covered this issue. Letter 85-37A found that a plan was not a top hat plan even though only 50 of the highly compensated employees out of 750 employees were covered by the plan. In ruling, the DOL found that a broad range of salaries and positions were covered by the plan and thus concluded that it was not a top hat plan.
A plan that covers too large a percentage of the employer's work force will not benefit a "select group." 
"Significant Development in Demery v. Extebank Deferred Compensation Plan (B)," 216 F.3d 283 (2d Cir. 2000), the Second Circuit concluded that a plan could still qualify as a "top hat" plan even though (i) more than 15% of the employees were eligible to participate, and (ii) two or three of the participants were neither highly compensated nor management employees. Thus, while the old rule of thumb was 5% (based on Belka); Extebank appears to allow for up to 15% eligibility.
The Second Circuit determined that the term "primarily" applies to both benefits and participants.
Small number of participants who don’t meet Top Hat definition will not taint the plan.
Court considered qualitative factors in determining a Top Hat Group:
Court considered quantitative factors:
"Another Case": Gallione v. Flaherty, 70 F.3d 724. Court refers to number of members in the union when considering plan established for union management.
There does not appear to be an adoption by the DOL of the “highly compensated employee” definition found at IRC § 414(q).
"DOL Advisory Opinion 90-14A." The DOL has, however, indicated that a “top hat” group consists of those individuals who have the ability to affect or substantially influence the design and operation of the deferred compensation plan. DOL Advisory Opinion 90-14A (May 8, 1990).
"No DOL Regulations". Top Hat regulations are apparently not a priority with the DOL. DOL has announced that it is discontinuing its efforts to develop regulations. The announcement does not indicate whether the regulations project has been permanently withdrawn.
ERISA exemptions for Top Hat plans.
Top Hat plans are exempt from the following ERISA provisions:
ERISA requirements that apply to Top Hat plans.
Top Hat plans must comply with the following ERISA provisions:
Unfunded excess benefit plans.
An unfunded excess benefit plan is defined as a plan solely to provide benefits for certain employees and solely to provide benefits in excess of the limits under IRC § 415.
Employee created plan.
Also note that in certain situations, Employee created plans should avoid ERISA.

Samuel Jarvis (American)

Samuel Jarvis (Dececember 27, 1720, Stamford, Connecticut - September 1, 1780, Saint John, New Brunswick) was father to William Jarvis, the head of the Toronto Jarvis clan.
Jarvis was born in Stamford to Captain Samuel Jarvis, an American Loyalist and Naomi Griffin. Samuel Jarvis served as long time town clerk of Stamford, Connecticut and was forced to resign due to his loyalty to the British in 1760. After fleeing Connecticut, Jarvis joined the British Army and became a brigadier general and commanded a loyalist regiment. Captured and imprisoned in 1778, Jarvis was freed, but he was no longer useful to the British. He later fled with wife Martha Seymour and some of his family to Saint John, New Brunswick.

RORA Elevation

Round Oak Rag Apple Elevation (born 1965, often abbreviated RORA Elevation), was one of the most influential artificial insemination Holstein/Friesian bulls of the last century. Elevation was named bull of the century by the Holstein International Association in 1999. Elevation was sired by Tidy Burke Elevation, a highly inbred bull from the Burke bloodline. His dam, Round Oak Ivanhoe Eve, was sired by the famous 1950's bull Osborndale Ivanhoe. Elevation was born in Virginia, bred by Ronald Hope, and was later owned by the artificial insemination company Select Sires. Elevation had many famous sons, including Sweet-Haven Tradition, Rockalli Son of Bova, Marshfield Elevation Tony and Straight-Pine Elevation Pete. In Canada, he had Hanoverhill Starbuck, an influential sire of sons worldwide. As of April 2009, Elevation is considered to be the bull with most actual descendents in the United States, by the "Sire Summaries April 2009", of the Holstein Association.
Elevation's impact.
Elevation had an influence worldwide through his sons, grandsons and great-grandsons. Elevation came from a combination of the Rag Apple Bloodline with the Burke bloodline, which came to have a good result. These are a few of his actual descendents:
Hanoverhill Starbuck - Well known for his famous sons and grandsons, Starbuck has had many descendents worldwide. In Canada, he had Madawaska Aerostar, Hanoverhill Raider, Duregal Astre Starbuck, Ronnybrook Prelude and Browndale Stardust. In the United States, he had the superstar in conformation, Marcrest Encore, famous for his World Dairy Expo Supreme Champion daughter, Tri-Day Ashlyn (EX-96). In France, he had Besne Buck and his famous grandson, Fatal. In Italy, came Sabbiona Bookie, as well as other sons in different parts of the world.
Madawaska Aerostar – Aerostar became one of the first Starbuck sons to be proofed, and one of the first to sell one million doses of frozen semen. His sons in Canada were Maughlin Storm and the Millionaire Sires Startmore Rudolph and Oliveholme Aeroline. In the US, he had Parker Aero Wade and Ladys-Manor Winchester. In Great-Britain, he became successful for the famous brood cow, Condon Aero Sharon (EX-91) dam of Picston Shaker, and the most successful 2nd crop sire of the 21st century: Picston Shottle.
Hanoverhill Raider – Raider was successful with his son, Comestar Lee, sire of the famous Ashlyn son, EK-Oseeana Aspen, Idee Lustre's son, Wedgwood Laramie and Shoremar S Alicia's son, BKB Affirmed. Lee is also known for his grandson in the US, Den-K Marshall LL Laurin.

Community Radio Network (Australia)

The Community Radio Network in Australia is a satellite program feed available to subscribing community radio stations. It was created and is managed by the Community Broadcasting Association of Australia (CBAA). The CRN does not produce the programs that are broadcast on the feed, but acts as a distributor of material supplied by member stations. 
History.
After more than a decade of exchanging programs between stations on tape via mail, the CBAA established the Community Radio Satellite, known as ComRadSat in 1993. Four media organisations have co-operated to make the satellite service available to community radio stations all over Australia. These are the CBAA, the Australian Indigenous Communications Association, Radio Print Handicapped Network and the BBC World Service. Each organisation transmits their programs via Optus onto the C1 Satellite via the uplink site at Belrose. 
In December 2013, CRN, RPH, NIRS and BBC World Service is shifting to VAST satellite platform.
Channels.
The satellite feed is four distinct channels:
Channel 14.
The Community Radio Network channel has a number of elements to the program feed. 
Funding.
The CBAA maintains the satellite service through a combination of station subscription fees, an operating grant from the Community Broadcasting Foundation and fundraising such as paid program time. The radio stations can apply for a specific grant from the Community Broadcasting Foundation to purchase and install the satellite receiving equipment. 
Digital Delivery Network.
Another aspect to the CRN is the DDN. The Digital Delivery Network works alongside the CRN satellite feed through online applications. A radio station can select its preferred programs on the DDN website and the stations’ DDN-enabled computer will automatically record the selected programs. Three months worth of current music content in a variety of genres is also made available for stations to use.

Horninglow railway station

Horninglow railway station is a former railway station in Horninglow, a district of Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire.
History.
The station was opened by the North Staffordshire Railway in 1848 next to the level crossing of the A38/Derby Road where it entered Burton.
The line itself dated back to 1848, and, from 1878 was shared by the Great Northern Railway (Great Britain) with its Derbyshire Extension.
The station buildings were more substantial than at Rolleston, being a single storey of half-timbered brick construction. A small waiting room was added on the second platform at the request of the Board of Trade in 1888. It closed to passengers on 1 January 1949. Although the station was no longer used as a stop for the 'Tutbury Jinnie' (as the local Burton-Tutbury passenger service was affectionately known), it continued to be used for occasional holiday excursion trains and the line remained in use for freight until 2 April 1966 when the last train - a short freight headed by a diesel shunter - passed through and was greeted by a half dozen railway fans. The signal box adjacent the station, which had been active until then, closed the same day.
Post Closure History.
The platforms were trimmed in the sixties and the building converted into a cafe. The outside toilet and station building/cafe remained until the 1990s, when they were demolished to make way for housing. The stationmaster's house, across the road from the station, eventually became a private dwelling and is still occupied today.

Helvering v. Davis

Helvering v. Davis, 301 U.S. 619 (1937), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court, which held that Social Security was constitutionally permissible as an exercise of the federal power to spend for the general welfare, and did not contravene the 10th Amendment. The Court defended the constitutionality of the Social Security Act of 1935, requiring only that welfare spending be for the common benefit as distinguished from some mere local purpose. It affirmed a District Court decree that held that the tax upon employees was not properly at issue, and that the tax upon employers was constitutional.
Facts.
A shareholder of the Edison Electric Illuminating Co brought a derivative action to restrain the company from making payments and deductions required by the Social Security Act 1935 on the ground that it was unconstitutional. He sought an injunction, and a declaration that the Act was void. 
Judgment.
The Opinion of the Supreme Court in the case was written by Justice Benjamin N. Cardozo. This decision supported the right of the Congress to interpret the "general welfare" clause in the U.S. Constitution.
Joining the decision was Justice Harlan Stone, who during the drafting of the legislation had advised Secretary Frances Perkins that the constitutionality of Social Security could be based upon "The taxing power of the Federal Government, my dear; the taxing power is sufficient for everything you want and need."

STEPS Centre

The STEPS Centre (Social, Technological and Environmental Pathways to Sustainability) is an interdisciplinary global research and policy engagement hub, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council. The Centre brings together development studies with science and technology studies and was launched at Portcullis House in London on 25 June 2007 
By acknowledging the interactions between social, technological and environmental factors in diverse local settings the STEPS Centre seeks to help create more sustainable and socially just conditions for poorer people. Based at the Institute of Development Studies (IDS) and SPRU Science and Technology Policy Research (formerly called Science Policy Research Unit) at the University of Sussex in the UK. The Centre works with partners in Africa, Asia and Latin America.
Professor Melissa Leach is the director of the STEPS Centre while Professor Andy Stirling and Professor Ian Scoones are co-directors.
Advisory Board.
The STEPS Centre Advisory Board is chaired by Professor Judi Wakhungu, Executive Director, African Centre for Technology Studies, Kenya with members including Professor Mohammed Hassan, President, African Academy of Sciences (AAS), Professor Sheila Jasanoff, Pforzheimer Professor of Science and Technology Studies, University of Harvard, Dr Tony Marjoram Programme Specialist responsible for Engineering, UNESCO, Professor Shiv Visvanathan Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, India and Dr Joachim Voss Director General, International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), Columbia.
Areas of work.
The STEPS Centre brings together social scientists and natural scientists to work together to try and achieve a breakthrough in thinking and action for development. The Centre's unique ‘pathways’ approach interweaves social, technological and environmental conditions with dynamic change across three domains - food and agriculture; health and disease; water and sanitation - and three themes - dynamics; governance; designs.
Through linking across domains and themes in its projects, the STEPS Centre connects new theory with practical approaches in a bid to help provide sustainable opportunities for poor and marginalised people.
Pathways approach.
The STEPS Centre's pathways approach aims to understand the complex, non-linear interactions between social, technological and environmental systems. Some pathways may threaten poor peoples’ livelihoods and health while others create opportunities for sustainability.
The Centre aims to link social scientists, natural scientists and users to develop new tools and methods linking theory with practical solutions. It also offers teaching, in conjunction with IDS and SPRU, to help train a new generation of researchers on MA and PhD courses.
A paper published in 2007 entitled Pathways to Sustainability: an Overview of the STEPS Centre Approach outlined the STEPS Centre approach to understanding dynamic systems and their governance. The paper laid out the ingredients of the STEPS Centre's work, including linking diverse social and natural science perspectives, connecting theory, policy and practice and an engaged, interactive approach to communications. Promoting pathways to Sustainability that meet the perspectives and priorities of poor and marginalised groups is at the heart of the pathways approach.
Policy engagement.
The STEPS Centre seeks to ensure that environmental sustainability and making science and technology work for the poor become principal concerns for the people that make policy. It aims to advance policy debate through collaborative work with local, national and international government, and governmental agencies that generates debate and enhances citizen engagement.
Projects.
Among the STEPS Centre's projects are:
•"Innovation, Sustainability, Development: A New Manifesto" (40 years on from the Sussex Manifesto)
• "Crop, disease and innovation in Kenya - Maize and farming system dynamics in areas affected by climate change"
• "Urbanisation in Asia - urbanisation and sustainability on the expanding peri-urban fringe of Delhi, India"
• "Rethinking regulation - assumptions and realities of drug and seed regulation in China and Argentina"
• "Risk, uncertainty and technology - framing and responses to risks and uncertainties in areas of rapid scientific and technological advance"
• "Epidemics, livelihoods and politics" - HIV-AIDS, SARS, ‘avian flu, BSE - procedures for addressing epidemics that support rather than compromise poor people

Obstructive shock

Obstructive shock is a form of shock associated with physical obstruction of the great vessels or the heart itself. Pulmonary embolism and cardiac tamponade are considered forms of obstructive shock.
Obstructive shock has much in common with cardiogenic shock, and the two are frequently grouped together.
Some sources do not recognize obstructive shock as a distinct category, and categorize pulmonary embolism and cardiac tamponade under cardiogenic shock.
References.
Aetiology:-
1/cardiac tamponade or pericadial tamponade (condition where the fluid accumlautes within the pericardium).
2/constrictive pericariditis seen in the later stage.

Socket G34

Socket G34 is a land grid array CPU socket designed by AMD to support AMD's multi-chip module Opteron 6000-series server processors. G34 was launched on March 29, 2010, alongside the initial grouping of Opteron 6100 processors designed for it. Socket G34 supports four DDR3 SDRAM channels, two for each die in the 1944 pin CPU package. Socket G34 is available in up to four-socket arrangements, which is a change from the current Socket F CPUs supporting up to eight-socket arrangements. However, four Socket G34 CPUs have eight dies, which is identical to what eight Socket F CPUs have. AMD declined to extend Socket G34 to eight-way operation citing shrinking demand of the >4-socket market. AMD is targeting Socket G34 at the high-end two-socket market and the four-socket market. The lower-end two-socket market will be serviced by monolithic-die Socket C32 CPUs with half the core count as the equivalent Socket G34 CPUs.
Development.
Socket G34 originally started out as Socket G3, which used the G3MX to expand memory capacity. Socket G3 and G3MX were canceled altogether, and replaced with Socket G34.
Supported CPUs.
Socket G34 was introduced in March of 2010 with the K10-based 8-core and 12-core "Magny-Cours" Opteron 6100 series CPUs. Socket G34 also supports the current Bulldozer-based 4-core, 8-core, 12-core and 16-core Opteron 6200 "Interlagos" CPUs and the recently released Piledriver-based 4-core, 8-core, 12-core and 16-core Opteron 6300 "Abu Dhabi" CPUs.

Young, Jewish, and Left

Young, Jewish, and Left is an American documentary that presents several US-based leftist Jews grappling with identity, politics, and culture.
Synopsis.
"Young, Jewish, and Left" combines queer culture, Jewish-Arab history, secular "Yiddishkeit", anti-racist analysis, and religious traditions into a multi-layered picture of the circa 2006 Jewish Left. Personal experiences from many of the era's leading Jewish activists frame Jewish identity in what it the official website says is "a fresh and constructive take on race, spirituality, Zionism, queerness, resistance, justice, and liberation."
Dan Berger, in "Left Turn" magazine, writes: "Young Jewish and Left provides a beautiful cross-section of today's visionary thinkers, activists, and artists. The film celebrates the profound legacy of resistance among Jews—and criticizes the reactionary elements in Jewish communities, from the occupation to assimilation, patriarchy and homophobia. And it calls the Left to task for generally lacking an understanding of Jewish history or culture.
Jennifer Bleyer, on Nextbook argues that it "... proves that the legacy of Jewish socialists, anarchists, feminists, Yippies, hippies, organizers, and agitators of the past century lives on..."

New York Interscholastic Athletic Association

The New York Interscholastic Athletic Association, or "Interscholastic League," pioneered the formation of high school leagues, when it was formed in the spring of 1879 to conduct a track and field meet. The league was exclusively composed of private day-school institutions in the New York metropolitan area. Notable members of the league included Berkeley, Cutler, Barnard, Columbia Grammar School, Trinity, and Dwight.
Sports.
In 1892, during the winter, Berkeley School conducted the first open indoor-track meet for league members, and in the spring the league introduced baseball as a league competition. In the fall, the league introduced a league championship schedule for football (although some members of the league had played football since at least the fall of 1884). Other sports soon followed, with the adoption of tennis in 1894, ice skating in 1897, ice hockey in 1898, and basketball in 1898. The "New York Times" devoted almost all its coverage of secondary school sports to the New York Interscholastic League, probably because the sons and daughters of the readers of the paper went to those schools.
Student involvement.
The league was organized by the students and they represented their various schools in league meetings. In the various sports, captains directed and coached the teams, and managers handled the schedules, finances, and overall business of the teams. The schoolboy-run league decided on certain issues such as eligibility requirements, such as age limits, which in the league was twenty. In 1894, the League voted on a new constitution and formed a Board of Arbitration to handle disputes. The Board of Arbitration was made up of one faculty member from each school, thus establishing a dual league administration of students and faculty. The Interscholastic League had even prior to that time had worked with adult administrators, forming alliances with such groups as the University Athletic Club and the Knickerbocker Athletic Club, which managed the indoor and outdoor track and field meets in fields and armories. Many of the athletes from the schools belonged to private athletic clubs and regiment armory teams as well, getting their athletic training.
Collapse of the league.
The emergence of public high school athletic activity after 1900 and the decline in the importance of private day schools in the metropolitan area meant a shift in power in football and other sports around 1903. The league collapsed in the season of 1903-1904, but the outdoor track meet and baseball continued to be contested among the schools that historically had been members. The newspapers would occasionally recognized football games in subsequent seasons as “Interscholastic” contests. But whereas as in the fall of 1902 almost exclusive coverage was devoted to activities of the football teams of the New York Interscholastic League, by 1904 virtually no football coverage on the league appeared in the newspapers. In the last league contest, a track and field meet in 1909, only DelaSalle, Cutler, and Bernard were participants.

The Reckless Driver

The Reckless Driver is the 19th animated cartoon short subject in the "Woody Woodpecker" series. Released theatrically on August 26, 1946, the film was produced by Walter Lantz Productions and distributed by Universal Pictures.
Plot.
Woody discovers that his drivers' license is due for renewal, and quickly heads for the nearest Department of Motor Vehicles. Upon arrival, Woody attempts to awaken sleeping Officer Wally Walrus (voiced by William Wright) so he can complete the test.
First up is the eye test, complete with an eye chart whose letters spell out "I CAN'T SEE A THING." Then comes the reflex test, in which Woody violently pecks at Wally's head whenever he gets his knee jabbed. Next, Wally tries to get a fingerprint from Woody, only to have the two stack their hands high into the air.
Finally, Woody must complete the actual driving test. The careless woodpecker accidentally backs up into a wall. A fire extinguisher then falls off the wall and onto the back of Woody's car, providing him with steam propulsion. With this new power, Woody starts zooming in the air and in and out of the office, driving Wally insane. At the conclusion of the driving test, Woody blurts out, "Say, I've changed my mind. I want a pilot's license".

Beth Sarim

Beth Sarim (Hebrew בית שרים "House of the Princes") is a ten-bedroom mansion in San Diego, California, constructed in 1929 in anticipation of various resurrected Old Testament biblical patriarchs or prophets such as Abraham, Moses, David, Isaiah and Samuel. It was maintained by the Watch Tower Society, the parent organization used by Jehovah's Witnesses, and was also used as a winter home and executive office for Watch Tower president Joseph Franklin Rutherford.
Background.
In 1918, Watch Tower publications began predicting, under the direction of Rutherford, that Old Testament patriarchs or "princes" would be resurrected back to earthly life in 1925. It was taught that these "princes" would become earth's new leaders and that their resurrection would be a prelude to the inauguration of a new earthly society and the abolition of death. (It had previously been taught that these individuals were to be raised shortly after 1914.) These "princes" would use Jerusalem as their capital, with some of the "princes" being located in other "principal parts of the earth." Despite the failure of this prediction, Rutherford continued to preach their imminent return.
During this time, Rutherford spent winters in San Diego, California, for health reasons, and "in time, a direct contribution was made for the purpose of constructing a house in San Diego for brother Rutherford's use." The property was acquired in October 1929 by Robert J Marten and was given to Rutherford in December for the nominal fee of $10 (current equivalent $). The house was built in that year. Rutherford named the property "Beth Sarim" and dedicated it for the use of the expected Old Testament "princes", who were now expected to be headquartered in San Diego instead of Jerusalem. The deed for Beth Sarim, written by Rutherford, said that the property was to be held "perpetually in trust" for the Old Testament "princes" and was to be surrendered to them once they arrived. It was located in the Kensington Heights section of San Diego over an area of about , landscaped with olive, date, and palm trees so that the "princes" would "feel at home." The residence, designed by San Diego architect Richard S. Requa, is a ten-bedroom Spanish mansion with an adjacent two-car garage. The building costs at the time were about $25,000 (current equivalent $). Writing in the book "Salvation" in 1939, Rutherford explained that Beth Sarim would forever be used by the resurrected "princes".
Occupation.
Rutherford moved into Beth Sarim in early 1930 and served as caretaker of the property awaiting the resurrection of the "princes". Newspapers of the time reported on Rutherford's lavish lifestyle, which included a 16-cylinder "Fisher Fleetwood" Cadillac coupe. The residence was cited by Olin R. Moyle, former legal counsel for Jehovah's Witnesses, in a letter to Rutherford in 1939, as one of the examples of "the difference between the accommodations furnished to you, and
your personal attendants, compared with those furnished to some of your brethren." Walter F. Salter, former manager of the Canadian branch of the Watch Tower Society, also criticized Rutherford's use of Beth Sarim. A reply to Salter's criticisms of Rutherford was published in the May 2, 1937 "Golden Age", with a photocopy of a letter from W.E. Van Amburgh, Secretary-Treasurer of the Watch Tower Society, stating:
The magazine "Consolation" (successor to "The Golden Age") explained that Beth Sarim served as Rutherford's winter headquarters:
Rutherford's burial.
Rutherford died at Beth Sarim on January 8, 1942 at the age of 72. After his death, Rutherford's burial was delayed for three and a half months due to legal proceedings arising from his desire to be buried at Beth Sarim, which he had previously expressed to three close advisers from Brooklyn headquarters. Watchtower attorney Hayden C. Covington explained his role in the lawsuit: "I filed a lawsuit then in the courts out there in San Diego to force them to let us bury him out there on that property. Judge Mundo, who was the judge of the Superior Court, heard it and passed the buck, jumping from one thing to another, from one technicality to another, and finally after looking at the matter in a reasonable way Bill, Bonnie, and Nathan and all of us decided that we have fought enough on this and it looks like its the Lord's will that we take his body back to Brooklyn, and have him buried in Staten Island, which we did." Witnesses collected over 14,000 signatures on a petition that Rutherford's dying wish might be granted. The May 27, 1942 "Consolation" explained:
"Consolation" condemned San Diego County officials for their refusal to grant a permit for Rutherford's burial at Beth Sarim or on a neighboring property named Beth Shan, also owned by the Watchtower Society:
After all appeals were exhausted, "Consolation" stated that Rutherford's remains were shipped to New York where he was buried on April 25, 1942. Critics have speculated that Rutherford was secretly buried at Beth Sarim. The May 4, 1942 issue of Time magazine noted Rutherford's burial at Rossville, New York, on Staten Island; a private burial plot for Watch Tower branch volunteers is on Woodrow Road. The exact grave location is unmarked; in 2002, a caretaker at Woodrow United Methodist Church and Cemetery (an adjoining graveyard) answered an inquiry about Watch Tower's plot by noting "I couldn't tell you who is buried on it because it has absolutely no markers or headstones or anything".
Sale of property.
After Rutherford's death, the Watchtower Society maintained Beth Sarim for a few years, before selling the property in 1948. The belief that the "princes" would be resurrected before Armageddon was abandoned in 1950. In 1954, when asked at a trial in Scotland why the property was sold, Watch Tower spokesman Frederick William Franz explained:
The house is now privately owned and has been designated Historical Landmark number 474 by the City of San Diego.

342d Fighter-Day Wing

The 342d Fighter Day Wing (FDW) is an inactive United States Air Force wing. Its last duty assignment was at Myrtle Beach AFB, South Carolina.
History.
Operational history.
On 25 July 1956, the 342d Fighter Day Wing was established and activated at Myrtle Beach AFB, South Carolina. The Wing's subordinate components were the 342d Fighter-Day Group; the 342d Air Base Group and the 455th Fighter-Day Group, all being assigned to the wing as subordinate units.
The Wing Commander was Colonel Robert G. Emmens.
The total manpower force of the 342d FDW at the time of its activation was 20 Officers, 1 Warrant Officer and 241 enlisted men, with the majority of the personnel being reassigned from the 4434th Air Base Squadron, (established on 9 April 1956) being redesignated as the 342d Air Base Group on 25 July 1956.
On 10 September 1956, the 342d FDW received a new commander, Colonel Francis S. Gabreski. Colonel Emmens assumed the role of Deputy Base Commander at that time.
The 342 FDW's mission was officially that of a fully functional fighter-day wing. In reality, the efforts and activities of the 342 FDW were directed to reach operational capabilities by overcoming the problems and obstacles inherent in the activation of a new fighter wing on a base sill largely under construction. Close liaison was maintained between units at Shaw AFB, SC for many activities. There were regularly scheduled truck convoys between Shaw and Myrtle Beach during the Wing's development.
The 342 FDW lasted 117 days until 18 November 1956. On 19 November, the Air Force redesignated the unit as the 354th Fighter-Day Wing, absorbing all personnel and assets of the 342d FDW. The 342d FDW and 342d FDG was inactivated along with the 455th Fighter-Day Group

Leeds International Pool

The Leeds International Pool often referred to as the Leeds International Baths, was a swimming facility in Leeds city centre, West Yorkshire, England. The pool was situated at the lower end of Westgate and was notable for its brutalist architecture. The pool was constructed in the 1960s and designed by architect John Poulson.
The facility closed in October 2007 and was jointly replaced by the Aquatics Centre at the John Charles Centre for Sport (former South Leeds Stadium) in the south of the city and partly by 'The Edge' sports centre at the University of Leeds which has periods open to non-university members. The building stood unused until late 2009, when demolition commenced. In the interim it was subject to vandalism.
Controversy.
The building was controversial from its opening in 1967. Although in the first six months of opening, the facilities were used by over 220,000 people (then, nearly half the population of Leeds), the building spent many of its early days closed for repairs and alterations. The architect John Poulson was convicted in 1974 of fraud in connection with the awarding of building contracts. Other buildings designed by Poulson include the now redeveloped Cannon Street Station in London.
Future.
After the closure of the building, its demolition at one stage seemed unlikely after plans to build the skyscraper "The Spiracle" were cancelled. The building would have been difficult to convert for other uses, and the likelihood of a private company wanting to run the outdated swimming pool was unlikely, especially as Leeds by then had facilities at the John Charles Centre for Sport. However the building itself was popular, particularly with admirers of brutalism and twentieth century architecture such as the 20th Century Society.
Replacement facilities.
The replacement facilities at the John Charles Centre for Sport offer a larger diving pool with a movable floor for adjusting the depth, an olympic sized pool with three booms for easy division and larger spectator areas. The new facilities adjoin an athletics and rugby league stadium, used by Hunslet Hawks, as well as indoor bowling facilities and tennis courts. The new facilities also offer ample free parking. They are however less accessible for people living in the North of Leeds and other towns within the City of Leeds such as Otley and Wetherby. The John Charles Centre for Sport, is bordered by Beeston, Hunslet and Middleton and is accessible from the M1, M62 and M621.
Demolition.
Demolition began in the autumn of 2009. The walls to the Western face of the centre have been removed. The walls to the Eastern side of the building were removed next, leaving only the roof standing upon its support columns, and internal structure.
Following demolition the site has not been redeveloped and since 2010 has been operated as a car park by Leeds City Council.

Long Island Interscholastic Athletic League

The Long Island Interscholastic Athletic League was the second most prestigious early league in the New York metropolitan area after the New York Interscholastic Athletic Association. The membership was a combination of public and private schools in Brooklyn, Queens, and other areas of Long Island. The league was formed in the fall of 1893, with four schools competing in football—Boys High of Brooklyn, Adelphi Academy, Polytechnic Institute, and Bryant & Stratton Business College. By the time of the league’s first track and field meet the following spring, three more schools had entered the league—Latin School, St. Paul’s, and Pratt Institute. The entrance of the venerable eighteenth century school, Erasmus Hall, into the league in 1898 added a second public school to the eight team league (Erasmus Hall was founded in 1787 as a private school, but in 1896 was added to the Brooklyn school system as a public school).
The first year the league sponsored football, track and field, baseball, and tennis. Particularly notable was the league's aggressive adoption of winter-time sports, having added handball, basketball, ice skating, indoor track, and ice hockey before the end of the decade. The league was begun and administered by the students of the various schools, and only deferred to adult supervision in establishing sites for the various events, namely indoor and outdoor track and field sites and indoor arenas for basketball, handball, and ice skating and hockey competition. As was the nineteenth century custom, the students at each school formed an athletic association to sponsor and organize competition. Delegates from each school association then met in league meetings to arrange schedules and organize interschool competition. Most all the competition was conducted at a loss. The winning school in each sport was usually awarded 25 dollars to purchase a trophy. 
In the first years after the turn of the century there was some conflict with school administrators over regulation and control of the league. After the formation of the Public Schools Athletic League (PSAL) in 1903, the Long Island League quickly faded. In the fall of 1904, not all the schools were even scheduled to play each other, and no football champion was reported by the "New York Times". The Brooklyn Boys' football championship in the fall of 1906 may have been the last league football champion. The Polytechnic Prep football championship in the fall of 1908 was probably a titular title, although the "New York Times" reported it as a league championship. The last league contest appears to have been the outdoor track and field meet of 1907, in which only Erasmus Hall and Polytechnic Prep participated.

The Seaward Defence Boats are large patrol craft designed by Mazagon Dock Limited (MDL) and built by Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers (GRSE) for the Indian Navy. Most of these vessels have been decommissioned, due to the large maintenance overhead they require.
Midlife Refits.
The ships of this class were built with low strength mild steel and thin plates, and consequently had low corrosion tolerance. As such adhering to prescribed docking intervals was essential.
INS Seaward (T54) was commissioned in September 1982. Its medium refit was due in March 1988 and its long refit in April 1992. Ignoring the vulnerability to corrosion of this ship, the medium refit was delayed by over three years and was carried out from July 1991 to April 1992. As a result, the long refit could not be planned. However, another short refit including the replacement of the engines was taken up in December 1993. The short refit was converted into a medium refit in February 1994. While carrying out repairs, extensive damage to the hull below the waterline was noticed in March 1994. The medium refit was extended to May 1996 because the engines and other materials procured for this ship were used for carrying out ongoing repairs on another, similar, ship (SDBT-55).

<doc id="18491202" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18491202" title="Prostigmata">
Prostigmata

The Prostigmata is a suborder of mites belonging to the order Trombidiformes, which contains the "sucking" members of the "true mites" (Acariformes). 
Many species are notorious pests on plants. Well-known examples of prostigmatan plant parasites are species of the gall mites (Eriophyidae, e.g. the redberry mite "Acalitus essigi"), Tarsonemidae (e.g. the cyclamen mite, "Steneotarsonemus pallidus"), and the spider mites of the Tetranychidae (e.g. the two-spotted spider mite, "Tetranychus urticae"). 
Other Prostigmata live as parasites on vertebrates (e.g. "Demodex" mites of the Demodicidae) or invertebrates (e.g. "Polydiscia deuterosminthurus" of the Tanaupodidae or the honeybee tracheal mite, "Acarapis woodi", of the Tarsonemidae). There are also some forms (e.g. Smarididae) that are predators of small invertebrates – including smaller Prostigmata – yet others have a more varied lifestyle (e.g. Tydeidae) or switch their food sources as they mature (e.g. Erythraeidae). The suborder also include the family Halacaridae (marine mites).
Some of the Prostigmata parasitizing vertebrates are of medical relevance due to causing skin diseases in humans. These include for example harvest mites ("chiggers") of the Trombiculidae.
Systematics and taxonomy.
The Prostigmata make up the bulk of the acariform clade Trombidiformes, which also contains the minor and quite ancient lineage Sphaerolichida. The trombidiform mites are possibly the most promising approach to untangle the systematics, taxonomy and phylogeny of the notoriously complex Acariformes. Trombidiformes and the other acariform clade, Sarcoptiformes, were formerly considered suborders but this does not allow for a sufficiently precise classification of the mites and is adjusted in more modern treatments.
They contain a few of the little-known "Endeostigmata" – apparently an assemblage of several specialized but unrelated lineages – which for the most part appear to be Sarcoptiformes however. In addition, the Trombidiformes include the bulk of the presumed group of mites called "Actinedida". This taxon is still commonly encountered in systematic treatments. However, modern cladistic studies time and again fail to find any monophyletic group corresponding to the "Actinedida". Thus, they appear to be an evolutionary grade rather than an evolutionary lineage, united not by their apomorphies but by the lack of such characters that have evolved after the Acariformes separated from the Parasitiformes. Thus, the "Actinedida" seem to be a massively paraphyletic "wastebin taxon", uniting all Acariformes that are not "typical" Oribatida and Astigmata.
The Prostigmata present their own taxonomic and systematic problems even in the redefined monophyletic delimitation. They are variously subdivided into the Anystina and Eleutherengona, and Eupodina. The delimitation and interrelationships of these groups are entirely unclear; while most analyses find one of the latter two but not the other to be a subgroup of the Anystina, neither of these mutually contradicting hypotheses is very robust; possibly this is a simple error because phylogenetic software usually fails in handling non-dichotomous phylogenies. Consequently it may be best for the time being to consider each of the three main prostigmatan lineages to be equally distinct from the other two, not including either Eleutherengona or Eupodina in the Anystina in accord with the traditional view – the suborder Anystina are here considered the largest possible clade containing the Anystidae but no taxon assigned to the other two suborders.

Parametrix

In mathematics, and specifically the field of partial differential equations (PDEs), a parametrix is an approximation to a fundamental solution of a PDE, and is essentially an approximate inverse to a differential operator.
A parametrix for a differential operator is often easier to construct than a fundamental solution, and for many purposes is almost as good. It is sometimes possible to construct a fundamental solution from a parametrix by iteratively improving it.
Overview and informal definition.
It is useful to start reviewing what a fundamental solution for a differential operator "P"("D") with constant coefficients is: it is a distribution "u" on ℝ"n" such that
in the weak sense, where δ is the Dirac delta distribution. In a similar way, a parametrix for a variable coefficient differential operator "P"("x,D") is a distribution "u" such that
where ω is some C∞ function with compact support. The parametrix is a useful concept in the study of elliptic differential operators and, more generally, of hypoelliptic pseudodifferential operators with variable coefficient, since for such operators over appropriate domains a parametrix can be shown to exist, can be somewhat easily constructed and be a smooth function away from the origin. Having found the analytic expression of the parametrix, it is possible to compute the solution of the associated fairly general elliptic partial differential equation by solving an associated Fredholm integral equation: also, the structure itself of the parametrix reveals properties of the solution of the problem without even calculating it, like its smoothness and other qualitative properties
Parametrices for pseudodifferential operators.
More generally, if "L" is any pseudodifferential operator of order "p", then another pseudodifferential operator "L"+ of order "–p" is called a parametrix for "L" if the operators
are both pseudodifferential operators of negative order. The operators "L" and "L"+ will admit continuous extensions to maps between the Sobolev spaces "H""s" and "H""s"+k. On a compact manifold, the differences above are compact operators. In this case the original operator "L" defines a Fredholm operator between the Sobolev spaces.
Hadamard parametrix construction.
An explicit construction of a parametrix for second order partial differential operators based on power series developments was discovered by Jacques Hadamard. It can be applied to the Laplace operator, the wave equation and the heat equation. 
In the case of the heat equation or the wave equation, where there is a distinguished time parameter "t", 
Hadamard's method consists in taking the fundamental solution
of the constant coefficient differential operator obtained freezing the coefficients at a fixed point and seeking a general solution as a product of this solution, as the point varies, by a formal power series in "t". The constant term is 1 and the higher coefficients are functions determined recursively as integrals in a single variable. In general the power series will not converge but will provide only an asymptotic expansion of the exact solution. A suitable truncation of the power series then yields a parametrix.
Construction of a fundamental solution from a parametrix.
A sufficiently good parametrix can often be used to construct an exact fundamental solution by a convergent iterative procedure as follows .
If "L" is an element of a ring with multiplication * such that 
for some approximate right inverse "P" and "sufficiently small" remainder term "R" then, at least formally, 
so if the infinite series makes sense then "L" has a right inverse
If "L" is a pseudo-differential operator and "P" is a parametrix, this gives a right inverse to "L", in other words a fundamental solution, provided that "R" is "small enough" which in practice means that it should be a sufficiently good smoothing operator. If "P" and "R" are represented by functions, then the multiplication * of pseudo-differential operators corresponds to convolution of functions, so the terms of the infinite sum giving the fundamental solution of "L" involve convolution of "P" with copies of "R".

The New Jersey Interscholastic Athletic Association (NJIAA), formed in 1896, was the first high-school conference in the U.S. state of New Jersey, and was student-initiated and run. As with most student-run leagues, the students formed an alliance with adult organizations to provide facilities and officials, notably the New Jersey Athletic Club for their track and field meet. The league took in both public and private schools; its public-school members being Newark Central High School, Montclair High School, Plainfield High School and East Orange High School; its private-school members being Newark Academy, Bordentown Military Institute, Stevens Preparatory, Pingry School, and Montclair Military Academy. The league began with a track and field contest in 1896, and then expanded with football and tennis competition. The New Jersey Interscholastic Athletic Association split into separate private and public conferences after the turn of the 20th century.

Peter Eastgate

Peter Eastgate (born 13 December 1985) is a poker player from Denmark, best known as the winner of the Main Event at the 2008 World Series of Poker. At the time, he became the youngest player ever to win the event. He was subsequently surpassed by Joe Cada in 2009.
Early life.
Eastgate was raised in Dalum, a suburb of Odense, Denmark and went to Sct. Canute's Gymnasium, where he was introduced to poker by his classmates as he stated in season 5 of the show High Stakes Poker. He attended Aarhus University to study economics, but dropped out to play poker full-time.
Poker career.
World Series of Poker.
Eastgate qualified for the Main Event via the Ladbrokes Poker website, and travelled to Las Vegas as part of Team Ladbrokes. Eastgate reached the final table with 18,375,000 in starting chips, the fourth largest stack behind Scott Montgomery (19,690,000), Ivan Demidov (24,400,000) and Dennis Phillips (26,295,000). Eastgate and Demidov reached the 2008 World Series of Poker (WSOP) heads-up stage. At the final hand, Eastgate had 120.4 million in chips, and Demidov went all in with 16.5 million chips. Eastgate beat Demidov at 2:33 AM local time, after a two-day final table consisting of 274 hands that took 15 hours and 28 minutes to play. Eastgate won the first place prize of $9,152,416. 
By winning the Main Event at age 22, he became the then youngest WSOP Main Event champion, surpassing Phil Hellmuth, who was 24 when he won in 1989. He was surpassed as the youngest winner of the WSOP by Joseph Cada the following year at age 21
In 2009, Eastgate defended his Main Event title until day 6. He was eliminated in 78th place, defeated by a flush made on the river, and he was the last remaining Main Event Champion at the time of his elimination.
Other events.
Prior to the WSOP, Eastgate's live tournament results included a money finish in the 2008 European Poker Tour event in Copenhagen and a final table finish at the 2007 Irish Poker Open. Eastgate's previous biggest win was $46,714 at the 2007 Paddy Power Irish Open. After his WSOP Main Event victory Eastgate took to the tournament trail and quickly found success. He cashed in the European Poker Tour (EPT) PokerStars Caribbean Adventure (PCA) Main Event and then won the $5,000 side event for $343,000 Eastgate came second in the 2009 London EPT, winning £530,000.
In 2010, Eastgate finished 5th in the NBC National Heads-Up Championship in Las Vegas for $75,000.
As of 2010, his total live tournament winnings exceed $10,900,000.
Hiatus.
In July 2010, Eastgate announced that he was taking a break from poker in a statement through his sponsor PokerStars.com, saying, "When I started playing poker for a living, it was never my goal to spend the rest of my life as a professional poker player. My goal was to become financially independent. I achieved that by winning the WSOP main event in 2008. The period following has taken me on a worldwide tour, where I have seen some amazing places and met many new people; it has been a great experience." 
“In the 20 months following my WSOP win, I feel that I have lost my motivation for playing high-level poker along the way, and I have decided that now is the time to find out what I want to do with the rest of my life. What this will be, I do not yet know. I have decided to take a break from live tournament poker, and try to focus on Peter Eastgate, the person. I want to thank PokerStars, my friends and family for their support over the last 20 months, and for their support in my decision to take a break from poker." 
PokerStars said of Eastgate's decision: “We know that poker will miss this world-class player and world-class role model, but PokerStars has only the deepest respect for Peter’s decision. Poker is about determination and excitement, and if Peter lacks this in his game, the right decision is to take a break. Peter has played amongst world champions and he has carried his title in the most admirable fashion.”
In November 2010, Eastgate put his main event bracelet up for auction on eBay with a starting bid of $16,000. It eventually sold for $147,500 and this money was donated to UNICEF.
In February 2011, Eastgate announced that he would be ending his eight-month break to return to poker.

<doc id="18491295" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18491295" title="The Holocaust and the United Nations Outreach Programme">
The Holocaust and the United Nations Outreach Programme

United Nations General Assembly resolution 60/7 on Holocaust remembrance called for the establishment of a programme of outreach on the subject of the “Holocaust and the United Nations” and measures to mobilize civil society for Holocaust remembrance and education, in order to help to prevent future acts of genocide. Since its establishment by the Department of Public Information in January 2006, the Holocaust and the United Nations Outreach Programme has developed an international network of civil society groups and a multi-faceted programme that includes: innovative online educational products, youth outreach, DVDs, seminars and training programmes, a film series, book signings, a permanent exhibit at United Nations Headquarters in New York, and the annual worldwide observance of the International Day of Commemoration in memory of the victims of the Holocaust. 
The Programme has worked closely with Holocaust survivors to ensure that their stories are heard and heeded as a warning of the consequences of anti-Semitism and other forms of discrimination. It continues to combat Holocaust denial, also called for in General Assembly resolution 61/255. In all of its activities, with students around the world in particular, the Holocaust Programme draws essential links between the underlying causes of genocide, the lessons to be learned from the Holocaust and the promotion of human rights and democratic values today.
The International Day of Commemoration in memory of the victims of the Holocaust.
The International Day of Commemoration in memory of the victims of the Holocaust is observed each year on 27 January in the General Assembly Hall at United Nations Headquarters in New York City with a memorial ceremony on the theme “Remembrance and Beyond”, which serves to highlight and connect the two main elements of the Programme – remembering the victims of the Holocaust and helping to prevent future acts of genocide. The International Day is also widely observed with ceremonies and activities at UN offices around the world.
Educational Materials.
The Holocaust and the United Nations Outreach Programme supports the development of educational curricula by Member States on the lessons of the Holocaust in a number of ways. In cooperation with leading institutions on Holocaust studies, the Programme has developed a wide variety of educational tools. All are available and free upon request, and in all UN official languages - Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish. The Programme’s latest products are a study guide and companion DVD for high school students entitled “Women and the Holocaust: Courage and Compassion" and serve to better our understanding of women’s experiences during the Holocaust.
Other educational materials include the Discussion Papers Journal Series, which contains papers drafted by prominent experts on the Holocaust and genocide, among them Madame Simone Veil, Professor Yehuda Bauer, and Elie Wiesel. This publication provides a forum for scholars and experts on Holocaust and genocide from around the world to raise issues for debate and further study amongst secondary school and university students. The Programme also developed The Footprints for Hope initiative, which includes a short educational film titled “Footprints: Discovering the Holocaust through Historical Artefacts”, a power-point presentation and a lesson plan. These tools are designed for educators to introduce and explore the history of the Holocaust with primary school children through a discussion about an historical artefact, a child’s shoe found at Auschwitz-Birkenau. 
The Programme’s gateway website also offers a number of innovative information products and teaching resources on the Holocaust and prevention of genocide, such as teachers’ guidelines, the Electronic Notes for Speakers (an online pedagogical tool that provides concise, detailed information on the history and human experience of the Holocaust), etc.
Panel Discussions.
The Holocaust and the United Nations Outreach Programme has organized seven panel discussions to date on the topic of Holocaust awareness and genocide prevention attended by Member States, non-governmental organizations, students, educators and United Nations staff members.
1) The first panel discussion took place on 12 May 2006,organized with United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM), Yad Vashem, Levande Historia and the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) The seminar examined communication tools and educational resources on issues related to the Holocaust and genocide studies.
2) The Deputy Permanent Representative of Sierra Leone, the former Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Children and Armed Conflict, the New York Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and the Executive Director of the Institute for the study of genocide in New York, joined the Chair of the Secretary-General’s Advisory Committee on Genocide Prevention in a seminar held on 14 September 2006, which explored the causes of genocide and the role of the United Nations in helping to prevent it.
3) The third seminar, on “Combating Hatred” with the participation of the Special Adviser of the Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide, was held on 8 November 2007, the eve of the anniversary of the Kristallnacht Pogrom. The roundtable discussion featured speakers from civil society who shared best practices to overcome hatred, prejudice and intolerance in society.
4) The fourth seminar, “Saving Succeeding Generations”, was held on 26 June 2008 in collaboration with the United Nations University New York Office. The panelists included the Special Adviser to the United Nations Secretary-General on the Responsibility to Protect, representatives of Yad Vashem and USHMM, who engaged the audience in a discussion on individual and collective responsibility to protect those threatened by genocide and other crimes against humanity. 
5) In observance of the 70th Anniversary of the Kristallnacht pogrom, the Holocaust Programme organized a panel discussion on the theme “Nowhere to turn” on 10 November 2008 at the United Nations Headquarters. Holocaust scholars from New York University, the Centre for Jewish Studies of Shanghai and CUNY School of Law, as well as the Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations discussed the events on 9 November 1938, known as Kristallnacht, and their aftermath.
6) A seminar on “Learning about the Holocaust through Art” was held on 9 November 2009 in observance of the anniversary of the Kristallnacht pogrom. This special event, which included remarks by the Deputy Director of the Outreach Division and two of the artists depicted in the film titled As Seen through These Eyes, launched the Programme’s publication of the Discussion Papers Journal, and was dedicated to highlighting Holocaust education through art. 
7) On 20 May, the Holocaust Programme organized a one-day educators’ workshop on fostering human rights defenders within the community. The two-part event included an interactive discussion with the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide and a leading human rights activist, drawing on examples of racial discrimination during the Nazi era as well as contemporary cases of mass violence; and a workshop led by the Holocaust Programme and Facing History and Ourselves.
United Nations Information Centres.
The Holocaust and the United Nations Outreach Programme provides the global network of United Nations Information Centres Services (UNIS) and Offices (UNOs) in over 60 countries with guidelines on Holocaust Remembrance Day, teaching materials on the Holocaust and its underlying issues, and ongoing guidance on related topics to promote the lessons of the Holocaust in order to help to prevent future acts of genocide. Every year, the United Nations Information Centres observe the International Day of Commemoration with civil society groups and government representatives.
Partnerships.
The Holocaust and the United Nations Outreach Programme also collaborates with partners to identify ways to engage contemporary society in learning from the lessons of the Holocaust. 
In 2007 and 2008, the Holocaust Programme partnered with Holocaust institutions to organize four week-long regional seminars, designed to enhance the knowledge and skills of local level staff at the United Nations Information Centres worldwide in the areas of the Holocaust remembrance, human rights and the prevention of genocide. 
In 2009, the Holocaust Programme partnered with Paul Salmons of the Holocaust Education Development Programme at the University of London and Cornelia Reetz of the United Kingdom Holocaust Centre in producing the Footprints for Hope Project. This project brought the United Nations Information Centres and local schools together to stimulate interest among the students to learn about the Holocaust. 
In 2010 the Holocaust Programme, in partnership with the Anne Frank Center USA, launched a Twitter campaign in memory of Anne Frank, who perished in the Holocaust. Students from all over the world “tweeted” messages of support to Anne and shared their thoughts about what they have learned from her life.
Exhibits.
The Holocaust and the United Nations Outreach Programme helps to facilitate the organization of temporary exhibitions on Holocaust-related topics every year during the week of 27 January, the International Day of Commemoration in memory of the victims of the Holocaust. 
In 2011, the Holocaust Programme helped to organize two exhibitions: The Memories Live On, which features the drawings of Auschwitz made by an unknown prisoner of the concentration and death camp and focuses on the legacy of the survivors to young people; and Hélène Berr, A Stolen Life, which presents the persecution of Jews in Occupied France during World War II through the journal by this young woman who died in Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in 1945.
The Programme unveiled the permanent exhibit on the “Holocaust and the United Nations” at United Nations Headquarters in January 2008. The exhibit, developed with the assistance of Holocaust scholars, presents an overview of the Holocaust in the context of World War II and the founding of the United Nations. It is seen by the 400,000 visitors who visit United Nations Headquarters annually.
Film Screenings.
The Holocaust and the United Nations Outreach Programme has screened a dozen documentary and feature films on the Holocaust and the prevention of genocide. Many of the films have been shown both at the United Nations Headquarters in New York and in several United Nations Information Centres around the world.
The British film The Relief of Belsen was screened on 2 May 2011 in partnership with the United Kingdom Mission to the United Nations. The film tells the true story of the massive humanitarian effort by the British army in liberating Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in April 1945.
During the 2011 Holocaust Remembrance week, the Programme screened the documentary film Daring to Resist, which features the stories of three young Jewish women who fought back against the Nazis during the Holocaust.

Constant-current diode

Constant-current diode (also called CLD, current-limiting diode, diode-connected transistor or CRD, current-regulating diode) consists of a JFET with the gate shorted to the source, and it functions like a two-terminal current limiter or current source (analogous to a voltage-limiting Zener diode). They allow a current through them to rise to a certain value, and then level off at a specific value. Unlike Zener diodes, these diodes keep the current constant instead of the voltage constant. These devices keep the current flowing through them unchanged when the voltage changes. An example is the 1N5312.
Note the negative VGS is required, as an example on the n-type junction-gate field-effect transistor 2N5457

<doc id="18491338" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18491338" title="Districts of Redditch">
Districts of Redditch

Redditch is a town and local government district in north-east Worcestershire, England.
The town is divided into separate districts.
All street-name signs in Redditch have the street name in white lettering on a blue background and the district name in black lettering on a white background at the bottom of the sign. In the New Town areas the roads are usually named in alphabetical order and house numbering in the cul-de-sac closes is consecutive, starting with number 1 as the first house on the left as you enter, and the highest house number will be on the opposite side of the road as you leave.
Abbeydale.
Abbeydale, along with Batchley and Mayfields, were post-WWII 1950s housing estates built to cope with a population boom and the local councils enforcement of the Conservative government's 'Homes for Heroes' pledge after the United Kingdom general election, 1951.
Batchley.
Redditch United F.C.'s Valley Stadium is located off the Bromsgrove Road, in Batchley.
Batchley was a post-WWII housing estate, that today has a notorious reputation within the Borough, it is said to be the worst place to live within Redditch.
Brockhill.
Situated in the north west of the town. Almost entirely a residential area and home to many housing estates constructed in the last few years.
The district lends its name to Brockhill (HM Prison), a Young Offenders Institution at the Hewell Grange complex.
Church Green.
A commercial district and public space in the centre of Redditch, Church Green forms part of the town centre, however it is treated as a district and typically appears in addresses for buildings located there. Church Green forms a traditional centre for the town, like a village green or town square, and features a bandstand and fountain (see picture, right). Dominated by St Stephen's church, it is home to several banks, estate agents, charity shops, a Chinese restaurant and other businesses.
Church Green West historically formed part of the major trunk road, A441 from Birmingham to Evesham.
Church Hill.
The largest estate in Redditch, occupying the north-east corner of the town, Church Hill Ward has yearly elections of Councillors due to its size and the number of councillors. Church Hill has a distinctive layout similar to the Radburn model, with access roads Paper Mill Drive, Ravensbank Drive and Moons Moat Drive largely encircling the estate. Residences are almost exclusively built around cul-de-sacs. The estate comprises Moon's Moat, Marlfield Barn and Bomford Hill which boasts a Roman amphitheatre. Unlike the many monotenure housing estates in the UK and globally, but in common with many newer estates in Redditch Church Hill is divided into districts correlated with tenure:
with North and South parts separated by Church Hill Way (a buses only road), with Church Hill Centre in the middle. Church Hill's geometric layout, a characteristic of planned new town developments, largely separates private (North) residents from social (South) residents in their day-to-day lives, whilst bringing together the children of both sides of the community at common schools (in particular, at Church Hill Middle School). Church Hill North previously had its own first school, known as Marfield Farm First School, however this has since been closed and demolished. It has been characterised by some as something of a social planning experiment..
The estate is named after St Leonards church and the hill it stands on slightly north of Church Hill at Beoley.
Enfield.
Named after the Enfield Motorbike factory the area is mainly an industrial estate. The area was greatly improved during the industrial revolution as a main area in the town for the production of needles and fishing hooks. It is also the location of Mettis Arospace which during World War Two was a producer of parts for Spitfire aircraft. Opposite Mettis on Hemming Road was the old reddtch Gas works which have now been demolished and replaced with a series of apartment blocks and houses. It is also the home to Redditch Fire Station, Sainsbury Supermarket the centralised main distribution centre for Royal Mail.
Feckenham.
Feckenham is in practical terms a separate village, but is governed by Redditch Borough Council and counts administratively as a district.
Feckenham village arose because it straddled the ancient saltway track between Alcester and Droitwich (later a Roman road, now the modern B4090 road), and the early stretches of the Bow Brook.
Feckenham Forest once covered a substantial area of Worcestershire. It was used as a Norman royal hunting forest, and there was a royal hunting lodge near the village.
Headless Cross.
Like Crabbs Cross, Headless Cross was once a village in its own right, it is thought to be named after Headless Cross farm, which was situated roughly where Vaynor Drive is today. Headless Cross may be derived from "Smeethehedley", itself an indication of a role in Feckenham Forest.
It still maintains the old village green, which has recently been planted as a community orchard of local varieties of apples, pears and plums.
Keeping with the Redditch tradition of needle manufacture, Headless Cross once accommodated 3 needle works: the Needle Factory, located where Stonehouse Close is today; Phoenix Works on Birchfield Road and Mount Pleasant Mill on Evesham Road. A large brickworks was situated on Marlpit Lane, as well as a smaller one along Birchfield Road.
There are 2 schools in Headless Cross: The Vaynor First School and Walkwood CE Middle School, both located on Feckenham Road.
Due to its slight altitude advantage, both of Redditch's water towers were built in Headless Cross. The old one still stands having been converted into a private residence. The distinctive shape of the new water tower has become something of a local icon and can be seen dominating the skyline from as far as the Hollybush Inn on Gorcott Hill, approximately 6 km to the east in Warwickshire.
Black Sabbath's 1989 album "Headless Cross" is named after this district.
Ipsley.
Ipsley is home to the corporate headquarters of both engineering firm GKN and the Solicitors Regulation Authority. Ipsley is one of the few estates in the town to not have any Council owned housing. In common with Winyates Green, all homes in the Ipsley estate are privately owned.
Lakeside.
Lakeside is a largely industrial area of the town. Its location is within close proximity to the Arrow Valley Park. There is also a small housing estate.
Lodge Park.
Lodge Park is where St. Bede's Catholic Middle School is. 
Politically, Lodge Park is represented by two Redditch Councillors, they are;
Cllr Andrew Fry (Labour)
Cllr Mark Shurmer (Labour)
Matchborough.
Matchborough is a large district of Redditch. Its location lies between Winyates, Ipsley and Washford. Matchborough is the location of Arrow Vale High School and Matchborough First School. Matchborough consists of 2 areas, Matchborough East and Matchborough West, it also has a small shopping centre called Matchborugh Centre, similar to Church Hill and Winyates centres. Matchborough contains the area's most iconic feature, Matchborough Pond located near Arrow Vale High School.
Moons Moat.
The district of Moon's Moat is an industrial and business estate in the north east of Redditch between Church Hill and Winyates. Moon's Moat itself is located in Church Hill.
The district takes its name from an ancient moated homestead which was founded by Monks and dates back to the 12th century. It is now a listed heritage site. The medieval homestead was inhabited by the Mohun family which is where the name "Moon's" Moat comes from (Mohun being an early name for Moon). The homestead was last in use in the 18th century, but by the end that century the Mohuns had died out. The homestead fell into disuse and became a ruin. What was left of the homestead was removed so that nothing visible now remains on the site.
The Moon's Moat site is believed to be haunted by the ghost of Lady Mohun who is said to appear on or near to the site on the eve of St Agnes (21 January). There is some folklore and history associated with the site concerning a suicide and a murder which may explain the ghost story.
Oakenshaw.
Oakenshaw is a largely residential area with a mix of privately owned and social housing. There is a prominent McDonalds in the centre of Oakenshaw on the A441 traffic island and nearby is the largest retail outlet in Redditch, Tesco.
This area gets its name from Oakenshaw Farm, sometimes known as Pheasant Farm. The farm was located, where the underpass from Tesco to Greenlands is today, and a small lane ran from opposite Yvonne Road in Crabbs Cross to Oakenshaw Road in Greenlands, in which modern Oakenshaw lies upon. 
Oakenshaw South.
Oakenshaw South was built in the 1980s and consists of ten residential closes, all leading off Grangers Lane.
Built on land once belonging to Woodrow Farm, the particularly long pathway dividing Oakenshaw South is in fact the old lane linking the Slough to Woodrow Farm and then onto Studley Road. The Bridleway adjacent to Yarr Mill Close was the first stretch of the lane off the Slough, the pathway opposite carries on until the bend, where the lane was lifted to build Stoneleigh Close. The lane continues south towards Woodrow Drive, then rises to a pathed platform which was once the Redditch to Evesham Railway line. Woodrow Farm was located just before the rise and bend of the path, on the left looking towards the Rough Hill drive Round-a-bout. The old lane continued through what is now Bushley Close, Woodrow North to the Studley Road junction at Woodrow Centre.
Park Farm.
Park Farm is an area in south-east Redditch largely comprising industrial and commercial properties 
Politically, Park Farm is within the Lodge Park ward represented by Councillor Mark Shurmer, Labour, and Councillor Andrew Fry, Labour. Labour Party.
Riverside.
The Redditch area of Riverside runs alongside the River Arrow. Located between the areas of Enfield and Abbeydale is the location of Forge Mill Needle Museum and the ruins of Bordesley Abbey. Also located in Riverside is the Abbey Stadium Sports Complex and Redditch Crematorium. The Abbey Stadium has a swimming pool built in 2011. It gained some notoriety at that time as it is partially heated using waste heat from the nearby Crematorium.
Smallwood.
Named for the Smallwood Brothers, this area of Redditch contains the Smallwood Alms Houses and the old Victorian factories of Millsborough House. It is also the location of a very large B&Q Superstore and Matalan and also is the location of the new Redditch Mosque.
Southcrest.
Southcrest is a residential area of Redditch located on and to the south of Mount Pleasant to the south of the Town Centre, between the Town Centre and Headless Cross. It houses the Southcrest Hotel, Plymouth Road Cemetery and is one of the oldest areas of Redditch. Most of the older buildings date from the late Victoran era and include Southcrest Works which have now been renovated into privately owned apartments.
St Georges.
St Georges is a residential area of Redditch to the South East of the Town Centre. It is home to St George the Martyr Church, as well as St Georges Church of England First School.
Town Centre.
The primary commercial core of Redditch is the indoor shopping centre, the Kingfisher Centre. Designed like an out of town mall facility, with fully covered walkways and integrated multi-storey car parks, the Kingfisher Centre was built in place of several established Redditch town centre streets. The walkways are named after these streets.
The centre, along with Church Green and municipal buildings such as the Town Hall, Redditch Central Library and FE College are enclosed on three sides by the raised one-way, three-lane Redditch Ringway. Designed for access to the car parks, it illustrates the early "roads for prosperity" approach in new town design philosophy applied in the UK in the 1960s and 1980s.

It is home to the corporate headquarters of automotive and bicycle accessories retailer Halfords, along with many smaller businesses. It is named after the Washford Mill, which is now a popular public house and restaurant, though a Mill has stood on this site since 1066 and is mentioned in the Domesday Book. Many areas of Redditch have similar very early origins: Ipsley, Batchley, Feckenham, Bordesley and Beoley were all Saxon settlements.
Webheath.
Webheath is a district of Redditch, in Worcestershire, England. The district neighbours Batchley and the village of Callow Hill. It is also near Feckenham and Astwood Bank. Webheath used to be a village in its own right but is now part of the town of Redditch.

Ylon Schwartz

Ylon Schwartz (; born c. 1970) is a chess master and professional poker player from Brooklyn, New York, and a fourth place finisher in the $10,000 World Championship No Limit Hold'em Main Event of the 2008 World Series of Poker (WSOP), played on November 9, 2008. Prior to the Main Event, Schwartz had 11 career WSOP cashes. He is also a World Series of Poker bracelet winner. He used to play poker professionally online under the screen name "TenthPlanet".
Biography.
As a teenager, Schwartz saw streetside chess games in Manhattan's Washington Square Park, and won two dollars playing his first game. He was soon a regular, hustling $100 per day playing chess against passersby. Schwartz reached a peak rating of 2408 United States Chess Federation, and his ratings stood at 2304 from the USCF and 2259 from FIDE. He has attained the title of FIDE Master with a ranking above 2300. Schwartz grew up as an only child in the New York City borough of Manhattan. A self-described uninspired student, he left the Borough of Manhattan Community College, having failed out of the school after a year. He took a number of jobs after flunking out of college. It was as a public school special education assistant that he started playing chess for a few dollars on the side. He soon devoted full-time to gambling on backgammon, chess, darts and horses.
An inveterate gambler, Schwartz made $340 from passersby on wagers that he would be able to throw a lemon across a street onto the top of a Burger King restaurant on the other side. Schwartz had practiced the throw the previous night and knew he could win the bets. Schwartz was introduced to Texas hold 'em by Fat Nick, a fellow backgammon player. Schwartz entered a pair of poker tournaments at a club run by Fat Nick in 2000, winning both and walking away with $12,000 and a new passion. Schwartz has drawn comparisons between his tournament experience as a ranked chess master, noting that many of the skills he needed to succeed in chess are useful in poker and that the memory skills needed in chess transfer to retaining details on betting patterns of opponents needed to win in poker. He also pointed out that chess strategy provides excellent preparation for knowing when to time bets to prevent other players from folding when he has a good hand. Schwartz observed that the two games share the geometric relationships between the pieces on the chessboard and those connecting the cards and chip stacks of fellow poker players, while recognizing that chess is a game of complete information, in contrast to poker.
Schwartz's mother was diagnosed with cancer, and he spent much of his time in his twenties caring for her and taking her to doctor appointments until her death in 2003. Ylon Schwartz's father, Neil, had left the family when Ylon was two years old. Neil made a number of attempts to contact Ylon over the years but it never worked out. The last time Ylon heard from his father was in the making the 2008 WSOP final table and Ylon refused to speak to him. His father remarried and now lives in New Mexico. Prior to Schwartz making it to the main table at the 2008 World Series of Poker, his biggest WSOP win was three years earlier at the 2005 World Poker Finals in the No-Limit Hold'em $500 buy-in event, in which his third place finish brought him a payout of $49,960. On November 10, 2008, Schwartz was eliminated after going all in against Peter Eastgate and finishing the tournament in fourth place, earning $3,774,974. 
On June 16, 2012 at the 43rd annual World Series of Poker Schwartz won his first bracelet in the $1,500 H.O.R.S.E. event for $267,081.
, his total lifetime live poker tournament winnings exceed $4,600,000. His 24 cashes at the WSOP have netted him $4,431,689 in earnings.
He currently resides in Austin, Texas.

Raphignathoidea

The Raphignathoidea is a superfamily of the Acari (mite) Order Trombidiformes. It contains many predators of small invertebrates, while some are herbivores and others parasites.
The predatory Raphignathoidea are of some commercial importance, as many are suitable for biological pest control. They are bred and released to control such plant pests as gall mites (Eriophyidae), spider mites (Tetranychidae) or scale insects (Coccoidea) in agriculture and forestry.
This is a diverse and widespread group of mites. With about 62 genera and some 877 species, Raphignathoidea mites are abundant on most continents, including a few that have colonized Antarctica. The lineage dates back at least to the Paleocene–Eocene boundary, about 56 million years ago.

Public High School League of the Metropolitan District

The Public High School League of the Metropolitan District, or simply "Metropolitan League," as this conference was informally called, was something of a poor cousin to the New York Interscholastic Athletic Association and the Long Island Interscholastic Athletic League. New York City was much slower than Brooklyn in establishing public high schools, and it was not until the school year of 1896-1897 that the schools of Manhattan Boys (later renamed De Witt Clinton) and Bronx Mixed (later named Cooper, then Morris) were opened. 
The league was formed in the spring of 1899, after four public schools sought admittance into the all-private Interscholastic League and were rejected. Undoubtedly the members of the Interscholastic League wanted to keep their organization an all-private school one, but there was probably more than a hint of class bias involved as well. The four schools—Manhattan Boys, Bronx Mixed, Jersey City High, and Brooklyn Manual Training—inaugurated the league with a track and field meet and a baseball series. Football, indoor track, handball, and basketball were added to the schedule in subsequent years. In 1900, Commercial High and Flushing High joined the league.
The "New York Times", which kept its focus on the private schools in Manhattan, barely gave any coverage to activities of the Metropolitan League. With the formation of the Public Schools Athletic League (PSAL) in 1903 , the league continued as a football organization until 1906, as the PSAL did not initially sponsor football competition. 
The formation of the PSAL supposedly had its genesis in the shabby nature of the high school leagues that preceded it, but the Metropolitan League represented a bit of reformation in high school sports in the New York area, in that it was the first local league that was under faculty control, at least in theory.

Çetin Özek

Çetin Özek (1934 Çorum, Turkey – 16 July 2008 Istanbul) was a prominent Turkish university professor of criminal law, jurist, author and journalist. 
Çetin Özek graduated from Istanbul's respected Pertevniyal High School in 1952 and from Istanbul University Law School in 1956. He was an instructor in criminal law at the same university for five years before receiving his doctorate in 1961, with a thesis titled about secularism in Turkey, a subject on which he was going to be known to feel strongly during his entire life. 
Between 1962 and 1964, he attended the "Scuola di Perfezionamento di Diritto Penale" at the University of Rome through an Italian state scholarship. Back to Istanbul University, he became a lecturer in 1968, and spent 1969 to 1970 in England for further studies. 
Current politics became a decisive factor in his career when he was dismissed from Istanbul University's academic staff following the 1971 "Coup by Memorandum" in Turkey. He could later annul the dismissal through a decision of the Turkish Council of State () and, once back to university, he became a professor in 1978. 
In 1983, in conflict with Turkey's newly founded "Council of Higher Education" (YÖK), Özek demissioned from his position at the university, and pursued a career focused on journalism and on legal counselling. He worked for the newspapers "Hürriyet", "Milliyet" and "Günaydın", both as columnist and as consultant. He returned to the university to demission again in 1999, this time in conflict with the rector. In the meantime, he pursued his primary profession of lawyer, in the frame of which he sometimes assumed cases, which acquired notoriety and had repercussions. He was also deeply involved in politics, making a name as a staunch supporter of Republican values and a strong critic of rising Islamist or Islamic-tainted movements. 
Özek retired from his university career in 2002, although he remained active as a writer. In addition to a dozen books he wrote on matters such as criminal law, freedom of the press and secularism, a festschrift to his honor was published by prominent jurists from Galatasaray University in 2004.
Çetin Özek died on 16 July 2008 at the age of 74 in Istanbul after a long lasting illness. Following a religious funeral at Teşvikiye Mosque, he was laid to rest at the Kozlu Cemetery. He is survived by his daughter Ayşe Özek Karasu, manager of foreign news at "Hürriyet".

Standard Macedonian

Standard Macedonian or Literary Macedonian ( or Македонски литературен јазик) is the standard variety of the Macedonian language and official language of the Republic of Macedonia used as a written language, in formal contexts, and for communication between different dialect areas. Several prestige dialects have developed around the major urban centers of Skopje, Bitola, Kumanovo and Prilep.
It was only in the 1940s, however, that the Macedonian language was able to be implemented, after being formally declared the official language of the Socialist Republic of Macedonia. The rapid pace at which the standardization process took place was in part owing to an already existing interdialect (see Spoken Macedonian). The standard language is phonologically and morphologically based on the central Western Macedonian dialects (in particular, the Prilep-Bitola and Skopje-Veles dialect) with its lexicon influenced by all Macedonian dialects.
Educated speakers will usually use, or aim to use, the formal standard in public settings and in most forms of written language. Probably the best exemplars of this type of speech, though not always the case, are actors, teachers and writers. A high degree of social prestige and respect is assigned to those who correctly use the standard language in the appropriate situations. In extremely rare examples, some speakers will use the formal code exclusively in everyday conversational speech.
While acquisition of the formal code constitutes a significant part of elementary education, during which children are taught the relationship between their local dialect and the target code, the formal literary language. Most educated speakers switch to the colloquial register of the standard language, Spoken Macedonian, when communicating in less formal circumstances, but tend to aim for more formal usage in circumstances where educated speakers are present or as a sort of "interdialect" in the case where the company is not exclusively local.

Xscape (group)

Xscape was a successful female American R&B quartet which began as a quintet. The group had 6 top 10 hit songs on the Billboard Hot 100 during the 1990s including "Just Kicking it", "Understanding," "Who Can I Run To", "Keep On, Keepin' On", "The Arms of the One Who Loves You", and "My Little Secret". The original lineup of the group consisted of sisters LaTocha and Tamika Scott, Kandi Burruss, Tameka "Tiny" Cottle, and Tamera Coggins, though Coggins departed the group before their debut album was released.
Background.
LaTocha and Tamika Scott's father, Rev. Randolf Scott, was part of the R&B group Scott Three during the early '70s. The sisters were trained to sing by their father at an early age. They sang in church and competed in talent shows around the area while growing up. In the early '90s, they met Xscape's other three members, Kandi Burruss, Tamera Coggins, and Tameka "Tiny" Cottle-Harris at the magnet performing arts high school, Tri-Cities, in East Point, Georgia, a city outside of Atlanta. Cottle's father, Charles Pope, and her uncle, Joseph Pope (1933–1996), were members of the R&B group, The Tams.
"Hummin' Comin' at 'Cha" (1992-1994).
After Coggins left the group in 1991, Xscape became a quartet. They were later discovered by Jermaine Dupri while singing at an annual Martin Luther King, Jr. festival in Atlanta. Dupri immediately signed the group to his up and coming So So Def label. He debuted the quartet at his birthday party in 1991. The group released their debut album, "Hummin' Comin' at 'Cha", on October 12, 1993. The album peaked at number seventeen the U.S. "Billboard" 200 and number three on the Top R&B Albums chart. It was a critical and commercial success, certified platinum within a year, and launched two top 10 singles. The debut single, "Just Kickin' It", and second single, "Understanding", both entered the top 10 of the official Hot 100 and became platinum and gold certified number-one hits on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The follow-up singles, "Love on My Mind" and "Tonight", did not achieve the same success.
In 1994 the group appeared on an episode of "Beverly Hills 90210" where they appeared at a benefit booked by Steve Sanders. The group later appeared on "The Mask" soundtrack.
At the conclusion of "Hummin' Comin' at 'Cha", the group appeared on "Freedom (Theme from Panther)" for the movie of the same name, and the film's soundtrack in 1995.
"Off the Hook" (1995-1998).
After much success, Xscape released their second studio album, "Off the Hook", in 1995. The lead single, "Feels So Good", reached the top 140 of the US Hot 100, while "Who Can I Run To" peaked at #8. The follow-up singles, "Do You Want To" and "Can't Hang", the latter featuring rapper MC Lyte, were released as a double A-side single. It went only as high as number 50 on the Hot 100, but peaked at #9 on the "Hot R&B/Hip Hop" charts. The album eventually went platinum.
In 1996, the group was featured on MC Lyte's single "Keep On, Keepin' On", which appeared on the "Sunset Park" soundtrack. The single reached the top 10 on the Hot 100 and #3 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs charts.
In 1997, the group's popularity was growing and their songs appeared on the soundtracks to the films "Love Jones" and "Soul Food".
"Traces of My Lipstick" (1998-2001).
In early 1998, Xscape was featured on the Keith Sweat produced single, a cover of Atlantic Starr's "Am I Dreamin'", by R&B new-comer group Ol' Skool. The single was a success in North America, peaking at #31 on the "Hot 100", and was later featured on Xscape's third album "Traces of My Lipstick".
"Traces of My Lipstick" debuted at #28 on the Billboard 200 and at #6 on the Hot R&B/Hip Hop album chart; over a million copies were sold in the U.S. The album featured the top 10 hit "The Arms of the One Who Loves You", which reached #7 on the Hot 100 chart, and "My Little Secret", which reached #9. Although there no official third single was released, "Softest Place on Earth" reached #28 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.
After "Traces of My Lipstick", Latocha Scott initially left the group to pursue a solo career. The ladies soon regrouped and made appearances on the "Big Momma's House" and "Hardball" soundtracks before going on another hiatus.
"Unchained" (2005-present).
After a five-year hiatus, sisters "LaTocha Scott" and "Tamika Scott" reunited with Tameka "Tiny" Cottle and new member Kiesha Miles to record a fourth album, "Unchained". The new single, "What's Up", was released on a mixtape and later got some airplay in hometown Atlanta. However, the album was not released due to lack of promotion from the record label.

1984–85 Huddersfield Town F.C. season

Huddersfield Town's 1984-85 campaign was a mediocre season for the Terriers, with the team finishing in 13th place, never looking likely to be promoted or relegated.
Review.
Town didn't have the best start in their second season back in Division 2. By mid-October, Town were second bottom, following only winning one of their first 9 league games. But, a stunning turn in form saw Town go on a run of 9 games unbeaten, of which 8 of those were wins, helped by goals from Mark Lillis and Dale Tempest. That run saw Town climb to 9th in early December.
Following that run, Town lost 5 of the next 7, winning the other 2, but then a run of 9 games unbeaten seemed to try to force Town into a late promotion surge, but this was quickly ended by a dreadful late season run, which saw Town lose 6 of their last 8 games, finishing in a mediocre 13th place.

The Unwilling Warlord

The Unwilling Warlord is a fantasy novel by Lawrence Watt-Evans. It details the story of hereditary warlord Sterren of Semma taking over, unwillingly, the position of warlord for one of Ethshar's Small Kingdoms.
Plot introduction.
The Kingdom of Semma is on the verge of war but the VIII Hereditary Warlord has died. The King sent out a search party to the Hegemony of Ethshar where with the aid of magic they track down the heir to the title, the Unwilling IX Warlord Sterren.
The story evolves as Sterren, along with assorted others hired to help in the war, is hauled off from his career as a low stakes gambler to Semma. One of his companions is Vond, a master Warlock who is feeling the Calling and who is seeking to get as far away from Aldagmor as he can because once a Warlock gives in to the Calling they are drawn to Aldagmor and are never seen again. Vond takes a liking to Sterren who was actually apprenticed as a Warlock for three days before being dismissed as unable to perform. Of course it is against the Guild law for any magician to practice in more than one field so Sterren was disqualified to take up any of the other studies. Not long after arriving in Semma, Vond discovers a second source of power for Warlockry and quickly becomes the most powerful magician in the Small Kingdoms.

Katie Reider

Kathryn Ann "Katie" Reider (23 May 1978 – 14 July 2008) was an American singer-songwriter from Cincinnati, Ohio. Reider described her own music as "Folk/pop/rock fused together into some sort of 'genre-less' category." Reider released four albums, won five Cincinnati music awards and had her songs featured on television programming by ABC, Lifetime, and on the WB's "Dawson's Creek" before health problems emerged in 2006 that ultimately led to her death two years later. Shortly after her death, the "New York Times" stated that Reider was "a singer-songwriter with a huge following back home and a growing national fan base, who seemed on the cusp of much larger success when her life was destroyed by a rare tumor that ate into her jaw and face, stole her voice, left her blind in one eye and finally killed her (in July 2008) at the age of 30."
Biography.
Early life.
Reider was born in Cincinnati, Ohio on 23 May 1978 to Gaile and Rob Reider and grew up as one of six children in nearby Montgomery. Reider grew up surrounded by music. Rob Reider was a singer and band leader on the syndicated entertainment program "The Bob Braun Show" during the 1970s and early '80s. Reider's parents gave her first guitar when she was in fifth grade. It was a red Gibson Epiphone. Reider's parents were supportive of her interest in music. Reider would later recall, "I started out singing in front of my family in front of the fireplace. I would take out a poker from next to the fireplace and use it as a microphone."
1990s.
Reider began performing her own songs publicly in the early 1990s while still a high school student at Cincinnati Hills Christian Academy. She started singing in local coffeehouses and later at the Crossroads Community Church in Oakley. Janet Pressley saw Reider perform at the Blue Jordan Coffeehouse in Cincinnati's Northside in 1993. Pressley recalled, "She had the pipes back then."
In the summer of 1995, just before her senior year of high school, Reider met Karen Boone and Dan Stroeh while in a Christian theater group. Over the course of several years Reider and Boone became lovers and partners. Stroeh presided over a backyard wedding and Boone took Reider's last name. They remained a couple until Reider's death. Karen gave birth to two children, whom they parented together.
Reider lived in Columbus, Ohio throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s while majoring in family studies at the Ohio State University, but she did not frequently perform there. She primarily returned to Cincinnati to perform gigs during her early career.
Reider joined the artist cooperative label co-founded by Janet Pressley, Blue Jordan Records, and released her first album, "Wonder," in late 1998. According to Reider, the title contained a double meaning: "I wonder about a lot of things, and then I wonder about it all and how wonderful it is." The album was described in the "Cincinnati Post" as "an incredibly mature project - both musically and lyrically - for someone so young. Her songs mainly deal with the aches of lost and found love, but in a way that is far more seasoned than the angst-filled, angry lyrics of such artists as Alanis Morissette."
Locally, the album was a major success, and Reider won more awards than any other performer at the 1999 Cincinnati Area Pop Music Awards (known in Cincinnati as "Cammy Awards"). She gained recognition as Best Folk/Bluegrass Vocalist, Best New Artist, and Songwriter of the Year.
2000s.
In October 2000, two songs from Reider's debut album, "What You Don't Know" and "Piece of Soul," were featured on episodes of the WB show, "Dawson's Creek". "What You Don't Know" was played for three minutes on the show. Reider said she experienced being "outside of herself" for a moment: "I had some friends over and we watched it. I'm telling the truth when I say I never watched "Dawson's Creek" before that. It was surreal and overwhelming how cool it was." She told the "Cincinnati Post" that traffic on her website increased by 1,200 hits the next day.
In December 2000, Reider released the live album, "No Retakes". The album featured the same musicians that appeared on her first studio album, Dave Eberhardt (electric guitar), Greg Hansen (bass), Josh Seurkamp (drums) and Reider's brother Robbie on guitar. Reider's father, Rob, helped engineer the project and suggested the title. The tracks feature a mix of new songs and songs that appeared on "Wonder". The recordings were from performances at the York Street Cafe and the Aronoff Center. According to the "Cincinnati Post": "Throughout the set we hear how Ms. Reider's voice is growing more powerful and sensual as her band soars on her deliciously subtle hooks and melodies."
Reider released her second studio album in December 2001, "I Am Ready." Just a couple weeks later, the "Cincinnati Post" named it one of the top ten local albums of the year, calling it "more musically diverse, showing mature song crafting and confident, gutty vocals way beyond her 23 years."
Reider was again nominated for best folk/bluegrass vocalist at the Cammy Awards in 2002 and 2003. At the time, she regularly played gigs at the York Street Cafe in Newport, Kentucky, the Barrel House in Cincinnati and at Club 202 in Columbus.
Reider's music continued to gain exposure from television programs. On Dec. 8, 2002, her recording of "Silent Night" from "No Retakes" aired on an episode of the Lifetime series "Strong Medicine". Less than a month later, the WB launched a Web site that allowed fans of "Dawson's Creek" to order a custom compilation CD containing their favorite songs from the show. The promotion featured the 80 most requested songs from the approximately 700 songs that were featured in the series during its six-year run. Both of Reider's songs were included. Reider's music also entered into rotation on Sirius Satellite Radio Channel No. 30 (The Coffee House).
Reider died on July 14, 2008 from a cerebral hemorrhage.
In addition to her music, Reider was known for her activism. Reider spoke out about gay rights issues and was a performer at gay pride celebrations.

Michael Thompson (golfer)

Michael Hayes Thompson (born April 16, 1985) is an American professional golfer who plays on the PGA Tour.
Amateur career.
Thompson attended University High School in Tucson, Arizona from 1999 to 2003. While there he won the Class 4A state team championship in 2003, and was named the Arizona High School State Player of the Year in 2002 and 2003. Thompson attended Tulane University two seasons until they disbanded their golf team after Hurricane Katrina. Thompson then transferred to the University of Alabama. While playing on Alabama's golf team, Thompson was the 2008 SEC Player of the Year.
Thompson was a finalist in the 2007 U.S. Amateur, but was defeated by Colt Knost 2 & 1. This earned him invitations to the 2008 Masters Tournament and the 2008 U.S. Open. He missed the cut in the Masters but was the low amateur at the U.S. Open at Torrey Pines. He scored a nine-over-par 292 to finish in 28th place. The following week he was invited to play in the Travelers Championship, where he made the cut and shot a three-under-par 277 to finish tied for 58th.
Professional career.
Thompson spent one week as number one in the World Amateur Golf Ranking before turning professional in July 2008. In 2010 Thompson played on the Hooters Tour, and was named the 2010 Hooters Tour Player of the Year. In the 2010 PGA Tour Q-School, Thompson finished tied for 16th, which earned him a 2011 PGA Tour card. 
After earning his spot through sectional qualifying, Thompson led after the first round of the 2012 U.S. Open after shooting a four-under par round of 66, which included seven birdies, to lead by three strokes. This was the low round of the week. He followed this up with rounds of 75-74 to enter the final round six back of the leaders. Thompson then completed a three-under par round of 67 to hold the clubhouse lead at +2, until Webb Simpson bettered it by a stroke. Thompson finished tied for second with Graeme McDowell to record his best finish in a major championship. Thompson moved up over 50 places in the Official World Golf Ranking (OWGR) to 52nd with this finish.
After a number of players withdrew due to injury or personal reasons, Thompson earned entry into the 2012 Open Championship as an alternate due to his OWGR ranking. He went on to miss the cut.
Thompson earned his first PGA Tour win at the 2013 Honda Classic. The win moved Thompson to a career-high 45th in the OWGR, up from 114th before the tournament.
Personal life.
Thompson attained the rank of Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America while in high school. He is married to Rachel Thompson, who is a Doctor of Physical Therapy, and an Emory University graduate. She caddied for Thompson during his only win on the regular Hooters Tour. The two met while attending Tulane University together.

A traumatic diaphragmatic hernia is a type of diaphragmatic hernia which is acquired through an abdominal injury. This is in contrast to a congenital diaphragmatic hernia, which is present from birth.
It can occur after splenectomy.
Because it can be indicative of severe trauma, it often co-presents with pelvic fracture.

Virgin Islands American

Virgin Islands Americans are Americans from the U.S. Virgin Islands or British Virgin Islands who reside in the continental United States, or continental Americans of Virgin Islands heritage.
Persons born in the U.S. Virgin Islands are United States citizens, and as a result do not go through the legal immigration procedures a typical West Indies immigrant would. However, due to cultural affinities with the Anglophone Caribbean, U.S. Virgin Islanders in the U.S. are considered part of the Caribbean American immigrant community.
It is difficult to determine how many Virgin Islanders reside in the United States. According to the 2000 U.S. Census, there are 15,014 of U.S. Virgin Islands ancestry residing in the continental United States. However, a count of American residents with "U.S. Virgin Islands ancestry" excludes most U.S. Virgin Islands-born immigrants in the United States. Because of a high incidence of inter-Caribbean migration throughout the 1960s and 1970s, most native-born U.S. Virgin Islanders today are one or two generations removed from other Caribbean islands and would not necessarily define themselves as having "U.S. Virgin Islands ancestry." For example, Tim Duncan is a St. Croix native with Anguillian ancestry.
The population of immigrants of British Virgin Islands origin in the United States is also difficult to determine, as they are not specifically counted in the U.S. Census, but grouped with other Caribbean British Overseas Territories as "British West Indies."

<doc id="18491862" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18491862" title="Legislative Council of Ceylon">
Legislative Council of Ceylon

The Legislative Council of Ceylon was the legislative body of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) established in 1833, along with the Executive Council of Ceylon, on the recommendations of the Colebrooke-Cameron Commission. It was the first form of representative government in the island. The 1931 Donoughmore Constitution replaced the Legislative Council with the State Council of Ceylon.
History.
Introduction.
In 1833 the Colebrooke-Cameron Commission created the Legislative Council of Ceylon, the first step in representative government in British Ceylon. Initially the Legislative Council consisted of 16 members: the British Governor, the five appointed members of the Executive Council of Ceylon (the Colonial Secretary, the Attorney General, the Auditor-General, the Treasurer and the General Officer Commanding), four other government officials (including the Government Agents of the Western and Central provinces) and six appointed unofficial members (three Europeans, one Sinhalese, one Tamil and one Burgher). The unofficial members had no right to initiate legislation; they could only contribute to discussion. This was the first step towards giving the people of the country a voice in its administration. However, in 1860 the member of the Legislative Council were given the right to introduce legislation which did not deal with the financial matters.
In 1889 the number of appointed unofficial members was increased to eight (three Europeans, one Low Country Sinhalese, one Kandyan Sinhalese, one Tamil, one Muslim and one Burgher).
McCallum Reforms.
The Legislative Council was reformed in 1910 by the "McCallum Reforms". Membership was increased from 18 to 21, of which 11 were official and 10 were unofficial. Of the non-official members, six were appointed by the governor (two Low Country Sinhalese, two Tamils, one Kandyan Sinhalese and one Muslim) and remaining four were elected (two Europeans, one Burgher and one educated Ceylonese).
The most notable aspect of the "McCallum Reforms" was the introduction of elected members. However, fewer than 3,000 people (4%) could vote, as the right to vote was based on education and assets held. One of the four elected non-official members was Ponnambalam Ramanathan. The financial committee was also established to control the revenue. It included the Colonial Secretary, Colonial Treasurer, Revenue Controller and all the non-official elected members. These changes did not satisfy the Ceylonese, and the movement for constitutional reforms grew.
First Manning Reforms.
Further reforms were enacted in 1920 by the "First Manning Reforms". Membership was increased from 21 to 37, of which 14 were official and 23 were unofficial. Of the non-official members, four were appointed by the governor (two Kandyan Sinhalese, one Muslim and one Indian Tamil) and the remaining 19 were elected (11 on a territorial basis, five Europeans, two Burghers and one Chamber of Commerce).
A notable change was the introduction of territorial constituencies. Of the 11 territorial constituencies, three were from the Western Province and one each from the other eight provinces. Three non-official members were elected to the Executive Council. Yet again the Ceylonese were not satisfied and requested more change.
Second Manning Reforms.
The "Second Manning Reforms" of 1923 increased membership from 37 to 49, of which 12 were official and 37 were unofficial. Of the non-official members, eight were appointed by the governor (three Muslim, two Indian Tamils and three others) and the remaining 29 were elected (23 on a territorial basis, three Europeans, two Burghers, one Ceylon Tamil for the Western Province). The 23 territorial constituencies were distributed as follows:
The head of the Legislative Council had been the Governor, but the new reforms created the post of President of the Legislative Council, which was held by a Governor on a nominal basis, and a selected member was appointed to the post of Vice President of the Legislative Council, who was James Peiris. However, the Governor still retained most of the authority in the country. Four non-official members were selected to be part of the Executive Council.
Replacement.
Due to the shortcomings of the "Second Manning Reforms" the Donoughmore Commission was sent to Ceylon. The Commission gained its name from the royal commission under the Earl of Donoughmore that came to Ceylon in 1927. Its recommendations led to Ceylon gaining limited self-government and the replacement of the Legislative Council with the State Council of Ceylon in 1931.

Colm Doran

Colm Doran (born 1949 in Boolavogue, County Wexford) is a retired Irish sportsperson. He played hurling with his local club Buffer's Alley and with the Wexford senior inter-county team from 1969 until 1982. Doran is regarded as one of the greatest players never to have won an All-Ireland medal.
Playing career.
Club.
Doran played his club hurling with the famous Buffer's Alley club in Wexford and enjoyed much success. He won his first senior county title in 1968, the first time that the club had been victorious in the county final. Doran added a second county medal to his collection in 1970 before capturing back-to-back county titles in 1975 and 1976. It would be 1982 before he won his next county title, his fifth in total. This victory began a fantastic run of success for Buffer’s Alley who won four county champions in-a-row. The last of these county victories was later converted into a Leinster club title following a victory over Kinnitty. Doran later lined out in the All-Ireland club final, however, Buffer’s Alley were defeated by Kilruane MacDonagh's of Tipperary on that occasion. Doran retired from club hurling shortly afterwards.
Inter-county.
Doran first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Wexford under-21 team in the late 1960s. He won a Leinster title in this grade in 1969 before later lining out in his first All-Ireland final. Cork provided the opposition on that occasion and won the game by 5-13 to 4-7. Doran added a second Leinster under-21 title to his collection in 1970 before later playing in his second consecutive All-Ireland final. Once again Cork provided the opposition, however, the game ended in a draw. The replay proved more conclusive as ‘the Rebels’ trounced Doran’s side by 5-17 to 0-8.
Doran subsequently joined the Wexford senior team where his brother, Tony Doran, was already a star on the forward line. He played in his first Leinster final in 1971. The Kilkenny team of the 1970s, a team often described as the greatest of all-time, provided the opposition on that occasion. In fact, it was the first of five successive defeats at the hands of Kilkenny in Leinster finals for Wexford; however, Doran missed the 1972 decider.
In spite of a lack of success in the championship Wexford reached the final of the National Hurling League in 1973. On that occasion Limerick were the opponents, however, victory went to Wexford giving Doran his first major title at senior level.
1976 saw Wexford and Kilkenny battle it out in the Leinster final for the seventh year in succession. ‘The Cats’ were going for a provincial six in-a-row and an All-Ireland three-in-a-row, however, Wexford shocked the reigning champions by 2-20 to 1-6. It was a trouncing that nobody expected and it gave Doran his first Leinster medal. Wexford’s championship campaign nearly came unstuck in their next game against Galway. A high-scoring game ended in a 5-14 to 2-23 draw and a replay was forced. The second game was just as tense an affair, however, Wexford emerged victorious by 3-14 to 2-14. Their opponents in the All-Ireland final were Cork, a team looking for their first championship title since 1970. Doran’s side got off to a great start and led by 2-2 to no score after just six minutes, however, Cork settled down and were spurred on with an inspirational display by Pat Moylan. The sides were level at the interval; however, the second-half developed into what was arguably the finest final of the decade. Cork hung on to win by 2-21 to 4-11 as Doran was left on the losing side.
In 1977 Wexford maintained their provincial dominance with another defeat of Kilkenny. It was Doran’s second Leinster medal and the defeat for ‘the Cats’ brought the curtain down on Eddie Keher’s inter-county career. Victory in the provincial final allowed Wexford to advance directly to the All-Ireland final. For the second year in-a-row Cork provided the opposition and another classic looked likely. Wet and windy weather severely hampered both teams, however, the game was still a close affair. For the second year in-a-row Doran ended up on the losing side as Cork claimed a 1-17 to 3-8 victory.
In 1978 Kilkenny were back as champions of Leinster and Wexford had to go back to the drawing board. A new force in the province also emerged as Offaly won their first Leinster titles in 1980 and 1981. Doran retired from inter-county hurling shortly afterwards.
Provincial.
Doran also lined out with Leinster in the inter-provincial hurling competition. He first played for his province in 1974 as Leinster defeated Munster to take the Railway Cup. Doran added further Railway Cup medals to his collection in 1975, 1977 and 1979.
Post-playing career.
Not long after his playing days were over the Gaelic Athletic Association celebrated its centenary year in 1984. Throughout the year a series of special events were held while special team selections were also named. While a special GAA Hurling Team of the Century was named, a special team of players who never won an All-Ireland medal was also selected. Doran’s brilliance as a player was recognised when he was picked in the left wing-back position on that team.

Erich Wasicky

Erich Wasicky (born May 27, 1911 in Vienna – died May 28, 1947 at Landsberg Prison, Landsberg am Lech, Allied-occupied Germany) was a pharmacist at the Mauthausen concentration camp in charge of gassing victims.
Wasicky was a physician. He joined the NSDAP and was a member of the SS. Between 1941 and 1944, he worked as a pharmacist at Mauthausen concentration camp. It was his duty to select victims to die in the gas chamber. The exact number of his victims is not known, but more than 3,100 died in neighboring Hartheim concentration camp, which fell under Wasicky's jurisdiction. After the Nazis started using the poison Cyclon B, Wasicky was put in charge of establishing this process in both Mauthausen and Hartheim.
After the end of World War II, Wasicky was charged with murder by a U.S. military tribunal. On May 13, 1946, he was found guilty. On May 28, 1947, he was hanged in Landsberg Prison.

Harrison Pennoh

Harrison Pennoh is best known for killing William R. Tolbert, Jr., the president of Liberia on April 12, 1980.
In 1979, hundreds of protesters marched through the streets of Liberia's capital, Monrovia, demonstrating against the sharp rise in the price of rice. Tolbert ordered his troops to fire on the demonstrators, and some seventy people were killed. Despite efforts to restore order, rioting ensued throughout Liberia, and attempts to quash the opposition by arresting its leaders failed. On April 12, 1980, Tolbert was overthrown by military mutineers in a coup d'état where the 66-year old President was savagely murdered by private soldier Harrison Pennoh, who later proved mentally unstable. Before the end of the month Tolbert's entire Cabinet had been put on trial and sentenced to death - with no right to be defended by a lawyer and no right to appeal to the verdict. In a horrific scene they were all but one publicly executed on a beach near Monrovia. The only cabinet member who escaped from being shot was the only minister of tribal origin, raised in an Americo-Liberian family that was part of the Tolbert-clan.

Prutah (Hebrew: פרוטה) is a word borrowed from the Mishnah and the Talmud, in which it means "a coin of smaller value". The word was probably derived originally from an Aramaic word with the same meaning. 
The prutah was an ancient copper Jewish coin worth about one thousandth of a pound. A loaf of bread at that time was worth about 10 prutot (plural of prutah). One prutah was also worth two lepta (singular lepton), which was the smallest denomination minted by the Hasmonean and Herodian Dynasty kings. 
Prutot were also minted by the Roman Procurators of the Province of Judea, and later were minted by the Jews during the First Jewish Revolt (sometimes called 'Masada coins').

Degania Bet () is a kvutza or kibbutz in northern Israel. Located to the south of the Sea of Galilee adjacent to Degania Alef, it falls under the jurisdiction of Emek HaYarden Regional Council. In 2008 it had a population of 514.
The village was founded in 1920 by immigrants from the Second Aliyah, led by Levi Brevda (Levi Ben Amitai). It was the first planned kibbutz and was designed and built by the architect Korenberg. One of its founders was Levi Eshkol. During the 1920 Palestine riots it was attacked and abandoned for several months. 
During the 1936-39 Arab revolt it served as a base for establishing tower and stockade settlements. During the Battles of the Kinarot Valley in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War the residents of Degania Alef and Bet succeeded in halting the advance of the Syrian army into the Jordan Valley.
In addition to its 350 cow dairy herd, crop fields, almond orchards, banana, date and avocado plantations, Degania Bet industrialized in the 1960s with Degania Sprayers, now a green industry; in 1984 it opened the Degania Silicone factory. An additional source of income is its kibbutz cottage tourist accommodation, and it specializes in organized bicycle tours.
Notable residents include Michael Kolganov, a bronze medalist in rowing at the 2000 Summer Olympics.

Plan 9 from Outer Space

Plan 9 from Outer Space (originally titled Grave Robbers from Outer Space, or simply known as Plan 9) is a 1959 American science fiction thriller film written and directed by Ed Wood and released by Distributors Corporation of America (as Valiant Pictures). The film stars Gregory Walcott, Mona McKinnon, Tor Johnson and Maila "Vampira" Nurmi. The film bills Bela Lugosi posthumously as a star, although silent footage of the actor had been shot by Wood for other, unfinished projects just before Lugosi's death in 1956.
The plot of the film involves extraterrestrial beings who are seeking to stop humans from creating a doomsday weapon that would destroy the universe. In the course of doing so, the aliens implement "Plan 9", a scheme to resurrect Earth's dead as what modern audiences would consider zombies (called "ghouls" in the film itself) to get the planet's attention, causing chaos.
For years the film played on television in relative obscurity, until 1980, when authors Michael Medved and Harry Medved dubbed "Plan 9 from Outer Space" the "worst movie ever made". Wood was posthumously awarded the Medveds' Golden Turkey Award as the worst director ever.
Background and genre.
The film combines elements of science fiction films and Gothic fiction. Science fiction remained popular throughout the 1950s, though the genre had experienced significant changes in the post-war period. The Atomic Age, heralded by the development of nuclear weapons and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, had inspired science fiction films which were dealing with the dangers of unrestricted science while spaceflight and the existence of extraterrestrial life and civilizations, more "traditional" elements of the genre, seemed to hold new fascination for audiences experiencing the start of the Space Race. On the other hand, gothic fiction had enjoyed the height of its popularity in film during the 1930s and 1940s. It was experiencing a decline in the 1950s and was seen as old-fashioned. The combination of dated and modern elements, by 1950s standards, gives the film a rather anachronistic quality. 
The script of the film seems to aim at making this an epic film, a "genre" which typically requires a big budget provided by a major film studio. That Ed Wood filmed the story with minimal financial resources underlines one of the qualities of his work, his ideas tended be too expensive to actually put to film and yet the director would constantly go ahead and try. An overreach which, as Rob Craig argues, results in the peculiar charm of the film to audiences. Craig finds that the film has much in common with both epic theatre ("grand melodrama on a minuscule budget") and the Theatre of the Absurd (characters acting as buffoons, nonsense and verbosity in dialogue, dream-like and fantasy imagery, hints of allegory, and a narrative structure where continuity is consistently undermined). 
The introduction and its origins.
The film opens with an introduction by Criswell: ""Greetings my friends! We are all interested in the future, For that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives! ..."". Criswell was the star of "Criswell Predicts" on KLAC Channel 13 (now KCOP-13), and the introduction could be an allusion to the opening lines of his show. Since no episodes of the television show are known to survive, a full comparison between them seems impossible. Craig suggests that Criswell' public persona was based on the style of a charismatic preacher, perhaps influenced by early televangelists. Criswell addresses the viewers repeatedly as "my friends", as if attempting to establish a bond between the speaker and the audience. The line is likely to derive from his show, and would not be out of place in a segment where a televangelist addresses his congregation. Another phrase of the introduction ""Future events such as these will affect you in the future"", served as a signature line for Criswell. He used it repeatedly in his newspaper and magazine columns, and probably his show as well. 
Another line ascertains that the audience is interested in ""the unknown, the mysterious, the unexplainable"", probably assuming that the film's audience will have a fascination with the paranormal. The narrator at some point starts claiming that "we" (the filmmakers) are bringing to light the full story and evidence of fateful events, based on the "secret testimony" of the survivors. The lines seem to emulate the style of sensational headlines in newspapers, and promise the audiences access to "lurid secrets" as if following the example of "True Confessions" and other similar magazines. The notion that a film or show could be based on true incidents and testimony would be familiar to a 1950s audience, because it was used in contemporary police procedurals such as "Dragnet".
Changing the tone, the narrator delivers the sermon-like lines: ""Let us punish the guilty! Let us reward the innocent!"". Which again sound as if a preacher addresses his audience. The introduction concludes with the dramatic question: ""Can your heart stand the shocking facts about graverobbers from outer space"". The latter phrase was simply the original title of the film, but the rest of the line seems again to emulate the sensationalist press. 
Government conspiracy.
Through Paul Trent's initial conversation with his wife, the film introduces the notion of a government and military conspiracy to cover up information on documented UFO sightings. This notion was clearly influenced by the emergence and increased popularity of a UFO conspiracy theory. The implications concerning the public's distrust of the government were atypical for a 1950s American film. Anti-statist ideas would become more popular in the 1960s, which is when the subject became "safe" for mainstream cinema.
Message from the Aliens.
The film contains a cautionary message from the aliens. The earliest use of this concept in film was probably in "The Day the Earth Stood Still" (1951), and it had since seen frequent use in science fiction films. The idea was that the self-destructive behaviour of humanity was the real threat, not any external source of danger. 
Plot.
Following the introduction, the narrative begins with a funeral in San Fernando Valley. A small group of mourners are gathered by an open grave, chief among them being an unnamed old man (Bela Lugosi). The narrator explains that this is the funeral of the old man's wife. Two gravediggers stand nearby, waiting for the funeral to end and for their work in closing the grave to begin. The scene shifts from the graveyard to a Douglas DC-7 which is flying over the Valley, heading towards Burbank, California. The narrative introduces a pilot named Jeff Trent and his co-pilot Danny. Their seemingly routine flight takes a strange turn, when they are affected by a blinding light and accompanying loud sound. They look outside their plane and encounter a flying saucer. The stewardess Edie joins them in the cockpit and also sees the saucer. The camera leaves the plane and follows the saucer in its flight, until it lands at the graveyard. The gravediggers hear a strange noise and are spooked. They decide to leave the graveyard, but are attacked and killed by the resurrected corpse of the young woman. The scene fades out with the Vampire Girl, as she is called in the credits, moving towards them and the men screaming. The deaths are implied but remain unseen. 
The following scene opens at the modest home of the old man. The old man steps outside and is seen lost in his thoughts of grief. He absent-mindedly steps into the path of an oncoming automobile and dies. At his funeral, mourners discover the corpses of the gravediggers. Inspector Daniel Clay and other police officers come to the cemetery to investigate. Clay distances himself from the others to contact his own search. The narrative shifts briefly to Jeff Trent and his wife Paula, who live near the graveyard. He listens to the sirens and then tells Paula about his flying saucer encounter, stating that the Army has sworn him to secrecy. At this point, a powerful wind knocks everyone in first the Trent residence and then the graveyard to the ground, and a spaceship lands nearby. At the graveyard, the old man rises from his grave. The isolated Clay encounters the Vampire Girl and the reanimated corpse of the old man. His bullets apparently have no effect on either of the two undead and he is killed. The police crew soon discovers his body and one of them delivers one of the best-remembered lines of the film ""Inspector Clay's dead, murdered, and somebody's responsible!"" 
In the weeks that follow, newspaper headlines report other flying saucer sightings. Including reports of them flying over Hollywood Boulevard. The camera depicts a trio of saucers flying over Los Angeles, including over the local headquarters of CBS, NBC, and ABC, the Mocambo (where a neon sign informs viewers that Eartha Kitt is performing), and over a restaurant owned by Larry Finley. The scene shifts from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. and its vicinity, where the military fires missiles against the flying saucers. The narrative introduces the Chief of Saucer Operations, Col. Thomas Edwards. The saucers seem untouched by any of the weapons used against them, but still retreat. Edwards reveals that the government has been covering up the flying saucers, and wonders if the aliens are connected to other disasters on Earth. He mentions that one small town has already been annihilated, hinting at a secret history of previous encounters. 
The aliens return to Space Station 7 for regeneration. Their commander, Eros, informs their ruler that he has attempted, unsuccessfully, to contact the governments of Earth. He says that to force the people of Earth to acknowledge his people's existence, he is implementing Plan 9, which involves resurrecting the recently dead by stimulating their pituitary and pineal glands. The three alien ships return to Earth. Trent is about to leave home for another flight. Concerned for Paula's safety, he urges her to stay with her mother while he's gone, but she insists on staying home. While the film barely examines the married life of the Trents, there is one line of Paula which Craig finds suggestive and worthy of examination. In their parting scene, Paula explains that at nights she finds comfort in her absent husband's pillow:""Sometimes at night, when it does get a little lonely, I reach over and touch it. "" Which underlines the absence of a living sexual partner for her, and her frequent loneliness while married. That night, the corpse of the old man rises from his crypt and sneaks into their house. Joined by the corpse of his wife and the newly resurrected Daniel Clay, he chases Paula through the cemetery. Paula collapses and is found by a passing motorist. All three zombies return to Eros' ship, which lifts off.
At the Pentagon, Gen. Roberts informs Edwards that the government has been receiving messages from the aliens. Roberts plays the last message, which has been translated into English by a recently invented "language computer". In Eros' voice it explains that the aliens are trying to prevent humanity from destroying the universe. The general sends Edwards to San Fernando, California, where most of the aliens' activities have occurred. The next scene covers the introduction of the Ruler to one of the undead under alien command. The undead Clay attacks Eros and nearly kills him. The Ruler closer examines Clay and decides to sacrifice one of the undead, the old man, to further scare humanity. He has further plans of raising undead armies and marching them against the capitals of Earth. 
In California, the police and Edwards interview the Trents about their experiences with the aliens. Unbeknownst to them, the alien saucer has returned to the graveyard. While waiting by the police car, Officer Kelton encounters the old man. The old man chases the officer to the Trents' yard, where they shoot him, with no effect. The nearby aliens strike the old man with a ray, causing his body to decompose, leaving only his skeleton. Not knowing what to make of this, the Trents, Edwards, and the police decide to drive to the cemetery. 
Eros allows Trent and the police to enter, and they board with guns drawn. Eros tells them that human weapons development will inevitably lead to the discovery of solarbonite, a substance that has the effect of exploding "sunlight molecules". A solarbonite explosion would set off a chain reaction that would destroy the entire universe. Eros believes humans are too immature to use this power, and intends to destroy mankind to prevent this. Outside the ship, Clay arrives with Paula. Eros threatens to have her killed if they try to force him to go with them. Officers Kelton and Larry arrive and spot Clay with Paula. Realizing their guns are useless, they approach Clay from behind with a stick. Eros sees this and shuts off the ray controlling Clay, allowing Paula to go free. A fight ensues between Eros and Jeff, during which the ship's delicate equipment is damaged, setting off a fire. The humans flee the ship, and Tanna flies it into the atmosphere. The flaming ship explodes, killing both aliens. As a consequence of the explosion, Clay and the female zombie are decomposed in the same manner as the old man. 
"Bela Lugosi's Last Movie".
Shortly before Bela Lugosi's death in August 1956, he had been working with Wood on numerous half-realized projects, variously titled "Tomb of the Vampire" or "The Ghoul Goes West". Scenes unconnected to "Plan 9", featuring Lugosi weeping at a funeral, walking in front of Tor Johnson's house at daytime, walking in and out of Johnson's side door at nighttime, and a daylight scene on a patch of scrubland near a highway showing Lugosi stalking towards the camera and dramatically spreading his Dracula cape before furling it around himself and walking off screen, had been shot. Only the first two sequences had reached any level of completion. When Lugosi died, Wood shelved these projects. It is not certain for which projects the Lugosi footage was intended, and Wood's own account of the affair in his written memoirs seems to suggest that the director had something like "Plan 9" in mind when the material was filmed. This claim stands in apparent contradiction to the "Vampires' Tomb/Ghoul Goes West" theory, backed up by a comment Lugosi made about "Ghoul" being his next project in a filmed interview upon his release from drug rehabilitation.
Shortly after Lugosi's death the story and screenplay for "Grave Robbers from Outer Space" were written and finalised, with Wood planning to use the unconnected, unrelated footage of Lugosi as a means of putting a credit for him on the picture. Though Wood's actions were driven in part by the desire to give his film a 'star name' and attract horror fans, the Lugosi cameo was also meant as a loving tribute and farewell to the actor, who had become fast friends with Wood in the last three years of Lugosi's life. Wood hired his wife's chiropractor, Tom Mason, as a stand-in for Lugosi, even though Mason was taller than Lugosi and bore no resemblance to him, making him one of the earliest "fake Shemps." Narration from Criswell was also employed in an attempt to better link Lugosi's footage with the rest of "Plan 9".
Coincidentally, further Lugosi footage Wood had shot at an unspecified pre-1956 date was to have been the basis of a second posthumous movie for the horror legend, titled "Ghouls Of The Moon". The footage had, however, been shot on volatile nitrate stock, and had dissolved into toxic-smelling sludge by the time Wood's thoughts turned to the new venture in the summer of 1959. "Ghouls Of The Moon" was abandoned entirely as a result. Mystery surrounds the content and nature of the lost material, described only as 'wild' by a friend of Wood's who had seen the raw footage shortly after it was shot.
Production and casting.
The "iconic" flying saucer of the film has been variously identified as a paper plate or a hubcap. According to the documentary "Flying Saucers Over Hollywood- The Plan 9 Companion" (1991) it was actually a recognizable toy. In 1956, toy-manufacturer Paul Lindberg had introduced a plastic toy version of a flying saucer, roughly matching the popular image of the thing at the time: "a silver disc-shaped craft with a clear dome on top". Inside the dome was a little green man. Both a regular version of the toy and a somewhat modified one appear in the film. 
The footage of Los Angeles is used to ground the outworldly events to a realistic setting. As a resident, Wood was probably familiar with the locations depicted. The scene where the military fires at the flying saucers uses stock footage from actual military activities. 
The Reverend Lynn Lemon, who plays an unnamed minister, was one of the Baptists variously involved in the production of the film. J. Edward Reynolds was a leader of the Southern Baptist Convention in Beverly Hills, California, and Hugh Thomas was one of his associates from the church. Both play gravediggers. Reynolds was also the producer of the film. At the time of the film's creation, David De Mering was the personal secretary and alleged lover of fellow cast member Bunny Breckinridge. His inclusion in the cast was probably a result of this association. 
According to Maila Nurmi, she was recruited by Paul Marco to act as a vampire in the film. She was offered 200 dollars for her part. She recalled insisting for her part to be silent, as she did not like the dialogue that Wood had scripted for her. This recollection might be inaccurate since the undead of this film are generally mute. What she contributed to the film was a "regal presence" and theatrical mannerisms. Her performance is reminiscent of a silent film actress. She credited Theda Bara as her main influence. 
The male alien Eros is apparently named after Eros, Greek god of love. Going by theme naming, Craig suggests that the name of the female aliern, Tanna, might invoke the name of another Greek deity: Thanatos, god of death. 
The Pentagon office depicted includes a map of the United States with the sign of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. The same map appears in "Baghdad After Midnight" (1954), which was also filmed in Quality Studios. It was probably used as a standard prop of the Studios.
Release and title changes.
"Grave Robbers from Outer Space" was shot in 1956, and finished the following year, when it had its preview in March at the Carlton Theatre in Los Angeles. Another year elapsed before Distributors Corporation of America (DCA) picked it up and copyrighted it, intending to distribute it during the spring of 1958, but the company folded and it was not released until July 1959 through Valiant Pictures, the receiver of DCA. By then the film had been retitled "Plan 9 From Outer Space". The original title gives the film the feel of a story from a pulp magazine. One story concerning the renaming is that that the film's financiers, two local Baptist ministers, objected to the "Grave Robbers" part of the title. They reportedly considered the direct reference to grave robbery to be sacrilegious in nature, so Wood changed the title to "Plan 9". The original title is mentioned at the end of Criswell's opening narration when he asks the audience, "Can your heart stand the shocking facts about grave robbers from outer space?" The new title is less indicative of the content and might have itself contributed to distribution problems for the film. Like many independent films of the period, "Plan 9" was distributed under a states' rights basis . 
"Plan 9" was screened as part of a double feature at various times. In Chicago, it was first seen in January 1959, alongside the British thriller "Time Lock" (1957). A film which is mostly remembered as an early film credit for Sean Connery. Later that year, it was used as a "co-feature" (B movie) for double-feature screenings of "The Trap" (1959), a film noir with Richard Widmark as its star. In Texas, it was seen alongside "Devil Girl From Mars" (1954), a British science fiction film. Not long after, the picture was distributed through a television package.
"Plan 9 From Outer Space" gained notoriety through the Medveds' book because of its multiple continuity problems.
Critics say the absurdity of the film is found in the dialogue rather than on-screen action. Criswell's opening narration redundantly informs the viewer that "future events such as these will affect you in the future", while referring to viewers as "my friends" four times in the same minute. Criswell also begins the narration by referring to future events, only to later describe them in the past tense ("... the full story of what happened on that fateful day"), and inexplicably calling for "the guilty" to be punished.
Several exterior sets on sound-stages are interspersed with second-unit footage shot outdoors (for example, the old man's reanimated corpse chasing Paula Trent through the cemetery). In a number of these scenes the outdoor footage was intended to be shot day-for-night, but this is not apparent in video transfers of the film, making these scenes contrast harshly against the on-set footage.
During the first airplane cockpit scene, the first officer is visibly reading from the script in his lap, and a flash of light from a flying saucer reveals the shadow of the boom microphone. The microphone and first officer's script are not visible in the film's original theatrical release, as they do not fit in the frame in its intended projection aspect ratio of 1.85:1. These mistakes are noticeable only in the film's open matte transfer on video.
Music.
The music for "Plan 9 from Outer Space" was compiled by Gordon Zahler. Zahler used stock recordings of works by about a dozen composers, which was a fairly common procedure in the 1950s for scoring low-budget films and television programs. However, Zahler apparently never provided a reliable accounting for the score. In 1996, Paul Mandell produced a CD that recreated the film's score by tracking down the stock recordings and the composers; Mandell subsequently wrote an article about the film's music for "Film Score Monthly". Some websites do now credit these composers.
Documentations.
In 1992, the film was the subject of a documentary called "Flying Saucers Over Hollywood: The Plan 9 Companion", which is included on Image Entertainment's DVD edition of "Plan 9". The documentary visits several locations related to the film, including the building with Ed Wood's former office (at 4477 Hollywood Blvd), and what was left of the small sound stage used for the film's interiors, which is down a small alley next to the Harvey Apartments at 5640 Santa Monica Boulevard. That same year, Rudolph Grey's book, "Nightmare of Ecstasy: The Life and Art of Edward D. Wood, Jr.", was published, and contained anecdotes regarding the making of this film. Grey notes that participants in the original events sometimes contradict one another, but he relates each person's information for posterity regardless.
In 2006, another documentary by Kevin Sean Michaels, titled "Vampira: The Movie", chronicled Maila Nurmi's work with Wood and her role as television's first horror host.
Legacy.
"Plan 9" is widely considered the worst film in the history of cinema. However, when as many reviews as possible were collected on the review site Rotten Tomatoes, the report was that 66% of critics gave the film positive reviews. Many of them stated that the film is simply too amusing to be considered the worst film ever made, claiming that its ineptitude added to its charm. There were also claims that the director managed to convey some interesting ideas. As of 2011, "Plan 9" has failed to place in the IMDb Bottom 100, a list compiled using average scores given by Internet Movie Database users, though some of Wood's other movies have. In 1996, the film received a salute by author of the "Cult Flicks and Trash Pics" edition of VideoHound, in which it is stated that "The film has become so famous for its own badness that it's now beyond criticism."
The film's title was the inspiration for the name of Bell Labs' successor to the Unix operating system. Plan 9 from Bell Labs was developed over several years starting in the mid-1980s and released to the general public in 1995.
In 1996, Paul Mandell produced a Compact Disc (CD) that recreated the musical score from the film; the CD was released by the now-defunct Retrosonic Corp. In 1997, David G. Smith wrote and composed the music for "Plan 9 from Outer Space: The Musical".
In 2006, a stage adaptation of the film, "Plan LIVE from Outer Space!", was staged in the Toronto Fringe Festival. The play was written by James Gordon Taylor (based entirely on Wood's script). The play won a Canadian Comedy Award the following year.
In 1991, Eternity Comics released a three-issue series titled "Plan 9 from Outer Space: Thirty Years Later!", which served as an unofficial sequel to the film.
An adventure game of the same name was made in which the player must recover the film from Lugosi's double, who has stolen it.
The film was included in live performances at the SF Sketchfest by The Film Crew, composed of former "Mystery Science Theater 3000" cast members Michael J. Nelson, Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett. A commentary based on these performances was released by RiffTrax, advertised as a "Three Riffer Edition", due to the fact that Nelson's solo commentary for the film's colorized DVD release had already been sold as an audio file on the Rifftrax website. On August 20, 2009, the RiffTrax trio performed the commentary at a live event in Nashville, Tennessee, and the performance was broadcast to theaters across the United States.
Revisions.
In 2006 Legend Films released a colorized version of "Plan 9 from Outer Space" on DVD. Though the colorization process was largely done straight, unlike the campy bright colors used in the studio's release of "Reefer Madness", there were a few alterations. Legend had auctioned off the opportunity to insert new material into the film through two auctions on eBay. The first allowed the auction winner to provide a photograph that is digitally inserted into part of the scene between the Ghoul Man and Paula Trent. The second allowed the winner to have his or her name placed on a gravestone during a scene with Wood regular Tor Johnson. The third alteration is at a point where Eros gets punched and his skin briefly turns green.
The Legend Films colorized "Plan 9 from Outer Space" was screened in Atlanta, Georgia at the Plaza Theatre on September 9, 2006, and was hosted live by Elvira impersonator Patterson Lundquist with a live running commentary. As a part of the promotion sets of the autographed Michael J. Nelson DVD were given away as prizes. The event was featured in "The Atlanta Journal-Constitution" and served as the grand re-opening of the theatre, which had fallen on hard times under previous ownership.
Autographed pre-release copies of the DVD were made available in 2005, and the colorized version was also given special theatrical screenings at various theaters throughout the United States, including the Castro Theatre. The DVD featured an audio commentary track by comedian Michael J. Nelson of "Mystery Science Theater 3000" fame, in which he heckles, or "riffs" the film in a style similar to an episode of the series, a restored black-and-white version of "Plan 9", a home video of Wood in drag performing a striptease (Wood, in real life, was a transvestite) and a comedic feature narrated by Nelson detailing the "lost" Plans 1–8. The autographed edition also came with a limited edition air freshener. Nelson's commentary is also available through his company RiffTrax, where it can be downloaded as either an MP3 audio file or a DivX video file with the commentary embedded into the colorized version of the film.
The San Diego-based 3-D production & conversion studio PassmoreLab is currently working on the 3-D version of the original film.
Remakes.
Filmmaker Ernie Fosselius created the short film, "Plan 9.1 From Outer Space", which featured hand-carved wooden puppets of the characters from the film. The puppets acted out the scenes along with the edited soundtrack of the original film.
As of September 2009, there are two more proposed remakes:

Crossmichael

Crossmichael (Scottish Gaelic: "Crois Mhìcheil") is a small village on the east side of Loch Ken about north of Castle Douglas in Scotland. 
Crossmichael is also the name of the Civil Parish in Kirkcudbrightshire, in the District Council Region of Dumfries and Galloway.
Crossmichael was first recorded in AD1164 when Galloway was an independent land.
Crossmichael has a pub, a marina, and a church with a distinctive steeple.
The A713 road runs through Crossmichael. It is on the 520 bus route. 
Townhead of Greenlaw is a mile to its south. The site of Greenlaw, Crossmichael, National Grid Reference (NGR): NX 74800 64500, is said to be a Roman burial ground, and occupies rising ground. 
A Roman fort once existed to the south near Glenlochar barrage. 
Sixteen other forts, mottes, stone circles and cairns all lie within 3 miles of Crossmichael.
The Church.
The village name comes from the ‘ Cross of St. Michael’ patron saint of the original church.
The Parish of Crossmichael is recorded as far back as the 12th century. A building was believed to be present prior to AD1547 as the earliest tombstone in the churchyard bears that date. The present church building dates from 1751, but includes the distinctive round tower of earlier date. Some evidence suggests that the round tower was built around 1611 by Sir Robert Gordon of Greenlaw, Crossmichael Parish. The date on the bell (1611) in the round tower tends to confirm this. 
The Churchyard has Covenanters graves dating from the ‘ Killing Times ‘ of the 1680, a fine enriched Gordon monument (1757), a table stone with an acrostic epitaph to Rev Andrew Dick, and three war graves.
Famous people.
Sir Robert Gordon, 1st Baronet (c.1565 - 1628) On 12 July 1626 he was appointed a member of the Council of war for Scotland and a Commissioner for the Middle Shires, residing at Greenlaw, Crossmichael Parish, Kirkcudbrightshire (near Culvennan. He donated the bell that is in the Crossmichael Church Tower.
Sir Robert Gordon was one of the first to embark in the scheme for the establishment of colonies in America, having on 8 November 1621 obtained a charter of what was called the barony of Galloway in Nova Scotia, and in 1625 he published a tract on the subject. "Encouragements for such as shall have intention to bee Vndertakers in the new plantation...By mee Lochinvar...Edinburgh, 1625" His 2nd son, Robert Gordon of Gelston joined with his father in (The Plantation of America) in the grant of the barony of Galloway in Nova Scotia in 1621. On 1 July 1629, 70 Scots under the leadership of James Stewart, 4th Lord Ochiltree of Killeith, landed at Baleine, Cape Breton Island, probably encouraged by Sir Robert Gordon of Lochinvar (who resided at Greenlaw, Crossmichael Parish).

Willie Savage

Willie Savage from Burnbank was a former Scottish footballer, best known with Dumfries club Queen of the South.
Early days.
Savage was a native of Burnbank who began his football as an inside forward at the local St Cuthbert School and representing Lanarkshire elementary schools against Glasgow. On leaving school he played in the junior league as centre forward for his local club Burnbank. Three seasons later he went to St Cuthbert C.Y.M.S. This was a one season stay before returning to Burnbank for a further season. The next season he was with Falkirk side Shieldhall Thistle. He played for the Hamilton 'A' team before rejoining the junior league with Motherwell Juniors.
Queen of the South.
Willie Savage signed for Queens from Motherwell Juniors in 1932. Savage made his debut as a trialist on 1 October 1932 in the 10-0 league thrashing of Bo'ness at Palmerston Park. The result took Queens to the top of the table. A second trial followed two weeks later against Albion Rovers and he was signed immediately after that game as other clubs took an interest in him.
Savage was one of the mainstays of the team that won Queen of the South promotion to Scotland's top division for the first time in the club's history, when they ended season 1932-33 with a victory over Second Division champions Hibernian and finished as runners-up.
As a player Willie Savage was part of many landmark events in the history of Queen of the South:-
During World War II Savage guested for St Mirren, Albion Rovers and Dumbarton. Savage returned to Queens at the end of the war and played with the club until 1947. Savage was a tremendous player and Captain of Queen of the South and played for the first team 369 times. Savage is 9th highest in the club's record appearances list. Savage was the first ever Queens player to reach 300 first class games, a feat even today achieved by less than 20 players.
Savage was known as a scrupulously fair tackler and he formed a great full back partnership with Willie Culbert. His sterling performances made him a fans favourite and he was also well liked by his team mates. Off the park he would entertain team mates on away fixture trips by playing the mouth organ.
Among the others at Queens in the 1930s with Savage were fellow players Willie Culbert, Willie Ferguson, Joe Tulip, Irish international Laurie Cumming and Jackie Oakes. He played under managers George McLachlan, Ferguson as McLachlan's successor and also Jimmy McKinnell Senior.
After the promotion from Savage's first season at Queen of the South "1932-33", all of Savage's Queens career was spent in Scotland's top division.
From 1933, excluding war time interruption, Queen of the South spent only one season 1950-51 out of Scotland's top division until 1959. Queen of the South won the Scottish League Division B Championship in season "1950-51" on goal average from Stirling Albion. Both clubs finished on 45 points from their 30 games played.

River Leader

The River Leader, or Leader Water, is a small tributary of the River Tweed in Lauderdale in the Scottish Borders. It flows southwards from the Lammermuir Hills through the towns of Lauder and Earlston, joining the River Tweed at Leaderfoot.
The journey.
The feeder burns of the Leader Water are the Headshaw Burn, the Hillhouse Burn and the Kelphope Burn. They combine at the Carfrae mill hotel and the village of Oxton. The river is now sandwiched between the A68 and the A697, and it has absorbed the Cleekhimin Burn, Harry Burn, Washing Burn and Earnscleugh Burn.
The Leader Water now passes to the east of the town of Lauder, by Thirlestane Castle. The A679 bridges the river which continues past Lauder Barns, West Mains and St. Leonards where the Leader receives his final feeder burn, the Boondreigh Burn.

T. Muthuswamy Iyer

Sir Thiruvarur Muthuswamy Iyer KCIE (January 28, 1832 – January 25, 1895) was an Indian lawyer who, in 1877, became the first native Indian to be appointed as judge of the Madras High Court. He also acted as the Chief Justice of the Madras High Court in 1893. He is also one of the first Indians to have a statue.
Iyer was born in a poor Brahmin family of Vuchuwadi in the Tanjore district of the Madras Presidency. He lost his father when he was young and completed his schooling at in Madras with the assistance of the "tahsildar" Muthuswami Naicken.
On completion of his schooling, Iyer served in subordinate posts in the civil service even while continuing his education. Iyer graduated in law from the Presidency College, Madras while serving as the magistrate of police and served as a judge in mofussil centres from 1871 to 1877, when he was appointed to the bench of the High Court of Madras. Iyer served as a judge of the Madras High Court from 1877 till his death in 1895, even acting as the Chief Justice for three months in 1893.
Iyer was acclaimed for his sharp intellect, memory and legal expertise. He advocated social reform and campaigned in support of women's education, widow re-marriage and the legal recognition of "sambandham". However, he was criticized for his alleged remarks on temple entry and views on "Varnashrama Dharma". In 1893, Iyer was made a Knight Commander of the Indian Empire in recognition of his services.
Early life.
Iyer was born in a poor Brahmin family in Vuchuwadi, Madras Presidency, British India on January 28, 1832. Iyer's father, Venkata Narayana Sastri, died when Muthuswamy was young and he moved with his mother to Thiruvarur to make a living. At Thiruvarur, Iyer found employment as village accountant. However, his mother died soon afterward leaving Iyer with little support. Around this time, Iyer's talents were recognized by the "tahsildar" Muthuswamy Naicken who arranged for the former to study at Sir Henry Montgomery's school in Madras as a companion to his young nephew, and there he won prizes and scholarships year after year.
In 1854, Iyer won a prize of 500 rupees offered to the students of the Madras presidency by the council of education for the best English essay. This success brought him to the notice of Sir Alexander John Arbuthnot and Mr. Justice Holloway. He was offered help to proceed to England and compete for the civil service, but being a Brahmin and married, he declined to cross the ocean. Instead he entered the subordinate government service, and was employed in such various posts as school-teacher, record-keeper in Tanjore, and in 1856 deputy-inspector of schools.
Legal career.
About this time, the Madras government instituted an examination for pleaders known as "Pleader's Test". In the examination held at Kumbakonam in February 1856, only three succeeded, Iyer and R. Raghunatha Rao emerging first and second. On successfully passing the Pleader's Test, Iyer was appointed District Munsiff of Tranquebar. On July 2, 1859, Iyer was appointed Deputy Collector of Tanjore.On July 9, 1865, Ier was appointed Sub-Judge of South Canara and served till July 1868, when he was appointed District Magistrate of police at Madras.
While serving as the magistrate of police, Iyer obtained his law degree law from the Presidency College, Madras. He also held a degree in Sanskrit at that time.
Iyer commenced his legal career immediately after graduation. He was appointed a judge of the Court of Small Causes in 1871. The very next year, he was made Fellow of Madras University. In 1877, the Madras Government took the controversial decision to appoint him as the first Indian judge of the High Court of Madras.
Appointment to the bench of Madras High Court and controversy.
In 1877, Iyer was appointed to the bench of the High Court of Madras. He was the first Indian to be appointed to this prestigious post. However, Muthuswamy's appointment was vehemently condemned by a Madras newspaper called "The Native Public Opinion". This prompted a strong reaction from Indian nationalists who founded "The Hindu" newspaper to voice public opinion against the outrage.
Later career.
Muthuswami Iyer served as a judge of the Madras High Court from 1877 to 1895. He acted for three months in 1893 as the Chief Justice of the Madras High Court, the first Indian to do so.
Reforms.
During his early career, Iyer also served as the President of the "Malabar Marriage Commission". During his tenure as President of the Commission, he campaigned for the legal recognition of Sambandham and other forms of marriage practised in the Malabar. In 1872, Iyer established the Widow Remarriage Association in Madras and advocated remarriage of Brahmin widows.
In 1872, he was nominated fellow of the Madras University. He became a syndic in 1877. He was also invited to attend the Coronation Durbar at Delhi in 1877.
Honours.
In 1878, Muthuswami Iyer was created a Companion of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire. In 1893, he was knighted for his services to the Crown.
Death.
Muthuswami Iyer died in January 1895 after an illness of ten days. On his death, Sir S. Subramania Iyer took the seat in the bench of the Madras High Court left vacant by his death.
A statue of Muthuswami Iyer was erected in the precincts of the Madras High Court campus. The section of Kamrajar Salai connecting Chepauk with the Madras High Court is known as T. Muthuswamy Salai.
Controversial stand on temple entry.
Being a devout Brahmin, Muthuswami Iyer literally interpreted the dharma-shastras and Hindu religious texts and rigorously followed them. As a result, some of his speeches on caste and temple-entry have been controversial.
Muthuswami Iyer once said :
Another remark of his is regarded by the intellectuals of the Dravidar Kazhagam as blatantly casteist:

Wlodzimierz Ksiazek

Włodzimierz Książek (1951, Warsaw, Poland - body found May 18, 2011), Pawtucket, USA) was a Polish-born contemporary artist based in New England, and since 2001 worked from a 6000 sq. ft. studio in Rhode Island. He was best known for his large-scale abstract paintings.
Life.
Ksiazek studied at the Warsaw Academy of Fine Arts where he received a Master of Fine Arts degree in Painting and Art in Architecture in 1975. He emigrated to the United States in 1982 as a political refugee, escaping martial law in Poland. He became part of a community of visual artists, poets, and writers working on the Eastern seaboard. He had been a permanent resident of the United States since 1988. His mysterious death, in his studio in Pawtucket, RI, where his body was discovered on May 18, 2011, is still under investigation.
Wlodzimierz Ksiazek is survived by his daughter Veronica Goldhagen.
Work.
His works are abstract. Ksiazek used oil paints and encaustic painting on large canvasses to build up layers with thin washes and impastos, then scratches, splatters, gouges and picks at the paint to create incised geometric forms and lines. His works took up to six months to complete, and were usually untitled. He, personally, disliked to call his paintings abstract. If forced to label his work, he would use the term, "Constructionist."
Donald Kuspit, a professor of art history and philosophy noted that "The hard work that Ksiazek puts into his paintings ... in a constant effort to strike a new balance between two dimensions and three dimensions ... is what makes Ksiazek's paintings creative "advances" in the history of painting."
Wlodzimierz Ksiazek exhibited at Marisa Del Re Gallery and John Gibson Gallery in New York. He had numerous solo exhibitions at the Kouros Gallery in New York, and the Alpha Gallery in Boston., as well as throughout the United States, Europe and Asia. His other solo exhibition record includes venues such as the Consulate General of the Republic of Poland in New York. His work resides in numerous public and private collections in the United States and abroad.

Victory Forge Military Academy

Victory Forge Military Academy, located in Port St. Lucie, Florida, is a year-round boarding school that utilizes military-style components for behavior modification. It enrolls "rebellious and troubled" adolescent males under the age of 18. The academy states that it is accredited by the National Association of Christian Education (NACE).
History.
The facility was formerly a children's home founded in May 1985 by Rev. William Brink, who also operated Brinkhaven Homes for Youth in Ohio, where he was convicted for sexually molesting female students. Brink's two sons, Dale and Mark, a daughter, Molly, and her husband, Alan Weierman, were named as corporate officers. In 1992, Alan Weierman changed the name from Victory Children's Home to Treasure Coast Victory Children's Home and filed papers to have the home incorporated in Florida. In 1993, St. Lucie County commissioners voted to evict the residents of the facility from county property because Weierman refused to seek a state license to operate the shelter for neglected children. 
In November 2009, Weierman registered a new nonprofit organization called Southeastern Military Academy, Inc., at the Victory Forge address. As of January 2010, the "Southeastern Military Academy" name was being used on promotional materials for the program operating at the Victory Forge location.
Alan Weierman.
The president or commanding officer of Victory Forge, often referred to as "the Colonel", is Alan Weierman. He lists his qualifications as including a Ph.D in specialized business, a masters degree in counseling and psychology, certification as a behavioral analyst, and (as of 2008) 29 years of experience in child care and youth services.
Mr. Weierman was a troubled youth himself. His father was an alcoholic who supposedly was a very violent man who beat up the family daily. Mr. Weierman's mother died when he was 11. Mr. Weierman has stated that he was an alcoholic by age 10 and was involved with drugs, gangs, and crime. 
In 1986, while working at his father-in-law's Brinkhaven Home in Ohio, Mr. Weierman was accused by a 16-year-old female resident at the facility of having had sex with her 30 times between August 1985 and June 1986. The police chief of Lawrence Township stated that "his investigation found sufficient probable cause to prosecute Weierman, including a polygraph test given the girl and a calendar she kept of the alleged sexual encounters". The case against Weierman was later dropped.
In 1989, Weierman was charged with obstructing justice for not reporting an allegation of child molestation that two girls made against a former director of the school. The charges were later dropped due to a lack of evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.
Child abuse allegations.
The school's disciplinary practices, including the use of physical restraints, have resulted in allegations of child abuse. Weierman has acknowledged that the school uses shackles as a disciplinary measure, saying that the school instructs boys that they will be shackled if they try to run away. 
Between 1994 and 2008, the Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) investigated 35 child abuse allegations regarding Victory Forge. 
In 2000, the DCF was on the verge of revoking Victory Forge's state license, but the home surrendered its license without a fight the day a judge was to hear evidence against the facility. The cause of this violation was that officials from the facility left a 17-year old boy at another shelter without advanced notification or arrangements. In addition, the officials allowed a child with a history of sexual offenses to share a bedroom with another boy.
In 2002, police reported that students at the academy alleged that "they had been struck with metal pipes and a wooden paddle as methods of punishment". 
At the conclusion of an investigation in April 2008, the DCF stated that the agency had "serious concerns about the safety and welfare of children," but there were no criminal violations. The DCF summary report stated that Victory Forge staff were believed to have "engaged in physical discipline that is harmful to children, such as choking to unconsciousness, punching, kicking, banging heads into walls and cabinets." DCF officials found evidence that a boy had been choked and subjected to bizarre punishment and mental injury, and that other boys had been threatened with harm. It had been reported in local media that there had been children found bound in shackles at the facility. DCF also noted that staff at the academy had a "pattern" of leaving the facility during an investigation. DCF officials used a private investigator to find one staff member, who then told DCF officials he had left because of the DCF investigation. He also told DCF that he felt abuse was occurring. In June 2008, police and state prosecutors concluded that Victory Forge had violated the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice policies on use of shackles and other physical restraints, but no criminal violations had occurred.

Crossrail Act 2008

The Crossrail Act 2008 (c 18) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that authorises the construction of the Crossrail railway from Maidenhead and Heathrow Airport to Shenfield and Abbey Wood. The legislation was introduced by the then Secretary of State for Transport Douglas Alexander and received Royal Assent on 22 July 2008. The Crossrail bill was introduced on 22 February 2005 and was carried over between sessions of Parliament on three occasions. Although public Bills generally pass through Parliament in a single session, this was a Hybrid Bill, which has the characteristics of both public and private bills and is subject to scrutiny in the same way as both a public and private bill, and generally takes longer to be considered. The last such hybrid bill introduced led to the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Act 1996.
Sections.
Works.
"For more detail of the route of Crossrail see the separate article on Crossrail."
The Crossrail Act 2008 provides for the construction of a tunnel with a western portal at Royal Oak in Westminster, London and eastern portals at Custom House and Pudding Mill Lane, both in the Borough of Newham in east London. It also allows for the construction of railways in the surrounding boroughs, in Greater London and in parts of Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, and Essex, but will in practice only involve improvements to the existing main line railways it will share outside central London. There is also an exemption to Section 31(7) of the Electricity Act 1989 which states that all overhead lines must be approved by the Secretary of State before being built. Instead, overhead lines may be built within the railways located in previously mentioned land.
Land.
The Secretary of State may acquire any land mentioned in the Act after the passage of the Crossrail Act 2008. Although there is a five year limit on land acquisition, the Secretary of State may extend this power for up to another five years. In addition, private rights of way may be extinguished upon the passing of the Crossrail Act 2008 and the loss of these rights must be compensated.

Bert Winfield

Herbert Benjamin 'Bert' Winfield (1878 - 21 September 1919) was an English rugby union player who played international rugby for Wales. He was a member of the winning Welsh team who beat the 1905 touring All Blacks and captained Wales against Ireland in 1908. He played club rugby for Cardiff. 
Winfield is not one of the most well known of the players from the first Welsh Golden Era, which was probably due to his solid but unspectacular style of play. He was a strong kicker of the ball and in the fifteen matches he played for his country he scored 14 conversions and 6 penalty goals.
International career.
Wales.
As Winfield was Nottingham born, he initially attended trials, at Exeter, for the England rugby team towards the end of 1901. The Western Mail's rugby correspondent reported that Winfield made "disastrous and uncharacteristic errors", and the England selectors chose Devonport's H.T. Gamlin in his position. On his arrival back in Wales Winfield told reporters that he now intended to represent Wales. 
Winfield made his debut for Wales against Ireland in March 1903, after four and half seasons playing for Cardiff. Winfield may well have played earlier for Wales, but the full-back position before him was first held by the legendary Billy Bancroft and then the dependable Strand-Jones. 
Although chosen to represent his country on 15 occasions Winfield converted only 20 tries which is seen as a poor return. Though many commentators argue that the matches in which Winfield played were in terrible weather conditions, such as gales or fog, and the fact that the selectors kept faith in him lends credence to the argument.
Winfield’s accurate kicking was highlighted in two international matches. The first was the 1904 game against England when with only a few minutes to spare, Winfield kicked a goal from the half way line to draw the game. The second was during the historic 1905 match against the All Blacks. Although Winfield missed the difficult conversion after Teddy Morgan’s try it was his tight kicking game that was key, when Wales switched their on-field strategy to a defensive style of play. Whereas the New Zealand Full Back kicked to the open side, tiring his own forwards, Winfield chose extremely long and accurate kicking to touch to slow the game down for his pack. The All Blacks regarded Winfield as the best full back they had faced on the tour.
Winfield was not always celebrated for his style of play. Against Ireland in 1904 he allowed the ball to bounce before attempting to collect it, a common habit in his play, allowing the Irish winger to steal the ball from him, score a try and win the game.
International games played.
Wales
Later career and death.
In 1901 Winfield set up a laundry business in Newport with Gwyn Nicholls his brother-in-law and fellow Welsh international. As the Winfield family had a history of working in the laundry business, Nicholls was more of a sleeping partner, but this changed in 1914 when Winfield joined the British Army. Joining the 16th Battalion (City of Cardiff) of the Welsh Regiment, Winfield was posted to France. Winfield returned from the Front but died in 1919 from injuries he received in a motorcycle accident.

The Kevin Bishop Show

The Kevin Bishop Show was a sketch comedy written by and starring English comedian Kevin Bishop, part of the "Star Stories" team. The show was commissioned by Channel 4 for a six-part series starting on 25 July 2008 at 10pm. A pilot was broadcast on 23 November 2007 as part of Channel 4's "Comedy Showcase" and the programme soon earned interest for its incredibly fast pace; 42 sketches were shown in 23 minutes. The show was nominated for Best New Comedy at the 2008 British Comedy Awards. The show started its second series on Friday 31 July 2009 at 10pm on Channel 4.
Overview.
The sketch show is fast-paced and based on channel flicking through channels on Sky Digital. On screen is a replica of the Sky Search and Scan banner and TV guide. Unlike the pilot, the search and scan banner displays the date which is the same as the date the episode is being broadcast, with roughly the same time as it is being broadcast. There are many other TV presentation references throughout the show, mostly related to the TV channels the "shows" are on.
The show received 194 complaints to Channel 4, making it the second most complained about programme on Channel 4 during August 2008, after "Big Brother" 9. Several complaints were made regarding a musical parody of the Holocaust drama "Sophie's Choice", as well as parodies of children's toys adverts on Channel 5, such as 'The 9/11 Playset', 'The Terrorist Concentration Camp Playset'. A second series of the show was broadcast in July 2009.
The show was written by Bishop, producer Lee Hupfield (creator of Banzai), Paul Hupfield, Lisa Fishwick, Martin Delaney and writer/performer Les Keen.
Sketches.
There are many sketches on the show, parodying current TV adverts and shows. These include:
DVD releases.
A DVD containing all six episodes of the first series was released on 7 September 2009. It also contains the pilot episode of the show.

Cryofixation

Cryofixation is a technique for fixation or stabilisation of biological materials as the first step in specimen preparation for electron microscopy. Typical specimens for cryofixation include small samples of plant or animal tissue, cell suspensions of microorganisms or cultured cells, suspensions of viruses or virus capsids and samples of purified macromolecules, especially proteins.
The method involves ultra-rapid cooling of small samples to the temperature of liquid nitrogen (−196 °C) or below, stopping all motion and metabolic activity and preserving the internal structure by freezing all fluid phases solid. The ultimate objective is to freeze the specimen so rapidly (at 104 to 106 K per second) that ice crystals are unable to form, or are prevented from growing big enough to cause damage to the specimen's ultrastructure. The formation of samples containing specimens in amorphous ice is the holy grail of biological cryomicroscopy.
However, in practice, it is very difficult to achieve high enough cooling rates to produce amorphous ice in specimens more than a few micrometres in thickness. For this purpose, plunging a specimen into liquid nitrogen at its boiling point (−196 °C) does not always freeze the specimen fast enough, for several reasons. First, the liquid nitrogen boils rapidly around the specimen forming a film of insulating gas that slows heat transfer to the cryogenic liquid, known as the Leidenfrost effect. Cooling rates can be improved by pumping the liquid nitrogen with a rotary vane vacuum pump for a few dozen seconds before plunging the specimen into it. This lowers the temperature of the liquid nitrogen below its boiling point, so that when the specimen is plunged into it, it envelops the specimen closely for a brief period of time and extracts heat from it more efficiently. Even faster cooling can be obtained by plunging specimens into liquid propane or ethane (ethane has been found to be more efficient) cooled very close to their melting points using liquid nitrogen or by slamming the specimen against highly-polished liquid nitrogen-cooled metal surfaces made of copper or silver. Secondly, two properties of water itself prevent rapid cryofixation in large specimens. The thermal conductivity of ice is very low compared with that of metals, and water releases of latent heat of fusion as it freezes, defeating rapid cooldown in specimens more than a few micrometres thick.
Self pressurized rapid freezing (SPRF) which can utilize many different cryogens has recently been touted as an attractive and low cost alternative to high pressure freezing (HPF).

Goodwin Memorial African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church

The Goodwin Memorial African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church is a historic church on Woodside Avenue in Amherst, Massachusetts.
The church, built in 1910, is located down a narrow lane in the otherwise residential neighborhood. It is about wide and long, and is styled in the Craftsman style popular at the time of its construction. It remains significantly unaltered since it was built.
The church is named for Moses Goodwin, a local resident and parishioner. It was the second building for the African American congregation that occupies it; the first, built in 1869 on a nearby lot, was demolished in 1917. It continues to be a social and religious center for Amherst's African American community. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.

North Cemetery

North Cemetery is a historic cemetery in Worthington, Massachusetts. The municipal cemetery is located at the corner of Cold and North Streets not far from Worthington Corners; it is the town's largest cemetery. About have been formally laid out in a roughly rectangular shape. Its date of establishment is uncertain; its earliest grave marker dates to 1790. A number of the town's founders and early leading citizens are buried there.
Three of the cemetery's four sides are lined with stone walls, setting it off from the surrounding woods and fields. Access is through three breaks in the wall, two of which provide vehicular access. The eastern two breaks are marked by granite posts about four feet high that bear evidence of having had gates mounted on them. In the southeaster corner of the cemetery is the remnant of a storage vault, which was used until the 1950s to hold caskets when winter conditions made interment impossible. The cemetery has over 700 markers, mostly of granite or marble. The most prominent grave is that of the Horace Cole family, which features a zinc obelisk erected in 1877.
The cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.

Music of the Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles series

The "Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles" video game series consists of "Crystal Chronicles", a spin-off of the main "Final Fantasy" series, its sequels ' and ', and their spin-offs , ', ' and "". "Crystal Chronicles", "Ring of Fates", and "Echoes of Time" have had released soundtrack albums to date, and "Crystal Chronicles" and "Ring of Fates" each have an associated single. Kumi Tanioka is the main composer for the series, having composed the three released soundtracks as well as the music for "My Life as a King" and "My Life as a Darklord". Hidenori Iwasaki is filling that role for "The Crystal Bearers". Nobuo Uematsu, the main composer for the regular "Final Fantasy" series, contributed one track to the "Ring of Fates" soundtrack. Yae and Donna Burke sang the Japanese and English versions of the theme song for "Crystal Chronicles", respectively, while Aiko sang the theme song for "Ring of Fates".
"Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Original Soundtrack" was released by Pony Canyon in 2003, as was its single, "Kaze no Ne", and a promotional album "Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles - A Musical Journey". "Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Ring of Fates Original Soundtrack" and the double A-side "Hoshi no Nai Sekai"/"Yokogao" were released by Pony Canyon in 2007. The latest release is that of "Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Echoes of Time Original Soundtrack" by Square Enix in 2009. All the albums and the singles received generally positive reviews, although the "Crystal Chronicles" album was the most universally appreciated of the three soundtracks. Unlike the soundtracks to the numbered "Final Fantasy" games, no compositions from the "Crystal Chronicles" soundtracks have appeared in any compilation albums produced by Square Enix or any official "Final Fantasy" concerts. "Morning Sky", the opening theme for "Crystal Chronicles", was played in the first Games in Concert performance in Utrecht, Netherlands on November 26, 2006.
Creation and influence.
Kumi Tanioka has described the musical style for the soundtrack to "Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles" as being based on "ancient instruments". She says that the idea came to her while looking at illustrations of the game world, which gave her the idea of making "world music", where the tracks would "not limited to a single country or culture". She also credits Hidenori Iwasaki, the synthesizer operator for the game, with doing "fantastic technical work" that brought her vision to life. For the soundtrack to "Ring of Fates", Tanioka purposefully did not focus on "world music", instead focusing on "creating a new landscape containing the same atmosphere". The piano performances in the "Ring of Fates" soundtrack were done by Kumi Tanioka. She did the performances herself rather than use an outside performer as most "Final Fantasy" soundtracks have done primarily because she "likes to play piano", and were done without any sheet music, as she preferred instead to improvise. She took extensive piano lessons as a child, and lists piano and choral music as the biggest influences on her musical style. She also claims to have been influenced by music from a wide variety of cultures, such as Indonesian, Irish and Balinese music. She will not be composing the soundtrack for "The Crystal Bearers"; this role will be performed by Hidenori Iwasaki.
Tanioka has said that in composing the soundtrack for "Echoes of Time" she tried to "paint the world in a ethnic manner once again". She has said that she tried throughout the soundtracks of the first four "Crystal Chronicles" games to "maintain a common atmosphere between each installment, always introduce a new concept". With "Echoes of Time" Tanioka wanted to go back to the "tribal" concept of the original "Crystal Chronicles". She has said in regards to the soundtrack that "instead of the traditional sound endemic to the specific areas, I wanted to use them as one flavor and blend many colors just like "Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles"" and that many of the tracks she created would be "actually impossible to perform" in real life.
Albums.
"Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Original Soundtrack".
"Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Original Soundtrack" is the soundtrack album of "Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles", containing the majority of the musical tracks from the game, and was composed by Kumi Tanioka. It was released on the Pony Canyon label on August 20, 2003. The album did not include the English versions of the opening song, "Sound of the Wind" and the ending theme, "Moonless Starry Night", all sung by Donna Burke. The style of the music on this album is not defined, but was described by Kumi Tanioka as being based on "ancient instruments". The soundtrack has extensive use of many medieval and Renaissance musical instruments such as the recorder, the crumhorn and the lute, creating a distinctively rustic feel, and also follows the practices and styles of medieval music. The soundtrack spans 52 tracks over 2 discs, covering a duration of 2:11:38, and has the catalog number PCCG-00613.
"Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: A Musical Journey" was a European promotional album which was given alongside the game on March 11, 2004 if the game had been pre-ordered. It contains six tracks from the soundtrack, including "Kaze no Ne" in both Japanese and English, the only time the English version has been released. It was published by Nintendo of Europe, and covers a duration of 17:37.
"Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles Original Soundtrack" was well received; Daniel Space of RPGFan praised it, saying that "the music is fun, extremely well written and interesting to hear". He enjoyed the alternative instruments used in the tunes, calling them "successful in providing imagery of renaissance times", although he felt that much more of them would have begun to drag the soundtrack down. Chris of Square Enix Music Online also enjoyed the soundtrack, although he noted that it was "not for everyone". He did, however, feel that the constant use of Renaissance-themed music resulted in a "lack of diversity of styles" that made several of the tracks "bland and indistinctive". Jared of Square Enix Music Online was more enthusiastic about the soundtrack, terming it "a stunning soundtrack full of feeling and emotion" and praising its "unique" style. As a promotional album, "Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles - A Musical Journey" was not as noted by critics. Jared felt that it was "a decent look into the soundtrack of Crystal Chronicles", but not as good of a sampler disc as it could have been due to the track selection.
Track listing
"Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Ring of Fates Original Soundtrack".
"Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Ring of Fates Original Soundtrack" is the soundtrack album of "Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Ring of Fates", containing all of the musical tracks from the game, and was composed and produced by Kumi Tanioka. The ending theme song for the game, , was sung by Aiko, though it was not included in the album, and Nobuo Uematsu contributed one track to the soundtrack. The soundtrack continues the musical theme of "ancient instruments" prevalent in the "Crystal Chronicles" soundtrack, but additionally incorporates more modern orchestral instruments such as string and horn pieces. The tracks on the album cover a wide range of emotional themes, from "joyful and whimsical tracks" to "lugubrious emotional tracks" to "bombastic battle tracks". In keeping with the lighthearted nature of the game, any darker-themed tracks are exaggerated to make them less serious. The soundtrack spans 57 tracks, covering a duration of 1:16:06. It was released on September 19, 2007 in Japan by Square Enix bearing the catalog number SQEX-10101.
"Ring of Fates" was well received by reviewers; Neal Chandran of RPGFan, although finding the original soundtrack to be "bland", felt that the "Crystal Chronicles" soundtrack was "quite varied, exciting, and dare I say really freaking good" and praised the variety of styles and moods of the tracks. Chris was also enthusiastic about the soundtrack, praising it as "one of the finest accompaniments to a Final Fantasy game ever produced". He noted, however, that the soundtrack works best as a "flowing" work or accompaniment to the game, with a lack of individual tracks that stood out as memorable. Don of Square Enix Music Online was much harsher towards the soundtrack, terming it an "extremely underwhelming album". He disapproved of the change from the medieval instrumentation to a more orchestral score, and felt that the pieces had much less emotional intensity than the "Crystal Chronicles" soundtrack.
"Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Echoes of Time Original Soundtrack".

Track listing
Singles.
Kaze no Ne.
Patrick Gann of RPGFan called "Kaze no Ne" one of the few singles he had purchased that was "worth holding onto". He described all of the tracks as "beautiful", and felt that the arranged version of "Sound of the Wind" was "charming and enigmatic". Dave of Square Enix Music Online concurred, calling the single "a potentially excellent addition to anyone's discography". He described Yae's voice as "angelic" "mature" and "fresh" and summed up the album as "a definitive Yae experience accessible to game music fans".
Hoshi no Nai Sekai / Yokogao.
"Hoshi no Nai Sekai"/"Yokogao" is double A-side containing the theme song to "" , as well as two original tracks, and , and instrumental versions of "A World Without Stars" and "Profile". The single is performed by Aiko. All of the songs are primarily focused on the vocals along with piano and electric guitar accompaniments.

The album was released on August 22, 2007 by Pony Canyon, covers a duration of 24:40, and has the catalog number PCCA-02546.
Neal Chandran approved of "Hoshi no Nai Sekai" / "Yokogao", finding it to be enjoyable despite its short length. He felt that "A World Without Stars" was a "terrific piece, and that the other two songs, while "not as strong", were "still decent tracks that were easy on the ears", and approved of the instrumental versions included in the single. Don also appreciated the soundtrack, calling it "a nice choice" and saying that it "complements a rather weak original soundtrack". He felt that the balance in the songs between the piano and electric guitar was well done.
Legacy.
Unlike the soundtracks to the numbered "Final Fantasy" games, no songs from the "Crystal Chronicles" soundtracks have appeared in any compilation albums produced by Square Enix. Songs from the series have also not appeared in any of the official "Final Fantasy" music concerts, although "Morning Sky" from the "Crystal Chronicles" soundtrack was played in the first Games in Concert performance in Utrecht, Netherlands on November 26, 2006. It was performed by Floor Jansen of the band After Forever and the Metropole Orchestra.

Project DELTA

Project DELTA was one of three Greek letter special forces reconnaissance projects formed by the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, MACV during the Vietnam War to collect operational intelligence in remote areas of South Vietnam.
Project DELTA was established at Nha Trang in 1964 and consisted of six reconnaissance hunter-killer teams each composed of four United States Special Forces (USSF) and six to eight Vietnamese special forces (LLDB) with the 91st Ranger battalion. It was designated Detachment B-52, 5th Special Forces Group.
Mission.
DELTA's mission include operational and strategic reconnaissance into long held Vietcong areas and direct air strikes on them, they were also to conduct bomb damage assessment, conduct small scale reconnaissance and hunter-killer operations, capture and interrogate VC / NVA, tap communications, bug compounds and offices, rescue downed aircrew and prisoners of war, emplace point minefields and other booby traps, conduct psychological operations, and perform counter intelligence operations. They were to focus on base areas and infiltration routes in the border areas.
History.
DELTA originated as Project LEAPING LENA which was established on 15 May 1964 in order for the USSF to train LLDB teams for missions into Laos. The result of this was that five teams of eight men were parachuted into Laos and only five men survived the experience. The US did not participate. On 12 July 1964 a US Special Forces B-Team (B-110) and an A-Team (A-111) from the US 1st Special Forces Group arrived to take over the mission. By October 1964 Project LEAPING LENA was redesignated Project DELTA with USSF in control and serving alongside LLDB in actual operations. The main base was established at Nha Trang and half of the A-team at Dong Ba Thin to train the 91st Ranger Battalion.
DELTA ceased operations on 30 June 1970.
Organization.
By 1966 DELTA consisted of the following:
MIKE Forces were battalion and then brigade size reaction forces assigned aid in case of hostile action but also by conducting economy of force operations. Project DELTA's MIKE Force was the 91st Ranger battalion.
Project Delta aviation support was provided by the 281st Assault Helicopter Company (10th Combat Aviation Battalion, 17th Aviation Group (Combat), 1st Aviation Brigade), which was placed under operational control of the 5th Special Forces Group in direct support of Project Delta operations. The 281st AHC provided dedicated helicopter support from its arrival in Vietnam, 9 June 1966, until Project Delta was deactivated in June 1970. The 281st AHC "Intruders" are credited with developing special operations aviation tactics, as well as being the original special ops aviation unit. Forward air control support was originally supplied by pilots from the 19th Tactical Air Support Squadron; later the 21st Tactical Air Support Squadron assumed the mission.

Maximilian Daublebsky von Sterneck

Maximilian Daublebsky Freiherr von Sterneck zu Ehrenstein (14 February 1829 - 5 December 1897) was an Austrian admiral who served as the chief administrator of the Austro-Hungarian Navy from 1883 until his death.
Biography.
He was born at Klagenfurt, into a family from Bohemia where they long held the office of mayor of Budweis. In 1620 they were ennobled in Austria with the addition of the German name "von Sterneck". Jacob Daublebsky von Sterneck was further created "Freiherr" (Baron) "von Sterneck zu Ehrenstein" in 1792. His son Joseph settled in Carinthia and purchased the castle of Krastowitz in Klagenfurt, where his son Maximilian was born in 1829.
Maximilian Daublebsky von Sterneck was educated to be an officer in the then Austrian Navy,
attaining the rank of lieutenant commander ("Korvettenkapitän") in 1859. He was promoted to commander ("Fregattenkapitän") in 1864 and later was appointed to command the flagship "Erzherzog Ferdinand Max" by rear-admiral ("Konteradmiral") Wilhelm von Tegetthoff.
In the Battle of Lissa (20 July 1866), Daublebsky von Sterneck succeeded in by ramming the Italian flagship "Re d'Italia", which capsized and sank. For his services during the battle, he was awarded the Military Order of Maria Theresa. In an 1880 painting by Anton Romako, Daublebsky is pictured at Tegetthoff's side on the bridge during the ramming attack ("Rammstosstaktik").
The creation of the Dual Monarchy in 1867 was accompanied by the reorganization of the naval service as the Austro-Hungarian Navy. Daublebsky von Sterneck was appointed port commander at Pola in 1869 with the rank of full captain ("Linienschiffskapitän." He was promoted to "Kontradmiral" in 1872 and took part in the 1872-74 North Polar expedition of Julius von Payer and Karl Weyprecht as commander of the "Isbjörn." It was this expedition that discovered Franz Josef Land, named for the Austrian emperor, in 1873.
Daublebsky von Sterneck was named to succeed Friedrich von Pöck as "Marinekommandant" (Navy Commander) and "Chef der Marinesektion" (Chief of the Naval Section of the War Ministry) in November 1883 with the rank of "Vizeadmiral". His efforts to modernize the Navy were hamstrung by interminable political friction between the Austrian and Hungarian halves of the empire. When Sir Edward J. Reed published the second half of his profile of the Continental navies in "Harper's" in February 1887, he dismissed the Austro-Hungarian Navy as antiquated and omitted any tabulation of information about the fleet's ships—in sharp contrast to his description of the fleet of Austria-Hungary's principal ally, Germany.
Promoted full Admiral in 1888, Daublebsky von Sterneck persevered in his efforts to modernize the Austro-Hungarian fleet until his death in Vienna in 1897. He initiated the construction - 1891–1898 - of the navy garrison Catholic "Church of Our Lady of the Sea" (//) in Pola's suburb San Policarpo. His body was interred in that church, to which Daublebsky von Sterneck had devoted much effort. His heart however was placed in the family crypt in the castle of Krastowitz. Daublebsky von Sterneck was succeeded as head of the navy by Hermann von Spaun.
