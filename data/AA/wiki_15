Robert McClellan (New York treasurer)

Robert McClellan (January 1747 County Londonderry, Ireland – October 8, 1817 Albany, Albany County, New York) was an Irish-born American merchant and politician.
Life.
He was a son of Michael McClellan (d. ca. 1757) and Jane Henry McClellan. The family came to New England when Robert was still a child. His older brother took him to Albany, New York where he became a merchant. In 1771, Robert married Jane Williams in Albany, and they had nine children. 
At the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War in 1775, he supported the revolutionary cause financially. In 1776, he became a member of the Albany Committee of Correspondence. 
Beginning in 1780, he was elected to the Albany City Council, first as assistant, then as alderman. In 1798, he was appointed New York State Treasurer, a post he held until his resignation on January 31, 1803, after the discovery of a shortage of $33,000 in the Treasury accounts.

Continuous reactor

Continuous reactors (alternatively referred to as flow reactors) carry material as a flowing stream. Reactants are continuously fed into the reactor and emerge as continuous stream of product. Continuous reactors are used for a wide variety of chemical and biological processes within the food, chemical and pharmaceutical industries. A survey of the continuous reactor market will throw up a daunting variety of shapes and types of machine. Beneath this variation however lies a relatively small number of key design features which determine the capabilities of the reactor. When classifying continuous reactors, it can be more helpful to look at these design features rather than the whole system.
Batch versus continuous.
Reactors can be divided into two broad categories, batch reactors and continuous reactors. Batch reactors are stirred tanks sufficiently large to handle the full inventory of a complete batch cycle. In some cases, batch reactors may be operated in semi batch mode where one chemical is charged to the vessel and a second chemical is added slowly. Continuous reactors are generally smaller than batch reactors and handle the product as a flowing stream. Continuous reactors may be designed as pipes with or without baffles or a series of interconnected stages. The advantages of the two options are considered below.
Heat transfer capacity.
The rate of heat transfer within a reactor can be determined from the following relationship:
qx = U.A.– Tj
Where qx = the heat liberated or absorbed by the process (W)
U = the heat transfer coefficient of the heat exchanger (W.m-2.K-1)
A = the heat transfer area (m2)
Tp = process temperature (K)
Tj = jacket temperature (K)
From a reactor design perspective, heat transfer capacity is heavily influenced by channel size since this determines the heat transfer area per unit volume. Channel size can be categorised in various ways however in broadest terms, the categories are as follows:
Industrial batch reactors : 1 – 10 m2/m3 (depending on reactor capacity)
Laboratory batch reactors : 10 – 100 m2/m3 (depending on reactor capacity)
Continuous reactors (non micro) : 100 - 5,000 m2/m3 (depending on channel size)
Micro reactors : 5,000 - 50,000 m2/m3 (depending on channel size)
Small diameter channels have the advantage of high heat transfer capacity. Against this however they have lower flow capacity, higher pressure drop and an increased tendency to block. In many cases, the physical structure and fabrication techniques for micro reactors make cleaning and unblocking very difficult to achieve.
Temperature control.
Temperature control is one of key functions of a chemical reactor. Poor temperature control can severely affect both yield and product quality. It can also lead to boiling or freezing within the reactor which may stop the reactor from working altogether. In extreme cases, poor temperature control can lead to severe over pressure which can be destructive on the equipment and potentially dangerous.
Single stage systems with high heating or cooling flux.
In a batch reactor, good temperature control is achieved when the heat added or removed by the heat exchange surface (qx) equals the heat generated or absorbed by the process material (qp). For flowing reactors made up of tubes or plates, satisfying the relationship qx = qp does not deliver good temperature control since the rate of process heat liberation/absorption varies at different points within the reactor. Controlling the outlet temperature does not prevent hot/cold spots within the reactor. Hot or cold spots caused by exothermic or endothermic activity can be eliminated by relocating the temperature sensor (T) to the point where the hot/cold spots exists. This however leads to overheating or overcooling downstream of the temperature sensor.
Many different types of plate or tube reactors use simple feed back control of the product temperature. From a user’s perspective, this approach is only suitable for processes where the effects of hot/cold spots do not compromise safety, quality or yield.
Single stage systems with low heating or cooling flux.
Micro reactors can be tube or plates and have the key feature of small diameter flow channels (typically less than <1 mm). The significance of micro reactors is that the heat transfer area (A) per unit volume (of product) is very large. A large heat transfer area means that high values of qx can be achieved with low values of Tp – Tj. The low value of Tp – Tj limits the extent of over cooling that can occur. Thus the product temperature can be controlled by regulating the temperature of the heat transfer fluid (or the product).
The feedback signal for controlling the process temperature can be the product temperature or the heat transfer fluid temperature. It is often more practical to control the temperature of the heat transfer fluid.
Although micro reactors are efficient heat transfer devices, the narrow channels can result in high pressure drops, limited flow capacity and a tendency to block. They are also often fabricated in a manner which makes cleaning and dismantling difficult or impossible.
Multistage systems with high heating or cooling flux.
Conditions within a continuous reactor change as the product passes along the flow channel. In an ideal reactor the design of the flow channel is optimised to cope with this change. In practice, this is achieved by breaking the reactor into a series of stages. Within each stage the ideal heat transfer conditions can be achieved by varying the surface to volume ratio or the cooling/heating flux. Thus stages where process heat output is very high either use extreme heat transfer fluid temperatures or have high surface to volume ratios (or both). By tackling the problem as a series of stages, extreme cooling/heating conditions to be employed at the hot/cold spots without suffering overheating or overcooling elsewhere. The significance of this is that larger flow channels can be used. Larger flow channels are generally desirable as they permit higher rate, lower pressure drop and a reduced tendency to block.
Mixing.
Mixing is another important classifying feature for continuous reactors. Good mixing improves the efficiency of heat and mass transfer.
In terms of trajectory through the reactor, the ideal flow condition for a continuous reactor is plug flow (since this delivers uniform residence time within the reactor). There is however a measure of conflict between good mixing and plug flow since mixing generates axial as well as radial movement of the fluid. In tube type reactors (with or without static mixing), adequate mixing can be achieved without seriously compromising plug flow. For this reason, these types of reactor are sometimes referred to as plug flow reactors.
Continuous reactors can be classified in terms of the mixing mechanism as follows:
Mixing by diffusion.
Diffusion mixing relies on concentration or temperature gradients within the product. This approach is common with micro reactors where the channel thicknesses are very small and heat can be transmitted to and from the heat transfer surface by conduction. In larger channels and for some types of reaction mixture (especially immiscible fluids), mixing by diffusion is not practical.
Mixing with the product transfer pump.
In a continuous reactor, the product is continuously pumped through the reactor. This pump can also be used to promote mixing. If the fluid velocity is sufficiently high, turbulent flow conditions exist (which promotes mixing). The disadvantage with this approach is that it leads to long reactors with high pressure drops and high minimum flow rates. This is particularly true where the reaction is slow or the product has high viscosity.
This problem can be reduced with the use of static mixers. Static mixers are baffles in the flow channel which are used to promote mixing. They are able to work with or without turbulent conditions. Static mixers can be effective but still require relatively long flow channels and generate relatively high pressure drops.
The oscillatory baffled reactor is specialised form of static mixer where the direction of process flow is cycled. This permits static mixing with low net flow through the reactor. This has the benefit of allowing the reactor to be kept comparatively short.
Mixing with a mechanical agitator.
Some continuous reactors use mechanical agitation for mixing (rather than the product transfer pump). Whilst this adds complexity to the reactor design, it offers significant advantages in terms of versatility and performance. With independent agitation, efficient mixing can be maintained irrespective of product throughput or viscosity. It also eliminates the need for long flow channels and high pressure drops.
One less desirable feature associated with mechanical agitators is the strong axial mixing they generate. This problem can be managed by breaking up the reactor into a series of mixed stages separated by small plug flow channels.
The most familiar form of continuous reactor of this type is the continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR). This is essentially a batch reactor used in a continuous flow.
The disadvantage with a single stage CSTR is that it can be relatively wasteful on product during start up and shutdown. The reactants are also added to a mixture which is rich in product. For some types of process, this can have an impact on quality and yield. These problems are managed by using multi stage CSTRs. At the large scale, conventional batch reactors can be used for the CSTR stages.

Peroration

In classical rhetoric, a peroration was the final part of a speech. It was one of the four or five traditional components in the dispositio of a speech.
The peroration had two main purposes: to remind the audience of the main points of the speech ("recapitulatio") and to influence their emotions ("affectus"). The role of the peroration was defined by Greek writers on rhetoric, who called it "epilogos"; but it is most often associated with Roman orators, who made frequent use of emotional appeals. A famous example was the speech of Marcus Antonius Orator in defence of Aquillius, during which Antonius tore open the tunic of Aquillius to reveal his battle scars.
In the first century B.C. it was common for two or more speakers to appear on each side in major court cases. In such cases it was considered a mark of honour to be asked to deliver the peroration.

José da Costa e Silva

José da Costa e Silva (1747–1819) was a Portuguese architect. His work helped establish Neoclassical architecture in Portugal and colonial Brazil.
Costa e Silva studied architecture in Rome, where he had contact with Italian Neoclassicism. He later became Royal architect, and headed several important projects in Portugal. Among his most important works are the Royal Theatre of São Carlos (1792) in Lisbon and the Military Hospital (1792) near Torres Vedras. He is also believed to be the author of Seteais Palace (1801) in Sintra. In Lisbon, Costa e Silva and the Italian Francisco Xavier Fabri created the project for the Royal Palace of Ajuda (after 1802), which was however too grandiose and could not be completed.
In 1807, Costa e Silva went to Brazil together with John VI and the Portuguese court, which had to escape the invasion of Portugal by Napoleonic troops. In Rio de Janeiro, which became capital of the Portuguese Empire, Costa e Silva designed an opera house in Neoclassical style. This opera house, called Royal Theatre of St John and modelled after the São Carlos of Lisbon, was one of the first Neoclassical buildings in Brazilian soil. It was later destroyed in a fire.

George Krauss

Georg Ritter von Krauss (25 December 1826 – 5 November 1906) was a German industrialist and the founder of the Krauss Locomotive Works ("Locomotivfabrik Krauß & Comp.") in Munich, Germany and Linz, Upper Austria. He changed the spelling of his name from "Krauß" to "Krauss", later on once the form of his name in capital letters on the company's emblems had become established.
Early Beginnings.
Krauss was born in Augsburg as the eldest child of four, to the master weaver, Johann George Friedrich Krauss and his wife Anna Margarethe, née Stahl. After attending primary school, he went to the Royal Polytechnic School, founded in 1833 (today Augsburg High School). After completing his education he worked temporarily in the Maffei Locomotive Works in Munich, then for the Royal Bavarian State Railways ("Königlich Bayerische Staatsbahn") in Hof, Germany, Kempten and Lindau. A decisive step in his development was his job as a master machinist with the Northeast Railway ("Nordostbahn") in Zurich, where he built his first four locomotives. From then on he was already preparing for the founding of his factory in Munich. In spite of strong opposition from the already established Joseph Anton von Maffei he obtained the necessary capital to found the factory on the Marsfeld in Munich-Neuhausen on 17 July 1866, a satellite factory at Munich South station in 1872 and another works in 1880 in Linz (Austria) in order to avoid the high import taxes of the Danube monarchy.
Further Successes.
But Krauss was not just a successful locomotive manufacturer, but also supported other technological developments, like the first refrigerators by Linde. He took part in the expansion of railway lines in the Saxony, Thuringia and Alsace, in the conversion of the horse-drawn tramways to steam operations in Munich and Vienna, the building of the Chiemsee Railway and the establishment of the Lokalbahn AG. In addition in 1876 he was one of the founders of the present day Institute of German Engineers, the VDI, ("Verein Deutscher Ingenieure") and in 1903 generously supported the creation of the Deutsches Museum with 100,000 marks and the repurchase of his first lokomotive "Landwührden".
Twists of Fate.
In 1876 his first wife Lydia died and so too did his only son, Conrad, after an accident in 1885, whereupon Krauss converted his firm into public limited company and drew back from active business leadership. He remained chairman of the board until his death, however.
Honours.
As early as 1880 he was awarded the Knight's Cross 1st Class of the Grand Duchy of Saxony-Weimar, as well as the title of Royal Bavarian Industrialist ("Königlich bayerischer Kommerzienrat") from King Ludwig II of Bavaria for his services. In 1903 followed the Order of Merit of Holy Michael 3rd Class, and with the conferral of the Knights Cross of the Royal Order of Merit of the Bavarian Crown he rose on 6 March 1905 to ranks of the nobility. The Technical University of Munich awarded him the title of Doctor of Engineering honoris causa and the VDI gave him the Grashof commemorative coin.
A Life with Foresight.
In 1905 Krauss decided to move the location of the factory from the crowded town centre out to Allach, from where its successor organisation still operates today. Sadly he did not live to see either the completion of the Deutsches Museum or the move to Allach. On 5 November 1906 the manufacturer George von Krauss died shortly before his 80th birthday in Munich. His friend and one of his first co-workers, Carl von Linde, took over the chair of the board. His factory made 7,186 locomotives from 1866 until its merger with the bankrupt Maffei locomotive works in 1931.

Walking Brooklyn

Walking Brooklyn: "30 Tours Exploring Historical Legacies, Neighborhood Culture, Side Streets, and Waterways" is a book by Adrienne Onofri. It was published in June 2007 by Wilderness Press as one of the first titles in their urban trekking series.
"Walking Brooklyn" consists of 30 chapters, each providing a walking tour of a Brooklyn area. As described by the "Brooklyn Daily Eagle": "Each walk begins with a map of the area with the appropriate route highlighted, a summary of boundaries, approximate distance of the route and the closest subway stop to begin at, followed by a brief historical introduction to the area. The actual street-by-street (sometimes step-by-step) route guide is then provided in bullet form. The walks are each concluded with a summary of the points of interests described as well as a MapQuest-like route summary."
"The New York Times" wrote: "A book about Brooklyn published by the Wilderness Press? Turns out it’s a wonderful idea. ...a charming, practical and informative guide to seeing the familiar and undiscovered features of the borough on foot." The "Daily News" said the book "tells you what’s worth seeing or sampling in each neighborhood and how best to navigate it and where to eat while uncovering historical and cultural nuggets many natives never knew."

Taiyuan Massacre

The Taiyuan Massacre was one of the more bloody and infamous parts of the Boxer Rebellion. It took place on July 9, 1900, in Taiyuan, Shanxi province, North China, when the governor of Shanxi named Yuxian (Pinyin), or Yu-Hsien (Wade–Giles), ordered the killings of 45 Christian missionaries and of local church members, including children.
The Massacre.
Quotations and Other References.
From China and the Allies Volume 1, by Arnold Henry Savage Landor, p. 265-268. The report stats that Yu-Hsien, the Governor of Shanxi, had a bitter hatred of foreigners and was swift to follow the Empress's orders and to instruct the ford of the Yellow River to be closely guarded least any escape:
The report concludes that Mr and Mrs Piggott, for whom a £5000 reward had been offered were presumed killed in July. Mr and Mrs Hay (mistakenly captured as the Piggotts) escaped to Hankow on 13 February 1901 with Mr M'Kie, Miss Chapman and Miss May.

The BMS website bmsworldmission.org has transcriptions of telegrams sent at the time which detail those who died in Taiyuan.
One of the most prominent murdered Catholics was Italian bishop Gregory Grassi (born 1833), canonised a Saint by Pope John Paul II on 1 October 2000. His companions of martrydom were four other Franciscan friars, seven Franciscan Missionaries of Mary, 11 Chinese members of the Third Order of St. Francis- of whom six were seminarians- and three Chinese employees of the franciscan mission of Taiyuan in the Apostolic Vicariate of Northern Shansi. They all belong to the 120 Martyrs of China that were canonized by Pope John Paul II on 1 October 2000.

Reparations.
About three months later than the Memorial Services at Pao-ting-fu which have just been referred to, a party of eight missionaries started for the province of Shan-si. Their names are Dr. E. H. Edwards of the Sheo-yang Mission, Rev. Moir Duncan, and Dr. Creasy Smith of the B.M.S., Dr Atwood of the American Board, and Messrs. D. E. Hoste, A. Orr-Ewing, C. H. Tjader, and Ernest Taylor of the C.I.M. In response to the invitation of the new Governor, Ts en-ch un-hsiien, the party of eight missionaries, under an escort provided by the Governor, started from Pao-ting-fu on Wednesday, June 26, reaching T ai-yiian-fu transcription of Taiyuan-fu, the capital of the Shanxi province on July 9 the first anniversary of the awful massacre in that very city. The following extract from the diary of one of this party describes their reception : 
July 9. Reached T ai-yiian-fu. Twelve months ago to-day forty-five European and American missionaries and others were slaughtered by order of the Governor. The scene to-day was a strange contrast. Thirty miles off, outriders inquired as to the time of our arrival. Ten miles off, the Governor s body guard blared out their welcome and unfurled their standards. Two miles nearer, the Shan-si mounted police made salute. Three miles from the city, we exchanged our litters for Pekin carts to facilitate our reception. A large and representative body of Christians seemed delighted to welcome us. Their faces bore clear traces of the sufferings endured. From this point the procession rapidly increased, as we proceeded between rows of officials, both military and civil. At the entrance to the pavilion stood an Imperial officer, who stepped forward and said, "I welcome you in the name of the Emperor of China."

Indemnity funds.
The Shansi Imperial University at Taiyuan was founded in 1901 with funds from the indemnity levied against Shansi for the massacre of the Christians by the Boxers. During the first decade of the university its chancellor was the Baptist missionary Timothy Richard who also headed the Western College.

Bogislaw X, Duke of Pomerania

Bogislaw X of Pomerania, "the Great", (June 3, 1454 – October 5, 1523) was Duke of Pomerania from 1474 until his death in 1523.
Bogislaw was born in Rügenwalde (now Darłowo, Poland) into the House of Pomerania (Griffins). His father was Eric II, Duke of Pomerania-Wolgast, his mother was the duchess Sophia of Pomerania, both distant relatives of the House of Pomerania. Bogislaw was first married to Margaret of Brandenburg and later to Anna Jagiellon, daughter of Casimir IV Jagiellon, King of Poland. With his second wife he had eight children, including Sophia of Pomerania, who became queen of Denmark. He inherited all of the previously partitioned Duchy of Pomerania and became her sole ruler in 1478. He was succeeded by his sons George I and Barnim XI.
Before Bogislaw's reign, the Duchy of Pomerania had for a long time been divided into several splinter duchies, ruled by relatives of the Griffin house. In 1464, Pomerania-Stettin's duke Otto III died without an heir, Bogislaw's father Eric II and his uncle, Wartislaw X, both ruling different portions of Pomerania-Wolgast, managed to succeed in a conflict about Pomerania-Stettin inheritance with the Margraviate of Brandenburg. In 1474, with his father's death, Bogislaw inherited his splinter duchy, becoming Duke of Pomerania. In 1478 with his uncle's death, he inherited his splinter duchy, too, becoming the first sole ruler in the Duchy of Pomerania since about 200 years.
His father, Eric II, had left Pomerania in tense conflicts with Brandenburg and Mecklenburg. Bogislaw managed to resolve these conflicts by both diplomatic and military means. He married his sister, Sophia, to Magnus, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and his other sister, Magarete, was married to Magnus' brother Balthasar. Bogislaw himself married Magarete, daughter of Brandenburg's Prince-elector Frederick II. Also, in 1478, Bogislaw regained areas lost to Brandenburg by his father, most notably the town of Gartz and other small towns and castles north of the Brandenburgian Uckermark. He confirmed the 1472 Peace of Prenzlau in 1479, leaving Strasburg with Brandenburg and Bogislaw had to take his possessions as a fief from Brandenburg. In the same year, his wife died before they had children.
When Bogislaw married Anna of Poland in 1491, all of Pomerania's neighbors were tied to the House of Pomerania by marriage. Bogislaw made use of these favourable conditions in 1493, and strengthened Pomerania's position towards Brandenburg in the Treaty of Pyritz, which declared Pomerania not a fief of Brandenburg, but a fief of the Holy Roman Emperor.
In 1496-98, Bogislaw travelled to Jerusalem as a pilgrim. He died in Stettin.

Ohan Durian

Ohan Durian or Duryan () (September 8, 1922, Jerusalem – January 6, 2011, Yerevan) was a well-known Armenian conductor and composer.
Life and career.
Ohan Durian was born Hanna Khatchadurian in Jerusalem. From 1939 to 1945 he studied composition, conducting and organ at the Jerusalem Conservatory. He completed his education in Europe under the tutelage of Hermann Scherchen, Roger Désormière and Jean Martinon.
After graduating, he toured Europe, performing with several orchestras, and worked as a music teacher at Birzeit University between 1944 and 1946. In 1957 he settled in Armenia at the invitation of Catholicos Vazgen I, and in 1959-65 and 1972-1974 he was conductor of the Armenian State Philharmonic Society. 
Due to Soviet restrictions on artistic expression, he left Armenia for Europe, and from 1963-1968 he served as Music Director of the Leipzig Opera and was Guest Conductor of the Gewandhaus Orchestra. He also worked with other orchestras including the Avignon and Cape Town orchestras. From 1971 to 1972 he was the conductor of Yerevan State Opera and Ballet Theater and finally left Soviet Armenia in 1975. 
In the early 1990s Armenia gained independence, and in 1991 Dourian returned to serve as the Artistic Director and Principal Conductor of the Ohan Durian Radio & TV Symphony Orchestra, which he founded, and as Principal Conductor and Artistic Director of the Yerevan Opera Theatre. He was forced into retirement in Armenia, but from 2002-2006 he directed the Moscow Symphonic Orchestra at the Stas Namin Center. Durian invented a musical system which he called Universalism and composed a number of songs and works for orchestra.
Durian married Alice Shahmiryan. He was awarded the title of People’s Artist of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic (1967) and the State Award of the ASSR. In later years, he was a vocal critic of the Armenian government, and appeared at opposition rallys calling for the resignation of the regimes of Robert Kocharian and Serj Sarkisian. He died in Yerevan and was buried at the Komitas Pantheon in Yerevan.
Works.
Selected compositions include:
In many instances Duran was the first conductor to perform symphonic works by Armenian composers. Numerous recordings of Maestro Durian have been made during his career.

The Towers (Manchester)

The Towers (later known as the Shirley Institute, and then the BTTG) is a research establishment for new technologies in cotton production. The Shirley Institute was established in 1920 at a cost of £10,000 to accommodate the newly formed "British Cotton Industry Research Association". It is a Grade II* listed building in the suburb of Didsbury, located miles south of Manchester, England.
History.
The building was constructed in the period 1868–72, for an estimated cost of £50,000. The house was designed by Thomas Worthington, for the editor and proprietor of the "Manchester Guardian", John Edward Taylor. The building was described by Pevsner as "grossly picturesque in red brick and red terra cotta."
Manchester Ship Canal.
The Towers was once the home of the notable engineer Daniel Adamson – whose idea for the canalisation of the Rivers Irwell and Mersey resulted in the creation of the Manchester Ship Canal project which made the rivers into Manchester navigable for sea-going ships.
He invited representatives of several Lancashire towns, local businessmen and politicians, and two civil engineers, Hamilton Fulton and Edward Leader Williams. Fulton proposed a tidal canal, with no locks and a deepened channel into Manchester; Williams was in favour of a series of locks. Both engineers were invited to submit proposals, and Williams' plans were selected to form the basis of a bill submitted to Parliament in November 1882. Because of intense opposition by Liverpool and the railway companies, the necessary enabling Act of Parliament was not passed until 6 August 1885. Certain conditions were attached: £5 million had to be raised, and the ship canal company had to buy both the Bridgewater Canal and the Mersey & Irwell Navigation within two years.
Shirley Institute.
In 1920 it became the base of the Shirley Institute of the British Cotton Industry Research Association as a research centre dedicated to cotton production technologies.
A significant contribution to the purchase price of £10,000 was made by William Greenwood, the MP for Stockport, who asked that the building be named after his daughter, Shirley.

J.G. Wentworth

J.G. Wentworth is a financial services firm that specializes in purchasing structured settlements and annuities from individuals. The company is owned by private equity firm JLL Partners.
In the United States the company is most commonly known for its advertising commercials that feature "Mr. Wentworth", but more recent commercials include a Wagnerian Opera singer. 
The tagline featured in the commercials is ""It's your money, use it when you need it!""
History.
Founded in 1991, J.G. Wentworth started as a merchant bank handling transactions in the healthcare industry. In 1992 the company began to purchase New Jersey's auto insurance deferrals from claimants who could not afford to wait 12 to 18 months for their settlements.
By the late 1990s, JGW began to focus on the structured settlement and annuity business. JGW has issued 34 securitizations, which are backed by both structured settlements and annuities receivables totaling over US $2.3 billion. In July of 2012, the company completed $169.5 million securitization of notes that were backed by structured settlement and fixed annuity payments. The earliest securitization of 2012 was in March, for US $244 million with Class A notes rated Aaa by Moody's and AAA by DBRS. Since 1992 JGW has purchased US $4 billion in future payment obligations from consumers. As of November 2010, the company has completed a US $212 million securitization consisting of two classes of notes: Class A notes rated Aaa and Class B notes rated A2 by Moody's Investors Service, in addition to a Residual Class of US $14.8 million retained by the Company.
Prior to 1999 there was no state regulation for structured settlements in the state of New York. Elliot Spitzer entered into a contract with J.G. Wentworth to help protect New Yorkers from selling their settlements at exorbitant rates. The agreement stipulated that J.G. Wentworth could receive a rate of no more than 25 percent of the annual discount rate of annuities it had purchased from a citizen of the state of New York. At the time, a JGW executive told the New York Times that the firm sought the agreement because of the rate at which its business had grown in recent years.
Commercials and awards.
The commercials that run on daytime television in the United States featuring "Mr. Wentworth" are how the company is best known. They have had many series of commercials with Mr. Wentworth, however the most recent series includes a Wagnerian Opera singer, also known as the Viking singer. The tagline featured in the commercials is ""It's my money and I need it now!"", and ""It's your money, use it when you need it!""
JGW has won several awards both domestically and internationally for their television advertising, including a silver Davey award. The commercials feature a singing "Opera" star who recites in a deep voice ""if you get long-term payments and you need cash now!"". The "Wagnerian Opera" commercial won two International Summit Awards for Best Humor and Best TV between US $75k and US $100k.
Reorganization.
During the financial crisis of 2009, the firm known as JGW Holdco LLC and two of its subsidiaries, J.G. Wentworth LLC and J.G. Wentworth Inc., entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after the company "encountered liquidity problems amid a tightening credit market". 
Less than six months later, parent company JLL Partners of New York invested $100 million in the firm. Subsequently, J.G. Wentworth began hiring new staff at corporate headquarters located in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. Since the crisis, JGW has since increased staff to 178 employees.

Tegafur

Tegafur (INN, BAN, USAN) is a chemotherapeutic fluorouracil prodrug used in the treatment of cancers. It is a component of the combination drug tegafur/uracil. When metabolised, it becomes 5-fluorouracil.
Medical uses.
As a prodrug to 5-FU it is used in the treatment of the following cancers:
It is often given in combination with drugs that alter its bioavailability and toxicity such as gimeracil, oteracil or uracil. These agents achieve this by inhibiting the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (uracil/gimeracil) or orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (oteracil). 
Adverse effects.
The major side effects of tegafur are similar to fluorouracil and include myelosuppression, central neurotoxicity and gastrointestinal toxicity (especially diarrhoea). Gastrointestinal toxicity is the dose-limiting side effect of tegafur. Central neurotoxicity is more common with tegafur than with fluorouracil. 
Mechanism of action.
It is a prodrug to fluorouracil which is a thymidylate synthase inhibitor. 
Pharmacokinetics.
It is metabolised into fluorouracil by CYP2A6.

Havalina Rail Co. is the first studio album by the American eclectic rock band Havalina Rail Co., released 1994. 
In an interview for KPSU, Wignall commented that the first album was "this sort of finding our path and gravitating towards American sounds". The album featured folk, swing, jazz, zydeco, and rock influences; according to Matt Wignall, the swing influence led many to falsely assume that the band was part of the contemporary Swing revival.

The Seversky SEV-3 was an American three-seat amphibian monoplane, the first aircraft designed and built by the Seversky Aircraft Corporation.
Design and development.
The SEV-3 was an all-metal cantilever low-wing monoplane powered by a nose-mounted 420 hp (313 kW) Wright J-6 Whirlwind radial engine. It had two cockpits in tandem, forward for the pilot and the rear cockpit for two passengers, both with a sliding canopies. It could either be fitted with twin amphibious floats which had main wheels fitted in the floats to allow it to operate from land or with a fixed tailwheel undercarriage with the mainwheels enclosed in large fairings. 
The SEV-3 first flew as a floatplane in June 1933 demonstrating excellent performance as both an amphibian and a landplane. It was built in small numbers mainly for export.
Operational history.
An SEV-3 established a world speed record for a piston-engined amphibians in 1933 and on 15 September 1935 a Wright Cyclone powered SEV-3 set a record of 230 mph (370.8 km/h) which stood for 49 years. A landplane version was also developed with a conventional landing gear.
The design influenced a long-line of Seversky then Republic aircraft leading to the P-47 Thunderbolt. A landplane version was used by the United States Army Air Corps as a basic trainer with the designation BT-8.

Broadway Theater District (Los Angeles)

The Broadway Theater District in Downtown Los Angeles is the first and largest historic theater district listed on the National Register of Historic Places. With twelve movie palaces located along a six-block stretch of Broadway, it is the only large concentration of movie palaces left in the United States.
Highest concentration of movie palaces in the world.
Stretching for six blocks from Third to Ninth Streets along South Broadway in Downtown Los Angeles, the district includes 12 movie theaters built between 1910 and 1931. By 1931, the district had the highest concentration of cinemas in the world, with seating capacity for more than 15,000 patrons. Broadway was the hub of L.A.'s entertainment scene – a place where "screen goddesses and guys in fedoras rubbed elbows with Army nurses and aircraft pioneers." In 2006, the "Los Angeles Times" wrote:"There was a time, long ago, when the streets of downtown Los Angeles were awash in neon—thanks to a confluence of movie theaters the world had never seen before. Dozens of theaters screened Hollywood's latest fare, played host to star-studded premieres and were filled nightly with thousands of moviegoers. In those days, before World War II, downtown L.A. was the movie capital of the world."
Columnist Jack Smith called it "the only large concentration of vintage movie theaters left in America." Smith recalled growing up a mile from Broadway and spending his Saturdays in the theaters:"I remember walking into those opulent interiors, surrounded by the glory of the Renaissance, or the age of Baroque, and spending two or three hours in the dream world of the movies. When I came out again the sky blazed; the heat bounced off the sidewalk, traffic sounds filled the street, I was back in the hard reality of the Depression.
Revitalization by Spanish-language cinema.
In the years after World War II, the district began to decline, as first-run movie-goers shifted to the movie palaces in Hollywood, in Westwood Village, and later to suburban multiplexes. After World War II, as Anglo moviegoers moved to the suburbs, many of the Broadway movie palaces became venues for Spanish-language movies and variety shows. In 1988, the "Los Angeles Times" noted that, without the Hispanic community, "Broadway would be dead." Jack Smith wrote that Broadway had been "rescued and revitalized" by "the Latino renaissance."
Preservation and renovation efforts.
The district has been the subject of preservation and restoration efforts since the 1980s. In 1987, the Los Angeles Conservancy started a program called "Last Remaining Seats" in which the old movie palaces were opened each summer to show classic Hollywood movies. In 1994, the Conservancy's associate director, Gregg Davidson, noted: "When we started this, the naysayers said no one will go downtown to an old theater to see an old movie in the middle of the summer, but we get a number of people who have never seen a movie in a theater with a balcony. The older people (go) for nostalgia. And the movie people—seeing a classic film on a big screen is a different experience." After attending a Conservancy screening, one writer noted: "The other night I went to the movies and was transported to a world of powdered wigs and hoop skirts, a rococo fantasy of gilded cherubs and crystal chandeliers. And then the film started."
Despite preservation efforts, many of the theaters have been converted to other uses, including flea markets and churches. The Broadway movie palaces fell victim to a number of circumstances, including changing demographics and tastes, a downtown location that was perceived as dangerous at night, and high maintenance costs for aging facilities. With the closure of the Loew's State Theater in 1998, the Orpheum and the Palace were the only two still screening films.
In 2006, the "Los Angeles Times" wrote: "Of all of L.A.'s many hidden gems, maybe none is as sparkling nor as hidden as the Broadway theater district downtown." Bemoaning the possible loss of such gems, the same writer noted: "L.A. gave birth to the movies. To lose the astonishing nurseries where the medium grew up would be tragic."
In 2008, the City of Los Angeles launched a $40-million campaign to revitalize the Broadway district, known as the "Bringing Back Broadway" campaign. Some Latino merchants in the district expressed concern that the campaign was an effort to spread the largely Anglo gentrification taking hold in other parts of downtown to an area that has become the city's leading Latino shopping district. A worker at one of the district's bridal shops noted, "On one side, I like the idea. The only thing is that I don't think they want our types of businesses."
Surviving theaters on Broadway.
The twelve theaters in the Broadway Theater and Commercial District from north to south are:
Million Dollar Theater – Movie palace – Located at 307 S. Broadway, the Million Dollar Theater was built by Sid Grauman and opened in 1918. The theater was designed by architects Albert C. Martin and William Lee Woollett with a fanciful facade in the Churrigueresque style. After more than 30 years as one of the city's most prestigious first-run movie palaces, the Million Dollar Theater presented Spanish-language films and variedades from 1950 until the late 1980s. The theater had a seating capacity of 2,345 when it opened in 1918. In 1925, "Ben-Hur" played for six months at the Million Dollar Theater.
Roxie Theater – Movie palace – Located at 518 S. Broadway, the Roxie was built in 1932—the last of the movie palaces built on Broadway. The Roxie had a seating capacity of 1,600 when it opened and was noted for its Art Deco or Zigzag Moderne style, including its stepped roofline, angular grillwork, chevron ornament, and terrazzo sunburst in the sidewalk. The theater's sleek Streamline Moderne ticket booth was removed when the theater was converted to retail use.
Cameo Theater – Nickelodeon – Located at 528 S. Broadway, the Cameo opened in 1910 with a seating capacity of 775. Designed by Alfred Rosenheim in a Renaissance Revival style, the Cameo was originally known as Clune's Broadway. Until it closed in 1991, it was the oldest continuously operating movie theater in California. The Cameo has been converted into a swap meet-type market.
Arcade Theater – English-music-hall-style theater – Located at 534 S. Broadway, the Arcade opened in 1910 as a vaudeville house that was part of the Pantages vaudeville circuit. The Arcade was designed by Morgan & Walls in the Beaux Arts style with tripartite vertical division of the facade.
Los Angeles Theater – Movie Palace – Located at 615 S. Broadway, the Los Angeles opened in 1931 for the premiere of Charlie Chaplin's "City Lights". It had a seating capacity just short of 2,000. The theater was designed by S. Charles Lee and S. Tilden Norton in the French Baroque style, and was modeled on San Francisco's Fox Theater. The Los Angeles included the latest technological features when it opened, including an electric monitor of available seats, blue neon floor lights, a restaurant, a children's playroom, soundproof crying rooms, smoking room with built-in cigarette lighters, a walnut-paneled lounge with a secondary screen on which a periscope-like system of prisms relayed the film. The ladies' powder room was lined with mirrors and vanities, and the toilet stalls were each done in a different kind of marble and each toilet bowl of a different pastel shade. In 1988, the "Los Angeles Times" called it "a movie house for the gods, even in its present dusty state." Columnist Jack Smith wrote that the Los Angeles Theater was "palatial beyond the dreams of a prince" with a lobby that suggested "nothing less than the glory of Versailles." Aerosmith's video for "Jaded" was filmed throughout the theater.
Palace Theater – Vaudeville theater and movie palace – Located at 630 S. Broadway, the Palace opened in 1911 with a seating capacity of 2,200. It was an Orpheum vaudeville theater from 1911–1926 and is the oldest remaining Orpheum theater in the United States. The structure was designed by G. Albert Lansburgh based on a Florentine early Renaissance palazzo. The brick facade includes multi-colored terra-cotta swags and four panels depicting the muses of vaudeville sculpted by Domingo Mora.
Loew's State Theatre – Vaudeville theater and movie palace – Located at 703 S. Broadway, Loew's State opened in 1921 with a seating capacity of 2,450. The theater offered both film and vaudeville when it opened. Judy Garland performed at the theater as part of the Gumm Sisters in 1929. Designed by Charles Weeks and William Day, the 12-story Loew's State is said to be the largest brick-clad structure in Los Angeles. The theater is also noted for the seated Buddha located in a niche above the proscenium arch. The exterior has an elaborate "silver platter" chased ornamentation above the ground story. In 1998, Metropolitan Theaters stopped showing movies at the State and leased the space to the Universal Church. As of 2008, the State was being operated as a Spanish-language church.
Globe Theater – Legitimate theater – Located at 744 S. Broadway, the Globe opened in 1913 with a seating capacity of 782. Originally known as the Morosco, it was used for full-scale live dramatic theater. It was converted into a movie theater during the Great Depression and later served as a Spanish-language movie theater. The building was converted into a swap meet in 1987.
Tower Theater – Movie theater – Located at 802 S. Broadway, the Tower opened in 1927 with a seating capacity of 1,000. It was the first of more than 70 theaters designed by S. Charles Lee, who described the Tower as a "modified French Renaissance" design. It was the first movie theater in Downtown Los Angeles equipped to accommodate talking pictures.
Rialto Theater – Movie theater – Located at 812 S. Broadway, the Rialto opened as Quinn's Rialto, a nickelodeon, in 1917. It was purchased by Sid Grauman in 1919, the year after he opened the Million Dollar Theater. Today the theater is being retrofitted to house an Urban Outfitters store.
Orpheum Theatre – Vaudeville theater and movie palace – Located at 842 S. Broadway, the Orpheum opened in 1926 as the fourth Los Angeles home for the Orpheum vaudeville circuit. Architect G. Albert Lansburgh designed the François Premier style interior. The Orpheum has hosted performances by Jack Benny, Eddie Cantor, Sophie Tucker, Will Rogers, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, the Marx Brothers, and Lena Horne. In the 1990s, Tom Hanks used the Orpheum as a substitute for the Orpheum in Pittsburgh for his film "That Thing You Do". The Orpheum has also been featured in the Guns 'N Roses video, "November Rain," and in the Sean Penn-directed video for Jewel's "You Were Meant for Me." In 2006, the film "Dreamgirls" was shot at the Orpheum. The television series "So You Think You Can Dance" and "American Idol" have used the Orpheum for Los Angeles auditions, and "Idol" has televised its early elimination rounds from the theater.
United Artists Theater – Movie palace – Located at 933 S. Broadway, the United Artists opened in 1927 with a seating capacity of 2,214. It was the showcase for movies from the United Artists group created in 1919 by Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks and D.W. Griffith. The theater was designed by C. Howard Crane, with Walker & Eisen, in a Gothic style inspired by a church in Segovia, Spain. The columns feature terra cotta capitals carved with film and theater themed grotesques. The interior includes a series of frescoes and murals by the firm of Anthony Heinsbergen. In 1990, the United Artists Theater was restored by Gene Scott's L.A. University Church; Scott called on his television flock to come to Los Angeles to help with the restoration. Scott's famous "Jesus Saves" sign was placed on the back side of the building to avoid interfering with the original facade. In 2013 the upper floors of the building were renovated into a boutique hotel, the Ace Los Ageles; the auditorium has been returned to use as a concert venue and theater. 
Other surviving theaters in the vicinity.
Warner Bros. Downtown Theatre – Vaudeville theater and movie palace – Located at 401 W. 7th St (northwest corner of South Hill and West 7th St). Opening on August 17, 1920, it was originally called the Pantages Theatre, but was renamed Warner Bros. Downtown Theatre in 1930 after the Hollywood Pantages Theatre was opened. The exterior has an imposing domed corner tower, flanked by twin facades on 7th and Hill. Later in the 1960s, it was known as the Warrens Theatre. It currently houses a jewelry store.
Olympic Theatre – Movie palace – Located at 313 W. 8th St, half a block from S. Broadway, it originally opened in 1927 as Bard's 8th Street Theatre, converted from a restaurant. For a time, it had a second entrance on Broadway. It most recently was the site of a chandelier store.
Mayan Theater – Vaudeville theater and movie palace – Located at 1014 South Hill Street. Opened in August 1927 and now designated a Historic Cultural Monument, the Mayan is currently used as a nightclub.
Belasco Theater – Legitimate theater – Located at 1050 South Hill Street, adjacent to the Mayan. Built by the Belasco brothers, and designed by Morgan, Walls and Clements. It served as a church from 1950 to 1987, renovations were completed in 2011 to modernize the sound and lighting systems.

2008–09 Syracuse Orange men's basketball team

The 2008–09 Syracuse Orange men's basketball team represented Syracuse University in the 2008–09 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Head Coach is Jim Boeheim, serving for his 33rd year. The team played its home games at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse, New York. Key contributors included senior Kristof Ongenaet, juniors Eric Devendorf, Arinze Onuaku, Andy Rautins and Paul Harris, sophomores Rick Jackson and Jonny Flynn and freshman Kris Joseph.
Preseason.
Roster changes.
Syracuse lost its leading scorer from the previous season, forward Donte Greene, who declared for the 2008 NBA draft and was taken with the 28th overall pick by the Memphis Grizzlies. Greene was then traded to the Houston Rockets and again to the Sacramento Kings.
Syracuse used Greene's scholarship to add Iowa State transfer Wesley Johnson. Johnson averaged 12.4 points per game during his sophomore season with the Cyclones, but must sit out the 2008–09 season. Syracuse will also have lacrosse recruit Kevin Drew, a walk-on.
On the injury front, Syracuse returned juniors Eric Devendorf and Andy Rautins. Both had suffered season ending knee injuries in the 2007–08 season and were granted medical redshirts. However, the Orange also learned before the season started that sophomore Scoop Jardine would be out for entire season after suffering a stress fracture in his left leg.
Recruiting.
Coach Boeheim was able to sign three recruits for the 2008–09 season: Kris Joseph, Mookie Jones and James Southerland. However, Southerland did not qualify with his SAT score to attend Syracuse, and returned to Notre Dame Preparatory Academy for an additional season of play.
Preseason outlook.
With returning co-Big East Rookie of The Year Jonny Flynn, the Orange was picked to finish eighth in the Big East conference by the Big East coach's poll. Flynn was also a first-team all-Big East selection. Syracuse began the season ranked No. 30 in the Associated Press poll and No. 31 in the ESPN/USA Today poll.
Although Syracuse was coming off two-straight NIT-bound seasons, and despite not having won an NCAA tournament game in four seasons, many experts picked Syracuse as a solid choice for the NCAA Tournament.
Season.
Season Recap.
Syracuse started the season strong, winning the CBE Classic. In the semifinals on November 24, 2008, the Orange topped No. 17/18 Florida, 89–83. Jonny Flynn and Paul Harris led five SU players in double figures with 18 points each. In the finals on November 25, 2008, Syracuse defeated the defending champions, the No. 22/23 Kansas Jayhawks, 89–81 in overtime, to capture the CBE Classic. Jonny Flynn had 25 points, including a 3-pointer with 6.4 seconds left in regulation to send the game to overtime. Flynn was named MVP of the tournament.
But the season would hit a low point on December 15, 2008 when then-No. 11 Syracuse lost to unranked Cleveland State University 72–69 as a result of a 60-foot, buzzer-beating shot by Cleveland State's Cedric Jackson.
Syracuse would add another key non-conference win on December 20, 2008, when then-No. 11 Syracuse won a key away game against national runner-up Memphis as Syracuse's stifling zone held Memphis to just 7-for-33 shooting from 3-point land. Flynn paced the Orange with 24 points and six assists, as Syracuse was able to deal with the loss of Eric Devendorf to a suspension after he was accused of hitting a female student on Nov. 1.
Perhaps the biggest game of the season happened on March 12–13, 2009, when then-No. 18 Syracuse and No. 4 Connecticut played the longest game in Big East history, and second longest in NCAA Division I history, as Syracuse won 127–117 in six overtimes. Flynn set a new Syracuse record by playing 67 minutes.
Syracuse would be named a No. 3 seed for the NCAA Tournament and win games over Stephen F. Austin (59–44) and Arizona State (78–67) to advance to the Sweet 16. But the Orange would be halted by Blake Griffin and Oklahoma in an 84–71 loss. The loss would mark the final game for Devendorf, Flynn and Harris, who all left the team following the season for the professional ranks.
Big East tournament.
Syracuse was seeded sixth and received a bye in the first round. They reached the finals of the 2009 tournament, where they were defeated by the first-seeded Louisville Cardinals, 76–66. It was their fourteenth time making the Big East Tournament Finals, the most for any team in the conference.
Prior to making the finals, Syracuse's performance featured a conference record six-overtime quarterfinals game (the second longest game in NCAA history) in which they defeated third-seeded Connecticut 127–117. A day later, in the semifinals, the Orange were forced into overtime again, where they defeated West Virginia 74–69 in a single extra session.
Jonny Flynn was named the tournament's most outstanding player, becoming just the fourth player in Big East Tournament history to win the award as a member of the second-place team.
NCAA tournament.
The Orange were seeded third in the South Region, and played fourteenth-seeded Stephen F. Austin on Friday, March 20 at American Airlines Arena in Miami, Florida. The Orange won, 59–44. They faced sixth-seeded Arizona State in the second round, winning 78–67. Their season ended in the South regional semifinals when they lost 84–71 to Oklahoma.

Leopoldo Alfredo Bravo

Leopoldo Alfredo Bravo (30 July 1960 – 30 October 2010) was an Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Argentine Republic to the Russian Federation.
The son of Leopoldo Bravo, a former Ambassador of Argentina to the Soviet Union and powerful San Juan Province political figure, Bravo served in the Provincial Legislature on his father's "Partido Bloquista" ticket from 1987 to 1993, and in the Argentine Chamber of Deputies from 1995 to 1999. He returned to the San Juan Legislature, and in 2002, was named Financial Attaché to the Argentine Embassy in Moscow.
Bravo was designated Ambassador to the Russian Federation on September 12, 2006 (a post his father had held during Juan Perón's last presidency, in 1973–74). He served concomitantly as Ambassador to Ukraine from 2007, and from 2008, in Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kirgizstan, and Turkmenistan.
He died of cancer on 30 October 2010 at the age of 50; he was survived by his wife, Laura Adámoli, and their four children.

AND-OR-Invert

AND-OR-Invert (AOI) logic and AOI gates are two-level compound (or complex) logic functions constructed from the combination of one or more AND gates followed by a NOR gate. Construction of AOI cells is particularly efficient using CMOS technology where the total number of transistor gates can be compared to the same construction using NAND logic or NOR logic. The complement of AOI Logic is OR-AND-Invert (OAI) logic where the OR gates precede an AND gate.
Logic operations.
AOI gates perform one or more AND operations followed by an OR operation and then an inversion. For example, a 2-2 AOI gate can be represented by the boolean equation and truth table:
formula_1
A 2-1 AOI gate can be represented by following the boolean equation and truth table:
formula_2
Larger AOI gates, such as 4-3 AOI or 3-3-3 AOI can also be used.
Electronic implementation.
AOI gates can be readily implemented in CMOS circuitry. AOI gates are particularly advantaged in that the total number of transistors (or gates) is less than if the AND, NOT, and OR functions were implemented separately. This results in increased speed, reduced power, smaller area, and potentially lower fabrication cost. For example, a 2-1 AOI gate can be constructed with 6 transistors in CMOS compared to 10 transistors using a 2-input NAND gate (4 transistors), an inverter (2 transistors), and a 2-input NOR gate (4 transistors).

Anna De Souza

Anna Catherine De Souza is a fictional character on the British soap opera Emmerdale played by Emma Davies. She made her first appearance on 8 July 2008 and left on 6 January 2009.
Character creation and development.
Anna De Souza's arrival was announced in June 2008. "Emmerdale" producer Anita Turner said, "Anna is a really interesting character. She seeks her father’s approval but everyone else must dance to her tune. Anna sees opportunities and goes for them. The King Brothers won't know what's hit them!" and "She's very much harping back to the history of the show... she has hidden depths – it's all about the complexities." 
Actress Emma Davies described Anna as an "extremely fun and confident woman" who also has a "vulnerability", and due to her love for the country, is "more Kim Tate than Sadie King." In spite of the "superbitch" tag, Davies said Anna was "not a snob" and "not an obvious bitch." 
In October 2008, Anita Turner announced that Emma Davies would be leaving around the end of 2008, saying, "Emma is a hugely talented actress but Anna's story always dictated a beginning, a middle and an end and that will culminate in dramatic scenes in December, which are being filmed at the moment." 
Davies said, 
Storylines.
Anna was extremely close to her father, Donald De Souza, while growing up, and helped him build his fortune. When she met Mark, Donald dismissed him as a fortune hunter, but Anna refused to end it. When she married Mark, Donald cut her out of his will and cut off all contact. She ran her own company in Dubai. Within six years, Mark had spent all Anna's money and was cheating on her. The marriage was over. 
Anna was in touch with her brother Miles. He told her about Donald's illness and she realised she had to see him. Anna arrived during Donald's 75th birthday party. She went to Holdgate Farm, looking for him and met Carl King. Carl thought Anna was looking for a job and Anna didn't disillusion him. He told her about her father's birthday party at Home Farm and she went there to see him.
At Home Farm, she and Carl bet their cars for whoever hit both targets in skeet shooting. Anna easily hit both targets but told Carl he could keep his car, as she didn't like it very much.
After telling her father about the changes in her life, she said she couldn't let him be swayed by Carl the way she'd been swayed by Mark, and to remember Carl's family were their main rivals. Donald listened to her but made Carl Managing Director, telling Anna she had a lot to prove. Anna had no intention of giving up without a fight. She moved in with her father, ostensibly to help her brother, and soon began to clash with Carl.
A few weeks after her return, Anna hired Miles's ex-girlfriend Jasmine Thomas to work on their website revamp as well as running errands. Unfortunately, her matchmaking efforts backfired when Jasmine's new boyfriend Jake Doland laughed at Miles for being so desperate to hire Jasmine to spend time with him. Miles was humiliated by his sister's interference and left town.
Anna and Carl's rivalry continued to rage, with them constantly trying to trick and undermine the other. However, it soon became clear that there was a mutual attraction, although neither would admit it.
Things came to a head when Carl, sick of Anna undermining him, played a trick on her to get her back. Anna had been claiming that she wanted to learn De Souza Enterprises from the ground up so Carl let her take a company truck for a test drive. He didn't tell her that the fuel tank was only half full and she was soon stranded when the truck broke down on a country lane in the middle of nowhere. Matthew King, Carl's older brother, came to her rescue and was amused by her description of Carl. Anna and Matthew became good friends, sharing a mutual distrust of Carl and an ambitious way of conducting business. Carl was jealous of Matthew and Anna's relationship, and decided to get back with ex-girlfriend, Lexi Nicholls to make her jealous. Much to Carl's disappointment, Anna was amused and swiftly began teasing him about his feelings for her. 
Anna soon had to choose between Carl and Matthew as her relationships with both progressed. It was unclear if Anna was genuinely interested in either, or was playing them off against each other for her own reasons and amusement. 
Carl and Anna's frosty partnership came to a sharp end after she had a vicious fight with Donald, and Carl comforted her. The pair saw each other in a different light, and Carl kissed her, seemingly to her surprise. After some initial confusion, she told him she would like a relationship with him but first Carl would have to dump Lexi. However, when Carl tried to end things with her, Lexi revealed she knew he had killed his father, Tom King, forcing Carl to stay with her so that she would not tell anyone. Anna was furious and told Carl that he would be sorry for making her look like a fool.
Meanwhile, Matthew also tried to kiss Anna after they closed a successful business deal. However, she pulled away. She admitted that she wanted him but told him they could only have a business relationship, unaware that Carl had not dumped Lexi. Matthew asked if he was supposed to hide his feelings for her, and she replied he would have to if he wanted their current relationship to continue. Undeterred, Matthew continued to chase Anna, despite being turned down a second time.
Anna and Carl's rivalry was back, and nastier than ever, with them soon getting into a bidding war for Mill Cottage. Annoyed, Carl complained to Donald, who was incensed to discover Anna was out with Matthew, who he felt was a troublemaker and unsuitable for his daughter. In retaliation, Donald offered to buy Mill Cottage for Carl and Lexi.
Later, Anna guessed that Carl had betrayed De Souza Enterprises by sending a rich client to King and Sons. Disappointed, Donald bought Carl out and he returned to King & Sons. Donald suffered a heart attack due to the stress and another argument with Anna. However, during his recovery in hospital, he and Anna made up, and Donald told Anna that he wanted to sign De Souza Enterprises over to her, even calling his Solicitor to bring the contract to the hospital. Much to his surprise, Anna tore the contract up and stated her intention to prove herself before taking ownership of the company. Reunited, Donald and Anna began to plot their revenge against the Kings.
Matthew visited Donald in hospital (after sending Carl on a business trip to Brussels) attempting to clear the air between them, saying they had more to gain by working together than against each other. He also told Anna that he didn't want there to be any bad feeling between them. Donald agreed to discuss Matthew's proposal with Anna but after Matthew left, Donald told Anna she should use Matthew's feelings for her against him. Anna, at first, seemed shocked at his suggestion, asking her father how far she was supposed to go, and showing confusion about the route that their plan for revenge was taking. However, desperate to impress, Anna arranged to meet Matthew, who soon insisted that he take her to dinner, kicking Donald and Anna's plan into action.
Anna and Matthew continued spending time together, and she soon had trouble with her feelings for him. Matthew was particularly touched when Anna got him a new watch after his old one was ruined and retrieved the engraving from the old one, as he explained that his father had given him the watch on his 21st birthday and it held a lot of sentimental value. No longer able to deny the chemistry between them, the pair finally slept together, and proceeded to start a secret relationship. Donald, unknowingly, offered Anna's services on a business trip to Warsaw, as a Consultant, thinking Anna could get some valuable inside information about King & Sons for their revenge plan. What he didn't expect was Anna admitting to him that she had fallen in love with Matthew. A furious Donald shunned Anna, telling her he'd ruin the Kings with or without her help, and kept information that she thought she had destroyed. Matthew told Anna that he returned her feelings, telling her he loved her more than he imagined possible, and they agreed to start again. When Matthew returned to Warsaw to complete the business deal, Donald begged Anna to end her relationship with him and threatened to tell Matthew the reason why Anna got close to him in the first place.
When Matthew returned, Anna knew she had to confess before Donald told Matthew. Angry, Matthew initially dumped her but listened when she insisted she would turn her back on Donald, and asked him to marry her. He happily accepted, and the news was broken to Donald, Jimmy, and Carl. The next day, Matthew proposed to Anna with an antique engagement ring as she moved her belongings to Home Farm. A party was planned, to celebrate both the engagement, and the successful deal with Polek Haulage. Donald crashed the party, announcing to everyone that Anna was only marrying Matthew to ruin the Kings from the inside. Matthew angrily retorted that Donald had tried to buy him off, and convinced his brothers that Donald was lying. Donald threatened Anna that he would disinherit her if she didn't break off the engagement, and she furiously insisted that she choose Matthew, and ordered him to leave. Hating to see his fiancee so upset, Matthew told Anna that the only thing that mattered was them, and planned to confront Donald alone.
Matthew's visit to Donald did not end well, as Donald had a heart attack after Matthew confronted him at Holdgate Farm. Donald began to suffer chest pains but Matthew, thinking he was making it up, refused to give him his medication until he agreed to attend the wedding. Donald made a final plea, and fell to the floor, dead. Matthew, panicked, fled the scene and Donald's body was found the next day by cleaners Betty Eagleton and Laurel Thomas, who contacted Anna and the authorities. 
Devastated, Anna believed her father had died, thinking that she hated him. Katie comforted Anna and told her about the similar circumstances of her father's death. Meanwhile, Matthew confessed to Carl that he was involved in Donald's death. Disgusted that Matthew could keep this from Anna, Carl warned Matthew that the guilt would eat him alive, if he didn't tell Anna. Matthew explained that he was terrified of losing her, and couldn't tell her. 
Meanwhile, whilst planning her father's funeral, Anna insisted that they continue planning their wedding, as the thought of marrying him was helping her through her grief.
After Donald's death, Anna began helping King & Sons financially, as she loved Matthew and felt some remorse that she had helped to lure their biggest client away. By the day of the wedding, a creditor had got a court order dissolving King & Sons and the bailiffs had arrived at Home Farm. Anna gave the bailiffs her car if they would give them 24 hours. The bailiffs agreed. 
Carl went to see the lawyer, and began believing that Anna and Matthew were working together. He ruined the wedding by revealing Matthew's role in Donald's death. Devastated, Anna left and Matthew and Carl had a fight. Matthew got into a van and tried to run Carl down. 
Meanwhile, Katie had gone after Anna and was trying to persuade her to return to the wedding. Anna saw Carl, and demanded answers about her father's death. Matthew was driving towards Carl, but at the last minute, saw Anna was with Carl and swerved to avoid her, crashing into a wall and was catapulted through the windscreen. Despite Jimmy calling an ambulance, Matthew died in Anna's arms, after managing to choke out how much he loved her. Anna was devastated. 
The next morning she told Katie she'd come to Emmerdale to mend fences with her father, and instead she'd lost her father and a man she deeply loved. She asked Jimmy and Carl about Matthew and her father's death. An embittered Carl let her believe the worst, but Jimmy told her that Matthew had never meant for Donald to die.
Anna left town for two weeks to track down her brother, Miles, and the Kings agreed not to hold the funeral until her return.
The Kings heard nothing from Anna during her absence, and finally decided to hold the funeral. Anna returned halfway through the service. A drunken Jimmy lambasted her, but Carl eulogized that Anna had been the first person Matthew had been able to express his love for since their mother's death. At the wake, Carl gave Anna hers and Matthew's wedding rings, and finding closure in their tense relationship, they hugged goodbye.
After the wake, Anna told Katie the company she'd worked for before moving to Emmerdale had asked her to rejoin them. She had an emotional farewell with Katie, thanking Katie for being one of the only people in town who hadn't judged her.
As Anna drove away, she saw a distraught Jimmy trying to finish burying Matthew. Her eyes filling with tears, she stopped for a moment but continued on. The last shot was of the flowers Anna had put at Matthew's grave, with a note saying she missed him so much, it was hard to breathe.

Joe Rogers, Sr.

Joe Rogers, Sr. is an American businessman. He is co-founder and former CEO of the Waffle House franchise restaurant chain, which began business in 1955 in Georgia, and has grown to over 1700 locations in 25 states.
Early years.
A native of Tennessee, Rogers started in the restaurant business as a short-order cook in 1947, at the Toddle House in New Haven, Connecticut. By 1949, he had become a regional manager with the now-defunct Memphis-based restaurant chain, and moved to Atlanta. There he met Tom Forkner, when he bought a house from him in the Atlanta suburb of Avondale Estates.
Rogers, inspired by the emergence of fast food chains like McDonalds, proposed that he and Forkner go into business together for a quick-service, sit-down restaurant. Rogers' concept was to marry the speed of fast food with table service and around the clock availability. He told Forkner "...You build a restaurant and I’ll show you how to run it,"’ recalls Tom Forkner. Forkner suggested a Toddle House, but Rogers felt the chain wasn't proper for the market. After Forkner secured the property, the pair developed the concept of the Waffle House together; Forkner proposed the name, while Rogers suggested keeping a 24-hour schedule.
Waffle House.
The first Waffle House opened on Labor Day weekend, 1955 at 2719 East College Avenue in Avondale Estates, Georgia. The restaurant was named after the most profitable item on the 16-item menu. The fragile nature of waffles also made the point that it was a dine-in, not a carry-out, restaurant, but it confused patrons as to meal availability other than breakfast.
Rogers continued to work with Toddle House, and to avoid conflict of interest sold his interest to Forkner in 1956. In 1960, when Rogers asked to buy into Toddle House, and they refused, he moved back to Atlanta and rejoined Waffle House, now a chain of three restaurants, to run restaurant operations. Shortly after Rogers returned full-time, Forkner followed suit and left Ben S. Forkner Realty.
After opening a fourth restaurant in 1960, the company began franchising its restaurants and slowly grew to 27 stores by the late 1960s, before growth accelerated. As of 2013, there were over 1700 locations in 25 states. The company is privately held and doesn’t disclose annual sales figures, but says they serve 2% of the eggs used in the nation's food service industry. The founders limit their involvement in management, Joe Rogers, Jr. is CEO, and Bert Thornton is President. The original founders, Rogers and Forkner, continue to own a majority of the company.

First Winter Campaign

The First Winter Campaign was a campaign between the army of the Ukrainian People's Republic (UNR) and bolshevik forces in Ukraine during the Ukrainian-Soviet War. It began on December 6, 1919, and lasted until May 6, 1920.
The leader of the Ukrainian forces was General Mykhailo Omelianovych-Pavlenko.
Background.
The First World War saw tremendous upheaval in Ukraine, and in the short period between the spring of 1917 and late 1919, three governments had taken shape in the capital, Kiev. However, the political situation was difficult because of the international pressure from Poland, and especially the Bolsheviks.
By late 1919, it became clear that conventional warfare against bolshevik forces in Ukraine had become impossible, so the Ukrainian People's Republic had decided to demobilize its military and conduct partisan warfare behind Bolshevik lines.
Participating Units.
There were three main Ukrainian units - they were renamed divisions in February 1920.
"Zaporizhia", commanded by General Andrii Huly-Hulenko;
"Kiev", commanded by General Yurii Tiutiunnyk;
and "Volhynia", commanded by Gen Oleksander Zahrodsky.
Main Battles.
Because of the nature of the campaign, the armies covered very much territory. Originally the main theater of war was the Yelizavetgrad region, but as the Bolshevik-Denikin front moved south, so did the campaign.
The main battles of the First Winter Campaign took place at Lypovets, Zhashkiv, Uman, Kaniv, Cherkasy, Smila, Zolotonosha, Olviopol, Holovanivsk, Haisyn, Voznesensk, Ananiv, and Balta.

Wind farm management

Wind farm management covers the operation and maintenance and administration of wind farms.
Wind power managing owners.
Over the past few years the global trend is toward public utilities and large Independent Power Producers (IPPs) developing and owning large scale (normally about 20 to 500 MW) wind farms. Wind power managing owners, along with other financing parties and equity partners, typically sell the electricity generated from wind farms to other public utilities under long-term (typically 20 years) Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) where they receive a fixed or annually adjusted price for the electricity. Renewable energy incentives (which vary by country) also play a role in the revenue stream of a managing owner.
Largest managing owners in the world.
According to the April 2008 press release from Emerging Energy Research, Spain-based Iberdrola (with its acquisition of Scottish Power and its 2nd-ranking U.S. developer PPM Energy) surpassed U.S.-based FPL Energy to become the world's largest wind owner with over 6,900 MW of capacity. After Iberdrola and FPL, the largest wind owners in the world are Energias de Portugal (EDP), Spain-based Acciona, Australian investment bank Babcock & Brown, Longyuan, German utility E.ON, Spanish utility Endesa, U.K.-based IPP International Power, and EDF Energies Nouvelles.
Largest managing owners in the U.S..
The largest wind power managing owners in the United States as of May 2008 are given in the table below:
Research and development.
Despite growing worldwide demand for wind energy, present wind technology is not optimized and there are still significant challenges. Most of the research has occurred in industry, and is not always easily shared. According to a research agenda from a coalition of researchers from universities, industry, and government, supported by the Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future, wind energy research requires a drastic transformation. According to the report:
The gains that we are seeking require new innovations in fluid dynamics, control, materials, manufacturing, structures, and electric power distribution, as well of new ways of engaging the public in appreciating and accepting this technology, the associated transmission infrastructure and its effects on reducing climate change. Design and analysis tools need to be developed. Common computer codes need to be shared and refined in an open collegial way that cannot occur in industry. Researchers need to disseminate, debate, and share results openly, accelerating innovation in the subject.

Macdaniel affair

The Macdaniel affair or Macdaniel scandal occurred in England in 1754 when it came to light that a gang, led by Stephen MacDaniel, had been prosecuting innocent men to their deaths in order to collect reward money. It was an unintended consequence of British government rewards for the capture of criminals. Before those rewards were instituted, thief-takers depended primarily on privately funded rewards from victims seeking return of stolen property or other restitution. However, this scandal formed part of the impetus for the formation of salaried public police forces who did not depend on rewards.

Jared Cohen

Jared Cohen (born November 24, 1981) is the Director of Google Ideas and an Adjunct Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Previously, he served as a member of the Secretary of State's Policy Planning Staff and as an advisor to Condoleezza Rice and later Hillary Clinton. Initially brought in by Condoleezza Rice as a member of the Policy Planning Staff, he was one of the few staffers that stayed under Hillary Clinton. In this capacity, he focused on counter-terrorism, counter-radicalization, Middle East/South Asia, Internet freedom, and fostering opposition in repressive countries. According to "The New York Times Magazine", Cohen was one of the participating architects of what was labeled in 2010 as "21st century statecraft" along with Richard Boly and several foreign service officers in the Department of State's Office of eDiplomacy In 2013, Cohen was named by Time Magazine as one of its 100 most influential people.
Early life and education.
Cohen was born in Weston, Connecticut. Cohen received a bachelor's degree from Stanford University in 2004, majoring in history and political science and minoring in African studies. He subsequently earned a master's degree in International Relations from Oxford University, where he studied as a Rhodes Scholar.
Career.
Before graduating college, Cohen pursued interests in government and in mass media. He was an intern at the U.S. State Department. In 2004, he was a miscellaneous member of the crew for one episode of a PBS "Frontline" documentary "Ghosts of Rwanda" on the 10-year anniversary of the Rwandan genocide.
U.S. State Department.
Following his internship and graduation, Cohen served as a member of the Secretary of State's Policy Planning Staff from 2006 to 2010. He was 24 years of age. His service began under former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, during the Bush Administration.
In her book "No Higher Honor", Condoleezza Rice writes of Cohen:
Cohen was one of the few members of Policy Planning kept on by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. He played a role in helping shape counter-radicalization strategies and advised on US policy towards Iran and the Middle East. Beginning in April 2009, Cohen aided delegations focused on connecting technology executives with local stakeholders in Iraq, Russia, Mexico, Congo, and Syria.
In the midst of the June 2009 protests in Iran, Cohen sought to support the opposition in Iran. He contacted Twitter, requesting that the company not perform planned maintenance that would have temporarily shut down service in Iran, because the protestors were using Twitter to maintain contact with the outside world. According to The New Yorker Ryan Lizza, “The move violated Obama’s rule of non-interference, and White House officials were furious." In an interview with Clinton, she “did not betray any disagreement with the President over Iran policy,” but “cited Cohen’s move with pride.”
While serving on the Policy Planning Staff, Cohen became an advisor to Richard Holbrooke, who was the first Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan. He took several trips with Holbrooke to Afghanistan, where he helped develop some of the early strategic communications strategies.
Cohen was among the early adopters of social media in the U.S. government. In April 2010, Cohen had the third largest number of Twitter followers in the US government, behind Barack Obama and John McCain. By Sept 2013, he was not in the top 20.
Google.
Cohen left the State Department's Policy Planning staff on 2 September 2010. On 7 September 2010, Cohen became an adjunct senior fellow at The Council on Foreign Relations focusing on counter-radicalization. He was hired as the first director of Google Ideas, a new branch within Google in mid-October 2010.
Books.
Cohen is author of three books. His most recent book is co-authored with Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt, entitled "The New Digital Age: Re-shaping the Future of People, Nations and Business". The book became a New York Times bestseller in its first week of publication. The book looks at our geopolitical future when 5 billion new people come online (terrorism, war, identity, conflict, and relations between states), and grew out of an article, "The Digital Disruption", which was published in Foreign Affairs magazine in November 2010. It suggests that technology would rewrite the relationship between states and their citizens in the 21st century, and was possibly prescient about the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt, that followed in 2011. Julian Assange wrote of the book, "proselytizes the role of technology in reshaping the world's people and nations into likenesses of the world's dominant superpower, whether they want to be reshaped or not. The prose is terse, the argument confident and the wisdom — banal… This book is a balefully seminal work in which neither author has the language to see, much less to express, the titanic centralizing evil they are constructing."
A critical review by the New Republic stated:
Cohen's first book, "One Hundred Days of Silence: America and the Rwanda Genocide," was published in 2006 by Rowman & Littlefield and chronicles U.S. policy toward Rwanda during the 1994 Genocide. His second book, "Children of Jihad: A Young American's Travels Among the Youth of the Middle East," was published by Penguin Books (Gotham) in October 2007 and has also been published as an audio book and translated into Dutch and Italian.
He and co-author Eric Schmidt published "The Dark Side of the Digital Revolution" in the Wall Street Journal in 2013, and a 2012 article for The Washington Post, entitled "Technology Can Be Harnessed to Fight Drug Cartels in Mexico," which grew out of a trip the two took to Ciudad Juárez.
Other activities.
Cohen has been involved in the Tribeca Film Festival, serving as a juror in multiple categories over a number of years. Cohen serves on the Director's Advisory Board at the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC).

Infantry Immersion Trainer

The Infantry Immersion Trainer (IIT) is a mixed reality training facility prototype for small unit Infantry located in a former tomato packing plant in Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California. It has been in operation since November 2007. The original IIT is now known as IIT Phase I. A purpose built IIT was built adjacent to Phase I in Camp Pendleton. A second IIT was built in a historic warehouse in Camp Lejeune, NC and a third was built in MCB Hawaii.
Description.
The interior of an abandoned warehouse has been turned into an embattled Middle Eastern town through the use of sets, and special effects such as projections, pyrotechnics, sounds, and smells. The combination of live and virtual training is what makes this an example of immersive training.
Purpose.
The IIT facility is designed to be a decision house for the Marine Rifleman and the Small Unit Leader (SUL); focusing on increasing the tempo of the OODA Loop during which an individual Observes a situation, Orients to it and develops courses of action (COA), makes a Decision, and Acts. Stress inoculation is conducted at the facility where a rifleman is put into multiple situations that in turn replicate the stressors and physiological responses faced in combat, thus building the individuals stress-immune system. 
During a visit to the IIT, Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, said, "It's a reminder of what simulation can do. It certainly is great preparation for the marines as they prepare to go to Iraq. Very impressive, very realistic and in the end hopefully, we'll contribute significantly to a better way to execute the mission and save lives." 
History.
The IIT facility was built by the Office of Naval Research and PMTRASYS at the request of the Commanding General, I Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF), then LtGen James Mattis, and by elements of the I MEF TEG (Training and Experimentation Group) to include the Battle Simulation Center, to serve as a way to inoculate the Marine Rifleman with the sights, sounds, and smells of the chaotic environment experienced in close quarters urban warfare.
Although it was built quickly, it was based on more than 10 years of training and simulation research.
Technology.
Technology elements of the facility were pioneered by the Tech Solutions program at the Office of Naval Research under the leadership of CDR Dylan Schmorrow. 
Special Effects Small Arms Marking System (SESAMS), computer-generated avatars, and other technologies combine with real sets and objects. It is this combination of the virtual and live worlds that allows the Marines to go through the training scenario wearing their standard combat gear.
In 2009 a second IIT-like facility was opened at the Marine Corps Systems Command Gruntworks facility in Stafford, Virginia. The Gruntworks Research for Infantry Integration Testing (GRIIT) provides a realistic environment to test infantryman's combat equipment so it can be further optimized.
The Future Immersive Training Environment (FITE) Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (JCTD) upgraded many of the technologies in IIT Phase I. In addition to avatar upgrades, there were significant upgrades to tracking and after action review. Animatronics of Afghan civilians were added to the marketplace. The FITE JCTD concluded in FY 11.

Group Selection (book)

Group Selection is a 1971 book edited by George C. Williams, containing papers written by biologists arguing against the view of group selection as a major force in evolution. The group of biologists writing on a single unified (if somewhat broad) theme contrasts with Williams' earlier seminal 1966 book "Adaptation and Natural Selection", which Williams suspected such views to be his alone. In particular it contains a reprint, with an erratum, of W.D. Hamilton's classic 1964 paper on inclusive fitness, "The Genetical Evolution of Social Behavior" plus a paper by John Maynard Smith entitled "The Origin and Maintenance of Sex" (pp 163–175), containing ideas on evolution of sex later developed by Maynard Smith; see especially his 1978 book "The Evolution of Sex".

<doc id="18290294" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18290294" title="Radial piston pump">
Radial piston pump

A radial piston pump is a form of hydraulic pump. The working pistons extend in a radial direction symmetrically around the drive shaft, in contrast to the axial piston pump.
Construction.
The stroke of each piston is caused by an eccentric drive shaft or an external eccentric tappet (e.g., stroke ring).
When filling the workspace of the pumping pistons from "inside" (e.g., over a hollow shaft) it is called an "inside impinged" (but outside braced) radial piston pump "(picture 1)". If the workspace is filled from "outside" it's called an "outside impinged" radial piston pump (but inside braced) "(picture 2)".
Function.
The general mode of operation will be explained at the movement of one pumping piston by means of picture 1: <br> The outer ring for bracing of the pumping pistons is in eccentric position to the hollow shaft in the center. This eccentricity determines the stroke of the pumping piston.
The piston starts in the inner dead center (IDC) with suction process. After a rotation angle of 180° it is finished and the workspace of the piston is filled with the to moved medium. The piston is now in the outer dead center (ODC). From this point on the piston displaces the previously sucked medium in the pressure channel of the pump.
Attributes.
These kinds of piston pumps are characterized by the following advantages:
A disadvantage are the bigger radial dimensions in comparison to the axial piston pump, but it could be compensated with the shorter construction in axial direction.
Applications.
Due to the hydrostatically balanced parts it is possible to use the pump with various hydraulic fluids like mineral oil, biodegradable oil, HFA (oil in water), HFC (water-glycol), HFD (synthetic ester) or cutting emulsion. That implies the following main applications for a radial piston pump:

Fossil embryo

Fossil embryos are the preserved remains of organisms that have yet to hatch or be born. Many fossils of the Doushantuo formation have been interpreted as embryos; embryos are also common throughout the Cambrian fossil record.
Preservation.
Taphonomic studies indicate that embryos are preserved for longest in reducing, anoxic conditions. These conditions can keep the embryos intact for long enough for bacteria to mineralise the cells and permit their preservation. However, phosphatisation was very rapid in the Doushantuo, so it is possible that faster preservation allowed embryos in different regimes to be preserved.
Preservation is mediated by bacterial biofilms. The cells of the embryo break down within hours of their death, under the effect of its own enzymes. Bacteria invade the decaying embryo before its cells can collapse, and biofilms take on and preserve the three-dimensional structure of the cells. The activity of these bacteria promote mineralisation.
Currently, only fossils representing very early stages in embryonic development have been preserved - no embryos have been interpreted as having undergone a large number cleavage stages.
Affinities.
Some embryos have been interpreted as colonies of sulfur-reducing bacteria, a claim that cannot be upheld in all cases.
Fossilized embryos of the 635- to 551-million year old Doushantuo Formation of southern China exhibit occasional asynchronous cell division, common in modern embryos, implying that sophisticated mechanisms for differential cell division timing and embryonic cell lineage differentiation evolved before 551 million years ago. However, embryos composed of hundreds to more than ~1000 cells still show no evidence of blastocoel formation or the organization of blastomeres into epithelia - epithelialization should be underway in modern embryos with >100 cells. Features preserved on Doushantuo embryos are compatible with metazoans (animals), but the absence of epithelialization is consistent only with a stem-metazoan affinity.
It is not until the Cambrian that embryos with demonstrable eumetazoan features occur; gastrulation and a pentaradial symmetry are expressed in some lower Cambrian fossils.
Some fossil embryos are considered to belong to cnidarians and ecdysozoans, if they even fall into the metazoan crown group. No deuterostome or lophotrochozoan embryos have yet been reported, despite their similar preservation potential; this may be a result of different egg laying behaviour, as ecdysozoans lay eggs in the sediment rather than releasing them into the open - enhancing the chance of them becoming mineralised.
An alternative interpretation of the embryos appears to discount an animal – or indeed embryonic – interpretation altogether. Cell division without enlargement appears to continue beyond what it would in embryos, and without other embryonic traits becoming apparent. Such division is found in a wide range of eukaryotes, including some that are not truly multicellular, and this more conservative interpretation looks to be more parsimonious than embryonic claims.
Some have also bveen interpreted as algal.
Dinosaurs.
Some hadrosaur fossils recovered from the Dinosaur Park Formation may represent embryos.

Romildo Ribeiro Soares

Romildo Ribeiro Soares, also known as R. R. Soares (born December 6, 1947, in Muniz Freire, Espírito Santo), is a Brazilian televangelist, missionary, author, singer, businessman, and composer. He became a televangelist and supporter of faith healing in the late 1960s, after reading a book by T. L. Osborn. Related through marriage to another Brazilian preacher, Edir Macedo, he founded the International Church of God's Grace in 1980. This church is among the largest Pentecostal denominations in Brazil.
R. R. Soares averages about 100 hours on Brazilian television each week.
Early life.
When he was eight, Soares was visiting the nearby town of Cachoeiro do Itapemirim when he saw a television set for the first time. Soares noticed that people were fascinated with what was happening on the screen, and he began to think about encouraging that type of fascination with God by preaching on television. In April 1964 Soares moved to Rio de Janeiro with his family and lived with his uncle Aderbal in São Gonçalo. Soares began his ministry in 1968.
Ministry.
Soares had previously been promised a scholarship to study medicine at Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow. However, after reading the book "Healing the Sick and Casting out Devils" by T. L. Osborn, he felt a call to the ministry. He founded the International Church of God's Grace ("Igreja Internacional da Graça de Deus"), opening the first in 1980 in the city of Duque de Caxias, Rio de Janeiro. He remains the church's leader to this day. He is married with Maria Magdalena and is the father of singer David Soares, deputy mayor André Soares, and three other sons.
Soares hosts the program "Faith Show" on the networks Rede Bandeirantes and CNT during prime time. The show is also broadcast on Rede Internacional de Televisão and Rede TV!. Soares is seen on television around 100 hours per week.
Soares has more than 900 churches throughout Brazil. He also has churches in Lisbon, Pompano Beach, Florida, Miami, Orlando, Florida, Brandon, FL, New Jersey, Corona, New York, Somerville, Massachusetts, Fall River, Massachusetts, and is planning a church in Paris.
On September 10, 2008, Soares began a new system of evangelism: he began to send daily messages by e-mail to people registered at ongrace.com, to help people in need of God. He still continues with this system, with messages translated into English and other languages.
Business interests.
Soares is the owner of the Graça Artes Gráficas and Editora Ltda, the gospel record label Graça Music, Grace Editorial (editor), and Graça Filmes (movie distributor). The RIT TV, Nossa Radio, and Nossa TV belong to the International Church of God's Grace.
Soares is one of the richest and most successful televangelists in Brazil with a net worth estimated by Forbes at $125m in 2013. His other media interests include radio, publishing and music.
Books written.
These books have been translated from Portuguese into English.
Songs produced and written.
This list includes CDs with songs written by R. R. Soares.

The Wonderful Country

The Wonderful Country (aka "The Wonderful Country, A Novel") is a 1952 Western novel written by Tom Lea. The book is set in Chihuahua and Sonora, Mexico, and Texas and New Mexico in the United States. It was filmed in 1959.
After the financial success of "The Brave Bulls", Lea wanted to write a story that he had been thinking about since he was a child, "...write about this borderland and about the people on both sides of the river".
Plot.
Martin Brady, at age 14, flees to Mexico from Texas after he kills the man who murdered his father. Now, fourteen years later, in 1880s Mexico, he is called Martin Bredi. He is a hired gun for a rich Mexican rancher and Chihuahuan warlord, Cipriano Castro. Brady starts to feel like he would like to return to Texas. Castro send him north to Puerto, Texas, to guard a load of silver ore, with the intention of smuggling arms back to the Castros. 
When he gets to Texas he breaks his leg and has to stay put in the town while he heals. He is approached by the head of the Texas Ranger Division in Puerto about joining after the Captain confirms his identity and lets him know that he, Brady will not be prosecuted for killing his father's murderer. He also is enamored by the ranger captain's daughter, Louisa Rucker. 
After killing a man who injured a friend, he returns to Mexico again, and is sent on an impossible errand to deliver a load of gunpowder by General Marco Castro, the brother of Cipriano. The wagon blows up before it is delivered. After returning to Chihuahua, Cipriano Castro sends Brady on an errand to assassinate a rival Salcido, however the Castros are suspicious of him and have him followed. During his sojourn in Chihuahua, he meets an acquaintance from Puerto and learns that the man he killed was a criminal with a reward for his death. 
Wanted in the United States and now distrusted in Mexico, he makes his way back to Texas and on the way assists a lost column of Buffalo soldiers that is deep into Mexico fighting Apache Indians. Back in Texas Brady joins the Texas Rangers, as part of a deal for his being a wanted man, and helps them fight the Apaches back in Mexico. 
A crucial character to the story is Brady's horse, a black Andalusian stallion named Lágrimas ("tears"). 
Reception.
In "TIME"'s review, the magazine said about it: "...is an honest book written with obvious care and even reserved passion..." But, the review continues by saying that Lea is better at landscape development than character development: "Neither Brady nor anyone else in the book is a successfully developed character, but with all its weaknesses The Wonderful Country is still a western plus. What is extra comes in Author Lea's fine descriptive writing, a love for the West that is conveyed with grace and dignity, an authentic sense of place." 
Lou Rodenberge, of McMurry College, said that the novel is: "...the best to date of all fiction created from materials of border life", from "The Southern Border" in "A Literary History of the American West".
"One of the finest of all Southwest novels by a Southwesterner, whose power with pencil and paint is perfectly matched by his way with words". Said Lawrence Clark Powell.
Adaptations.
It became a 1959 film (with the same title) starring Robert Mitchum (also executive producer with his company, D.R.M. Productions, producing) and Julie London, directed by Robert Parrish, and Robert Ardrey adapted the book to the screenplay. Lea also has a bit part as Mr. Peebles (the barber). Satchel Paige has a cameo role as the leader of an Afro-American unit of the U.S. Cavalry, the Buffalo Soldiers.
Parrish went to Lea and ask him if he could direct it. The only money that Lea received from the picture was for his role as the barber.

The Colegio Israelita de México, A.C. is a private K-12 school in Mexico City. It is also known by its acronym, CIM, or as the Idishe, the first word in its Yiddish name.
The school was founded in 1924, when a group of immigrants decided to create an educational institution for the children of Jewish immigrants arriving in Mexico.
The school first operated in Colombia No. 39; it moved to Colombia No. 12 from 1925 through 1927. It then moved to Naranjo no. 267 and grew significantly during the 30s, with the first 6th grade graduation taking place in 1933. In 1935, it moved to San Lorenzo no. 290, where it would remain until the 1970s. The school began to operate a Secundaria (grades 7 through 9) in 1936, with the first 9th grade graduation taking place in 1938. It also began operating a kindergarten in 1936. The school added a Preparatoria (grades 10 and 11) in 1948, and when Mexico switched to a 12 grade system in the mid 1960s, it added a grade 12.
The school is currently located in Loma del Recuerdo no. 44 in Vista Hermosa, Mexico City.

Artificiality

Artificiality (also called factitiousness) is the state of being the product of intentional human manufacture, rather than occurring naturally. Artificiality often carries with it the implication of being false, counterfeit, or deceptive. The philosopher Aristotle wrote in his "Rhetoric":
However, artificiality does not necessarily have a negative connotation, as it may also reflect the ability of humans to replicate forms or functions arising in nature, as with an artificial heart or artificial intelligence. Political scientist and artificial intelligence expert Herbert A. Simon observes that "some artificial things are imitations of things in nature, and the imitation may use either the same basic materials as those in the natural object or quite different materials. Simon distinguishes between the artificial and the synthetic, the former being an imitation of something found in nature (for example, an artificial sweetener which generates sweetness using a formula not found in nature), and the latter being a replication of something found in nature (for example, a sugar created in a laboratory that is chemically indistinguishable from a naturally occurring sugar).

Büyü ("The Spell") is a 2004 Turkish horror film directed by Orhan Oğuz.
Though the film was a surprise box office success, it received very poor reviews. It is ranked #53 in the IMDB's Bottom 100 movies of all time.
Plot.
A group of archeologists go into a ghost village that is cursed by its past. They ignore the warnings of the natives, but soon after they arrive, terror strikes. Weird bugs come out of flames to bite Cemil, Ayadan is raped by an invisible force (she awakes from it like a dream), babies are heard crying in the air, and more unnerving incidents occur. After the unexpected murder by decapitation of Cemil, the group finally bands together to try to take on the evil forces lurking around every corner.
Popularity of Ece Uslu's Rape on Youtube.
Though the film is literally unheard of in western countries (USA, Canada, Mexico). One of the most popular clips of the film on YouTube and other video hosting websites is the rape of Ayadan. Most start at the rape right away and end with her gazing up at the camera (the force's P.O.V) in fear. Some start with Ayse being disturbed in her sleep while cutting back to Aydan being disturbed as well. These versions of the popular clip also end with an extended ending to the scene with the horses escaping the town while we hear the sounds Aydan's climaxing breathing over it as it goes into the next day.
Reception & "Curse".
The film is also considered one of the worst films in Turkey and cursed. However, the rumors of the film's "curse" are one of the main reasons for its surprising success. One can probably connect this rumor's start with the event of the theater burning down on opening night.

Surprise, the first American naval ship of the name, was a sloop purchased by the Continental Navy in 1777 and commanded by Captain Benjamin Dunn.
"Surprise" was ordered in April 1777 to join brigantine and sloop in clearing the Cape May channel of British ships.
"On May 2nd, the Harwich packet Prince of Orange was taken in the English Channel by the USS Surprise, Captain Gustavus Conyngham. The latter vessel had been bought at Folkestone, and, with glaring disregard of French neutrality, had been equipped at Dunkirk. On the Surprise's return to Dunkirk, the prize was seized and restored to Britain, though it was believed at the time, not without some reason, that the British Government, anxious to avoid a dispute with France, had purchased from Conyngham his capture."

2002–03 New Orleans Hornets season

The 2002–03 New Orleans Hornets season was the franchise's fifteenth season in the National Basketball Association, and their first in New Orleans. Decades after the Jazz relocated to Utah, the NBA returned to New Orleans as the Hornets left Charlotte. Ironically, the Hornets first game in New Orleans was against the Utah Jazz; Baron Davis led the team to a 100–75 victory. The franchise won their first 10 games at home on the way to a 17–7 start. A midseason injury to Baron Davis resulted in a 13 game stretch from mid December to mid January, where the club went 3–13. At the trade deadline the Hornets acquired Kenny Anderson from the Seattle SuperSonics, as Davis was hampered all season with a back injury. With help from Anderson, the Hornets won seven of their last ten games on the way to finishing with a strong record of 47-35, allowing the team to qualify for their fourth straight playoff appearance. They faced the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round, but were eliminated in six games.
Draft picks.
The Hornets had a no draft picks in 2002.
Playoffs.
At the start of the playoffs, Baron Davis would struggle with back pain. Jamal Mashburn would suffer a dislocated finger in Game 2 of the first round series against the Philadelphia 76ers. The Hornets would force a 6th game, but Davis and Mashburn played hurt. The 76ers would eliminate the Hornets in the sixth game. After the season, the Hornets would stun their fans and most experts by firing Coach Paul Silas.

Dolly Gray

William Denton "Dolly" Gray (December 4, 1878 in Houghton, Michigan – April 4, 1956 in Yuba City, California) was a left-handed professional baseball pitcher who played from 1909 to 1911 for the Washington Senators. One source says he was born in Ishpeming, Michigan.
Before the big leagues.
Dolly Gray began his professional career during or before the 1902 season. In 1902, he pitched for the Los Angeles Angels of the old California League. Following the 1902 season, the Angels joined to the Pacific Coast League, and in 1903 they had one of the greatest seasons in minor league baseball history. Gray went 23–20 with a 3.55 ERA that season. In 1904, Gray went 24–26, in 1905, he went 30–16, in 1906, he went 7–2 (during the 1906 season, Gray and many other West Coast players left to play on the East Coast after the great 1906 San Francisco earthquake, in 1907 he went 32–14 and in 1908 he went 26–11. He played in one game in 1909, winning it. In 1905 and 1907, he led the league in winning percentage.
Major league baseball.
A 30-year-old rookie, Gray made his major league debut on April 13, 1909. He made 36 appearances in his rookie season, starting 26 of those games. He we 5–19 with 19 complete games. That year, he led the league in earned runs allowed (87), was third in losses, seventh in walks allowed (77) and eighth in appearances. Gray gave up Tris Speaker's first big league home run on May 3 of that year,
In 1910, Gray went 8–19 with a 2.63 ERA. He was second in the league in losses that year, fifth in wild pitches (9), ninth in earned runs allowed (67) and ninth in hit batsmen (10).
On April 12, 1911, Gray threw the very first pitch in Griffith Stadium history. He also won the game that day, beating opposing pitcher Smoky Joe Wood. That would be one of only two wins for Gray in 1912 - overall that season, he went 2–13 with a 5.06 ERA. His ten wild pitches that season were fourth most in the league, and his ten games finished were eighth most in the league. Gray played in his final major league game on September 29, 1911.
Gray went 15–51 with a 3.52 ERA in his three-year career. His .227 winning percentage is one of the worst all-time among pitchers with at least 50 career decisions. As a batter, Gray was pretty solid for a pitcher - he hit .202 in 218 big league at bats. 
Statistically, Gray is most similar to Blondie Purcell, according to the Similarity Scores at Baseball-Reference.com.
Post-big league career.
Following his major league career, Gray pitched in the Pacific Coast league from 1912 to 1913, retiring after the 1913 season. He played for the Vernon Tigers and Oakland Oaks in that time.
Following his death, he was buried in Sutter Cemetery in Sutter, California.
In 2008, Gray was inducted into the Pacific Coast League Hall of Fame, along with Wheezer Dell, Casey Stengel and Lee Susman.
The nickname.
Gray got his nickname Dolly from the 19th century song Nellie Gray, composed by Benjamin Hanby. One line in the song goes "darling Nellie Gray, they have taken you away". His teammates mangled and distorted it "darling" and it became "Dolly."
Another source says his nickname came from the song Goodbye, Dolly Gray.

King's College School, Cambridge

King's College School is a coeducational independent preparatory school in Cambridge, England, situated on West Road off Grange Road, west of the city centre. It was founded to educate the choristers in the King's College Choir during the 15th century. Although no longer located on College grounds, it remains an integral part of the Chapel's musical tradition and is still governed by and receives some funding from the College.
History.
King's College School was founded in 1441 by King Henry VI to educate the sixteen choristers who sing the services in the college chapel. The school is an integral part of King’s College and the Provost of King’s is its chair of governors. The school governors are appointed by King’s College and include both a number of King’s fellows and those recruited from beyond the college. It moved to its current site in 1878. From 1976 girls were admitted, and as the school expanded, it opened a pre-preparatory department.
Curriculum.
Pupils are taught Art, Design and Technology, Classics, English, Geography, History, ICT, Mathematics, Modern Foreign Languages, Music, Religious Education, Physical Education and Science.
Boarding.
The boarding programme is open only to boys. Choristers are full boarders while other boys return home for the weekend.
Extracurricular Activities.
Music.
King's College School has had a strong tradition in music due to its heritage as a choral foundation school. The sixteen choirboys of the college choir audition at about age 7 (Year 2). Those who successfully pass will gain scholarships to study at the school. The choir features annually in the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols service held in the college chapel and broadcast live on BBC Radio.
Other pupils have the opportunity to join the two chamber choirs, jazz ensemble and orchestra.
Heads.
The following men have served as head teachers at the school since 1878 when it relocated to its present site in West Road:
Recent Developments.
2009 ISI Inspection.
In 2009 the school faced an emergency unannounced Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI) inspection following complaints from a parent. On 30 October 2009, the School was served with a Statutory Notice to produce an Action Plan. The Times Educational Supplement reported that the ISI had found shortcomings in the school's security and recruitment procedures, and that 'inspection described its anti-bullying, child protection and discipline policies as "inadequate in various areas"'. In particular, the school's designated child protection officer was no longer employed there.
In an email to a Cambridgeshire MP, Nick Gibb MP, Minister for State (Schools) Education, in response to a parliamentary question, confirmed that the ISI "rarely makes unannounced visits". In a follow up inspection six months later, the school received a "glowing" inspection report in 2010 from the Independent Schools Inspectorate.
Freedom of Information Act.
Following a ruling by the Information Commissioner in October 2010, the school is subject to the Freedom of Information Act. This is believed to be the first case where a private school has been subject to the Freedom of Information Act.
In a series of Decision Notices, the Information Commissioner ruled that the school should be considered as part of King's College and therefore subject to the Freedom of Information Act.

Christopher Manson

Christopher Manson is a children's book author and illustrator noted for his use of traditional hand tools to painstakingly make the pine woodcuts that fill his several highly acclaimed works.
Background.
Born in Buffalo, New York, Manson graduated in 1975 from the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in Halifax, Nova Scotia, having specialized in printmaking. He also obtained a Master of Fine Arts from the State University of New York at New Paltz (SUNY New Paltz).
He returned to Buffalo, where he took a job at a local arts council in arts management, a position that required fundraising skills. "It wasn't for me," he later recalled. "I figured out that I was tired of helping others make their art."
Career.
After illustrating a friend's cookbook, he published the phenomenally popular children's book, "" (1985), issued by the major publishing house Henry Holt and Company. The book promised a $10,000 award to whoever solved the book's many visual puzzles, and even though the contest has long since ended, the book remains in print, and eventually was reissued in a CD-ROM format.
His other books include "A Farmyard Song" (1992), "The Tree in the Wood" (1993), "Over the River and through the Wood" (1998), "Good King Wenceslas" (1994). He has also illustrated books for other authors, including J. Patrick Lewis' "Black Swan/White Crow" (2007), W. Nikola-Lisa's "Till Year's Good End" (1997), and Delno C. West and Jean M. West's "Uncle Sam and Old Glory" (2000).
Manson summed up his approach to his authoring and illustrating children's books like so: "What I'm really after is the perfect book. The kind where you just can't imagine the words without the pictures, or the pictures without the words . . . like ["Winnie-the-Pooh" author A. A.] Milne. But there aren't that many out there to point to as perfect. I'm constantly working toward it." He added, "Even if I won the 40 million dollar lottery, I'd still do this — I'd have a fancier studio, but I'd still do this."
Manson lives in Rockville, Maryland.

2002–03 Syracuse Orangemen basketball team

The 2002–03 Syracuse Orangemen basketball team represented Syracuse University in NCAA men's basketball competition in the 2002–03 Division I season. (At that time, "Orangemen" was exclusively used to refer to Syracuse men's teams; women's teams were known as "Orangewomen".) The Head Coach was Jim Boeheim, serving for his 27th year. The team played its home games at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse, New York. The team finished with a 30–5 (13–3) record, while capturing its first modern-era NCAA Championship.
The team had just one senior, guard Kueth Duany. He was joined in the starting lineup by forwards Hakim Warrick (sophomore), Carmelo Anthony (freshman), center Craig Forth (sophomore), and guard Gerry McNamara (freshman). Other key contributors included guards Josh Pace (sophomore) and Billy Edelin (freshman), and center Jeremy McNeil (junior).Donald Thomas(freshman) 
Season recap.
Things did not start well for Syracuse. Guards DeShaun Williams and James Thues both left the team. Williams transferred to Iona while Thues left for Detroit. Freshman point guard Billy Edelin was suspended for 12 games for participating in a non-sanctioned basketball league. Syracuse then started its season with a loss against Memphis, despite Carmelo Anthony's 27 points, a then-high for a Syracuse freshman debut.
But things turned around, as Syracuse went 13–3 in the Big East, with several memorable wins. McNamara would establish himself as a clutch player, nailing a game-winning 3-pointer as then-No. 17 Syracuse notched an 82–80 win over then-No. 10 Notre Dame in February. In an upset of then-No. 24 Syracuse over then-No. 2 Pittsburgh, McNeil, a career 49.1% free throw shooter, hit two key free throws, and added a game-winning tip in a 67–65 upset.
The Orangemen would play five Big 12 teams throughout the year, including games against Missouri in the regular season, and against Oklahoma (Elite Eight), Oklahoma State (second round), Texas (National Semifinal) and then Kansas (National Championship game).
In the championship game against Kansas, with Syracuse leading by three with under 15 seconds left, Warrick missed two free throws that would've sealed the game with Syracuse hanging on to a three-point lead, 81–78. With 1.5 seconds left and the score still the same, Kansas' Michael Lee was open on the baseline for a potential game-tying 3-pointer. But Warrick used his long arms to block Lee's attempt and Syracuse captured its first ever national championship.
Coincidentally, the game was played in Super Dome in New Orleans, where Syracuse had lost the National Championship to Indiana in 1987 on a last second shot by Keith Smart.

<doc id="18290762" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18290762" title="Brügger &amp; Thomet APR">
Brügger &amp; Thomet APR

The APR (Advanced Precision Rifle) is family of Swiss sniper rifles designed in 2003 as a further evolution of the French PGM Précision rifles by the Thun-based Brügger & Thomet (B&T or B+T) company.
History.
B+T was at that time a long-time distributor of PGM rifles, and in 2003 competed in a tender to sell the French-made but Swiss modified rifle to the Singapore Army, which at the time was planning to acquire a new 7.62mm precision rifle. After some confusing communication with PGM Précision over who had the rights to sell the PGM 7.62mm sniper rifle to the Singaporean Army, Brügger & Thomet decided in 2003 to improve the PGM rifle and produce the new design at their own manufacturing facility in Switzerland. The Brügger & Thomet APR308 sniper rifle was first presented to the public at the 2005 Milipol exhibition and since then has been adopted as a standard sniper rifle by the Singapore Army. 
The APR's main commercial competitors/equivalents on the high-end factory sniper rifle market are beside the PGM Précision product line, the Accuracy International Arctic Warfare and Sako TRG product lines. All these rifles are comparable performance-wise.
Design details.
Features.
The APR system is a purpose-designed modular sniper rifle system, rather than an accurized version of an existing, general-purpose rifle. According to the manufacturer, although being a precision-instrument, the APR system will resist harsh military use and remain functional in typical operational environments.
The heart of the APR is a metal lower receiver that functions as a main frame or chassis to which all other rifle components are assembled or attached. The manual ambidextrous safety is integrated into the lower receiver. This chassis houses the upper receiver which consists of a bolt group and barrel, as well as the fire control group, folding butt stock and other furniture. The contact surface between upper and lower receiver functions as an unconventional bedding surface.
The upper receiver consists of a housing, in which a locking ring is permanently fixed, and a Picatinny rail as an interface to the rifle scope. Integrated in this scope mount rail is the rear part of the emergency iron sight, designed as factory zeroed flip-up sight. Into the above mentioned locking ring, the bolt locks by rotation; thus, the receiver with locking ring, bolt and barrel form the breech of the rifle. The APR rifle has a traditional manually operated rotary bolt with three radial locking lugs at the front. The bolt requires only a 60° bolt rotation; both features should be appreciated by the shooter during multiple firings that require rapid projectile placement on the target. 
The trigger group, manual safety and pistol grip consist of one detachable module attached under the receiver. This group consists of a fully adjustable two-stage trigger featuring an adjustable trigger pull weight of 1.5 to 2.5 kg (3 to 5 lb) and a trigger path that can be externally adjusted without disassembly of the unit. An ambidextrous manual safety is conveniently located above the pistol grip. The APR308 has a side-folding stock which is attached to the lower receiver with a rugged steel hinge. It offers an adjustable butt plate and length of pull spacer system. The cheek-rest is also fully adjustable. These adjustment options allow shooters of various sizes and shapes to tailor the APR folding stock to their personal preferences, which is an uncommon feature for folding stocks. An additional folding height-adjustable monopod is attached to the rear of the buttstock and allows the shooter to rest the rifle during extended periods of observation.
A weapon's stock is made of a polymer material and is attached to the lower receiver. It has provisions for mounting a folding height-adjustable bipod. The APR feed system consists of a detachable 10-round stainless steel box magazine. When the magazine is empty, it stops the forward motion of the bolt. The magazine feeds through the lower receiver into the upper receiver and is held by a magazine catch, which is integrated into the trigger group.
Barrel.
The free-floating forged fluted barrels have appropriate attachments for a factory-provided steel muzzle brake that carries the front part of the emergency sight, which therefore never has to be removed. The muzzle brake's effectiveness is rated at a recoil reduction of 40%. It also serves as a mounting point for a quick-detachable sound suppressor and includes a thread protector to protect the thread if no suppressor is attached. The APR308 barrel accuracy life is estimated at approximately 7,000 rounds.
At its chamber end, the barrel becomes screwed into the receiver and presses into the upper receiver's locking ring. For the .308 Winchester chambering, the 280 mm (1:11 in) right-hand rifling twist rate with four grooves was selected over the 305 mm (1:12 in) twist traditionally used with .308 Winchester ammunition, as a compromise when switching between supersonic and subsonic cartridges and facilitating the use of 7.62mm projectiles up to 19.96 g (200 gr).
Sights.
Every APR rifle is equipped with a MIL-STD-1913 rail on top of the upper receiver for mounting components to accommodate different types of optical or electro-optical sights, with the option to mount three extra rails on the stock for attaching tactical accessories. The rifle can be equipped with an optional folding front sight and an aperture-type rear sight. Iron sights cannot be mounted on integrally silenced APR models. Brügger & Thomet offers a proprietary TRS (Tactical Rifle Scope) telescopic sight for the APR. The TRS is a Schmidt & Bender PMII 3-12x50 LP scope with a proprietary stadiametric rangefinding reticle layout made exclusively for Brügger & Thomet. The TRS scope is meant to be mounted with a Brügger & Thomet mounting set consisting of two scope rings, where the front ring provides an adaptor for Simrad KN night sights. Those rings are attached to a Picatinny interface on the rifle's upper receiver. The scope and mount are clamped on the rifle's Picatinny rail by the tension of two levers, allowing the operator to quickly remove the scope in case of failure or while cleaning or during transit. Detaching and attaching the scope repeatedly will not affect the zero. APR rifles can be equipped with an anti-mirage band to suppress mirage caused by air heated by a warm barrel during extended training sessions.
Ammunition.
The APR308 is chambered to fire the .308 Winchester cartridge as well as its military equivalent—the 7.62x51mm NATO cartridge (that has slightly different chamber specifications and a lower maximum chamber pressure compared to the .308 Winchester). The APR308 system is designed to handle cartridges up to in overall length.
With recommended ammunition the APR308's accuracy should be ≤ 1 MOA at any practical range. Brügger & Thomet specifies the rifle provides a 99% or better first hit probability against a head-sized target at 400 m and torso-sized target at 800 m. The specified maximum effective range with appropriate ammunition (RUAG Swiss P 10.87 g (168 gr) recommended for mid-range applications up to 600 m, Norma Diamond Line 12.31 g (190 gr)—recommended for long range applications up to 1,000 m), Lapua D46 12 g (185 gr) (suitable for military applications)) is 1,000 meters.
Accessories.
As a manufacturer of firearm sound suppressors, Brügger & Thomet also offers quick-detachable suppressors for the APR series. The APR308 GRS suppressor reduces the acoustical report of the weapon by 36 dB(A) and also reduces the optical muzzle signature.
Other accessories supplied with the rifle include a lightweight soft case for transporting the APR to the shooting range, a triple rail interface which fits to the weapon's chassis without any modification and provides three additional Picatinny rails that can be used to mount night vision equipment other than Simrad, laser aiming/designation devices or illumination tools.
Variants.
The APR308 is available in several specialized variants. The APR308P was designed for tactical police applications and has a shorter, barrel with a different muzzle device. The rifle is to be used exclusively with optical sights, as the iron sights were removed. The rifle also lacks a drop safety, present in the standard, military version and because of the reduced barrel – the effective range has dropped to 600 m. 
A sound-suppressed version of the APR308 is the APR308S with a barrel and integral sound suppressor. This model too is not fitted with back-up iron sights or a drop safety device and can only be used with subsonic ammunition (200–240 gr projectiles).
The APR308 rifle was also used to develop a larger variant intended for use at extended ranges. The APR338 chambered for the .338 Lapua Magnum round was first introduced at the 2007 Milipol exhibition in Paris and became available in 2008. The APR338 system is designed to handle cartridges up to overall length.
The APR338 is intended as a military long range anti-personnel rifle. Brügger & Thomet specifies the rifle provides a 99% or higher first hit probability against a head-sized target up to 600 m or a torso-sized target at 1,300 m with appropriate ammunition (Lapua Scenar 250 grain recommended). The rifle's barrel has an unconventional 279 mm (1:11 in) right-hand twist rate, optimized for firing .338-calibre very-low-drag bullets up to 16.85 g (260 gr). Longer, heavier very-low-drag bullets like the Sierra HPBT MatchKing .338-calibre 19.44 g (300 gr) can be used, but require a 254 mm (1:10 in) twist rate to stabilize them under high air density conditions as found on arctic coasts. The APR338 barrel accuracy life is estimated at 2,500 rounds. The rifle can be employed with a APR338 GRS suppressor, which reduces the acoustical signature by up to 25 dB(A).

Brent White

Brent White is an American film editor with over 10 editing credits on feature films dating from 1993. Since 2004, White has worked on six successive comedy films produced or co-produced by Judd Apatow, and directed by Apatow or Adam McKay.
White's work as an editor on the films directed by Apatow and McKay is unusual because of the importance of the actors' improvisations. Eric Melin's review of the film "Talladega Nights" (2006) focuses on this aspect of White's editing, "the MVP of the movie is most definitely editor Brent White. Just as he did with 2004's "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," White had to choose the best scenes from hours and hours of wildly different takes to fashion together something with a narrative arc that resembles a movie. It can't be easy work, but he had a little more story to work with than he did in the uneven "Anchorman." Minor continuity errors be damned, "Talladega Nights" is one funny film."
The editing of "Knocked Up" (2007) was described in a feature article by Stephen Rodrick in "The New York Times". Rodrick emphasizes the many different versions of the film that were created before deciding on the version that was released, "By the end of last month, when the final edit was done, I had seen five or six versions of "Knocked Up." While the arc of the film remained the same, seemingly every line had been traded in and out..."
White received his bachelor's degree in film production from the BYU College of Fine Arts and Communications (Brigham Young University) in 1983.
Brent is currently cutting "the Other Guys" McKay which will premiere this summer. He is married and has four children. He lives in the Los Angeles area.

The 52nd parallel north is a circle of latitude that is 52 degrees north of the Earth's equatorial plane. It crosses Europe, Asia, the Pacific Ocean, North America, and the Atlantic Ocean.
In Canada, part of the generally-accepted border between Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador is defined by the parallel, though Quebec maintains a dormant claim to some of the territory north of this line.
The catchment area of London, the capital city of England and the United Kingdom, can be broadly defined by the 51st and 52nd parallels.
At this latitude the sun is visible for 16 hours, 44 minutes during the summer solstice and 7 hours, 45 minutes during the winter solstice.
Around the world.
Starting at the Prime Meridian (just west of the village of Barkway in Hertfordshire, England) and heading eastwards, the parallel 52° north passes through:

17 cm K (E)

The 17 cm Kanone in Eisenbahnlafette (17 cm K (E)) was a German railroad gun used in the Second World War.
Design & History.
This weapon was designed with the intent of replacing the 15 cm K (E) mounted on the same carriage, although only 6 were built before it was realized that both guns were too small to justify railroad mounts. The gun was mounted on a simple pivot mount on a ballrace on a well-base flatcar with four outriggers. In action the outriggers and their jacks would be dropped to stabilize the gun and absorb the firing recoil. In addition jacks locked the spring suspension, bore on the surface of the rails and screw clamps gripped the rails for more stability. The elderly 17 cm Schnelladekanone L/40 was used because it was available in some numbers, having been designed as the casemate gun for the predreadnought battleships. It fired a 17 cm Sprgr L/4.7 KZ mit Hb shell weighing . This was a standard HE shell with a nose fuze beneath a ballistic cap. 
They spent the war assigned to Artillerie-Batteries 717 and 718 (E) along the Channel coast.

Ballerina Ballroom Cinema of Dreams

The Ballerina Ballroom Cinema Of Dreams is a Scottish film festival founded by actress Tilda Swinton. The inaugural event took place in a ballroom in Nairn in the Scottish Highlands between August 15 and 23 2008.
The Origins.
A while ago, on an impulse, a quixotic seizure, Tilda Swinton rented a ballroom in an old Victorian stone building in Nairn in the North East of Scotland, a seaside town where Charlie Chaplin used to holiday and which has a balmy microclimate and vistas across the Moray Firth to the Black Isle, Cromarty and Sutherland.
The ballroom is called the Ballerina. In the 60s and 70s Pink Floyd, The Who and Cream (band) played there. The ballroom in nearby Elgin was called The Red Shoes.
After renting the Ballerina, Swinton took Mark Cousins to see the place – they were making a wee film about being 8½ and falling in love with cinema – and he loved it and so, together, they dreamt up a festival of beanbags on the floor, that would run 8½ days, that would be a 6 out of 10 on the grunge scale, that would serve home-made cakes and fish finger sandwiches, whose tickets would be £3/£2,or free if you took a tray of home-baking, and that would transform the Ballerina into something like a ghost train.

Luan Da

Luan Da (died 112 BC; ; Pinyin: Luán Dà; Wade-Giles: Luan Ta) was a religious figure during the early Han Dynasty from the state of Yue. He professed to know the secret to immortality and be able to communicate with spiritual beings. Possessing the gift of gab and adept at confidence tricks, Luan Da gained the favour of Emperor Wu of Han, also known as Han Wudi. In the space of a few months, he rose from a commoner to great influence, holding titles and land, and marrying one of the emperor's daughters. However, he could not fulfill his promise to Emperor Wu, failing to produce a means to immortality. He gradually lost the emperor's favour and went on a purported visit to immortals; however, he was eventually captured and executed. At the apex of his career, many of his fellow mystics held him up as their role model and sought to emulate him. His death was a sign of the trade's fall from favour; laws were passed to restrict the practice of mediumship, even penalising those who married its practitioners.
Background.
Cultural background.
In early imperial China (the Qin and Han Dynasties), religion centered around the realms of "shen" (spirits) and "yin" (shadow). These realms were considered sacred, and religious figures attempted to contact their inhabitants through elaborate ceremonies in which the perceptions of the practitioner and audience were blurred through the use of smoke, incense, and music. Other practices were also employed to further manipulate the practitioner's senses. For example, a chief priest would fast and meditate before he performed a sacrifice. The deprivation of food was thought to make him more susceptible to perceive "shen", "yin", and other phenomena within the smoke during the ritual. During the Han Dynasty, alleged mediums would fall into trances or perform ritual dances to accomplish supernatural feats. Some of these events were documented in the "Shi jing" ("Canon of Odes"), written in the Zhou Dynasty.
Han Wudi.
Emperor Han Wudi was a superstitious man, and believed that he could attain good health and immortality through spiritual means. One such method involved collecting morning dew on a platter and mixing crushed jade with it to form a "spiritual dew". The emperor routinely drank this "spiritual dew" and only stopped after he fell severely ill from it.
The emperor employed several men who claimed to be able to produce elixirs of immortality or who could communicate with spiritual beings. Shaoweng, the court mystic who preceded Luan Da and had studied under the same teacher, performed a ritual that was exposed to be a fraud. Embarrassed that he had been tricked, the emperor ordered Shaoweng's execution and kept quiet about the affair. Shaoweng purportedly died from consuming horse liver, which was thought to be poisonous at the time. Later, Emperor Wu reconsidered Shaoweng's fraud, wondering if perhaps some of his mystical arts had been genuine. The emperor realized that his chance for immortality might have passed with Shaoweng's execution, and began to search for a new mystic.
Career.
Early life.
Not much is known about Luan Da's early life, only that he was born in Yue and was the eldest child in his family. Records do not even reveal his full name; the "Da" (大; big) simply signified his seniority over his siblings. It was conventional at the time to omit surnames for minor figures in the annals of Chinese history, and thus this is not unusual.
Rise to power.
The state of Yue was renowned for its mediums, and Luan Da was a fine example. The "Shih ji" ("Records of the Grand Historian") described him as "tall and a brilliant speaker", who was "fertile in techniques" and a master of esoteric arts, such as shadow play. He was originally a mystic in the court of the emperor's brother, Liu Ji, the Prince of Jiao Dong. Liu Ji's wife had mentioned Luan Da to her brother, the Marquess of Lecheng, Dingyi. Trying to boost his standing with Emperor Wu, Dingyi told the emperor of Shaoweng's far more capable fellow disciple, Luan Da, in 113 BC.
Upon their meeting, Emperor Wu inquired into Luan Da and his teacher's powers. In response, Luan Da boasted that he had met immortals. He also claimed that with enough stature and skill, one could create gold, manufacture a means to achieve immortality, dam the Yellow River, and become an immortal. Luan Da then expressed concern at how Shaoweng had been killed, but the excited emperor assured him that the rumours of Shaoweng's execution were false. The emperor, in his enthusiasm, offered Luan Da anything if he would take Shaoweng's place and discover the secret of immortality from his allegedly immortal master. To this, Luan Da replied:
Remembering his experience with Shaoweng, the emperor turned cautious and tested Luan Da; he requested the mystic to display his power. Luan Da set down a chess board and, while chanting, caused the chess pieces to charge at one another. The emperor was reassured that Luan Da truly had power. The trick was achieved by coating the pieces in a mixture of rooster's blood, iron shavings, and "magnetic dust". In "Science and Civilisation in China" (1986), Joseph Needham discusses the details of this feat and proposed that lodestone was likely used: powdered magnetite would not have been very effective.
At that time, the Yellow River was flooding, causing widespread devastation to the people and the rice harvests. As Luan Da had claimed that he could dam the river, Emperor Wu felt that it would be wise to encourage the mystic to take up the task by quickly pleasing him. The emperor granted Luan Da the title of the General of Five Boons, and almost as an afterthought, three other such titles: the General of Heavenly Practitioners, the General of the Earth Practitioners, and General Grand Communicator. Emperor Wu also lavished gifts on him; he was granted the marquisate of Letong, giving him some 2,000 households to rule over, and the emperor also gave him a luxurious mansion, a thousand servants, opulent transportation, many decorations, a seal labelled "General of Heavenly Way", and even the hand in marriage of Princess Wei Zifu, the emperor's eldest daughter, accompanied by a dowry estimated at 10,000 catties of gold. The emperor himself, along with envoys, members of the royal family, and high-ranking officials often invited Luan Da to dine or paid him house calls merely to ask how he was doing. With his marquisate and five generalships, Luan Da had become a man of great standing only a few months after his introduction to the emperor. He was no longer merely Emperor Wu's subject, but an envoy of the immortal beings with status equal to the emperor.
In possession of these newly-bestowed honours, Luan Da spent every evening at home, attempting to summon spirits. According to the "Shih ji", no spirits appeared, but only "a multitude of ghosts who gathered around". These, the text claims, he was able to command. The "Shih ji"'s author, Sima Qian, was scornful of Luan Da, noting that "Everyone on the seacoast of Yan and Qi began waving their arms about, declaring that they possessed secret arts and could summon spirits and immortal ones." Indeed, Luan Da's dramatic growth in reputation and stature became a great topic of discussion in the Han capital of Chang'an, and mystics were eager to imitate his success.
Fall from power and death.
By the summer after his elevation, Luan Da had forgotten the emperor's request for an audience with the immortals. Emperor Wu, anxious to achieve immortality, sent an envoy to remind his court mystic of his task. Luan Da attempted to delay, but eventually realised he had to appease the emperor and allay his suspicions. The mystic decided to put on an act of journeying to meet the immortals. With a group of followers, he travelled to Shandong. Emperor Wu, however, was already suspicious, and sent a spy to follow Luan Da.
The spy followed the court mystic to Mount Tai, where he performed a ritual with his followers, although no one saw any immortals. Luan Da ordered his followers to stay behind while he went ahead to meet the immortals, telling them that the spiritual beings would not descend to meet with lowly servants. The spy tailed Luan Da as he went forth alone, but only saw the mystic walk along the beach. Luan Da returned to his group and reported that he had seen his immortal master and that they were to report back to the emperor. Angered by Luan Da's deceit, the spy rushed back to the capital before the mystic to inform Emperor Wu. The emperor, incensed at Luan Da's confidence tricks, decided to play along when the mystic returned to see what lies he would tell.
When Luan Da returned, he told the emperor of his falsified meeting with the immortals; however, he sensed that the emperor did not believe him. Before long, the emperor broke out in a rage, ordering Luan Da to tell what he had actually done. Dumbfounded, Luan Da attempted to continue his lies; however, the emperor called for the spy to come forth and expose the lies. Lost for words, Luan Da was arrested on Emperor Wu's order, and executed by having his body chopped into two at the waist. The emperor extended his fury to the Marquess of Lecheng for introducing Luan Da, having him beheaded and his body then defiled.
Later in the Han Dynasty, mystics like Luan gradually lost their influence as the rulers passed many laws against them. Mediums were not allowed to barter their crafts alongside roads, and some were even forbidden to make a living at such a craft at all. Those married to shamans were not even allowed to hold government office, though this law was often bypassed. Luan Da's fall signaled the beginning of the end for these mystics.

Terra Deva

Terra McNair Deva is an American musician. She is Terra McNair who used to be on seasons 4-5 of "The Disney Channel's Mickey Mouse Club", and has had continued success as a solo and collaborative artist.
Terra was born in Northern California. She now lives part time in California, NYC, and London.
Early Career.
Her unusual pubescent workaholic ethic landed first real job starring in the TV show "The Mickey Mouse Club" for two seasons. She sang, acted, danced and interviewed celebrities five days a week. At 16 she freaked out as most child TV actors do and insisted on leaving "MMC" in search of something a little less Disney. So naturally Terra started going to raves and clubs around 1993. After meeting several British DJs and producers in the scene she started traveling back and forth to the UK to write and do small shows. She also did jazz shows, funk shows, TV and radio commercials and industrial films back in San Francisco.
Influences.
Terra was immersed in Prince, Al Green, Bob Marley, Joni Mitchell, Cocteau Twins, PJ Harvey, Tori Amos, Björk, Seal, Joyce, Lenny Kravitz and Nick Drake. She was also into the Brand New Heavies and Deee Lite and all of the underground vinyl you would hear on the dance floor. She wanted to create music as life changing as the artists that were changing her. 
Successful singles.
Terra's most successful singles so far are "At Night" with Shakedown – went to 6 in the UK and top 10 all over Europe, "Sting Me Red (Clever)" with Who Da Funk, 32 UK "How You Thrill Me" with Junior Jack and Erick Morillo - 27 UK and "Less Talk More Action" with Tim Deluxe. These songs have taken her all over the world from Sydney to Serbia.
Pulled Apart.
Her first solo album was called "Pulled Apart" on Om Records (1998). It was inspired by DJ mix tapes and attempted to sound like Portishead recording R&B after meeting Nancy Wilson and all of them clubbing in Nottingham with Björk and Grooverider's love child. The press liked it despite the fact that it was all weepy telling tales of getting dumped and finding the joys of self-help programs.
House classics.
The singles that are considered classics to the house heads are "Soothe" and "Want Me Like Water" as Furry Phreaks with Charles Webster (Presence and Love From San Francisco) "Fresh Start" (DJ Iz remix ) and "Inside" from "Pulled Apart" (Om album) also attracted global attention, were licensed for a few ads, and made joining BMI worthwhile.
Collaborations.
Terra Deva has worked with Shakedown, Charles Webster (Furry Phreaks, Love From San Francisco, Presence), LCD Soundsystem, Erick Morillo, Tim Deluxe, Who Da Funk, Satoshi Tomeii, J Majik, Pete Moss, Jimmy Van M (Vantage Point), Junior Jack, Harry Choo Choo Romero, AK 1200, Scott Hardkiss, Dave Biegel (Bugs, Puracane, Skyjuice), Josh Michaels (DJ Iz) and many more.
All Over the World.
Her latest single is "All Over The World" with Furry Phreaks out now on Defected Records. The song is a great big thank you to all the people who have supported the music Charles and Terra created for over 10 years. And she appear on the LCD Soundsystem single 45:33(DFA) Rumor has it little D&B gems she did with JMajik are also floating around.
Recent history.
Terra's latest musical adventures are getting some finishing touches while her acting career is back in full swing.

Moneyfacts

Moneyfacts Group PLC is a financial information company founded in 1988 based in Norwich in the United Kingdom employing over 100 people.
History.
Moneyfacts was founded in 1988 by current Chairman John Woods. It was first launched as a six page monthly fact sheet about personal finance products. This expanded to become a range of three magazines (covering personal and business financial products as well as investment, life and pensions products), a price comparison website, mortgage, savings and unsecured lending treasury reports and IT systems. The brand has grown rapidly and is now known throughout the UK as an independent and unbiased source of financial information.
Product Chronology.
Moneyfacts Magazine - first published in 1988;
Business Moneyfacts Magazine - first published in 1994;
Investment Life & pensions - first published in 1996;
Moneyfacts.co.uk - launched in 2000;
eMoneyfacts - launched in 2004;
Moneyfacts Data Screen - launched in 2005.
Current activities.
Moneyfacts' main activities are:
Controversies.
In 2004, its rival Moneysupermarket.com paid Moneyfacts £3.9 million in an out of court settlement to settle a dispute of alleged intellectual property theft. At the time, Moneysupermarket was going public at a price between £864 million and £1.05 billion, and it was thought best to resolve the issue beforehand. + 
In 2007, the "best buy" tables used in the UK press were criticised by Mike Lazenby, the then 'maverick'() CEO of the Kent Reliance Building Society for not reflecting the products which offered the best long term value, with Moneyfacts bearing the brunt of the criticism. The main objections were: + 
- *At that time Moneyfacts charged a £11,000 yearly fee to its subscribers, and did not always list non-subscribers in its best buy tables. This is no longer the case. 
- *It was possible for products to boost their position in best buy tables by offering short term introductory bonuses. This is no longer the case. 
Remedy;
A historic issue was that some non-subscribers tended not to volunteer their data within the time frame required. Today, with the benefit of more widely available digital data, Moneyfacts no longer excludes any non-subcribers from its Best Buy tables. If they are the best in class, they will appear. To resolve the issue of product providers manipulating submissions by introductory bonuses, Moneyfacts now produces its tables in versions with and without these bonuses.
Subsequently, in 2013, Moneyfacts were praised in the Sunday Times() which highlighted that Moneyfacts.co.uk always lists the genuine best buy products for its customers regardless of any financial arrangements with product providers, whilst other comparison websites were found to purely recommend financial products on a commercial basis.

411th Engineer Brigade (United States)

The 411th Engineer Brigade (Theater Army) is a combat engineer brigade of the United States Army headquartered in New Windsor, New York. It is a major engineer command of the United States Army Reserve.
Tracing its lineage back to the 355th Engineer Regiment, the brigade assumed its predecessor's campaign participation credit and honors, which were received fighting in the European Theater of World War II. The reserve brigade did not participate in any Cold War era fighting, and only saw periodic moves to various army bases around New York State. After the Cold War, however, the brigade saw several deployments to the Middle East in a supporting role for US-led contingencies. These included Operation Desert Storm, Operation Joint Endeavor, Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.
Organization.
The 411th Engineer Brigade is a subordinate unit of the 412th Engineer Command and its Headquarters and Headquarters Company is stationed at New Windsor, New York. It contains two subordinate battalions and separate companies which are also reserve units. The 479th Engineer Battalion (Combat) (Mechanized) headquartered at Watertown, New York and the 854th Engineer Battalion located at Saugerties, New York are the Brigade's two principal components. Additionally, the Brigade commands the 306th Engineer Company in Farmingdale, New York and the 328th Engineer Company (Combat) (Heavy) of Northfield, New Jersey, and the 417th Engineer Company (Combat)(Heavy) in Bullville, New York.
History.
Origins.
The 411th Engineer Brigade traces its lineage back to the 355th Engineer Regiment, which was first constituted on 15 October 1921 in the Organized Reserves. The regiment was organized in January 1922 with its headquarters at Chapel Hill, North Carolina.
It was ordered into active duty military service on 1 September 1942 at Camp White, Oregon in preparation for deployment to Europe during World War II. During World War II, the regiment saw action in the European Theater, undertaking numerous bridging and mobility missions in Normandy, Northern France, the Rhineland and the Ardennes area. The Regiment was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation for its service during the war. After the war was over in 1945, the regiment remained in the country until it was inactivated on 17 June 1946 in Germany. A year later, on 27 May 1947 the regiment was reactivated with its Headquarters in Detroit, Michigan. It was again deactivated on 31 December 1948 in Detroit.
After the deactivation, the Regiment was broken up and its subordinate elements were redesignated. The regimental Headquarters and Headquarters Company and Service Company were reorganized on 25 February 1949 as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 411th Engineer Brigade, allowing them a larger staff with the ability to take command of more subordinate units. The regiment's 1st Battalion was reorganized and redesignated on 25 February 1949 as the 928th Engineer Construction Battalion. The 2nd Battalion was reorganized and redesignated on 15 March 1949 as the 929th Engineer Construction Battalion. The 3rd Battalion disbanded on 9 July 1953. The two separated battalions retained separate lineage from this point and the 355th Engineer Regiment ceased to exist.
Cold War years.
The 411th Engineer Brigade was activated on 14 March 1949 at New York City. It was reorganized on 22 December 1950 as the 411th Engineer Aviation Brigade. A few years later, the Organized Reserve Corps itself was redesignated as the Army Reserve, and the brigade was delegated to Reserve status. On 1 January 1957, the brigade was again redesignated as the 411th Engineer Brigade. On 31 January 1968, the brigade headquarters was relocated to Fort Tilden, New York.
For most of its operational existence, the brigade remained in Reserve status except for a few brief activations in the Active Duty force. It was ordered into active military service on 24 March 1970 at Fort Tilden, New York, before being reverted to reserve status two days later. The brigade received its distinctive unit insignia on 28 January 1971 and its shoulder sleeve insignia on 20 December 1973. On 3 January 1978 the brigade headquarters location was changed to Brooklyn, New York.
The brigade was again ordered into active duty to play a supporting role in the Gulf War in 1990. It officially switched to active service on 6 December 1990 at Brooklyn, New York. It participated in Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm and earned two campaign streamers for participation in the conflict. On 11 March 1991 it was released from active military service and reverted to reserve status. The next day, while still in the country, the brigade was one of numerous units thought to have been exposed to chemical agents released during the Khamisiyah Pit demolition. Much of the NATO invasion force in the country at the time is suspected to have been exposed to these agents. 
On 1 April 1996, the brigade relocated to New Windsor, New York. It provided engineer Support to Operation Joint Endeavor in Bosnia and Kosovo by augmenting the staff of the 412th Engineer Command, and by deploying the 139th and 141st Transportation Company Detachments to the region which were under the brigade's peacetime command and control.
Iraq War.
The Brigade was alerted for deployment to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in late 2005. In the summer of 2006, it trained for three months at Fort McCoy, Wisconsin to prepare. Its mission in Iraq was to integrate other smaller engineer units and provide engineer support to the other Army units operating in the country. The brigade headquarters took command of several other engineer battalions during this deployment. Among the units under brigade's control was the 502nd Engineer Battalion based in Hanau, Germany which worked on bridges around Baghdad, as well as the 875th Engineer Battalion of the Arkansas Army National Guard based at Camp Striker and the active duty 92nd Engineer Battalion. Also attached to the brigade's command was the Us Air Force's 557th Expeditionary RED HORSE Squadron, a contingent of Air Force engineers.
The brigade arrived in Iraq in September 2006. It assumed control of over 3,000 engineers from the US Army, US Navy, US Air Force and US Marine Corps, having taken over the duty from the 130th Engineer Brigade which was departing following the end of its deployment. During the deployment, the brigade had five principle duties: route clearance and sanitation, rapid crater repair, engineer support to the 3rd Infantry Division and other combat units, planning, design and construction of contingency operating bases, and command of tactical bridging assets. The first major project of the brigade after arriving in country in September 2006 was to assist Iraqi engineers in repairing and operating the run down and damaged water treatment plant at Al Bakir which provided a major source of fresh water from the Tigris River. The brigade allowed Iraqi engineers to lead this operation and played a supporting role in evaluating their work. One of the brigade's major projects was the construction of Forward Operating Base (FOB) Hammer, which was completed in just 45 days. The base required construction materials from all over the country as well as foreign materials brought to Camp Victory and Balad Air Base. The 411th Brigade's attached B CO 92nd EN BN soldiers focused primarily on land work, perimeter fences and ground fortifications totaling over nine kilometers, with a detachment from the RED HORSE USAF focused on construction of buildings and other "vertical" projects. After completion, the FOB had space for 4,000 soldiers, and was occupied by 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division.
After the completion of the FOB, 411th Engineer Brigade soldiers commenced construction on other facilities throughout Camp Liberty for other incoming Army units. At the same time, other units in the brigade were responsible for route clearance in the areas of Logistics Support Area Anaconda along routes used for military supply as well as civilian traffic. The brigade's soldiers used Buffalo mine protected vehicles to clear these routes of suspected Improvised Explosive Devices and other dangerous obstacles.
During this deployment, the brigade completed over 200 projects on every major Forward Operating Base in the country, and three major projects supporting the Iraq War troop surge of 2007. It completed over 400,000 kilometers of route clearance and blast hole repair using over 2,800 pieces of major equipment. The brigade headquarters returned home to New York in fall of 2007, after one year of deployment to Iraq.
Afghanistan War.
In 2012, the 411th EN Brigade was again activated and deployed to Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan to take command of theater-wide engineer operations. The brigade formed a task force dubbed "Joint Task Force Empire" and remained deployed in Afghanistan until March 2013 when it returned home to New York and was reverted to reserve status.

__NOTOC__
The Grigorovich M-11 (or Shchetinin M-11) was a Russian single-seat fighter flying boat designed by Dmitry Pavlovich Grigorovich and built by Shchetinin
Design and development.
Original conceived as a two-seater the prototype M-11 was built in 1916 at the Shchetinin factory in Petrograd. The M-11 was a biplane with a 100 hp (75 kW) Gnome Monosoupape rotary engine with a pusher propeller strut-mounted below the upper wing. The small number of two-seaters had a poor performance and were only used as trainers, Grigorovich developed a single-seat version powered a 110 hp (82 kW) Le Rhône engine and fitted with a forward firing machine gun in front of the cockpit. Originally 100 single-seat M-11s had been ordered but this was reduced to 60 as the aircraft had poor handling when landing or alighting on water.
The M-11 were operated from snow and ice with twin skis fitted under the forward fuselage and a single ski under the tailplane.
To improve the water handling an improved variant was developed as the M-12 which had a re-designed hull and reduced loaded weight. Although the climb to height was improved the forward speed was 5 mph (8 km/h) less than the M-11 consequentially only a few M-12s were built.

David Bale

David Charles Howard Bale (2 September 1941 – 30 December 2003) was a South African-born English entrepreneur and an environmentalist animal rights activist. He was the father of actor Christian Bale and the husband of Gloria Steinem.
Life and career.
Bale was born in South Africa to English parents. His father, Philip Bale, was a Royal Air Force pilot. Bale grew up in England, Egypt, and the Channel Islands. He worked as a commercial pilot and later ran a commuter airline in England. His business activities included marketing imported jeans and skateboards.
Bale was an activist for environmental and animal rights causes. He served as a board member of The Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund and the Ark Trust, which in 2002 became the Hollywood branch of the Humane Society of the United States. He also served as a board member for World Education, Inc., an international non-profit organization known for its work in educational development, located in Boston, Massachusetts, USA.
Marriage.
Bale was married three times. His first marriage to Sandra Kreunen in South Africa ended in 1964 after she filed for divorce when he returned to England to visit his mother. His second marriage to Jenny James in England also ended in divorce. He had a daughter, Erin Bale Kreunen, from the first marriage, and three children from his second marriage: Louise, Sharon, and Christian, the last of whom became a well-known actor.
On 3 September 2000, he married the feminist writer, journalist, activist, and political leader Gloria Steinem in a private ceremony in Oklahoma, USA. At the time of the marriage, Bale had been facing deportation after overstaying his visa. However, both Steinem and Bale denied that Bale's immigration status was the motivation for the wedding.
Steinem had in the past been critical of the institution of marriage, stating that "marriage was the model for slavery law in this country". She explained her change in attitude toward marriage, saying 'I didn't change. Marriage changed. We spent 30 years in the United States changing the marriage laws. If I had married when I was supposed to get married, I would have lost my name, my legal residence, my credit rating, many of my civil rights. That's not true anymore. It's possible to make an equal marriage'.
Death.
Bale died of brain lymphoma on December 30, 2003, at the age of 62.

2006–07 Syracuse Orange men's basketball team

The 2006–07 Syracuse Orange men's basketball team represented Syracuse University. The Head Coach was Jim Boeheim, serving for his 31st year. The team played its home games at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse, New York. The team finished with a 24–11 (10–6) record, while making it to the quarterfinal round of the NIT tournament. The team was led by its three seniors, Demetris Nichols, Darryl Watkins and Terrence Roberts. Also seeing time in the starting lineup was senior Matt Gorman, junior Josh Wright, sophomores Eric Devendorf and Andy Rautins and freshman Paul Harris.
Season recap.
Syracuse began its 2006–07 season looking for leadership after the graduation of four-year starter Gerry McNamara. Even without McNamara, the Orange had experience across the front line including seniors Demetris Nichols, Darryl Watkins and Terrence Roberts, while junior Josh Wright and sophomore Eric Devendorf rounded out the lineup. Other key players off the bench included sharp-shooting Andy Rautins, highly touted freshman Paul Harris, Mike Jones, Arinze Onuaku and senior Matt Gorman, the only holdover from the 2003 National Championship team.
Before the season even started, the Orange was hit with the injury bug, as Onuaku had season ending knee surgery. The Orange started ranked No. 17 in the AP Top 25 Poll, and won their first seven games, although they struggled through the early part of their schedule.
Injuries struck once again, as Watkins broke his nose against UTEP, and Roberts hurt his knee versus Drexel. Meanwhile, Devendorf missed time because of the death of a friend from his hometown in Michigan. This played into their early season struggles, as Syracuse lost three games to Oklahoma State, Wichita State and Drexel.
Devendorf was replaced in the lineup by Rautins, and while Harris showed flashes of his talent on defense and rebounding, he struggled with his shot and saw his playing time decrease.
Syracuse started its Big East schedule with a loss to Pittsburgh, but wins at Marquette and versus Villanova and a narrow escape against Cincinnati. The win against the Bearcats would prove to be the calm before the storm, as Syracuse then lost to St. Johns, blew a 14 point lead at Louisville, and gave up 103 points in a loss to Notre Dame in the Carrier Dome. Seemingly a lock for the NCAA Tournament at the beginning of the season, the Orange was now a bubble-team. After winning against DePaul and then losing at Connecticut, Nichols scored a career-high 37 points in a two-point win against St. Johns.
With the team's record at 16–8 overall and 5–5 in the Big East conference, Boeheim made several adjustments in the Syracuse lineup. He sent the struggling Wright to the bench and moved Devendorf to the starting point guard position and Rautins to shooting guard.
The move paid dividends, as Rautins went on a shooting tear and helped the Orange to win five of their remaining six regular season games. One of those wins was against No. 10 Georgetown at the Carrier Dome, which many assumed stamped Syracuse's ticket to the NCAA Tournament. At season's end, Syracuse posted a 21–8 record and 10–6 in Big East play.
In the Big East Tournament, Syracuse seemed to put the cherry on the top of their NCAA bid, beating Connecticut soundly in the first round before getting knocked out by Notre Dame in the second round. However, on Selection Sunday, Syracuse fans were stunned when the Orange was not selected to the NCAA Tournament.
It was the first time that a team with 10 wins in the Big East Conference was not invited to the NCAA tournament. Selection Committee Chairman Gary Walters said some of the factors in not inviting Syracuse included playing an uneven in-conference schedule, and having a weak non-conference schedule.
Syracuse headed to the National Invitation Tournament for the first time since the 2001–02 season. It defeated South Alabama and San Diego State before losing to Clemson in the quarterfinals of the NIT.
At season's end, Nichols was selected as a First Team All Big East performer, while Devendorf received All Big East Honorable Mention. Harris was named to the Big East All Rookie team.

15 cm K (E)

The 15 cm Kanone in Eisenbahnlafette (gun on railroad mounting) (15 cm K (E)) was a German railroad gun used in the Second World War. It participated in the invasion of Belgium in 1940, but spent most of the war on coast-defense duties.
Design.
This weapon was the first modern railroad gun to enter service with the Heer. The gun was mounted on a simple pivot mount on a ballrace on a well-base flatcar with four outriggers. In action the outriggers and their jacks would be dropped to stabilize the gun and absorb the firing recoil. In addition jacks locked the spring suspension, bore on the surface of the rails and screw clamps gripped the rails for more stability. The elderly "15 cm Schnelladekanone L/40" was used because it was available in some numbers.
Ammunition.
The standard high explosive shell was the "15 cm K Gr 18", a nose-fuzed round containing of TNT. An anti-concrete shell was also available, the "15 cm Gr 19 Be". It was a base-fuzed shell with a TNT filler of , with a rounded sheet-steel ballistic cap. A base propellant charge was combined with three increments to form three standard loadings, Small Load ("Kleine Ladung") with a muzzle velocity of , Medium ("Mittelere") with a muzzle velocity of and Large ("Grosse") with a muzzle velocity of .
Combat history.
Two guns were damaged by premature detonations in their barrels on 20 May 1940 while bombarding Liège. They spent most of the war assigned to "Artillery Battery (Artillerie-Batterie) 655 (E)" in Belgium on coast-defense duties along the Channel coast.
Note.
Sources are contradictory on the gun used and numbers produced of this weapon. The most recent source, François, has been generally been followed, not least because he cites serial numbers. Do not confuse this gun with those of "Naval Artillery Battery (Marine-Artillerie-Batterie) "Gneisenau"" that used a slightly more modern "15 cm SK L/45" gun with a gun shield.

Black Lake Bayou

Black Lake Bayou is a waterway in northwest Louisiana, USA, that extends from north of Gibsland and travels south to Clarence. The watershed covers much of northwest Louisiana. The bayou meanders its way through Claiborne Parish, Webster, Bienville, Red River and Natchitoches parishes. Black Lake Bayou empties into Black Lake, which drains to Saline Bayou, a tributary of the Red River.
Black Lake Bayou runs near the towns of Minden, Dubberly, Fryburg, Gibsland, Mount Lebanon, Jamestown, Castor and Ashland. Kepler Lake is also a part of the Black Lake Bayou watershed. Black Lake Bayou runs underneath Louisiana Highways 154, 156, 531, 792, 4, 507, and 155.
Landscape.
The bayou is choked by trees--bridge overpasses are the only places where the bayou is easily accessed and usually where people fish. There is a crude boat launch at Nix Crossing, which is 2-3 miles north of Castor and 3-4 miles south of Jamestown. Nix Crossing is one of the widest and deepest parts of Black Lake Bayou.
The Kansas City Southern Railroad had a bridge that crossed Black Lake Bayou at Nix Crossing until the rails to trails program deconstructed it--the pilings still stand in the water.

Akai AX80

The AX80 is a polyphonic analogue keyboard synthesizer manufactured by Akai Professional in 1984. It was Akai's first venture into the professional electronic musical instrument market. The AX80 used 'digitally controlled' analogue oscillators “"The oscillators were analogue but were 'digitally controlled' for better pitch stability and tracking."”
Note: Gordon Reid 1996 described it as ""VCOs rather than DCOs"", however, his estimation seems lacking evidence.
</ref> and filter circuitry based on the Curtis Electronics CEM 3372 integrated circuit. It was marketed as part of a line of project studio equipment called the Akai Music Studio System, which included the S612 digital sampler the MR16 drum machine, the MS08 sequencer, and the MG1212 multitrack tape recorder, at a price of $1,695 US.
Features and cabinet.
This electronic keyboard is an 8-voice polyphonic, digitally controlled analogue synthesizer. It has 64 memory locations for sounds ("patches"), arranged in two banks of 32 each, plus a bank of 32 factory preset sounds. The instrument has basic MIDI implementation, but lacks the ability to save or restore sounds except by using cassette tape.
Front panel.
The front panel has a volume knob, a master tuning knob, a data entry knob for programming patches, modulation and pitch wheels with knobs for the depth of the effect, and various buttons to switch on and off modulation destinations, enable chord memory, transpose the keyboard, or infinitely sustain notes. The case is black metal with fluorescent displays to indicate the status of different synthesis parameters (see Figure 1), and black rubberized end pieces.
Back panel.
The back panel is unusual in that it is tilted from vertical so that the connectors can be seen from the front of the instrument. There are quarter-inch jacks for recording data to cassette tape, sustain and program change footpedal jacks, MIDI in, out and "thru" DIN connectors, a monaural quarter-inch audio output, a quarter-inch headphone jack, and memory protect and power switches.
Keyboard.
The keyboard is five octaves (61 notes, C to C) and is unweighted. It has velocity, but not aftertouch, sensitivity. The output MIDI velocity values span the full range (up to 127), but only discrete "steps" are used (in other words, not every integer value from 1 to 127).
Voice architecture and sound programming.
Voice architecture.
The synthesizer voices are somewhat similar to those found in the Roland JX-3P or Teisco SX-240, in that there are two oscillators (referred to as "OSC"s) per voice, with the option of sawtooth and/or square waveforms. These oscillators are controlled digitally with analog circuitry used only to create the sawtooth waveshape. OSC2 can be synchronized to OSC1, or the two oscillators can be cross-modulated. The OSCs can be separated by semitone intervals (up to four octaves) and detuned (to approximately a semitone). There is pulse-width modulation of the square wave of OSC1 (with a dedicated low-frequency oscillator (LFO) for this) and a square-wave sub-oscillator that is fixed at one octave lower. OSC2's pitch can be modulated by one of the two ADSR envelope generators, which are dedicated to VCA volume and VCF cutoff frequency. The filter is a 24dB/octave (four-pole) resonant lowpass type, and there is also a separate 12 dB/octave highpass filter that is not envelope controlled.
Tracking of filter cutoff frequency with keyboard position is fully variable, allowing for sounds to become either "brighter" or "darker" as higher notes are played. Keyboard velocity can affect volume and/or filter cutoff. 
The modulation section of this synthesizer features four low-frequency oscillators. Three of these each have four available waveforms (sine, square, sawtooth and ramp), and these LFOs are dedicated to filter cutoff, and pitch of each of the two oscillators. These also have a programmable delay before their effect sets in. The fourth LFO is dedicated to pulse-width modulation of OSC1, and only its rate and depth are programmable.
There is also a programmable output level for each patch, to help balance loud and soft sounds. Notably missing from the voice architecture are white noise and portamento.
Performance controls.
The AX80 has knobs for master volume and tuning, and a data entry knob that can be used to alter the currently selected parameter in real-time, although the value will jump to the knob's current position. There are various switches to select modulation destinations controlled by the modulation wheel (filter and pitch), to enable chord memory or infinite sustain of notes, and to select or edit sounds. The pitch-bend and modulation wheels also have knobs governing the depth of the effect of each. Footswitches can control sustain or switch sounds by moving up one patch at a time.
MIDI implementation.
The AX80 has fairly standard MIDI implementation for an instrument of this vintage, with the ability to use any channel (1-16) for transmission or reception (these can be set separately). The instrument does not recognize the MIDI tuning request, nor does it allow for saving or loading sounds (patches) to a computer via system-exclusive data dumps.
Other information.
Accessories.
When it was released, Akai advertised various accessories for the AX80: a footswitch (PS-X80), the FC-X80 flight case, HC-X80 hard case, SC-X80 soft case, and a vinyl dust cover (DC-X80).
Use in recorded music.
An AX80 appears in the video for Kim Mitchell's song "All We Are", played by Pye Dubois, although the manufacturer's name is blacked out. Greek synth-pop duo Marsheaux and U.K alternative act Spacehotel are also said to use the AX80, as is Mark Bell of LFO on Björk's Homogenic album.
Literature.
Full-page advertisements with the slogan "Simply...Awesome!" ran in Keyboard Magazine during the mid-1980s. The AX80 also appears in the price lists at the end of both editions of Mark Vail’s "Vintage Synthesizers". The second edition contains a footnote: "If you can get around the interfaces on the Akai AX-series synths, Wes Taggart Analogics (Geneva, Ohio, USA) reports that 'a good-sounding synth lies beneath'". Jim Aikin reviewed the AX80 in Keyboard Magazine in January 1985, noting it has a "warm, full sound, and can deliver a full palette of musically useful tone colors... an excellent first entry into the keyboard market, by a company that we're sure to be seeing more from." Keyboard also printed a capsule summary in its new product profile "Spec Sheet" feature. There is also a two-page review in "Complete Guide to Synthesizers, Sequencers, and Drum Machines", by Dean Friedman.

List of Edmonton Oilers draft picks

The Edmonton Oilers are a professional ice hockey franchise based in Edmonton, Alberta. They play in the Northwest Division of the Western Conference in the National Hockey League (NHL). They were founded in 1972 as a member of the World Hockey Association (WHA) and played in the WHA until 1979 when they joined the NHL. During their time in the WHA the Oilers drafted 59 players with the 1977 draft being their fifth and final. The NHL Oilers have drafted 340 players in 33 drafts.
The NHL Entry Draft is held each June, allowing teams to select players who have turned 18 years old by September 15 in the year the draft is held. The draft order is determined by the previous season's order of finish, with non-playoff teams drafting first, followed by the teams that made the playoffs, with the specific order determined by the number of points earned by each team. The NHL holds a weighted lottery for the 14 non-playoff teams, allowing the winner to move up a maximum of four positions in the entry draft. The team with the fewest points has the best chance of winning the lottery, with each successive team given a lower chance of moving up in the draft. The Oilers have won the lottery twice, in 2010 and 2012. Between 1986 and 1994, the NHL also held a Supplemental Draft for players in American colleges.
Edmonton's first draft pick in the WHA was John Rogers, taken sixth overall in the 1973 WHA Amateur Draft. Their first pick in the NHL was Kevin Lowe, taken 21st overall in the 1979 NHL Entry Draft. The highest the Oilers have picked is first overall, which they did on three successive occasions between 2010 and 2012. They selected Taylor Hall (2010), Ryan Nugent-Hopkins (2011) and Nail Yakupov (2012). Ten picks went on to play over 1,000 NHL games: Mark Messier, Paul Coffey, Lowe, Jari Kurri, Jason Arnott, Kelly Buchberger, Ryan Smyth, Glenn Anderson, Kirk Maltby and Miroslav Satan. Five of Edmonton's draft picks, Anderson, Coffey, Grant Fuhr, Kurri and Messier, have been elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame.

Quick's Hole

Quick's Hole is the strait in Massachusetts' Elizabeth Islands separating Nashawena Island from Pasque Island. It is one of four straits allowing maritime passage between Buzzards Bay and the Vineyard Sound. The others are Canapitsit Channel, Robinson's Hole and Woods Hole. 
A narrow passage, Quick's Hole handles heavy boat traffic as the only passage between Vineyard Sound and Buzzards Bay suitable for vessels with drafts greater than 10 feet. Analysis of the data revealed giant sand waves, huge glacial erratic boulders and several uncharted wrecks. Quick's Hole, due north of Menemsha on Martha's Vineyard and due south of New Bedford, extends about one and one-half miles from north to south; it is three-quarters of a mile across at its widest point.

The GreenMount School

The GreenMount School is a cooperative, independent day school located in Baltimore, Maryland, USA. Children are enrolled from kindergarten through 8th grade. The school is located in the Remington neighborhood of northern Baltimore, near Johns Hopkins University.
History.
The GreenMount School was founded by a group of six parents in 1993. These parents, who had previously been homeschooling their children, created a one-room school house with 26 students of various age in the basement of a church on Greenmount Avenue in the Waverly neighborhood of Baltimore. The founders set the school up as a parent-run co-op and initially assumed both the administrative and teaching duties. The first full-time professional teacher was hired in 1995 and eventually administrative duties were handed over to a full-time head of school (currently Steve Warner). Parents remained heavily involved in the daily business of the school, however—a tradition that continues to this day, in large part through the parent co-op.
After years of growing enrollment, the school moved to its current location in the former Wyman Park Recreation Center in the summer of 1997. The building is presently leased from the City of Baltimore and abuts a city-maintained playground.
The school currently has an enrollment of approximately 110 students, a faculty of 18, and three administrative staff members.
Full enrollment is considered 108 students in kindergarten through 8th grade.
Philosophy.
Since its inception, GreenMount has embraced a child-centered educational philosophy. According to the school’s website: 
Along with a strong foundation in mathematics, science and language arts, the curriculum is supplemented with music, art, theatre, environmental and urban explorations, physical education, and library studies. Each year the curriculum is fashioned around three different theme-based programs. Some examples of themes are “From Radicals to Reagan: 1960-to-1980”; “Australia and Oceania”; “The Age of Extremes: World Wars, Boom and Bust, Harlem Renaissance”; and “The Greening of GreenMount.” Each theme culminates in a school-wide event where students share what they have learned with family and friends.[http://www.greenmountschool.org/about.shtml]
These themes are integrated into the curriculum via a variety of projects the students undertake. For example, 5th and 6th graders did the following projects in Fall 2007 while studying “From Radicals to Reagan: 1960-1980.”
The curriculum is generally oriented towards multidisciplinary, project based learning (PjBL), usually centered on the theme in question.
Based partially on Howard Gardner's notion of multiple intelligences, the school is dedicated to multi-age education. This is reflected in the classes themselves, each of which contains two grades (The classes are currently separated into kindergarten and grades 1/2, 3/4, 5/6 and 7/8). Students frequently work in groups of mixed ages and mixed abilities.
Fridays, which are half days for students, are considered “community days,” during which the entire school meets as a unit and embarks on a single daylong project, usually oriented towards the current theme being studied. All of the students get together to work on a theme-related project with their “buddies.” First graders are paired with 8th graders, 2nd graders with 6th graders, etc. 
Students also participate in a variety of out-of-school activities, including field trips, community service, middle-school apprenticeships, camping trips, and (for 8th graders) international travel. 
The school regularly has visiting artists and lecturers from the Baltimore area. Past visitors have included filmmaker John Waters, children’s book author Nancy Patz, Baltimore Blast players and Edwin Mulitalo of Big Ed's Band Foundation [http://www.bigedsband.com/] and Baltimore Ravens superstar.
Parent co-operative.
GreenMount is based on a co-op model with parents actively participating in the school. Each parent is responsible for donating 40 hours of their time to the school each year, and generally signs up for a specific ongoing job. The jobs can range from serving on the GreenMount school board, to mopping the gym floor once a month, to teaching afterschool classes. Past classes include sewing, painting, hula hoop, and web page design.

Abkhazian parliamentary election, 1996

Parliamentary elections were held in the underrecognized Republic of Abkhazia on 24 November 1996. 30 of the 35 seats were filled in the election with the other five being filled in run-off elections two weeks later. At the same time refugees in Georgia held a referendum to declare that elections in Abkhazia were invalid.
Election.
The election was held in order to replace the former Abkhaz Autonomous Republic's Supreme Soviet which had split during the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict in 1993 with 28 deputies continuing in Abkhazia as the Abkhaz Supreme Soviet. The remaining 24 formed a parliament in exile in Georgia.
In order to be elected a candidate had to obtain over 50% of the vote. Voters received a list of candidates and crossed off all the names but that of the candidate they preferred.
The electoral commission of Abkhazia reported that there was an 81% turnout among the electorate. 19 Abkhaz, 4 Russians, 3 Armenians, 2 Georgians, 1 Greek and 1 Kabardin were elected.
In advance of the election international organisations and major countries declared that the election was invalid.
Referendum.
In response to the election Georgia organised a referendum among refugees from Abkhazia. The Georgian government of Eduard Shevardnadze said that over 99% of refugees agreed that elections in Abkhazia were invalid until refugees were allowed to return and its political status as part of Georgia was agreed.

Anna Pierce (née Willard) (born March 31, 1984 in Portland, Maine) is an American middle distance runner.
Personal.
Pierce grew up on a farm in Greenwood, Maine. She took up running as a high school student at Telstar High School in Bethel, Maine. She competed as an undergraduate for Brown University and as a graduate student for the University of Michigan. Because Pierce missed a track season at Brown due to injury, she had not exhausted her athletic eligibility prior to graduation. Therefore, she was able to compete for Michigan in 2007 as a graduate student.
Anna became engaged to fellow American steeplechaser Jonathan Pierce at the 2008 U.S. Olympic trials. She is especially known for dyeing her hair unusual colors. Her hair was blonde with pink streaks at the 2008 U.S. Olympic trials, and she dyed it purple before the 2008 Summer Olympics.
Career.
Pierce set the U.S. women's record for the 3000 meter steeplechase of 9:27.56 at the 2008 United States Olympic track and field trials on July 3, 2008 in Eugene, Oregon en route to qualifying for the United States Olympic team.
Pierce's U.S. steeplechase record was eclipsed by teammate Jennifer Barringer at the 2008 Summer Olympics. Pierce qualified for the Olympic final by finishing sixth in her heat, and placed tenth in the final with a time of 9:25.63.
In 2009, Pierce focused more on her 1500 m and 800 m racing. She was victorious at the USA Indoor 1500 m, and the 800 m at the Reebok Grand Prix and a Golden League meet in Paris. Pierce chose to run only in the 1500 m at the World Championships in Berlin, finishing 6th with a time of 4:06.19.
In 2013, Anna Pierce moved to Mammoth Mountain to train with the elites like 2:19 marathoner Deena Kastor, 1:12:12 half marathoner Lauren Kleppin, Lauren Jimison and Bria Wetsch.

Town Class (sailboat)

Town Class sailboats are lap strake one-design dories, constructed in either wood or fiberglass. The Town Class was designed as an affordable boat for the townspeople, hence its name. 
History.
The first Town Class sailboat was designed and built (in wood only) in 1932 by Marcus C. Lowell in Amesbury, Massachusetts. Marcus' son, Percival M. "Pert" Lowell, later took over the business and relocated to Newbury, Massachusetts. In 1936, the Town Class sailboat was adopted as a one-design class boat, and quickly became a popular racing boat from Maine to Florida. In the late 1960s, fiberglass models became available. Currently, more than two thousand wood and fiberglass "Townies" have been built to date. The Pert Lowell Company, which is now operated by "Pert" Lowell's son-in-law, Ralph Johnson, continues to construct these boats today. 
Town Class Regatta.
The National Town Class Association was formed in 1962, also marking the first year of the Town Class National Regatta (an annual two-day racing event) which took place in Nahant, Massachusetts. The Town Class Nationals have also been held in Marblehead, Wakefield, Sharon, and Newburyport, Massachusetts; as well as Touisset Point, Rhode Island and Spofford New Hampshire.

The Alsager Arts Centre is on campus, which promotes touring contemporary dance, music, theatre, live art, performance writing and visual art events to the public as well as members of the university community.
The university will vacate the site in the next five years, relocating to the university's Crewe campus, and the land sold for development. As yet no firm plans have been released and the uncertainty is concerning residents and businesses.
Education in Middlewich.
There were three schools in Middlewich in the mid-19th century: the British School in Newton Bank; the National School in Cow Lane (Brooks Lane); and the Grammar School, close to the site of the Somerfields store. A Church of England school was erected in Lewin Street in 1854 and extended in 1871. It soon became known as the National School, with the result that the earlier school was demolished. The later National School was itself demolished in the 1980s and is the site of the "Salinae Day Care Centre", opened in 1995. At the turn of the 20th century two new schools were built: St Mary's Catholic school, whose keystone was laid in 1899 by Col. France-Hayhurst, and the secondary school, opened by France-Hayhurst in 1906.

Conscience (The Beloved album)

Conscience is a 1993 album from British pop band The Beloved. The album reached #2 on the UK Albums Chart on its release, and includes "Sweet Harmony", the first single taken from it, being the first single from the band which entered the UK Top Ten, peaking at Number 8. Both are the highest positions ever reached by The Beloved in Great Britain with an album and with a single release.
Album information.
The band faced some controversy for the video of the first new single, "Sweet Harmony," which consisted of a naked Marsh, among a group of women, also naked (although it was shot and edited so as not to show anything which might cause it to be censored). One of the nude stars of this video is British television presenter Tess Daly. By this time, the project had dropped the definite article from its name, and was now simply called Beloved. By the way, still a duo, Jon had fired former member Steve Waddington, and recruited his wife Helena instead, after 1991 remix album "Blissed Out". Jon and Helena in fact composed all songs on the new studio album, but Helena rarely appeared on live promotional gigs, though she did feature on some videos for the new singles, but not on "Sweet Harmony." This song, which was originally used to promote the second season of the popular American primetime soap opera "Melrose Place" in some European countries, including Italy, has since been used in Homebase advertising too.
The album produced other singles too, but none of them being as successful as the first single taken from the LP or the long playing work itself, In fact, while "Sweet Harmony", as mentioned above, went on to become their biggest hit in the UK, reaching Number 8, in January 1993, the other four tracks taken from the album, pressed onto three singles, one of them being a double A-side, did not make that well, with "Celebrate Your Life"/"You've Got Me Thinking" peaking at Number 23, "Outerspace Girl" reaching Number 38, and the final single, "Rock to the Rhythm of Love," not even charting. This latter song was performed live at the London Gay Pride in 1994, during the afternoon hours of a concert that started early in the morning and was then closed by Boy George late at night. Both Boy George with his project called Jesus Loves You and Jon Marsh with his Beloved are held as two amongst the first acts to start the so-called 'dance revolution' of the early 1990s. Not casually, many musicians who participated in the Jesus Loves You project are also featured on the Beloved 1993 album, such as keyboardist Richard Cottle and, most notably, guitarist John Themis, who authored much of Boy George's solo works after the Jesus Loves You experience, including some of the latest songs by Culture Club, of which he is recently considered as the fifth member, virtually, and actually he is in the band's live gigs.

Palatine R 4/4

The physically identical Palatine and Bavarian Class R 4/4 engines of the Royal Bavarian State Railways ("Königlich Bayerische Staats-Eisenbahnen") were goods train tank locomotives with four coupled axles and no carrying axles. The first nine machines were built for the Palatinate Railway ("Pfalzbahn") in 1913 and 1915 as the Palatine Class R 4, the remainder from 1918 to 1925 as Bavarian R 4/4 engines.
In 1925 seven Palatine R 4/4 with operating numbers 92 2001 to 92 2007 and all the Bavarian R 4/4 with operating numbers 92 2008 to 92 2049 were incorporated by the Deutsche Reichsbahn into their numbering plan as Class 92.20.
Retirement started in 1945 and was completed in 1962 with the last one, which was stabled in Nuremberg.

Palatine P 5

The six-coupled P 5 of the Palatinate Railway ("Pfalzbahn") was to replace the four-coupled locomotives in the Palatinate. They were given a leading Krauss-Helmholtz bogie and a trailing bogie in order to achieve satisfactory weight distribution.
The firm of Krauss delivered twelve examples in 1908. One notable feature was the particularly large coal and water tanks requested by the Railway. The Deutsche Reichsbahn took all the vehicles over and converted them to superheated engines. After the end of the Second World War nine were left. Most of them were sold to private railways. The last one owned by the Deutsche Bundesbahn was retired in 1951.
After the Palatine P 5 had proved successful, the Royal Bavarian State Railways ("Königlich Bayerische Staatsbahn") decided to procure more of this class in a more powerful version. As a result the Palatine Pt 3/6 was built from 1911. A total of 19 engines were procured. In 1923 a further 10 of these two-cylinder superheated steam engines were ordered for Bavaria as the Bavarian Pt 3/6. They were deployed on the express train routes between Garmisch-Partenkirchen and Munich. All the engines were taken over by the Reichsbahn, the Bavarian versions being given the operating numbers 77 110–119. One machine was lost during the Second World War. The Deutsche Bundesbahn took over 27 engines and retired them by 1954. One locomotive remained with the East German DR and was retired in 1956.

The Unquiet Grave (book)

The Unquiet Grave is a literary work by Cyril Connolly written in 1944 under the pseudonym Palinurus. It comprises a collection of aphorisms, quotes, nostalgic musings and mental explorations.
Palinurus was the pilot of Aeneas's ship in the Aeneid who fell overboard as an act of atonement to the angry gods, and whose spirit wandered in the underworld. Connolly uses the theme to explore his feelings and review his situation as he approaches the age of forty presenting a very pessimistic and self-deprecating account. Into this he brings quotes from some of his favourite authors: Pascal, De Quincey, Chamfort and Flaubert as well as snatches from the Buddha, Chinese philosophy and Freud. The title The Unquiet Grave is taken from an English folk song of the same name.
The book is in four parts entitled "Ecce Gubernator" ("Here is the pilot"), "Te Palinure Petens" ("Looking for you, Palinurus") and "La Clé des Chants" ("The key of songs") and "Who was Palinurus". The first two contain similar sets of musing, while the third contains more recollections with veiled references to Connolly's life in France. The last gives an account Palinurus's history.

Bagby Guard Station

Bagby Guard Station is a rustic cabin located in the Mount Hood National Forest in western Oregon, United States. It is adjacent to Bagby Hot Springs. The guard station was originally built to house fire crews assigned to patrol the surrounding National Forest. The Bagby Guard Station is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
History.
In the 1920s and 1930s, National Forests road networks were not well developed. To get to job sites, Forest Service employees often traveled many miles on foot or horseback, carrying all the equipment need to perform field work. This made it impractical for employees to make daily round-trips. To facilitate work at remote sites, the Forest Service built guard stations at strategic locations throughout the forest to house fire patrols and project crews.
After World War II, the Forest Service greatly expanded its road network, allowing employees to get to most National Forest areas within a few hours. As a result, guard stations lost their utility. The Forest Service found new uses for some stations, but most were demolished or abandon.
The Bagby Guard Station is located in the Mount Hood National Forest forty miles southeast of Estacada, Oregon, just outside the boundary of Bull of the Woods Wilderness area. It was built next to Bagby Hot Springs in 1913 by Phillip F. Putz, the Forest Service guard assigned to the area. Putz also built a small storage shed adjacent to the cabin. In the years following its construction, the guard station was used as a barracks for Forest Service fire crews that patrolled the surrounding forest during the summer fire season. In 1925 Putz built his own home in Colton, Oregon.
During the 1920s, summer fire crews built a barn, dam, bathhouse, and additional shelters at the site. However, all of these facilities are now gone. Over time, the original guard station fell into disrepair so the Forest Service built a new cabin for the Bagby guard in 1974. Because of its rustic architecture and the cabin’s unique historic value as an early Forest Service guard station, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. In 2006, volunteers from Northwest Forest Conservancy and Friends of Bagby worked with the Forest Service to repair and preserve the original Bagby Guard Station cabin.
Structure.
The Bagby Guard Station is located in a remote area of the Clackamas Ranger District on the western slope of the Cascade Mountains, at elevation. It is a rustic cabin surrounded by undisturbed old-growth forest of mainly Douglas-fir, western hemlock, and western red cedar.
The guard station is a traditional log cabin structure with a wood shingle roof and a stone foundation. It has a single room measuring 24 by . The logs were cut and peeled on the site so the cabin blends into the surrounding forest landscape. The original shed still sits next to the guard station cabin.[http://www.flickr.com/photos/cheryl_hill/289509164/in/photostream/ Both historic structures were renovated in 2006. However, they are not open to the public.
In addition to the two historic structures, there are seven other building at the Bagby site. These include the new guard station and storage shed built in 1974. There are also three bathhouses built between 1983 and 1986 plus two outhouses for public use.
Recreation.
The guard station is located in the middle of Bagby Hot Springs. There are three major springs and several minor outlets that make up Bagby Hot Springs. The largest spring flows twenty-four gallons per minute at 138 degrees Fahrenheit. The two secondary springs produce 15 gallons per minute at 136 degrees and 3 gallons per minute at 120 degrees. There are three bath houses at the site. The "Main Bathhouse" has five cedar log tubs each in its own rustic, but private room. Nearby, the "Lower Bathhouse" has three log tubs and a large round tub located on an open deck. The "Upper Bathhouse" is located approximately southeast of the Main Bathhouse. It has one large round tub on an open deck. Bagby Hot Springs are open for day-use only. Camping is not permitted at the hot springs or along the trail to Bagby.
The Bull of the Woods Wilderness is only about a half mile up the trail from guard station, so visitor can easily access the wilderness trail network from Bagby. Bull of the Woods Peak is at the center of a trail system. The Pansy Lake Trail takes hikers to peak’s summit where an old lookout tower commands a panoramic view of the surrounding area. Wilderness trails lead to a dozen scenic lakes with native trout populations, Twin Lakes and Elk Lake are the most popular. The headwaters of the Collawash, Breitenbush, and Little North Santiam Rivers are all found in the Bull of the Woods Wilderness.
Access.
There is no road to Bagby Guard Station; visitors must hike a trail from a Forest Service parking area to get to the site. It is a relatively easy hike with only a gain in of elevation along the way. The trail is maintained by the Forest Service and volunteers from the Northwest Forest Conservancy.
It is approximately from Estacada to the Bagby trailhead. To get there from Estacada, take Highway 224 for approximately to Ripplebrook Guard Station. Then follow Forest Service Road 46 for to the junction with Forest Service Road 63. Turn right and follow Road 63 for to Forest Service Road 70. Turn right onto Road 70 and follow it for to the Bagby Trailhead. A $5 Forest Service permit is required to park at the trailhead. Bagby is normally open year around, however, access roads to the trailhead may be close after some winter snow storms.

Cystopteris dickieana

Cystopteris dickieana commonly known as Dickie's Bladder-fern is a fern with a wide distribution in the Northern Hemisphere. There is debate amongst botanists as to whether it is a species in its own right or a variant of "C. fragilis".
Distribution.
"C. dickieana" is native to Canada and the United States, a variety of European countries including Russia and also north Africa and the Andes. It is typically found in montane habitats below the tree-line, although it is also grows at lower altitudes in locations with cool summers.
Discovery and Victorian collectors.
The first recorded discovery of the plant was made by William Knight, Professor of Natural Philosophy at Marischal College, Aberdeen in Scotland. Knight came across a small population growing on base-rich rocks in a sea cave (known locally as a "yawn") on the coast of Kincardineshire. The first publication to record it was the 1838 "Flora Aberdonenis" which included a note of its occurrence written by a pupil of Knight's, George Dickie. Dickie also sent a live specimen to Robert Sim, a nurseryman from Kent, who believed it to be a new species and published his views in the 1848 edition of the "Gardener's and Farmer's Journal", naming it "C. dickieana".
Rarer British ferns came under severe threat from Victorian fern collectors in the mid 19th century in Scotland, a period of collecting that became known as "Pteridomania" (or "fern-fever"). In 1860 Dickie reported that the original colony had been extirpated from the yawn where its original discovery had occurred. The evidence for this is conflicting, but today there is a population of more than 100 plants there, where it grows in a roof fissure in the company of "Athyrium filix-femina" and "Dryopteris dilatata".
Taxonomic controversy.
Taxonomic classification within the genus "Cystopteris" is complex. Within a year of Sim's publication Thomas Moore stated his view was that, on balance, Dickie's Bladder-fern was a variety of "C. fragilis". Various opinions have been published over the intervening years, with a consensus that "C. dickeana" was a separate species emerging in the 1930s, although recent research suggests that Moore's caution may have been appropriate. "C. dickeana" has broader, less divided and more closely spaced pinnae than "C. fragilis" and the spores of the former are typically wrinkled and ridged rather than the spiny form of the latter's. However, there are significant variations within the populations of both forms and these characteristics are by no means fixed. On the other hand there is also evidence that crosses of the two types produce sterile hybrids. "C. Xmontserratii" (Prada & Salvo) Fraser-Jenkins is a proposed hybrid between "C. dickeana" and "C. fragilis".
The treatment of "Cystopteris" in the "Flora of North America" (1993) regards "Cystopteris dickieana" as a synonym of "Cystopteris fragilis".
Conservation.
In the UK the fern's natural population is entirely confined to Scotland, where it is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.

Pageant of Empire

The Pageant of Empire was a set of historical pageants, directed by pageant master Frank Lascelles on behalf of the British government, for the huge British Empire Exhibition held at the Empire Stadium (later Wembley Stadium) in 1924. The Exhibition was opened on 23 April, and the Pageant was performed between 21 July and 30 August. Its full title was "The Pageant of Empire: An Historical Epic".
Description.
The Pageant had a cast of 15,000 people, 300 horses, 500 donkeys, 730 camels, 72 monkeys, 1000 doves, seven elephants, three bears and one macaw. It took three days to see the whole performance. 
The music for the pageants was selected by Henry Jaxon assisted by Ignatius de Orellana. There was an orchestra of over a hundred musicians selected from three London orchestras. The large choir was selected from local choral societies, who gave their services free. The scenery was designed by Frank Brangwyn.
The pageants included "The Days of Queen Elizabeth", "The English Fleet in the Mediterranean - Blake and the Barbary Pirates", "George III and the Departure of Captain Cook" and "A Pageant of Heroes". There were pageants for the countries of the Empire: South Africa, India, New Zealand and Australia, and the first musical item in each was a poem by Alfred Noyes set to music by Edward Elgar. Other composers represented (they were all British) included Eric Coates ("Merrymakers overture"), Edward German (a song from "Merrie England"), Percy Fletcher ("Sylvan Scenes"), Henry Smart, Samuel Coleridge Taylor ("Bamboula"), Hubert Parry ("War and Peace"), Alexander Mackenzie ("Britannia overture"), Hamish McCunn, Liza Lehmann, Amy Woodforde-Finden ("Indian Love Lyrics"), Herman Finck, Granville Bantock, Leslie Stuart, Arthur Sullivan ("Imperial March") and Edwin Lemare ("Solemn March" for organ). The concluding pageants were "A Pageant of Heroes" and "An Empire's Thanksgiving". For "A Pageant of Heroes" there were settings of Alfred Noyes' poem "The Immortal Legions", and Laurence Binyon's "With Proud Thanksgiving" both set to music by Elgar. For "The Empire's Thanksgiving", an "Anthem of the Sister Nations" by Laurence Binyon was set to music by Nicholas Gatty, and there was a recitation of "Recessional" by Rudyard Kipling set to music by Herbert Bunning.
Three movements from Elgar's "The Crown of India" were included in the pageant representing "The Early Days of India": the Introduction, the March of the Mogul Emperors and the Crown of India March.
Pageant of Empire is also the title given to the set of songs, to words by Alfred Noyes, written by Sir Edward Elgar and included in the Pageant. Elgar conducted the massed choirs at the opening ceremony of the Exhibition, including "Land of Hope and Glory", but the songs were not performed there until 21 July, when they were conducted by the composer.
Elgar composed his "Empire March" for the same occasion, and this march was at the time considered part of the "Pageant of Empire". However the Empire March was not performed then and Elgar's "Imperial March" took its place.

Microbial symbiosis and immunity

Symbiotic microorganisms, both beneficial and potentially pathogenic, reside in the gastrointestinal tract of humans. Imbalances in the bacterial composition, known as dysbiosis, are thought to be a major determinant in inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease in humans. It has long been known that intestinal microorganisms are important for the development of intestinal tissues. A recent study has demonstrated that a human symbiotic microorganism called Bacteroides fragilis protects animals from experimental colitis induced by Helicobacter hepaticus. Polysaccharide A (PSA) from this bacteria singlehandedly protects humans from the inflammatory bowel diseases.

Blakeley (West Virginia)

Blakeley, near Charles Town, West Virginia is also known as the Washington - Chew - Funkhouser House, and was built in 1820 by John Augustine Washington II, great-nephew of George Washington and son of John Augustine Washington. It is a contemporary of its neighbor, Claymont Court, built across Bullskin Run by John's brother, Bushrod Corbin Washington. John Washington did not attempt to match the grandeur of Claymont Court, as he was in line to inherit Mount Vernon, and did so in 1829. 
Upon John's death at Mount Vernon in 1832, his son, Richard Blackburn Washington, inherited Blakeley. In 1844 Richard married his cousin, Christian Washington of Harewood. In 1859, Richard was part of the posse that pursued John Brown's Raiders. After the death of Richard's brother John Augustine Washington III in 1861 while fighting for the Confederacy, John's eight orphaned children came to live at Blakeley, joining Richard and Christian Washington's seven. In 1864 Blakeley was extensively damaged by fire, but was rebuilt by Richard. In 1875 Richard was forced to sell Blakeley and moved with his family to Harewood.
The house was purchased by Louise Fontaine Washington Chew, the niece of Richard B. Washington. Chew's husband, Colonel R. Preston Chew was a local businessman, the president of the Charles Town Mining, Manufacturing and Improvement Company. The house was then sold in 1892 to John Burns, a local farmer and community leader.
Blakeley was purchased in 1943 by industrialist Raymond J. Funkhouser, who undertook its restoration. Funkhouser had also purchased Claymont Court, which he used as his residence. It was Funkhouser who, feeling that a Washington house should be more grand, and wishing to complement Claymont Court, added the two-story portico. The interior was more carefully renovated, and in keeping with the historical record.

List of New Jersey Devils draft picks

The New Jersey Devils are a professional ice hockey team based in Newark, New Jersey. They are members of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). The club was founded in Kansas City, Missouri as the Kansas City Scouts in 1974, moved to Denver, Colorado as the Colorado Rockies after only two seasons, and then settled in New Jersey in 1982. Since arriving in New Jersey, the Devils have drafted 323 players.
The NHL Entry Draft is held each June, allowing teams to select players who have turned 18 years old by September 15 in the year the draft is held. The draft order is determined by the previous season's order of finish, with non-playoff teams drafting first, followed by the teams that made the playoffs, with the specific order determined by the number of points earned by each team. The NHL holds a weighted lottery for the 14 non-playoff teams, allowing the winner to move up a maximum of four positions in the entry draft. The team with the fewest points has the best chance of winning the lottery, with each successive team given a lower chance of moving up in the draft. The Devils have won the lottery once (2011). Between 1986 and 1994, the NHL also held a Supplemental Draft for players in American colleges.
New Jersey's first draft pick was Rocky Trottier, taken eighth overall in the 1982 NHL Entry Draft. The highest New Jersey has ever drafted is second overall, which they did twice; Kirk Muller (1984) and Brendan Shanahan (1987) were taken in the second spot. Fourteen picks went on to play over 1,000 NHL games: Shanahan, Pat Verbeek, Muller, Ken Daneyko, Scott Niedermayer, Brian Rolston, Martin Brodeur, John MacLean, Bill Guerin, Eric Weinrich, Patrik Elias, Petr Sykora, Steve Sullivan, and Jason Smith. On the opposite end of the spectrum, three Devils draftees (Stanislav Gron, Mikko Jokela, and Joey Tenute) have just one NHL game to their credit.
By nationality, the Devils have drafted 155 Canadians, 92 Americans, 26 Russians, 14 Swedes, 11 Finns, 9 Czechs, 6 Slovaks, 3 Germans, 1 Briton, 1 Kazakh, 1 Latvian, 1 Pole, 1 Austrian, 1 Swiss, and 1 Belarusian. The Devils have drafted 12 players from the Oshawa Generals of the Ontario Hockey League, more than from any other team; the OHL also comprises the greatest number of draftees by league for the Devils, as 69 OHL players have been drafted. 184 forwards, 109 defensemen, and 30 goaltenders have been drafted.
The Devils hosted the 2013 NHL Entry Draft at their home rink, the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey. The Devils traded their first round selection to the Vancouver Canucks to acquire goaltender Cory Schneider. After trading their 39th overall selection to the Phoenix Coyotes for the 42nd and 73rd overall selections, they made Steven Santini, a defenseman from the USA Hockey National Team Development Program, their first draft pick. The Devils ended the day by trading their 2015 7th-round selection to the Los Angeles Kings for the Kings' 2013 7th round selection (208th overall), which they used on Anthony Brodeur, a goaltender from Shattuck-St. Mary's. Brodeur is the son of Martin Brodeur, the Devils' longtime goaltender; the elder Brodeur was the one who made the announcement to the crowd, selecting his son in front of his hometown fans.

Mondaicaud Bhagavathi Temple

Mandaikadu Bhagavathi Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to the Hindu goddess Parvati (known as Bhagavathi). It is located near Colachel in the western coast of Kanyakumari district, Tamil Nadu. This is one among the most renowned and important Hindu temples in the district. 
This temple on the sea shore is a sought after pilgrim centre for both people of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Due to some unknown reasons people from Kollam district in Kerala frequent this temple and according to some versions this is due to the links to erstwhile Venadu, an ancient kingdom whose capital was Kollam. Venadu traces the links to imperial Cheras, from the three kingdoms of extreme south India Chera, Chola and Pandya. These are said to be three brothers from ancient Porkai, near Thiruchendoor. Travancore kings were from the Chera lineage as believed. Many temples in the region are traced to Chera and Pandya lineages, the former more.
The Kodai festival at Mondaicaudu is a major celebration in the region and as in Sabarimala people flock here, especially women. To accommodate the large populations special buses run between Nagercoil and nearby towns at the time, there are also chain services operated from Thiruvananthapuram. The idol here is unique and is earthy. The worship is also unique as it is not forbidden to cook and eat non-vegetarian foods, as in most other major Hindu temples, during the festival. One can see meat being cooked during the Ponkala days around the temple. 
There is a folk history that Velu Thampi, a minister of Travancore, took over the temple from a local Nayar Tharavadu at Colachel, after a tussle, and the then Karanavar cursed him and killed himself, later Velu Thampi himself driven to the same fate after his fights with the British. The take over of Hindu temples by the state ensued during the British times in Travancore later.
The goddess of this temple is also linked with Akilathirattu Ammanai, the holy text of Ayyavazhi. Though Bhagavathi is mentioned in Akilam, its view over the goddess is different to that of the other Hindu views.

Buzzer (whirligig)

A buzzer (buzz, bullroarer, button-on-a-string), is an ancient mechanical device used for ceremonial purposes and as a toy. It is constructed by centring an object at the midpoint of a cord or thong and winding the cord while holding the ends stationary. The object is whirled by alternately pulling and releasing the tension on the cord. The whirling object makes a buzzing or humming sound, giving the device its common name.
A buzzer is often constructed by running string through two of the holes on a large button and is a common and easily made toy.
American Indians used the buzzer as a toy and, also ceremonially, as to call up the wind. Early Indian buzzers were constructed of wood, bone, or stone, and date from at least the Fourche Maline Culture, c. 500 B.C.

Iraiyanar Akapporul

Iraiyaṉār Akapporuḷ, or Kaḷaviyal eṉṟa Iraiyaṉār Akapporuḷ, literally "Iraiyanar's treatise on the love-theme, called 'The study of stolen love'" () is an early mediaeval work on Tamil poetics, specifically, on the literary conventions associated with the akam tradition of Tamil love poetry. The date of the work is uncertain, but it is generally taken to have been composed between the fifth and eighth centuries.
The Akapporul consists of a set of sixty nūṟpās - terse epigrams written in verse which codify rules - attributed to Iraiyanar. The received text of the accompanied by a long prose treatise on akam poetics attributed to Nakkiraṉār, which is structured as a commentary on the nūṟpās, but significantly expands on them and introduces several new ideas. The work as a whole occupies an important place in the history of Tamil literature for several reasons. The poetical argument of the work, and in particular Nakkiranar's treatment of traditional love episodes as successives scenes in an unfolding drama, was extremely influential in the development of Tamil love poetry and poetics in the mediaeval and pre-colonial periods. Secondly. Nakkiranar's treatise is both the first major Tamil work to be written entirely in prose, and the first erudite textual commentary in Tamil, and as such stylistically shaped the development of the Tamil prose and commentarial traditions. Finally, the work also contains the oldest account of the Sangam legend, which has played a significant role in modern Tamil consciousness.
Layers, authorship and dating.
The Iraiyanar Akapporul in its present form is a composite work, containing three distinct texts with different authors. These are sixty nūṟpās which constitute the core of the original Iraiyanar Akapporul, a long prose commentary on the nūṟpās, and a set of poems called the Pāṇṭikkōvai which are embedded within the commentary.
The nūṟpās.
The original Iraiyanar Akapporul consisted of sixty brief verses - called nūṟpās - that, in total, contain 149 lines. The verses show a number of similarities with the poruḷatikāram section of the Tolkappiyam - an old manual on Tamil grammar, poetics and prosody - both in its vocabulary and the core concepts it discusses. Takahashi suggests that this work was originally composed as a practical handbook for writing love poetry in accordance with the conventions of the akam tradition. The intent behind its composition, according to him, was to produce something that was more accessible and useful to poets than existing theoretical works on poetics, such as the poruḷatikāram. 
The author of the sixty verses is unknown. Nakkiranar's commentary states that the verses were found inscribed on three copper plates under the altar to Shiva in Madurai, in the time of the Pandiyan king Ukkiraperuvaluti, who is also mentioned in the Akananuru as being the king who ordered its compilation. Nakkiranar says their author was Shiva himself, "the flame-hued lord of Alavayil in Madurai". Later sources, such as Ilampuranar's commentary on the Tolkappiyam, name the author of the sixty nūṟpās as "Iraiyanar", which literally means "lord", but is also a common name of Shiva. Apart from this legend, there is no tradition or concrete evidence as to who their human author was. Zvelebil and Marr suggest that the author was a poet or grammarian, possibly called Iraiyanar, and that the text itself had probably been stored in the temple at Madurai under Shiva's altar, where it was rediscovered in the time of Ukkiraperuvaluti. A poem in the Sangam anthology Kuruntokai is also attributed to Iraiyanar, and Marr goes on to suggest that the author of the nūṟpās may have been the same person as the author of that poem.
The verses are also difficult to date. The commentary says that they were composed in the Sangam period, but the scholarly consensus is that they are from a later date. Takahashi and Zvelebil assign them to a period between the fifth and sixth centuries, on the basis that their relationship to the poruḷatikāram suggests that they were composed a few generations after the final redaction of the poruḷatikāram, which they date to the 4th - 5th centuries. Marr takes the view that the similarities between the nūṟpās and the poruḷatikāram indicate that the two were broadly contemporaneous, and drew upon common poetic ideas and definitions.
Nakkiranar's commentary.
The second component of the work is Nakkiranar's treatise on love poetics which, although structured as a commentary, is treated by modern scholars as an erudite work in its own right. It is several times the length of the verses themselves, running to over two hundred pages in Tamil. The treatise is written in the tone and style of a discourse of the type that might be heard at a literary academy. The commentary uses a number of rhetorical devices. Nakkiranar repeatedly poses hypothetical questions and objections, to which he presents answers and rebuttals which are directly addressed to the reader, as if the reader himself was the questioner. He also uses stories, anecdotes and legends to illustrate specific points, and draws extensively on the then-existing corpus of Tamil akam poetry to provide examples of the poetical techniques he discusses.
The commentary says that it was written by Nakkiranar, son of Kanakkayanar. A number of traditions connect Nakkiranar with the Sangam age. The commentary itself claims to have been written in the Sangam age, and names Nakkiranar as one of the poets of the Third Sangam. Later legends recorded in the Tiruvilayadarpuranam say he was the president of the Third Sangam, and there are extant Sangam poems attributed to a poet by that name. The scholarly consensus, however, is that the commentary was written some centuries after the end of the Sangam period, on the basis that its language differs significantly in structure and vocabulary from that of Sangam literature, and that it cites verses which use a metre - "kattalaikkalitturai" - not found in Sangam literature. Zvelebil suggests that the Nakkiranar who wrote this commentary may be the same as the composer of the Tirumurukarruppatai. 
The commentary records that it was transmitted orally for eight generations, until it was finally committed to writing by Nilakantanar of Musiri, a tradition which Zvelebil and Marr find credible. Early scholars, such as S. Vaiyapuri Pillai, dated the commentary to a period as late as the 10th - 12th century, on the basis that the author appeared to be familiar with the 10th century Civakacintamani. Modern scholars, however, tend to view these as later interpolations into the text, and date the commentary itself to a period closer to the 8th century on the basis of its relationship with the Pāṇṭikkōvai. Zvelebil suggests that many of these may have been inserted by Nilakantanar of Musiri, who he suggests added an introduction and more modern quotations into the text when he wrote it down.
The Pāṇṭikkōvai.
The third component of the text is the Pāṇṭikkōvai, a work containing a series of related akam poems about the seventh century Pandiyan king, Nedumaran. Nakkiranar's commentary uses a number of verses from this poem to illustrate points he makes concerning the poetics of Tamil akam poetry - of the 379 quotations in the commentary, all but 50 are from the Pāṇṭikkōvai. The Pāṇṭikkōvai is believed to have had 400 quatrains in its original form, 329 of which are preserved in Nakkiranar's commentary. The author of the Pāṇṭikkōvai is unknown; however, the poem is interesting in itself as one of the earliest literary works written in the form of a kōvai - a series of interlinked poems which became one of the mainstays of akam poetry in mediaeval Tamil literature.
Modern editions and translations.
The text of the Akapporul is almost always printed together with the commentary of Nakkiranar, and the two are usually treated as a unity. T.G. Aravamuthan suggests that Ilampuranar, the author of a celebrated 11th-12th century commentary on the Tolkappiyam, also wrote a second commentary on the work, but this is no longer extant.
The Akapporul was transmitted for several centuries in the form palm-leaf manuscripts. The first printed edition was prepared by Damodaram Pillai in 1883. The first critical edition, based on a comparison of all manuscript copies that were then available, was prepared in 1939 by K.V. Govindaraja Mudaliyar and M.V. Venugopala Pillai. A second critical edition, which took into account a few additional manuscripts that came to light subsequently, was published by the Saiva Siddhantha Works Publishing Society in 1969.
An English translation of the nūṟpās and commentary was published by Buck and Paramasivan in 1997. A new translation, with annotations, is currently under preparation by a team of scholars including Jean-Luc Chevillard, Thomas Lehmann and Takanobu Takahashi, and is scheduled to be published in 2008.
Content.
Iraiyanar Akapporul is concerned with setting out the literary conventions that govern Tamil love poetry of the akam tradition. The conventions, as such, are taken from the poetics of the Sangam period. Thus a poem is a poetical snapshot of one instant in a relationship. This snapshot provides a glimpse into the lives of the couple which is in love. In addition, each poem must consist of actual words spoken by one of the persons involved in the relationship, without any commentary by an omniscient narrator. Only certain characters may speak - the hero (talaivaṉ) and heroine (talaivi), a close male friend of the hero (tōḻaṉ) or a close female friend of the heroine (tōḻi), a mother or foster-mother, priests, courtesans, bards who mediate between a wife and husband, and a few other characters. The words spoken must also be addressed to a listener - the conventions of "akam" poetry did not permit soliloquies. However, the listener need not necessarily be the person to whom the words are seemingly addressed. A common device in akam poetry is to have words seemingly spoken to a friend, but actually intended for the speaker's lover, who the speaker knows is eavesdropping.
The content of the poems is highly conventionalised. Each poem must belong to one of five tiṇais, poetical modes or themes. Each mode consists of a complete poetical landscape - a definite time, place, season in which the poem is set - and background elements characteristic of that landscape - including flora and fauna, inhabitants, deities and social organisation - that provide imagery for poetic metaphors. The modes are associated with specific aspects of relationships, such as the first meeting, separation, quarrelling, pining and waiting. Each mode is named for the chief flower in the landscape with which it is associated. The table to the left gives an example of the various elements which the text associates with the mode "marutam."
In Sangam literature, the composition of such a poem describing an instant in a relationship was an end in itself. In the Iraiyanar Akapporul, however, its purpose is more complex. Each poem is an instant in a developing relationship, and is ordinarily preceded and followed by other poems that describe preceding and succeeding instants in the same relationship. The instants described by each poem must, therefore, also develop the plot, and the character of the persons who are the subject of the work. Thus the Iraiyanar Akapporul discusses the importance of the essential characteristics of the hero and heroine, and the tension between each of these characteristics and the love and desire of the couple for each other. Each of the moments described in successive poems, set in an appropriate tiṇai, moves this along, by describing how the couple react to each other in the context of specific situations.
The text divides the evolution of a relationship into two phases, the phase of kaḷavu or "stolen" love, and the phase of kaṟpu or "chaste" love. Love is considered to be "stolen" before marriage, and "chaste" after marriage. A number of situations can occur within each phase. Within the phase of "stolen" love, for instance, situations that may exist include a nighttime tryst (iravukkuṟi), a daytime tryst (pakaṟkuṟi), the friend urging the hero to marry the heroine (varaivu vēṭkai), the hero temporarily leaving the heroine to avoid gossip (oruvaḻittaṇattal), and so on. Similarly, within the phase of "chaste" love, situations that may arise include the newly-wed phase (kaṭimaṉai), the necessity to discharge duties (viṉai muṟṟal), separation so that the hero can earn money (poruṭpiṇi pirivu), and so on. Later texts, such as Akapporul Vilakkam, discuss a third intermediate phase, that of the marriage itself, but Iraiyanar Akapporul does not treat this as being a separate phase, though it does deal with some of the situations that later texts classify under the phase of marriage. In his commentary on Iraiyanar's penultimate verse, Nakkiranar explains in detail how, by carefully choosing the situations, speakers and tiṇais, a series of episodes can be woven into a seamless narrative detailing the history of a relationship.
Context and influence.
Poetical context.
The treatise contains the oldest full-length exposition of poetical devices central to akam poetry, including the five tiṇais or landscapes into which all love poems were classified, and the various kuṟṟus or speakers whose emotions and expression the poems sought to articulate. However, its principal purpose was not to clarify or explain the ancient akam tradition. 
At the time the work was written, a new class of work - called ciṟṟilakkiyam, or "short literature" - was emerging in Tamil literature. Unlike the old akam tradition, which mainly focused on short poems dealing with a single, detached scene in the life of a pair of lovers, these works sought to depict a complete story. This was not in itself alien to Tamil literature, in that epics - peruṅkāppiyam in Tamil - such as the Cilappatikaram dealt with whole stories. Works of the ciṟṟilakkiyam tradition, however, sought to do so on a less grand scale, through longer series of related poems which described successive episodes that cumulatively chart the entire course of a relationship. 
It is in relation to these that the text had its longest-lasting impact. By chronologically ordering the isolated moments which Tamil akam poetry, and describing how they fit into a serialised plot, the text - and in particular, Nakkiranar's commentary - related the emergent ciṟṟilakkiyam tradition to the ancient akam tradition, and thereby helped create a new approach to literature, on the basis on which a plethora of new literary forms developed in succeeding centuries. The kovai, in particular, came to dominate secular and religious akam poetry in the mediaeval period. The very last example of akam poetry, written before the tradition was suppressed by seventeenth century religious revivalism, is a 600-verse kōvai, composed by Kachchaiyappar Sivachariyar and embedded into his Tanikaippuranam.
Stylistic influences.
Nakkiranar's commentary also created a basic template which all subsequent commentaries on Tamil texts followed. Each verse of the original text is followed by a commentary on that verse, which explains its content, and presents examples chosen from extant literature and where necessary quotes previous authors in support of the commentator's claims. Nakkiranar, for example, frequently quotes rules from the Tolkappiyam, Akattiyam and other works on grammar and poetics to support his literary theories, and illustrates these theories by quoting from the Pāṇṭikkōvai, Cilappatikaram and poetry of the Sangam age, weaving all these into his prose commentary in a manner that highlights his points. In addition, the comments on the initial verses, and on the final one, present additional material dealing with general themes, which goes beyond a simple elucidation of the verses on which they comment. Thus Nakkiranar, in addition to simply commenting on Iraiyanar's verses, here outlines rules for the structure and content of a commentary, discusses the manner in which conventions regarding love-poetry should be presented, and sets out general observations on history.
Historical and social context.
The work, and in particular the commentary of Nakkiranar, reinterprets the Tamil akam tradition in the light of the Shaivite bhakti tradition, which was then sweeping through Tamil Nadu in a wave of Hindu revivalism. A commentary, in the Indian tradition, plays an important role in reinterpreting and reworking the applicability of a text or tradition in the context of changing historical or social circumstances. Nakkiranar's commentary thus plays the role of reclaiming the Tamil akam tradition - secular in appearance, and associated with Jainism - for the Tamil Shaivite tradition. This reappropriation had a significant effect on the Tamil bhakti tradition, whose poems, from the ninth century onwards, make extensive use of the conventions of the akam tradition, but in the context of describing the love of a devotee for God.

OneFS distributed file system

The OneFS file system is a parallel distributed networked file system designed by Isilon Systems for use in its Isilon IQ storage appliances. OneFS is a FreeBSD variant and utilizes zsh as its shell. OneFS has its own specialized command set, all of which start with "isi", which is used to administer the system.
On-disk Structure.
All data structures in the OneFS file system maintain their own protection information. This means in the same filesystem, one file may be protected at +1 (basic parity protection) while another may be protected at +4 (resilient to four failures) while yet another file may be protected at 2x (mirroring); this feature is referred to as FlexProtect. FlexProtect is also responsible for automatically rebuilding the data in the event of a failure. The protection levels available are based on the number of nodes in the cluster and follow the Reed Solomon Algorithm. Blocks for an individual file are spread across the nodes; for example, block 0 may be on Node 3, block 1 on Node 1, and the related parity block on Node 5. This allows entire nodes to fail without losing access to any data. File metadata, directories, snapshot structures, quotas structures, and a logical inode mapping structure are all based on mirrored B+ trees. Block addresses are generalized 64-bit pointers that reference (node, drive, blknum) tuples. The native block size is 8192 bytes; inodes are 512 bytes on disk.
One distinctive characteristic of OneFS is that metadata is spread throughout the nodes in a homogeneous fashion. There are no dedicated metadata servers. The only piece of metadata that is replicated on every node is the address list of root btree blocks of the inode mapping structure. Everything else can be found from that starting point, following the generalized 64-bit pointers.
Clustering.
Nodes running OneFS must be connected together with a high performance, low-latency back-end network for optimal performance. OneFS 1.0-3.0 used Gigabit Ethernet as that back-end network. Starting with OneFS 3.5, Isilon offered Infiniband models. Now all nodes sold utilize an Infiniband back-end.
Data, metadata, locking, transaction, group management, allocation, and event traffic go over the back-end RPC system. All data and metadata transfers are zero-copy. All modification operations to on-disk structures are transactional and journaled.
Protocols.
OneFS is equipped with options for accessing storage via NFS, CIFS/SMB, FTP, HTTP, iSCSI, and HDFS. It can utilize non-local authentication such as Active Directory, LDAP, and NIS. It is also capable of interfacing with backup devices using NDMP.

The V-Cube 6 is the 6×6×6 version of Rubik's Cube. Unlike the original puzzle (but like the 4×4×4 cube), it has no fixed facets: the center facets (16 per face) are free to move to different positions. It was invented by Panagiotis Verdes and is produced by the Greek company Verdes Innovations SA.
Methods for solving the 3×3×3 cube work for the edges and corners of the 6×6×6 cube, as long as one has correctly identified the relative positions of the colors — since the center facets can no longer be used for identification.
Mechanics.
The puzzle consists of 152 pieces ("cubies") on the surface. There are also 60 movable pieces entirely hidden within the interior of the cube, as well as six fixed pieces attached to the central "spider" frame. The V-Cube 7 uses essentially the same mechanism, except that on the latter these hidden pieces (corresponding to the center rows) are made visible.
There are 96 center pieces which show one color each, 48 edge pieces which show two colors each, and eight corner pieces which show three colors. Each piece (or quartet of edge pieces) shows a unique color combination, but not all combinations are present (for example, there is no edge piece with both red and orange sides, since red and orange are on opposite sides of the solved Cube). The location of these cubes relative to one another can be altered by twisting the layers of the Cube 90°, 180° or 270°, but the location of the colored sides relative to one another in the completed state of the puzzle cannot be altered: it is fixed by the distribution of color combinations on edge and corner pieces. 
Currently, the V-Cube 6 is produced with white plastic as a base, with red opposite orange, blue opposite green, and yellow opposite black. One black center piece is branded with the letter V. Verdes also sells a version with black plastic and a white face, with the other colors remaining the same.
Unlike the rounded V-Cube 7, the V-Cube 6 has flat faces. However, the outermost pieces are slightly wider than those in the center. The center four rows are approximately wide, whereas the outer two are approximately wide. This subtle difference allows the use of a thicker stalk to hold the corner pieces to the internal mechanism, thus making the puzzle more durable.
Permutations.
There are 8 corner, 48 edges and 96 centers.
Any permutation of the corners is possible, including odd permutations. Seven of the corners can be independently rotated, and the orientation of the eighth depends on the other seven, giving 8!×37 combinations. 
There are 96 centers, consisting of four sets of 24 pieces each. Within each set there are four centers of each color. Centers from one set cannot be exchanged with those from another set. Each set can be arranged in 24! different ways. Assuming that the four centers of each color in each set are indistinguishable, the number of permutations is reduced to 24!/(4!6) arrangements. The reducing factor comes about because there are 4! ways to arrange the four pieces of a given color. This is raised to the sixth power because there are six colors. The total number of center permutations is the permutations of a single set raised to the fourth power, 24!4/(4!24).
There are 48 edges, consisting of 24 inner and 24 outer edges. These cannot be flipped (because the internal shape of the pieces is asymmetrical), nor can an inner edge exchange places with an outer edge. The four edges in each matching quartet are distinguishable, since corresponding edges are mirror images of each other. Any permutation of the edges in each set is possible, including odd permutations, giving 24! arrangements for each set or 24!2 total, regardless of the position or orientation any other pieces.
Assuming the cube does not have a fixed orientation in space, and that the permutations resulting from rotating the cube without twisting it are considered identical, the number of permutations is reduced by a factor of 24. This is because the 24 possible positions and orientations of the first corner are equivalent because of the lack of fixed centers. This factor does not appear when calculating the permutations of N×N×N cubes where N is odd, since those puzzles have fixed centers which identify the cube's spatial orientation.
This gives a total number of permutations of
The entire number is 157 152 858 401 024 063 281 013 959 519 483 771 508 510 790 313 968 742 344 694 684 829 502 629 887 168 573 442 107 637 760 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 (around 157 novemdecillion on the long scale or 157 septentrigintillion on the short scale).
One of the black center pieces is marked with a V, which distinguishes it from the other three in its set. This increases the number of patterns by a factor of four to 6.29×10116, although any of the four possible positions for this piece could be regarded as correct.
Solutions.
There are a number of methods that can be used to solve a V-Cube 6. One method is to first group the center pieces of common colors together, then to match up edges that show the same two colors. Once this is done, turning only the outer layers of the cube allows it to be solved like a 3×3×3 cube. However, certain positions that cannot be solved on a standard 3×3×3 cube may be reached. For instance, a single quartet of edges may be inverted, or the cube may appear to have an odd permutation (that is, two pieces must be swapped, which is not possible on the 3×3×3 cube). These situations are known as parity errors, and require special algorithms to be solved.
Another similar approach to solving this cube is to first pair the edges, and then the centers. This, too, is vulnerable to the parity errors described above.
Other methods solve the cube by solving a cross and the centers, but not solving any of the edges and corners not needed for the cross, then the other edges would be placed similar to the 3x3 Fridrich method.
Some methods are designed to avoid the parity errors described above. For instance, solving the corners and edges first and the centers last would avoid such parity errors. Once the rest of the cube is solved, any permutation of the center pieces can be solved. Note that it is possible to apparently exchange a pair of face centers by cycling 3 face centers, two of which are visually identical.
Records.
The current world record is held by Kevin Hays of the USA, with a time of 1 minute 40.86 seconds using a Shengshou 6x6, set at the "Vancouver Summer 2013" tournament. The best average record is also held by Hays, with a time of 1 minute 51.30 seconds, also set at the same event using a Shengshou 6x6.

Friedrich Asinger

Friedrich Asinger (* 26 June 1907 in Freiland/Niederdonau (Austria); † 7 March 1999 in Aachen) was an Austrian chemist and professor for Technical Chemistry. He is well known for his development of a multi-component reaction, the Asinger reaction for the synthesis of 3-thiazolines. 
Life and Work.
Asinger grew up with an older brother and two sisters in Lower Austria, as son of the head of a paper and cardboard factory. His mother came from a family of innkeepers. He graduated in 1924 from the upper secondary school in Krems an der Donau at the age of 17. He studied chemistry at the Vienna University of Technology, where he became in 1932 an academic student of Friedrich Böck (1876-1958). He successfully defended his PhD thesis on "Über den Einfluß von Substituenten auf die Verseifungsgeschwindigkeit von Benzalchlorid (The Influence of substituents on the saponification rate of benzal chloride)" and graduated with distinction.
Asinger spent several years as department head in different companies in the chemical industry. He worked with the company Koreska, a factory for the production of chemically prepared paper, as a chemist at the Vacuum Oil Company in Vienna, and since 1. May 1937 as a research chemist in the Central Testing Laboratory of the ammonia plants in Leuna GmbH Merseburg. In 1943 he obtained his Habilitation at the University of Graz. He became first lecturer at the University of Halle-Wittenberg on 23. February 1944. He took several positions in university and industrial research, in example he was an honorary lecturer at the University of Halle-Wittenberg where Karl Ziegler was the department head. 
Because of his membership in the NSDAP, where he was a member since 1933 he was discharged in December 1945 as an honorary lecturer. His efforts to reverse his dismissal, despite written support from the Leuna plant - also with reference to the benevolence of his Russian superiors - and supporting letters from various social organizations, were without success.
In October 1946, Asinger was deported together with 34 chemists, physicists and engineers of the Leuna-Werke to the Soviet Union to Dzerzhinsk, near Gorky. Asinger worked as group leader in the development of rocket propellants. From 1951 on he worked in Rubeshnoe in Donbass. During the eight years of his deportation, he observed that the reaction of ketones or aldehydes, Sulfur or hydrogen sulphide together with ammonia or amines led to various nitrogen- and sulfur-containing heterocycles. In his spare time Asinger began to write on the monographs "Chemie und Technologie der Paraffine (Chemistry and Technology of paraffins)" and "Chemie und Technologie der Monoolefine (Chemistry and Technology of monoolefins)", which were published later in 1956 and 1957 in the "Akademie-Verlag", Berlin. In 1954 he returned to Germany, three years later than most of the other scientists of the Leuna works. He worked at Leuna and at the same time as Honorary Professor in Halle-Wittenberg. In 1957 he was appointed as Chair of Organic Chemistry at the Martin-Luther-University in Halle, Saxony-Anhalt and later at the Dresden University of Technology. Asinger encouraged H. G. O. Becker and other senior assistants to write the "Organikum", a workbook for the basic training in organic chemistry which is popular to this day (total circulation: nearly 400 000). The book was written as an obligation on the occasion of the 10th Anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic.
In 1959 he left the German Democratic Republic as a citizen of Austria and took a position at the RWTH Aachen, where he became head of the Institute for Technical Chemistry and Petrochemistry.
In his years of academic research he further developed the chemistry of nitrogen-sulfur heterocycles, so that this chemistry is also known as "Asinger chemistry". A milestone of this chemistry is the Total synthesis of D-penicillamine in a thirteen-step synthesis, starting from isobutyraldehyde, ammonia and sulfur. He published 118 papers on this topic.
In 1972 Asinger retired in Aachen.
Well-known students of Asinger are in example Heribert Offermanns, a longtime board member of the Degussa AG, Egon Fanghänel, professor of organic chemistry at the Technical University Merseburg and then at the University of Halle-Wittenberg, and Karl Gewald, who is best known for the development of the Gewald reaction and his work in the field of thiophenes and heterocycles.

Eleni Tzoka

Eleni Tzoka (née Milopoulou) (born April 27, 1956 in Bielawa, Poland) is a Polish female singer of Greek descent.
Biography.
Tzoka was born to a Greek family which emigrated to Poland in the 1950s. At an early age, she was familiarized with music by her parents and numerous siblings (she was the ninth child) who would constantly play or sing. She first sang in public when she attended elementary school. At that time she belonged to a children's group "Niezapominajki" ("Forget-me-nots"). Several years later she became a vocalist in Ballada, a group that was formed in her secondary school.
Tzoka started her professional career in 1975 when she joined Prometheus, a newly founded music band that was mainly active in Sopot in northern Poland. On July 20 of the same year, she debuted at a concert in Gdańsk.
Eleni, as she is commonly referred to in Poland, released her first solo album, "Ty jak niebo, ja – jak obłok", in 1980 (although she had recorded an LP album with Prometheus earlier) titled "Po słonecznej stronie życia" ("On the sunny side of life'", 1977). After the release of her solo album, she became popular. She began giving concerts all over Poland as well as abroad. Among many other countries, she visited Australia; France; Sweden; Canada; and the United States, where she sang for the Polish diaspora.
Tzoka participated in the National Festival of Polish Song in Opole four times: in 1984, 1990, 1991 and 1993. She is married to Fotis Tzokas, the brother of Kostas Tzokas, who was the founder of Prometheus. Fotis Tzokas is currently her personal manager and composes some of her songs.
In 1994, Tzoka's 17-year-old daughter, Afrodyta, was murdered by her ex-boyfriend, Piotr. Tzoka openly forgave the killer of her only child. It was reported that when she was informed about her daughter's death, she immediately phoned the mother of Afrodyta's boyfriend and told her without anger that they had "lost their children". She was honoured for that act of mercy in 1999 with the Saint Rita of Cascia prize, which is awarded yearly to women of different religious beliefs who have overcome a tragic event in their lives.
Tzoka has been awarded many other prizes. In 2002, she was given the statuette of "Złota Muza Polskich Nagrań" from a Polish state music company Polskie Nagrania. Apart from music-related awards, she was also honoured (2003) with the Złote Serce ("Heart of Gold") prize from the Saint Stanisław Kostka Foundation for the Disabled Children and Youth in Katowice for her "generosity, kindness, understanding, co-operativeness, namely everything that makes the realization of laudable aims for the environment of disabled children and youth possible". In 2004, she was given the Medal of Saint Brother Albert for her commitment to charity related with the help for the people living with AIDS as well as the disabled. The official justification for the prize included her meetings with the youth and the charity concerts given in social assistance centres and prisons. Tzoka is also the holder of a prestigious title of the Knight of the Order of Smile.
Tzoka is the author of a book "Nic miłości nie pokona" ("Nothing will defeat love") published in 2006. This illustrated album contains an interview given to a Pauline monk, fr. Robert Łukaszuk, in which she talks about her life, human sufferings, love, the meaning of charity, as well as her artistic experiences.
Style of music.
Prometheus, the band Tzoka has belonged to since 1975, typically played traditional Greek music. Their shows included Greek dances, which were very popular among the audience. Tzoka's music is characterized by optimism and melodiousness.

Kepler Lake () is a reservoir located in Northwest Louisiana, USA. It is about from Castor, from Jamestown, from Bienville and about from Gibsland, Louisiana. Kepler is an open lake available for fishing and boating. Kepler's spillway drains into Black Lake Bayou which drains into Black Lake in Natchitoches Parish. Piney Woods Road is the only road that crosses Kepler. The Kepler spillway is located on the south side of the lake. Kepler has several boat launches and landings used for camping. Construction of the spillway was completed in 1958.
Kepler is home to a variety of wildlife ranging from alligators, bass, bream, perch, gar, and most notably its catfish. 
Kepler has many houses on its banks. People who live about the waterway are referred to as the Kepler Lake Community. The Kepler Lake Community have Jamestown addresses and ZIP Codes but Castor phone numbers and live within the Castor district of the Bienville Parish School Board.
Landscape.
Kepler Lake is small in comparison to other lakes in Louisiana. At the main boat launch—near the spillway—one can see across the entirety of the lake to the white-concrete Piney Woods road bridge. Channels have been cut into Kepler Lake to ensure boaters do not run their boats onto stumps. In recent years, there have been extensive draining of Kepler just to remove the stumps.
Geography.
Kepler's coordinates are N 32.31682 and W -93.1535 and its altitude is 171 feet (52 m).

Atlas Grove

Atlas Grove is a nickname for a grove of coast redwood trees in California at Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park. It contains the third largest coast redwood, Iluvatar.
According to author Richard Preston, the Atlas Grove was discovered by naturalist Michael Taylor in 1991.
Among tree hunters and botanists, some trees are given names unofficially. On the other hand, over 900 groves have been named in honor of people, families or organizations: said to be an "everlasting memorial to an individual, family or organization". Nobody has openly disclosed or discounted whether the Atlas Grove is one of over 900 dedicated memorial groves.
A part of the Atlas Grove was studied; referred to as the Atlas Project, confined to approximately 1 hectare. The location of this stand of trees is undisclosed. For importance, the Atlas Grove is virtually on par with the Grove of Titans, another undisclosed grove with titan redwoods.
Trees in the stand were measured with tapes and laser range finders. 20 days, with 5 climbers, was spent just for measuring Iluvatar. Scientific studies were done with moisture, light and sap flow sensors. Wildlife in the grove was studied too, including the wandering salamander ("Aneides vagrans"). 
This grove contains other old coast redwoods including Atlas Tree, Gaia, Pleiades, Ballantine, Prometheus, Bell and others. Neighboring species include Douglas-fir ("Pseudotsuga menziesii"), sitka spruce ("Picea sitchensis"), bigleaf maple ("Acer macrophyllum"), Cascara buckthorn ("Rhamnus purshiana"), California laurel ("Umbellularia californica"), western hemlock ("Tsuga heterophylla"), Port Orford–cedar ("Chamaecyparis lawsoniana") and tanoak ("Lithocarpus densiflorus").

1949–56 Palestinian exodus

The 1949–1956 Palestinian exodus was the continuation of the 1947-49 exodus of Palestinian Arabs from Israeli controlled territory after the signing of the ceasefire agreements. This period of the Exodus was characterised predominantly by forced expulsion during the consolidation of the state of Israel and ever increasing tension along the cease fire lines ultimately leading to the Suez crisis.
Between 1949 and 1950, according to historian Benny Morris, Israel had displaced and expelled between 30,000 to 40,000 Palestinians and Bedouin. Many villages along the cease fire lines and the Lebanon border area were also leveled, many emptied villages were resettled by new Jewish immigrants and demobilized Israeli military forces.
Israel argued this was motivated by security considerations linked with the situation at the borders. During the consolidation period Israel was more intent on gaining control of the demilitarized zones on the Syrian, Jordanian and Egyptian fronts than on her image abroad.
Background.
On 30 May 1948, Yosef Weitz, head of the Settlement Department of the Jewish National Fund (JNF) recorded in his diary:
"We have begun the operation of cleansing, removing the rubble and preparing the villages for cultivation and settlement. Some of these will become parks"
Immediately after the Arab-Israeli conflict, Israel started on a process of nation building with the first general elections held on 25 January 1949. Chaim Weizmann was installed as Israel's first President and Ben-Gurion as head of the Mapai party attained the position he had held in the Provisional government of Israel that of Prime minister of Israel. Ben-Gurion emphatically rejected the return of refugees in the Israeli Cabinet decision of June 1948 reiterated in a letter to the UN of 2 August 1949 containing the Text of a statement made by Moshe Sharett on 1 August 1948 where the basic attitude of the Israeli Government was that a solution must be sought, not through the return of the refugees to Israel, but through the resettlement of the Palestinian Arab refugee population in other states.
The Israeli government was of the view that the Armistice agreements gave them 3 indisputable rights:
The Arab nations conversely also saw the General Armistice Agreements as conferring 3 rights:
Security.
Israeli security was thought of on two levels general security and daily security. The general security covered the threat of invasion while daily security was to secure Israeli territory from infiltration. This was achieved by three processes. The transfer of Israeli Arabs away from the cease fire lines to urban areas of concentration such as Jaffa and Haifa; the resettlement of the areas cleared, mainly by mizrahim (oriental Jews) in moshavim along the cease fire lines; and operating a free fire policy.
Once the fighting phase of the 1948 Arab-Israeli war had ceased with a truce, the Israeli bureaucracy was faced with the overwhelming task of ruling effectively over dozens of severely disrupted Israeli Arab villages and towns, where thousands of displaced Palestinians had taken refuge. Since the Israeli state did not trust its Israeli Arab citizens seeing them as a potential 5th Column, it placed this entire population under a tight military regime supervised by the Central Committee for Arab Affairs. Established in 1954, the committee had representatives from the police and the domestic intelligence agency, Shabak, as well as the prime minister’s consultant for Arab affairs and the commander-in-chief of military rule. In concert, the committee presided over three regional sub-committees (south, center and north), which dealt with the daily business of governance.
The Registration of Residents ordinance of 1949 left those unregistered Palestinian Arabs without legal status and vulnerable to deportation. The abandoned Property law of 1950; where the moveable and immovable property belonging to the refugees was effectively appropriated by the state of Israel applied not just to Palestinian refugees who had left Israeli territory but also to Palestinian Arabs who had remained in Israel but who had left their ordinary place of residence. One quarter of the Arab citizens of Israel are "internal refugees," who until 1948 resided in villages that were destroyed in the war.
Infiltration.
The estimates for 1949 to 1956 was that 90% of all infiltration was motivated by social and economic concerns. It was naturally difficult to prevent refugees who were living on a bare subsistence level, from crossing lines beyond which they hope to find fodder for their hungry sheep, or for scarce fuel. Additionally there occurred occasional nightly clandestine smuggling between Gaza and Hebron. The smuggling was largely motivated by the great discrepancy of prices prevailing in the two areas.
Arab countries anti-infiltration policies.
The Israeli Government position was that the Arab countries were aiding and abetting the infiltrators in an extension of the Arab Israeli conflict by using the infiltrators as guerillas. This was grossly inaccurate.
The problem of establishing and guarding the demarcation line separating the Gaza Strip from the Israeli-held Negev area, proved a vexing one: largely due to the presence of more than 200,000 Palestinian Arab refugees in this Gaza area. The terms of the Armistice Agreement restricted Egypt’s use and deployment of regular armed forces in the Gaza strip. In keeping with this restriction the Egyptian Government’s answer was to form a Palestinian para-military police force. The Palestinian Border police was created in December 1952. The Border police were placed under the command of ‘Abd-al-Man’imi ‘Abd-al-Ra’uf, a former Egyptian air brigade commander, member of the Muslim Brotherhood and member of the Revolutionary Council. 250 Palestinian volunteers started training in March 1953 with further volunteers coming forward for training in May and December 1953. Part of the Border police personnel were attached to the Military Governor’s office and placed under ‘Abd-al-‘Azim al-Saharti to guard public installations in the Gaza strip.
On the Egyptian cease fire line and DMZ to try to avoid future incidents caused by infiltration the Mixed Armistice Commission finally decided that a system of mixed border patrols comprising officers and enlisted men from each side would decrease tension and lessen infiltration. Initially The mixed patrols along the Egyptian demarcation line worked satisfactorily.
Free fire policy.
A free fire policy was adopted by the IDF. The policy included patrols, ambushes, laying mines, setting booby traps and carrying out periodic search operations in Israeli Arab villages. The "free fire" policy in the period of 1949 to 1956 has been estimated to account for 2,700 to 5,000 Palestinian Arab deaths. During anti-infiltration operations the Israeli forces sometimes committed atrocities with reports of gang rape, murder and the dumping of 120 suspected infiltrators in the Avara desert without water.
Additionally the IDF carried out operations, mainly, in Jordanian held territory and Egyptian held territory. The early reprisal raids failed to achieve their objectives and managed to increase hatred for Israel amongst the Arab countries and the refugees. The disruptive and destabilizing nature of the raids put the western plans for the defence of the Middle East in jeopardy, the western powers then applied pressure on Israeli to desist.
Continued displacement and dispossession.
From November 1948 through to the summer of 1949 and the signing of the General Armistice Agreements a further 87 villages were occupied; 36 being emptied by force.
From the statistics taken from the official records of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan/Israel Mixed Armistice Commission for the period of June 1949 through December 1952 it is found that Jordan complained of 37 instances of expulsion of Arabs from Israel. For the period 1 January 1953 through to 15 October 1953 it is found that Jordan complained of 7 instances of expulsion of Arabs from Israel involving 41 people.
Galilee.
During Operation Hiram in the upper Galilee, Israeli military commanders received the order: 'Do all you can to immediately and quickly purge the conquered territories of all hostile elements in accordance with the orders issued. The residents should be helped to leave the areas that have been conquered'. (31 October 1948, Moshe Carmel) The UN's acting Mediator, Ralph Bunche, reported that United Nations Observers had recorded extensive looting of villages in Galilee by Israeli forces, which carried away goats, sheep and mules. This looting, United Nations Observers report, appeared to have been systematic as army trucks were used for transportation. The situation, states the report, created a new influx of refugees into Lebanon. Israeli forces, he stated, have occupied the area in Galilee formerly occupied by Kaukji's forces, and have crossed the Lebanese frontier. Bunche goes on to say "that Israeli forces now hold positions inside the south-east corner of Lebanon, involving some fifteen Lebanese villages which are occupied by small Israeli detachments".
An example of the use to which "rumours" were put is given where Glazer comments on the use of psychological warfare against civilians and quotes Nafez Nazzal's description of the Galilee exodus:-
The villages of Ghuweir Abu Shusha were persuaded by neighbouring Jewish Mukhtars to leave to Syria...The villagers heard how ruthless and cruel the Jews were to the people of Deir Yassin and the nearby village of Nasr ed Din. They villagers were not prepared to withstand the Jewish attack and decided to accept their neighbours advice and leave.
The method of planting false atrocity stories to engineer an exodus is borne out by Yigal Allon's Palmach plans to force the exodus of the Palestinian Arabs of Galilee:-
The long battle had weaken our forces and before us stood great duties of blocking the routes of invasion. We therefore looked for means which did not force us into employing force, in order to cause the tens of thousands of sulky Arab who remained in the Galilee to flee, for in case of an Arab invasion they were likely to strike us in the rear.
I gathered all the Jewish Mukhtars who had contact with Arabs in different villages, and asked to whisper in the ear of some Arabs that great Jewish reinforcements had arrived in Galilee and that it is going to burn all the villages of the Huleh. They should suggest to those Arabs, as a friend, to escape while there is still time.
The villages of al Mansura, Tarbikah, Iqrit and Kafr Bir'im in Galilee were entered by IDF forces during late October early November, 1948 after Operation Hiram. The villages being located in an area, 5 km deep parallel to the Israel Lebanon border, were to be evacuated of their Palestinian Arab population. The Israeli forces wanted, for security reasons, the villages populated primarily by Jews. On 13 November 1948 the inhabitants of Kafr Bir'im were requested to evacuated by the IDF ""temporarily"" in expectation of an Arab counter-attack. Emmanuel Friedman an intelligence officer of the 7th Brigade explained the evacuation orders to the villagers, the order having been issued by Bechor Sheetrit. The villagers of Kafr Bir'im initially sought protection in a nearby cave. The then Minister of Police Bechor Sheetrit on seeing the elderly, women and children living in the cave suggested that the villagers move to the town of Jish, where there were 400 abandoned houses, further south "until the military operations are over". Approximately 700 of the Kafr Bir'em villagers found accommodation within Israel, the remaining 250 were encouraged to cross into Lebanon. Archbishop Elias Chacour originally a resident of Iqrit relates in his autobiography how IDF in the spring of 1949 rounded up all the men and older boys in the village (including his own father and three eldest brothers), and trucked them to the border with Jordan. There they were let out and ordered to go to Jordan. The soldiers opened fire, aiming just above their heads, meaning to drive them from their homeland for good. However, Chacour's father and brothers managed to make it back three months later. The operation to achieve a Palestinian Arab free Israel/Lebanon border zone came to an end on 15 16 November leaving Fassuta (Christians), Jish (Maronites), Rihaniya (Circassians), Mi'ilya (Christians) and Jurdiye (Muslims) within the 5–7 km zone.
The first legal action against the state of Israel was brought in 1951 by 5 men of Iqrit with Muhammad Nimr al-Hawari acting as their lawyer. On 31 July 1951 the Israeli courts recognised the rights of the villagers to their land and their right to return to it. The court said the land was not abandoned and therefore could not be placed under the custodian of enemy property.
In 1953 the (by now former) inhabitants of Kafr Bir'im pleaded to the Supreme Court of Israel to allow them to return to their village. Early in September 1953 the Supreme Court decided that the authorities had to answer to why the inhabitants were not allowed to return home. The result was devastating: on 16 September 1953 the Israeli air force and army in a joint operation bombed the village until it was completely destroyed. At the same time it was announced that 1,170 hectares of land belonging to the village had been expropriated by the state. (Ref. given by Sabri Jiryis: "Kouetz 307 (27. Aug. 1953): 1419")
On 16 January 1949, an attempt to move the remaining Palestinian Arab inhabitants of Tarshiha to the neighbouring towns of Mi'ilya and Majd al Kurum was prevented by UN and Christian clerical intercession. Pressure from Kibbutz and the Military in the Galilee panhandle mounted to remove the Palestinian inhabitants of the area. On 5/6 June the inhabitants of Khisas and Qeitiya were forced into trucks and dumped near 'Akbara just south Safad.
Wadi Ara.
In March 1949, as the Iraqi forces withdrew from Palestine and handed over their positions to the smaller Jordanian legion, three Israeli brigades manoeuvred into threatening positions in Operation "Shin-Tav-Shin" in a form of coercive diplomacy. The operation allowed Israel to renegotiate the cease fire line in the Wadi Ara area of the Northern West Bank in a secret agreement reached on 23 March 1949 and incorporated into the General Armistice Agreement. The Green Line was then redrawn in blue ink on the southern map to give the impression that a movement in the Green line had been made. However, this replacement involved a considerable change of the lines, a change which could not be carried out without inflicting serious hardships upon the population and the affected areas. It was inevitable that thousands of people, in the course of this redrawing of demarcation lines, were cut off from the fields that were their livelihood, cut off from their only resources of water and from the meager pastures on which they used to graze their cattle.
During the Lausanne Peace Conference The US consul, William Burdett, reported on a meeting of the Jordan/Israel Armistice Commission which dealt with a case where 1,000 (UN estimates 1,500) Palestinian Arab inhabitants of Baqa al-Gharbiyye had been expelled and forced across the cease fire line. The Mixed Armistice Commission decided, by majority vote, that Israel had violated the General Armistice Agreement by driving the civilians across the demarcation line into the territory of the Hashemite Jordan Kingdom.
In January/February 1949 approximately 700 people from Kfar Yassif were expelled across the Jordanian/Israeli cease fire line as they had moved into Kfar Yassif from the surrounding villages during the period of fighting in 1948.
Majdal.
On 17 August 1950 the remaining Palestinian Arab population of Majdal were served with an expulsion order (The Palestinians had been held in a confined area since 1948) and the first group of them were taken on trucks to the Gaza Strip. Majdal was then renamed Ashkelon by the Israelis in an ongoing process of de-Arabisation of the topography as described by Meron Benvenisti. Egypt accepted the expelled civilian Palestinian Arabs from Majdal on humanitarian grounds as they would otherwise have been exposed to "torture and death". That however did not mean their voluntary movement. Furthermore, testimony of the expelled Arabs and reports of the Mixed Armistice Commission clearly showed that the refugees had been forcibly expelled.
Ilan Pappé reports that the last gun-point expulsion occurred in 1953 where the residents of Umm al-Faraj were driven out and the village destroyed by the IDF. "
Abu Ghosh.
Abu Ghosh expulsion.
Wadi Fukin.
The expulsion at Wadi Fukin led to a change in the Green line where an exchange of fertile land in the Bethlehem area to Israeli control and the village of Wadi Fukin being given to Jordanian control. On 15 July when the Israeli Army expelled the population of Wadi Fukin after the village had been transferred to the Israeli-occupied area under the terms of the Armistice Agreement concluded between Israel and the Jordan Kingdom. The Mixed Armistice Commission decided on 31 August, by a majority vote, that Israel had violated the Armistice Agreement by expelling villagers of Wadi Fukin across the demarcation line and decided that the villagers should be allowed to return to their homes. However, when the villagers returned to Wadi Fukin under the supervision of the United Nations observers on 6 September, they found most of their houses destroyed and were again compelled by the Israeli Army to return to Jordanian controlled territory. The United Nations Chairman of the Mixed Commission, Colonel Garrison B. Coverdale (US), pressed for a solution of this issue to be found in the Mixed Armistice Commission, in an amicable and UN spirit. After some hesitation, an adjustment in the Green Line was accepted and finally an agreement was reached whereby the Armistice line was changed to give back Wadi Fukin to the Jordanian authority who, in turn, agreed to transfer some uninhabited, but fertile territory south of Bethlehem to the Israeli authority.
Northern District.
Israeli forces attacked Jalbun village, with small arms, on the 5 December 1949, they then expelled the inhabitants from their village causing fatal casualties amongst the villagers. The Jordanian government strongly protested against unwarranted Israeli action and call on UN secretary General to notify the security council to take prompt and strict measures to return expelled Palestinians to their village, to hand back their looted belongings, and to compensate the villagers for all losses and damages.
In the lake Huleh area, during 1951, Israel initiated a project to drain the marsh land to bring into cultivation. The project caused a conflict of interests between the Palestinian Arab villages in the area, consequently 800 inhabitants of the villages were forcibly evacuated from the DMZ.
In 1954 Israel "evacuated" the Palestinian villages of Baqqara and Ghannama in the central sector of the Israel/Syria demilitarized zone the Chief of Staff of the UNTSO made a report in January 1955 to the United Nations where it was decided that:-
30 October 1956 When Israel attacked Egypt across the Sinai peninsula in co-ordination with an Anglo-French attack on Suez. The remainder of the Palestinians living in the DMZs were driven into Syria. The villages of Baqqara and Ghannama now lie as rubble and are empty.
Beersheba.
On 7 November 1949, Israeli forces expelled two thousand men, women, children from Beersheba area into the Jordanian controlled sector. Before the Palestinian Arabs were expelled they were severely maltreated, their homes destroyed, their cattle, sheep, belongings looted.
Negeb.
20 August 1950 Israeli authorities expelled into Egyptian territory all the Bedouin living in the demilitarized zone of Auja al-Hafir in Palestine. United Nations observers found that thirteen Arabs, including women and children, had died during the exodus and bodies of several more had been found crushed by armoured vehicles. By 3 September, the number of expelled Arabs had reached 4,071. Most of them had lived in the Beersheba area of Palestine during the period of the British Mandate and was driven from their homes for the first time when the Israeli forces had occupied Beersheba. The Bedouin had gone to settle in Auja al-Hafir and had been living there for more than two years. The Bedouin made representation to return to el-Auja under United Nations protection.
es-Sani are returned to Israel.
From the signing of the General Armistice Agreements in 1949, Jordan and Egypt had complained on many occasions that Israel had been reducing the Arab population of the Negeb by driving Bedouins and even Arab villagers across the cease fire lines into the Egyptian Sinai and the Jordanian held West Bank. Israel had been condemned by the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation (UNTSO) in some instances but had taken no steps to allow the return of the Arabs. On 17 September 1952, the senior Jordan Military Delegate to the Mixed Armistice Commission, Major Itzaq, inform the MAC that the Israelis had expelled ten families of the es-Sani tribe and that they were now situated inside the Jordan border south of Hebron. On 22 September Commander Hutchison USNR of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan/Israel Mixed Armistice Commission (HKJMAC) went into the area and counted over 100 families, nearly 1,000 members of the es-Sani tribe. Sheikh El Hajj Ibrahim informed the MAC that the es-Sani had been forced off their cultivated lands southeast of Beersheba, at El Sharia, to El Laqiya, north-east of Beersheba. On the new area at El Laqiya, for the next three years the es-Sani had made it productive to the extent that Israel then declared a quantity of their grain as surplus crop and demanded that it be sold to the Israeli government at a fixed price. The Military Governor of Beersheba, Lt. Colonel Hermann, informed Sheikh El Hajj Ibrahim that Israel was going to establish a settlement at El Laqiya and that his tribe would have to move to Tel Arad. Sheikh El Hajj Ibrahim had then led the es-Sani over the Jordan/Israel cease fire land rather that move to the inferior land around Tel Arad.
The Sheikh's story of the court action was true. On 28 September 1952, under the heading, * 'Bedouin Tribe Moved/' the Israel press announced that "Tribesmen of the Kiderat El Sana Teljaha tribe were last week moved from their former homes at El Laqiya, east of the Beersheba-Hebron road, to a new site at Tel Arad. ... On 15 September, the High Court in Jerusalem issued an order 'nisi* against the Military Governor and the Ministry of Defence against the enforced move of the tribe."
After negotiations lasting days it was arranged for the es-Sani to return to Israel; although the Israelis wanted the es-Sani transported inside Jordan to a point opposite and closer to Tel Arad which the Jordanians refused to do this and it was finally settled that the transfer would be made at the original point of crossing, on the Hebron-Beersheba road.
Encouraged Exodus.
The Jewish National Fund under Yosef Weitz actively encouraged Palestinian Arab emigration. In the village of Ar'ara 2,500 dunums (625 acres) were purchased. The purchase price was paid in Jordanian currency and the Palestinian Arabs were then transported to the cease fire line with their luggage and from there transported to Tulkarem.
Israeli internal displacement.
In 1953, the villages of Raml Zayta who had been transported from near the city Hadera in April 1949 were again transferred when a Kibbutz moved to Zayta and took over the Israeli Arab village land.

Punjabi literature

Punjabi literature refers to literary works written in the Punjabi language particularly by peoples from the historical Punjab region of India and Pakistan including the Punjabi diaspora. The Punjabi language is written in several different scripts, of which the Shahmukhi, the Gurmukhī scripts are the most commonly used.
Medieval era.
Early Punjabi literature (c. 11th–13th century)
The earliest Punjabi literature is found in the fragments of writings of the 11th Nath yogis Gorakshanath and Charpatnah which is primarily spiritual and mystical in tone. Notwithstanding this early yogic literature, the Punjabi literary tradition is popularly seen to commence with Fariduddin Ganjshakar (1173–1266). whose Sufi poetry was compiled after his death in the "Adi Granth".
Golden era.
The Mughal and Sikh periods (c. 16th century – 1849
The "Janamsakhis", stories on the life and legend of Guru Nanak (1469–1539), are early examples of Punjabi prose literature. Nanak himself composed Punjabi verse incorporating vocabulary from Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, and other Indic languages as characteristic of the Gurbani tradition. Punjabi Sufi poetry developed under Shah Hussain (1538–1599), Sultan Bahu (1628–1691), Shah Sharaf (1640–1724), Ali Haider (1690–1785), Saleh muhammad safoori (son of, Mai Safoora whome Ali Haider had given great tribute) and Bulleh Shah (1680–1757). In contrast to Persian poets, who had preferred the "ghazal" for poetic expression, Punjabi Sufi poets tended to compose in the "Kafi".
Punjabi Sufi poetry also influenced other Punjabi literary traditions particularly the Punjabi Qissa, a genre of romantic tragedy which also derived inspiration from Indic, Persian and Quranic sources. The Qissa of "Heer Ranjha" by Waris Shah (1706–1798) is among the most popular of Punjabi qisse. Other popular stories include "Sohni Mahiwal" by Fazal Shah, "Mirza Sahiba" by Hafiz Barkhudar (1658–1707), "Sassi Punnun" by Hashim Shah (1735?–1843?), and "Qissa Puran Bhagat" by Qadaryar (1802–1892).
Heroic ballads known as "Vaar" enjoy a rich oral tradition in Punjabi. Prominent examples of heroic or epic poetry include Guru Gobind Singh's in "Chandi di Var" (1666–1708). The semi-historical "Nadir Shah Di Vaar" by Najabat describes the invasion of India by Nadir Shah in 1739. The Jangnama, or 'War Chronicle,' was introduced into Punjabi literature during the Mughal period; the Punjabi "Jangnama" of Shah Mohammad (1780–1862) recounts the First Anglo-Sikh War of 1845–46.
Silver era.
Punjabi literature during the British Raj (c. 1860–1947)
The Victorian novel, Elizabethan drama, free verse and Modernism entered Punjabi literature through the introduction of British education during the Raj. The first Punjabi printing press (using Gurmukhi font) was established through a Christian mission at Ludhiana in 1835, and the first Punjabi dictionary was published by Reverend J. Newton in 1854.
The Punjabi novel developed through Nanak Singh (1897–1971) and Vir Singh. Starting off as a pamphleteer and as part of the Singh Sabha Movement, Vir Singh wrote historical romance through such novels as Sundari, Satwant Kaur and Baba Naudh Singh, whereas Nanak Singh helped link the novel to the story telling traditions of Qissa and oral tradition as well as to questions of social reform.
The novels, short stories and poetry of Amrita Pritam (1919–2005) highlighted, among other themes, the experience of women, and the Partition of India. Punjabi poetry during the British Raj moreover began to explore more the experiences of the common man and the poor through the work of Puran Singh (1881–1931). Other poets meanwhile, such as Dhani Ram Chatrik (1876–1957), Diwan Singh (1897–1944) and Ustad Daman (1911–1984), explored and expressed nationalism in their poetry during and after the Indian freedom movement. Chatrik's poetry, steeped in Indian traditions of romance and classical poetry, often celebrated varied moods of nature in his verse as well as feelings of patriotism. Brought up on English and American poetry, Puran Singh was also influenced by Freudian psychology in his oftentimes unabashedly sensuous poetry.
Modernism was also introduced into Punjabi poetry by Prof. Mohan Singh (1905–78) and Shareef Kunjahi. The Punjabi diaspora also began to emerge during the Raj and also produced poetry whose theme was revolt against British rule in "Ghadar di Gunj" ("Echoes of Mutiny").
Platinum era.
Post-Independence literature (since 1947 to 1999)
Western Punjab (Pakistan).
Najm Hossein Syed, Fakhar Zaman and Afzal Ahsan Randhawa are some of the more prominent names in West Punjabi literature produced in Pakistan since 1947. Literary criticism in Punjabi has also emerged through the efforts of West Punjabi scholars and poets, Shafqat Tanvir Mirza (b. 1932), Ahmad Salim, and Najm Hosain Syed (b. 1936).
The work of Zaman and Randhawa often treats the rediscovery of Punjabi identity and language in Pakistan since 1947. Ali's short story collection "Kahani Praga" received the Waris Shah Memorial Award in 2005 from the Pakistan Academy of Letters. Mansha Yaad also received the Waris Shah Award for his collection "Wagda Paani" in 1987, and again in 1998 for his novel "Tawan TawaN Tara", as well as the "Tamgha-e-Imtiaz" ("Pride of Performance") in 2004. The most critically successful writer in recent times has been Mir Tanha Yousafi who has won the Massod Khaddar Posh Trust Award 4 times, and has had his books transliterated into Gurmukhi for Indian Punjabi readers.
Urdu poets of the Punjab have also written Punjabi poetry including Munir Niazi (1928–2006).
Eastern Punjab (India).
Amrita Pritam (1919–2005), Shiv Kumar Batalvi (1936–1973), Surjit Patar (1944–) and Pash (1950–1988) are some of the more prominent poets and writers of East Punjab (India). Pritam's "Sunehe" ("Messages") received the Sahitya Akademi in 1982. In it, Pritam explores the impact of social morality on women. Kumar's epic "Luna" (a dramatic retelling of the legend of Puran Bhagat) won the Sahitya Akademi Award in 1965. Socialist themes of revolution meanwhile influenced writers like Pash whose work demonstrates the influence of Pablo Neruda and Octavio Paz.
Punjabi fiction in modern times has explored themes in modernist and post-modernist literature. Punjabi culture. Moving from the propagation of Sikh thought and ideology to the themes of the Progressive Movement, the short story in Punjabi was taken up by Nanak Singh, Charan Singh Shaheed, Joshua Fazal Deen, and Heera Singh Dard. Women writers such as Ajit kaur and Daleep Kaur Tiwana meanwhile have questioned cultural patriarchy and the subordination of women in their work. Hardev Grewal has introduced a new genere to Punjabi fiction called Punjabi Murder Mystery in 2012 with his Punjabi novel "Eh Khudkushi Nahin Janab! Qatl Hai" (published by Lahore Books).
Modern Punjab drama developed through Ishwar Nanda's Ibsen-influenced "Suhag" in 1913, and Gursharan Singh who helped popularize the genre through live theatre in Punjabi villages. Sant Singh Sekhon, Kartar Singh Duggal, and Balwant Gargi have written plays, with Atamjit has also been awarded the Sahitya Akademi Award in 2010 for his play "Tatti Tawi De Vich".
Diaspora Punjabi literature.
Punjabi diaspora literature has developed through writers in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and the United States, as well as writers in Africa such as Ajaib Kamal, born in 1932 in Kenya, and Mazhar Tirmazi, writer of famous song "Umraan Langhiyan Pabhan Bhaar." Themes explored by diaspora writers include the cross-cultural experience of Punjabi migrants, racial discrimination, exclusion, and assimilation, the experience of women in the diaspora, and spirituality in the modern world. Second generation writers of Punjabi ancestry such as Rupinderpal Singh Dhillon (writes under the name Roop Dhillon) have explored the relationship between British Punjabis and their immigrant parents as well as experiment with surrealism, science-fiction and crime-fiction. Other known writers include Kuljeet kaur ghazal, Sadhu Binning and Ajmer Rode (Canada), Mazhar Tirmazi, Amarjit Chandan, Harjeet Singh Atwal and Surjit Kalsi. The most successful writer has been Shivcharan Jaggi Kussa.
Contemporary era.
Since the turn of the century, diaspora literature has increased, as has feminist literature, as is seen in Surjit Kalsi's work. There has also been an increase in dalit literature, as seen in Desraj Kali's work. Surreal and second generation diaspora writings, as seen in Roop Dhillon's (Rupinderpal Dhillon) work is on the increase, as is the publication of works on the internet, partly due to establishing itself in the new world, partly a reaction to the tight vanity press of India. The only factor that has gone against Punjabi is the drop in interest in reading amongst its target audience, due either to English, Hindi or other media.
Genres.
Currently Punjabi writing can be split between the following genres

List of Tampa Bay Lightning draft picks

The Tampa Bay Lightning are a professional ice hockey team based in Tampa, Florida. They are members of the Southeast Division of the Eastern Conference of the National Hockey League (NHL). The first entry draft they participated in was in 1992 where they selected Roman Hamrlik first overall. Since 1992 they have drafted 190 players from thirteen different nations.
The NHL Entry Draft is held each June, allowing teams to select players who have turned 18 years old by September 15 in the year the draft is held. The draft order is determined by the previous season's order of finish, with non-playoff teams drafting first, followed by the teams that made the playoffs, with the specific order determined by the number of points earned by each team. The NHL holds a weighted lottery for the 14 non-playoff teams, allowing the winner to move up a maximum of four positions in the entry draft. The team with the fewest points has the best chance of winning the lottery, with each successive team given a lower chance of moving up in the draft. Between 1986 and 1994, the NHL also held a Supplemental Draft for players in American colleges.
The Lightning have held the first overall pick three times in franchise history. They have used these picks to select Hamrlik in 1992, Vincent Lecavalier in 1998, and Steven Stamkos in 2008. They also selected first in the 1992 NHL Supplemental Draft where they chose defenseman Cory Cross. When they won the Stanley Cup in 2003–04 only five of the twenty players who dressed for game seven were drafted by Tampa Bay.

New Cross double murder

The New Cross double murder occurred on 29 June 2008, when two French research students, Laurent Bonomo and Gabriel Ferez, were murdered in Sterling Gardens, New Cross, London Borough of Lewisham in South East London, United Kingdom.
The murders.
The victims were bound, gagged, and tortured over several hours, and finally died after being stabbed 196 and 47 times, respectively. The bodies were discovered by firefighters in an apartment, rented by Laurent Bonomo, at Sterling Gardens, New Cross on 29 June 2008. Greenwich mortuary post mortem showed both died from wounds to the head, neck and chest before the fire took hold. A petrol-like accelerant was poured upon their bodies.
Victims.
Both victims were biochemistry students and in their third year of a master's degree at Polytech Clermont-Ferrand university in France, on a three-month DNA research project exchange programme at Imperial College London. Bonomo was from Velaux, Bouches-du-Rhône, southern France; Ferez from Prouzel, Picardy, northern France.
Investigation.
It was established that the victims' bank cards and two Sony PSP handheld game consoles were missing, and it was believed they were taken during the incident. Prior to the events, on 23 June 2008, the same flat in Sterling Gardens, which Bonomo was renting, was burgled and a laptop was stolen.
The Metropolitan Police announced on 5 July 2008, the arrest of a 21-year-old man, who was released on the afternoon of 6 July without further action.
E-fit.
On 6 July 2008, police issued an image of the murders' main suspect, based on the descriptions of witnesses who had seen him running away from Sterling Gardens just after 22:00 BST. He was described as "white, 30 to 40 years of age, of slight or slim build and wearing light coloured baseball cap, a dark top with the word "Junfan" on, blue jeans and white trainers". 
Ferez's parents Françoise and Olivier, of Prouzel, appealed: "Please help us to reveal the truth. Help us to know, to understand and to come to terms with our loss." They also stated: "Rest assured that we will not leave you in peace; and you will not be able to live in hiding forever." DCI Mick Duthie stated: "I also want to reiterate an appeal for anyone who saw or heard anything suspicious throughout that day, last Sunday, June 29. Just to repeat what we know: Laurent spoke to his fiancee around 01:00 BST on the Sunday morning. After that, no-one heard from Laurent or Gabriel or saw them. It is important to stress that the attack could have taken place at any time during Sunday."
Second arrest and charge.
Police held in custody 33-year-old Nigel Edward Farmer who handed himself in to police at Lewisham police station. He was later taken to hospital for treatment of injuries. 
The thin 33-year-old man whose face and hands were badly burned had walked into Lewisham police station, apparently to confess as the killer. But he was told to wait in line at the reception by a civilian worker for 5 minutes. He said: "I've got third degree f***ing burns and they are not doing anything about it." He was released from hospital and has been interviewed in custody by the police. Meanwhile, 600 students, on 7 July demonstrated against their murders in Clermont-Ferrand, France. The group led by Mayor Serge Godart, included teachers, local residents and children that carried a huge banner "Pour Lolo et Gab" ("For Lolo and Gab"), "From all the corners of the world, the second-year biological students think of you and those close to you."
Inquest.
A Greenwich Magistrates' Court's judge, on the afternoon of 8 July, granted London's Metropolitan Police's request for extension of investigation, by issuing a 36 hours "warrant of further detention." Accordingly, Southwark Coroner's Court's Doreen Lawrence adjourned the coroner's inquest for 28 days pending police inquiries.
Court appearance and other arrests.
On 10 July, Nigel Edward Farmer, 33, unemployed and without fixed address, was charged with double murder, arson and attempting to pervert the course of justice when he appeared before Greenwich Magistrates' Court. Bench chairman Phil Rogers ordered his remand in custody until 16 October for his appearance at the Old Bailey. Wearing a white sweatshirt, a tracksuit top with rolled up sleeves and white tracksuit bottoms, and his head shaved, he stood in the dock with 2 security guards. No application for bail was filed.
On 11 July 2008, it was reported by ITN that another man had been arrested in connection with the murders. Armed police arrested 6 feet 3 inches Daniel "Dano" Sonnex, 23, in Peckham, south-east London, after Scotland Yard issued an alert to trace him. Described as "extremely dangerous" he was detained and investigated after his brother, Bernard, 35 and a woman, 25, handed themselves to the police. Sonnex had been previously detained regarding serious, violent incidents. His parents, Kathleen and Bernard, both 55, live in a terraced house in New Cross. Armed officers raided the brothers' council house in Deptford, South East London.
Sonnex, 23, from Peckham, on 12 July 2008, was charged with murder and perverting the course of justice. He appeared at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court on 14 July. Sonnex's brother, Bernard, 35, and a woman, aged 25, had been released on bail, to return on July and August, respectively, pending further investigation. Police were also granted more time to question a man of 23 on the murders. Dano Sonnex appeared before Wimbledon magistrates and was back in custody until October 20 to appear at the Old Bailey. 
The trial of Daniel Sonnex and Nigel Farmer began on 24 April 2009 at the Old Bailey.
The jury began to consider their verdict on 29 May 2009. Moving impact statements were given by the prosecutor.
On 4 June 2009, Sonnex and Farmer were found guilty of murder, Sonnex was sentenced to serve a minimum of 40 years in prison, and Farmer was ordered to stay behind bars for at least 35 years. Sonnex should have been in prison at the time of the murders but had been set free due to an administrative error. David Scott, the chief officer of London Probation, resigned in March 2009 after an investigation began into why Sonnex had not been recalled to prison. While the UK Justice Secretary Jack Straw has apologised to the families over the blunders which left Sonnex free to commit the crime, the families announced their intentions to commence legal proceedings against the authorities.

USS Sultana (SP-134)

USS "Sultana" (SP-134) was a yacht acquired under a free lease by the U.S. Navy during World War I. She was outfitted as a patrol craft and was assigned to escort duty in the North Atlantic Ocean. She served honorably—rescuing survivors adrift in the water and protecting cargo ships from submarine attack—and was returned to her owner at the close of the war.
Built in Erie Basin, New York.
"Sultana" (SP-134) was built in 1889 by Henderson and Robbins at Erie Basin, New York. It was commissioned for Trenor Luther Park and his wife Julia Hunt Catlin, of New York City. They spent their honeymoon on it and crossed the Atlantic "about 75 times" as quoted from her memoires. "We cruised from the Windward Isles to South America. One time we cruised for a yar and a half from the North Cape to the Suez, stopping wherever and for as long as we pleased." Trenor L. Park was a Harvard graduate, silk merchant and prominent yachtsman. After his death in 1907, it was sold to Mrs. E. H. Harriman of New York City, widow of the late railroad baron E. H. Harriman. On 4 May 1917, Mrs. Harriman loaned the steam yacht to the United States Navy under a free lease; the yacht was commissioned on 27 May 1917, Lt. E. G. Allen in command.
World War I service.
Assigned to the North Atlantic Ocean.
"Sultana" was fitted out at the New York Navy Yard, and she joined a special patrol force at Tompkinsville, New York, on 6 June. The force sailed for France on 9 June. On 4 July, she rescued 45 survivors of the American merchantman, "Orleans", which has been torpedoed the day before; and she landed them at Brest, France, that evening. 
From 4 July 1917 to 5 December 1918, "Sultana" was attached to the United States Patrol Squadron based at Brest and performed escort and patrol duty. On 5 December, after the war had ended, she headed for home via the Azores and Bermuda, and arrived at New York City on 28 December 1918.
Post-war decommissioning and disposal.
"Sultana" was stripped of her military hardware, decommissioned, and returned to Mrs. Harriman on 17 February 1919 and struck from the Navy list.

<doc id="18292454" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18292454" title="Culture of Lithuania">
Culture of Lithuania

The culture of Lithuania combines an indigenous heritage, represented by the unique Lithuanian language, with Nordic cultural aspects and Christian traditions resulting from historical ties with Poland. Although linguistic resemblances represent strong cultural ties with Latvia in various historical moments Lithuania was influenced by Nordic, Germanic and Slavic cultures. Various cultural changes occurred throughout Lithuania's transformation from a former country of the Soviet Union to an independent Baltic state.
Ethnicity and nationality.
Lithuania has the most homogeneous population in the Baltic states. In the 2001 census, 83.45% of the population identified themselves as ethnic Lithuanians, 6.74% as Poles, 6.31% as Russians, 1.23% as Belarusians, and 2.27% as members of other ethnic groups. Poles in Lithuania are concentrated in the Vilnius Region, allowing Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania, their ethnically-based party, to exert some influence. Russians, however, are relatively evenly spread throughout Lithuania. Lithuanians are usually divided into 5 groups: Samogitians, Sudovians, Aukštaitians, Dzūkians and Lietuvininks, although the Lietuviniks are nearly extinct. City dwellers, however, are most often called simply Lithuanians.
Lithuania's ethnic composition has undergone significant changes throughout history. The most significant one of these was the extermination of Jews during the Holocaust. Before World War II, approximately 7.5% of Lithuanians were Jewish, referred to as Litvaks. The population of Vilnius was 30% Jewish. Almost all of Lithuania's Jews either were killed by Nazi Germany or emigrated, and the 2001 census only counted 4007 Jews.
Language.
Lithuanian is the official language of Lithuania. Lithuanian, an Indo-European language, closely resembles ancient Sanskrit, and is written using the Latin alphabet. It is considered by scholars that the Lithuanian language retained, with the fewest changes, most of the elements of Proto-Indo-European language. Various dialects of Lithuanian exist, such as High Lithuanian (Aukštaitian) and Low Lithuanian (Samogitian).
During the Lithuanian press ban (1864–1904), Lithuanian was censored by the Russians, and could only be written with the Cyrillic alphabet. Literature in the Lithuanian alphabet was burned and forbidden from publication. Schools, churches, courts, and newspapers faced heavy penalties if Latin text were to be displayed during these years, with violators even exiled to Siberia.
Religion.
Since the Christianization of parts of Lithuania proper in 1387 and of Samogitia in 1413, the majority of Lithuanians have been members of the Roman Catholic Church. According to the 2001 census, 79% of Lithuanians are Roman Catholic. Approximately 4.9% of the population are Eastern Orthodox, mainly the Russian minority. Under Article 26 of the Constitution of Lithuania, persons can freely practice a religion of their choosing.
Catholicism played a significant role in Lithuanian anti-communist resistance under the Soviet Union. Several Catholic priests were leaders of the anti-communist movements, and thousands of Latin rite crosses were placed on the Hill of Crosses near Šiauliai, despite its being bulldozed in 1961.
Education.
Education in Lithuania exists from pre-school to adult education. Colleges and universities in Lithuania have undergraduate and higher education. Pre-school is for children aged three to six years. After pre-school, children enroll in primary school from seven to ten years of age. At eleven, students begin secondary school until the age of 18. Once the general education is completed, students go to college or university. Students can take the UK exam to study overseas. A bachelor's degree takes four years, traditionally, to complete. A master's takes one to two years to complete; and a doctoral degree takes four years. Lithuania's oldest university is Vilnius University, which was founded in 1579.
Food and lifestyle.
Lithuanian cuisine features the products suited to its cool and moist northern climate: barley, potatoes, rye, beets, greens, berries, and mushrooms are locally grown, and dairy products are one of its specialities. Since it shares its climate and agricultural practices with Eastern Europe, Lithuanian cuisine has much in common with other Eastern European and Ashkenazi cuisines. Nevertheless, it has its own distinguishing features, which were formed by a variety of influences during the country's long and difficult history. German traditions also influenced Lithuanian cuisine, introducing pork and potato dishes, such as potato pudding ("kugelis" or kugel) and potato sausages ("vėdarai"), as well as the baroque tree cake known as "šakotis". The most exotic of all the influences is Eastern (Crimean Karaites) cuisine, and the dishes "kibinai" and "čeburekai" are popular in Lithuania. Torte Napoleon was introduced during Napoleon's passage through Lithuania in the 19th century.
Media and art.
Art and museums.
Lithuania's art community is famous for Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis (1875–1911). Čiurlionis was a nationally renowned musician and artist in Lithuania. His symphonic compositions, Jūra ("The sea") and Miške ("In the forest"), were the first full length pieces from a Lithuanian musician. Jūra ("The sea") and Miške ("In the forest") were composed to represent Lithuania's landscape. After Čiurlionis's death, the 2420 Čiurlionis asteroid honors his achievements after being discovered in 1975.
A large number of museums exist in Lithuania. The Lithuanian Art Museum was founded in 1933 and is the largest museum of art preservation and display in Lithuania. The Palanga Amber Museum is a subsidiary of the Lithuanian Art Museum. Various amber pieces comprise a major part of the museum. In total, 28,000 pieces of amber are displayed, and about 15,000 contain inclusions of insects, spiders, or plants. Some 4,500 amber pieces in the museum are used for artwork and jewelry. A future museum, Vilnius Guggenheim Hermitage Museum, will present exhibitions of new media art, parts of the New York City anthology film archive, and Fluxus art. The museum is scheduled to open in 2011.
The Lithuanian Museum of Ancient Beekeeping displays various forms of bee hives. The Grūtas Park contains Soviet-era relics and statues including those of Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin.
Music.
Lithuania has a long history of folk, popular and classical musical development. Lithuanian folk music is based primarily around polyphonic music played on flutes, zithers (kanklės) and other instruments.
Folk.
Lithuanian folk music is based around songs ("dainos"), which include romantic, wedding songs, as well as work songs and more archaic war songs. Traditional vocal music is held in high esteem on a world scale: Lithuanian song fests and sutartinės multipart songs are on the UNESCO's representative list of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. Folk songs were performed either in groups or alone, and in parallel chords or unison. Duophonic songs are common in the renowned sutartinės tradition of Aukštaitija. Another style of Lithuanian folk music is called rateliai, a kind of round dance. Instrumentation includes kanklės, a kind of zither that accompanies sutartines, rateliai, waltzes, quadrilles and polkas, and fiddles, (including a bass fiddle called the "basetle"), a kind of whistle called the "lumzdelis" and, similar in sound to clarinet, "birbyne" ; recent importations, beginning in the late 19th century, including the concertina, accordion and bandoneon. Sutartinė is accompanied by the "skudučiai", a form of panpipes played by a group of people, as well as wooden trumpets ("ragai" and "dandytės"). The kanklės is an extremely important folk instrument, which differs in the number of strings and performance techniques across the country. Other traditional instruments include the "švilpas" (whistle), drums and "tabalas" (a percussion instrument like a gong), "sekminių ragelis" (bagpipe) and the "pūslinė" (a musical bow made from a pig's bladder filled with dried peas).
Rock.
In the 1980s, rock bands Foje, Antis, and Bix made a big impact in Lithuania. In 1987, 1988 and 1989 Lithuania saw several big rock festivals, such as Roko Maršas. Roko Maršas was connected to the ideology of Sąjūdis.
From 2000s on, the most popular band in Lithuania used to be SKAMP. Happyendless and Jurga became internationally popular and put Lithuania spot on the map for quality music.
Cinema and theatre.
Lithuania has a lively drama scene. Many film festivals exist, such as Kino Pavasaris and the AXX Commercial Film Festival Contest. Film tradition has emerged throughout Lithuania's occupation by the Soviet Union. A popular Lithuanian film classic is "Velnio Nuotaka", which is based upon folk tales.
A major theater in Lithuania is the Lithuanian National Drama Theater. Another theatre, the Vilnius Little Theatre, was founded by Rimas Tuminas. Vilnius Little Theatre produces Shakespeare plays and other productions. Actors are being taught in the Lithuanian Academy of Music and Theatre, which was founded in 1919 by Juozas Naujalis as the Kaunas Music School. The academy was renamed in 2004.
Several directors are important to Lithuania's theatre scene. Eimuntas Nekrošius is a major part of Lithuania's theatre movement and has a theatre company, Meno Fortas. He has produced Shakesperian plays, such as "Macbeth", "Othello", and "Hamlet". Oskaras Koršunovas is another acclaimed contemporary director, producing musicals, studio performances, and plays, including "Hamlet" and "Midsummer Night's Dream".
Television.
The first channel in the Lithuanian language was introduced in 1957. Lithuania has 8 main channels, 24 regional channels and 2 non-Lithuanian channels, with Lithuanian language translation. The national channel is Lithuanian National Radio and Television ("Lietuvos televizija"; Television of Lithuania).
Sports.
There are eighty Olympic and non-Olympic sports federations in Lithuania. Among the most popular sports in Lithuania are basketball, football, athletics and cycling. Professional sportsmen and trainers are educated in the Lithuanian Academy of Physical Education.
On October 1, 1932, the Department of Physical Education and Sports was founded. The department supports Lithuanian athletics and promotes physical education. Lithuania's National Olympic Committee supports Lithuania's Olympic athletes and is led by Arturas Poviliunas.
Discus throw Olympic athlete Virgilijus Alekna is a two-time gold winner and medalist. Alekna was named UNESCO Champion for Sport in 2007.
Lithuania's national basketball team, football team and rugby union team compete internationally. The country has produced several world-class basketball players, such as Arvydas Sabonis, Žydrūnas Ilgauskas and Linas Kleiza.
Literature and journalism.
Lithuania's literature is based upon folklore tradition. Song books began publishing in the sixteenth century. The first Lithuanian book was "Katekizmas" ("Simple Words of Catechism") by Martynas Mažvydas in 1547. A archival site of Lithuanian literature and folklore is the Institute of Lithuanian Literature and Folklore in Vilnius. The Institute was built in 1904 and consists of two buildings.
Newspapers and magazines are popular in Lithuania. Lithuania's biggest selling newspaper is "Lietuvos Rytas". Whereas, "Respublika" and "Vakaro Zinios" are tabloid magazines. English language magazine publications are translated into Lithuanian for local consumers.
Architecture and housing.
Several famous Lithuania-related architects are notable for their achievements in the field of architecture. Johann Christoph Glaubitz, Marcin Knackfus, Laurynas Gucevičius and Karol Podczaszyński were instrumental in introducing Baroque and neoclassical architectural movements to the Lithuanian architecture during the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries.
Lithuania is also known for numerous castles. About twenty castles exist in Lithuania. Some castles had to be rebuilt or survive partially. Lithuanian village life has existed since the days of Vytautas the Great. Zervynos and Kapiniškės are two of many ethnographic villages in Lithuania.
Forty percent of Lithuania's population live in Vilnius, Kaunas, Klaipėda, Alytus, Panevėžys, and Šiauliai. Even though population density has grown within Lithuania, overall, population has declined due to low birth rates and higher death rates. Between 1996 and 2001, the World Bank financed the Lithuania Energy Efficiency Housing Project to renovate thermal temperatures in some of Lithuania's houses, due to Lithuania's cold climate.
Holidays.
The official holidays are found in Article 162 of the "Labour Code of the Republic of Lithuania." The holidays are as follows:

Hush money

Hush money is a slang term for a form of bribery, in which one person or party offers another an attractive sum of money or other enticement, in exchange for remaining silent about some illegal, stigmatic, or shameful behavior, action, or other fact about the person or party who has made the offer.
The person or party who presents the hush money may be attempting to avoid criminal prosecution, a lawsuit (as sometimes in the case of an out-of-court settlement), a leak of information to the news media, or silence about a stigmatic issue within one's own community. The information being covered up may include illegal activity, such as drug dealing, or some personal secret, such as an extramarital affair. In some cases, a government agency may be involved in the offer of hush money in order to protect the agency's employees, politicians and their appointees, or a national government in its standing among other nations in the world. It is usually given under the table.

Corruption in Armenia

Political corruption in Armenia is a widespread and growing problem in Armenian society. 
Extent.
The United Nations Development Programme in Armenia views corruption in Armenia as "a serious challenge to its development." The selective and non-transparent application of tax, customs and regulatory rules, as well as weak enforcement of court decisions fuels opportunities for corruption. The Armenian procurement system is characterised by instances of unfair tender processes and preferential treatment. Relationship between high-ranking government officials and the emerging private business sector encourage influence peddling. The government has reportedly failed to fund implementation of the anti-corruption strategy and devoted no money and little commitment for anti-corruption efforts.
In 2012, Transparency International raised its Corruption Perceptions Index for Armenia from 2.6 in 2011 to 3.4 out of 10 (a higher score means less perceived corruption); Armenia went up from 129th place in 2011, to 105th out of 176 countries surveyed (on a par with Algeria, Bolivia, Gambia, Kosovo, Mali, Mexico, and Philippines). Despite legislative revisions in relation to elections and party financing, corruption either persists or has re-emerged in new forms.
Anti-corruption institutions.
The main anti-corruption institutions of the Armenian government are an Anti-Corruption Council – headed by the prime minister – and the Anti-Corruption Strategy Monitoring Commission, established in June 2004 to strengthen the implementation of anticorruption policy. However, these institutions scarcely functioned in 2006-2007, even though they were supposed to meet twice-quarterly and monthly, respectively.
History.
The late Prime Minister Andranik Margarian launched Armenia’s first post-Soviet campaign against corruption in 2003. The initiative, however, has been widely disparaged for being short on results. Current Prime Minister Tigran Sargsyan has acknowledged that corruption is Armenia’s "number one problem that obstructs all our reforms."
The government has recently launched an anti-graft campaign which has been accompanied by changes in customs regulations, reported tax police inspections of companies owned by pro-government businesspeople and numerous high-profile firings of people in the tax department, customs service and police. The recent crackdown on corruption has received mixed reactions.
Areas.
Tax and customs agencies.
In 2007, World Bank economists pointed to serious problems with rule of law and widespread corruption in the Armenian tax and customs agencies.
Misappropriation of international loans.
In March 2004, an ad hoc commission of the Armenian parliament investigating the use of a $30 million World Bank loan concluded that mismanagement and corruption among government officials and private firms was the reason of the failure of the program to upgrade Yerevan's battered water infrastructure. The World Bank issued the loan in 1999 in order to improve Yerevan residents' access to drinking water. The government promised to ensure around-the-clock water supplies to the vast majority of households by 2004, but as of 2008, most city residents continue to have running water for only several hours a day.
Veolia Environnement, the French utility giant that took over Yerevan's loss-making water and sewerage network in 2006, has said that it will need a decade to end water rationing. In August 2007, Bruce Tasker, a Yerevan-based British engineer who had participated in the parliamentary inquiry as an expert, publicly implicated not only Armenian officials and businessmen but also World Bank representatives in Yerevan in the alleged misuse of the loan. In an October 4, 2007 news conference, the World Bank Yerevan office head Aristomene Varoudakis denied the allegations, claiming that the World Bank disclosed fully all information available on the project to the parliamentary commission and that based on this information there was no evidence of fraud or mismanagement in the project.
Illegitimate use of eminent domain.
Eminent domain laws have been used to forcefully remove residents, business owners, and land owners from their property. The projects that finally are built on the site are not of state interest, but rather are privately owned by the same authorities who have executed the eminent domain clause. A prominent example is the development of Yerevan's central Northern Avenue area. Another involves an ongoing project (as of November 2008) to construct a trade center near Yerevan's botanical garden. The new land owners are non other than Yerevan's mayor Yervand Zakharyan and Deputy Mayor Karen Davtyan, who was at one time Director of the Armenian Development Agency and successfully executed the eviction of residents on Northern Avenue.

Elayne Rapping

Elayne Antler Rapping is a nationally known critic and analyst of popular culture and social issues. She is the author of several books covering topics such as media theory, popular culture, women's issues, and the portrayal of our legal system on television. As a regular contributor to such publications as "The Nation", "The Progressive", and "The New York Times", she has written on a wide variety of cultural issues including film and movie reviews.
Early life and education.
Born in Chicago, Elayne Rapping began her education at the University of California, Los Angeles, then earned her masters and doctoral degrees in English at the University of Pittsburgh. In 1967, she received the Andrew Mellon Fellowship.
Career and Major Works.
As an educator, Rapping was a Professor of English and Director of Women's Studies at Robert Morris College from 1970 to 1990, Professor of Communications at Adelphi University from 1991 to 1998, and Professor of American Studies at State University of New York Buffalo until 2009.
Rapping is the author of several books which address a range of topics from popular culture, television and society, gender issues, to media theory. Her first book, The Looking Glass for Nonfiction TV, published in 1987, is an examination of how newscasts, sports programs, game shows, made-for-TV movies, MTV, commercials and other nondramatic forms of TV programming are derived from and influenced by our cultural values, economic forces and the evolving technology of video broadcasting.
A collection of her essays and articles, Media-tions: Forays into the Culture and Gender Wars, was published in 1994. In these varied articles, Rapping takes up such pop culture artifacts as soap operas, Madonna and Amy Fisher to set forth a new paradigm of feminism's interface with the media.
In 1996, Rapping published The Culture of Recovery, a book based on her personal investigations into the self-help groups for women. Her 2003 book, Law and Justice As Seen On TV, examines the significance and political impact of law-related television programming beginning with courtroom dramas in the 1940s up to the crime shows of the present. In his review of Law and Justice, Political Science Professor Austin Sarat stated that Rappings's work "shows how valuable the analysis of popular culture can be in illuminating some of the most important legal and social issues of our time."
As a journalist, Rapping has written extensively for a number of national publications including "The Nation", "The Village Voice", "Cineaste", "Jump Cut", and "The Progressive" where she was a regular columnist for many years.

<doc id="18292570" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18292570" title="Little Fork Church">
Little Fork Church

Little Fork Church stands on a low knoll to the east of State Route 229 nine miles north of Culpeper, Virginia in a small grove of trees that enhances its naturally pastoral setting. The name Little Fork is taken from the junction of the Hazel and Rappahannock Rivers relatively close to the edifice. It is a large room church being 83 ½ feet east-west and 33 ½ feet north-south. Unlike most rectangular churches in Virginia, the pulpit stands directly north of the southern entrance door that is placed in the middle of the southern wall rather than in the far southeast of the building. Thus it shows some of the architectural characteristics of middle colony meeting houses such as those in Delaware as well as the Virginia Vernacular Church and the deep church.
Parish affiliation.
It is attached to St. Mark’s Parish that, like most early parishes in Virginia, changed its suzerainty and geographic range as counties became established by partitioning earlier counties due to population growth or shifts. Its creation and history are:
Little Fork was a chapel of ease for the parish, and thus was never the lower, or main, parish church. It is the only remaining colonial church in the county.
General architecture.
It is a church of late construction, begun in 1773 and completed in 1776, having characteristics of a rectangular church combined with the contemporary, two story churches of Northern Virginia that stretch in a geographic swath from Falls Church to St. Paul's, King George County. It retains elements such as orientation, south and west doorways, compass windows, and Flemish bond, yet includes elements such as a deep church configuration, a hipped roof, movement of southern door to the center of the southern wall, classical door pediments, and a pulpit on the northern wall opposite the southern doorway. It lacks elements of deep churches in Northern Virginia such as two tiered windows and cruciform structure. The general doorway plan and placement of the pulpit is remarkably similar to that of Lamb’s Creek Church, designed by the same architect, and resembles several extant middle colony meeting houses.
Unlike most colonial churches, the designer and builder, John Ariss (circa 1725-1799) is known and designed another similar religious edifice, Lamb's Creek Church, that is a virtual twin of this building. It replaces a wooden church built on or near the same site that burned to the ground in 1773. An older wooden church reportedly burned in 1750. Instead of another wooden church, apparently planned by Edmund Bass who was paid five pounds for his work, this brick edifice was erected. However, according to the parish website and its well-researched brochure, William Phillips built the church for a fee of 35,000 pounds of tobacco and John Voss designed it.
It derives its name from the junction of the Hazel and Rappahannock Rivers that are nearby. The name recorded on some plats like the USGS topographical maps of Oak Shade Church has no validity.
Bricks.
The bricks are laid in Flemish bond both in the water table and the walls and show occasional use of glazed brick in both headers and stretchers. The walls are 22" thick. Queen closers and rubbed brick are present at the corners, compass windows, and doorways. The transition from the water table to the walls is via an ovolo, or convex, molded brick. It is a large, deep church as already stated, approaching the limit of audibility in its 83 foot length. The modillion cornice, large toothed decorated eaves, are probably of colonial origin.
Interior.
The interior, destroyed during the Civil War by Union Cavalry for firewood, was restored in 1871 and 1976. The last restoration is a painstakingly accurate restoration of the original interior. It consists of box pews painted colonial blue-green with dark wood tops, the original reredos on the eastern wall, and a reader's lectern under the "wine-glass" pulpit high on the north-central wall, directly opposite the southern doorway. In 1963, Rawlings reports a plaster line indicating that the original wainscoting was taller than that installed in the nineteenth century restoration. This is apparently corrected in the recent repairs. The elaborate reredos contains a central tablet bearing the Lord's Prayer, the Decalogue, and the Apostles' Creed in modern gold lettering on a black background. The cornice and cross are modern additions rather than colonial features. It is mentioned in the church website that the box pews were constructed to keep out winter drafts, and that parishioners used foot warmers during winters. The flat wooden ceiling is a restoration as are most of the floorboards; Rawlings believes the floor was originally lower than the present level.
Windows and doorways.
The 8’ 8” tall windows are of typical compass style with round arches of voussiors, rubbed brick, and queen closers. There are fourteen compass windows in all. These windows, located on the south, east, and north are identical, while the two windows on the west wall are small rectangular openings with flat arches, characteristic of openings for galleries in other churches. There is no evidence for a western gallery in this church (as in its sister church, Lamb's Creek, that lacks the western windows entirely). The doorways are most likely not the original form: the church probably had classical pediments like Pohick Church or Lamb's Creek Church as evidenced by brick repairs surrounding the doors. The original door openings were approximately 6' 7" wide, and the southern entrance was probably the main one. The doorways themselves are also not of colonial age.
Historical events.
Historically, the building was used as a drill field for the Little Fork Rangers, Co. D, 4th Virginia Cavalry in 1861 and, as already mentioned, a stable for Union cavalry in 1863 when the interior was destroyed. A "contrite Union officer" reputedly sent $100 to the church after the war to replace the destroyed pews. A marble monument to the Little Fork Rangers stands south east of the church and an apparently modern sun dial is placed on a brick base in front of the southern approach. There are no colonial graves near the present church, although there seems to be the start of a memorial garden cemetery to the east of the building among a copse of small trees. Small cedar trees sporadically surround the church that is embellished by lawn encircling it.

Cedarmere-Clayton Estates

The Cedarmere-Clayton Estates are located in Roslyn Harbor, New York, United States, listed jointly on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Cedarmere, the smaller of the two, is William Cullen Bryant's estate, located on the west side of Bryant Avenue overlooking Hempstead Harbor, now a historic house museum open to the public. Clayton, the bulk of the property, is the large landscaped Bryce/Frick estate, now home to the Nassau County Museum of Art. The two combined properties, with input from several notable architects, illustrate the development of estates on the North Shore of Long Island over a period of nearly a century.
Bryant originally owned almost the entire property. Fifteen years after his death, in 1893, Lloyd Bryce bought the largely undeveloped inland portion of the estate and hired Ogden Codman, Jr. to design a mansion for it. In 1919, the dying Henry Clay Frick purchased the estate for his son Childs, who, after renovating it and expanding it, lived there with his family until his 1965 death. Four years later, it was turned over to the county for use as a museum.
Estates.
All of Cedarmere and most of Clayton were part of Bryant's original purchase. After his descendants sold all but the area around Cedarmere to the Bryces, they and the Fricks made some other additions as well. 
Cedarmere.
Cedarmere is located behind a high stone wall on a 7 acre (4 ha) parcel along Bryant, with two small ponds and a landscape designed by Frederick Law Olmsted. Its main house is a three-bay, -story main block with two wings: a two-story multi-bay structure to the east and a smaller, single-story section to the north. All are covered in slate gambrel roofs, fenestrated with trimmed gabled dormers. Window shapes vary throughout the facades. The house is faced with stucco, except for the visible stone foundation. A green glass-and-metal conservatory protrudes from the front, and a porch wraps around all but the north side. 
A single-bay entrance pavilion projects onto the south porch, overlooking the larger pond and its stone bridge. It is topped with a railed balcony. The doorway is heavily ornamented with classical molded surround, pilasters, sidelights, entablature and leaded transom. The south elevation also has solid and latticework supports with decorated balusters and brackets.
At the other edge of the main house's pond is a small Gothic Revival building known as the mill, although it was never used as such and remains purely decorative, used mainly for storage. Its brick basement gives way to a board-and-batten first floor, with heavy surface decoration, and then to a slate-covered cross-gabled roof with decorated bargeboards and filials, topped by a brick chimney. The windows have been trimmed with arches of various shapes and other decorative touches.
Other outbuildings include a small greenhouse south of the garden and two more modern garages to the north, some distance from the house. The latter two are the only improvements to the property not considered contributing.
Clayton.
Clayton's property begins across Bryant from Cedarmere, but its main entrance is located on Northern Blvd. (NY 25A). The drive up, after passing a hipped-roofed brick Neoclassical gatehouse to what is now the museum takes visitors through some of the pastorally landscaped 165 acres (66 ha) that make up the center of Roslyn Harbor. The main house sits on a high plateau, surrounded by plantings and a modern parking lot. It is a Georgian Revival building, brick with stone trim and copper hipped roof, pierced by-gabled dormers, its eaves lined with modillions above a stone entablature.
The main block is two and a half stories high and nine bays wide. On both end there are symmetrical, two-bay pavilions outlined in quoins. The front facade has a five-bay open porch with Ionic columns and a flat roof, entablature and balustrade. The main entrance is a double door with semi-circular transom. On the east facade a series of round-arched French doors give access to the garden, topped by a balustraded balcony. Two one-story arcades wings project from it. The mansion's interior features much original woodwork and plaster.
Near the main house is a garden designed by Marian Coffin, with symmetrical plantings surrounding a central fountain. The remnants of a private zoo, primarily an old animal enclosure and tower. A narrow road leads to the Jerusha Dewey Cottage, originally built by Bryant for a friend of his and later used as a guest house, after extensive renovation by the Fricks. It is therefore a mixture of brick foundation, board-and-batten siding, slate roof and a mix of fenestration styles.
As at Cedarmere, two more modern buildings have been erected to support the property's current use as an art museum and sculpture garden. They are the only ones of the 11 buildings and structures at Clayton not considered contributing.
History.
The property that became Cedarmere had been in use since the early days of local settlement in the 17th century. The earliest known house on it was built in 1787 by Richard Kirk, a Quaker farmer. Bryant bought a small house first built by Joseph Moulton in 1843 with the intent of establishing a retreat for himself from his job in the city as editor of the "New York Evening Post", where he could contemplate nature and write his poetry. He expanded both the land and the house through the 1850s and 1860s into the present structure, following the then-popular principles of Andrew Jackson Downing and disciples like Calvert Vaux, who supposedly designed the mill house, calling for small Gothic Revival cottages, sometimes in a Picturesque mode, that maintained harmony with their rural surroundings. At Cedarmere, as he later named the property, he received not only Vaux and his sometime collaborator Frederick Law Olmstead, but other cultural notables of the era such as painter Thomas Cole, James Fenimore Cooper and actor Edwin Booth.
He sold it to his daughter Julia in 1875, as long as he was allowed to live the remainder of his life there; and he did, dying three years later. She in turn sold it to her nephew, Harold Godwin, in 1891. Eight years later, he sold the undeveloped property that became Clayton to Lloyd Bryce, a former congressman and heir to industrial fortunes.
The upper stories of Cedarmere were damaged considerably by a 1903 fire. On the other property, Bryce hired Codman, a young architect responsible for many seaside homes in the Northeast, to design the main house, and began creating gardens in the property's northwest corner. The Fricks hired Charles Allom to modify the house for their use when they moved in 1919, renaming it Clayton, but Codman's design remains largely unchanged. Allom's main changes were the replacement of the original entrance loggia with the porch and, inside, creating a large entrance hall in keeping with the Fricks' intention to emulate an English country house, a popular aspiration of wealthy Americans during the 1920s. To that end, Guy Lowell designed the gatehouse, and Marian Cruger Coffin designed the main garden a decade later.
Four years after Frick's death, in 1969, the family sold the estate to Nassau County for use as an art museum. In 1989 the county transferred control to a private foundation. The Godwin family continued living in Cedarmere until they, too, donated it to the county for use as a museum in 1975.
Cedarmere and Clayton today.
Both houses and their grounds are open to the public. The grounds at Cedarmere are free and open year round; the house is open on weekends and by appointment. Visitors to Clayton must pay an entrance fee as well as parking; the museum is open every day except Mondays and holidays year-round.

Yotsugana

[[File:Yotsugana.png|thumb|right|350px|Different regions distinguish different sets of sounds. Using the Nihon-shiki romanization system:
じ, ぢ, ず, づ (Nihon-shiki: zi, di, zu, du) used in the Japanese writing system. They historically represented four distinct voiced morae (syllables) in the Japanese language; however, today, in standard Japanese and the dialects of most Japanese speakers these morae have merged down to two sounds. Most far northern dialects (Tōhoku dialects and Hokkaidō) and far southern dialects (notably Okinawan Japanese) and the Ryukyuan languages (the other Japonic languages) have also mostly merged these down to one sound. However a few dialects, namely around Shikoku and Kyushu in the southwest, have conserved the distinction between three or all four sounds. In the current Tokyo dialect, on which the standard Japanese language is based, only two sounds are distinguished as represented in the Hepburn (ji, ji, zu, zu) and Kunrei (zi, zi, zu, zu) romanization systems; likewise in the widely spoken Kansai dialect.
Modern kana usage.
The spelling differences between the four kana were retained well up to the mid-twentieth century, long after the different sounds they represented had merged leaving only two distinct morae in most mainland dialects such as that of Tokyo. Shortly after the end of World War II, the discrepancy between kana usage and pronunciation was rectified as part of a general orthographic reform known as the Gendai Kanazukai, or modern kana orthography. Under the new orthographic rules, only the two kana じ "zi" and ず "zu" are to be used, though two notable exceptions exist:
An exception to this spelling unification was permitted for regions that pronounced the four kana as three or four distinct sounds. After a 1986 update to the Gendai Kanazukai, this exception was replaced with a statement that the unified spelling was to be primarily used, while still permitting etymologically correct spellings.

Ludwig and Christina Welk Homestead

The Ludwig and Christina Welk Homestead built in 1893 is an historic farm house located at 845 88th Street, South East in Strasburg, North Dakota. It is also known as the Lawrence Welk Birthplace, the Mike Welk Farm and ND SITS 32 EM 46. Here on March 11, 1903, noted American musician, accordionist, bandleader, and television impresario Lawrence Welk was born to Ludwig and Christina Welk, who were German-speaking Roman Catholics from Alsace-Lorraine by way of Odessa, Ukraine (then part of the Russian Empire). On October 28, 1993, the homestead was added to the National Register of Historic Places. 
The Lawrence Welk Birthplace, officially called the Ludwig and Christina Welk Farmstead, has been restored and is run by local volunteers including Lawrence Welk's niece Edna Schwab. Although Welk donated to other local efforts, surprisingly he specified that none of his money be used for the restoration of his birthplace.

Injeolmi

Injeolmi ( is a variety of "tteok", or Korean rice cake, made by steaming and pounding glutinous rice flour, which is shaped into small pieces and usually covered with steamed powdered dried beans or other ingredients.
It is a representative type of glutinous pounded "tteok", and has varieties depending on the type of "gomul" (고물, coating) used. "Gomul" can be made with powdered dried soybeans, azuki beans, or sesame seeds, or sliced dried jujube. Subsidiary ingredients are mixed into the steamed rice while pounding it on the "anban" (안반, wooden pounding board). "Patinjeolmi" (팥인절미), and "kkaeinjeolmi" (깨인절미) are examples for the former, coated with azuki bean powder and sesame respectively. In "ssuk injeolmi" (쑥인절미) and "surichwi injeolmi" (수리취인절미) are "artemisia" and "Synurus deltoides" (AIT.) NAKAI) added.
"Injeolmi" is not only a popular snack but also is considered a high quality "tteok", used for "janchi" (잔치, party, feast, or banquet) in Korea. It is easily digested and nutritious. "Injeolmi" can be stored in a refrigerator and taken out when needed. If the "tteok" is heated slightly in the microwave, it may taste almost as good as the newly made one.

Milecastle 0

Milecastle 0 is a possible milecastle of the Roman Hadrian's Wall which may have preexisted the fort of Segedunum. Although its existence has been suggested by historian Peter Hill, no evidence of this milecastle has been found. It is not known whether the decision to establish forts on the line of the wall predated the decision to extend the wall to Wallsend, so it is possible that this milecastle was never built.
Construction.
Nothing is known of the construction of Milecastle 0.
Excavations and investigations.
No excavations or investigations have taken place specifically for Milecastle 0. No evidence has been found during excavation of Segedunum.
Associated Turrets.
Each milecastle on Hadrian's Wall had two associated turret structures. These turrets were positioned approximately one-third and two-thirds of a Roman mile to the west of the Milecastle, and would probably have been manned by part of the milecastle's garrison. The turrets associated with Milecastle 0 are known as Turret 0A and Turret 0B.
Turret 0A.
Nothing is known of this Turret.<br>
Presumed site: 
Turret 0B.
Turret 0B (St Francis) is located east of St Francis Community Centre. It was first noted by John Horsley in 1732 who mistook it for Milecastle 1, and it is sometimes referred to as "Horseley's Milecastle 1".<br> Eric Birley (still understanding it to be Milecastle 1) considered that it was rediscovered by Canon Fowler in 1877, and the structure was also recorded (and identified as a Turret) by John Collingwood-Bruce and Robert Blair
, when it was discovered during the digging for foundations of 'The Grange'. The Turret was confirmed as such by Grace Simpson with reference to an article in The Evening Chronicle on 15 August 1936, which described an extension of Stotts Road, Walker which cut through 'the Roman Wall and one of its turrets near the Grange'. The turret's stones were later removed to Carville Chapel grounds to form rock gardens.
A single course of this Turret was unearthed in 1978.<br>

<doc id="18292697" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18292697" title="Roman Catholic Diocese of Skopje">
Roman Catholic Diocese of Skopje

The Roman Catholic Diocese of Skopje (Lat:"Dioecesis Scopiensis"), is a diocese of the Latin Rite of the Roman Catholic church in Macedonia. From the 4th century to 1656, when it was renamed to Archdiocese of Skopje, it was known as the Archdiocese of Dardania. In 1969 along with the diocese of Prizren, it formed the Diocese of Skopje-Prizren. In 2000 it became a suffragan diocese of the Archdiocese of Vrhbosna, and the bishop is Kiro Stojanov, appointed in 2005.
History.
Originally erected in the 4th century as the ancient Archdiocese of Dardania, the archdiocese was a bulwark of the Roman Empire, as it was on the primary north/south route from Athens to Sirmium. With the great troubles in the Empire, the Archdiocese remained in the Empire long after the fall of Rome. After suffering from a massive earthquake in 518, the metropolitan cathedral was rebuilt along with most of Skopje, by the Emperor Justinian. 
In the 7th century, as the Roman power declined in the Eastern Empire, the Slavs invaded and destroyed the city. No bishops are known from 553 to 882. After being rebuilt, Skopje switched hands several times in the power struggle between the Romans and the Bulgars, before the eventual collapse of the Bulgar empire. Until 1014, the Archdiocese was in the hands of the Slavs, when the Byzantines finally crushed Tsar Samoil, and reincorporated them within the empire.
There were Catholic bishops in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, but Skopje remained Byzantine until the arrival of the Turks in 1389, when the see was conquered and suppressed after the defeat of the Serbs in the battle of Kosovo. It would be three centuries before it would be revived again: it was a titular see from 1346 to 1656. In 1656, after the defeat of the Turks in the battle of Vienna, the city was raided and taken by the Austrians, and the archdiocese was finally restored and renamed the Archdiocese of Skopje (Scopia). This marked a brief interlude, as the Turks pressed them back and the see was suppressed once again under the Turks. The archbishops had to reside in the Albanian mountains. 
The modern history of the diocese begins after the Greek rebellion in 1816, with the appointment of Matej Krasniqi (Matthaes Crasnich) as the first resident archbishop of Skopje in over 500 years of Turkish occupation. Since then, there has been an unbroken string of bishops, who resided in Uskup from 1860. In 1924, after the devastation of the first world war, the archdiocese was downgraded to a diocese, and became a suffragan to the archdiocese of Vrhbosna. In 1969, the diocese was merged with the diocese of Prizren, and became the Diocese of Skopje-Prizren. In 2000, they were split once again, as the portion that was formerly the diocese of Prizren became the apostolic administration of Prizren, and the Diocese of Skopje returned to its former name.

Syracuse Orange men's lacrosse

The Syracuse Orange men's lacrosse team represents Syracuse University in NCAA Division I men's college lacrosse. The Orange have won 15 national championship titles, and currently compete as a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference men's lacrosse conference. Syracuse plays its home games at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse, New York.
History.
Syracuse played its first intercollegiate lacrosse game in 1916, and captured its first United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) championship in 1920. It would go on to win USILA championships in 1922, 1924, and 1925 and a coaches' poll national championship in 1957 .
NCAA national championships.
In the modern NCAA era, Syracuse has won 11 national championship titles, in 1983, 1988, 1989, 1993, 1995, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2008, and 2009, with one additional championship in 1990 vacated due to NCAA rules infractions after an investigation revealed that Nancy Simmons, the wife of Coach Roy Simmons, Jr., had co-signed a car loan for the team's star player, Paul Gait, in the 1990 season.
The Orange's eleven NCAA championship titles are the most since the NCAA began holding tournaments in 1971 NCAA Division I. Johns Hopkins University's thirty-four overall national championships, including nine during the NCAA era, is still the pace-setter.
Big East lacrosse.
Syracuse was one of seven Big East Conference schools that formally began competing in men's lacrosse in 2010. Previously, Syracuse men's lacrosse had remained independent ("i.e.", unaffiliated with any athletic conference). The other six Big East schools were Georgetown, Notre Dame, Providence, Rutgers, St. John's, and Villanova.
Head coaches.
Syracuse has had four men's lacrosse head coaches since 1916:
As of 2010, those coaches combined for a 806-309-15 record, which is a .723 winning percentage, with 14 total national titles.
Individual honors and awards.
USILA All-Americans.
Twelve Syracuse Orange men's lacrosse players have been four-time United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association All-Americans:
Tewaaraton Trophy.
Syracuse has also produced two Tewaaraton Trophy winners:
US Lacrosse Hall of Fame.
Twenty-three Orange men's lacrosse players and coaches are enshrined in the United States Lacrosse Hall of Fame:
Only Johns Hopkins (63) and Maryland (31) have more inductees in the Hall of Fame.
Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame.
At least one former Syracuse Orange men's lacrosse player has been inducted in the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame:
National Lacrosse League Hall of Fame.
Several former Syracuse Orange men's lacrosse players have been inducted into the National Lacrosse League Hall of Fame:
Traditions.
One notable tradition of the Syracuse program is the number 22 jersey, which is given to the player who is expected to be the team's best overall player. The number has been worn by Gary Gait, Charlie Lockwood, Casey Powell, Ryan Powell, Mike Powell, Dan Hardy, Cody Jamieson, and most recently Jojo Marasco. Syracuse recently announced that the number 22 jersey will next be worn by freshman Jordan Evans.

Robert Benham (politician)

Captain Robert Benham (November 17, 1750 – February 6, 1809), was a frontier pioneer, served in local government and was a member of the first elected legislature for the State in Ohio, 1799 & 1800.
Family.
Benham was born in Monmouth County, New Jersey - the son of Peter Benham (1724-1780) and Ann James (d. 1758). He is descended from Winifred King, his Great Great Grandmother, who along with her daughter (also Winifred), was brought up on charges of witchcraft in 1697 in Wallingford, Connecticut. In 1692, Winifred's mother also appeared at a preliminary trial infamously known as the Salem Witch Trials. The charges, in all three cases, were fortunately dismissed. Benham and his wife, Elizabeth, had ten children who were born in Ohio and Kentucky.
Career.
His service in connection with the military made him well-known to Colonel David Rogers, General Harmar, General Arthur St. Clair and Mad Anthony Wayne.
After leaving the military, he continued to be addressed as Captain. People who knew him included Simon Kenton, William Henry Harrison, James O'Hara, Judge Jacob Burnet and William McMillen. His constant companion once he moved to Ohio was his nephew Benjamin Van Cleve who established the first library in Dayton, Ohio, was Dayton's first postmaster and a member of the Board of Trustees for Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. He died in Warren County, Ohio.
His Life.
His adventures were written about by many, including Henry Howe, President Teddy Roosevelt and the Boy Scouts of America. His son, Joseph Benham, continued to serve in the tradition of his father.
Theodore Roosevelt wrote in "The Winning of the West, Volume Two – From the Alleghanies to the Mississippi, 1777-1783"; Page 54; “A still more remarkable event had occurred a couple summers previously (October 4, 1779). Some keel boats, manned by a hundred men under (Colonel) Lieutenant(David) Rogers, and carrying arms and provisions procured from the Spaniards at New Orleans (from Governor Galvez and American Agent Oliver Pollock ), were set upon by an Indian war party under (Simon) Girty and Elliot while drawn upon a sand beach of the Ohio (later known as Manhattan Beach, Dayton, Kentucky.) The boats were captured and plundered, most of the men were killed; several escaped, two under very extraordinary circumstances. One had both his arms, the other both legs, broken. For weeks the two crippled beings lived in the lonely spot where the battle had been fought, unable to leave it, each supplementing what the other could do. The man who could walk (Basil Brown) kicked wood to him who could not (Captain Benham), that he might make a fire, making long circuits, chase the game toward him to shoot it. At last they were taken off a passing flat boat (and returned to the fort opposite the Falls of the Ohio. Among those captured by the war party and carried away was Colonel John Campbell who had joined the Americans only a few days before.)

Biliary dyskinesia

Biliary dyskinesia refers to altered tonus of the sphincter of Oddi (usually increased pressure), disturbance in the coordination of contraction of the biliary ducts, and/or reduction in the speed of emptying of the biliary tree.
The gallbladder stores the bile which is released by the liver. The bile reaches the small intestine where it digests the fat from aliments. In order to reach the small intestine, the bile must pass through the common bile duct and when the bile can not be secreted by the gallbladder or can not flow through the common bile duct, then it will return to the gallbladder, leading to biliary dyskinesia.
Biliary dyskinesia is often a disease symptom rather than a disease itself. It might signal the existence of gallbladder stones, acute or chronic pancreatitis, chronic inflammation, or other digestive disorders. However, symptoms can be induced by the consumption of certain types of food.
Failure of the biliary sphincter can be distinguished from failure of the pancreatic sphincter.
Treatment.
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has been used to treat the condition.
Symptoms may persist after cholecystectomy, and have been linked to the use of proton pump inhibitors.

The Southside Family Project has an office at St Michael's Road and offers extensive services in the areas of counselling and advice.
In December some Whiteway households decorate the exterior of their homes with Christmas lights. Other residents of Bath visit Whiteway to view the display. 
A PACT (Partners and Communities Together) meeting is held four times a year in the Southdown Ward. This enables residents of Whiteway and Southdown to discuss local issues with Councillors, the police and representatives from other agencies. The time and venue for the PACT meetings are available from a section of the Avon and Somerset Constabulary website. A website called Proud of Twerton, Whiteway and Southdown provides information pertinent to Whiteway, including regular news, articles, and information about local community groups.
In August 2010 a resident-led group called Changes organised its first community event in Rosewarn Field, Whiteway. Then in November 2010 the group created a website giving details of its projects and philosophy of community action.

Hydnora africana

Hydnora africana is an achlorophyllous plant native to southern Africa that is parasitic on the roots of members of the Euphorbiaceae family. The plant grows underground, except for a fleshy flower that emerges above ground and emits an odor of feces to attract its natural pollinators, dung beetles, and carrion beetles. The flowers act as temporary traps, retaining the beetles that enter long enough for them to pick up pollen.
