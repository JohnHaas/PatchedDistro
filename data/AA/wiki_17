Children of Joseph Smith

__FORCETOC__
The children of Joseph Smith, Jr., the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, and his wife Emma Smith, are historically significant because of their roles in establishing and leading the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS, now called Community of Christ). The RLDS believed that leadership of the church would flow through Smith's descendants, and in 1860, Joseph Smith III became its prophet and president. The larger LDS Church was led after a vote following Joseph's death by Brigham Young. 
Joseph Smith, Jr. publicly condemned polygamy, but there is ample evidence that Smith both taught and practiced it, had a number of wives sealed to him, and may have had sexual relations with at least some of them. Though there were allegations of paternity in some of these polygamous marriages, no children have ever been proven to be Smith's. There is ongoing genetic research to determine if any descendants of alleged children have Smith's genetic markers, and so far all tests have been negative.

Rue Lepic

Rue Lepic is an ancient road in the commune of Montmartre, in the 18th arrondissement of Paris, climbing the hill of Montmartre from the boulevard de Clichy to the place Jean-Baptiste-Clément
It is an ancient road resulting of rectification and re-arrangement of several dirt-roads leading to the Blanche barrier (Place Blanche), starting life as "Chemin-neuf" (Le "chemin-vieux" was rue de Ravignan). In 1852 it was renamed rue de l'"Empereur", and renamed again in 1864, after the General Louis Lepic (1765-1827).
In history.
Painter and engraver Eugène Delâtre lived and worked on rue Lepic. He successively occupied addresses n°92, n°87, n°97, and also n°102.
Louis Renault built his first car in 1898, calling his car the "Voiturette". On December 24, 1898, he won a bet with his friends that his invention was capable of driving up the slope of Rue Lepic. As well as winning the bet, Renault received 12 definite orders for the vehicle.
On 7 September 1960, Fernand and Jackie Sardou opened their cabaret "Chez Fernand Sardou" on the road in place of "cabaret Belzébuth" next to the residence of Utrillo. The cabaret became a preferred meeting place and played to a full house every night. Michel Sardou had his professional début there, firstly as a server.
In the Claude Autant-Lara film, "La Traversée de Paris" (1956), "Martin" (played by André Bourvil) et "Grandgil" (played by Jean Gabin) were pictured in this road during the German occupation of France transporting a jointed pig destined for the black market.
Yves Montand dedicated to this road the song "Rue Lepic" in the album ""Yves Montand"" (1974).

USS Surprise (PG-63)

USS "Surprise" (PG-63), the fourth American naval ship of the name, was the British Flower-class corvette HMS "Heliotrope" loaned to and operated by the United States Navy from 1942-1945 as a "Temptress"-class patrol gunboat. After World War II she was sold as a merchant vessel and ended her life in the Chinese navy as Lin I.
Service history.
HMS "Heliotrope" was built by John Crown and Sons Ltd, Sunderland, England, and launched on 5 June 1940. She was transferred to the U.S. Navy at Hull, England, on 24 March 1942, one of a group of corvettes transferred to the U.S. Navy under reverse Lend-Lease. She was commissioned as USS "Surprise" the same day, Lieutenant R. C. D. Hunt, Jr., in command. She was delivered with British radars and armament installed, and over the course of her U.S. Navy service was gradually converted to U.S. standards. The gun was mounted forward, the gun aft.
"Surprise" sailed from Derry, Northern Ireland on 24 April 1942 to escort a convoy to Boston, Massachusetts. After an overhaul, she proceeded south and for the remainder of 1942 escorted convoys in the Caribbean, principally between Trinidad and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In January 1943, she extended her range into the South Atlantic and, into 1944, performed escort runs between Trinidad and Recife, Brazil.
"Surprise" then returned to the United States. In May 1944, she returned to the North Atlantic and, until after the end of World War II in Europe in May 1945, rotated between Newfoundland, Greenland, and Iceland convoy runs and weather patrol duty.

<doc id="18295929" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18295929" title="United States lightship LV-117">
United States lightship LV-117

LV-117 was a lightvessel of the United States Lighthouse Service. Launched in 1931, she operated as the Nantucket lightship south of Nantucket Shoals. Moored south of Nantucket Island, Massachusetts, the lightship was at the western part of the transatlantic shipping lane and the first lightship encountered by westbound liners approaching New York Harbor. On May 15, 1934, one of these liners, RMS "Olympic", rammed and sank "LV-117", killing seven of her crew.
Description.
"LV-117" was a steel-hulled vessel with steel deckhouses fore and aft, a funnel amidships for engine exhaust, and two masts. An electric lantern topped each mast, and an electric foghorn was on the mainmast. Four diesel engines drove generators, providing power for both the signalling apparatus and a electric propulsion motor. Her sister vessels were "San Francisco" LV-100, "Swiftsure" LV-113, "New Bedford" LV-114, "Frying Pan" LV-115, and "Chesapeake" LV-116.
She was stationed south of the Nantucket Shoals in a location south by east from Sankaty Head Lighthouse on Nantucket Island. The vessel was described at the time as "the newest thing in lightships, a great advance over the sailing vessels that stood watch ... for over seventy years." She was moored in by diameter steel chain cables attached to a pair of anchors.
Service.
On February 8, 1931, "LV-117" took aboard the eight-man crew of the fishing schooner "Aloma", which sank from the lightship. The men were taken ashore by the Coast Guard on February 9.
During a storm on June 27, 1933, the lightship broke her mooring chain and drifted away from her position. She was unable to regain it for several days. Not until the gales subsided on June 30, was her crew able to return "LV-117" to her station.
On January 6, 1934, four months before "LV-117" was sunk by the "Olympic", the lightship had a less serious glancing collision by another liner, SS "Washington", at the time the largest ocean liner yet built in the United States. The radio antenna yards were carried away and minor damage occurred to some hull plates. The near-sinking caused great concern to the lightship's crew; in April 1934, radio operator John Parry told friends, "Some day we are just going to get it head on, and that will be the finish. One of those big liners will just ride through us."
Sinking.
During the night of May 14, 1934 "Olympic", sister-ship to the lost "Titanic", was homing in on the lightship's radio beacon. Nearly 75 times larger than the 630-ton lightship, the White Star liner was steaming at about in the center of the western terminus of the trans-Atlantic shipping lanes. By 5.00 am on the morning of May 15, "Olympic" was in thick fog that necessitated the reduction of its speed to 16 knots, then .
The lightship's radio signal and fog signals were picked up by "Olympic" at about 10.55 am and appeared to be off the ship's starboard bow. Captain John Binks ordered "Olympic"s course to be changed ten degrees to port and her speed to be reduced to ten knots. Her radio operator attempted unsuccessfully to make contact with "LV-117" to determine her exact position, but the fog signals could still be heard, apparently at a longer distance off the starboard bow. It appeared that "Olympic" was well clear of the lightship, but a few minutes later the lookout spotted "LV-117" dead ahead. Binks ordered the ship's rudder to be set full to port, the engines to be set full speed astern, and the watertight doors to be closed throughout the vessel. "Olympic" slowed to only about but it was too late and she collided with the side of the lightship at 11.06 am. Although she was not moving fast, her sheer weight (52,000 tons when fully fuelled), and thus her kinetic energy, completely wrecked the smaller vessel.
"Olympic"s passengers barely noticed the collision, which First Class passenger Sir Arthur Steel-Maitland registered only as a "slight jar". The changed settings of the engines were much more noticeable, sending vibrations throughout the ship as they were put into reverse and brought up to maximum revolutions. Passengers came onto the deck to find out what was going on and were met by the smell of oil and the sight of debris in the sea around "Olympic".
For those aboard "LV-117", the collision was felt much more directly. "We saw the "Olympic" loom out of the fog a short distance away," stated C.E. Mosher, "LV-117"s first mate, in a newspaper interview two months after the accident. "The visibility was only . A crash was inevitable. I sounded the collision alarm. We all donned life preservers. Then we waited." When the collision came, said Mosher, "it was more like a hard push and a terrific shaking, a crunching and grinding. It was not a loud smash as one might expect. The "Olympic" kept coming through ..." John Perry told the press, "At the time of the smash I was in the radio cabin. I barely had time to get on deck and swim for my life." Robert Laurent commented that as "it all happened so quickly, you had no chance to panic. We all had our life preservers and it was a good thing that we did."
"Olympic" responded extremely rapidly to the accident. The portside emergency lifeboat had already been swung outboard and was lowered just before "Olympic" came to a halt. The starboard emergency boat was launched a few minutes later, along with one of "Olympic"s motor boats. The scene was described by "The New York Times":
The three boats managed to rescue seven of the lightship's eleven crewmen and brought them aboard, but three of the seven died in "Olympic"s hospital. Captain Braithwaite, First Mate C.E. Mosher, Radio Operator John Perry and Oiler Laurent Robert all survived the disaster. Engineer William Perry, Oiler Justin Richmond, Cook Alfred Montero, First Cook I. Pinna, Seaman E.B. George, Seaman John Fortes and Seaman John Rodriques all died. The lightship had sunk so quickly that anyone below decks had little chance of surviving.
Binks ordered "Olympic" to resume course for New York at 12.29 pm once it had become clear that there were no more survivors. The liner had suffered only minimal damage in the collision, comprising some dented hull plates which were repaired in a dry dock in Southampton in May–June 1934. She was allowed to leave New York at the scheduled time on May 17 after a brief inspection. The dependents of those killed in the accident were given restitution through the United States Employees's Compensation Act.
Later history.
"LV-117" was replaced by the "LV-112". The Cunard–White Star Line paid for the construction of "LV-112" as reparation for the accident.
The lightship now rests about deep, lying on her port side in an area with unpredictable currents up to . The wreck of the vessel is remarkably intact; "LV-117"s aft mast lies alongside the hull of the ship, while the forward mast has been broken off, lying perpendicular to the wreck. It was discovered in the 1970s by Captain Paul Forsberg of the Viking Fleet fishing concern, though it was not clear at the time that the wreck was that of "LV-117". Its identification was not confirmed until as late as July 1998 when an expedition led by diver Eric Takakjian made the first of what would be many visits to the wreck site. It is reported to be a difficult and dangerous dive, as the wreck is entangled in many fishing nets. Nonetheless Takakjian describes it as "fascinating" and "a really exciting and rewarding experience" to visit. He was surprised to find how well-preserved it was, as it had been rumoured at the time that the lightship had been cut in half by "Olympic".

Abramovka, Moscow Oblast

Abramovka () is a rural locality (a village) in Orekhovo-Zuyevsky District of Moscow Oblast, Russia.
Municipally, the village is a part of Ilyinskoye Rural Settlement (the administrative center of which is the village of Ilyinsky Pogost). Population: 583 (1997). Postal code: 142650.
History.
Abramovka was founded in the 18th century from the villages of Channikovo () and Andreyevo ().
The village is located in the historical area of Ramenye (a part of Guslitsa). In the 19th century, it was a state-owned village of Bezzubovskaya Volost of Bogoroditsky Uyezd of Moscow Governorate. The overwhelming majority of the population of Abramovka were Old Believers, who from the end of the 19th century were guided by the Russian Orthodox Old-Rite Church.
In the early 1830s, peasant Anton Muravlyov began building a weaving factory in Abramovka. The factory produced its first fabric in 1843. By 1856, the factory employed 118 weavers operating 90 looms. Soon after, another weaving mill was opened by peasant Pyotr Stulov. At first, his factory employed only twelve weavers operating eleven looms. Two more weaving mills followed soon after; both built by Bogoroditsk merchants Yevstigney and Ivan Morkovkin. One of their mills employed 87 weavers operating 70 looms, another—99 weavers operating 85 looms.
In 1890, Anton Muravlyov opened the dye works employing ninety workers. At the same time, two more dye works were opened—one by Minador Muravlyov (employing fifteen people) and another by Gabriel Biryukov (six people).
Neither of these factories are operational now.
Copying of Old Believers manuscripts, books, and producing so-called book-paintings were the crafts developed in Abramovka. In the 1860s–1870s, an underground Old Believers press was operated in Abramovka by peasant Yevsey Piskunov.
Population.
In 1852, the village consisted of 122 homesteads comprising 905 inhabitants (437 male and 468 female). By 1862, the population decreased slightly, with 149 homesteads comprising 874 people (435 male and 439 female). As of January 1, 1997, the population was 583.

Olympics on television

The Olympic Games have been broadcast on television since the 1930s.
1930s.
1936 Summer Games.
The 1936 games, held in Berlin, Germany, were televised by means of closed circuit television to various viewing halls located across the city.
1940s.
1948 Summer Games.
The BBC provided coverage of the games on their television service, live from Wembley Stadium. Coverage was limited to the London area.
1950s.
1956 Summer Games.
Television service was introduced to Australia in time for the 1956 Games in Melbourne. International broadcasting institutions present were BBC, CBS, NBC, Eurovision and United Press. The first time broadcasting rights were sold.
1956 Winter Games.
RAI introduced the first Winter Games coverage ever. The broadcasts were relayed live via Eurovision to Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Switzerland.
1960s.
1960 Winter Games.
CBS paid $50,000 for the right to broadcast the games in the United States, and this marked the first time the Olympic Games were televised there. Also, officials, unsure if a skier had missed a gate in the men's slalom, asked CBS if they could review a videotape of the race. This would be the impetus and inspiration for CBS to develop what would come to be known as "instant replay."
1964 Summer Games.
The games were telecast to the United States using Syncom 3, the first geostationary communication satellite. It was the first television program to cross the Pacific Ocean.
1968 Winter Games.
The first Olympic Games to be broadcast in colour. Frenchman Jean-Claude Killy won three gold medals in all the alpine skiing events. In women's figure skating, Peggy Fleming won the only United States gold medal. The games have been credited with making the Winter Olympics more popular in the United States, not least of which because of ABC's extensive coverage of Fleming and Killy, who became overnight sensations among teenage girls.
ITV covered the Summer Olympic Games 1968, 1972, 1976 and 1980. An industrial dispute prevented coverage of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics but the Games returned to ITV screens in 1988, sharing the coverage with Channel 4 - Channel 4 showing the overnight and breakfast coverage with ITV covering the daytime action as well as broadcasting early evening highlights programmes. The 1988 Olympics were the last time that the Games have been shown on ITV with subsequent Olympic Games being shown only on the BBC. ITV has never broadcast the Winter Olympics.
1970s.
1972 Summer Games.
In the controversial gold medal basketball game, the United States' Olympic basketball winning streak, which started in 1936, was ended by the Soviet team's victory in the gold medal game, which USA Basketball calls "the most controversial game in international basketball history". Doug Collins made two free throws with three seconds left to give the USA a 50-49 lead, despite the horn going off in the middle of his second attempt. The Soviets failed to score on the ensuing possession, but the clock was stopped at 0:01 after one official heard the earlier horn and the Soviets were frantically urging time-out. The clock had to be reset to three seconds but it was showing 0:50 when play began again. Again, the Soviets failed to score, time apparently expired, and the United States began celebrating, with ABC displaying the 50-49 margin as "final".
Munich massacre.
Initial news reports, published all over the world, indicated that all the hostages were alive, and that all the terrorists had been killed. Only later did a representative for the International Olympic Committee (IOC) suggest that "initial reports were overly optimistic." Jim McKay, who was covering the Olympics that year for ABC, had taken on the job of reporting the events as Roone Arledge fed them into his earpiece. At 3:24 A.M. (German Time), McKay received the official confirmation:
1980s.
1980 Winter Games.
Miracle on Ice.
The rest of the United States (except those who watched the game live on Canadian television) would have to wait to see the game, as ABC decided to broadcast the late-afternoon game on tape delay in prime time. As in several previous games, the U.S. team fell behind early. Vladimir Krutov deflected a slap shot by Aleksei Kasatonov past U.S. netminder Jim Craig to give the Soviets a 1–0 lead, and after Buzz Schneider scored for the United States to tie the game, the Soviets rallied again with a Sergei Makarov goal.
Down 2–1, Craig improved his play, turning away many Soviet shots before the U.S. team had another shot on goal (the Soviet team had 39 shots on goal in the game, the Americans only 16). In the waning seconds of the first period, Dave Christian fired a slap shot on Tretiak. The Soviet goalie saved the shot but misplayed the rebound, and Mark Johnson scooped it past the goaltender to tie the score with one second left in the period. The Soviet team played the final second of the period with just three players on the ice, as the rest of the team had retired to their dressing room for the first intermission.
Tikhonov replaced Tretiak with backup goaltender Vladimir Myshkin to start the second period, a move which shocked many players on both teams. Fetisov later identified this as the "turning point of the game." Myshkin allowed no goals in the second period. Aleksandr Maltsev scored on a power play to make the score 3–2 for the Soviets, but Craig made numerous saves to keep the U.S. in the game.
Johnson scored again for the U.S., 8:39 into the final period, firing a loose puck past Myshkin to tie the score just as a power play was ending. Only a couple shifts later, Mark Pavelich passed to U.S. captain Mike Eruzione, who was left undefended in the high slot. Eruzione fired a shot past Myshkin, who was screened by his own defenseman. This goal gave the U.S. a 4–3 lead with exactly 10 minutes to play in the contest.
Craig withstood another series of Soviet shots to finish the match, though the Soviets did not remove their goalkeeper for an extra attacker. As the U.S. team tried to clear the zone (move the puck over the blue line, which they did with seven seconds remaining), the crowd began to count down the seconds left. Sportscaster Al Michaels, who was calling the game on ABC along with former Montreal Canadiens goalie Ken Dryden, picked up on the countdown in his broadcast, and delivered his famous call:
Though the game was on live television in the Soviet Union, it was played at 1:00 AM Moscow time. This afforded CPSU officials some ability to squelch news and discussion; Pravda did not carry a game report or mention the match in its post-Olympic wrap-up, and the hockey players were quickly and quietly herded away from the arrival reception for Olympic athletes at Moscow's airport.
1980 Summer Games.
Major broadcasters of the games were "USSR State TV and Radio" (1,370 accreditation cards), Eurovision (31 countries, 818 cards) and Intervision (11 countries, 342 cards). Asahi TV with 68 cards provided coverage for Japan, while OTI representing the Spanish-speaking world received 59 cards, TVNZ (New Zealand) was aired live and the Channel Seven provided coverage for Australia (48 cards). NBC, which had intended to be another major broadcaster, canceled its coverage in response to the U.S. boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics, and became a minor broadcaster with 56 accreditation cards, although the network did air highlights and recaps of the games on a regular basis. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation almost canceled their plans for coverage after Canada took part in the boycott and was represented by 9 cards.
In the Philippines, many countries and cards there see watch our coverage of boycott broadcast channel in GTV-4 (now in PTV-4)
The television centre used 20 TV channels. Montreal had used 16, Munich 12, Mexico City 7.
1984 Summer Games.
The price for ABC's 180 hours of television is $225 million. All Los Angeles radio and television stations covered the Olympics extensively throughout the event. The Summer broadcast rights almost tripled from 1980 to 1984 ($87 million to $225 million) and both Winter and Summer rights have gone for $300 million or more since 1988.
1988 Winter Games.
The American host network, ABC, paid a then record $398 million, while the main host broadcaster, the Canadian CTV television network, paying domestic rights for $45 million. A further $90 million was raised by sponsorships and licenses.
1990s.
1992 Summer Games.
The exploding costs of the Games sent networks looking for alternative strategies to ease the financial burden. In 1992, NBC made an attempt at utilizing pay-per-view subscriptions with the "Olympic Triplecast", which was organized in conjunction with Cablevision and intended to sell packages of commercial-free, extensive programming.
NBC, which had the broadcast rights to the games, partnered with Cablevision for the experiment, believing that people would pay between $95 to $170 to see events live that would normally be shown on tape delay on the network in prime time. By the time the games began, relatively few people had ordered the package, which featured Red, White and Blue channels on a special three-button remote control offered by some cable operators for free as a lure to sign up for the service.
The plan was a failure, mainly due to viewers' reluctance to pay to see some events when network coverage of others was free of charge. NBC and Cablevision would lose millions of dollars, with one estimate putting their losses at $100 million.
1994 Winter Games.
When the construction of the Lysgårdsbakkene jumping hills started in 1992, the hills had to be moved some meters north so that the American broadcaster CBS could get the best pictures available from their pre-chosen location.
1998 Winter Games.
The games were covered by the following broadcasters:
2000s.
2000 Summer Games.
Most of the footage used by international broadcasters of the Opening and Closing Ceremony was directed out of SOBO (Sydney Olympic Broadcasting Organisation) by Australian director Peter Faiman. In Sydney in 2000, there were over 16,000 broadcasters and journalists, and an estimated 3.8 billion viewers watched the games on television.
The games were covered by the following broadcasters:
Running up to the games an Australian comedy satire, "The Games", was broadcast in Australia (it was also broadcast, at a later date, in New Zealand). It featured a spoof of the issues and events that the top-level organisers and bureaucrats suffered in the lead up to the games.
A poignant part of the media coverage happened in the Canadian broadcast. On 28 September, the CBC was airing the Olympics, when the network's chief correspondent, Peter Mansbridge, broke in and said:
NBC presented over 400+ hours on their main and sister stations, CNBC and MSNBC. The downside of the American coverage was that it was presented on tape delay rather than live due to the 15-hour time difference. The lone exception was the gold medal game in Men's Basketball, which featured the U.S. defeating France 85-75. The game was televised live in primetime on Saturday, 30 September (EDT), which was the afternoon of Sunday, 1 October in Australia.
2002 Winter Games.
An estimated 2.1 billion viewers from 160 countries watched over 13 billion viewing hours during the 2002 Winter Olympics. The average worldwide viewer watched 6 hr 15 min of coverage, while the viewers in the game's host county of the United States watched an average of 29 hours each. The Salt Lake Organizing Committee (SLOC) used the organization International Sports Broadcasting (ISB), who had over 400 cameras, to provide a live video feed of competitions and ceremonies. The various official broadcasting companies in the 160 different countries could then tap into the feed and air the programs live or on a taped delay in their respective markets.
2004 Summer Games.
NBC Universal paid the IOC $793 million for U.S. broadcast rights, the most paid by any country. NBC made it possible for the network to broadcast over 1200 hours of coverage during the games, triple what was broadcast in the U.S. four years earlier. Between all the NBC Universal networks (NBC, CNBC, MSNBC, Bravo, USA Network & Telemundo) the games were on television 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
In their 2004 coverage, NBC and its sister networks presented live coverage throughout the morning and afternoon, while showing marquee events pre-taped in prime time.
For the first time, major broadcasters were allowed to serve video coverage of the Olympics over the Internet, provided that they restricted this service geographically, to protect broadcasting contracts in other areas. For instance, the BBC made their complete live coverage available to UK high-speed Internet customers for free; customers in the U.S. were only able to receive delayed excerpts.
NBC launched its own Olympic website, NBCOlympics.com. Focusing on the television coverage of the games, it did provide video clips, medal standings, live results. Its main purpose, however, was to provide a schedule of what sports were on the many stations of NBC Universal. The games were on TV 24 hours a day on one network or another.
2006 Winter Olympics.
The 2006 Olympic Winter Games were broadcast worldwide by a number of television broadcasters:
Ratings and attendance.
A number of events reported low spectator attendance despite having acceptable ticket sales. Preliminary competition and locally less popular sports failed to attract capacity crowd as expected. Organizers explained this was because blocks of seats were reserved or purchased by sponsors and partners who later did not show up at the events.
Several news organizations reported that many Americans are not as interested in the Olympics as in years past. It has been suggested that reasons for this disinterest include the tape delayed coverage, which showed events in prime-time as much as 18 hours later in the West, and also due to the lack of success achieved by big-name American athletes.
In Canada, CBC's coverage has also posted disappointing numbers, which were reduced as the Canadian men's hockey team was eliminated early in the competition. Primetime ratings reached only as high as #7 in the weekly ratings. However, ratings for live, afternoon coverage have attracted 300,000 more viewers than the taped, primetime coverage. Overall, only primetime coverage has suffered, dropping 45% from the 2002 Games, with the entire coverage being 52% ahead from 2002. Meanwhile on TSN, the numbers for its live curling coverage (which aired as early as 3:00am EST) were between 300,000 and 500,000 viewers.
The Olympics' main threat in the USA was the 2006 season of "American Idol". One night of interest was 23 February in which the first results show of the season went head to head with that night's coverage which included the Women's Free Skate in Figure Skating.
2008 Summer Games.
These games were the first to be produced and broadcast entirely in high definition television. In their bid for the Olympic games in 2001, Beijing confirmed to the olympic evaluation commission "that there would be no restrictions on media reporting and movement of journalists up to and including the Olympic Games."
In Canada the public network CBC/Radio-Canada and cable networks TSN and RDS broadcast its final games before a private consortium involving CTV/Rogers/TQS takes over for the 2010 Winter Olympics, which will be happening within Canadian borders, in Vancouver.
In Australia the Seven Network broadcast its final games before the Nine Network and Pay-TV operator Foxtel took over from the 2010 Winter Olympics and beyond.
2010s.
2010 Winter Games.
Vancouver 2010 was broadcast worldwide by a number of television broadcasters. As rights for the 2010 games were packaged with those for the 2012 Summer Olympics, broadcasters were largely identical for both events. Broadcasters included:
2012 Summer Games.
Continuing the IOC's commitment to providing over-the-air television coverage to as broad a worldwide audience as possible, London 2012 is scheduled to be broadcast by a number of regional broadcasters. Though reduced dramatically since 1980, the United States television rights currently owned by NBC still account for over half the rights revenue for the IOC. Many television broadcasters granted rights to the games have bureaux and studios in London, but since at least the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, rights-holder operations are hosted in the dedicated International Broadcast Centre (IBC). London's IBC is planned to be within the London Olympics Media Centre inside the security cordon of the Olympic Park.
As rights for the 2012 games have been packaged with those for the 2010 Winter Olympics, broadcasters will be largely identical for both events. Confirmed broadcasters include:
2014 Winter and 2016 Summer Games.
On August 19, 2008, it was reported that ESPN and ABC, both owned by The Walt Disney Company, were interested in airing the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. ESPN and ABC planned to carry more Olympic events live as opposed to the tape-delay format used by current rights-holder NBC. NBC, FOX and a partnership between CBS and Turner Sports also participated in the bidding process for televising the Games in the United States. In 2011, NBC agreed to a $4.38 billion contract with the International Olympic Committee to broadcast the 2014, 2016, 2018, and 2020 Olympics, the most expensive television rights deal in Olympic history.
In Brazil, Rede Globo and Band won the rights to broadcast the games, but they allowed the IOC to negotiate with others broadcasters about the free-to-air transmission. Rede Record purchased the rights for the free-to-air broadcasts. But, they have the exclusive rights for cable TV and internet.
In Europe, for the first time, the IOC rejected the offer from EBU to broadcast the 2014 & 2016 Olympics, so individual networks in Europe must contract for television rights.
SKY Italia had reached an agreement to broadcast 2014 & 2016 Olympics, but later, it sold the second one to RAI, holding only the first one.
In Canada, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation were granted rights to the 2014 and 2016 games in July 2012 for an undisclosed sum.
In Australia, Network Ten achieved an agreement for 2014 Winter Games spending $20 million, but the 2016 Summer Games are still unsold as IOC refused an $80 million offer from Seven Network.

Prinzenerlass

Prinzenerlass ("the Princes' decree") was the name of a decree issued in 1940 by Adolf Hitler that prohibited all members of Germany's formerly reigning royal houses from joining or participating in any military operations in the Wehrmacht.
Until the Nazi seizure of power, and even until the outbreak of World War II, the members of the former German nobility continued to enjoy the rights they had prior to the abolition of the monarchy in 1918.
In May 1940, Prince Wilhelm of Prussia, the grandson of Kaiser Wilhelm II, took part in the invasion of France. He was wounded during the fighting in Valenciennes and died in a field hospital in Nivelles on 26 May 1940. His funeral service was held at the Church of Peace, and he was buried in the Hohenzollern family mausoleum in the Antique Temple in Sanssouci Park. The service drew over 50,000 mourners.
His death and the ensuing sympathy of the German public toward a member of the former German royal house greatly bothered Hitler, and he began to see the Hohenzollerns as a threat to his power. Shortly afterwards, the "Prinzenerlass" was issued, and all members of the former German royal houses were relieved from combat duties.
The law was not rigorously applied, however. In just one example, Eberhard von Urach (1907-1969), the fourth son of the second duke of Urach, and father of the fourth and fifth dukes, served until his capture in 1944.

Germà de Gontaut

Germà de Gontaut (, ) (fl. 1355–1386) was an Occitan poet and merchant. 
Germà is mentioned as a "mercadier" (merchant) in the prologue to the final version of the "Leys d'amor" of Joan de Castellnou (1355). At that time he was one of the seven maintainers ("mantenidors") of the Consistori del Gay Saber, an Occitan poetric academy in Toulouse. 
On 3 May 1386 Germà de Gontaut with Ramon Galbarra judged a "partimen" (poetic debate) between Jacme Rovira and Bernat de Palaol for the Consistori del Gay Saber. The subject of the debate was this: there was a young lord who loved a young lady who did not return the love, yet there was another young lady, of equal worth, who loved him deeply but to whom he was unattracted; to which of these should he devote his service? Bernat defended the second lady, but the judges found in favour of Jacme and the first lady: the lord, they said, ought to devote himself to the one he truly loves, not the one who truly loves him. The judges' decision was given in verse, in a serious tone completely unbefitting the lighthearted nature of the contest.

USS Surprise (PG-97)

The fourth USS "Surprise" and fifth American naval ship of the name was an "Asheville" class patrol gunboat that served in the United States Navy from 1969 to 1973.
Technical description.
Patrol gunboat USS "Surprise" (PG-97) was laid down at Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, on 24 May 1968 by the Peterson Builders Shipyard, launched on 7 December 1968 sponsored by Miss Marsha L. Peterson.
"Surprise" was a fast gunboat powered by geared Diesel engines for cruising, with a gas turbine which could be cut in for high speeds. She was armed with a director-controlled 3-inch (76.2-mm) 50-caliber automatic dual-purpose gun forward and a 40-millimeter Bofors gun aft. Pairs of .50-caliber (12.7-mm) machine guns were mounted on the upper deck amidships, one each to port and starboard.
Operational history.
After a pre-commissioning voyage through the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence Seaway, USS "Surprise" was commissioned at Boston Massachusetts, on 17 October 1969, Lieutenant William T. Shiffer, Jr., in command.
"Surprise" completed fitting out in Boston on 12 November 1969, when she got underway for Little Creek, Virginia. Along the way, she stopped at New York City, and loaded ammunition at Crane, New Jersey. She reached Little Creek Naval Amphibious Base on 18 November 1969 and, through the first week of 1970, she operated from that base, conducting training. During that period she also made a visit to Washington, D.C., where she demonstrated her capabilities to military and civilian officials.
On 12 January 1970, "Surprise" departed Little Creek for her new home port, San Diego, California. At Mayport, Florida, she and her traveling companion, patrol gunboat , were joined by a third patrol gunboat, . The three ships made their way to Panama via Port Everglades, Florida, and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. "Surprise" transited the Panama Canal on 22 January 1970 and, on 24 January 1970, continued her voyage. The formation was joined by amphibious transport dock on 28 January 1970 and steamed into San Diego on 7 February 1970.
"Surprise" conducted shakedown training out of San Diego until early April 1970. Then she engaged in normal operations until 13 May 1970, when she entered Long Beach Naval Shipyard at Long Beach, California, for six weeks of post-shakedown shipyard availability. "Surprise" completed the yard period on 9 July 1970 and returned to San Diego. She resumed training exercises until the end of August 1970, when she reentered Long Beach Naval Shipyard.
On 20 September 1970, her home port was switched back to Little Creek, Virginia, and on 8 October 1970 she departed San Diego to return to the U.S. East Coast. She re-transited the Panama Canal on 21 October 1970 and made Little Creek on 31 October 1970. On 16 November 1970, she departed Little Creek to rendezvous with Amphibious Group 2 for a voyage to the Mediterranean. She arrived at Rota, Spain, on 1 December 1970 and shifted operational control to the United States Sixth Fleet. The ship's home port was switch to Naples,Italy.
"Surprise" served with the Sixth Fleet until February 1973. During that period, she participated in a number of exercises both with units of foreign navies and with other elements of the Sixth Fleet. Throughout her tour, she visited numerous ports on the Mediterranean littoral, including Naples, Souda Bay, Monaco, Cartageña, and Venice. On two occasions, she ventured out of the Mediterranean. From 18 October 1971 to 22 October 1971, she visited Istanbul, Turkey, and, from 11 March 1972 to 15 March 1972, she put into Casablanca on the Atlantic coast of North Africa.
On 29 January 1973, a prospective Turkish crew for "Surprise" assembled in Naples and the gunboat began preparations for decommissioning and turnover to the Turkish Navy. The Turks trained in "Surprise" under the guidance of her American crewmen until 16 February 1973. She then departed Naples for Turkey, arriving at İzmir on 19 February 1973. On 28 February 1973, "Surprise" was decommissioned and turned over to the Turkish Navy on loan.
She was commissioned into the Turkish Navy as Turkish Republic Ship (TCG) "Bora" (P339), on 9 March 1973. Purchased outright from the United States in June 1987, "Bora" served in the Turkish Navy until deleted in 2000.

Cathedral of the Sacred Heart (Fairbanks, Alaska)

Cathedral of the Sacred Heart (often referred to in shorthand as Sacred Heart Cathedral) is a cathedral of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States. It is the motherchurch of the Diocese of Fairbanks and is the seat of the bishop of the diocese. It is located in the City of Fairbanks in the state of Alaska and sits close to the geographic center of the city.
History.
Prior to the construction of Sacred Heart, Immaculate Conception Church in downtown Fairbanks served as the city's cathedral. Ground was broken for Sacred Heart Cathedral in 1962 on a large tract of land at the intersection of Airport and Peger Roads. Just a few years before, this area was largely wilderness, until the development of residential subdivisions and the A-67 site to the north of the cathedral. The Rev. James Spils, S.J. served as construction superintendent. He was responsible for other construction projects in Alaska as well. The project proceeded slowly and work was done as money became available. The first Mass was celebrated on Palm Sunday, April 3, 1966 and the cathedral was consecrated by Bishop Francis Doyle Gleeson, S.J. on the Solemnity of the Sacred Heart, June 17, 1966. Jesuit priests served the parish until 1982, when priests from the Diocese of Fairbanks took over. Bishop Donald Joseph Kettler served as the parish's pastor from 2007 to 2013. 
The expansion of Airport Road into the Airport Way expressway during the 1970s placed the cathedral's north wall very close to the road, which increased its architectural prominence to passing traffic. Peger Road, which originally led from Airport Road two miles south to a homestead along a section line, has also been expanded steadily over the years. Peger Road is farther away from the structure, and therefore it is not as prominent to traffic along that road.
The tract of land upon which the cathedral sits is also home to the diocesan offices, a rectory, a Knights of Columbus hall and maintenance buildings, as well as additional residences for priests, nuns and others.

Hitler family

The Hitler family comprises the relatives and ancestors of Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889 – 30 April 1945) who was an Austrian-born German politician and the leader of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (, abbreviated NSDAP), commonly known as the Nazi Party. He was Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and served as head of state as "Führer und Reichskanzler" from 1934 to 1945. Hitler is most remembered for his central leadership role in the rise of fascism in Europe, World War II and the Holocaust.
Before the birth of Adolf Hitler, the family surname had many variations that were often used almost interchangeably. Some of the common variances were Hitler, Hiedler, Hüttler, Hytler, and Hittler. Alois Schicklgruber (Adolf's father) changed his name on 7 January 1877 to "Hitler", which was the only form of the last name that Adolf used.
The family has long been of interest to historians and genealogists because of the sometimes-disputed paternity of Adolf Hitler's father as well as the family's inter-relationships and their psychological effect on Adolf during his childhood.
Family history.
Earliest family members.
The Hitler family descends from Stefan Hiedler (born 1672) and his wife, Agnes Capeller. Their grandson was Martin Hiedler (17 November 1762 – 10 January 1829), who married Anna Maria Göschl (23 August 1760 – 7 December 1854). Martin and Anna were the parents of at least three children, Lorenz, about whom there is no further information, Johann Georg (baptised 28 February 1792 – 9 February 1857), who was the stepfather of Alois Hitler (father of Adolf), and Johann Nepomuk (19 March 1807 – 17 September 1888), a maternal great grandfather of Adolf Hitler. They were from Spital (part of Weitra), Austria.
Johann Georg and Johann Nepomuk.
Brothers Johann Georg and Johann Nepomuk Hiedler are connected to Adolf Hitler in several ways, although the biological relationship is disputed.
Johann Georg was legitimized and considered the officially accepted paternal grandfather of Adolf Hitler by the Third Reich. Whether or not he was actually Hitler's biological paternal grandfather remains unknown as he was not put as the father on Alois's birth certificate, but most historians are satisfied that Alois' father was Johann Georg Hiedler. He married his first wife in 1824, but she died in childbirth five months later. In 1842, he married Maria Anna Schicklgruber and became the legal stepfather to her illegitimate five-year-old son, Alois.
Johann Nepomuk Hiedler (also known as Johann Nepomuk Hüttler) was named after a Bohemian saint, Johann von Nepomuk. Some view this name as evidence that Johann Nepomuk and therefore his great-grandson Adolf Hitler had some Czech blood. However, Johann von Pomuk/Johann Nepomuk was an important saint for Bohemians of both German and Czech ethnicity. The name "Nepomuk" merely indicates ties to Bohemia, without indication of ethnicity. Johann Nepomuk became a relatively prosperous farmer and was married to Eva Maria Decker (1792–1873), who was fifteen years his senior.
Father of Alois Hitler.
The identity of Alois' actual father is disputed. Legally, Johann Nepomuk was the step-uncle of Alois Schicklgruber (later Alois Hitler), the stepson of his brother Johann Georg Hiedler, a wandering miller. For reasons unknown, he took in Alois when he was a boy and raised him. It is possible that he was, in fact, Alois' natural father but could not acknowledge this publicly due to his marriage. Another, perhaps simpler, explanation for this kindness is that he took pity on the ten-year-old Alois. Alois was, after all, Johann Georg's stepson, and after the death of Alois' mother Maria, it could hardly have been a suitable life for a ten-year-old child to be raised by an itinerant miller. Johann Nepomuk died on 17 September 1888.
In any case, when he died, Johann Nepomuk left Alois a considerable portion of his life savings. Johann Nepomuk's granddaughter, Klara, had a longstanding affair with Alois before marrying him in 1885 after the death of his second wife. In 1889, she gave birth to Adolf Hitler.
It was later claimed that Johann Georg had fathered Alois prior to his marriage to Maria, although Alois had been declared illegitimate on his birth certificate and baptism papers; the claim that Johann Georg was the true father of Alois was not made after the marriage of Maria and Johann Georg, or, indeed, even during the lifetime of either of them. In 1877, 20 years after the death of Johann Georg and almost 30 years after the death of Maria, Alois was legally declared to have been Johann Georg's son.
Accordingly, Johann Georg Hiedler is one of three people most cited by modern historians as having possibly been the actual paternal grandfather of Adolf Hitler. The other two possibilities regarding the paternity are Johann Nepomuk Hiedler, the younger brother of Johann Georg, and a Graz Jew by the name of Leopold Frankenberger (rumored by ex-Nazi Hans Frank during the Nuremberg Trials). In the 1950s, the third possibility became popular among historians, but modern historians have now concluded that Frank's speculation is not reliable as it has many contradictions. He said that Maria came from "Leonding near Linz", when in fact she came from the hamlet of Strones, near the village of Döllersheim. No evidence has ever been found that a "Frankenberger" even existed; the Jews were expelled from Styria (which includes Graz) in the 15th century and were not permitted to return until the 1860s, several decades after Alois' birth.
Although Johann Georg Hiedler was later legitimized and considered the officially accepted paternal grandfather of Adolf Hitler by the Third Reich, the question of whether or not he was Hitler's grandfather remains unknown and has caused speculation. However, his case is considered the most plausible and widely accepted. German historian Joachim Fest wrote:
Pölzl family.
Johanna Hiedler, the daughter of Johann Nepomuk and Eva Hiedler ("née" Decker) was born on 19 January 1830 in Spital (part of Weitra) in the Waldviertel of Lower Austria. She lived her entire life there and was married to Johann Baptist Pölzl (1825–1901), a farmer and son of Johann Pölzl and Juliana (Walli) Pölzl. Johanna and Johann had 5 sons and 6 daughters, of whom 2 sons and 3 daughters survived into adulthood, the 3 daughters being Klara, Johanna, and Theresia.
1870s.
At the age of 36, Alois Hitler was married for the first time, to Anna Glasl-Hörer, who was a wealthy, 50-year-old daughter of a customs official. She was sick when Alois married her and was either an invalid or became one shortly afterwards. Not long after marrying her, Alois Hitler began an affair with 19-year-old Franziska "Fanni" Matzelsberger, one of the young female servants employed at the Pommer Inn, house #219, in the city of Braunau am Inn, where he was renting the top floor as a lodging. Smith states that Alois had numerous affairs in the 1870s, resulting in his wife initiating legal action; on 7 November 1880 Alois and Anna separated by mutual agreement. Matzelsberger became the 43-year-old Hitler's girlfriend, but the two could not marry since under Roman Catholic canon law, divorce is not permitted. In 1876, three years after Alois married Anna, he hired Klara Pölzl as a household servant. She was the 16-year-old granddaughter of his step-uncle (and possible father or biological uncle) Nepomuk. If Nepomuk was Alois' father, Klara was Alois' half-niece. If his father was Johann Georg, she was his first cousin once removed. Matzelsberger demanded that the "servant girl" Klara find another job, and Hitler sent Pölzl away.
1880s.
On 13 January 1882, Matzelsberger gave birth to Hitler's illegitimate son, also named Alois, but since they were not married, the child was Alois Matzelsberger. Hitler kept Matzelsberger as his wife while his lawful wife Anna grew sicker and died on 6 April 1883. The next month, on 22 May at a ceremony in Braunau with fellow customs officials as witnesses, Hitler, 45, married Matzelsberger, 21. He then legitimized his son as Alois Hitler, Jr. Matzelsberger went to Vienna to give birth to Angela Hitler. When she was still only 23, she acquired a lung disorder and became too ill to function. She was moved to Ranshofen, a small village near Braunau. During the last months of Matzelsberger's life, Klara Pölzl returned to Alois' home to look after the invalid and their two children. Matzelsberger died in Ranshofen on 10 August 1884 at the age of 23. After her death, Pölzl remained in Hitler's home as housekeeper.
Pölzl was soon pregnant by Alois. Smith writes that if Hitler had been free to do as he wished, he would have married Pölzl immediately, but because of the affidavit concerning his paternity, Hitler was now legally Pölzl's first cousin once removed, too close to marry. He submitted an appeal to the church for a humanitarian waiver. Permission came, and on 7 January 1885 a wedding was held at Hitler's rented rooms on the top floor of the Pommer Inn. A meal was served for the few guests and witnesses. Hitler then went to work for the rest of the day. Even Klara found the wedding to be a short ceremony. Throughout the marriage, she continued to call him "uncle".
On 17 May 1885, five months after the wedding, the new Frau Klara Hitler gave birth to her first child, Gustav. A year later, on 25 September 1886, she gave birth to a daughter, Ida. Her son Otto followed Ida in 1887, but he died shortly after birth. During the winter of 1887–1888, diphtheria struck the Hitler household, resulting in the deaths of both Gustav (8 December) and Ida (2 January). Klara and Alois had been married for three years, and all their children were dead, but Alois still had the children from his relationship with Matzelsberger, Alois Jr., and Angela. On 20 April 1889, Klara gave birth to Adolf.
1890s.
Adolf was a sickly child, and his mother fretted over him. Alois was 51 when he was born, had little interest in child rearing and left it all to his wife. When not at work he was either in a tavern or busy with his hobby: keeping bees. In 1892, Hitler was transferred from Braunau to Passau. He was 55, Klara 32, Alois Jr. 10, Angela 9, and Adolf was three years old. In 1894, Hitler was reassigned to Linz. Klara gave birth to their fifth child, Edmund, on 24 March 1894, and so it was decided that she and the children would stay in Passau for the time being.
In February 1895, Hitler purchased a house on a 9-acre (36,000 m²) plot in Hafeld near Lambach, approximately southwest of Linz. The farm was called the Rauscher Gut. He moved his family to the farm and retired on 25 June 1895 at the age of 58 after 40 years in the customs service. He found farming difficult; he lost money, and the value of the property declined. On 21 January 1896, Paula was born. Alois was often home with his family. He had five children ranging in age from infancy to 14; Smith suggests he yelled at the children almost continually and made long visits to the local tavern. Robert G. L. Waite noted, "Even one of his closest friends admitted that Alois was 'awfully rough' with his wife and 'hardly ever spoke a word to her at home.'" If Hitler was in a bad mood, he picked on the older children or Klara herself, in front of them. 
After Hitler and his oldest son Alois Jr had a climactic and violent argument, Alois Jr left home at 14, and the elder Alois swore he would never give the boy a penny of inheritance beyond what the law required. Apparently his relations with his stepmother Klara were also strained. After working as an apprentice waiter in the Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin, Ireland, he was arrested for theft and served a five-month sentence in 1900, followed by an eight-month sentence in 1902.
1900s.
Edmund, the youngest Hitler boy, died of measles on 2 February 1900. Alois wanted his son Adolf to seek a career in the civil service. However, Adolf had become so alienated from his father that he was repulsed by whatever Alois wanted. Adolf sneered at the thought of a lifetime spent enforcing petty rules. Alois tried to browbeat his son into obedience while Adolf did his best to be the opposite of whatever his father wanted.
Alois Hitler died in 1903, leaving Klara a government pension. She sold the house in Leonding and moved with young Adolf and Paula to an apartment in Linz, where they lived frugally. Three or four years later a tumor was diagnosed in her breast. Following a long series of painful iodoform treatments given by her doctor Eduard Bloch, Klara died at home in Linz on 21 December 1907. Adolf and Paula were at her side. The siblings were left with some financial support from their mother's pension and her modest estate. Klara was buried in Leonding.
Adolf Hitler had a close relationship with his mother, was crushed by her death and carried the grief for the rest of his life. Speaking of Hitler, Bloch later recalled that after Klara's death he had seen in "one young man never so much pain and suffering".
On 14 September 1903 Angela Hitler, Adolf's half-sister, married Leo Raubal (11 June 1879 – 10 August 1910), a junior tax inspector, and on 12 October 1906 she gave birth to a son, Leo. On 4 June 1908 Angela gave birth to Geli and in 1910 to a second daughter, Elfriede (Elfriede Maria Hochegger, 10 January 1910 – 24 September 1993).
1910s.
In 1909, Alois Hitler, Jr. met an Irishwoman by the name of Bridget Dowling at the Dublin Horse Show. They eloped to London and married on June 3, 1910. William Dowling, Bridget's father, threatened to have Alois arrested for kidnapping, but Bridget dissuaded him. The couple settled in Liverpool, where their son William Patrick Hitler was born in 1911. The family lived in a flat at 102 Upper Stanhope Street. The house was destroyed in the last German air-raid on Liverpool on 10 January 1942. Nothing remains of the house or those that surrounded it, and the area was eventually cleared and grassed over. Bridget Dowling's memoirs claim Adolf Hitler lived with them in Liverpool from 1912 to 1913 while he was on the run for dodging the draft in his native Austria-Hungary, but most historians dismiss this story as a fiction invented to make the book more appealing to publishers. Alois attempted to make money by running a small restaurant in Dale Street, a boarding house on Parliament Street and a hotel on Mount Pleasant, all of which failed. Alois Jr. left his family in May 1914 and he returned alone to the German Empire to establish himself in the safety-razor business. 
Paula had moved to Vienna, where she worked as a secretary. She did not have contact with Adolf during the period comprising his difficult years as a painter in Vienna and later Munich, military service during World War I and early political activities back in Munich. She was delighted to meet him again in Vienna during the early 1920s, though she later claimed to have been privately distraught at his subsequent rising fame.
World War I.
When World War I broke out, Alois Jr. was stranded in Germany and it was impossible for his wife and son to join him. He married another woman, Hedwig Heidemann (or Hedwig Mickley), in 1916. After the war, a third party informed Bridget that he was dead.
At the outbreak of World War I, Hitler was a resident of Munich and volunteered to serve in the Bavarian Army as an Austrian citizen. Posted to the Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 16 (1st Company of the List Regiment). Hitler's case was not exceptional as he was not the only Austrian soldier in the List Regiment. It is likely Hitler was accepted into the Bavarian army either simply because nobody had asked him whether or not he was a German citizen when he first volunteered or because the recruiting authorities were happy to accept any volunteer and simply did not care what Hitler's nationality was, or because he might have told the Bavarian authorities that he intended on becoming a German citizen. We cannot know. 
He served as a dispatch runner on the Western Front in France and Belgium, spending nearly half his time well behind the front lines. He was present at the First Battle of Ypres, the Battle of the Somme, the Battle of Arras, and the Battle of Passchendaele, and was wounded at the Somme.
He was decorated for bravery, receiving the Iron Cross, Second Class, in 1914. Recommended by Hugo Gutmann, he received the Iron Cross, First Class, on 4 August 1918, a decoration rarely awarded to one of Hitler's rank ("Gefreiter"). Hitler's post at regimental headquarters, providing frequent interactions with senior officers, may have helped him receive this decoration. Though his rewarded actions may have been courageous, they were probably not highly exceptional. He also received the Black Wound Badge on 18 May 1918.
During his service at the headquarters, Hitler pursued his artwork, drawing cartoons, and instructions for an army newspaper. During the Battle of the Somme in October 1916, he was wounded either in the groin area or the left thigh by a shell that had exploded in the dispatch runners' dugout. 
Hitler spent almost two months in the Red Cross hospital at Beelitz, returning to his regiment on 5 March 1917. On 15 October 1918, he was temporarily blinded by a mustard gas attack and was hospitalised in Pasewalk. While there, Hitler learnt of Germany's defeat, and—by his own account—on receiving this news, he suffered a second bout of blindness.
Hitler became embittered over the collapse of the war effort, and his ideological development began to firmly take shape. He described the war as "the greatest of all experiences", and was praised by his commanding officers for his bravery. The experience reinforced his passionate German patriotism and he was shocked by Germany's capitulation in November 1918. Like other German nationalists, he believed in the "Dolchstoßlegende" (stab-in-the-back legend), which claimed that the German army, "undefeated in the field", had been "stabbed in the back" on the home front by civilian leaders and Marxists, later dubbed the "November criminals".
The Treaty of Versailles stipulated that Germany must relinquish several of its territories and demilitarise the Rhineland. The treaty imposed economic sanctions and levied heavy reparations on the country. Many Germans perceived the treaty—especially Article 231, which declared Germany responsible for the war—as a humiliation. The Versailles Treaty and the economic, social, and political conditions in Germany after the war were later exploited by Hitler for political gains.
1920s.
On 14 March 1920, Heinrich "Heinz" Hitler was born to Alois Jr and his second wife, Hedwig Heidemann. In 1924, Alois Jr was prosecuted for bigamy, but acquitted due to Bridget's intervention on his behalf. His older son, William Patrick, stayed with Alois and his new family during his early trips to Weimar Republic Germany in the late 1920s and early 1930s.
When Adolf was confined in Landsberg, Angela made the trip from Vienna to visit him. Angela's daughters, Geli and Elfriede, accompanied their mother when she became Hitler's housekeeper in 1925; Geli Raubal was 17 at the time and would spend the next six years in close contact with her half-uncle. Her mother was given a position as housekeeper at the Berghof villa near Berchtesgaden in 1928. Geli moved into Hitler's Munich apartment in 1929 when she enrolled in the Ludwig Maximilian University to study medicine. She did not complete her medical studies.
As he rose to power as leader of the Nazi Party, Adolf kept a tight rein over his half-niece and behaved in a domineering and possessive manner. When he discovered she was having a relationship with his chauffeur, Emil Maurice, he forced an end to the affair and dismissed Maurice from his service. After that he did not allow her to freely associate with friends, and attempted to have himself or someone he trusted near her at all times, accompanying her on shopping trips, to the movies, and to the opera.
Adolf met Eva Braun, 23 years his junior, at Heinrich Hoffmann's photography studio in Munich in October 1929. He occasionally dated other women as well, including Hoffmann's daughter, Henrietta, and Maria Reiter.
1930s.
Some historians believe that Hitler had a sexual relationship with his half-niece, Geli, who committed suicide in 1931. 
After having little contact with her brother Adolf, Paula was delighted to meet him again in Vienna during the early 1930s. By her own account, after losing a job with a Viennese insurance company in 1930 when her employers found out who she was, Paula received financial support from her brother (which continued until his suicide in late April 1945). She lived under the assumed family name "Wolf" at Hitler's request (this was a childhood nickname of his which he had also used during the 1920s for security purposes) and worked sporadically. She later claimed to have seen her brother about once a year during the 1930s and early 1940s.
In 1934, Alois Jr. established a restaurant in Berlin which became a popular meeting place for SA Stormtroopers. He managed to keep the restaurant open through the duration of World War II.
Angela strongly disapproved of Adolf's relationship with Eva Braun; she eventually left Berchtesgaden as a result and moved to Dresden. Hitler broke off relations with Angela and did not attend her second wedding. On 20 January 1936 she married German architect Professor Martin Hammitzsch, the Director of the State School of Building Construction in Dresden.
World War II.
As Adolf led Germany into World War II, he became distant to his family. Despite having previously becoming estranged after disapproval of Adolf's relationship with Eva Braun, Angela and Adolf eventually re-established contact during the war. Angela was his intermediary to the rest of the family, because Adolf did not want contact. In 1941, she sold her memoirs of her years with Hitler to the Eher Verlag, which brought her 20,000 Reichsmark. Meanwhile, Alois Jr. continued to manage his restaurant throughout the duration of the war. He was arrested by the British, but released when it became clear he had played no role in his brother's regime.
A couple of Adolf's relatives served in Nazi Germany during the war. Adolf's nephew Heinz was a member of the Nazi Party. He attended an elite Nazi military academy, the National Political Institutes of Education (Napola) in Ballenstedt/Saxony-Anhalt. Aspiring to be an officer, Heinz joined the Wehrmacht as a signals NCO with the 23rd Potsdamer Artillery Regiment in 1941, and he participated in the invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa. On 10 January 1942, he was captured by Soviet forces and sent to the Moscow military prison Butyrka, where he died, aged 21, after interrogation and torture.
Adolf's other nephew, Leo Rudolf Raubal, was drafted by the Luftwaffe. He was injured in January 1943 during the Battle of Stalingrad, and Friedrich Paulus asked Hitler for a plane to evacuate Raubal to Germany. Hitler refused and Raubal was captured by the Soviets on 31 January 1943. Hitler gave orders to check out the possibility of a prisoner exchange with the Soviets for Stalin's son Yakov Dzhugashvili, who was in German captivity since 16 July 1941. Stalin refused to exchange him either for Raubal or for Friedrich Paulus, and said "war is war."
In the spring of 1945, after the destruction of Dresden in the massive bomb attack of February 13/14, Adolf moved Angela to Berchtesgaden to avoid her being captured by the Soviets. Also, he let her and his younger sister Paula have over 100,000 Reichsmark. Paula barely saw her brother during the war. There is some evidence Paula shared her brother's strong German nationalist beliefs, but she was not politically active and never joined the Nazi Party. During the closing days of the war, at the age of 49, she was driven to Berchtesgaden, Germany, apparently on the orders of Martin Bormann.
Adolf and Eva Braun committed suicide in the Führerbunker on 30 April 1945.
Post-World War II.
In Hitler's Last Will and Testament, he guaranteed Angela a pension of 1,000 Reichsmark monthly. It is uncertain if she ever received a penny of this amount. Nevertheless, she spoke very highly of him even after the war, and claimed that neither her brother nor she herself had known anything about the Holocaust. She declared that if Adolf had known what was going on in the concentration camps, he would have stopped them.
Adolf's sister Paula was arrested by US intelligence officers in May 1945 and debriefed later that year. A transcript shows one of the agents remarking she bore a physical resemblance to her sibling. She told them the Russians had confiscated her house in Austria, the Americans had expropriated her Vienna apartment and that she was taking English lessons. She characterized her childhood relationship with her brother as one of both constant bickering and strong affection. Paula said she could not bring herself to believe her brother had been responsible for the Holocaust. She also told them she had met Eva Braun only once. Paula was released from American custody and returned to Vienna where she lived on her savings for a time, then worked in an arts and crafts shop.
Other relatives of Adolf Hitler were approached by the Soviets. In May 1945, five of Adolf Hitler's relatives were arrested, his first cousins, Maria, Johann, and Eduard Schmidt, along with Maria's husband Ignaz Koppensteiner, their son Adolf, and Johann Schmidt, Jr., son of Maria and Eduard's deceased brother Johann. Koppensteiner was arrested by the Soviets on the basis that he "approved of [Hitler's] criminal plans against the USSR." He died in a Moscow prison in 1949. Both Eduard and Maria died in Soviet custody in 1951 and 1953, respectively. Johann Jr. was released in 1955. These relatives were posthumously pardoned by Russia in 1997.
In 1952, Paula Hitler moved to Berchtesgaden, Germany, reportedly living "in seclusion" in a two-room flat as Paula Wolff. During this time, she was looked after by former members of the SS and survivors of her brother's inner circle. In February 1959, she agreed to be interviewed by Peter Morley, a documentary producer for British television station Associated-Rediffusion. The resulting conversation was the only filmed interview she ever gave and was broadcast as part of a programme called "Tyranny: The Years of Adolf Hitler". She talked mostly about Hitler's childhood. Angela died of a stroke on 30 October 1949. Her brother, Alois Jr., died on 20 May 1956 in Hamburg. Paula, Adolf's last surviving sibling, died on 1 June 1960, at the age of 64.
Children.
It is alleged that Hitler had a son, Jean-Marie Loret, with a Frenchwoman named Charlotte Lobjoie. Jean-Marie Loret was born in March 1918 and died in 1985, aged 67. Loret married several times, and had up to nine children. His family's lawyer has suggested that, if their descent from Hitler could be proven, they may be able to claim royalties for Hitler's book, "Mein Kampf". However, several historians such as Anton Joachimsthaler, and Sir Ian Kershaw, say that Hitler's paternity is unlikely or impossible.
Hitler family tree.
Note: For simplicity, the first (childless) marriage of Alois Hitler (b. 1837) to Anna Glasl-Hörer has been excluded, as have any marriages that may have occurred after 1945.
Braun family tree.
Note: For simplicity, the second marriages after 1945 of Ilse and Gretl have been excluded.

1995–96 Syracuse Orangemen basketball team

The 1995–96 Syracuse Orangemen basketball team represented Syracuse University. The head coach was Jim Boeheim, serving for his 20th year. The team played its home games at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse, New York. The team finished with a 29–9 (12–6) record, while making it to the Championship Game of the NCAA tournament.
The team was led by seniors John Wallace and Lazarus Sims. Fellow senior J.B. Reafsnyder, juniors Jason Cipolla and Otis Hill, sophomore Todd Burgan and Marius Janulis played key roles. Walk-on and future NFL star Donovan McNabb also appeared in five games.
Season recap.
Syracuse was aided by the return of John Wallace, who had declared for the NBA draft, but chose to withdraw his early entry. Wallace would lead Syracuse in scoring for 30-of-38 games, leading Syracuse to an early 11–0 record. 
With the Orangemen hitting a bump in mid-season losing five of eight Big East games, Boeheim chose to insert Jason Cipolla into the starting lineup in favor of Marius Janulis. The move worked as Syracuse would go 8–1 to finish the regular season with a record of 22–7. Syracuse would advance to the Big East Championship semi-finals, where it was knocked off by Connecticut, 85–67.
Syracuse was named a No. 4 seed for the tournament, and played one of its most memorable games in the Sweet 16 against Georgia. Cipolla hit a jumper as time expired in regulation to send the game to overtime, and John Wallace sealed the victory with a 3-pointer with 2 seconds remaining to propel Syracuse to an 83–81 win. Wallace finished with 30 points and 15 rebounds in that game.
Syracuse would knock off the Paul Pierce, Raef LaFrentz and Jacques Vaughn-led Kansas in the Elite 8, and Erick Dampier and the Mississippi State Bulldogs in the National Semifinal game. This set up a matchup between Jim Boeheim and former assistant Rick Pitino, who was now head coach of the Kentucky Wildcats in the National Championship game. 
Syracuse, a heavy underdog, nearly overcame a 13-point second-half deficit, closing to within to 2, but Kentucky held on for a 76–67 victory. Kentucky featured a deep team, including future NBA players Derek Anderson, Antoine Walker, Tony Delk and Ron Mercer.

Enrique Adolfo Jiménez Airport

Enrique Adolfo Jiménez Airport () is a commercial airport located in Colón, Panama, offering scheduled airline flights to the national capital, Panama City, and to other destinations.
Prior to its use as a civil airport, the facility was a United States Army (later USAF) military airfield, established in 1918. It was turned over to the Panama Canal Zone government in 1949, and was converted into a civil airport. United States control over the airport ended in 1979 with the turnover of the Panama Canal Zone to the government of Panama.
History.
Initially established as Coco Walk Aerodrome in March 1918
Operational history.
Origins.
What would become Enrique Adolfo Jiménez Airport has its origins before World War I, when on Sunday, 27 April 1913, the Isthmus of Panama was first overflown from a beach near Balboa, on the Pacific side, to the shores near Cristobal on the Atlantic side by an airplane. During the flight, an aerial camera was aboard the aircraft and a primitive motion picture was made of the Panama Canal, which was still not finished. It was realized by the United States authorities that it was possible that, in the future, an enemy of the United States could attack the canal, and possibly use bombs against it, carried on aircraft.
With the entry of the United States into World War I, concern for the security of the canal saw the first airborne forces of the Army being sent to the Canal Zone. Plans were made for the establishment of eight aeronautical stations, with a strength of two dirigibles and six or eight seaplanes for observation. The only site identified as immediately usable was at Coco Solo, near Colon. An emergency appropriation of $1,000,000 was rushed though Congress for this purpose. In addition to the airdrome, the facility would also house a Naval submarine base.
Initially garrisoned at Ancon, the 7th Aero Squadron was organized on 29 March 1917 with 51 officers and men. The unit moved several times to temporary facilities until finally settling in at their permanent facility in a former swamp called Coco Walk in March 1918. Shortly afterwords, on 24 April 1918, 1st Lieutenant Howard J. France crashed an unidentified "hydroplane" into Gatun Lake. He was the first Army pilot killed in the Canal Zone on active duty, and France Field was named in his honor.
World War I.
Almost from the beginning, it was realized that flying in the tropics was very different than in the United States. The 7th Aero Squadron flew patrols over the Canal, but only in very good weather. Patrols were flown three times a day over the Canal and in the coastal waters adjacent to the Atlantic entrance to the Canal. The aircraft used had little or no navigational equipment, basically a compass, and several aircraft were lost when the weather changed suddenly.
The early flights over the Canal Zone also performed mapping missions and both the Canal Zone and the isthmus were thoroughly explored and charted. A legacy which became quite valuable to Army and Navy personnel assigned there in succeeding decades.
With the end of the war in November 1918, the wartime forces of the United States were rapidly demobilized. In June 1919, the majority of men and aircraft of the 7th Aero Squadron were loaded onto steamers and returned home, leaving a small flight for duty at France Field.
Inter-War Years, 1919-1939.
During the early 1920s, France Field was expanded, as the defense of the Panama Canal was the major overseas concern of the Air Service (more so than the defense of the Philippines or the defense of the Hawaiian Islands). Although the 7th Aero Squadron was reduced in size after World War I, the unit remained active in the Canal Zone, undergoing several redesignations in the 1920s and 1930s.
As a direct result of the lessons learned during World War I in France, the Air service reorganized its tactical elements in 1922. Units were designated "Pursuit", "Bombardment" or "Observation", depending on their assigned mission and the type of aircraft assigned. The 7th Aero Squadron became the 7th Observation Squadron on 25 January 1922. In addition, two additional units, the 24th Pursuit Squadron and 25th Bombardment Squadron were organized at France Field. All of these units were assigned to the Panama Canal Department, which was the senior United States Army Headquarters in the Canal Zone on 30 April 1922. However while organized, the squadrons did not actually activate until 25 January 1923.
The Army was concerned that France Field, being the only operational airfield in the Canal Zone, was vulnerable to potential attackers, as well as to weather conditions. In addition, France Field was remotely located from the Pacific entrance to the Canal as well as the administration buildings of the Panama Canal Department. A second Army Airfield was developed in 1924 near the Pacific entrance to the Canal, initially known as Balboa Fill Landing Field. This was renamed in honor of 1LT Frank P. Albrook who had died in an aircraft accident, with Balboa being renamed Albrook Field.
By 1930, the expanding Air Corps in the Canal Zone required a new organization. The 19th Composite Wing was established at France Field on 8 May 1929 to provide a central command and control authority. The Wing was activated on 1 April 1931. Units under the 19th Composite Wing were:
Notes:
During the 1930s, France Field was modernized and the facilities upgraded over the decade and the number of assigned units increased as world tensions heightened. In 1935, the first monoplanes, Martin B-10s arrived, being assigned to the 25th Bomb Squadron. At the dawn of the United States entry into World War II, the units at France Field consisted of the following:
During World War II, the mission of the units at France Field consisted of the protection of the Atlantic side of the Panama Canal, and to fly antisubmarine missions over the Caribbean
With the end of World War II France Airfield was reduced in scope, with most units being moved to Albrook or Howard Fields. It was redesignated France Air Force Base on 26 March 1948, by the Department of the Air Force General Order Number 10.
Post military use.
France Air Force Base was deactivated on 1 November 1949 by the United States Air Force due to budgetary reductions, and turned into a civil airport in the United States Canal Zone and renamed Colon Airport. The USAF, however, maintained jurisdiction over the airport until 31 December 1973, and it was occasionally used as a satellite field of Albrook AFB.
As Colon Airport, it was served by Boeing 307 Stratoliners and other early airliners flying Pan Am routes from Miami to Buenos Aires, Argentina via Havana, Cuba and Kingston, Jamaica into Cristobal and Colón, then continuing south via Lima, Peru, into Buenos Aires. Being located near the midpoint of this route and at the point where it intersected the Panama Canal made this location a useful one for north-south airline services.
With the return of the Canal Zone to Panama on 1 October 1979, the airport was renamed for Enrique Adolfo Jiménez, who served as Panamanian president from 1945 to 1948.
On August 20, 2013. Panamanian President Ricardo M. open the new Enrique A. Jimenez International Airport. The new terminal can serve up to 1000 passengers on peak period and the new runway can land aircraft B757 type.
Incidents and accidents.
In 1994, this airport was the departure point for Alas Chiricanas Flight 00901, later downed by terrorists.

<doc id="18296418" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18296418" title="New Holland Machine Company">
New Holland Machine Company

The New Holland Machine Company was founded in 1895, when a young man by the name of Abram Zimmerman purchased a horse barn in New Holland, Pennsylvania, and established a blacksmith shop. 
Zimmerman was the third of seven children born to the Martin W. and Anna (Martin) Zimmerman. The Zimmermans were a very conservative Mennonite family. Abram Zimmerman was a mechanical genius who brought his talents to bear in the new blacksmith business as he began repairing and making farm machinery for the local farmers.
Historic building.
The New Holland Machine Company building located at 146 E. Franklin St. in New Holland, was built in eight sections between 1903 and 1952. It is a two-story, irregularly shaped, evolutionary industrial brick building. The facility closed in 1992.
It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.
Otto and Columbus engines.
Abram Zimmerman began retailing the German Otto four-cycle engine as part of his new business. The "Otto" was a single-cylinder dual flywheel stationary engine which was manufactured in Philadelphia. After a short while of selling the Otto, Abe Zimmerman switched to selling another single-cylinder dual-flywheel stationary engine called the "Columbus". Retailing these engines added income to the Zimmerman blacksmith shop. By 1896, the Zimmerman blacksmith was employing three employees. However, Zimmerman's innovative nature soon had developed a "better idea".
"Freeze proof" engine.
Zimmerman thought that he could build and manufactured his own stationary engine which would be lighter in weight and would be easier to repair and operate. By 1900, he had designed his own stationary engine and built prototypes of the engine.
Water cooling.
Like most stationary engines of the time, Zimmerman's new engine was water-cooled - a jacket around the cylinder was filled with water to keep the engine cool while the engine was in use. Generally, the water evaporated as the engine was operated and more water had to be added to the water jacket of the typical engine throughout the day.
Risk of freezing.
In the wintertime, the water jacket had to be drained of water when the farmer was through working with the engine. If not drained, the water would freeze in the water jacket, the ice would expand when freezing and this expansion would crack the cast iron engine.
Zimmerman's solution.
One of the innovations incorporated into Zimmerman's new engine was the fact that the water jacket was shaped like a bowl and was larger at the top than at the bottom. If water were left in the bowl-shaped water jacket of this new engine during a cold winter's night, the ice could expand harmlessly upwards and outwards without cracking the castings of the cylinder or engine. Thus, because of this bowl-shaped water jacket, Zimmerman's new engine was "freeze proof."
Incorporation.
With prototypes of his new engine completed, Zimmerman, now wished to manufacture and sell his new engine. To do this he needed to incorporate and take on some new investors. Accordingly, Zimmerman raised $50,000 by selling 500 shares in the new company to his neighbors. Thus in 1903, the "New Holland Machine Company" was born.
Zimmerman was selected chief executive of the new company. With this new capital, the company acquired a brick factory on Franklin Street in the city of New Holland and hired on 40 employees to mass-produce the new stationary engine.
Engine range.
Eventually, five different horsepower (hp) models of the "New Holland" stationary engine were mass-produced by the "New Holland Company". These five models started with the little 1½ hp engine and ranged upwards to a 16 hp model. The most popular seller among the line of stationary engines offered by "New Holland" was the 5 hp model. By 1911, sales of the 5 hp model "New Holland" stationary engine were up more than 253% over sales of the same engine in 1904.
Expansion.
Success attended the company from the very beginning. In its first annual report dated March 29, 1904, the company was able to report profits of $1,859.40 following its very first year of incorporation. Success in selling the stationary engines, led the "New Holland Machine Company" to expand into the manufacture of other farm machine products.
Feed grinder.
As early as November 1899, even before the company had been incorporated, Abe Zimmerman's blacksmith shop had been advertising a feed grinder of his own design. This "feed and cob mill" had a capacity of 10 to 30 bushels of feed per hour and was being offered to the farming public for $15.00. 
Later, after incorporation, the "New Holland Machine Company" sold these feed grinders with the option of being mounted on a wooden or steel truck and also with the option of having one of the four larger "New Holland" engines (4 hp through the 16 hp models) mounted on the truck together with the feed grinder. In this way the feed grinder and engine would form a single unit which could easily be moved around the farm.
Rock crusher and wood saw.
Following incorporation, other machines had been added to the line of "New Holland" machinery. In 1912, the company began manufacturing its own rock crusher and, by 1914, the "New Holland Machine Company" had also added a wood saw to its line of farm machinery. By 1911, the company had 150 employees. By 1927, the number of employees at the company had risen to 225.
Sale to Sperry.
The New Holland Machine Company was purchased by the Sperry Corporation in 1947, to form Sperry-New Holland. For the subsequent history see New Holland Ag.

Magnetic resonance neurography

Magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) is the direct imaging of nerves in the body by optimizing selectivity for unique MRI water properties of nerves. It is a modification of magnetic resonance imaging. This technique yields a detailed image of a nerve from the resonance signal that arises from in the nerve itself rather than from surrounding tissues or from fat in the nerve lining. Because of the intraneural source of the image signal, the image provides a medically useful set of information about the internal state of the nerve such as the presence of irritation, nerve swelling (edema), compression, pinch or injury. Standard magnetic resonance images can show the outline of some nerves in portions of their courses but do not show the intrinsic signal from nerve water. Magnetic resonance neurography is used to evaluate major nerve compressions such as those affecting the sciatic nerve (e.g. piriformis syndrome), the brachial plexus nerves (e.g. thoracic outlet syndrome), the pudendal nerve, or virtually any named nerve in the body. A related technique for imaging neural tracts in the brain and spinal cord is called magnetic resonance tractography or diffusion tensor imaging.
History and physical basis.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is based on differences in the physical properties of protons in water molecules in different tissues in the body. The protons and the water molecules of which they are part have subtly different movement characteristics that relate to their biophysical surroundings. Because of this, MRI is capable of differentiating one tissue from another; this provides "tissue contrast." From the time of the first clinical use of MRI in the mid 1970s until 1992, however, despite the active work of many thousands of researchers, there was no reliable method for visualizing nerve. In some parts of the body, nerves could be observed as areas of absent signal delineated by bright fat, or as bland grey structures that could not be reliably distinguished from other similar-appearing structures in cross sectional images. 
In 1992, Aaron Filler and Franklyn Howe, working at St. George's Hospital Medical School in London, succeeded in identifying the unique water properties of nerve water that would make it possible to generate tissue-specific nerve images. The result was an initial "pure" nerve image in which every other tissue was made to disappear leaving behind only the image of the nerves. The initial pure nerve image served as the basis of image processing techniques leading to discovery of a series of other MRI pulse sequence techniques that would make nerves imageable as well. Further, because they demonstrate water signal arising in the neural tissue itself, they can also reveal abnormalities that affect only the nerve and that do not affect surrounding tissues. More than three million patients seek medical attention every year for nerve-related disorders such as sciatica, carpal tunnel syndrome or various other nerve injuries, yet before 1992, no radiologists were trained to image nerves, and most physicians believed it simply could not be done usefully
There are two main physical bases for the imaging discovery. Firstly, it was known at the time that water diffused preferentially along the long axis of neural tissue in the brain – a property called "anisotropic diffusion". Diffusion MRI had been developed to take advantage of this phenomenon to show contrast between white matter and grey matter in the brain. However, diffusion MRI proved ineffective for imaging of nerves for reasons that were not initially clear. Filler and Howe discovered that the problem was that the most of the image signal in nerve came from protons that were not involved in anisotropic diffusion. They developed a collection of methods to suppress the "isotropic signal" and this resulted in allowing the anisotropic signal to be unmasked. This was based on the discovery that Chemical Shift Selection could be used to suppress "short T2 water" in the nerve and that this mostly affected isotropic water. 
The endoneurial fluid compartment in nerve can be unmasked by similar techniques resulting in a "T2" based neurography as well as the original diffusion based neurography technique. Endoneurial fluid increases when nerve is compressed, irritated or injured, leading to nerve image hyperintensity in an marnetic resonance neurography image. Subsequent research has further demonstrated the biophysical basis for the ability of MR Neurography to show nerve injury and irritation.
Measurements of the T2 relaxation rate of nerve by Filler and Howe revealed that previous reports of a short relaxation time were wrong and that—once signal from lipid protons was suppressed—the primary image signal from nerve had long T2 relaxation rates best imaged with pulse sequence echo times in the range of 50 to 100 milliseconds. In addition, they later showed that T2-neurography differs from most other MR imaging in that the conspicuity or relative prominence of nerve is affected by the angle of voxel orientation during the acquisition of the image. When acquisitions are done with echo times below 40 milliseconds, there can be "magic angle effects" that provide some spurious information, so MR Neurography is always done with echo times greater than 40 milliseconds. The need for long echo times also characterizes the type of inversion recovery fat suppression sequences used for neurography nerve imaging.
Within a few months of the initial findings on diffusion-based nerve imaging, the diffusion technique for nerve imaging was adapted to permit for visualization of neural tracts in the spinal cord and brain via Diffusion Tensor Imaging.
Clinical uses.
The most significant impact of magnetic resonance neurography is on the evaluation of the large proximal nerve elements such as the brachial plexus (the nerves between the cervical spine and the underarm that innervate shoulder, arm and hand), the lumbosacral plexus (nerves between the lumbosacral spine and legs), the sciatic nerve in the pelvis, as well as other nerves such as the pudendal nerve that follow deep or complex courses.
Neurography has also been helpful for improving image diagnosis in spine disorders. It can help identify which spinal nerve is actually irritated as a supplement to routine spinal MRI. Standard spinal MRI only demonstrates the anatomy and numerous disk bulges, bone spurs or stenoses that may or may not actually cause nerve impingement symptoms. 
Many nerves, such as the median and ulnar nerve in the arm or the tibial nerve in the tarsal tunnel, are just below the skin surface and can be tested for pathology with electromyography, but this technique has always been difficult to apply for deep proximal nerves. Magnetic resonance neurography has greatly expanded the efficacy of nerve diagnosis by allowing uniform evaluation of virtually any nerve in the body. 
There are numerous reports dealing with specialized uses of magnetic resonance neurography for nerve pathology such as cervical radiculopathy, guidance for nerve blocks, demonstration of cysts in nerves, carpal tunnel syndrome, and obstetrical brachial plexus palsy. In addition several formal large scale outcome trials carried out with high quality "Class A" methodology have been published that have verified the clinical efficacy and validity of MR Neurography.
Use of magnetic resonance neurography is increasing in neurology and neurosurgery as the implications of its value in diagnosing various causes of sciatica becomes more widespread. There are 1.5 million lumbar MRI scans performed in the US each year for sciatica, leading to surgery for a herniated disk in about 300,000 patients per year. Of these, about 100,000 surgeries fail. Therefore there is successful treatment for sciatica in just 200,000 and failure of diagnosis or treatment in up to 1.3 million annually in the US alone. The success rate of the paradigm of lumbar MRI and disk resection for treatment of sciatica is therefore about 15%(Filler 2005). Neurography has been applied increasingly to evaluate the distal nerve roots, lumbo-sacral plexus and proximal sciatic nerve in the pelvis and thigh to find other causes of sciatica. It is increasingly important for brachial plexus imaging and for the diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome. Research and development in the clinical use of diagnostic neurography has taken place at Johns Hopkins, the Mayo Clinic, UCLA, UCSF, Harvard, the University of Washington in Seattle, University of London, and Oxford University (see references below) as well as through the Neurography Institute. Recent patent litigation concerning MR Neurography has led some unlicensed centers to discontinue offering the technique. Courses have been offered for radiologists at the annual meetings of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA), and at the International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine and for surgeons at the annual meetings of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons. The use of imaging for diagnosis of nerve disorders represents a change from the way most physicians were trained to practice over the past several decades, as older routine tests fail to identify the diagnosis for nerve related disorders. The New England Journal of Medicine in July 2009 published a report on whole body neurography using a diffusion based neurography technique. In 2010, RadioGraphics - a publication of the Radiological Society of North America that serves to provide continuing medical education to radiologists - published an article series taking the position that Neurography has an important role in the evaluation of entrapment neuropathies.
Magnetic resonance neurography does not pose any diagnostic disadvantage relative to standard magnetic resonance imaging because neurography studies typically include high resolution standard MRI image series for anatomical reference along with the neurographic sequences. However, the patient will generally have a slightly longer time in the scanner compared to a routine MRI scan. Magnetic resonance neurography can only be performed in 1.5 tesla and 3 tesla cylindrical type scanners and can't really be done effectively in lower power "open" MR scanners - this can pose significant challenges for claustrophobic patients. Although it has been in use for fifteen years and is the subject of more than 150 research publications, most insurance companies still classify this test as experimental and may decline reimbursement, resulting in the need to file appeals. Patients in some plans obtain standard insurance coverage for this widely used procedure.

The National Bank of Serbia () is the central bank of Serbia. Founded in 1884, the responsibilities of the bank are: monetary policy, sole issuer of Serbian banknotes and coins, protection of price stability and promotion of stability of the financial system within Serbia. The current governor of the bank is Jorgovanka Tabaković, as of August 6, 2012.
History.
The bank was originally established on July 2, 1884 as the "Privileged National Bank of the Kingdom of Serbia". It was modeled after the National Bank of Belgium, considered at the time to be at the forefront of modern banking institutions. The first governor of the bank was Aleksa Spasić. Following the First World War, the bank underwent several changes as the country expanded and eventually became Yugoslavia. It wasn't until 2003 that the last remnant of Yugoslavia disappeared and the bank returned to minting Serbian currency.
Functions.
Core functions of the National Bank of Serbia include determining and implementation of the monetary policy, as well as that of the dinar exchange rate policy, management of the foreign currency reserves, issue of banknotes and coins, and maintenance of efficient payment and financial systems.

Don Carolis Hewavitharana

Early life.
He was born in Yatiyana, Hittetiya, Matara, the son of Hewavitharana Dingiri Appuhamy. He was educated at Hittatiya Raja Maha Vihara by Ven. Mirrise Revatha, his brother was to become a monk at the same monastery, later its chief incumbent. He became an astrologer by profession.
In 1860, he married Mallika Dharmagunawardhana, the daughter of Lansige Lansige Andiris Perera Dharmagunawardhana, a wealthy businessman from Colombo. The couple had 5 children, Don David Hewavitharana who later changed his name to Anagarika Dharmapala and became a prominent figure Buddhist revival movement in Ceylon and in India; Dr Charles Alwis Hewavitharana, a prominent physician and independence activist; Edmund Hewavitharana; Simon Alexander Hewavitharana and Dona Engeltina Moonesinghe.
H Don Carolis & Sons.
As dowry, Don Carolis received a furniture shop in the Pettah, which became H. Don Carolis & Sons Ltd, one of the largest and reputed furniture companies in Asia. In 1886 H Don Carolis & Sons exported furniture to Australia. An Indo-Afric syndicate was formed in London in 1895 to carry out a large furniture business with South Africa. This led to the establishment of the firm‘s first factory, 'Steam Furniture Works' in Slave Island. The firm became the dominant furniture maker in the country. 
By the turn of the century, the firm was exporting to Australia, South Africa, India, Burma, England, Europe & the USA. Don Carolis obtained Gold and Silver medals for furniture exhibited at the Ceylon Agricultural Exhibitions, the Indian Industrial Exhibition of 1901, the Paris Exhibition of 1900, and the Saint Louis Exposition of 1904.
Buddhist revival.
Until 1884, Buddhists were forced by the colonial authorities to declare themselves Christian. This was changed after Col. Henry Steel Olcott made representations to Secretary of State for the Colonies in London on behalf of the Buddhists of Sri Lanka.
The Buddhism Protection Committee (also known as the Colombo Committee) was formed in January 1884 under the patronage of Colonel Olcott, mainly with the objective of getting the Vesak full-moon day holiday restored. The British had not shown any interest in restoring the Vesak holiday which the Buddhists lost in 1770 during the Dutch rule. Dharmagunawardena was elected President with Don Carolis as Vice President.In 1885 the Vesak holiday was restored and the committee elected a steering committee, to which Don Carolis and his father-in-law were again elected, which went on to design the Buddhist flag.
Descendants.
Don Carolis had five children, the most notable being Anagarika Dharmapala and Dr CA Hewavitharana. Of the others, two had offspring. The most notable of this generation were:

1428 Catalonia earthquake

The Catalan earthquake of 2 February 1428, known in Catalan as the "terratrèmol de la candelera" because it took place during the Candlemas, struck the region of Catalonia, especially Roussillon, with an epicentre near Camprodon. The quake was one of a series of related seismic events that shook Catalonia in a single year. Beginning on 23 February 1427, tremors were felt in March, April, 15 May at Olot, June, and December. They caused relatively minor visible damage to property, notably to the monastery of Amer; but they probably caused severe weakening of building infrastructure. This would account for the massive and widespread destruction that accompanied the subsequent 1428 quake.
Modern estimates of the intensity are eight (damaging) or nine (destructive) on the Medvedev-Sponheuer-Karnik scale. The ramparts of Prats-de-Mollo-la-Preste were destroyed. The clocktower of Arles-sur-Tech collapsed. The monastery of Fontclara at Banyuls-dels-Aspres was devastated. The damage sustained by the monastery of Saint-Martin-du-Canigou marked the commencement of its decline. The belltower and Lantern tower of Sant Joan de les Abadesses fell down. The chapel at Núria was destroyed. The villages of Tortellà and Queralbs were entirely destroyed. Among the damaged structures were Santa Maria de Ripoll and Sant Llorenç prop Bagà. As far away as Perpignan and Barcelona the populace was gripped by panic. In the latter, the intensity was estimated at six (strong) or seven (very strong). The rose window of the Gothic church of Santa Maria del Mar was destroyed.
Robin de Molhet, lord of Peyrepertuse, who was travelling in his domains when the earthquake struck, quickly came to the aid of victims, which earned the recognition of Alfonso V of Aragon, who was away in Valencia at the time of the tremors. He was informed by the President of the Generalitat de Catalunya, Felip de Malla, in a letter. It is estimated that hundreds of people were killed in the disaster: two hundred are estimated at Camprodon, one to three hundred at Puigcerdà (due to the collapse of the church), twenty to thirty at Barcelona (in Santa Maria del Mar), and almost the entire population of Queralbs. The fallout lasted well over a year. The quake was probably the worst in the history of the Pyrenees, though the first recorded only occurred in 1373. It remains to this day a point of reference for the study of seismic risk.

Looking Back in Anger

Looking Back in Anger () was a 1989 Hong Kong TV series and one of the most watched TVB series by Chinese people in Hong Kong and around the world. Many factors contributed to the success of this series. As well as its tragic but memorable storyline, this series featured a strong cast, with Felix Wong, Deric Wan (who rose to fame with his role as the main antagonist), Carina Lau, Kathy Chow Hoi-Mei and Maggie Shiu. The popular theme song of the series "Yat sang ho kau" (一生何求) was sung by Danny Chan and later by Deric Wan himself.
Plot.
The series starts off with business tycoon, Sean Ding Yau Kin (Felix Wong), waiting for a telephone call. It then moves into a flashback to Kin's childhood years. 
1960s.
The young Kin (played by Gregory Lee) was born into a poor and struggling family. Kin's parents are always fighting over money because his father, Ding Wing Cheung (also played by Felix Wong) is addicted to gambling and has used up the family's savings, much to the displeasure of his wife, Mui Fan Fong (Yammie Nam.) However, despite Ding Wing Cheung's weak personality and lack of self-control, he is still a caring and loving father.
Desperate for money to spend for the New Year, Fong, an ex-thief, steals a man's purse. When she is caught by the police, it turns out that the purse belongs to a high-ranking official who was murdered shortly after the pickpocketing, and Fong is framed for the murder. Cheung, ashamed of his addiction, cuts off his fingers in front of the shocked Kin. Even though she is pregnant, Fong is forced through a humiliating trial, helped by retiring lawyer Martin Chu Siu-shan (Cheng Gwan Min) who defends her against the ruthless prosecutor, Henry Fung Sai Bong (Ngok Wah).
Fong nearly wins her freedom when suddenly an eye-witness, Mr. Szeto (Lok Ying Kwan), is put on the stand and accuses her of the murder. It turns out that Mr. Szeto had molested a deaf-mute student of his, and has lied about seeing Fong commit murder in order to get immunity. Fong loses the trial and is sentenced to death by hanging once her son, Ben Ding Yau Hong, is born.
Martin uses up all his resources to appeal her case, and finally moves Mr. Szeto into revoking his statement. Fong is rescued from the gallows by the warden just in time. The true murderer finally confesses to the crime to Martin before dying of cancer in the hospital. As the lawyer is the only witness to this statement, he has to refer the case to a colleague. Unfortunately the colleague is very distracted by his wife's affair with his brother, and ends up losing the appeal. Fong is dragged off to the gallows again, with the sympathetic warden waiting for another phone call to stop the execution, but it never comes. Before Fong dies, she makes Kin promise to always protect Hong.
Upon his wife's death, Cheung goes mad and tries to jump off a building with his children, and luckily is stopped by his childless ex-boss, Lee Ho Cheun (Wu Fung), who takes in the two children after Cheung is admitted to a mental asylum. His wife, Yip Sau Wan (So Hung Shuen) is ecstatic even though she already has two other adopted children, Chow Zhi Mun and Chan Siu Ling.
Cheun dies suddenly from a brain haemorrhage following a stroke, and the family is bankrupted. Gossipers tell Wan that it is all because of Hong, who is a jinx. Wan is shocked, but refuses to abandon Hong.
Taking her four children, Wan travels to Macau to seek help from her brother-in-law (Kong Ngai), who insults her and tells her to become a prostitute. She leaves angrily and works very hard menial jobs to support all four kids.
1980s.
Years later, Wan is working as a cleaner in a hospital with Nurse Lan, whose daughter is Chiu Kar Mun (Maggie Shiu).
The four children she had taken in are all grown up. Kin (Felix Wong) works multiple jobs over the years from a young age to help Wan support the family. Hong (Deric Wan) has just finished high school and is seeking a place at the law faculty of the University of Hong Kong. Chan Siu Ling (Hor Kar Lai) works as a bank teller, and Zhou Zhi Mun (Leung See Ho) is still in Form Six of high school.
After the years of hardship, Wan has grown cold, distant and very moody, leading to communication barriers with the children. Luckily, Kin is there as the glue to stick the family together.
Wan's brother-in-law has now fallen into hard times, and begs lowly for Wan to take in his daughter, Lee Wah (Kathy Chow). Wan forgives him and takes the nerdy, timid Wah in. Wah quickly gains a place in everyone's hearts.
Not content to live in cheap accommodations forever, Hong wants to apply for a law degree. Wan opposes this plan, believing that Hong should stick to his class and find a job like Kin. But Hong wants to prove his self-worth, and Kin supports him all the way, and he is accepted at the university. Hong may be ambitious, but he sees Wan's hardship and sacrifice, as well as her dislike of him, so he wants to prove to her that he will not be a liability and gain her praise. Kin works in the university cafeteria.
Once in university, Hong is immediately singled out as an outsider by his rich classmates (Frankie Lam and Evergreen Mak), as well as the snobbish Sam Fung (Ng Kai Ming), who Hong sucks up to in order to fit in.
Hong finds out that Sam's father is actually the ex-lawyer Fung Sai Bong, who has now turned to stock-trading and is immensely wealthy. Besides owning his own company, Bong is a director of Ngai Holdings, along with his elder son Michael. Casting old grudges and nervousness aside, Hong tries to get close to him to gain job opportunities. Bong takes an instant liking to the diligent Hong. This angers Kin, who hates the whole Fung family. Hong won't let go of this opportunity to work in Bong's company and quarrels with Kin. Hong moves out of the apartment, and into the university hostel.
Once exposed to the upper class, Hong becomes more and more obsessed with money and status, and manipulates Wah, who has a crush on him, to do all his projects while he is out socializing with the upper class. Hong later quarrels with Kin over Wah while the latter is driving, resulting in an accident in which Hong suffers permanent leg damage. He then sets his sights on pretty, intelligent medical student, Chiu Kar Mun (Maggie Shiu), who already has a doctor boyfriend, Lau Wai Gong, when she saves his life at the accident site. By using his jealous tendencies, Hong makes Dr. Lau go mad and claims Kar Mun as his own.
He finally fails his course once Wah realizes that he is a jerk and stops helping him, and he drops out, seeing a brighter future working under Bong. Kin and Hong quarrel over this issue.
Kin has always had a crush on Wah, but she only had eyes for Hong. Kin is approached by his best friend who works in a TV station, to appear on a TV show where the lives of three people with the same birthdates are compared. The other two are the mighty and wealthy heiress Ngai Chor Gwan (Carina Lau), and an arrogant fashion designer, Yeung Pak Kai (Gilbert Lam).
Mr. Yeung is an orphan. Similar to Gwan, his parents died at an early age. He worked hard, juggling his studies and work and was soon recognized as Asia's top fashion designer.
Gwan is the elder daughter of tycoon and Ngai Holdings chairman Ngai Kwan (Kwan Hoi San), who is Bong's business rival and elder cousin-in-law. Her mother died when Gwan was only six. Gwan has a younger stepbrother, general manager Francis Ngai Chun Kit (Canti Lau) who is highly intelligent, responsible, mature and has a flair for business. Tired of being constantly over-shadowed, Gwan does not even try to gain her father's approval. She becomes increasingly lazy and distant from her family, which causes her father to criticize her even more. She thinks Kwan doesn't love her at all, but in fact he does. She also keeps a close relationship with Kit, who helps her out a lot.
Gwan and Kin gradually become friends despite their large social differences, and Gwun secretly falls for Kin. However, Kin ends up with Wah, when she finally realizes the love he has for her. Kin supports Wah through her advertising course, and Gwun remains a friend to both, hiding her feelings inside. 
Depressed after Hong and Wah start going out, Gwan considers dating a rich man (Gallen Lo) and even agrees to his proposal, but chickens out at the last minute. Kwan is angered, and Gwan moves out and realizes that her past idol life was too boring. She starts becoming independent with the help of Kin. She finds a job as a magazine journalist, and is happy her with her boss(Michael Tao) who likes her.
Hong works under Fung Sai Bong's eldest son and general manager Michael Fung Yiu Kwok (Lee Shing Cheung). Bong, with the help of Michael, conducts a corporate raid on Ngai Holdings. Michael is not above using bribery to buy stocks off Ngai Holdings staff. Kit gains evidence of Michael's dirty dealings, in an attempt to stop the takeover of Ngai Holdings. He forces him to call the project off, threatening to expose his deeds. A nervous Michael attempts to sell off his own stock in Ngai Holdings, which displeases Bong, intent on taking over the company. Michael meets Kit to get some documents off him. Kit makes some snide remarks, and angers Michael who beats Kit up. Michael turns the steering wheel while Hong is driving out of the parking lot, and runs over Kit. At the advice of Bong, he and Hong remove the car's identification, and dispose of the car in the sea. Hong then returns home to Kin and tells him that he had run over a man. Hong uses Kin's love for him as well as his promise to his dying mother to always protect Hong, and manipulates him into taking the rap for Kit's death; though Hong genuinely feels sorry, and tries to make up for it by giving more money to Wan, who throws it in his face and kicks him out. Once Kin finds out it was Kit who was killed in the car accident, he falls out with Gwan, who fails to persuade him to let Hong take responsibility for his own actions.
Kin is sentenced to jail for two years, and in jail he forms a close friendship with several men. One is Lee Kar Ding and another is Hor Gwai Lum, each of whom has his own story to tell. Kwun, who has also been arrested for corruption charges, eventually meets Kin in jail, and his dislike for Kin gradually lessens and he learns to appreciate him. Even after reconciling with her father, Gwan still refuses to return to the family company, so her stepmother takes over.
Ling tries out for TVB acting classes, and gets promoted. Wan is very against this, but relents when she sees Ling's sincerity and interest. She is also persuaded by Kin's best friend, Fook, who loves Ling. She explains her concerns as stemming from the fact that Ling's biological mother was a famous actress and singer, who became someone's mistress and abandoned her child to marry rich in Thailand. Wan is worried that the pressures in the entertainment field will soon push Ling into following her mother's path.
All is well until Ling's biological mother, Fong Hung (Chan Lai See) returns to Hong Kong. Ling is disappointed to find her a manipulative and materialistic person, but soon understands the pressures that her teenage mother had to endure and forgives her. But it turns out that Hung is a heavy gambler, and owes loan sharks a lot of money. Under Hong's guidance, Ling becomes Michael's mistress to pay off her mother's continuing debts, ending her sweet-budding romance with Fook. Wan is enraged and disowns her.
Meanwhile, the youngest brother, Mun, finds his biological parents, who have become rich over the years, but his newfound siblings look down on him. To prove himself, he becomes Michael's personal assistant, a high-paying but humiliating job. Wan disowns him too.
Kin returns to a relieved Wan and happy Wah, who is finishing off her course. He is still working multiple jobs to make ends meet, and runs back into Gwan. They become friends again. Gwan still has a crush on Kin. Kin meets up with his friends from prison and start up a food stall which becomes very successful. Wah becomes jealous of Gwan's closeness with Kin.
Hong goes to Malaysia with Kar Mun. She uses her uncle, a Malaysian general (Chu Tit Wo), to force Hong into marriage. Desperate, Hong plans the perfect murder, and pushes Kar Mun off a moving train, framing her for committing suicide due to guilt over conceiving a child in an affair with another man, in a suicide note Hong made her write under the disguise of a letter written to a depressed friend. What he did not know was that Kar Mun had attempted suicide two days earlier, writing a suicide note, but did not have the courage to do so, and had put it in her sweater pocket when Hong interrupted her with a phone call.
Hong happily returns to propose to Cindy, and the two scale the corporate ladder, overtaking Michael's position in the company. This causes Michael to become increasingly abusive towards Ling and Mun.
Kin and Wah grow apart as her career grows more successful. Afraid that she might change, Wah proposes to Kin, but on the eve of the wedding, Kin discovers a letter by Wah to her friend saying that she only wants to marry Kin to repay him for his help, and also highlights other concerns for their future. Kin wants Wah to be happy, so he cancels the wedding. Wah goes off to Malaysia to work.
Ling gets pregnant and is dumped by Michael. She tries to commit suicide, but Gwan persuades her to live on. Supported by both mothers, she quits acting and opens a shop. Fook, who still loves Ling proposes to her repeatedly, and even wants to take her son as his own, but out of guilt and shame, she refuses. Mun meets a girlfriend (Carol Yeung). Building up his self-confidence and dignity, he quits his job and helps Kin out.
Kin and Gwan get drunk and sleep together, causing both of them to feel awkward afterwards. Gwun's boss tells Kin that Gwun has been in love with him for a long time. Moved, Kin chases after Gwun, who rejects him, feeling that he is only pursuing her out of obligation after sleeping with her. But eventually, he convinces her that his feelings are sincere, and they get together.
Kin and his friends move onto opening a restaurant, but his chefs bail out on him, so they have to resort to using Chinese steam-bowl to save the business which strangely, attracts a lot of customers. Gwun supports him all the way, and Kwun gradually accepts Kin. Kin and his friends become rich.
Cindy proves to be a good wife, as she successfully patches up the relationship between Hong and the rest of his family. Hong is moved by her actions, and his siblings all like her, but they still continue to hate her father and brother.
Meanwhile, Wan goes to Malaysia to visit the ailing Nurse Lan. She finds an alternate suicide note written by Kar Mun hidden in her clothes. This note outlines Hong's betrayal and his plan to marry Cindy. When Hong learns about the second suicide note, he rushes to Malaysia to get the note. Unfortunately, Wan has left the bag containing the note at Nurse Lan's house. Wan follows Hong into the woods, threatening to turn him in to the police. Hong admits his crime, but the latter cannot produce the note. Hong strangles Wan to death in a fit of rage. 
Kin gets a call from Nurse Lan and hears that Wan had left Malaysia that day, but realizes that she had yet to return. He rushes off to Malaysia with Wah to find Wan.
Based on eyewitness accounts from a taxi driver, a hotel receptionist and an Indian boy who identified Hong, Kin concludes that his brother had killed Wan. They later find her decomposing corpse, buried in the forest. Kin flies back to Hong Kong and sues Hong for the murders of Wan and Kar Mun. Cindy is horrified and upon close observation, she sees Hong's true colours. Since there is a law that an illiterate witness cannot confirm an English statement, the boy's testimony cannot be used to convict Hong of Wan's murder. However, he is found guilty of Kar Mun's murder. Due to lack of evidence he cannot be extradited back to Malaysia, but if he ever sets foot in Malaysia again, he will be executed. 
Mun confronts Hong in his office. In a fit of anger, he stabs Hong with a letter opener and holds him hostage. He is arrested and thrown into prison hospital, having sustained an injury.
Cindy requests a divorce from Hong, which is supported by her father, even though she finds herself pregnant. Hong desperately tries to get Cindy back, but she is not Chiu Kar Mun, and remains determined and strong-willed. Hong loses his position in the Fungs' company, and sets up his own with a friend. It folds after a few months, as he tries to use Kin's steam-bowl empire to help his own company, but ends up being cut out of the deal by Kin's friends. He also suffers major losses in the stock market. During this time, Hong continually extorts money from Cindy to feed his vices.
Cindy is very depressed and resorts to drinking. Hong uses her alcoholism to threaten to challenge her for custody of their son and blackmails her for millions of dollars. Just when Cindy aims to quit drinking, she dies from a heart attack, a congenital condition. As they are not properly divorced yet, Hong inherits all her money.
Wah eventually returns to Macau to pick up her parents, and meanwhile, tries to get Kin back. She sees Gwun as a third wheel and Kin as hers, but Kin asserts that he only loves Gwun. Wah leaves for Malaysia with her parents and Kin for the Middle East, but the plane crashes and she is the sole survivor of the crash, paralyzed from the waist down.
Wah uses her disability to cling to Kin. Kin feels guilty and tries to satisfy all her demands, giving Wah new hope that they can be together. Wah becomes increasingly possessive of Kin and hostile towards Gwan, who just wants to help. Kin does nothing to reassure her, and Gwan finally calls him on it, throwing their wedding invitations in his face.
Hong runs into troubles, and resorts to kidnapping his own child for ransom, who is in custody of Bong. But Bong uses permanent ink to mark the ransom money, and Hong's accomplice is caught. Hong escapes and goes into hiding. He tries to leave Hong Kong illegally by boat, going to Thailand, but he still needs money for the passage. Hong also realizes that he truly cares for his son, who is all that he has left in the world. 
One night, Hong attempts to get money off his siblings. Getting the money, he attempts to escape, and he and Kin fight at an empty elevator shaft. Hong falls and breaks his arm and legs, worsening his limp. He is placed in prison hospital.
Kin finally confronts Wah about his feelings. He confidently says that he only loves Gwan, and will only marry her. Wah gives him her blessing, and attends the wedding. But that night, she gets depressed and slits her wrists, bleeding to death.
Kin helps out Kwan in the company. After letting go of his hatred, he even helped out Bong, causing reconciliation between the Ngai, Ding and Fung families. Kwan is very happy.
1990s.
Years later, Kwan dies, and leaves his fortune and possessions to Kin and Gwan. The couple have a son, and a happy marriage.
While being chauffered in his car, Kin spots Hong being beaten up on the streets. He discovers that Hong has been secretly visiting his own son, and pities him. He gives him a lowly job at one of his restaurants, and otherwise ignores him, as Gwan still hates him for killing Kit.
Hong is enraged that Kin enjoys a happy life. Plotting revenge, he poisons Kin's family while he is out for dinner at the restaurant where he works, framing it on a mentally-unstable colleague. His plan is to murder them all, so that the family fortune would pass to the next blood relative, which would be him. 
Kin and Gwan both survive, but their young son, Wai, and six others don't make it. Kin finds electronic bugs in his study and phone and after talking to his lawyer, deduces that it was Hong behind the poisoning. He is deeply conflicted.
Kin offers Hong an executive position, much to the dislike of his partners, and they slowly plot against him, not knowing that this is all a ploy to trap Hong into thinking that he has Kin's absolute trust. Gwan is enraged because she doesn't know what is going on, but finds solace in volunteering for the local church. Meanwhile, Hong bonds with his son, Keung, and plans to challenge Bong for custody. He is happy when the kid calls him "Father."
Kin and Hong head for a business meeting in Australia on Wan's birth anniversary, but Kin deliberately traps Hong in an elevator, causing him to miss a direct flight. He has to settle for a non-direct flight - which stops over in Malaysia. Kin forces a scared Hong onto the plane, and after landing, Kin confronts Hong and Hong is arrested. Hong is sentenced to death for the murders of Wan and Kar Mun.
Hong repents in prison and begs Kin to bring his son to see him one last time before his execution. Michael has been diagnosed with terminal oesophageal cancer, and is suffering greatly. Kin has a conversation with a broken Bong about karma, and Bong lets Kin take Hong's son to see Hong after much persuasion.
Hong cries desperately upon seeing his son, who doesn't understand what is going on. Hong begs Kin to save him, but Kin tells him that it is time he stopped protecting him, and let him walk alone. Hong is disappointed but does not seem to have much hatred left. He is led to the gallows - just like his mother.
Gwan separates from Kin upon finding out that he did not consult her on such a serious matter. She wants a divorce, but Kin doesn't. She leaves for Ethiopia to do volunteer work. Kin says he will wait for her at the church where they got married, ten years later, on their shared birthday.
Fook approaches Kin again to do a ten-year reunion of the old show. Mr. Yeung has been bankrupted since but is a much more sensitive and caring person now, and Kin cries on air, begging Gwan to return.
The story comes out of the flashback, returning to the first scene where Kin is sitting by the telephone. Gwun calls him and tells him that she is coming home. But that day, both he and Mr. Yeung are involved in a crash. Ethiopia also has a serious earthquake and related landslides, killing hundreds. They have lost contact with Gwan. Mr. Yeung dies, but Kin survives. He still clings to the hope that Gwan is alive and will return to him.
Ten years later, there is still no news of Gwan. But Kin still has high hopes and is ecstatic when the tenth shared birthday comes. He gets ready to go down to the church. Man and wife are married, and after so many years of waiting, Fook finally gets a nod to his marriage proposal from Ling, with the help of her son who sees him as a father.
Kin happily waits in the church, getting more anxious as the clock ticks closer to midnight and his hope slowly dies. He waits past midnight, and eventually falls asleep on a pew.
A lady in red appears at the door. She approaches the sleeping Kin, touching his face lovingly. Her tears drop onto his face, and she leaves. Kin wakes up and finds a note saying Gwan has died. But he refuses to believe it and calls out for her to come back.
Ending.
Many people believe it was Kin's sister who came to drop off a note so he will move on with his life. 
Some sources say it is Gwan's ghost who came to visit him, assuming she had died from the landslides. The fact that she touched his face lovingly could imply she has forgiven him. 
Some sources also state that it was possible Gwan survived, but she was upset after the demise of Fei, and wanted to start life afresh.
Trivia.
Filming.
Principal filming was done in Hong Kong and China. Some episodes were filmed in Melaka and Kuala Lumpur (both in Malaysia).

Dell Studio

Dell's Studio brand is a range of laptops and desktops targeted at the mainstream consumer market. The computers sit above Dell's Inspiron and below the XPS consumer lines in price and specifications. They differ from Dell's lower-end Inspiron models by offering slot-loading optical drives, media keys, more cover design options, faster processor options, HDMI and eSATA ports, LED-backlit screens, and backlit keyboards. 
At launch, the Studio was offered in three models: the Studio 15 and the Studio 17 named after their respective screen size in inches, and the Studio Hybrid, named for its usage of laptop components in the form of an ultra small form factor desktop. If purchased online, many customizable colors, designs and features are available, including a finger print scanner in some countries. 
On July 29, 2008, Dell introduced the desktop counterpart to the Dell Studio Laptops, the Dell Studio Hybrid PC. A compact desktop legacy-free PC using laptop components, it contains the same slot-loading optical drive as the laptops with the range of connectivity (e.g., number of USB ports) expected of a desktop PC.
On September 24, 2009, Dell released Studio laptops with the options for a mobile Core i7 processor, although Pentium Dual-Core and Core 2 Duo options were still available as lower-end options.
At midnight on June 18, 2010 Dell's website stopped selling the Studio Hybrid.
As of May 2011, Dell has discontinued the Studio line of notebooks (XPS and desktops continue on).
Laptops.
Studio 14.
A 14" laptop.
Studio 14z.
A 14" laptop.
Intel Core 2 T9900 (3.06nbsp;GHz/1066nbsp;MHz FBS/6nbsp;MB cache)
Studio 15.
The Studio 15 is the mainstream of the Studio laptop line. It has had many options and features that have changed over the years. processors ranging from low end Pentium Dual Core processors up to Quad Core i7 processors. Newly added is the ATI Mobility Radeon 5470 1 GB graphics card. Here is a List of the Different models.
Studio 17.
A 17" laptop.
Studio XPS 13.
A 13.3" laptop that offers a Studio-XPS crossover. Runs on DDR3 memory and uses Intel Core 2 Duo processors. When launched, the Studio XPS 13 was widely acclaimed as the ultimate notebook, offering an irresistible combination of technology, cutting-edge design, performance and luxury style in the increasingly popular market for lighter notebooks. All of its attributes, and its wide success, made it all the more astonishing, if not suspicious, when Dell abruptly discontinued the Studio XPS 13 model, less than a year after its launch, leaving many would-be owners holding their credit cards, and many current owners on guard watching their prized possessions . The wait wasn't long. The latent technical problems, stemming from the notebook's relatively small shell packing a lot of sophisticated hardware, were numerous. Dell's designers simply attempted to pack too much punch into the 13 inch model. In the arena of the lightweight notebooks even one inch can make a difference and sacrifices must be made. Among the widely reported issues is the overheating in the area of the vent and the video card, whereby the heat spreads to the palm rests and the bottom of the screen. The more serious issue is with the slot loading optical drive. The device simply does not fit properly into the 13 inch shell. Yet as a result of the model's abrupt discontinuance, users who were in the market for a light-weight Studio XPS 13 model are left with few alternatives, if any. In fact, the only suitable replacement currently on the market is the Studio XPS 16.
Studio XPS 16.
A larger version of the Studio XPS 13 (16"). It offers an optional Blu-ray optical drive, and has an RGBLED 1080p full HD display (1920×1080) which was widely considered the best display on any laptop in the market and comes with a 1 GB Mobility Radeon HD 4670, and is now available with an Intel Core i7 processor or an optional 1 GB Mobility Radeon HD 5730.
Desktops.
Studio Hybrid.
A miniature desktop similar to the HP Pavilion Slimline series of desktops and Apple's Mac Mini. It is Dell's most energy-efficient desktop. The desktop is named Studio Hybrid because it uses Intel processors made for laptops while offering desktop features.
Studio and Studio Slim.
Using the same case style as Dell's Inspiron 530 and 530s desktops but with a black color, the Studio and Studio Slim desktops are targeted towards consumers looking for a multimedia entertainment desktop.
Studio XPS Desktop.
Combining the Studio's design with the XPS' performance, the Studio XPS desktop is a full-fledged multimedia center.
Studio One 1909 (Studio One 19).
Released in the USA on April 28, 2009, the Studio One 19 is a 19 inch all-in-one desktop computer. It is a lower-end alternative to Dell's XPS One 20 and 24. The chassis design highly resembles that of Dell's SX2210 21.5 in LCD monitor. The chassis can be customized with five different colors. There is also a touch-screen option.
Issues.
The Studio 15 (older 1535-1537 models) and 17 (1735-1737 models) suffer from problems with the touch sensitive controls where either the eject button or start button for Dell MediaDirect would stay lit for a few minutes after the unit was powered on rendering the rest of the buttons useless. However, a firmware update for this media panel posted on the Dell Community forums has been reported to fix this issue. Another solution for this issue is to power down the laptop and remove the battery, then holding the power button for thirty seconds to fully discharge all remaining electrical power in the system, draining any residual flea power.
Some users have reported graphical problems with the Studio 1555 and Studio 1557, later found to be a driver mishap. 
Other issues with these models include overheating due to the hard to maintain heatsink and fan design which is located in such a way that a general computer user is unable to access them for maintenance.
The 1557 and 1558 model are known to have problems with overheating, which is generally linked to 3D video graphics related gaming or other 3D applications. Downloading the latest ATI catalyst drivers and BIOS updates does help reduce the risk of these problems. 
The 1557 and the 1558 are affected by hard to maintain components which make it hard to clean out blocked heatsink vents or to clean and replace thermal paste due to the combination fan and heatsink design.
There are also several reports of 1557 models freezing up during booting, or having inaccessible hard drives. No clear cause or fix has been put forward by DELL, but it is also likely linked to overheating related to the built in video card, or software-hardware malfunction related to the built in ST Microelectronics Accelerometer which is supposed to protect the HDD in case the laptop is dropped. One proven method to avoid this problem is to remove the ST Microelectronics drivers, and thus disable the HDD protection function, whilst keeping the BIOS (currently version 9 as of Sept.2011) up to date is said to also reduce the risk.
They're are also complaints on the 17" laptops with keyboard and sound malfunctions as well.But they were improved recently by dell before they went out of business.

Hola/Chau

Hola/Chau (Spanish for Hello/Bye), released in 2001, are the thirteenth and fourteenth albums from the Argentine band Los Fabulosos Cadillacs. These, their second live album set, are twin concert albums recorded at the Estadio Obras Sanitarias in Argentina. The concert includes most of the band's hits as well as a reunion with some of the former members of the band.
In the concert, many of the songs differ for the original versions in length and sound: some of them are given an edgier sound, on others long instrumental passages are added (like "Piraña, Todos Los Argentinos Somos D.T.", which is given a two-minute percussion break) and some a more light, faster sound (such as "Vasos Vacíos", in which the audience and Vicentico alternate the part of Celia Cruz). Additionally, a few songs contain spoken sections by Vicentico, most memorably on "Basta de Llamarme Asi", in which he explains the song's history to the audience, and "Los Condenaditos", in which he delivers a closing speech asking for a social awakening.
Both albums were a huge commercial success earning golds in Mexico and Argentina. It would also embody a magnificent farewell for the band at the time. Nevertheless, the fans are left with the final words by Vicentico: "We'll see each other soon, very, very soon"
Reception.
Hola.
The Allmusic review by Victor W. Valdivia awarded the album 3 stars stating "Hola stakes the band's claim as one of the finest live acts anywhere. For one thing, the set list is superbly chosen. Rather than relying on the most recent album the band was touring to support the set list reaches all the way back to their first album and picks many classic tracks from all the albums in between"... Some tracks already were tailor-made for a live audience and are predictably superlative, but others reveal added power in concert. "Calaveras y Diablitos," already first-rate, becomes downright sublime when accompanied by an audience, while "Yo Quiero Morirme Aca," which sounded thin and tentative in its original studio version, becomes muscular and fierce on-stage. It's not quite the same as actually being there but Hola is one of los Fabulosos Cadillacs' most vital recordings.
Chau.
The Allmusic review by Victor W. Valdivia awarded the album 3 stars stating "The companion piece to the live album Hola, recorded at the same shows in Argentina, contains less-accessible material than Hola (although it does contain their most famous song, "Matador," which, predictably, sounds even more thunderous live)... The album works because the more thoughtful, reflective songs, like "Siguiendo La Luna," translate to the stage far better than could be imagined, especially when the audience sings along. "Vasos Vacios," especially, becomes downright sublime and "Salvador Y Los Cordones Flojos," hardly a standout on La Marcha de Golazo Solitario, reveals a new complexity and power. Chau may be a half-step below as accessible as its companion, Hola, but by no means is it forgettable, and fans and newcomers alike will definitely find a lot to like here. ".
DVD.
A special 2-DVDs set with full footage of the concerts was released in 2006.

Andiris Perera Dharmagunawardhana

Muhandiram Lansage Andiris Perera Dharmagunawardhana (19 November 1809 – 24 January 1890) was a Sri Lankan businessman, a philanthropist and a pioneer of the Buddhist revival movement. He was the grandfather of Anagarika Dharmapala.
He owned extensive land on the hill of Maligakanda, in present-day Maradana, Colombo, as well as two shops in Pettah, Colombo.
In 1860, he gave his daughter, Mallika, in marriage to Don Carolis Hewavitharana. As dowry, he gave his son-in-law one of his two shops. This become the renowned furniture shop, H Don Carolis & Sons.
He donated land and money to found, at Maligakanda in 1872, a Buddhist Seminary, the "Vidyodaya" Oriental College, better known as the "Vidyodaya Pirivena", which later became the basis for Vidyodaya University.
In 1880 the Buddhist Theosophical Society was founded, with Dharmagunawardena as its president, an office he held until his demise ten years later.
Until 1884, Buddhists were forced by the colonial authorities to convert to Christianity. This was changed after Colonel Henry Steel Olcott made representations to Secretary of State for the Colonies in London on behalf of the Buddhists of Sri Lanka.
The Buddhism Protection Committee (also known as the Colombo Committee) was formed in January 1884 under the patronage of Colonel Olcott, mainly with the objective of getting the Vesak full-moon day holiday restored. The British had not shown any interest in restoring the Vesak holiday which the Buddhists lost in 1770 during the Dutch rule. Dharmagunawardena was elected President - again a post he held until his demise - with Don Carolis as Vice President.In 1885 the Vesak holiday was restored and the committee elected a steering committee, to which Dharmagunawardena and his son-in-law were again elected, which went on to design the Buddhist flag.
About three thousand people attended his funeral, at which the customary funeral orations were made by Colonel Olcott and Ven. Gnanisara. His ashes are interred on the grounds (donated by him) of the Vidyodaya Pirivena at Maligakanda.

In the Clinton administration, he was an envoy to the Balkans. In the Spring of 1998, he met with Slobodan Milosevic and warned him about NATO's possible use of military force against Serbia. By May 1998, he suggested to the White House that they bomb Serbia, but the idea was originally rejected by NSA Sandy Berger.
Lobbying activities.
Gelbard is the founder and chairman of Washington Global Partners LLC, a lobbying and consulting outfit based in Washington, DC. In October 2011, the Economist reported that Gelbard lobbied to discredit the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala and its current director, Francisco Dall'Anese. Dall'Anese suggested that the lobbying campaign was funded by private sector opponents of the Commission's investigation of Guatemala's wealthy former interior minister, Carlos Vielmann, on charges of orchestrating extrajudicial killings. In February 2012, Gelbard joined the public policy and regulation practice at SNR Denton.
In response to the accusations concerning the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala, Gelbard wrote in The Economist "Based on two decades of experience in democratic institution-building, law enforcement and counter-narcotics, I have criticised the overall efforts of Francisco Dall'Anese, who heads CICIG, as being not aggressive enough compared with those of Carlos Castresana, his predecessor, and in light of the dire situation facing Guatemala."

Pedersen's law

Pedersen's law, named after the Danish linguist Holger Pedersen, is a law of accentuation in Balto-Slavic languages which states that the stress was retracted from stressed medial syllables in paradigms with mobile accent. 
It was originally proposed by Ferdinand de Saussure for Baltic to explain forms such as Lithuanian "dùkterį", "dùkteres" (cp. Ancient Greek "thugatéra", "thugatéres"), but was later generalized in 1933 to Balto-Slavic by Pedersen, who then assumed that accentual mobility spread from the consonant-stems to Balto-Slavic "eh₂"-stems and "o"-stems. 
The term "Pedersen's law" is also applied to later Common Slavic developments in which the stress retraction to prefixes/proclitics can be traced in mobile paradigms, such as Russian "ná vodu" 'onto the water', "né byl" 'was not', "pródal" 'sold', and "póvod" 'rein'.
Proto-Indo-European * 'daughter', with accusative singular * (Ancient Greek "thugátēr", acc. sg. "thugatéra") > Lithuanian "duktė̃", acc. sg. "dùkterį".
Proto-Indo-European *"poh₂imń̥" ~ *"poh₂imén" 'shepherd' (Ancient Greek "poimḗn", accusative singluar "poiména") > Lithuanian "piemuõ", acc. sg. "píemenį".
Proto-Indo-European *"gʰolHwéh₂" with Balto-Slavic semantics of 'head' > Lithuanian "galvà" (with accusative singular "gálvą"), Russian "golová" (acc. sg. "gólovu"), Chakavian "glāvȁ" (acc. sg. "glȃvu").
Within the relative chronology of Balto-Slavic sound changes, this law was, in its first occurrence in the Balto-Slavic period, posterior to the loss of Proto-Indo-European accentual mobility (i.e. later than the advent of Balto-Slavic mobile paradigms, such as the above-mentioned Lithuanian "duktė̃", as opposed to non-final stress in Ancient Greek etymons), so its application was originally limited to the inflection of polysyllabic consonant stems.
Later the retraction of stress spread by analogy to non-consonant stems in case-forms where Pedersen's law applied (commonly termed "barytonesis"). Thus we have accusative singular forms of Lithuanian "ãvį" 'sheep', "sū́nų" 'son', "diẽvą" 'god', "žiẽmą" 'winter'. Afterwards oxytonesis, Hirt's law, and Winter's law applied.

Tauranga Eastern Motorway

The Tauranga Eastern Motorway, now known as the Tauranga Eastern Link (TEL), is a motorway being constructed in the Bay of Plenty region in New Zealand that will replace a section of State Highway 2. It will cover 23 km from Te Maunga junction to Paengaroa, and will improve access from the east (Te Puke, Whakatane, Opotiki, Gisborne) and south from Rotorua and Taupo. It is the main route for trucks heading to the Port of Tauranga from Rotorua and the eastern Bay of Plenty, and connects the central plateau forestry industry with the port to facilitate lumber export.
Objectives.
Construction of the Tauranga Eastern Link officially started on 19 November 2010 and it is expected to open to traffic in 2016.
Tolling received significant community support (92% both conditional and unconditional) and as a result, NZTA submitted a tolling proposal to the Cabinet who approved it. The Order in Council will set out the parameters of the road tolling scheme, including all of the relevant conditions from which the NZTA would be eligible to toll the route – such as when tolling can start, toll tariffs, and how the scheme will operate.
Route.
Tauranga Eastern Link begins at Te Maunga (near Baypark Stadium) in Tauranga and follows its existing route to the Domain Road intersection with State Highway 2 at Papamoa. It then leaves the current state highway route and crosses rural land parallel to Tara Road, across Parton Road and along the sandhills to the Kaituna River at the end of Bell Road. At this point the highway crosses the river and carries on past the Kaituna Wildlife Management Reserve. It heads south east across dairy farms and orchard lots before rising up over the railway line to join the existing junction of State Highways 2 and 33 (the Rotorua and Whakatane highways) near Paengaroa.

<doc id="18296952" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18296952" title="Indian Reform Association">
Indian Reform Association

The Indian Reform Association was formed on 29 October 1870 with Keshub Chunder Sen as president. It represented the secular side of the Brahmo Samaj and included many who did not belong to the Brahmo Samaj. The objective was to put into practice some of the ideas Sen was exposed to during his visit to Great Britain.
David Kopf says that Sen was enthusiastic about the Unitarian social gospel, which he observed first hand during his trip abroad. He seemed convinced that the reform efforts he witnessed in Britain could be duplicated in India. The Indian Reform Association was formed to promote “the social and moral reformation of the natives of India.”
The comprehensive objective of the Association was to be served through five departments of activity – cheap literature, female improvement, education, temperance, and charity.
Cheap literature.
The object of cheap literature was to disseminate useful scientific information amongst the masses through cheap journals and the publication of cheap and useful tracts. On 16 November 1870, the Indian Reforms Association started publishing a weekly newspaper, "Sulava Samachar" in Bengali, priced only one pice. It was the first of its kind in India in the line of journalistic venture. Till then the humbler classes had never handled a newspaper and they were for the first time brought in contact with events that were taking place around them. Protap Chunder Mozoomdar noted, “The novelty and success of the newspaper stimulated repeated imitation.”
Female improvement.
Female normal school was started in February 1871under the auspices of the female improvement section for adult ladies who wanted to be taught or to learn how to teach. Subsequently, a girls’ school was attached wherein the adult students of the normal school could learn and practice the art of teaching. A carefully devised syllabus laid stress on womanly virtues and accomplishments.
"Bamabodhini Patrika" meant for women had been established earlier in 1864. The women of the normal school started the Bamahitaishiny Sabha (Society for the welfare of women.) for mutual improvement and discussions of matters of common interest. Once the Sabha started, its proceedings were reflected in "Bamabodhini Patrika". In the course of time the school was replaced by the Victoria Institution.
Education.
The third section dealing with education undertook to educate the labouring classes, and to instruct the middle classes in industrial arts. The Working Men’s Institution and the Industrial School were opened on 28 November 1870. In addition to education, the Institution provided healthy entertainment opportunities. The Industrial School gave instruction to the middle class in industrial arts, or rather practical training in such crafts as carpentry, tailoring, clock and watch repairing, printing, lithography and engraving. Brahmo missionaries, headed by Sen himself took to these occupations with workman-like avidity. The present Working Men’s Institution may well be regarded as the descendant of this Institution.
Temperance.
When Peary Charan Sarkar had first raised the standard of temperance, Sen had lent his support. Indeed, the subject was of long standing interest to him. Indian Reform Association published a monthly Bengali journal ‘’Mad na garal’’(Wine or Poison) under the editorial management of Sivanath Sastri. After the collapse of the Indian Reform Association, Sen had formed an organisation of youth called Band of Hope.
Charity.
The social activities of this group under Vijay Krishna Goswami, won universal admiration. They started off with medical assistance to those suffering from epidemic malaria.

Cilfynydd

Cilfynydd is a village in the county borough of Rhondda Cynon Taf, Wales a mile from the South Wales Valleys town of Pontypridd, and 13 miles north of the capital city Cardiff.
History.
Situated on the banks of the River Taff, the village was named after the farm that was situated on the east side of the valley, Cilfynydd Farm farmed by the Lloyd family most recently Gwun and Lewis now both deceased. Cilfynydd was originally a farming hamlet, consisting of some cottages built along the Glamorganshire Canal, surrounded by a few scattered farms. These properties, according to the 1881 census, housed about 100 people, but this all changed over the next two decades.
On 27 October 1913, Cilfynydd was to witness another destructive event. A cyclone swept through the village causing considerable damage and killing one of its inhabitants. In Richard Street, nearly all the shop fronts were blown in and the goods on sale scattered in the street. The corrugated iron roof of the Co-operation Stores was blown clean away and two roofs on houses in Park Place were stripped.
Albion Colliery.
The Albion Steam Coal Co. began sinking a coal mine in 1884 at Ynyscaedudwg Farm. The Albion Colliery opened in August 1887, served by the Llancaiach Branch line of the Taff Vale Railway.
Albion was the scene of the second worst disaster in the South Wales Coalfield, after the later disaster at the Universal Colliery at Senghenydd in 1913. At four o'clock on Saturday 23 June 1894, a massive explosion caused by the ignition of coal dust following an explosion of firedamp killed 290 men and boys. Of the 125 horses, only 2 survived. Many of the bodies brought to the surface were so badly mutilated that identification was virtually impossible, and there was several instances of corpses being carried to the wrong houses. Almost everyone in the community lost someone in the disaster, with one family in Howell Street lost 11 members: father, four sons, six lodgers were all killed.
Having been taken over in the 1930s by Powell Duffryn, before being nationalised by National Coal Board in 1947, when at that time there were 991 men employed. The mine closed in 1966, but with the tips threatening a disaster similar to Aberfan, a two-phased scheme to reduce the steep gradient of the spoil began in 1974, completed two years later.
The village.
The village was named after the farm that was situated on the east side of the valley, Cilfynydd Farm. The development of the village occurred around and as a result of the development of the Albion Colliery, to provide housing for the workforce.
Typically of the time, the houses were terraced, built along a parallel track to the Cardiff to Merthyr road. It is said that the original terrace streets in Cilfynydd were named after the sons and daughters of the developer: Howell Street, Ann Street, William Street, John Street, Richard Street and Mary Street.
The majority of Cilfynydd's housing and public buildings were built between 1884 and 1910, with this fast development necessary, as by 1891 the population had increased fivefold to over 500. The following decade witnessed an even greater rate of increase, as the 1901 census shows the population totalled 3,500 people. By this point, the village also had: four chapels, three public houses, a school, a church, a post office, and a workman's hall.
Transport.
Originally situated on a drover's trail along the route of the River Taff, it was on the natural route of the Glamorganshire Canal.
Due to the development of the Albion Colliery it became situated on the Llancaiach Branch of the Taff Vale Railway, with through passenger services until 1936 from Pontypridd to Nelson. It continued to receive less regular service until 1953, when the passenger route to Ynysybwl halt ceased.
The main road through Cilfynydd was once the main route between Cardiff and Merthyr Tydfil, before the building of the A470 road dual carriageway on the route of the Llancaiach Branch.
A tram service began on 6 March 1905, running from Cilfynydd through Pontypridd to Treforest. It was replaced on 18 September 1930 by trolleybuses, which today are replaced by buses which replicate an almost exact route.

Bogislaw I, Duke of Pomerania

Bogislaw I ( – 18 March 1187 in Sassnitz near Altwarp) of the House of Griffins was Duke of Pomerania-Stettin from 1156 to 1187. He ruled the Duchy of Pomerania jointly with his brother Casimir I of Pomerania-Demmin. His father was Wartislaw I. He was first married to Walburgis (d. 1177), daughter of Valdemar I of Denmark and later to Anastasia, daughter of Mieszko III of Poland and Eudoxia of Kiev. With his second wife, he had 5 children.
Bogislaw and his brother allied with Pribislav of Mecklenburg and supported his revolt against Henry the Lion, Duke of Saxony. They were defeated in the 1164 Battle of Verchen, but allowed to keep their duchy as a fief from Henry. As Henry's vassals, Bogislaw and his brother participated in the defeat of the Rani principality in 1168 led by allied Denmark.
In 1181, Barbarossa, who had overthrown Henry the Lion, granted Bogislaw his duchy (mentioned as "Slawia") as a fief.
In 1184, Bogislaw campaigned against Denmark's principality of Rügen on the Emperor's behalf. Yet, this failed, when the Pomeranian navy was sunk in the Bay of Greifswald. After several counterattacks, Bogislaw had to take his duchy as a fief from king Canute VI of Denmark in 1185.
In 1238 Pope Gregory IX wrote about Bogislaw "duce Cassubie" (Gerard Labuda, 2006).

Adam Bandt

Adam Paul Bandt (born 11 March 1972) is an Australian politician, former industrial lawyer and the Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens Party. Bandt was elected to the Division of Melbourne in the House of Representatives, the lower house of the Parliament of Australia, at the 2010 federal election. He is the second member of the Australian Greens to be elected to the House of Representatives, after Michael Organ, but the first to be elected at a general election. Bandt had previously contested the seat in 2007 and narrowly lost to Lindsay Tanner. Bandt retained the seat of Melbourne at the 2013 election with an increased primary vote.
Early life and education.
Adam Bandt was born in Adelaide, South Australia—a descendant of German immigrants who emigrated to the Hahndorf and Barossa Valley regions in the 1800s. As a child, his family moved to Perth, Western Australia where he attended high school and university, before moving to Melbourne.
At Murdoch University, Bandt was a student activist and member of the Left Alliance. At that time, he was quoted as calling the Greens a "bourgeois" party. He was president of the student union and an active campaigner for higher living allowances for students and free education. From 1987 to 1989, he was a member of the Labor Party.
Pre-political career.
Prior to his election to parliament, Bandt lived in Parkville and worked as an industrial, labor relations, and public interest lawyer, and was a partner at law firm Slater and Gordon. He had articles published on links between anti-terror legislation and labour laws and worked on issues facing outworkers in the textiles industry.
In 2008, Bandt completed a Ph.D. in law and politics from Monash University, with his thesis titled "Work to Rule: Rethinking Marx, Pashukanis and Law". In 2012, he described his thesis as looking "at the connection between globalisation and the trend of governments to take away peoples' rights by suspending the rule of law", saying he "reviewed authors who write about the connection between the economy and the law from across the political spectrum", ultimately arguing "that governments increasingly don't accept that people have inalienable rights". Bandt had his thesis suppressed for three years in the hopes of having it published as a book.
Political career.
2007 federal election.
Bandt was preselected to stand as the Greens candidate for the federal Division of Melbourne at the 2007 election against Labor's Lindsay Tanner, the then Shadow Minister for Finance. Bandt finished with 22.8 percent of the primary vote, an increase of 3.8 percent, and 45.3 percent of the two-candidate preferred vote after out-polling the Liberal party's Andrea Del Ciotto after preferences. Nationally he was the most successful candidate from any minor party contesting a House of Representatives seat.
2010 federal election.
Following the 2007 federal election Melbourne had become Australia's only Labor/Greens marginal seat. Bandt was preselected as Greens candidate for the second time, running against a new Labor candidate, Cath Bowtell, following the retirement of long-time member Tanner from Federal Parliament. At 8:22 pm on election night, 21 August, he declared victory for the Australian Greens. Bandt received a primary vote of 36.2 percent and a two-candidate preferred vote of 56 percent against Labor, a swing to him of 13.4 percent and 10.8 percent respectively. His main policy interests are environmental and human rights issues, having "nominatpushing for a price on carbon, the abolition of mandatory detention of asylum seekers and changing the law to recognise same-sex marriage as his top priorities in parliament."
2013 federal election.
In 2013 Bandt was re-elected in the seat of Melbourne, despite this time the Liberal Party directing preferences to Labor ahead of The Greens. Bandt received 42.6% of the first preferences and 55.2% of the two-candidate preferred votes.
Personal life.
Bandt's partner is former Labor staffer Claudia Perkins.

Jimmy Omonga

Jimmy Omonga is a singer and songwriter from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. With his debut album "Destin" (2008), he became within a few months one of Congo's new popular singers, known for his characteristic and unique voice; clear and ringing in its upper reaches, with soulful low notes.
Biography.
Omongo was born in Kinshasa. He began to perform when he was 14. A notable feature in Congo culture is it has blended its ethnic musical sources with Cuban rumba and merengue to give birth to soukous. Some of the music Omonga is a direct derivative, but blended with other African styles he picked up while touring in Angola and South Africa. 
On his arrival in South Africa in 1998, Omonga joined the Brothers Band (the later Afro Fiesta) as singer and percussionist with his long time friends Mermans Mosengo on bass, Papy (Felix Garemua) Lilawu joining as lead guitarist, Junior Kisangwa, drum, percussion & backing vocal and Christian Eboko on rhythm guitar, keyboards and backing vocal. The band soon became a draw card at various venues around Cape Town, including Mama Afrika, Chapman's Peak Hotel, Kennedy's Cigar Lounge, Africa Junction, Marco's African Restaurant .
Omonga sings mostly about love. He sings in many languages (French, English, Italian and Lingala).
The new millennium brought changes as Jimmy did his first European gigs as a singer-songwriter, no longer as Jibriel but Jimmy Omonga.
Omonga's big break in African popular music came when two of his songs were released at a Womex sampler-CD in 2007.
Before his debut album "Destin" was released in 2008 (UK distribution Harmonia Mundi) Omonga won the Music of the World Award in Amsterdam. The Award Ceremony was transmitted by UPC to the Amsterdam A1 channel and the Amsterdam TV Foundation Salto for providing a live-stream of the show, so the event was seen live in over 200 countries on New Years Day 2008. A record of over 57.000 votes were cast online by music fans from across the globe. MokumTV's Music of the World Awards unveiled Jimmy Omonga as the best of that year in Worldmusic.
In 2007, Omonga traveled to South Africa, where he, together with Junior Kisangwa, recorded his debut album "Destin".

List of illegal political parties in Turkey

Illegal political parties in Turkey lists those organisations founded in or carried out activities mainly targeted to Turkey that (a) consider themselves to be political parties as indicated in their self-assigned names, (b) are not or cannot be established under the laws of Republic of Turkey.
Some of these organisations have carried out terrorist activities and hence can also be classified as terrorist organisations. Indeed Turkish public authorities prefer either that denomination or that of illegal organisations ("yasadışı örgütler" in Turkish). However the term illegal political party ("yasadışı siyasal parti" or "yasadışı siyasi parti" in Turkish) is also used in official documents.
Active illegal parties.
According to Counter-Terrorism and Operations Department of Directorate General for Security (Turkish police) there are 12 active terrorist organisations in Turkey 11 of which are illegal political parties:

Francis Wichmans

Francis Wichmans (name in religion Augustine) (born at Antwerp, 1596; died 1661) was a Belgian Norbertine abbot. 
Life.
Having finished his classical studies, he received the white habit in the Norbertine Abbey of Tongerloo, Belgium, 21 September 1612. Ordained priest 4 March 1620, he was sent to the University of Louvain, where he graduated as bachelor of theology. 
Recalled to the abbey, he filled the offices of master of novices and circator. In 1630 he was made parish priest of Mierlo, and rural dean of Helmond. After the taking of 's-Hertogenbosch by the Dutch Protestants in 1629, Bishop Ophovius was obliged to leave his city, and resided at Geldrop, three miles from Mierlo. The bishop's "Diarium" shows that Ophovius conferred almost daily with Wichmans on the affairs of his diocese.
In 1632 Wichmans was transferred to the parish of Tilburg, in the same diocese, and was made rural dean of Hilvarenbeek. In 1634 the Retorsion laws were made, whereby Catholic priests were expelled, their churches confiscated and handed over to Protestant preachers. Wichmans then resided at Alphen, a village just outside the boundaries and six miles from Tilburg. From this place he administered his parish, always at the risk of his liberty and even his life. 
In 1642 Wichmans was elected coadjutor to Abbot Verbraken, whose successor he became in 1644. He was also named a member of the Permanent Committee of the States of Brabant. 
Wichmans promoted education in his abbey; in 1647 six of his religious graduated at Louvain, and a seventh in Rome. He erected or decorated several chapels in honour of the Blessed Virgin.
Works.
He wrote several books, including "Sabbatismus Marianus", "Brabantia Mariana", and "Syntagma Sacerdotale".

Mary Manross is the former Democratic mayor of Scottsdale, Arizona. First elected in June 2000, she served two terms and lost her candidacy for her third term as mayor in the November 2008 runoff mayoral election to her opponent, former Certified Public Accountant and businessman and former city councilman Jim Lane.
Prior to her election as mayor, Manross served four terms on the Scottsdale city council from 1992-2000. Although the election and office of the mayor of Scottsdale is nonpartisan, Manross' Democratic affiliation is widely known. However, perceived as having wide appeal—having been endorsed by both the Democratic governor Janet Napolitano and the Republican Senator John McCain, and the Scottsdale Area Chamber of Commerce as well as the Sierra Club—her party affiliation has not hurt her chances in the conservative, largely Republican city of Scottsdale.
Before her election as councilwoman, she had served on several city government commissions and in leadership positions for local charitable organizations, as well as being campaign manager for Mayor Herb Drinkwater's 1984 and 1988 mayoral campaigns. Manross is an alumna of the University of California at Los Angeles and Minot State University, and has a teaching credential.

Looseleaf service

A looseleaf service is a type of publication used in legal research which brings together both primary and secondary source materials on a specific field or topic in law. For this reason they are sometimes called "subject-matter services".
Looseleaf services are most commonly used for research in areas of law which change rapidly due to regulatory and administrative developments (such as tax law, environmental law, financial regulation, and labor law). Looseleaf services are typically contained in ring binders to keep them updated, because they are published fairly frequently (at minimum monthly, sometimes weekly or bi-weekly) in order to keep the information therein current. Most law libraries have a subscription to several of these services, and many of the more popular services are available electronically as well.
Types.
Interfiled.
In an interfiled looseleaf service, individual pages can be removed and replaced with more recent printings, eliminating the need for pocket parts or similar supplements. Most of the looseleaf services offered by Commerce Clearing House are of the interfiled type.
Newsletter-style.
Newsletter-type looseleaf services are published as topical newsletters, which are then filed by law librarians under the appropriate topic headings for future reference.
One of the best-known looseleaf services, "United States Law Week", is of this type. Most of the looseleaf services published by Bureau of National Affairs are newsletter-style.

David Nicholls (cricketer)

David Nicholls (8 December 1943 – 10 June 2008), was a cricketer who played for Kent during the 1960s and 1970s. He was born at East Dereham, Norfolk and died at Dartford, Kent.
Nicholls was a powerfully-built left-handed batsman, usually used as an opener, and a wicketkeeper. In both roles, he usually had to play second fiddle to Kent's established stars, being behind Peter Richardson, Brian Luckhurst, Mike Denness and Graham Johnson for most of his career as an opening batsman, and being deputy to Alan Knott as wicketkeeper. In an 18-season first-class cricket career, he played more than 200 matches for Kent, plus almost 100 List A games, but was a regular member of the side with a fixed place in the team for only a couple of years in the early 1970s. In one of those seasons, 1971, he completed exactly 1,000 first-class runs, the only time he passed this particular landmark.
Early career.
Nicholls made his first-class debut as a 16-year-old in 1960 but did not bat, bowl or keep wicket in his only game that season. He appeared next in 1962, playing nine first-class matches and making his first score of more than 50 – 76 against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge.
In 1963, the Kent side was in transition and captain Colin Cowdrey was injured for much of the season. Luckhurst and Denness took advantage of vacancies in the batting line-up to establish themselves in the side, but Nicholls was unable to do so: although he played in 16 first-class matches, he made only 684 runs at an average of just 25. He did, however, make the highest individual score of the whole English season, 211 against Derbyshire at Folkestone in 335 minutes.
Re-emergence.
That career did not go forward much over the next few seasons. Nicholls remained a fringe first-team player, with his batting average drooping below 20. From 1967, however, he began to act as deputy wicketkeeper to Knott, and with Knott increasingly selected as England's wicketkeeper, Nicholls played fairly regularly from 1968 through to 1976. Wisden noted in 1969 that "he would prove even more useful if he could recover his batting form". In 1969, batting improvement came, and Nicholls played in several games where Knott was also playing: he scored 743 runs and his average rose to 23. He was also awarded his county cap.
Kent's County Championship-winning season of 1970 was not a success for Nicholls, but in 1971, with Luckhurst joining Knott as an England regular and Cowdrey ill for much of the season, he established himself as a regular opener as well as deputising as wicketkeeper. Wisden noted: "He was not merely to be regarded as the deputy wicket-keeper... Nicholls emerged as a highly successful opening batsman, scoring his runs quickly and in entertaining fashion, well-deserving to reach 1,000 for the first time in his career. He met with equal success either opening with Luckhurst or, in that batsman's absence on Test duty, with Denness." He finally added a second century to the double he had scored in 1963, making 135 against Lancashire at Southport.
Later career.
Nicholls remained a regular player in the 1972 season, but he failed to make 1,000 runs and his highest score was just 60. Wisden noted in both 1973 and 1974, however, that Kent had almost an embarrassment of batting talent at its disposal, and between 1972 and 1977, with the exception of the 1975 season, Nicholls' batting average was in the low 20s. It meant that though he commanded a place when he was acting as Knott's deputy, his appearances as a batsman-only became less frequent. He continued to contribute useful runs, but did not score any more centuries. In 1977, the emergence of Paul Downton as a new Kent wicketkeeper brought the end of Nicholls' first-class career, though he continued to play second eleven matches until 1980 and also reappeared in a few one-day matches in the 1980 season.
<br>He then went on to work for the sports company Lillywhite Frowd based in Tonbridge, Kent.

Jah Woosh

Neville Beckford (1952 – 21 February 2011), better known as Jah Woosh, was a Jamaican reggae deejay and record producer, primarily known for his work in the 1970s.
Biography.
Born in Kingston, Jamaica, Beckford served an apprenticeship as a mechanic before forming a duo with Reggae George, Neville & George, and auditioning for Jamaica's top producers. Unsuccessful as a duo, they both went on to solo careers. Beckford became the resident deejay on Prince Lloyd's sound system, and was noticed by producer George Bell, who took him into the studio to record "Angela Davis", now under the pseudonym Jah Woosh. Although the single was not a hit, it prompted Rupie Edwards to produce the debut album, "Jah Woosh", released in 1974 on the United Kingdom Cactus label. "Chalice Blaze" and "Psalms of Wisdom" followed in 1976, these three albums establishing a reputation in the UK. A string of albums and singles followed through the 1970s and early 1980s.
Woosh also contributed to Adrian Sherwood's Singers & Players collective.
Beckford also worked as a producer, self-producing much of his work from 1976 onwards, and producing other artists such as Bim Sherman, Horace Andy, Larry Marshall, and his old friend Reggae George. He set up the "Original Music" record label, through which he has reissued some of his 1970s material.
He died on 21 February 2011, aged 58.

Ross Davidson (footballer born 1989)

Ross Davidson (born 6 September 1989) is an English football midfielder who plays for Northern Premier League side Nantwich Town.
A youth player at Port Vale, he was a professional at the club from 2008 to 2010. After two loan spells at Stafford Rangers and one at Nantwich Town, he signed permanently with Stafford in 2010. He soon switched clubs to Hednesford Town, before joining Kidsgrove Athletic in 2011. He switched to Leek Town in July 2012, and joined New Mills in December 2012. He moved on to Nantwich Town the following year.
Playing career.
Davidson, a product of the Port Vale youth team was handed his professional contract at the end of the 2007–08 season. By his second season he was a first team regular, he received his first sending off against Brentford for a 34th-minute slide challenge on Karleigh Osborne. He received a three match ban, but was supported by his teammates, parents and also a Vale supporting Priest who visited him in the locker room to give Davidson support. Assistant manager Ian Brightwell believed the challenge did not warrant a sending off and the club appealed the ban, to no avail. Despite being a regular in the first half of the season, he played just four games of the 2009 end. He considered leaving the game, but in June 2009 signed a new 12-month deal with the club.
He joined Conference North side Stafford Rangers on loan in August 2009. At the same time he was also transfer listed by Vale manager Micky Adams, along with five other youngsters. With his prospects at Vale Park limited, Rangers were keen to extend the loan deal, after Davidson was impressive in his first six games for the club. However he instead returned to Vale Park. In December that year he joined nearby Nantwich Town on loan, a team mid-table in the Northern Premier League Premier Division. In January the loan deal was extended by a further month. In March 2010 he was informed that he would not be offered a new contract by the "Valiants" at the end of the season, and immediately re-joined Stafford Rangers on loan until the expiry of their contracts.
Expected to join Rangers permanently in summer 2010, Davidson was hopeful of playing higher level football, but did however sign with Rangers. Before the end of the season he switched clubs to Hednesford Town of the Southern Football League Premier Division. Following defeat in the play-off final to Salisbury City and a second place finish in the 2010–11 season, Hednesford were moved to the Northern Premier League Premier Division.
In summer 2011 he joined Northern Premier League Division One South club Kidsgrove Athletic. The club finished in 13th place in 2011–12. He switched to Leek Town in July 2012, before leaving Harrison Park and moving on to New Mills in December 2012.
He joined Nantwich Town of the Northern Premier League Premier Division for the 2013–14 season.
Personal life.
Born in Burton upon Trent, Davidson attended Thomas Alleyne's High School. He grew up an Arsenal fan.

Sanitary Ordinance

The Sanitary Ordinance, also known as the Cubic Air Ordinance was a law passed in San Francisco, California on July 29, 1870. The purpose of the law was to prevent unsafe tenement conditions as the city grew. Under the law, boarding houses were required to have of air in a room for each occupant. The penalty for violating the ordinance was a fine of $10-$500, 5-90 days in jail, or both, imposed on both the landlord and the occupants.
Realizing this amounted to free room and board, many Chinese immigrants intentionally violated the conditions. After a housing raid on May 22, 1873, 45 people were arrested in a single day and the small local jails were filled to capacity. It was reported that some of those arrested were willing to pay the fine, but were ordered by leaders in Chinatown to accept jail time instead; the intent was to make the enforcement of the law more trouble than it was worth. Local Chinese leaders also noted that local authorities were breaking their own law since the small jails were filled to capacity, thereby violating the ordinance. This situation led to the Board of Supervisors' proposal of the Pigtail Ordinance.

Jaz Parks series

The Jaz Parks series is an urban fantasy collection of spy-fi novels by American author Jennifer Rardin. The series is set in a contemporary world in which mythological beings such as vampires and several less famous creatures are real, and follows the efforts of the Central Intelligence Agency to combat paranormal threats to national security.
The focus of the tale is CIA operative Jasmine "Jaz" Parks, who is regularly partnered with her boss, the enigmatic vampire Vayl. While on missions, Jaz and Vayl are tasked with stopping paranormal or mythological beings who've taken criminal roles in human society, or humans engaged in related activities.
The series is published through Orbit Books and was initially signed for three books, which was later extended to five and then eight. 
Characters.
Jaz Parks.
The series' wise-cracking protagonist, Jasmine Elaine Parks is a CIA assassin who is regularly assigned to paranormal cases. Having been born into a military family, she experienced frequent travel while growing up, which has made her something of a loner. Her mother was abusive and her father was away serving his country, and she was the main support of her twin brother Dave and little sister. Her extensive martial arts background includes training in kung fu, aikido, and taekwondo. In addition, she is a noted sharpshooter and possesses an ability to detect the presences of vampires, while also being highly resistant to several of their powers. She gains more powers as the books continue—she has something called an "Spirit Eye" which gives her more gifts as it opens further. She can leave her body as an astral projection, visit the heavenly and hell realms (during which she finds out her old fiance is an "Eldhayr", a form of angel) and sense the presences of all magical beings as well as sensing spells and their casters. Also, her powers are enhanced due to blood exchanges—with a werewolf called Trayton she gains the ability to call fire when angry. When Vayl takes her blood, her abilities are heightened exponentially, and gains new abilities.
During the course of the series she is forced to come to terms with a night when her fiancé, her brother's wife, and several of her teammates are killed in a vampire attack, after which she is inexplicably paired with Vayl and moved from vampire hunting to assassination. Though she and Vayl work well together, she is traumatized by that night and has several trust and relationship issues, not helped by Vayl's secrecy. It is slowly revealed that she is Vayl's "avhar" (a sort of partner chosen by fate, one for each vampire.) He gives her his ring, Cirilai, in order to protect his soul, and through the course of the novels they become closer, eventually falling in love and becoming lovers. However, due to their work there are several obstacles, particularly Vayl's extremely vicious ex-wife Liliana, and his only fledgling Disa. They also face several criminal and supernatural foes, including the CIA's most-wanted—Edward "The Raptor" Samos, a vampire of extreme power.
Vayl.
A vampire who was born in Romania in 1744, Vayl is now a CIA official who regularly serves as Jaz's field partner and direct superior. His record is so diverse and secure that only the president and head of Jaz's department is allowed to see it. His transformation came at the hands of his wife, Liliana, who reappears and is killed during the series' present-day story. She hates him, though desires his ring Cirali because of the power it will grant her—when Jaz receives it, she attempts to kill her. He is a generally guarded, enigmatic figure who harbors trauma relating to the past and his children, whose deaths he unwittingly caused. In a fit of grief, he attempted to summon a creature in order to take revenge on his children's killer, but his wife was turned into a vampire by the creature he summoned. She in turn turned him. After being told by a seer he would see his sons reincarnated, he became obsessed with finding them, though this desire has lessened as he and Jaz have gotten closer. He is also shown to share Jaz's sense of humor at times, though he rarely smiles. Like Parks, Vayl is highly adept at his job and is considered one of the agency's top operatives. At the beginning of his and Jaz working relationship he was distant and formal, but eventually reveals he is her "sverhamin" and they are bound together. To protect his soul he gives her Cirilai, which was forged by his family when his mother saw he would lose his soul. He is fiercely protective of Jaz and eventually the two fall in love. Though he appears around 35, he is over 250 years old and is described as dangerously attractive. He is also one of only two vampires to escape from a "vampere" household alive and has fathered one fledgling. Due to his extreme age, he often uses outmoded phrases and words, and he is terrified of snakes and sleeping in coffins.
He has a degree of magical ability, though he rarely uses it, preferring to rely on his swordsmanship and vampire abilities. He can move faster, is stronger, and has better reflexes and senses than any human. Through blood consumption of the target he can read their motives and emotions, and so he always does this on the job to prevent him from killing an innocent. His eyes change color depending on his emotions, e.g. emerald green for desire, black for extreme anger (but only Jaz is able to tell). Due to an attempt by his fledgling, Disa, to get him to return to his vampire house, he no longer sleeps through the entire day, instead waking up a couple of hours before sunset and being unable to fall asleep until a couple of hours after sunrise. He is also the only vampire to have two "cantrantias" or core powers. His original one is called wraith, the ability to manipulate how cold the temperature is. This works on an atmospheric and local scale, though the bigger the area the more it tires him. After taking Jaz's blood, which also temporarily increases all his powers, he has the ability, through blood, to absorb and use permanently the "cantrantia" of another vampire, making him, potentially, the most powerful vampire in the world.
Book releases.
Installments have typically been released during the same month in the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States, with the US and Canadian releases being simultaneous.
Reception.
Critical reception for the series has been positive, with RT Book Reviews praising most of the series. "Publishers Weekly" called "Once Bitten, Twice Shy" an "entertaining but derivative debut," going on to say that "Jaz's jittery narration amuses, but the fang-filled plot, replete with action licks and paranormal theatrics, will have trouble standing out in this overcrowded field."

David Townsend (musician)

David Edward Townsend (May 17, 1955 - October 26, 2005) was an American musician best known as the guitarist for the R&B band Surface, and the son of singer/songwriter Ed Townsend.
Biography.
Early years.
Townsend was born in Inglewood, California, the son of Ed Townsend, a singer/songwriter famous for the song "For Your Love and the co-writer and producer of "Let's Get It On" with Marvin Gaye in 1972. The younger Townsend showed an interest in music from an early age and soon learned to play an array of instruments, including the guitar, piano and synthesiser.
Early career.
Grew up in Englewood, New Jersey. After graduating from college in the mid-1970s, Townsend joined The Isley Brothers' backing band Sunrize, produced by the Isley Brothers 1982, as guitarist, before forming a group called Port Authority with David Conley, another singer and musician. They found another member in Bernard Jackson and formed a songwriting partnership, which led to them becoming staff writers at EMI.
After having written songs for New Edition ("Let's Be Friends"), Gwen Guthrie and Sister Sledge ("You're So Fine"), the group decided to record some of their own material. They chose the name Surface and released "Falling in Love" and "When Your 'Ex' Wants You Back" on the disco label Salsoul Records.
Peak success (1989-1991).
Although Surface achieved some club success, Townsend felt the band could have gone a lot further on a larger label. In 1985, he went to Mississippi to visit his father, who was building a recording studio there. (Ed) Townsend pulled some strings to get Surface a contract with Columbia. They convinced the label to let them continue recording at The Lab, the 24-track studio they had built in Conley's living room in New Jersey.
Surface's first single on Columbia, "Let's Try Again", was a small hit, however, "Happy" reached #2 on the US R&B charts and #20 on the US Pop charts in 1987, and the group's debut album sold well. Their 1989 follow-up album, "2nd Wave" saw the band become staples of the quiet storm urban radio format with the success of the single "Closer Than Friends", which reached #1 on the R&B charts on March 18, 1989 and was there for two weeks, and "Shower Me With Your Love," a Jackson written song, reached #1 on the R&B Charts on July 29, which crossed over to the US Pop charts. Their next single, "You Are My Everything", featured Regina Belle as a guest vocalist and on November 4, 1989, took over the top of the R&B charts, replacing her single "Baby Come to Me," it also crossed over onto the British charts.
Townsend had a song that he co-wrote with David Conley reach #1 on the US R&B charts. "Don't Take It Personal" by Jermaine Jackson, reached #1 on November 18, 1989, replacing "You Are My Everything" by Surface.
In 1991, Surface released the album "3 Deep" which included the singles "Can We Spend Some Time", "All I Want Is You", "Never Gonna Let You Down" and "The First Time", which topped the US pop charts. "The First Time" reached #1 on the US R&B charts on January 19, 1991 and became the groups biggest hit.
However, Townsend and Conley decided to concentrate on songwriting and producing and helped Aretha Franklin record the album "What You See Is What You Sweat" in 1991, while Jackson went solo.
Later years.
The group disbanded in 1994 after Townsend and Jackson left the group. However, in 1999, the band reunited and released their final studio album "Love Zone". Plans were being made for a reunion tour, however those plans where cancelled when Townsend was found dead in his home in Northridge, California.

Christchurch Southern Motorway

The Christchurch Southern Motorway is a motorway to the south-west of Christchurch, New Zealand linking the inner-city suburb of Addington, New Zealand to the southern Christchurch suburb of Hornby, New Zealand. The motorway is approximately 7.5km long and is four-lane divided. The motorway forms part of State Highway 76.
Route.
The Christchurch Southern Motorway begins in the suburb of Addington at the western end of Brougham Street (at the Collins Street intersection), just south of the Christchurch CBD. It heads south-west, crossing Barrington Street (where there is an interchange) and Lincoln Road and passing to the south of Middleton. There is an interchange at Curletts Road, then the motorway heads through Wigram, passing under Aidanfield Drive and Awatea Road. The motorway ends at Halswell Junction Road to the south of Hornby.
History.
Plans for a motorway network in Christchurch were first revealed in 1962, with the release of the Christchurch Master Transportation Plan. The Christchurch Southern Motorway, which formed a critical component of this plan, was proposed to run from Templeton to an interchange with the Christchurch Northern Motorway at Waltham, just south of the CBD. These plans were scaled back in 1975 so that the Southern Motorway would terminate into the western end of Brougham Street. The first section of the motorway, a short two-lane arterial, opened in 1981, linking Brougham Street with Curletts Road. Further motorway work was subsequently deferred due to slowing population and economic growth and a lack of funding.
Beginning in March 2010, the section between the Lincoln Road overbridge and Curletts Road was duplicated, and a new flyover was built linking the motorway directly to Brougham Street, creating a grade-separated junction with Barrington Street. The motorway was also extended from Curletts Road, where a new full interchange was built, to a new terminating roundabout at Halswell Junction Road, near the (upgraded) Springs Rd roundabout. A cycleway was built along the length of the motorway on both sides. The duplication and extension were officially opened on 14 December 2012. North of Springs Road, Halswell Junction Road was upgraded to form a two-lane undivided link from the motorway to State Highway 1 at Islington. This includes replacing the roundabout at Shands Road with traffic lights.
Despite being affected by the 2010 and 2011 Canterbury earthquakes while under construction, the earthquakes caused no direct damage, although the alignment had to be resurveyed after each earthquake.

Northern School of Music

The Northern School of Music (NSM) started life (1920) as Manchester's branch of the Matthay School of Music. In 1943 it was properly incorporated as the Northern School of Music. In its later years it was accommodated in a building on Oxford Road (near Sidney Street), which later became the site of the students' union of Manchester Polytechnic.
For most of the early years of its existence it focused on training music teachers but gradually performance came to play an increasing role. This was thanks to Ida Carroll.
In 1955 Hilda Collens, the School's founder and principal met the principal of the Royal Manchester College of Music, Frederic Cox, and talks about merging the schools were held. These talks were to last many years and finally in 1972 led to the establishment of the Royal Northern College of Music.

17th Infantry Battalion

17th Infantry (Do or Die) Battalion currently located at Brgy Masin, Alcala, Cagayan is operationally controlled by the 501st Brigade of the 5th Infantry (Star) Division and presently covering the whole province of Cagayan and north Apayao as its area of operation.
History.
The 17th Infantry Battalion traces its roots on the 6th Infantry Battalion (Provisional) placed under the direct control and supervision of HPP as strike/reaction force of Greater Manila Area, commanded then by LTC Restituto C Padilla. The unit was renamed "17IB" when it was formerly activated on October 16, 1972 pursuant to General Orders Number 173, GHQ, AFP with all of the personnel and equipment of 6IB (Provisional) remained intact within the newly activated unit. The burden of organization, orientation, equipage and deployment fell on the leadership of then LTC Edon Y Yap who take charged of completing the battalion equipment and uplifted capabilities when it was fielded in Central Luzon. After a year in Central Luzon the unit was ordered to be shifted to Southern Philippines specifically in Lanao area where one of its companies, Charlie Company, was airlifted ahead of the battalion as advance group. Due to sudden changed of tactical events and consideration the order was rescinded and the advance group was recalled after two (2) months.
When the command of 17IB was passed to LTC Mateo V Bawagan, the unit’s administrative, operational and other related activities were accelerated to its highest peak which earned him adjudged as “The Most Outstanding Battalion Commander of Calendar Year 1974”.
From 1979 to 1981, another battalion commander of significance is the late LTC Adelino V. Magday who was also adjudged as "The Most Outstanding Battalion Commander of Calendar 1980(?)." Its new AOR covers the tri-boundaries of Pampanga, Zambales and the Peninsula of Bataan. The Battalion Command Post was initially established at Sta Lucia, Capaz, Tarlac but was later transferred to St Roosevelt at Dinalupihan, Bataan on 12 October 1977. Under his tenure, 17 MIB (Mechanize Infantry Battalion) won the award "Best Battalion" for two consecutive years. Soon after his unexpected demise on the election day of 1981 due to an ambush, in recognition to his outstanding performance, the camp in Lallo, Cagayan was later "unofficially" named after him.
The year 1987 proved to be fruitful to 17IB when under Maj Peter H Espadero, the unit was adjudged by the NOLCOM as the “Best Battalion CY 88-89 which was added to the shining laurels of glory and fame reaped by the unit. 
Under the leadership of Maj Cesar P Tiongson the unit moved to the province of Ifugao occupying Northbyeastern Cagayan, Calanasan, Conner and Kabugao of Kalinga-Apayao . During the stint in the area, numerous major and minor operations were conducted which resulted for the unit to be adjudged as the 5ID, PA and NOLCOM Best Infantry Battalion for the year 1992. 
Few months later, the unit AOR was expanded and covered the municipalities of Rizal, Sto Nino and Lasam, all of Cagayan with one hundred thirty two (132) barangays in addition to its previous area of operation. While conducting operation in the area, on 29 August 1994, the unit was able to recover fifty-seven (57) High powered firearms from the enemy at Sitio Ilaw, Brgy Poguin, Conner, Kalinga-Apayao. The untiring efforts of the unit paid-off as it dealt serious decimation and reduction among CPP/NPA/NDF rank and file in the area, which resulted to the destruction of the communist self-imposed image of invincibility and fluidity. Because of its numerous accomplishments, the unit earned the Presidential Streamer for the year 1994.
On the later part of 1994, the 17IB was again given its new AOR in Isabela Province. On 29 October 1994, the unit left Kalinga-Apayao and established its new Battalion Headquarters at Brgy Morado, Ilagan, Isabela. The commitment of the unit was continued with the efficient application of the TRIAD Concept under the leadership of Maj Delos Reyes. The unit spearheaded the first ever SRA-CIVAC in Gamu, Isabela held on 19–21 July 1997 which was the basis for the subsequent Philippine Army Program which was later dubbed as the Community Assistance for Rural Empowerment through Social Services (CARES) Program. 
Under the able leadership of LTC Rufinito Y Cordova, the unit was able to produce the most number of awardees in the field of combat. Most glaring of which are the eight (8) personnel awarded with Gold Cross Medal for gallantry in action by then Lt Gen Raul S Urgello, the Commanding General of the Philippine Army, in two (2) separate and distinct occasions. These laudable performances have paved the way in the unit realization of another award, Best Battalion for Operation, 3rd Quarter calendar year 1998.

Kwadrofonik

Kwadrofonik is a Polish band. The unusual combination of percussionists and pianists is the only such quartet in Poland and one of a few in the world.
Founded in 2006, they perform compositions from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Their music is inspired by composers like Bartok, George Crumb and Luciano Berio.
Through improvisation and musical dialogues they make maximum use of the possibilities offered by two pianos and percussion. The instruments exchange functions almost
imperceptibly – the pianos become percussion instruments, while percussion instruments become the melodic ones.
For the arrangement of folk songs performed at the ninth Folk Music Festival Nowa Tradycja (New Tradition) in 2006, the musicians were awarded the Grand Prix, an Award from the President of Warsaw and also one from the public – "Burza Braw" (Burst of Applause).

Herbert S. Okun

Herbert Stuart Okun (November 27, 1930 – November 8, 2011) was a United States Ambassador to East Germany (1980–1983) and the Deputy U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations (1985–1989). He was a member of the American Academy of Diplomacy, and after his retirement from the State Department he played a key role in unsuccessful efforts to halt the Balkan wars in the early 1990s. 
Born in Brooklyn, Okun earned his A.B. in history from Stanford University in 1951, and his Master of Public Administration from Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government in 1959. His father, a Jewish immigrant from Minsk, became a wholesale vegetable vendor in New York.
Okun decided to become a diplomat at 16 after reading 1947 Foreign Affairs article in which scholar George F. Kennan (writing under the pseudonym "X") offered a strategy for Western resistance to Soviet expansionism. The policy was known as "containment" and served as the intellectual blueprint for American foreign policy during the Cold War. "I read it and said, 'That's what I want to do,'" Okun told the New York Times in 1993.
As a young foreign service officer, Okun translated the correspondence between President John F. Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Okun recalled that Khrushchev nicknamed him "ryzhyi" — redhead — because of his hair color.
Okun also was the chief State Department negotiator for the SALT Treaty. While at the United Nations, Okun led a walkout of the U.S. delegation during a speech by Iranian President Ali Khamenei. "The false accusations that he made against our country distort the facts and totally misrepresent our policy," Okun told reporters. "I do not intend to sit by passively when our country is insulted, our President is pilloried and the truth is trampled."
After retiring from the foreign service, he served as chief aide to former Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and former British Foreign Secretary Lord David Owen in the talks to end the slaughter resulting from the break-up of Yugoslavia. Okun was "extraordinarily ready to listen to and to give credit to the opposing views," recalled Owen. "He was a person who did manage to build a measure of trust from the Serbians, which is not easy to do."
Okun testified against Serbian leader Slobodan Milošević at the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague. In an interview, Okun recalled: "Observing how he talked and acted I could not come to any other conclusion than Milošević being a common gangster. You know, those types from Mafia movies with cigars in their mouths, who try to express themselves very theatrically but in reality are selling fog."
While serving as Vance and Okun's aide, Okun warned Serb leader Radovan Karadžić before the fighting started: "If you continue to talk about the mortal danger that Serbs are under in Bosnia, you will end up committing preemptive genocide." Karadžić later was charged with war crimes in the 1995 massacre at Srebrenica, where as many as 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed, and Okun also testified against him in The Hague.
"Diplomacy without force is like baseball without a bat," Okun famously said.

Pipedo

Pipedo is a Japanese word referring to molecular biological researchers such as graduate students and postdocs who work hard in universities or other research institutions for low or sometimes no pay.
Origin.
The word, "pipedo", is a compound word that can be divided into "pipe" and "do". "Pipe" comes from the pipette, which is a piece of apparatus widely used in molecular biological research. "Do" is the short form of "dorei", which means the slave in Japanese. 
Background.
Since the early 1990s, Japanese government has encouraged universities to shift from undergraduate school-oriented systems to more graduate school-oriented ones. Top universities in Japan have extended enrolments of graduate students in response to this policy. According to a survey, the number of PhDs awarded annually jumped from 8,968 in 1996 to 15,966 in 2004. Despite the increasing numbers of graduate students and doctors, universities have not provided enough tenured positions for them. Instead, they increased postdoc positions, which are not permanent jobs, to deal with the excessive numbers of doctors within tight budgets.
The problem is severe especially in molecular biology. The advances of molecular biology in the past few decades drew many high school students into the field. However, the demand for students who majored in biology is quite low in Japan, which depends on automobile and other electronics industries.

Rhythmical office

In the liturgy of the Roman Catholic Church, a rhythmical office is a section of or a whole religious service, in which not only the hymns are regulated by a certain rhythm, but where, with the exception of the psalms and lessons, practically all the other parts show metre, rhythm, or rhyme. They are also known as versified office or, if appropriate, rhymed office.
The usual examples are liturgical horary prayer, the canonical hours of the priest, or an office of the "Breviary". The rhythmical parts will be, for instance: the antiphons to each psalm; to the Magnificat, Invitatorium, and Benedictus; likewise the responses and versicles to the prayers, and after each of the nine lessons; quite often also the benedictions before the lessons; and the antiphons to the minor Horœ (Prime, Terce, Sext, and None).
Terminology.
The old technical term for such an office was Historia, with or without an additional "rhytmata" or "rimata", an expression that frequently caused misunderstanding on the part of later writers. The reason for the name lay in the fact that originally the antiphons or the responses, and sometimes the two together, served to amplify or comment upon the history of a saint, of which there was a brief sketch in the readings of the second nocturn. 
Gradually this name was transferred to offices in which no word was said about a "history", and thus we find the expression "Historia ss. Trinitatis". The structure of the ordinary office of the Breviary in which antiphons, psalms, hymns, lessons, and responses followed one another in fixed order, was the natural form for the rhythmical office. It was not a question of inventing something new, as with the hymns, sequences, or other kinds of poetry, but of creating a text in poetic form in the place of a text in prose form, where the scheme existed, definitely arranged in all its parts. A development that could eventually be a basis for division of the rhythmical offices into distinct classes is limited to a narrow field, namely the external form of the parts of the office as they appear in poetic garb. Here we find in historical order the following characters:
Consequently one may distinguish three classes of rhythmical offices:
The second class represents a state of transition, wherefore the groups may be called those of the first epoch, the groups of the transition period, and those of the third epoch, in the same way as with the sequences, although with the latter the characteristic difference is much more pronounced. If one desires a general name for all three groups, the expression "Rhymed Office", as suggested by "Historia rimata"" would be quite appropriate for the pars major et potior, which includes the best and most artistic offices; this designation: "gereimtes Officium" (Reimofficium) has been adopted in Germany through the "Analecta Hymnica". Reslly, though, the first and oldest offices are without rhyme, and cannot very well be called rhymed offices. 
In the Middle Ages the word "rhythmical" was used as the general term for any kind of poetry to be distinguished from prose, no matter whether there was regular rhythm in those poems or not. And for that reason it is practical to comprise in the name "rhythmical offices" all those other than pure prose, a designation that corresponds to the "Historia rhytmata".
Apart from the predilection of the Middle Ages for the poetic form, the Vitœ metricœ of the saints were the point of departure and motive for the rhythmical offices. Those Vitœ were frequently composed in hexameters or distichs. From them various couples of hexameters or a distich were taken to be used as antiphon or response respectively. In case the hexameters of the Vitœ metricœ did not prove suitable enough, the lacking parts of the office were supplemented by simple prose or by means of verses in rhymed prose, i. e., by text lines of different length in which there was very little of rhythm, but simply assonance. Such offices are often a motley mixture of hexameters, rhythmical stanzas, stanzas in pure prose, and again in rhymed prose.
Examples.
An example of an old metrical office, intermixed with Prose Responses, is that of St. Lambert (Anal. Hymn., XXVII, no. 79), where all the antiphons are borrowed from that saint's Vitœ metricœ, presumably the work of Hucbald of St. Amand; the office itself was composed by Bishop Stephen of Liège about the end of the ninth century:
A mixing of hexameters, of rhythmical stanzas, and of stanzas formed by unequal lines in rhymed prose is shown in the old Office of Rictrudis, composed by Hucbald about 907 (Anal. Hymn., XIII, no. 87). By the side of regular hexameters, as in the Invitatorium:
we find rhythmical stanzas, like the first antiphon to Lauds:
or stanzas in very free rhythm, as e. g., the second response to the first nocturn:
From the metrical offices, from the pure as well as from those mixed with rhymed prose, the transition was soon made to such as consisted of rhymed prose merely. An example of this kind is in the Offices of Ulrich, composed by Abbot Berno of Reichenau (d. 1048); the antiphon to the Magnificat of the first Vespers begins thus:
Much more perfectly developed on the other hand, is the rhythm in the Office, which Leo IX composed in honour of Gregory the Great (Anal. Hymn., V, no. 64). This office, the work of a pope, appeared in the eleventh century in the Roman breviaries, and soon enjoyed widespread circulation; all its verses are iambic dimeters, but the rhythm does not as yet coincide with the natural accent of the word, and many a verse has a syllable in excess or a syllable wanting. For example, the first antiphon of the first nocturn:
This transitional author does not make use of pure rhyme, only of assonance, the precursor of rhyme. 
A prominent example is the Office of the Trinity by Archbishop Pecham of Canterbury.
The first Vespers begins with the antiphons:
Compare with the preceding the antiphons to the first nocturn, which have quite a different structure; the third of them is:
Again, the first response to the third nocturn:
upon which follows as second response the picture of the Trinity in the following form:
History.
It is unclear which of the three old abbeys, Prüm Abbey, Landévennec Abbey or Saint-Amand Abbey, can claim priority in composing a rhythmical office. There is no doubt however from Saint-Amand and the monasteries in Hainault, Flanders, and Brabant, came the real starting-point of this style of poetry, as long ago as the ninth century. A pioneer in music, the Monk Hucbald of Saint-Amand, composed at least two, probably four, rhythmical offices; and the larger number of the older offices were used liturgically in those monasteries and cities with a connexion with Saint-Amand. From there this new branch of hymnody very soon found its way to France, and was developed in the tenth and eleventh, and particularly in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. 
Poets involved are: 
Julian von Speyer was director of the orchestra at the Frankish royal court, afterwards Franciscan friar and choir master in the Paris convent, where about 1240 he composed words and music for the two well-known offices in honour of Francis of Assisi and of Anthony of Padua (Anal. Hymn., V, nos. 61 and 42). These two productions served as a prototype for a good number of successive offices in honour of saints of the Franciscan Order as well as of others. In Germany the rhymed offices were just as popular as in France. As early as in the ninth century an office, in honour of St. Chrysantus and Daria, had its origin probably in Prüm, perhaps through Friar Wandalbert (Anal. Hymn, XXV, no. 73); perhaps not much later through Abbot Gurdestin of Landévennec a similar poem in honour of St. Winwalœus (Anal. Hymn., XVIII, no. 100). As hailing from Germany two other composers of rhythmical offices in the earlier period have become known: Abbot Berno of Reichenau (died 1048) and Abbot Udalschalc of Maischach at Augsburg (died 1150).
The other German poets whose names can be given belong to a period as late as the fifteenth century, as e. g. Provost Lippold of Steinberg and Bishop Johann Hofmann of Meissen. England took an early part in this style of poetry, but most of the offices that originated there have been lost. Archbishop Pecham's office of the Trinity has been discussed above. Next to him are worthy of mention Cardinal Adam Easton (died 1397) and the Carmelite John Horneby of Lincoln, who about 1370 composed a rhymed office in honour of the Holy Name of Jesus, and of the Visitation of Our Lady. 
Italy seems to have a relatively small representation; Rome itself, i. e. the "Roman Breviary", as we know, did not favour innovations, and consequently was reluctant to adopt rhythmical offices. Archbishop Alfons of Salerno (1058–85) is presumably the oldest Italian poet of this kind. Besides him there are Abbot Reinaldus de Colle di Mezzo (twelfth century), and the General of the Dominicans, Raymundus de Vineis from Capua (fourteenth century). In Sicily and in Spain the rhymed offices were popular and quite numerous, but with the exception of the Franciscan Fra Gil de Zamora, who about the middle of the fifteenth century composed an office in honour of the Blessed Virgin (Anal. Hymn., XVII, no. 8) it has been impossible to cite by name from those two countries any other poet who took part in composing rhythmical offices. 
Towards the close of the thirteenth century, Scandinavia also comes to the fore with rhymed offices, with Bishop Brynolphus of Skara (1278–1317), Archbishop Birgerus Gregorii of Upsala (died 1383), Bishop Nicolaus of Linköping (1374–91), and Johannes Benechini of Oeland (about 1440). 
The number of offices where the composer's name is known is insignificantly small. No less than seven hundred anonymous rhythmical offices were brought to light through the "Analecta Hymnica". Artistically they vary widely.

Crossing number (graph theory)

In graph theory, the crossing number cr("G") of a graph "G" is the lowest number of edge crossings of a plane drawing of the graph "G". For instance, a graph is planar if and only if its crossing number is zero.
The mathematical origin of the study of crossing numbers is in
Turán's brick factory problem, in which Pál Turán asked to determine the crossing number of the complete bipartite graph "K""m,n". However, the same problem of minimizing crossings was also considered in sociology at approximately the same time as Turán, in connection with the construction of sociograms. It continues to be of great importance in graph drawing.
Without further qualification, the crossing number allows drawings in which the edges may be represented by arbitrary curves; the rectilinear crossing number requires all edges to be straight line segments, and may differ from the crossing number. In particular, the rectilinear crossing number of a complete graph is essentially the same as the minimum number of convex quadrilaterals determined by a set of "n" points in general position, closely related to the Happy Ending problem.
History.
During World War II, Hungarian mathematician Pál Turán was forced to work in a brick factory, pushing wagon loads of bricks from kilns to storage sites. The factory had tracks from each kiln to each storage site, and the wagons were harder to push at the points where tracks crossed each other, from which Turán was led to ask his brick factory problem: what is the minimum possible number of crossings in a drawing of a complete bipartite graph?
Zarankiewicz attempted to solve Turán's brick factory problem; his proof contained an error,
but he established a valid upper bound of
for the crossing number of the complete bipartite graph "Km,n". The conjecture that this inequality is actually an equality is now known as Zarankiewicz' crossing number conjecture. The gap in the proof of the lower bound was not discovered until eleven years after publication, nearly simultaneously by Gerhard Ringel and Paul Kainen; see 
The problem of determining the crossing number of the complete graph was first posed by Anthony Hill, and appears in print in 1960. Hill and his collaborator John Ernest were two constructionist artists fascinated by mathematics, who not only formulated this problem but also originated a conjectural upper bound for this crossing number, which Richard Guy published in 1960., namely
which gives values of formula_3 for formula_4
see sequence () in the OEIS.
An independent formulation of the conjecture was made by Thomas L. Saaty in 1964. Saaty further
verified that the upper bound is achieved for formula_5 and Pan and Richter showed that it also
is achieved for formula_6 If only straight-line segments are permitted, then one needs more crossings. The rectilinear crossing numbers for "K""5" through "K""12" are 1, 3, 9, 19, 36, 62, 102, 153, () and values up to "K""27" are known, with "K""28" requiring either 7233 or 7234 crossings. Further values are collected by the Rectilinear Crossing Number project. Interestingly, it is not known whether the ordinary and rectilinear crossing numbers are the same for bipartite complete graphs. If the Zarankiewicz conjecture is correct, then the formula for the crossing number of the complete graph is asymptotically correct; that is,
As of January 2012, crossing numbers are known for very few graph families. In particular, except for a few initial cases, the crossing number of complete graphs, bipartite complete graphs, and products of cycles all remain unknown. There has been some progress on lower bounds, as reported by .
The Albertson conjecture, formulated by Michael O. Albertson in 2007, states that, among all graphs with chromatic number "n", the complete graph "K""n" has the minimum number of crossings. That is, if the Guy-Saaty conjecture on the crossing number of the complete graph is valid, every "n"-chromatic graph has crossing number at least equal to the formula in the conjecture. It is now known to hold for "n" ≤ 16.
Complexity.
In general, determining the crossing number of a graph is hard; Garey and Johnson showed in 1983 that it is an NP-hard problem. In fact the problem remains NP-hard even when restricted to cubic graphs. More specifically, determining the rectilinear crossing number is complete for the existential theory of the reals.
On the positive side, there are efficient algorithms for determining if the crossing number is less than a fixed constant "k" — in other words, the problem is fixed-parameter tractable. It remains difficult for larger "k", such as |"V"|/2. There are also efficient approximation algorithms for approximating cr("G") on graphs of bounded degree. In practice heuristic algorithms are used, such as the simple algorithm which starts with no edges and continually adds each new edge in a way that produces the fewest additional crossings possible. These algorithms are used in the Rectilinear Crossing Number distributed computing project.
Crossing numbers of cubic graphs.
The smallest cubic graphs with crossing numbers 1–8 are known . The smallest 1-crossing cubic graph is the complete bipartite graph "K"3,3, with 6 vertices. The smallest 2-crossing cubic graph is the Petersen graph, with 10 vertices. The smallest 3-crossing cubic graph is the Heawood graph, with 14 vertices. The smallest 4-crossing cubic graph is the Möbius-Kantor graph, with 16 vertices. The smallest 5-crossing cubic graph is the Pappus graph, with 18 vertices. The smallest 6-crossing cubic graph is the Desargues graph, with 20 vertices. None of the four 7-crossing cubic graphs, with 22 vertices, are well known. The smallest 8-crossing cubic graph is the McGee graph or (3,7)-cage graph, with 24 vertices.
In 2009, Exoo conjectured that the smallest cubic graph with crossing number 11 is the Coxeter graph, the smallest cubic graph with crossing number 13 is the Tutte–Coxeter graph and the smallest cubic graph with crossing number 170 is the Tutte 12-cage.
The crossing number inequality.
The very useful "crossing number inequality", discovered independently by Ajtai, Chvátal, Newborn, and Szemerédi and by Leighton, asserts that if a graph "G" (undirected, with no loops or multiple edges) with "n" vertices and "e" edges satisfies
then we have
The constant 33.75 is the best known to date,
and is due to Pach and Tóth; the constant 7.5 can be lowered to 4, but at the expense of replacing 33.75 with the worse constant of 64.
The motivation of Leighton in studying crossing numbers was for applications to VLSI design in theoretical
computer science. Later, Székely also realized that this inequality yielded very simple proofs of some important theorems
in incidence geometry, such as Beck's theorem and the Szemerédi-Trotter theorem, and Tamal Dey used it to prove upper bounds on geometric "k"-sets.
For graphs with girth larger than 2"r" and "e" ≥ 4"n", Pach, Spencer and Tóth
demonstrated an improvement of this inequality to
Proof of crossing number inequality.
We first give a preliminary estimate: for any graph "G" with "n" vertices and "e" edges, we have
To prove this, consider a diagram of "G" which has exactly cr("G") crossings. Each of these crossings can be removed
by removing an edge from "G". Thus we can find a graph with at least formula_12 edges and "n" vertices
with no crossings, and is thus a planar graph. But from Euler's formula we must then have
formula_13, and the claim follows. (In fact we have formula_14 for "n" ≥ 3).
To obtain the actual crossing number inequality, we now use a probabilistic argument. We let 0 < "p" < 1 be a probability parameter to be chosen later, and construct a random subgraph "H" of "G" by allowing each vertex of "G" to lie in "H" independently with probability "p", and allowing an edge of "G" to lie in "H" if and only if its two vertices were chosen to lie in "H". Let formula_15 denote the number of edges of "H", and let formula_16 denote the number of vertices.
Now consider a diagram of "G" with cr("G") crossings. We may assume that any two edges in this diagram with a common
vertex are disjoint, otherwise we could interchange the intersecting parts of the two edges and reduce the crossing number by one. Thus every crossing in this diagram involves four distinct vertices of "G".
Since "H" is a subgraph of "G", this diagram contains a diagram of "H"; let formula_17 denote the number of crossings of this random graph. By the preliminary crossing number
inequality, we have
Taking expectations we obtain
Since each of the "n" vertices in "G" had a probability "p" of being in "H", we have formula_20.
Similarly, since each of the edges in "G" has a probability formula_21 of remaining in "H" (since both endpoints
need to stay in "H"), then
formula_22. Finally, every crossing in the diagram of "G" has a probability formula_23 of remaining in "H", since every crossing involves four vertices, and so formula_24. Thus we have
If we now set "p" to equal 4"n"/"e" (which is less than one, since we assume that "e" is greater than 4"n"),
we obtain after some algebra
A slight refinement of this argument allows one to replace 64 by 33.75 when "e" is greater than 7.5 "n".

Crossing number (knot theory)

In the mathematical area of knot theory, the crossing number of a knot is the smallest number of crossings of any diagram of the knot. It is a knot invariant.
Examples.
By way of example, the unknot has crossing number zero, the trefoil knot three and the figure-eight knot four. There are no other knots with a crossing number this low, and just two knots have crossing number five, but the number of knots with a particular crossing number increases rapidly as the crossing number increases.
Tabulation.
Tables of prime knots are traditionally indexed by crossing number, with a subscript to indicate which particular knot out of those with this many crossings is meant (this sub-ordering is not based on anything in particular, except that torus knots then twist knots are listed first). The listing goes 31 (the trefoil knot), 41 (the figure-eight knot), 51, 52, 61, etc. This order has not changed significantly since P. G. Tait published a tabulation of knots in 1877.
Additivity.
There has been very little progress on understanding the behavior of crossing number under rudimentary operations on knots. A big open question asks if the crossing number is additive when taking knot sums. It is also expected that a satellite of a knot "K" should have larger crossing number than "K", but this has not been proven.
Additivity of crossing number under knot sum has been proven for special cases, for example if the summands are alternating knots (or more generally, adequate knot), or if the summands are torus knots. Marc Lackenby has also given a proof that there is a constant "N" > 1 such that formula_1, but his method, which utilizes normal surfaces, cannot improve "N" to 1.
Applications in bioinformatics.
There are mysterious connections between the crossing number of a knot and the physical behavior of DNA knots. For prime DNA knots, crossing number is a good predictor of the relative velocity of the DNA knot in agarose gel electrophoresis. Basically, the higher the crossing number, the faster the relative velocity. For composite knots, this does not appear to be the case, although experimental conditions can drastically change the results.
Related invariants.
There are related concepts of average crossing number and asymptotic crossing number. Both of these quantities bound the standard crossing number. Asymptotic crossing number is conjectured to be equal to crossing number.
Other numerical knot invariants include the bridge number, linking number, stick number, and unknotting number.

The Best Sex Ever

The Best Sex Ever is an American erotic anthology series featured on Cinemax during their "After Dark" schedule. The series features simulated sex scenes, and thus can be categorized as "soft core" or "voyeur." 
The premise of the show is listeners of a fictional radio show titled, ""The Best Sex Ever"", call in to recount their sexual exploits. Many high-profile porn stars made an appearance on the show, such as Sunrise Adams, Syren, and Monica Mayhem.
Opening monologue.
It's midnight...the witching hour. That means that once again it's time for you to tell me about the best sex you've ever had. All the good girls and boys have gone to bed, and the rest of us have the night to ourselves.
Closing monologue.
We've all had a night where intimacy knows no bounds and desire knows no rules...a night of reckless sexual abandon, a night you can still taste years after the sun comes up. We've all had one. What's yours?

Gerardo Aguilar Ramírez

Gerardo Aguilar Ramírez, known by his "nom de guerre" César, was a Colombian guerrilla leader of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). He was the commander of the Eastern Bloc's 1st Front. For five years he was in charge of FARC's hostages, including former presidential candidate Íngrid Betancourt. On July 2, 2008, the hostages were rescued in Operation Jaque and César was arrested.
On July 4, 2008, "Radio Suisse Romande" reported that unnamed "reliable sources" had told it the rescue took place after a payment of USD 20 million by the United States. According to "Le Monde", the French Foreign Ministry denied the payment of any ransom by France. 
Frederich Blassel, the author of the "Radio Suisse Romande" story, told Colombia's "W Radio" that, according to his source, the release was not negotiated directly with FARC but with César, one of the two guerrillas captured during the operation, who would have received the payment of USD 20 million. According to Blassel, the two rebels could be given new identities by Spain, France, and Switzerland.
According to Colombia's "El Tiempo" and "W Radio", General Fredy Padilla de León, Commander of the Colombian Armed Forces, denied the existence of any payment by the Colombian government. General Padilla argued that if any payment had been made, it would have been better to make it publicly known, to use it as an incentive and to cause confusion within FARC's ranks. William Brownfield, the U.S. ambassador to Colombia, also denied the allegations.
Aguilar was captured in July 2008 when members of the Colombian military, disguised as FARC rebels, freed former Colombian presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt, three US hostages and twelve others. 
The Colombian Supreme Court extradited Aguilar to the U.S. in July 2009 on narcotics conspiracy charges. On December 16, 2009, Aguilar pleaded guilty in a Washington, D.C. federal court to conspiring to import large quantities of cocaine into the U.S. As the commander of FARC’s 1st front from 1998 to July 2008, Aguilar said he directed his subordinates to manufacture and distribute thousands of tons of cocaine which was later imported to the U.S.
On July 22, 2010, Aguilar was sentenced to 27 years in prison. He is being held in a federal prison in Illinois.

Filip Despotovski

Filip Despotovski (Macedonian: Филип Дecпoтoвcки; born 18 November 1982 in Skopje, Republic of Macedonia) is a Macedonian football midfielder who plays for FK Vardar and the Macedonian National Team.
Professional career.
Early career.
Filip Despotovski started his career in Macedonia in FK Vardar's youth school, SSK Mladinec, but would sign his first professional contract with Cementarnica 55.
In his first professional season, Despotovski made 19 appearances and scored 4 goals for Cementarnica 55, which immediately earned him a transfer to prominent Serbian club OFK Beograd in summer 2002.
In his first season with OFK, Despotovski made 17 appearances and scored 1 goal to help the team to a third-place league finish. The following season though, Despotovski was no longer a starter, and he would move on from the club. Over the next two-and-a-half seasons, Despotovski played for Macedonian club Napredok Kičevo and Serbian clubs FK Bežanija and Mačva Šabac.
Ethnikos and Vardar.
In 2006, Despotovski landed in Greece with Beta Ethniki club Ethnikos Piraeus, and the move proved to be a turning point in his career. After one season with Ethnikos, FK Vardar, Macedonia's most prominent club, took notice of Despotovski's impressive form and signed him to a contract in summer 2007.
Despotovski's rapid growth as a player continued at Vardar, and as such he did not remain at the club very long. Despotovski was noted as Vardar's best player in the first half of the 2007-08 season, and during the winter transfer period Ukrainian Premier League club Vorskla Poltava stepped in and acquired his services from Vardar.
FK Vorskla.
In Despotovski's first full season with Vorskla, the team won the Ukrainian Cup for the first time in club history; Despotovski played all 90 minutes in Vorskla's 1-0 defeat of FC Shakhtar Donetsk in the Cup Final. The Cup victory earned Despotovski the distinction of being the fifth Macedonian international to win a Cup title, after Goran Pandev, Goran Popov, Zlatko Tanevski and Artim Sakiri. In league play, Despotovski made 25 appearances and scored 1 goal; Vorskla went undefeated in his first league 16 appearances.
On 20 August 2009, Despotovski made his first appearance in European competition when Vorskla took on Primeira Liga club Benfica in the play-off round of the 2009–10 UEFA Europa League. Despotovski appeared in the second leg of the tie against Benfica as well; the Portuguese team would advance with a 5-2 aggregate victory. In league play, Despotovski made 14 appearances and scored 1 goal in 2009-10.
FC Inter Baku.
Despotovski signed a 1 year deal with Inter Baku on 30 August 2010.
International career.
2010 FIFA World Cup qualification.
On 6 June 2009, Despotovski made his debut for the Macedonian National Team against Norway in 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA Group 9); the Norway match was Macedonia's fifth of their eight total qualifying matches. Following his debut, Despotovski made two more appearancesboth startsin Group 9 qualification, against Iceland and Scotland.
UEFA Euro 2012 qualification.
As of June 2011, Despotovski has made five appearances (four starts) for Macedonia in UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying (Group B).
Other.
In 2009, Despotovski played for Macedonia in friendly matches against Spain, Qatar, Canada and Iran.
In 2010, Despotovski played for Macedonia in friendly matches against Montenegro, Azerbaijan, Romania, and Malta.
In 2011, Despotovski has played for Macedonia in a friendly match against Cameroon.

14th Prince of Wales's Own Scinde Horse

The 14th Prince of Wales's Own Scinde Horse was a regular cavalry regiment of the British Indian Army it can trace its formation back to two regiments of Scinde Irregular Horse raised at Hyderabad in 1838. It was named after the province of Sind now in Pakistan, where it was raised to fight against the marauding Baluchi warriors. These two regiments were absorbed into the regular forces after the Mutiny of 1857 and became the 35th Scinde Horse and the 36th Jacob's Horse. They saw active service in Northern and Central India, Persia, Afghanistan on the North West Frontier and, during World War I, where they served in France and Palestine.
The two regiments were amalgamated in 1922, as the present 14th Prince of Wales's Own Scinde Horse which served in World War II.
Scinde Horse is the only regiment known to honour its enemy till date (the Baluchi warrior on its badge) and has not changed its badge since its raising, unlike others who have done so-numerous times.
At one point, the regiment carried 9 Standards while on parade (regiments normally hold 1), a unique privilege given to it for its valor. 
The regiment was the first Cavalry unit in the British Indian Army to get mechanized in the Indian sub-continent at Rawalpindi, in 1938. It was also the first Cavalry regiment to get the President of India's Standard post independence. 
In 1922 the two regiments were amalgamated as the 14th Prince of Wales’s Own Scinde Horse.
35th Scinde Horse.
The 35th Scinde Horse saw service in the Second Sikh War where it was involved in the Battle of Gujrat and the Second Afghan War. During World War I the regiment remained in India
36th Jacob's Horse.
Raised by Lieut. John Jacob of the Bombay Artillery, they served first in Southern Afghanistan and later under Sir Charles Napier in the taking of Scinde. They later were involved in the Second Sikh War and the Second Afghan War. During World War I the 36th Jacobs Horse was a part of the 8th (Lucknow) Cavalry Brigade, 1st Indian Cavalry Division which saw action in France on the Western Front and later moved to Egypt for the Palestine Campaign; the brigade formation was:
World War II.
In World War II the 14th Prince of Wales's Own Scinde Horse was attached to the newly formed 31st Indian Armoured Division, that had been raised in July 1940. The division trained extensively but with very few tanks — the tank Regiments assigned to 1st Indian Armoured Brigade had three M3 Stuart tanks each, though a number of the obsolete India Pattern light tanks were used for crew training. The final formation of the Division was the 252nd Indian Armoured Brigade and the 3rd Indian Motor Brigade
Though lacking tanks, the 252nd Armoured Brigade was detached and sent to Iraq in January 1942. Division headquarters moved to Iraq in June 1942, where it took command of the shattered remnants of 3rd Indian Motor Brigade which had been detached and overrun by the Italians at the Battle of Gazala and the 252nd Indian Armoured Brigade, which still had no tanks. 
Armor finally arrived in November, when one Regiment received M3 Stuart tanks and the other two received Grant medium tanks.
The Armourd Brigade formation was,
31st Armoured Division never saw action as a unit, its closest brush with combat coming in April 1944 when it was rushed to Egypt to crush a mutiny among the Greek 1st Infantry Brigade.
The Brigade received M4 Sherman tanks in November 1943, apparently in preparation for transfer to combat in Italy, but only drove them in Iraq, Syria and Egypt.
After partition/independence of India and Pakistan, in 1947, the regiment was allotted to the new Indian Army.

Kathmandu municipal election, 1953

Local elections to a municipal council for Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, were first held on September 9, 1953. Candidates nominated by the illegal Communist Party of Nepal got 50% of the total votes cast. Out of a total of 19 seats, six were won by communists, four by Nepali Congress, four by Praja Parishad, one by Gorkha Parishad and four by independents.
Amongst the elected communists was the chairman of the council, Janak Man Singh. However, his tenure became short. A jurisdictional dispute emerged between the municipal council and the national government. A no-confidence vote removed Singh from his office and the national government banned him from entering the municipal council office. Singh was arrested when attempting to enter the office, and was jailed.

Wang Sheng (general)

Wang Sheng (; October 15, 1915 – October 5, 2006) was a general in the Republic of China Army, head of the General Political Warfare College and a close confidant to President Chiang Ching-kuo. He divorced his childhood wife (with whom he had a daughter) and married Hu Hsiang-li in 1945, who bore three sons and two daughters. Hu died in 1955. Later, Wang Sheng married Hsiung Hui-ying in November 1956, and had a son.
Mainland life.
Wang Sheng, born Wang Shiu-chieh on October 15, 1915, was the son of a rich Hakka land-owning family in Longnan County, Jiangxi, on the Guangdong border. He received an elementary education at Chih-liang Elementary School (1924–29) and then worked as a clerk in his brother’s traditional medicine store. After a return to formal study at Nanfang Institute of Chinese Literature, (1932–35), Wang joined the Righteous Warriors Communist Suppression Squad, a militia mopping up after the remaining forces left behind in the former Jiangxi-Fujian Soviet area after the Chinese Communist Party embarked on its Long March.
Wang subsequently joined the 12th Jiangxi Security Protection Regiment, in 1936, as a clerk. After a year, he was transferred to the training battalion of the 6th Strong Youth Training Regiment, which was directly under the leadership of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek’s son, Chiang Ching-kuo. CCK, as he later became known, had just returned from a decade in the Soviet Union, during which time he reportedly joined the communist party and then became disillusioned with it. Wang became aide de camp to a regimental commander working directly under CCK, but there is no indication the two men met at that time.
After a brief period of combat and further self-education, he entered Class 16 of the Jiangxi Third Branch of the Central Military Academy in February 1939. It was at this time that Wang joined the Kuomintang (KMT, or Nationalist Party), and after graduating first in his class, he was sent to the Three Principles of the People ("San Min Chu-i" or "San Min Zhuyi") Youth Corps Training Course, run directly by CCK. Again, Wang graduated at the top of his class, and was chosen to work for Chiang Ching-kuo, which he did for the next 50 years.
After several years in Southern Jiangxi administration, Wang was sent to Chongqing for further training and to attend the San Min Zhuyi Youth Corps’ 1st National Congress, in 1943. At the congress, CCK emerged from his post-Russian shadow and took leading roles in the half-million strong parallel youth organization. After the congress, Wang was sent back to Jiangxi as the third ranking leader of the provincial Youth Corps. In 1944, he entered the first class of the Central Cadre Academy Research Division, a type of political graduate school; one of his classmates was future Premier Li Huan. However, military setbacks shortened the students’ studies.
Desperate for more soldiers, the party in late 1944 created a youth militia, and made 35-year-old Lieutenant General Chiang Ching-kuo its Political Department Director. Lieutenant Colonel Wang was sent to the South-east Branch as political officer (commissar) of the training base for the 208th and 209th Divisions. (While Wang was at this assignment, a young communist named Jiang Zemin was arrested, and later released by his unit. In 1989, Jiang became General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party.)
At the end of the War Against Japan, Wang was in charge of the 1st Section (propaganda) of the 31st Corps Political Department, a logical progression when his 208th and 209th Divisions were reorganized into the corps-level unit. From November 1945 to June 1946, Wang was with his units on garrison duty in Hangzhou. He was then reassigned to the seemingly low position of Director of Student Affairs at Chia-hsing (Jiaxing) Youth Middle School, a specially established training and education institution for demobilized soldiers of the Youth Army. He was, however, still directly under the orders of Chiang Ching-kuo.
A year later, in July 1947, CCK tapped (now full) Col. Wang as an inspector in the Ministry of National Defense Bureau of Preparatory Cadres, a revamped Youth Army demobilization organization. Ironically, the transfer coincided with a general mobilization to staff the newly erupting civil war. As needs changed, Wang was tasked as Deputy Section Chief in the KMT Youth Department, his first party assignment. He was nominally based in Nanjing, but travelled to universities across Nationalist-held territory.
Hyperinflation.
In mid-1948, inflation reached such a rate that wheelbarrows full of bank notes were insufficient to keep pace with price changes The government replaced the worthless "fabi" with a new, gold-backed "Chin-yuan Chuan" ("Jinyuan quan") at a rate of three million to one. Simultaneously, hoarding and speculation were banned. Chiang Ching-kuo was assigned to implement this financial revolution at the Shanghai branch of the Economic Supervisors’ Office, and immediately sent for Col. Wang.
Wang Sheng brought the 6th Suppression and Reconstruction Brigade to Shanghai, and CCK began offering rewards for information on those not complying with the new laws. The unit comprised only 100 junior officers, and was later supplemented by seven other similar units, all under now-Major General Wang’s authority. He then established a 30,000-strong Greater Shanghai Youth Service Corps to patrol the streets, enforcing the financial regulations.
CCK and General Wang needed credibility, and fast. They found it by moving against high-profile figures, under the protection of the Chiang family name. Among those arrested were Du Wei-ping, the son of “Big Ears” Du Yuesheng, the senior-most Green Gang triad boss; “Rice Tiger” Wan Moulin, a close associate of Du; and the managers of several industrial establishments owned by former prime minister (and CCK's uncle) TV Soong. Ultimately, the effort failed and the regulations were lifted by end-October and hyperinflation returned with a vengeance.
In the chaos of late 1948 and early 1949, Gen. Wang took command of the Jiangxi 3rd Political Work Brigade (his old 6th Suppression and Reconstruction Brigade, renamed) and became Jiangxi Province KMT Secretary. After barely a month in Nanchang, he was ordered to Ganzhou, then Nanjing and Guangzhou. As Guangzhou became untenable, Wang's unit retreated into Chongqing, Sichuan Province; said to have been the last unit to leave Guangzhou for Chongqing. 
In November 1949, President Chiang Kai-Shek flew from Taiwan to Chongqing, to personally supervise the defense of Sichuan. That gave Wang an occasion to meet the President. Still, despite Chiang's presence, Chongqing fell to the Communists in the same November, the KMT government retreating to Chengdu. On December 10, the President flew from Chengdu back to Taiwan. Wang hoped to stay in Sichuan and to lead guerilla fighting; but on Chiang's orders, he also left Chengdu, arriving to Taiwan by the way of Hainan. His subordinates stayed behind in Sichuan; many of them made it to Taiwan much later, via Burma.
Taiwan.
The Taiwan Wang arrived at in 1950 was the new home for over one million refugees, including many of the very elite of Republican society, government and business. After arriving in Taiwan in 1949, CCK established a Political Action Committee in Kaohsiung with General P’eng Meng-ch’i (Peng Mengqi) and Air Force Commander (later Army Chief-of-Staff) Chou Chih-jou (Zhou Zhirou). Much of the responsibility for the committee’s work, however, was delegated to Wang Sheng, intelligence chief Mao Jen-feng (Mao Renfang) and others (the PAC was renamed the Political Work Department in 1950, and the General Political Warfare Department in 1963). This would have put Wang at the center of the mass purges that resulted in up to 10,000 arrests and as many as a thousand executions during 1949-50.
Gen. Peng deserves special mention. Known as the Butcher of Kaohsiung, Peng oversaw the reestablishment of control over the city, through the use of military force, after reinforcements arrived from the mainland. The association with CCK and General Peng would have had a very important influence on Wang's public reputation.
In the following year or so, numerous high-ranking officials were accused of being communists, and executed. Among these were an Army deputy chief of staff and his wife; the head of conscription; a vice minister of national defense; and the commander of the 70th Division.
In Taiwan, Wang established the precursor to the General Political Warfare College, the elite training school for army and party cadres. Nominally second in charge in the civil-military programs, welfare and services section of CCK’s cadre system, Wang’s main task was laying the foundation for the Chinese Youth Anti-Communist League, or China Youth Corps as it was renamed. His mentor, Chiang Ching-kuo, was in 1952 named to the reformed KMT politburo and proceeded to take on a series of both military and economic responsibilities directly related to the future of Taiwan. Wang himself was nominated for the Central Committee in 1957, but gave up his seat to a more senior military officer, and as first alternate, joined the CC in May 1959.
Col. Wang spent most of the later 1950s and 1960s training army political cadres in the General Political Warfare College, a position that allowed him to develop a teacher relationship with rising officers throughout the armed forces. All units from company level up were to have a political officer, and those above company level were trained at Wang’s "Fu Hsing Kang" (Restoration Hill Base) College in Taipei. In 1953, he was named Assistant Commandant (i.e., Provost) and in January 1954 was restored to the rank of Major General. By the end of 1955, Wang was Commandant, and 40 years of age.
In 1960, Maj. Gen. Wang was transferred to the post of Deputy Director of the General Political Warfare Department (GPWD), and about a year later in mid-1961 was promoted to Lieutenant General and Executive Deputy Director. He remained in the post, until being promoted to Director in April 1975, the same month in which Chiang Kai-shek died.
General Wang served as Director of the General Political Warfare Department of the ROC Armed Forces from 1975 to 1983.
Domestic enemies.
Opposition to the ruling KMT turned violent in the 1970s. Bombings in Tainan and Taipei targeted the American presence on the island in 1970 and 1971, although casualties were light. Explosives also knocked out electric power in the southern part of the island in early 1976. The campaign then escalated toward assassination when letter bombs were sent to Governor (later Vice President) Hsieh Tung-min (Xie Dongmin), former Governor Huang Chieh (Huang Jie) and KMT Organization Department Director Li Huan, who later became KMT Secretary-General and Premier. Governor Hsieh lost his right arm and an eye in the attacks, whereas the others escaped injury. in 1980, bombs at the Los Angeles homes of General Wang's second son, Wang Pu-tien (Wang Butian) and the son of Kaohsiung Mayor Wang Yu-yueng (Wang Yuyong; no relation) detonated, killing Mayor Wang's brother-in-law.
In the Spring of 1977, KMT rising star Hsu Hsin-liang (Xu Xinliang) published a mildly critical memoir of his years in the provincial National Assembly, to raise support for his campaign for the seat of Taoyuan County Magistrate. When the KMT failed to nominate him, he ran as an independent, and was expelled from the party. In the run-up to the election, Gen. Wang (and others) undertook a campaign criticizing local literati as leftist.
Election irregularities in Chungli County that year led to violence, creating the pretext for a crack-down on dissent and, simultaneously, solidifying the foundations of the opposition political network known as the "Tangwai", or “those outside the (Nationalist) party.” One year later, amid a very tight domestic political environment, the United States switched its formal diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing.
Diplomatic exile.
Toward the end of his tenure, as President Chiang Ching-kuo's health was failing, General Wang travelled to the US. The trip, to discuss succession plans and possibly win backing for his own candidacy, has been described as either "secretive" or unauthorized. It also marked the end of Wang's special role in Taiwan politics. That CCK was getting potential successors out of the way was confirmed by his posting his own son, Chiang Hsiao-wu, to Taiwan's representative office in Singapore. 
For Wang Sheng, an even more remote assignment was found. In November 1983, he arrived to Paraguay as the ambassador of the Republic of China. He was credited with helping the small Chinese-Paraguayan community to better organize, and to become less victimized by the police extortion. He, and the staff of his embassy, were instrumental in overseeing Taiwan's development assistance to this Latin American nation, which, although small in absolute terms, later became the world's largest country with which Republic of China has official diplomatic relations. At a reception held by Paraguay's President Andrés Rodríguez before Wang Sheng's departure from Paraguay in 1991, President Rodríguez characterized Wang's contribution to Paraguay as "immeasurable".
Wang Sheng returned to Taiwan only in 1990 or 1991, after Chiang Ching-kuo's death. He died on October 5, 2006 in Taiwan.

Roar (utterance)

A roar is a deep, bellowing outburst of sound forced through an open mouth. It is produced by animals of certain species. A roar is usually made using the hyoid, a small bone which is not completely rigid in adults. Animals roar for various reasons, including territorial proclamation, communication with other members, and anger. Additionally, the roar of an animal such as a lion is used in the process of finding and competing for a mate.
The roar pattern is composed of three overall segments - a beginning segment sounding like moaning, a middle segment with low frequency loud tones and a final segment which sounds much like grunting. The lion's roar is familiar to many through its inclusion in the MGM opening sequence. This roar segment consists only of the middle portion of the roar, omitting the first and last portions.

DC Universe Online

DC Universe Online is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) based upon the fictional universe of DC Comics. Developed by Sony Online Entertainment's Austin studio and co-published by Sony Computer Entertainment and WB Games, the game was released in January 2011.
Premise.
Jim Lee serves as the game's executive creative director, along with Carlos D'Anda, JJ Kirby, Oliver Nome, Eddie Nuñez, Livio Ramondelli, and Michael Lopez. "EverQuest" developer Chris Cao was the game director through launch up to May 2011, but has since stepped down to be replaced by Mark Anderson, previously the art director. Mark Anderson himself has since been replaced by Jens Anderson. Shawn Lord is also involved. Geoff Johns is the principal writer.
The revenue model was subscription based with a user cost of $14.99 per month, rather than using microtransactions. The UK subscription was £9.99 a month, £19.99 for three months, and £49.99 for six months. The cost for Australian subscribers was $19.95 AUD. It was announced on September 19, 2011 that the game would go free to play. On November 1, 2011 the game became free to play for everyone. There are 3 levels of players: Free, Premium (at least $5 spent on the game) and Legendary, which are ongoing subscribers. DC Universe Online was announced for the PlayStation 4 on June 5, 2013 alongside with PlanetSide 2.
Gameplay.
"DC Universe Online" is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) set in the DC Universe. Sony Online Entertainment's stated goal is to make a different kind of MMORPG, with "" cited as one of the main inspirations for gameplay. SOE is working to make "DC Universe Online" more interactive than standard MMORPGs, while trying to keep their key elements, which include a leveling system, raid instances, endgame progression and inventories. The world is mainly shared, public space instead of heroes or villains owning territory. The public space features dynamically-generated content designed for both hero and villain player characters (uniquely created by the player, who cannot choose DCU stalwarts).
Players will choose a mentor for their character whether it be a hero (like Superman, Batman, or Wonder Woman) or a villain (like Lex Luthor, Joker, or Circe). Their starting location, principal quest rewards and mob loot will be influenced by that decision. The starting zones are either Metropolis or Gotham City, for both heroes and villains. Heroes can also go to the Justice League Watchtower while villains can enter the Secret Society of Super Villains headquarters at the Hall of Doom. Other safe-houses in the Gotham and Metropolis zones can be reached by teleporters from the two faction headquarters or from the two cities. For the heroes, it's various police stations. For the villains, it's various nightclubs owned by the villains.
Each character is given a communicator appropriate to their faction, via which they receive urgent communications from their mentor and his/her colleagues and subordinates; heroes will frequently receive status updates from Oracle, while villains will receive data from Calculator. In addition to assignments from their mentor, player characters may also receive requests for help from other mentors of the same faction. Player characters may also accept missions from non-player characters (NPCs) in the street, usually minor characters from their faction. There are also opportunities for quick street encounters appropriate to the character's faction: for example, a hero character may encounter a thug robbing an armored truck, trying to break into an office building, or in the process of mugging a citizen; while a villain character may be presented with opportunities to assist NPC thugs with an armored truck robbery, or assault a citizen using an ATM. All NPC interactions are fully animated and voice-acted. Player characters will earn threat ratings that will cause NPC heroes and villains to interact accordingly with the character.
The shared worldspace offers primarily solo and team player versus environment (PvE) gaming opportunities in the form of open air missions and instances, although player versus player (PvP) combat is also possible in this worldspace. Other PvP (and to a smaller extent, PvE) gaming is available in various types of queued instanced encounters: "Legends", small scale PvP combats in which players take on the identities of iconic characters (continued success in Legends combat unlocks additional iconic characters); "Arena", small scale PvP combat in which players fight as their own characters; "Alerts", cooperative team missions; and "Raids", Cooperative PvE missions that are larger than Alerts. Success in PvE missions is rewarded with in-game money, costume pieces, equipment and consumables, while PVP combat is rewarded with unlocks of special equipment sets.
Storyline.
"DC Universe Online" is set in the present day, but the opening cinematic sequence takes place in a gritty, war-torn future depicting a final battle between the world's greatest heroes and villains.
This battle takes place in the ruins of Metropolis, and features the deaths of several well-known DC Comics characters. The battle culminates with the death of Superman at the hands of Lex Luthor, leaving him and the Joker as the apparent survivors. Lex Luthor stands back to proclaim his victory, only to see Brainiac's war fleet fill the skies. The scene then shifts to the present-day Watchtower, where the future Lex Luthor is telling the story to the present-day Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman. Lex Luthor explains that the deadly final war between the heroes and villains was triggered by the subtle manipulations of Brainiac (who had been slowly downloading their powers over time). With the planet's most powerful beings dead, Brainiac intended to use the pirated data to create an army of metahumans under his control, facilitating his conquest of Earth. As the only survivor of the war, Lex Luthor could do nothing to resist Brainiac's subjugation of the planet. Lex Luthor explains that he was able to survive in secret and eventually steal the stolen data and energy from Brainiac's mothership in the form of "Exobytes" (nanobot-sized devices that can bond to a living host and give them their own superpowers). After finally designing a time machine (or possibly stealing one from Brainiac's technology), Lex Luthor has traveled into his past to release the exobytes into the atmosphere of present-day Earth. The heroes are outraged, but Lex Luthor explains that because he has done this, soon thousands of new metahumans will be created from ordinary humans (becoming the characters that players design and play with). He implores the Justice League to find and train these new metahumans, because Brainiac is coming and the Earth must be ready to succeed where it was once doomed to fail.
In the second trailer to the game "In Lex we Trust", we find that Lex Luthor's description of events leading up to his arrival in the present time is not as he described to the heroes. The trailer begins with Lex Luthor reviving his companion Fracture from being unconscious. Lex Luthor explains that Brainiac's forces have already penetrated the Fortress of Solitude and that their time is running out. As they approach a time portal chamber, a Brainiac Eradicator attacks and Fracture destroys the robotic drone with a small grenade. The two arrive at the portal which is being stabilized by Batman (whose face is disfigured and arm is replaced by a robotic prosthetic due to injuries from the battle of villains and heroes). As more Eradicators enter the chamber, Lex Luthor lies saying his armor is damaged and that he can not hold them off. Batman tells Fracture to take the canister that contains millions of Exobytes and go through the portal attacking the Eradicators and buying him more time. Fracture thanks Lex for using the exobytes to give him his powers. Seeing the opportunity he had been waiting for, Lex Luthor kills Fracture describing him as "an excellent lab rat." As Lex Luthor is about to step into the portal, Batman calls to Lex Luthor warning that "I'll be coming for you" to which Lex responds "No, you won't" and activates a self-destruct sequence. Lex Luthor enters into the portal and the Fortress of Solitude suffers massive explosions. He arrives in a dark alley, presumably present day. He is greeted by his present-day self who describes him as being late.
It is then shown at the end of "The Prime Battleground" raid that Future Lex Luthor and Lex Luthor are working together to steal Brainiac's power. Lex Luthor is then betrayed by his future self as Future Lex Luthor wants the power for himself. It is then seen that Future Batman survived the explosion at the Fortress of Solitude and has been chasing Future Lex Luthor through time. Future Lex escapes and Future Batman follows him. In the following cutscene, Future Batman is said to be the last hope for humanity.
Universe.
While the game has shown a DC Universe largely similar to the pre-New 52 DCU. Notable differences exist, such as the absence of Damian Wayne and Stephanie Brown. Dick Grayson as Nightwing and Tim Drake still operating as Robin, Cassandra Cain still operating as Batgirl, Bane's continued use of the Venom steroid, Black Adam's return to super-villain status despite recent comics changing him into an anti-hero, and Ralph Dibny still active.
It seems as though "Final Crisis" has not occurred, as Batman has not apparently endured trauma at the hands of Darkseid, the Martian Manhunter is alive, but Barry Allen appears to be serving as the Flash. Jonathan Kent is also alive and well, unlike his mainline DC Universe counterpart. Several story-arcs used for alert and raid instances are based upon content that occurred in-continuity that pre-dates Final Crisis and occurred, in some cases, as events in 52 and Countdown to Final Crisis. Examples include the Oolong Island instance and multiple story-arcs centered around Black Adam as well as Darkseid being currently absent from content. Also, certain key events from the mainline DC Universe are still referred to as history in the world presented in the game, including the "Crisis on Infinite Earths", "The Death of Superman", and "".
Additionally, the events of Flashpoint and The New 52 reboot which ensued have not been reflected. Hero and villain design as well as in game canon all continues to be based on the real DC Universe.
Characters.
The following heroes, villains, and other characters appear in this game:
Cast.
The game's voice cast is very large, and is inclusive of many known characters in the DC Universe. Sony Online Entertainment released a complete voice cast list on January 18, 2011. Some cast members, such as Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill, were announced early. The high-profile heroes and villains include:
Comics.
DC Comics announced in January 2010 that they will be releasing "," a 52-issue weekly limited series (along the lines of previous similar series like "52", "Countdown to Final Crisis" and "Trinity") which would be based on the game. Rather than a weekly series, the format was changed to a biweekly series, with comic book writer Tony Bedard and game writer Marv Wolfman, and with artists Howard Porter and Adriana Melo. The title launched in February 2011.
Development and updates.
The first conceptual art for the game was released on July 4, 2008, and the first trailer was released on July 14, 2008.
A Beta was released on December 14, 2010 and was closed on January 5, 2011. There were a number of technical issues that came to light when the beta was closed which were only partially resolved by the game's release.
In August 2011, there was a global server merge implemented by the developers to consolidate all PC servers and PlayStation 3 servers into 4 individual servers, one for each platform per region. In mid-2013, as part of a hosting deal, accounts for the European PC version were sold to ProSeibenSat.1, however they are still capable of using the US Servers, and the PS3 accounts are still hosted by Sony Online Entertainment for all regions. 
On September 6, 2011 the first downloadable content pack was released, called "Fight For The Light". This pack included a new, seventh power, Light, and the ability to join the Green Lantern Corps or Sinestro Corps as reservists. It also included three new Group Combat Alerts and a Duo. The pack was free to all current subscribers.
"DC Universe Online" is a free to play MMO as of November 2 of 2011. There is Premium as well as Legendary memberships available. All new players are created with Free membership. All existing lapsed paid accounts were transferred to Premium membership. All current paid accounts were transferred to Legendary memberships. Premium membership requires a single purchase equivalent to $5, Legendary members pay a monthly fee.
The second downloadable content was released on December 6, 2011, called "Lightning Strikes". This pack included the eighth power, Electricity, the new Central City zone, along with new gear, characters and a duo. Like the first DLC it is free to all Legendary subscribers and can be purchased by Free or Premium members. A third downloadable content entitled "Battle for Earth" was announced for release soon after Update 10. Along with a new, ninth power; Earth, the DLC introduced new raids, duos, alerts, and gear. The Brainiac story arc finally reached a conclusion in the South Gotham zone, which was filled with new content, while a new arc arose. DLC 4 was made available to all players on June 19, 2012, entitled "The Last Laugh" and featuring a storyline twist by The Joker. In this storyline arc, The Joker has stolen and made public the access codes to Police headquarters and nightclub safehouses for opposing factions, giving access to them in duo and arena scenarios. The DLC also features the introduction a new weapon type: Shield. Also, new legendary iconic hero and villains were made available for Legends PVP play, featuring Kryptonian and Lantern Corps related characters. The fifth DLC, "The Hand of Fate" was released in September 2012. This new DLC added Doctor Fate and Felix Faust as playable characters in Legends PVP and introduced a new type of mission – Operations – which are carried out in the open world in groups of 4 to 8. This update also expanded the number of slots players can use to carry trinkets and consumable items with the "Utility Belt Attachment" item. The sixth DLC title "Home Turf" was announced, which will include secret lairs and one-on-one battles to protect them. In late December future DLC packs for 2013 were announced titled "Origin Crisis", "Halls of Power", and "Sons of Trigon". With the later to feature a brutal hellscape of Gotham City. On May 14, the seventh DLC went live, which introduced Quantum powers and Tier 5 Instances. On September 3, 2013, the eighth DLC, "Sons of Trigon" launched. It included a new "Gotham Wasteland" open area, three duos, an alert, and the Celestial power set. The storyline features battles against the demon Trigon and his sons. It also featured the inclusion of characters such as Superboy and John Constatine. 
"DC Universe online" was announced as a free-to-play title for the PlayStation 4 on June 5, 2013.
Reception.
"DC Universe Online" received generally positive reviews from critics. Nick Kolan of IGN said, "I wish I loved "DC Universe Online", but instead I just like it. It's got a lot going for it – a great license, some superb voice actors, a lot of well-crafted settings, fast action-based combat, and an entire market of people who, so far, have barely been exposed to the MMO genre." GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd wrote, "PC players will be immediately struck by the console-focused interface and the overzealous profanity filter, which inexplicably couldn't be turned off (this was later added in through updates). However, loading times on the PC are zippy, and the game runs smoothly as you soar across the skies. The PlayStation 3 version is noticeably more sluggish. Menus take too long to pop up; the frame rate chugs along every so often, or the game might freeze for a second or two; and the telltale texture pop-in common to games using Unreal 3 technology is all too prevalent."

Henry Andres Burgevine

Henry Andres Burgevine () (1836–1865) was an American sailor of French ancestry, mercenary and soldier of fortune, who became famous for his military victories for Imperial China during the Taiping Rebellion. 
Family.
According to Caleb Carr in his biography of Frederick Townsend Ward, Burgevine was the child of a French officer who had served under Napoleon Bonaparte and who had moved to Chapel Hill, North Carolina where became an instructor in French at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. His father, after having been caught (at what?) by the President of the University, then died in a brawl in South Carolina. Burgevine then lived with his grandparents and sister in Ashford, North Carolina. 
Career.
At age 7 Burgevine moved to Washington, D.C. with his mother and became a Congressional and then a Senatorial page until 1853. After travels in India, Hawaii and Australia, he then returned to Washington and then enlisted in the French Army for the duration of the Crimean War, where he was decorated for bravery. 
In the early stages of the Taiping Rebellion he sided with the Qing Army, serving as the deputy commander of Ever Victorious Army, and succeeding the commander, Frederick Townsend Ward to command the Ever Victorious Army after Ward's death. Burgevine's assignment was against Ward's will, who wished his loyal Filipino subordinate Macanaya to succeed him as the commander, but the imperial Chinese court selected Burgevine instead. However, Burgevine betrayed the Qing Dynasty by later defecting and joining Li Shixian's army. He was later repatriated to the United States but he returned to China after completing half of his journey. On his return Qing police arrested him once again. In 1865 he drowned along with 10 Qing police in Xiamen's sea on the way to Shanghai, China, although some historians believed that Burgevine was murdered on Li Hongzhang's orders.

Bordeaux Tramway Line C

The C line of the Bordeaux tramway is operated by the Tram et Bus de la CUB, and connects Les Aubiers to Terres Neuves.
Being connected to the line A and line B, it will link Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean to different communes of the CUB.
History.
Much like Line B, Line C experienced technical problems with the ground-level power supply (APS) which delayed its opening. It was inaugurated on 24 April 2004.
Line C was prolonged towards Grand Parc on 19 November 2007 pending completion of important work brought about by the replacement Cracovie bridge on the line in Médoc, then to the north terminus les Aubiers station on 27 February 2008 and also towards Terres Neuves (Bègles) 27 February 2008.
Material.
The tramway uses Citadis 300 trams from Alstom. They are type 302, 33 meters long with 218 places for passengers. The cars are air conditioned both while using overhead lines and ground-level power (APS). But, given the large influx of passengers some days (périodes blanches SNCF), regular size trains have been claimed by users, but some quays are too short for regular trains, therefore are not used for security purposes. APS is used on the majority of line C.

Plancherel theorem for spherical functions

In mathematics, the Plancherel theorem for spherical functions is an important result in the representation theory of semisimple Lie groups, due in its final form to Harish-Chandra. It is a natural generalisation in non-commutative harmonic analysis of the Plancherel formula and Fourier inversion formula in the representation theory of the group of real numbers in classical harmonic analysis and has a similarly close interconnection with the theory of differential equations.
It is the special case for zonal spherical functions of the general Plancherel theorem for semisimple Lie groups, also proved by Harish-Chandra. The Plancherel theorem gives the eigenfunction expansion of radial functions for the Laplacian operator on the associated symmetric space "X"; it also gives the direct integral decomposition into irreducible representations of the regular representation on L2("X"). In the case of
hyperbolic space, these expansions were known from prior results of Mehler, Weyl and Fock.
The main reference for almost all this material is the encyclopedic text of .
History.
The first versions of an abstract Plancherel formula for the Fourier transform on a unimodular locally compact group "G" were due to Segal and Mautner. At around the same time, Harish-Chandra and Gelfand & Naimark derived an explicit formula for SL(2,R) and complex semisimple Lie groups, so in particular the Lorentz groups. A simpler abstract formula was derived by Mautner for a "topological" symmetric space "G"/"K" corresponding to a maximal compact subgroup "K". Godement gave a more concrete and satisfactory form for positive definite spherical functions, a class of special functions on "G"/"K". Since when "G" is a semisimple Lie group these spherical functions φλ were naturally labelled by a parameter λ in the quotient of a Euclidean space by the action of a finite reflection group, it became a central problem to determine explicitly the Plancherel measure in terms of this parametrization. Generalizing the ideas of Hermann Weyl from the spectral theory of ordinary differential equations, Harish-Chandra introduced his celebrated c-function "c"(λ) to describe the asymptotic behaviour of the spherical functions φλ and proposed "c"(λ)−2 "d"λ as the Plancherel measure. He verified this formula for the special cases when "G" is complex or real rank one, thus in particular covering the case when "G"/"K" is a hyperbolic space. The general case was reduced to two conjectures about the properties of the c-function and the so-called spherical Fourier transform. Explicit formulas for the c-function were later obtained for a large class of classical semisimple Lie groups by Bhanu-Murthy. In turn these formulas prompted Gindikin and Karpelevič to derive a product formula for the c-function, reducing the computation to Harish-Chandra's formula for the rank 1 case. Their work finally enabled Harish-Chandra to complete his proof of the Plancherel theorem for spherical functions in 1966.
In many special cases, for example for complex semisimple group or the Lorentz groups, there are simple methods to develop the theory directly. Certain subgroups of these groups can be treated by techniques generalising the well-known "method of descent" due to Jacques Hadamard. In particular gave a general method for deducing properties of the spherical transform for a real semisimple group from that of its complexification.
One of the principal applications and motivations for the spherical transform was Selberg's trace formula. The classical Poisson summation formula combines the Fourier inversion formula on a vector group with summation over a cocompact lattice. In Selberg's analogue of this formula, the vector group is replaced by "G"/"K", the Fourier transform by the spherical transform and the lattice by a cocompact (or cofinite) discrete subgroup. The original paper of implicitly invokes the spherical transform; it was who brought the transform to the fore, giving in particular an elementary treatment for SL(2,R) along the lines sketched by Selberg.
Spherical functions.
Let "G" be a semisimple Lie group and "K" a maximal compact subgroup of "G". The Hecke algebra 
"C"c("K" \"G"/"K"), consisting of compactly supported "K"-biinvariant continuous functions on "G", acts by convolution on the Hilbert space "H"="L"2("G" / "K"). Because "G" / "K" is a symmetric space, this *-algebra is commutative. The closure of its (the Hecke algebra's) image in the operator norm is a non-unital commutative C* algebra formula_1, so by the Gelfand isomorphism can be identified with the continuous functions vanishing at infinity on its spectrum "X". Points in the spectrum are given by continuous *-homomorphisms of formula_1 into C, i.e. characters of formula_1.
If "S"' denotes the commutant of a set of operators "S" on "H", then formula_4 can be identified with the commutant of the regular representation of "G" on "H". Now formula_1 leaves invariant the subspace "H"0 of "K"-invariant vectors in "H". Moreover the abelian von Neumann algebra it generates on "H"0 is maximal Abelian. By spectral theory, there is an essentially unique measure μ on the locally compact space "X" and a unitary transformation "U" between "H"0 and "L"2("X", μ) which carries the operators in formula_1 onto the corresponding multiplication operators. 
The transformation "U" is called the spherical Fourier transform or sometimes just the spherical transform and μ is called the Plancherel measure. The Hilbert space "H"0 can be identified with "L"2("K"\"G"/"K"), the space of "K"-biinvariant square integrable functions on "G".
The characters χλ of formula_1 (i.e. the points of "X") can be described by positive definite spherical functions φλ on "G", via the formula
for "f" in "C"c("K"\"G"/"K"), where π("f") denotes the convolution operator in formula_1 and the integral is with respect to Haar measure on "G". 
The spherical functions φλ on "G" are given by Harish-Chandra's formula:
In this formula:
It follows that 
Spherical principal series.
The spherical function φλ can be identified with the matrix coefficient of the spherical principal series of "G". If "M" is the centralizer of "A" in "K", this is defined as the unitary representation πλ of "G" induced by the character of "B" = "MAN" given by the composition of the homomorphism of "MAN" onto "A" and the character λ.
The induced representation is defined on functions "f" on "G" with
for "b" in "B" by
where 
The functions "f" can be identified with functions in L2("K" / "M") and 
As proved, the representations of the spherical principal series are irreducible and two representations πλ and 
πμ are unitarily equivalent if and only if μ = σ(λ) for some σ in the Weyl group of "A".
Example: SL(2,C).
The group "G" = SL(2,C) acts transitively on the quaternionic upper half space
by Möbius transformations. The complex matrix
acts as
The stabiliser of the point j is the maximal compact subgroup "K" = SU(2), so that formula_19 = "G" / "K".
It carries the "G"-invariant Riemannian metric
with associated volume element
and Laplacian operator
Every point in formula_19 can be written as "k"("e""t"j) with "k" in SU(2) and "t" determined up to a sign.
The Laplacian has the following form on functions invariant under SU(2), regarded as functions of the real parameter "t":
The integral of an SU(2)-invariant function is given by
Identifying the square integrable SU(2)-invariant functions with L2(R) by the unitary transformation "Uf"("t") = "f"("t") sinh "t", Δ is transformed into the operator
By the Plancherel theorem and Fourier inversion formula for R, any SU(2)-invariant function "f" can be expressed in terms of the spherical functions
by the spherical transform
and the spherical inversion formula
Taking formula_30 with "f""i" in Cc("G" / "K") and formula_31, and evaluating at "i" yields the "Plancherel formula"
For biinvariant functions this establishes the Plancherel theorem for spherical functions: the map
is unitary and sends the convolution operator defined by formula_34 L1("K" \ "G" / "K") into the multiplication operator defined by formula_35. 
The spherical function Φλ is an eigenfunction of the Laplacian:
Schwartz functions on R are the spherical transforms of functions "f" belonging to the Harish-Chandra Schwartz space
By the Paley-Wiener theorem, the spherical transforms of smooth SU(2)-invariant functions of compact support are precisely
functions on R which are restrictions of holomorphic functions on C satisfying an exponential growth condition
As a function on "G", Φλ is the matrix coefficient of the spherical principal series defined on L2(C), where C is identified with the boundary of formula_19. The representation is given by the formula
The function 
is fixed by SU(2) and
The representations πλ are irreducible and unitarily equivalent only when the sign of λ is changed. 
The map "W" of formula_43 onto L2([0,∞) xC) (with measure λ2 "d"λ on the first factor) given by
is unitary and gives the decomposition of formula_43 as a direct integral of the spherical principal series.
Example: SL(2,R).
The group "G" = SL(2,R) acts transitively on the Poincaré upper half plane
by Möbius transformations. The complex matrix
acts as
The stabiliser of the point i is the maximal compact subgroup "K" = SO(2), so that formula_49 = "G" / "K".
It carries the "G"-invariant Riemannian metric
with associated area element
and Laplacian operator
Every point in formula_19 can be written as "k"( "e""t" i ) with "k" in SO(2) and "t" determined up to a sign. The Laplacian has the following form on functions invariant under SO(2), regarded as functions of the real parameter "t":
The integral of an SO(2)-invariant function is given by
There are several methods for deriving the corresponding eigenfunction expansion for this ordinary differential equation including: 
The second and third technique will be described below, with two different methods of descent: the classical one due Hadamard, familiar from treatments of the heat equation and the wave equation on hyperbolic space; and Flensted-Jensen's method on the hyperboloid.
Hadamard's method of descent.
If "f"("x","r") is a function on formula_49 and 
then
where Δ"n" is the Laplacian on formula_59.
Since the action of SL(2,C) commutes with Δ3, the operator
"M"0 on S0(2)-invariant functions obtained by averaging "M"1"f" by the action of SU(2)
also satisfies
The adjoint operator "M"1* defined by
satisfies
The adjoint "M"0*, defined by averaging "M"*"f" over SO(2), satisfies
for SU(2)-invariant functions "F" and SO(2)-invariant functions "f". It follows that
The function 
is SO(2)-invariant and satisfies
On the other hand 
since the integral can be computed by integrating formula_68 around the rectangular 
indented contour with vertices at ±"R" and ±"R" + πi. Thus the eigenfunction
satisfies the normalisation condition φλ("i") = 1. There can only be
one such solution either because the Wronskian of the ordinary differential equation
must vanish or by expanding as a power series in sinh "r".
It follows that
Similarly it follows that
If the spherical transform of an SO(2)-invariant function on formula_49 is defined by
then 
Taking "f"="M"1*"F", the SL(2,C) inversion formula for "F" immediately yields
the spherical inversion formula for SO(2)-invariant functions on formula_49.
As for SL(2,C), this immediately implies the Plancherel formula for "f"i in Cc(SL(2,R) / SO(2)):
The spherical function φλ is an eigenfunction of the Laplacian:
Schwartz functions on R are the spherical transforms of functions "f" belonging to the Harish-Chandra Schwartz space
The spherical transforms of smooth SO(2)-invariant functions of compact support are precisely
functions on R which are restrictions of holomorphic functions on C satisfying an exponential growth condition
Both these results can be deduced by descent from the corresponding results for SL(2,C), 
by verifying directly that the spherical transform satisfies the given growth conditions and then using the relation formula_81.
As a function on "G", φλ is the matrix coefficient of the spherical principal series defined on L2(R), where R is identified with the boundary of formula_49. The representation is given by the formula
The function 
is fixed by S0(2) and
The representations πλ are irreducible and unitarily equivalent only when the sign of λ is changed. 
The map "W" of formula_86 onto L2([0,∞) xR), with measure 
on the first factor, is given by the formula
is unitary and gives the decomposition of formula_86 as a direct integral of the spherical principal series.
Flensted–Jensen's method of descent.
Hadamard's method of descent relied on functions invariant under the action of 1-parameter subgroup of translations in the "y" parameter in 
formula_19. Flensted–Jensen's method uses the centraliser of SO(2) in SL(2,C) which splits as a direct product of SO(2) 
and the 1-parameter subgroup "K"1 of matrices
The symmetric space SL(2,C)/SU(2) can be identified with the space H3 of positive 2×2 matrices "A" with determinant 1 
with the group action given by 
Thus
So on the hyperboloid formula_95, "g""t" only changes the coordinates "y" and "a". Similarly the action of SO(2) acts by rotation on the coordinates ("b","x") leaving "a" and "y" unchanged. The space H2 of real-valued positive matrices "A" with "y" = 0 can be identified with the orbit of the identity matrix under SL(2,R). Taking coordinates ("b","x","y") in H3 and ("b","x") on H2 the volume and area elements are given by
where "r"2 equals "b"2 + "x"2 + "y"2 or "b"2 + "x"2,
so that "r" is related to hyperbolic distance from the origin by formula_97. 
The Laplacian operators are given by the formula
where 
and
For an SU(2)-invariant function "F" on H3 and an SO(2)-invariant function on H2, regarded as
functions of "r" or "t",
If "f"("b","x") is a function on H2, "Ef" is defined by
Thus
If "f" is SO(2)-invariant, then, regarding "f" as a function of "r" or "t",
On the other hand
Thus, setting "Sf"("t") = "f"(2"t"), 
leading to the fundamental "descent relation" of Flensted-Jensen for "M"0 = "ES":
The same relation holds with "M"0 by "M", where "Mf" is obtained by averaging "M"0"f" over SU(2).
The extension "Ef" is constant in the "y" variable and therefore invariant under the transformations "g""s". On the other hand for
"F" a suitable function on H3, the function "QF" defined by
is independent of the "y" variable. A straightforward change of variables shows that
Since "K"1 commutes with SO(2), "QF" is SO(2)--invariant if "F" is, in particular if "F" is SU(2)-invariant. In this case "QF" is a function of "r" or "t", so that "M"*"F" can be defined by
The integral formula above then yields 
and hence, since for "f" SO(2)-invariant,
the following adjoint formula:
As a consequence
Thus, as in the case of Hadamard's method of descent.
with 
and 
It follows that
Taking "f"="M"*"F", the SL(2,C) inversion formula for "F" then immediately yields
Abel's integral equation.
The spherical function φλ is given by
so that
Thus
so that defining "F" by
the spherical transform can be written
The relation between "F" and "f" is classically inverted by the Abel integral equation:
In fact
The relation between "F" and formula_35 is inverted by the Fourier inversion formula:
Hence
This gives the spherical inversion for the point "i". Now for fixed "g" in SL(2,R) define
another rotation invariant function on formula_49 with "f"1(i)="f"("g"("i")). On the other hand for biinvariant functions "f",
so that
where "w" = "g"("i"). Combining this with the above inversion formula for "f"1 yields the general spherical inversion formula:
Other special cases.
All complex semisimple Lie groups or the Lorentz groups SO0("N",1) with "N" odd can be treated directly by reduction to the usual Fourier transform. The remaining real Lorentz groups can be deduced by Flensted-Jensen's method of descent, as can other semisimple Lie groups of real rank one. Flensted-Jensen's method of descent also applies to the treatment of real semisimple Lie groups for which the Lie algebras are normal real forms of complex semisimple Lie algebras. The special case of SL(N,R) is treated in detail in ; this group is also the normal real form of SL(N,C).
The approach of applies to a wide class of real semisimple Lie groups of arbitrary real rank and yields the explicit product form of the Plancherel measure on formula_135* without using Harish-Chandra's expansion of the spherical functions φλ
in terms of his c-function, discussed below. Although less general, it gives a simpler approach to the Plancherel theorem for this class of groups.
Complex semisimple Lie groups.
If "G" is a complex semisimple Lie group, it is the complexification of its maximal compact subgroup "U", a compact semisimple Lie group. If formula_136 and formula_137 are their Lie algebras, then
Let "T" be a maximal torus in "U" with Lie algebra formula_139. Then setting
there is the Cartan decomposition:
The finite-dimensional irreducible representations πλ of "U" are indexed by certain λ in formula_142. The corresponding character formula and dimension formula of Hermann Weyl give explicit formulas for 
These formulas, initially defined on formula_144 and formula_142, extend holomorphic to their 
complexifications. Moreover
where "W" is the Weyl group formula_147 and δ("e""X") is given by a product formula (Weyl's denominator formula) which extends holomorphically to the complexification of
formula_139. There is a similar product formula for "d"(λ), a polynomial in λ.
On the complex group "G", the integral of a "U"-biinvariant function "F" can be evaluated as
where formula_150. 
The spherical functions of "G" are labelled by λ in formula_151 and given by the Harish-Chandra-Berezin formula
They are the matrix coefficients of the irreducible spherical principal series of "G" induced from the character of the Borel subgroup of "G" corresponding to λ; these representations are irreducible and can all be realized on L2("U" / "T").
The spherical transform of a "U"-biinvariant function "F" is given by

Plot.
Humanity has undergone radical changes in society. Scientists and spiritual leaders became one and the same, calling themselves Spirits. The Spirits, foreseeing the inevitable destruction of Earth due to the ravages of our time, directed scientific efforts into the discovery of a new plane of existence: the Psychosphere. The Psychosphere acted as a conduit, providing means to reach another, untouched world, a new Promised Land, by jumping between flat worlds within the Psychosphere. The Psychosphere is appropriately named, as the various worlds resemble the thoughts and actions that have occurred upon Earth during its history. The Spirits then embarked upon the construction of massive floating city-ships called Frames, which could house hundreds of thousands of people for an indefinite period of time. With the Frames completed, the Spirits sent them forth into the Psychosphere with the intent to lead their people to the Promised Land, leaving Earth behind forever.
Within each of the Frames, the Spirits formed Spirit Councils which exercised absolute authority in all matters relating to the Frame. The general populace were kept sedate and forced into a ritualistic spiritualism to control their minds, for it was soon discovered that the Psychosphere reacted to negative emotions; causing creatures known as Scourge to erupt out of the very ground and attack the Frames. Eventually, some of the citizens of the Frames began to revolt against the rule of the Spirit Council, and the Frames began to separate into three factions: the Exodus who continued to follow the guidance of the Spirits and seek the Promised Land, the Harkback who reject the rule of the Spirits and seek to return to Earth, and the Empire who reject the Spirits, the idea of the Promised Land, and Earth, seeking to establish a cybernetic Human empire within the Psychosphere itself.
As the game progresses, the various factions come into contact, and eventually combat, with one another's Frames and with the Scourge. Exodus continues to move through the Chain of Worlds to its very end; Harkback move to the Root Worlds at the very beginning of the Chain, and the Empire tries to dominate both sides. Ultimately Exodus destroys the primary Imperial Frame near a portal to the Promised Land, and then move through the portal. Meanwhile, the Harkback find the Root Worlds and a portal back to Earth, also moving through. However, both factions end up near one another on the Promised Land, which appears to be Earth as it was millions of years ago. This sets the scene for the game's sequel.
Critical reception.
"Perimeter" has received praise for its innovation in the real-time strategy genre, with the use of terraforming and morphing units. "Game Informer"s reviewer called it "an enjoyable play, albeit a slightly rough one", and gave it a score of 7.75 out of 10. He praised its innovative concepts and said that the game "has a strategy all its own", but criticized its lack of polish: "Unit AI is often wretched, enemy AI is worse, and framerate suffers during camera pans or intense battles even on a beastly PC". He concluded, however, that its "cool concepts, excellent graphics, and good mission design save it", and that "the new ideas alone make it worth a look".
The use of terraforming terrain to expand the player's base makes the land itself the primary resource, providing a different dynamic to other RTS titles. The system of networking energy extractors across the terraformed land was seen to work well in skirmish and multiplayer games, in which cut-off sections can be taken over. The ability to morph different combinations of basic units into a larger variety of more powerful units was seen as being handled creatively, reducing the need to build a large army whilst retaining a rock-paper-scissors dynamic.
Criticisms include the fractured nature of the storyline (with the player campaign frequently switching between the factions), the lack of challenge in fighting the scourge and their lacklustre artificial intelligence, with missions against other "frames" often being reduced to a war of attrition due to their use of the perimeter shield.

Billy Murphy (footballer)

William "Billy" Murphy (23 May 1893 – 7 January 1962), often known as Spud Murphy, was an English footballer who played as a winger for Manchester City, Southampton, Oldham Athletic and Tranmere Rovers.
A runner in his youth, Murphy became an amateur footballer when the outbreak of the First World War caused his running club to disband. In 1918 he signed amateur terms with First Division Manchester City, turning professional when competitive football resumed after the war. He made 220 appearances for the club, before joining Southampton in 1926. He stayed on the south coast for three seasons, before returning to the north-west where he had spells with Oldham Athletic and Tranmere Rovers.
Early career.
Born in St Helens, Lancashire, Murphy's speed gave him local renown in his youth, when he became known among pigeon keepers for the haste with which he reported the arrivals of birds. He was also a talented cross country runner, running for the Peasley Cross Harriers club. The club was disbanded at the start of the First World War, and Murphy turned his attention to football.
Football career.
Manchester City.
He signed for Manchester City from Alexandra Victoria on 2 February 1918, as an amateur. He made several appearances for the club in the wartime Lancashire League, including an appearance against Everton in which he scored in the first minutes to consign "the Toffeemen" to their first defeat of the season. When competitive football returned after the end of the war, Murphy turned professional, making his league debut against Bolton Wanderers on 13 September 1919, and a further 37 appearances that season. In the 1919–20 season, Murphy scored nine goals in 41 appearances as Manchester City finished as runner-up in the league. his performances resulted in interest from the Irish Football Association, who prompted by Murphy's Irish-sounding surname wrote to enquire about his birthplace. In his reply, Manchester City manager Ernest Mangnall wrote "He comes from St Helens, where the pills come from".
Murphy was a regular on the Manchester City left wing for six seasons, but by 1925–26 he was no longer first choice, making only nine appearances, and on 18 August 1926, having scored 31 goals in 220 appearances for Manchester City, he joined Southampton for £350.
Southampton.
Murphy was brought to the south coast by new manager Arthur Chadwick and, by Christmas 1926, prospects looked good as the Saints were only two points behind the Division Two leaders, with Murphy linking up well with centre forward Bill Rawlings. A reporter for the local newspaper described Murphy as ""cute, quick and clever"". The New Year saw a slump in the team's performances and by the end of the season they had fallen back to 13th place in the table. They did, however, have a good run in the FA Cup, reaching the semi-finals where they went out to Arsenal, with Murphy appearing in all the cup matches. In the 1926–27 season, in which he linked up well with Sam Taylor and Stan Woodhouse on the left, Murphy only missed one league match, scoring four goals.
The following season saw Murphy continuing on the left-wing until early March when he lost his place to Stan Cribb. Although he regained his place for the start of the 1928–29 season, Cribb once again replaced him and Murphy only made the occasional appearance before being released at the end of the season, with Saints having recruited Johnny Arnold to fill the left wing position.
In his time with the Saints, Murphy made a total of 81 appearances, scoring nine goals.
Later career.
After leaving the Dell he joined Oldham Athletic for £100, with Reg Watson going in the opposite direction. He spent one season at Oldham, before joining his final league club Tranmere Rovers, after which he joined non-league Ellesmere Port Town.
He died in January 1962, aged 66.

This hotel is known today as Sukhdham hotel. The house is surrounded by a mango orchard, coconut plantation of about . He also planted about 400 alphonso mango trees nearby which is now in the vicinity of Ultratech Cement plant, and Finloex colony.
His son Mr. Shantaram ran a dairy business from this place. Today the wife of Late Mr. Shantaram, Padma Natekar, resides in this house along with her nephew Madhav Devasthali and his family. Madhav is also popularly known as Bandya in Ratnagiri.
He is a business man having interests in Mango plantations, authorised distributor for number of companies like GE, L&T. He is also actively involved in social activities. 
Mr. Madhav is associated with Patit Pavan Mandir, which was built by Late Vinayak Damodar Savarkar commonly addressed as Veer Savarkar (वीर सावरकर, "Brave Savarkar")or Swatantrya Veer Savarkar. The place must be proudly mentioned as a landmark in the social history of India as it was the first mandir where Dalits and Untouchable at that time were allowed to enter the temple freely.

Dracoglossum

Dracoglossum is a small genus of ferns in the family Lomariopsidaceae. It is native to the neotropics of the Americas. 
"Dracoglossum" was originally treated in "Tectaria", but is not related and was therefore described in family Dryopteridaceae. It appears to be most closely related to the genus "Lomariopsis".
The species differ in the presence or absence of an indusium covering each of their sori. "Dracoglossum" has a creeping rhizome. The leaves are simple and proliferate by vegetative buds (leaf buds) at the apex.

Boogie rock

Boogie rock is a music genre which came out of the hard heavy blues rock of the late 1960s. It tends to feature a repetitive driving rhythm in place of instrumental experimentation found in the more progressive blues-rock bands of the period.
Definitions.
Boogie rockers concentrate on the groove, working a steady, chugging back beat, often in shuffle time.
History.
One of the first bands to popularize boogie rock worldwide was Canned Heat. Boogie rock reached the height of its popularity in the mid to late 1970s.
Many US boogie rock bands have a southern twang, like Canned Heat, ZZ Top, The Allman Brothers Band, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and George Thorogood & The Destroyers. The American rock band Kansas was also known for its unique blend of progressive rock and boogie rock, especially on their self-titled debut album. The Canadian band Bachman-Turner Overdrive also popularized a style of heavy, danceable boogie rock in the mid-1970s. 
British bands include Status Quo, Humble Pie, Savoy Brown, Foghat, T-Rex, Spider and Engine. Status Quo became, from the early 1970s the most significant British boogie rock band.

Gevingåsen Tunnel

Gevingåsen Tunnel is a single track railway tunnel between Hommelvik and Hell, Norway, on the Nordland Line. Blasting started in 2009, and the tunnel opened on 15 August 2011, having cost 635 million Norwegian krone (NOK). Built by the Norwegian National Rail Administration, the tunnel has shortened travel time south of Stjørdal by five minutes and increased the capacity of the Trondheim–Stjørdal to four trains per hour in each direction. 
The tunnel was the first stage in a project to reduce travel time between Steinkjer and Trondheim to one hour. The tunnel section will not be suitable for high-speed trains, as it was built with curves with too small a diameter, notwithstanding political debate about both these tight curves and the possibility of double track. The whole project involved of new tracks and permanent way. The blasted rock is used to build a new apron at Trondheim Airport, Værnes.
Background.
The tunnel was built between Hommelvik and Hell on the Nordland Line, through the hill Gevingåsen. The tunnel is long, although the whole project consists of of track. The tunnel carries a single track, reducing travel time by five minutes. It has also created the same distance between all passing loops between Trondheim and Stjørdal, allowing the capacity to increase from 5.4 to 8 trains per hour (both directions combined). The old right-of-way, located on a ledge over the sea and prone to landslides, is to be closed. In addition, 92 houses are projected to enjoy reduced noise pollution after the closing. Gevingsåsen was the first part of the plan to reduce rail travel time from Trondheim to Steinkjer to one hour. Politicians have suggested that after the tunnel is completed, they want to electrify the tracks from Trondheim to Steinkjer. The E6 motorway runs parallel through Gevingåsen in the Hell Tunnel.
Construction.
Construction of the tunnel was done by drilling and blasting. During planning, use of a tunnel boring machine was considered, but the conventional drilling and blasting method was chosen because it was both cheaper and faster. At Hommelvik, the new section of track starts at the river of Homla, where it will run in a curve towards the tunnel entrance at Solbakken. Just within the entrance, there will be built a pool and pump to collect surface water. A crosscut is located at Muruvik, close to the quarry. At this point it is to the tunnel and blasting will be performed in both directions from the tunnel's interception with the crosscut. Muruvik will also serve as the operational hub; transport of the masses to the airport will run along the old E6. The third point of entry for blasting is the entrance at Hell. The works include replacing the level crossing at Hell Station with an overpass.
The builder is the Norwegian National Rail Administration, and construction of the tunnel is financed through state funding, with the project costing NOK 635 million. The construction will be undertaken at the same time as Avinor is expanding the nearby Trondheim Airport, Værnes, and the spoil from the tunnel will be used to build a new apron. Planning of the tunnel was completed at the end of 2008. The tender for construction was completed in March 2009, and won by Mika. The construction will extract of blasted rock, that is transported out of the tunnel. The last blast was detonated on 12 August 2010, completing the tunneling proper on time and on budget without injuries. The first revenue train ran through the tunnel on 15 August 2011. But because schedules only change twice a year, the time saving cannot be incorporated until 2012. Further plans include building a second track at Trondheim Airport Station. Due to the capacity increase created by the tunnel, this will allow dedicated airport trains to operate from Trondheim.
Controversy.
The Trøndelag Council, an unofficial coordination council consisting of representatives from Nord-Trøndelag County Municipality, Sør-Trøndelag County Municipality and Trondheim Municipality, originally stated that they wanted a double-track tunnel. In 2006, the Norwegian National Rail Administration stated that it was not certain that a double-track in a single tunnel would meet European Union regulations, and that they might have to delay construction while looking into the matter. Costs for a double track would be about 50% higher than for a single track. Constructing a second barrel later for the a new track would cost as much as the first barrel. Trøndelag Council member Alf Daniel Moen (Labour) stated that the council abandoned the demand for a double-track tunnel so the airport expansion and tunnel construction could be coordinated and because there was not sufficient funding at the time to build both tracks. 
The tunnel has raised criticism for not being in line with the goals to build a high-speed railway in Trøndelag. This plan requires double track from Trondheim to Stjørdal, but such a solution through the tunnel has been disregarded. Norsk Bane, which is working on plans for a high-speed rail from Oslo to Steinkjer, has criticized the tunnel route for having curves that are too tight. With a radius of , this will only allow at Hommelvik Station and at Hell Station. So although the tunnel itself is straight enough to allow speeds of , limitations at both ends of the tunnel will not allow trains to reach a higher maximum speed of and an average speed of more than . Because of this, Gevingåsen Tunnel would not be able to allow high speeds, defined by parliament as minimum , and could not be part of a future high-speed line north of Trondheim. Norsk Bane stated that part of the cause is that although the National Rail Administration has plans to build a high-speed line from Trondheim to Steinkjer, no complete plans, nor any plans for the trackage on either side of the tunnel, have been made.
In January 2009, just before construction commenced, the Nord-Trøndelag County Cabinet, fronted by Chair Alf Daniel Moen and Councilor of Transport Tor Erik Jensen (Conservative), stated that they did not want the tunnel to run along its planned route, but instead a less curved line that would allow it to be used as a high-speed line in the future. This was rejected by the Ministry of Transport and Communications, who stated that they were building a "modern railway for the future".
It could be added that most trains are regional trains which stop in both Hell and Hommelvik. For them high-speed curves are meaningless.

George Travers (rugby player)

George "Twyber" Travers (9 June 1877 – 26 December 1945) was a Welsh international hooker who played club rugby for Pill Harriers and Newport Rugby Football Club. He won 25 caps for Wales between 1903 and 1911.
Travers is seen as one of the rugby union's first specialist hookers. Specialism in a forward position was unusual during the early history of rugby mainly due to the scrummaging rule, but Travers's ability shone through and as part of a seven-man pack was important in the Welsh wins against England in 1903 and against the All Blacks in 1905. Travers originally played club rugby for the Newport Docks-based side Pill Harriers, though he would later spend two seasons with Newport in 1901/02 and 1910/11.
International career.
Travers was first capped, at centre, making his debut against England in January, 1903 while playing for Pill Harriers. Although it was unusual at the time for unfashionable "second-class" clubs to supply international players, it was not unprecedented, with valley teams such as Treorchy and Treherbert supplying several forwards. He would play for Wales a further 24 times including games against the original New Zealand team, South Africa and Australia. In 1908 Travers was awarded the Welsh captaincy against Scotland at Swansea a game Wales would win 6-5, though this was the only time he would hold this honour. His only international points were against the Australian Wallabies, a game Wales won 9-6, though it has been later recognised by both sides that Travers dropped the ball before going over the line and the try should not have counted.

Northern line extension to Battersea

The Northern line extension to Battersea is a planned extension of the London Underground Northern line to Battersea in South West London, from to the disused Battersea Power Station. The extension will form a continuation of the branch of the line.
The extension is a partially privately funded project by the site developers, SP Setia and Sime Darby, with contributions from other sources such as the proposed new US Embassy. Subject to permission from the Secretary of State for Transport to build and operate the extension and the required funding being in place, construction could begin in 2015, and the extension could be open by 2020. Battersea will be the new southern terminus, with a new station at Nine Elms on Wandsworth Road. Both new stations will be in Travelcard Zone 2.
Provision will be made for a possible future onward connection to Clapham Junction railway station by reserving a path running beneath Battersea Park.
History.
A May 2010 consultation put forward four proposals (two with slightly different locations for Nine Elms station, one with an interchange at station for the Victoria line, and one with a direct link with no intermediate station). In the light of the results of the route option consultation, Transport for London decided to develop a route involving two new tube stations, one at Nine Elms, next to the junction of Wandsworth Road and Pascal Street, at a site currently used as a car park for the Nine Elms branch of Sainsbury's, and one serving Battersea Power Station.
In addition to serving the mostly residential communities, Nine Elms station will also provide improved access for the nearby New Covent Garden Market and the proposed new US Embassy.
Major landowners and council leaders in London's Nine Elms area said in November 2010 that the extension could be funded largely from developer contributions and would provide an economic windfall for the entire Nine Elms regeneration area. At the inaugural meeting of the Nine Elms and Vauxhall Strategy Board, members were told that a study commissioned by the Greater London Authority had put the total cost for the new link at £560 million. Financing of the extension has been aided by the fact that the developers of the area have been made exempt from the Crossrail Levy and instead are required to pay towards the extension.
On 11 November 2010, Wandsworth Council granted planning permission for the development of the Battersea Power Station site, and this permission was then approved by the Mayor of London on 22 December 2010. Although the plans included a two station extension of the Northern Line from Kennington, the extension itself will be the subject of a separate planning process. 
In June 2012, the Battersea Power Station site was sold to a Malaysian consortium, SP Setia and Sime Darby, following the bankruptcy of the former owner Real Estate Opportunities.
In November 2012, Transport for London launched a consultation on their preferred route option, giving people living in the area a chance to submit their views. 
In December 2012, the Treasury confirmed that it will provide a guarantee that allows the Greater London Authority to borrow up to £1 billion from the Public Works Loan Board, at a preferential rate, to finance the construction of the line.
In April 2013, Transport for London applied for the legal powers of a Transport and Works Act Order to proceed with the extension.
On 19 November 2013, the Secretary of State for Transport announced the start of a public inquiry into the proposed construction of the extension. The inquiry was expected to last for around four weeks.

Nigel Cox (doctor)

Dr Nigel Leigh Cox (born 1945) is a British consultant rheumatologist and one of the few doctors in Britain to have been charged with attempted murder. In 1992 he was convicted of the attempted murder of patient Lillian Boyes, and received a suspended sentence.
Career.
Cox worked at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital, Winchester, England.
Lillian Boyes.
In 1991 Lillian Boyes, then 70, entered the Royal Hampshire County Hospital. Cox was her consultant and had been treating Boyes for 13 years. As her rheumatoid arthritis became worse, she pleaded with him to end her life. According to the hospital chaplain, 'When anyone touched her you could hear the bones move about in their joints. The sound will stay with me to the grave'.
In August 1991, he administered an injection of two ampoules of potassium chloride, in order to stop her heart. After she died, Patrick, one of her sons, thanked Cox. In Cox's view, he probably shortened her life by "between 15 minutes and an hour."
Cox entered the amount used in the hospital log - twice the amount needed to cause death. It was then noticed by a nurse, who reported it. Cox signed the cause of death as having been bronchial pneumonia.
Cox was arrested for attempted murder and suspended for 18 months by the hospital, though he was allowed to teach at another hospital and continue his private practice.
Trial.
Cox was tried at Winchester Crown Court in September 1992 by Mr Justice Ognall. Cox was charged with attempted murder, since it was impossible to conclusively prove that the injection he gave killed her. He was given a 12-month suspended sentence. Boyes' family supported his actions throughout the trial.
Post-trial career.
In November 1992, the professional conduct committee of the General Medical Council decided to take no further action. Cox returned to his former job in February 1993, under supervision.

Good Morning Scotland

Good Morning Scotland is a Scottish breakfast radio news programme. It is broadcast on BBC Radio Scotland weekdays from 06:00 to 08:45. Established in 1973, it is the longest-running radio show broadcast from Scotland and remains one of the most popular.
Based in many respects on BBC Radio 4's "Today" programme, it consists of regular news, sport, business, travel and weather bulletins along with interviews, in-depth reports and a daily religious slot "Thought for the Day".
History.
The programme was launched on the morning of 31 December 1973 with presenters David Findlay and John Milne.
In 1980, to celebrate 50 years of broadcasting from the BBC's Edinburgh studios at Queen Street, Good Morning Scotland was simulcast on BBC1 Scotland, pioneering breakfast television on the BBC (ITV station Yorkshire Television had broadcast a breakfast programme for six weeks during 1978 and thus laid claim to the first semi-regular British breakfast television broadcast).
Local variations.
The first half of the programme is also broadcast on BBC Scotland's Gaelic-language station, BBC Radio nan Gàidheal before its Gaelic counterpart "Aithris Na Maidne" begins at 07:30.
Listeners in Orkney opt-out between 07:30 and 08:00 for Around Orkney, a 30 minute magazine programme with features, local news and weather, diary, jobspot, mart report and postbag.
There are also local news opt-outs from Selkirk for the Scottish Borders, Dumfries for the South West, Aberdeen for the North East and Inverness for the Highlands.
"Morning Extra".
The programme was axed in 2010 and replaced with a phone-in, "Call Kaye", presented by Kaye Adams. The last programme of Morning Extra aired on 26 February.
