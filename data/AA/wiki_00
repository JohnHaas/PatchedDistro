Johan van Hell

Johannes "Johan" Gerardus Diederik van Hell (February 28, 1889 – December 31, 1952) was a Dutch visual artist and musician. He was a dedicated socialist and a man with a highly developed social conscience. Many of his later works depict the struggles and plight of ‘the man in the street’. In 1925 he decides to produce lithographs to make art available at a reasonable price to the working class. He also gives free private art and music lessons to gifted students who cannot afford the tuition. 
His art oeuvre is varied, ranging from oil paintings, water colours, wood cuts and lithographs to political posters, ex-libris and magazine and book covers and illustrations. He also receives regular commissions from the City of Amsterdam for monumental art.
His music is at least as important to him as his art. His instrument is the clarinet but he also plays the oboe. He regularly performs with Amsterdam’s Concertgebouw Orchestra but refuses a permanent position. In his last years his music takes precedence over his art.

Māris Martinsons (born July 25, 1960) is a Latvian film director, producer, screenwriter and film editor. From 1991 he has lived and worked in Lithuania, but moved back to his homeland Latvia in 2010.
Biography.
After graduating from the Latvia Conservatoires in 1989 as drama theatre director, Martinsons worked with Latvian musicians as an independent director/producer of music video clips. His first music video clip, "This is My Car" by the band Jumprava, was the first independent video in Latvia’s history and it received the best video award from in 1989/1990. Since 1991, Māris has lived in Lithuania, where together with a partner he founded the production company “ARTeta” (1994). ARTeta has become a leading production company and the biggest studio complex (300, 600 and 900 sq meters big pavilions) in the Baltic States.
In Lithuania Martinsons has worked in the TV field, produced over ten original TV series, creating TV series and videos, and often serving as both the director and author of these productions. Since 2005 he has participated in various workshops in Europe developing the skills in script writing, developing and marketing.
In 2006 Martinsons finally wrote a script for the arthouse movie "Loss". The script was written in Jaipur, preparation for the shooting was managed from Bangkok, the film was shot in Lithuania and Ireland, edited just when his third son was born and finished during his visit in Beijing. In January, 2008, the film was released in Lithuania. In June, 2008 film was selected for the Official Competition of the 11th Shanghai International Film Festival and it was awarded with 2 prizes: Best Director and Best Music.

"Amaya" has received a mixture of acclaim and criticism since its debut screening in Riga, Latvia on 14 September 2010. It was a Best Foreign Language Film nominee from Latvia for the 2011 Academy Awards (Oscars).

Fannia pusio

Fannia pusio (Wiedemann, 1830), known as the chicken dung fly is a fly species of the family Fanniidae (The leser house flies) that contains over 260 species of flies worldwide. Originally native to Central and North America, its distribution is now largely global, having been introduced with livestock. As its common name implies it can be very abundant at poultry facilities, resulting in considerable nuisance by their huge numbers. But the larvae will also feed on a wide variety of food, including rotting vegetable matter, excrement, fungi and carrion.

Kucheng Massacre

The Kucheng Massacre (; Pinyin: "Gǔtián Jiào'àn"; Foochow Romanized: "Kŭ-chèng Gáu-áng") was a massacre of Western Christians that took place at Gutian, Fujian, China on August 1, 1895. At dawn of that day, a Buddhist group, the Zhaijiao attacked British missionaries who were then taking summer holidays at Gutian Huashan, killing eleven people and destroying two houses. The Kucheng Massacre is considered one of the worst attacks against foreigners in China prior to the Boxer Movement in 1899-1901, the only comparable event in China's missonary history being the Tianjin Massacre in 1871.
Background.
In 1892, a Buddhist movement called Zhaijiao ("vegetarian school", so called because their followers took vows of vegetarianism) began assuming the functions of government due to the decrepit condition of Qing dynasty government in the Gutian region. They resolved disputes between villagers, banned opium, and ended the local practice of selling wives to multiple husbands. Gutian police decided not to intervene in this displacement of the functions of government. Christian missionaries were unhappy with these circumstances and asked the provincial officials to send in their own troops. In response, Zhaijiao leaders decided to defend their rebellion with violence. The last letter from the murdered English missionary Robert Warren Stewart, dated April 8, describes the critical situation of affairs at Gutian:
Events.
On August 1, 1895, at the time of the initial outbreak, the family of Robert W. Stewart and the other ladies were still asleep in their hill village at Gutian Huashan (华山). The Vegetarian mob then broke in, speared the victims to death, and burnt down the houses. Only five persons survived the attack, two of whom were Mr. Stewart's children: one had one knee broken, and the other, a baby, had an eye gouged out. Those murdered at Huashan were:
Aftermath.
The Qing government had suppressed the news for three days before an official telegraph was sent out from Shanghai on August 4. Western countries strongly condemned China for its connivance with the brutality and indignantly urged the guilty be punished. Under the pressure of foreign military force, the Qing government appointed a Commission of Enquiry consisting of both Chinese officials and British diplomats. All principals were soon executed, and other accessories were either banished or sentenced to life imprisonment. The supervisor of Gutian county Wang Rulin (王汝霖) was also dismissed from office.
Stephen Livingston Baldwin, Secretary of the Methodist Episcopal Missionary Society in China, commented on the massacre in an interview from "New York Times":
The newspapers also recommended that "Great Britain and the United States ... combine to teach the Chinese a lesson that will cause foreigners to be respected forever".
The bodies of the victims were buried at the mission cemetery of Fuzhou.

The third legitimate child of the duke and duchess of Dino, Dorothea von Biron and her husband Edmond de Talleyrand-Périgord, she is often thought to have in fact been fathered by Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord, prince of Bénévent. She grew up in Talleyrand's "hôtel particulier" on rue Saint-Florentin, was nicknamed "angel of the house" and "my dear Minette" by him, and held a great affection for him throughout her life.
In 1839, Pauline de Talleyrand-Périgord married Henri de Castellane, eldest son of the marshal de Castellane. Widowed in 1847, she spent the rest of her life at the château de Rochecotte (Indre-et-Loire), which she was given by her mother. A great friend of Félix Dupanloup, bishop of Orléans, she lived a simple and devout life.

Kawasaki GPZ1100 B1/B2

The Kawasaki GPz1100 B1 and B2 are motorcycles that were manufactured by Kawasaki in 1981 and 1982 respectively. Both models featured a four-cylinder, two-valve air-cooled engine design with a capacity of 1,089 cc producing in the B1 and in the B2. This engine was an evolution of the powerplant used in the previous Kz1000 series, itself descended from the Z1. In 1983 the GPz1100 was completely revamped in both cosmetic styling, suspension and updated engine. The model number changed to ZX1100A1.
Model differences.
Cosmetically, both the B1 and B2 were released in a bright red paint called "Firecracker Red", the B2 was also available in a gold colour called "Sonic Gold". The red colour theme was a departure from early colour schemes and started the marketing campaign called the "Red Revolution" featuring the 1100, 900, 750 and 550 models.
Handlebars.
The B1 had conventional 7/8" handlebars as found on all earlier Kawasaki "Z" series bikes, the B2 had clip on style handlebars that mounted to the top of the fork tube above the top triple clamp, this style then featured on the later ZX1100A models. This style was to continue to be the norm for most sports bikes, especially the Kawasaki GPZ900R series released in 1984.
Instruments.
The Instruments on the B1 used bulbs for all warning lights and featured a speedometer, tachometer, fuel gauge and voltage meter. The B2 instrument panel feature the speedometer and tachometer but the fuel gauge and most of the warning indicators were replaced with an LCD. The design change also changed the wiring harness and a number of electrical connectors in the front of the motorcycle changed. The speedometer on the B1 is electronic while the B2 is cable driven. The transducer appears to generate a pulse train that is converted to a voltage to feed the speedo meter.
Brakes.
The front disks of the B1 are 10 mm smaller in diameter and 1 mm thinner than the B2, the front calipers are also different but the disk brake pads are the same. The rear disks are identical in both models.
The front forks are slightly different between the two models. Both models feature air assistance,
but the B1 model uses an air valve located at the top of the fork leg while the B2 uses an equaliser
tube linking the two tube with a single air valve. By using an equaliser tube, each inner fork tube requires a small hole to allow the air in. The lower legs are different as the different brake disk diameter used on the two models require the mounting points to be different.
Fuel injection system.
Both the B1 and B2 featured Fuel Injection. The B1 model featured an EFI (electronic) system that was modelled on the 1980 z1000H and (also used in the 1980 z1000G model). This system was a hybrid car design using an air flap that had many reliability issues causing most owners to end up removing it and replace it with the 34mm Keihin CV carburettors used on all the later z1000 and z1100 models. The key problem with the EFI on the B1 was the use of an air-flap design rather than a MAP sensor used in modern systems and the early Throttle Position sensor (TPS) design registered only open or closed (idle) throttle positions. Later models (B2 and ZX1100A)featured DFI (digital) which used a variable TPS that accurately represented the throttle position and hence a better Electronic Control Unit (ECU) algorithm called Alpha-N.
On the B1 model, the four fuel injectors are mounted directly into the cylinder head above the inlet ports (hence the EFI system was referred to as port injection), while the B2/A (DFI) model had the more common Throttle Body Injection (TBI) where the injectors are mounted into the throttle bodies. With different throttle bodies comes a very slight difference in the air box mounting. The intake rubbers on the B1 are smaller than the B2 so a throttle body swap is not possible without replacing the inlet rubbers. They are also mounted at a 45 degree angle as the port injector openings are in the way.
Fuel system.
The fuel level sender units are physically different between the two models, this could be due to the different
methods used to report the fuel level (B1–gauge, B2–LCD). The B1 model has a fuel sender with a round tank mounting, the B2 has a rectangular mounting plate, therefore the tanks are different also. The DFI fuel delivery hardware appears to be the same. The 1983 model also uses the same fuel pump and TBI setup as the B2.
Body parts.
The B2 model featured a bikini fairing. This resulted in a change in a number of cosmetic covers and the addition of extra mounting brackets. Because of the bikini fairing, the headlight assembly is slightly different between the two models. The frames are basically the same with a few subtle differences in the fasteners used.
The tail light of the B2 features a reflector on each side of the rear lens. The internals of the lens are also different between the two models. The tail light lens feature identical mounting, so they can be interchanged. The B1 was only released in 1981 and the B2 in 1982, after that, the dual shock 1100 models ended and the monoshock GPz1100(ZX1100-A1) were released.

Pampero (wind)

The pampero is a burst of cold polar air from the west, southwest or south on the pampas in the south of Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay. This wind (often violently) picks up during the passage of a cold front of an active low passing by. It takes the form of a squall line and there is a marked drop in temperature after its passing. The Pampero is most common at winter in the southern hemisphere (principally between May and August). During the summers in the region around Buenos Aires, the "pampero" storms are a welcome feature marking the end of long periods of high humidity and extreme heat.

Ballinacurra ( meaning "Town of the Weir") is a small harbour village on the outskirts of Midleton, County Cork. It is about 20 miles east of Cork city.
The village lies at the confluence of the Owenacurra River and the east channel of Cork Harbour. It served as the port for the town of Midleton, which is less than 2km north of Ballinacurra, for centuries and became a loading and unloading point for coal, timber, iron and slate and later flax for the linen industry. 
The port of Ballinacurra closed in 1962 as it was deemed too expensive to dredge the growing levels of silt and mud at the entrance to the small harbour. It is now used almost exclusively for small leisure boats.

The 2008–09 IFA Premiership was the first season after a major overhaul of the league system in Northern Ireland. It was scheduled to begin on 9 August 2008. However, the start of the league was postponed for a week due to a referees' strike. The last games were played on 2 May 2009. Linfield were the defending champions.
Team changes from 2007–08.
The league was reduced from sixteen to twelve teams due to a competition restructuration by the Irish FA.
Five of last season's sixteen Premier League teams failed to gain a place in the new twelve-team Premiership, and one new team - Bangor - gained entry from the IFA Intermediate League.
Of the five teams who missed out, three - Armagh City, Larne and Limavady United failed to obtain the necessary domestic licence. Portadown obtained a licence, but was controversially excluded because a club official missed a deadline for submitting an application form by several minutes. Finally, Donegal Celtic obtained a licence, but was ranked thirteenth in the entry list, and thus missed out by one place.
Results.
Matches 1–22.
During matches 1–22 each team played every other team twice (home and away).
Matches 23–33.
During matches 23–33 each team played every other team for the third time (either at home, or away).

It's Alive (2008 film)

"It's Alive" is a 2009 straight-to-DVD remake of Larry Cohen's 1974 horror film of the same name.
Plot.
Just before the end of her semester at college, Lenore Harker (Bijou Phillips) leaves to have a baby with her architect boyfriend, Frank (James Murray) at his remote log cabin. After discovering the baby has doubled in size in just a month, doctors decide to extract the baby by caesarian section, although Frank is not present. As the doctor cuts the umbilical cord, the newborn goes on a rampage, killing every doctor and nurse in the operating room. When the film cuts back to the new mother, the baby is asleep on her stomach and the room is covered with blood.
After questioning by the police, Lenore is allowed to take the baby home. Authorities arrange for a psychologist to help her regain her memory of the delivery. Soon, baby Daniel bites Lenore when she’s feeding him, revealing his taste for blood.
Daniel begins to attack small animals and progressed to killing adult humans. Lenore refuses to accept that her baby is a cannibalistic killer. One day, Frank comes home from work to find Lenore sitting in the baby's room, but Daniel is not in his crib. Frank asks Lenore where Daniel is and finds a dead bird in the crib. Frank then goes in search of Daniel and winds up getting locked in the basement. The police find Frank, who witnesses Daniel kill a police officer. Frank then manages to capture Daniel, but is unable to bring himself to kill the baby. He is then attacked by his son. 
Lenore comes out to find Daniel and sees Frank is injured. She brings the baby back to the house, and it is implied she kills herself and the baby in a fire. Frank and his brother watch the house burn.
Release.
The film was officially released straight-to-DVD on October 6, 2009. It is available in both rated and unrated editions. The film had theatrical release in the Philippines in August 2009.
Reception.
Larry Cohen, the director of the 1974 original, was interviewed on December 21, 2009 regarding the remake and gave it a negative review, saying "It's a terrible picture. It's just beyond awful" and "I would advise anybody who likes my film to cross the street and avoid seeing the new enchilada."

Various origins of this name are proposed. It was highy possible that it has a same origin as the name of the Vedic god Varuna. It could also be a reconstruction of the Indo-European "mori" or Greek words for Black Sea, μόρυχος. A Hattic origin through the place name "Arianna" has also been suggested.

Born in Chicago, Illinois, he was an outfielder and third baseman who spent all or part of seven Major League seasons (1943–1946; 1948–1950) with the Chicago Cubs, Boston Red Sox, Chicago White Sox and Washington Senators. Listed at tall and , Ostrowski batted and threw right-handed.
Over his 216 MLB games played, Ostrowski was a .234 hitter (131-for-561) with 14 home runs and 74 RBI in 216 games, including 73 runs, 20 doubles, nine triples, seven stolen bases, and a .321 on-base percentage. However, in a 1,600-game minor league baseball career, Ostrowski hit 218 home runs and five times exceeded the 20-homer mark, including two 30 home run seasons.
Ostrowski died in Chicago at the age of 75.

Tropical theileriosis

Tropical theileriosis or Mediterranean theileriosis is a theileriosis of cattle from the Mediterranean and Middle East area, from Morocco to Western parts of India and China.
It is a tick-borne disease, caused by Theileria annulata. The vector ticks are of the genus "Hyalomma".
The most prominent symptoms are fever and lymph node enlargement. But there is a wide range of clinical manifestations, especially in enzootic areas. Among them, the Doukkala area of Morocco, where the epidemiology and symptomatology of the disease were minutely studied.  
The disease was once considered as "benign" in the literature, in comparison to East coast fever. But with the introduction of European breeds into the region, it could become of major economic incidence. 
An efficient treatment with parvaquone, then buparvaquone became available in many countries from the mid-1990s.
Animals native to endemic areas appear more tolerant to the disease, buffalos especially, appear less susceptible.
Clinical symptoms.
Body temperature is regularly higher than in any other cattle disease. Fever from 41 to 42°C is common in acute stages. Later on (day 5 to day 10 from the clinical onset), temperature will lower to a normal range (38.0–39.5°C), but the disease will continue to progress, despite a possible apparent clinical improvement (appetite comes back). Afterwards, from D10 to D15, there is a downfall stage, with hypothermia (37 to 38°C), anemia, jaundice, and heart failure. Such animals rarely recover, even with intensive treatment.
Lymph nodes are commonly enlarged and there may be episodes of blood from the nose, difficulty breathing and weight loss.
Other signs, but not present in all cases are :
Diagnosis.
Lymph node enlargement and even hyperthermia can occur asymptomatically in enzootic area, during the disease season.
Hence, diagnosis must be based on objective pathological signs like anorexia or drastic reduction of milk production in dairy cows.
Definitive diagnosis relies on the observation of the organism in blood smears. Lymph node aspirates can also be examined. Post-mortem examination, ELISA and PCR can also help diagnosis.
Treatment and control.
Buparvaquone, halofuginone and tetracycline have all shown to be effective. Tick control should be considered, but resistance to parasiticide products may be increasing. There are various options for controlling ticks of domestic animals, including: topical application of parasiticidal chemicals in dip baths or spray races or pour-on formulations, spraying parasiticides on walls of cattle pens, and rendering the walls of cattle pens smooth with mortar to stop ticks molting there. Selection of cattle for good ability to acquire immune resistance to ticks is potentially effective.
Endemic stability is a state where animals are affected at a low levels or not as susceptible to the disease, and this may be encouraged in endemic areas.
Vaccination is available and should be performed in breeds that are susceptible to infection.

Sport in Burkina Faso is widespread and includes football (soccer), basketball, cycling, Rugby union, handball, tennis, athletics, boxing and martial arts.
Football.
Football is very popular in Burkina Faso, played both professionally, and informally in towns and villages across the country. The national team is nicknamed "Les Etalons" ("the Stallions") in reference to the legendary horse of Princess Yennenga. In 1998, Burkina Faso hosted the African Cup of Nations for which the Omnisport Stadium in Bobo-Dioulasso was built.
Cycling.
Cycling is widespread both as a sport and as a cheap means of transport. The Tour du Faso, approved by the Fédération internationale de cyclisme, is a cycling event held annually in November. The stage race takes place at temperatures up to 40°C. It has been part of the UCI Africa Tour since 2005.
Olympic Games.
Burkina Faso has sent athletes to every Summer Olympic Games held since 1988. Under its previous name of Upper Volta, the country also competed in 1972. Despite appearing in six different Olympics, Burkina Faso has never won an Olympic medal. No athletes from Burkina Faso have competed in any Winter Olympic Games.

Suranimala

Suranimala was a Sinhalese soldier in the 2nd century BCE. He was the second in command of King Dutugemunu’s army, and among ten of his best warriors known as ten giant warriors. He made an immense contribution to King Dutugemunu's victory over King Elara. He is said to have been a highly skilled swordsman and his preferred weapon was a large sword.
Early life.
Named by his parents as Nimala, he was the youngest of seven children. His father was known as Samgha, the village headman of Khandakavitthika in Kotthivala. Although said to have had the strength equal to that of ten elephants, in his younger days Nimala preferred to stay idle at home while his brothers worked in the family’s paddy fields. When an order was issued by the King to send one male to serve in his army, Nimala’s brothers picked him to be sent, feeling that he was no use to the family. After joining a company south of the Mahaweli River under a prince named Digabhaya, Nimala was sent on an errand to deliver a message to a Brahmin. Having set off at dawn, Nimala is said to have finished the journey in a few hours, covering a distance of thirty four leagues. Astounded at this feat, the Brahmin had him sent to King Kavantissa to serve directly under him. After meeting the king, Nimala was ordered to sharpen some swords as a test, which he performed extremely well. The king was impressed by his skills, and Nimala was taken to serve under the king, and became one of the ten giant warriors who were the chief commanders and champions of the king’s army.
Being named as Suranimala.
After King Kavantissa’s death, his successor and son Dutugemunu began the war against the South Indian King Elara who was then in control of the Anuradhapura Kingdom. Elara’s forces were gradually defeated and Dutugemunu’s forces approached Anuradhapura, where the final battle would take place. As a test before the final battle, the king addressed his men and asked them men to drink from a large vessel of toddy. Seeing that none accepted this challenge, Nimala drank all the toddy emptied the vessel. After this incident he was known as "Suranimala", the word "sura" meaning liquor.
Battle of Vijithapura.
Suranimala played a key role in the decisive battle for one of King Elara’s last strongholds, the fortress of Vijithapura. Along with Nandimitra and the King’s elephant, he attacked the southern gate of the fortress. Not desiring to enter the fortress from the opening the Elephant had made, he leaped over the wall. Once inside, he is said to have fought the enemy using a large sword. He also defeated king Elara’s champion Dighajantu, thus saving Dutugemunu whom Dighajantu was seeking to kill. This event ultimately led to the retreat of king Elara’s forces and Elara’s death at the hands of Dutugemunu. At this final battle, Suranimala stood on king Dutugemunu's left, protecting him. Soon after the defeat of Elara, king Dutugemunu’s forces had to fight another battle against Bhalluka, a cousin of Elara. Suranimala along with the ten giants played a key part here as well.

119th Assault Helicopter Company

During the Vietnam War, one unit assigned to the 52nd Combat Aviation Battalion, 17th Combat Aviation Group, 1st Aviation Brigade was the 119th Assault Helicopter Company. The company operated throughout the Central Highlands of Vietnam during the war, from arrival in September 1962 until deactivation in November 1970. Originally designated the 81st Transportation Company (equipped with twin-rotor CH-21 "Flying Banana" piston-engined helicopters), the company was reorganized in 1963 as the 119th Assault Helicopter Company (Airmobile), re-equipped with turbine-powered single-rotor UH-1A and B model Hueys. Also known as the 119th Aviation Company (Assault Helicopter), the company's area of operations included the entire Central Highlands of Vietnam, plus large portions of Laos and Cambodia.
Eventually assigned to the 52nd Combat Aviation Battalion, 17th Combat Aviation Group, 1st Aviation Brigade and headquartered at Camp Holloway in Pleiku, the company was also based at An Khe for a short time from late in 1969 to 1970. The unit was attacked twice by NVA sappers while in An Khe, once in each year. The Company was equipped with 16 to 20 lightly armed UH-1 slicks, and by 1969 all UH-1Ds were upgraded to more-powerful UH-1H models and approximately 8 Huey UH-1C model Gunships. The "slick" troopships used the radio callsign "Alligator" or "Gator", the gunships used the callsign "Crocodiles" or "Crocs". The callsigns that the pilots used were atypical for US Army aviation units of the time, instead of standard callsigns such as "Blue four-one" or "Yellow six," the pilots used nicknames. Some nicknames were contemporary for the time, and others were semi-obscene. The company at one time also used the callsign called "Black Dragon," from which the 52nd CABn "Flying Dragon" callsign evolved. The total company strength of approximately 225 included 50 to 60 pilots and an equal number of crewmembers, plus field maintenance and other critical support personnel.
During over eight years in Vietnam, the 119th Assault Helicopter Company provided helicopter support for the US Army 4th Infantry Division, 25th Infantry Division, 1st Cavalry Division, 173d Airborne Brigade, US Marine Corps, United States Army Special Forces and the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. They also flew many classified missions for MACV-SOG. Over 60 members of the 119th Assault Helicopter Company were killed in action, with many more wounded.

Burgess Shale type fauna

A number of assemblages bear fossil assemblages similar in character to that of the Burgess Shale. While many are also preserved in a similar fashion to the Burgess Shale, the term "Burgess Shale type fauna" covers assemblages based on taxonomic criteria only.
Extent.
The fauna of the middle Cambrian has a cosmopolitan range. All assemblages preserving soft-part anatomy have a very similar fauna, even though they span almost every continent. The wide distribution has been attributed to the advent of pelagic larvae.
Composition.
The fauna is composed of a range of soft bodied organisms; creatures with hard, mineralised skeletons are rare, although trilobites are quite commonly found. The major soft-bodied groups are sponges, palaeoscolecid worms,
lobopods, arthropods and anomalocaridids. Assemblages are typically diverse, with the most famous localities each containing in the region of 150 described species.
The fauna of the Burgess Shale lived in the photic zone, as bottom-dwelling photosynthesisers are present in the assemblage.
Example faunas.
Sirius Passet fauna.
Sirius Passet is a lagerstätte in Greenland which was formed about 527 million years ago. Its most common fossils are arthropods, but there is only a handful of trilobite species. There are also very few species with hard parts: trilobites, hyoliths, sponges, brachiopods, and no echinoderms or molluscs.
"Halkieria" has features associated with more than one living phylum, and is discussed below.
The strangest-looking animals from Sirius Passet are "Pambdelurion" and "Kerygmachela". They are generally regarded as anomalocarids because they have long, soft, segmented bodies with a pair of broad fin-like flaps on most segments and a pair of segmented appendages at the rear. The outer parts of the top surfaces of the flaps have grooved areas which are thought to have acted as gills. Under each flap there is a short, fleshy leg. This arrangement suggests the animals are related to biramous arthropods.
Chengjiang fauna.
There are several Cambrian fossil sites in the Chengjiang county of China’s Yunnan province. The most significant is the Maotianshan shale, a lagerstätte which preserves soft tissues very well. The Chengjiang fauna date to between 525 million and 520 million years ago, about the middle of the early Cambrian epoch, a few million years after Sirius Passet and at least 10 million years earlier than the Burgess Shale.
The Chengjiang sediments provide what are currently the oldest known chordates, the phylum to which all vertebrates belong. The 8 chordate species include "Myllokunmingia", possibly a very primitive agnathid and "Haikouichthys", which may be related to lampreys. "Yunnanozoon" may be the oldest known hemichordate.
"Anomalocaris" was a mainly soft-bodied swimming predator which was gigantic for its time (up to 70 cm = 2¼ feet long; some later species were 3 times as long); the soft, segmented body had a pair of broad fin-like flaps along each side, except that the last 3 segments had a pair of “fans” arranged in a “V” shape. Unlike "Kerygmachela" and "Pambdelurion" (see above), "Anomalocaris" apparently had no legs, and the grooved patches which are thought to have acted as gills were at the bases of the flaps, or even overlapping on to its back. The two eyes were on relatively long horizontal stalks; the mouth lay under the head and was a round-cornered square of plates which could not close completely; and in front of the mouth were two jointed appendages which were shaped like a shrimp’s body, curved backwards and with short spines on the inside of the curve. "Amplectobelua", also found at Chengjiang, was similar, smaller than "Anomalocaris" but considerably larger than most other Chengjiang animals. Both are thought to have been powerful predators.
"Hallucigenia" looks like a long-legged caterpillar with spines on its back, and almost certainly crawled on the seabed.
Nearly half of the Chengjiang fossil species are arthropods, few of which had the hard, mineral-reinforced exoskeletons found in most later marine arthropods; only about 3% of the organisms known from Chengjiang have hard shells, and most of those are trilobites (although "Misszhouia" is a "soft-bodied" trilobite). Many other phyla are found there: Porifera (sponges) and Priapulida (burrowing “worms” which were ambush predators), Brachiopoda (these had bivalve-like shells, but fed by means of a lophophore, a fan-like filter which occupied about of half of the internal space), Chaetognatha (arrow worms), Cnidaria, Ctenophora (comb jellies), Echinodermata, Hyolitha (enigmatic animals with small conical shells), Nematomorpha, Phoronida (horseshoe worms), and Protista.
Burgess Shale.
The Burgess Shale was the first of the Cambrian lagerstätten to be discovered (by Walcott in 1909), and the re-analysis of the Burgess Shale by Whittington and others in the 1970s was the basis of Gould’s book "Wonderful Life", which was largely responsible for non-scientists' awareness of the Cambrian explosion. The fossils date from the mid Cambrian, about 515 million years ago and 10 million years later than the Chengjiang fauna.
The shelled fossils in the Burgess Shale are similar in proportions to other shelly fossil deposits; however, they are a minor component of the biota, accounding for only 14% of the Burgess Shale fossils. When organisms that were not preserved are entered into the equation, the shelly fossils probably represent about 2% of the animals that were alive at the time.
Arthropods are the most abundant and diverse group of organisms in the Burgess Shale, followed closely by sponges. Many Burgess Shale fossils are unusual and difficult to classify, for example:
"Pikaia" resembled the modern lancelet, and was the earliest known chordate until the discovery of the fish-like "Myllokunmingia" and "Haikouichthys" among the Chengjiang fauna.
But the “weird wonders”, creatures that resembled nothing known in the 1970s, attracted the most publicity, for example:
Other fauna.
Other fauna include the Middle Cambrian Wheeler Shale Formation of Utah,
Ichnofauna.
Trace fossils are associated with many Burgess Shale-type deposits. They are often associated with the innards of soft-bodied organisms, and are particularly prevalent under the carapaces of bivalved arthropods. Burrowing organisms seem to have used the high-sulfur decay fluids as a nutrient source when farming bacteria in the microenvironment under the carapaces, indicated by their repeated uses of individual burrows.

Aimée Antoinette Camus (1879–1965) was a French botanist. She was best known for her study of orchids.
Camus was the daughter of Edmond Gustave Camus, also a botanist and was born in L'Isle-Adam, about 50 kilometres north of Paris. Under her father's influence she specialized in the study of orchids and the anatomy of the plant and worked for some time with other professionals such as Paul Bergon (1863-1912) and Paul Henri Lecomte (1856-1934). 
Camus published the work "L'Iconographie des Orchidées d´Europe et du Bassin Méditerranéen".
She gave the name of Neohouzeaua to a species of seven tropical bamboo, in honour of the lifelong work that Jean Houzeau de Lehaie had devoted to the understanding of the botany and propagation of bamboo in Europe and Africa.

He studied in the Manuel Belgrano school in the Belgrano neighborhood (barrio) within Buenos Aires proper. He grew up all over the world, but mostly in London, England.
Early years.
He made his debut with the Heavy Metal Kids at London's Marquee Club in 1973. After recording two albums and world tours, Peyronel left the Kids in 1975 to join UFO as their first keyboard player, where he also sang harmony vocals. Peyronel contributed to the song-writing as well, e.g. "Highway Lady" from the "No Heavy Petting" album. UFO later released a live album from the period when Peyronel was in the band called "On With The Action", which was recorded live at London’s The Roundhouse. His songs from that period have been included in several UFO compilations and an EMI re-issue of "No Heavy Petting" credited him with initiating a change in the band's direction, which continued after his departure.
After leaving UFO in July 1976 following several tours of the US, Europe and the UK, Peyronel formed his own band The Blue Max and recorded an album for Charisma Records. His main partner was Robin Millar on guitars and vocals. After a major tour of the UK, Peyronel left England and went off on a whirlwind of writing, producing and guest starring all over the world before returning to the UK. During this time he wrote the title track of Meat Loaf's "Midnight at the Lost and Found". He also guest starred on and co-produced a live album by Riff, South America's leading hard-rock band, and, in the same region, produced the first major hit album by Virus.
The 1980s and 1990s.
Back in the UK, Peyronel wrote the words to "Fear", which was included in Sade's second, multi-platinum album, "Promise". He participated on an album by Nick Mason from Pink Floyd and Rick Fenn from 10 CC - the Mason-Fenn album "Profiles"; he co-wrote the only two songs with vocals and sang the lead vocal on one of them, "Israel", while David Gilmour from Pink Floyd sang "Lie For A Lie", a hit in many territories.
Peyronel settled in Madrid, Spain, in 1984, where he guest-starred on an album by Banzai, a metal group led by Salvador Domínguez. Dominguez, Danny Peyronel and his brother Michel, started jamming together and out of this came Tarzen, a power-house band. They signed to ATCO Records and toured the US with Twisted Sister, and Europe and South America on their own. After two albums and nearly five years together, the group split up and Peyronel moved to Los Angeles where he dabbled at songwriting and collaborating with Desmond Child, Bon Jovi, Aerosmith and Cher. He also produced a demo for a young local band called Razzle, who later became well known worldwide as Lit.
Present day.
Peyronel relocated to Milan, and assembled a band to cut his debut solo album, "Make The Monkey Dance", recorded and produced by Marco Barusso, and released in 2005. Musicians involved included Sinergia guitarist Luca Verde, bass player Max Zaccaro and drummer Mario Zapparoli. The album included re-workings of UFO’s "Highway Lady" and Meat Loaf’s "Midnight At The Lost And Found".
Peyronel then put together a new line-up of the Heavy Metal Kids, singing lead vocals and writing. In 2003, they released "Hit The Right Button".
In early 2011, Peyronel undertook a tour of the US to coincide with a major re-issue of "Make The Monkey Dance" on Angel Air Records.
X-UFO.
June 2011 was the launch date for X-UFO, a super-group formed entirely of UFO and UFO spin-off MSG members Laurence Archer on guitar and vocals, Danny Peyronel, Clive Edwards on drums and Rocky Newton on bass and vocals.
Peyronel has taken the role of frontman/lead-singer, whilst still handling short keyboard parts. They played their debut concert as headliners at the Hard Rock Hell Road Trip Festival in Ibiza, and are now embarking on several high profile appearances, such as the Aero Rock Starz Festival in Bulgaria on the 9 July 2011.
They perform their own versions of the classic UFO catalogue, with a large percentage of the material consisting of UFO classics written or co-written by the band-members.
X-UFO will be doing a live album in the course of the year to kick-off their recording career. They plan to go in the studio early in 2012 to produce an album of new material in the same vein as their UFO songwriting contribution, updated to the day, as well as more of their own versions of UFO classics, now by the name of HOUSE OF X.

Debbie Bampton

Deborah "Debbie" Bampton, MBE, (born 7 October 1961) is an English former international football midfielder. She was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2005. In 1998 Bampton was awarded an MBE in recognition of her services to women's football as both a player and a manager.
Club career.
Bampton began her career at the age of 14. She played for Howbury Grange managed by her father Albert. She was a member of the side that won the Women's FA Cup in 1984. In 1987 she moved to Italy, playing for Despar Trani 80 as a full–time professional alongside compatriot Kerry Davis. She spent just one season there, but won runners–up medals in both the Serie A and national Cup.
She joined Arsenal Ladies in 1992, winning the treble in her first season at the club. In 1994 Bampton left to become player-manager of Croydon Women. In 1995–96, Croydon won the League title and the FA Women's Cup. Despite leaving the field after eight minutes due to injury, Bampton won her fifth FA Cup winners' medal when Croydon beat Liverpool in the 1996 final at the New Den. She won the league with Croydon twice more before leaving to join Doncaster Belles as a player in 2000 after the Croydon club moved to Charlton. 
In 2004 she joined Eastbourne Borough Ladies FC, a team her father Albert was coaching. During their first season as a women team they went on to win the Sussex County Cup and the League Cup, 
She joined the coaching staff of Whitehawk Ladies in the 2006 close season, along with former Arsenal and England player Angela Banks. In February 2008, she was manager of Whitehawk Ladies. Bampton joined the coaching staff of Lewes FC Ladies in January 2009.
International career.
Bampton made her England debut whilst still at school, playing against the Netherlands in September 1978. She went on to win 95 caps for England.
Bampton hit the winning goal in Denmark as England qualified for the 1984 European Competition for Women's Football final. In the second leg of the final at Kenilworth Road, Bampton scored in England's penalty shootout defeat to Sweden. 
In 1995 she controversially took over the England captaincy from Gillian Coultard and led the Three Lionesses into their first ever FIFA Women's World Cup appearance that year. Bampton recalled: "It was difficult, especially as Gill and I were roommates and at that point the England squad was split. A lot of people wanted Clare Taylor to be captain, but it was something I'd always wanted to do and so I just enjoyed it." She retained the captaincy for England's failed 1997 UEFA Women's Championship qualification campaign. In May 1997 Bampton made her final England appearance in a 6–0 friendly defeat to United States in Portland.
Playing style.
Bampton was a tall, strong and industrious central midfielder. She characterised herself as "a box-to-box player" and said "I worked hard to win the ball, and I was always looking to make forward runs. I was not a natural goalscorer, but I did look to set up chances for others."

Roger Hicks (rock musician)

Roger Hicks is an Australian rock musician active for a few years in the late 1960s. Early in life, he also trained as a classical guitarist.
He performed in the groups Zoot throughout 1968 and early 1969 and "The Brisbane Avengers", and also composed and performed the acoustic guitar introduction to Russell Morris's hit song from 1969, "The Real Thing" which became the most recognisable "hook" to the song. Following this he also played and composed all the acoustic guitar parts in the coda to "The Real Thing" : "Part Three into Paper Walls" which ends with the opening statement from "The Real Thing" heavily phased, thus tying together two songs which are in reality one song with a duration of 13:20 minutes.
He defected from Zoot in the fallout after the "Think Pink - Think Zoot" publicity campaign, which backfired in some ways, and moved for a time to the Brisbane Avengers.
He seems to have vanished from the rock music scene after that, and it is not clear where he is now, or what he is currently doing.

David William Thomas

David William Thomas, Sr. (August 12, 1876 – August 1, 1961), was a Welsh-American "Renaissance man", journalist, university professor and attorney who served from 1936—1940 as mayor of the small city of Minden, the seat of Webster Parish in northwestern Louisiana.
Early years and education.
A native of Cardiff, Wales, United Kingdom, he was the son of David and Sarah Thomas. The Thomases entered the United States in 1883 and settled in Scranton, Pennsylvania, where young Thomas received his primary schooling. He was admitted to Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, where he received an Ivy League education. After graduation from Cornell, Thomas was briefly a high school teacher and then a school principal in Lake Charles, the seat of Calcasieu Parish in southwestern Louisiana.
After several years in Lake Charles, Thomas was hired as professor of Latin, Greek and journalism at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. At the time, LSU was located downtown on the site of the Louisiana State Capitol. While Thomas was a professor at LSU, several students from Minden, including future judge Harmon Caldwell Drew, were students there. Later, H. C. Drew's son, R. Harmon Drew, Sr. (1917–1995), a judge and state representative, was a pallbearer at Thomas' funeral. So was a later mayor, John T. David.
Higher education and journalism.
While he was on the LSU faculty, Thomas also attended law school. He graduated in 1909 with an L.L.B. degree but did not begin practicing law until much later in life. He remained in his teaching position at LSU for several more years until the early 1920s, when he became publisher of a small daily newspaper, the "Baton Rouge News", forerunner to the modern Baton Rouge "Advocate". He was later an editor of a weekly paper in Hammond, the principal city of Tangipahoa Parish. He left Hammond in 1923 in his 47th year to come to Minden, where he was on the staff of the new "Minden Tribune", a forerunner to the "Minden Press-Herald", which merged into a daily newspaper in 1966.
In 1925, Thomas became professor of journalism at Louisiana Tech University (then Louisiana Polytechnic Institute) in Ruston, the seat of Lincoln Parish in northern Louisiana. He wrote poetry, which was published in regional and national literary anthologies. Thomas remained on the faculty at Tech for several years, including a part-time instructorship for his last years there. He returned to the "Minden Tribune" in 1927 before it merged with the "Webster Signal" to become the "Signal-Tribune". Once again, he returned to higher education: professor of journalism at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville.
While in Arkansas, Thomas wrote letters to the editors of local newspapers to remain in touch with the community. He returned to Minden in 1934 and never left. Twenty-five years after he had received his law degree from LSU, Thomas opened a private practice in Minden with R.F. Langston, which endured until Langston's death.
Mayoral service.
Thomas ran unsuccessfully for mayor of Minden in the spring of 1934, having lost a Democratic runoff election on May 15 to former Mayor Henry L. Bridges, 624 to 366. In that race, Thomas called for a reduction in municipal utility rates and for the establishment of a canning plant to assist residents in the preservation of garden foods. The incumbent that year, Connell Fort, who had also preceded future Governor Robert F. Kennon as mayor prior to 1926 and who had handily unseated Bridges in 1932, was eliminated in the first primary held on April 10, 1934.
On March 2, 1936, at the age of sixty, Thomas was elected to the first of two two-year terms as mayor of Minden. As mayor under the former commission government, since replaced by the single-member district mayor-council format, Thomas pressed for paving all major streets. An amateur architect, Thomas designed the former Minden Community House in Victory Park, but the original structure has been superseded by a more modern building.
During Thomas' second term, to which he was elected without opposition in 1938, controversy arose over the sale of alcoholic beverages. The city had allowed such sales when the Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution was adopted in December 1933. In the fall of 1938, a local option election was held to decide whether Minden would impose prohibition at the municipal level. The city was voted dry effective January 1, 1939. The prohibition issue may have ruined Thomas politically, for he finished in third place in the 1940 primary election. The ultimate winner, attorney Floyd D. Culbertson, Jr., served through November 1942, when he resigned as mayor to enter military service during World War II. Thomas unsuccessfully challenged Culbertson in the 1942 election and then ran in the 1946 Democratic primary. That year he finished a weak third, with the contest being won in a runoff on May 7 by John T. David, who defeated insurance agent Castle O. Holland (1895–1981).
Thomas was not the first Minden mayor to have a background in journalism; so did W. Jasper Blackburn, who served as a Democrat from 1855 to 1856. Blackburn became a Republican during the American Civil War and served briefly in the United States House of Representatives and the Louisiana State Senate.J. Frank Colbert, a former state representative who served as mayor from 1944–1946, also had newspaper experience. Connell Fort was also a newspaperman during much of his working career. Twenty-six years after Thomas left the office of mayor, still another former newspaperman, Tom Colten, became the city's first of thus far two Republican mayors.
Thomas remained active in local Democratic politics. He served as the Webster Parish attorney for the inheritance collector from 1948 until his death.
In 1954, Thomas ran a weak third in the race for Minden city judge, a position vacated by the incument R. Harmon Drew, Sr. The Minden native Cecil C. Lowe defeated A. Eugene Frazier in a runoff election for the position.
Thomas continued his law practice until his death. A Baptist, he presented Bibles to high school students upon their graduations. Services were held at the Emmanuel Baptist Church in Minden, with the Reverend T. W. Leachman officiating. Thomas is interred at Minden Cemetery.

Access to Higher Education

The Access to Higher Education (HE) Diploma is a qualification which prepares students — usually mature students, although there is no minimum or maximum age requirement — for study as an undergraduate at university. The diploma is designed for people who would like to study in higher education but who left school without qualifications such as A-Levels. Once completed, the access diploma is held in the same standing as A-Levels, allowing holders to study for BA degrees, BSc degrees, HNCs, HNDs, LLBs and other undergraduate degrees.
Each year, around 20,000 Access to HE students apply to universities across the UK.
There are over 1,000 different courses leading to the Access to HE Diploma and courses are available in most further education colleges in England and Wales.
Access courses are generally tailored as pathways; that is, they prepare students with the necessary skills and imbue the appropriate knowledge required for a specific undergraduate career. For example, there are 'access to law', 'access to medicine' and 'access to nursing' pathways that prepare students to study law, medicine and nursing at undergraduate level, respectively.
The first access courses were established in the 1970s. Many of these courses were set up to encourage entry to teacher training by people with a wider range of backgrounds than the traditional types of students who were attracted to teaching. Over the years, the success of these early courses led to the development of courses in other areas.
In the 1987 white paper "Higher Education: Meeting the Challenge", the government identified Access to HE as 'the third recognised route to higher education', and sought to extend Access to HE provision through a national framework for the recognition of Access to HE courses.
A national framework has been in existence since 1989. The Quality Assurance Agency (QAA), the Access to HE regulatory body, has been responsible for this framework in England, Wales and Northern Ireland since it was established in 1997.

The She Spot

The She Spot: Why Women are the Market for Changing the World – And How to Reach Them is a 2008 non-fiction book by Lisa Witter and Lisa Chen.
Synopsis.
"The She Spot" focuses on the impact of women on social change. The book focuses on the influence women have had on the world, as well as on volunteering. The book incorporates several case studies, polls, and the potential for women to be underrepresented in these polls and studies. "The She Spot" also covers the potential mis-representation in marketing towards women.
Critical reception.
Critical reception for "The She Spot" has been positive, with Publishers Weekly calling it a "thoughtful, helpful guide to nonprofit marketers". AdAge's Matt Kinsey wrote that the book was "good fodder for discussion" but that he was unsure that Witter and Chen's "formula alone can commandeer a loyal female audience". A review in ForeWord magazine by Mary Spiro said that, "If one agrees with the premise that marketing has been male-centered or that the strategies they present are uniquely suited to impact women then this text offers plenty of practical advice for those courting female clientele" and that the end of chapter summaries offer "quick inspiration".

<doc id="18226024" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18226024" title="49ers–Rams rivalry">
49ers–Rams rivalry

The 49ers–Rams rivalry began in 1950 and became one of the most intense in the NFL in the 1970s as the two California based teams (the Rams then played their home games in Southern California) regularly competed for the NFL's NFC West Division title. After the Rams move to St. Louis in 1995 the rivalry lost its geographical lore, though games are still intense no matter what the standings indicate. The cultural differences between the West Coast (where the 49ers are based) and Midwest (the home base for the Rams) also added to the intensity of the rivalry. "Sports Illustrated" considers their rivalry the 8th best of all time in the National Football League.
History.
In 1950, the National Football League merged with the All-America Football Conference thus gaining three new teams. One of these teams was the San Francisco 49ers making them the second NFL franchise located on the West Coast. The first one being the Los Angeles Rams who had re-located from Cleveland in 1946. The NFL placed both of them in the newly formed National Conference (1950-1952) guaranteeing that they would play each other twice during the regular season. In 1953, the National Conference was re-named the Western Conference and the American Conference was re-named the Eastern Conference which remained in place until the AFL merger forced re-alignment in 1970. For the 1967, 1968 and 1969 seasons immediately preceding the 1970 re-alignment, now with 16 franchises, the NFL divided the Western and Eastern Conferences into two Divisions of four teams each. Ironically, very similar to the present day conferences resulting from the 2002 re-alignment. The 49ers and Rams remained together in the Coastal Division of the Western Conference (1967-1969) and then in the NFC West Division since 1970. Owing to the strength of their rivalry, the 49ers and Rams have remained in place as the only two teams in the NFC West Division continuously since 1970, despite the Rams re-location to Saint Louis in 1995 and further re-alignment in 2002. They have met twice every season beginning in 1950. Their lone postseason meeting was in the NFC Championship Game during the playoffs following the 1989 season at Candlestick Park in San Francisco. This resulted in a 30-3 victory by the 49ers on January 14, 1990 immediately preceding their fourth Super Bowl appearance.
1950s.
The first meeting between the teams took place on October 1, 1950 at Kezar Stadium in San Francisco. The Rams were alternating starting quarterbacks between Bob Waterfield and Norm Van Brocklin during the 1950 season. Waterfield was the starter for the game, but during the second quarter San Francisco's Pete Wissman landed a hard tackle on the Los Angeles quarterback. Van Brocklin filled in for Waterfield, and the Rams went on to win the game 35–14. The two teams played each other again on November 5, 1950 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles. After beating the Baltimore Colts 70-21 and the Detroit Lions 65-24, the Rams were favored to beat the 49ers by 20 points. Yet, the 49ers played a very physical game and only lost by a touchdown holding the Rams offensive powerhouse to only 28 points.
The 49ers got their first win against the Rams on October 28, 1951. The 49er secondary was able to pick off Van Brocklin six times, more than half of the interceptions that he throw all season. The 49ers held the Rams to just 17 points, the lowest they put up all season and were able to capitalize on the turnovers en route to a 44-17 victory.
1970s.
The rivalry was at its pinnacle during the 1970s. From 1970-79 one of the two teams won the NFC's West Division. The decade also featured a ten and eight game win streak by the Rams (the eight game streak was the latter of the two and stretched into the early 1980s). The 49ers were the NFC West's top team in the beginning of the decade winning the first three post merger division crowns. The Rams answered right back winning seven straight division crowns from 1973–79, culminating with Super Bowl XIV loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers.
1980s.
On January 2, 1983, a 1-7 Rams team met the 3-5 defending Super Bowl champion 49ers in San Francisco for the last game of the 1982 season (a players' strike shortened the season to 9 games), with the 49ers needing a win to make the playoffs. The Rams led late in the 4th quarter 21-20 until 49er quarterback Joe Montana led one of his patented two-minute drives, putting the 49ers in position for a short field goal. But Ivory Sully blocked Ray Wersching's kick to preserve a 21-20 win and knock the 49ers out of the playoffs.
On January 14, 1990 the two teams met in the 1989 NFC Championship game. The Rams were heavy underdogs but had already pulled off two upsets on the road in the playoffs (over the Eagles and Giants). The Rams took a 3-0 early lead and were driving again, but Rams quarterback Jim Everett noticed a wide open Flipper Anderson a second too late and the pass was knocked away by 49er safety Ronnie Lott. Instead of a 10-0 Rams lead, Montana led the 49ers on a touchdown drive and San Francisco took the lead 7-3. The 49ers would go on to win the game 30-3.
1990s.
The 49ers dominated the rivalry during the 1990s winning seventeen straight games against the Rams. After nearly forty years, it seemed like the rivalry was coming to an end when the Rams relocated to St. Louis, Missouri. Yet, some players did not believe so. Roger Craig stated in "Tales from the San Francisco 49ers Sideline" that "the Rams will always be the 49ers' biggest rival. It doesn't matter if they no longer play in Los Angeles. If the Rams played their home games on Mars, it would still be a rivalry."
2000s.
The Rams and their "Greatest Show on Turf" offense had the upper hand in the early part of the decade. But both teams fell into decline and neither team was a playoff contender as the decade wore on. The 49ers had the upper hand during the latter part of the decade, going 8-2 from the 2005 season to the end of the decade.

John Saxbee

John Charles Saxbee (born 7 January 1946) was the 71st Bishop of Lincoln in the Church of England between 23 March 2002 and 31 January 2011. He was introduced to the House of Lords as a new Lord Spiritual on 1 July 2008 together with former Director-General of MI5, Baroness Manningham-Buller.
Education, ordination and career.
Bristol-born, Saxbee was educated at the University of Bristol where he obtained a BA degree in 1968. He subsequently went on to complete his PhD degree at St John's College, Durham in 1974. He trained for the priesthood at Cranmer Hall in Durham and was ordained in Exeter Cathedral as a deacon in 1972 and a priest in 1973. From 1972 he was curate at Compton Gifford in the Diocese of Exeter before moving to Weston Mill in the same diocese as priest-in-charge in 1977. He later became Vicar of Weston Mill before moving to become Team Vicar of Central Exeter Team Ministry in 1981; a post he held until 1987. He was Joint Director of the South West Ministerial Training Course between 1981 and 1992 and was a member of the General Synod's House of Clergy between 1985 and 1994.
He became a prebendary at Exeter Cathedral in 1988 until his appointment as Archdeacon of Ludlow and a prebendary of Hereford Cathedral in 1992. Between 1992 and 1994 he was also priest-in-charge of Wistanstow and Acton Scott. He was appointed Suffragan Bishop of Ludlow in 1994 whilst remaining Archdeacon of Ludlow. He relinquished both posts when he took up his role as Bishop of Lincoln in 2002, his appointment having been announced on 4 September 2001. Saxbee is also an academic writer having published "Liberal Evangelism: a flexible response to the decade" in 1994.
Saxbee has expressed concerns about the divisive nature of the proposed Anglican Covenant, speaking at the November 2010 General Synod he said, "the Anglican Communion doesn't need a Covenant because Anglicanism is a covenant."
Personal life.
Saxbee is married to Jacqueline ("Jackie"), who was his secretary and with whom he has one grown-up daughter, Helen, who works for the "Church Times". He enjoys reading Victorian novels, watching sport on television and listening to music. He is also a supporter of Bristol City FC.
Retirement.
Saxbee announced to the March meeting of Lincoln's Diocesan Synod that he intended to retire as Bishop of Lincoln on 31 January 2011, and duly did so.
Saxbee's opposition to the proposed Anglican Covenant continued into his retirement when, together with Bishop Peter Selby, he was appointed an Episcopal Patron of the international No Anglican Covenant Coalition. In a joint letter to the "Church Times", Saxbee and Selby warned that "this is a time to hold fast to Anglicanism’s inherited culture of inclusion and respectful debate which is our way of dealing with difference rather than require assent to procedures and words that have already shown themselves to be divisive."

John Lawton (author)

John Lawton is a producer/director in television, and an author of historical/crime/espionage novels set primarily in England during World War II and the Cold War.
Biography.
Lawton had a brief and unspectacular career in London publishing prior to becoming, by the mid-1980s, a documentary television producer at the newly created Channel 4. In 1993 he settled in New York, and in 1995 won a WH Smith award for his third book Black OutHe went back into television in England in 1997, and by 1999 had dropped off the TV and books map completely. He returned in 2001 with Riptide (American title: Bluffing Mr. Churchill), which was snapped up by Columbia Pictures. For most of the 21st century, so far, he has tended to be elusive and itinerant, residing in England, the USA and Italy. He appeared in New York, in 2008, with a reading in Greenwich Village.[2 Earlier the same year he was named in the Daily Telegraph (London) as one of '50 Crime Writers To Read Before You Die.' In October 2010 he read in Ottawa, Toronto, Portland and Seattle, ending up at the Mysterious Book Store in Tribeca, and later that year was named in the New York Times Review's 'Pick of the Year' for his novel 'A Lily of the Field'.
Many of the Biography pages within Lawton's books have a decidedly tongue-in-cheek bent with hobbies listed as the 'cultivation of the onion and obscure varieties of potato', or 'growing leeks'. Those close to him would stress that such descriptions are meant quite seriously. His author bio notes that "since 2000 he has lived in the high, wet hills of Derbyshire England, with frequent excursions into the high, dry hills of Arizona and Italy."
Bibliography.
Frederick Troy novels.
The novels in the Frederick Troy series share the eponymous protagonist Frederick (he doesn't like any form of his given name, preferring to be addressed by his surname) Troy, the younger son of a Russian immigrant father who's become a wealthy newspaper publisher and baronet. Defying class and family expectations, the independently wealthy Troy joins Scotland Yard, becoming an investigator on the "murder squad". The rights to this character were purchased by Columbia Pictures.

Other fiction.
Another look at the Profumo Affair that so shocked the English, played this time as comedy, when a junior army officer is mistaken for someone
important, set up with a hooker and blackmailed. Reads very much like Lawton's homage to Graham Greene

City Road Basin

The City Road Basin is an English canal basin and part of the Regent's Canal in London, owned by British Waterways. It opened in 1820, and made a large contributuion to the prosperity of the Regent's Canal. By the 1950s, its surroundings were largely derelict, but a programme of regeneration began in 2004, involving several large-scale residential developments, and public access to the basin was provided for the first time in 2009. The basin is used for canoeing by the Islington Boat Club.
History.
Following the completion of the Grand Junction Canal's branch to Paddington Basin in 1801, various plans to link it to the River Thames further to the east were suggested. A scheme to build a canal to the Thames at Limehouse was eventually agreed, and an Act of Parliament was obtained on 13 July 1812 to authorise the Regents Canal. The canal was opened from Paddington to Camden Town in 1816, and work on the Islington Tunnel had started, but the company was chronically short of money, as they had failed to raise the original capital, and the cost of construction was anticipated to be much more than the first estimate of £400,000. A third Act of Parliament, (there had been a second one in 1813 to authorise the building of Cumberland Basin), increased the authorised capital to £600,000, but the company had only raised £254,100 of the original amount, and failed to raise any more.
A chance meeting between Charles Munro, the chairman of the Regents Canal prior to 1816 and the long-named Committee of the Society for relieving the Manufacturing Poor led to discussions of government loans, and the Exchequer Bill Loan Commission was created under the provisions of the Poor Employment Act 1817, with powers to lend money to public schemes which would create employment for those without work. They agreed to lend the canal company £200,000 if they could find another £100,000, which they succeeded in doing, and in December 1817, work resumed on the canal. In 1819, a fourth Act was obtained, which made provision for the construction of City Road Basin, and removed powers to build a cut to Shoreditch. Another £105,000 was raised and the canal opened on 1 August 1820. The opening celebrations included the arrival of boats from Manchester, which discharged their cargos at the basin and began their journey back to the north on the same day.
City Road Basin, close to the eastern end of Islington Tunnel, made a huge contribution to the prosperity of the company, as it was more convenient than Paddington, and was soon acting as a distribution centre for goods into London. Several firms which had become established at Paddington moved to City Road Basin, including the carriers Pickfords. A lucrative trade developed rapidly, and although most of the cargo from the Grand Junction Canal only travelled as far as City Road Basin, there was growing traffic in coal, timber, bricks, sand and other building materials from the eastern end of the canal to locations west of the basin, where building development was flourishing. The privately owned Wenlock Basin was opened in 1826, next to City Road Basin, and passage through the tunnel was speeded up by the provision of a towing boat in 1830. This remained in use until the 1930s, and used a chain on the bottom of the canal, along which it wound its way.
Large volumes of goods were being shipped locally, in contrast to the canal's original purpose of transshipping imports to the Midlands. The opening of the London and Birmingham Railway in 1838 actually increased the tonnage of coal carried by the canal. However, by 1929, with the Midlands trade lost to the railways, and more deliveries made by road, the canal – and this basin – fell into a long decline.
Development.
The basin was always private, with no public access, and by the 1950s had become run-down and derelict. In 2004, Islington Borough Council adopted the City Road Basin Masterplan as an official policy, and work began on the regeneration of the area. Major high-rise buildings were built on parts of the surrounding area, and in each case Section 106 planning obligations ensured that there was funding available to carry out environmental improvements to the basin area. This has allowed the public to access the basin for the first time in its history. The work, which was completed in 2009, has included the provision of public open space at the head of the basin, a landscaped park, and new facilities for the Islington Boat Club, who have been providing canoeing facilities for schools on the basin since 1972.

Howeitat

The Howeitat or Huwaytat () are a large tribal confederation of historic Transjordan, an area in present-day Jordan and Saudi Arabia. The Howeitat have several branches, notably the Ibn Jazi, the Abu Tayi and the Sulaymanniyin, in addition to a number of associated tribes.
The Howeitat are unusual in claiming descent from a single ancestor, an Egyptian named Huwayt. However, their presence in the area may date from the 18th century, when tribes of the northern Arabian desert were being pushed northwards by expansion of the Wahhabite-associated bedouin of central Arabia; by the late 18th century the Howeitat were already laying claim to areas around Aqaba and northwards; they also laid claim to land in Egypt. They developed into a partly settled tribe, combining farming in the fertile areas of Jabal Shara with pastoralism, but early in the 20th century were rendered more or less nomadic by the activities of two rival shaikhs, Abtan ibn Jazi and Auda abu Tayi, who concentrated on raiding, collection of tribute and camel-herding.
The Abu Tayi and Ibn Jazi subclans of the tribe were supporters of the Hashemite cause during the Arab Revolt, in which they formed an important part of Faisal's forces; Auda Abu Tayi and Hamad Ibn Jazi were able to muster a force of Bedouin tribesmen willing to march on Aqaba under the banner of Prince Feisal bin Hussein. In later years the Howeitat returned to farming; they were also prominent in the Arab Legion, the Ibn Jazi section becoming the most powerful component in the federation. The Howeitat still have possession of large areas of land around Wadi Rum and stretching into Saudi Arabia; they have historically been a significant source of manpower for the Saudi Arabian National Guard and the Royal Jordanian Land Force. 
The Howeitat are often mentioned in Richard Francis Burton's travelogue "The Land of Midian", in which he gives the following account of their origin:
They are also mentioned in T E Lawrence's "Seven Pillars of Wisdom" and the film "Lawrence of Arabia".

Twentestad was a proposal for the merger of two cities and a town in the eastern part of the Netherlands, in the province of Overijssel. Enschede, Hengelo and parts of Borne would become an urban area in Twente, with about 250,000 inhabitants. 
The merger never occurred, because of limited funding from the government and because 90% of all inhabitants of Hengelo were against it. They feared more problems, like criminality and traffic problems. After the project had been cancelled in 2000, Enschede, Hengelo, Borne and the neighbouring cities of Almelo and (later) Oldenzaal decided to intensify their collaboration as "Netwerkstad Twente".

Maruševec Castle

Maruševec is castle located in the municipality of the same name within Varaždin County, Croatia. The castle dates back to 1547. In the 19th century it was described as having a square, lowland fortress with entrenchments, four circular towers and one square one, entered across a wooden bridge.
History.
In 1618 Baltazar Vragović of the noble family Vragović, (entitled in 1351 by King Ljudevit I), restored and enlarged the castle. This is recorded in the inscription and family arms on the first floor of the western wall of the old castle. The Vragović family had obtained and occupied the castle and from 1514 had the right to pronounce the death sentence on serfs. In 1716 they were given a baronetcy but the last member of the family, Franjo Adam, had no male heir and nominated Krsto črnkovački, then Deputy Ban and captain of the Ban's bodyguard, to be his successor. However, upon his death a year later in fighting against the Turks on the Zrin, Maruševec Castle was owned by a succession of noble families from the Pasztory family, the Kanotay family to the Patačić family. 
The Patačićes remained im possession until 1817 no heir was apparent. Throughout the mid 19th century, again the castle was under numerous hands, until it was bought in 1873 from Baron Simbschen by the Prussian Count Arthur Schlippenbach whose wife, Luisa, was from the Drache de Wartenberg family. He enlarged the castle as it stands today and refurbished it with decor of the period in 1877. In 1881, Count Schlippenbach died in Cairo. 
In 1883 Maruševec and Čalinec Castle were purchased by Oskar de Pongratz. The Pongratz noble family reconstructed the garden, and made some minor alterations to the building in 1901 such as tapestries on the staircases illustrating hunting scenes, the work of Monnaccelli from Rome . Pongratz also placed a new entrance door in the south wall above which are the Pongratz arms, and built new steps, which stand today. The castle was owned by the Pongratz noble family until 1945. That year the Independent State of Croatia was defeated, resulting in the establishment of communist-run Yugoslavia which confiscated most of the former Austro-Hungarian Croatian nobility's property. As part of this, Maruševec was nationalized and the Pongratz's emigrated to Graz, Austria. 
In the 2000s, the government of Croatia began the process of returning the property to the heir of the Pongratz family, count Oskar Pontgratz. It is now in their ownership.

European Union wine regulations

European Union wine regulations are common legislation related to wine existing within the European Union (EU), the member states of which account for almost two-thirds of the world's wine production. These regulations form a part of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of EU, and regulate such things as the maximum vineyard surface allowed to individual EU member states, allowed winemaking practices and principles for wine classification and labelling. The wine regulations exist to regulate total production in order to combat overproduction of wine and to provide an underpinning to Protected designations of origin (PDOs), among other things. In a sense, the wine regulations therefore try to protect both the producer and the consumer.
The EU wine regulations, as a part of CAP, do not include regulations on age limits for buying or drinking alcohol, regulations on wine advertising or retailing and other aspects of national social or public health policies of the individual EU member states.
History.
While a large bulk of the text of the regulations is concerned with winemaking practices and the like, much of the history of the EU wine regulations has been linked to the issue of market imbalances and overproduction of wine.
In the early days of the CAP, the wine sector of the then-European Economic Community (EEC) was in reasonable equilibrium for a rather short period of time. During this time, there were no regulations as to plantations and few interventions into the market, as this was not needed. However, the early post-World War II saw the introduction of many technological innovations within viticulture, which soon led to increased production, while the demand stayed constant. This resulted in a surplus of wine. The answer from EEC was to intervene in the market to make some guarantee as to sales, while still keeping the freedom to plant new vineyards, which aggravated rather than solved the problem of overproduction. While looking like a very illogical policy in hindsight, this was in keeping with the view that what the EEC was aiming to do was to balance variations in production from year to year.
After the realisation that the surplus was a structural one rather than a temporary variation, the wine regulations were changed to be more interventionist in 1978, with a ban on additional vineyard plantations, which means that a system of planting rights was introduced to regulate replantations. Also, requirements to distil the surplus wine into industrial alcohol were introduced, a procedure often referred to as "emergency distillation", although it has remained in force for decades. At about the same time, domestic wine consumption of simpler wine qualities started to drop within the larger wine producing countries of Europe, making it even harder to return to the previous state of market equilibrium. From the 1980s, this has meant a marked reduction in the total demand, in terms of quantity, despite the fact that the wine-importing countries of northern Europe have increased their consumption. Increasing wine exports from the New World, often in a style arrived at by market research rather than long tradition, also meant increased competition and changing tastes among wine consumers. As a result, the reduced total demand also included a shift in the demand towards higher quality level. Since it was realised that the vineyards in some locations would be unlikely to yield wines of the necessary quality, increased financial incentives for giving up vineyards, so-called grubbing-up schemes or vine pull schemes, were introduced in the late 1980s. This led to reduced overproduction, but a complete balance has so far never been achieved.
In the mid to late 1990s, much of CAP was overhauled and the legislation was simplified. A major revision was done in 1999, and it has been stated several times since then that the ambition is to phase out interventions such as emergency distillation, since they are "artificial outlets" for wine. However, this aim has proven difficult to achieve.
The latest round of reforms was announced in 2006 and led to agreed legal documents in 2008. Some of the key points were:
Many of the reforms were less sweeping than what had initially been proposed, and the implementation of several items delayed.
Documents.
The central document of the EU wine regulations is entitled "Council Regulation on the common organisation of the market in wine" and it is supplemented by several Commission regulations. The former document has been adopted by the Council of the European Union through the member states' ministers of agriculture, while the Commission regulations are written by the European Commission in collaboration with the Wine Management Committee, where the member states are represented.
Aspects regulated.
The aspects regulated by EU fall mainly into the categories winemaking practices, classification and labelling, wine-production potential, documentation of wine industry activities, imports from non-EU countries, and duties of enforcement agencies.
Classification and labelling.
The wines produced within EU are divided into two quality categories, Table wines (TW) and Quality Wines Produced in Specified Regions (QWpsr), where QWpsr is the higher category. Rules for winemaking practices and labelling are different for TW and QWpsr. The similar categories also exist for sparkling wine.
The TW and QWpsr categories are translated into different national wine classification for each member state. Thus, some member states may have more than two levels of classification, but all national levels correspond to either TW or QWpsr and are subject to the common minimum standards set out in the EU wine regulations. As an example, France uses four levels of classification. "Vin de table" and "Vin de pays" are both EU Table wines, while "Vin Délimité de Qualité Supérieure" (VDQS) and "Appellation d'origine contrôlée" (AOC) wines are QWpsr.
Winemaking practices.
Perhaps most importantly, the regulations define wine as "the product obtained exclusively from the total or partial alcoholic fermentation of fresh grapes, whether or not crushed, or of grape must". Furthermore, wine can only be made from grape varieties listed as allowed, and only those vine varieties may be planted for commercial purposes. Each EU member state draws up such lists of varieties, which may only contain purebred "Vitis vinifera" varieties, and certain crosses between "V. vinifera" and other species of the "Vitis" genus. Thus, uncrossed so-called American vines, such as "Vitis labrusca", may not be used for wine and are not allowed in EU vineyards.
Many winemaking practices depend on the classification of the wine – TW or QWpsr. Some practices also depend on where within EU the grapes are grown, since typical challenges to winemakers in colder or hotter climates are somewhat different. The definied European Union wine growing zones are used to regulate these practices, but some leeway is given for authorising deviations in vintages of exceptional climatic conditions.
EU regulations and national wine laws.
The reason why these regulations exist on the EU level is because of the common market inside the EU, which has led to a need to harmonise regulations for various products which traditionally have been regulated on a national level. The EU wine regulations form a framework for the wine laws of the European Union member states. Since national wine laws have a much longer history than the EU wine regulations, the EU regulations have been designed to accommodate existing regulations of several member states. In particular, the existing regulations concerning French wine, with its detailed appellation laws, formed a basis, while also making room for the very different German wine classification system. In general, the EU wine regulations provide for minimum standards across EU, while making it possible for individual member states to enact stricter standards in certain areas in their national wine laws.
An example comparing a French and two German wine types made from the same grape variety illustrate what the EU wine regulations stipulate, and how the individual countries have applied various stricter regulations than the minimum for these "quality wines".
In a sense, the EU wine regulations as such are rather invisible to the wine consumers and the wine trade, since the details of quality classifications and labelling practices are generally part of the national wine laws, which provide the visible front-end.

NME Radio

NME Radio was a radio station operated under "NME" magazine branding, that broadcast a commercially oriented alternative music format. It first began broadcasting on 24 June 2008 and ceased on 25 March 2013.
History.
Initial plans for an NME-branded radio station were revealed to the media in late 2007 by Sammy Jacob, creator of XFM, who left the station following its purchase by Global Radio. The station began operating under licence soon after by DX Media, a company operated by Jacob.
Broadcast from studios in the Blue Fin Building in South Bank, London, also home to IPC Media, NME Radio was launched on 24 June 2008 with its first track being "Knights of Cydonia" by British rock band Muse.
On Friday 11 June 2010, almost two years after its launch, The Guardian reported that NME Radio was to cease broadcasting on DAB digital radio, Sky, Virgin Media and Freesat platforms, and would revert to an online only "jukebox" format after DX Media had decided to end the agreement to operate the service.
On 21 July 2010, IPC Media signed a new licence agreement with local radio group Town and Country Broadcasting. NME Radio relaunched in September 2010 and returned to some regional digital audio broadcasting (DAB) multiplexes. The station returned to Freesat and Sky, where it was available until 5 December 2011. Following the new licensing agreement, operation sites were split between IPC Media's London HQ and Town and Country Broadcasting's station in south Wales, Nation Radio.
The Town and Country incarnation of the station ceased broadcasting on 25 March 2013 at midday.
Programming.
Under the control of DX Media, NME Radio featured 16 hours of live broadcasting with a variety of presenters. Following the stations purchase by Town and Country Broadcasting, some daytime programmes were initially introduced.

Laurent Drelincourt (1626–1681) was son of the French Reformed Church theologian Charles Drelincourt (1595–1669), who was a French Protestant divine. Laurent also was a theologian, who later became a pastor, and was the author of "Sonnets chrétiens sur divers sujets" (1677).
His orientation is said to have followed largely the teachings of John Calvin. Historically noteworthy are his poems to the Virgin Mary in "Livre III". Drelincourt expresses in rich poetic language a clear theology on Mary, quoting at the end of each poem biblical sources as proof of his writings. Drelincourt expresses a Marian devotion within the Reformed movement, which was lost in later years.
Drelincourt wrote, that Christ by becoming human through the Virgin Mary did not lose who he was, but began to be what he was not. He approvingly noted that the Council of Ephesus excluded all who did not accept the Theotokos definition. He quoted Augustine, saying that Jesus selected Mary as his mother, but she was more content to conceive him in her heart than in her body. He supported Bernard of Clairvaux, when he defined Mary as a mythical paradise, which generated the tree of life for all humanity.

Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus (politician)

Gottfried Reinhold Treviranus (20 March 1891, Schieder, Germany – 7 June 1971 Florence, Italy) was a German politician from the Conservative People's Party and a Reichsminister in both of Chancellor Heinrich Brüning's cabinets. In the first he was Minister for Occupied Areas (March – October 1930) and then Minister without Portfolio (October 1930 – October 1931); in the second (October 1931 – May 1932), he served as Minister of Transport.
Early life.
He was the son of a German father and a Scottish mother. After graduation, he became an officer in the Imperial German Navy from 1912 to 1918, holding the rank of lieutenant commander. After leaving the navy, he studied agriculture and in 1921 became director of the Chamber of Agriculture. He was married to Elisabeth Dryander, a travel writer.
Career.
Party politician (1924 to 1930).
In 1924, Treviranus supported the German National People's Party (DNVP) and was responsible for the Free State of Lippe. As a representative of the moderate wing of the DNVP he rejected the extreme right led by Alfred Hugenberg who became party president in 1928. In the summer of 1929, Treviranus together with Hans Schlange-Schöningen was one of two prominent DNVP "Reichstag" deputies resigned from the party's caucus in protest against the Young Plan referendum bill which they called irresponsible in the extreme, to be joined shortly afterwards by the former chairman Count Kuno von Westarp and other 20 DNVP MRDs leaving the party and forming the more moderate Conservative People's Party.
Treviranus politically supported a center-right Government coalition. His goal was to align the CPP coalition with the moderate right. The center-right alliance should conduct comprehensive reforms. With this objective, Treviranus had built close relationships and had good contacts.
Treviranus has played a significant role in the development of Brüning's government in March 1930. In December 1929 he had participated in preliminary discussions with Brüning, Schleicher, Defence Minister Wilhelm Gröner and President Hindenburg's State Secretary Otto Meissner, at the house of his national conservative party friend Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von Willisen. Hindenburg gave Brüning the task of building a Cabinet that would govern without the Social Democrats (SPD).
Government Minister (1930 to 1932).
Treviranus' first position in the new government was as Minister for the Occupied Territories, being those parts of the Rhineland still under French and Belgian occupation following World War I. After the occupation forces were reduced following the Young Plan in June 1930 he became Minister without Portfolio and he liaised with industry for Hindenburg and Brüning.
Before the General Election of 1930, Treviranus, in co-operation with politically influential military leaders, tried to re-organise the party system. He negotiated forming a loose middle-class electoral alliance to secure a majority for Brüning. This was funded by generous donations from big business but it was not successful
From 9 October 1931 to 30 May 1932 he served in Brüning's second cabinet as Minister of Transport.
The Government adopted a right wing nationalist stance during election campaigns and also at Cabinet meetings. When French Foreign Minister Aristide Briand submitted a plan for a European Union it was rejected by the entire Cabinet, and Treviranus said that the plan as an attack on the current German foreign policy at that time. In Cabinet meetings he pushed to get the Versailles Treaty revised.
As Reich Commissioner for Eastern Germany, he was not successful in saving the country from bankruptcy and after this failure he resigned in August 1931.
The Brüning government went through a crisis in autumn 1931 with a worsening economic situation. Treviranus once again liaised between businesses and the Government. On behalf of Brüning, he advised the major Ruhr industrialists Paul Reusch and Fritz Springorum not to collaborate with the National Socialists and German nationalists. However, the Government fell when embarrassing documents about the behaviour of industry and the banks during the crisis came to light. In the parliamentary elections of 31 July 1932, Treviranus lost his seat as did his conservative People's Party. Treviranus went into business; he was chairman of the Upper Silesian Bata shoe factory. His political career was over at the age of 41.
Escape and emigration.
On 30 June 1934, Treviranus narrowly escaped arrest and probably death. This was part of the "Röhm putsch", one of the political purges in the early summer of 1934. Whilst in exile, he describes how in the early afternoon that day a large number of police and SS men entered his house. He and his daughter were playing tennis in the garden when she cried out "front of house full of Nazis!" He got away by jumping over the garden fence, and climbed into his car which had the key already in the ignition and drove away at high speed. Five rifle shots fortunately missed. For several days he was hidden by friends, and then helped into Holland by the same person who had helped Heinrich Brüning to flee. It is not clear who put Treviranus' name on the list of persons to be arrested but there is evidence that he was hated by Hitler personally.
After a few days stay in Holland, he went to Great Britain. He met many well-known politicians including Churchill and Anthony Eden, at whose behest, he was asked about the character of Hitler and the Nazi movement. He warned of Hitler's aggressive expansion plan. He was formally expatriated in 1939 by the German Reich and at the outbreak of war went to Canada where he worked as a farmer.
Later years (1945 to 1971).
After 1945, Treviranus advised America on the allocation of loans to German companies as part of Marshall Aid. In 1949 he returned to Germany. In the 1950s, his name became associated with a gambling scandal. In the 1960s he worked as a defence lobbyist in Bonn. He died in 1971 during a stay in Florence.

Marie de Castellane

Princess Marie Radziwill (Marie Dorothée Élisabeth; "née" Castellane; 19 February 1840, château de Rochecotte10 July 1915) was a French noblewoman, a member of the house of Castellane. The famous dandy Boni de Castellane was her nephew.
Life.
The daughter of Henri de Castellane and Pauline de Talleyrand-Périgord, Marie de Castellane married prince Antoine Radziwill (1833–1904), a member of the House of Lords of Prussia and general "à la suite" of William I, German Emperor, at Sagan on 3 October 1857. They had four children: Jerzy (George) (1860–1914), Élisabeth (1861–1950), Helena (1874–1958) and Stanislas (1880–1920).
She spent a large part of her life in Berlin, where (according to Abel Hermant) she was "the Apis bull in person and the queen of Berlin".
From 1881 to 1886, she took on the restoration of the Radziwill castle at Nieswiez (Nesvizh, Belorussia), allowing her to save its archives and library, add a terrace flanked by Neo Gothic tourelles and redesign the park in the English style (1878–1911).
In 1906 she published the "Souvenirs" of her grandmother, the duchesse de Dino and, in 1909, a "Chronique de 1831 à 1862", also based on the duchess's papers. Her own memoirs were published in 1931 as "Souvenirs de la princesse Radziwill (née Castellane) 1840–1873. Une française à la cour de prusse" ("Memoirs of Princess Radziwill, "née" Castellane, 1840–1873: A Frenchwoman at the Court of Prussia").

BAE Systems Maritime – Naval Ships

BAE Systems Maritime – Naval Ships is a wholly owned subsidiary company of BAE Systems plc, specialising in naval surface shipbuilding and combat systems integration. One of three divisions of BAE Systems Maritime, along with BAE Systems Maritime – Submarines and BAE Systems Maritime – Maritime Services, it is the largest shipbuilding company in the United Kingdom, one of the largest shipbuilders in Europe, and one of the world's largest builders of complex warships.
It was originally formed as a joint stock subsidiary on 1 July 2008, with the merger of BAE Systems Surface Fleet Solutions and VT Shipbuilding, creating a new firm named BVT Surface Fleet. The new firm incorporated the BAE Systems Surface Fleet Solutions operated shipyards at Scotstoun and Govan on the River Clyde in Glasgow and the VT Shipbuilding facilities within the Naval Base at Portsmouth.
BAE Systems subsequently acquired VT Group's share of the joint venture on 30 October 2009 and renamed the business BAE Systems Surface Ships Ltd.
On 1 January 2011, BAE Systems Surface Ships was operationally integrated with BAE Systems Submarine Solutions to form BAE Systems Maritime. On 1 January 2012, BAE Systems Surface Ships was formally restructured and rebranded as BAE Systems Maritime – Naval Ships and BAE Systems Maritime – Maritime Services, the former incorporating the shipbuilding operations and combat systems development and the latter in-service support.
History.
Defence Industrial Strategy.
The Ministry of Defence's (MOD) 2005 Defence Industrial Strategy encouraged BAE and VT Group to form a naval shipbuilding joint venture with the aim of maintaining the UK's naval shipbuilding capability in the long-term. In return, during 2008, the MOD signed a Terms of Business Agreement which pledged that the vast majority of its future naval orders will be placed with the new company for 15 years.
Explaining the rationale for the joint venture from VT Group's perspective, its CEO Paul Lester described shipbuilding as a "lumpy" business, dependent on large contracts placed at irregular intervals. Another issue was the competition between VT and BAE: "We don't want to get into a dogfight with BAE over who would be the survivor... That's what you'd be talking about at some stage."
BAE and VT concluded the merger discussions in early 2008, however creation of BVT Surface Fleet was conditional on the signing of contracts for the "Queen Elizabeth" class aircraft carriers. Following the Ministry of Defence's announcement on 20 May 2008 that it intended to proceed with the manufacturing stage of the project, BAE announced its intention to finalise the joint venture arrangements with VT Group. This was completed on 11 June 2008 and, following VT Group shareholder approval on 30 June, the joint venture became operational on 1 July.
BAE Systems and VT Group owned 55% and 45% of the company respectively, however they had equal board representation and voting rights.
In return, VT Group acquired BAE System's 50% share in their other joint venture company Flagship Training, now known as VT Flagship. BVT Surface Fleet subsumed another BAE/VT joint venture, Fleet Support Limited, a ship repair, maintenance and marine engineering company, based within HMNB Portsmouth.
The new 15-year Terms of Business Agreement with the Ministry of Defence did result in some controversy however. On 30 June 2009, a BVT memo was leaked which suggested that two of the company's three shipyards could be closed following completion of Queen Elizabeth class carrier construction. In response to the leak, BVT said the memo was "worst case scenario planning" and that it continues to invest in the future of all its yards. However a MOD spokesman said "MOD had to look at the consequences of reduced demand for navy shipbuilding."
Locations.
BAE Systems Surface Fleet Solutions owned two shipyards on the River Clyde in Glasgow: Scotstoun (formerly Yarrow Shipbuilders Ltd) and Govan (formerly Kvaerner Govan, Govan Shipbuilders, Upper Clyde Shipbuilders and Fairfields), shipyards that have a corporate heritage extending back as far as 1834. VT Shipbuilding (formerly Vosper Thornycroft) owned shipbuilding facilities completed in 2003 within HMNB Portsmouth and a boatyard, VT Halmatic, in Portchester. These facilities were transferred to BVT Surface Fleet, although the VT Halmatic yard was subsequently sold to Trafalgar Wharf, with the Halmatic Small Boats Centre of Excellence moving to a new facility in Portsmouth Naval Base.
BAE Systems Surface Fleet Solutions also operated an additional project management centre at Filton in Bristol, situated close to key stakeholders at MoD Abbey Wood, which was transferred to BVT. The BAE Systems Submarine Solutions Shipyard at Barrow-in-Furness was not included in the joint venture, although since January 2011 Submarines and Surface Ships were operationally integrated under BAE Systems Maritime.
Exit by VT Group.
At the time of BVT's creation, VT Group was expected to eventually sell its minority share to BAE Systems through a put option, but not within three years. However on 28 January 2009 VT Group announced its intention to sell its share. VT Group's put option valued its share at a minimum of £380 million subject to conditions; however it received £346 million after various payments to BAE. In addition, VT Group agreed to pay £43 million compensation to BVT for cost overruns on contracts with Trinidad & Tobago and Oman that BVT had inherited from VT Shipbuilding. VT Group's net proceeds from the sale of its share in BVT to BAE Systems were therefore £303 million.
Products and Services.
Aircraft carriers and Amphibious assault ships.
BAE Systems Maritime is undertaking a majority of the workload for the "Queen Elizabeth" class aircraft carriers. As part of the Aircraft Carrier Alliance, Thales and Babcock are also involved in the project. The company's shipyards have previously had experience of constructing large Amphibious assault ships, including the "Ocean" class LPH, the "Albion" class LPD and the "Bay" class LSD(A)s.
Destroyers.
BAE's three shipyards all build sections of the Type 45 destroyer, which was previously built as a collaboration between BAE and VT Group. As of March 2013 "Daring", "Dauntless", "Diamond", "Dragon", "Defender" and "Duncan" have all entered service with the Royal Navy. The first of class entered service in May 2009.
BAE is studying the UXV Combatant concept based on a destroyer hull for the operation of unmanned land, air and sea systems.
Frigates and Corvettes.
BAE Systems Maritime inherited the £400 million "Khareef" class Corvette project from VT Group, which will see three 99m ships delivered to the Royal Navy of Oman by the end of 2012.
BAE Systems Maritime – Naval Ships' yards have also delivered the following in the recent past:
Design work is currently underway on the Type 26 frigate project for the Royal Navy, as part of the wider Global Combat Ship programme, which will eventually replace the Type 23 frigates currently in service.
Offshore Patrol Vessels and Fast Attack Craft.
The company completed three "Port of Spain" class OPVs for the Trinidad and Tobago Defence Force in 2010. After the contract was cancelled by the Trinidad & Tobago government in September 2010, these vessels were subsequently contracted for delivery to the Brazilian Navy in January 2012. A technology transfer agreement with Bangkok Dock to build a similar 90m OPV, HTMS "Krabi", for the Royal Thai Navy was agreed in June 2009.
BAE Systems Maritime also has a technology transfer agreement in place with Elefsis Shipyards for the construction of the "Roussen" class Fast Attack Craft for the Hellenic Navy, which are based on the "Barzan (Vita) class" FACs currently in service with the Qatar Armed Forces; itself based upon Vosper Thornycroft's 56m patrol craft built for the Royal Navy of Oman and the Kenya Navy.
VT Shipbuilding was previously responsible for the construction of the "River" class patrol vessel for the Royal Navy, with through-life maintenance the ongoing responsibility of BAE Systems Maritime; the result of an innovative contractual arrangement in which the company continues to own the four vessels of the class and leases them to the UK Ministry of Defence.
Auxiliaries.
BAE was initially part of a consortium bidding for the Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability (MARS) programme, which was to see up to 6 Replenishment at Sea tankers built for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. BAE was partnered with BMT Defence Services and Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering – the eventual winners – for the project, but subsequently withdrew from the consortium before the final round.
BAE Systems had previously been prime contractor on the "Wave" class tanker programme for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary.
Halmatic Small Boats.
BAE Systems Maritime – Naval Ships' capabilities also extend to Mine countermeasures vessels (The "Sandown" class in service with the Royal Navy, Royal Saudi Navy and Estonian Navy), prime contracting on Hydrographic survey vessels such as the "Echo" class, "Scott" class and the design and production of the smaller Halmatic range of boats such as Landing Craft, Rigid-hulled inflatable boats and Rigid buoyant boats. These products
include the Lifespan Patrol Vessel, Rigid Raider, Mk 6 Assault Boat and Combat Support Boat types currently in service with the British Armed Forces and other Navies, such as the Jordanian Royal Naval Force and the Republic of Singapore Navy.
Support Services.
BAE Systems Maritime's Support services include Supply chain management and Logistics support. The BAE subsidiary BAE Systems Maritime – Maritime Services provides through life maintenance, ship repair and drydock refit services for naval and merchant vessels.
Past projects have included the reactivation of the "Upholder" class, now reactivated as the "Victoria" Class submarines for the Canadian Forces Maritime Command. It has also refitted two ex-Royal Navy Type 22 (Batch 2) frigates for the Romanian Naval Forces and a similar programme for the Chilean Navy involving the refurbishment of three ex-Royal Navy Type 23 frigates.
In July 2009, BVT Surface Fleet established the Gulf Logistics and Naval Support joint venture with Abu Dhabi Shipbuilding, to provide in-region maritime support services for CCASG member states.

Apatheia

Apatheia (; from "a-" "without" and "pathos" "suffering" or "passion") in Stoic philosophy refers to a state of mind where one is not disturbed by the passions. It is best translated by the word equanimity rather than indifference. The word "apatheia" has a quite different meaning to the modern English apathy, which has a negative connotation. According to the Stoics, "apatheia" was the quality that characterized the sage.
Whereas Aristotle had claimed that virtue was to be found in the golden mean between excess and deficiency of emotion ("metriopatheia"), the Stoics sought freedom from all passions ("apatheia"). It meant eradicating the tendency to react emotionally or egotistically to external events – the things we cannot control. For the Stoics, it was the optimum rational response to the world, for we cannot control things that are caused by the will of others or by Nature; we can only control our own will. This did not mean a loss of feeling, or total disengagement from the world. The Stoic who performs correct (virtuous) judgments and actions as part of the world-order experiences contentment ("eudaimonia") and good feelings ("eupatheia").
The Pyrrhonian skeptics also sought the eradication of feelings when disturbance depends on belief, but allowed for only a moderation of feeling when based on sensations such as pain. The term was later adopted by Plotinus in his development of Neoplatonism, in which "apatheia" was the soul's freedom from emotion achieved when it reaches its purified state. 
The term passed into early Christian teaching, whereby "apatheia" meant freedom from unruly urges or compulsions. It is still used in this sense in Orthodox monasticism.

2P START!

2PSTART! was a gaming webcomic created by Tim Harding and Ray Hargreaves. The website (2pstart.com) was updated every week with a new comic on Thursday and a new podcast on Monday. Originally, the comic was posted on Wednesdays, but as of January 27, 2010, the comic was moved onto Thursdays. The comic was regularly featured on Joystiq (their fifth comic "The Truth Is Revealed" won the best webcomic on March 22, 2007 - See Awards and nominations for other award-winning comics). It was also part of the Gamers Pair of Dice Gaming Webcomic Network (found here).
Comic.
The comic was created as a collaboration between Ray and Tim; Tim usually thinks of an idea or story line and then gives that idea to Ray to draw in Adobe Illustrator. The comics are usually something funny or odd related to video games and usually involve humorously criticizing an aspect of a recent video game or video game console, creating a story about a video game character, or taking a strange facet of one of the previous and expanding upon it to the point of ridiculousness.
In the comic, both Ray and Tim had comic counterparts, but unlike Penny Arcade's characters, they used their real names and resembled themselves in appearance. Their characters sometimes have appeared in the comics to show the gaming world from a "real life" perspective (though this line has been crossed once or twice, such as in the comic "This is How I Roll" or in the comic "The Makeover"). Tim also had a Mii version of himself, named TiMii, which appeared from time to time. A Mii version of Ray, named DoRayMii, appeared in more recent comics, although DoRayMii was executed worse.
The 2P START! style did have some consistent features. For example, characters were drawn with a relatively thick outline around them and skinny characters were given "Nubby" elbows or knees to exaggerate this fact. The characters of Tim and Ray had specific trademark characteristic themselves: Ray was usually wearing Sonic the Hedgehog's "light speed shoes," and Tim was generally shown drinking Dr. Pepper, his favorite soda (with two noted exceptions: in comic 113 "In Poor Taste," where he is eating Doritos as part of an advertising scheme, and comic 167 "Now Boarding," where he is seen drinking Diet Dr. Pepper as part of the 2P End! story arc). The website's Comic #171, was submitted on May 20, 2010, under the fitting name of 2P FINISH!, where they end the story arc with a comic that fits the role of the end of the series. It is reminiscent of some of the jokes of their comics, and ends with a message that was apparently meant for the comic's Ray, but works for about any fan of the series.
Podcast: 2P START! Live!
The podcast, named "2P START! Live!", features Tim and Ray talking about various things in the gaming world and on the comic itself. The podcast was edited by Ray to include several multimedia effects and background music. It was released in two formats: the mp3 format contains simply the audio, while the m4a format contains the audio accompanied by a PowerPoint-style video which shows images and allows links that Ray "puts up" on the podcast. Since the end of the comic, Ray and Tim have chosen to release occasional Postmortem podcasts for special occasions, such as E3, Lost ending, and Ray getting a girlfriend.
Segments included:
Ray : For every great comic comes great comments, and this week's Suggestion Box was no different.
Ray : It's time... for the dreaded Black Doom Award.
Tim : Mwahahaha...
Ray : Each week, Tim and I both mention a terrible choice made related to video games in honor of the worst character Sonic Team has ever created, Black Doom.
The Mystic Cave Zone music from Sonic the Hedgehog 2 plays here.
The Level Up theme from plays here.
The Tunnel music from Rhythm Heaven plays here.

The Bubble Boy (Seinfeld)

"The Bubble Boy" is the 47th episode of the American sitcom "Seinfeld", as well as the nickname of Donald Sanger, one of the characters in the episode. It is the seventh episode of the fourth season. The episode was written by Larry David and Larry Charles, directed by Tom Cherones, and aired on October 7, 1992. American journalists had in the past covered "bubble boys" who lived in quarantine due to an immune deficiency. The coverage often played for sympathy, ignoring anything about the subject other than his medical condition. The bubble boy in this episode (played by Jon Hayman), however, is rude, selfish and impossible to sympathize with. He is never seen fully on-screen, except for a pair of gloves that he uses to reach through the barrier; when he is shown exiting the house on a stretcher, he is partially covered by paramedics.
Plot.
Jerry, George, George's girlfriend Susan, and Elaine plan to travel upstate to Susan's family's lakeside cabin. In the coffee shop, Elaine and Jerry meet a kindly father (played by Brian Doyle-Murray) who describes the sad life of his young son Donald who lives in a "plastic bubble" (a plastic divider which creates a germ-free sterile environment). As Donald is a fan of Jerry's, Jerry is forced by Elaine to visit Donald on the way to the cabin to cheer him up. However, Jerry gets lost and George and Susan arrive before him. While waiting for Jerry to arrive, they play "Trivial Pursuit" with the "bubble boy".
The Trivial Pursuit game ends prematurely when George disputes the answer to the question, "Who invaded Spain in the 8th century?" Donald answers "the Moors," but the question card, due to a misprint, says the answer is "the Moops." George refuses to give Donald credit, and Donald attacks him. As Susan tries to defend George, she punctures and depressurizes the bubble, inadvertently making George look guilty, since he was struggling with Donald.
While this is happening, Jerry and Elaine decide to exit and go to a cafe. It turns out that a waitress is a fan of Jerry's as well. She asks for an autographed picture of Jerry. Jerry does not like what he writes, so he asks for it back. The waitress refuses, and it escalates to the point of the waitress choking Jerry. However, this is interrupted by a man who announces that Donald was attacked by George, and that his house is right down the street from the cafe. Jerry and Elaine meet up with George and Susan at the house before being attacked by the residents of the town.
Meanwhile, Kramer and Jerry's girlfriend Naomi (played by Jessica Lundy) attempt to rendezvous with Jerry, Elaine, George, and Susan at Susan's family's country home. Kramer carelessly leaves his lit cigar near some newspapers, which causes a fire that destroys Susan's family's cabin. The other four travelers arrive shortly after the firefighters.
Eponymous computer virus.
On November 10, 1999 a computer virus named "BubbleBoy," was discovered, apparently named after this episode. This was the first malware of its kind, having been actually able to activate itself (via an embedded Visual Basic script) upon the recipient opening the e-mail contents, as opposed to running an attachment. As such, in spite of not actually being dangerous, the virus changed the concept of antivirus technology.

Drivenik Castle

Drivenik Castle () is a castle in the hinterland of Crikvenica and Novi Vinodolski, in the northern part of the Adriatic coast, western Croatia.
The castle of Drivenik is first mentioned in 1228 as one of the co-signers of the Vinodol Code. It is located near the village of Drivenik in the Vinodol region, on a high point named "Glavica" (181 m above sea level). The castle sits in front of the mountain range called ‘Križišće’ opposite Tribaljsko polje (Tribalj field). 
From the 13th century the castle was the seat of the district administration, and upon the arrival of the Frankopans, their deputy Dragoljub resided there in 1288. In the 16th century (1571 based on an inscription on its walls) the castle was expanded in size and in the style of Renaissance fortresses it received round towers on its corners. Then in 1577, the castle was ruled by the noble family Zrinski.
The construction of the road in 1746 linked Drivenik to Novi Vinodolski and Bakar. This allowed the inhabitants to move from the hilltop down into the valley where present day Drivenik developed along the roadway. Ultimately the castle was abandoned as an active settlement, only the church of Sveti Dujam (St. Domnius) and its cemetery remained as active properties.
Near the castle is the chapel of St. Stephen, built probably at the end of the 16th century with its tower containing three bells. The church has three building phases: Romanesque, Gothic and Baroque. The church originally contained a late Gothic period 'Pieta' sculpture titled the "Mourning of Christ" and a Baroque period wood carved "Golden Altar". Today both are in the Museum of Art and Crafts in Zagreb.
The chapel of St. Martin is situated at the cemetery. It has Baroque frescoes dating from the 18th century. On its wall is a fresco "Taken down from the Cross". There is the Way of the Cross with four shrines near the cemetery and at its end Calvary is marked with three high crosses dating from 1768. The cemetery also contains a monument to fallen fighters from World War II.
The parish church of Sveti Dujam (St. Domnius) contains three naves and a bell-tower in the front. Originally it was built with one nave, without the open bell-tower. Sveti Dujam’s bell tower was built in 1806 and the entrance beneath the bell tower was constructed in 1846.
The sanctuary was decorated by Anton Cej in 1894 when the main marble altar was constructed. The church floor contains burial vaults with the remains of a prominent local family Klarić (Gaspar 1653 and Marko 1753). The church underwent partial restoration in 1968.
In the nearby town of Drivenik, a monument has been erected to the famous Croatian miniaturist J.J. Klović (Julio Clovio).

Victor Chandler

Victor Chandler (born 18 April 1951) is a British businessman, chairman of the company BetVictor, legally Victor Chandler International.
Off-shore bookmaking.
Victor Chandler is often credited as the first bookmaker to recognise the importance of online gambling, particularly online casinos and poker, as well as being the first to move his gaming business offshore with his firm BetVictor.com.
In the early 1990s, Victor began to accept football wagers from far-eastern clients and, in doing so, he recognised the potential growth in foreign markets. He opened up an office in Antigua to enable these clients to bet without the need to pay UK tax.
In the UK, punters were required to pay a 9% betting tax but, in 1996, Chandler obtained a betting licence in Gibraltar and in 1999 moved his entire business there. Over the next decade the company grew quickly and he now employs over 400 people and is the largest private employer on the Rock. Victor Chandler has offered free betting from £5, and in 2001 the then Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, announced that he was scrapping UK betting tax, a huge victory for punters.
Horse ownership.
Chandler has owned many racehorses over the past three decades in UK, South Africa & US. Following some success over the years, Chandler formed a syndicate called "Men In Our Position" which owned the 2009 Cheltenham Triumph Hurdle winner Zaynar, trained by Nicky Henderson. Zaynar re-appeared on 21 November 2009 at Ascot Racecourse where he demolished a top-class field in winning the Coral Ascot Hurdle by 6 lengths as reported by the Racing Post. Zaynar was then aimed at the Champion Hurdle, for which he was one of the Ante-Post favourites for the race. After running a galant race Zaynar finished third in the race.
Personal wealth.
In the 2009 Sunday Times rich list Chandler was ranked 362nd with a fortune estimated at £150 million, falling from the previous year's estimation of £365 million.
Lucian Freud friendship.
In an article in the Observer in June 2008 Victor spoke of his friendship with the artist Lucian Freud, including the portrait of Victor which Freud completed which was sold for £4.5m in 2006.
Nottingham Forest.
In July 2009 Victor Chandler agreed to become the main sponsor of Nottingham Forest F.C. for a reported "significant six-figure fee". As part of his sponsorship he offered to pay for the following year's season tickets for Forest fans who opened an online account should Forest win. At the time of the offer Forest were rated as 80/1 outsiders to win the league, but after an amazing run of 19 games undefeated, Forest were second in the Championship in January 2010 and Chandler claimed Forest winning the league would cost him approximately £6m. After a poor March and April Forest's chances of winning the league receded and they instead qualified for the Football League play-offs where they were eliminated by Blackpool at the semi-final stage.
In March 2010 Victor Chandler announced a two-year extension to the Nottingham Forest sponsorship.

Theodora Kantakouzene, wife of Alexios IV of Trebizond

Theodora Kantakouzene Megale Komnene (died 12 November 1426) was the Empress consort of Alexios IV of Trebizond.
Family.
Theodora's parentage is described by Donald Nicol as "obscure". The "Ecthesis Chronica" implies she was the daughter of a "protostrator", and Nicol notes there are chronological grounds against identifying her father with one Manuel Kantakouzenos who was sent on a diplomatic mission to Sultan Mehmet I in the winter of 1420-1421.
Life.
Born in Constantinople around 1382, Theodora was only thirteen when she became in 1395, the consort of the co-emperor Alexios IV of Trebizond, who was approximately the same age. She became ruling empress when her husband became sole emperor in Trebizond at the death of her father-in-law the emperor Manuel III of Trebizond, in 1417. Celebrated for her great beauty, she died in 1426. 
In the chronicle of Laonikos Chalkokondyles appears the story that Theodora became the mistress of the "protovestiarios" of the court of Trebizond, an act of adultery which provoked her son, John IV, to murder the gentleman, after which he imprisoned his parents in the palace. His parents were rescued by the archons of the city who sent John into exile in Georgia. But this gossip is contradicted by the chronology and the other sources. Further, this story appears only in a passage inserted by another hand into Chalkokondyles' manuscript by another hand. It may be the writer of this story has confused with a precedent affair between a member of the imperial dynasty of Trebizond and a "protovestiarios", namely Manuel III, the father-in-law of Theodora. This event is reported by the Spanish traveller Ruy Gonzáles de Clavijo, who visited Trebizond in 1404 not much after the facts. He adds that this scandalous relationship induced the young Alexios IV, Theodora's husband, to rebel against his father Manuel. In fact, John IV rebelled against his father Alexios IV only after the death of Theodora (1426), at the end of 1427, certainly because his late mother couldn't now prevent the increasing rivalry between father and son to break out. On the contrary, the virtue, the piety, the great qualities and especially the perfect fidelity of Theodora are celebrated by his compatriot, the future cardinal Bessarion, in the three monodies he dedicated to his benefactress, and in a special discourse of consolation addressed to Alexios IV, really desperate by the death of his beloved empress. Last but not least, John IV himself, after his accession of the throne in 1429, paid homage to the virtues of his deceased mother in a chrysobull for the convent she founded.
Children.
Wife of Alexios IV of Trebizond, with whom she had six known children:
Empress.
Manuel III died on 5 March 1417. Alexios IV succeeded him with Theodora as his Empress consort. She remained Empress for nearly a decade to her own death at the third hour of the night. Theodora was buried in the Church of Theotokos Chrysokephalos in the cemetery of Gidon with the other Emperors of Trebizond. Basilios Bessarion composed three monodies on her death, and a consolation addressed to her husband Alexios IV, who survived her by three years.

List of Brigham Young's wives

Brigham Young was perhaps the most famous polygamist of the early Latter Day Saint movement, marrying a total of 55 wives, 54 of them after becoming a Latter Day Saint. He stated that upon being taught about plural marriage, "It was the first time in my life that I desired the grave." By the time of his death, Young had 57 children by 16 of his wives; 46 of his children reached adulthood.
Number of wives.
Sources have varied on the number of Young's wives due to differences in what observers have considered to be a "wife". There were 55 women that Young was sealed to during his lifetime. While the majority of the sealings were "for eternity" (i.e., in the afterlife), some were "for time only" (until death). However, it is suspected that not all of the 55 marriages were conjugal, and Young did not live with a number of his wives or publicly hold them out as wives, which has led to confusion on numbering.
Of his 55 wives, 21 had never been married before; 16 were widows; six were divorced; six had living husbands; and the marital status of six others are unknown.
At the time of Young's death, 19 of his wives had predeceased him, he was divorced from ten, and 23 survived him, with the status of four unknown. In his will, Young shared his estate with the 16 surviving wives who had lived with him; the six surviving non-conjugal wives were not mentioned in the will.
Lion House.
In 1856, Young built the Lion House to accommodate his sizable family. This building remains a Salt Lake City landmark, together with the Beehive House, another Brigham Young family home. A contemporary of Young wrote: "It was amusing to walk by Brigham Young's big house, a long rambling building with innumerable doors. Each wife has an establishment of her own, consisting of parlor, bedroom, and a front door, the key of which she keeps in her pocket".

Ozalj Castle

Ozalj Castle () is a castle in the town of Ozalj, Croatia.
The Ozalj fortress, located on the stone cliff perched above the Kupa river, is one of the best known fortifications of this type in Croatia. It is a very old stronghold (first mentioned in 1244) which has been converted into a castle. The popularity of this castle is because this was the joint castle of Croatian noble families of Frankopan and Zrinski. In fact, it was the scene of the unlucky Zrinski-Frankopan conspiracy, which significantly marked the history of Croatia. In the castle
there is a museum and a library, and it is in a relatively good state of repair.

Crank It Up (Hadouken! song)

"Crank It Up" is the fifth single from English Grime band Hadouken!'s first album "Music for an Accelerated Culture". It was released on 7 July 2008 following the recent releases of their singles Get Smashed Gate Crash and Declaration of War from the same album. It also bares a large resemblance to MC Lars' "Download This Song".
Music video.
The music video for "Crank It Up" shows lead Hadouken! singer James Smith first emerge from a Hadouken! decorated tape after a series of newspaper pattern based images, showing outlines of band members. The other band members then appear in place of Smith: Alice Spooner, Daniel "Pilau" Rice, Chris Purcell and Nick Rice in a "tearing away paper" animation. The band are then shown performing the song together with a series of images in the background and flashing lights. Soon after, the band are seen performing next to a series of stacked televisions. Members of the band can be seen on the TV screens, and it often zooms in on them in different places, including a street scene. Towards the end of the video, a computer monitor screen can be seen, with animated sillouettes of the band members shown. It appears as if many windows of the same animations showing the band members are opening on the screen. At the end of the video, the trend of bright images and animations continue as more silouttes can be seen in front of a multi-coloured background. The video finishes by zooming away from one television stacked among others, next to where the band were performing earlier on in the video.
On music site Gigwise, the video is described as "a riot from start to finish".
Reception.
Sarah Walters, of Manchester Evening News, published a review of Crank It Up, saying "Yes, it's another glistening nugget in their often incoherent brand of obnoxious digital noise, garage beats and hip-hop patter, but this time there's something oddly right about it."
Another review of the single, on music site Noize Makes Enemies, claims "The frenetic-paced ‘Crank It Up’ is, it could be said, the album’s defining track, laying out the rave-reviving, pigeonhole-swerving, youth-defining spirit at its core. It’s a sonic punk-rock-rave monster – a call to arms for a web-savvy generation to “show some love”, and a nod to the file-sharing, myspace-bound, digital revolution that spawned the Leeds-formed 5 piece."

The unit patrolled the Arnhem sector to support the Airborne invasion of Holland in September 1944, and later in December, transportation facilities during the Battle of the Bulge. During the Western Allied invasion of Germany, the squadron flew ground support missions by strafing trucks, locomotives, and oil depots near Wesel when the Allies crossed the Rhine in March 1945 and continued offensive operations until 21 April 1945.
After the German Capitulation, became part of the United States Air Forces in Europe Army of Occupation, at AAF Station Kaufbeuren, then moved to AAF Station Giebelstadt in early 1946 where it received its first jet aircraft, the P-80A Shooting Star. Inactivated in August 1946 when personnel were demobilized and aircraft were transferred to the 31st Fighter Group.
Reactivated by Strategic Air Command in 1947 as a reconnaissance squadron, equipped with RB-17 Flying Fortress aircraft. Flew aerial photography, mapping, charting, and photo reconnaissance missions, some of which flew around borders of the Soviet Union and over the Soviet Occupation Zone of Germany. Little was known about the air defense capability of the Soviet Union at this time and the most effective way of determining their capability was to probe the borders and see whether they would respond. Gradually the RB-17s and other aircraft mapped the perimeter of the Soviet Air Defenses from the Baltic to the Sea of Okhotsk, north of Japan.
Upgraded to RB-29 Superfotress aircraft in 1949 and continued its reconnaissance mission, however inactivated in 1949 due to budget reductions. Reactivated in 1950 at Ramey Air Force Base, Puerto Rico, again flying RB-29s performing strategic reconnaissance, charting photography, precise electronic geodetic mapping, and electronic reconnaissance missions, upgrading to RB-50 Superfortresses in 1952.
Equipped in 1953 with RB-47E Stratojets and conducted a variety of classified overflights of the Soviet Union during the 1950s. Some of these flights were mounted from Thule in Greenland and probed deep into the heart of the Soviet Union, taking a photographic and radar recording of the route attacking SAC bombers would follow to reach their targets. Flights which involved penetrating mainland Russia were termed SENSINT (Sensitive Intelligence) missions. One RB-47 even managed to fly 450 miles inland and photograph the city of Igarka in Siberia. Beginning in 1958, used 3 specially modified Stratojets, known as EB-47E’s (Tell Two), in Operation Iron Work to monitor Soviet missile tests from Baikonur, Tyuratam and Kapustin Yar. The early EB-47E ‘Tell Two’ was easily recognizable as the aircraft were equipped with 2 large telemetry pods attached to either side of the fuselage, just aft of the nose, which intercepted data from Soviet data from missile tests. A later version of the ‘Tell Two’ housed the telemetry pods internally and had a streamlined nose. The USAF long range radar site at Samsum in Turkey, on the south coast of the Black Sea, also assisted in this activity.
Missions flown on a reduced scale after February 1958 when events showed the vulnerability of the RB-47 to Soviet air defenses and the development of the U-2 aircraft.
When the 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing relocated to Offutt AFB on the 16th of August 1966, the 38th took over the Operation Looking Glass mission from the 34th Air Refueling Squadron and operated EC-135C as well as operating 3 KC-135R Rivit Stand reconnaissance aircraft. On 1 April 1970 SAC reorganized the Post Attack Command and Control mission and the 38th inactivated and turned the mission over to the newly 2d Airborne Command and Control Squadron.
The squadron flew worldwide strategic reconnaissance including in support of the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, Operation Urgent Fury in October 1983, Operation El Dorado Canyon in April 1986, Operation Just Cause in December 1989, and Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm from January–February 1991.

Ilok Castle ( or "Gradina Ilok") or Odescalchi Castle overlooks the town of Ilok in eastern Croatia. It is built on a hill above the town centre, offering views on the Danube and the Pannonian Plain. 
The castle was originally built in the 15th century by Nicholas of Ilok, Croatian viceroy and the king of Bosnia. The Ottomans conquered Ilok in the 16th century. After the victory against the Ottomans at the Battle of Vienna in 1683, the Emperor Leopold I granted the castle, significant properties and the title of the Duke of Syrmia to Livio Odescalchi, nephew of Pope Innocent XI and a member of the powerful Italian aristocratic Odescalchi family, which would own the castle for the next two centuries. In the 18th century, the Odescalchis reconstructed the castle in the Baroque style. The castle was nationalized by authorities of Yugoslavia in 1945. After a restoration, it was opened to visitors in 2010. The lower two floors host the Museum of the Town of Ilok. Wine cellars of the castle are among the most famous in Croatia.

Paciano Rizal

Paciano Rizal (full name: Paciano Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda) (March 9, 1851 – April 13, 1930) was a Filipino general and revolutionary, and the older brother of José Rizal, the national hero of the Philippines.
Early life.
Paciano Rizal was born to Francisco Engracio Rizal Mercado y Alejandro (1818–1897) and Teodora Morales Alonso y Quintos (1827-1911; whose family later changed their surname to "Realonda"), as the second of eleven children born to a wealthy family in the town of Calamba City, Laguna, and grew up witnessing the abuses of the clergy and the Spanish colonial government. His teacher and close friend, Fray José Burgos was implicated in the Cavite Mutiny of 1872 and summarily executed.
Revolutionary.
Paciano joined and actively supported Propaganda Movement for social reforms, and supported the Movement's newspaper, "Diariong Tagalog". An avid supporter of the movement, he did tasks such as collecting funds to finance the said organization, and solicited money for the nationalist paper.
In January 1897, after his younger brother's execution, Paciano joined General Emilio Aguinaldo in Cavite. He was appointed brigadier general of the revolutionary forces, and was elected Secretary of Finance in the Departmental Government of Central Luzon.
During the Philippine-American War (1899–1913), he commanded the Filipino forces in Laguna. U.S. troops captured him in Laguna on 1900. He was released soon after, and he settled in the town of Los Banos, Laguna.
Death.
He lived a quiet life as a gentleman farmer, and died at the age of 79 of tuberculosis.
Popular culture.
He was portrayed by actor Ping Medina as the younger Paciano and at the same time by his real life father Pen Medina as the older Paciano, in the award-winning 1998 film, "José Rizal".

Antiproton Decelerator

The Antiproton Decelerator (AD) is a storage ring at the CERN laboratory in Geneva. It was built as a successor to the Low Energy Antiproton Ring (LEAR) and started operation in the year 2000. The decelerated antiprotons are ejected to one of several connected experiments.
ATHENA.
ATHENA was an antimatter ((cellular)) research project that took place at the Antiproton Decelerator. In August 2002, it was the first experiment to produce 50,000 low-energy antihydrogen atoms, as reported in "Nature". In 2005, ATHENA was disbanded and many of the former members worked on the subsequent ALPHA experiment.
ATHENA physics.
For antihydrogen to be created, antiprotons and positrons (also called antielectrons) must first be prepared. The antiprotons are provided by the Antiproton Decelerator, while positrons are obtained from a positron accumulator. Both are then led into a recombination trap, where they bind together and form an antihydrogen atom. After preparation, a high-resolution detector confirms that antihydrogen was created. It then looks at the antihydrogen spectrum in order to compare it against "normal" hydrogen spectrum.
ATHENA collaboration.
The ATHENA collaboration comprised the following institutions:
ATRAP.
The ATRAP collaboration at CERN developed out of TRAP, a collaboration whose members pioneered cold antiprotons, cold positrons, and first made the ingredients of cold antihydrogen to interact. ATRAP members also pioneered accurate hydrogen spectroscopy and first observed hot antihydrogen atoms. The motto of the ATRAP collaboration is "It's a trap!". ]
ATRAP physics.
ATRAP is a collaboration between physicists around the world with the goal of creating and experimenting with antihydrogen. ATRAP accumulates positrons with using a radioactive sodium-22 source. These positrons are trapped in a Penning trap and then combined with antiprotons to create antihydrogen. The long-term goal is to trap antihydrogen in a Ioffe trap and collect enough antihydrogen to perform accurate laser spectroscopy on it.
ATRAP collaboration.
The ATRAP collaboration comprises the following institutions:
ASACUSA.
ASACUSA (Atomic Spectroscopy And Collisions Using Slow Antiprotons) is an experiment testing for CPT-symmetry by laser spectroscopy of antiprotonic helium and microwave spectroscopy of the hyperfine structure of antihydrogen. It also measures atomic and nuclear cross sections of antiprotons on various targets at extremely low energies. The spokesperson for the experiment is Ryugo S. Hayano from the University of Tokyo. It was originally proposed in 1997.
ALPHA.
The ALPHA experiment is designed to trap neutral antihydrogen in a magnetic trap, and conduct experiments on them. The ultimate goal of this endeavour is to test CPT symmetry through comparison of the atomic spectra of hydrogen and antihydrogen (see hydrogen spectral series). The ALPHA collaboration consists of some former members of the ATHENA collaboration (the first group to produce cold antihydrogen, in 2002), as well as a number of new members.
ALPHA physics.
ALPHA faces several challenges. Magnetic traps – wherein neutral atoms are trapped using their magnetic moments – are notoriously weak; only atoms with kinetic energies equivalent to less than one kelvin may be trapped. The cold antihydrogen created first in 2002 by the ATHENA and the ATRAP collaborations was produced by merging cold plasmas of positrons (also called antielectrons) and antiprotons. While this method has been quite successful, it creates antiatoms with kinetic energies too large to be trapped. Furthermore, to do laser spectroscopy on these anti-atoms, it is important that they are in their ground state, something which does not seem to be the case for the majority of the anti-atoms created thus far.
Antiprotons are received by the Antiproton Decelerator and are 'mixed' with positrons from a specially-designed positron accumulator in a versatile Penning trap. The central region where the mixing and thus antihydrogen formation takes place is surrounded by a superconducting octupole magnet and two axially separated short solenoids "mirror-coils" to form a "minimum-B" magnetic trap. Once trapped antihydrogen can be subjected to detailed study and be compared to hydrogen.
In order to detect trapped antihydrogen atoms ALPHA also comprises a silicon vertex detector. This cylindrically shaped detector consists of three layers of silicon panels (strips). Each panel acts as a position sensitive detector for charged particles passing through. By recording how the panels are excited ALPHA can reconstruct the tracks of charged particles traveling through their detector. When an antiproton annihilates (disintegrates) the process typically results in the emission of 3-4 charged pions. These can be observed by the ALPHA detector and by reconstructing their tracks through the detector their origin, and thus the location of the annihilation, can be determined. These tracks are quite distinct from the tracks of cosmic rays which are also detected but are of high energy and pass straight through the detector. By carefully analyzing the tracks ALPHA distinguishes between cosmic rays and antiproton annihilations.
To detect successful trapping the ALPHA trap magnet that created the minimum B-field was designed to allow it to be quickly and repeatedly de-energized. The currents' decay during de-energization has a characteristic time of 9 ms, orders of magnitude faster than similar systems. This fast turn-off and the ability to suppress false signal from cosmic rays should allow ALPHA to detect the release of even a single trapped antihydrogen atom during de-energization of the trap.
In order to make antihydrogen cold enough to be trapped the ALPHA collaboration has implemented a novel technique, well known from atomic physics, called evaporative cooling. The motivation for this is that one of the main challenges of trapping antihydrogen is to make it cold enough. State-of-the art minimum-B traps like the one ALPHA comprises have depths in temperature units of order one Kelvin. As no readily available techniques exist to cool antihydrogen, the constituents must be cold and kept cold for the formation. Antiprotons and positrons are not easily cooled to cryogenic temperatures and the implementation of evaporative cooling is thus an important step towards antihydrogen trapping.
ALPHA collaboration.
The ALPHA collaboration comprises the following institutions:
AEGIS.
AEGIS (Antimatter experiment: Gravity, interferometry, spectroscopy), is a proposed experiment to be set up at the Antiproton Decelerator.
AEGIS physics.
AEGIS would attempt to determine if gravity affects antimatter in the same way it affects matter by testing its effect on an antihydrogen beam. By sending a stream of antihydrogen through a series of diffraction gratings, the pattern of light and dark patterns would allegedly enable the position of the beam to be pinpointed with up to 1% accuracy. It was originally proposed in 2007.

Douglas Hyde (author)

Douglas Arnold Hyde (8 April 1911, Worthing, Sussex — 19 September 1996, Kingston upon Thames) was a Communist who was the news editor of the "Daily Worker" until 1948, when he converted to Catholicism and resigned. 
Hyde grew up in Bristol and was brought up as a Methodist. In his youth he was active in a number of political organizations which brought him into contact with Communists. He became a Methodist lay preacher and continued this work for some time in parallel with membership of the Communist party. He was an early convert to Communism, at age 17 in 1928. He was once jailed for two years in southeast Asia while trying to agitate for Communist reforms. After a period working in North Wales he moved to London in 1938. He was the news editor of the "Daily Worker", the largest Communist publication in Britain. After his resignation, he published an autobiography, "I Believed. The Autobiography of a Former British Communist". He also wrote a book, "Dedication and Leadership", about his experiences and the specific tactics of the Communists especially in the way that they recruited their members and built them into leaders. On his death he had allegedly become an agnostic, having had difficulties pursuing social justice and economic equality issues within the Catholic Church.

Trsat Castle

Trsat Castle () is a castle in Trsat, Croatia. It is thought that the castle lies at the exact spot of an ancient Illyrian and Roman fortress. The Croatian noble Vuk Krsto Frankopan is buried in one of the churches. The Trsat castle was completely reconstructed and renovated in the 19th century when the mausoleum of the military commander Laval Nugent was built in its interior. The courtyard of the castle has now been turned into a restaurant and many tourists visit the place during the summer months.
History.
The thirteenth century Trsat castle, whose site has been in use from Roman days for being an easy place from which to control access to the sea along the River Rijeka, is situated on the steep hill overlooking the Rječina gorge on its left bank, just above the town of Rijeka. It may be that a Iapodian hill-fort, Darsata, used to be there, after which the Roman fortification Tarsatica was named. This Roman fort was of vital importance on a road that connected Aquileia to Pannonia and Senia (Senj). It was owned by Frankopan family who built the present castle, on the site occupied by the Illirian Tarsatica, to protect their holdings in Vinodol.
The capture of the Castle of Trsat compelled the Ban of Croatia, Andrew Bot of Bajna (Bajna is a village in Hungary, near Esztergom)), to intervene in the Austro-Venetian war, and in June 1509 he first recaptured Trsat with his Croatian army and then entered Rijeka after expelling the Venetians. In October 1509, the Venetians withdrew for good and Rijeka returned to the possessions of Maximilian of Habsburg. This notable episode is the sole event which links Rijeka with Venice, and consequently with Italy, during the whole of its history from the 7th century on.
In the 17th century the castle fell into decay due to the receding threats from Venice and the Ottoman Empire. Its decline was accelerated by the earthquake of 1750. In the year 1811, during the Napoleonic wars, Captain Hoste in pursuit of the French, arrived with his frigate at Fiume where he made himself lieutenant-governor. The situation in Trieste soon drew him away, but in 1826 he had the satisfaction of handing the castle over to Field-Marshal Nugent, an Irishman then commanding the Austrian troops in the vicinity, for the purpose of conferring on him the rank of an Austrian noble. The general was later honoured by the Austrians and presented with the castle at Trsat as his residence. He had it restored in Neo-Gothic style and built a mausoleum adorned with the coat of arms of the Nugent family. It remained in the Nugent family until nearly the end of the Second World War when the general's great-grand-daughter, Countess Nugent, died at the age of 82.

Dhoondte Reh Jaaoge

Dhoondte Reh Jaoge (, ) is a 2009 Bollywood comedy film produced by UTV Motion Pictures, starring Sonu Sood, Soha Ali Khan, Kunal Khemu, and Paresh Rawal, released 6 March 2009 in India, and 20 March 2009, in the United States. The film is directed by Umesh Shukla and produced by Ronnie Screwvala. The music was composed by duo Sajid-Wajid. The concept of creating a flop film in order to make money is adapted from the Mel Brooks film "The Producers". The film was declared a hit by boxoffice India.
Another movie with the same name was made in 1998 that was directed by Kumar Bhatia. 
Plot.
Set in Mumbai, the film starts with Raj (Paresh Rawal), a good-for-nothing movie director who has released certain films, but none of them ever do well at the box office. He gets threatened by his landlords that if he does not pay them on time, he will be homeless. While chartered accountant Anand (Kunal Khemu) tries to cheer up his girlfriend Neha (Soha Ali Khan) on her birthday. Neha is another useless wannabe actress who Anand takes to a 5-star restaurant for her birthday. Raj meets Ratan (Asrani) at the restaurant. Ratan is the manager of famous Bollywood actor Aryan Kapoor (Sonu Sood), and Raj has come to see Ratan to sign a movie deal with Aryan.
Raj and Ratan buy as much food as they can, and put the bill on Anand, who can not pay for it all that is why he is sent to jail. When he comes out, Anand is eager for revenge, and sees Raj shoplifting. Raj goes over to Aryan and Ratan, and right when he gets the movie contract papers out, Inspector Avtar Gill shows up and arrests Raj for shoplifting, which was recorded by Anand. Raj escapes from jail only to get his movie deal signed, and when Raj is attacked, he is saved by Anand. Anand and Raj come up with a movie plan together, to put money on the movie, ONLY if it is a flop, but if it is a hit, then that's their loss. They collect a lot of money and pretend to be rich and wealthy men to show off in front of Aryan, who signs the papers, and gets in the movie. Anand and Raj have to try and make the movie as bad as they can to get their share on money, but they don't know that each of them has a different plan.
They borrow money from Assassins, who make a deal, if the movie flops then the Assassins will be pleased, but if it is a hit they will get murdered. They use Neha for the actress role, because Anand knows that with Neha in the film if would definitely be a flop. While the movie is filming, they tell Asharraff (Johnny Lever) to be the writer, who mixes up Sholay, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, , and Lagaan (in that order). At the premier, the film is declared as a "hit" and the assassins get ready to kill them both. When Raj is about to escape with the money, he finds that Anand has already looted all the money. Both on the run, meet each other while looking for a hiding place, and both decide there is no better place to hide than Jail itself. The two run in jail for making a fraud film and looting money. Once they come out of jail, the two embrace friendship, and Neha finally marries to Anand, the two get married and Raj and Anand get thinking about creating a real movie.

Emil Kapaun

Emil Joseph Kapaun (April 20, 1916 – May 23, 1951) was a Roman Catholic priest and United States Army chaplain who died as a prisoner of war in the Korean War. For his wartime activities, the Roman Catholic Church has declared him a Servant of God, the first stage on the path to sainthood. On April 11, 2013, President Barack Obama presented the Medal of Honor posthumously to Captain Chaplain Kapaun for his actions on November 1-2, 1950 in Korea. He is the nineth American military chaplain Medal of Honor recipient.
Early life.
Emil Joseph Kapaun was born on April 20, 1916, and grew up on a farm three miles southwest of Pilsen, Kansas. His parents were Enos and Elizabeth Kapaun, Czech immigrants.He graduated from Pilsen High School in May 1930. Kapaun graduated from Conception Abbey seminary college in Conception, Missouri, in June 1936. He attended Kenrick Theological Seminary (now Kenrick-Glennon Seminary), St. Louis, Missouri.
Priest.
On June 9, 1940, Kapaun was ordained a priest at what is now Newman University in Wichita, Kansas. He celebrated his first Mass at St. John Nepomucene in Pilsen, Kansas. In 1943, Kapaun was appointed auxiliary chaplain at the Herington Army Airfield near Herington, Kansas. In December 1943, Kapaun was appointed pastor to replace Fr. Sklenar who had retired. He served in the Pilsen area under the Roman Catholic Diocese of Wichita.
U.S. Army service.
Kapaun joined the United States Army in July 1941. He began his military chaplaincy at Camp Wheeler, Georgia, in October 1944. He and one other chaplain ministered to approximately 19,000 service men and women.
He was sent to India and served in the Burma Theater from April 1945 to May 1946. He ministered to U.S. soldiers and local Missions covering a 2,000 mile territory by jeep. He was promoted to captain in January 1946
He was released from active duty in July 1946. Under the G.I. Bill, he earned a Master of Arts degree in Education under the at the The Catholic University of America in February 1948. In September 1948, he returned to active duty in the US Army and resumed his chaplaincy at Fort Bliss, El Paso, Texas. In December 1949, Kapaun left his parents and Pilsen for the last time, bound for Japan.
In January 1950, he was stationed near Mount Fuji, Japan. He became a chaplain in the 8th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division. On July 15, 1950, the 1st Cavalry Division and Kapaun embarked and left Tokyo Bay sailing for Korea, less than a month after North Korea had invaded South Korea.
The 1st Cavalry Division made the first amphibious landing in the Korean conflict on July 18, 1950. In late August, Kapaun was assigned to duty as Chaplain of the 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment. He soon participated in the fighting on the Pusan perimeter in South Korea. From there, since mid September, Kapaun and the division was constantly on the move northward. On October 9, the division crossed the 38th parallel into North Korea and advanced within 50 miles of the Chinese border. His main complaint was lack of sleep for several weeks at a time. He constantly ministered to the dead and dying while performing baptisms, hearing first confessions, offering Holy Communion and celebrating Mass from an improvised altar set up on the front end of a jeep. He constantly would lose his Mass kit, jeep, and trailer to enemy fire. He told how he was thoroughly convinced that the prayers of many others were what had saved him so many times.
Kapaun was awarded the Bronze Star Medal with "V" device on September 2, 1950 for his actions on August 2, 1950:
He was captured and taken prisoner by Chinese soldiers during the Battle of Unsan near Unsan, North Korea, on November 2, 1950. He and other members of the 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment taken prisoner were marched to a prison camp near Pyoktong, North Korea. Kapaun was able to persuade some prisoners, who had ignored orders from officers, to carry the wounded. At the camp, he dug latrines, mediated disputes, gave away his own food, and raised morale among the prisoners. He was noted among his fellow POWs as one who would steal coffee and tea (and a pot to heat them in) from the Communist guards. He also led prisoners in acts of defiance and smuggled dysentery drugs to the doctor, Sidney Esensten.He was posthumously awarded the Legion of Merit for exceptionally meritorious conduct as a POW.
Kapaun developed a blood clot in his leg, dysentery, and pneumonia. Weakened as the months passed, he managed to lead Easter sunrise service on Sunday, March 25, 1951. He was so weak that the prison guards took him to what they called a hospital where he received no help and was left to die of malnutrition and pneumonia on May 23, 1951. He was one of twelve chaplains to die in Korea. Four chaplains were taken prisoner in 1950, all died in captivity. 
He was buried in a mass grave near the Yalu River.He was posthumously awarded the Purple Heart.
On August 18, 1951, he was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for extraordinary action on November 1-2, 1950.
TV portrayal.
He was played by James Whitmore in the "Crossroads" TV episode "The Good Thief", which aired on November 25, 1955.
Awards and decorations.
Kapaun's Distinguished Service Cross was upgraded by the US Army to the Medal of Honor. He received the Legion of Honor for his actions as a POW. He received the following military awards:
Medal of honor.
In 2001, U.S. Representative Todd Tiahrt began a campaign to award the Medal of Honor to Kapaun.</ref> Before leaving office on September 16, 2009, Secretary of the Army Pete Geren sent Tiahrt a letter, agreeing that Kapaun was worthy of the honor. Admiral Michael Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also agreed.
The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (Senate Bill 1867, Section 586) contains an authorization and a request to the President to award the Medal of Honor to Kapaun posthumously for acts of valor during the Battle of Unsan on November 1 and 2, 1950, and while a prisoner of war until his death on May 23, 1951. President Obama presented the medal awarded on behalf of Kapaun to Kapaun's nephew at the White House on April 11, 2013.</ref>
His Medal of Honor citation reads:

The following is a general narrative from the many reports of Kapaun's ordeal as a prisoner of war given by many repatriated American soldiers after their release from prison camps. He was most remembered for his great humility, bravery, his constancy, his love and kindness and solicitude for his fellow prisoners. "He was their hero... their admired and beloved "padre." He kept up the G.I.'s morale, and most of all, allowed a lot of men to become good Catholics."
Reports received noted that Kapaun's feet had become badly frozen, but that he continued to administer to the sick and wounded. He continuously went out under heavy mortar and shelling to rescue wounded and dying soldiers at personal risk of being captured or killed.
Many accounts have been given of the many creature comforts he provided his comrades of the 8th Cavalry Regiment during imprisonment. They were both spiritual and physical. He provided endless hours of prayer and what nourishment he could find to all he could to keep them from starving to death.
A detailed account of Kapaun's life is recounted in Fr. Arthur Tonne's "Chaplain Kapaun: Patriot Priest of the Korean Conflict":
In a very definite sense, we are all beneficiaries from the life of Fr. Kapaun. He has left us a stirring example of devotion to duty. He has passed on to us a spirit of tolerance and understanding. He has given us a share of dauntless bravery – of body and soul. He has transmitted to every one of us a new appreciation of America, and a keener, more realistic understanding of our country's greatest enemy – godlessness, now stalking the world in the form of communism. He has bequeathed a picture of Christ-like life. What Fr. Kapaun willed to us cannot be contained in memorials, however costly or beautiful. It is a treasure for the human soul – the spirit of one who loved and served God and man – even unto death.
When Kapaun was assigned to the Eighth Cavalry regiment – which was surrounded and overrun by the Chinese army in North Korea in October and November 1950 – he stayed behind with the wounded when the Army retreated. He allowed his own capture, then risked death by preventing Chinese executions of wounded Americans too injured to walk.
In 1993, Kapaun was named a Servant of God by the Roman Catholic Church, the first step toward possible canonization. Also, the Vatican is now examining whether a medical healing that took place in Sedgwick County, Kansas, can be considered a miracle.
Possible 2008 miracle.
On June 29, 2008, the Opening Ceremony which officially opens the Cause for Sainthood for Kapaun was made on Father Kapaun Day held at St. John Nepomucene Catholic Church in Pilsen, Kansas.
On June 26, 2009, Dr. Andrea Ambrosi, the Roman Postulator for Kapaun's cause for canonization arrived in Wichita in order to interview doctors in relation to alleged miraculous events.
Among these is the claim of 20-year-old Chase Kear who survived a severe head injury last year in part, he and his family claim, because they petitioned Fr. Emil Kapaun to intercede for them. Kear, a member of the Hutchinson Community College track team, fell on his head during pole vaulting practice in October 2008, but, it is said, was miraculously healed despite being near death. The Rev. John Hotze, the judicial vicar for the Diocese of Wichita, and trained in Canon Law, will assist in investigating Kear's case.
Fr. Hotze has spent eight years investigating the proposed sainthood of Kapaun. The Catholic Church has considered canonizing Kapaun ever since soldiers were liberated from Korean prisoner-of-war camps in 1953 and told of Kapaun's heroism and faith. The Wichita diocese has continue to receive reports of miracles involving Fr. Kapaun. He is being considered for possible designation as a martyr.
Possible 2011 miracle.
On May 7, 2011, Nick Dellasega collapsed at a Get Busy Living 5K race in Pittsburg, KS (honoring the memory of Dylan Meier). Due to a series of coincidences, Dellasega survived, even though he had seemingly died on the scene. His childhood friend, EMT Micah Ehling, is quoted by "The Wichita Eagle" as saying "I know what a face looks like when the soul leaves the body. And that's what Nick looked like". Some bystanders attribute Dellasega's survival to the devotion of his cousin, Jonah Dellasega, who fell to his knees at the scene and prayed to Kapaun. In a strange coincidence not reported by "The Eagle", Dylan Meier, in whose memory the 5K was being held, was slated to teach English in Korea at the time of his death.
Skeptics point out that Kapaun's spirit could not possibly have orchestrated the bizarre coincidences that saved Nick's life because some of them were set in motion long before Nick collapsed (including a visit by Nick's uncle, Mark, a medical doctor from Greenville, N.C.). Divine Providence, however, can be said to have set in motion all the events before they happened, including the visit by the uncle, Mark, and the prayers to Fr Kapaun. And so it's easy for believers to insist Kapaun intervened to save Dellasega's life. "The Eagle" reported, "The coincidences are strange enough and the prayer notable enough that a Catholic church investigator has reported Nick's story to the Vatican, which happens to have a representative in Wichita again, sizing up Father Emil Kapaun for sainthood."

György Piller

George Piller (born György Jekelfalussy-Piller) (June 19, 1899–September 6, 1960) was an Olympic and world champion fencer from Hungary in the 1920s and 1930s who became an internationally respected world-class fencing master in Hungary and the United States in 1950s.
Early life.
He was born György Jekelfalussy-Piller on June 19, 1899 in Eger, Hungary. Early on he decided on a military career. By 1920, he had graduated from the Ludovica Military Academy where he began training at the fencing school. He became an army officer, but continued his fencing career. He subsequently attended the fencing academy at the Toldi Miklos Royal Hungarian Sports Institute where he became a pupil of the legendary fencing master László Borsody.
Olympic and world champion fencer.
His talent led to championships and Olympic gold. In 1930 and 1931, and 1933 he won the gold medal in individual saber at the World Championship. In the fencing events at the 1932 Olympics, in Los Angeles, Piller took 1st place individually in saber and 1st place in team saber. He was awarded the saber team gold medal at the 1933 International Fencing Championship in Budapest. He was Hungarian foil champion six times.
World-class fencing master.
In 1951, Piller became a coach and fencing master. He was the coach of the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Gold Medal Hungarian Saber Team Fencing at the 1956 Summer Olympics and defected with the team to the United States after Soviet supression of Hungarian Uprising in 1956. He Americanized his name to George Piller.
By 1958 he had become the fencing master at the University of California at Berkeley. His success there, aided by World Champion saberman Daniel Magay, was immediate.
The University of California 1958 Cal Blue and Gold Yearbook stated: "Coach George Piller in his first year at Cal, trained a championship team. The future looks very promising for fencing at the University of California. After a long struggle for survival without the services of a coach, Cal fencers were fortunate in getting George Piller to serve as their coach, since Mr. Piller is considered one of the world's greatest fencing masters.”. The 1959 Yearbook continued: “Cal's Fencing Team, coached by famed Hungarian Master George Piller, enjoyed a successful 1958-59 The Bears beat Stanford, San Jose State, SF State, University of Arizona, and the Air Force Academy to emerge as champions of the Western Intercollegiate Fencing Conference. This feat earned them five first-place trophies.”
Piller also became the fencing master at the Pannonia Athletic Club, whose fencers also won many championships at the amateur level. Some of his notable students included Daniel Magay, Maestro Charles Selberg and John McDougall. 
Piller died from a terminal illness in San Francisco, California, on September 6, 1960. The high calibre of his successors was a testament to his greatness: he was followed at University of California Berkeley by Maestro Julius Palffy-Alpar and his successor at Panonia Athletic Club was Maestro Ferenc Marki.

Collin Balester

Collin Thomas Balester (born June 6, 1986) is an American professional baseball pitcher in the Pittsburgh Pirates organization. He has played in Major League Baseball for the Washington Nationals and Detroit Tigers.
Balester was drafted by the Montreal Expos in 2004, making his professional debut that year. By 2007, he was considered a top prospect for the newly relocated Nationals, with him participating in that season's All-Star Futures Game. On July 1, 2008, he made his MLB debut with the Nationals, winning in his debut as a starter, becoming the first Expo or National to do so since 1999. That season, he went on to make 14 starts for Washington, recording a 5.51 earned run average (ERA). In 2009, Balester began the season in Triple-A with the Syracuse Chiefs. He split the year between Syracuse and Washington, making a combined 27 starts. Balester was converted a relief pitcher the following season, in 2010, after struggling with Syracuse at the beginning of the year. In both 2010 and 2011, he would continue to split time between Syracuse and Washington before being designated for assignment in July 2011, before getting recalled a month later. The Nationals traded Balester to Detroit on December 9, 2011, for pitcher Ryan Perry.
Professional career.
Montreal Expos/Washington Nationals.
Balester was drafted by the Montreal Expos in the fourth round of the 2004 Major League Baseball Draft out of Huntington Beach High School. He was one of two high school players selected by the Expos in the 2004 Draft, with shortstop Ian Desmond being the other. After the draft, the Expos revealed that they hoped Balester could develop into a starting pitcher that would be in their rotation in three to five seasons. On July 10, Balester signed with the Expos and was assigned to the Rookie-level GCL Expos. In five games, he had a 1–2 win–loss record, a 2.19 ERA and a 1.014 WHIP.
Before the season, the Expos relocated to Washington and became the Washington Nationals. "Baseball America" also named Balester the 10th best prospect in the Nationals organization and listed him as having the best fastball of any minor leaguer in their system, which could be thrown at a maximum of 95 miles per hour. To begin the season, Balester joined the Class-A Savannah Sand Gnats and made his debut for the club on April 11, giving up just three hits in six innings and being awarded with the win. In a start against the Greensboro Grasshoppers on July 10, Balester allowed just one hit in eight innings of work, prompting "Greensboro News & Record" columnist Bill Hass to claim that, "The young right-hander turned the Hoppers hitters into traffic cones." On July 29, "Baseball America" mentioned Balester as a breakout player, along with infielder Kory Casto. In 24 games for Savannah, 23 of which were starts, he went 8–6 with a 3.67 ERA, and a 1.176 WHIP. After the season, Baseball America listed Balester as the second-best prospect in the Nationals system, behind third baseman Ryan Zimmerman.
Balester began the season with the High-A Potomac Nationals, where he got off to a bad start, going 1–3 with a 6.91 in nine starts. On the bad start, Balester said, "It kind of has been hard. I did so well last year. I think it's going to be good for me that I am failing a little bit more so that I know how to fail. I know I can use this in the future." He also added that, "I get way too high expectations for myself and I've got to realize I am only 19 years old." In late August, after going 4–5 with a 5.20 ERA and a 1.521 WHIP in 22 starts for Potomac, Balester was called up to Double-A Harrisburg. According to the Washington Times, Balester had already booked a flight home to Huntington Beach, expecting to not receive a call-up to Double-A. In just three starts for Harrisburg, he went 1–0 with a 1.83 ERA.
In , he was named the top prospect in the entire Nationals organization. Balester started the season with Harrisburg, where he finished the previous year. On July 7, Balester was named to the Team USA roster for the All-Star Futures Game at AT&T Park. A week after being named to the Futures Game roster, Balester was called up to the Triple-A Columbus Clippers. In 17 starts for Harrisburg, he went 2–7 with a 3.74 ERA and then in 10 starts for the Clippers, he went 2–3 with a 4.18 ERA. After the season, there were rumors that the Nationals could trade him to the Tampa Bay Rays, in exchange for outfielder Elijah Dukes.
Balester began the season with Columbus, going 9–3 with a 4.00 ERA in 15 starts for the club. He was called up from Triple-A Columbus on June 30, and made his debut the following day against the Florida Marlins. He pitched five innings, striking out three, and allowing one hit in a 9–6 Nationals win. With the win, he became the first Nationals starter to win his debut since Dan Smith did in 1999, when the team was still playing in Montreal. He started 14 more games for the Nationals, going 3–7 with a 5.51 ERA.
In Spring Training , Balester was part of a battle with Jordan Zimmermann and Shairon Martis for the final two spots in the Nationals rotation. However, he eventually lost the battle and was optioned to the Triple-A Syracuse Chiefs to begin the season. During Spring Training, he went 1–1 with a 6.75 ERA, prompting Nationals manager Manny Acta to state that, "We need Collin to go down there and get some consistency on his command and three pitches. He took the news very well. He is going to go down there and work hard. I'm sure we are going to be seeing him this year and for years to come." On July 23, after Zimmermann was placed on the 15-Day Disabled List, Balester was called up to take his place in the rotation. On August 25, the Nationals signed Liván Hernández from free agency and to make room on the roster, optioned Balester to Triple-A. In seven starts for the Nationals in 2009, he went 1–4 with a 6.82 ERA. While with Syracuse, Balester strained a muscle on his left side, which ended his season. In 20 total starts with the Chiefs, he went 7–10 with a 4.44 ERA.
On March 15, 2010, Balester was sent to minor league training camp, ensuring that he would start the season in Syracuse. To start the season, Balester recorded a 11.65 ERA in five starts for the Chiefs, prompting the Nationals to send him to extended spring training in order for him to convert to being a relief pitcher. On July 24, Balester was called up by the Nationals to replace Luis Atilano, who had been placed on the disabled list. That day, he came into the game to replace J. D. Martin and hit Milwaukee Brewers second baseman Rickie Weeks in the head with a fastball. However, Weeks played the following day. Nine days later, Balester again hit a batter in the head, this time it was Arizona Diamondbacks third baseman Mark Reynolds. Much like Weeks, Reynolds was fine, but Balester still commented that, "You don't want to do that kind of stuff. It's the second time I did that, but it's one of those things you never want to have happen in your career. It's obviously unintentional. It's not a good situation to be in." On August 8, Balester was optioned back to Syracuse, only to be recalled on August 24, when Stephen Strasburg was placed on the disabled list. However, a day later, he was sent back down to Triple-A. Balester was recalled again for a third time on September 5. In 35 total games for Syracuse, he went 3–3 with a 5.87 ERA, while in 17 games for Washington, he went 0–1 with a 2.57 ERA.
In , Balester was optioned again to Triple-A Syracuse to begin the season. On April 17, after throwing five scoreless innings for the Chiefs to begin the season, he was called up to replace Todd Coffey, who had been placed on the disabled list. He was optioned back to Syracuse on April 24, after making two appearances, allowing three runs. After Tom Gorzelanny was placed on the disabled list on May 28, Balester was recalled by the Nationals. At the time of his call–up, he had made 13 appearances with a 3.71 ERA and struck out 18 batters for Syracuse. He spent just one day with Washington as he was optioned back to Triple-A the next day without making an appearance, however, he was recalled again on June 15. He was designated for assignment on July 5. In eight games with the Nationals, he had a 4.61 ERA and a 1.683 WHIP. He was re-added to the 40-man roster on July 7, after the Nationals secured optional waivers for him, meaning they could take him off waivers, should a team try to claim him. On August 2, he was recalled by the Nationals, replacing Atahualpa Severino on the 25-man roster.
Detroit Tigers.
On December 9, 2011, Washington traded Balester to the Detroit Tigers for Ryan Perry.
In 2012, Balester was on the opening roster for the Tigers for the first time in his career. However, he was designated for assignment by Detroit on May 23. 
He was granted free agency on November 2. 
Texas Rangers.
Balester signed with the Texas Rangers on November 28. He was assigned to the Triple-A Round Rock Express to begin the 2013 season. He pitched in the rotation in April but after a start on April 30, he was placed on the disabled list the next day with an elbow issue. On June 6, Balester underwent Tommy John surgery, ending his season and delaying his start to 2014.
Pittsburgh Pirates.
Balester signed a minor league deal with the Pittsburgh Pirates on November 20, 2013.
Personal.
Balester and his wife, Ashley, have been married since 2009.

Tvrdalj Castle

Tvrdalj Castle () is a castle in Stari Grad, on the island of Hvar, Croatia.
Tvrdalj is the fortified summer residence of Petar Hektorović, the Croatian poet (1487-1572). During the 16th century, the island of Hvar came under attack from the Ottoman Turks. Hektorović, one of the local nobles, undertook to fortify his house so that it could act as shelter for the local citizens.
Tvrdalj is a well-preserved Renaissance building, with a long closed facade on the seaward side, to protect it from attack. The interior courtyard contains a sea-water fishpool, enclosed by a vaulted and arcaded terrace. Next to it is a tower with a dovecote. The living quarters, together with the servant quarters, and several wells, are arranged around the pool. Behind the main buildings is a walled garden where Hektorović cultivated herbs and medicinal plants. 
A series of inscriptions are set into walls of the mansion in Latin and Croatian. Those in Croatian are considered to be some of the oldest extant.
PETRVS HECTOREVS MARINI FILIVS 
PROPRIO SVMPTV ET INDVSTRIA 
AD SVVM ET AMICOR, VSVM CONSTRVXIT 
Translation: Petar Hektorović, son of Marin, built this at his own expense and by his own efforts, for his own and his friends' use.
History.
In 1448, Hektor Hektorović was granted permission by the Hvar Governor ("Hvarski Knez") to build on the land at Tvrdalj, at the far western edge of the town of Stari Grad, right on the shore of the bay. The location was already known as Tvrdalj which translates as a fortress or castle, implying an earlier fortification on the site. The area had been the site of occupation from ancient times, as demonstrated later by remains found during the 1898 excavations for the steps of the nearby church of Sv Rocco.
The late 15th century and into the 16th century was a time of expansion and building in Stari Grad. In 1482, the Dominican monastery was built, and many of the noble families on the island saw Old Hvar, as it was then called, as a peaceful haven. Many eminent figures had summer palaces built, so much so that in 1553 the Venetian correspondent Giustinian described Stari Grad as having "handsome buildings and a port fit for the largest of ships. Many fine people live there."
Following the death of his father, Marin Hektorović, Petar Hektorović took over the building and made Tvrdalj into his summer palace using his own architectural design. Although this was not his only house on the island, or even in Stari Grad, he mentioned it extensively in his will, explaining in architectural detail how to continue with the unfinished building works.
Petar Hektorović sited his residence directly on the waterfront, which in the 16th century was located further inland than today. The square that lies in front of Tvrdalj today did not exist until the 19th century. In Hektorović's time, there was a shallow stretch of seawater right up to the entrance, allowing access by boat. His fortified palace was built on the shore near to where the baths of a Roman country villa had once stood.
During the 1520s and 1530s, building work focused mainly on housing for travellers and the poor. However, an attack on Stari Grad by the Turks in 1539 left much of the town burned and ransacked and Hektorovic fled to Italy, returning in 1541 to resume work.
Hektorović's design for Tvrdalj was a simple layout of single story dwellings around a central courtyard. His house, kitchen and cellar opened onto the courtyard, which had a large rectangular fishpond. Above the pond was a tower, with dovecot. At the back of the property was a large walled garden. The main entry was through a baroque portal from the sea, where the inscription "OMNIUM CONDITORI" (To the Creator of the World) would greet arriving visitors. A stone recess in the atrium has a hole that was used for emptying chamber pots. Carved into the stone above this simple lavatory is "SI TE NOSTI CUR SUPERBIS" (Know what thou art,then why art thy proud?).
On the eastern side, with its own entrance, was housing for travellers and paupers. Under the terrace of the loggia, in a small cell lived a Beguine nun. A high wall surrounded the housing complex, with defensive features such as a ravelin, and an altana (rooftop loggia) with merlons.
The fishpond was created as a habitat for grey mullet, with a system to ensure a fresh supply of sea water. Above this is a small tower with the dovecot for birds, and a garden with flowers and trees for land animals. Hektorović himself said that his metaphysical construction began with the fishes in the pond, symbolizing Christ, and ended with the doves, which symbolized the holy spirit.
Tvrdalj was a simple summer residence, with none of the ornamentation or classical statues that mark other fashionable nobles houses of the time. Its defensive architecture gives it a distinctive appearance.
In 1571 Stari Grad was again attacked and Tvrdalj was set on fire by the Turks. A year later, Petar Hektorovic died and the damaged Tvrdalj was divided between his relatives. Following provisions in his will, there were gradual improvements made. However, in 1834 the Venetian laws lapsed and Tvrdalj experienced massive construction works: the south wall of the complex was removed, vaults constructed around the pool, a second floor added on either side of the tower, and new two-storey houses were built. The bay in front of Tvrdalj was filled in as part of the harbour improvements. In the 20th century, further major changes were experienced in 1901 when the eastern wall was demolished and houses built over the vault and cistern which is still part of the Tvrdalj entrance.
Carved Inscriptions.
Tvrdalj has numerous carved inscriptions in Latin, Croatian and Italian. These date from the original building by Peter Hektorović.

Nehaj Fortress

The Nehaj Fortress ( ) is a fortress on the hill Nehaj in the town of Senj, Croatia.
The name "Nehaj" comes from the Croatian term "Ne hajati" , which means "Don't care". In the Croatian language this fortress has also other names, which are: "Kula Nehaj" , what means "Nehaj Tower", and "Nehajgrad" , what means "Nehajtown".
This name was given to the hill and the Fortress by the Uskoks, who built on the top of this hill the Fortress for defensive purposes. They gave the hill and the Fortress such a name because they wanted to emphasize to the citizens of the town of Senj, and all of those that lived in the vicinity of the town of Senj that they should not care that someone will conquer this hill or the Fortress until they are there.
It was built by Croatian army general Ivan Lenković, a captain of the "Uskoks", on the hill Nehaj. Finished in 1558, it was built on the remains of ruined churches, monasteries and houses which were situated outside of the walls of Senj. These buildings were scrapped since it was concluded that they would not survive anyway if they were outside the city walls, as the Ottomans would loot them or use them as housing during sieges. The fortress was mainly built to fight the Ottoman Empire, and to be used as a base for the Uskoks. The Uskoks (who built and inhabited the fort) were great enemies of the Ottomans, as they had previously taken another city called Klis, where the Uskoks used to reside. Before the fortress was built, Senj had been besieged three times, but none succeeded; after the fort was built, the fortress or Senj were not attacked again. However, the Uskoks were also known to be the enemies of the Venetians, as the Venetians were quite aggressive toward the Croatian coastal cities.The Venetians viewed them as pirates, since they would plunder and sink their ships. They were known to travel as far as Istria and plunder Venetian ships. In fact, the Venetians were so disturbed by the Uskok attacks that they had a war with Austria (which Senj was a part of at that time). One of the peace terms was the banishment of the Uskoks. The Emperor did banish the Uskoks and that was their end. However, during the hundred years that they were active they stood by their oath of vengeance towards all their enemies which they took when their former fortress of Klis was conquered by the Ottomans in 1537. The Uskoks and the Fortress successfully held the boarder and kept invaders away, as the fortress was never conquered or torn down. 
The fortress is 18 metres tall and 23 metres wide, and square shaped with walls averaging from 2 to 3 metres in thickness. There are five towers situated on top of the Fortress, and eleven large cannon openings along the walls. Inside the Fortress, there are displays of cannons and other household items, as well as a collection of costumes and weapons of the Uskoks of Senj. There is also an annual medieval festival that is held in Senj, and an important part of it is when the "Uskoks" march up to the fortress on horseback. There are also crafting workshops and other medieval themed attractions around the fortress at this time; as well as a detailed overview of its history. 
Today, the fortress serves primarily as a museum. With exhibits of weapons, clothing, drawings and models of various things from the time when the fortress was actively used. Virtually all regions of the fort are accessible. Including the toilet which dangles over the edge, but that is not available for "use" today.

Nehaj

Nehaj is the name of the hill that is found above the center of the town of Senj in Croatia. More famous is the Nehaj Fortress that stands on top of the hill.
The name "Nehaj" comes from the Croatian term "Ne hajati" which means "Don't care".
This name was given to the hill and the Fortress by the Uskoks, who built on the top of this hill the Fortress Nehaj for defensive purposes. They gave the hill and the Fortress such a name because they wanted to emphasize to the citizens of the town of Senj, and all of those that lived in the vicinity of the town of Senj that they should not care that someone will conquer this hill or the Fortress until they are there.
This became true, because until the Uskoks where on the hill, not even one aggressor succeeded to conquer the hill or the Fortress, what at the same time meant security for the town of Senj, that is found in the footer of the hill. To the builders of this Fortress the only and main goal was the defence of the town and the obstruction of the Venetians and the Turks in their invasions and conquests.
But, short after the Fortress was built on the top of the hill, truce was made between the Habsburg Monarchy and the Republic of Venice, and one of the conditions of the truce was the transmigration of the Uskoks from the Fortress Nehaj and from Senj because of the constant fear that they gave the Venetians and the Turks. That act meant a sure disappearance of the Uskoks from the stage of history, and exposure of these parts to constant conquests and plundering raids of the Turks and the Venetians.

Zrin Castle

Zrin Castle ("Gradina Zrin") is a ruined castle located in the village of Zrin, south of the town of Sisak in Dvor municipality, central Croatia. 
History.
The castle was first mentioned in the 13th century as a fortress ruled by the Babonić clan. Later (1328-1347) it was possessed by the members of Iločki family. In 1347 King Louis I the Great bestowed the fortress to the noble Šubić family who then changed their family name after it, becoming the Zrinski. It remained in their possession until the Ottoman invasion and conquest of the region, and the fortress fell to them on 20 October 1577. It wasn't until 1718 that the castle was retaken from the Ottomans.

Charlie Harper (Two and a Half Men)

Charles Francis "Charlie" Harper is a fictional character in the CBS sitcom "Two and a Half Men" from seasons 1 to 8. Played by actor Charlie Sheen, the character has garnered him four Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series and two Golden Globe nominations for Best Performance by an Actor in a Comedy Series. Although the character was killed off after the end of the eighth season, the character was reprised for one episode of the ninth season by Kathy Bates, which resulted in her winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series.
After being expelled from Juilliard School, Charlie moved to Los Angeles with the intention of becoming a film composer. However, he met a commercial producer who listened to Charlie's work and thus, Charlie began his career writing jingles for a living. His most famous composition is the "Maple Loops" song. Charlie then became a successful composer and singer of children's music, with the alias "Charlie Waffles", when the jingle business dried up. The character of Charlie Harper is loosely based on its actor Charlie Sheen.
Charlie prides himself on his bachelor/playboy lifestyle in Malibu, L.A and drives a Mercedes, and used to own a Jaguar. He was also thinking of buying a Ferrari F430, or a Bentley. His lifestyle consists of living in a two-story beachfront home, drinking excessively, smoking cigars, constant womanizing, gambling, and usually wearing bowling shirts and shorts. Charlie sleeps in constantly, and retains a full-time housekeeper, Berta. Money "falls into his lap" as he lives a life of free-spirited debauchery. He has a vast range of phobias including stage fright (unless he is drunk), commitment, his mother, spiders, large birds, germs, change and hard work. On Season 9, Charlie dies as a result of being struck by a train while on vacation in Paris. Also on Season 9, Alan hallucinates about Charlie's spirit (played by Kathy Bates), which lives on in Hell as a ghost trapped in a woman's body.
History.
When Charlie's mother Evelyn was pregnant with him (for 7 and a half months), his parents thought that he was going to be a girl, since the ultrasound showed no signs of a penis. According to Evelyn, Charlie was always "a little drama queen" when he grew up. After his father died of food poisoning, Charlie and his brother Alan had three stepdads. The first, Harry Luther Gorsky, left Charlie's and Alan's mother for a young woman (Charlie refers to Harry as "a little tyrant"), and Evelyn was also present at his funeral, the second was a twitchy gay man from Texas who called him and Alan "buckaroos", and the third was "the Carpet King", a fat guy whom Charlie liked the most because he had "a grateful daughter". Well into his 40s, Charlie believed "the Carpet King" owned a carpeting business until his mother explained that the man's name was actually sexual slang rather than his profession.
When Charlie was young, he was ashamed of his younger brother Alan, and when Alan had his first school day, Charlie told everyone at school that Alan was his shaved monkey (he later explained he did this because he always wanted a shaved monkey). He also gave his brother full-time wedgies and annoyed him whenever he could. Charlie drank a lot when he was a teenager, was a chain smoker, and constantly ran away, nevertheless his mother did not mind because he always came back, and generally didn't care about her sons. He once even, when he was 16, drove to Tijuana, Mexico with a school nurse. When he was 17, he almost married a woman whom he thought to be his love, but relented, and as Charlie says, if he didn't, he would today be married to a "65-year old retired belly dancer". Charlie constantly bemoans Alan's and Jake's presence in his house but generally seems happy that they are around, because they are the only people who have known him for a long time and remain in his daily life. When Alan was surprised to find Charlie did not have their mom's cell phone number in his contacts list, Charlie told him "If I can't eat it, bang it or bet on it, it's not in my phone." On a later episode, it is shown Charlie does get his mother's number. In fact, he has it on the speed dial address that he finds appropriate for her, "666".
Charlie and Alan have a strained relationship with their mother and often try to avoid her at all costs, and Charlie refers to her as "a Satan". Not much is known about their biological father, Francis Harper, except that when Charlie looks back he says he was a horrible son to him. Interesting enough, Evelyn, even after multiple marriages, still keeps her first husband's name (Harper) rather than her maiden name (which is never mentioned). Charlie also once had a vision to take care of his mother, which shocked him, but when he saw an old gangster film, he realized that he "misunderstood" him, and to actually kill her when he is able to.
Charlie is often selfish towards Alan. In one episode he made Alan go on a date in spite of being sick with the flu, merely in order to afford him (Charlie) the opportunity to have "revenge sex". In another episode when Alan got upset in a bookstore and wanted to miss a movie that they were going to see Charlie replied, "So I'm supposed to miss the movie just because you had a nervous breakdown. Don't you think that is a little selfish, Alan?" Furthermore after Alan's second divorce Alan tells Charlie that he needs him in front of a crowd of people to which Charlie retorts, "Anyone know a Charlie?" He additionally derives enjoyment from rubbing his own success in Alan's face and further complicating Alan's situations just for the fun of it. He is particularly nasty about Alan's situation with Judith, especially since he told Alan not to marry and tried to bribe him with a $1000 worth prostitute.
While Charlie loves his nephew Jake and, at the beginning of the show, used him to get dates, he often makes jokes revolving around Jake's apparent lack of smarts, and often states that he is destined to be a doorstop or a fry cook, and states that he is not a kid, but a "gassy dwarf". Nevertheless it is often shown that ultimately Charlie loves Jake, and sometimes acts like a father to him, giving him some wise advice about him and Alan.
Despite his selfish attitude, Charlie can be caring at times. Though Charlie often chastises Alan for being a "sponge", Charlie has continued to provide two out of his three bedrooms to Alan, without rent, and seemingly provides all of his meals, even when the two dine out together. In many occasions, he has stood up to Jake for Alan when Jake started badmouthing his father. He also cares a lot for Jake, even though he has trouble admitting it. In the episode "Ate the Hamburgers, Wearing the Hats" Jake gets an injury and Charlie goes out of his way to make sure that he's all right. In the episode "The Mooch at the Boo" Jake and his neighbor, a pretty girl named Celeste, disappear together and Celeste's ex-football player dad came looking. When they were found kissing Charlie later said to the father (Jerome, played by Michael Clarke Duncan) that he would take the beating intended for Jake instead. While Charlie knows that Jake's new sister Milly could be his niece, he tells Alan not to get involved in his possible daughter's life furthermore or to reveal the possibility of being his daughter, because it will most likely cause further hate and disdain between Alan and Judith, as well as Herb (who is unaware that Alan and Judith had an affair while he was strained from her), and ruin Milly's life.
Charlie watches a lot of sports on TV, mostly football, basketball, and baseball. He has little interest in athletics "per se". Rather, Charlie is a frequent gambler. He watches sports to keep tabs on his investments, and bets on horse races, football matches, etc. Two of his favorite sitcoms are "Dharma and Greg" and "Becker", but he revealed in "Fart Jokes", "Pie", and "Celeste" that he does not like "Sex and the City" and in "Celeste" he told Alan that he was gay for watching it.
Despite his affluent and worldly-wise persona, Charlie can be remarkably naïve about everyday matters. In "Last Chance to See Those Tattoos," Alan observes that Charlie does not really understand how web pages and the Internet work. In "I Can't Afford Hyenas," Charlie is shown to have no understanding of how to care for his own living expenses because he entrusts an accountant with managing his cash flow and paying the bills, but the accountant is actually swindling him. When his accountant is busted by the authorities, Charlie is not even aware of a problem until he receives notices from the bank that his accounts are delinquent, his credit cards are maxed out and his car is in danger of being repossessed. He is twice shown to have no (or to have subconsciously blocked all) awareness of Oedipus: first when Rose has to explain him to look under "Oed..." when he fetches a dictionary to understand her diagnosis of his Oedipus complex; and again a year later when Rose presents Charlie a copy of Sophocles' "Oedipus Rex" during his relationship with Evelyn's doppelgänger Lydia, and he displays utter ignorance of the plot. How to operate his own washing machine to clean his clothes is a mystery to him, and he genuinely believes the machine will telephone him when the cycle is complete (as mocked by Alan).
Death.
Charlie Harper died in Paris after being struck by a train. The season 9 premiere featured his funeral with one of Charlie's trademark bowling shirts and a pair of cargo shorts hanging by his closed casket. Rose explained that he had proposed to her in Paris and the next few days had been happy but when she returned from shopping one day, she found him showering with another woman. The next day he fell off a Paris Métro platform and was struck by a train, his body exploding "like a balloon full of meat." (It is implied by Rose and suggested by Berta that Rose was responsible for Charlie's death with the statement "Never cross a crazy woman.")
Aftermath.
Following his death, Charlie has been frequently mentioned by his surviving (though very few) loved ones. However, it tends to be in a disrespectful manner. He has been mentioned in every episode up to "One False Move, Zimbabwe", but was not then mentioned again until "Why We Gave Up Women". He was rarely mentioned in season 10.
After his funeral his ashes are delivered and Alan decides to spread them on the beach but spills them after being scared at seeing Walden Schmidt at the window, soaking wet.In "Those Fancy Japanese Toilets", Charlie is shown to have kept a private journal. He kept it in a safe deposit box at the bank, and after he died, the bank contacted his mother about it. She gives the journal to Alan, who becomes fascinated with it, as the entries give an insight to a whole new side of Charlie that he never saw before. It is revealed that Charlie had postulated about the various causes of his death, including liver failure and being pushed in front of a bus, and that he questioned his condescending behavior towards women. It's revealed that when Charlie first met his nephew Jake, he believed that he was to have a bright future ahead of him, but secretly thought he was not Alan's biological son (implied by him to Alan years prior). It is also hinted that, despite all the criticism and abuse, he actually idolized his brother and missed him when he moved in with Lyndsey, however he knew at the same time that he would be back "before long".
In "Thank You for the Intercourse", Walden redecorates the house and therefore donates Charlie's piano to an orphanage. Alan then realizes that he still grieves over Charlie's death and starts to act like Charlie because of it, even picking up women with much success. Jake and Walden are worried about Alan's strange behavior and Walden then brings Alan/Charlie to a mental institution after tricking him into believing that they were going for a trip to Las Vegas and that he stayed at the Bellagio penthouse suite.
Charlie is re-introduced into the series in the episode "Why We Gave Up Women", portrayed by Kathy Bates. While Alan is hospitalized for a mild heart attack, he awakens to find a strange woman sitting at the foot of his bed, dressed like Charlie and smoking a cigar. She also introduces herself as Charlie. Still not convinced, Alan asks her questions that only the real Charlie could answer, and she does so correctly. Charlie proceeds to explain that he ended up in Hell, and, as part of his punishment, must live eternity in the body of a large, older woman, albeit with a pair of testicles (however, he does not consider his new form all bad, as he is able to grope his own breasts). Charlie advises Alan to turn his life around and become self-dependent for once. After the meeting, Alan decides to rent an apartment, which is very low-grade. The following night, Charlie reappears to Alan, and admits that he did not care if Alan changed, but was happy that even though he is dead, he was finally able to get him out of his house. Later, after Alan fakes a second heart attack, in the hospital, Charlie appears to Jake, trying to hint who he is after addressing him by his old pet name "Tater Head", but Jake fails to understand. Annoyed, Charlie goes back to Hell, escorted by two sexy women, where he wistfully complains about not having a penis any more.
According to Chuck Lorre, the show's producers were so impressed with Bates performance, that they were considering bringing her back in the recurring role of "Alan's demonic spirit guide". However, Bates did not return to the show in season 10.
Charlie is mentioned briefly in the season 10 episode "A Big Bag Of Dog", when Walden has an emotional breakdown upstairs in the master bedroom over a breakup, Berta says that Charlie used to have emotional meltdowns over breakups in that bedroom, too. He is mentioned in the season 10 episode "That's Not What They Call It In Amsterdam" when Rose returns, Alan asks Walden if she told him that she was stalking his brother, and again when Rose is unsure whether to date Walden as he lives in Charlie's house, but Walden insists that has nothing to do with Alan or himself. He is referenced to by Walden in "Something My Gynecologist Said" when he is talking about this fake book he is writing, about a man called Alan who lives with his brother in a beach house, but the brother dies by being pushed in front of a train, and a billionaire comes and buys the house. Berta mentions him in "I Scream when I Pee", when saying that she didn't think she could work for anyone besides Charlie, but says that Walden is the greatest boss she ever had, after he comes to cheer her up on her birthday and buys her a car. Alan briefly mentions him in "Advantage Fat flying baby". He is mentioned again in the season 10 finale, "Cows, Prepare To Be Tipped", when Alan reveals that Charlie left Jake two of his last cigars for when Jake graduates college. Alan and Jake smoke them and laugh heartily. In "Big Episode. Someone Stole A Spoon", after a wild party at the beach house leaves an intense mess with wreckage, Walden come out into the living room and says, "It looks like Charlie Sheen's house!", referencing not the character, but the actor himself.
Daughter.
In season 11, A woman knocks on Walden and Alan's door, and introduces herself as Jenny, Charlie's daughter, which surprises Alan to the point of shock, as he never knew that he had a daughter, but amuses Walden. According to Jenny, the last time she saw him alive was at her fourth birthday. Hurtful because Charlie didn't want to marry her, Jenny's mother banned him from ever seeing Jenny again. Wanting to somehow provide for Jenny, Charlie would send a lucrative check to the family every month up until his passing. Alan reveals to Jenny that he kept his brother's ashes and put them in the liquor cabinet. He spills his ashes twice in the same day but is happy when he finds 2 quarters in them. It is also the first time Walden mentions Charlie by name, after previously only referring to him as your brother or Alan's brother, he wishes there was something else other than Alan that Charlie would have left behind. Berta begins to tell Jenny stories of Charlie's life but Walden stops her and asks if she has any stories for Jenny that don't include drugs, alcohol or hookers, Berta is unable to recall any more stories than ones that include those things. Later at Pavlov's, Jenny, Walden, Alan and Evelyn toast to Charlie as a father, brother, son and guy who got hit by a train so he could buy his beach house.
In the second episode Evelyn says to her boyfriend that she wasn't the greatest mother to Charlie and Alan, and that she wants to make up for it with Jenny. She asks Jenny if she wants to see pictures of her father at the police station as they will have more pictures of him than she ever took.
Love life.
Charlie's love life is a recurring theme in his character. He is an alcoholic womanizer who has engaged in decades of frequent one-night stands, prostitutes, casual sex, and "relationships" of short duration, in stark contrast to his brother Alan's inability to garner much female attention. Even though Charlie usually never calls any of his partners again after he had sex with them, there are a few relationships on the show that lasted longer than one night, notably his neighbor Rose, who continues to stalk him after they spent one night together, and Jake's ballet teacher Mia, whom Charlie was actually in love with, and almost married in Las Vegas. He usually dated much younger women, but starting in season 5, he pursued relationships that were a change of pace for him. He started a relationship with a respected judge played by Ming-Na and later with a substantially older single mother/author (Susan Blakely), but he later blew it with both women. In season 6, Charlie proposes to his girlfriend Chelsea (Jennifer Bini Taylor, who has also played three other roles in earlier seasons) just to get her to return his love for her. At the end of season 8 he goes off with Rose to a romantic getaway in Paris, which ultimately resulted in his death.
Notable love interests (in order of appearance).
Rose.
Charlie and Rose (Melanie Lynskey) spent one night together shortly before the events portrayed in the show; after this, Rose became increasingly obsessed with him. She usually spends time at his beach house when Charlie and Alan are gone, and when they come back they usually find a surprise, such as cabinets that are glued shut. Rose demonstrates her obsession with Charlie in numerous ways: when taking up with Charlie's pizza boy Gordon, she flaunted him to Charlie in an obvious but useless attempt to make the latter jealous; she then attempted to mold Gordon into Charlie by dressing him in short pants and designer bowling shirts like those Charlie usually wears, and instructing him to try to emulate Charlie's poses; she has named all of her five ferrets Charlie. Rose's father (portrayed by Sheen's real-life father Martin) became similarly obsessed with Charlie's mother Evelyn; Charlie and Evelyn sought "expert" assistance (i.e., Rose) to get rid of him. Charlie is usually charmed by Rose, but is not interested in a relationship with her, even though Berta thinks they are a good couple together. When Rose decided to leave to go to London Charlie believed that she was only pretending in order to get him into a relationship with her; after she really left, Charlie realized that he made a horrible mistake by letting Rose go. He then went to London to meet her but quickly returned home when Rose started talking about his moving there and starting a family together. Rose has since returned to Malibu and continues to stalk Charlie. As of "The Devil's Lube," there is a chance of a future relationship between the two; in this episode Charlie points out that he has not seen Rose in a while, but she cannot say the same. However, in "Above Exalted Cyclops," Rose, after being set up by Chelsea, now has moved on from Charlie and is stalking Alan, or possibly stalking both brothers. In "Gumby with a Pokey" (her only appearance in Season 7), she is still noted as Charlie's stalker, implying that she is either done stalking Alan and back to Charlie, or stalking both brothers. Gordon is unaware of Rose's brief relationship with Alan. In Season 8's "Crazy Bitch Gazette," Rose is again stalking Charlie. This time it has become too much for Charlie's new girlfriend Michelle, who is convinced that Charlie loves Rose. Rose tells Charlie that she is marrying a guy named "Manfred Quinn," which appears to be verified when Charlie and Alan go to the church and peer through a door window to see a wedding in progress. The two walk away, with Charlie confused and apparently heartbroken. At the end of the episode, it is revealed that, with the exception of the priest and Rose, all the other attendants are mannequins (hence the name of Rose's purported groom: Manfred "Manny" Quinn). Later in Season 8, Charlie tells Rose that he loves her and they begin a romantic relationship with Charlie even taking her on a romantic getaway to Paris despite the fact that he still thinks she is truly married. It is implied that Rose has something to do with Charlie's death in Paris after it is revealed she caught him having an affair. Charlie had proposed to her in Paris also which was mentioned by Rose at Charlie's funeral and Rose said yes to the proposal. In "That's Not What They Call It In Amsterdam", Rose begins a relationship with Walden, and after "Ferrets, Attack!" begins stalking him and ruining his life.
Jill/Bill.
Bill (Chris O'Donnell) was a previous girlfriend of Charlie's appearing in a season one episode, "An Old Flame with a New Wick". Bill had since had sexual-reassignment surgery and was formerly living as "Jill". Charlie comments during the episode that while the relationship was passionate, sex with Bill was "a little weird". As the episode progresses, Bill begins dating Charlie's mother Evelyn (she is initially unaware of Bill's history). Once Bill's identity is revealed to her, she faints, but decides to continue seeing Bill. However, Bill was never seen or mentioned again.
Lisa.
Lisa (Denise Richards) was Charlie's favorite ex-girlfriend. She appeared in one season 1 and one season 2 episode. In "Merry Thanksgiving," Charlie proposed to her but she decided to marry another man. In "Yes, Monsignor," Charlie had to prove that he is good with babies when he found out she had one (played by Richards' and Sheen's real-life first daughter Sam). Notably, she was absent at Charlie's funeral.
Delores Pasternak.
Miss Delores Pasternak (Missi Pyle, also Alicia Witt in season 6) was Jake's fifth-grade teacher. Charlie charmed her to save Jake from suspension for flipping her off, but she proved to be a domineering/school-marm type, driving Charlie to break up with her, after which she had a meltdown that got her fired from teaching and disowned by her family, leaving her to become a bikini dancer. After running into each other four years later (see "A Jock Strap in Hell"), Charlie feels guilty about this and hires her as Jake's private tutor, leading them to resume their romantic relationship. However, she quickly reverts to her religious self and Charlie breaks up with her again. She was seen at Charlie's funeral, where she mentioned he made tea using her panties.
Isabella.
Isabella (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) was Charlie's Goth girlfriend known to bring a dark atmosphere with her. She and several of her girlfriends "anoint" Charlie as their king in a ceremony, "bonding" them for life. It's revealed that she knows Evelyn from Pilates class, and Isabella was unaware that Charlie and Alan are Evelyn's sons. Isabella was at Charlie's funeral, where she mentions that Charlie gave her herpes.
Kandi.
Charlie had a brief relationship with Kandi (April Bowlby), after which she married his brother, Alan. Kandi is depicted as hot and young (half the age of Alan or Charlie), with a "dumb blonde" stereotype, even though she is a redhead.
Mia.
Mia (Emmanuelle Vaugier) is a ballet teacher, whom Charlie had a crush on, and was engaged to for a short while. Charlie decided not to marry Mia after she insisted that Alan and Jake must move out of the house, only to find out that Alan had married Kandi and moved out. Charlie later became sexually reckless and depressed, because he learned that Mia was going to marry someone else. Charlie blamed Alan for ruining everything, but later realizes that he was just looking for an excuse to get out of the marriage. They reunited in person at the end of season 6's "Baseball Was Better With Steroids," resulting in a cliffhanger for the season finale. In season 7's premiere "818-jklpuzo", Mia appears in much less favorable light. Mia asks Charlie for help with a singing career, but in reality she appears to want him back. By this time, Charlie had begun a relationship with Chelsea, and is now torn between the two. While in the studio recording a demo tape, Mia asks Charlie for sex after revealing that she is a horrible singer. Charlie tells Mia she cannot sing, and chooses Chelsea. As Charlie rushes away he turns off Mia's microphone, so that he cannot hear her yell and swear at him. Mia was at Charlie's funeral, demanding to see the body.
Lydia.
Shortly after he cancelled his wedding with Mia, Charlie began dating a rude real-estate agent named Lydia (Katherine LaNasa). Alan, Jake, Rose and Berta did not like her and made this clear to Charlie, but when she met his mother, Evelyn, the four realised that she and Evelyn were exactly alike in character. Bobby, the waiter at Charlie's and Evelyn's favorite restaurant, was the first to recognise Lydia's similarity to Evelyn. When Lydia began bossing Berta around, Berta threatened to quit unless Charlie broke up with her. Lydia meanwhile threatened to break up with Charlie unless he fired Berta. In the end, Charlie broke up with Lydia, and Berta would only return if Charlie admitted his sexual addiction and attended rehab. At Charlie's funeral, Lydia mentions that Charlie loved being spanked.
Myra.
Myra (Judy Greer) is the sister of Herb Melnick (Judith's husband after Alan). She bonded with Charlie over their hatred of Judith. Judith did not want the two dating, and would take her frustration out on Alan. Judith did not want Charlie coming over to her house either, so Charlie invited Myra to his house. Even though she was supposed to be sleeping in Jake's room, Myra slept with Charlie, leaving Alan and Jake to hear them and find out the truth. When Charlie wanted to pursue the relationship, he was heartbroken to learn that she was engaged and he'd have to drive her to the airport after the wedding, and that he'd never see her again. Greer again appears in Season 9 as Walden's ex-wife.
Linda Harris.
At the beginning of the fifth season, Charlie dated Judge Linda Harris (Ming-Na), a professor of his own age. Their relationship ended in the middle of the same season, after Linda concluded that she couldn't "be connected publicly to a guy like " after he publicly humiliated her (under the influence of his mother's "medication") at an event held in her honor. The random songs which Charlie sang to her son Brandon while babysitting, essentially launched his show-biz persona, "Charlie Waffles."
Courtney Leopold/Sylvia Fishman.
Charlie also fell for his future stepsister, "Courtney" (Jenny McCarthy) in Season 5, and after agreeing to stop seeing her due to their relationship to each other, he lends her a substantial amount of money and proposes moments before they become step-siblings. She also forced Charlie to buy a car from her so the secret of their relationship would not get out to her father and Evelyn. Charlie is heart-broken to learn that she is actually a con artist named Sylvia, but he apparently retains feelings for her, telling her that he will "wait" for her (to get out of prison). She reappears in Season 8's "Ow, Ow, Don't Stop" (as Courtney) after being released from prison, and Charlie immediately falls for her again, even professing his love for her. Courtney and Charlie break up two episodes later in "Chocolate Diddlers or My Puppy's Dead" when they realize they have simply lost their feelings for one another and, in an extremely rare case for Charlie, they part mutually and on good terms. Although surprisingly she holds a lot of resentment towards him at his funeral in the season 9 opener. In the season 9 episode "Nine Magic Fingers", Courtney starts dating Walden Schmidt (Ashton Kutcher), but their relationship is short-lived as Alan and Bridget, Walden's wife, successfully convince Walden that Courtney is simply a con artist.
Angie.
Near the end of season 5, Charlie met an older woman (Susan Blakely) named Angie who was also the author of a relationship self-help book that he was interested in reading. Angie has been described as a mother figure to Charlie, more so than even his own mother, Evelyn. When Angie introduced him to her grown son Jeremy and his fiancee Tricia (Virginia Williams), Charlie realized that he had dated Tricia earlier in his life. After Tricia revealed that she still had feelings for Charlie, Tricia dumped Jeremy, and Angie became, as Alan describes, a "mean drunk" who verbally lashed out at Charlie and furiously broke up with him.
Melissa.
In a season 6 episode ("The Flavin' and the Mavin'"), Charlie is annoyed that he has to drive Alan to work, until he meets Alan's spunky young receptionist, Melissa (Kelly Stables). Alan begs Charlie not to hit on her, as it will likely end badly and complicate their working relationship, but Charlie ignores him. Charlie sleeps with Melissa, then becomes annoyed when she constantly hangs around his house. Melissa becomes vindictive when she realizes that Charlie is not serious about their relationship. As Alan suspected, the failed relationship causes Melissa to demand a raise and health insurance. (Melissa would later date Alan in several episodes of seasons 6, 7 and 8, becoming the third of Charlie's ex-girlfriends to later date Alan.)
Chelsea.
Chelsea Christine Melini (Jennifer Bini Taylor) starts dating Charlie in season 6, and is the first woman to whom he confessed his love without prompting. He says this nearly by accident, but claims he meant it. At first, Chelsea was another one of Charlie's one-night stands, but it soon evolved into a relationship. The relationship comes to a rut with Chelsea wanting to break up, but after some couples counseling, the two remained together. Charlie proposed to her, ring and all, just to get her to say "I love you" back to him, and until the middle of season 7, they were engaged to be married. When Chelsea moved into the Harper beach house, Charlie rented out her vacant apartment to get alone time. Chelsea has a cat named "Sir Lancelot", who was almost never seen on-camera (two exceptions are in "Mmm, fish. Yum." and "Tinkle like a Princess") and was constantly being stepped on, mostly by Charlie, but once by Alan. Chelsea got along well with Evelyn, much to Charlie's chagrin, and had a very rocky relationship with her nephew-to-be Jake, until Charlie forced them to work out their issues. Charlie had a telephone video of one of their lovemaking events, but when Chelsea found out, she erased the video herself. The two eventually broke up due to Charlie's jealousy towards her friendship with Alan's lawyer, Brad. Charlie then made matters worse by vomiting on a baby in public while apologizing to her, and subsequently slept with Chelsea's best friend, Gail (Tricia Helfer). Chelsea's last appearance was in the first episode of Season 9, when she announced at Charlie's funeral that he gave her chlamydia; Gail, who also attended, said Charlie gave "her" vaginal warts.
Betsy.
Betsy (Katy Mixon) first met the Harper brothers the day Charlie and Chelsea set the date for their wedding. Panicked over the impending end of his bachelor lifestyle, Charlie finds himself blacked out drunk in bed with Betsy and Alan shortly after their meeting in Pavlov's Bar. With little memory of the night's events, Alan and Charlie left her home before dawn. Only remembering flashes of himself, his brother, and Betsy fooling around naked, shortly after Alan performed a striptease in drag, Charlie went to his mother for advice. To help wipe the disturbing memories from Charlie's mind, Evelyn told him of the time she cheated on her third husband with circus folk, including a clown, strongman, bearded lady, acrobats, and dwarfs, in one debased night. Traumatized by Evelyn's story, Charlie's few memories of the night were now replaced with images of his mother's circus orgy. When Charlie and Betsy encounter each other again, they immediately run off to Las Vegas and have a "quickie" wedding. But the marriage is soon rendered invalid when it is revealed that Betsy is already married.
Michelle.
Michelle (Liz Vassey) is Charlie's dermatologist. In "Twanging Your Magic Clanger," they met when Charlie was getting a mole removed from his behind. They went to a movie and Charlie was surprised to learn that she is older than he is. After Alan telling him that he's probably gonna be dead for ten years by the time she turns 70 (which ironically came true, as he died not too long after), he went to Michelle and told her that he was interested in being in a relationship with her. He then met Michelle's 20-year old daughter, which led him to briefly think about sex with the daughter. But after finding out that she thinks "older guys" (much younger than Charlie) are bad to have sex with, he returns to Michelle. In "The Crazy Bitch Gazette," Michelle and Charlie went on a date where they had lunch with Evelyn and Alan, causing a few embarrassing details about Charlie's past to slip out. When they got to Charlie's house, Charlie introduced Michelle to Berta and told Michelle about his past girlfriends and other sordid details of his life. To Charlie's surprise, Michelle still wanted to be with him. Later that night, however, Charlie's neighbor/stalker Rose appeared on his deck. Michelle was upset with Charlie, because he did not mention Rose in any of his confessions. Nor did he mention the fact that she constantly stalked him. The next week, Charlie went to Michelle's house with flowers and begged her to give him another chance. Michelle broke up with Charlie anyway, convinced that he still had feelings for Rose. At Charlie's funeral, Michelle builds on Lydia's remark about him by adding that he liked being spanked while wearing Michelle's panties.

Sokolac Castle

Sokolac Castle () is a castle in Brinje, Croatia. It is named after the Croatian word for hawk ("sokol"), which appears on the town's coat of arms.
History.
It dates back to medieval times, while the town was held by the noble Frankopan and Gorjanski families. The castle was part of an important medieval fortified city held by Frankopan family.
Sokolac Castle was an extremely grand building, dominated by the powerful perpendiculars of the entry tower, and the Chapel of the Holy Trinity. The entry into the burg was through a square, three-storey tower, the façades of which were relieved with lesenes linked at the top with blind arcades, making it a unique specimen in the whole of Central Europe.

Polly v. Lasselle

Polly v. Lasselle (Knox Co. Court Record #2490 [90-146-32] and #2890-2) was an 1820 state supreme court case in the U.S. state of Indiana where abolitionists attempted to free a slave from her master. The case resulted in the court ordering all slaves held within Indiana to be freed.
Background.
Slavery had been a legal institution in the region of Indiana when it was controlled by France and Great Britain, and remained legal until 1787 when the Northwest Territory was organized by the United States of America. The Northwest Ordinance prohibited further expansion of slavery in the region, but allowed for the continuation of existing slave arrangements.
When the Indiana territory was established in 1800, many slaveholders immigrated to the territory bringing their slaves with them. The territory passed legislation that allowed for the slaves to be indentured within the territory. This law allowed slaveholders to continue in their ownership of slaves that were purchased outside of the state, even if the slaves came to reside in Indiana.
When Indiana was granted statehood in 1816, the constitution instituted a ban on slavery. This ban brought the previous laws that had permitted slavery into conflict, and the issues of whether preexisting slave arrangements were still legal was brought before the courts on several occasions. Each time the circuit courts had denied or approved the freedom of the slaves on an individual basis.
Case.
In 1819 two abolitionists, John Osborn and Amory Kinney, sought the aid of a Vincennes law office to test the legality of slave arrangements made prior to 1816. The two were Canadians who had immigrated to Indiana after the War of 1812. They believed that the constitutional ban on slavery extended to all slaves, including those held before 1816. The lawyers at the office, Colonel George McDonald and Moses Tabbs, also members of the anti-slavery party, began to prepare a test case to bring before the courts.
To ensure their case would have the widest reaching effects, they chose to attempt to free a slave named Polly who belonged to Hyacinthe Lassalle of Vincennes. The Lassalles were among the oldest family of immigrants in the state and had been in the region since France had owned it in the 18th century. Lassalle's father was a French trader who settled near Fort Wayne around 1765 where he married a Miami woman, and John was born to the couple in 1777. Polly had been purchased before the Northwest Territory had been established, and if she could be freed then a precedent would be set whereby all other slaves in the state could also be set free. The defense of Lassalle was performed by Judge Jacob Call, a future Congressman.
The case was first submitted to the circuit court in Vincennes where it was ruled that Polly should remain a slave. The court cited the fact that Polly was owned before the Northwest Ordinance was passed, and the wording of the Virginia Deed of Cession as proof, claiming that Lassalle's ownership of Polly was protected by federal law.
In June 1820 the case was appealed to the Supreme Court of Indiana. Chief Justice Isaac Blackford was the son-in-law of McDonald, one of the plaintiff's lawyers. The plaintiff's lawyers argued that the constitution superseded all other laws, including one written prior to the constitution's adoption, and that the Northwest Ordinance ceased to apply to Indiana after statehood. The defense argued that the Northwest Ordinance, a federal law, superseded the state constitution and that it could have been repealed only by the federal government but was not repealed, it was still in effect regardless of Indiana's status in the Union. The court decided in favor of Polly and in the July decision court stated that
...the framers of our constitution intended a total and entire prohibition of slavery in this state. ...it follows, as an irresistible conclusion, that, under our present form of government, that slavery can have no existence in the State of Indiana, and, of course, that the claim of the said Lasselle cannot be supported.
Decision.
The decision was a major victory for the abolitionists in the state who had organized to ban slavery only seventeen years earlier. The result was that not just Polly but also all other slaves, including those held prior to Indiana statehood, were freed. There was some anger among the slaveholding community and violence was threatened against Osborn and Kinney, but no action was taken against them. The case also led to the impeachment of the Clark County Justice of the Peace for aiding slaveholders who refused to free their slaves. Many slaveholders, not wanting to lose their valuable slaves, left the state before their slaves could be taken from them.
The 1820 US census revealed that there were 190 slaves in Indiana and 1,200 free blacks, many of whom had been freed by the decision. The number of slaves dropped off dramatically and there were only three slaves in the state in both the 1830 and 1840 censuses.

KSAL (AM)

KSAL (1150 AM "NewsRadio 1150") is a radio station that broadcasts a news radio and talk format. Licensed to Salina, Kansas, USA, it serves the Salina-Manhattan area. The station is currently owned by MCC Radio, LLC.
History.
Early Legends.
Salina's most enduring radio station, it was originally called KSJS, the "SJ" standing for Salina Journal, its parent company. Its first owner was R.J. Laubengayer, who not only was president of the Salina Journal and KSAL, but director of Consolidated Printing and Farmers National Bank in Salina. The legendary Paul Harvey spent 3 years as KSAL's Station Manager before moving on to KOMA in Oklahoma City, as a news reporter.
The station went on the air in June 1937 at studios in the former Salina Journal building at the southwest corner of Seventh and Iron (today it's a parking lot). 
It was in that building that local radio legend Ken Jennison started his professional radio career (after 4 years at Kansas State University) in 1949. He began as a copywriter, putting together daily "logbooks" that tracked each day's broadcast from the moment the station went on the air at 6 a.m. to when it signed off with the "Star-Spangled Banner" at midnight (24-hour radio was in the future). 
"Everything was written down -- programs, commercials, introductions, music selection -- everything was in that book," Jennison said. "It would be given to the announcer, and he would follow it exactly. If you had a news break at 3 p.m., you had to time it out right."
Evolution.
In the early 1960s, tape was introduced. Announcements and commercials would be prerecorded on cassette tapes, Jennison said, and that took some of the pressure off disc jockeys. 
Live music also was a staple in the early days of radio. A popular program of the 1960s was the Sonny Slater show, which featured musicians playing live at the studio at noon on Saturdays. Live music programs didn't last long on local radio. 
"It was difficult to fill up a program with live music all the time," Jennison said. 
KSAL switched to news-talk in April 1996. During the mid-80's it was the only radio station in the area that had their own color weather radar that could actually predict when thunderstorms were entering a certain area.
Today.
Today, KSAL continues to be the area's only 24-hour staffed newsroom. They feature local morning, afternoon and weekend programing. Program Director Rich Alexander has organized a team of meteorologists who provide weather coverage on the station, which continues to be ranked #1 in the Salina metro area by Arbitron's ratings service.
KSAL-AM is also very involved in local and regional sports. In addition to area high school sports coverage, they are the Kansas State University sports & Kansas City Royals baseball affiliate for the Salina area.
Ken Jennison, who celebrates his 83rd birthday in 2010, continues to work at KSAL as their public service director. In 2012, KSAL will celebrate their 75th anniversary of broadcasting to the Salina area. According to Operations Manager Brian Jennings, the station is planning a year-long celebration of the radio station's commitment to the Salina area.

David Eder

(Montague) David Eder (1865–1936) was a British psychoanalyst, physician, Zionist and writer. He was best known for advancing psychoanalytic studies in Great Britain. 
Education and medical training.
Eder studied medicine at St. Bartholomew's Hospital in London. Following the completion of his studies, he travelled through the United States, South Africa and Bolivia, where he became a non-commissioned military surgeon for the Bolivian Army.
Eder returned to London in 1900 and went into general practice. His interest in paediatric medicine led to his appointment as Medical Officer of the London School Clinic in 1908 and of the Nursery School at Deptford in 1910. He was also the editor of the medical journal "School Hygiene".
In the First World War, Eder joined the British Army, serving in the Royal Army Medical Corps. As a temporary captain, he was appointed medical officer in charge of the psycho-neurological department in Malta. He would later recall the physical and mental injuries suffered by the frontline troops in his 1917 book "War-Shock, The Psycho-neuroses in War: Psychology and Treatment."
Psychoanalysis.
During the early 1910s, Eder became interested in the psychoanalytical theories emerging from Europe. Writing as M. D. Eder, he provided English-language translation for works by Carl Jung ("Diagnostic Association Studies" and "The Theory of Psychoanalysis") and Sigmund Freud ("Dream Psychology: Psychoanalysis for Beginners" and "On Dreams"). Eder would later prefer the Freudian approach to the Jungian approach.
Eder also authored original articles on psychoanalysis. His influence stretched beyond medical circles: the novelist D. H. Lawrence alluded to Eder’s pamphlet "The State Endowment of Motherhood" in the book "The White Peacock."
Major studies.
In 1932 he was elected president of the medical section of the British Psychological Society. That year, he presented his 1932 study "The Management of the Nervous Patient". First presented at the London Jewish Hospital Medical Society, the paper called for the combination of psychoanalysis into the process of medical diagnosis. "When this is not feasible," he said, "the physician's intelligence...must be employed to guide his patient to a measure of mental wholeness."
Also in 1932, Eder presented his concept of the Myth of Progress. Writing in the "British Journal of Medical Psychology", Eder argued that while civilization is moving forward due to advances in science, politics and technology, these advances are actually contributing to greater unhappiness as man perceives a loss of control over his environment.
Politics.
Outside of his medical work, Eder was active in Britain's Socialist politics and was involved in the Fabian Society, the leading British socialist organisation. As a supporter of the Zionist cause, Eder served as the Zionist Executive in Palestine from 1921 to 1927, and was later president of the Zionist Federation of Great Britain. Eder was opposed to dividing Palestine into two states, and was quoted as saying: "There can be only one national home in Palestine, and that a Jewish one, and no equality in the partnership between Jews and Arabs."

Grozny Oblast

Grozny Oblast () was an administrative entity (an "oblast") of the Russian SFSR that was established as Grozny Okrug () on March 7, 1944 and abolished on January 9, 1957.
Formation.
After the 1940–1944 insurgency in Chechnya, the Soviet government deported the entire Chechen and Ingush population. The vacated Chechen-Ingush ASSR was abolished, and its territory partitioned, with the southern mountainous region being joined to the Georgian SSR, the western Ingush populated area to the North Ossetian ASSR, and the eastern strip of like size to the Dagestan ASSR. The resulting territory was joined with vast Kizlyarsky District and with Naursky District of Stavropol Krai.
Most of the territory in the north was mixed Nogay and ethnic Russian (Terek Cossack), although southern areas did include excessive ethnic Chechen land, that was now vacated. This was settled mostly by refugees from the western regions of the USSR who fled the Nazi German invasion and occupation. By the mid-1950s economically the region became profitable.
Abolishment and consenquences.
In 1956, however, the Soviet government issued a new decree on re-habilitation of the repressed peoples. Several thousand Chechens and Ingush took this chance to move back to their ancestral home. This was met with mixed signals, on one hand this allowed for a very potential workforce, on the other question arose of re-establishment of the ChIASSR and a full re-habilitation of the Chechens and Ingush people. The latter created several problems as most of their homes were now occupied by re-settlers. Nonetheless, in January 1957 the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR re-instated the ChIASSR and abolished Grozny Oblast. However, the pre-1944 borders were not preserved. Kizlyarsky District was passed to the Dagestan ASSR (which administered it during 1923–1937) and two left-bank Terek River districts (Naursky and Shelkovsky) adjacent to Chechnya were retained by the ChIASSR. This was done for two reasons, primarily due to the firm economic ties they developed to Grozny, but also to dilute the new republic's ethnic composition, as they became the central settlement zones for the returning Chechens (to avoid them being re-settled into the mountainous zones).
Upon return, the deported peoples were met negatively by the region's still pre-dominant Russian population, especially in the feuds over land and homes. This erupted in the August 1958 riots where the Russians demanded that either the Grozny Oblast be restored or the ChIASSR be transformed into a republic with no titular nation like neighbouring Dagestan. The riot was put down by the Soviet militsiya.
As a result of this, by the mid-1970s a systematic emigration of Russians from the republic started, due to the social discirimation in favour of the only nationality (all administrative roles of Checheno-Ingushetia by the late 1970s were held by Chechens). By the end of the 1980s, Chechens formed the majority in all mountainous regions, and almost half of the population in traditional ethnic Russian/Cossack regions (left banks of the Terek and Sunzha Rivers, cities of Grozny and Gudermes) the catalyst was set for the mass ethnic cleansing of the Russian population that took place in the 1990s. Today Russians make up a tiny minority in both Chechnya and Ingushetia.

Henni Zuël

Henrietta "Henni" Zuël (born 6 January 1990) is an English professional golfer and the youngest ever player to join the Ladies European Tour as an amateur. She was a nominee for Britain’s Best Awards for Home Grown Talent and entered the professional Ladies European Tour after turning pro in 2008.
Early years.
Born in Salisbury, Wiltshire, Zuël’s interest in golf first materialised at the age of nine, when she watched the Masters on television. Transfixed by the golf on display and, after watching José María Olazábal triumph, Henni stated her intention to become a golfer.
Upon receiving her first set of golf clubs, Zuël played whenever she had a spare moment. Often she practiced in her back garden, sometimes under floodlight, filming herself on camcorder to analyse and improve her game. Winning her first tournament, the T-peg junior golf competition in Dorset, confirmed that the practice was paying off.
1999–2008: amateur career.
By the time Zuël was 13, she had cut her handicap to two on the way to winning 17 Opens at Under-18 level, never finishing outside the top 10 in 50 other tournaments. Zuël was also personally selected by Nick Faldo as the youngest member of Team Faldo, which offered her the chance to play in such far flung places as the US and Asia.
In 2003, Zuël became the Yeovil Ladies club Champion and England’s Under-13s champion. She also won the Dorset Ladies County Championship and joined the Ladies European Tour - the youngest player ever to do so - enabling her to play alongside Sophie Gustafson, Laura Davies, Paula Martí and Karin Koch.
In 2004, Zuël won the Central European Under-16 Championship and the English Under-15 Championship on the way to winning the Welsh Ladies Open in 2005 at just 15 years old. Zuël also added the Welsh Ladies Golf Union Under-21 trophy to her growing list of championship wins.
The same year at the Roehampton Gold Cup, a semi professional tournament featuring a field of 30 professionals, Zuël finished as the top amateur and was 2nd overall, just one shot behind the winner, who was a competing professional on the European Tour.
Also in 2005, Henni shot a course record 60 on the way to winning the Weston-Super-Mare Open and qualified for the "Daily Telegraph" Final held in Dubai.
As part of her duties for Team Faldo, Zuël won the Faldo Series East region and qualified to play in the final at the Celtic Manor Resort, the scene of Team Europe’s third successive win the following year in the Ryder Cup.
In 2006, Zuël missed the cut by one shot in both the Hungarian and Tenerife Ladies Open, but did make the cut in the BMW Ladies Open. All three tournaments were on the Ladies European Tour. Henni finished as the best amateur at the Hungarian and Italian ladies events.
At Liphook, Zuël won the scratch trophy, setting a new course record of 7 under par from the men’s tees and breaking the men’s record by one shot. She took this good form to the Mauritian Open, where she finished 7th and gained her first top ten finish in a Ladies European Tour Event.
Zuël began 2007 in 2nd place at the St Rule Trophy held at the famous St Andrews course in Scotland and then went on to win the Girls' British Open Championship.
Later in the year, she played for Europe in the Junior Solheim Cup in Sweden, winning her singles match and the cup with 14 points to 10 and was subsequently selected for the Great Britain & Ireland squad for 2007/08. Henni was also honoured with the "Daily Telegraph"’s Joyce Wethered Award.
2008: turning professional.
In early 2008, Zuël realised a lifetime’s ambition by turning professional and immediately joined the Ladies European Tour, playing her first professional match in the Turkish Open.
Zuël's goals remain clearly focused. She still practices several hours a day and is determined to become European number one and, with America also beckoning, her ultimate goal is to become world champion. "I want to be European No.1 and then world No.1 - without a doubt. It is just more hard work to get there. More enjoyable hard work. I just love practising and love trying to improve. I spend five to eight hours practising every day and then another two hours in the gym. Tiger has changed the game technically but also in terms of fitness and flexibility. That has helped so much."
Zuël also wants to draw more females into the sport by demonstrating how women can reach the top of the game and enjoy playing the sport. "What I really want to do is make golf accessible to young girls and for them to see it more as a sport that can be played and enjoyed. I didn't really go out every weekend but it was something I enjoyed doing."
Despite having to put in countless hours of practice, Zuël still has plenty of time for other activities and believes her chosen vocation has never been in the way of her enjoying life to the full. "I don't feel like I've missed out on anything. I still go shopping with my friends and on cinema trips. For more girls to be play would be absolutely amazing."

In 2008, Zuël signed to the same management that also looks after footballer David Beckham. Zuël has said she often speaks to the football star about the pressures and pitfalls of professional sport.
"He is an inspiration to me - he has helped me a lot with advice and how to deal with different things," she says. "His work ethic is exceptional even now - he still does 60 free-kicks a week - and it is the little things which make him different. He still really loves the game so he is certainly someone I aspire to be like. We speak whenever we feel the need to and the one thing he says is: 'Just keep focused'. He inspires me to work hard and go the extra mile to achieve things."
Home club.
During the 2009 season, Henni moved to the Wiltshire and Somerset area, and now plays and practices at her home club of Cumberwell Park in Bradford on Avon.

The Story of the Last Thought

The novel The Story of the Last Thought (in German "Das Märchen vom letzten Gedanken") of the German-Jewish writer Edgar Hilsenrath is about the Armenian Genocide in 1915. The epic which has the form of a fairy tale ("Märchen") and for which Hilsenrath received many prizes is regarded as the most important book about this historical episode. In 2006 the president of Armenia presented the author with the State Award for Literature of the Republic of Armenia for his work.
Content.
"The Story of the Last Thought" is the history of a village in Anatolia that is being destroyed by the Turks. The main character is the Armenian Wartan Khatisian, whose son Thovma is dying. His last thought - the last thought of a man, the fairy tale says, is beyond time - is being told the history of his ancestors, the life of suffering of the Armenian people. The storyteller Meddah guides the last thought of Thovma along the life paths of his father, that lead from a small idyllic mountain village into the torture chambers of the Turkish rulers, and let him become a witness of the big pogrom against the Armenians in 1915. “By means of an oriental fairy tale, and drawing from sagas and legends of this distressed nation, Hilsenrath goes far back into Armenian history and touches upon the plight of all genocide victims. A cruel book and nevertheless a book of love, of hope and of wonders.” (Cover text) Despite choosing a fictitious genre the historical facts have been carefully investigated and verified by the author.
Translated on Armenian by Lili Ter-Minasyan.
Awards.
For his epic "The Story of the Last Thought" Edgar Hilsenrath has received many prizes. In 1989 Günter Grass presented him with the prestigious "Alfred Döblin prize". In 2006 the president of Armenia, where Hilsenrath is regarded as a national hero, honoured him with the State Award for Literature of the Republic of Armenia for his work. Also in 2006 he received an Honorary Doctorate from the Yerevan State University for his work.
Reception and debate.
After the first publication of Hilsenrath's novel (in Germany in 1989) the critic Alexander von Bormann wrote in the Swiss newspaper "Neue Zürcher Zeitung" with regard to Franz Werfel's "The Forty Days of Musa Dagh", the novel that had previously been considered to be the most important book about Armenia in world literature: “But I think Hilsenrath's novel is significantly superior to Werfel's: it is a historic and poetic novel at the same time.”
According to Dagmar C. G. Lorenz, "Hilsenrath's "Marchen vom letzten Gedanken" is a powerful artistic statement against all forms of oppression. In addition to racism and nationalist arrogance, Hilsenrath isolates inequality, poverty, and ignorance, but above all, dishonesty, as factors contributing to genocide. The dynamics of oppression and submission are present in all enclaves of society and thus difficult to combat, although Hilsenrath argues that to avoid further genocides they must be eradicated."
Manfred Orlick judged: “Over and over they say: one cannot write about this topic like this. But the author has managed to delineate the cruelties through innumerable short dialogues, to portray them movingly and in this way get across the historical facts. An inhuman book of fairy tales as only Hilsenrath could write it.”
The author himself considers "The Story of the Last Thought" to be his most poetic work.
The English translation was published in Great Britain in 1990 (paperback 1994).

Luis Del Valle

Luis Orlando Del Valle Valentín (b. Bayamon, Puerto Rico January 27, 1987) is a professional boxer from Puerto Rico.
Biography.
Luis Orlando, who is related to former WBO bantamweight champion Rafael Del Valle, began boxing at the age of 14 at the Caná Boxing Club in Bayamon, Puerto Rico, losing his first amateur fight despite a spirited effort on his part. Instead of being disheartened by the setback, it served to motivate Luis to come back and just get better. 
With hard work and determination he continued to develop as a fighter at such an impressive pace that in just one year he had become Puerto Rico’s National Junior Olympics champion, bringing medals to the island during his 2-year reign. The trend continued as he represented the island at the 2004 under 19 World Championships in Korea.
Being too young to try out for the 2004 Olympic team, his trainer sent him to New York where he won both the New York and National Golden Gloves tournaments representing Newburgh Boxing Club. His stunning rise through the ranks of the amateur boxing world took an unexpected turn when he was invited to the United States national team. “We decided to stay because things were going fine and traveling a lot. In Puerto Rico, Carlos Velazquez (2004 Olympian and current professional rising star) had decided to stay for the 2008 cycle and they only send the No. 1 to fight abroad. In the U.S., I had the chance to gain more international experience which has helped me a lot.”
Del Valle represented the United States at the 2007 Pan Am Games and many others International Competitions such as the 2005 International Tammer Tournament In Tampere,Finland. 2006 Six Nation Cup in Porto Torres, Italy.2006 Ken Goff Memorial Boxing Classic In Regina,Canada collecting two gold and a bronze medal in the process. Del Valle came up short against the eventual 2008 Olympic team member Raynell Williams in the U.S. Championships at 125 pounds.
Amateur career.
Del Valle began Boxing at the age of 14 losing his first amateur fight and ends his amateur career with a record of 112-14.
Professional career.
After eight years and 126 amateurs fights Orlandito made his professional debut on April 11, 2008 defeating Rey Rivera by the way of third round knock out. His second professional fight was an impressive first round knock out victory over United States' Emanuel Rose.
On September 27, 2008 fighting as a promotional free agent, Del Valle dominated Francisco Palacios to get a unanimous decision after six rounds of action. Less than one month later (October 24, 2008) Del Valle moved to 4-0 3 kos fighting for the first time as a pro in his native Puerto Rico. After dropping fellow Puerto Rican Jean Carlos Padilla (7-3 4 kos)in the third, fourth and fifth rounds Del Valle went for the kill prompting a technical knock out at the 52 seconds mark of round number five.
After signing with Lou Dibella of Dibella entertainment on August 26, 2010 Orlandito made his debut under the DBE banner stopping Robert Guillen impressively in five rounds. On October 24, 2009 he was back in Puerto Rico facing crafty southpaw Christoher Rivera. After an interesting first round where Rivera attempted to keep Del Valle in the center of the ring, Luis imposed his crowd pleasing style dominating with a relentless attack to Rivera's body. The end came at the third round where a solid hook to the liver sent Rivera down for the count.
On December 16, 2009 he scored a second round stoppage of Mexico's Noe Lopez Jr. who had decision losses against the likes of Dat Nguyen and Gary Russell (boxer)in his previous fights. Lopez claimed a hand injury as the reason of the stoppage. On March 27, 2010 Del Valle scored an impressive first round ko over 4-2 (4 kos) Puerto Rican Jorge Cordero.
On Saturday July 10, 2010 "Orlandito" stepped his career up a notch when he faced rugged veteran Pasqual Rouse for the New York State Featherweight Title. Del Valle utilized his resources to deal with Rouse's experience and rough style finally putting him down for the count in the fourth round. With the win Del Valle clinches his first profesional boxing title having knocked out 80% of his opponents to date. As part of the Paul Williams-Sergio Martinez II undercard Del Valle had the chance to set the record straight against Noe Lopez Jr. Putting on a nearly flawless performance Orlandito dropped Lopez three times on his way to a third round TKO victory.
On February 18, 2011 fighting in Ponce Puerto Rico Del Valle moved to 12-0, 10 KOs by stopping fellow Puerto Rican Irvin Hernandez at 2:49 of round six. June 11, 2011 Showtime's main event against fellow prospect Dat Nguyen in New York on the eve of the Puerto Rican day parade. Del Valle dominated by scores of 99-91 on all three official score cards.
In September 2012 Del Valle's unbeaten streak came to an end as he was dominated by veteran and former champion Vic Darchinyan.

Britain's Next Top Model (cycle 5)

Britain's Next Top Model, Cycle 5 is the fifth cycle of "Britain's Next Top Model" and the fifth cycle to air on Living. With an increased budget, Cycle 5 claims to be "bigger, better and more high-fashion than ever before."
The winner of this cycle, like the previous cycles (excluding Cycle 1), received a contract with modelling agency Models 1, became the face of a Max Factor cosmetics compaign, and a cover and six-page spread in Company Magazine. This was Lisa Snowdon's last series as the host and was replaced by supermodel Elle Macpherson.
Mecia Simson was announced as the winner of the competition.
Runner up Sophie Sumner would later claim victory as the winner of .
Production.
This cycle saw major changes in the show. While Lisa Snowdon and Huggy Ragnarsson both returned to the judging panel, head garment designer and distinguished milliner, Louis Mariette, took over from Gerry DeVeaux. This series was also the first to feature a boot-camp stage, with 20 semi-finalists starting the competition in the cycle premiere, the largest amount of girls that the show has started with so far. 7 girls were eliminated in the first episode, and the number of finalists was reduced to the final 13 who entered the Britain's Next Top Model house, in London.
This is the second cycle (After Cycle 1) with two international destinations. In episode 6, the final 9 contestants travelled to Reykjavík, Iceland and in episode 9 the final 5 contestants travelled to Buenos Aires, Argentina.
Episode summaries.
The Girls Go To Boot Camp.
"Original Airdate: 20 April 2009"
The 20 potential contestants arrive at a country manor house with a champagne reception, and are soon greeted by host Lisa, who informs them they are to enter the gruelling model boot camp. Amongst the girls is Hayley, who was chosen by the public to take part following an online vote. After completing an assault course at Henfold Lakes Dorking, now home to the famous 'Nuts Challenge' (probably the longest army assault course in the world) the girls did a catwalk challenge featuring clothing from the Ed Hardy range, as well as a brief individual meeting with the judges, 5 girls are eliminated when they don't find dog tags in boxes placed on their beds.
The episode's photo challenge sees the remaining 15 girls put in the following three groups of five for an army inspired shoot with Huggy:
At panel, the judges have praise for Hayley and Kasey, who both stand out in their pictures, as well as Lauren, who is rather bizarrely told by new judge Louis that she is 'the new Moulin Rouge'.
Daisy is told she looks dead in the eyes, while Ashley disappoints when she states she is not happy with the way she has photographed. Mecia receives the first call out and is thrilled to be told she has booked a billboard campaign in the USA for Christian Audigier, after impressing on the catwalk. Ultimately, 2 more girls are eliminated; Nell because of some wrist worry from the judge, and Rebecca over concern of her commitment to the competition. The 13 girls are finally ready to enter the Top Model house.
Quizzes and Castings.
"Original Airdate: 27 April 2009"
The girls excitedly move into the model house and are thrilled with their new abode. The following morning they are split into two teams for a very raucous fashion quiz, with the winners (Ashley, Daisy, Jade, Kasey, Lisa-Ann & Sophie) receiving designer watches. The week's challenge is to film an advert on the Millennium bridge wearing Elizabeth Emanuel bridal wear. The girls have to deliver some dialogue then kiss a male model. Kasey impresses and wins the challenge, while Mecia irritates the photographer by refusing to kiss the model, worried she will upset her boyfriend of four years.
The girls return home to find high heels all over the living room and are delighted when J. Alexander (Miss J) appears from behind a curtain and informs the 'model bitches' it's time for them to learn how to walk. Daisy and Hayley prove to be amongst the strongest, while Lisa-Ann and Chloe's efforts are heavily derided and amusingly imitated by Miss J.
The week's photoshoot challenge asks the girls to pose naked in a bath of water filled with mangos for the brand Simple Cosmetics. Sophie struggles, going into 'panic mode' once in the water, while Ashley is concerned how her body will look considering she has had two children.
At elimination, the judges have praise for Daisy, Hayley, Mecia and Kasey, while Chloe is told her picture looks like soft porn. Mecia is also reprimanded for her performance at the week's challenge. Ultimately, Sophie and Lisa-Ann wind up in the bottom two; Sophie because of her poor performance at the photo-shoot and Lisa-Ann due to having a generally dismal week. Lisa-Ann is the first girl to be sent home from the model house.
Re-style and Rhythm.
"Original Airdate: 4 May 2009"
Tensions rise in the model house when Annaliese tells the other girls to turn off the kitchen's extractor fan as she can smell mackerel and tuna in her bedroom at the other side of the house. Chloe answers back, accusing Annaliese of not washing her scrambled eggs pan with washing up liquid, which results in Annaliese angrily branding Chloe a wannabe porn star and lads mag model.
The following day the girls arrive at Daniel Galvin salon to excitedly receive their long awaited makeovers. Madeleine is very upset with her short, asymmetric ginger bob, and thinks she looks like a boy or "even a lesbian". Sophie and Ashley are also less than pleased with their short, edgier haircuts, although Kasey takes the removal of her blonde weave in her stride and seems happy with her short black bob. It is Viola, however, who impresses the salon's management the most, and she is chosen to model for their 50th anniversary ad campaign.
The week's challenge involves the girls performing a dance routine in groups of four at London's Movida nightclub. Mecia and Annaliese impress and they along with the winning group of four (Ashley, Daisy, Hayley, & Kasey) get to party the night away at the club, while the losers return home. At the week's photo shoot, the girls are taken to an underground carpark and are shocked when they're told they are to be paired up and will be kissing their partner in the following pairs:
Sophie is disgusted that she will have to kiss Mecia, who has been sick the night before from drinking too much. Hayley, Daisy and Lauren perform confidently, while Chloe, in particular, struggles to feel comfortable on set.
At panel, the judges have praise for Hayley, Daisy, Kasey and Jade. Madeleine is reprimanded for her attitude at the makeovers, but it is Ashley and Chloe who land in the bottom two for their weak performance at the photoshoot, with Chloe being told by photographer Nicky Johnston that her becoming a model is about as likely as him studying medicine at Harvard. In a shocking twist, Lisa announces that both girls are to be given another chance and no-one is eliminated.
Charity.
"Original Airdate: 11 May 2009"
Returning home from judging panel, many of the girls, particularly Sophie and Daisy, are angry that nobody was eliminated. Chloe in particular is targeted, with some girls questioning her place in the competition.
The following morning the girls are excited to meet 'rock royalty', Jo Wood, who challenges them to perform a short inspirational speech in front of a group of 12–16-year-olds. Jade impresses, talking candidly about her battle with anorexia, while Chloe particularly disappoints with her talk on her passion, make up. She also gets in trouble for lecturing against animal cruelty whilst wearing a leather jacket. Surprisingly to some of the other girls, Daisy wins the challenge.
The next day the girls meet Johnny Vaughan at Capital FM, who interviews the girls in groups of three, with Lisa watching behind the scenes. Viola performs particularly badly, not saying one word throughout, while Annaliese impresses and wins the challenge, choosing to take Ashley on a shopping spree for the prize.
The week's photo challenge involves the girls posing for adverts highlighting issues raised by various different charities and campaigns as follows:
At panel the judges told that Sophie's close-up is a mess, but the wide is insane. Both Jade and Daisy continues to impress, but Ashley produced the most believable photo, of which she has been a victim of domestic violence in the past. Both Viola and Madeleine impressed for their QUIT campaign, but the rest is received much more negative reviews. Ultimately, Lauren and Kasey wind up in the bottom two, and Lauren is sent home because of her limited look and the lack of variety in her facial expressions.
Kylie Couture.
"Original Airdate: 18 May 2009"
The girls are taken to a London club where they are introduced to Louise Redknapp. In turn, the girls interview Louise, with the girl that impresses the most having her interview featured on Handbag.com. Sophie and Chloe are reprimanded for asking inappropriate and negative questions, but Hayley impresses and is delighted to be chosen by Louise as the winner.
The week's second reward challenge sees the girls modelling hats and headwear by judge Louis, and having to walk elegantly to impress a party of people, including Fashion Director, Hilary Alexander, who asks each girl probing questions. Again, Chloe disappoints, tripping on some rose petals on the floor, but Louis is pleased with the performances by Hayley, Daisy and especially Jade, who wins the challenge and a specially made head piece designed by Louis.
Back at the house, the girls are excited to receive a video message from Kylie Minogue, who explains that this week's photo-shoot will be for her new perfume, 'Couture', and the girls will be wearing elegant evening dresses harking back to 1920s glamour. At the photo-shoot, Jade and Mecia impress, while Kasey and Chloe struggle to relax on set.
At panel, the judges have praise for Jade, who receives the first call out, as well as Daisy and Mecia. Ultimately, Kasey and Chloe wind up in the bottom two for producing lacklustre photos, and the girls are shocked when Lisa reveals that they are both eliminated from the competition due to not pushing through and delivering strong pictures.
Ice Queens.
"Original Airdate: 25 May 2009
The girls are excited to learn they are to go on a surprise overseas trip where they are to take part in a photoshoot in the freezing cold. The following day, judge and photographer Huggy Ragnarsson meets them at London Heathrow Airport and reveals they're going to Iceland. At dinner in their new destination, some of the girls question what they're eating - a harbinger of the challenge they will face the next day.
The challenge is to shoot a commercial to market Iceland. Andrea Brabin, who runs a casting agency, tells the girls they are to wear Icelandic clothes, eat Icelandic food and recite a line in the local language, while shooting the commercial. The sheep's head horrifies the girls and some girls have trouble eating the delicacy, including Jade who does not eat the meat because of her vegetarianism. Some excel in the commercial however, especially Sophie, who is the eventual winner of the challenge.
The girls' photo shoot the next day is on the rocky shoreline of the Blue Lagoon, with each girl representing a different queen. Most girls do a good job, based on feedback by Huggy who is the week's photographer, but Viola is lightly reprimanded for her inability to keep still.
Before the girls are due to leave Iceland, Viola and Ashley end up fighting back at the hotel, with Ashley accusing Viola of having no manners, which leaves Viola angry and in tears.
Back in the UK and straight at panel, Daisy is given the opportunity to be a guest judge on the panel due to the fact that she excelled at the photoshoot, making her exempt from elimination. Viola is told by Huggy and Lisa that her picture is strong, but Louis disagrees, thinking she looks boring and flat. Jade's picture, however, is unanimously praised, and she is told that she is growing in confidence and definitely progressing.
Ultimately, Annaliese and Madeleine end up in the bottom two. Annaliese is told that her energy and enthusiasm is causing her to lose focus while the judges see Madeleine as having an ideal face for beauty but she is missing height and edge. In the end, Madeleine is sent home due to her lack of editorial appeal.
Sink or Swim.
"Original Airdate: 1 June 2009"
The weekly challenge involves the girls all posing for photographs wearing Faith shoes, with the winning two pictures being displayed in shop windows throughout the country. Despite good performances from Jade and Annaliese, it is Sophie and Ashley who impress the most and win the challenge, and as an extra treat, the girls are taken to a luxury nail salon, where they get the chance to drink champagne and discuss the behaviour of their fellow competitors.
The week's photo-shoot proves to be the most gruelling to date, with each girl posing underwater in a large tank, wearing a Louis Mariette headpiece and a gown designed by Debbie Gething (now Debbie Wingham). Jade impresses the most, despite being so light that she finds it hard to stay under water, although Hayley and Viola panic and do not perform so confidently.
Back at the house, there is further tension, mainly surrounding Viola's supposed attitude problem. But it is Ashley and Mecia who end up coming to blows, with Mecia accused of being a 'two-faced bitch' with regards to her behaviour around Viola.
At panel, most of the girls produced poor photos, and only Jade, Viola and Ashley shine. Jade received yet another first call-out for her outstanding photo and her facial expression underwater, while Viola is very close behind, as the judges really like how she changes herself underwater so she can look "Long, Lean, and Beautiful". Ashley shocked Lisa when she pulled off a decent photo, but rest of the others failed to impress the judges.
Sophie's pose in her photo received positive reviews, however her facial expression was criticized heavily. Mecia was lambasted for looking dead and drowned in her photo rather than beautiful, while Annaliese's bubbly personality did not show in her photo but ended up looking "afraid of a shark coming". But it was Daisy and Hayley, both of them producing stunning shots the week before but poor photos this week. Daisy's stronger performance keeps her safe while Hayley's inconsistent performance sent her home.
Surprise Casting.
"Original Airdate: 8 June 2009"
The seven remaining girls return to the house following Hayley's surprise elimination, and Mecia finds she is the only girl to receive a personal letter from Hayley, upsetting Ashley who felt that, also being Scottish, she should have got one too. The girls learn that they are to attend two separate castings, with the first being for Imodium. Viola struggles, and admits she is unaware what the product is, whilst Sophie is unable to correctly name the product. Ashley is initially confident, but following her meeting, finds that the other girls are shocked at how blunt her description of the product was. Annaliese impresses, and wins a potential role in a television campaign for Imodium, to the amusement of the others.
At the second casting, the girls are excited to meet Pearl Lowe who is looking for another girl to star alongside her daughter, the model Daisy Lowe for her new look-book. Mecia is selected as the best and wins the job. Jade is told that she is to skinny for the campaign, and she breaks down on the way home.
Next the girls head to a wind tunnel, to film a potential commercial for Rice Cakes. Sophie tells Viola that people have died from using a wind tunnel, causing her to perform badly. Daisy is deemed the best, and wins tickets to a private fashion party, choosing to take Sophie with her.
At the party, and just as Sophie is expressing her delight that 'Scouse' was eliminated, Chloe's cousin, and former BNTM runner-up Abigail Clancy arrives, prompting Sophie to worry that Chloe had said bad things about her. Later, Daisy and Sophie lie to the other girls, making up a story that they met a fictional fashion designer, which most of the other girls, and Jade in particular believe.
The girls head to their photo shoot which sees them posing with a burning car for a potential Lipsy campaign. Abigail appears to monitor the girls' performances on set, and Daisy and Sophie are forced to reveal that they had met her the night before, which the others take it in good humour. At panel, Abigail returns as the guest judge for the week, and informs the rest of the panel that Sophie seemed like a know-it-all and acting disgustingly every time.
The girls are generally considered disappointing, including Jade which had been always producing impressive shots the previous weeks. The only girl that had a stunning photo is Viola, as the judges really inspired with how she changed her shy persona into a glamorous woman in the shot, and she also using her whole body as an asset and working them together to produce a powerful photograph with her personality successfully comes through. However, even if her shot isn't close to match Viola's impressive shot (mostly because she totally forgot the car), Mecia was deemed very good on the set (as did Viola's) and the client love her, so she received the first call-out.
The rest of the girls produce a disappointing shots, such as: Jade is criticized for not knowing what she's doing because she didn't either look commercial or editorial, Ashley's pose deemed as decent but she totally forget the car. Daisy's body proportion is praised for looking long and lean, but her facial expression deemed by Huggy as "Driving Miss Daisy in Drag". But the last two girls are the most unimpressive. Sophie ended in the bottom two, despite producing a good photo but Abigail and the client was so disappointed of her because she acted disgustingly and seemed like a know-it-all, with Annaliese, who the judges think was holding back. Sophie is spared, with Annaliese sent home.
Face, Face, Face.
"Original Airdate: 15 June 2009"
The girls are immediately thrown into a photo shoot for Company magazine, the magazine that is going to put the winner on the cover. The twist is that the photo shoot is with the upcoming rock band The Script. This causes a few of the girls to get star struck and impacts negatively on their photo. Sophie wins the challenge and chooses Daisy to come with her to The Script's gig later that evening, with both girls enjoying champagne backstage with the band afterwards. Back at the house, tension brews when Ashley accuses Sophie of breaking a promise that they had made previously, where Sophie would take Ashley on a reward in exchange for tips on photoshoots.
The second challenge of the week is a commercial for Special K. Lisa, having done several commercials for the company, tells the girls now is the time to step up. She's especially concerned about Viola and even gives her a special pep talk with regards to her attitude. Jade also gets some one-to-one time with Lisa because of her weight, and she talks candidly about her battle with anorexia. Despite this extra attention, Sophie takes home the prize for the second time this episode, which was a video message from loved ones from home.
The photo shoot is a recreation of the famous Kate Moss lace body suit beauty shot. Terry O'Neill, who photographed the original, is not particularly impressed with anybody's performance on set, with the exception of Mecia and especially Jade, who he thinks might have something special.
After the shoot, Lisa shows off her skills from Strictly Come Dancing with her professional dance partner from the show, Brendan Cole. The dancing isn't completely irrelevant, as Lisa uses it to reveal that the girls (with the exception of one) are headed to Buenos Aires.
At panel, Terry has criticism for all the girls except Jade, with some judges expressing that they prefer Jade's picture to Kate Moss'. Mecia is told she would work better as an actress, while Terry tells Sophie that he doesn't 'get her look' at all. Ashley shocks the judges by admitting that she had attended the photoshoot hungover. Ashley winds up in the bottom two due to her lack of professionalism and Daisy is placed in the bottom two for producing lackluster photos, and it is early favourite Daisy and her 'wonky' eye who is shockingly sent home due to her lack of vitality and for looking older than she is, whilst the other girls get ready to head to Argentina.
Time to Tango.
"Original Airdate: 22 June 2009"
The girls excitedly arrive in Buenos Aires and are thrilled to be given a tour of the city by a sexy male model, who Viola seems particularly enamoured with. Their first task is to perform a fashion show for the local elite society, modelling polo clothes. Sophie is shocked to be criticised by Lisa for her steely expression and uninviting body language, while Jade is praised for her moves. The fivesome are allowed to enjoy the remainder of the party, which Sophie and Ashley use as an opportunity to flirt with the male guests.
The following day the girls head into the desert to do a casting for a commercial. They have a few lines to deliver including something in Spanish, as well as having to interact with the male models and get on a horse. Mecia struggles slightly with the words, and her Spanish is unintelligible. Jade does a fairly good job, while Ashley forgets her words and giggles too much. Viola is deemed the worst, completely forgetting her words and the director eventually gives up on her. Sophie, however, does an excellent job, and wins yet another challenge. Afterwards, they had to stay at Purmamarca for the night.
Next, the girls head into the famous Argentinian Salt Flats for a photo shoot for a potential nationwide campaign for Skin Bliss. Mecia has quite a good shoot, but lacks diversity of facial expressions, as does Ashley who is visibly nervous. Again, Viola does not let her personality shine through, while Jade and Sophie perform confidently.
At panel, Jade is praised for her photo, as is Sophie, who is thrilled to learn she has won the campaign. Despite producing a good photo, Viola is reprimanded for her unprofessional attitude on set at the commercial casting, and ends up in the bottom two with Ashley, who the judges feel is not taking the competition as seriously as she should. In a very shocking ending to everyone, Viola is sent home because the judges feeling she had seemed to give up, despite having a strong look, very strong portfolio and just had second call-out three weeks in a row and five in total.
Latino Dancing and Latino Loving.
"Original Airdate: 29 June 2009"
The girls are given a crash course in Latin dancing at a traditional Argentinian dance hall, and then an hour later sent to perform a tango on the streets of La Boca. None of the girls fare particularly well, although Ashley's confused performance leaves the most to be desired. Back at the house, Ashley argued with Sophie and feels that she was wanting to get Jade out of the house.
The following day the girls are sent on their first go-sees. The first is with Elite Model Management, who quiz the girls on their eating and exercise habits. Ashley admits that she has a bad diet, while Sophie does not impress when she states that shopping comprises the largest part of her exercise regime. The second go-see is at the boutique of top designer, Benito Fernandez, where each girl enjoys strutting their stuff in his colourful clothes. Next the girls are taken to see haute couture designer Pablo Ramirez, where Louis announces that Jade has impressed the most throughout the day, and she is delighted to be able to choose one of Pablo's dresses to keep.
Back at the house, the girls are joined again by their model tour guide, Ivan, and his equally dashing friend. The evening's drinking games lead to frolics in the pool, resulting in Ashley and Sophie getting amorous with the boys, and Sophie branding Ashley's aggressive goodbye kiss with her man as bordering on soft porn.
The next day's photo-shoot is for the very high fashion Catalogue magazine, with each girl having to pose seductively with a male model while dressed in regal attire. Sophie sets the bar high with an impressive performance on set, while Jade also shines, delivering some sexy poses, which leaves Sophie questioning whether Jade is as nice and innocent as she seems.
At panel, Jade received another first call-out, thus making her tie with Cycle 3's runner up Louise Watts for the most collective first call-out in a season for the model. However, Mecia and a very nervous Ashley in the bottom two. Mecia is criticised for not interacting effectively with the boy model and an uninspiring performance on set as well as not delivering a variety of facial expressions, but at least has produced a lucky shot, while it is agreed that Ashley looks stiff in her photo and might have given too little too late. Unfortunately, it is Ashley that is sent back to the UK.
The Finale Is Coming.

Desert Christ Park

Desert Christ Park is a sculpture garden in Yucca Valley, California. The park was sculpted and created by Antone Martin, a former aircraft worker who died in 1961 at the age of 74. Martin started sculpting the figures during the height of the Cold War atomic bomb scare of the mid-1940s, hoping that the sculptures would inspire global peace. Sculptures include The Twelve Apostles, Martha, Mary, angels, and a 15-foot-tall, 3 ton statue of Jesus, reminiscent of Rio de Janeiro's famous and much larger hilltop Christ the Redeemer. The park was neglected between 1988 and 1996, while the ACLU sued San Bernardino County for separation of church and state issues, after which a nonprofit foundation took over and renovated the park.

Bourne (film series)

The Bourne films are a series of action/thriller spy films based on the character Jason Bourne, a CIA assassin suffering from extreme memory loss, created by author Robert Ludlum.
All three of Ludlum's novels were adapted for the screen, featuring Matt Damon as the titular character in each. Doug Liman directed "The Bourne Identity" (2002), Paul Greengrass directed "The Bourne Supremacy" (2004) and "The Bourne Ultimatum" (2007). Tony Gilroy co-wrote each film and directed "The Bourne Legacy" (2012).
Damon chose not to return for the fourth film. The character of Jason Bourne does not appear in "Legacy", but mention of his name and pictures of Damon as Bourne are shown throughout the film.
The series is noted for its realism, in contrast to the growing use of computer-generated imagery in the action genre.
Films.
"The Bourne Identity".
A man (Matt Damon) is found floating in the Mediterranean Sea with two gunshot wounds in his back and a device with the number of a Swiss safe deposit box embedded in his hip. Upon reaching shore, the man assumes the name Jason Bourne after finding a passport under the name in the safe deposit box, along with other international passports, large amounts of assorted currencies, and a gun. He subsequently attempts to discover his true identity while countering attempts on his life by CIA assassins, eventually realizing that he is one such assassin who failed to complete his most recent mission. Bourne breaks his connections to the CIA and unites with Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente), a woman who helped him learn about his most recent actions prior to his memory loss. Bourne's conflict with the CIA reaches a climax when he takes the fight to their doorstep. Directed by Doug Leman.
"The Bourne Supremacy".
Some two years after learning that he is a trained assassin and breaking his connections with the CIA, Jason Bourne is framed for a crime connected to one of his past missions. A subsequent attempt on his life results in Marie's death, so he decides to take revenge by hunting down those responsible for her death and his forgotten past, thinking that the CIA is hunting him again. Bourne discovers that Ward Abbott (Brian Cox), one of the men who oversaw Operation Treadstone, the program which trained Bourne to be an assassin, stole millions of dollars from the CIA. Abbott meant to implicate Bourne in the theft with the frame-up, which would have led the CIA on a wild goose chase had Bourne been killed as intended. Bourne exposes Abbott to Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), the CIA agent in charge of finding Bourne, and Abbott commits suicide. During a long car chase with Bourne, the Russian agent who was paid to kill him and was responsible for Marie's death is killed, and Bourne goes into hiding.
"The Bourne Ultimatum".
After six weeks of hiding, Bourne learns that a British journalist has been investigating his past and contacts him to find out who his source is. Bourne is subsequently targeted by Operation Blackbriar, an upgraded Operation Treadstone, which has also taken note of the investigation. Believing that Bourne is a threat and is seeking revenge, Blackbriar's director Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) begins a new hunt for Bourne. Bourne manages to take classified documents proving that Blackbriar has targeted U.S. citizens; he is aided by Landy, who disagreed with Vosen from the beginning and does not support Blackbriar's existence, and former Treadstone logistics technician Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles). She may have had romantic feelings for Bourne before his final mission and resultant amnesia. Bourne finally comes face to face with the person who oversaw his behavioral modification as the first Treadstone operative some years earlier, memories of which resurface. Those responsible for Treadstone and Blackbriar are exposed, and Bourne goes underground.
"The Bourne Legacy".
Aaron Cross (Jeremy Renner) is a member of Operation Outcome, a United States Department of Defense black ops program which enhances the physical and mental abilities of field operatives through pills referred to as "chems". Cross is deployed to Alaska for a training assignment, traverses rugged terrain to reach a cabin operated by an exiled Outcome operative. The Blackbriar and Treadstone programs are publicly exposed, leading the FBI and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to investigate those involved. Retired Air Force Colonel Eric Byer (Edward Norton), who is responsible for overseeing the CIA's clandestine operations, decides to end Outcome and kill its agents. Cross manages to survive several attempts on his life and seeks a way to get more chems, as his have run out. Cross eventually comes upon Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz), his last link to gain more chems. He discovers she has no pills but that his physical enhancements have actually "viraled-out" and are now genetically permanent, so he no longer needs those. He reveals to her that without the help of the mental enhancements, he possesses an unfortunately well below-average IQ. To avoid this mental regression, and the hunting CIA operatives, the two travel to a factory in Manila hfjfjand with Shearing's help, Cross survives the possible mortal process of "viraling-out" of his dependency of the remaining mental enhancing pills. They evade additional attempts on their lives and successfully escape from the Philippines on a junk ship.
Future.
Universal confirmed at a media conference in Los Angeles, California, that they have plans to release more "Bourne" films, despite "Legacy" being given mixed reviews by critics. In a December 2012 interview, Matt Damon has revealed that he and Paul Greengrass are interested in returning for the next film as Jason Bourne and the director respectively. Damon is reported as saying that he had not seen "Legacy" yet, but intends to as he is not only curious to see how it turned out, but because he has enjoyed Jeremy Renner in everything he has seen him in. Damon does however believe that if he is to return for the next film, Renner would not likely be in it too and it would not have Bourne and Cross joining forces and working together. On November 8, 2013, however, Deadline reported that the fifth installment in the franchise will feature Renner's Cross, with Justin Lin directing. 
Treadstone, Blackbriar, Outcome, and LARX.
Each black-ops assassination program is a successor of the previous one. The original, Treadstone, was shut down after Bourne escaped with his life and Alexander Conklin was killed for his actions in the first film. Blackbriar, formed specifically to kill Bourne after he resurfaced in Paris and Moscow, was closed after Bourne and Pamela Landy faxed the kills of Blackbriar to a major news station. Outcome followed, enhancing the assets' abilities far beyond the limits of any previous program, relying on their taking pills known as "chems" which heightened their performance blue for mental, and green for physical. LARX appeared in The Bourne Legacy; "LARX is a beta 2 stem program. Amped mission fidelity, minimized empathy." Also described as; "Treadstone without the inconsistency. Outcome without the emotional noise."
Reception.
The "Bourne" series was met with both critical and commercial success. "Ultimatum" won three Academy Awards: Best Film Editing, Sound, and Best Sound Editing. Both "Supremacy" and "Ultimatum" won the Empire Award for Best Film.
Production.
Director Doug Liman stated that he had been a fan of "The Bourne Identity" by Robert Ludlum since he read it in high school. Near the end of production of Liman's previous film "Swingers", Liman decided to develop a film adaptation of the novel. After more than two years of securing rights to the book from Warner Brothers and a further year of screenplay development with screenwriter Tony Gilroy, the film went through two years of production. Liman approached a wide range of actors for the role of Bourne, including Russell Crowe and Sylvester Stallone, before he eventually cast Matt Damon. Liman found that Damon understood and appreciated that, though "The Bourne Identity" would have its share of action, the focus was primarily on character and plot. Production was difficult, with screenplay rewrites occurring throughout the entire filming and Liman constantly arguing with Universal's executives. "The Bourne Identity" was released in June 2002.
The films have been noted for their "well placed", "understated" and "tastefully done" product placement of a "diverse" range of brands, which in the case of the third film, earned the producers tens of millions of dollars. "The Bourne Identity" features brands such as "The Guardian" newspaper, BT Tower in London and Tag Heuer watches. "The Bourne Supremacy" features mobile phones made by Sony Ericsson. "The Bourne Ultimatum" features a total of 54 brands including "The Guardian" and BT for the second time; mobile phones made by Motorola, Nokia and Carphone Warehouse, most prominently the RAZR 2 and SLVR, as Motorola was a major sponsor and had a movie tie-in customized phone; cars made by BMW, Ford, Mercedes, and Volkswagen, most prominently the Volkswagen Touareg 2, as Volkswagen provided $25 million in funding; and technology products such as CTX computer monitors, Norton AntiVirus and the Google web search engine.
Music.
The song "Extreme Ways" by musician Moby is used as the end title theme of all four movies.

Mummy paper

Mummy paper is paper that is claimed to be made from the linen wrappings and other fibers (e.g. papyrus) from Egyptian mummies imported to America circa 1855. The existence of this paper has not been conclusively confirmed, but it has been widely discussed.
History.
The history of mummy paper in America is intimately connected with the history of both American papermaking and papermaking in general.
Supply shortages.
Paper can be said to have been born in ancient Egypt, circa 2000 B.C., with the invention of what the Romans called “papyrus”, based on an earlier Greek name for the material. Papyrus is not paper in the modern sense of the word, since it was formed from compressed sheets of reed stalks and not a pulp. Paper made from a pulped plant fiber can be credited to Ts’ai Lun of China in 105 A.D., when he first presented the Emperor a sheet of paper made from the inner bark of a mulberry tree. When the technique of papermaking found its way into Europe, paper was made not from trees but from a pulp of cotton and linen rag fibers. This technique of papermaking first came to America in Germantown, Pennsylvania in 1690 when William Rittenhouse established the first paper mill. Rittenhouse had been a papermaker in Amsterdam, the Netherlands before coming to America, bringing European techniques with him. 
By the 1850s, papermaking in America was reaching a crisis point. America was producing more newspapers than any other country and its paper consumption was equal to England and France’s combined. According to one 1856 estimate, it would take 6,000 wagons, each carrying two tons of paper, to carry all the paper consumed by American newspapers in a single year. This equals out to a need for 405,000,000 pounds of rags for the 800 paper mills then at work in the United States. Most of these rags were imported from Europe, with the largest source being from Italy. By 1854, however, Italy also started exporting rags to England, decreasing the supply available to American paper-makers. This meant that a substitute for or a new supply source of rags needed to be found, and quickly.
Isaiah Deck.
At this same time period, Egyptian mummies were not unknown in America. Many mummies had been part of exhibits and had been shown in museums and traveling shows across the country. In fact, Dr. Pettigrew was the operator of one such show, where he would unwrap or unroll mummies in front of a crowd for their amusement. The impetus for a new supply source of rags for paper may have come from Dr. Isaiah Deck, an Englishman by birth, a New Yorker by residence, a geologist by trade, an archeologist by hobby and a determined explorer. On an earlier copper prospecting trip to Jamaica, Deck had evaluated other sources for paper including aloe, plantain, banana and dagger-grass, but none were acceptable. Thus, already preoccupied with paper and paper sources, Deck set out on a trip to Egypt in 1847 to search for Cleopatra’s lost emerald mines. Deck’s father, also named Isaiah, had known Giovanni Belzoni, a famous Italian robber of Egyptian tombs; Deck the younger thus inherited from his father some Egyptian artifacts, including a piece of linen from a mummy. 
While searching for the lost mines, Deck couldn’t help but notice the plethora of mummies and mummy parts that turned up in communal burial sites called “mummy pits.” He wrote, “So numerous are they in some localities out of the usual beaten tracks of most travelers, that after the periodical storms whole areas may be seen stripped of sand, and leaving fragments and limbs exposed in such plenty and variety.” Deck did some calculations: assume two thousand years of widespread embalming, an average life span of thirty-three years and a stable population of eight million. This would leave you with about five hundred million mummies. Add to that the number of mummified animals including cats, bulls and crocodiles, and the number drastically rises. Deck also states, “it is by no means rare to find above 30 lbs. weight of linen wrappings on mummies…A princess from the late Mr. Pettigrew’s collection was swathed in 40 thicknesses, producing 42 yards of the finest texture.” Deck further calculated that the average consumption of paper in America is about 15 lbs. per person per year. This meant that the supply from Egyptian mummies would be able to keep up with the American demand for about 14 years, by which point a substitute supply source or material would likely have been discovered, rendering the need for rags unnecessary.
Evidence.
Whether or not American paper mills took Isaiah Deck’s proposal seriously cannot be either conclusively proved or rejected. However, some evidence does remain.
Dard Hunter.
Dard Hunter is a well-known paper researcher and cataloguer and a proponent of handmade paper. His book, "Papermaking: The History and Technique of an Ancient Craft", relates the experiments of I. Augustus Stanwood in both ground-wood paper and mummy paper. Hunter received his information from Stanwood’s son Daniel, a professor of international law. According to Daniel, during the American Civil War his father was hard-pressed for materials for his Maine mill. As such, he imported mummies from Egypt, stripped the bodies of their wrappings and used this material for making paper. Several shiploads of mummies were brought to the mill in Gardiner, Maine and were thus used to make a brown wrapping paper for grocers, butchers and other merchants. Professor Stanwood continues on to report that the rags supposedly caused a cholera outbreak among the workers since there were no standards for disinfection at this time. However, since cholera is actually a bacterium, it is unlikely that active disease cells could have survived for centuries in the wrappings, meaning the outbreak at the plant was likely either from poor personal hygiene of the workers or from dirty rags recently imported from deceased Europeans, primarily Frenchmen and Italians, rather than the mummy rags. 
Hunter also writes in an extensive footnote of a letter he received from a Mrs. John Ramsey of Syracuse, New York, relating the story her father’s friend used to tell her of his days in a paper mill in Broadalbin, New York. He worked there from 1855–1860 and was one of the men responsible for unrolling the old linen wrappings from the mummies the mill received. She wrote to Hunter that “the rolled-up vestments retained the shape of the mummy, so that when the workmen tried to straighten or unroll the ‘cocoon’…it sprang back at once into the shape of the mummy it had encased so long.” She also describes the material as cream-coloured linen still bearing fragments of embroidery on the edges.
Hunter also writes about and quotes from Deck’s proposal on the importation of mummies. However, Hunter refers to the work as a manuscript, leaving Joseph Dane to dismiss the work off-hand, stating that the work could not be found and implying that Hunter invented it to suit his purpose. This claim of Dane must also be dismissed, since authors both before and since Dane, including Deck’s contemporaries and modern authors, among which are both Wolfe and Baker, have been able to find copies of this paper. Dane also dismisses Deck’s writing, and therefore Hunter’s, on the basis that it is in the mode of Swiftonian satire. He cites Deck’s references to thrift, concern with alleviating shortages and his precision in his calculations as further evidence of his writing in the manner of Book 3 of "Gulliver’s Travels". Dane also writes that Hunter should have realized that Deck wasn’t serious, thus questioning Hunter’s own authority in the field.
Evidence from periodicals.
It is a verifiable fact that rags from Egypt were imported during this time period. Joel Munsell was a prolific printer and publisher from Albany, New York and he kept a scrapbook of articles relating to his trade. This eventually became the basis for his book "Chronology of the Origin and Progress of Paper and Paper-Making". For an entry from 1855, Munsell records that a cargo of 1215 bales of Egyptian rags arrived and were purchased by J Priestly & Co. for about 4 cents a pound. His source, the "Paper Trade Reporter", stated that the final purchase price for the transaction was $25,000. The next year, the "New York Tribune" wrote that about two and a quarter million pounds of rags have been imported from Egypt. 
Articles discussing the practicality and the financial implications of the import of mummies for paper for the government of Egypt and American paper mills were also published in the 7 July 1847 issue of "The Friend", the 19 June 1847 issue of "Scientific American" and the 17 December 1847 issue of the "Cold War Fountain". While none of these articles confirm the manufacture of said paper in America, they do prove that the concept was both widely spoken of and under discussion in well-known and respected periodicals of the day.
Another article ran in the April 1873 edition of "The Druggists’ Circular and Chemical Gazette" that described an 1866 visit of a New York businessman to Alexandria. There, he purchased and “exported to the United States ‘mummies from the catacombs’ to be converted to pulp for papermaking.” This article also pointed out that mummies weren’t ideal for printing paper due to the various oils and botanicals included in the rags, which lead to the discoloration of the paper. This corroborates Hunter’s report that Stanwood’s mill used the mummies to make a brown butcher paper.
On 31 July 1856, the Syracuse "Standard" ran a notice in its paper that informed readers that it was printed on paper made from rags imported directly from Egypt. The rags were imported by Mr. G.W. Ryan and were processed at his plant in Marcellus Falls. Munsell adds the note that the rags were stripped from mummies. Hunter reports that he is unable to find a copy of this issue, and Dane takes this to mean that the paper didn’t claim to have been printed on mummy paper, but just on rags from the region of mummies. Baker, however, has located a copy of the paper at the Onondaga Historical Association and confirmed both the wording of the notice and the physical difference of this issue from those before it.
Evidence against mummy paper.
Dane argues that mummy paper cannot possibly exist because all the references to the paper are either vaguely documented or are the product of oral history. He also argues that they have an aura of Swift about them and that all the original writers have the intent of satire. Dane also states that neither the copy of the "Standard" on mummy paper can be found, nor can Deck’s article be found, both of which statements have clearly been proven wrong. 
There are indeed some facts that make proving the concrete existence of mummy paper impossible. First off, the paper from the "Standard" and the Norwich broadside cannot be chemically tested to prove they are from mummies, as the test would only prove they are made of linen. Nor can they be carbon-14 dated. This test requires the burning of the material, meaning that items that exist in only one or two copies would have to be destroyed to complete the test, something that clearly cannot be done. Also, mummies were made for over 4,000 years in Egypt, so even a time frame for the paper product wouldn’t narrow down the age of the material to a useful window for solid conclusions to be made. Additionally, the percentage of mummy cloth to any other rag in a given pulp mixture could skew the results of the test. DNA testing would also prove to be inconclusive, as the only thing this test would verify is that the material at one point had close contact with a human.
Outside of scientific tests, there are no extant records of paper mills buying mummies. If there were records or account books, they have either been lost or recycled by the mill itself for more paper. There are no photographs of mummies or mummy wrappings at any paper mills. Shipping records and custom records have likewise vanished. However, these may not have proved anything conclusively either; since rags for paper were duty-free at this time, the cargo wouldn’t have needed to have been declared. Even if the mummy rags had been declared, they probably would have been declared as rags for paper, without the provenance given.
Other industrial uses for mummies.
Perhaps the most famous claimed use of mummies in other industries than papermaking appeared in Mark Twain’s novel "Innocents Abroad". He writes of the practice then current on the Egyptian railroad of using mummies for fuel to power the locomotives.
“I shall not speak of the railway, for it is like any other railway -- I shall only say that the fuel they use for the locomotive is composed of mummies three thousand years old, purchased by the ton or by the graveyard for that purpose, and that sometimes one hears the profane engineer call out pettishly, "D -- n these plebeians, they don't burn worth a cent -- pass out a King …” 
This master story teller was speaking tongue in cheek. He lets the reader in on the joke in the next passage, which reads "Stated to me for a fact. I only tell it as I got it. I am willing to believe it. I can believe any thing." While this use cannot be substantiated with contemporary sources, this story has been mentioned by many reliable secondary sources. An article from the 3 December 1859 issue of "Scientific American" also reports of this unusual fuel source.
There are many sources relating to the use of ground-up mummies in pharmaceuticals. In fact, Merck & Company sold mummy up until 1910. Ground-up mummified bodies also produce a brown pigment, still referred to as “mummy brown” or “Egyptian brown”. The color is no longer produced from mummies. Additional by-products of mummies include the distillation of the bodies to produce aromatic oils, such as olibanum and ambergris, which can be made into machine oils, soaps or even incense for use in the Catholic Church. Clearly, mummies were a multi-product import of choice, much as the buffalo or whale had been before them.

Juanita Harrison

Juanita Harrison (December 28, 1891-?) was an African-American writer known only for her autobiography, "My Great, Wide, Beautiful World" (1936), which narrates her extensive travel abroad. No record exists of her life after the publication of her book. Hence, her date of death cannot be determined.
Biography.
Harrison was born in Mississippi during a time that was racially oppressive for an African-American female. The times were marked by racism, laborious jobs for minorities, and not many opportunities for success. Harrison did not receive much schooling, as told in the preface of her book. Her early years started with “an endless round of cooking, washing, and ironing in an overburdened household,” which was the norm for girls in her situation—young and African American (ix). Her school education ceased when she was about ten years old. There is not much known about her parents and family life other than what is presented in the preface to her autobiography.
Harrison’s physical appearance is also a mystery to the readers. She is spoken of by a former employer’s daughter as having “a slight form, fresh complexion, long hair braided about her head, made her appear younger than her years” (xi). This is the only description given about her looks. Harrison autographed a copy of her book and gave several personal photographs of herself to Mr. and Mrs. Frank Estes, on whose property in Hawaii she lived when she returned from her world travels.
"My Great, Wide, Beautiful World".
Harrison began her travels at the age of 16, traversing the world and exploring 22 countries all by herself. This was quite rare for her time.
Harrison funded her travels by working various jobs such as a nurse, nanny, and cleaning lady, among other trades of sorts. Her initial money came from the investments of a former employer of Los Angeles, California, Mr. George W. Dickinson and Mrs. Myra K. Dickinson. The Dickinsons invested portions of her salary in real estate and gave her the profits. Harrison had long expressed a love of travel and a need to see the world; these kind employers helped her get started. The investments soon yielded $200 in interest per year. Harrison dedicated the book to Myra Dickinson in an act of gratitude. 
Once Harrison was on the road she stayed in YMCAs and was able to learn French and Spanish. These language skills helped her when she visited Spain and France. She often looked up the numbers to the local boarding houses and planned her trips around her lodging accommodations. 
In each country she travels to, Harrison becomes enamored by something exquisite and unique. For example, she remarked about her journeys, “Can’t but help love the last place best” (19). Visiting the Taj Mahal in India was different from the Eiffel Tower in France; Harrison expresses her travels as individual revelations and experiences that could not be duplicated. She said of the Taj Mahal, “It thrilled me through as the beauty cannot be painted…this was built through love, from the love of a man for a woman so it was much nicer” (133). The book reads as numerous journal entries, mistakes included: “just as I have written them misteakes and all. I said that if the mistekes are left out there’ll be only blank” (243). The pure, uncorrected language she uses to record her travels allows the reader to read it as she truly meant it to be conveyed.
She was involved in a train accident while in Czechoslovakia, Twenty-six people were killed and many injured. Harrison was able to turn her most dangerous experience into profit; she asked for compensation of damages for a black eye and received the $200 she asked for. In Turkey she compared the men and evaluated her treatment: 
“He ask another man if I was French and tryed to hold my hand I got angry and Hit Him in the Face and quick as litning He hit me in the Face ... that was my first fight, and the only ungentleman man I have meet in Turkey sorry it happen as I had been thinking all day if I had to give a prize to the most respectfully men it would go to the Turks, the other men felt so sad” (90).
Here she relates her trials with the opposite sex. Her reactions to a man who hit her are quite candid and likely cannot be mistaken for a fabricated story. This incident sheds light on the culture of the men she has just encountered and although shocked, in hindsight she perceives the mishap as a learning experience. Harrison realizes that sometimes women also have to defend themselves physically, not just morally. 
Harrison also experienced some things most black women her age and of her time could not: freedom from racial oppression, lack of border boundaries, and the chance to publish her story. Time has forgotten about "My Great Wide Beautiful World" but her autobiographical travelogue of events received attention when it was published. "Time" magazine wrote an article about her book the year it was published: “Readers of My Great Wide Beautiful World will admire not only Juanita's freedom from economic shackles but her impressionistic spelling, sometimes better than right.” The article highlighted excerpts of the book and examines them positively. Selections of Harrison’s book were also published in the "Atlantic Monthly" in 1935.
Critical reception.
Although Harrison only published one book, she has received some critical attention. The encyclopedia "African American Authors, 1745-1945 A Bio-Bibliographical Critical Sourcebook" edited by Emmanuel S. Nelson includes an entry on Harrison written by Debra J. Rosenthal. According to Barton, Harrison is a woman “who is not concerned about all the whys and wherefores of her past life but who only wants to convey her immediate joys to the readers.” Rosenthal argues that the book concentrates on the “here and now.” For example, Harrison uses the present tense throughout the book in her conversational tone and carefree manner. While in Belgrade, a passing girl carrying food caught Harrison’s attention and she wrote, “where ever you go I'll flower it smelled so good I flowered Her 2 blocks” (88). Although the girl was a stranger to Harrison, the writer did follow the food seller to some extent, demonstrating that the “here and now” could be at anytime and in anyplace for Harrison. This allows, as Barton says, the readers to gather Harrison’s immediate joys, thus sharing in her journeys vicariously.
Juanita Harrison was a woman ahead of her time, traveling alone and not timid about requiring respect for her morals and living conditions. Yet, her book reads as a humble comment on issues still relevant to women today. Rosenthal also mentions that the times Harrison lived in were marred by racism and that she unlike so many others “easily melds into any society and seems to be accepted by all.” Harrison herself says that while “at the Aleppo they thought I was Chinese. Here they think I am Aribian” (65). However, the issue of race is not soon forgotten in times like Jena 6 in Louisiana, U.S.A. which is a more recent example of racial tension. Yet, Harrison leaves all those troubles behind to find herself immersed in the new cultures she so loves. While visiting Madrid, she remarked, “Bull fighting and ice cream are the two best things on earth” (99). As a lone traveler, Harrison had indeed seen many parts of the earth.

Dunbar's Guerillas

Dunbar's Guerrillas was an independent company of Confederate cavalrymen during the American Civil War. They were raised by Captain William Dunbar, who was from Russell County, Kentucky and lived on the Cumberland River.
Dunbar raised men from family and friends in southeastern Kentucky. They rode into Tennessee to fight for the South. Dunbar himself was regularly commissioned in Nashville, as well as his nephew, Lieutenant Silas Dunbar. They joined Nathan Bedford Forrest and served under Colonel Lawton who commanded a battalion of likewise independent companies.
Dunbar's men served at Shiloh and at the raid on Murfreesboro. At Murfreesboro they played a role in freeing the town from the Union occupation. At some point between just before the Kentucky Campaign or just after Dunbar's men disbanded, they were the element of attack that rode through the town to attack the union camps while Forrest sprung the townspeople from the city jail.
After the disbandment.
Many of Dunbar's men stayed with Forrest. Some joined Morgan, a fellow Kentuckian, while others went home or continued as guerrillas in their own personal wars.
Reorganization.
William and Silas Dunbar arranged to gather up parts of the old company along with new recruits to work behind Union lines as partisan rangers along the Cumberland Plateau and in southeastern Kentucky and northeastern Tennessee. They fought in the desperate, bloody, neighbor-against-neighbor fights of the hills, sometimes collaborating with Champ Ferguson and his men. Dunbar's men fought from southwestern Virginia all across the mountains and down into Middle Tennessee. They fought in every battle or skirmish and also bushwhacked many a Federal garrison. Upon hearing that Forrest was coming into Tennessee, they went west and fought alongside him once more. They raised many new recruits from Southern-sympathizing eastern Tennesseans who wanted to break the Union occupation of their state. However, their efforts were futile, and on August 20, 1864 Dunbar's men were ambushed and slaughtered in Greene County, Tennessee. They were coming home from western Tennessee; many of the men had family in that area and they were probably visiting when the ambush came up. William Dunbar was killed in the ambush; the other names of those killed are lost to history.
After the war.
Lt. Silas Dunbar survived the war. He later made his living sharecropping with a comrade named Sabre Wooldridge, a former slave on Alexander Wooldridge's tobacco plantation. Wooldridge was a member of both Dunbar's Guerrilla's and Forrest's Scouts. Sabre had been a faithful servant all through the war for Wooldridge.

Fortunatus of Todi

Saint Fortunatus (died 537) was a 6th-century bishop of Todi. According to tradition, he defended Todi during a Gothic siege. He is the patron saint of Todi. He is praised by Gregory the Great, who calls him a man of great virtue who took great care in attending to the sick. Gregory, who was born around the time that Fortunatus died, was greatly interested in Fortunatus' life. Gregory writes that "a certain poor old man was brought to me –because I always love to talk with such men- of whom I inquired his country, and hearing that he was of the city of Todi, I asked him whether he knew Bishop Fortunatus. He said he knew him very well. 'Then I beseech you,' said I, 'tell me whether you know of any miracles that he did, and, since I am very desirous to know, explained to me what manner of man he was.'"
Veneration.
The church of "San Fortunato" in Todi is dedicated to him and holds his relics. San Fortunato began as a Palaeo-Christian temple (7th century) and in 1292 the construction of a new Gothic edifice was begun by the Franciscans, with a "hall" structure. The crypt houses a sepulchre containing the remains of Fortunatus and other saints, as well as the tomb of Jacopone da Todi.

Edward Worth

Edward Worth (1678–1733) was an Irish politician, physician and book collector. 
He was born into a prosperous Church of Ireland family, his father being Dean of St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin.
Worth studied medicine in Oxford(martriculated 1693), Leiden and Utrecht (MD 1701) before practising as a doctor in Dublin. A financial windfall from an uncle helped him to establish a large book collection, bought from places such as London, the Netherlands, France and Dublin. On his death the collection consisted of some 4,400 books, many on medicine, dating back in some cases to the fifteenth century. The books are now in the library of the old Dr. Steevens's Hospital in Kilmainham, of which he was a governor. They have been stored well and are in remarkably good condition.
Edward Worth was an important figure in the Dublin of his day. He was a friend and contemporary of such people as Jonathan Swift, and his library is remarkable, not only for its size and variety, but also for the condition of the books, some of which are hundreds of years old but appear almost new. Between 1715 and 1727, Worth sat in the Irish House of Commons for New Ross.
He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in January 1699.

Chapel of St. Theresa-the Little Flower

The Chapel of St. Theresa - the Little Flower is a church located at 58 Parsons Street in Detroit, Michigan. It is currently known as St. Patrick Church. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.
History.
St. Patrick Parish began in 1862, in response to the influx of Irish Catholics into Detroit. The parish built a chapel on Adelaide near John R. Street, which was eventually expanded into a church. St. Patrick's became one of Detroit’s largest and wealthiest parishes, although the church was never one of Detroit's largest or most impressive. In 1890, the church was named the cathedral of the diocese and was renamed in honor of "Sts. Peter and Paul" as the prior cathedral church on East Jefferson had been. Bishop Caspar Borgess gave the old Sts. Peter and Paul to the Jesuits in 1877 after he moved to the new cathedral. In 1892, to serve the children of the community, the Sts. Peter and Paul Academy was built on Parsons west of Woodward, which was some distance away from the main church.
By the 1920s, the streets in the area had become so busy that the trek from church to school was considered unsafe for children going to school Masses. As a remedy, the parish constructed the Chapel of St. Theresa, the Little Flower in 1927, naming the chapel after Thérèse de Lisieux. In 1938, the cathedral function was transferred to Blessed Sacrament parish and St. Patrick's reverted to its original name. As the years passed, the area around the original St. Patrick church steadily declined, and more activities were held in the chapel and school. All activities were moved to Parsons Street in the 1980s and the old church was given to a community group. Essentially abandoned for a number of years, it was then vandalized and eventually burned in 1992.
Architecture.
The chapel is in the Romanesque Revival style with a basilica floorplan. It is constructed of red brick with limestone accents and a red tile roof. The entrance is recessed in twin arches framed by square bays. The bays are each topped by a limestone portico consisting of a barrel vault supported by four Corinthian columns. The gabled roofs of the porticoes are covered with red tile matching the other portions of the roof. Above the entry doors on the clerestory level are small arched windows and above the clerestory is a small rose window. Above the porticos are two small campanarios each holding a bell.

St. Xavier's Church, Kottar

St. Xavier Church is a Roman Catholic Latin Rite shrine located at Kottar, Nagercoil in Kanyakumari district of Tamil Nadu state, India. While Saint Xavier was doing missionary work at Kottar and its neighbourhood, he averted an invasion of Padagas with the help of his cross alone and thus protected the people of Venad kingdom from that attack which was appreciated by the king, Unni Kerala Varma, who became closer to the priest and befriended him from then on. In recognition of Xavier’s services, the king allotted him a piece of land to construct a Catholic church, as a gesture of goodwill, as per the church records. There was already a small church, in the same place where St. Xavier’s church stands at present, dedicated to Mary the Mother of God, since AD 1544 . Church records indicate that St. Xavier Church was built in 1600. In 1865, the Shrine of Mary was renovated and enlarged. In 1930, the church was raised to the status of a cathedral. The annual festival is celebrated during November – December, lasting for 10 days.
History.
St.Francis Xavier, a Spanish Jesuit missionary, landed in Goa in May 1542 and he sailed from Goa to Cape Comorin in October 1542 on missionary tour to Travancore Once a great band of dacoits attacked Travancore. Raja`s forces could`t combat the enemy successfully, but Xavier chased away the marauders at Vadasery by raising his Crucifix aloft and shouting at them. Very pleased with Xavier, the Raja showed special regards and gratitudes to him. At Kottar, Xavier had a dwelling house and a small church. Tradition says that the heathens set fire to Xavier`s house and reduced it to ashes, but they were struck with awe when they saw the holy man on his knees devoutly praying, not in the least touched by the flames. To mark the place a cross was put up, to which miraculous powers were attributed. From the time the church was built on the spot, a lamp is kept perpetually burning. Even Hindus go there and make vows and pour oil. Miracles are recorded to have taken place there; and hence multitudes of devout Catholic pilgrims from British India, Ceylon and Malacca resort to the annual festival at St. Xavier`s church, Kottar, about December of every year. Christianity in Travancore was introduced by the disciple of Jesus Christ St.Thomas in 52 AD. 
The primitive or original church which still subsists was built by St. Francis Xavier himself between the years AD 1542 and AD 1550. Afterwards the Bishops of Cochin constructed a new and more spacious church that was richly endowed with precious ornaments and utensils gifted by the Kings of Portugal. The mortal remains of Christian martyr Devasahayam Pillai were given a Christian burial in front of the high altar of St.Xavier`s church at Kottar in January AD 1752. While being one of the oldest churches in the whole of erstwhile Southern Travancore, it is definitely the oldest Cathedral church of Roman Catholic Diocese of Kottar in the present-day`s Kanyakumari district (of Tamil Nadu) since there are three more dioceses got established here later on.

Cricket in Ireland

Cricket is a long-established sport in Ireland. Cricket is governed by Cricket Ireland, which maintains the Ireland cricket team and Ireland women's cricket team. Following the team's success in the 2007 Cricket World Cup, the sport increased its popularity in Ireland. Ireland is an associate member of the International Cricket Council and plays in tournaments like the World Cricket League and ICC Intercontinental Cup, which are qualifying rounds for associate teams for the Cricket World Cup and ICC World Twenty20. Ireland qualified for the 2009 ICC World Twenty20, the 2011 Cricket World Cup and 2010 ICC World Twenty20. In the 2011 World Cup, they beat England in the group matches.
History.
Cricket was introduced to Ireland by the British in the towns of Kilkenny and Ballinasloe in the early 19th century. In the 1830s, the game began to drop down; many of the clubs which were founded in the following 30 years are still in existence today. The first Irish national team played in 1855 against an English national team in Dublin. In the 1850s, the Englishman Charles Lawrence was responsible for developing the game in Ireland through his coaching. In the 1850s and 1860s, Ireland was visited for the first time by touring professional teams. Ireland's first match against Marylebone Cricket Club – the M.C.C. – was in 1858.
The game increased in popularity until the early 1880s. Two issues then effected the popularity of cricket and cricketers in Ireland. The first was the outbreak of the Land Wars resulting from the mistreatment of tenants by absentee landlords when landlord and tenant were alienated. The second was a ban placed on the playing of "foreign" games by the Gaelic Athletic Association, which was not lifted until 1970. Anyone playing foreign games such as cricket would be banned from the extremely popular Irish games of hurling and Gaelic football as it was popularly referred to as a 'garrison game' enjoyed primarily by the occupying British forces and the landowning protestant oligarchy they
protected. Irish teams toured Canada and the USA in 1879, 1888, 1892, and 1909. On top of this, Ireland defeated a touring South African side in 1904. Their first match with first-class status was played on 19 May 1902 against a London County side including W.G. Grace. The Irish, captained by Sir Tim O'Brien, lost convincingly by 238 runs.
The 2005 ICC Trophy was hosted by Ireland.
After Ireland's successes at the 2007 World Cup, cricket experienced a popularity boom in Ireland, with participation reaching record levels.
Governing body.
The Irish Cricket Union (ICU) – the governing body of Irish cricket – was officially founded in 1923, although its predecessor had been active since 1890. In 2007, it announced major changes in order to bring it in-line with the main cricket governing bodies. After the World Cup, Irish cricket experienced a dip in success with poor results in the 2007 Friends Provident Trophy as many players were unavailable. The Irish cricket team was – and still is – an amateur side and most of the players had full-time jobs with commitments conflicting with cricket. After the World Cup there were delays in paying the players which resulted in them ignoring the press in protest to their treatment after an Intercontinental Cup match against Kenya.
Warren Deutrom, the chief executive of the ICU, has stated that it wants to "seek actively to place Irish players into top-level cricket, by developing relationships with county cricket which will incorporate appropriate player release for Irish international duty, and feeder systems for developing Irish cricketers". The reorganised ICU's sought to make closer links with the English counties, encourage the development of age group cricket, and to introduce a professional element into the Irish game. They also want to take the Irish cricket team on winter tours more often. In an attempt to prevent the game losing players to counties or other commitments such as jobs, it was suggested that central contracts should be introduced, however this never came to fruition.
English county competition.
Ireland, along with Scotland, has at times played in competitions for English county cricket sides, including the Benson & Hedges Cup and the Friends Provident Trophy (previously the C&G Trophy). Since there is no nationality restriction in county cricket, non-Irish players have competed for Ireland in these matches. For example Hansie Cronje of South Africa competed for Ireland in the 1997 Benson & Hedges Cup, and more recently New Zealander Jesse Ryder played for Ireland in 2007. In 2004 Ireland beat Surrey by five wickets in the C&G Trophy.
For the 2006 season, the C&G Trophy was reorganised to include a round-robin stage instead of being entirely knock-out. Whereas Ireland had only one match guaranteed in the tournament before, they now had more fixtures against English county sides. For the 2006 tournament, they were bolstered by the signings of Saqlain Mushtaq and Shahid Afridi, the two overseas players they were allowed when competing in English domestic competitions. Ireland recorded one win in their nine matches. Their victory was over Gloucestershire on 30 April by 47 runs.
The C&G Trophy changed its name to Friends Provident Trophy for the 2007 season. In 2007, Ireland played in the Friends Provident Trophy against nine English county sides. Of those nine matches, they lost six and the remaining three matches were abandoned due to rain. They finished bottom in the South Conference of the trophy. For the 2008 season, the round-robin section of the trophy was changed from two divisions to three; Ireland were in the newly formed Midlands Division. In 2008, Ireland played eight games in the Midlands Division, winning one match with one no result and six losses. They finished fifth in the division which had five teams. Ireland's four wicket victory over Warwickshire on 16 May was Ireland's first win in the competition against a county side for two years. Captain William Porterfield anchored the innings with 69 runs.
National team.
The Ireland cricket team is the cricket team representing all Ireland (i.e. both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland).
Dublin-born batsman Ed Joyce has played with some success as part of Ireland's ICC Trophy team and is now a key member of the Sussex side in England's County Championship; he also previously captained Middlesex in the 2004 season. He has also played for England. Talented batsman Eoin Morgan who earlier represented Ireland in tournaments including the ICC World Cup and the ICC World Twenty20 qualified and now plays for England, making no secret of his desire to play Test cricket.
Domestic cricket.
Interprovincial cricket.
The 'Interpros' were introduced for the first time in 2013 as part of Cricket Ireland's strategy to attain Test status by 2020. It will feature teams from Leinster, The North and The North West. Munster were not included in the inaugural season as they will need to continue to focus on expanding their club system and developing their talent pool.
First Class.
The First Class competition is called the Interprovincial Championship. It does not yet have First Class status, but has all the groundwork for elevation to such status once Ireland become a Full Member.
List A.
The one-day competition is called the Interprovincial One-Day Trophy. It does not yet have List A status, but has all the groundwork for elevation to such status once Ireland become a Full Member.
Twenty20.
The Twenty20 competition is called the Interprovincial Twenty20 Cup. Once again, it does not yet have Twenty20 status, but has all the groundwork for elevation to such status once Ireland become a Full Member.
Contracts and Eligibility.
In a Cricket Ireland press release, Richard Holsworth explained the process for the provinces to award contracts for the Interpros. He said that each team would be allowed to award sixteen contracts. These contracts would not involve regular salaries for reasons of budget, but they would include match fees and help with expenses such as travel and gym memberships.
To be eligible for a contract, a player must either be an Irish national or play for an Irish club in one of the five cricketing provinces. Holsworth said that the Interpros should provide a direct pathway into the Ireland side, but that retired internationals like Nigel Jones and Albert van der Merwe would still be eligible. Teams are allowed to play up to two non-Irish nationals in the Championship matches.
Each province would first have the opportunity to sign players from their own province, such as a Leinster-based player playing for Leinster, but players would also be able to play for non-local provinces if they preferred. He also said that provinces would be allowed to bring in players from outside their squads who are excelling in club cricket.
Club cricket.
Club cricket is organised on a provincial basis, with each of four provinces - Leinster, Munster, Northern and North West - organising its own senior leagues and cups. Since 1982, the Irish Cricket Union has organised the Irish Senior Cup on an all-Ireland basis. More recently, the Interprovincial Series has been started as a prelude to a first-class cricket structure.
International Cricket Ground.
There are international cricket venue in Ireland which are cleared by International cricket Council.

St. Mary's Catholic Church (Indianapolis, Indiana)

St. Mary's Catholic Church is a Roman Catholic church in Indianapolis, Indiana. It is built in the Gothic Revival style modeled after the Cologne Cathedral in Germany. The church is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The church was established in 1858 as St. Marienkirche to serve the growing population of German Catholics who were making their home in Indianapolis.
History.
The Reverend Peter Leonard Brandt arrived from Vincennes, Indiana, in 1856 to establish a congregation among the German Catholics of Indianapolis. The congregation completed St. Mary's, their first church, in 1858. Priests conducted services in Latin and sermons in German and retained Old World traditions. After the neighborhood become commercial, the congregation purchased property at New Jersey Street and Vermont Street. There they built the present church, under construction from 1910 to 1912. Architect Hermann Gaul, a native of Cologne, Germany, designed the church. The design Gaul used for St. Marienkirche took its inspiration from Cologne Cathedral.
Architecture.
Gargoyles decorate the façade of the church at the entry portal and towers. On the north side, a stained-glass window depicts St. Boniface, the saint who converted the Germans to Christianity. On the south side, another window depicts St. Henry, the “church builder.” The interior has many statues and an apse with skylights.

Saints Peter and Paul Academy

Sts. Peter and Paul Academy is a Catholic school building located at 64 Parsons Street in Detroit, Michigan. It currently serves as the St. Patrick Senior Center. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.
History.
St. Patrick Parish began in 1862, in response to the influx of Irish Catholics into Detroit. By 1880, St. Patrick had become one of Detroit’s largest and wealthiest parishes, and in 1890 the parish name was changed to "Sts. Peter and Paul." In 1892, to serve the children of the community, a school was built on Parsons.
From the time it opened in 1893 until 1969, the school functioned as a co-ed grade school and a high school for girls. The parish resumed its original name of St. Patrick in 1938, and the high school was renamed "Immaculata High School". The high school was soon renamed again as "Girls’ Catholic Central High School", and the grade school was renamed "St. Patrick’s Grade School"; both names stuck until the school was closed in 1969.
After the closing, the school was vacant for three years, until re-opening as the "St. Patrick Senior Center." The organization has continued to the present day, providing hot meals, health care, transportation assistance, and educational classes for the elderly, in association with the next-door St. Patrick Church.

<doc id="18228264" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18228264" title="Automatic Loveletter">
Automatic Loveletter

Automatic Loveletter was an American rock band band formed in Tampa, Florida, in 2007. The band consisted of vocalist and guitarist Juliet Simms, her older brother and lead guitarist Tommy Simms, and drummer Daniel Currier.
History.
Automatic Loveletter was formed with Juliet Simms on guitar and lead vocals, Daniel Currier on drums and brother Tommy Simms playing bass and producing, with bassist Sean Noll sitting in on occasion in Tommy's home studio in the Tampa Bay area. The band was first called Stars and Scars and recorded its first rock song together in December 2005, naming the song after the band but written by lead singer Juliet Simms. They also recorded "Tin Lizzy", written by Tommy.
Juliet also finally acoustically laid down all of the songs she had been writing over the last three years for consideration for her first major label album. Signed by Allison Hagendorf now host of Fuse TVs "The Pop tv Show", then working at Epic Records, Juliet went on to form Automatic Loveletter while Epic struggled with the Sony BMG 2005 Payola Scandal and internal problems finally dropping over 70 bands in 2007. With Allison as Juliet's champion, Automatic Loveletter was not dropped but was also not supported for the next year and 1/2 touring in the drummer's Ford Excursion and burning their own yolo copies of their Epic-produced CD with hand painted slip covers to help fund their tours.
Automatic Loveletter recorded their never-released debut EP in 2007 with producer Matt Squire (Panic! at the Disco, Boys Like Girls, All Time Low, Cute is What We Aim For, The Cab, and The Maine). "He challenged me and I challenged him," Simms said. "I felt very comfortable and that's when the best of me comes out. The entire time was playful and fun and that's what rock n' roll's about to me -- having a good time." Simms took her massive songbook to Squire and narrowed down the right tunes and crafted them to fit together, sometimes taking songs in entirely new directions. "The Answer", for instance, was originally a ballad, but became one of the more upbeat numbers on the album. Daniel Currier and lead guitarist Joe Nelson both played on the album, Sean Noll officially joining just before some of their first tours together and big brother Tommy occasionally touring with the band to play lead, or rhythm guitar in larger venues and outdoor concerts filling up the sound and the stage. The band played both the main Bamboozle and Bamboozle Left in 2008.
The tracks "The Answer", "Parker", "August 28Th 3:30 A.M.", "Hush" and "Make-up Smeared Eyes (Acoustic)" were all released on their first official release "Recover"
But after the tour when Epic was scheduled to release the album Automatic Loveletter (acronym A.LL.) were told to continue touring and asked by then President Charlie Walk to write more upbeat music. Instead, Juliet submitted a fan favorite "Black Ink Revenge" which was rejected several times for re-write until it became "My Goodbye" one of the tracks off the upcoming Sony release. "I had been signed to Epic for going on three years, toured in cars with my completely broke band and was feeling like I disappointed my fans who had been promised music for over a year so I sat in my room for four days re-writing and re-submitting that song like 5xs. I like "My Goodbye" a LOT but it was the result of a lot of pressure and the desire to get an album released." "My Goodbye", "The Day that Saved Us" and "Hush (New Version)" were quickly released as another self-titled EP just before the final chapter with Epic Records when they fired all the members except Currier before the first headlining tour. Epic held auditions for new members, hired Jacob Fatoroochi, James Bowen and Wayne Miller then half way through the tour called Juliet and told her that all of the pay for the band she was on tour with was being withdrawn and the band was dropped. Despite this devastating setback the new hired guys pulled together and stayed on to complete the tour, and A.LL.went on to sell out venues like the Knitting Factory in LA and San Francisco. "It was very liberating. After crying my eyes out for a couple hours I had some of my best shows ever on that tour." Almost immediately the band was picked up by Sony and Juliet asked to write for a new album produced by Josh Abraham.
In 2011 they released an entirely acoustic album through Paper + Plastick Records.
In 2012 Juliet Simms pursued a solo carerr and was a contestant on NBC's "The Voice".
