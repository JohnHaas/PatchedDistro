Steve Croudson

Steven David "Steve" Croudson (born 24 November 1980 in Grimsby) is an English former professional footballer, goalkeeping coach and kitman for Conference National side Grimsby Town.
He played as a goalkeeper initially from 1998 to 2007, but later came out of retirement between 2010 and 2013. He initially played for his home town club Grimsby Town between 1998 and 2003. He retired from injury at the age of 26 and returned to Grimsby to serve as the clubs Goalkeeping Coach. On 30 August 2010 he registered as a player again for Grimsby due to the injuries of the club's first and second choice keepers.
During his playing career he also played with Scunthorpe United, Boston United, Stevenage Borough, Halifax Town, Kettering Town, Bangor City, Rhyl and Cammell Laird.
Playing career.
Grimsby Town.
Croudson came through the ranks at his home town club of Grimsby Town and was added to the first team squad during the 1998–1999 season as the clubs third choice keeper behind Aidan Davison and Andy Love . During May 1999, injury put both Davison and Love on the sidelines and Croudson was handed his professional debut by Alan Buckley. The match was against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 4 May 1999 in the First Division. In an impressive performance, Croudson managed to pull off some fine saves and the game was drawn 0–0 with Croudson being awarded man of the match. 5 days later he played again in the clubs 1–0 defeat away against Watford.
During the 1999–2000 campaign Grimsby manager Alan Buckley made Croudson his second choice keeper and this would eventually see him firmly cement his place behind Town's new number one Danny Coyne. Incidentally Croudson's step up in ranks would eventually go on to see Andy Love depart for Blundell Park for Ilkeston Town midway through the season. Croudson went on to make 5 appearances in League and Cup that season. The 2000–2001 season came round and new manager Lennie Lawrence although initially favouring Croudson as his back up keeper briefly replaced him with loanee Danish keeper Morten Hyldgaard. Croudson would play no part in that particular season.
In the 2001–2002 campaign Croudson was made available for loan and was originally a target for Buckley's new team Lincoln City, however Croudson made a move to Grimsby's local rivals Scunthorpe United who were managed by former Town boss Brian Laws. He signed for the Glanford Park club in August 2001 and after a month with The Iron where he played in 4 games he returned to Grimsby to fight for his place in the team. Grimsby however now had four keepers under contract, Coyne, Croudson and newcomers Ronald Ermes and Morgan Cranley. Croudson made 1 appearance that season, and this would be his last showing for The Mariners in his first spell with the club.
A management change at Grimsby again saw club captain Paul Groves step up to take over, and despite Croudson being the original choice for second choice keeper during the 2002–2003 season he would suffer an shoulder injury that ruled him out of the entire season, forcing Groves to sign Leeds United's Shaun Allaway on a season long loan to fill in on the bench. At the end of the season both Croudson and his goalkeeping companion Danny Coyne both left Grimsby, with Coyne joining Premier League Leicester City. Croudson played in 6 league matches for Grimsby in his five-year stay.
Boston United.
Croudson would remain in the county of Lincolnshire and signed up with Third Division outfit Boston United. Steve would play second fiddle and understudy to Paul Bastock for the entire 2003–2004 season, and by the end of the season after failing to make a single appearance United boss Steve Evans deciding against extending his one year contract and he was released. Despite holding down a place on the bench, Croudson was deemed surplus to requirements and left the club in the summer of 2004.
Stevenage Borough.
In the summer of 2004, Croudson returned to Grimsby to train with the club, who were now under the management of Russell Slade. He would provide cover for Town's new number 1 Anthony Williams as he was named as a substitute for the Town's pre-season friendlies against Gainsborough Trinity and Scarborough. Despite this he failed to make an appearance in either game and failed to earn a contract with The Mariners, with Slade mentioning that the Croudson had only been with the club for a few weeks to keep his fitness levels up. Soon followed a move to Conference National side Stevenage Borough for the 2004–2005 season. Steve would make two appearances for Borough, a 3–1 Football League Trophy defeat at the hands of Barnet and a 2–0 home defeat in the league against Woking. Steve left Borough in the January 2005 transfer window.
Later career.
Two months went by and he then signed for Halifax Town in March 2003 but after a month as number 2 keeper to Ian Dunbavin at The Shay, he was released by manager Chris Wilder. With injury problems still surrounding the player he moved to sign for Kettering Town who were managed by former England international Paul Gascoigne. Steve would remain with Kettering for the entire 2005–2006 season.
In July 2006, he moved to Wales and signed for Bangor City briefly in 2006. Soon followed a move to fellow Welsh side Rhyl where he also briefy played. He then returned to England with Non League Unibond Division One side Cammell Laird but Steve opted to retire due to injury in 2007.
Coaching career.
Grimsby Town.
Croudson retired in 2007 through ongoing injury woes aged only 26. He returned home to Grimsby and was appointed part-time Goalkeeping coach at Grimsby Town during the 2007–2008 season by Alan Buckley, who was now in his third spell with the club. On 9 July 2010 Croudson played the second half of Grimsby's 1–0 pre-season friendly victory over Non League side Brigg Town. On 30 August 2010 due to injuries to Grimsby keepers Kenny Arthur and Nick Colgan, Croudson was considered to be in contention to make a shock return to the sport to play against Histon in Town's Conference National fixture. Manager Neil Woods eventually confirmed he would play Croudson chosen over youth team keeper Rob Peet and Steve made his first appearance for his home town club since playing in a 2–0 defeat at home to Rotherham United on 5 October 2001. The last time Steve had pulled his gloves on for Grimsby the club had been three division's higher than there current place inside the Conference. In a solid display, reminiscent of his professional debut for Town 11 years previously Steve pulled off some fine saves and Grimsby were victorious to the scoreline of 2–1 against Histon and was named the man of the match. On 23 October 2010 Croudson played once again in Grimsby's FA Cup tie with Tamworth following Sheffield Wednesday's decision not to let the Mariners use loanee Richard O'Donnell in a cup fixture.
Following his performances during the 10–11 season Croudson picked up four minor awards at the clubs annual player of the year award ceremony. He made more first team appearances for Grimsby during the 2010–11 season in his coaching capacity then he did in his five seasons with the club while a player. In the summer of 2011 Grimsby brought in James McKeown as a back up keeper to Kenny Arthur to ease the dependency on Croudson. He didn't appear on a team sheet again until February 2012 when he was named as a substitute for the FA Trophy match at home to York City.
On 8 November 2011 Croudson mixed his coaching and playing duties with being appointed as the clubs kitman replacing Mike Bielby who had been at the club since the early nineties.

Pacific Arts Corporation

The Pacific Arts Corporation, Inc. is a company formed by Michael Nesmith circa 1974 to manage and develop media projects, including the medium and the content. The company is associated with a "drawing" dove logo.
History.
Pacific Arts Corporation, Inc. began as Pacific Arts Productions, Inc when incorporated on October 18, 1974 as a California corporation by Michael Nesmith (incorporated by Nesmith's accountant, Howard Leitner of Leitner, Zander, Sniderman & Co., Los Angeles). The first product released under Pacific Arts Productions was under the subsidy of the Pacific Arts Records label in September 1974 of Nesmith's own concept album, "The Prison". 
Between 1974 and 1981, Pacific Arts Productions created a large library of various musical artists and built its own independent record distribution system. Nesmith considered Pacific Arts an umbrella corporation over two major divisions, TV and records. It was during this time that Nesmith began to develop music videos, produce "PopClips" (the predecessor for MTV), and ideas for a non-theatrical home video business. 
In 1981, Pacific Arts Productions, Inc. changed its name to The Pacific Arts Corporation, Inc. (PAC) PAC was then structured to oversee various anticipated subsidiaries for managing different types of media which included Pacific Arts Records. There have been several Pacific Arts subsidiaries over the years, including, but not limited to, Pacific Arts Productions, Inc., Pacific Arts Pictures (merged out), Pacific Arts Publishing (merged out), and Pacific Arts Audio Inc. (dissolved). 
Following the creation of PAC in 1981, Pacific Arts Video (a subsidiary of PAC) released the home video "Elephant Parts", a long-form video featuring various comedy skits and music videos. "Elephant Parts" was an early home video available to consumers and would win the first Grammy Award for a music video.
In 1992, Pacific Arts began releasing promotional material on the then-upcoming video, "Michael Nesmith Live at the Britt Festival". With the release, Nesmith alludes to the growing number of subsidiaries, listing the distribution of the video as a Pacific Arts subsidiary named "One of the Nesmith Enterprises". On the release of Nesmith's album "The Garden" in 1994, he introduced his current record company, Rio Records. PAC is presently the managing partner of Videoranch, LLC which was established in 2007 as a Delaware LLC. Videoranch LLC is the operating entity for Videoranch.com and Videoranch3d.com.
Movie production.
Following the success of "Elephant Parts", Pacific Arts focused its attention on producing full-length motion pictures. Pacific Arts first major motion picture produced was the 1984 film, "". Also released that year was the 1984 film "Repo Man", for Michael Nesmith served as executive producer under the (still active) subsidy, Zoomo Productions, Inc.
The last major motion picture Pacific Arts produced was the 1988 film "Tapeheads". Following the release of "Tapeheads", Pacific Arts would turn its attention to home video and the internet.
Video distribution.
Throughout the 1980s, Pacific Arts had acquired (at the time) the largest catalog of non-theatrical video titles in the world and set up its own independent distribution system.
PAC/PBS lawsuit.
In 1990, Pacific Arts secured a contract with PBS to distribute the Pacific Arts video catalog under the PBS logo. However, in the early 1990s, Pacific Arts and PBS went through a series of serious disagreements. Lawsuits were filed: by Nesmith and Pacific Arts against PBS for breach of contract, intentional misrepresentation (fraud), intentional concealment (fraud), negligent misrepresentation, and interference with contract; and by PBS against Nesmith and Pacific Arts for lost royalties. The lawsuits escalated in 1994 and 1995 into major litigation between the parties over these rights and payments. PBS and Nesmith and Pacific Arts vigorously prosecuted these multi-million dollar counter-suits. 
The six plaintiffs included PBS, including WGBH in Boston; WNET in New York; American Documentaries and Radio Pioneers Film Project (production companies owned by producer Ken Burns); and the Children's Television Workshop. They sought approximately $5 million in disputed royalties, advances, guarantees and license fees for programs and the use of the PBS logo from the defendants Pacific Arts and Nesmith. 
Due to the cost of the litigation, Pacific Arts was forced to cease distribution operations, and suspended the use of the PBS logo on the Pacific Arts videos. Though Pacific Arts distribution system had ceased operating, the various plaintiffs were counting on capturing a personal financial guarantee Nesmith had made to PBS in the original PBS deal in 1990.
The cases went to jury trial in Federal Court in Los Angeles in February 1999. 
By the end of the trial, the judge and jury were leaning toward Nesmith's (Pacific Arts) counterclaims. Henry Gradstein, lead attorney for Nesmith, contended in a brief that the company's video rights were worth enough for it to have paid off any proper debts to the producers. But, he said, PBS had concocted a "dastardly scheme, which was played out with military precision, to strip Pacific Arts of its assets by inducing Pacific Arts not to file bankruptcy, by lulling it into a sense of security while it organized a mass termination of Pacific Arts' licenses." 
After three days of deliberation, the nine-person jury unanimously agreed with Gradstein and found PBS liable for breach of contract, intentional misrepresentation (fraud), intentional concealment (fraud), negligent misrepresentation, and interference with contract. The court awarded Pacific Arts $14,625,000 for loss of its rights library, plus $29,250,000 in punitive damages. The jury awarded $3 million to Nesmith personally, including $2 million in punitive damages for a total award to Nesmith and Pacific Arts of $48,875,000. The jury resolved the outstanding license fee issues by ordering Pacific Arts and Nesmith to pay approximately $1.2 million to American Documentaries for "The Civil War", about $230,000 to WGBH, and $150,000 to WNET.
The decision never went to an appeals court and the final amount paid to Pacific Arts and Nesmith was an undisclosed sum agreed to in an out of court settlement.
After the judgment against PBS, Nesmith told "Entertainment Weekly", "I may not get back in business at all. If you can't trust PBS, who can you trust?"
Videoranch and Videoranch3D.
In 1995, Pacific Arts opened Videoranch, which hosted several multimedia projects, including video and audio clips from various albums and video productions it owned or licensed. In 1998, Videoranch began the second-phase of multimedia via the internet by launching Videoranch 3D (VR3D), a 3-D virtual world as a test bed for technologies which could deliver live content into virtual environments. VR3D is a virtual world that is presently the most active of the Pacific Arts enterprises. 
In 2004, Nesmith developed a process for seamlessly embedding live video in virtual worlds and a companion production technique that allowed live performers to interact in real time with a virtual audience. Nesmith has two patents pending for these processes which were filed in 2007 . 
Videoranch3D began a series of trial productions in 2006 which consisted mostly of live music concerts. In addition there have been and are ongoing seminars, book signings and professional musician clinics. 
Pacific Arts has produced hundreds of live performances in the virtual world of Videoranch3D, including shows with Nesmith performing
Publishing.
To continue developing the multimedia platform, Pacific Arts published the audio book of Nesmith's first novel, "The Long Sandy Hair of Neftoon Zamora". The book was published and distributed by St. Martin's Press. The unabridged reading of the novel was released on a six-CD set by Pacific Arts and was sublicensed for direct download to Audible.com. 
In June 2009, Pacific Arts began a serialized release of Nesmith's second novel, "The America Gene". A free sample and the first chapter were released for preview and a purchased download, respectively. Plans call for the release of one chapter of the book online per week for sixteen weeks. After its release Nesmith holds a "live reading" of each chapter of the book in the Videoranch3D virtual world.
In June 2009, Videoranch began selling a serialized version of Nesmith's novel, "The America Gene", beginning one chapter at a time. The 16-chapter novel has been released in its entirety and is available for purchase at the Videoranch online store. Unlike the Pacific Arts release of Nesmith's first book, "The Long Sandy Hair of Neftoon Zamora", which was released as a printed novel, "The America Gene" is only available electronically.
Recent history.
Re-releases of the Michael Nesmith Pacific Arts' catalog (both music and videos) for UK and Europe were licensed to Demon Music Group.
In January 2007 Pacific Arts built a special production stage in Sand City California for producing live performances and delivering them into virtual worlds. The live performances are delivered over the internet and seamlessly embedded into a fully multiplexed 3D environment. The first of these environments is Videoranch3D. 
In February, 2009, Videoranch released a 6-minute song entitled "Helen's Eternal Birthday". The single track was released exclusively through Videoranch as a test of its download sales. Following the test, the Videoranch download sales site was made operational with most of the Videoranch software catalog available for purchase and download delivery. In 2010, a first revision to "Helen’s Eternal Birthday" resulted in it being re-titled as "January." Nesmith has suggested that he will continue to release songs on the Videoranch website in various states of completion while updating those songs as he feels compelled, thus making the listener a part of each musical journey. This sense of audience inclusion in an entertainment enterprise is a recurring theme in Nesmith’s current career phase, the roots of which may be found in “” in which the audience reads a companion book while listening to the album to provide a unique listening experience for each audience member.

Blencogo

Blencogo is a small farming village in Cumbria, England, UK, near Wigton on the Solway plain, in the Allerdale Borough Council area, off the B3502 Wigton to Silloth road. The village is a centre for the growing of osier willow for basketmaking and related crafts.
Etymology.
Armstrong, et al. cite Ekwall, 
who "derives this name from Welsh 'blaen' 'top'...and 'cog' 'cuckoo' to which was later added ON 'haugr' 'hill' ". However, they say that it is more probable that the final element "is the British plural inflexion (Welsh '-au', Cornish '-ow', Breton '-ou')."
History.
Blencogo first appears in literature around 1100 CE when the Lord Waltheof of Allerdale gives the barony of Blencogo to Odard de Logis. Numerous land transfers are made to Holme Cultram Abbey in over the next 150 years. Land transfers and grants for Blencogo also appear in the patent and charter rolls for Edward III (1342), Richard II (1388), Henry IV (1399), Henry VI (1426), Edward IV (1474), and Henry VII (1543).

John Emlyn-Jones

John Emlyn Emlyn-Jones (22 January 1889 – 3 March 1952) was a Welsh Liberal Party politician and shipowner.
Education and shipping.
Emlyn-Jones had a private education in Cardiff, France, Spain and Italy before making his reputation in the shipping industry. In 1911 he went into partnership with E. Williams as shipowners. In 1915 he started on his own with a fleet of small coasting steamers using the experience he had gained while working in a shipping office in Bordeaux. In 1920 he founded the Dragon Steam Ship Company to operate deep sea tramping routes. The affairs of his own enterprises took him all over the world on business and he was also a director of the Green Star Shipping Co, the Ocean Salvage and Towage Co and one time Chairman of the Cardiff Pilotage Authority. 
In addition, Emlyn-Jones was one time President of Cardiff Chamber of Commerce and was elected Chairman of the Cardiff and Bristol Channel Shipowners’ Association in 1931.
Politics.
Emlyn-Jones held many offices in the Liberal Party including being Chairman of the Liberal Federation of Wales and President of the North Dorset Liberal Association. 
At the 1922 general election, Emlyn-Jones was elected to Parliament for the constituency of Dorset North and he retained the seat in 1923. In a predominantly rural constituency, one of Emlyn-Jones’ concerns was to represent the interests of agricultural workers. During the first Labour government, Emlyn-Jones pointed out how Labour, supported by the Conservative opposition, was not standing up robustly enough for agricultural labourers by refusing to incorporate this group into a Minimum Wages Bill, which he attempted unsuccessfully to amend. However in the 1924 general election it was the Conservatives under Stanley Baldwin, who were mostly credibly able to make a national appeal to farm workers as the champions of rural England and Emlyn-Jones lost his seat to Conservative candidate, Cecil Hanbury.
Out of Parliament.
Emlyn-Jones did not seek reselection for the Liberals at the 1929 general election. Instead he was adopted as candidate for Cardiff East being well known as a business man at the docks and as a resident of the constituency. He was reported as being a capable speaker and enthusiastic for the Liberal unemployment scheme which formed a central policy theme of the Liberal election campaign. In 1928 the party had produced a book entitled "We Can Conquer Unemployment" and promoted the policy vigorously even claiming that ‘within twelve months a Liberal government taking office unemployment would be brought down to normal proportions’.
Emlyn-Jones fought Cardiff East again in 1931, stating he was both a supporter of the National Government and a follower of Sir Herbert Samuel. He accepted Ramsay Macdonald’s manifesto in its entirety, stating that there must be national unity at a time of national emergency. He indicated he was willing to stand aside to avoid splitting the National vote, if the local Liberal and Conservative Associations decided jointly not to adopt him as the National candidate. But the Conservatives had already adopted South Wales barrister Owen Temple Morris and no accommodation between the parties can have been forthcoming as both Emlyn-Jones and Temple Morris contested the election with Temple Morris emerging the victor. Emlyn-Jones did not stand again at Cardiff in 1935, which was probably just as well as the Liberal candidate, A Pile, lost his deposit. However he was persuaded to contest the seat again at the 1945 general election, when he came third. Emlyn –Jones also served as a Justice of the Peace in Cardiff.
Instead he contested the 
1935 as Liberal candidate at Flintshire, a seat that the party was defending. In a three-cornered contest, he came second as the Conservative gained the seat. In June 1936 he was elected to serve on the Liberal Party Council.
Like father like son.
Emlyn-Jones was married and had one daughter Inez (b. 1916) and one son, John Alun Emlyn-Jones (b. 1923) who was also a Liberal. He fought the seat of Barry just outside Cardiff in the 1950 general election. He also stood as Liberal candidate in the by-election at his father’s old seat of Dorset North in 1957 in a closer contest, coming second to the Tory, losing by 3,102 votes.
Death.
Emlyn-Jones and his wife were victims of an air crash. They had boarded the Air France flight bound for Paris from Nice on the morning of 3 March 1952 but the aircraft got into trouble soon after take-off and tried to return to the airfield. It crashed into trees on hills outside Nice and burst into flames, killing 38 passengers and crew members.

The Tradition Masters

The Tradition Masters is an album by American folk singer Odetta, released in 2002.
The title refers to the label for whom Odetta recorded her first two solo releases. The songs she recorded during that time period have received multiple releases in various configurations. This two-disc compilation re-issues both "Odetta Sings Ballads and Blues" and "At the Gate of Horn".
The early Everest LP compilation (1963) of the Tradition recordings, "Odetta", used tracks from both albums as well as "The Tin Angel". Another compilation, "Absolutely the Best", focuses on the same master tapes, but does not include both complete albums. "" uses tracks from the same two albums, including 18 tracks compared to this set's thirty-one.

Media in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario

This is a list of media in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. For stations licensed to Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, see that city's article. 
Radio.
The first radio station in Sault Ste. Marie was CJIC which signed on in 1934. It became CFYN in 1977 when the assets of the station were sold to Gilder Broadcasting. CKCY became the Canadian Sault's second radio station, signing on in 1955. Both stations were shut down in 1992 as part of one of Canada's first local management agreements, entered into by Pelmorex Radio Network, the managing partner in this case, and Telemedia.
Television.
Sault Ste. Marie is home to one television station which is locally licensed, CHBX-TV. However, that station effectively acts as a satellite of Sudbury's CICI-TV as part of the CTV Northern Ontario system — the station's only direct local production is a brief local news insert which airs as part of regional newscasts produced at the Sudbury station. The city formerly also had its own CBC Television affiliate, CJIC-TV. However, that station was acquired directly by the CBC in 2002, and became a straight analogue rebroadcaster of CBLT-DT from Toronto; the repeater would close down on July 31, 2012, due to budget cuts.
Sault Ste. Marie is not designated as a mandatory market for digital television conversion. Currently, all Canadian transmitters serving Sault Ste. Marie are analogue only.
Cable.
The cable provider in Sault Ste. Marie is Shaw Cable, who broadcast a local Shaw TV channel on basic cable packages in the area, featuring local programming, news reports, city council meetings, and many live Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds games.
Sault Ste. Marie also receives several American network affiliates over the air from the neighbouring city of Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. All of the Michigan signals are rebroadcasters of downstate stations from Traverse City or Cadillac. However, due to concerns from CTV over coverage, Shaw Cable no longer carries any of the local American network feeds, opting instead for satellite delivery (via Shaw Broadcast Services) of network affiliates from Detroit and Rochester. Prior to the early 2000s, Shaw carried local channels WWUP (CBS) and WTOM (NBC), with ABC programs fed from Flint (WJRT-TV) and PBS programming from Marquette (WNMU).
Print and web media.
Other media include the daily "Sault Star" and weekly "Sault This Week". Online news sites such as "SooToday.com", "Local2.ca" and "SaultSports.com" have emerged in recent years, due in large part to news cutbacks at the "Sault Star."

Triumph Speed Twin

The Speed Twin 5T is a motorcycle that was made by Triumph at their Coventry factory. Edward Turner, Triumph’s Chief Designer and Managing Director, launched the Triumph Speed Twin at the 1937 National Motorcycle Show. It was a 500 cc OHV vertical twin in a lightweight frame and the first truly successful British twin, setting the standard for many twins to follow. After World War II the Speed Twin was responsible for the survival of Triumph - and every major British marque offered a 500 cc twin designed on similar lines to the Speed Twin. 
History.
Edward Turner’s Triumph twin was a major turning point for the British motorcycle industry, as although a 500 cc parallel twin of medium capacity was not revolutionary, the 5T Speed Twin model was lighter than many contemporary singles with significantly more power and torque. Early models were only available in 'Amaranth red' with hand painted gold pinstripes to set off the chrome. Initially the one piece iron cylinder was secured with six studs which led to weakness, so these were replaced by eight studs.The two cylinders were fed by a single Amal Type 6 carburettor and many features such as the transmission and clutch were straight from the Triumph single. Originally with girder forks, the sprung saddle was the only rear suspension as the Speed Twin had a rigid frame - also from the single cylinder production line. On the night of 14 November 1940 the majority of the city-centre of Coventry was destroyed by German bombs and the Triumph factory (which was working on an order of thousands of military specification 5T's) was completely wiped out, and all of Triumph's technical records, drawings and designs were destroyed.
Development.
After the war the recovery of Triumph at Meriden was largely due to the Speed Twin, which was developed in 1946 with telescopic forks and optional sprung hub rear suspension. The headlamp and instrument area was tidied up in 1949 with the Turner-designed nacelle, a feature retained until the end of the model line. In 1953, the Speed Twin caused controversy among traditional British riders as the generator and magneto were replaced with a Lucas alternator and battery/coil ignition system.
Further development led to the 1959 model 5TA with a unit engine and gearbox construction and styling changes including the unpopular 'Bathtub' fairing which became more and more abbreviated as the model developed before disappearing altogether for the last year of production in 1966.
The unit 500 engine continued development in the parallel Tiger 100 range ending with the Tiger Daytona models which ceased production in 1973.

Port Carlisle

Port Carlisle is a fishing village in the City of Carlisle, Cumbria, England, one mile from Bowness-on-Solway—.
Historically within Cumberland, its original name was Fisher's Cross, and the port was built in 1819. Four years later, a canal link was added to take goods to Carlisle Basin. The canal was closed in 1853 and Port Carlisle silted up.
The canal basin at Carlisle and parts of the canal were filled in by the Port Carlisle Railway Company who constructed a railway that started passenger services in 1854, discontinuing them two years later when the railway to Silloth opened. As a cheap alternative, a horse-drawn service was provided in 1856 between Drumburgh and Port Carlisle railway station for a number of years. In 1914 steam power was used and to try and avoid closure a steam railmotor called 'Flower of Yarrow' was built and this service to Port Carlisle railway station lasted until the branch was closed in 1932.

Airmails of the United States

Airmails of the United States or U.S. Air Mail relates to the servicing of flown mails by the U.S. postal system within the United States, its possessions, and/or territories, marked as "Via Air Mail" (or equivalent), appropriately franked, and afforded any then existing class or sub-class of U.S. Air Mail service.
After an intermittent series of government sponsored experimental flights between 1911 and 1918, domestic U.S. Air Mail was formally established as a new class of service by the United States Post Office Department on May 15, 1918, with the inauguration of the Washington-Philadelphia-New York route for which the first of special Air Mail stamps were issued.
The exclusive transportation of flown mails by government operated aircraft came to an end in 1926 under the provisions of the "Kelly Act" which required the USPOD to transition to contracting with commercial air carriers to fly them over Contract Air Mail (CAM) routes to be established by the Department, although during the first half of 1934 the U.S. Army Air Force temporarily took over the routes — with disastrous results — when all CAM contracts were summarily cancelled by President Franklin D. Roosevelt owing to the Air Mail Scandal. Domestic air mail became obsolete in 1975, and international air mail in 1995, as distinct extra fee services when the USPS began transporting all First Class long distance intercity mail by air on a routine basis.
Experimental airmails.
During the first aerial flight in North America by balloon on January 9, 1793, from Philadelphia to Deptford, New Jersey, Jean-Pierre Blanchard carried a personal letter from George Washington to be delivered to the owner of whatever property Blanchard happened to land on, making the flight the first delivery of air mail in the United States.
John Wise piloted an unofficial balloon post flight that took place on July 17, 1859, from St. Louis, USA, to Henderson, New York, a distance of 1,290 km on which he carried a mailbag entrusted to him by the American Express Company. One month later, on August 17, Wise flew from Lafayette, Indiana, to Crawfordsville, Indiana, and carried 123 letters and 23 circulars on board that had been collected by the postmaster Thomas Wood and endorsed "PREPAID" but only one of these historic postal covers was discovered in 1957. In 1959 the United States Postal Service issued a 7 cent stamp (C-54) commemorating Wise's flight in the "Jupiter". Balloon mail was also carried on an 1877 flight in Nashville, Tennessee.
USPOD sponsored experiments.
The first official experiment at flying Air Mail to be made under the aegis of the United States Post Office Department took place on September 23, 1911, on the first day of an International Air Meet sponsored by The Nassau Aviation Corporation of Long Island, when pilot Earle L. Ovington flew 640 letters and 1,280 postcards from the Aero Club of New York's airfield located on Nassau Boulevard near Stratford School in Garden City (Long Island), New York, to the nearby Mineola Post Office in Mineola, located less than six miles away. After being duly sworn in by U.S. Postmaster General Frank Hitchcock as the first U.S. Air Mail pilot in history, Ovington took off in his own American-made Bleriot Queen tractor-type monoplane, "Dragonfly," at 5:26 PM and dropped the bag of mail over Mineola six minutes later from an altitude of 500 feet. Unfortunately the bag broke when it hit the ground, but all of the mail was eventually recovered and forwarded by regular channels with the cancellation reading "AEROPLANE STATION No.1 - GARDEN CITY ESTATES, N.Y."
Scheduled Air Mails.
U.S. Government flown Air Mail.
The first scheduled U.S. Air Mail service began on May 15, 1918, using U.S Army Curtiss JN-4HM "Jenny" biplanes flown by Army pilots operating on a route between Washington, D.C. (Washington Polo Grounds) and New York City (Belmont Park) with an intermediate stop in Philadelphia (Bustleton Field). Among those who were on hand for the departure of the first flight from Washington, D.C., were President Woodrow Wilson, U.S. Postmaster General Albert S. Burleson, and Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt. Army Lt. George L. Boyle was selected to pilot aircraft #38262 on the first Northbound flight which, unfortunately, turned out to be a somewhat less than successful initial venture.
Almost immediately after taking off at 11:47AM, Boyle became disoriented and started flying South when he followed the wrong set of railroad tracks out of the city. Realizing that he was lost, Boyle attempted to find out where he was by making an unscheduled landing just 18 minutes later at 12:05PM in Waldorf, Maryland, about 25 miles south of the city. Unfortunately, however, he broke the prop on his airplane when he made a hard landing, so the 140 pounds of mail he was carrying had to be trucked back to Washington from where it was finally flown North to Philadelphia and New York the following day. The site of the first continuously scheduled air mail service is marked by a plaque in West Potomac Park in Washington, D.C.. The route was extended to Boston three weeks later on June 4.
After four months of the mail being flown by the Army, all flight operations were taken over by the USPOD's Aerial Mail Service on August 12, 1918, using a fleet of six purpose built mail biplanes designed and constructed by the Standard Aircraft Corporation of Elizabeth, NJ, and flown by civilian pilots hired by the Post Office Department. After a number of "pathfinder" flights made in September, November, and early December, the first flight providing scheduled east-west service between New York and Chicago occurred on December 17, 1918.
Air Mail franking.
The original Air Mail letter rate per ounce between any two points on the route when service began was 24 cents per ounce for which the first special purpose U.S. Air Mail stamp (C-3) was issued on May 13, 1918. The red and blue stamp's vignette depicted Army JN-4 #38262, the aircraft that made the first Air Mail flight from Washington two days later, and the 24 cent fee it represented was apportioned at two cents for postage, 12 cents for air service, and 10 cents for Special Delivery. On July 15 the rate was dropped to 16 cents for the first ounce and 6 cents for each additional ounce, and on December 15 the rate was dropped again to 6 cents per ounce when Special Delivery was made optional. Additional monochromatic stamps of similar design to C-3 were also issued contemporaneously with these rate changes in 16 cent (green) and 6 cent (orange) denominations. Although these extra fee stamps were issued for use on mails to be serviced by air, the legend "AIR MAIL" did not appear on any USPOD stamp until eight years later when the 10-cent C-7 rectangular was issued on February 13, 1926, two days before the first ever mail flight under contract with a commercial carrier was made on February 15, an eastbound trip between Detroit and Cleveland over CAM Route 7.
Transcontinental Air Mail.
Scheduled Transcontinental Air Mail service flown between New York (Hazelhurst Field, L.I.) and San Francisco (Crissy Field) began on September 8, 1920, over a route laid out in July and August by Eddie Rickenbacker and Bert Acosta who had helped pilot the first experimental through flight carrying about 100 letters which landed at Durant Field located at 82nd Ave and E. 14th St. in East Oakland. The transcontinental mails were originally flown only during daylight hours while being entrained at night, although on February 22, 1921, a nighttime leg on this route (Omaha to Chicago) was flown for the first time with Jack Knight as the pilot. The first daily Transcontinental Air Mail service involving both day and night flying over the entire route was opened on July 1, 1924, which reduced the time of the trip from more than 70 hours to a schedule of 34 hours 46 minutes Westbound, and 32 hours 3 minutes Eastbound.. In addition to New York and San Francisco, the route included thirteen intermediate stops where mails were exchanged and aircrew relieved. This was accomplished at airfields located at Bellefonte (PA), Cleveland (OH), Bryan, (OH), Chicago (IL), Iowa City (IA), Omaha (NE), North Platte (NE), Cheyenne (WY), Rawlins (WY), Rock Springs (WY), Salt Lake City (UT), Elko (NV) and Reno (NV).
The conversion to commercially flown Air Mail.
Beginning Contract Air Mail (CAM) service.
The first two commercial Contract Air Mail (CAM) routes to begin operation in the United States were CAM-6 between Detroit (Dearborn) and Cleveland and CAM-7 between Detroit (Dearborn) and Chicago which were simultaneously inaugurated on February 15, 1926. The contractor for both routes was the Ford Motor Company, operating as Ford Air Transport, using a fleet of six Ford built Stout 2-AT aircraft. Lawrence G. Fritz, later the Vice President for Operations for TWA, was the pilot of the first flight to take off with mail from Ford Airport at Dearborn, on the CAM-6 eastbound leg to Cleveland.
Operated by Varney Air Lines (which later became part of United Airlines), the first Eastbound flight over CAM-5 was made successfully using a "Laird Swallow" biplane piloted by Leon D. Cuddeback. The first Westbound flight that afternoon was much less successful, however, as it was forced 75-miles off course by a storm en route from Elko to Boise before making a forced landing near Jordan Valley, Oregon. The plane and pilot Franklin Rose remained missing for two days until Rose managed to reach a telephone on April 8 after carrying the 98 pounds of mail for many miles on foot and on a horse borrowed from a farmer. The Westbound flown mail finally arrived at the Post Office in Pasco late in the morning of April 9, three days after leaving Elko.
On April 15, 1926, the third route to open (CAM-2) began operation with pilot Charles A. Lindbergh at the controls on the first flight. In October 1925, Lindbergh was hired by the Robertson Aircraft Corporation in St. Louis, Missouri, (where he had been working as a flight instructor) to first lay out, and then serve as chief pilot for the newly designated 278-mile CAM-2 to provide service between St. Louis and Chicago (Maywood Field) with two intermediate stops in Springfield and Peoria, Illinois. Operating from Robertson's home base at the Lambert-St. Louis Flying Field in Anglum, Missouri, Lindbergh and three other RAC pilots he selected (Philip R. Love, Thomas P. Nelson and Harlan A. "Bud" Gurney) flew the mail over CAM-2 in a fleet of four modified war surplus de Havilland DH-4 biplanes. A little more than a year later Lindbergh was catapulted from being an otherwise obscure 25-year old Air Mail pilot to virtual instantaneous world fame when he successfully piloted the Ryan NYP single engine monoplane "Spirit of St. Louis" on the first non-stop flight from New York to Paris in May, 1927.
Elrey Jeppesen, an airmail pilot, began to keep a notebook in 1930 filled with airfield charts, fields where he could land in an emergency, and instructions on how to land safely. Jeppesen also researched and included information about telephone or railroad service near these landing fields. Jeppesen provided copies of his notebook to fellow pilots - not, he said, to make money, but "to stay alive."
A total of 34 Contract Air Mail routes would eventually be established in the US between February 15, 1926, and October 25, 1930, however with the so-called "Air Mail Scandal" in 1934 the USPOD cancelled all the contracts on February 9, 1934, which resulted in the suspension of commercial CAM service effective February 19, 1934. Air Mail was flown exclusively by the U.S. Army (as the "Army Air Corps Mail Operation") from February 19 to May 8, 1934, when new temporary contracts with private carriers were put into effect. During this period there were a total of 66 accidents resulting in the deaths of 12 Army pilots including two who were killed on the last AACMO flight on June 6, 1934.
The end of domestic U.S. Air Mail as a distinct service.
Air Mail as a distinct service was effectively ended within the United States on October 10, 1975, however, when all domestic intercity First Class mails began to be transported by air whenever practical and/or expeditious at the normal First Class rate. Domestic Air Mail as a separate class of service (and its rate structure) was formally eliminated by the successor to the Post Office Department, the United States Postal Service (USPS) on May 1, 1977.
When the USPS began to service all international First Class mails by air without additional charge in 1995 and simultaneously eliminated Surface (or "Sea") service which provided transportation by ship, it also announced that the words "Air Mail" would no longer appear on any U.S. postage stamps. While the USPS no longer offers traditional letter Air Mail, it does provide various classes of "premium" domestic and international business, priority, and express Air Mail services with guaranteed delivery times at much higher rates.
In June 2006 the USPS formally trademarked "Air Mail" (two words with capital first letters) along with Pony Express.
Foreign U.S. Air Mail.
First experimental foreign Air Mail flight.
The first experimental foreign Air Mail flight from the U.S. was made by Eddie Hubbard and William E. Boeing while on a survey flight to Vancouver, British Columbia, on March 3, 1919. On board with them was a mail bag containing 60 letters, making this the first international U.S.Air Mail flight. Their aircraft was a modified World War I Boeing Model C trainer which had a cruising speed of 65 mph. Hubbard later flew the first international contract mail route, from Seattle to Victoria, British Columbia, which began on October 15, 1920. The route (FAM 2) was created to connect with steamships going to Asia.
Boeing started up an airplane manufacturing business which sold 50 aircraft to the U.S. Navy. At the end of war Boeing began to concentrate on commercial aircraft, secured contracts to supply airmail service and built a successful airmail operation. His airmail business was in the middle of the Air Mail scandal of the 1930s. In 1934, the United States government accused Boeing of monopolistic practices. The Air Mail Act of 1934 ordered him to break up his company into three separate entities: United Aircraft Corporation, Boeing Airplane Company, and United Air Lines. Thomas Braniff led the fight by independent airlines to break the power of the airline holding companies that dominated air transportation in the 1930s.

André Hallet

André Hallet (1890–1959) was a Belgian post-impressionist painter whose paintings have been exhibited at more than 60 museums worldwide, including the Louvre in Paris, France.
His most well-known paintings are those of the Congo and around Lake Kivu (in modern-day Rwanda).
He was initially sent to the Congo by the Belgian government in 1934 and then settled in Kisenyi (modern-day Rwanda), on the shores of Lake Kivu, in 1947, where he died in 1959.
In 1934 he forged a relationship with the Tutsi king Mwambi Matura III (of Ruanda-Burundi) and painted a series of detailed portraits of the king’s family and court.
Prior to his African period, he painted scenes of southern France, Naples, Capri, and Sicily, when he traveled through these areas as a young man. This was known as his European period.
His paintings have been sold at auction houses for record prices.
He is the father of Jean-Pierre Hallet, an internationally recognized human-rights activist (on the behalf of the Efe pygmies in the Ituri forest of the Congo) who also lived in the Congo and Rwanda and was also an avid art collector.
His paintings have been donated by the André Hallet Foundation for charitable causes, such as to "Medicins sans Frontiere" to aid Cambodian orphans in 1992, and to Association des Anciens du Congo (A.F.A.C), a philanthropic concern for the oldest civilizations still living in the Congo, and to the International Foundation Jacques Brel for cancer research.

This is a list of media in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador.
Radio.
St. John's is currently the only Canadian city served by radio stations whose call letters do not all begin with the letter "C". The ITU prefix "VO" was assigned to the Dominion of Newfoundland before the province joined Canadian Confederation in 1949, and three AM stations kept their existing call letters; the Broadcasting Corporation of Newfoundland's VONF, however, was taken over by CBC Radio and adopted the new call sign CBN. However, radio stations in St. John's which went to air after 1949 use the same range of prefixes ("CF"–"CK") currently in use elsewhere in Canada, with the exception of VOCM-FM, which was permitted to adopt the VOCM callsign because of its corporate association with the AM station that already bore that callsign. VO also remains in use in amateur radio.
Television.
CJON-DT channel 21 is an independent station branded as "NTV", headquartered in St. John’s. The station sublicenses entertainment programming from Global and news programming from CTV and Global, rather than purchasing primary broadcast rights as most independent stations do.
CBC has its Newfoundland and Labrador headquarters in the city and their television station CBNT-DT channel 8 broadcasts from University Avenue.
Rogers Cable has its provincial headquarters in St. John’s, and its community channel Rogers TV airs local shows such as "Out of the Fog" and "One Chef One Critic".
Network television in the United States is piped in from Boston and Detroit via Rogers Cable.

<doc id="18409468" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18409468" title="Wellen (novel)">
Wellen (novel)

Wellen (Waves) is a novel by Eduard von Keyserling that was first published in German in 1911. Set during a long hot summer in a small fishing village somewhere on the Baltic Sea, most likely on the Curonian Spit, it depicts a group of aristocratic city-dwellers spending their holidays in that remote part of the German Empire. However, rather than painting a rural idyll, Keyserling focuses on the follies of a doomed "fin de siècle" society whose self-imposed repressions eventually lead to catastrophe.
Plot summary.
Doralice, Countess of Köhne-Jasky, has walked out on her much older husband and run off with Hans Grill, a young artist who had been commissioned by the Count to paint his wife's picture. Now, a year later, Hans and Doralice have come to the Baltic coast to spend a solitary summer's holiday in a fisherman's hut. They are said to have got married in London so their relationship is outwardly considered "correct" although their marriage is generally seen as a misalliance, especially by the society Doralice has left behind. While she herself is rather unsure about her future, Hans Grill is an optimistic free spirit, though not quite a libertine, who is full of plans in which Doralice figures prominently. He dreams of setting himself up as a successful painter in Munich — thus being eventually able to stop living off his wife's money — and of living with her in a small suburban house.
Rather than shunning the unlikely couple, the other tourists at the small fishing village feel morally obliged to associate with them, at least perfunctorily. They are the extended Buttlär family: Baron von Buttlär; his wife Bella; their three children Lolo, Nini, und Wedig; and Baron von Buttlär's mother-in-law, the Generalin von Palikow. They are soon to be joined by Hilmar Baron von dem Hamm, Lolo's dashing fiancé, who is an officer in the German army. Also present is the Geheimrat von Knospelius, a high-ranking civil servant. Burdened with a physical handicap, and never having married, Knospelius is used to leading a vicarious life through the people he surrounds himself with, and as soon as they have arrived he introduces himself to both the Buttlärs and the Grills.
The presence of a scandalous couple does not go unnoticed by the Buttlär children. Rather, it is one of their games to sneak out of the house at night together with Ernestine, one of the young servants, to catch a glimpse of Doralice through the open window of the Grimms' rented hut. One day, while swimming in the sea, Lolo meets Doralice on a sandbank and is deeply impressed by her cheerful manner, her wit, and her beauty, so much so that she decides to send her a huge bunch of red roses, while instinctively choosing her as her role model.
Others who are also impressed by Doralice's beauty include Baron von Buttlär, a known womaniser, who is now jealously guarded by his wife, and Hilmar von dem Hamm, who openly starts courting Doralice despite her husband's and his own fiancée's presence. His endeavours to win Doralice's heart culminate in a boating trip that he undertakes with her while the others stay behind. Doralice feels flattered by the attentions of a member of the very social class that has ostracised her. At the same time, she realizes her indebtedness to, and possibly love for, Hans and stops all further advances on Hilmar's part. Lolo on the other hand, aware of her fiancé's infatuation, but due to an over-protective upbringing unprepared for life's harsh realities, decides to sacrifice herself by committing suicide. At night she secretly leaves the house wearing only her bathing costume under her coat, walks down to the beach and starts swimming out into the ocean, far beyond the sandbank where she met Doralice. She is rescued by local fishermen who drag her half-conscious body into their boat and return her to her family.
Although Lolo makes a quick and full recovery, etiquette demands of the Buttlärs that they depart immediately. Those who stay behind into the autumn are Hans and Doralice Grimm and Geheimrat Knospelius — the latter because, unbeknown to everyone, he has handed in his resignation and now has all the time in the world, and the Grimms because they actually have no other place to go. In the course of the summer, Hans has become more and more monosyllabic, and Doralice longs for some serious talk concerning their future together: She realizes that she desperately needs Hans's reassurance of his love for her. Hans, however, keeps postponing that talk to the following day and indulges in his growing fascination with the sea. Not only does he paint it; he now accompanies the fishermen on their nightly routine on a more or less regular basis and then sleeps during most of the day.
One night he goes out fishing with Steege, a notorious drunkard whose vice has prevented him from buying a new fishing boat. The old dilapidated one cannot defy the thunderstorm of which they have been warned, and the sea claims two more lives: After long days of waiting, Doralice and Mrs Steege finally accept the fact that their husbands are not coming back. At this point Knospelius makes Doralice the unexpected offer to be his companion for the foreseeable future and to spend the winter with him touring the Greek islands.
Rediscovery.
Literary critic Jens Malte Fischer called Keyserling "possibly the most unknown of the great German story-tellers of the century." "Wellen" was selected as one of 100 great novels of the 20th century by the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" and reprinted in a special edition in 2004.
Film adaptation.
In 2005 Vivian Naefe adapted Keyserling's novel for television. Based on a screenplay by Günter Schütter, the film starred Sunnyi Melles, Matthias Habich and Marie Bäumer.
Various changes to the plot of the novel were made. For example, in the film, the action is set on the eve of the First World War in order to stress the imminence of death of an aristocratic society and its antiquated social mores and conventions. Also, for whatever reason, Knospelius was renamed "Froselius", while the artist's name is given as "Til Knop". Hilmar von dem Hamm becomes "Carl von Gonthard".

Malarguesaurus is a genus of titanosauriform sauropod dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous of Mendoza Province, Argentina. Its fossils, consisting of tail vertebrae, chevrons, ribs, and limb bones, were found in the late Turonian-early Coniacian-age (~89 million years old) Portezuelo Formation of the Neuquén Group. The type species, described by González Riga "et al." in 2009, is "M. florenciae". Described as a robust sauropod, its closest known relatives may be "Ligabuesaurus" and "Phuwiangosaurus". Like other sauropods, "Malarguesaurus" would have been a large quadrupedal herbivore."Malarguesaurus" is the second sauropod dinosaur discovered in Mendoza Province; the first is "Mendozasaurus neguyelap".

Springwell Community College (formerly Springwell Community School) is a secondary school in Chesterfield, England which is nicknamed by Jordan Williams as "Springy". It is a mixed comprehensive of 947 students aged between 11 and 16 years. Around 180 pupils from Inkersall, Staveley, Brimington, Hollingwood, Barrow Hill, and other primary schools in the Staveley-Brimington area enrol at the school every year. It was formed in 1991 by the amalgamation of two secondary schools, Westwood (which was located in nearby Hollingwood) and Middlecroft following a reorganisation of education in Chesterfield.
Building and Structure.
The school is currently housed in a 1960’s building set in its own playing fields, with specialist accommodation to meet the current curriculum provision. Two new buildings, a performing arts and sports block, are the start of the new school which is planned to be completed by 2010 as part of the "Building Schools for the Future Programme" by Derbyshire County Council.
However, as of November 2010, Springwell Community School became Springwell Community College and moved to a newer building next door. This building is more modern and larger for the large quantity of students currently attending the school.

Bitnami

Bitnami is an open source project that produces open source installers or software packages for web applications and development stacks as well as virtual appliances. Bitnami is sponsored by Bitrock, a company founded in 2003 in Seville, Spain by Daniel Lopez Ridruejo. Bitnami stacks are used for installing software on Linux, Windows, Mac OS X and Solaris.
Technology overview.
BitNami stacks are available for popular web applications such as WordPress, Drupal, Joomla!, and MediaWiki. In addition to the application itself, the stacks include the other software required to run that application. For example, a WordPress stack will include WordPress, as well as the MySQL database to manage data, Apache Web server to serve the pages, and phpMyAdmin to administer MySQL. BitNami installers are released under the Apache License 2.0. 
Using automated cloud computing management, BitNami offers users automated application deployments of open source server apps from Amazon EC2 servers.
Since July 2009 BitNami also offers ready-to-run virtual machines.
The distinct difference between installation of BitNami installers and native installs (e.g. rpms and debs on Linux) are that they are installed in a way as to prevent interference with existing software and libraries. If multiple applications are installed on the same web server considerations for resolving conflicts on specific ports must be made. 
On February 13, 2009, BitNami announced the release of the Enano CMS web stack, which is unique in that according to BitNami and to the Enano CMS Project, the stack module was the first to be externally developed.
On February 2010, BitNami announced the release of BitNami Cloud Hosting a service that allows deploying BitNami stacks on the Amazon EC2 cloud, with automatic monitoring and backups.

Daryl Simmons

Daryl Simmons (born April 11, 1957) is an American Grammy Award-winning R&B songwriter, musician and record producer who is best known for his association with the LaFace Records production duo of L.A. Reid and Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds.
Biography.
Simmons attended North Central High School in Indianapolis, Indiana together with future Pop and R&B producer-songwriter-singer Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds. The duo would write songs at each others homes on a consistent basis. As teenagers, Simmons and Edmonds formed a band called, "Tarnished Silver", which also included Rayford Griffin and Tom Borton. The group performed at many colleges, proms and high school parties. In the late 70's, Simmons and Edmonds were both members of an Indianapolis R&B group, "Manchild". The group released two albums before breaking up and while the outfit never quite took off, Simmons' and Edmonds' relationship as songwriters/producers had already been cemented. The two would go on to collaborate for years.
Career.
After Manchild’s breakup, Edmonds joined Antonio “L.A.” Reid’s band, The Deele, in the early 1980s. Simmons soon followed Edmonds to work with The Deele, as a writer and a musician. Simmons co-wrote on two albums for The Deele, as well as played as a musician. The most successful of the two albums co-written by Simmons was “Eyes of a Stranger”, which went gold with the hit song, “Two Occasions”. With the success of “Two Occasions”, the trio began working with outside artists such as Pebbles, Sheena Easton, The Whispers, Paula Abdul, Karyn White, Johnny Gill and Bobby Brown.
Reid and Edmonds relocated to Atlanta in 1989, to form their own company, LaFace Records. The duo was joined by Simmons and together they discovered, signed and produced their own artists such as Toni Braxton, TLC, Usher, Damian Dame and OutKast
In 1991, Simmons co-wrote and co-produced the trio’s most successful song to date, “End of the Road”, from the Eddie Murphy movie, “Boomerang”. The song garnered a Grammy Award in 1992 for “Best R&B Song”. “End of the Road” topped the charts from August 15 through November 7, 1992, setting a record for most weeks at number one with 13 weeks, beating Elvis Presley's 11-week hold with "Hound Dog" and "Don't Be Cruel". Presley's record had stood 36 years.
Simmons, Edmonds and Reid collaborated again with Whitney Houston on “The Bodyguard Soundtrack” (since 1990's album "I'm Your Baby Tonight"), which went on to sell more than 45 million albums worldwide. The trio also worked with Michael Jackson on his “Dangerous” album. Although the trio’s songs didn’t make the album, Simmons enjoyed working with Jackson and deems it an “amazing experience”. 
In 1994, Edmonds released the solo album, “For the Cool in You”. Simmons was a major contributor to this triple platinum album. Edmonds collaborated with Simmons on Aretha Franklin's, "Willing to Forgive" which reached no. 5 on the R&B charts, and Mariah Carey's “Never Forget You” which peaked at number 7. Simmons and Edmonds also penned Tevin Campbell’s smash hit, “Can We Talk”.
In the mid ‘90s as the trio’s collaborative efforts began to slow, Simmons formed his own company, “Silent Partner Productions”. Simmons built a state-of-the-art recording studio and began working on solo projects. He wrote and produced a Top 10 Pop hit for Monica with “Why I Love You so Much” (#3 R&B). Simmons also produced and co-wrote Dru Hill’s “In My Bed”. "In My Bed" was a number-one platinum-selling R&B single by R&B group Dru Hill. It is the second single from their eponymous debut album. The single spent three weeks at number-one on the US R&B chart and peaked at number four on the US pop chart. Simmons followed this hit with a ballad from the same Dru Hill album, “Never Make a Promise”. The single spent four weeks at number one on the US R&B chart and peaked at number seven on the US pop chart.
Other notable productions include songs and production for Elton John, Destiny's Child, Cece Winans, Bebe Winans, Mya, Diana Ross, Aretha Franklin, Lionel Richie, Dru Hill, Kevon Edmonds and 98 Degrees.
In 1997, Simmons collaborated with Edmonds again on songs for Dru Hill for the “Soul Food” soundtrack, (We’re Not Making Love No More,” #2 R&B). In 1999, Simmons collaborated with Babyface and “L.A.” Reid on TLC’s 3rd album, “Fanmail”, and also gave new life to the Dell’s "The Love We Had (Stays on My Mind)" which he produced for Dru Hill’s second album, “Enter the Dru”. Despite not being released as a single, the song made it into the R&B top 50 on radio airplay alone.
In 2005, Simmons co-wrote with Edmonds songs for the album “Grown and Sexy”. Notable songs include: "Tonite It's Goin' Down", "Grown & Sexy", "Goin' Outta Bizness", and "Sorry For the Stupid Things", of which the last one made the R&B Charts.
Simmons most recent projects include songs co-written for Toni Braxton and Kenneth “Babyface” Edmonds’ duet album, “Love, Marriage and Divorce”, available now on iTunes.

Rum Swizzle

A Rum Swizzle is a rum-based cocktail often called "Bermuda's national drink". "The Royal Gazette" has referred to it as "the legendary rum swizzle...perfect for sharing and irresistible to locals and tourists alike" In addition to providing the "swizzle" portion of the 1933 swizzle stick product name, it has been said that this potent cocktail is "as much a part of Bermuda Island culture and cuisine as is the Bermuda onion, the vibrant hibiscus, or the graceful Bermuda Longtail."
Recipes.
Different bartenders have varying interpretations of this drink. One of the older recipes was presented in the 1941 "Old Mr. Boston De Luxe Official Bartender Guide". Gosling's Rum, which is based in Bermuda, publishes a recipe with two different rums from their brand line. Rum, fruit juice (often including lime, and orange and pineapple juice), and a flavored sweetener such as falernum or grenadine are the most consistent ingredients, and the drink is generally shaken or stirred with ice.
History.
Icy drink mixtures with rum, first identified as swizzles and later as Rum Swizzles, have been mentioned in literature in a variety of locations since the mid 18th century: Fort Ticonderoga, New York (1760), the Caribbean island of Saint Kitts (1838), Bridgetown, Barbados (1841), Great Britain (1862), Bridgeport, Barbados (1908), and the island of Saint Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands (1911). In these earliest versions, the drink typically consisted of one part of rum diluted with five or six parts water (sometimes with additional aromatic ingredients), which was mixed by rotating a special forked stick made from a root between the palms; another account describes it as spruce beer with added rum and sugar.
In his 1909 book, "Beverages, Past and Present: An Historical Sketch of Their Production," Brotherhood Winery owner Edward R. Emerson asserted that Rum Swizzles originated on the Caribbean island of Saint Kitts. American naturalist and writer Frederick Albion Ober noted in 1920 that the great drink of the Barbados ice houses was the swizzle, a combination of liquors, sugar, and ice whisked to a froth by a rapidly revolved "swizzle-stick" made from the stem of a native plant, perhaps "Quararibea turbinata" (the "swizzlestick tree") or an allspice bush. 
The etymology of the word "swizzle" is unknown, but it may derive from a similar beverage known as switchel.
Rum Swizzles were the drink of choice at what was purportedly the world's first cocktail party held in London, England in 1924 by novelist Alec Waugh. A reference to a (possibly fictitious) "Green Swizzle" drink dates to 1925 (see "Other Swizzles" below). The Rum Swizzle is also mentioned in Sinclair Lewis's 1925 novel "Arrowsmith", which is set in the fictional Caribbean island of St. Hubert. In 1930, the drink was referenced in a book written by Joseph Hergesheimer, which refers to the drink containing Bacardi rum and bitters, as well as a swizzle stick made of sassafras. The Rum Swizzle was also mentioned in the 1931 autobiographical novel "Half a Loaf", penned by Sinclair Lewis's former wife Grace Hegger Lewis about their life together.
Today the Rum Swizzle is often associated with The Swizzle Inn of Bailey's Bay, Bermuda, whose motto is "Swizzle Inn, Swagger Out." The Swizzle Inn is known as "the home of the Rum Swizzle" and Bermuda's oldest pub, favourite drinking hole of island resident Michael Douglas 
As noted by the Bermuda Hotel Association:
Other swizzles.
"Trader Vic's Bartender's Guide" presents several variant swizzle recipes including the Kingston Swizzle (made with Jamaican rum and hot water), the Kona Swizzle (incorporating almond syrup), and the Martinique Swizzle (flavored with Herbsaint, Pernod or anisette). According to that guide:
The "Spirit of Bermuda" cookbook says that the "Bermuda swizzle stick" with which this drink is traditionally stirred and garnished is a three-pronged stick often cut from an allspice bush. The Green Swizzle, a drink for which the recipe "has been lost in history" (if it ever existed) is mentioned by Bertie Wooster in "The Rummy Affair of Old Biffy" by P. G. Wodehouse:
The Trader Vic's guide quoted above also has a recipe for a Green Swizzle (this one incorporating green crème de menthe) but specifies it is "not what Bertie (Wooster) had at Wembley."

Nellie Crockett (Buy-Boat)

The "Nellie Crockett" is a Chesapeake Bay oyster buy-boat built for Andrew A. Crockett of Tangier, Virginia, in 1925. She is located at Georgetown, Maryland, USA, on the Sassafras River. She was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1994.
The "Nellie Crockett" was built specifically to operate as a buy-boat, making the rounds of the Chesapeake Bay oyster beds to buy oysters directly from the harvesters, typically sail-powered skipjacks or oyster tongers. This allowed the oyster dredges to remain on the beds, avoiding the need to return to port when full. Buy-boats typically gave a lower price than a dockside sale, but most oystermen considered this a fair trade for not losing time on a run back to the dock.
Description.
The "Nellie Crockett" is a wooden, plank-on-frame freightboat, documented measuring . She measures 52 tons gross and 35 tons net. Her wide beam and moderate draft were useful in her business of buying, loading and transporting oysters in the shallow waters of the Chesapeake Bay. The hull is built using wood frames made from the natural crooks of tree limbs and roots. It is planked with pine. The deck planking is laid fore-and-aft over deck beams on hanging knees. A partially watertight bulkhead is located in the forecastle.
Power is presently provided by a Detroit Diesel 871, dating to 1971 or 1972, fueled from two boilerplate steel tanks. A water tank is also fitted.
The center of the deck is dominated by a large hold opening, , surrounded by a coaming. The mast lies just ahead of the hatch, rising . A 1956 quarter and a 1951 nickel were found under the mast, indicating that it was replaced or re-stepped in the 1950s, with a traditional coin placed underneath at the time. The mast has two cargo-handling booms attached at its base. The foc'sle hatch is forward of the mainmast, measuring . A low railing runs from the foc'sle hatch to the stern, with two rails, one above the other.
The pilot house is rectangular with a rounded front, . It is covered with vertical tongue-and-groove sheathing. The pilot house is divided into three compartments, each formerly divided from the others by doors, now missing. The wheel room occupies the front compartment, housing the rope-and-pulley-operated wheel, with five windows on the front, two on either side, and doors on either side. A heater stands at the rear. A flush deck hatch gives access to the engine compartment. The next compartment behind the wheel room, and a little lower, is the bunk room, long, with three bunks on the port side and a shower on the starboard side, replacing the original head. There is a porthole for the upper bunk. Behind the bunkroom lies the kitchen, long, with a window on each side and a door aft. At the fore, in the foc'sle compartment, two more bunks are provided.
The "Crockett" is substantially the same as she was built. Apart from the installation of a radar unit two deck manholes were added, a bulhead was removed in the engine room, and a stove may have been removed from the foc'sle. The hold was not used during the Ward family's tenure, as it was considered too smelly. Oysters were stored on deck in baskets, as many as 2200 bushels at a time, with ten to twelve tons of granite ballast below.
History.
The "Nellie Crockett" was built in 1925 by Charles A. Dana at Crisfield, Maryland for Andrew A. "Shad" Crockett of Tangier, Virginia. She was named for one of Crockett's daughters. Until 1942 she was operated by Crockett, carrying oysters in season and produce and lumber in the off season. In 1942 she was purchased by the U.S. War Shipping Administration for $6,000 as a fireboat in ports along the Chesapeake. Designated "CG-65015F", she served until 1945, when Crockett bought her back for $10. Crockett sold a half share in "Crockett" to William Smith and a quarter share to Charles M. Crockett for a total of $750 in 1946. Her original 45 hp engine was replaced with a 60 hp engine. On Christmas Eve 1947, Priscilla Crocket was given Andrew Crockett's share for one dollar. She was sold in 1950 to Gus Forbush, who changed the engine to a 165 hp model. She was then sold to Gilbert Ashley, who moved her to Baltimore, but then sold her in 1952 to J. Harry Porter and Harry B. Porter of Baltimore, who moved her back to Crisfield. In 1957, the Porters sold her to James H. Ward, Sr. and William H. Ward of Reedville, Virginia. William sold his share to James in 1966. James Ward operated "Crockett" as a buy-boat until his death in 1986. Family members continued to operate her until 1990. She was then bought by Theodore L. Parish of Georgetown.

Larkin House

The Larkin House, located at 464 Calle Principal, Monterey, California was built in 1835 by Thomas O. Larkin. It is claimed that the house was the first two story house in all of California, and that it was the first house with a fireplace in Monterey. The design combined Spanish Colonial building methods with New England architectural features and originated the popular Monterey Colonial style of architecture. The Larkin House is both a National and a California Historical Landmark.
History.
In 1832 Thomas O. Larkin joined his half brother John B.R. Cooper in business. Larkin became the most influential American in Monterey, capital of Alta California. He served as the only United States consul to Mexico in Monterey. Monterey expanded beyond the old Spanish Presidio walls. Many leading citizens built their large houses using white wash, sun dried adobe bricks. 
The Larkin House was designated as a California Historical Landmark in 1933. It then became a National Historic Landmark in 1960 and is part of the larger Monterey State Historic Park which is itself designated a National Historic Landmark District.

Hot (Beatnuts song)

"Hot" is the first single from "Milk Me", a 2004 album by East Coast hip hop group The Beatnuts. It was released by Penalty Recordings as a 12 inch and CD single without any b-sides or additional tracks. The song is produced by The Beatnuts and features raps by Juju and Psycho Les, as well as ad libs sung by Greg Nice. The song's lyrics are braggadocios, hard-hitting and aggressive. The song's beat is characterized by a fast pounding horn loop and matching drums sampled from "Rock Box" by Run-D.M.C.. The song also features live instrumentation provided by guitarist Eric Krasno and keyboardist Neal Evans.
Although "Hot" failed to chart, it received positive critical attention: Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic and Tom Doggett of RapReviews.com consider it a "standout song". Robert DeGracia of AllHipHop.com describes why the track stands out: 
The popularity of "Hot" earned it a spot on the 2005 soundtrack for the film "King's Ransom". In 2004, a HipHopSite.com exclusive remix of "Hot" was released in 7" format.

California Proposition 6 (2008)

California Proposition 6, also known as the Safe Neighborhoods Act and The Runner Initiative, is a statutory initiative that appeared on the November 2008 ballot in California. This proposition was rejected by voters on November 4 of that year.
Proposition 6 would have placed additional penalties on gang related and drug crime.
Provisions of Prop 6.
Proposition 6 would:
Estimated fiscal impact.
The California Legislative Analyst's Office has arrived at the following summary of Prop. 6's estimated costs:
Funds to pay for these costs, should Prop. 6 pass, will come from 0.3% of California's general fund. 
In the current California state budget, $600 million (0.6%) is set aside to assist with local law enforcement. If the initiative passes, an additional $350 million (0.3%) will be required to enforce some of its provisions.
Supporters of Prop. 6.
The name of the official campaign committee supporting Proposition 6 is the Committee to Take Back Our Neighborhoods.
Path to the ballot.
The petition drive to place the measure on the ballot was conducted by National Petition Management, at a cost of $1.022 million.
Supporters turned in over 750,000 signatures on April 25 to qualify the measure for the November 2008 ballot, and the measure was subsequently approved for the ballot.,
Donors who support Prop. 6.

Nicholas, who was arraigned on June 16, 2008 and pleaded not guilty on charges that included drug use, security fraud and conspiracy and has withdrawn from active support of the initiative, though the campaign has stated they will not return his $1,000,000 contribution. Ironically he is also charged with possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute, meaning he himself would receive the tougher penalties of this initiative.

WolfQuest

WolfQuest is a 3D wildlife simulation video game developed by the Minnesota Zoo and game developer company Eduweb. The game's main purpose is to help players understand wolves and the roles they play in nature by being virtually incarnated as a gray wolf themselves. "WolfQuest" challenges players to learn about wolf ecology by living the life of a wild wolf in Yellowstone National Park and is a family-friendly, fun game for people of all ages.
A community forum is also available for registered users to learn about the game and download the latest version, as well as post tips and strategies, ask questions of wolf experts, share personal wolf artwork and stories, test their wolf knowledge with online polls and quizzes, compete for prizes, and participate in partner promotions at: http://wolfquest.org/bb
Gameplay.
Gameplay is divided into two parts – single player, where players are able to play in a "story mode" type adventure, and multiplayer, where player are able to play in real-time with up to 4 other people in a game server.
Singleplayer.
In single player, the player must survive as a dispersal gray wolf in Yellowstone National Park. To do so they must hunt elk and hares, or feed off elk carcasses. They must also avoid dangers such as grizzly bears, coyotes, and non-dispersal wolves. However, it is possible to fight off the bears and coyotes by chasing them, and fight off other wolves. They have the option to find a mate, which, when successful, will follow and aid the player throughout the rest of the game. In order to find a mate, the player must visit all the territories seen on the map, and then search for a mate which can be found in all territories.
When creating their wolf character, players are free to choose the gender, fur coloration, stats, and name of their wolf. There are five different pelts to choose from (black, sable, timber, white and gray), with two sliders that let players change the tints of the guard hairs and undercoat of the wolf. Just like real wolves, males are larger in size than females. The maximum strength for males is also higher than that of females..
Multiplayer.
In multiplayer, the objectives of the game are the same with two exceptions. The player co-operates with a maximum of 5 wolves including themselves, and can have no mate. (Regardless, some players still say that other players are their mates. The "WolfQuest" team does not support this kind of behavior.) In multiplayer, players can instantly chat, but the chat's lexicon blocks all words except common English words. Things like numbers and swear words are not allowed, and adult content is also blocked and not allowed. It is highly encouraged players report any behavior that breaks the multiplayer rules.
Players in multiplayer can start rallies and hunt bull elk. Bull elk have more meat than female elk and are many times harder to kill. Players may bite elk in the neck or back legs while hunting.
WolfQuest Episode 2 "Slough Creek: Survival of the Pack".
The sequel of "WolfQuest: Amethyst Mountain", "WolfQuest: Slough Creek" was released on January 1, 2010 at 11:30 CMT as part of ""Survival of the Pack"". "Amethyst Mountain" and "Slough Creek" are included in the "Slough Creek" download, so installing or uninstalling "Amethyst Mountain" is unnecessary.
In this new addition, players and their mates search for a den to raise pups in a new location, Slough Creek. However, after finding a densite, the player must scent mark the area around the den to make it safe from predators and stranger wolves. After completion, the player will obtain pups. Ravenous bears and coyotes roam the earth, posing a new threat to young pups as they wait to snatch one up under a novice parent's nose. At the end, you, your mate, and your surviving pups must make a journey for the summer den in the Douglas Fir Forests. But the player, the player's mate, and pups will run into grizzlies, coyotes, eagles and drowning. The only way pups can get across the river, is by finding a shallow sandbar. Wolf territories will also expand, so the player cannot take an easy way out.
In the game, players have the opportunity (though not a mandatory option) to raid a cattle ranch for extra food in the Night Mission. The player sneaks around in the dark at a cow ranch, and searches for the calf to kill and feed to his/her pups. However, doing so is extremely dangerous and can result in being shot - a warning that the player is close to being shot, is hearing dogs barking. The player has approximately a minute to find the calf and kill it and consume it.
Episode 2.5 "Survival of the Pack: Deluxe".
In August 2010, WolfQuest held an "idea contest" via the WolfQuest Community Forum, which can be found here. The winner for the "Big Idea" section of the contest was Exiah, with her idea "Time and Weather", which affects hunting with weather and time. The winner for the "Game Enhancement" section was Cama, with his idea "I need a rest!", where players can make their wolves sit or lie down to regain stamina faster than they would standing still.
"Survival of the Pack: Deluxe" was released on October 5, 2011 with several new features added to it, as well as "I need a rest", weather and time was also added. It includes both episodes: Amethyst Mountain and Slough Creek.
Players can press "R" to sit, and pressing it again, to cause their wolf to lie down. The "Z" button will cause a dialogue box to appear, asking the player which time of day they would like to sleep until (Dawn, Day, Dusk, and Night). Weather includes snow: rain, lightning and fire, and affects scents seen in scent-view.
Shortly after the "Survival of the Pack: Deluxe" release, the version, 2.5.1 came out. It came out on October 11, 2011, and is a minor bug fix update to "WolfQuest 2.5" (which added weather effects, changing times of day, a new phrase chat, improved lexicon chat safeguards, and more). This version fixes bugs with female wolf choice in single-player, seeing other wolves sit and lie down in multi-player, and a few other minor bugs.
Future episode prospects.
WolfQuest originally planned to make an episode 3 and an episode 4, as stated in the site's frequently asked questions page, located at http://www.wolfquest.org/bb/viewforum.php?f=22. However, on November 28, 2011, the following was announced in the Wolfquest Forums:
"We're glad so many people were so excited for the release of episode 2.5 (WolfQuest: Survival of the Pack Deluxe), and we're hoping everyone is enjoying it. But of course, along with a new release always comes the question: what's next?? As you all should be aware, WolfQuest development is determined by funding. While we continue to discuss possible options for expansion of the game and WolfQuest community, we (the WolfQuest Team) are not currently working on any new releases. If that changes, we will be sure to let you all know. Thank you all for playing the game and conversing on these forums; we hope to continue adding new forum content and game updates if more funding becomes available."
Despite having no funding to make future episodes, "Wolfquest 2.5" is still actively played, and all features of the game and forums remain open as "Wolfquest" continues to run on upkeep donations from the MN Zoo and Eduweb, Wolfquest Store purchases, and advertisement revenue. However, activity on the forums has varied, and is overall much lower than what was seen in 2011 and earlier. 
There is mass speculation about how much longer WolfQuest will remain open, and as announced on the forums on September 9, 2012, no one is quite sure how much longer it will be until the feared WolfQuest "Grand Closing":
"WolfQuest will definitely last more than a few weeks, but we don't know many details about exactly how much longer various things will be open and available. A lot depends on other funding (obviously), the zoo's continued or decreased involvement, and eduweb's continued or decreased involvement. But either way, there's nothing to be worried about for the near future." 
NSF grant.
On September 2006, The National Science Foundation awarded the Minnesota Zoo and Eduweb a USD $508,253 informal education grant to develop "WolfQuest". This makes it the first video game funded by the National Science Foundation, under grant number 0610427.
Awards.
"WolfQuest" won a few awards at Unite 2008, a developer's conference. It received Special Recognition Awards in two different categories, Best Serious Game and Best Multiplayer.
"WolfQuest" has now also won another award, the Education Award through the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA).
"The Association of Zoos and Aquariums recognizes outstanding achievement in educational program design judging programs on their ability to promote conservation knowledge, attitudes and behavior, show innovation, and measure success."
Criticism.
"WolfQuest" was cited by Senator Tom Coburn in his "Wastebook 2010" report about government spending:
• The National Science Foundation (NSF) awarded over $600,000 to the Minnesota Zoo to create a wolf “avatar” video game called “WolfQuest.”

Traditionally, name day celebrations (Polish: imieniny) have often enjoyed a celebratory emphasis greater than that of birthday celebrations in Poland. However, birthday celebrations are increasingly popular and important, particularly among the young as well as the older generation in the new territories gained after The Second World War due to remaining Prussian Protestant influences. Imieniny involve the gathering and socialising of friends and family at the celebrant's home, as well as the giving of gifts and flowers at home and elsewhere, such as at the workplace. Local calendars often contain the names celebrated on a given day.

National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund

The National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) is administered by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) for the purpose of providing deposit insurance to protect deposits of credit union members at insured institutions in the United States. It was created in 1970 shortly after the creation of the NCUA as an independent regulator of credit unions. The NCUSIF is funded completely by participating credit unions, and no taxpayer dollars have ever been used to bail out a credit union. The NCUSIF is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. 
As of 31 December 2007 the fund had a balance of $7.3 billion and insured nearly 87 million accounts at 5,036 federal credit unions and 3,065 state-chartered credit unions.
Funding, premiums and dividends.
In 1970 Congress approved and President Richard M. Nixon signed Public Law 91-206 (see ), creating the National Credit Union Administration as an independent agency. Soon after, Congress established the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund and made the NCUA responsible for its administration.
The NCUSIF is funded entirely by deposits from insured credit unions. All Federal credit unions, as well as any state chartered credit union insured by the fund, are required to maintain a balance equalling 1% of all covered deposits in the fund. The NCUA is required to set a target equity balance of at least 1.2% and no more than 1.5% of the total of insured deposits.
The majority of the fund is invested in United States treasury securities, and a significant portion of the earnings are used to fund the operations of the NCUA. Proceeds from the fund provided 53.3% of the NCUA operating budget in FY 2007 with the remainder coming from operating fees charged to regulated credit unions.
In the event that the equity ratio of the fund falls below 1.2%, the NCUA will charge a premium to insured credit unions to maintain the required minimum. In years when the fund achieves a ratio above 1.3%, it will pay out excess funds to insured credit unions in the form of a dividend. Since the fund was recapitalized by credit unions in 1985, the fund has charged one premium in 1992. The fund has issued several dividends to member credit unions, the most recent in 2007.
NCUSIF insured accounts.
Since the passage of the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 deposits were insured for up to $100,000 per insured account, or $250,000 for certain retirement accounts. The passage of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 increased the amount of covered shares to $250,000 until the end of 2013. This increase was made permanent by the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in July 2010.
NCUA insurance covers "member share accounts and deposits":
Accounts at different credit unions are insured separately. All branches of a credit union are considered to comprise a single credit union. NCUA publishes a guide entitled Your Insured Funds setting forth the general contours of NCUSIF insurance, and addressing common questions asked by credit union members regarding insurance.

Parallel college

A parallel college is a privately owned educational institution in Kerala (a state of India), which is not affiliated to any university, neither recognized by any, but offers training for courses following the courseware of a university quite unofficially. This system works because most of the universities in Kerala allow what is called 'private registration', in which a student can register in a university for a course, and then could pursue an academic programme without being admitted to a college or a university department, but learn the courseware all by oneself and then appear for examination at the university. And these students who pursue a 'private study' do rely on parallel colleges for tuition and guidance. Such a system had become popular in Kerala because the total intake capacity of the affiliated colleges were inadequate to contain the aspirants for higher (tertiary) education.
Parallel colleges were always small scale institutions with very limited facilities. They offered training only in 'arts' (social sciences and literature) or 'commerce' faculties (BA, B.Com, MA, M.Com) and never in 'science' or 'technical' faculties. This was because science courses required lab facilities.
The demise.
Parallel colleges were very popular and were, in fact, centres of education for the masses in the 70s through 90s. But by the end of the 2000s this system has come to a demise, following the state opening the higher education sector to private investors, which has caused a surge in the number of private engineering colleges and other privately owned professional colleges, which leaves many of the conventional (affiliated) degree colleges under-populated, ceasing the reason for the very existence of the parallel system.
Tutorial colleges.
Tutorial colleges are institutions similar to parallel colleges with more limited scope. While parallel colleges impart full training to its students, tutorial colleges merely supplement the lessons given by colleges or schools.

Surfers Paradise International Raceway

Surfers Paradise International Raceway was a motor racing complex at Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. The 3.219 km (2.000 mi) long circuit was designed and built by Keith Williams, a motor racing enthusiast who also designed and built the Adelaide International Raceway in South Australia in 1972. It was located opposite the Surfers Paradise Ski Gardens at Carrara.
The Circuit.
Surfers Paradise Raceway included a dragstrip along the main straight, with a very fast right-hander under the Dunlop Bridge leading to a tight corner that turned the track back to a medium-length straight. Then a fast left hander before rushing into a series of rights and lefts that skirted the only hill on the property (commonly known as Qantas Hill). A slow right called that opened up brought the track back to the main straight.
Within the circuit lay an airstrip and quarter-mile speedway similar to the one that used to sit within the lower part of the Amaroo Park circuit in Sydney. Drag racing commenced at Easter in 1966.
Keith Williams sold the raceway in 1984, and the circuit closed at the end of 1987 after 21 years of operation. At the end of its life, the outright lap record of 1:04.3 was set in 1986 and was held by John Bowe driving a Chevrolet powered Veskanda Group A Sports Car. After years of neglect it was finally destroyed in 2003. The site has since been redeveloped as Emerald Lakes canal estate.
Major races.
Tasman Series.
With Lakeside well established as a Queensland's round of the Tasman Series it was not until 1968 that the series visited Surfers Paradise. As typified the 1968 series Jim Clark (Lotus 49T) and Chris Amon (Ferrari 246) filled the top two positions with Clark's team mate Graham Hill completing the podium. Formula 5000 Tasman Series rounds were also held at the circuit each year from 1970 to 1975.
Australian Grand Prix.
The Australian Grand Prix visited just once, in 1975. In torrential rain Max Stewart took his Lola T400 Formula 5000 to victory from John Leffler, who was second on a day when the F5000's were badly out-handled by Ray Winter driving his AF2 Mildren Mono Ford.
Australian Touring Car Championship.
The circuit hosted rounds of the Australian Touring Car Championship in 1969, 1971–72, 1974–77 and from 1979 until the circuits closure in 1987.
"* The 1977 ATCC round at Surfers was the Rothmans 300 endurance race"

Numerous endurance races were staged at the circuit, most notably the Rothmans 12 Hour events.

Dominique Moulon began his activities as an art historian of new media art and computer art by obtaining a Diplôme National Supérieur d’Expression Plastique in 1987 from the Ecole Nationale Supérieure d’Art in Bourges France. In 1993 he obtained a Diplôme d’Etudes Approfondies en esthétique, sciences et technologies des arts from the University of Paris VIII.
In 2002 he completed an extensive research project called "Outils et Création Numérique", which in detail conveyed the techniques computer artists were using in France. He paid close attention to interactivity and developed a philosophical investigation of the real and the virtual, and its multisensory nature by stressing an aesthetics of technology. This work was conducted for the Recherche et Innovation de la Délégation aux Arts Plastiques du ministère de la Culture et de la Communication. Here Moulon began his work documenting the historical record of the relationship between technology and digital forms of art, extending the historic work of Frank Popper, Jack Burnham and Gene Youngblood. Key to his initial thinking and activities as an aesthetician, cultural theorist, curator, teacher, and art critic was his encounter with the work of Pierre Restany, Jean-Louis Boissier, Roy Ascott, Edmond Couchot, Christine Buci-Glucksmann and Fred Forest.
Working with the Délégation au Développement et aux Affaires Internationales, in 2004 he created a website to share his research at nouveauxmedias.net. He also is responsible for the digital art section of the French paper magazine "Images Magazine" and was a visiting instructor in 2007 at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.

Wright Omega function

In mathematics, the Wright omega function or Wright function, denoted ω, is defined in terms of the Lambert W function as:
Uses.
One of the main applications of this function is in the resolution of the equation "z" = ln("z"), as the only solution is given by "z" = "e"−ω("π" "i").
"y" = ω("z") is the unique solution, when formula_2 for "x" ≤ −1, of the equation "y" + ln("y") = "z". Except on those two rays, the Wright omega function is continuous, even analytic.
Properties.
The Wright omega function satisfies the relation formula_3.
It also satisfies the differential equation
wherever ω is analytic (as can be seen by performing separation of variables and recovering the equation formula_5), and as a consequence its integral can be expressed as:
Its Taylor series around the point formula_7 takes the form :

SS Dakotan

SS "Dakotan" was a cargo ship built in 1912 for the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company that served as a transport ship under the United States Army in World War I, and then was transferred to the Soviet Union under Lend-Lease in World War II before being finally scrapped in 1969. During World War I, she was taken over by the United States Army as USAT "Dakotan". Near the end of that war she was transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned as USS "Dakotan" (ID-3882). During World War II, the ship was transferred to the Soviet Union and renamed SS "Zyrianin (or Зырянин" in Cyrillic).
"Dakotan" was built by the Maryland Steel Company as one of eight sister ships for the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company, and was employed in inter-coastal service via the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and the Panama Canal after it opened. During World War I, as USAT "Dakotan", the ship carried cargo and animals to France. "Dakotan" was in the first American convoy to sail to France after the United States entered the war in April 1917. In Navy service, USS "Dakotan" carried cargo to France and returned over 8,800 American troops after the Armistice.
After her Navy service ended in 1919, she was returned to her original owners and resumed relatively uneventful cargo service over the next twenty years. "Dakotan" ran aground off the coast of Mexico in 1923 but was freed and towed to port for repairs. Early in World War II, the ship was requisitioned by the War Shipping Administration and transferred to the Soviet Union under the terms of Lend-Lease in December 1942. Sailing as SS "Zyrianin", the ship remained a part of the Soviet merchant fleet into the late 1960s.
Design and construction.
In September 1911, the American-Hawaiian Steamship Company placed an order with the Maryland Steel Company of Sparrows Point, Maryland, for four new cargo ships—, "Dakotan", , and . The contract cost of the ships was set at the construction cost plus an 8% profit for Maryland Steel, but with a maximum cost of $640,000 per ship. The construction was financed by Maryland Steel with a credit plan that called for a 5% down payment in cash with nine monthly installments for the balance. The deal had provisions that allowed some of the nine installments to be converted into longer-term notes or mortgages. The final cost of "Dakotan", including financing costs, was $66.00 per deadweight ton, which totaled just under $672,000.
"Dakotan" (Maryland Steel yard no. 125) was the second ship built under the original contract. She was launched on 10 August 1912, and delivered to American-Hawaiian in November. "Dakotan" was , and was in length and abeam. She had a deadweight tonnage of and a storage capacity of . A single steam engine with oil-fired boilers driving a single screw propeller provided her power; her speed was . The steamer had accommodations for 18 officers, 40 crewmen, and could carry up to 16 passengers.
Early career.
When "Dakotan" began sailing for American-Hawaiian, the company shipped cargo from East Coast ports via the Tehuantepec Route to West Coast ports and Hawaii, and vice versa. Shipments on the Tehuantepec Route arrived at Mexican ports—Salina Cruz, Oaxaca, for eastbound cargo, and Coatzacoalcos for westbound cargo—and traversed the Isthmus of Tehuantepec on the Tehuantepec National Railway. Eastbound shipments were primarily sugar and pineapple from Hawaii, while westbound cargoes were general in nature. "Dakotan" sailed in this service on the east side of North America.
At the time of the United States occupation of Veracruz on 21 April 1914, "Dakotan" was in port at Coatzacoalcos. There she loaded 127 American refugees from sugar plantations in the area and steamed to Veracruz. As a consequence of the American action, the Huerta-led Mexican government closed the Tehuantepec National Railway to American shipping.
In early May, "The New York Times" reported that "Dakotan" had sailed to Cristóbal to pick up a cargo of sugar that had been originally slated for transport via Tehuantepec. According to the article, the sugar was to be carried on barges through the still-unopened Panama Canal, then loaded onto "Dakotan". There was no indication in the newspaper whether this mission was completed or not, but it is known that American-Hawaii returned to its historic route of sailing cargo around South America via the Straits of Magellan after Tehuantepec was closed but before the canal opened.
With the opening of the Panama Canal on 15 August, American-Hawaiian ships switched to using the canal. In early September, American-Hawaiian announced that "Dakotan" would sail on a route from New York via the canal to San Francisco and on to either Seattle or Tacoma. When landslides closed the canal in October 1915, all American-Hawaiian ships, including "Dakotan", returned to the Straits of Magellan route.
In 1916, "Dakotan" was one of several American-Hawaiian cargo ships chartered by the DuPont Nitrate Company to carry sodium nitrate from Chile to the United States. "Dakotan" and the other cargo ships in this South American service would typically deliver loads of coal, gasoline, or steel in exchange for the sodium nitrate. In May, "The Christian Science Monitor" reported on what may have been a typical delivery for "Dakotan". The ship had left Tocopilla with 91,872 bags—about —of sodium nitrate for use in making explosives, and, after transiting the newly reopened Panama Canal, arrived in Philadelphia.
World War I.
After the United States declared war on Germany in April 1917, the United States Army, needing transports to move its men and materiel to France, convened a select committee of shipping executives who pored over registries of American shipping to evaluate transport capabilities. The committee selected "Dakotan", her sister ship "Montanan", and twelve other American-flagged ships that were sufficiently fast, could carry enough fuel in their bunkers for transatlantic crossings, and, most importantly, were in port or not far at sea. After "Dakotan" discharged her last load of cargo, she was officially handed over to the Army on 29 May.
Before troop transportation began, all of the ships were hastily refitted. Of the fourteen ships, four, including "Dakotan" and "Montanan", were designated to carry animals and cargo; the other ten were designated to carry human passengers. Ramps and stalls were built on the four ships chosen to carry animals. Gun platforms were installed on each ship before it docked at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where the guns were put in place. All the ships were manned by merchant officers and crews but carried military personnel: two U.S. Navy officers, Navy gun crews, quartermasters, signalmen, and wireless operators. The senior Navy officer on board would take control if a ship came under attack.
The American convoy carrying the first units of the American Expeditionary Force was separated into four groups; "Dakotan" was in the fourth group with her sister ship "Montanan", Army transports and , and accompanied by the group's escorts: cruiser , U.S. Navy transport , and destroyers , , and . "Dakotan" departed with her group on the morning of 17 June for Brest, France, steaming at an pace. A thwarted submarine attack on the first convoy group, and reports of heavy submarine activity off of Brest resulted in a change in the convoy's destination to Saint-Nazaire.
"Dakotan" departed Saint-Nazaire on 14 July in the company of her convoy mates "El Occidente", "Montanan", and "Edward Luckenbach". Joining the return trip were Army transport , Navy armed collier , Navy oiler , and cruiser , the flagship of Rear Admiral Albert Gleaves, the head of the Navy's Cruiser and Transport Force.
Sources do not reveal "Dakotan"s movements over the next months, but on 6 September 1917, the Naval Armed Guardsmen aboard "Dakotan" shelled a German submarine after its periscope had been sighted. On 29 January 1919, "Dakotan" was transferred to the Navy and commissioned the same day, with Lieutenant Commander J. Simmons, , in command. Outfitted for service as a troop transport to return American servicemen from Europe, "Dakotan" made five transatlantic roundtrips to France as part of the Navy's Cruiser and Transport Force between 15 February and 20 July. Eastbound journeys delivered cargo to Saint-Nazaire and Bordeaux for the Army of Occupation; westbound trips returned soldiers to the United States. "Dakotan" carried a total of 8,812 troops on her five westbound voyages. "Dakotan" returned from her final voyage on 20 July, was decommissioned at New York on 31 July, and returned to American-Hawaiian the same day.
Interwar years.
"Dakotan" resumed cargo service with American-Hawaiian after her return from World War I service. Although the company had abandoned its original Hawaiian sugar routes, "Dakotan" continued inter-coastal service through the Panama Canal in a relatively uneventful manner over the next twenty years. One incident of note occurred on 20 August 1923 when "Dakotan" issued distress calls after she ran aground at Cabo San Lázaro on the Pacific coast of Mexico. The Navy transport ship and the Standard Oil tanker "Charles Pratt" responded to "Dakotan"s calls. "Charles Pratt" successfully freed "Dakotan", which had suffered damage to her rudder post in the accident. The American-Hawaiian ship "Nevadan" arrived and towed "Dakotan" to Los Angeles for repairs.
In 1933, two members of "Dakotan"s crew had medical emergencies that received news coverage. The first, in February, involved a seaman with an abdominal disorder. He was transferred from the eastbound "Dakotan" to the Dollar Line ocean liner which carried him to Los Angeles to receive medical attention. The second occurred in July when "Dakotan"s quartermaster came down with appendicitis near Balboa. Radio calls for assistance brought the U.S. Navy's Destroyer Division 7 to "Dakotan"s aid. The destroyer unit's medical officer boarded "Dakotan" and performed an appendectomy on the man, who was too ill to be moved off the ship.
World War II and later career.
After the United States entered World War II, in 1941 - though most of Europe had been involved since summer 1939 - "Dakotan" was requisitioned by the War Shipping Administration (WSA), but continued to be operated by American-Hawaiian. In December 1942, "Dakotan" was transferred to the Soviet Union under Lend-Lease, and renamed "Zyrianin" ("Зырянин" ). Throughout the rest of the war, "Dakotan" made at least one trip to the United States, being photographed in port at San Francisco in August 1943. Near the end of World War II, the WSA offered a payment of $670,210 to American-Hawaiian for the former "Dakotan" as part of a $7.2 million settlement for eleven American-Hawaiian ships that had been requisitioned by the WSA. "Zyrianin" remained a part of the Soviet merchant fleet through the 1960s, and was listed in "Lloyd's Register" until the 1970–71 edition.
"Zyrianin" was operated by the Far East Shipping Company (FESCO) from 1943 to 1957. From 1957, she was operated by the Black Sea Shipping Company. The ship was written off and scrapped at Split, Yugoslavia in 1969.

Frederic Charles Hirons

Frederic Charles Hirons (1883 – New York, January 23, 1942) was the American architect, based in New York, who designed the Classical George Rogers Clark National Memorial, in Vincennes, Indiana, among the last major Beaux-Arts style public works in the United States, completed in 1933.
Hirons was of French extraction; he immigrated to Massachusetts as a child. Hirons worked as a draftsman in the Boston architectural office of Herbert Hale from 1898 until 1901, before entering the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; on graduating in 1904 he received a Rotch Travelling Scholarship to study at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. MIT's Paris prize enabled him to continue his European studies until 1909. 
On his return he established an architectural practice in New York with Ethan Allen Dennison (1881–1954). Hirons and Dennison produced many commercial structures in the Beaux-Arts and Art Deco styles: Delaware Title & Insurance Company, Wilmington, Delaware; Federal Trust Company Building, Newark; City National Bank, Bridgeport, Connecticut; Home Savings Bank, Albany, New York; State Bank & Trust Company, West 43rd Street and 8th Avenue, New York; Beaux-Arts Institute of Design, 304 East 44th Street; Suffolk Title and Guarantee Company Building, 90-04 161st Street, Queens, New York. Their Childs Restaurant, Coney Island, New York (1923), employs colorfully glazed terracotta tiles in a fanciful resort style combining elements of the Spanish Colonial revival with numerous maritime allusions that refer to its seaside location". The Davidson County Courthouse of 1936 by Hirons and Dennison (with involvement of Nashville local architect Emmons H. Woolwine) is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
In 1929 Hirons formed a two-year partnership with F.W. Mellor of Philadelphia, and then practiced again under his own name until 1940, when he retired.
He designed many public buildings, including the World War I memorial at Worcester, Massachusetts and the Clark Memorial at Vincennes, Indiana.
He was president of the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design (1937–39), of which he had been a founder. He taught architecture at Yale University and Columbia University. His portrait by Henry R. Rittenberg is in the collection of the National Academy of Design.

2009 British Touring Car Championship season

The 2009 HiQ MSA British Touring Car Championship season was the 52nd British Touring Car Championship (BTCC) season. It began at Brands Hatch on the Indy layout on April 5 and finished after 30 races over 10 events on the Grand Prix layout at Brands Hatch on October 4. Colin Turkington won the championship for the first time, ahead of Jason Plato and Fabrizio Giovanardi.
The season also saw Airwaves BMW score their first win in the series when Rob Collard won the second race of the day at the opening meeting at Brands Hatch. The team seemed to have added a second win in race three as Jonathan Adam crossed the line first but he was demoted to second after making contact with Jason Plato handing Plato the win.
Andrew Jordan became the youngest driver to qualify on pole at Donington after team-mate Fabrizio Giovanardi was excluded for failing technical checks.
Also, Stephen Jelley took his first win in the series at the first race at Rockingham. He followed this up with another victory in race 3, a race that saw Tom Chilton become the first driver to score a podium position in a Ford Focus following a collision between Plato, Turkington and Plato's team mate James Nash.
At the final meeting at Brands Hatch, Chilton took pole position becoming the first Ford driver to do so since 2000. All three races were won by Jason Plato, becoming only the second driver to do so following Dan Eaves' hat-trick at Thruxton in 2005; but this was not enough to win the title. Colin Turkington became British Touring Car Champion for the first time, coincidentally becoming the first Northern Irishman to do so.
Former British Grand Prix winner Johnny Herbert contested the final three meetings in a Team Dynamics Honda Civic.

Society of the Faith

The Society of the Faith is a Church of England charity founded in 1905. Its objects are to bring together Christians in communion with the See of Canterbury for mutual assistance, and to support and further charitable undertakings, particularly those that popularise the Catholic faith. It is registered with the Charity Commission.
History.
The Society was founded in August 1905, by two brothers, the Revd Canon John Albert Douglas, then Vicar of St Luke, Camberwell, and the Revd C E Douglas, both notable figures in the Anglo Catholic revival. The object of the Society was to create –
"an Association of Christians in communion with the See of Canterbury for mutual assistance in the work of Christ's Church and for the furtherance of such charitable undertakings as may from time to time be decided upon, more especially for the popularisation of the Catholic faith."
The Douglas brothers also intended to create a collegiate institution with resident and non-resident members, but this never came into being.
In 1926 the Society became a charitable limited company. In 1935, it took on the lease of Faith House in Westminster, which provided a base for activities of the Society, in particular a bookshop for the Faith Press and workspaces for Faith-Craft (see below). Faith House had been built as a church institute for the parish of St John the Evangelist, Westminster. The parish church of this parish was bombed in World War II and is now a concert hall.
Faith Press.
The Revd C E Douglas had the idea of encouraging attendance at Sunday School by a system of stamp collecting. The stamps were originally printed in London. Douglas moved the enterprise to Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire where a local printer, Henry Rutherford, began producing the stamps. This was so successful that in July 1907 the Faith Press was founded, at first in a converted cow-shed behind a pub, but from 1910 in a converted brewery in Leighton Buzzard.
In 1909 the Manchester based "Church Printing Company" was taken over by the Society and run as the Manchester Faith Press. It closed in 1921 as a consequence of the post-first World War depression.
The main company flourished, and became a limited liability company in 1913. As well as the "stamps" it published religious books, various periodicals and from 1917 church music. From 1915 a parish insert called The Symbol was printed, to provide Anglo-Catholic priests with good material for sermons and other instructions.
Rising costs and reduced demand led to Faith Press being closed down in 1973.
Faith-Craft Studio.
In 1916 the Society began to make vestments to order. The business grew and in 1921 Faith-Craft was founded. From 1938 a workshop for joinery and statue work was opened in St Albans, Hertfordshire, with vestments and stained-glass being produced at Faith House. In 1955 Faith-Craft works moved to new premises in the Abbey Mill in St Albans. The post-war restoration and furnishing of St Mary-le-Bow, Cheapside from 1956 to 1964 was Faith-Craft's largest single commission; everything was made by Faith-Craft including the stained glass windows, designed by John Hayward. By the end of the 1960s changes in fashions in church furnishings had changed, reducing demand and the costs of running the businesses were rising. As a result in 1973 the Society closed down Faith-Craft.
The Society and Eastern Churches.
The Douglas brothers had travelled in the Near East and were ahead of their time in having an interest in the Eastern Churches. As a result the Society had a role in the foundation of the Catholic Literature Association and the Anglican and Eastern Churches Association. It also supported the Nikaean Club and provided grants for visiting Orthodox theological students.
Difficult times.
Charles Douglas died in 1955 and his brother John in 1956. For the next twenty years, the Faith Press and Faith-Craft Studio continued to produce notable works. Faith Press published the Archbishop of Canterbury’s Lent Book as well as important texts such as Peter Anson’s ‘Building up the Waste Places’. Faith-Craft, using distinguished designers such as John Hayward and Francis Stephens, created high quality stained glass and ornaments. But costs were rising and tastes were changing. In the late 1960s, Watts and Company moved into Faith House to take the place of Faith-Craft. In the 1970s, the Society, led by its Secretary, Ivor Bulmer-Thomas, invited the Church Union into Faith House to run the bookshop. Faith House continued to be an iconic building but the cost of running it was becoming a serious burden for the Society.
The Society today.
By the late 1990s, the board of trustees knew that it needed to take urgent action to make Faith House self-financing and to provide income to pursue its objects. It obtained permission from the freeholders to let out the top floor for profit and, although its main tenant was a charity serving young people in developing countries, the income enabled the Society to restore its finances. With Watts and Company now in the basement, the Society found itself in the position of that unusual phenomenon, a benevolent landlord, fostering good relations with its tenants, which included a bookshop run by SPCK from 2003–2006, followed by the St Stephen the Great Charitable Trust (SSG) until its closure in April 2008. The ground floor is now in active use as the headquarters of Restless Development, a charity for young people.
The main activities of the Society are now -
The Society is administered by trustees, known as the Court of Fellows, assisted by the Secretary and Treasurer.

Budweiser Bier Bürgerbräu

__NOTOC__
' or ' was (since 1802 and as trademark officially since 1899) the name for the beer and the administration of the "" (German for "Civic Brewhouse Budweis"), which in 1795 was founded by the German-speaking burghers of the Bohemian city of Budweis in the Kingdom of Bohemia). In 1894, the official company name was "".
As early as 1875, beer was being exported to the United States where Budweiser (like Pilsner) was already being copied by local brewers like Anheuser-Busch. In 1895, when Budweiser Bürgerbräu became official court supplier to the King of Württemberg, the growing Czech population founded local competition as a joint stock company, today called Budějovický Budvar. In the Budweiser trademark dispute, the three companies divided the rights to use the name, with the Europe-based companies giving up the Northern American rights to "Budweiser".
Bohemia constituted part of the new Republic of Czechoslovakia founded following the breakup of the Habsburg Empire at the end of World War I in 1918. In 1945, all Germans were expelled and both breweries expropriated. The German-sounding names of the company and its products were not welcome, and all rights had to be dropped or were otherwise lost, with beer being sold as "Crystal" or "Samson". Accordingly in 1960 and 1989 the company was renamed, to "První budějovický pivovar Samson" (First Budweiser brewery Samson).
After the fall of communism, the company owned rights to "Crystal", "Czech Beer Crystal", "Biere Tcheque Crystal" and "Samson", but soon reacquired national naming rights and international Protected Geographical Indication, in 1991 to "" and "", and in 1993 to "", "", "Biere de Budweis" and "Budweis Beer".
Since July 2001 the company is called (Budweiser citizens brewery), which corresponds to the original German name. The company uses German naming like "" also in Czech and English context, also stating that the hops comes from the "Czech city of Saaz (Zatec)" despite this city also has an old Czech name (Žatec).
Since 2005, due to the legal situation, the brewery offers its beer in the USA as "B.B. Bürgerbräu - since 1795", described as "Budweis City Bier"
Brands.
Except for the USA, where it has to be sold as "B. B. Bürgerbräu", the company marks its beers with "Budweiser Bier" (in German).
Since 2007 they have sold 1795 Budweiser under the name Boheme 1795 in the UK through Tesco supermarkets.

W. J. Spain

William J. Spain was a famous Irish dual player. He played Gaelic football with his local club Commercials and with the Limerick senior inter-county team in the 1880s. Spain also played hurling with his local club Kickhams and with the Dublin senior inter-county team in the 1880s.
Playing career.
Club.
Although born just outside Nenagh, County Tipperary, Spain first came to prominence as a Gaelic footballer with the Commercials club in Limerick. The club enjoyed much success in the infant years of the Gaelic Athletic Association. Spain captured a senior county title with the club in 1887.
Spain later moved to Dublin and joined the famous Kickhams club. Here he enjoyed further success, however, this time it was on the hurling field. He won a senior county title with that club in 1889.
Inter-county.
In 1887 the very first All-Ireland championship took place in football. Only four teams participated that year and Spain was a member of the Limerick inter-county team. The county’s first outing in their championship campaign saw Tipperary provided the opposition. That game ended in a draw; however, Limerick secured the victory in the replay by 1-9 to 0-4. The next game was the All-Ireland final and Limerick played Louth. The game itself was a close, low-scoring affair. Spain turned out to be the hero of the game. Eleven minutes into the second-half he scored a goal after a long dribbling run for his own 21-yard line. Limerick won the game by 1-4 to 0-3 and Spain collected his first All-Ireland title.
Two years later in 1889 Spain was a key member of the Dublin hurling team. That year Dublin got a walkover from Laois in the Leinster final. This victory allowed Spain’s side advance directly to the All-Ireland final. Clare provided the opposition on that occasion and an exciting game followed. The Clare team, who played the game in their bare feet, took a half-time lead of 1-5 to 1-0. ‘The Dubs’ fought back in the second-half with Spain scoring a hat trick of goals as Clare collapsed. Dublin won the game by 5-1 to 1-6, giving Spain an All-Ireland hurling title to match his football one. In doing son he became the first All-Ireland-winning dual player in the history of Gaelic games.
Spain’s career ended shortly afterwards as he emigrated to the United States in 1890.

Quantum threshold theorem

In quantum computing, the (quantum) threshold theorem (or quantum fault-tolerance theorem), proved by Michael Ben-Or and Dorit Aharonov (along with other groups), states that a quantum computer with noise can quickly and accurately simulate an ideal quantum computer, provided the level of noise is below a certain threshold. Practically, the Threshold Theorem implies that the error in quantum computers can be controlled as the number of qubits scales up.

Portuguese irregular forces in the Overseas War

In various theaters of operations in the Portuguese Colonial War arose at the outset the need to create various types of irregular forces to help the Portuguese Armed Forces.
These irregular forces were usually held at the local level of Theater of Operations and included various types in terms of origin and dependence: militias of white settlers, native militias and forces, foreign forces from exile, forces of ex-guerrillas, dependent forces the Civil Administration, forces dependent on the armed forces and forces dependent on the PIDE.
Officially the totality of these forces was known by Auxiliary Forces. In Portuguese Guinea, General Spínola introduced the term African Force to designate the irregular forces composed of natives of the province.
In Theater of Operations, the main irregular forces were as follows:

Teboil

Oy Teboil Ab is an oil company in Finland, engaged in the marketing, sales and distribution of Petroleum product, and service station activities. It is a subsidiary of the Russian company Lukoil.
History.
Teboil was established by Estonian shale oil company Eesti Kiviõli in Helsinki in 1934 at the name Trustivapaa Bensiini (meaning: "Trust-free Petrol"), abbr. "TB", from which came the current name in 1966. Another predecessor of Teboil, Suomen Petrooli, was established by German investors in Vyborg in 1932. During World War II, the ownership of Trustivapaa Bensiini was transferred to German owners and later the company was held by the Ehrnrooth's family. After the Continuation War, in 1947 according to the Paris Peace Treaty TB became affiliated and it became the property of the Soviet Union state-owned company Soyuznefteexport. In 1966, the company changed its name to Teboil, which came from the pronouncing of its abbreviation TB with addition 'oil'. During these years, the Finnish government enterprise Neste held a legal monopoly in the wholesale of oil products, thus also Teboil actually obtained its petrol and diesel from Neste.
There is some evidence that Teboil kept tank fuel reserves, in the case the Soviets would invade. These were discontinued after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
In 1994 Soyuznefteexport was privatized and reorganized into Nafta-Moskva. In 2005, Nafta-Moskva sold Teboil to Lukoil. Teboil acquired JET unmanned stations chain in Finland, from the American company ConocoPhillips in 2006 and they were integrated into the Teboil chain as Teboil Express unmanned stations in 2007. The lubricant factory and laboratory functions of Teboil was moved to the subsidiary "LLK Finland", founded in 2007. The three subsidiaries, Suomen Petrooli, Suomen Tähtihovit and Suomen Tähtiautomaatit were merged to the parent company in 2008.

<doc id="18409970" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18409970" title="Tarphycerida">
Tarphycerida

The Tarphycerida were the first of the coiled cephalopods. They are found in marine sediments from the Lower Ordovician (middle and upper Canad) to the Middle Devonian. Some like "Aphetoceras" and "Estonioceras" are loosely coiled, gyroconic, others like "Campbelloceras", "Tarphyceras", and "Trocholites" are tightly coiled, but evolute with all whorls showing. The body chamber of tarphycerids is typically long and tubular (Furnish and Glenister 1964), as much as half the length of the containing whorl in most, greater than in the Silurian Ophidioceratidae. 
The Tarphycerida evolved from the elongate, compressed, exogastric Bassleroceratidae, probably "Bassleroceras", around the end of the Gasconadian through forms like "Aphetoceras". Close coiling developed rather quickly and both gyroconic and evolute forms are found in the early middle Canadian. 
Tarphycerids tend to uncoil in the late mature stage of their growth, indicating they settled into a benthic lifestyle as they became older. Younger, wholly coiled forms were probably more active, nekto-benthic, certainly more maneuverable
Composition and taxonomy.
The Tarphycerida comprise three phylogenetically related groups of families. They are: the tarphyceratid group consisting of the Estonioceratidae, Tarphyceratidae, Trocholitidae, Lituitidae, and Ophidioceratidae; the barradeoceratid group, derived from "Centrotarphyceras" (Flower 1984), consisting of the Barrandeoceratidae, Bickmoritidae, Nephriticeratidae, and Uranoceratidae; and the plectoceratid group, derived from "Campbelloceras" ("ibid"), consisting of the Plectoceratidae, Lechritrochoceratidae, and Apsidoceratidae.
The tarphyceratids comprise the Tarphycerida of the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology Part K (Furnish and Glenister 1964) to which Flower added the ancestral Bassleroceratidae. The Estonioceratidae, Tarphyceratidae, and Trocholitidae are primitive forms characterized by siphuncles with thick-walled connecting rings. The Lituitidae and Ophidioceratidae are derived offshoots. 
The barrandeoceratid and Plectoceratid families were once combined in the Barrandeocerida (Sweet, 1964), determined by Flower (1984) to be invalid due to having multiple ancestors in the Tarphyceriatidae and therefor abandoned. The common character of these forms are the thin-walled connecting rings in their siphuncles. 
Some recent classifications (e.g. Teichert 1988) divide the Tarphycerida into to suborders, the Tarphycerina and Barrandeocerina, which were previously defined as separate orders.
Broader relationships.
Tarphycerids are more closely related to the diverse Oncocerida, through the ancestral Bassleroceratidae in the Lower Ordovician, than to the other nautiloid orders. The Oncocerida in turn gave rise to the Nautilida which includes the recent "Nautilus" and "Allonautilus". This puts the Tarphycerida in the broad group that includes the nautilids. It makes them also separate from the groups that include the Discosorida, Actinocerida, Endocerida, and Orthocerida, and from the superficially similar Ammonoidea .( Teichert and Moore 1964, Wade 1988)
Tarphycerid biology.
The tarphycerid animal must have been rather elongate, like squid, although no close relationship is implied. Either that or it was able to retreat deep into its portable lair. As for what ever arms or tentacles they may have had, there is no indication. What may be surmised is that they went through two stages, first a younger more active and swimming stage with simple coiled shells, followed by a less active bottom dwelling stage with shells that diverge during which they mated and produced, probably, a single litter of young, like the modern but unrelated coleoids.

Billy Mackessy

William ‘Billy’ Mackessy was an Irish sportsperson. A dual player with his local club Blackrock he played both hurling and Gaelic football with the Cork senior inter-county teams from 1901 until 1912.
Playing career.
Club.
Mackessy played his club hurling and Gaelic football with Blackrock and enjoyed much success. He won his first senior county hurling title in 1903 and added a second county medal to his collection in 1908. Mackessy finished off his club hurling career by capturing a four-in-a-row in 1910, 1911, 1912 and 1913.
Inter-county.
Mackessy first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Cork football team in 1901. That year he won his first Munster as Cork defeated Limerick in the provincial decider by 1-9 to 1-6. Cork later trounced Mayo in the All-Ireland semi-final before lining out against Dublin in the ‘home’ All-Ireland final. The game was a low-scoring affair with ‘the Dubs’ winning by 1-2 to 0-4.
Two years later in 1903 Mackessy was a member of the Cork hurling team. That year he added a Munster hurling title to his collection as Cork trounced Waterford in the provincial final. Mackessy’s side later got a walkover from Galway allowing the team to advance to the ‘home’ All-Ireland final with Kilkenny. That game turned into a rout as ‘the Rebels’ won easily by 8-9 to 0-8. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw London provide the opposition. Once again that game turned into a rout as Cork won by 3-16 to 1-1. It was Mackessy’s first All-Ireland hurling medal.
Two years later in 1905 Cork were still the kingpins of Munster hurling. Mackessy captured a second provincial hurling medal that year as Cork walloped Limerick by 7-12 to 1-4. For the second year in-a-row Kilkenny later took on Cork in the All-Ireland final. Cork won the game by 5-10 to 3-13; however, the game had to be replayed for a number of reasons. Firstly, Cork goalkeeper Daniel McCarthy was a British army reservist and, secondly, Kilkenny’s Matt Gargan had played with Waterford before playing for Kilkenny. The replay produced another high-scoring, however, Kilkenny won the game by 7-7 to 2-9.
In 1906 Mackessy was back with the Cork football team. He collected a second Munster football medal that year as Cork defeated Kerry by 1-10 to 0-3. Cork subsequently qualified for the All-Ireland final and, once again, Dublin provided the opposition. Mackessy’s side took the lead at half-time, however, ‘the Dubs’ fought back to win the game on a low score line of 0-5 to 0-4.
Cork made it two Munster football titles in-a-row in 1907 as Cork had a nine-point victory over Tipperary. For the second year in-a-row Cork later played Dublin in the All-Ireland final. The game was delayed because the train carrying the Dublin team to the match location in Tipperary was delayed. In spite of this Dublin still won the game by 0-6 to 0-2. It was Mackessy’s third defeat in an All-Ireland football final.
In 1911 Cork won another Munster football title, however, Mackessy was not on the team. He returned to the Cork set up for the subsequent All-Ireland final. Antrim provided the opposition on that occasion as an Ulster team contested their first final. Antrim got off to a good start and scored the first goal, however, Cork replied with a goal. Mackessy scored a goal at the start of the second-half and added two more over the course of the thirty minutes. Cork won the game by 6-6 to 1-2 giving Mackessy an All-Ireland medal and the honour of becoming the second dual player to have All-Ireland medals in both codes.
In 1912 Mackessy was back with the Cork hurling team. That year he captured a third Munster hurling medal as Tipperary fell in the provincial final. Kilkenny provided the opposition on that occasion in a low-scoring but close All-Ireland final. A 2-1 to 1-3 scor eline gave 'the Cats' the victory.

Glenfield Park is a county park in Montclair and a small part in Glen Ridge, both in Essex County, New Jersey. It has in Montclair, and in Glen Ridge. It shares a name with the nearby Glenfield Middle School. Glenfield Park is part of the Essex County Park System.
Creation.
In 1910, the land for the park was given by the town of Montclair to the Essex County Park system. The Park was then designed by the Olmsted Brothers, a famous landscape design firm.
Overview.
Glenfield Park, from the Maple Avenue side, looks like a collection of athletic fields with paths and trees between. There is more however. Behind the Playgrounds, Baseball diamonds, and tennis courts there is a forest with tall trees and thick ground cover. Through it goes paved and unpaved trails, and also a stream, Toney's Brook. This area is home to much wildlife and is the only natural terrain of its caliber for miles around. The railroad is discreetly hidden behind the brook.
The area containing the brook, known as the Glen, is overgrown and is hard to navigate. There are a few small arch bridges which cross the brook and connect walking paths, but one has been cordoned off and closed due to its deterioration.
Location.
Glenfield Park is in south eastern Montclair, New Jersey, near the border with Glen Ridge. It is Bordered in the south by Woodland Avenue, and in the West by Maple Avenue. On the East it is Bordered by New Jersey Transit's Montclair-Boonton Line. It's also bordered in the Northeast by Bloomfield Avenue, the main road in Montclair.

Serious Charge

Serious Charge is a 1959 film now most notable for being Cliff Richard’s screen acting début in a very minor supporting role, playing a layabout teenage musician called Curley Thompson.
The film was adapted from a stage play written by Philip King. One of the teenage delinquent gang members was played by another 1950s rock and roll star, the uncredited Jess Conrad in an early acting performance.
Plot.
The unmarried vicar Reverend Howard Phillips (Anthony Quayle), newly arrived in a parish, accuses a local 19 year old thug and petty criminal, Larry Thompson (Andrew Ray) of being partially responsible for the recent death of a teenage girl (Leigh Madison). In retaliation and as an attempt to divert attention, the teenager accuses the vicar of molesting him. His invented story is substantiated out of spite by another local woman still furious that the vicar rejected her amorous advances. Unfortunately for the vicar, the woman is a highly respected member of the community, her father being the parish’s previous clergyman.
The film features musical performances by Cliff Richard and the Shadows, still called the Drifters at the time. Richard plays the thug’s younger brother. He barely speaks in the film, other than to sing three songs in coffee bar scenes.

Ulceby with Fordington

Ulceby with Fordington is a civil parish in the East Lindsey district of Lincolnshire, England. The parish is situated east from the city and county town of Lincoln and south-west from Alford. The A1028 road runs through the parish.
Also known as Ulceby by Alford and Ulceby cum Fordington, the principal settlements are Ulceby, a village, and Fordington, a small hamlet, which was once a Roman Camp. 
History.
In the early 1870s John Marius Wilson described the parish as:
Ulceby, a parish in Spilsby district, Lincoln; 2½ miles SW of Alford r. station. Post town, Alford. Acres, 2,220. Real property, £1,622. Pop., 212. Houses, 38. The manor belongs to Capt. Mansell. The living is a rectory in the diocese of Lincoln. Value, £650.* Patron, the Rev. W. A. Peacock. The church is good.
From 1894 to 1974 Ulceby with Fordington parish was part of Spilsby Rural District.
Within the All Saints Church in Ulceby, there are various memorials dedicated to soldiers from the First and Second World Wars. The First World War memorial is a plaque in which seven names are held, which was unveiled in May 1920. The Second World War memorial holds two names and is a similar but smaller plaque located in the All Saints Church. There is also an individual memorial plaque to the memory of Captain George Mansel, who died in September 1884. There is also an RAF war memorial made of granite at the junction of the A16 road. It was placed there on the 50th anniversary of the Lancaster PB 476 (PHY) aircraft which crashed near the placement of the memorial due to a Luftwaffe intruder. Before 1921 the children of Ulceby with Fordington attended a school in Well, a parish situated south-west from Alford. In 1912 the parish built a County Council School which most children from the parish now attend. There was once an Anglican church in the hamlet of Fordington, however no trace of it remains.
Parish.
The main place of worship in Ulceby with Fordington is named All Saints Church, of which registers have been recorded since 1749 and a chapel was built here by Wesleyan Methodists in 1863. All Saints Church is an Anglican parish church located in Ulceby village. Seating approximately 120, the church was rebuilt in 1826 and restored in 1885. Ulceby with Fordington is one of 189 parishes within the district of East Lindsey. A hill named "The Bull's Head" is a noted landmark in the parish.
Demographics and housing.
Between 1801 and 1911, the population has varied only by 58 people, having a minimum of 160 residents in 1891 and maximum of 218 in 1831. Census data of March 2011 highlights that the population was at 147 with 61 dwellings, noting that this parish is not very populated. Census data further states that 102 of these inhabitants class themselves as Christian and 2 are another religion. The other 13 did not state their religion and 30 of these people are not religious. Of 147 inhabitants in 2011, 144 lived in a whole house or a bungalow, with the other 3 inhabitants living in caravans or other temporary housing. The majority of houses in the Parish have three to four bedrooms. Approximately 90 were listed as detached, 44 were semi-detached and 10 were terraced. None of these dwellings were shared, possibly highlighting that the population of Ulceby with Fordington is a more affluent area due to this housing trend.
Industry and economy.
In the 1801 census, the industry in the parish was divided into four sectors; agriculture, trade, manufacturing or handicraft. From 1841 onwards, the detail of occupations was more intricate and specifically recorded, listing over 3,000 job titles. As the pie charts show, in 1881, the most popular trades were agriculture, domestic services and working with animals. In 2001, 61 inhabitants were employed but the most common occupation was in manufacturing In the 2011 census data, it shows that out of 117 residents of working age or over, 77 were employed. The data shows that 15 worked part-time, 46 worked full-time, 13 were self-employed, 3 were unemployed and 21 were retired.

There were three such organizations raised by the Portuguese Government in their overseas provinces of Portuguese Angola, Portuguese Mozambique and Portuguese Timor.
The OPVDC had the tasks of auxiliary internal security force and civil defense organization, under the authority of the governor of the province. The OPVDC of Angola and Mozambique were engaged in the Portuguese Colonial War as auxiliary forces of the Portuguese Armed Forces.
In the Portuguese Overseas, the OPVDC were the correspondent of the Portuguese Legion in the European Portugal.
Angola.
Provincial Organization of Volunteers of Civil Defence of Angola (OPVDCA) - mainly urban militia, consisting mainly of white settlers. 
The OPVDCA was formed by officers of the asset or the reserve of the Armed Forces, but was dependent on the Civil Administration, and its maximum in the Governor-General of the province. The function of OPVDCA was essentially in defence of people, lines of communications and sensitive installations.
Members of OPVDCA volunteers were civilians who had their professions, serving in the organization part time. Initially the OPVDCA was constituted only by white settlers, but later it became increasingly multi-racial. At its peak the OPVDCA reached more than 40,000 staff.

2003 Hokkaidō earthquake

The 2003 Hokkaidō earthquake (aka 2003 Tokachi-Oki Earthquake ) occurred on September 25, 2003 in Hokkaidō, Japan. It measured 8.3 on the moment magnitude scale and caused extensive damage, destroying roads all around Hokkaidō, and caused several power outages and damaging landslides. A number of people were injured. The earthquake also caused a tsunami reaching 4 meters in height. The earthquake's presence was felt throughout Japan, stretching all the way to Honshu and Tokyo. The earthquake was the largest in 2003.
Tectonic setting.
The location and moment tensor solution of this earthquake are consistent with it being a result of thrust faulting between the North American Plate and the subducting Pacific plate. In addition to experiencing large thrust earthquakes that originate on the interface between the plates, eastern Hokkaidō experiences great earthquakes that originate from the interior of the subducted Pacific plate.
Damage.
The earthquake caused great damage, causing power outages, landslides, and destroying several ocean side home communities. Its epicenter was located about offshore, causing less damage had it occurred directly under the city, and an estimated cost was not given.
Regional seismicity.
The region has been rocked by a catastrophic earthquake and tsunami with an estimated magnitude of 9 in 1667, a magnitude 8.2 event in 1952, a 1968 quake measuring 8.3 Mw, and one in 2008 measuring 7.1, all bearing the name "Tokachi-Oki", and a 1973 quake to the immediate north along the Kuril Trench plate boundary called the 1973 Nemuro-Oki Earthquake.

Battle of Milazzo (1860)

The Battle of Milazzo was fought on 17–24 July 1860 between Giuseppe Garibaldi's volunteers with Hungarian veterans and the troops of the Kingdom of Two Sicilies at Milazzo, Sicily, then part of the Kingdom of Two Sicilies.
The main clash began on the morning of 20 July on an open field leading to the cape on which Milazzo is located. In the afternoon, after seven hours of fight, it moved towards the town itself. Here on a bridge, surrounded by the Neapolitan cavalry, Garibaldi was saved by an assault from Sicilian volunteers. The Garibaldines, after the initial difficulties, got steam from this success. Giacomo Medici, Giuseppe Sirtori and Enrico Cosenz attacked the Neapolitan troops, but were pushed back by general Beneventano's men.
Then came from Palermo the armed ship "Tukory", which bombarded the Neapolitans, who retreated to Milazzo's fortress. Here they capitulated on 24 July. Garibaldi had more than 800 killed, the Neapolitans c. 300.
This victory allowed Garibaldi free way to Messina.

Michael Wyschogrod

Michael Wyschogrod (born September 28, 1928) is a Jewish German-American philosopher of religion, Jewish theologian, and activist for Jewish-Christian interfaith dialog. During his academic career he taught in philosophy and religion departments of several universities in the United States, Europe, and Israel.
Early life.
Wyschogrod was the second child born to Paul Wyschogrod and Margaret Ungar in Berlin, Germany on September 28, 1928. His father was a famous chess master but discouraged his son from pursuing this interest. Paul Wyschogrod had moved his family to Berlin from Budapest after the breakup of the Austro-Hungarian Empire a decade earlier, yet Wyschogrod would commonly spend his summers in Budapest, visiting his maternal grandparents.
Education.
Wyschogrod is associated with the Modern Orthodox movement within Orthodox Judaism and the schools he attended as a child reflect the emphasis of this movement on combining high-quality Jewish and secular instruction. He attended the Orthodox Adas Yisroel school in Berlin and then, after emigrating to New York in 1939, the Yiddish-speaking "Yeshiva Torah Vodaas" day school in Brooklyn, New York, from which he graduated high school in 1945. It was here that Wyschogrod studied under Rabbi Schlomo Heiman, from whom he came to appreciate "that part of the Torah that cannot be written down but transmitted only in the being of the person whose everyday conduct exemplifies it." Subsequently he studied Talmud with Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik at Yeshiva University from 1946 to 1952.
He embarked upon the study of philosophy at City College of New York in 1946, where he found himself drawn into the study of Christian Theology after reading the work of Kierkegaard. He completed his B.S.S. in 1949. He then went on to graduate study in philosophy at Columbia University, where he earned his Ph.D. in 1953. He wrote a dissertation which was later published under the title "Kierkegaard and Heidegger: the Ontology of Existence."
Teaching career.
Wyschogrod taught philosophy at several CUNY colleges and served as the head of the Philosophy Department at Baruch College of the City University of New York. In 1992 he was appointed Professor of Religious Studies at the University of Houston. He has been a guest professor at many universities in Israel, Europe, and the United States such as Bar Ilan University in Israel, University of Bern in Switzerland and Yeshiva University in New York, among others.
Thought.
Wyschogrod has been concerned primarily, in his activism and in his scholarly work, with the relationship, especially the theological dialogue, between Judaism and Christianity. His book "Abraham's Promise: Judaism and Jewish-Christian Relations" makes an appeal for a new non-supersessionist Christian view of Judaism. If Judaism and Christianity are to have a stable and harmonious co-existence in the future, then Christianity must dispense with or, at the very least, not openly insist on a status for Judaism in which Judaism is considered an incomplete or antiquated religion.
At the same time, Wyschogrod urges from the Jewish side that Jews not pursue a fallacious dismissal of the divinity of Christ that operates on a priori grounds. In other words, while Jews - Wyschogrod included - can and perhaps even should reject the divinity of Christ, they should not do so by attempting to argue that God's Incarnation in man is somehow inconsistent with the teaching of the Hebrew Bible. On the contrary, there is much merit to the Christological position that posits "the indwelling of God in Israel by concentrating that indwelling in one Jew rather than leaving it diffused in the people of Jesus as a whole."
Even Wyschogrod's writing that focuses solely on Jewish theology could be said to show evidence of the importance in his thought of dialogue between Jewish and Christian theology. His emphasis on the radical and sublime shock and force of God's choice to enter human history in and through the people of Israel, a unilateral and non-abrogable event, shows an affinity with the thought of the Neo-Orthodox Protestant theologian Karl Barth, whose work Wyschogrod considered relevant to Jewish theologians.
Writings.
Wyschogrod's best-known work is "The Body of Faith: God in the People Israel" (1989; 2nd edition: "The Body of Faith: God and the People Israel"). His "Abraham's Promise: Judaism and Jewish-Christian Relations" (2004) is a collection of some of his most seminal essays on Jewish-Christian relations from throughout his career.

Swedish Serbs

Serbs () began migrating to Sweden in large numbers in the 1960s, as part of the migrant work-agreement signed with the Yugoslav government to help Sweden overcome its severe labour shortage. The Yugoslav wars saw another influx of Serbs.
History.
Serbs constituted a low percentage of the Swedish population prior to the 1960s. Some came after World War II, mostly seeking political asylum. The greatest proportion of Serbs came together with Greeks, Italians and Turks under the visa agreements in times of severe labour shortages or when particular skills were deficient within Sweden, as migrant workers (called "Arbetskraftsinvandring", see "gastarbeiter"). During the 1960s and 1970s, agreements were signed with the government of Yugoslavia to help Sweden overcome its severe labour shortage.
Bosnian and Croatian Serbs migrated in another wave during and after the Yugoslav wars. Another wave of Kosovar Serbs came during the Kosovo war in 1999.
Demographics.
The Swedish census data includes country of birth, but does not include ethnicity, descendants or naturalized people, thus, the total number of ethnic Serbs in Sweden is hard to define. Various estimations include 80,000 to 140,000. Aco Dragićević, writing for the Swedish-Serbian newspaper "dijaspora", wrote in 2002 that some 200,000 Yugoslavs, regardless of ethnic origin, migrated to Sweden during the Second Yugoslavia (1945-1992); of these, roughly 40% (ca. 80,000) he believed to be Serbs.
Culture.
Language.
The Serbs in Sweden are bilingual. The Serbian language is a rich contributor to the so-called Rinkeby Swedish, a sociolect (slang) of the Swedish language.
Religion.
In 1972 the first Serbian Orthodox parish (of "St. Nicholas") was formed in Västerås, prior to the forming the Serbs were headed by Swedish Orthodox priest Christofer Klasson, previously priest in the Church of Sweden. Later, the same year a parish was formed in Malmö (of "Saints Cyrils and Methodius") and in 1973 one in Stockholm (of "Saint Sava"). Later, parishes have been formed in Göteborg (of "Stefan Decanski"), Jönköping (of "Nativity of Mary"), Helsingborg (of "St Basil the Great") and one more in Stockholm. The parishes have their own head-priest.
In Malmö, 1982, the Church of Saint Cyril and Methodius was opened, the first Serbian church in Sweden. The parish of Saint Sava opened its church in Enskede, in 1983, the parish in Göteborg also has a church.
The parish in Malmö suffered several attacks in 1990, the premises were firebombed but the church was not damaged, the perpetrators were racist youths who were later convicted of arson.
The SOC has parishes and churches in the cities of:
Music.
Stockholm-based Östblocket and Macedonian-Swedish Andra Generationen are both Balkan Brass Bands, playing a musical style from southern Serbia.
Sport.
Swedish Serbs have been very successful in sports, among most notable are
The Stockholm Eagles is a Serbian-Swedish basketball team that has become very successful since its establishment in 2007. They won the Swedish second league (Basketettan) back to back 2011 and 2012 and became the only team in Sweden to win 34 victories in a row.

An Essay on the Art of Ingeniously Tormenting

An Essay on the Art of Ingeniously Tormenting was a conduct book written by Jane Collier and published in 1753. The "Essay" was Collier's first work, and operates as a satirical advice book on how to nag. It was modelled after Jonathan Swift's satirical essays, and is intended to "teach" a reader the various methods for "teasing and mortifying" one's acquaintances. It is divided into two sections that are organised for "advice" to specific groups, and it is followed by "General Rules" for all people to follow.
Although the work was written by Jane Collier, there are speculations as to who may have helped contribute to the content and style of the work, ranging from friends to fellow writers such as Sarah Fielding, Samuel Richardson and James Harris. There was only one edition printed during Collier's life, but there were many subsequent revisions and republications of the work.
Background.
In 1748, Collier was living with her brother Arthur in London. The conditions were not suitable, and she became the governess for Samuel Richardson's daughter, Patty, by 1750. Richardson was impressed by her understanding of Latin and Greek along with her ability to perform her domestic duties. During this time, Collier was living with Sarah Fielding, and Richardson would spend time discussing writing with them.
It was under Richardson's employment that she wrote "An Essay on the Art of Ingeniously Tormenting". It has been suggested that Richardson helped Collier write the work, but Richardson's lack of satirical skill has dispelled such ideas. Instead, it was probably James Harris and Fielding who helped craft the satire, and all three probably helped to edit the work. However, most of Collier's help came from Fielding, who was a close friend and shared many of her earlier works with Collier.
The first edition was printed by Richardson for Andrew Millar in 1753. A second edition of the "Essay" was published by Millar in 1757, two years after Collier's death, but with revisions made by her shortly after its first printing. Subsequently editions and revisions were published in 1795, 1804, 1805, 1806, 1808, 1809 and 1811.
An Essay.
The "Essay" is modelled on Jonathan Swift's satire "Instructions to Servants" (1746), and even mentions Swift directly, but Collier reverses the roles in Swift's satire and instead writes from a servant's perspective in the first book. All of her suggestions are to aid in the process of "teasing and mortifying".
She begins her work with an actual "Essay on the Art of Tormenting" that serves as an introduction, before dividing the book into two parts. In this introduction, the narrator claims:
"One strong objection, I know, will be made against my whole design, by people of weak consciences; which is, that every rule I shall lay down will be exactly opposite to the doctrine of Christianity. Greatly, indeed, in a Christian country, should I fear the forces of such an objection, could I perceive, that any one vice was refrained from on that account only. Both theft and murder are forbidden by God himself: yet can anyone say, that our lives and properties would be in the least secure, were it not for the penal laws of our country?"
Part the First is divided into four sections: "Instructions to Masters and Mistresses, concerning their Servants", "To the Patronesses of an Humble Companion", "To Parents" and "To the Husband". To the master and mistresses, the narrator claims that "you are no true lover of the noble game of Tormenting, if a good dinner, or any other convenience or enjoyment, can give you half the pleasure, as the teasing and mortifying a good industrious servant, who has done her very best to please you."
Part the Second is divided into four sections: "To Lovers", "To the Wife", "To the Friend" and "To your Good Sort of People; being an appendage to the foregoing chapter". To wives, she tells them to "Be out of humour when your husband brings company home: be angry, if he goes abroad without you; and troublesome, if he takes you with him." When speaking to friends, she argues that "injuries go nearest to us, that we neither deserve nor expect".
Added to the work are "General Rules for plaguing all your acquaintance; with the description of a party of pleasure" along with a "Conclusion" and "A Fable". As a general rule, the narrator says, "By all means avoid an evenness of behaviour. Be, sometimes, extremely glad to see people; and, at other times, let your behaviour be hardly within the rules of good breeding."
Critical response.
Most of her contemporaries had only good things to say about the work. Henry Fielding complimented Collier on the work by declaring she had "an Understanding more than Female, mixed with virtues almost more than human". This line was part of a greater poem written by Fielding and inscribed on a copy of his favourite book of Horace. This was one of Fielding's last actions before he left for Lisbon, where he died shortly after.
Later, Betty Rizzo described the work as the "best-known generic satire written in the eighteenth century by a woman". Martin and Ruthe Battestin stated that Collier was "an author of wit and spirit". Some critics find it interesting that Collier would "yoke" Richardson with those that he "felt especial antipathy" with: Swift and Fielding. Katherine Craik describes the work as "a courageous social satire published at a time when satires were usually written by and for men".

In the United States law of banking regulation, a bridge bank is a temporary bank organized by federal bank regulators to administer the deposits and liabilities of a failed bank. Under the Competitive Equality Banking Act (CEBA) of 1987, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is authorized to operate a failed bank for a period of up to three years, until a buyer can be found for its operations.
Under CEBA, when a FDIC-insured bank is in financial trouble, the FDIC "may establish a bridge bank to —

Bridge banks must be chartered as national banks. To the extent possible, bridge banks are required to honor the commitments of the failed bank to its customers, and not to interrupt or terminate adequately secured loans. Bridge banks are authorized to seek to liquidate failed banks, either by finding buyers for the bank as a going concern, or by liquidating its portfolio of assets, within two years, which can be extended for cause by an additional year. Should the bridge bank fail to wind down its operations within the allotted time, the bridge bank must notify the Comptroller of the Currency of its intent to dissolve the bridge bank. Under this situation, the FDIC is appointed as the receiver of the bridge bank's assets.

Secular morality

Secular morality is the aspect of philosophy that deals with morality outside of religious traditions. Modern examples include humanism, freethinking, and most versions of consequentialism. Additional philosophies with ancient roots include those such as skepticism and virtue ethics. Greg M. Epstein also states that, "much of ancient Far Eastern thought is deeply concerned with human goodness without placing much if any stock in the importance of gods or spirits." Other philosophers have proposed various ideas about how to determine right and wrong actions. An example is Immanuel Kant's categorical imperative: "The idea that actions can only be considered moral if they could be imitated by anyone else and produce good results."
A variety of positions are apparent regarding the relationship between religion and morality. Some believe that religion is necessary as a guide to a moral life. This idea has been with us for nearly 2,000 years. There are various thoughts regarding how this idea has arisen. For example, Greg Epstein suggests that this idea is connected to a concerted effort by theists to question nonreligious ideas: "conservative authorities have, since ancient days, had a clever counterstrategy against religious skepticism—convincing people that atheism is evil, and then accusing their enemies of being atheists."
Others eschew the idea that religion is required to provide a guide to right and wrong behavior, such as the "Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics" which states that religion and morality "are to be defined differently and have no definitional connections with each other". Some believe that religions provide poor guides to moral behavior. Various commentators, such as Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens are among those who have asserted this view.
Secular moral frameworks.
Consequentialism.
"Consequentialists", as described by Peter Singer, "start not with moral rules, but with goals. They assess actions by the extent to which they further those goals." Singer also notes that utilitarianism is "the best-known, though not the only, consequentialist theory." Consequentialism is the class of normative ethical theories holding that the consequences of one's conduct are the ultimate basis for any judgment about the rightness of that conduct. Thus, from a consequentialist standpoint, a morally right act (or omission) is one that will produce a good outcome, or consequence. In his 2010 book, "The Moral Landscape", Sam Harris describes a utilitarian science of morality.
Freethinking.
Freethought is a philosophical viewpoint that holds that opinions should be formed on the basis of science, logic, and reason, and should not be influenced by authority, tradition, or other dogmas. Freethinkers strive to build their opinions on the basis of facts, scientific inquiry, and logical principles, independent of any logical fallacies or intellectually limiting effects of authority, confirmation bias, cognitive bias, conventional wisdom, popular culture, prejudice, sectarianism, tradition, urban legend, and all other dogmas.
Secular humanism.
Secular humanism focuses on the way human beings can lead happy and functional lives. Though it posits that human beings are capable of being ethical and moral without religion or God, it neither assumes humans to be inherently evil or innately good, nor presents humans as "above nature" or superior to it. Rather, the humanist life stance emphasizes the unique responsibility facing humanity and the ethical consequences of human decisions. Fundamental to the concept of secular humanism is the strongly held viewpoint that ideology—be it religious or political—must be thoroughly examined by each individual and not simply accepted or rejected on faith. Along with this, an essential part of secular humanism is a continually adapting search for truth, primarily through science and philosophy.
Positions on religion and morality.
The subject of secular morality has been discussed by prominent secular scholars as well as popular culture-based atheist and anti-religious writers. These include Paul Chamberlain's "Can We Be Good Without God?" (1996), Richard Holloway's " Godless Morality: Keeping Religion Out of Ethics" (1999), Robert Buckman's "Can We Be Good Without God?" (2002), Michael Shermer's "The Science of Good and Evil" (2004), Richard Dawkins's "The God Delusion" (2006), Christopher Hitchens's "God Is Not Great" (2007), Greg Epstein's "Good Without God: What A Billion Nonreligious People "Do" Believe" (2010), and Sam Harris's "The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values" (2011).
Morality requires religious tenets.
According to Greg Epstein, "the idea that we can't be 'good without God' " has been with us for nearly 2,000 years. This idea is seen in various holy books, for example in Psalms 14 of the Christian Bible: "The fool says in his heart, 'there is no God.' They are corrupt, they do abominable deeds, there is none who does good ... not even one." And this idea is still present today. "Many today ... argue that religious beliefs are necessary to provide moral guidance and standards of virtuous conduct in an otherwise corrupt, materialistic, and degenerate world." For example, Christian writer and medievalist C. S. Lewis made the argument in his popular book "Mere Christianity" that if a supernatural, objective standard of right and wrong does not exist outside of the natural world, then right and wrong becomes mired in the is-ought problem. Thus, he wrote, preferences for one moral standard over another become as inherently indefensible and arbitrary as preferring a certain flavor of food over another or choosing to drive on a certain side of a road. In the same vein, Christian theologian Ron Rhodes has remarked that "it is impossible to distinguish evil from good unless one has an infinite reference point which is absolutely good." Peter Singer states that, "Traditionally, the more important link between religion and ethics was that religion was thought to provide a reason for doing what is right, the reason being that those who are virtuous will be rewarded by an eternity of bliss while the rest roast in hell."
Proponents of theism argue that without a God or gods it is impossible to "justify" moral behavior on metaphysical grounds and thus to make a coherent case for abiding by moral standards. C. S. Lewis makes such an argument in "Mere Christianity". Peter Robinson, a political author and commentator with Stanford's Hoover Institution, has commented that, if an inner moral conscience is just another adaptive or evolved feeling in the human mind like simple emotional urges, then no inherent reason exists to consider morality as over and above other urges.
According to Thomas Dixon, "Religions certainly do provide a framework within which people can learn the difference between right and wrong."
Morality does not rely on religion.
Various commentators have stated that morality does not require religion as a guide. "The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics" states that, "it is not hard to imagine a society of people that has no religion but has a morality, as well as a legal system, just because it says that people cannot live together without rules against killing, etc., and that it is not desirable for these all to be legally enforced. There have also certainly been people who have had a morality but no religious beliefs." Bernard Williams, an English philosopher, stated that the secular "utilitarian outlook"—a popular ethical position wherein the morally right action is defined as that action which effects the greatest amount of happiness or pleasure for the greatest number of people—is "non-transcendental, and makes no appeal outside human life, in particular not to religious considerations." Williams also argued that, "Either one's motives for following the moral word of God are moral motives, or they are not. If they are, then one is already equipped with moral motivations, and the introduction of God adds nothing extra. But if they are not moral motives, then they will be motives of such a kind that they cannot appropriately motivate "morality" at all ... we reach the conclusion that any appeal to God in this connection either adds to nothing at all, or it adds the wrong sort of thing."
Socrates' "Euthyphro dilemma" is often considered one of the earliest refutations of the idea that morality requires religion. This line of reasoning is described by Peter Singer:
Greg Epstein, a Humanist chaplain at Harvard University, dismisses the question of whether God is needed to be good "because that question does not need to be answered—it needs to be rejected outright," adding, "To suggest that one "can't" be good without belief in God is not just an opinion ... it is a prejudice. It may even be discrimination." This is in line with the "Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics" which states that religion and morality "are to be defined differently and have no definitional connections with each other. Conceptually and in principle, morality and a religious value system are two distinct kinds of value systems or action guides." Others share this view. Singer states that morality "is not something intelligible only in the context of religion". Atheistic philosopher Julian Baggini stated that "there is nothing to stop atheists believing in morality, a meaning for life, or human goodness. Atheism is only intrinsically negative when it comes to belief about God. It is as capable of a positive view of other aspects of life as any other belief." He also states that "Morality is more than possible without God, it is entirely independent of him. That means atheists are not only more than capable of leading moral lives, they may even be able to lead more moral lives than religious believers who confuse divine law and punishment with right and wrong.
Popular atheist author and "Vanity Fair" writer Christopher Hitchens remarked on the program "Uncommon Knowledge":
Philosopher Daniel Dennett says that secular organizations need to learn more 'marketing' lessons from religion—and from effective secular organizations like the TED conferences. This is partly because Dennett says that the idea that people need God to be morally good is an extremely harmful, yet popular myth. He believes it is a falsehood that persists because churches are currently much better at organizing people to do morally good work. In Dennett's words: 
Religion is a poor moral guide.
Popular atheist author and biologist Richard Dawkins, writing in "The God Delusion", has stated that religious people have committed a wide variety of acts and held certain beliefs through history that are considered today to be morally repugnant. He has stated that Adolf Hitler and the Nazis held broadly Christian religious beliefs that inspired the Holocaust on account of antisemitic Christian doctrine, that Christians have traditionally imposed unfair restrictions on the legal and civil rights of women, and that Christians have condoned slavery of some form or description throughout most of Christianity's history. Dawkins insists that, since Jewish and Christian interpretations of the Bible have changed over the span of history so that what was formerly seen as permissible is now seen as impermissible, it is intellectually dishonest for them to believe theism provides an absolute moral foundation apart from secular intuition. In addition, he argued that since Christians and other religious groups do not acknowledge the binding authority of all parts of their holy texts (e.g., The books of Exodus and Leviticus state that those who work on the Sabbath and those caught performing acts of homosexuality, respectively, were to be put to death.), they are already capable of distinguishing "right" from "wrong."
The well-known passage from Dostoyevsky's "The Brothers Karamazov", "If God is dead, all is permitted," suggests that non-believers would not hold moral lives without the possibility of punishment by a God. Greg M. Epstein notes a similar theme in reverse. Famous apologies by Christians who have "sinned" (such as Bill Clinton and Jimmy Swaggart) "must embolden some who take enormous risks for the thrill of a little immoral behavior: their Lord will forgive them, if they only ask nicely enough when—or if—they are eventually caught. If you're going to do something naughty, you're going to do it, and all the theology in the world isn't going to stop you." Some survey and sociological literature suggests that theists do no better than their secular counterparts in the percentage adhering to widely held moral standards (e.g., lying, theft and sexual infidelity).
Evidential findings.
Cases can also be seen in nature of animals exhibiting behavior we might classify as "moral" without religious directives to guide them. These include "detailed studies of the complex systems of altruism and cooperation that operate among social insects" and "the posting of altruistic sentinels by some species of bird and mammal, who risk their own lives to warn the rest of the group of imminent danger."
Greg Epstein states that "sociologists have recently begun to pay more attention to the fact that some of the world's most secular countries, such as those in Scandinavia, are among the least violent, best educated, and most likely to care for the poor". He adds that, "scientists are beginning to document, though religion may have benefits for the brain, so may secularism and Humanism."
On April 26, 2012, the results of a study which tested their subjects' pro-social sentiments were published in the Social Psychological and Personality Science journal in which non-religious people had higher scores showing that they were more inclined to show generosity in random acts of kindness, such as lending their possessions and offering a seat on a crowded bus or train. Religious people also had lower scores when it came to seeing how much compassion motivated participants to be charitable in other ways, such as in giving money or food to a homeless person and to non-believers.
A number of studies have been conducted on the empirics of morality in various countries, and the overall relationship between faith and crime is unclear. A 2001 review of studies on this topic found "The existing evidence surrounding the effect of religion on crime is varied, contested, and inconclusive, and currently no persuasive answer exists as to the empirical relationship between religion and crime." Phil Zuckerman's 2008 book, "Society without God", notes that Denmark and Sweden, "which are probably the least religious countries in the world, and possibly in the history of the world", enjoy "among the lowest violent crime rates in the world the lowest levels of corruption in the world". Dozens of studies have been conducted on this topic since the twentieth century. A 2005 study by Gregory S. Paul published in the "Journal of Religion and Society" stated that, "In general, higher rates of belief in and worship of a creator correlate with higher rates of homicide, juvenile and early adult mortality, STD infection rates, teen pregnancy, and abortion in the prosperous democracies," and "In all secular developing democracies a centuries long-term trend has seen homicide rates drop to historical lows" with the exceptions being the United States (with a high religiosity level) and "theistic" Portugal. In a response, Gary Jensen builds on and refines Paul's study. His conclusion is that a "complex relationship" exists between religiosity and homicide "with some
dimensions of religiosity encouraging homicide and other dimensions discouraging it".
Other views.
Some non-religious nihilistic and existentialist thinkers have affirmed the prominent theistic position that the existence of the personal God of theism is linked to the existence of an objective moral standard, asserting that questions of right and wrong inherently have no meaning and, thus, any notions of morality are nothing but an anthropogenic fantasy. Agnostic author and Absurdist philosopher Albert Camus discussed the issue of what he saw as the universe's indifference towards humankind and the meaninglessness of life in his prominent novel "The Stranger", in which the protagonist accepts death via execution without sadness or feelings of injustice. In his philosophical work, "The Myth of Sisyphus", Camus argues that human beings must choose to live defiantly in spite of their longing for purpose or direction and the apparent lack of evidence for God or moral imperatives. The atheistic existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre proposed that the individual must create his own essence and therefore must freely and independently create his own subjective moral standards by which to live.

HMS "Concord" was a C-class destroyer of the Royal Navy.
She was initially ordered as HMS "Corso" during the Second World War, and was built by John I. Thornycroft & Company, Southampton. She was launched on 14 May 1945, renamed HMS "Concord" in June 1946 and commissioned on 20 December 1946. She was involved in the 'Amethyst incident' in 1949; "Concord" entered the river Yangtze and proceeded to a point off the Woosung Fort, the location of a heavy gun battery 38 miles from the mouth of the river. Lieutenant Commander Kerans, commanding "Amethyst", had from the beginning requested that "Concord" should meet him there to give protection at the most critical point of his escape. There was no boom at the mouth of the river. "Concord" went on to serve during the Korean War, before finally being decommissioned. She arrived at the breakers yard at Inverkeithing on 22 October 1962.

Glen Jean, West Virginia

Glen Jean is an unincorporated census-designated place in Fayette County, West Virginia, United States, near Oak Hill. As of the 2010 census, its population is 210.
The area had been known was White Oaks, but when the town was founded in the early 1870s the community was named for Jean McKell, the wife of landowner Thomas G. McKell. The town was a center for the coal mining industry and a railroad junction, formerly boasting an opera house, hotels and a company store. Much of the town has disappeared since the end of the coal boom. The chief remaining structure is the Bank of Glen Jean, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Glean Jean is the headquarters of New River Gorge National River, located across the street from the bank building, which now functions as a visitor contact center.
The latitude of Glen Jean is 37.926N. The longitude is -81.15W. It is in the Eastern Time Zone. Elevation is 1,627 feet.

150th Cavalry Regiment

The 150th Cavalry Regiment ("The Second West Virginia") is a unit of the West Virginia Army National Guard, with troops in multiple locations throughout West Virginia. Its heritage with the West Virginia National Guard dates back to the Revolutionary War.
History.
The lineage of the 150th Cavalry Regiment dates back to 1 March 1778, with the formation of the Militia of Greenbrier County. On 22 December 1792, the Militia of Greenbrier County was reorganized as volunteer companies of the 13th Brigade, Virginia Militia. During the War of 1812, five companies from the 13th Brigade were combined with seven companies from what is now northern West Virginia to form the 2nd Regiment, Virginia Volunteer Militia.
During the American Civil War, units with Union sympathies were combined to form the 5th and 9th Virginia Volunteer Infantry Regiments. After becoming a separate state in 1863, West Virginia reorganized its militia, including the 5th and 9th Regiments, which were consolidated and reorganized on 9 November 1864, as the 1st West Virginia Veteran Infantry Regiment, part of the 2nd Division, West Virginia Militia.
On 7 June 1889, the 1st West Virginia Veteran Infantry Regiment was reorganized as the 2nd Regiment, West Virginia National Guard. After being mustered into service for eight months along the Mexican border, it was briefly mustered out of service for less than a month only to be mustered back into Federal service on 10 April 1917. After being federalized it was redesignated as the 150th Infantry Regiment and assigned to the 38th Division on 19 September 1917. The regiment would remain assigned to the 38th Division until the beginning of WWII.
On 1 March 1942, the regiment was relieved from its assignment the 38th and transferred to the Panama Canal Zone where it served through the rest of the war.
After the war, the regiment went through a period of slow but drastic change. On 1 July 1955, the regiment was reorganized from an Infantry table of organization and equipment unit to an Armored Cavalry TO&E unit and redesignated as the 150th Armored Cavalry Regiment. On 1 March 1968, 2nd Squadron was relieved from the regiment and broken up to form other units within the West Virginia National Guard. Meanwhile, two months later, 3rd Squadron was redesignated as 3rd Squadron, 107th Armored Cavalry. 1st Squadron continued on as the only squadron remaining in the regiment until 1 September 1993, when the regiment was reorganized and redesignated as the 150th Armor Regiment, consisting of the 1st Battalion, and assigned to the 28th Infantry Division.
When the 30th Enhanced Heavy Separate Brigade began mobilization to partake in Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2004, 1st Battalion, 150th Armor was chosen to reinforce the brigade. The battalion served with the brigade for approximately one year in Iraq and redeployed with the brigade back to the United States. Upon returning to the United States, 1st Battalion 150th Armor was redesignated as the 150th Cavalry, consisting of the 1st Squadron, reorganized as a Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition squadron, and reassigned to the 30th Brigade as that brigade's RSTA squadron under the new Heavy Brigade Unit of Acton TO&E.
1st Squadron.
Today, 1st Squadron, 150th Cavalry Regiment is the only active squadron in the regiment. The unit is composed of cavalry scouts equipped with HMMWVs and Bradley Fighting Vehicles. 
Distinctive unit insignia.
A Gold color metal and enamel device in height overall consisting of a shield blazoned: Azure, a powder horn Argent, mouth to dexter, ferruled Or, stringed of the second; in chief five mullets of the third voided. Attached below the shield a bipartite scroll inscribed “WE CAN TAKE IT” in Blue. 
The shield is blue, representative of the original organization. The powder horn is adapted from the State coat of arms. The five mullets symbolize the wars in which the original regiment participated. 
The distinctive unit insignia was originally approved for the 150th Infantry Regiment on 28 May 1934. It was redesignated for the 150th Armored Cavalry Regiment on 21 September 1955. The insignia was redesignated for the 150th Armor Regiment with the description and symbolism revised effective 1 September 1993.

was the fourth King of Oudh from 17 May 1842 to 13 February 1847.
Life.
He was son of Muhammad Ali Shah. Muhammad Ali Shah had made every effort to ensure that the heir apparent received an excellent education & had therefore entrusted him to the company of religious scholars, which instead of making him an intelligent ruler made him a devout Muslim. Thus, he became the most deeply religious, circumspect and abstinent ruler of Oudh.
Administration.

Maria Andreyeva

Maria Fyodorovna Andreyeva (, "Mariya Fyodorovna Andreyeva") was the stage name of Maria Fyodorovna Yurkovskaya () (July 4, 1868 – December 8, 1953), a Russian/Soviet actress and Bolshevik administrator.
Early life.
Her father, Fyodor Alexandrovich Fyodorov-Yurkovsky (, 1842–1915) was the director of the Alexandrinsky Theater, and her mother was an actress. She followed into the steps of her parents. After drama school she went to Kazan, aged 18. She married Andrey Zhelyabuzhsky, who was her elder by 18 years. He was controller of the Kursk and Nizhny Novgorod railroads, but was also involved in theatre. The couple had two children, Yuri (1888–1955) and Yekaterina (born 1894). Yuri went on to become a film director.
Early career.
After Zhelyabuzhsky received a new post, the family moved to Tiflis, where she had success as an actress. They next moved to Moscow, where Andreyeva worked with Konstantin Stanislavsky at the Moscow Art Theatre. She made her Moscow debut on December 15, 1894. She enjoyed great success.
Andreyeva took an interest in Marxist literature and she secretly joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. In 1902, she decided to leave acting. In 1900, she met Maxim Gorky in Sevastopol the first time. In 1903 she became his common law wife.
Gorky and Andreyeva left Russia in 1906 and travelled around the United States, and then settled in Capri, Italy. While in Capri, Gorky was involved in the Vpered group but Andreyeva fell out with Anna Aleksandrovna Lunacharskaya, wife of Anatoly Lunacharsky and sister of Bogdanov.
Career in theatrical administration.
Already by 1914, she was active in attempts to promote classical theatre to the masses. Only after the October Revolution did these endeavours bear fruits. Between 1918 and 1921, she was Commissar of Theaters and Public Shows in Petrograd. She was instrumental in the establishment of the Bolshoi Drama Theater, which opened in 1919. In January that year, Anatoly Lunacharsky nominated her as his deputy in his role of head of art section of the Narkompros in Petrograd. The Petrograd Soviet refused to confirm her nomination, but Vladimir Lenin intervened in her favour and the appointment went ahead.
In 1920, Lunacharsky offered her the position of head of "TEO", the theatre department of "Narkompros", in Moscow, but she refused.
Later career.
In 1921 she travelled abroad selling antiques and works of art, and from 1922 she represented the Commissariat of External Trade in relation to the film industry, spending some time with the Soviet trade delegation in Berlin. During this period she separated from Gorky.
It is thought that she was the model for the character of Margherita in Bulgakov's novel The Master and Margherita.
Between 1931 and 1948, she was Director of the House of Scientists in Moscow.

The Cry (book)

Jane Collier's and Sarah Fielding's The Cry: A New Dramatic Fable (1754) was Fielding's sixth and Collier's second and final work. The work is an allegorical and satirical novel. Collier and Fielding had worked together previously when Fielding wrote "The Governess" and when Collier wrote "An Essay on the Art of Ingeniously Tormenting", but "The Cry" is the only work that can be positively ascribed to the two together. Collier died the year after its publication.
The novel was originally produced in three volumes and divided into five parts. The work involves many stories told through the character Portia to an audience consisting of Una, an allegorical figure representing truth, and the "Cry," a chorus that responds in turn.
Background.
It is likely that by 1751, Fielding and Collier were living together. In 1753, Fielding published "The Adventures of David Simple. Volume the Last," and Collier published "An Essay on the Art of Ingeniously Tormenting." Their joint effort "The Cry" was published in March 1754. After Collier died in 1755, Richardson encouraged Fielding to revise the work and print a second edition. Originally, Collier planned "A book called "The Laugh" on the same plan as "The Cry"", but was never able to complete it before she died.
After working on "The Cry", Fielding began to focus on the lives of women and the conditions that they live, which later influenced her work within the Bath community. The community was a group of female writers that challenged the traditional ideas of female education and the role of women in society.
The Cry.
"The Cry" features stories by characters with responses by a group known as "the Cry". They operate as a sort of chorus in the novel.
Part the First.
A meeting is held between Portia, Una, and the Cry, who regard Portia as a "dupe." Portia describes Nicanor's family—a gloomy father and the twins Ferdinand and Cordelia—and the Cry accuses her of being in love with Ferdinand, which prompts her to discuss various "romantic" subjects. This leads to Portia telling a story of her courtship with Ferdinand, but the Cry accuse her of being too fond of him. Then, the Cry start abusing Portia for her feelings and for later discussing logic.
Una asks Portia to continue talking about logic. This leads to a story being told of John and Betty, two characters whose tale the Cry enjoys because it confirms their prejudice against educated women. It is then revealed that the Cry cannot stand women learning, and they oppose the thought of it. Portia responds by telling a story of three children, a story of Ben Johnson's jealousy of Shakespeare, and an infant and two monkeys. The Cry react badly to these stories and attack Portia for telling them. Una stops the fighting before it gets out of hand by dismissing the meeting.
Part the Second.
The narrator provides the back-story of Nicanor's family, specifically how the father's extravagance almost ruined the family.
Part the Third.
Portia begins by discussion pagan gods and other matters on religion. Things go smoothly until Portia discusses Love and the Cry attack her for being mad. Then Portia describes Oliver, Ferdinand's brother, and their courtship. She then questions the Cry and attacks them. Portia condemns Prior Emma and then tells a story about Perdita, which provokes the Cry to claim their admiration for Indian women who kill themselves after their husbands die. They start to attack the Ephesian matron and Portia defends her, which leads her to attacking hypocrites in general and a discussion about the characters of Nero, Xerxes and Alexander the Great. She then describes Oliver's abandoning of Portia for Melantha, and Melantha's loving both Oliver and Ferdinand.
The Cry attack Portia by accusing her of vanity, which prompts Portia to discuss the notion of "knowing one's self" and ignorance. This leads into a story of a merchant and three daughters to explain what she means. The Cry continue to attack Portia and claim that she was jealous of Melantha, but Portia attacks them for hypocrisy. Portia then looks to herself to determine her own bias and then pretends to be Melantha to tell her story. This only encourages accusations by the Cry that Portia is abusing human nature. Portia appeals to Una before she continues to tell the story of Ferdinand and about the obedience of wives. During this time, the men pay attention but the women fall asleep. The discussion abruptly ends when the assembly is dismissed.
Part the Fourth.
A woman named Cylinda, introduced in Part the Second as Nicanor's lover, describes her education and her love for her cousin Phaon. She describes how after he is sent abroad, she is unable to marry another and her response to his eventual death. Cylinda continues to talk about her education until Portia speaks up about ridicule and Socrates's death. Portia then proceeds to tell a story about Socrates until Cylinda takes over and describes her refusal to marry. She finishes by discussing her understanding of Greek literature and the writings of Plato.
Cylinda then describes a fever, which is later cured. After the fever, she met with Millamour and became an Epicurean with him. He offers to marry her and she refuses, causing them to separate forever. This leads into Cylinda's account of her time in London and her eventual dissatisfaction with the city. However, she meets up with Nicanor during this time and lives with him. When she believes that he may have deserted her, she leaves to Yorkshire with Artemisia and is proposed to by Artemisia's nephew, Eugenio; she quickly refuses. Soon, she meets Brunetta and her nephew, Eustace. Eustace gives Cylinda news that her fortune, which was previously thought loss, was recovered. Cylinda soon becomes attached to Eustace, who is married, and the two begin to live together. However, he later leaves Cylinda and returns to his wife, which causes Cylinda great distress.
Part the Fifth.
Portia returns to telling her story and describes how Ferdinand leaves England. Oliver soon becomes sick, but Melantha is able to nurse him back to health. Portia then describes intrigue between the two brothers and the Cry begin to become excited. Portia then tells of Ferdinand returning and proposing marriage to Portia, which she refuses. The Cry are upset at this point and ask Una to stop the story, but Una intervenes and asks Portia to finish. Portia finishes her story by describing how she left to live in the countryside and how Ferdinand followed after her; Ferdinand's actions forced Portia to depart quickly to Dover and caused her to become ill. Afterwards, she allows Ferdinand to visit her once more, and the two tell each other their stories. The meeting is then broken up for a final time.
Critical response.
Jane Spencer described the character Portia as a common image in Fielding's works of an intellectual woman "who suffers from male prejudice against women of learning" and that "she can be seen as a surrogate for her author".
Originally, critics thought that Sarah Fielding wrote the work herself, based on the republication and revision of the work. However, with recent discovery of Collier's notes and other documents, it is certain that Collier and Fielding together wrote the work.

Flame jet drill

The Flame Jet Drill is a type of drilling equipment whereby there is no contact with the drilling surface, therefore the drill never wears down.
The tool expels an ultra hot hydrogen flame (~4000 °C) which causes small inconsistencies in the rock to fracture and fly away and thus "drill" surface.
Another prototype drill called a Hydro Jet Drill is able to work in hot damp conditions by superheating water and spraying the rock with the fluid.
The devices were featured in a National Geographic documentary "MegaStructures: Deep Earth Drillers" about geothermal energy.

The orchestra is headquartered and rehearses at the Beurs van Berlage, Amsterdam.
The NKO was established in 1955, and gave its first concert that year at the Holland Festival. In 1985, the NKO was merged with the Amsterdam Philharmonic Orchestra and the Utrecht Symphony Orchestra to form the "Stichting Nederlands Philharmonisch Orkest". The NKO still continues to give concerts under its own name, including a 50th anniversary commemorative concert in the Concertgebouw, Amsterdam.
The first chief conductor and leader of the orchestra was Szymon Goldberg, from 1955 to 1979. During Goldberg's tenure, David Zinman served as the orchestras "second conductor ("tweede dirigent"). From 1979 to 1986, Antoni Ros-Marbà was chief conductor of the NKO. From 1986 to 2002, the first period of the merger of the NKO into the NPO Foundation, Hartmut Haenchen was chief conductor of both the NKO and the NPO. Philippe Entremont has served as principal guest conductor of the NKO. Yakov Kreizberg succeeded Haenchen as chief conductor of the NKO and NPO in 2003, and held the posts until his death in March 2011. Since 2004, Gordan Nikolitch has served as NKO concertmaster. In March 2009, the NKO announced the appointment of Marc Albrecht as the orchestra's fifth chief conductor, starting with the 2011-2012 season, for an initial contract of 4 years.
In Amsterdam, the NKO gives around 15 concerts per season at the Concertgebouw. The NKO also performs as one of several orchestras in productions at De Nederlandse Opera.

PnPSat-1

PnPSat-1 initiated in 2004 (also known as Plug-and-Play Satellite) is an experimental satellite built by the United States Air Force Research Laboratory. The spacecraft was the first choice for the third flight of the Falcon 1 rocket in August 2008, but was not selected because it was not completed at that time.
Mission description.
The primary mission is to demonstrate concepts of plug-and-play spacecraft development by successfully constructing and launching a spacecraft based on several technologies developed for that purpose.
Spacecraft design.
The design of the spacecraft centers on the idea of "smart" structural panels which are sealed aluminum panels which contain the necessary power and data electronics and harnessing. Components mounted on these panels are limited to devices which are too large to be contained inside a panel and payload devices.
The key to the design is AFRL's Space Plug-and-play Avionics (SPA) protocols and the Satellite Data Model (SDM) flight software. The SPA family of protocols provides the standardized communications interface between the flight computer system of the spacecraft and the various avionics and sensors. The SDM software performs the plug-and-play function for software and interfaces with the avionics and sensors using the SPA network.

QB64

QB64 (originally QB32) is a self-hosting BASIC compiler for Microsoft Windows, Linux and Mac OS X, designed to be compatible with Microsoft QBasic and QuickBASIC. QB64 is a C++ emitter, which is integrated with a C++ compiler to provide compilation via C++ code and GCC optimization.
QB64 implements most QBasic statements, and can run many QBasic programs, including Microsoft's QBasic Gorillas and Nibbles games. Furthermore, QB64 has been designed to contain an IDE resembling the QBASIC IDE. QB64 also extends the QBASIC programming language to include 64-bit data types, as well as better sound and graphics support. It can also emulate some DOS/x86 specific features such as INT 33h mouse access, and timers.
History.
QB64 was originally compiled with QuickBASIC 4.5. After significant development, Galleon, the developer, became hindered by QuickBASIC's memory limitations and switched to Microsoft Basic PDS 7.1, which solved these problems for a short time. After version 0.63, QB64 was able to compile itself so the Conventional memory limitations no longer applied.
Syntax.
QB64's syntax is designed to be completely backwards compatible with QuickBASIC. Line numbers are not required, and statements are terminated by newlines or by colons (codice_1).
An example Hello, World program is:
An example of QB64's emulation of VGA memory for compatibility:
Extensions to QBASIC.
QB64's extended commands begin with an underscore in order to avoid conflicts with any names that may be used in a QuickBASIC program.
QB64 extends the QuickBASIC language in several ways. It adds the new data types including codice_2, codice_3, codice_4 and codice_5 as well as unsigned data types. The new data types have suffixes just like the traditional BASIC data types. QB64 also includes an audio library which allows playing most common audio formats including MP3, Ogg Vorbis, and MIDI files as well as libraries allowing users to use higher resolution graphics than the 640×480 offered by QuickBASIC, use different fonts, and plot images in BMP, PNG, and JPEG format. It also allows the use of 32-bit colors as opposed to the limited 256 (or 16, depending) colors originally offered. 
The programmer also does not have to specify which programming libraries to include since QB64 does it automatically. However, work is being done to make QB64 more intelligent as to which libraries to include since at the moment it includes all of them. The programmer has the option to include a library of their own through the $INCLUDE command just as QuickBASIC did.
Libraries.
QB64 currently uses the SDL library for both graphics and text modes.
QB64 can also use DLL libraries for Windows, C++ and SDL functions and statements with a DECLARE LIBRARY block. Users can also access C header files to run C functions.

Amusement (film)

Amusement is a 2008 American horror film directed by John Simpson and starring Katheryn Winnick, Laura Breckenridge and Jessica Lucas. The film went direct-to-video in January 2009. It was the last film to be distributed by Picturehouse Entertainment before their closure in 2008 and relaunch in 2013.
Plot.
During the opening credits, pictures of three girls when they were children, as adolescent, and as young adult are shown. The girls are Tabitha Wright, Lisa Swan and Shelby Leds. These girls have great potential — "to succeed, be famous and shine" respectively — according to their senior class yearbooks. It also shows a young unnamed boy who is very psychologically disturbed as it clearly states in his psychiatric report, and that he is extremely dangerous and currently detained.
Shelby.
Shelby and her boyfriend Rob are on the highway headed to Cincinnati, Ohio. On the way there, they join a convoy of vehicles, consisting of a semitruck and a Jeep. The convoy decides to pull over for gas. Rob then meets the drivers of the two vehicles. The driver of the semi tells them that the highway ahead has bad traffic and he can show them an alternate route. While in the car, Shelby sees a frightened woman in the window of the semi.
After they are on the road again, Shelby sees the same girl. A piece of paper flies from the semi, hitting their windshield. It says, "Help Me". Moments later, the girl jumps from the semi and lands on their car. The semi continues to drive as Rob, Shelby and the driver of the Jeep stop to help the girl. 
Rob gets back in his car and chases the semi to get his plates at the demands of Shelby. The driver soon ends up cornering Rob and then taking off back down the hill. When Rob gets back to where the others are, the girls are gone and so is the semi. The driver of the Jeep says that he took them. Both men get in the Jeep and track the semi to an old house. When they arrive, the driver of the Jeep says he wants to try to stop the semi driver first. He moves to the front of the house, concealing himself behind the screen door as the semi driver talks to someone over the phone. 
Meanwhile, Rob waits in the Jeep. He nears a noise and finds a cb-radio in the center console. Upon hearing another noise in the back seat, he turns and sees movement under a tarp. He removes the tarp only to find the two girls bound and gagged. 
The semi driver notices the car and comes outside. The Jeep driver then attacks and kills him by smashing his skull with a sledgehammer. Rob tries to drive away in a panic as the man approaches maniacally laughing. To Rob's horror, the driver of the Jeep holds up the keys outside his window. He then breaks open the window with his sledgehammer and attacks Rob. The fate of everyone in the car is left unknown.
Tabitha.
Tabitha is in front of a big house, later revealed as her aunt's. She goes in and finds her two cousins, Max and Danny, completely alone. She asks the boys where the babysitter, named June, is and they say that she had already left. Later that evening, once the boys are in bed, Tabitha hears a knock on the door. Looking through the eyehole, she sees an anonymous figure in a hooded raincoat. She opens the door and inquires as to who they are. The figure tells her that he is the babysitter's boyfriend, Owen. He's very worried as she missed cheerleading practice. Tabitha admits that the babysitter had already left, but that she knows nothing else. Owen leaves.
After that, Tabitha goes into the guest bedroom upstairs and sees that the entire room is decorated with clown toys. One doll in particular scares her, a life-sized one sitting in the rocking chair. Her feeling of unease only intensifies as the television turns on without warning and the remote is in the clown's lap. She goes to bed, but the thunderstorm wakes her up. 
Still spooked by the clown, she turns around and faces her head away from it. Unbeknownst to her, the clown's head turns to see her. Later, the phone rings. Tabitha walks to answer, not knowing that the clown had been watching her all along. The caller is her aunt, checking on the children. Tabitha assures that every thing is fine and compliments her on her new house. She does however express anxiety at the clown in her room. When her aunt asks which one, Tabitha says, "The one bigger than me". Behind her, the clown rises and walks towards her.
On the phone, her aunt says that she has no such doll. Tabitha panicks and drops the phone, turning around to see the rocking chair empty. Terrified, she slips into the boys room and locks it. Tabitha whispers to wake up and hide, as a very bad man is in the house. The boys say that it is just Owen wanting to play, only increasing her terror.
After the older boy says that Owen just wants to have fun, triple-blade spikes go through the door several times, missing Tabitha by inches. She pulls their dresser against the door and gets the boys out by the window, telling them to go to their neighbor's house and get help. The clown breaks the dresser and reaches out for Tabitha. She throws a lamp at him and climbs out of the window. Only moments later, the clown stands and attempts to stab her hand. 
Tabitha falls down and runs to the shed. Opening a closet, she finds the corpse of June, the babysitter. The dead body falls and pins her down. Soon after, the clown enters the room laughing with a knife. His laugh is eerily similar to the Jeep driver's. The scene blacks.
Interrogation and flashback.
Soon after the clown scene ends, the scene cuts to Tabitha in a police interrogation room. She appears disoriented and in shock. An FBI agent questions her about her attacker. In her shock, she doesn't answer any of his questions. He soon leaves. 
Tabitha then starts having flashbacks of her and her friends when they were children. The scene cuts to Lisa, Shelby, Tabitha and a boy standing in front of a school. The kids are showing off their art out of a shoebox with a peephole. Each girl's is artistically different. The little boy with them wants to see all of their boxes and refuses to show them his until then.
Tabitha's is a circus, Shelby's is a farm, and Lisa's is a sleepover with three dolls. The boy calls each one boring and as he looks at each one, calls it worst than the last. The young Tabitha then looks at the boy's art, and recoils in shock and horror. The boy, however, smiles and states, "It's funny, right?" To which she replies, "No... it isn't."
The camera cuts to the school's name, revealed to be Briar Hills Elementary. When it cuts back to the children, all three girls are gone. The little boy smiles and looks into his box. Inside is a chained-up rat with its skin pulled back to reveal its organs. It becomes obvious that the boy is disturbed.
Lisa.
Lisa is with her boyfriend Dan looking for her roommate, Cat, who had disappeared the night before. They go to an old hotel that Cat said she will be at. Lisa tries to get in but fails. She then goes to Dan and asks if he can make up something to get in. He says that he is a "health inspector." He then goes in the place and finds a music player. The man says that there is a surprise in the end, which is a knife flying out of the speakers, stabbing him in the eye.
After dark and many unanswered calls, Lisa impatiently sneaks in the house and goes in a room with beds. She meets a man who is deaf who appears to help her. She finds dead bodies confined in the beds, and her friend Cat, who is still alive. While trying to free Cat, the deaf man turns out to be the killer and subdues her.
The Briar Hills Connection: The Final Confrontation.
Back at the police station, Tabitha is being grilled by the therapist who asks her about her friend Shelby. Tabitha says that they were all good friends at school but have not met in years. Tabitha seemed puzzled and asks how she knows about her hometown of Briar Hills. She tells Tabby about a young boy she had as a patient. Before she walks out of the room, she tells Tabitha that Lisa and Shelby are also here, and to sit tight because she will be back after she finds "a phone that works." The therapist has an uneasy feeling and quickly leaves the room. The door opens and shuts. Tabitha, still puzzled and scared, walks out of the room after opening the unlocked door and soon understands why the therapist left in a hurry. It turns out they are not at the police station after all and at the end of the hallway she sees the therapist lying on the floor. She goes to the body and then sees the officer approaching. Tabitha realizes he's not a cop when he begins his trademark maniac laugh - he is the killer. He chases her around and down the basement. Eventually Tabby is trapped and pinned in between two glass walls. When the lights come on behind, Tabby sees Lisa and then Shelby, both chained up and their skins open. The killer comes in, initially taunting them all but then shows Tabitha that the two girls are virtually unharmed, and that their 'opened-skin' is a trick. Realizing now, he will harm Shelby for real, she pretends to laugh. As he comes to her, Tabitha stabs him in the neck with a scalpel she had hidden in her hand. Eventually she is able to help her friends break free.
They try to make a run together. But the killer stabs Lisa when she opens the wrong door. Tabitha and Shelby run away. They begin climbing a ladder with the killer in pursuit. He climbs up behind them and grabs hold of Shelby's ankle. Both fall down to the basement floor. Tabitha continues to climb, saddened by what she saw. Once at ground level, she is caged. Soon an elevator comes on and she realizes the killer is coming up. She hides in what she thinks is a closet. She finds the clown mask, costume, and the dead bodies of other people the Killer had murdered for making fun of him when he was a child, each with their initials carved in their skulls. The killer surprises her as he looks through the peep hole and locks her in the room. She realizes she's in the back of a truck. The truck does not make it far from the house (which is the same house from the beginning of the movie). Tabitha takes hold one of the spiked handles and waits. Taking a last look, he laughs while looking through the peep hole again. Tabitha stabs him through the face, killing him and she makes the remark: "Now that was funny."
The truck drives away, with Tabitha talking about how she and her friends had laughed at him when they were kids, thinking that he was a joke. And that after he was sent away, they had forgotten him — but he never did. The film ends with her remarking that even though it's all over, she still cannot get his laugh out of her head. And his laugh is heard, again.
Production.
The film was produced by Macari/Edelstein, New Line Cinema and Picturehouse Entertainment.
Release.
The film was originally slated to hit theaters in January 2008, but was pushed back to April 25 and then again to September 12. It was pushed back once more to December 26, but Warner Bros. ultimately decided to release it direct-to-video on January 20, 2009. It was released on DVD in Australia on February 5, 2009 and on March 23, 2009 in the United Kingdom.
Reception.
Bloody-Disgusting.com apparently caught an early screening of the film and called it "disastrous", which might be one of the reasons why the theatrical release has been delayed so much and the eventual decision to release it direct-to-video instead.

CS Concordia Chiajna

CS Concordia Chiajna is a Romanian football club founded in 1957 and based in Chiajna, Ilfov County. The team currently plays in the Liga I.
History.
Concordia has struggled its entire existence in the lower leagues of Romania, when in 2007 they earned promotion to the Liga II for the first time.
They finished in second place in the 2010–11 Liga II season, behind Ceahlăul Piatra Neamţ, being promoted for the first time in history to the Liga I.
In the first half of their debut season in Liga I, Concordia failed to impress, and never left the relegation places. In the mid-season, Laurenţiu Reghecampf was brought as manager, and he changed almost the entire squad, bringing 17 new players. Little by little, the team started to win, among its victims being bigger names like Oţelul Galaţi, Rapid and the future champions CFR Cluj. As a result, the club climbed outside the relegation zone and finished the season in the first half of the table (ninth place). Because of this impressive results, after the season, Reghecampf was named manager at Steaua Bucureşti. His place at Concordia was taken by Ilie Stan. Under his spell, Concordia maintained its place in the upper half of the standings for the first half of the 2012-13 season. But in the second half the team failed to find the same rhythm and after six consecutive losses, Concordia entered the battle to avoid relegation. With a total of 16 games in a row without a win, Concordia finished the season on the 15th spot, similar with a relegation to Liga II after two years in the first division. At the end of the season, Ilie Stan resigned, alongside his entire technical team. Ionuț Chirilă replaced Stan as manager of the theam. Concordia Chiajna successfully remained in the first division, playing a relegation play-off with Rapid. The play-off was played on 13 July 2013 and won by Rapid, with 2-1, after extra-time. The FRF decision was contested by Concordia at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. On 2 August, CAS decided that Concordia Chiajna should play in Liga I and Rapid is relegated to second division. The results of the matches played by Rapid with Viitorul and Vaslui were canceled.

He led the colony which founded Crotona in 710 BC. They were assisted in founding the city by Archias, who was on his way to Sicily. The colony was led forth under the sanction of the Delphic oracle, Myscellus having previously been to survey the locality. He was so much better pleased with the site of Sybaris that on his return he made an unsuccessful attempt to persuade the Delphic god to allow the colonists to select Sybaris as their place of settlement.

E for Explosion

E for Explosion is an alternative rock/shoegazing band formed by former JamisonParker singer Jamison Covington after the group's breakup in 2005.
History.
The band formed upon the breakup of JamisonParker and was originally called Dance With The Dead, strictly being a solo project of Covington. Covington would later change the name of the project to "Covington," and release a number of demos under that moniker. He then recruited touring musicians and began playing under the name "E For Explosion," a name chosen because of Covington's admiration of science fiction writer Ray Bradbury. After the band released an EP, they were signed to Eyeball Records and released their debut album Reinventing the Heartbeat on May 20, 2008. The album was produced by Dave Trumfio.
The group released a new demo titled "Blankets and Blonde Hair" on February 23, 2009. A second demo was released on March 9, 2009 titled "This is Goodbye." Both have been removed from the group's Myspace player.
On September 29, 2009, Covington announced through Myspace that E For Explosion would be releasing a 5-song acoustic EP "soon", consisting of "all new unheard, unperformed and unreleased songs". The EP would be titled "Why Do I Keep Hitting Myself With a Hammer? 'Cause It Feels So Good When I Stop..." It was later announced that the EP was to be released sometime in March 2010. The track-listing was as follows:
"Why Do I Keep Hitting Myself With a Hammer? 'Cause It Feels So Good When I Stop..." was later abandoned by the band without explanation and all Myspace posts regarding it were removed. The EP would later be released on Amazon MP3 and iTunes for purchase in late 2011.
On December 2, 2009, the group released a Christmas song titled "A Long Lonely Christmas." Covington stated in a Myspace blog that the track "won't be on the upcoming EP", and that more info regarding the EP would be shared soon. On February 16, 2010, the band posted another demo called "Cool Kids", and noted that it was planned to be re-recorded for their next full-length album.
On October 29, 2010, it was announced via E for Explosion's MySpace page that a four-song EP entitled "Hold Grudges Not Hands" was scheduled to be released digitally on November 23, 2010. The track-listing is as follows:
After some "technical difficulties", as announced via Covington's Twitter account, the EP was finally made available for purchase via iTunes on November 25, 2010. The band blogged on their Myspace announcing its release, as well as thanking the fans for being patient.
On July 5, 2011, E For Explosion released a new song titled "Answers" on their Myspace and Facebook pages. The song was a b-side taken from their upcoming EP," Love ", which was released on August 2. According to E For Explosion's Facebook post, the EP will be the first of three EPs, named respectively "Love, Out, Loud, " to be released by the end of the year.
E for Explosion later released a "re-envisioning" of several songs from their debut full-length album titled "Echoes of Reinvention." The EP was released on February 14, 2012.
As of May 24, 2012, E for Explosion is writing for their next full-length album. The band has also hinted at completing their EP trilogy before releasing the yet-to-be named full-length album.
It was announced on October 18, 2013 that E For Explosion will release the last EP in the Love.Out.Loud trilogy then go on indefinite hiatus.

Forum Fulvii

Forum Fulvii was a small but flourishing Ligurian/Celtic first, then Roman settlement on the Via Fulvia, a road of north-west Italy, probably laid out by M. Fulvius Flaccus, consul in 125 BCE, from Dertona (today’s Tortona) to Hasta Pompeia (Asti). It has sometimetimes been identified with Valenza, but is now known to have been in the village of Villa del Foro, a suburb of Alessandria, population 433, some 7 km WSW of the town’s centre. 
It is located close to the river Tanaro, just below its confluence with the Belbo. Excavations of the site that have taken place since the 1980s, have revealed 200 metres of this tract of the road, which was in use from 125 BCE until the second century CE. It is about twelve metres in breadth and was constructed of riverine cobblestones mixed with small bricks and slag from iron smelting. It is notable that the road had to be resurfaced on a number of occasions after suffering from floods. 
Forum Fulvii flourished between the second century BCE and the third century CE; it was a centre for trade (the Tanaro, as well as the Via Fulvia, was an important means of transportation) and the artisanal manufacture of glass ("see" Roman glass), ceramics and iron goods. It is likely that the Roman settlement was abandoned as a result of repeated flooding: to this day the Tanaro and the Belbo have the capacity to cause great damage after periods of torrential rain. Nevertheless, Forum Fulvii must have been re-settled by the eighth century, as Paul the Deacon refers to it in his "Historia Langobardorum":
In the time of this king [ Liutprand, King of the Lombards ] there was in the place whose name is Forum, near the river Tanarus, a man of wonderful holiness Baodolinus by name, who, aided by the grace of Christ, was distinguished for many miracles."
In 2007 nearby excavations for a methane pipeline brought to light an ancient underground pipeline which seems to have been designed to carry water from the Tanaro to Forum Fulvii. It apparently dates from the pre-Roman period.
The Antiquarium "Forum Fulvii", in Via Oviglio, displays finds from the excavations and provides orientation in understanding the site of the Roman town.

Bayview, Virginia

Bayview is an unincorporated community in Northampton County, Virginia, United States.
History.
Bayview is an over 300 year old predominately African American community located on the Eastern Shore of Virginia. It is a community rich in culture and tradition. After the American Civil War it became a community populated by freed slaves, principally consisting of farms and a small village with shops, restaurants, and its own post office. In the 20th century Bayview thrived due to agriculture, especially the growing of white potatoes, and the growth of the local seafood industry. In the late 20th century Bayview was hit hard when many of the canneries and seafood processing plants closed due to dwindling shellfish populations in the Chesapeake Bay as a result of increased pollution. 
In 1994 the state of Virginia proposed to build a maximum-security prison on the edge of the community. At this time 90% of Bayview residents lived in substandard housing, with 85% having no indoor plumbing. Members of the community rallied and joined together with outside forces, ultimately defeating the prison in the spring of 1995. In 1998 the community organized as the Bayview Citizens for Social Justice and began forming productive partnerships, including the Nature Conservancy, to improve the standard of living for its people. Through a combination of federal, state, and private funds the community was able to raise $11 million and purchase 160 acres of farmland, including the proposed site for the prison. In the first phase they built 48 one, two, and three bedroom apartments, 22 single-family homes, a laundry facility, a Community Enrichment Center, and several other facilities. Currently the Bayview community is on the rise and is working towards the next phase of development.
Demographics.
Bayview is composed of approximately 200 people, 125 of which are over the age of 18. Their community is predominately African American, but in recent years there has been an increasing number of White and Hispanic people. 
Although Bayview has increased their living standards, there are still many problems, especially in the areas of education and income. No male has graduated or even attended college, while only 7 out of 125 adults have earned a college degree. Less than half (49.6%) have received a high school degree. 
Poor graduation rates are certainly a part of the explanation of why Bayview remains one of the poorest communities in the United States. Yearly income for a Bayview family ranges from under $10,000 to $40,000. 83% of the population makes less than $10,000 a year, which is below the United States' poverty line. This fact may seem small but with only a population of 125 people over the age of 18 that equates to 104 people. As of September 1, 2012, no individual makes over $40,000 per year.
Bayview Citizens for Social Justice.
Overview.
Mission & Background.
Bayview Citizens for Social Justice, Inc. (BCSJ) is a 501(c)(3) organization whose mission is to eliminate poverty by improving the living conditions of its citizens and to properly educate, unite, and empower the residents of Bayview, Va. BCSJ was formed in 1998 after the victorious fight to prevent the construction of a proposed maximum-security prison.
Community Activities.
The community works to bring together citizens for cultural and religious celebrations such as Black History Month, Easter, and Christmas. BCSJ also works to improve the living qualities and improve the self-sufficiency of Bayview’s citizens. Examples include community housing, homebuyers’ education, and voter registration.
Duties.
The BCSJ received and applied for a capacity building grant from a National Housing Assistance Council (HAC) which has produced and extended board training in Financial Management and Loan Packaging. The management and maintenance of this grant is used on programs such as, BCSJ Water and Sewer Program, Lease-to-Purchase HOME Program and the Shared Properties, Developed Lots, Street Lights, Storm-water retention pond and Community Farm program.
Strengths, Improvements, and Opportunities.
Each year a private firm is hired to conduct a SWOT survey for BCSJ. 
A strength outlined in particular was Bayview’s outstanding land control, with 150 acres of buildable lots and community farmland. BCSJ has worked to develop a Master Plan for new housing, childcare, and a community center and currently owns community buildings for public meetings, workshops, and gatherings. Members in the community demonstrate the powers of Productive Partnerships, Coalitions, and Networking. Previous and current partnerships include NAACP, the Nature Conservancy, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Old Dominion University, and the Citizens for a Better Eastern Shore. With the help of community leaders who persevere with strong resilience, extensive work has been done to garner media attention, exposure and support. Nevertheless, the community struggles with a lack of professional skills, including financial management, property management, asset management and a lack of supportive legal advisors. Citizens suffer from and work to improve a silent allowance for employment exploitation, social and environmental injustice and loss of major local businesses. BCSJ hopes to maximize their strengths and power of influence for political favor, motivation and encourage participation and promote leadership. Job training, writing skills, and neighborhood protection can help improve conditions.
Close to Bayview is a tourist attraction area with camping, golfing, bird-watching, fishing, retirement living, etc. The location brings difficulty as a peninsular toll bridge to the metropolitan mainland and Virginia Beach is difficult to pay for the many low-to-moderate income families living in Bayview. The separation between the affluent beach community and Bayview also provides a stigma and segregation, as predominately African American, low income families are just two miles from gated waterfront communities, leading to gentrification. BCSJ seeks to move beyond these difficulties through exploring new trends in local attractions through trails, biking, birdwatching, retirement, etc.
Notable people.
Alice Coles – Alice Coles is the most outspoken member of BCSJ and is its Executive Director. Her leadership led to Bayview’s positive redevelopment into a strong community of people with a lifetime commitment to better living. A descendent of freed slaves, Coles was raised in a tradition of strong ties to one’s history and community. One of her initial leadership experiences was running Bayview’s black chapel. In 1994, the state of Virginia planned a maximum-security prison less than a mile from the neighborhood school. With only a high school education and with a job handpicking meat out of crabs, Coles decided to educate herself about the Department of Corrections and travel to Richmond, VA to fight against the proposal. "We decided to fight it," Coles recalls, "because we didn't have anywhere to go and we didn't have anything to lose.". Coles’ hard work paid off as she was able to defeat the proposal for the prison, but her desire for community improvement did not end there. For the next 14 years, Coles organized a national media campaign to advance her community and called on the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the Nature Conservancy. BCSJ raised over 11 million dollars to purchase the prison site (104 acres) and 54 additional acres, and built a new village of mixed housing and infrastructure. This construction gave many Bayview citizens new amenities (such as central heating and indoor plumbing) that they thought were part of someone else’s life. There is still work to do in Bayview and Coles will keep fighting. “And if I couldn't be the door that opened, you know, to a better life, I'll be the hinge to hold the door. So, one person can make a difference. Yes.” 
Niketa A. Coles – The daughter of Alice Coles, Niketa spent her entire life in Bayview. She attended Eastern Shore Community College and obtained a certificate in Long Term Care Assistant. She has also served as a volunteer for AmeriCorps VISTA. She served as the first secretary for BCSJ from May 1998 to May 2009. In May 2009, she was elected president of BCSJ. Since then, she has facilitated team meetings with owners, funders, representatives, contractors, engineers, and architects. She has also supervised a federal grant of $400,000. She has traveled to Seattle, Colorado, and Washington to gain experience in a wide array of fields: marketing, community development, administration and lobbying. Coles has a strong belief in the promise of the Bayview community, believing that their grass-roots campaign will improve the quality of life for all of Bayview’s citizens. 
Cozzie Lockwood – The cousin of Alice Coles, Cozzie served as the 1st president of BCSJ and focused on the importance of the community in inspiring change. 
Maurice Cox is a community designer and professor at the University of Virginia School of Architecture. From 1996 to 2006, Cox was a founding partner of the firm RBGC Architecture, Research, and Urbanism. This firm helped design the New Rural Village plan for Bayview and was featured on CBS’ 60 Minutes and in the VCU documentary “This Black Soil.” 
Adebola Ajayi is the former Deputy Director of Bayview Citizens for Social Justice. Prior to coming to the United States, Ajayi was the founder of a property planning and development firm registered and based in Nigeria. In the United States, he was a Loan Officer and the staff person responsible for the Housing Assistance Council loans in the Southeast with a portfolio of over 6 million dollars. A registered architect since 1979, Ajayi has a broad knowledge of building low-income housing. He assisted in the development of Bayview’s New Rural Village. In its initial phase in the early 2000s, Bayview wanted to build 32 units, but with Ajayi’s help they were able to expand it to 52 units.
In the News.
Alice Coles and Bayview have been featured on 60 Minutes, NPR, Voice of America, and in a VCU documentary called “This Black Soil.” Alice was commended by the Virginia State legislature in 2006 and was a 2005 winner of the Impact Award, known now as the Inspire Awards.

Chesapeake is an unincorporated community in Northampton County, Virginia, United States. 
Chesapeake is a populated place located in Northampton County at latitude 37.308 and longitude -75.952. The elevation is 36 feet. Chesapeake appears on the Cheriton U.S. Geological Survey Map. Northampton County is in the Eastern Time Zone (UTC -5 hours).
Shoreline Changes.
The Chesapeake Bay coast of Northampton County is very dynamic in terms of shoreline change and sediment transport processes. The overall net movement of sands along the coast is to the south except from the southern end of the Delmarva Peninsula at Cape Charles to about Old Plantation Creek where oceanic swell tends to cause a north-trending net transport. The Northampton County coast is rich in sand along the shoreline and nearshore due to high shoreline recession rates of sandy upland banks. The complex series of offshore sand bars migrate through time and influence the rate and patterns of shoreline change. Shoreline change can be accretionary which leads to the development of extensive modern dune fields.

Manchester Camerata

The Manchester Camerata is a British chamber orchestra based in Manchester, England. A sub-group from the orchestra, the Manchester Camerata Ensemble, specialises in chamber music performances.
The orchestra's primary concert venue is The Bridgewater Hall. It also presents concerts at the Royal Northern College of Music. In addition, the orchestra gives run-out and residency concerts in various cities in the North of England, including Kingston upon Hull, Sheffield, Leeds, Kendal, Whitby, Keswick, Bradford, Stamford, Crewe, Colne, Stafford and Ulverston. The orchestra appeared annually at the Rasiguères Festival of Music and Wine, held near Perpignan, France, which Moura Lympany established in 1981.
In 1972, Raph Gonley, a music producer at BBC Radio Manchester, founded the orchestra. Gonley ran the Camerata until 1975. Funding for the Camerata after its initial period came from the Greater Manchester Council. The Camerata became an autonomous organisation in 1979.
The Camerata's first principal conductor was Frank Cliff, who served from 1972 to 1977. Subsequent principal conductors have included Szymon Goldberg, Manoug Parikian, Nicholas Braithwaite, and Sachio Fujioka. Braithwaite had also been principal guest conductor of the orchestra from 1977 to 1984. Douglas Boyd was principal conductor of the orchestra from 2001 to 2011. In March 2010, the orchestra announced the appointment of Gábor Takács-Nagy as the orchestra's newest principal conductor, effective September 2011. Nicholas Kraemer serves as the Camerata's permanent guest conductor.

Atunda Ayenda

Atunda Ayenda is a radio soap opera broadcast on 21 stations within Sierra Leone and through the Internet. It is created by Talking Drum Studios and was the first radio soap opera aired in Sierra Leone. In the Mandingo language "Atunda Ayenda" means "Lost and Found". The plot on the show revolved around young people and their experiences of the Sierra Leone Civil War, with story-arcs addressing contemporary issues such as HIV/AIDS.
Background.
In 2000, Sierra Leone's 10-year Civil War came to an end leaving the country to rebuild itself and enact a disarmament programme. Search for Common Ground an international non-profit organization set-up Talking Drum Studios to produce media content to address problems experienced after the war and promote peace and reconciliation. In December 2001 it produced "Atunda Ayenda", which means lost and found in the Mandingo language, the first radio soap opera aired in Sierra Leone. The show quickly gained significant popularity, in a 2004 survey of Sierra Leonean radio listeners 90 percent of respondents said they regularly listened to the show and 80 percent discussed the content with family and friends.
Narrative.
The narrative is divided into stages with story arcs reflecting current events in Sierra Leone. Each stage is written independently in the period just prior to broadcasting so that the stories are always up-to-date. The show's narrative is a reflection of the real experiences of people throughout Sierra Leone with the writers travelling to remote areas of the country to research the stories. The plot of the show revolves around young people and their experiences of the Sierra Leone Civil War and reconstruction after the war. Individual story-arcs address contemporary issues such as HIV/AIDS. The show was originally scripted by Kemoh Daramy but is now written by a team of writers.
Production.
The show is normally produced in the Krio language but Talking Drum Studios has joined partners with the BBC World Service to produce an English language version of the show. The original producers of the show were Desmond During and Emrys Savage with assistants including Isastu Mansaray. Some members of the cast, for example Isata Mahoi who plays Mamy Saio, also work as programme editors.
Format.
The show is broadcast weekly from Monday to Friday, on 21 radio stations within Sierra Leone and on the internet in an mp3 format. Old episodes of the show from programme 850 are also available on the internet. The show is 15 minutes in length when its theme tune is included and is usually broadcast an evening prime-time slot at 17:45. A 30 minute summary of the show is also broadcast at the weekend.

Heleno de Freitas

Heleno de Freitas, nicknamed Prince Cursed, (12 February 1920 in São João Nepomuceno, Brazil – 8 November 1959 in Barbacena) was a Brazilian footballer.
The striker spent most of his career with Botafogo, scoring 209 goals for the club, most with his head. In 1948 he transferred to Boca Juniors in Argentina, but returned to Brazil the following year, winning the 1949 Campeonato Carioca with Vasco. He ended his career with América in Rio, he played only one match for the club and it was the first and last game in the Maracanã. He died from complications related to late-stage, untreated syphilis in 1959 in a sanatorium in Barbacena.
De Freitas scored 19 goals in 18 appearances for Brazil as the team finished runners-up in both the 1945 and 1946 Copa America championships. He was joint top goalscorer in the 1945 tournament.
Heleno de Freitas was biographed by Marcos Eduardo Neves in the book "Nunca houve um homem como Heleno" (meaning "There was never a man like Heleno" in Portuguese). The title of this book is a reference to his mocking nickname Gilda. He was nicknamed after the "Gilda" main character due to his good looks and hot temper. In Colombia a Colombian writer and sports reporter Andrés Salcedo wrote a Book namely "El día en que el Fútbol Murió: Triunfo y tragedia de un dios"(Meaning: "The day when soccer died: Triumph and tragedy of a god") including Heleno de Freitas as the main character. 
In 2012, Brazilian filmmaker José Henrique Fonseca released a film based on the life of Heleno de Freitas. The film was titled "Heleno" and stars Rodrigo Santoro as Heleno de Freitas. The film's focus is more on Heleno de Freitas' personal life, particularly his decline into ether addiction and mental illness, rather than presenting his achievements on the soccer field.

43rd (Howitzer) Brigade Royal Field Artillery

XLIII (Howitzer) Brigade, Royal Field Artillery was a brigade of the Royal Field Artillery which served in the First World War.
It was originally formed with 30th, 40th and 57th (Howitzer) Batteries, each equipped with 4.5-inch howitzers, and attached to 1st Infantry Division. In August 1914 it mobilised and was sent to the Continent with the British Expeditionary Force, where it saw service with 1st Division until broken up. 57th Battery was withdrawn in May 1915, and assigned to 128th (Howitzer) Brigade.
In May 1916, the artillery brigades of infantry divisions were reorganised; the pure howitzer brigades were disbanded, and their batteries attached individually to field brigades, in order to produce mixed brigades of three field batteries and one howitzer battery. Accordingly, the brigade was broken up and the batteries dispersed; 30th to 39th Brigade, and 40th to 26th Brigade.

Davey Lee

Davey Lee (29 December 1924 – 17 June 2008) was an American child actor. He was born in Hollywood, California, USA. He appeared in six feature films between 1928 and 1930.
At the age of three he made his screen debut in one of the early talkies "The Singing Fool" (1928) starring Al Jolson, in which he played the part of Sonny Boy. "The Singing Fool" remained the most successful film until Gone with the Wind (1939), produced by MGM. It was Warner Bros.' most successful film for more than ten years. The theme song "Sonny Boy" became the first film song to sell over a million copies.
Davey Lee also played the title role in the film "Sonny Boy" (1929), starring Betty Bronson. He returned to play opposite Al Jolson in "Say It With Songs" (1929).
His other films were "Frozen River" (1929), in which he played opposite a dog Rin Tin Tin, "Skin Deep" (1929) as the son of John Bowers, and "The Squealer" (1930) as the son of Jack Holt. This was Lee's last film.
Brother of another child actor, Frankie Lee (1911-1970), Davey was taken out of films by his mother so that he could have a normal childhood.
After suffering a stroke, he was admitted to Windsor Gardens Healthcare Centre in Van Nuys, California, and died from natural causes in Los Angeles on June 17, 2008.
In 1986, Davey was brought over to the Piccadilly Theatre in London's West End to participate in the unveiling of a memorial bronze bust of Al Jolson, to commemorate the official centenary of his birth. This theatre was chosen because, to the best of knowledge, it was the only UK stage which Jolson ever stood on, although he did not perform, he merely appeared to promote his film. The evening was presented by UK impresario David Lee, a Jolson devotee who had, many years before, chosen David Lee as his stage name without knowing of the connection to Jolson. The show featured tributes to Jolson from Clive Baldwin, David Jacobs and, of course, Davey himself.

The End of Oil

The End of Oil: On the Edge of a Perilous New World is a non-fiction book by American journalist and author Paul Roberts. Published in 2004, it is Roberts' book-length debut. It provides an analysis of the various problems associated with humanity's reliance on oil and other fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas.
Synopsis.
Though "The End of Oil" is not a chronological history of humanity's use of fossil fuels, Roberts begins by recounting how Thomas Newcomen, in 1712, presented the first large steam engine, and thus helped spark the Industrial Revolution. He then goes on to explain the problems that have since developed, or may develop in the future, from humanity's reliance on oil and its "geological siblings", coal, and natural gas. While there is a chapter on hydrogen as a possible alternative to oil (not as an energy source, but as an energy carrier), the book is not focused on any one solution to the problems it lays out.
According to Roberts, oil faces three major dilemmas. Most importantly, all fossil fuels are by their very nature limited in supply; as far as oil is concerned, the resulting dilemma is best known as the question of peak oil. Further, much of the oil consumed by affluent countries such as the United States is extracted in countries that are rather unstable politically, such as some of the members of the OPEC. The oil trade is therefore prone to become intertwined with international relations, although the nature of this interplay is highly controversial, with some citing oil as a reason for conflicts such as the Iraq War and others denying such claims. Finally, since the burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide that was previously locked in the ground, humanity's reliance on oil may contribute to global warming.
As to the aims of the book, Roberts states at the end of the prologue: 
Predictions for the price of oil.
At various points in the book, Roberts makes cautious predictions for the price of oil. These were soon proved to be, if anything, too optimistic. For example, citing "Arab Oil and Gas" magazine as a source, Roberts wrote that "in the next five to ten years", if there were to be any large disruption in supply, "prices could easily be bid up past sixty dollars a barrel and kept there for months". In fact, prices passed the sixty-dollar mark as early as June 2005, 
thirteen months after the book was first published.
Reception.
"The End of Oil" received a number of positive reviews from American newspapers and review publications. Notably, environmentalist Bill McKibben, in an article for the New York Review of Books, described it as "perhaps the best single book ever produced about our energy economy and its environmental implications." 
Fellow author Joseph J. Romm, whose "The Hype about Hydrogen" had been published a few weeks before "The End of Oil", called the book "fascinating" and "a stinging rebuke of America's myopic, do-nothing energy policy." In 2005, it was a finalist for the New York Public Library's Helen Bernstein Book Award.

44th (Howitzer) Brigade Royal Field Artillery

XLIV (Howitzer) Brigade, Royal Field Artillery was a brigade of the Royal Field Artillery which served in the First World War. It joined the BEF in August 1914 before being broken up in May 1916. It was reformed as XLIV Brigade, Royal Field Artillery in early 1917, serving in Palestine and the Western Front before being disbanded after the end of the war.
XLIV (Howitzer) Brigade, RFA.
XLIV (Howitzer) Brigade, RFA was formed in March 1900 as L (Howitzer) Brigade-Division, RFA commanding 56 (Howitzer) Battery and 149 (Howitzer) Battery and in 1901, 150 (Howitzer) Battery and 151 (Howitzer) Battery joined. In 1903, the brigade was redesignated as L (Howitzer) Brigade, RFA and in 1905, 151 (H) Battery was disbanded.
With a reorganization of the field artillery on 1 August 1913, the brigade was redesignated XLIV (Howitzer) Brigade, RFA. About this time, as the numbers of field batteries were reduced 149 (H) and 150 (H) Batteries were disbanded. The batteries were replaced with 47 (H) Battery (previously in XLI Brigade, RFA) and 60 (H) Battery (previously in XXXV Brigade, RFA), with most of the men from 149th Bty transferring to the new 47th Bty and those of 150th Bty to 60th Bty.
France and Flanders 1914-16.
In August 1914, the brigade was mobilized at Aldershot at the outbreak of World War I under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Dalrymple Arbuthnot, 5th Baronet and was sent to the Continent with the British Expeditionary Force. It was assigned to 2nd Division, with 47 (H),commanded by Major H. W. Newcombe (previously Major A C Edwards), 56 (H), commanded by Major F E L Barker, and 60 (H) Battery, commanded by Major H J A Mackey, each equipped with six 4.5" howitzers. The newly formed Brigade Ammunition Column (BAC) was commanded by Captain G R Miller. The Adjutant was Captain G C Nevile; Orderly Officer Lt F L V Mills; Medical Officer: Captain Timothy W O Sexton; and Veterinary Officer: Captain L L Dixon. The RSM was John Thomas Coleman.
The brigade saw considerable action with 2nd Division in 1914, in the retreat from Mons (August), on the Marne and the Aisne (September) and at the First Battle of Ypres (October and November). More action followed in 1915, including the battles of Festubert (May) and Loos (September and October) and of the Hohenzollern Redoubt (October).
On 23 June 1915, 60 (H) Battery was withdrawn and assigned to the divisional artillery of 3rd (Lahore) Division.
In May 1916, the artillery brigades of infantry divisions were reorganised; the pure howitzer brigades were disbanded, and their batteries attached individually to field brigades, in order to produce mixed brigades of three field batteries and one howitzer battery. Accordingly, on 23 May the brigade was broken up and the batteries dispersed amongst the other field artillery brigades of 2nd Division:
Each battery now consisted of four 4.5" howitzers.
XLIV Brigade, RFA.
XLIV Brigade, RFA was reformed in England early in 1917 with 340, 382 and 399 Batteries, each equipped with four 13 pounders. It was transferred to Egypt, landing at Alexandria on 27 May 1917. It reached Sidi el Bishr on 2 June and was reorganized and re-equipped as two batteries of six 18 pounders (399 Battery was broken up to complete the other two). 340 Battery was renamed A Battery and 382 renamed B. The brigade joined 74th (Yeomanry) Division at Rafah on 3 July.
Palestine 1917-18.
With the 74th Division, the brigade took part in the invasion of Palestine in 1917 and 1918. In October and November 1917 it fought in the Third Battle of Gaza, at the end of 1917 it took part in the capture and defence of Jerusalem and in March 1918 in the Battle of Tell 'Asur. On 3 April 1918, the Division was warned that it would move to France and by 30 April 1918 had completed embarkation at Alexandria.
Before moving to the Western Front, the brigade was reorganized:
The brigade now consisted of three batteries of six 18 pounders and a battery of four 4.5" howitzers. D (H) Battery was made up to six 4.5" howitzers in France on 21 May 1918 at Noulette.
France and Flanders 1918.
On 14 July 1918 the Yeomanry Division went into the line for the first time, near Merville on the right of XI Corps. From September 1918, as part of III Corps of Fourth Army, it took part in the Hundred Days Offensive including the Second Battle of the Somme (Second Battle of Bapaume) and the Battles of the Hindenburg Line (Battle of Épehy). In October and November 1918 it took part in the Final Advance in Artois and Flanders. By the Armistice it was in the area of Tournai, Belgium, still with 74th (Yeomanry) Division.
With the end of the war, the troops of 74th Division were engaged in railway repair work and education was undertaken while demobilisation began. The division and its subformations were disbanded on 10 July 1919.

<doc id="18411216" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18411216" title="John Epps">
John Epps

Dr John Epps (1805–1869) was an English physician and political activist. He was known as a champion of radical causes on which he preached and lectured, and wrote in periodicals.; and also as a phrenologist and homeopath.
Life.
Early years and education.
Epps, the eldest son of John Epps (see Epps family), was born into a Calvinist family in Sevenoaks, Kent in 1805. George Napoleon Epps was his half-brother.
Epps became disillusioned with the religious atmosphere of his childhood. After education at a dissenting academy and then Mill Hill School (near Hendon), he served an apprenticeship to an apothecary of the name of Dury or Durie.
In 1824, at the age of 18, Epps went to Edinburgh to study medicine, and in 1827 graduated at the age of 21. He conceived of medicine as 'a tool of liberation for the poor and lower classes'.
Medical practitioner and lecturer.
After graduating Epps moved back to London where he began to practice, eventually settling in Great Russell Street. In 1831 he married. He became Medical Director of the Royal Jennerian and London Vaccine Institution, on the death of John Walker. Epps had a Scottish degree, but no license from the Royal College of Physicians.
Epps also lectured on chemistry, botany, and materia medica, in London locations. Initially this was at the Aldersgate Medical School, and Windmill Street; and later at Westminster at the Hunterian School of Medicine. There was briefly (1830–1) a medical school in Brewer Street, set up by William Birmingham Costello, Epps and Michael Ryan. Epps and Ryan then joined George Darby Dermott in giving lectures at the Western Dispensary in Gerrard Street; James Fernandez Clarke, in his memoirs, described Epps lecturing there as well-read and sympathetic but not deeply versed in practical chemistry, or botany. Epps lectured publicly and extensively for the rest of his life, particularly on phrenology and homoeopathy, in London and elsewhere. When his health failed he continued to lecture in his own home.
Phrenologist.
Introduced to it by his anatomy teacher William Sleigh while still a teenager, Epps embraced the phrenology of Franz Joseph Gall and Johann Spurzheim. While in Edinburgh he became friends with the phrenologists George and Andrew Combe; he had an introduction to Spurzheim through James Simpson. He began to lecture on phrenology in 1827. For Epps, phrenology was integrated with his Baptist Calvinism. With John Elliotson, he supported applications of "phreno-mesmerism".
Epps was influenced not only by continental phrenologists. He took from Gustav Carus and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. His views were an idiosyncratic mixture from different sources, permitting an optimistic outlook within Calvinist views.
In the later 1830s and early 1840s, the Anthropological Society of London (not to be confused with the Anthropological Society of London founded in 1863 by Richard Francis Burton and Dr. James Hunt) was a phrenological group holding meetings, associated with the "Christian Physician and Anthropological Magazine" edited by Epps. John Isaac Hawkins acted as president. Other members were Luke Burke and William Mattieu Williams. After 1842 it became part of the Christian Phrenological Society.
Homeopath.
Epps was drawn to homoeopathy in about 1837 after reading the works of Dr Paul Francis Curie; his other major influence in homoeopathy was Samuel Hahnemann. He had a "very large homoeopathic practice, especially among the lower middle and lower classes of society". His patients included Charlotte and Emily Brontë.
At odds with Frederic Quin, the earliest British physician who practised homoeopathy, Epps did not join the British Homoeopathic Society. He associated with Curie in the English Homoeopathic Association.
Death.
On 31 January 1869 Epps was attacked by paralysis, and he died, at the age of 64, on February 12. He was interred at Kensal Green Cemetery, February 19, 1869.
Radical politics.
Epps, like his father, became involved in radical politics, as a Liberal and abolitionist. He wrote in his diary "have come to consider all creatures as being equally important in the scale of creation as myself; to regard the poor Indian slave as my brother". He helped organise the National Political Union, and attended the Radical Club. He opposed "Church Rates, war, despots, corn laws, and other old institutions", and enjoyed giving political addresses. His activism brought him into contact with Joseph Hume, Lady Byron, George Wilson (president of the Anti-Corn Law League), Giuseppe Mazzini, Thomas Slingsby Duncombe, James Stansfeld, Lajos Kossuth, and Robert Owen.
Epps was involved in procuring the repeal of the Test Acts (1829) and, along with Francis Place, William Johnson Fox, Francis Burdett and others, with the passing the Reform Bill of 1832. He became a Chartist, and in 1847 he stood for parliament, in Northampton, with Chartist backing. He was an active member of the Anti-Corn Law League and joined organizations in favor of the Polish, Italian, Hungarian, and American nationalities. He stood bail for the Fourierist and revolutionary Simon François Bernard in 1858 Orsini affair.
Medical reform.
Epps supported "Knowledge Chartism", and opposed medical jargon. He supported the proposal of Thomas Wakley for a London College of Medicine, speaking in support of it at a meeting in 1831, with his colleague George Dermott; he was on the steering committee for its formation, along with Joshua Brookes and David Daniel Davis.
Religious involvement.
Epps was brought up in a Calvinist family. From an early age he declared himself an enemy to church establishments and a paid ministry, which can be seen in some of the parliamentary reforms he pushed for. Epps strongly opposed church rates. He denounced the larger Protestant churches as being the "harlot daughters of Rome the Roman Catholic Church".
While in Edinburgh he joined the Scotch Baptists, who had no fixed minister, but those who were moved spoke. In this environment, at the age of 19, Epps became a preacher. However, when he returned to London he left the Scotch Baptists because there the sect was run more like the church systems he rejected. After this, regularly and for many years, he began preaching to mechanics at Dock Head Church. From the early 1830s he moved towards Quaker beliefs.
Views.
Not only did Epps reject the orthodox church establishments, but he also rejected a number of the mainstream Christian doctrines. He rejected the doctrine of the immortal soul, emphasising instead resurrection as the escape from death. In this vein, the second coming of Christ is also emphasised. He taught that Hell is the grave, not the place of torment of mainstream Christianity. He also rejected the Christian Trinity, stating that Jesus, the Son of God, was a human by nature. He also spoke out against the glorification of war-heroes: "the honour of the British flag is a specious phrase which blinds men's eyes to right and wrong", he said.
The Devil.
The most infamous of Epps' unorthodox views regards the devil (1842). He was one of a long line of Dissenters to take this view, stretching back through Simpson (1804), Lardner (1742), Sykes (1737), going back to the Dutch Anabaptist, David Joris (1540). According to Epps, references in the Bible to the devil and Satan are, in the main, to be understood as personifications of the lustful principle in humans. In 1842 he anonymously published "The Devil: a Biblical exposition of the truth concerning that old serpent, the devil and Satan and a refutation of the beliefs obtaining in the world regarding sin and its source". The publication brought considerable opposition and, according to historian Alan Eyre,
a lecture given shortly afterward to the Tooting Institution at the Mitre Inn in...London...caused serious offence and led to widespread ostracism and hostility.
Similarly, a few years earlier he had delivered a series of lectures at the Dock Head Church to demonstrate that the devil is not a personal being and "this bold assertion drew upon him a world of abuse, and some patients declined to be treated by one holding such heterodox views".
John Epps's faith stayed with him throughout his life; it is recorded that "with his last breath he expressed his humble, yet confident faith in the power, wisdom, and goodness of the Great Father of all spirits".
Bibliography.
Epps wrote a number of books, starting before he attended university with "A New Way of Teaching English Grammar". In London he published "An Introduction to Botany", intended as a textbook for his students, and two books on phrenology called "Evidences of Christianity Deduced from Phrenology" (1827, as "Medicus") and "Horae Phrenologicae".
His work "The Organon of the Healing Art", and his first essay on homoeopathy, appeared in 1838. Epps was a frequent contributor to "The Lancet" until he adopted homoeopathy. In 1843 "The Lancet" refused to publish reports of homoeopathic treatment; he took rejected articles and published them in a pamphlet entitled "Rejected Cases", which also contained a vigorous letter to the editor of the "Lancet", his friend Wakley).
Epps was also involved in a number of other journals: he was for some time co-editor of the "London Medical and Surgical Journal", and for a long period conducted the "Christian Physician and Anthropological Magazine" (1836-9), and "The Journal of Health and Disease". He established a journal, "Notes of a New Truth", for the propagation to nonprofessionals of the "new school" of homoeopathy, to which he contributed up to the time of his death.
As with "Notes of a New Truth", the majority of Epps' lectures were directed at lay readers; however, he also lectured to medical professionals and was lecturer on materia medica at the Homoeopathic Hospital, Hanover Square (c. 1861).

Tourism in Iran

The landscape of Iran is diverse, providing a range of activities from hiking and skiing in the Alborz mountains, to beach holidays by the Persian Gulf and the Caspian Sea. Over the next five years a number of tourism-friendly infrastructure projects will be undertaken on the Persian Gulf island of Kish, which at present attracts around 1m visitors per year, the majority of whom are Iranian. 
Before the Iranian revolution and the subsequent Iran–Iraq War, tourism was characterized by significant numbers of visitors traveling to Iran for its diverse attractions, boasting cultural splendours and a diverse and beautiful landscape suitable for a range of activities. Tourism declined dramatically during the Iran–Iraq War in the 1980s. 
Since the Iranian revolution in 1979, the majority of visitors to Iran have been religious pilgrims and businesspeople. Official figures do not distinguish between those travelling to Iran for business and those coming for pleasure, and they also include a large number of diaspora Iranians returning to visit their families in Iran or making pilgrimages to holy Shia sites near Mashhad and elsewhere. Domestic tourism in Iran is one of the largest in the world. Despite the
international tensions, the government continues to project strong rises in visitor numbers and tourism revenue over the forecast period, and to talk of projects to build an additional 100 hotels, for example, to expand its currently limited stock.In 2011, the number of foreign tourists in Iran reached 3 million, contributing more than $2 billion to the national economy. The strong devaluation of the Iranian Rial since early 2012 is also a positive element for tourism in Iran.
Visitors.
The most up-to-date figures from the World Tourism Organisation for the origin of visitors to Iran show that building up visitors from the Islamic and wider Asian world will have to start from a low base. Around three-quarters of those entering Iran in 1999 came from Europe. Of those, as might be expected, only a minority were from western European countries.
According to Iranian officials, about 1,659,000 foreign tourists visited Iran in 2004 - although government statistics don't distinguish between tourism, business and religious pilgrims; most came from Asian countries, including the republics of Central Asia, while a small share (about 10%) came from North America and the European Union including Germany, Italy, Bulgaria, France, Belgium. The most popular tourist destinations are Esfahan, Mashhad, and Shiraz. There is undoubtedly great scope for increased visitors from the Islamic world, and possibly also from non-Muslim countries with which Iran is developing business and political links, such as China and India.
The majority of the 300,000 tourist visas granted in 2003 were obtained by Asian Muslims, who presumably intended to visit important pilgrimage sites in Mashhad and Qom. Several organized tours from Germany, France, UK and other European countries come to Iran annually to visit archaeological sites and monuments.
From 2004, the country experienced a 100-percent growth in foreign tourist arrivals until mid-2008 when the number of foreign arrivals surged up to 2.5 million. Specially, there has been an enormous increase in the number of German tourists traveling to Iran in 2008.
The World Travel and Tourism Council claims that business and personal tourism rose by 11.3% and 4.6%, respectively, in real terms in 2007, with the growth in personal tourism only modestly below that of the preceding year.
Visa requirement.
In general, Iran has tried to improve its complex and time-consuming visa application process and has begun to issue week-long visas for the nationals of 68 countries at airports. An online hotel reservation system has been developed. Iran will equip all airports with electronic visa facilities by February 2009 to issue online entry permits to foreign nationals.
Visas can now be secured electronically and be collected from Iranian consulates or international airports.
Iran has 15 road border crossings connecting it with Iraq, Turkey, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Armenia and Azerbaijan. Rail lines from Turkey and Turkmenistan can also be used to enter Iran. About 70% of visitors arrived by land in 2002, about 29% by air and less than 1% by sea. The price of internal flights is heavily subsidised, deterring competition and hampering profitability. In April 2005 the Imam Khomeini International Airport was reopened under the management of a consortium of four local airlines—Mahan Air, Aseman, Caspian Air and Kish Air—although no formal contract appeared to have been awarded.
Infrastructure and the economy.
In the early 2000s the industry still faced serious limitations in infrastructure, communications, regulatory norms, and personnel training. In late 2003 there were about 640 hotels in Iran and around 63,000 beds. 
In FY 2003 Iran had about 69,000 restaurants and 6,000 hotels and other lodging places; about 80 percent of these establishments were in urban areas. Some 875 restaurants and hotels were publicly managed by cooperatives and government organizations. More than 95 percent of restaurants and hotels had fewer than five employees, and only 38 had more than 100 employees. In FY 2002 this sector employed more than 166,000 people, 42,000 of whom worked in places of lodging. Of the 56,618 beds in all hotels, about half were located in three- to five-star hotels.
In recent years, 235 hotels, hotel apartments, motels and guesthouses have become operational nationwide. As at 2010, 400 hotels and 200 hotel apartments are under construction nationwide. Some 66 percent of these projects are underway in the provinces of Tehran, Gilan, Mazandaran, Razavi Khorasan and Isfahan.
Organization of Cultural Heritage and Tourism.
Iran's Cultural Heritage, Tourism and Handicrafts Organization is responsible for the establishment, development and operation of tourism facilities in Iran, planning for the repair or extension of tourism facilities through direct investment or providing loans to the private sector or entering into partnership with the private sector, issuing licenses and supervising the establishment and administration of hotels and restaurants and travel agencies and qualification and rating of these units. Investment in Iran's free trade zones are exempt from taxes for up to 20 years.
Area considered for further expansion in the tourism sector in Iran are eco tourism, coastlines, restoration of historical relics, handicraft townships, and health tourism (e.g. water therapy). 30,000 people come to Iran each year to receive medical treatment (2012).
Officials state that Iran has in recent years earned about US$1bn a year from tourism. Close to 1.8% of national employment is generated in the tourism sector. Weak advertising, unstable regional conditions, a poor public image in some parts of the world, and absence of efficient planning schemes in the tourism sector have all hindered the growth of tourism.
Iran's '20-Year Vision' document projects investment of over $32 billion in the country's tourism sector and tragets 20 million tourists by 2025. In order to encourage domestic and foreign direct investment in this sector, the 50 per cent tax exemption previously granted to tourism enterprises has been extended to include five-star hotels. Tariffs for utilities comply with industrial ones.
Outward tourism.
Traditionally, only a small number of wealthy Iranian tourists traveled abroad, and the majority of the trips were business departures, mostly to neighboring states in the Persian Gulf and the wider Middle East (1 mil. each year), Central Asia and Turkey (~1 mil.). Although this is likely to continue to characterize much Iranian travel abroad, since the change of regime in Iraq in 2003, Iranians from all walks of life have visited their western neighbor. In addition, a large proportion of Iranians traveling abroad are likely to be visiting family, especially in Europe, the US and Australia (~1 mil.). Up until early 2012, because the Iranian rial was overvalued, the Iranian government was subsidizing its travelers abroad (2010). In 2011, some 27 million travelers and businessmen passed the Iranian custom departments. Following the Iranian subsidy reform plan, airfares in Iran went up by 65% in 2012.

Beat Hollow

Beat Hollow (foaled March 22, 1997 in Great Britain) is a retired Thoroughbred racehorse who won four Group/Grade 1 races in Europe and the United States.
Trained by Henry Cecil, he was sent to the track at age two in 1999. He won his only start that year then won the Newmarket Stakes in his first start in 2000. Making just his third career start, Beat Hollow finished third to Sinndar and Sakhee in the 1½ mile Epsom Derby. He then won the Grand Prix de Paris at Longchamp Racecourse in Paris, France, a race which at that time was run at distance of 2,000 metres (1¼ miles).
Beat Hollow suffered from illness problems that kept him out of racing in 2001 but late in the year he was shipped to trainer Bobby Frankel in the United States. Back on the track as a five-year-old in 2002, Beat Hollow made eight starts on American turf. He won four races, three of which were Grade I events, plus had two second-place finishes and a third.
Retired to stud, Beat Hollow currently stands at Juddmonte's Banstead Manor Stud, near the village of Cheveley in Suffolk County. The best of his offspring to date has been Sea Moon.

Prioksko-Terrasny Nature Reserve

Prioksko-Terrasny Nature Biosphere Reserve () is one of Russia's smallest "zapovedniks" (nature reserves), sprawling over an area of 5,000 hectares along the left bank of the Oka River in the Serpukhov District of Moskva Oblast. It was established in 1945 as part of the Moscow Nature Reserve and is home to 900 plant species, 130 bird species, and 54 mammal species. A wisent nursery was established in 1948 to populate the region with European bisons from the Belovezhskaya Pushcha and Western Caucasus. There is also a small herd of American bisons.
Birds of the Prioksko-Terrasny State Biosphere Reserve.
On the territory of the Prioksko-Terrasny state nature biosphere reserve, covering 4945 ha, 134 species of birds from 14 orders (Ciconiiformes, Anseriformes, Falconiformes, Galliformes, Gruiformes, Charadriiformes, Columbiformes, Cuculiformes, Strigiformes, Caprimulgiformes, Apodiformes, Coraciiformes, Piciformes, Passeriformes) had been registered by 1991. Later 5 more species were observed here. Thus, by the present time, the list of species of birds registered in the Reserve numbers 139 species. About 55% from them are Passerines. Most of birds of the Reserve belong to migratory breeding species or to nomadic breeding species. Some species are vagrants in the Reserve and in the Moscow Region (nutcracker Nicifraga caryocatactes (L.), etc.). Birds, nesting in central parts of Russia and on the territory of the Prioksko-Terrasny Reserve, in autumn are migrating to south-west. Part of them are wintering in southern regions of Russia and near the Black Sea, others are flying to south-western part of Europe: the Balkans, the Apennines, South France, South Germany. The rest migrate across the Mediterranean Sea and fly to Northern Africa.
Forty-one bird species winter in the Prioksko-Terrasny Reserve. Among wintering species are: Northern Goshawk Accipiter gentilis L., Eurasian sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus L., Eurasian black grouse Lyrurus tetrix L., western capercaillie Tetrao urogallus L., hazel grouse Tetrastes bonasia L., grey partridge Perdix perdix L., long-eared owl Asio otus L., Tengmalm’s owl Aegolus funereus L., little owl Athene noctua Scop., Eurasian pigmy owl Glaucidium passerinum L., tawny owl Strix aluco L., green woodpecker Picus viridis L., grey-headed woodpecker Picus canus Gm., black woodpecker Dryocopus martius L., great spotted woodpecker Dendrocopos major L., white-backed woodpecker Dendrocopos leucotos Bechst., middle spotted wood Dendrocopos medius L., lesser spotted woodpecker Dendrocopos minor L., Eurasian jay Garrulus glandarius (L.), common magpie Pica pica (L.), hooded crow Corvus cornix L., common raven Corvus corax L., bohemian waxwing Bombicilla garrulous (L.), goldcrest Regulus regulus (L.), fieldfare Turdus pilaris L., long-tailed tit Aegithalos caudatus (L.), willow tit Parus montanus Bald., crested tit Parus cristatus L., coal tit Parus ater L., blue tit Parus caeruleus L., great tit Parus major L., Eurasian nuthatch Sitta europea L., common treecreeper Certhia familiaris L., house sparrow Passer domesticus (L.), Eurasian tree sparrow ( Passer montanus L.), Eurasian siskin Spinus spinus (L.), European goldfinch Carduelis carduelis (L.) common redpoll Acanthis flammea (L.), red crossbill Loxia curvirosrta L., Eurasian bullfinch Pyrrhula pyrrhula (L.), yellowhammer Emberiza citinella L.
Prioksko-Terrasny Reserve is situated on the border of the subzone of European taiga with admixture of broad-leaved species and of subzone of broad-leaved forests of western type. Owing to this phenomenon among birds in the reserve, there are species from taiga faunistic complex and species from faunistic complex of broad-leaved forests of western type. Typical representatives of taiga faunistic complex are: western capercaillie Tetrao urogallus L., hazel grouse Tetrastes bonasia L., black woodpecker Dryocopus martius L., golcrest Regulus regulus (L.), fieldfare Turdus pilaris L., mistle thrush Turdus viscivorus L., redwing Turdus iliacus L., siskin ( Spinus spinus (L.), red crossbill Loxia curvirostra L., bullfinch Pyrrhula pyrrhula (L.).
Among typical representatives of faunistic complex of broad-leaved forests of western type are: green woodpecker Pinus viridis L., golden oriole Oriolus oriolus L., blackbird Turdus merula L., icterine warbler Hippolais icterina (Vieill.), blackcap Sylvia atricapilla (L.), pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca (Pall.), common rosefinch Carpodacus erythrinus(Pall.), greenfinch Chloris chloris (L.), hawfinch Coccothraustes coccothraustes (L.).
Among birds registered in the Prioksko-Terrasny Reserve, two species are enlisted in Red Data Book of the Russian Federation: osprey Pandion haliaetus L. and great grey shrike Lanius excubitor L.
Twenty-six species of birds registered in the Reserve are enlisted in Red Data Book of the Moscow Region. Among them: 8 species of birds of prey – osprey Pandion haliaetus L., European Honey Buzzard Pernis apivorus L., black kite Milvus migrans Bodd., hen harrier Cyrcus cyaneus L., Montagu’s harrier Cyrcus pygargus L., booted eagle Hieraetus pennatus Gm., greater spotted eagle Aquila clanga Pall., red-footed falcon Falco vespertinus L., 1 species of waders – great snipe Gallinago media Lath., 1 species of doves – stock dove Columba oenas L., 3 species of owls – Eurasian eagle owl Bubo bubo L., Eurasian scops owl Otus scops L., little owl Athene noctua Scop., 2 species of rollers – roller Coracius garrulous L., common kingfisher Alcedo atthis L., 1 species of hoopoe – common hoopoe Upupa epops L., 5 species of woodpeckers – green woodpeckers – green woodpecker Picus canus Gm., white-backed woodpecker Dendrocopos leucotos Bechst., middle spotted woodpecker Dendrocopos medius L., three-toed woodpecker Picoides tridactylus L. and 5 species of passerines – wood lark Lullula arborea (L.), great grey shrike Lanius excubitor L., Eurasian nutcracker Nucifraga caryocatactes (L.), barred warbler Sylvia nisoria (Bechst.), azure tit Paruus cyanus Pall.).

MW (manga)

"MW" is best classified as a thriller. The story follows a fictional Japanese priest, Father Garai, his lifelong connection to serial killer Michio Yuki, and a mysterious chemical weapon "MW" developed by the Occupying American Force in Japan.
This manga series is notable because it can be seen as Tezuka's response to the gekiga ("dramatic pictures") artists who emerged in the 1960s and 70s, and as an attempt to surpass their work. The gekiga artists of this period created gritty, adult-oriented works that sharply contrasted to the softer, Disney-influenced style with which Tezuka was associated, a style that was seen as being out-of-step with the times.
Also of note are the unapologetic and explicit homosexual relationships in the manga, back when they were still a novelty for the genre.
Story.
The banker Michio Yuki leads a double life. Besides his dayjob, he also engages in a series of kidnappings in which he usually will kill both the kidnapped person as well as the extorted victim, after he has reaped the ransome money. After his deeds, he seeks refuge with the Catholic priest Father Garai. The two men share a history, as 15 years prior, they were both the only survivors of a leak of poisonous gas at a military base on a small Pacific island near Okinawa, known as Okino Mafune Island. The men also share a homosexual relationship; after their first night together, the adolescent Garai raped the then-underaged Michio. However, Michio did not escape unscathed, as he inhaled a dose of the poisonous gas, MW, which drove him criminally insane. However, the incident had been carefully covered up and the island repopulated, while the military base was dissolved and the MW moved to another base.
Garai, feeling that Michio's misdeeds are in part his responsibility and also bound to his oath as a priest, chooses not to hand Michio over to the police but instead to assist him in his escape.
After tormenting his boss by murdering his daughter and robbing the bank, he works at impersonating his daughter. While simultaneously organizing funds for the boss' political party, Michio gains political influence and access to Eikaku Nakata, a politician whose re-election campaign his boss was supposed to manage. After taking over this job, Michio kills his boss on the night of Nakata's re-election. His boss had turned out to have been an assistant at the Okino Mafune Island townhall, who was away on the mainland at the time of the MW incident, while Nakata is revealed to have been the assemblyman who had coordinated the cover-up.
For his next step Michio, with the help of a leftist extremist group and Garai, kidnaps Taizo Yubashito, the CEO of a construction company, who had been tasked with the reconstruction of Okino Mafune Island and the relocation of the MW, which had been split into two amounts. One half of the MW had been transported to another military base, while the other half was brought to another hideout on the island. Michio and Garai bring Yubashito to Okino Mafune Island, and after Michio tortures him severely, Yubashito tells them that the MW is kept in a mass tomb. Upon their arrival at the tomb, they are ambushed by a military chopper. Yubashito is killed in the attack. Garai enters the tomb, only to find the containers are empty.
During the return to the mainland, Michio tells Garai that his intent is not revenge, but to mass-produce the MW and exterminate humanity. He formed this resolution due to long-term effects of the gas-poisoning taking their toll on Michio's body. Garai is disgusted by the plan, and resolves to stop Michio. He contacts a newspaper reporter, who then writes a story about the Okino Mafune Island incident. The article incites public outrage. In his investigation, the reporter also uncovered that the rest of the MW had been transported to a military base near Tokyo.
Michio, on the other hand, during his honeymoon with Mr. Nakata's daughter, breaks a safe-cracker out of jail. Upon his return, and after murdering his wife and desecrating her body, he enters the Tokyo military base with the safe-cracker, thanks to the help of an unsuspecting Lieutenant General Minch and his wife, with both of whom Michio has sexual relations. The two torture Minch to give up the location of the MW, and proceed towards the vault. Garai, who also made his way to the base, is on their heels. A third party, that includes a public prosecutor named Meguro, who investigated the case starting with the serial abductions, is also after Michio. Finally, the military has noticed that General Minch has gone missing, and they put the base on alert.
After he enters the vault, Michio fills a bag with some MW gas. After a series of cunning moves and threats of releasing the MW from the bag, he makes his way to Minch's private jet. He boards the jet with Garai, Minch and two children of another military officer. While engaging in another liaison with Garai, Michio gives the bag to the children, telling them not to open it unless someone besides him tries to take it from them.
However, the party has to make a stop at Tokyo Airport, to switch to another plane. Prosecutor Meguro takes advantage of this and places Michio's brother, who shares a striking resemblance with Michio, on the original plane while able to chase Michio and his party back onto it where Michio forces Minch to take off again. Michio's brother is able to exchange the bag, which the children are guarding, with an identical bag filled with air. Michio discovers this and a fist-fight breaks out. Michio gets hold of a bag and releases the valve, only to find out it's the air-filled bag. Garai grabs the bag filled with MW and jumps out of the plane into the ocean and drowns. Minch shoots Michio.
The plane returns to Tokyo, where the case is discussed in the Japanese Diet. Mr. Nakata, however, is not in this discussion, as he suffered a cerebral softening after he learned about the demise of his daughter as well as the disfigurement and dismemberment of her body. The book closes with Michio's brother grinning at the reader, which raises the question of whether this is Michio's brother or in fact Michio himself.

Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher

Waltons Stores (Interstate) Ltd v Maher (1988) 164 CLR 387, 62 ALJ 110, is a leading case in Australian contract law. The Australian High Court decided that estoppel, in certain circumstances could be a cause of action. 
Facts.
Maher owned some property with buildings on it in Nowra. He was negotiating with a department store company called Waltons Stores for a lease of the land. They wanted an existing building to be demolished and a new one erected.
In reliance on representations made before a contract was completed, Maher demolished the building and started to erect a new one. But the contract never came to completion because Waltons Stores did not sign the lease. Waltons told their solicitors to slow the deal while they did further investigations as to whether the transaction would be good business, but allowed Maher to remain under the impression that the deal would be completed.
Judgment.
The High Court held that to avoid detriment through Waltons' unconscionable behaviour, Waltons was estopped from denying the contract. But not only the reliance interest was protected. The award given protected the expectation interest (as if the contract had been concluded).
Mason CJ and Wilson J, ‘the creation or encouragement by the party estopped in the other party of an assumption that a contract will come into existence or a promise will be performed and that the other party relied on that assumption to his detriment to the knowledge of the first party.’
This entails that if the plaintiff acts to their own detriment, in reliance on the allusions of the unconscionable party, equity law has the capability to intervene.

University of Forestry, Sofia

The University of Forestry, (, often abbreviated as LTU) based in Sofia, is a state university with six faculties with a total of 30 departments. The university is located in the university suburb in Sofia, close to the Technical University and the University of Chemical Technology and Metallurgy. The University of Forestry has two Forestry Training and Research Centers: the first one outstationed near the village of Yundola in the coniferous forest belt, and the other in the village of Barzia in the broadleaved forest belt. It also has one Training and Experimental Field Station in Vrazhdebna suburb of Sofia.
For more than 80 years now, the University of Forestry has been the only university in Bulgaria providing education in forestry, forest industry and landscape architecture. In the 1990s, the range of scientific fields was expanded to include ecology, agronomy, veterinary medicine and business management.
In mid 1990s, the University adopted the three-level degree system of bachelor, master and doctor degrees. At that time, it also introduced the European Credit Transfer System.
The motto of the University is "Bulgarian traditions and European standards in education". As an educational institution the University of Forestry strives to establish an academic environment in which values such as professionalism, freedom of speech and thought, humanism, collaboration and tolerance are encouraged.
History.
In 1923, the Faculty of Agronomy at Sofia University (SU) established the Department of Silviculture, preparing the way for the Forestry Division at SU to which the University of Forestry traces its roots. Two years later, in 1925, the Forestry Division at SU was set up, and on 20 February 1925 the Academic Council of SU decided that the division should commence its educational activities by immediately enrolling the first 10 students of forestry.
In 1947, the Forestry Division of SU merged with the Forestry Division of Plovdiv University to establish the Faculty of Forestry at SU. This faculty was one of the four faculties that laid the foundations for setting up the Agricultural Academy in 1947. With Decree of the National Assembly of Bulgaria, dated 12 January 1953, the Agricultural Academy was restructured and three separate universities were established: Georgi Dimitrov Agricultural Academy, the Higher Veterinary Medicine Institute and the Higher Forestry Institute.
The Higher Forestry Institute was renamed the University of Forestry with Decree of the National Assembly of Bulgaria, dated 27 July 1995.
Faculties.
The university has the following faculties:

Michael Edward Edgerton

Michael Edward Edgerton (born October 31, 1961 in Racine, Wisconsin) is an American composer and Associate Professor of music composition & theory at the University of Malaya. He his D.M.A. in music composition from the University of Illinois at Urbana (1994); the M.M. from Michigan State University (1987) and the B.A. from the University of Wisconsin–Parkside (1984). From 1996 to 1999, Michael was a Postdoctoral Fellow with the National Center for Voice and Speech, based at the Waisman Center at the University of Wisconsin – Madison. He has studied composition with William Brooks, Morgan Powell, Jere Hutcheson and August Wegner.
Awards/Recognition.
His compositions have received prizes or recognition in the
Style.
Since mid-1990 Edgerton has been pioneering the compositional use of scaled & desynchronized multidimensional networks in order to unlock nonlinear phenomenon inherent in mechanical sound production systems (voice & musical instruments). These procedures utilize topological inquiry focused on little traveled regions of the total sonic map. For Edgerton, these multidimensional networks do not just focus on articulation, which is dominant with many who utilize multi-parametric organization. Rather, with Edgerton, these networks utilize all structural components of the mechanical system: power, source, resonance & articulation in order to affect a meaningful (perceptible) sound difference from ordinario. Additionally, more than a focus on unusual sounds or performance practice, the systematic use of desynchronized procedures coupled tightly to expected bifurcations amongst attractor states are utilized as intelligent generative procedures encompassing the consonance/dissonance and musical tension of these extra-complex sonorities (tones that exceed a single fundamental frequency with gradually sloping spectra).
In works such as "adjusting to beams falling" and his "String Quartet #1", he attempts to convey an expression
similar to Edward Said’s notion of an artwork exhibiting “intransigence, difficulty, and unresolved contradiction” in order to provide an “occasion to stir up more anxiety, tamper irrevocably with the possibility of closure and leave the audience more perplexed than before... to explore...a nonharmonious, non-serene tension, and above all, a sort of deliberately unproductive productiveness, going ‘against’...”
Linkage. Other composers who have worked with desynchronized &/or multidimensional networks include Richard Barrett, Aaron Cassidy, Frank Cox, Julio Estrada, Brian Ferneyhough, Klaus K. Hübler, among others. Edgerton’s work is sometimes associated with New Complexity in Music.
Voice.
Edgerton is a specialist of the extra-normal voice as composer, pedagogue, researcher and performer.
Voice composition: Edgerton has written numerous compositions involving normal and extra-normal voice. Since the mid-90s his voice compositions have focused on searching for the bio-acoustic limits of vocal sound production that involve: 1) nonlinear phenomena; 2) simultaneous sound sources in the vocal tract; 3) multidimensionalty of vocal sound production. Additionally, Edgerton has incorporated sound production procedures seen in ethnic musical traditions from Tuva, Tibet, South Africa, Korea and India, to name a few. Representative compositions featuring the extra-normal voice include: #82 Cataphora, #77 A Marriage of Shadows, #68 prana, #62 Anaphora, #54 Friedrich’s Comma, #45 Taffy Twisters, among others.
Voice pedagogue: Edgerton is a teacher of voice, focusing on methods of extra-normal voice production that extend western avant-garde (anti)traditions, which are influenced from nonwestern music and informed by voice science. Edgerton’s methods are, in the first instance, based upon the healthy voice (i.e. bel canto) that attempt to explore the biodiversity of sound production, in order to expand the limits of the voice – particularly those involving nonlinear phenomena. Edgerton gives individual lessons as well as workshops.
His pedagogical activities includes writings designed to spread the idea of systematic processes in voice exploration, these include a book (The 21st Century Voice), two forthcoming book chapters - one in The Oxford Handbook of Singing (Oxford University Press) and the other in Teaching Singing in the 21st Century(Springer Publishing), and two collections of pedagogical compositions, each focused on a separate aspect of the extra-normal voice (Conners Publications).
Voice Research: In 1995 Edgerton was asked by Barney Childs and Phillip Rehfeldt, then editors of the New Instrumentation Series at the University of California Press to contribute a book discussing extended vocal techniques. As a result Edgerton applied for and received a 3-year Postdoctoral Fellowship from the National Center for Voice and Speech (1996 to 1999) to conduct research for this project. Under the supervision of Diane Bless, Michael began the formal study of voice science which has led to the publication of articles and his book, The 21st Century Voice, as part of the New Instrumentation Series – now with Scarecrow Press, a division of Rowman & Littlefield Publishing Group.
Voice performer: Edgerton as performer focuses on contemporary & ethnic-influenced vocal music as well as in improvised settings. Edgerton views the process of voice production as similar to electro-acoustic composition in which the elements of production: power {airflow}, acoustic source {vocal folds or upper vocal tract disruption}, resonators {lower, upper, nasal vocal tract} and articulation {tongue, velum, lips, etc} are identified and separately emphasized in order to change timbre or even the class of sound production.
Edgerton has improvised with Mathias BAUER, Frédérique BRUYAS, Axel DÖRNER, FERN Chern Hwei, Andrés GALEANO, GOH Lee-Kwong, Johan VAN KREIJ, Romain MERCIER, Izumi OSE, Hugues VINCENT, Yong YANDSEN, Etienne ZIEMNIAK.
A cd of improvised performance to the text of The Raven by Edgar Allan Poe, in three versions: one in translation by Charles Baudelaire, one in translation by Stéphane Mallarmé, and the original by Poe. The cd was a collaboration by Frédérique Bruyas and Edgerton and is titled the raven/le Corbeau edgar Poe published by Escargot MNT.

Devil's Punch Bowl (Hamilton, Ontario)

Devil's Punch Bowl is a 37 metre ribbon waterfall on the Niagara Escarpment, in the Stoney Creek community of Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. It is found in the "Devil's Punchbowl Conservation Area", maintained by the Hamilton Conservation Authority, and features an escarpment access trail with connections to a recently improved section of the Bruce Trail. Stoney Creek's Dofasco 2000 Trail is nearby. The Punch Bowl is also known as "Horseshoe Falls" for the distinctive shape of the cliff-face, in which somewhat resembles its much larger cousin.
In addition to the 800 km-long Bruce Trail, nearby attractions include the historic Battlefield House Museum and Nash-Jackson House; on Lake Ontario, Fifty Point Conservation Area and Confederation Park; and Mohawk Sports Park and the Hamilton Museum of Steam & Technology in the city proper. There's also a convenience store, restaurant, motel, gas station and retail stores nearby.
"Lower Punch Bowl Falls" is a curtain waterfall located a few metres north of the Punch Bowl, spanning 7 metres in height and width.
History.
The history of the Devil’s Punchbowl dates back to over 450 million years ago. It was formed throughout the years by many glacial waters; it withholds different layers of colorful stratified rock segments. The falls drops about 108.25 feet. Another monument that is considered part of the Devil’s Punchbowl is the ten-meter high cross that overlooks the Stoney Creek community and Hamilton Harbor. This cross was made in December 18, 1966 in memory of George Sinclair (George Sinclair Homes) by his son William Sinclair (1925-1994). He built the cross to bring light to the community. Originally the cross was only planned on being lit up during Christmas and Easter for six weeks. However, with the help of the donations from the Knights of Columbus the cross lights up automatically every night. There are numerous stories surrounding in how Devil’s Punchbowl got its name, some believe that individuals that God would not want his creation named after him instead, he named it after the “devil.” Another assumption states that moonshiners set up their wares on the road leading up to the Punchbowl, when the workers got thirsty they would go up to the falls to get some cold water. The moonshiners were viewed as individuals that did “devil’s work” giving the monument its current name today.
Geology and Geography.
The Devil’s Punch Bowl originated 450 million years ago when materials that form the Niagara escarpment were originally deposited in an inland sea. Corals and other organisms that lived in the area became fossilized as the sea bottom deposits changed into rocks.
The formation of the Devil’s Punch Bowl occurred 1 million years ago after one of the four great ice ages. As the ice slabs that covered the area melted at the end of the ice age, high levels of water occurred. These streams of fast moving waters carved out the land and formed what would become the Devil’s Punch Bowl. 
Formation of the Devil’s Punch Bowl has declined since its original formation; it often dries up or is only a trickle. However, stream still picks up during rain and as snow is melting. The site also has two distinct waterfalls in the upper and lower regions.
Today it has become a famous landmark amongst geologists worldwide because of its exposed rock strata. The stratigraphy of the Punch Bowl has been studied by geologists, including McMaster University students.
From the top of the escarpment a beautiful view of various locations can be seen such as; East Hamilton, Burlington, Stoney Creek and weather permitting, the Toronto sky line can become visible as well.
Entertainment.
The Devils Punch Bowl has been an ideal spot for various movies, television shows, and attractions. In the movie Silent Hill directed by Christophe Gans in 2006 the movie opens to a young girl trying to jump of a cliff into a dark world of “fire and metal”. This cliff was the edge of the actual Devil’s Punch Bowl overlooking the waterfall and rock bottom below. Her mother then saves her from jumping and the director cuts to a clip of them beside the falls with the “Keeper of the Cross” image in the background of the scene. In the blockbuster cinema, The Big Hit (1998), scenes from the area are shown that highlight the waterfall and the surrounding area. In 1989 Super Dave Osborne performed a yo-yo stunt at the Devil’s Punch Bowl that had his fans taking about the stunt for weeks.

Baku–Batumi pipeline

The Baku–Batumi pipeline is the name given to several pipelines and pipeline projects to transport kerosene and crude oil from the Caspian region to the Georgian Batumi oil terminal at the Black Sea. When first constructed in 1906, it was the world's longest kerosene pipeline.
Kerosene pipeline.
Together with oil developments in the Baku area, the need for construction of the oil pipeline from Baku to the Black Sea rose. The first pipeline proposal was submitted by Russian engineer I. Ilimov already in 1878. In 1880, Dmitri Mendeleev proposed the construction of Baku–Batumi pipeline to ensure the transportation of Baku oil to the world market. In 1884, the chief engineer Vladimir Shukhov of Bari engineering company published a scientifically based draft and estimate of the Baku – Batumi oil pipeline. Also the pipeline technical project was later designed by Vladimir Sukhov. In 1885, mining engineer I. Ilimov established the Caspian and Black Sea Oil Pipeline company. In December 1887, the Government of Russia granted to Ilimov the concession to establish the Society of the Caspian-Black Sea Oil Pipeline, a joint stock company. However, in 1891 the pipeline construction was postponed as premature, and the construction started only in 1896. At the first stage, the Batumi-Khashuri section was constructed, while the construction of Baku-Khashuri section was finished only in 1906.
The first pipeline was kerosene pipeline with total length of and 16 pumping stations. The diameter of the pipeline was mainly , but some parts had diameter of and . The pipes were produced at plants in Mariupol, Sosnovtsa and Yekaterinoslav (now Dnipropetrovsk). The pipeline was built along the railroad line and the telephone communication was arranged along the route. The initial pipeline capacity was 980,000 tons of kerosene per annum. Pumping stations were equipped with plunger pumps, driven by steam and diesel engines. The pipeline for its time was the longest pipeline in the world.
After the Bolshevik Revolution, kerosene deliveries through the pipeline were relaunched in March 1921 and on 20 May 1921, the first delivery of kerosene arrived at Batumi.
Crude oil pipeline.
The project of new pipeline was proposed in 1924. In 1925, the Soviet Union held negotiations with French companies to set up a joint venture to construct and operate the Baku-Batumi crude oil pipeline. The intention was to use the pipeline for oil export to Europe, mainly to France. However, the negotiations failed as also failed negotiations with the United States companies. In 1927, the construction of the pipeline was awarded to Azneft, an Azerbaijani oil company. The project designer and construction manager was A.V. Bulgakov.
The construction started in May 1928 and the pipeline was opened on 30 April 1930. It supplied mainly Batumi refinery.
The crude oil pipeline had a diameter of and the length was . The pipeline had 13 pumping stations each equipped with three diesel pumps of 360 hp. The pipeline used over 60,000 German-manufactured pipes weighing a total of over 54,000 tons. Diesels for the pipeline were purchased from MAN AG, pumps from Crossley and generators from Theodor Bergmann.
Construction work was done on three sections simultaneously. The highest point was at the above of sea level. The first long section Khashuri-Batumi was completed on 13 February 1929, the second long section Mingechaur-Khashuri was completed on 15 December 1929, and the third long section Baku-Mingechaur was completed on 13 February 1930. The pipeline cost 49 million rubles.
The operation of the oil pipeline showed that it was incapable of transporting oil in planned amount and the capacity was needed to increase by 750,000 tons. In August 1942, the pipeline was dismantled in connection with the threat of penetration of German troops in that direction and its pipes were used for the construction of the Astrakhan-Saratov pipeline. In 1990s, some part of the pipeline were used for the construction of the Baku-Supsa Pipeline.
New pipeline.
There have been several proposals for the new Baku–Batumi pipeline. In 1994-1998, the Baku-Supsa Pipeline, which partly uses old Baku–Batumi pipeline route, was constructed. On 2 March 1998, Chevron Corporation agreed to reconstruct existing Khashuri-Batumi pipeline and construct Dubandi (Baku)- Khashuri pipeline. However, in May 2001 Chevron canceled this project and started to ship its oil from Tengiz Field through the CPC pipeline.
Kazakhstan's national oil company KazMunayGas, owner of the Batumi Oil Terminal, has shown interest to build the new Baku–Batumi pipeline, which together with proposed Trans-Caspian and Batumi-Constanţa connections would allow to supply KazMunayGas oil refineries in Romania (Rompetrol) and planned refinery in Batumi.

1669 Act for annexation of Orkney and Shetland to the Crown

The 1669 Act of Annexation was a Parliamentary Act passed during 1669 by the Parliament of Scotland to establish Orkney and Shetland's status as Crown Dependencies following a legal dispute with William, Earl of Morton, who held the estates of Orkney and Shetland.
The Act made Orkney and Shetland exempt from any ""dissolution of His Majesty’s lands"". In 1742 a further Act of Parliament returned the estates to a later Earl of Morton, however, the original act of Parliament specifically proscribes this, stating that any such change is to be ""considered null, void and of no effect"".
The 1669 Act specifically removed Orkney and Shetland from the jurisdiction of the Scottish Parliament and places it firmly in the care of the Crown, restoring the situation as it was 200 years prior at the time of the pawning of the islands by King Christian I of Denmark/Norway to Scotland's James III.[http://www.shetlandconversation.com/documents/]

St Michael-le-Querne

St Michael-le-Querne was a church in the City of London.
History.
Its dedication derives from a 12th-century reference to it being near a place “where corn is sold". Rebuilt in 1430, and beautified in 1617, the parish officers were re-appointed for the last time in July 1666.
Destruction.
The Mortality Bill for the year 1665, published by the "Parish Clerk’s Company", shows 97 parishes within the City of London. By September 6 the city lay in ruins, 86 churches having been destroyed. In 1670 a Rebuilding Act was passed and a committee set up under the stewardship of Sir Christopher Wren to decide which would be rebuilt. Fifty-one were chosen, but St Michael-le-Querne immediately to the north east of Paternoster Row in Farringdon Within Ward was one of the unlucky minority never to be rebuilt. Following the fire it was united to St Vedast Foster Lane and partial records still survive at IGI.

14th Punjab Regiment

The 14th Punjab Regiment was a regiment of the British Indian Army from 1922 to 1947. It was transferred to the Pakistan Army on independence in 1947, and amalgamated with the 1st, 15th and 16th Punjab Regiments in 1956, to form the Punjab Regiment.
Early history.
The 14th Punjab Regiment was formed in 1922 by amalgamation of the 19th, 20th, 21st, 22nd and 24th Punjabis, and the 40th Pathans. All six battalions were formed during the upheaval of the Indian Mutiny in 1857-58. The first five were raised by John Lawrence in the Punjab, while the 40th Pathans were raised as the Shahjehanpur Levy. The 20th and 22nd Punjabis served in China during the Second Opium War in 1860-62, while the 21st Punjabis participated in the Abyssinian Campaign of 1867-68. All battalions saw extensive service on the North West Frontier of India and took part in the Second Afghan War of 1878-80. The 20th Punjabis served in Egypt during the Anglo-Egyptian War of 1882. After the war, they were designated as the Duke of Cambridge's Own, when the duke became their honorary colonel. In 1900, they returned to China along with the 24th Punjabis to suppress the Boxer Rebellion. The 40th Pathans, who were for some time an exclusively Pathan unit, were sent to Tibet in 1904 as reinforcements for the Younghusband Expedition.
First World War.
During the First World War, the battalions of 14th Punjab Regiment served in all the major theatres of war. The 19th Punjabis, while serving in Persia had the unique distinction of being actively engaged against the Bolsheviks in 1918 during the hard-fought actions at Merv, Kaka and Dushak in the Russian Turkestan. The 40th Pathans greatly distinguished themselves in the fighting against the Germans in France and German East Africa, while the rest of the battalions served in the Middle East. 
All war-raised battalions were disbanded after the war. In 1919, the 22nd Punjabis and 40th Pathans took part in the Third Afghan War.
In 1921-22, a major reorganization was undertaken in the British Indian Army leading to the formation of large infantry groups of four to six battalions. Among these was the 14th Punjab Regiment. The line-up of battalions for the 14th Punjabis was:
The class composition of the new regiment was Pathans, Punjabi Muslims, Sikhs and Dogras. The new regimental badge was a five pointed star denoting the five rivers of the Punjab, with the number "14" in the center, surmounted by a crown with a scroll below, which read "Punjab Regiment". The uniform of the 14th Punjab Regiment was scarlet with green facings. Ferozepur in the Punjab was chosen as the permanent station for the Training Battalion. In 1923 the 1st Battalion was among the first Indian Army units selected for Indianisation of its officer corps.
Second World War.
During the Second World War, the 14th Punjab Regiment raised nine new battalions. Most of them were engaged in the bitter fighting against the Japanese in the Far East. The regiment had the misfortune of having four of its battalions being captured by the Japanese at Singapore and Hong Kong.
Post-independence history.
On the independence in 1947, the 14th Punjab Regiment was allotted to Pakistan Army. At the time, the active battalions were 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th. Sikhs and Dogras were transferred to the Indian Army and the regiment's new class composition was fixed as Punjabis and Pathans. The 5th Battalion (Pathans) was re-raised in 1952. In 1948, the 2nd and 4th Battalions fought in the war with India in Kashmir. In 1956, a major reorganization was undertaken in the Pakistan Army and larger infantry groups were created by amalgamating the existing infantry regiments. As a result, the 14th Punjab Regiment was amalgamated with the 1st, 15th and 16th Punjab Regiments to form one large Punjab Regiment. The four regimental centres were also merged and the combined centre moved to Mardan. The line-up of the new regiment was:

Aletes, son of Hippotes

Aletes () was a son of Hippotes, of Dorian ancestry, and a fifth-generation descendant of Heracles. He is said to have defeated in battle the Corinthians, taken possession of Corinth, and to have expelled the Sisyphids thirty years after the first invasion of the Peloponnesus by the Heraclids. His family, sometimes called the "Aletidae", maintained themselves at Corinth down to the time of Bacchis (that is, late 10th century BC). Velleius Paterculus calls him a descendant of Heracles, but of the sixth generation. He received an oracle, promising him the sovereignty of Athens if during the war, which was then going on, its king should remain uninjured. This oracle became known at Athens, and the Athenian king Codrus sacrificed himself to preserve the city.

37th (Howitzer) Brigade Royal Field Artillery

XXXVII (Howitzer) Brigade, Royal Field Artillery was a brigade of the Royal Field Artillery which served in the First World War.
It was originally formed with 31st, 35th and 55th (Howitzer) Batteries, each equipped with 4.5" howitzers, and attached to 4th Infantry Division. In August 1914 it mobilised and was sent to the Continent with the British Expeditionary Force, where it saw service with 4th Division until February 1915, when it was assigned to IV Corps. 55th Battery was withdrawn in May 1915, and assigned to 128th (Howitzer) Brigade. The Brigade joined the 7th Infantry Division in June 1915, and was broken up in May 1916. 
In May 1916, the artillery brigades of infantry divisions were reorganised; the pure howitzer brigades were disbanded, and their batteries attached individually to field brigades, in order to produce mixed brigades of three field batteries and one howitzer battery. Accordingly, the brigade was broken up and the batteries dispersed; 31st (less one section) to 35th Brigade, and 35th (less one section) to 22nd Brigade. D (H) Battery was formed for XIV Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery on 17 May 1916 with one section of 31st (H) Battery and one section of 35th (H) Battery.
A new XXVII Field Artillery Brigade was later formed in 75th Division in Egypt.

Sixwire is the self-titled debut album by the American country music band Sixwire. It was released on June 30, 2002 (see 2002 in country music) on Warner Bros. Records Nashville. The album produced two singles for the band on the "Billboard" Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts in "Look at Me Now" and "Way Too Deep", which respectively reached numbers 30 and 55 on that chart. The album itself peaked at number 38 on the Top Country Albums chart and number 32 on Top Heatseekers. Lead singer Steve Mandile produced the album.
Robert L. Doerschuk of Allmusic gave the album two-and-a-half stars out of five, saying that the band's "collective sound is seamless, spirited, and predictable[…]and their songs reflect all the attributes of commercial country." "Country Standard Time" reviewer Brian Baker was more positive, saying that he did not consider the band's sound country in nature but adding, "Sixwire makes great pop music that occasionally offers up the sonic touchstones of country[…]and they sell it all with truly impressive vocal harmonies."
