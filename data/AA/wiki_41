As a teenager, he formed part of a musical group ("Proyecto Malta") and practiced Lima lama martial arts. He dropped out of high school in his senior year because he wanted to dedicate himself fully to his singing career. He learned to play guitar and moved to Mexico City with some friends when he turned 18. In Mexico City he worked at the "L’Canto" bar and eventually was able to perform there as a singer.

On November 10 he became one of the five finalists of the competition. On December 1 he obtained the second place in the finals. His prize was 1.5 million pesos (approximately 140,000 US dollars) in cash, a brand new car, a contract with the Coca-Cola music tour and a contract for five records with Sony Music.
Acting career.
In March 2003 he sang the title song for the telenovela "Un nuevo amor" ("A new love") with the La Academia alumnus Miguel Ángel. He later joined the cast of the telenovela "Enamórate" ("Fall in love with me"). In May 2005 he released his first album titled "Víctor García" which debuted at number one. A month later, he starred in the telenovela "2 chicos de cuidado en la ciudad" ("2 guys to be careful with in the city") where he also sang the title song. In August he received a platinum album for the sale of more than 175,000 records in Mexico. The next month he made a presentation at the Reliant Center of Houston, Texas where he was cheered by more than 30,000 people.

Gérald Genta

Charles Gérald Genta (1931-2011) was a Swiss wristwatch designer, noted for his eponymous line of time pieces as well as his design work with other firms, including IWC, Universal Genève, Patek Philippe and Audemars Piguet, among others. Christie's" auction house of New York called Genta's work ""the Fabergé of watches"" by ", and as the "world's most complicated and pricey watches" by "The Wall Street Journal".
Biography.
Genta was born in Geneva to a Swiss mother and father of Piedmontese (Northern Italian) descent. At age 20, Genta finished jewelry and goldsmith training in his native Switzerland, earning a Swiss federal diploma.
Subsequently, Genta was recruited by Universal Genève SA, at the time one of the most recognized manufactures in both the U.S. and Europe for its chronograph models. After Universal Genève settled a patent dispute involving the micro-rotor caliber, Genta designed Universal's in the 1950s, as well as the Golden and White Shadows during the mid-1960s. The Shadows contained a micro-rotor, unisonic and accutron movement, the latter two a result of the "quartz crisis" starting in the late 1960s.
Genta's work with Universal would be a precursor to future collaborations with other brands in Switzerland and throughout Europe, including Omega's "Constellation" (1959); Patek Philippe's "Golden Ellipse" (1968). Audemars Piguet's "Royal Oak" (1970), IWC's "Ingenieur" (1976); Patek Philippe's "Nautilus" (1976); and Cartier's "Pasha de Cartier" (1997)
After starting his own brand in 1969, Genta would create the sonneries, among them the Gérald Genta "Octo Granda Sonnerie Tourbillion", which contained four gongs and an emulated Westminster Quarters bell ring at each quarter and on the hour, "the same melody rung out by London's Big Ben", and priced at $810,200. In 1994, he designed the "Grande Sonnerie Retro", the world's most complicated wristwatch, and priced at approximately $2 million. For private requests, Genta hand-designed the movements, dials and cases of his timepieces and employed limited or no external assistance, outsourcing or mechanization during the process; it was not unusual for a single watch to take up to 5 years to complete.
During the 1980s, Genta obtained special licensing with The Walt Disney Company and distributed a limited edition of Disney character watches to the public; previously, they had been an unofficial private request by one of Genta's repeat customers. The dials consisted of illustrations of Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Scrooge and Goofy, with cases made of 18 carat gold. Designed in Le Brassus, Switzerland, the watches retailed between $3250–$3650 in 1988.
Gerald Genta's clients have included professional athletes, business executives, rock musicians, rappers, movie stars, politicians as well as royalty, including Prince Rainier of Monaco, King Hassan II of Morocco, King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia of Spain, King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother of England.
After his eponymous company was acquired by Bulgari in 1999, Genta resigned and created a new venture called "Gerald Charles". As of 2010, Gerald Genta watches were marketed solely under the Bulgari brand. As Bulgari had been acquired by upscale French conglomerate Louis Vuitton–Moët–Hennessy in 2011, all "Gerald Genta" brand watches would in effect be products of the LVMH portfolio.
Genta died in August 2011 at age 80.

Kediri Regency

Kediri is a "kabupaten" located in East Java province, Indonesia.
Kediri regency is located in East Java province, Indonesia. Kelud mountain, one of the most active volcanoes in Indonesia, is located in Kediri. The capital of the regency is near to the border of Kediri city, just about 200 m. However, several regency government establishments are also located within Kediri city, administratively a distinct political entity. It is because both the regency and the city share common cultural and historical roots. The administrative division occurred only after the War of Independence. The regency shares borders with Jombang to the north, Malang to the east, Blitar and Tulungagung to the south, and Nganjuk to the west, as well as with Kediri city which is wholly encircled by the Regency.
The regency also contains the famed "Kampung Inggris", or English Village. Kampung Inggris is a small area in the district of Pare where over a hundred businesses offering various English courses are clustered. Students come from all over Indonesia to take courses in the English Village, where it is common for people to speak with each other in English (rather than Indonesian or Javanese) for the sake of practice.

Wyndhurst, Baltimore

Wyndhurst is a neighborhood located in the North District of Baltimore, Maryland. 
Wyndhurst is a square-shaped piece of land bordered by Northern Parkway on the north, Charles Street on the east, Wyndhurst Avenue on the south and Roland Avenue on the west. It comprises Tuxedo Park and Embla Park, which contain over 300 houses, and is also home to four schools, two religious communities, and several commercial establishments.
Nicholas Fessenden, president of the Wyndhurst Improvement Association, describes his community as such, "Tuxedo Park and Embla Park make up Wyndhurst as far as the residences are concerned," says Fessenden, "Then we have schools and institutions that are all part of the Wyndhurst neighborhood. Tuxedo Park and Embla Park are the older names, and together they make up Wyndhurst."
The former Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad tracks serve as the dividing line between the two sub-neighborhoods. On the West lies Tuxedo Park, with Embla Park on the east. The tracks are also now used as part of a hiking and biking trail in the area. 
History.
The entire area of Wyndhurst was purchased on October 12, 1694 by Stephen Benson, when it was known as Faux or Fox Hall. The land was passed from Benson to George Haddoway, who then sold it to John Bond in 1712. Bond sold the area land to Job Evans in 1727 who then sold it to Conrad Smith in 1758. In 1770, about of Wyndhurst were purchased or leased by Daniel Evans. Evans was an early leader in the Methodist community and founded the first Methodist society in Baltimore, building its first chapel on the property he purchased from Smith. 
During the 1850s, W.C. Wilson owned most of the northern section known as Springvale while Michael Alder possessed “Cherry Hill” in the south. By 1877, the land had been divided into approximately four quadrants. In the southwest stood Tuxedo Park. Today, Tuxedo Park contains about 300 households but has still managed to maintain most of the same layout and street names that were used when the site was first developed by the Kansas City Land Company in 1892. At that time, the land was owned by Daniel Alder, a relative of Michael Alder. Officials at the time gave the streets English-sounding names, a reference to the previous century’s rulers that is popular in residential areas in Baltimore. For example, Gladstone Avenue, which runs through Roland Park, was likely named for 19th century British prime minister William Ewart Gladstone.
By the turn of the century, over a dozen houses had been built along Wyndhurst Avenue, which was formerly called Cedar Lane. Other similar houses also began to pop up during this time as well in Tuxedo Park. The section likely gets its name from Tuxedo Park, New York, where Edward Bouton studied. Bouton, the first general manager of the Roland Park Company, was one of the primary developers of the area.
By 1912, about a third of the neighborhood had been developed; however, most of the houses and buildings were constructed during the 1920s in the classic two-story frame cottage style. While Tuxedo Park was being built in the southwest corner of Wyndhurst, Embla Park was being developed in the southeast portion. Compared with Tuxedo Park, the houses in the Embla section are larger and more were constructed before the dawn of the 20th century. Embla was listed in the 1887 Maryland State Office and Gazetteer, indicating that the neighborhood had its own post office.
The largest section of Wyndhurst, the northeast, was owned by David Perine, who later founded the Homeland section of the city. The land was sold to the Roland Park Company in 1924 and later became the plot on which the Cathedral for Mary our Queen and the Friends School were built. 
Mrs. A.M. Evans owned the northwest section of the city, of which became home to the Gilman Country School for Boys in 1910. Gilman was the first private day school for boys in the United States. This section of Wyndhurst is now also home to Roland Park Public School.
Wyndhurst Today.
Despite all the changes over time, Wyndhurst still stands on the same hilly surface and thick vegetation it always has. The area has thrived in recent years and saw its average house jump from $160,200 in 1998 to $236,404 in 2000. This change reflects the growing desire to be part of a neighborhood that is close to the city (less than 15 minutes from downtown), yet maintains a rustic, natural appearance. 
Many businesses that are associated with Roland Park today are actually part of the Wyndhurst neighborhood, including Eddie’s food market and the Roland Park Post Office. The Roland Park pool is even located in the heart of Embla Park. Other commercial areas in Wyndhurst include offices and stores on Wyndhurst Ave in Embla Park, as well as at the intersections of Lawndale and Summit Avenues and at Roland Avenue and Deepdene Road.

Vaporetto

A vaporetto is a waterbus in Venice, Italy. There are 19 scheduled lines that serve locales within Venice, Italy, and travel between Venice and nearby islands, e.g., Murano and Lido.
The name, "vaporetto", could be translated as "little steamer", and refers to similarly purposed ships in the past that were run by steam. The natives used to call the vaporetto Batèo. The waterbus line is operated by Azienda del Consorzio Trasporti Veneziano (Actv), the Venetian public transportation system. The system is necessary in Venice as the deep canals prohibit the building of underground railways, and there is no space for overground trains, leaving the canals as the only viable rapid transport system. Most vaporetti have disabled access.
It has twenty-four-hour scheduled service, with frequency varying by the line. Line 1 serves the Grand Canal. Several lines are limited to the summer season, April to October.
ACTV sells 12, 24, 36, 48 and 72 hour passes as well as single-journey tickets and 7-day passes.

Nuthall Temple

Nuthall Temple in Nottinghamshire, one of England's lost houses, was one of five houses built in the United Kingdom generally said to have been inspired by Palladio's Villa Capra in Vicenza. 
Only two 18th century examples remain: Mereworth Castle and Chiswick House. Both are today conserved as Grade 1 listed buildings. The fourth, Foots Cray Place, was demolished in 1950 after a fire in 1949, while the fifth, Henbury Hall, was built in the 1980s.
History.
Nuthall Temple was completed in 1757 towards the end of the Palladian fashion in England. Nuthall Temple does not follow the imitation of Villa Capra as closely as its earlier prototypes, although the homage to Palladio's concepts is strongly pronounced. In fact the house bears a closer resemblance to Rocca Pisana (1578) by Palladio's follower Vincenzo Scamozzi. This similarity makes the architecture of Nuthall extremely interesting as Scamozzi's building, like Nuthall, has a recessed portico rather than prostyle inserted within the facade. This was to become a strong feature of the neoclassical architecture which was to follow Palladianism in the United Kingdom and makes Nuthall avant-garde in its late Palladianism.
The design is attributed to Thomas Wright whose patron was a country landowner, Sir Charles Sedley. The house was designed around a 58 ft high hall beneath the central dome. The hall was decorated with rococo plaster-work of a standard easily equal to that at Claydon House. In 1778 Sedley commissioned James Wyatt to undertake a number of alterations. Externally these included the installation of Venetian windows on the garden front and the lowering of balustrades below some others. Internally the redesign of the music room in a neo-Classical style illustrated how much taste had changed within a short period of time
The final residential owner of Nuthall Temple was the Reverend Robert Holden, Rector of the Parish, whose family had owned the estate since Robert Holden purchased it in 1819 at auction for his second son. The Holdens were an established Derbyshire family who had both invested heavily in the purchase of land and through marriage ties had connections with many of the neighbouring
landowning families. In the early nineteenth century Nuthall was the home of a junior branch of the Holden family and although briefly let between 1844 and 1853 was well maintained including various improvements to both the
interior and exterior of the property.
When the Reverend Robert Holden died in 1926 his son Robert Millington Holden succeeded to the estate. Owing to falling agricultural rents and outstanding estate duties owed to the state he was forced to consider selling the property. Initially at
auction on the 2 November 1927 the Temple and parkland of 650 acres was left unsold. By the inter-war period, high taxation, agricultural decline and decreasing social and political control meant that landowners now focused increasingly upon financial survival over social splendours. Nuthall and its remaining land were subsequently sold privately. Fittings sold at auction in 529 lots on 23 and 24 May 1929.
Demolition.
The remaining shell was sold for £800 to J.H. Brough and Co. of Beeston, who later that summer presided over the public demolition. 
On 31 July 1929 the west wing was loaded with firelighters, sprinkled with paraffin and set alight to the delight of a large expectant crowd. The weakened structure was then pulled down wall by wall
The ruined shell of Nuthall remained, once all of saleable value including much of the building material had been claimed, until 1966 when this too was finally pulled down in order to make way for the extension of the M1 motorway. The site of the former house is now under one of the slip roads at Junction 26 within the remnants of its parkland landscape.
Some features of the house were incorporated into Temple Wood House in Frogshall, Northrepps.

Spun Gold

Spun Gold is the fourteenth studio album by American country artist Barbara Mandrell. The album was released in July 1983 on MCA Records and was produced by Tom Collins. "Spun Gold" produced two major hit singles on the "Billboard" Country Singles chart in 1983.
Background and content.
"Spun Gold" was recorded in February 1983 in Nashville, Tennessee and contained ten tracks of new recordings. The album mainly consisted of Country pop-influenced material mixed with song themes that discuss the hardships of working-class people. It included a duet with country artist Steve Wariner entitled "Overnight Sensation". "Allmusic" reviewer Greg Adams compared background guitar on the track "In Times Like These" to the guitar "riff" on Ike & Tina Turner's single, "Proud Mary". He also considered the single, "One of a Kind (A Pair of Fools)" to have a "strong hook and pure pop production". Overall, Adams only gave the release two out five stars, calling the material "disco-era glitz". Adams also found the album's cover to be displeasing saying, "Meanwhile, Mandrell is decked out on the album cover like a high-fashion model in gold lame'. Dolly Parton has always been able to negotiate these kinds of apparent contradictions, but Mandrell does not have the same gift."
"Spun Gold" was issued on an LP album in its original release, with five songs on each side of the record.
Release.
"Spun Gold" spawned two singles in 1983. The lead single from the album was the opening track "In Times Like These". The song was released to radio in March 1983 and reached a peak of #4 on the "Billboard Magazine" Hot Country Songs chart and #6 on the "RPM" Canadian Country chart. The second single "One of a Kind (A Pair of Fools)" was released in July 1983 and became Mandrell's final number one single on the "Billboard" Country Singles Chart and also reached the same position on the Canadian "RPM" Country Tracks chart. "Spun Gold" was also released in 1983 and peaked at #5 on the "Billboard" Top Country Albums chart and #140 on the Billboard 200 albums chart.

1974 Norwegian First Division

The 1974 Norwegian First Division, Norway's first-tier football league, was contested by 12 teams and was won by Viking, one point ahead of the newly promoted team Molde. This was Viking third consecutive league championship, and the fourth total. HamKam, Sarpsborg and Raufoss was relegated to the 1975 Norwegian Second Division. 
Team changes from 1973.
Frigg, Lyn and Fredrikstad was relegated from the 1973 Norwegian First Division, and was replaced by Sarpsborg and Molde who won their 1973 Norwegian Second Division groups, in addition to Vålerengen who won the promotion play-off against Bryne and Mjølner.
Season summary.
Molde, who were playing in the top-flight for the first time since the 1957–58 season, won their three first matches and were leading the league in 9 of 22 rounds. Molde were in the lead with three matches left to play, despite a 0–2 loss at home against Viking, but when Vålerengen won 4–3 against Molde after a match-winning goal from Terje Olsen in the next match, Viking was the top of the league. Before the last match, Viking was leading one point ahead of Molde, and they won their third consecutive championship after they beat Strømsgodset in the last match. Viking had the opportunity to win the double, but lost the 1974 Norwegian Football Cup final 3–1 against Skeid.
Viking's goalkeeper, Erik Johannessen kept a clean sheet for 672 minutes during the season, which is still a Norwegian record as of 2012. Molde's Odd Berg became the top goalscorer in the league with 13 goals.
HamKam, Sarpsborg and Raufoss were relegated at the end of the season. This was HamKam's first relegation from the top league, and the club has later been relegated eight times, which is a Norwegian record. Sarpsborg FK had previously been one of the big clubs in Norway, but their spell in the top-flight in 1974 was their last, and for the next 36 years the town of Sarpsborg did not have a first-tier team until Sarpsborg 08 played in Tippeligaen in the 2011 season. Raufoss, who did not win a match until the 20th round, has not been able to play in the top league again.

Bruce Dalling

Bruce Dalling (16 August 1938 – 7 July 2008) was a Springbok South African yachtsman, national hero, also advocate and farmer, best known for taking second place on elapsed time and first on corrected time for the monohull award in the 1968 Observer Single-Handed Trans-Atlantic Race.
Biography.
Dalling was born in Johannesburg to Kathleen and William Dalling, a mining captain. He matriculated at St. John's College in Johannesburg, after which he went to sea and then joined the Hong Kong Police for two years. While living in Hong Kong, he took up yachting and participated in major races including the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race. After returning to South Africa he was a crew member on the South African yacht "Stormvogel".
He studied for an agricultural degree at the University of Natal and became a lecturer in agriculture. He then studied law and became an advocate during the mid-1970s, practising mainly in Pietermaritzburg and Durban. He gave up due to ill health in 1982 and then turned to lecturing at the University of Natal. He went farming in Howick, KwaZulu-Natal, but still served as an assessor in high court cases.
He owned his own aircraft, a Cessna 210 Centurion named "Charlie" and participated in sky-diving and was instrumental in establishing the Pietermaritzburg Parachute Club.
He was married to Carol and had three children, a son, William, who is a pilot for Cathay Pacific in Hong Kong and two daughters, Kerry and Cathy.
The Yacht "Voortrekker".
For the 1968 Observer Single-Handed Trans-Atlantic Race, Dalling was selected out of 40 applicants to skipper the yacht "Voortrekker", a 50 ft ketch designed by the naval architect, Ricus van de Stadt, and built of wood-composite construction by Thesens of Knysna for the Springbok Ocean Racing Trust and sponsored by the Rembrandt Group of Companies.
"Voortrekker's" strength lay in her planking, consisting of three layers of Malaysian Meranti glued together with a fibreglass coat for binding and waterproofing and weighed 6½ tons, including the keel. She was half the weight of any equivalent-sized racing yacht. She was equipped with a sparsely designed two bunk cabin. Perhaps the only aspect where the minimalist approach was not adopted was to the range and ability of the navigational equipment. She turned out to be one of the fastest racing yachts in her class.
Sea trials were conducted in Table Bay and False Bay before she was sailed from Cape Town to Plymouth for the 1968 OSTAR.
After the race "Voortrekker" returned from the USA to South Africa on board the Safmarine freighter "SA Weltevreden". She was hoisted by crane off the special cradle that had been assembled for her transportation across the Atlantic and lowered into the water at Cape Town docks. After the mast had been stepped, Bruce sailed her along the Atlantic seaboard for ninety minutes where many fans had assembled to welcome the sailor home. "Voortrekker" then docked at Granger Bay, where Vice-Admiral Hugo Biermann, Dr Anton Rupert - head of the Rembrandt Group that underwrote the venture and Cape Town mayor, Mr G.E. Ferry along with other dignitaries gave him a hero's welcome.
The 1968 OSTAR.
Thirty five yachts entered the race of which thirteen were multihulls. The race started on June 1 departing from Plymouth England for Newport, Rhode Island.
The race was by now acquiring a reputation for pushing forward the technology of ocean sailing, and the 1968 edition featured the first ever use of computer-based weather routing. A far cry from today's laptop-laden yachts, this consisted of a land-based mainframe computer, the English Electric KDF9, linked by radio to 25-year-old school teacher Geoffrey Williams in his boat "Sir Thomas Lipton". Although outside private routing advice of this kind is no longer permitted in most "unassisted" races, it is now routine for ocean sailors to do similar analyses using their on-board computers to process public weather information.
Williams created another story by his use of the "shortcut" through the Nantucket Shoal. This dangerous route was supposed to be illegal, but due to an error the race instructions required skippers only to keep south of Nantucket, instead of Nantucket Light. Williams successfully navigated the treacherous route in a gale. Gales were a major feature of the race, with a large storm on the 11th - 12th of June, and Hurricane Brenda, both contributing to the large number of retired and abandoned boats; Dalling described this storm as one of the worst he had ever encountered and one that he would remember for a long time. Water 4 ft deep washed over the deck and flooded his electric generator, when it came into the ketch through an exhaust pipe on the deck. As a result he was without power, explaining his radio absence during a large part of the race. "Voortrekker" was driven back 60 miles during the storm and broke her main boom, necessitating a jury rig. One casualty was Éric Tabarly, aboard his new trimaran "Pen Duick IV".
Although won by a monohull, this race saw the multihulls firmly established on the scene. The multihulls were led by the controversial proa "Cheers"; many observers felt that a proa was entirely unsuitable for ocean sailing, but she made a fast time along the Azores route
The race was won by Williams on "Sir Thomas Lipton" in 25 days 20 hours 33 min. However he had a 12 hour penalty for incorrect procedure at the start. Dalling completed the race in 26 days 13 hours 42 min, earning himself a place in yachting history.

Wine Festival of Cyprus

The Wine Festival of Cyprus is an annual festival in Limassol, Cyprus that celebrates wine and winemaking. 
The festival was first organized in 1961 and since then it has become an established annual event of merrymaking and fun, in which the citizens of Limassol are not the only participants; visitors come also from every part of Cyprus. Its reputation is spread beyond the geographic boundaries of the island. 
In September of each year, Limassol becomes the attraction of thousands of locals and tourists who visit the Municipal Garden to enjoy the Wine Festival with the motto 'Drink wine, it gives you life!' (Πίνε κρασί, νάσιεις ζωή). They become the protagonists of the Festival banishing from their minds all concerns and worries, free from social conventions or protocols, in an atmosphere of unconditional fraternization, generated by the effects of free wine provided by local wineries ETKO, KEO, SODAP and LOEL. The Wine Festival can be regarded as a variant and a revival of ancient festive manifestations of worship in honour of Dionysus, the god of wine, and Aphrodite, the goddess of beauty and love. During these feasts people worshiped their gods, but primarily enjoyed themselves.
Limassol Wine festival.
The Limassol Wine festival is an annual event aimed to celebrate Cyprus's rich viticulture. Since the first festival in 1961, it is organised annually in late August to early September. It is organised by the municipality of the city of Limassol at the grounds of the municipal gardens. 
It has an annual attendance in excess of 100,000 visitors that include locals and many tourists. The four big wine cooperatives (KEO, SODAP, ETKO and LOEL) along with many smaller independent producers offer free tasting of their wine portfolio.

A hackerspace (also referred to as a hacklab, makerspace, or hackspace) is a community-operated workspace where people with common interests, often in computers, technology, science, digital art or electronic art, can meet, socialize and/or collaborate.
Activities.
Hackerspaces can be viewed as open community labs incorporating elements of machine shops, workshops and/or studios where hackers can come together to share resources and knowledge to build and make things.
Many hackerspaces participate in the use and development of free software, open hardware, and alternative media. They are often physically located in infoshops, social centers, adult education centers, public schools, or on university campuses, but may relocate to industrial or warehouse space when they need more room.
Hackerspaces with open membership became common within Germany in the 90s in the orbit of the German Chaos Computer Club, with the C-base being probably the most impressive example. The concept however was limited to less than a dozen of spaces within Germany, and did not spread beyond borders at first. Most likely this was because initial founding costs were prohibitive for small groups without the support of a large organization like the CCC.
In 2006, Paul Bohm came up with a fundraising strategy based on the Street Performer Protocol to build Metalab in Vienna, Austria, and became its founding director. He and others started the Hackerspaces.org community in 2007 which maintains a list of many hackerspaces, and documents patterns on how to start and run them. As of 2012, there are an estimated 700 to 1,100 active hackerspaces all over the world and the numbers are growing.
Most recently the advent of crowdfunding and Kickstarter have put the tools required to build hackerspaces within reach of an even wider audience. Right now those tools are for example used by Bilal Ghalib, who had previously worked on a Hackerspace documentary, and others to bring the hackerspace concept to the Middle East.
Functions.
The specific activities that take place at hackerspaces vary from place to place. In general, hackerspaces function as centers for peer learning and knowledge sharing, in the form of workshops, presentations, and lectures. They usually also offer social activities for their members, such as game nights and parties. They typically provide space for members to work on their individual projects, or to collaborate on group projects with other members. Hackerspaces may also operate computer tool lending libraries, or physical tool lending libraries.
The building or facility the hackerspace occupies is important, because it provides physical infrastructure that members need to complete their projects. In addition to space, most hackerspaces provide electrical power, computer servers and networking with Internet connectivity. Well-equipped hackerspaces may provide machine tools, audio equipment, video projectors, game consoles, electronic instrumentation (such as oscilloscopes and signal generators), electronic components and raw materials for hacking, and various other tools for electronics fabrication and building things. Some hackerspaces provide food storage and food preparation equipment, and may teach courses in basic or advanced cooking. Tools and material for sewing, craft, and art are also important at many hackerspaces.
Organization.
The individual character of a hackerspace is determined by its members. Many hackerspaces are governed by elected boards selected by active members in good standing. Elected officers may serve predetermined terms, and help direct decisionmaking with regards to purchasing new equipment, recruiting new members, formulating policy, conforming to safety requirements, and other administrative issues.
Membership fees are usually the main income of a hackerspace, but some also accept external sponsors. Some hackerspaces in the US have 501(c)3 status (or the equivalent in their jurisdiction), while others have chosen to forgo tax exempt status. University-affiliated hackerspaces often do not charge an explicit fee, but are generally limited to students, staff, or alumni, although guests from other hackerspaces are usually welcome to visit. Some hackerspaces accept volunteer labor in lieu of membership fees, especially from financially limited participants. In addition, some hackerspaces earn income from sponsoring and staffing high-tech flea markets, where members of the general public may buy and sell new and used equipment and supplies.
There is a loose, informal tradition at many hackerspaces of welcoming visitors from other similar organizations, whether across town or internationally. Free exchange of ideas, skills, and knowledge are encouraged, especially at periodic gatherings sometimes called build nights or open house days.
Difficulties.
In 2009 there was a debate about inclusionism and exclusionism within the hackerspaces community, Johannes Grenzfurthner and Frank Apunkt Schneider released a critical pamphlet about this struggle. The discussion is still ongoing.
Hackerspaces can run into difficulties with building codes or other planning regulations, which may not be designed to handle their scope of activities. A new hackerspace in Nashua, New Hampshire, for example, was shut down by the city for after an inspection in 2011. The main issues were venting of heat and fumes. It reopened after work was done to the building.
The difficulties with opening HackerSpaces and MakerSpaces within non-profit organizations, such as schools and public libraries include cost, space, liability, and availability of personnel.
Notable hackerspaces.
Over the years many hackerspaces have grown significantly in membership, operational budgets, and local media attention. Many have also helped establish other hackerspaces in nearby locations.
c-base (1995) from Berlin is recognized as one of the first independent, stand-alone hackerspaces in the world, not affiliated with a school, university, or company. "Wired" writes that "European groups, particularly in Germany, have a long tradition of this kind of activity". Another known German hackerspace is RaumZeitLabor, organizer of Trollcon.
Metalab, founded in 2006, is generally considered to have pioneered the funding principles that enabled rapid spread of the concept.
TechShop is the first chain of commercial hackerspaces. It was launched in October 2006. As of October 2012, there were six TechShop locations in the US: three in California and one each in North Carolina, Michigan, and Texas, the last a partnership with the Lowe's home improvement chain.
In August 2007, a group of North American hackers visited Europe "to get a sense for the potential of European 'hacker spaces'", and upon their return, the groups NYC Resistor and HacDC were set up in late 2007, with Noisebridge following in fall 2008.
Tokyo HackerSpace was initiated in 2009. Safecast.org (a global open data network for ionizing radiation monitoring) was formed around prototyping efforts there following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.
MakerSpaces have also begun to enter into public schools in the US. The first high school to open a true MakerSpace was in Sebastopol, California, and now even middle schools are starting to follow the trend. White Hill Middle school in Fairfax, California has now opened up their own MakerSpace with a class called "Makers and Hackers". The first public library to open a MakerSpace is the Fayetteville Free Library and is located in New York State.

Caiman

Caimans are alligatorid crocodylians within Caimaninae. The group is one of two primary lineages within Alligatoridae, the other being alligators. Caimans inhabit Central and South America. They are relatively small crocodylians, with the smallest being Cuvier's dwarf caiman ("Paleosuchus palpebrosus"), which grows to 1 m (3 ft) long and the largest being the black caiman ("Melanosuchus niger"), which can grow to 4 m (13 ft) or more. Several extinct forms are known, including "Purussaurus", a giant Miocene genus that grew to and the equally large "Mourasuchus", which had a wide duck-like snout.

Heavy Metal Thunder (video game)

Gameplay.
The game pits futuristic robots against one another in wrestling matches. The player controls a robot during battles using a four-icon menu. Three actions—strike, guard and grapple—can be executed at any time and augments the player's "beat meter". The fourth action, called "beat attack", can be performed once the beat meter is filled and inflicts special damage according to how hard the button is pressed. Icons sometime shake to indicate that they are recommended, but the player must react quickly as each turn is timed. A rock-paper-scissors set of rules determined the winner of each pair of actions.
Anime cut scenes and fictional sponsor information are displayed before the start of each match. The player's robot can be customized to alter its appearance.
Plot.
The game is set in a fictional Japan in the year 2980, in which competitive fights between radio-controlled robots has become a popular sport called "Robot-ress". The player takes on the role of Denki Akihabara, a high-school student whose family runs a butcher shop. Denki decides to become a Robot-ress master after learning about Heavy Metal Thunder, the world's strongest robot. At the beginning of the game, he receives a robot and an invitation to the Titan Fight tournament from his father, who is actually the world champion and owner of Heavy Metal Thunder. The Titan Fight is a competition in which losing robots are destroyed and their owners buried on Death Island. The plot spans roughly thirty years in total, with Denki over forty years old at the end of the game.
Development.
"Heavy Metal Thunder" was announced at a special event held by Square Enix in Shibuya, Tokyo on March 2, 2005, with the presence of Japanese band Sex Machineguns. It is loosely adapted from "Heavy Meta-san", a metal/hard rock show broadcast on TV Tokyo, hosted by gravure idol Yoko Kumada and sponsored by Square Enix. The characters of the game were designed by Harold Sakuishi, creator of the "" manga series.
The game was showcased in playable form at the Square Enix Party 2005 in Japan.
Music.
The music of "Heavy Metal Thunder" was composed by various heavy metal bands and musicians, including Michael Schenker and ex-Megadeth guitarist Marty Friedman. The eponymous song "Heavy Metal Thunder" written by the Sex Machineguns serves as the theme song of both the game and the "Heavy Meta-san" TV show. The soundtrack of the game was published in Japan by Toshiba EMI on September 7, 2005.
Reception.
The game sold 3,367 copies the week of its release. It received a score of 30 out of 40 by the Japanese gaming magazine "Famitsu". American multimedia website IGN considered the gameplay simple, but praised the amount of animation used and called the theme song "catchy". American website GameSpot echoed the comments, stating that the game relies on its atmosphere and cut scenes more than gameplay. IGN noted that the game would appeal to fans of "Heavy Meta-san" and hard rock in general.

<doc id="18380182" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18380182" title="Essential range">
Essential range

In mathematics, particularly measure theory, the essential range of a function is intuitively the 'non-negligible' range of the function. One way of thinking of the essential range of a function is the set on which the range of the function is most 'concentrated'. The essential range can be defined for measurable real or complex-valued functions on a measure space.
Formal definition.
Let "f" be a complex-valued function defined on a measure space, ("X", "μ") that also belongs to L∞(μ). Then the essential range of "f" is defined to be the set:
Note that: Another description of the essential range of a function is as follows:
The essential range of a complex-valued function is the set of all complex numbers "z" such that the inverse image of each ε-neighbourhood of "z" under "f" has positive measure.
The above description of the essential range is equivalent to the formal definition of the essential range and will therefore be used throughout this article.
Properties and examples.
1. Every complex-valued function defined on the measure space ("X", μ) whose absolute value is bounded, is essentially bounded. A proof is provided in the next section.
2. The essential range of an essentially bounded function "f" is always compact. The proof is given in the next section.
3. The essential range, "S", of a function is always a subset of the closure of "A" where "A" is the range of the function. This follows from the fact that if "w" is not in the closure of "A", there is a "ε"-neighbourhood, "V""ε", of "w" that doesn't intersect "A"; then "f"−1("V""ε") has 0 measure which implies that "w" cannot be an element of "S".
4. Note that the essential range of a function may be empty even if the range of the function is non-empty. If we let Q be the set of all rational numbers and let "T" be the power set of Q, then ("Q", "T", "m") form a measurable space with "T" the sigma algebra on Q, and "m" a measure defined on Q that maps every member of "T" onto 0. If "f" is a function that maps Q onto the set of all points with rational co-ordinates that lie within the unit circle, then "f" has nonempty range (clearly). The essential range of "f" however is empty for if "w" is any complex number and "V" any ε-neighbourhood of "w", then "f"−1("V") has 0 measure by construction.
5. Example 4 also illustrates that even though the essential range of a function is a subset of the closure of the range of that function, equality of the two sets need not hold.
Theorems.
Theorem 1
Every bounded complex-valued function defined on ("X", "μ") is essentially bounded.
Proof:
If |"f"| is bounded, then |"f"| < "a" for some "a" > 0 so that if "g" = |"f"|, then "g"−1("a", ∞) is empty and therefore has measure 0. This implies that the set "S" = { "x" | "μ"("g"−1(("x", ∞))) = 0 } is nonempty so that the essential supremum of "g" is less than infinity. Therefore, "f" is essentially bounded.
Theorem 2
The essential range of a complex-valued function, "f", defined on a measure space ("X", "μ") that belongs to "L"∞(μ) is compact if μ is a non-negative additive measure.
Proof
Let "S" denote the essential range of the function in question. By the Heine–Borel theorem, it suffices to show that "S" is closed and bounded. To show that "S" is closed, we will show that every convergent sequence in "S" converges to an element in "S". Let ("w""n") be a convergent sequence of points in "S" and let "w" be its limit. Let "V" be an ε-neighbourhood of "w"; we will prove that the inverse image of "V""ε" under "f" has positive measure. First of all, choose "N" such that "n" > "N" ≥ "w""n" belongs to "V""ε". Since "V""ε" is open and since "w""N"+1 belongs to "V"ε, we may choose a δ-neighbourhood, "V""δ" about "w""N"+1 that is contained in "V""ε". Since "w""N"+1 belongs to "S", the inverse image of "V""δ" under "f" has positive measure. Since "V""δ" is a subset of "V""ε", "f"−1("V""δ") is a subset of "f"−1("V""ε"). Noting that "f"−1("V""δ") has positive measure, it follows that "f"−1("V""ε") has positive measure. Since ε was arbitrary, it follows that "w" belongs to "S" and "S" is closed.
Note that since "f" is essentially bounded, there exists "a" such that "g"−("a", +infinity) has 0 measure where "g" = |"f"|. Therefore, if "w" is a complex number such that |"w"| > "a", and "K" = {"complex numbers z" | |"z"| > "a"}, then there is a "p"-neighbourhood, "V""p", of "w" that is contained in "K" (since "K" is open). Note that "g"−1("a", +infinity) = "f"−1("K") so that "f"−1("K") has 0 measure. If "f"−1("V""p") had positive measure, so would "f"−1("K") since "f"−1("V""p") is a subset of "f"−1("K"); a contradiction. Therefore, "f"−1("V""p") has 0 measure so that "w" cannot be an element of "S". This shows that "S" is a subset of the complement of "K" so that "S" is bounded.
Applications of the theorems and additional notes
1. Note that the essential range of a function always lies within a closed ball in R2 of radius equal to the essential supremum of the function.
2. An essentially bounded function is intuitively a function that is unbounded on a set of measure 0, i.e. a negligible set in a measure-theoretic sense. A bounded function is basically a function that is unbounded on the empty set (which is not mathematically precise but gives the basic idea). Since the empty set has measure 0, one can believe that every bounded function is essentially bounded. This fact is proven in theorem 1.
3. Note that the proof of theorem 2 is largely dependent on the fact that non-negative additive measures are monotone.

Public houses in Ireland

Public houses in Ireland, usually known as pubs, are establishments licensed to serve alcoholic drinks for consumption on the premises. Irish pubs are to be found in cities throughout the world.
Spirit grocers.
Until the arrival of supermarket and grocery chain stores in the country in the 1960s Irish pubs usually operated as a 'Spirit grocery', combining the running of pub with a grocery, hardware or other ancillary business on the same premises (in some cases, publicans also acted as undertakers, and this unusual combination is still common today in the Republic of Ireland).
Spirit groceries first appeared in the nineteenth century, when a growing temperance movement in Ireland forced publicans to diversify their businesses to compensate for declining spirit sales. With the arrival of increased competition in the retail sector, many pubs lost the retail end of their business and concentrated solely on the licensed trade. Many pubs in Ireland still resemble grocer's shops of the mid nineteenth century, with the bar counter and rear shelving taking up the majority of the space in the main bar area, apparently leaving little room for customers. This seemingly counter-productive arrangement is a design artefact dating from earlier operation as a spirit grocery, and also accounts for the differing external appearance of British and Irish pubs. Spirit grocers in Northern Ireland were forced to choose between either the retail or the licensed trades upon the partition of Ireland in 1922, so this pub type can no longer be found in the North.
Signage.
Ireland's pubs usually bear the name of the current or a previous owner, e.g. "Murphy's" or "O'Connor's", and traditional pub names are absent. Famous traditional pubs in Dublin which have the characteristics outlined above include "O'Donoghue's", "Mulligan's", "Doheny & Nesbitt's" and "The Brazen Head", which bills itself as Ireland's oldest pub (a distinction actually held by "Sean's Bar" in Athlone). Some pubs are named after famous streets, such as "Sober Lane" in Cork, which is named because of Father Matthew's Hall of Abstinence. Individual pubs are also associated with famous Irish writers and poets such as Patrick Kavanagh, Brendan Behan and James Joyce.
Elaborate exterior decoration is rare, but was typified by "The Irish House" on Wood Quay in Dublin, which was surrounded in 1870 by coloured friezes of nationalist heroes, and with iconic traditional themes such as round towers. Parts of "Ulysses" were filmed in this pub in 1967.
Northern Ireland.
Pubs in Northern Ireland are largely identical to their counterparts in the Republic except for the aforementioned lack of spirit grocers. Traditional pubs in Belfast include "The Crown Liquor Saloon" (owned by the National Trust) and the city's oldest bar," White's Tavern", which was established in 1630 as a wine shop. Outside Belfast, pubs such as the "House of McDonnell" in Ballycastle (a former spirit grocery retaining all the characteristics of the type) and "Grace Neill's" in Donaghadee are representative of the traditional country pub. "Peadar O'Donnell's" is a famous traditional pub on Waterloo Street in Derry, while "The Farmers Home" is another fine traditional pub in Strabane, County Tyrone.
Irish pubs and tourism.
The majority of 'traditional' pubs in Ireland today have been refurbished in a pastiche of the original style during the 1990s. Many were refurbished in this manner so as to increase their attractiveness to tourists by more closely resembling the 'Irish pubs' found outside Ireland; and thus have more in common with them (many were refurbished by the same outfitting companies) than the traditional pub type they purport to represent.
Pubs in tourist-oriented areas are also more likely to serve food to their customers, a recent phenomenon dating from the 1970s. Prior to this time, food was not served in the vast majority of Irish pubs, as eating out was uncommon in Ireland (except in "eating-houses" set up on market days) and most towns and villages had at least one commercial hotel where food was available throughout the day. The provision of meals in pubs ('pub grub') since this time is largely the result of an effort by Irish publicans to capture the tourist eating trade. The majority of traditional rural pubs not on the major tourist trails do not serve food; while traditional bars in urban areas such as Dublin, Armagh, Galway, and Sligo have responded to the increase in Irish people eating outside the home (a by-product of so-called 'Celtic Tiger' economy during the 1990s); and now provide meals throughout the day.
Following the introduction of the smoking ban in the Republic of Ireland, many pubs offer enclosed and often heated outdoor smoking areas. A similar law came into effect in Northern Ireland in April 2007.
Irish Pubs have been opened throughout the world, particularly in the 1980s and 1990s.
The vast majority of pubs in Ireland are independently owned and licensed, or owned by a chain that does not have any brewery involvement, generally meaning that nearly every pub sells a similar but extensive range of products. Some microbreweries operate their own pubs or chains of pubs, where the range is more limited, with only their own products and a few others.
Irish pub culture and etiquette.
For decades, the Irish public house has been a social and community hub for the people of Ireland. It functions as both a place to consume alcohol at leisure as well as a place in which to meet and greet the people of a locality. In many cases, Irish people will have one (or more) pubs which are referred to as 'the local' which is the pub which they frequent most often. There is generally a very close and mutual understanding and informality between the customer and the barstaff and, in many cases, particularly in country pubs, virtually all of the regular customers will know each other very well.
The etiquette in Irish pubs varies from place to place. Generally speaking, however, it is never necessary to 'tip' barstaff. The only exception to this rule might be in a pub which has waiters for serving food, or for staff at a hotel bar, or on special occasions or events when the bar staff show particular skill, hard-work or good-humour. But again, this is rare.
Irish pubs in North America.
The tradition of the Irish pub in the United States is a rich one and it is virtually impossible to find any city on the continent without its own unique representation of Irish pub culture. Many great examples of these pubs date from the early part of the last century and even the 19th century and most of them came into being as a result of large-scale emigration from Ireland since the 1840s.
The most recent wave of Irish pubs started appearing during the 1990s with the arrival of venues modelled on the great Victorian pubs of Ireland. The millwork and fittings for these pubs were usually crafted in Ireland and transported to North America, supporting their owners' claim that these pubs were authentically Irish. As this style of pub became very popular and successful, many more began to open across the United States. However, as the cost of importing millwork and fittings for an Irish pub became prohibitive, prospective owners looked more locally and nearly all of the required material is now more than adequately supplied from within the United States or Canada.
The financial and popular success of these pubs has been phenomenal and Irish pubs are now one of the largest and most prolific casual-dining concepts in North America. While many pubs are still owned by individuals of Irish origin, the vast majority of new Irish pubs being opened are owned by American or Canadian restaurant operators who recognise the very attractive business model and potential return on investment. In an industry where profit margins can be low, margins in Irish pubs are significantly higher than those achieved within the mainstream casual-dining sector, mainly because of the very high and profitable ratio of beverage to food. Irish pubs also have the ability to attract business during periods when their casual-dining counterparts are traditionally slow. Examples of the "Irish pub" concept translating to American casual dining include O'Charley's and Bennigan's. However, these are not true representations of the Irish Pub and their food is very much on the theme of American Roadhouse. The first ever convention for Irish Pub operators took place in Philadelphia during 2011, an immensely successful event that attracted nearly 200 operators from the US and elsewhere...
Often, the Irish theme extends only to the name and the decor, while the menus are much like those in other North American bars or full of faux-Irish dishes like "Irish nachos" and reuben egg rolls. True Irish Pubs in North America ensure that food is 'made from scratch', from fresh ingredients and using local produce where possible.

Finca Élez

Finca Élez is one of only nine "Vino de Pago" existing in Spain as of 2009. This is the highest category on the quality scale of Spanish wines and means that in addition to having a proven track record of consistent quality, the wines have to be both produced from estate-grown grapes and also have to be processed and aged in a winery ("bodega") located on the estate.
This Vino de Pago is located in the municipality of El Bonillo, in the province of Albacete (Castile-La Mancha, Spain) and acquired its status in 2002.
The Estate.
Finca Élez, owned by Manuel Manzaneque, has planted under vines of the following varieties: chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon, merlot, tempranillo and syrah.
The winery is located next to the vineyards at an altitude of 1,080 m above sealevel in the Sierra de Alcaraz range of mountains.
Climate.
The climate is continental (hot, dry summers; cold winters) with marked differences between daytime and nighttime temperatures.
Soils.
The soils are mainly clay-sand, with some other elements suchas as lime, marls and ochre clays.
Production.
Approximately 200,000 bottles/year.

Winnipeg Limited

The Winnipeg Limited was an overnight named passenger train operated by the Great Northern Railway between St. Paul-Minneapolis and Winnipeg, Manitoba. It competed on the route with the overnight "Winnipeger" of the Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railway (“Soo Line”), and the Northern Pacific Railway’s unnamed daytime passenger train.
The Great Northern Railway’s "Winnipeg Limited" was a train that evolved into a streamliner rather than becoming streamlined all at once. The "Winnipeg Limited" carried neither an observation car nor a dome car but it did have a club car. A typical consist of the period used streamlined head end cars, 48-revenue seat leg-rest coaches handed down from the "Western Star", a "Pass-"series 6-roomette, 5-double bedroom, 2-compartment sleeping car, a "Glacier-"series 16-duplex roomette, 4-double bedroom sleeping car both handed down from the "Western Star". A Canadian National Railway "Green"-series 6-section, 6-roomette, 4-double bedroom sleeping car was carried between St. Paul and Winnipeg nightly in the summer season that continued on to Vancouver, British Columbia, in the "Super Continental" west of Winnipeg. The only two cars exclusive to the "Winnipeg Limited" were the two "Club"-series cars rebuilt by Pullman in February, 1956, from "Glacier"-series sleeping cars. These two "Club"-series cars retained their 8-duplex roomettes at one end and two of the double bedrooms. The space formerly occupied by the other two bedrooms was replaced by a buffet, and where the remaining eight duplex roomettes had been became a 12-seat dinette and 12-seat lounge area. These two cars were numbered and named 1198 "Manitoba Club" and 1099 "Winnipeg Club" and were operated one per consist. With the addition of these cars to the "Winnipeg Limited" on March 1, 1956, the trains were streamlined with the following consists:

Gatis (name)

__NOTOC__
Gatis is a Latvian masculine given name borne by over 5,000 men in Latvia. The etymology of the name is disputed. Some of the suggestions include a possible relation to the Latvian word "gatavs" ("ready", "mature") or a derivation of an old form of the word "cat" ("kaķis"). Other versions suggest its possible relation to an old Latvian word "gātis" meaning "gates" or "river source". Another version suggests that the word is derived from the German name Gotthard. Its name-day is celebrated on 8 January.
The name is one of the relatively few surviving names of indigenous origin from among the great number that were revived or introduced during the Latvian National Awakening of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Indulis is a Latvian masculine given name, borne by more than 1,000 men in Latvia. Its nameday is celebrated on 2 January.
The name has two possible derivations, one from a Baltic word meaning "gift", and the other as a diminutive of Indriķis, the Latvian form of Heinrich.
Indulis was the name of the hero of the legend of Indulis and Ārija, the Latvian Romeo and Juliet, set in the 13th century during the German conquest, which relates the tragic love of Indulis, a Curonian chieftain, and Ārija, daughter of a German military commander. The name was revived, along with many other medieval names, in the late 19th century, and was brought to especial prominence by the poet and dramatist Rainis with the publication in 1911 of his play ""Indulis un Ārija"".
As a modern name, Indulis is better-known than many Latvian names because of Indulis Emsis, Prime Minister of Latvia in 2004, the first Green head of state in the world.

Cascadian (train)

The Cascadian was an American named train of the Great Northern Railway on its route between Seattle and Spokane, Washington. The "Cascadian" was officially listed as a streamliner on August 15, 1954.
The Great Northern Railway operated a daylight train between Seattle and Spokane that traversed the Cascade Mountains through the Cascade Tunnel. It then descended the eastern slopes through the Cashmere – Wenatchee apple growing region before crossing the Columbia River and climbing up to the high Columbia plain and the wheat fields of the Inland Empire. The "Cascadian" was a slow all-stops local train that required nine hours in either direction for the between Seattle and Spokane. Most passengers between these points traveled in the "Empire Builder" or "Western Star" overnight. Each of the two train sets consisted of a baggage-storage-mail car, a baggage 30’ Railway Post Office car — both generally heavyweights but painted in the "Empire Builder" dark-green and orange color scheme. Next came prewar 58 seat Luxury Coaches in the 938–943 class with up to three being assigned to each consist on the busiest days. When the "Cascadian" was officially listed as a streamliner on August 15, 1954 it was when the railroad added the café-coach cars to the "Cascadians". These cars, originally heavy-weights, had recently been remodeled and streamlined by GN shops in Minneapolis and carried the markers for the "Cascadians". These cars featured 18 revenue coach seats and a café with seating for sixteen. The "Cascadian" was powered by either EMD F-units or passenger equipped GP units between Seattle and Scenic, and between Wenatchee and Spokane. Between Scenic and Wenatchee was the electrified district of the Great Northern Railway and electric locomotives were assigned as power in this area until the electrified zone was discontinued in 1956. At that time whatever power assigned in Spokane or Seattle ran through. The "Cascadian" made its last run on August 15, 1959.

Pearson symbol

The Pearson symbol, or Pearson notation, is used in crystallography as a means of describing a crystal structure, and was originated by W.B. Pearson. The symbol is made up of two letters followed by a number. For example:
The two (italicised) letters specify the Bravais lattice. The lower case letter specifies the crystal class, and the upper case letter the lattice type. The figure gives the number of the atoms in the unit cell. IUPAC (2005) 
The letters A, B and C were formerly used instead of S. When the centering had a pair of opposite faces along the X-axis, it was called A-centered. Equivalent centering along the Y- and Z-axes were called B- and C-centered, respectively.
The fourteen possible Bravais lattices are identified by the first two letters:
Pearson symbol and space group.
The Pearson symbol does not uniquely identify the space group of a crystal structure, for example both the NaCl structure, (space group Fmm) and diamond (space group Fdm) have the same Pearson symbol "cF"8.

Gopher (train)

The Gopher and Badger were trains operated by the Great Northern Railway between Saint Paul, Minnesota and the Twin Ports of Superior, Wisconsin and Duluth, Minnesota.
The Great Northern introduced the services with two six-car streamlined trainsets on April 26, 1952. The two consists operated as the "Badger" for the morning trains #19 and #20, which operated in both directions as all-stop locals in 3 hours 58 minutes over the route. The late afternoon/early evening trains #23 and #24 operated as the "Gopher", over the same route, but as limited-stop express trains in 3 hours 30 minutes. In addition to Saint Paul and the Twin Ports, the "Gopher" stopped in Minneapolis, Cambridge, and Sandstone, Minnesota That's nearly the same route as the proposed "Northern Lights Express", except the "NLX" is not currently planned to serve Saint Paul.
The trains utilized six of the pre-World War II "Empire Builder" 58-seat luxury coaches, with four of these remaining as-built, and two converted to 44-seat coaches with galley for train service by an attendant at one's seat. Each consist was assigned a baggage/railway post office car with a RPO section; initially, one consist operated with a heavyweight, the other a lightweight. Each consist also carried a streamlined baggage express car built by the Great Northern Railway themselves; this car only operated in each day's "Gopher" schedule. Each consist then carried one of the 44-seat galley coaches and two of the 58-seat luxury coaches. The last car in each consist was a café parlor observation rebuilt by GN shops from heavyweight coaches the railroad had purchased at the beginning of the war from Pullman as parlor cars for rebuilding as coaches.
The entire consists were painted in Omaha Orange and Pullman Green paint with the gold Scotch-lite lettering and separation stripes paint scheme most commonly referred to as "Empire Builder". Even as there were variations in the consists regarding the baggage/railway post office cars, the power was even more interesting with one set powered by an A-B set of EMD F7s and the other train set powered by an EMD E7A.
The #1084 "Twin Ports" parlor observation car survives today, although the tail end has been modified. It has been owned by the Minnesota Transportation Museum since 1979.

Utah State Route 209

State Route 209 (SR-209) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Utah, following 9000 South and other east–west streets south of Salt Lake City. It connects I-15 in Sandy with the ski areas of Little Cottonwood Canyon, and, once an extension is complete, with the Bingham Canyon Mine.
Route description.
9000 South begins at 5600 West in West Jordan, and heads downhill within the Salt Lake Valley as it runs east. It crosses the Savage Bingham and Garfield Railroad line to the Bingham Canyon Mine (ex-D&RGW) at Welby, and state maintenance begins as SR-209 when 9000 South crosses SR-68. After crossing the Jordan River, SR-209 begins climbing through the eastern part of the valley, passing through Sandy, and curving into 9400 South after crossing SR-71. The route ends at SR-210 near the mouth of Little Cottonwood Canyon, where the valley gives way to the Wasatch Range.
History.
State Route 177 was designated in 1965 along 9000 South between SR-68 and US-89 in Sandy, in order to provide access to the new I-15. A second route - State Route 209 - was added in 1969, following 9400 South from US-89 east to SR-210. Due to increased traffic in the Sandy area, a new alignment of SR-210 was defined east of SR-71 in 1987 to connect 9000 South directly into 9400 South, and SR-210 was extended west over this proposed roadway and SR-177 to SR-68. A 2005 change extended it farther west over a proposed roadway to meet SR-48. , the extension has been built to 5600 West, though it is not yet state-maintained, and the remainder, plus a continuation to SR-111, is in the area's regional transportation plan.
Major intersections.
The entire route is in Salt Lake County.

Joseph Garat

Joseph Garat (31 December 1872, Bayonne - December 1944, Bayonne) was a former mayor of Bayonne, implicated in the Stavisky Affair.
Life.
A doctor in law, with a diploma from the École libre des sciences politiques in Paris, Joseph Garat practised as a lawyer until 1910, when he was elected a deputy and gave up practising law. A conseiller municipal of Bayonne from 1900, he was elected the town's mayor in 1908. Thus began the city's "first Garatist era", then he was re-elected mayor in 1912 and deputy in 1914. He was also elected a conseiller général in 1909, 1910 and 1928.
During the First World War, he volunteered despite being 42 years old and participated in the Salonica expedition, where his actions won him the Croix de guerre. Despite this, he was beaten in the legislative elections of 1919 and decided not to put himself forward for the municipal elections that same year. Joseph Garat, well-established in Bayonne as a radical deputy and mayor, did not resist the rising tide of the right which flowed across France and elected a "bleu horizon" ("blue the horizon") Chamber of Deputies.
Garat thus retired from politics and between 1919 and 1924 worked in a, dans un "cabinet d'affaires" in Paris. He re-took his seat as a deputy in May 1924, then became mayor of Bayonne again in 1925, thus beginning the "second Garatist era". He won all the elections - he was re-elected as deputy in 1928 and 1932, and as mayor in 1929. 
Nothing seemed able to stop his brilliant political career when in 1933 he was implicated in the Stavisky Affair. Imprisoned in Bayonne in January 1934, he was dismissed as mayor and conseiller municipal. The Radical Party decided on his exclusion in March 1934. At his trial in 1936, he was charged with lying in public writings and complicity in embezzlement and fraud. In effect, he was president of the Conseil d'administration of the Crédit municipal de Bayonne, an organisation founded by the notorious fraudster Stavisky, who was the originator of the scandal, which had allowed the misappropriation of tens of millions of francs. Garat was condemned to two years in prison. The Stavisky affair having marked his political death, he died in Bayonne in 1944, forgotten despite his important political career.

Khairy Pasha palace

History.
Khairy Pasha.
The Khairy Pasha palace was built in the 1860s by Khairy Pasha, the Ottoman Khedivate of Egypt Minister of Education. The residence was part of the early development of a new Downtown Cairo district, north of the historical commercial and government centers of Old Cairo and the Cairo Citadel that were the city's core for centuries and millennia. It was designed the neo-Mameluk style, and the completed tall and striking mediaeval Islamic faux crenelated palace inspired a regional design style. Its Mamluk mediaeval Egyptian revival style, along with Moorish Revival and other traditions of Islamic Revival architecture, were integrated with European Beaux-Arts, Second Empire, and Art Nouveau style influences were used throughout modernizing Cairo in creating the vision of the 19th-century ruler Khedive Ismail, who commissioned the new downtown district's 'Paris on the Nile' design. The Khairy Pasha palace set the tone until the
American University in Cairo.
The building briefly became the headquarters of the Egyptian University in the early 1900s, now Cairo University in Giza. The Khairy building was acquired by the American Mission in Egypt in 1919, and opened as the original 1920 American University at Cairo campus structure in downtown Cairo. It was dedicated to being a center for the cultural enrichment and modernization of Egypt.
In 2008 the AUC relocated its undergraduate and graduate programs to the new 'AUC New Cairo Campus' in New Cairo, a new 2001 satellite city around east of the 'AUC Downtown' campus. The university's continuing education programs remained at the 'AUC Downtown' with the main building still the converted Khairy Pasha palace.

Tomonohana Shinya

Tomonohana Shinya (born 23 June 1964 as Shinya Narimatsu) is a former sumo wrestler from Yatsushiro, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan. His highest rank was "komusubi." He is now a sumo coach.
Career.
He had been an amateur sumo champion at Nihon University but worked as a high school physical education teacher after graduation. He did not join the professional sport until March 1992, when he was nearly 28, an extraordinarily late age. (The Sumo Association have since changed its rules and all former amateurs must now make their professional debuts before the age of 25). He made his debut in the third highest "makushita" division, fighting out of Tatsunami stable. At just 174 cm and 100 kg, he was not much bigger than Mainoumi, the lightest wrestler at the time.
Tomonohana had winning records or "kachi-koshi" in his first twelve tournaments, reaching the second highest "jūryō" division in November 1992 and the top "makuuchi" division in July 1993. A popular wrestler, he was nicknamed "Sensei" because of his teaching background. He used a wide variety of techniques to counteract his light weight, and won the prestigious "Ginō-shō", or technique prize, in two consecutive tournaments in September and November 1993. In January 1994 he reached the "sanyaku" ranks at "komusubi", but turned in the first losing record of his career, 4-11, and never made the rank again. He was demoted back to "jūryō" in March 1996 and subsequent injuries prevented him from returning to the top division. Nevertheless, he carried on fighting until November 2001 when he announced his retirement at the age of 37.
Fighting style.
Tomonohana preferred a "migi-yotsu" or right hand inside, left hand outside grip on his opponent's "mawashi", and his speciality was "shitatenage", or underarm throw, which was his most common winning "kimarite". He used 34 different "kimarite" during his career, some of them extremely rare. In January 1993 he defeated Hananokuni with "izori", or backwards body drop, a technique that had not been seen at "sekitori" level since 1964.
Retirement from sumo.
Upon his retirement he used the elder name of Asakayama (currently owned by former "ōzeki" Kaiō) but in March 2006 switched to the Tamagaki name upon the mandatory retirement of its previous owner, the former Wakanami. He works as a coach at Tomozuna stable.

Chicagoan (ATSF train)

The Chicagoan and Kansas Cityan were a pair of American named passenger trains operated by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway. They ran from Chicago, Illinois to Wichita, Kansas, with a later extension to Oklahoma City.
On April 17, 1938, the Santa Fe introduced a pair of day trains using lightweight, streamlined cars from the Budd Company. These two, seven-car, lightweight, streamlined trains operated the route in 12 3/4 hours between end points. Shortly after entering service the train's western terminal would be moved to Oklahoma City, extending running times by three hours.
The inaugural runs of the two lightweight streamliners were operated with Electro-Motive Corporation E1A units numbered 8 and 9, but within a month the Santa Fe assigned 1 and 10 the numbers of the old Santa Fe Box Cab Diesel Passenger units 1A and 1B. After being rebuilt in the Santa Fe's Topeka Shops with an elevated cab at one end only and a new nose added at that same end, they really resembled two E1A units that had been involved in a head on collision, and the shops repainted the results in the Santa Fe "war bonnet" paint scheme. These became the regular power for the trains.
The "Chicagoan" and "Kansas Cityan" received new full-length "Big Dome" lounges in 1954.
Train consists.
At the train's inception, each of the two trainsets consisted of the following units:

Dehesa del Carrizal

Dehesa del Carrizal is one of only ten "Vino de Pago" existing in Spain as of 2010. This is the highest category on the quality scale of Spanish wines and means that in addition to having a proven track record of consistent quality, the wines have to be both produced from estate-grown grapes and also have to be processed and aged in a winery ("bodega") located on the estate.
This Vino de Pago is located in Retuerta del Bullaque in the region of the Montes de Toledo, Ciudad Real Province, Spain,
The first vineyard was planted back in 1987. Today the vineyard surface is about 28 hectares. Grape varieties planted are Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Merlot, Petit Verdot, Tempranillo and Chardonnay.
Its Cabernet Sauvignon is well known as one of the finest Cabernets ever made in Spain. As well as its Chardonnay.
Dehesa del Carrizal belongs to "Grandes Pagos de España" association.
Montes de Toledo.
It is the mountain range running east to west within the provinces of Toledo and Ciudad Real, between the topographical depressions of Tajo and Guadiana.
Many years went before these lands’ great ecological and landscape wealth was recognized, with two key dates in its history: 1885 marks the beginning of Madoz disentailment (where Dehesa del Carrizal is first named), and 1995 sees the declaration of Cabañeros National Park.
Bioclimatically and biogeographically the area is defined as siliceous Mediterranean mountains of the Southern Plateau, making it a rare mountainous configuration, very different from the neighbouring regions of Toledan Plateau (North), La Mancha (East), and Campo de Calatrava (South). Acidic soils, a more humid climate and its altitude (between 600 mts in the hillsides to 1,400 mts in the mountain tops) distinguish the region and the wines it produces.
Vineyards and winery.
In this natural environment, rich in botanical species and fauna, the first viticulture project of the Montes de Toledo was born in 1987 with the planting of 8 acres of Cabernet-Sauvignon vines, in Dehesa del Carrizal. These first 8 acres have become 28 today, where next to Cabernet-Sauvignon now grow Syrah, Merlot, Tempranillo, Petit Verdot and Chardonnay, all of them in the surroundings of the winery, and which in 2006 have been recognized with their own official Vino de Pago (then Denominación de Origen de Pago) designation.
The vineyards lay over a “raña” (local name for the hillsides at the foot of the Montes) composed of accumulated clay and quartzite pebble, formed from the mountain summit’s erosion during the Tertiary era. It is situated between 800 and 900 meters of altitude, north orientation.
The vineyard is conducted in espaliers, with drip support irrigation. The unique climate of the region brings an average of 700 mm of rain per year, which together with the predominant thermic inversion causes slow and full ripenings, harvesting in some cases by November.
Vinification, aging and bottling is all done in the winery, in a 1999 building next to the vineyard. The winery has all the necessary facilities for high quality production: gravity barreling, temperature-controlled stainless steel tanks, air-conditioned warehouses for barrel and bottle aging, etc.
The production building is partially buried in the mountain, its front facing the social areas built in classic Moorish brick. The main room enjoys a large fireplace and can fit 100 people.

Aretas William Young

Colonel Sir Aretas William Young was a British Army officer and colonial administrator of the early nineteenth century. After extensive military service in the Peninsular War and elsewhere, Young held a range of colonial government roles in the West Indies and Prince Edward Island, of which he was Lieutenant Governor. Young was knighted in 1834 for his colonial service, and eventually died in office at Charlottetown and was replaced by General John Harvey.
Life.
Young was born circa 1778. He entered the army in 1795 as an ensign, purchasing a captaincy in the 13th Regiment of Foot in 1796 and being deployed to Ireland during the Rebellion of 1798. In 1801, Young and his regiment were attached to General Abercromby's army in the Egyptian campaign and the fighting around Alexandria and in 1807 Young transferred to the 47th Regiment of Foot as a major. Young later served in all the major campaigns of the Peninsular War until 1813, when he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and attached to the administration of the island of Trinidad, captured from the Spanish 16 years before.
In 1815, Young was engaged in the invasion of Guadeloupe and for his service in the operation was commended by King Louis XVII. Between the end of the war and 1825, Young performed a number of roles as deputy to the Governor of Trinidad; commanding the 3rd West Indian Regiment and acting as an official on Grenada and Trinidad. For these services he was twice rewarded with large sums of money and ceremonial gifts by the island's Council of Assembly. In 1826, Young was made protector of slaves in Demerara and in 1831 was nominated to become Lieutenant Governor of Prince Edward Island off Canada following the sudden death of Sir Murray Maxwell, who briefly held the role.
Young was very successful in his governorship, being knighted in 1834 for his services. He died at Charlottetown the following year and was replaced by Sir John Harvey. Young was survived by his wife Sarah Cox and their children, who included Henry Young, later an important Australian politician.
Governors, Lieutenant Governors and Administrators 1769 to May 2009 - 'With the untimely death of Sir Murray Maxwell, Sir Aretas William Young became the sixth Governor of Prince Edward Island since the creation of the Colony in 1763. He married Sarah Cox, of Coolcliffe, Wexford, England, and they had several children, one of whom was Sir Henry Edward Fox Young, Governor of South Australia (1848–1855) and Tasmania (1855–1861). Sir Aretas William Young, British soldier, was born about 1778. He entered the army in 1795 as ensign, was captain in the 13th foot in 1796 and served in Ireland during the Rebellion of 1798. In 1801, he was on duty in Egypt and in 1807, he was advanced to the rank of major in the 47th Regiment. Subsequently, he was engaged in many battles of the Peninsular War and from 1813 he served in the West Indies as Lieutenant-Colonel, chiefly at Trinidad. In 1815 he was sent to join the expedition against Guadaloupe and received one of the badges of the Order of Merit from Louis XVIII. He was next placed in command of the troops in Grenada and, on his being ordered back to Trinidad, the Council of Assembly presented him with a sword valued at 100 guineas. From this time to the final disbandment of the 3rd West Indian Regiment in 1825 he administered the government at various times during the absence of Sir Ralph Woodford and was rewarded for the “candor, integrity and impartiality which had marked his administration” by 150 guineas for a sword and plate valued at £250. In 1826, he was appointed protector of slaves in Demerara (Trinidad). Young was appointed Governor of Prince Edward Island on 26 July 1831, a position he occupied until his death in office at Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island on 1 December 1835. In 1834 he was knighted. George Wright filled in as Administrator for the period of time following Governor Young’s death (1 December 1835) until the appointment of Sir John Harvey on 30 August 1836.'

The Comités developed out of the desire of the MUR (Mouvements Unis de la Résistance, or MUR) and the Free French Forces in London under general De Gaulle to give political representation to the Resistance forces fighting in France. In each commune, a Comité local de libération (local liberation committee) represent the Comité départemental de libération.

Utah State Route 88

State Route 88 (SR-88) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Utah, connecting Ouray to US-40/US-191.
Route description.
SR-88 begins at the south end of the Green River bridge near Ouray, within the Uintah Basin. It heads northwards, gradually climbing through the valley of that river, passing east of Pelican Lake, and onto a more rugged plateau just beyond the intersection with 4500 South (which carried SR-88 until 1969). The route's north end is at US-40/US-191 on this plateau.
History.
The state legislature defined State Route 88 in 1935, connecting Ouray to SR-6 (US-40) at Fort Duchesne. State Route 209 was created in 1941, heading north from SR-88 near Leota to US-40 east of Fort Duchesne. IN 1969, SR-88 was realigned to follow SR-209, with the old alignment to Fort Duchesne becoming a county road.
Major intersections.
The entire route is in Uintah County.

London Children's Ballet

The London Children’s Ballet (LCB) is a registered charitable trust created in 1994. LCB was formed to give children the experience of performing as part of a company, in a professionally produced, full length ballet at a professional theatre. LCB provides opportunities to dance for children from many diverse backgrounds and the experience is free.
Performances are staged annually at the Peacock Theatre, in the West End, London's famous theatre district. These performances include the staging of original productions, which have sold out every year since the company was established. The company is also involved in a number of smaller projects. The "£1 outreach matinees" enable the public to see a ballet at an affordable price and LCB2 is a touring company which visits venues where people are unable to attend the theatre, including hospitals, community centres, hospices and schools. These tours are produced around the year so as to provide opportunities for children all-year-round.
To dance in a LCB production, children must first attend an audition, designed to assess their suitability to take part. Successful candidates then meet for weekly rehearsals on a Sunday in the lead up to the performance, ensuring there is no disruption to their academic education. 
LCB organises an annual summer school, lasting a week and catering for one hundred children. The summer school consists of a range of workshops, where the children take classes in ballet and other dance forms such as jazz, and also study choreography. Older children also take part in a one-day tour, taking their summer school production to elderly homes around London. 
The LCB also provides a venue for recently graduated composers, choreographers and designers from the Wimbledon College of Art.
History.
Lucille Briance founded the LCB in 1994 after her daughter showed an interest in auditioning for dance schools. Lucille felt she was too young to join a proper dance school and thus looked for an alternative. Unfortunately there was no dance company for children that would allow her daughter to perform as well as keep up her academic studies. Lucille therefore decided to create one and the LCB was born. A choreographer was appointed and the auditions for the new company were advertised, successfully attracting children from many different parts of the community. After the first season, a composer was hired, so that the LCB could stage new and interesting works, appealing to the whole family. This was a success — the first new ballet premiered by LCB, "The Happy Prince", sold out.
Every year since, the LCB has successfully staged narrative ballets based on classic children's stories.

British Psychoanalytic Council

The British Psychoanalytic Council is an association of training institutions, professional associations and accrediting bodies which have their roots in established psychoanalysis and analytical psychology. They bring together approximately 1400 practitioners of psychoanalytic and psychodynamic psychotherapy (including psychoanalysts, Jungian analysts and child psychotherapists) who as individuals become registrants of the BPC.
The BPC (then the British Confederation of Psychotherapists) was formed on 8 March 1992, emerging from the United Kingdom Standing Conference for Psychotherapy (now the UKCP) as a specifically psychoanalytically-oriented organisation.
Annual register.
It has an annual register of those practitioners who meet its fitness-to-practise standards. Promoting professional standards and acting as a voluntary regulator of the profession is a key role of the BPC. Its registrants work across the public, voluntary and private practice sectors; many are senior clinicians in the core mental health professions and make important contributions to research in this field.
The BPC accredits the trainings of its member institutions, ensuring that they meet published training standards. Some of these are member organisations of the International Psychoanalytical Association.
Practise requirements.
An individual who qualifies from one of these trainings is then eligible for entry into the BPC's register. BPC registration then continues to be governed by a range of fitness to practise requirements:
Training and qualifications.
The preparation and training for becoming a psychoanalytic psychotherapist is lengthy and rigorous. The British Psychoanalytic Council requires its member institutions to maintain high standards, particularly in the selection of those who want to become psychotherapists. Most applicants for training will already have a background in medicine, psychology or social work and will also have experience in the mental health field.
Safeguarding the public.
The individual organisations that train psychotherapists have always been self-regulating. Over the last twenty years, however, there has been an increase in the number of institutions and range of psychotherapies on offer to the public. The British Psychoanalytic Council is one of a number of bodies which exist to protect the interests of the public by promoting standards in the selection, training, professional association and conduct of psychotherapists. It is the primary body for psychoanalytic psychotherapy in the UK.
The Government is in the process of creating a statutory framework for the registration of psychotherapists and psychoanalysts, by the Health Professions Council. It is anticipated regulation will come into force by 2011.
The BPC, together with each of its member institutions, aims to protect the public by setting out the appropriate standards of professional conduct, and a Code of Ethics, which describes the responsibilities of psychoanalytic psychotherapists. There are also comprehensive complaints and disciplinary procedures, which include the sanction of striking a practitioner off both their organisation’s membership list and the BPC’s Register. The detailed fitness to practise policies are all published on its website or are available from the BPC office.
Finding a therapist.
If someone feels they need psychotherapeutic help, they may wish to get some professional advice on their treatment of choice. In the first instance, this may be their GP. Alternatively, they may find it useful to have an initial consultation with a psychotherapist who would be able to advise on the best approach. Most of its member organisations operate a referral service.
If they decide that psychoanalytic psychotherapy is the right choice for them, they can either contact a therapist directly or go through a referral service. It is preferable to use the BPC website as this will contain the latest updated information, including whether the therapist is still a BPC registrant in good standing.
Time in therapy.
It is difficult to say how long treatment will take; it can vary from many months to several years. It therefore involves a substantial financial undertaking – although some practitioners offer reduced fee schemes. Each session lasts fifty minutes and may take place between one and five times a week.
Cost.
Fees vary between practitioners. They are discussed before treatment begins and can be reviewed in the light of developments. Most practitioners charge on a sliding scale based on what a patient earns and can afford – fees between £35 and £70 are typical with regional variations.
Reduced fee schemes.
In some areas, psychoanalytic psychotherapy is available at a reduced fee. This would normally require attendance of between three and five sessions a week. Experienced professionals who are completing their training whilst being supervised by a senior practitioner would usually provide the service. However some fully qualified therapists will offer a reduced fee and this can be discussed in the assessment interview.
Evidence of treatment.
It is appropriate to ask what scientific evidence supports the treatment approach. Some treatments do not have this, and should be avoided unless there is nothing better.
Further information on psychotherapy.
Psychoanalytic psychotherapy is a therapeutic process which aims to help people with distressing psychological situations and mental health problems. The process helps a person to understand these complex, and often unconsciously based, emotional and relationship problems. This can enhance their ability to manage their own feelings, life and their dealings with others, and by doing so can reduce symptoms and alleviate distress. Psychoanalytic psychotherapy creates a setting in which it is possible to experience and reflect on a person's difficulties as they manifest themselves in the relationship with the therapist which develops in the process of treatment. This form of therapy is not limited to dealing with what can be thought of as mental health problems. Many people who experience a loss of meaning at certain points in their lives or are seeking a greater sense of fulfilment can be helped by this approach.
Psychoanalytic psychotherapy is based on the observation that people sometimes try to deal with problems by trying to keep them out of their minds as a way of getting rid of them. However, they will continue to have an important effect on feelings and behaviour. Early experiences are important in shaping the way the mind works but a large part of our mind operates outside of one's consciousness. From an early age, people find ways of managing their experiences and this influences how we cope in later life. With the therapist's help a person can gradually come to understand these experiences and make sense of how we have dealt with them. This leads to a process of change, which takes place through the psychoanalytic session.
The therapist.
The relationship with the therapist is an important part of the therapy. He or she offers a confidential, safe and private place where the unconscious patterns of one's inner world can be played out. The safe setting that they create means that emotional conflicts can be relived and new solutions can be found to old problems. This process helps us to identify those patterns of behaviour, which we keep repeating. On becoming aware of old patterns, it then becomes possible to change them.
The psychoanalytic psychotherapist will reveal little about himself or herself. Although they may appear to be somewhat detached, the approach helps patients to express unconscious wishes and conflicts. The difficulties that patients may have in their lives, especially past conflicts, are reflected in the relationship between the therapist and ourselves. Although this experience can be uncomfortable, it is the basis for providing the kind of insights that help us to tackle problems.

History.
The club was the works team of engineering company GKN Sankey and played in the Shropshire County League from at least 1954 until 1960. In 1960 the club switched to the more senior Cheshire County League and played there until 1965, achieving a second-place finish in the 1963–64 season. This was followed by one season back in the Shropshire County League before the team joined the West Midlands (Regional) League in 1966. 
The club played in the West Midlands League until 1974, gaining promotion to the Premier Division in 1971. After dropping out of the league for two years, Sankey's returned in 1976, initially in Division 1(B). In 1981 the team was relegated to Division Two, but won the championship at the first attempt to gain promotion back to Division One. In 1983 the league was re-organised and Sankey's was one of a number of lower division clubs elected into the Premier Division on the strength of its facilities. The team spent five seasons in the Premier Division before the club was disbanded in 1988.

Mangalitsa

Mangalitsa (US spelling), Mangalitza (UK spelling) or Mangalica (original Hungarian spelling) belongs to European unimproved lard-type breeds (as well as "Iberian Black" and "Alentejana" pigs) that are descended directly from wild boar populations. The Mangalitsa pig is unusual as it grows a hairy 'fleece', akin to that of a sheep. The only other pig breed noted for having a long coat is the now extinct Lincolnshire Curly Coat of England. The Mangalitsa was formerly bred as a lard pig, and animals were large and round. Because of the drop in demand for lard, the breed's popularity has declined and it is now regarded as a "rare breed".
Name.
It is referred to as the "Mangalitza" in the United Kingdom and the "Mangalitsa" in the United States.
History.
The blonde Mangalitsa was developed from older hardy types of Hungarian pig ("Bakonyi" and "Szalontai") crossed with the "Hungarian Wild Boar" breed of Hungarian origin (1833) (and later others like "Alföldi". The development took place in Hungary in the early 19th century. The new quick-growing "fat-type" hog did not require any special care, so became very popular in Hungary. In 1927 the National Society of Fat-Type Hog Breeders ("Mangalicatenyésztők Országos Egyesülete") was established, with the objective of improving the breed. Mangalitsa was the most prominent swine breed in the region until 1950 (there were 30,000 of them in Hungary in 1943). Since then the popularity as well as the population of Mangalitsa have been decreasing, with the rising availability of food from farther away and refrigeration. Nowadays, the keeping of Mangalicas has become a popular hobby. There are currently slightly over 7000 Mangalitsa sows in Hungary, producing cca. 60000 porkers a year.
In March 2006, 17 Mangalitza were imported from Austria into the UK. These are registered with the British Pig Association (BPA) and the pedigrees are being maintained on the BPA Mangalitza Herd Book. Three of the animals are at Tropical Wings zoo in Essex.
The Swallow-bellied Mangalitsa breed was produced by crossing the blonde Mangalitza and the Black(which has gone extinct).
In 2007, Wooly Pigs, an American company, imported a herd of 24 Swallow-belly Mangalitsa gilts and boars to the USA.
In 2010, Pure Mangalitsa, based in Michigan, imported the first Blonde Mangalitsa pigs into the United States. 
Husbandry.
The Mangalitsa produces too little lean meat so it has been gradually replaced by modern domestic breeds. It is usually fed with a mix of wild pasture, supplemented with potatoes and pumpkins produced on the farm.
The primary product made from this pig is sausage, usually packed in the pig's duodenum. The minced meat is seasoned with salt, pepper, sweet paprika, and other spices. It is then eaten in slices with pickled vegetables. The pork is also served braised with sauerkraut, potatoes, and stuffed peppers as a side dish. Farmers also produce smoked hams. The fresh meat tastes strong and juicy; the suckling pigs are much preferred for their good fresh meat qualities.
In the UK, the breed is kept free-range, fed on standard Sow and Weaner Pellets. The higher quality and protein levels of this food results in a slightly larger stockier pig.
In Hungary, most Mangalitsa pigs are raised semi-intensively or intensively.
Mangalitzas will happily rear their young (who are born striped like wild boars) in outside arks all year round without the need for additional heat and light.
Killing weight (for meat production) is generally achieved beyond 12 months of age; much longer and the additional fat gained becomes too excessive for the UK market.
Meat from Mangalitsa can be easily found in Hungary, as Hungarian farmers produce about 60,000 animals each year.
Breeds.
There are three Mangalitsa breeds: Blonde, Swallow-bellied, and Red. They all have the same behavior; the only difference is the colour. The Blonde Mangalitsa is blonde, the Swallow-bellied (originally produced by crossing the Blonde Mangalitsa with the extinct Black Mangalitsa) has a blonde belly and feet with a black body, and the red (produced by crossing the Blonde Mangalitsa with the Szalonta breed) is ginger.
Other breeds (black, wolf, and baris) have died out as pure-bred forms, though their reconstruction from selective breeding of mixed varieties is being debated in Hungary.
In Popular Culture.
In a 2012 episode of Iron Chef America, "Morimoto vs Forgione", a whole Mangalitsa pig was the secret ingredient.

Chamkani (Pakistan)

Chamkani () is not only the name of a village In fact, Chamknai is a subtribe of Pashto speaking people. This tribe belongs to Afghanistan. "Khalid Bin Waleed" is also associated with this tribe. 
Originally the name was Samkani but later on it changed to Sokani/Sokano and finally Chamkani. Its people are called Sokaniwaal or Chamkanian. Part of Chamkani is also exists in Afghanistan (Paktia) province which is the origin. Some people of this tribe are in Kurrum agency Khyber pukhtoon khawa province, Pakistan.
The 2nd largest population are in Chamkani Peshawar, situated 7 KM east outside of Peshawar city.
According to 1998 census total population of village Chamkani was approximately 20,000, but increased more than 36,000 recently. More than 47% people migrated from other part of province. This include different people with different languages. Originally people of this land was hinko speaking people which are living here 800 years. Other surrounded villages are also ”Hinko” speaking.
Pashto speaking people are more dominant over hinko speaking. 
Hazrat Mia Umar Baba Chamkani (1973-1776) and Haji Darya Khan Baba (Abdul Khel) are the people who spent their lives for the guidance and education of the people. Haji Darya Khan Baba was actually Chamkanian and spent his life for the guidance of people thought Quran and Sunnah. He is buried in village Chamkani Peshawar. He has also the honor that he was the teacher of Hazrat Mian Umar Baba. Hazrat Mia Umar Baba was born in Farid Abad (Lahore) in 1673(1074 A.D). He got married in Chamkani and moved to Chamkani later on. He is also buried in Chamkani. However there were other religious scholars who had contributed in it.
Village Chamkani is divided in different parts called, Mohallas. Area is approximately 4332 meter square but increasing day by day as population. However it is still very easy to locate someone due to these names of "Mohallahs". There are 7 or 8 Mohallas with its clear boundaries. According to the area and population Mohalla Qadir Khel (now Qada Khel) is the largest among them. Rests are Yaseen Khel, Bahram Khel, Mustafa Khel, Khwaja Khel, Chugha Khel, Bazar Ghari, Mohallah Qasaban, Mohallah Mochian, Mohallah Qazian, Khaliq Abad, Kohatian No 1, 2, Saidan, Miskeen Abad, Zarin Abad, Miagan, Jamrood Abad, Jan Khan Gari, Haji Abad, Shekhan, Baba Khel and Abdul Khel.

Equation of State Calculations by Fast Computing Machines

Equation of State Calculations by Fast Computing Machines is an article published by Nicholas Metropolis, Arianna W. Rosenbluth, Marshall N. Rosenbluth, Augusta H. Teller, and Edward Teller in the Journal of Chemical Physics in 1953. This paper proposed what became known as the Metropolis Monte Carlo algorithm, which forms the basis for Monte Carlo statistical mechanics simulations of atomic and molecular systems. The attribution of the method to Metropolis is unfortunate, as "Metropolis played no role in its development other than providing computer time". In fact, the theoretical work was done by Marshall N. Rosenbluth, who later gained renown as one of the greatest plasma physicists of the 20th century. 
Monte Carlo methods are a class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to compute their results. In statistical mechanics applications prior to the introduction of the Metropolis algorithm, the method consisted of generating a large number of random configurations of the system, computing the properties of interest (such as energy or density) for each configuration, and then producing a weighted average where the weight of each configuration is its Boltzmann factor, exp(−"E"/"kT"), where "E" is the energy, "T" is the temperature, and "k" is Boltzmann's constant. The key contribution of the Metropolis paper was the idea that
The main topic of the article was the numerical calculation of the equation of state for a system of rigid spheres in two dimensions. Subsequent work generalized the method to three dimensions and to fluids using the Lennard-Jones potential. The simulations were done for a system of 224 particles; each simulation consisted of up to 48 cycles, where each cycle consisted of moving each particle once and took about three minutes of computer time using the MANIAC computer at Los Alamos National Lab.
To minimize surface effects, the authors introduced the use of periodic boundary conditions. This means that the simulated system is treated as a unit cell in a lattice, and when a particle moves out of the cell, it automatically comes in through the other side (making the system a topological torus).
According to a perspective published nearly fifty years later by William L. Jorgensen, "Metropolis et al. introduced the samplic method and periodic boundary conditions that remain at the heart of Monte Carlo statistical mechanics simulations of fluids. This was one of the major contributions to theoretical chemistry of the twentieth century." As of 2011, the article has been cited over 18,000 times.
In another perspective, it was said that although "the Metropolis algorithm began as a technique for attacking specific problems in numerical simulations of physical systems [...] later, the subject exploded as the scope of applications broadened in many surprising directions, including function minimization, computational geometry, and combinatorial counting. Today, topics related to the Metropolis algorithm constitute an entire field of computational science supported by a deep theory and having applications ranging from physical simulations to the foundations of computational complexity."

Danger Radio

Danger Radio (sometimes stylized as Danger: Radio) is an American rock band from Edmonds, Washington.
History.
Formation.
Danger Radio's lead vocalist (Andrew de Torres of The Scene Aesthetic) and drummer (Nico Hartikainen) met in middle school, soon after adding Marvin Kunkel as bass guitarist for talent shows and school gigs. Soon after, Matt Goodwin and Spencer Mertel were added to the band, both playing guitars. They recorded a few demos under the name Chasing Tomorrow but later changed the name to Danger Radio before recording their first EP, "The Difference Between Love And Envy", which was produced by Casey Bates (Gatsby's American Dream, Portugal.The Man, This Providence). 
In early 2005, Goodwin and Mertel left the band and were replaced by Andy Brookins and Elan Wright. The keyboard player Jackson Kellock joined soon after, making Danger Radio a six man band. 
With the new line up,Danger Radio recorded a demo in 2005 which would included early versions of songs that later appeared on the "Punch Your Lights Out" EP. The demo was produced by Tom Pfaeffle (Gatsby's American Dream, Kay Kay and His Weathered Underground, Wild Orchid Children). 
In late 2006, Jackson left the band and was replaced by Spencer Phillips in 2007. Shortly after, Danger Radio was signed to Photo Finish Records and released an EP, "Punch Your Lights Out", in 2007.
"Used and Abused" (2008-2010).
Their first full-length album, "Used and Abused", was released on July 8, 2008, on Photo Finish, and reached No. 17 on the "Billboard" Heatseekers chart.
Danger Radio have toured with PlayRadioPlay!, We The Kings, Metro Station, Forever the Sickest Kids, The Maine, The Cab, The Audition and label-mates Envy On the Coast. They also played on the second date of The Bamboozle in both May 2007 and 2008. In 2009, the band covered Britney Spears for their Hoodwink set and also played the second date of The Bamboozle.
They were originally scheduled to play on Vans Warped Tour during summer 2008, but dropped out in favor of a tour with Cute Is What We Aim For, Ace Enders and Powerspace, followed by a tour with Meg & Dia, Jonezetta and Dropping Daylight in the fall. Then they went on their first headlining tour with Brighten, Farewell and Red Car Wire. This included three dates in Canada. Later in 2008, they were to be touring with Family Force 5 and PlayRadioPlay!.
Bass guitarist Marvin Kunkel left the band in fall 2008 and was replaced by Tyler Brown Williams for dates with My American Heart, The Morning Of and Artist Vs Poet.
Danger Radio supported Forever The Sickest Kids on a UK tour, along with Furthest Drive Home starting February 8, 2009.
Nothing's Gonna Hold Us Down.
The band signed with Doghouse Records and released the follow-up to "Used and Abused", "Nothing's Gonna Hold Us Down", on July 27, 2010.

The company P

The company P is a Swedish production company that creates participant based pervasive and transmedia entertainment. The company P is known for its Emmy Award winning production The Truth About Marika and Emmy Award nominee The Conspiracy For Good. Marika is known as the first fully immersive TV tie-in.
Dollplay.
On Feb. 9, 2009, Fox launched "Dollplay," a participation drama centered on "Dollhouse". As an interactive webisodes and forum, Dollplay is more content to the canons of the show, as well as a viral marketing campaign. The campaign asked users on the Fox "Dollhouse" website to "Save Hazel!" Hazel is a character trapped inside the Dollhouse in real-time. The campaign is called "Dollplay" according to the official FOX press release. Dollplay is created by The company P "a radical production outfit from Sweden". Five videos released in a four-hour span show Hazel entering a room, turning on the light, and messing with a computer. That's when the room locks her in and it starts to move. She approaches the camera and yells for help and the transmission cuts off.
On Feb. 12, 2009, Fox opened the website up to further exploration, and interaction with the main character is now possible via Webcam. It is not yet clear how the character in the viral marketing campaign relates to the TV show "Dollhouse", but both deal with science fiction and mind control.
On Feb. 28, 2009, the "Dollplay" alternate-reality game ended with players saving the fictional Hazel. After Hazel is saved, she tells people that there are "Dollhouses" all over the world that imprint them and change them; these include schools, parents, religion and government. She essentially tells people to think for themselves and then leaves the container she is trapped in and the game ends.
Awards and recognition.
In 2007 The company P together with Swedish Television created The Truth About Marika that won an International Interactive Emmy Award for Best Interactive TV-service in April 2008.
In 2011 The Conspiracy For Good was nominated for an International Digital Emmy Award in the category Digital program: Fiction. In 2011 the project also won the Banff World Media Awards for Best Cross Platform and Best In Interactive. The Conspiracy For Good was also a South by Southwest Award finalist and Webby Award Honoree.

Cagliostro in Wien

Reception.
The premiere was highly successful, in no small part due to the audience favourite Alexander Girardi (1850–1918) as Blasoni. Another notable performer at the premiere was Marie Geistinger (1836–1903) who had created the role of Rosalinde in Strauss's "Die Fledermaus". However, weaknesses in the libretto and the –by Strauss's standards– pallid music meant the work could not garner the level of long-term public support of the composer's other works. These shortcomings were corrected in a revised version (libretto: Gustav Quedenfeldt, music: Karl Tutein, who included themes from the Kaiser-Walzer) which premiered on 8 May 1941 in Danzig (Gdańsk).
Adaptations.
Johann Strauss used material from his operetta for the following works:
Erich Wolfgang Korngold wrote an arrangement of the work, first performed on 13 April 1927 in Vienna.

William Grubb Farm

The William Grubb Farm, also known as Conway and Brook Manor, is located near Charles Town, West Virginia. Built "circa" 1763 by William Grubb Jr., the house is a "stone-ender," with stone masonry at the gable ends of the house and log construction on the long sides, now covered with clapboards. The complex includes the house, a well couse (1920), a corn crib ("circa" 1850), a barn ("circa" 1850) and a Quaker burial ground ("circa" 1759 and onwards).
History.
In October 1734, Emanuel Grubb and John Grubb Jr, the two oldest sons of John Grubb of Brandywine Hundred, Delaware, had surveyed along the Bullskin Creek near Charles Town. While it is unlikely that either Emanuel or John Jr ever traveled to the area, the next year, Emanuel's son John and John Grubb Jr's son, William posted a 100 pound bond to secure the title, listed as Tract 76, Map 3. William returned to Delaware, and Emanuel's sons John, James, Frances, Benjamin and Emanuel Jr. settled in the area where they shipped hides back to the family's tannery in Delaware. In 1742, the family purchased two additional tracts, yielding and nine years later purchased a further . 
At the time, this was a tough frontier region and Benjamin Grubb became one of its colorful figures. He and his associate, David Morgan were once hauled before the magistrate after they took on all comers in a bar room brawl. However, by 1864 Benjamin was the last member of Emanuel Grubb's family in the area when he sold the remainder of Emanual's interest and relocated to North Carolina. 
When John Grubb Jr died in 1758, his interest in the Bullskin Creek property was inherited by his son Adam, a Pennsylvania shipwright who had no use for the tract. He leased the property to his older brother William Grubb (1713–1775), a Delaware farmer who had traveled to the Bullskin area in the mid-1730s to represent his father when the land was first acquired. William was a leader in the Chichester, Pennsylvania Quaker Meeting and the church was interested in establishing a settlement in the Charles Town area. On September 1, 1762, Willam and his brother, Samuel (another Delaware Quaker farmer) received an additional from Lord Fairfax. 
With the war now over, it became reasonably safe to settle in the region, and William's son, William Grubb Jr (1740 – "circa" 1810) relocated to the area from Delaware with his new bride, Susanna (probably Kerlin). William and Susannah ultimately inherited all of the family's Bullskin lands where they raised eight children. During the Revolution, William supplied over 100 barrels of whisky per month to his neighbor, George Washington. By 1800 a mill had been built, which operated until 1935. The Bullskin Run Quaker Meeting House was also on the property, but does not survive. When William Jr died, the property was inherited by William Grubb 3rd ("circa" 1779 – "circa" 1858) who moved to Ohio in 1814 and sold the property to his sister Rebecca and her husband, John Haines. The house was expanded in 1880 by Warren Eby.

Mandalay Bay Tram

The Mandalay Bay Tram is a long people mover that opened on April 9, 1999 on the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada. It was constructed to connect three gaming hotels belonging to the MGM Mirage Group. The line carries passengers from the major Tropicana - Las Vegas Boulevard intersection, via the Excalibur Hotel and Casino and Luxor Hotel to the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino at the southern end.
The dual-track system is cable driven and free for the public to use. If only one track and train are in use, it stops at all four stations. During peak periods, both tracks are in use. The express train running non-stop southwards from Excalibur North to Mandalay Bay (returning empty); the second train travels northwards depositing its passengers at Excalibur Hotel (and also returning empty).
The asymmetric arrangement—requiring a walk from Excalibur Hotel to Excalibur North—is designed to encourage extra patronage to each of the served hotels.
Background.
The Mandalay Bay Tram is a Cable Liner Shuttle installation consisting of an elevated 2,749 ft (838m) long guideway with two completely independent shuttle systems running side-by-side.
The guideway alignment passes above street level at a height of between 16 and 26 ft (5–8m). One system serves all four stations along the route, while the other provides an express link between the two end stations.
Each system consists of one train with five cars. The individual cars carry 32 passengers each, thus each train has a total capacity of 160 passengers. System 1 carries 1,300 passengers per hour per direction (pphpd) and has four stations; system 2 carries 1,900 pphpd, and has two stations (and four passengers per square meter). The trains run back empty in the opposite direction between each passenger-carrying run. In the first year of operation, the system carried approximately 21 million passengers. The train cars are firmly attached to a haul rope and run on pneumatic tires to ensure extremely quiet operation. The train can reach a travel speed of 36 km/h (22.4 mph) and the guideway is an open, modular steel tube truss structure. The custom train design is one of the highlights; the trains have been filmed for television commercials, and the Mandalay Bay Group patented the design.
Project.
The Mandalay Bay Tram project was started on September 2, 1998, when the contract with DCC Doppelmayr Cable Car was signed. The Cable Liner Shuttle was completed in April 1999, after only nine months from the notice to proceed and had a contract amount of US$16 million.
Facts.
There are two independent 2,749-foot (838 m) long shuttle systems side-by-side, built on an elevated modular steel truss guideway. The five-car trains are propelled by stationary drive machinery, controlling train acceleration, speed, propulsion and braking. They have a capacity of 32 passengers per vehicle (160 passengers/train) and travel at a speed of 36 kilometres per hour (22 mph). The headway is 220 seconds and the dwell time is 50 seconds.
Each of the two tracks has its own independent diameter wire rope, containing a single splice to make it into a loop. The wire was manufactured by Austria Draht Wire Rope then spliced and tested "in situ" by Richard Ryer Incorporated.
The tram runs during the hours of 11:00 am and 10:30 pm.

Nanchang University

Nanchang University (NCU; ) is a national university located in Nanchang, Jiangxi, China which was established in 1940 as National Chung-cheng University (). Nanchang University is listed among the National Key Universities of China.
History.
The history of Nanchang University could date back to Jiangxi Public Medical School and the National ZhongZheng University (国立中正大学; also National Chung-cheng University, given by Chiang Kai-shek, then president of the Republic of China) which were established in 1921 and 1940 respectively.
In the year of 1993, Jiangxi University and Jiangxi Industrial University merged into the new Nanchang University, from when the name was adopted until now. In 1997, Nanchang University was listed among the Top 100 key universities in China. In the year of 2004, the agreement on jointly developing Nanchang University was signed between the People's Government of Jiangxi Province and the Ministry of Education. NCU entered a new era of reform and development when it merged with Jiangxi Medical College in 2005.

NCU hosts a graduate school and 21 undergraduate schools including colleges of Liberal Arts, Foreign Language Studies, Art and Design, Law, Economics and Management, the Sciences, Life Science, Material Science and Engineering, Environmental Science and Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Architectural Engineering, Computer Engineering, Education, Medicine, and Software. These schools offer 82 undergraduate majors out of 11 academic disciplines including the liberal arts, history, philosophy, economics, management, law, science, engineering, agriculture, education, general medicine, public health， pharmacy, nursing and four clinical schools. These undergraduate programs have an enrollment of approximately 36,000 full-time students.
Although all the schools offer their own graduate programs, these programs belong to a single graduate school administratively. The NCU Graduate School offers 21 Ph.D. programs and 175 master degree programs with a graduate student body of about 6,800. In addition, NCU has two post-doctoral programs.
NCU emphasizes the importance of research. In addition to research labs and centers owned by individual schools, NCU owns and operates 26 national and provincial key laboratories and research centers and 56 basic training centers and professional labs.
NCU has a large-scale medical school. Not only does the medical school have a strong research orientation, it has 10 attached hospitals throughout the province. These hospitals accommodate the needs for teaching and internships for students of medicine.
Campus.
NCU is composed of five campuses. Its main campus is located in Nanchang city, the capital city of Jiangxi Province. The main campus occupies an area of 300 hectares and is home to all of its undergraduate students, most graduate students, most research institutes and labs, and most faculty and staff.
Faculty and staff.
NCU employs a teaching staff of 2,337, 52% of whom are professors and associate professors. Five of them are members of the distinguished Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Engineering. A number of them have received awards for their excellence in teaching and research from various government agencies ranging from the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Public Health and the Jiangxi Provincial Government.
Facilities and resources.
NCU has a comprehensive library network with a collection of 2.65 million books and 1338 periodicals including foreign language journals and magazines. The library boasts a collection of 61,400 rare books and 93,000 books in foreign languages. The library has over 1 million e-books and 34 subscribed databases and online libraries including EI, INSPEC, ISTP, SCI, AIP/APS, ELSEVIER, and PQDD, among others. With the abundance of e-books, subscribed online libraries, multimedia CDs and interactive videos and teaching materials, NCU students and teachers have a wide variety of resources to suit their needs for study and research.
To enhance the hands-on experience of students, NCU has nine large-scale multi-purpose labs for practical training. Their areas include electronics, physics, biology, computing, networking, chemistry, engineering, mechanics, and linguistics. NCU also has 47 professional research labs and 216 internship bases. To further facilitate research, NCU invested in a science and technology park which is now an incubator of 108 enterprises and research institutions on the premises. In 2004, this park was recognized as one of the “National Science and Technology Park by Universities”. NCU has found a partner in the nation's second-largest communication equipment maker ZTE. In 2005, ZTE Software Ltd was established which is a joint venture between NCU and ZTE. In 2010 NCU and Xinta Technologies Group of Singapore established a Food and Drug Technology Park dedicated to research and development.
International exchange and cooperation.
NCU places great emphasis on international exchange and cooperation. It has established regular exchange programs with more than 30 universities and institutions from over 20 countries worldwide. The Confucius Institute in France, for instance, is a cooperative venture between Nanchang University and universities in France. It was the first Confucius Institute in Europe. Nanchang University has a long working relationship with the University of Abertay Dundee of the U.K. in jointly educating master degree students. Every year, a group of Nanchang University graduates go to Abertay Dundee for their master degrees in computer science. In the summer of 2012, Nanchang University and Queen Mary, University of London will be entering into a long term relationship, beginning with a group of six students who will travel to Nanchang to teach English and learn Chinese, with a plan to make this an annual event. There are similar programs with universities from Ireland, Germany, the U.S., New Zealand, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, and other countries and regions.
In recognition of NCU's excellence in education and research, the Chinese Ministry of Education officially admitted Nanchang University into the national “211 Project” in 1997, signifying the inclusion of NCU into the elite 100 key universities in China. In 2004, the Chinese Ministry of Education signed an agreement with Jiangxi Provincial government affiliating Nanchang University with the Ministry of Education and Jiangxi Provincial government.

Guillaume Tronchet

Guillaume Tronchet (1867, Villeneuve-sur-Lot, Lot-et-Garonne - 1959, Nice) was a French architect.
Life.
Guillaume Tronchet studied at the École des Beaux-Arts de Paris in the studio of Louis-Jules André, then in 1890 in that of Victor Laloux. Gaining his diploma in 1891, in 1892 he won the Deuxième Second Grand Prix de Rome with his design entitled "Un musée d'artillerie".
For Fernand Halphen he built the château Mont-Royal at La Chapelle-en-Serval near Chantilly (Oise). After having rejected a project in the Anglo-Norman style by the architect René Sergent, then a first project in a medieval style (drawings in the collection of the Musée d'Orsay), Halphen decided on the second design, by Guillaume Tronchet : a château in the Louis XVI style celebrating hunting on the exterior and music in the interior. Built from 1907 to 1911, the building (now a hotel) was a great architectural success.
Head architect of civil buildings and national palaces, in 1929 Tronchet was entrusted with the construction (in only 8 months) of a new building for the ministry of employment on place de Fontenoy in the 7th arrondissement of Paris by the minister of employment Louis Loucheur. He used the most modern materials and techniques and famous decorative artists, such as frères Martel for the sculpture and Jacques Grüber for the glass windows.
His memory is perpetuated today by a foundation and, during the annual ceremony of the Académie des Beaux-Arts under the coupole of the Institut de France, this awards a prize to encourage a young artist (usually an architect).

Arribes (wine)

Arribes is a Spanish Denominación de Origen (DO) for wines located in the southeast of the province of Zamora and the northeast of the province of Salamanca (Castile and León, Spain), along the border with Portugal on the banks of the River Duero. There are 750 ha of vineyards registered with the "Consejo Regulador" (Governing Body). 
In 2002 the area covered by the DO along with parts of Portugal on the opposite bank was declared a National Park, Parque Nacional de Arribes del Duero.
History.
There are two theories regarding the origins of winemaking in the Arribes region. The first says that it was the ancient Romans who introduced grape-growing and wine-making. The second theory says it could have been the Phoenicians at a much earlier date, making use of their fleets along the Duero and the port of Oporto.
In 1998, the area was awarded the category of Vino de la Tierra and on 27 July 2007, it was awarded the higher category of Denominación de Origen.
The name Arribes derives from the Latin "ad ripam", which means 'on the banks' (of the river Duero).
Climate.
The area enjoys a Mediterranean climate with Atlantic influences. Rainfall is evenly spread over the year. Summers tend to be warm and dry while winters are mild.
Soils.
The soils are not deep, mostly sandy with loose granite and quartz pebbles. There are many rocky outcrops and the soil is generally poor in organic matter.
The subsoil provides good drainage, and an interesting heat regulation mechanism. The presence of slate in the subsoil acts as a heat accumulator during the day and releases it slowly during the night.
Vineyards.
The authorized planting density is a minimum of 2,000 vines/hectare; the maximum authorized yield id 10,000 kg/ha for white varieties and 7,000 kg/ha for red varieties.
The vines are mostly old vines (65 years on average) and so are mostly grown as low bushes ("en vaso"), though recently planted ones tend to be on trellises ("en espaldera"). Average yield is 3,500 kg/ha, or about 1.5 kg/vine.
Grape varieties.
The authorized red varieties are:
The authorized white varieties are:
The Governing Body of the DO is currently debating whether to authorize Bruñal and Bastardillo Chico (red), and Puesta en Cruz (white).

Château Mont-Royal

The Château Mont-Royal is a French chateau in La Chapelle-en-Serval, Oise, built for Fernand Halphen by the architect Guillaume Tronchet.
It was to offer his wife a view which enchanted her, he said, that Fernand Halphen bought the house at la Chapelle-en-Serval, near Chantilly (Oise) and decided in 1908 to erect a country house in a wooded valley there, which became known as the Château Mont-Royal. After having rejected the project with the Anglo-Norman style of the architect René Sergent, then the first project of a mediaeval style of the architect Guillaume Tronchet (drawings in the Musée d'Orsay), Halphen chose Tronchet's second plan, of a château celebrating hunting on the outside and music on the inside. Constructed from 1907 to 1911, the château (today transformed into a hotel) was a great architectural success. Under the façades, the bas-reliefs made by Georges Gardet celebrate the pleasures of the hunt. The interior includes, notably, a theatre, a replica of that of the Opéra-Comique.

Ad Beatissimi Apostolorum

Ad Beatissimi Apostolorum is an encyclical of Pope Benedict XV given at St. Peter's, Rome, on the Feast of All Saints on November 1, 1914, in the first year of his Pontificate. The first encyclical written by Pope Benedict XV coincided with the beginning of First World War, which he labelled "the Suicide of Civilized Europe".
Benedict described the combatants as the greatest and wealthiest nations of the earth; they are well provided with the most awful weapons modern military science has devised, they strive to destroy one another with refinements of horror. There is no limit to the measure of ruin and of slaughter; day by day the earth is drenched with newly shed blood, and is covered with the bodies of the wounded and of the slain.
In light of the senseless slaughter, the Pope pleads for "peace on earth to men of good will", insisting that there are other ways and means whereby violated rights can be rectified.
The origin of the evil is a neglect of the precepts and practices of Christian wisdom, particularly a lack of love and compassion. Jesus Christ came down from Heaven for the very purpose of restoring among men the Kingdom of Peace, "A new commandment I give unto you: That you love one another; "This is my commandment that you love one another"; Materialism, nationalism, racism and class warfare are the characteristics of the age instead, so Benedict XV:
A second cause of the general unrest is the absence of respect for the authority of those who exercise ruling powers. Human power is weakened, if separated from God the Creator and Ruler of the Universe, resulting in contempt of law and crime, Human authority fails where religion, which authorizes it, is set aside.
A deeper root of the evils is according to the Bible, "the desire of money, the root of all evils". Against calls for class war, strikes, revolution and new social orders, Benedict upholds what he considers the Christian alternative of the Sermon of the Mount: "Blessed are ye poor . . . Blessed are ye that weep now; . . . Blessed shall you be when men shall hate you and when they shall separate you, and shall reproach you and cast out your name as evil". He teaches, that
Church life.
Turning to Church life, Benedict praises his predecessor Pius X, who succeeded in a revival of religious life. Not to lose sight of this, he appeals to Catholics not to be divided in this time of war, but united. In the Catholic Church so Benedict, is room for divergent opinions. Everybody has a clear right to express and defend his own opinion, but this should be done with charity and moderation respecting the different views of others and of the magisterium.
Benedict opposes theological or political labelling of other views such as liberal or conservative as divisive. There is no need of adding any qualifying terms to the profession of Catholicism: it is quite enough for each one to proclaim ""Christian" is my name and Catholic my surname", only let him endeavour to be in reality what he calls himself. 24 He repeats the condemnation of "Modernism", which Pius X declared to be "the synthesis of all heresies", But adaptation to the times is necessary too. As a guide in matters subject to change, he defines the rule, which was later used by John XXIII and Paul VI during Vatican II: "Old things, but in a new way". The encyclical concluded with a renewed call for the end of the most disastrous war, for the sake of human society and for the sake of the Church.

Cudgel (horse)

Cudgel (1914–1941) was an American two-time Champion Thoroughbred racehorse.
Owned by J. K. L. Ross and trained by future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee H. Guy Bedwell, Cudgel is probably best remembered for his win in the 1919 Havre de Grace Handicap in which he defeated two future Hall of Fame inductees, Exterminator and Sir Barton.
Cudgel raced at age three in 1917. He finished eleventh in the Kentucky Derby but showed some of his developing abilities when he finished second in the Latonia Derby. Frequently ridden by Earl Sande as well as Johnny Loftus, at age four Cudgel was the dominant older horse of 1918. The next year, despite a long layoff between May and August as a result of an injury, he came back to share Champion Older Horse honors with Sun Briar.
After retiring from racing, Cudgel stood at stud Ross's Yarrow Brae Stud near Laurel, Maryland. A successful sire, among his best, daughter Fluvanna was the 1923 American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly and his son, Froth Blower, won the 1931 King's Plate, Canada's most prestigious race.
Cudgel died in October 1941 at age twenty-seven.[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30714FD385F1A7A93C6AB178BD95F458485F9]

Ficus fraseri, the White Sandpaper Fig or Shiny Sandpaper Fig, is one of several fig species commonly known as sandpaper figs. It is native to New South Wales and Queensland in Australia and New Caledonia. More ambiguous common names are "figwood" and "watery fig".
It grows as either a shrub or tree with height ranging from around 6 to 15 metres.
Its leaves are 6 to 14 cm long and 2.5 to 6.5 cm wide on petioles that are 1 to 2 cm long. The rounded figs are 1 to 1.5 cm long and start out yellow in colour, maturing to orange-red between May and February in the species native range. They are edible, but insipid.
In Australia, the species occurs from Tuggerah Lake in New South Wales, northwards to the Atherton Tableland in Queensland.
The grey-headed flying fox feeds on the figs.
Although rarely seen in cultivation, it is a fast growing, ornamental species. It can be easily propagated from seed.

Tears of the Prodigal Son

The Tears of the Prodigal Son () is a poem written by the Croatian Baroque poet Ivan Gundulić. It was originally published in Venice in 1622.
The poem is composed of three laments (cries) ("plač"): the Sin ("Sagriješenje"), the Comprehension ("Spoznanje") and the Humility ("Skrušenje"), presenting the three basic categories of Christianity — sin, repentance and redemption — through contrasts like death/life, sin/purity and Hell/Heaven.
Biblical basis.
The poem "Tears of the Prodigal Son" draws on the well-known biblical Parable of the Prodigal Son found in Luke 15:11-32, the basis of which forms a story on a father forgiving his son's spendthriftness and greed, after the son comes back home remorseful of his actions. Gundulić adapts and heavily elaborates the original storyline, but still leaves clearly recognizable traits of the biblical template.
Parable as a literary form represents an elaborated simile or a metaphor, inserted into a larger literary works — the Bible in this case. Biblical parable on the prodigal son has but merely two dozen lines, while Gundulić's poetical cultivation extends to 1332 verses, being permeated with numerous son's contemplations on the meaning of life and death, the sin, and numerous verses dedicated to his repentance.
In monologue form the son introduces the plot to the reader, and therefore beside being the main character serves also the role of a narrator, with the exception of sporadic occurrence of the omniscient narrator who announces the monologue. In the biblical parable, however, only the omniscient narrator appears.
Significantly different is the elaboration on the sin itself, being portrayed in the biblical parable as a hedonistic enjoyment in life's pleasures, excessive luxury and overindulgence. The poem adapts those sins too, but ultimately binds them into the foremost sin of lust, induced by a beautiful woman. Lust has encouraged the son to prodigality, for his fortunes fade not for his own self-centered "riotous living", but for the sake of pleasing the woman by buying her valuable presents. The character of a salacious woman is non-existent in the biblical parable, and as a counterbalance the poem omits the character of an older son which slightly changes the poem's ending and significantly the moral lesson learned.
Both the parable and the poem elaborate on the problem of sin, insight into it, and finally on repentance and forgiveness. But, while the biblical parable is directed towards the "righteous" which are advised that every sinner's conversion should be celebrated "for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found" (Luke 15:32, KJV), the poem focuses on the sinner itself, emphasizing that everyone who experiences genuine repentance will be forgiven, and his eternity secured.
Form.
Gundulić's "Tears of the Prodigal Son" is a religious poem structured in three laments. Every lament is prefaced by a convenient quote from the Gospel of Luke whence the plot itself is adopted from. Laments are titled in accordance with the three stages the prodigal son experiences: the Sin, the Comprehension and the Humility.
The very beginning of the poem is marked by a brief dedication in prose to the "Prisvijetlomu gospodinu Jeru Dživa Gundulića" ("the lustrous sire Jeru Dživa Gundulića"), formally separated from laments, in which the author looks back to the glorious tradition of Dubrovnik's poetry and briefly announces poem's subject.
The poem is written in symmetric octosyllables combined to sestinas, with the first lament having 74, the second 56 and the third 92 octosyllabic sestinas, rhyming "ababcc".
Style.
Poem as a term even in the ancient Greco-Roman literature had a more general notion of literary form, which is probably one of the reasons why it remained undetermined by today, embodying the characteristics of all three literary arts: lyrics, epics and drama. Elaborate plot, characters and the narrator are traits of epic poetry, drama is manifested by an extremely intensive internal conflict of the main character and the long monologues, and lyrics is indicated in the form itself, by the emotional vigour, ethical and theological contemplations and numerous poetical devices and figures of speech such as similes, epithets, strong metaphors and numerous contradictory figures — oxymorons, paradoxes and antitheses. The antithesis of "sin/purification" imbues the piece as a whole, so the poem itself can be understood as one big antithesis. Also, it's marked by the prevalent allegory, for the plot on the relationship between the father and the son can be transferred to the relationship of a man and God.

Therefore Repent!

Therefore Repent! is a bestselling Canadian graphic novel written by anarchist freelance writer Jim Munroe and illustrated by Salgood Sam. It is set in a post-apocalyptic Chicago neighbourhood after the predictions of Christian fundamentalists concerning the Rapture have come true, the righteous have risen to Heaven and a society divided between Splitters who believe there will be a second Rapture for those who perform good acts after the first and those who do not. The novel has been called "a progressive, humane rejoinder" to the Christian science fiction novels in the "Left Behind" series.
Storyline.
The protagonists of the novel are Mummy and Raven, lovers who used to have a touring act at Raves and Festivals where they dressed up as a mummy and a raven. The novel opens as they arrive in Chicago searching for somewhere to live following the Rapture. They meet a local kid in their new neighbourhood who shows them to an empty apartment vacated by its raptured inhabitants. Settling into the squat. Mummy and Raven are happy to live in a world without Christians, unlike Splitters (people who were left behind who strive to become as Christian as possible in order to ascend to Heaven during the Apocalypse). As the story progresses, Mummy and Raven explore the neighbourhood around their apartment, and become disconcerted as the world becomes increasingly unhinged. Militaristic angels appear and begin to kill "sinners" using machine guns, the couple's dog begins to speak, while they and other people start to develop magical powers and forms.
Reception.
The graphic novel was a critical and commercial success, attracting critical praise from "Quill & Quire" ("an absolutely boundless piece of fantasy that he wisely grounds in very human relationships...o say it’s an imaginative work would be an understatement"), Junot Diaz, and Annalee Newitz of "io9", reaching the Canadian Top 20 bestsellers list, and garnering Munroe a nomination for the 2008 Shuster Award for Outstanding Canadian Comic Book Writer.

After June 12, 2007, Mekki posted his speeches online revealing the foundation of his presidential programme. He called for the birth of a "Second Tunisian republic" where rights would be guaranteed to all Tunisians. According to him, this was the only alternative to the then exisitng regime.
Mekki claimed that women had been wearing veils as a mean of silent political protests rather than true religious conviction. Mekki proposed to fight the "real" roots of Islamic Terrorism and blamed President Ben Ali's policies for the rise of extremists. This could also just have been a ploy to gain support in the West, as Ben Ali had similarly proclaimed to be fighting terrorism.
Mekki's team produced a series of political comic sketches called "Mille et une nuits" (engl. "One Thousand and One Nights or Elf Leila w Leila") in which he ridiculed President Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, his wife Leila Trabelsi-Ben Ali, and the Trabelsi family - the name of the sketches themselves a jab at the president's wife.
From June 8, 2008, his speeches were broadcast online on various websites including Youtube and Dailymotion as well as via satellite on Nilesat every Monday evening in Tunisia. Mekki died, aged 54, in Hammamet.

Siege of Baidoa

The Siege of Baidoa (July 2008 - January 2009) was a military confrontation in which the Al-Shabaab militia laid siege to the headquarters of the Somali Transitional Federal Government (TFG).
Timeline.
On July 8, al-Shabaab launched a midnight attack on Baidoa's presidential palace, airport and parliament with rockets and mortars, killing 11 soldiers in the encircled and vulnerable de facto capital of the Transitional Government. Baidoa Airport is the lifeline for the city. In the tense situation, Baidoa police opened fire on a bus that refused to stop for them, killing many on board. TFG police are known to extort money from travelers at roadblocks, and this is likely an unrelated incident.
On July 9, Islamists seized a large shipment of Ethiopian arms and military vehicles from an armored convoy heading from Balidogle Airport to Baidoa meant for the TFG military. 3 Islamists were killed in the battle, as well as one confirmed government soldier dead. The convoy was attacked a second time in Wanla Weyne before finally reaching Baidoa.
On July 10, Islamists seized the control of Deynunay town 20 km south of Baidoa city the seat of Somalia parliament, killing one government soldier, a spokesman said.
Fierce fighting near Daynunay continued for a second day on July 11 as Islamist and TFG forces battled, 3 TFG soldiers were killed in the battle.
On July 13, al-Shabab forces reoccupied Bardhere and Burhakaba, or more appropriately al-Shabab forces mustered in these two towns en route to Baidoa, as TFG presence in these towns had long since been expelled.
The United Nations Development Program (UNDP), an organisation with many years of experience in Somalia, withdrew from Baidoa due to the imminent attack.
On August 27, a bombing attack in the city left the son of a Somali MP dead along with one of his bodyguards.
On September 5, Islamist fighters attacked an Ethiopian Army convoy that just left the city in the town of Bardale, 55 kilometers southwest of Baidoa. Two Ethiopian soldiers, two insurgents and one civilian were killed in the attack and one Ethiopian Army truck was burned. Two days later on September 7, insurgents attacked a police station in the city but there were no casualties.
On September 20, heavy fighting between Somali government troops and the insurgents killed at least two soldiers, three insurgents and one civilian in the city when a government checkpoint was attacked.
On October 2, three separate insurgent attacks in the town killed two civilians and one soldier.
On October 13, more heavy fighting resulted in the deaths of four insurgents and two Ethiopian soldiers after an Ethiopian Army convoy, heading into Baidoa, was ambushed.
On December 24, a landmine killed three policemen in the city.
On January 26, 2009, the city finally fell. Islamist forces took Baidoa, which was by this point the last major city controlled by the Transitional Government. This came after Ethiopian troops completely pulled out of the country only a day before. Pro-Government (or rather anti-Islamist) forces remained in control of a corridor of territory along the border with Ethiopia, and most of Gedo and Bakool. Member of parliament Mohamed Ibrahim Habsade and his troops, along with 10 other MP's, surrendered to Islamist forces as they entered the town. During the takeover government troops and militiamen attempted to resist, in fighting that left five civilians and four soldiers dead, but were not able to stop the insurgents advance.

Irving Equipment

Irving Equipment, a division of J.D. Irving, Limited, can trace its roots back to 1958. The division was created to support various construction industries in the Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada area including shipbuilding, oil refining (Irving Oil), and pulp and paper mill expansions.
Irving Equipment is a member of the Crane Rental Association of Canada and was one of the many companies involved with its formation and the 2008-2009 Chairman was Roger Cyr of Irving Equipment. Kyle Jardine of Irving Equipment currently sits on the 2010-2011 CRAC Board of Directors.
Business activities.
Irving Equipment provides crane rentals, heavy lift and heavy haul services in Atlantic Canada and has expanded into the United States, with operations in New England and the Ohio River Valley region with a fleet of over 140 cranes ranging from 8-Ton to 825-ton capacity. Utilizing multi-axle transport modules, Irving Equipment can transport loads up to 1000 tons.
With the expansion of the Saint John Irving Oil refinery, in the mid-70's they expanded into pile driving and in 1984 Irving Equipment separated out its civil contracting operations to form Gulf Operators. Gulf Operators is currently a civil contractor that also produces aggregate.
Awards and Recognition.
In 1994, two Professional Engineers, Fred Dickinson and Jeff Dacey, received the individual Award for Technical Excellence from the New Brunswick Society of Professional Engineers for their work on CraneCad.
In 2008, Irving Equipment received a 30 year Longevity Award from the Specialty Carriers and Rigging Association.
Irving Equipment is listed on the American Cranes and Transport ACT 50, which has now expanded to the ACT100, its annual assessment of the continent's top crane-owning companies. In 2009, Irving Equipment ranked 31st in its ACT100 list. And in 2010, increased to number 27.
In 2008, International Crane and Specialized Transport Magazine ranked them 45th on the IC50, a list of the top crane owning companies in the world. In 2009, Irving Equipment moved up to 44th in the list, and held that position for the 2010 IC50 listing.
Irving Crane.
In 1999 Irving Equipment expanded into the United States when they opened a crane rental office in Eliot, Maine under the name Irving Equipment Inc. Additional offices were later added in Hampton, New Hampshire and Burlington, Massachusetts. In 2008 a branch was added in Charleston, West Virginia.
In 2009 the company began operating in the United States as Irving Crane.
CraneCAD.
In 1987 Irving Equipment developed its own lift planning software called CraneCAD. This software was built on top of the AutoCAD platform by two Professional Engineers, Fred Dickinson and Jeff Dacey, and the project received partial funding from the National Research Council of Canada. Using CraneCAD, engineers are able to create three-dimensional models of their project site to accurately determine the type of crane and the precise lift configuration required for each lift.

Jules Payot

Jules Payot (1859-1939) was a French educationist. 
Career overview.
Payot was born in 1859 in Chamonix. Little is known about his education and academic career; however some sources presents him as a leading figure in lay education and in 1907 he was appointed rector at the Aix-Marseille University in Aix-en-Provence. Payot died in 1939.
According to a summary of minutes taken by the secretary of the faculty at the Ecole Normale, Payot presented his candidacy to the vacant chair in Pedagogy previously held by Professor Ferdinand Buisson. The chair eventually was granted to Émile Durkheim, who was noted as being mainly a sociologist, but the electing council argued that pedagogy was a subject within sociology. Payot received ten votes in the first poll, thereby losing to Malapert, who in turn lost to Durkheim.
Among his most famous books are "Éducation de la volonté" which in 1909 had been published in no less than 32 editions and subsequently translated into several languages.
Quotes.
"Une foule n’est accessible qu’à des émotions, elle est incapable d’une attitude d’esprit objective." — A crowd is accessible only to emotions, it is unable of an objective attitude of spirit.

<doc id="18381921" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18381921" title="New medievalism">
New medievalism

New medievalism is a term used by Hedley Bull in "The Anarchical Society" to describe the erosion of state sovereignty in the contemporary globalised world. This has resulted in an international system which resembles the medieval one, where political authority was exercised by a range of non-territorial and overlapping agents, such as religious bodies, principalities, empires and city-states, instead of by a single political authority in the form of a state which has complete sovereignty over its territory.
Bull argues that the contemporary international system is evolving into one with multiple and overlapping sources of power. Processes characterising this "new medievalism" include the increasing powers held by regional organisations such as the European Union, as well as the spread of sub-national and devolved governments, such as those of Scotland and Catalonia. These challenge the exclusive authority of the state. Private military companies, multinational corporations and the resurgence of worldwide religious movements (e.g. Political Islam) similarly indicate a reduction in the role of the state and a decentralisation of power and authority.
More recently, Anthony Clark Arend argues in his 1999 book, "Legal Rules and International Society", that the international system is moving toward a "neo-medieval" system. He claims that the trends that Bull noted in 1977 had become even more pronounced by the end of the twentieth century. Arend argues that the emergence of a "neo-medieval" system would have profound implications for the creation and operation of international law.

Symphony No. 7 (Mozart)

Symphony No. 7 in D major, K. 45, by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, was completed in Vienna in January 1768 after the family's return from a visit to Olomouc and Brno in Moravia. The symphony is in four movements. Its first performance was probably at a private concert. The symphony was reworked to become the overture to Mozart's opera, "La finta semplice", K. 51, composed and performed later that year, and the overture itself was subsequently adapted further to create a new symphony, known in the Köchel 1964 (K6) catalogue as K. 46a. The autograph of the score is preserved in the "Staatsbibliothek Preusischer Kulturbesitz" in Berlin.
Movements and instrumentation.
For the original (K. 45) version the instrumentation was: strings, 2 oboes, 2 horns, 2 trumpets, timpani, bassoon, continuo. For the symphonic overture (K. 46a) version the trumpets were replaced with flutes, an extra bassoon was added, and the timpani were excised.

Performance history.
According to analyst Neal Zaslaw, the first occasion on which the K. 45 version could have been heard was a concert given by Prince von Galitzin, the Russian ambassador, at his Vienna residence in late March, 1768. The K. 46b version was heard at the premiere of "La finta semplice", at Salzburg on 1 May 1769.

Funds for Endangered Parrots

The Funds for Endangered Parrots (FbP) (German: "Fonds für bedrohte Papageien") is a German non-governmental organisation (NGO) in the field of species conservation, which supports and operates projects worldwide for endangered parrot species.
History.
A working group for parrots was established in 1989 within the German Zoological Society for the Conservation of Species and Populations (Germ.: "Zoologische Gesellschaft für Arten- und Populationsschutz e. V." (ZGAP)), which itself was founded in 1982. This working group was the first organisation worldwide to highlight the parlous situation of the Spix's Macaw, which has now become extinct in the wild. The "Fonds für bedrohte Papageien" was formed from the working group in October 1991.
The Fonds does not only decide on the promoting of projects - for the most part on its own initiative. More than 475.000 euros in today’s currency was raised in the first twenty years.
Since 1996 the Fonds has organised an annual open one-day convention in the autumn for members and all other interested parties.
Species conservation and project promotion.
Almost 50% of all parrot species are endangered and almost 25% of the species are critically endangered. The main reasons for this are persistent habitat destruction, such as land clearance with fire or settlement, on one hand and on the other the continuing trade in birds, which still offers wild-caught stock. Apart from these two main reasons there is a long list of others such as hunting and persecution as pests, the infiltration of other animal species into the habitat, changes to the habitat, the loss or reduction of breeding habitat and nesting trees and the lack of suitable food sources for the birds.
The Fonds supports projects, which serve the conservation of parrots. Of great importance is close cooperation with conservation groups and the local people in the relevant region to ensure, through partnership and education, the long-term success of measures for the protection of the species concerned and their habitats.
The following are just two examples of the work of the Fonds. With the conservation project for the Santa Marta Conure in Colombia the Fonds promotes a project of the Colombian foundation Alianza para Ecosístemas Críticos. The latter strives for close co-operation with the Indigenous people of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. The endemic Santa Marta Conure is a keystone species for education on the uniqueness of the flora and fauna of the mountain chain. The conservation project means that all involved work as equal partners in observation activities within the Indian reservation and in the determination of distribution patterns, the identification of breeding areas and migratory routes as well as the analysis of population and causes of decline. By optimizing cheese production among the small farmers in the distribution area of the conure through a dairy specialist working on behalf of the Fonds and the establishment of a brand for this production the long-term security of the habitat structure of the conure is assured at the same time.
The causes for the endangered status of the Citron-crested Cockatoo on the Indonesian island of Sumba are somewhat different. The main causes are the loss of nesting availability and most of all capture for the trade, i.e. the black market. Apart from the creation of basic data on distribution, density and the importance of the various endangering factors, the surveillance and prevention of the trade is a main project task. The prosecution of poachers could be achieved for the first time. At the same time a strategy for creating awareness among the local people was developed, which includes, for example, visiting schools showing an educational film made by a Fonds supporter. As many small schools do not have electricity, seeing such a film is a great event. The local partner here is BirdLife Indonesia.
Further examples of supported projects for parrot species: 
The Fonds is represented in the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) through the ZGAP. The Loro Parque Fundación and BirdLife International are international partner organisations of the Fonds.
Conventions.
The one-day annual conventions, which have been held since 1996, bring together members and other interested parties. The day’s agenda consists of presentations on a wide range of topics relevant to parrots such as conservation in the wild and the activities of the Fonds as well as European Endangered Species Programme and breeding registers, Psittaculture, reports on the breeding and keeping of less endangered species, diet, veterinarian and biological advances, reports from the field and the latest developments in taxonomy. All the presentations are concluded by open discussion. 
The conventions, which to date have been held in Germany, are usually attended by some 150 persons, so that there is a considerable dissemination effect among German parrot-keepers. The proceeds of the conventions are used for conservation projects. They are held either alongside a parrot and bird exhibition or at the premises of a zoo or bird park. The venue in 2000 was the bird show at Achern, in 2001 the DEU-BE-LUX bird show at Bitburg, in 2002 the bird show at Bielefeld-Senne, in 2003 the bird show at Coburg, in 2004 the Walsrode Bird Park, in 2005 the Ornithea bird show in the Porz suburb of Cologne, in 2006 the NiederRheinPark Plantaria at Kevelaer and in 2007 Leipzig Zoo. The convention in 2008 will be held at the Natural History Museum in Stuttgart and 2009 dem Vogelpark Walsrode.
Composition and tasks.
The “Fonds für bedrohte Papageien” consists of parrot specialists dedicated to the protection of parrots in the wild. It functions formally as a working group, which chooses a committee for decision-making and project oversight for two-year periods The tasks of the Fonds, i.e. the committee members, are the analysis and assessment of project applications, suggestions for projects, evaluation of work carried out on the projects as well as the preparation and organisation of the conventions. The committee at present consists of Thomas Arndt, Dr. Marcellus Bürkle, Detlev Franz, Hans-Jürgen Künne, Dr. Rainer Niemann, Dr. Matthias Reinschmidt, Klaus Sasse, Marion Wiegel and René Wüst (spokesperson for the Fonds).

The Mind Trust

The Mind Trust is a non-profit organization based in Indianapolis whose mission is to “dramatically improve public education for underserved students by empowering education entrepreneurs to develop or expand transformative education initiatives.”
History.
The Mind Trust was founded in 2006 by Bart Peterson, the former Mayor of Indianapolis, and David Harris, Mayor Peterson’s former charter schools director. Bart Peterson is now chair of The Mind Trust’s Board of Directors2 and David Harris is the President and CEO. The Mind Trust is an outgrowth of the Mayor Peterson’s charter schools initiative. In 2001, the Mayor of Indianapolis became the nation’s only mayor with the authority to charter schools. In July 2006, the initiative won Harvard University’s Innovations in American Government Award.
The summer 2007 issue of Education Next, a publication of the Hoover Institution described The Mind Trust’s formation in an article by David Skinner:
“In January, David Harris left the mayor’s office to work on another side of the charter school problem: ‘stimulating supply,’ as he puts it. If Indianapolis is going to continue being a leader in school innovation, it must, Harris reasons, become the place to develop new ideas. So he has built a nonprofit—IPS superintendent White, among others, sits on the board—to fund highly paid fellowships for education entrepreneurs. It is called Mind Trust, and along with trying to find the next Michael Feinberg (a co-founder of KIPP or the next Wendy Kopp (founder of Teach For America, Harris will be trying to draw the cream of education reform organizations to establish a presence in Indianapolis.”
Programs.
To achieve its mission, The Mind Trust has three strategies: (1) the Education Entrepreneur Fellowship that serves as an incubator for transformative education ventures; (2) a Venture Fund to recruit to Indianapolis the nation’s most successful entrepreneurial education initiatives; and (3) a Charter School Incubator that awards $1,000,000 in funding as well as support and training to leadership teams who intend to start networks of charter schools in Indianapolis.
The Education Entrepreneur Fellowship offers promising education entrepreneurs the opportunity to develop and launch their break-the-mold education ventures. Fellows receive two years of support ($90,000 per year in salary, full benefits, a $20,000 stipend, etc.) The Mind Trust has selected six Fellows since its inception. Fellows and their programs include Dr. Michael Bitz and Youth Music Exchange, Dr. Celine Coggins and Teach Plus, Ms. Abigail Falik and Global Citizen Year, Earl Martin Phalen and Summer Advantage USA, Stephanie Saroki de Garcia and Seton Education Partners, and Jesse Hahnel and FosterEd. John Ketzenberger, the business columnist for the Indianapolis Star, wrote about the Fellowship in a column on May 20, 2008:
“Indianapolis is on the vanguard of the education reform movement. Really. A big reason is The Mind Trust, a local nonprofit, and its Education Entrepreneur Fellowship.”
The Mind Trust has used the Venture Fund to bring Teach For America, The New Teacher Project, College Summit Diploma Plus, and Stand for Children to Indianapolis. The Mind Trust has invested over $5 million in the organizations they have recruited through the Venture Fund.
The Charter School Incubator is the newest initiative of The Mind Trust. In 2012 the Incubator will award three to four $1,000,000 start-up grants to leadership teams who intend to launch networks of charter schools in Indianapolis. The deadline for the first application round is February 17, 2012, and awards will be made by June 2012. The editorial staff of the Indianapolis Business Journal wrote about the Incubator in a column on October 15, 2011:
“If a meaningful turnaround in public education is going to happen here, it’s going to come from the fresh ideas and innovative thinking the School Incubator grants are trying to leverage. Getting the desired results won’t be easy, but the odds improve when groups such as The Mind Trust make their bold moves.”

Alfred William Bob Coats (3 September 1924, Southall, West London, England – 9 April 2007, Middleton-on-Sea, Sussex, England) was a British economist, economic historian and historian of economic thought. He has made important contributions to the study of the history, methodology, sociology, professionalisation and internationalisation of economics, and has for many decades been a central figure in professional societies in these specialised fields.
Life and work.
Bob Coats studied economics at the University College of the South and West (now the University of Exeter. His studies were interrupted by war service (in the RAF and as an intelligence officer in Palestine) for three and a half years who has covered a broad range of topics over his long career. He obtained his BSc and MSc at the University of London in 1948 and 1950 respectively. An English speaking Union scholarship enabled him to work in the USA on a PhD on the development of American economic thought, first at Pittsburgh University, subsequently at Johns Hopkins. He initially undertook a study into the work of John Bates Clark, but soon broadened the subject, resulting in hist thesis "Methodological Controversy as an Approach to the History of American Economic Thought, 1885 - 1930" that he completed in 1953. 
He returned to England that same year to accept an appointment as Lecturer in Economic History at the University of Nottingham, where he remained until his retirement in 1992, with the exception of two years as a 'founding father' of the (then) new University of York (1962–1964). Since 1964 he held a full Professorship in Economic and Social History.
Coats has introduced the 'sociology of economics' approach in Britain, moving from the organisation of economics to the role of economists in government. In this area he has edited a number of important collections of articles, mostly written by 'insiders'. 
He was a very active member and organiser in the professional organisations in his fields of interest, especially through his editorial work and numerous contributions to the most important journals.

Forrest-Marbury House

The Forrest-Marbury House, located at 3350 M Street NW in Georgetown, Washington, D.C., and is not far from the Francis Scott Key Bridge over the Potomac River.
It was the site of a March 29, 1791, meeting between President George Washington and local land-owners to discuss the federal government's purchase offer of land needed to build a new capital city for the young United States of America. The meeting was a success and the land was soon acquired.
History.
The Forrest-Marbury house itself dates to 1788 and is one of the District of Columbia's most historic sites. It was originally home to Uriah Forrest, mayor of the Town of George at the time. 
The house's next owner was real estate investor William Marbury, who occupied it in 1800 while he purchased large tracts in the District's Anacostia section. Marbury's battle with President Thomas Jefferson over President John Adams's federal appointments resulted in the landmark 1803 U. S. Supreme Court case "Marbury v. Madison", written by Chief Justice John Marshall and decided against Marbury, that first established the right of judicial review of executive and legislative branch acts of government. 
The house remained in Marbury's family throughout most of the nineteenth century. It was later used as both a residence and a commercial property, including the Crazy Horse rock and roll nightclub in the 1980s, before being restored and remodeled in the early 1990s. In 1992 it was offered for lease as part of "Forrest Marbury Court". Since 1992, it has served as the offices of the Embassy of Ukraine.

Joan Fontcuberta

Joan Fontcuberta (born 24 February 1955 in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain) is a conceptual artist whose best-known works, such as "Fauna" and "Sputnik", examine the truthfulness of photography. In addition, he is a writer, editor, teacher, and curator.
Biography.
Fontcuberta received a degree in communications from the Autonomous University of Barcelona in 1977. He worked in advertising in his early career, and his family had also worked in advertising. From 1979 to 1986 he was a professor at the Faculty of Fine Arts of the University of Barcelona, after which he earned a living through his art.
In 1980 he co-founded the Spanish/English visual arts journal "PhotoVision", and he is still Editor in Chief. Since 1993 Fontcuberta has been a professor of audiovisual communication at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona. Among other teaching appointments, he was visiting lecturer in Visual and Environmental Studies at Harvard University in 2003. Among other awards, he was named an Officer in the Order of Arts and Letters by the French Ministry of Culture in 1994. His curatorial experience includes serving as the Artistic Director of the 1996 Rencontres d'Arles, an international photography festival. He exhibited at Les Rencontres d'Arles, France, in 2005 and 2009.
Approach to art.
Fontcuberta describes himself as "self-taught in photography" and considers himself "a conceptual artist using photography." He states that the propaganda and dictatorship of Spain under Franco in his first 20 years led him to be skeptical about authority, which is reflected in his art. His background in communications and advertising led him to contemplate the relationship between photography and truth, and Fontcuberta believes that humor is an important component of his work. His art has been described as "postmodern."
Works in museums.
Fontcuberta's works are held in the permanent collections of many museums, such as Art Institute of Chicago; Center for Creative Photography, Tucson; George Eastman House, Rochester; Los Angeles County Museum of Art; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Musée National d’Art Moderne / Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Buenos Aires; Museu d'Art Contemporani de Barcelona; Museum Folkwang, Essen; Museum Ludwig, Cologne; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; Museum of Modern Art, New York; National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa; and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.
Selected exhibitions.
Solo exhibitions of single series of Fontcuberta's works include the following (with earliest known year of exhibition in parentheses):
"Herbarium" (1984).
In this series, Fontcuberta "arranged inanimate objects such as electrical cord, plastic, a shaving brush or a rubber hose into what appear to be exotic plants", thereby creating "pseudoplants". The black and white still-life photographs of these constructions were "drily classified in Latin" and thereby resembled the photographs of Karl Blossfeldt. The photographs were exhibited in Belgium, the United States, Germany, Japan, Italy, Spain, Canada, and France.
"Fauna" (1987).
Also known as "Dr. Ameisenhaufen's Fauna" or "Secret Fauna", Fontcuberta created this series in collaboration with the writer and photographer Pere Formiguera. The premise was that Fontcuberta and Formiguera discovered the long-lost archives of German zoologist Dr. Peter Ameisenhaufen, who was born in 1895 and who disappeared mysteriously in 1955. Ameisenhaufen had catalogued a number of unusual animals; for example, "Ceropithecus icarocornu" resembles a monkey with a unicorn-like horn on its head and wings; and "Solenoglypha polipodida" resembles a snake with 12 feet.
A review of the exhibition as presented in 1988 at the Museum of Modern Art noted that the evidence presented for the existence of the animals included "photographs... both in their natural habitats and in laboratory situations; detailed field notes, both in the original German and English translations; an occasional skeletal X-ray or dissection drawing; two or three tapes of the animals' cries, and in one case, an actual stuffed specimen.” Furthermore, a video displayed interviews in which various people discussed Ameisenhaufen's life.
The exhibition was shown in England, Spain, Denmark, Germany, Japan, Canada and the United States. The fake animals displayed at the exhibitions varied according to the "legends, traditions, and superstitions" of the place hosting the exhibition. Among other clues suggesting that the exhibition was a hoax, "Formiguera" and "Ameisenhaufen" both mean "anthill," and the name of "Hans von Kubert" (Ameisenhaufen's research assistant) sounds like "Joan Fontcuberta."
Fontcuberta reported that responses to the exhibition ranged "from people who understand that it is a farce and appreciate the satire and the humor of it, to people who understand it's a farce and are angry at you for trying to fool them, to people who believe it and are angry, to people who believe it and are delighted." He said in another interview that during the 1989 exhibition in the Barcelona Museum of Natural Science, "30% of the visitors aged 20 to 30, with university training, believed that some of our animals could have existed."
"Constellations" (1993).
In this series, "the images of the cosmos are strewn with a fine stardust", but "what they actually record is dust, crushed insects and other debris that accumulated on the windshield of Mr. Fontcuberta's car." The photographs were created "by applying sheets of 8-by-10-inch film directly to the glass and shining a light through, creating photograms, which were then made into Cibachrome prints."
"Artist and the Photograph" (1995).
In this series, Fontcuberta "imagineand realize[d photographic works by the four greatest Spanish artists of the twentieth century, namely Pablo Picasso, Joan Miró, Salvador Dalí and Antoni Tàpies." He mixed fact (e.g., that Picasso and André Villers collaborated on a series of lithographs called "Diurnes") with fiction (e.g., that a researcher recently found discarded images from the series). The purpose of this series was to explore how curators and museums influence the public's perception of art.
"Sputnik" (1997).
For this project, Fontcuberta fabricated evidence that the Soyuz 2 spacecraft was crewed by cosmonaut Ivan Istochnikov. Soyuz 1, an actual Soviet space mission in 1967, had ended with the death of cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov when the spacecraft crashed on landing. In 1968, according to the fabricated story, "Istochnikov and his canine companion Kloka mysteriously vanished after leaving the Soyuz 2 capsule for a routine space walk. When the Soyuz 3 arrived for a docking maneuver, it found only a vodka bottle containing a note, floating in orbit outside the empty, meteorite-damaged ship." The real Soyuz 3 spacecraft did rendezvous with Soyuz 2, but Soyuz 2 was an uncrewed mission launched as a rendezvous target for Soyuz 3. According to Fontcuberta, Soviet officials deleted Istochnikov from official Soviet history to avoid embarrassment; however, the "Sputnik Foundation" discovered Istochnikov's "voice transcriptions, videos, original annotations, some of his personal effects, and photographs taken throughout his lifetime." The exhibition of artifacts (e.g., photographs) related to "Soyuz 2" was shown in many countries, including Spain, France, Portugal, Italy, Mexico, Japan, and the United States. Among other reactions to the exhibition, a Russian ambassador "got extremely angry because was insulting the glorious Russian past and threatened to present a diplomatic complaint."
Several lines of evidence available since the first exhibition of "Sputnik" in 1997 in Madrid suggested that the story and artifacts form an elaborate hoax:
Nevertheless, "many unsuspecting folks have been taken in by the story", including the Spanish journalist Iker Jiménez. On 11 June 2006 television show "Cuarto Milenio" (Fourth Millennium), Jiménez said (in Spanish) about Istochnikov "the question is why was deleted from history, what he had done, why he annoyed Soviet government." In response, "one of Jiménez's collaborators, Gerardo Pelaez, said the Soviet authorities made Istochnikov disappear because he was the personification of 'a noisy failure'." Fontcuberta was quoted as saying about Jiménez's mistake "It's all very funny!" The next week, Jiménez issued a correction, saying that the story was a "cosmic urban legend."
At least one Web page states "The Mexican magazine "Luna Cornea", Number 14, January/April 1998, p. 58, already displayed the photos and tragic story of the 2 mission as the unalloyed truth." However:
Japanese singer Akino Arai wrote a song "Sputnik" (published in the Album Furu Platinum) about Istochnikov and his dog Kloka. The song begins with the fragment from the Russian poem written by Evtushenko, which was also used in the Sputnik exhibition Catalogue. The poem in this song is a back translation and doesn't fit to the Russian original in the book. Also, the upcoming sci-fi feature film The Cosmonaut is heavily inspired by Fontcuberta's hoax.
"Hemograms" (1998).
Fontcuberta wrote about this series: "The idea was to invite friends and people close to me to provide a sample of their blood... a piece of transparent film... Immediately afterward, I make an enlargement on photographic paper using the blood as a negative..." The photographs have been described as "exploring identity through blood and its self-expression as abstract art." A review of some photographs from the series stated that they caused the writer to "imagine anonymous blood donors, laboratory procedures, and the possibility of AIDS, or cancer."
"Sirens" (2000).
This series consisted of the installation of fake fossils of mermaids in the Réserve Géologique de Haute-Provence in Digne-les-Bains in southern France, which were then photographed. Fontcuberta created a story about how the ""Hydropithecus"" (water-monkey) fossils were discovered by a "Father Jean Fontana" whose face resembles Fontcuberta's. Subsequently the fossils have "become a permanent feature of the park."
"Pin Zhuang" (2001).
The name of this work "is Chinese for 'dismantled', 'dismounted' or 'puzzle." It was inspired by the 2001 Hainan Island incident "in which an American spy plane that crashed in China was thoroughly picked over and returned to the United States in pieces." The exhibition, which "depictmodel planes carefully mis-constructed by the artist and photographed on 'flights' through outer space, was described as "haunting, poetic and thought-provoking."
"Karelia: Miracles & Co." (2002).
The intent of this series was to "de-dramatize the irrational force behind religious feelings, while exposing the accompanying economic commercialization and political manipulation." The premise was that Fontcuberta visited a monastery in the Karelia region between Finland and Russia "to unveil the hoax" that it trains students to perform miracles. For example, in the photograph "The Miracle of the Flesh," Fontcuberta is shown holding a slice of ham with an image of Che Guevara on it, and the caption states that Adolf Hitler or Osama Bin Laden can be seen on other ham slices depending on the food eaten by the pig. A 2003 exhibition in New York was called "an uncommonly clever tour de force."
"Orogenesis" (2002).
In this project, also known as "Landscapes without Memory," Fontcuberta "createplausible, even spectacular landscapes using Terragen, a computer program originally created for military and scientific uses that turns maps into images of three-dimensional terrain." However, instead of starting with scans of maps, Fontcuberta used "scans of historical artworks such as a Henri Rousseau painting or Gustave Le Gray photograph, as well as parts of the human body" to produce "splendid and astonishing landscapes... (lakes, mountains, rocky deserts)". One review noted that the series suggests a "crisis in contemporary landscape art... example man's emotional and psychological relationship with a rapidly vanishing natural environment." The works suggest that even "scientific" images are influenced by human culture. Along with Googlegrams, the Orogenesis series was said to "call into question the boundaries of representation in the information age."
"Googlegrams" (2005).
Fontcuberta wrote about this series "The basic idea consists in selecting images that have become icons of our time. ... images are refashioned using a freeware photo mosaic programme. ... the programme was connected to the Internet and used the search engine Google to locate thousands of images on the basis of search criteria determined by the user, normally images associated with one or several words. In the Abu Ghraib photograph, for example, the search engine was given the names of top officials, civilian contractors and enlisted soldiers cited in the ‘Final Report of the Independent Panel to Review DoD Detention Operations’..." His intent was to "make an ironic criticism" of beliefs that people on the Internet "sharan exhaustive, universal, and democratic conscience." Reviews of works in the series were mixed. In 2007, the Simon Wiesenthal Center objected to a Googlegram showing the wall in the Palestinian West Bank that was a mosaic of photographs of Nazi concentration camps, stating that it was "a smug exercise in banalizing the horrors of the Holocaust." The exhibition traveled widely, including shows in Paris, Naples, and Beijing.
"Deconstructing Osama" (2007).
Exhibited at the Pilar and Joan Miró Foundation in Mallorca in 2007, this project concerned the purported "leader of Al Qaeda's military wing Dr. Fasqiyta Ul-Junat" who "was in reality an actor and singer named Manbaa Mokfhi who had appeared in soap operas on Arab television networks and was the public face of a MeccaCola advertising campaign." He was not actually a terrorist but instead had been "hired to play the role." After Mokfhi disappeared mysteriously, "intelligence services then invented the figure of Osama bin Laden and his associates in which to create the face of terror."
Fontcuberta himself appears as Ul-Junat / Mokfhi. Furthermore, the name "Fontcuberta, Joan" is similar to the name "Fasqiyta Ul-Junat." The "in-jokes" in the project include the similarity of the names of the photographers Ben Kalish Ezab and Ben Salaad to characters in "The Adventures of Tintin", a picture of photographer Martin Parr in a keffiyeh, and the allusion of the “Office of Strategic Impact” in the project to the real Office of Special Plans of the Pentagon.
"Camouflages" (2014).
In this exhibition at the Maison Européenne de la Photographie, Fontcuberta calls into question traditional methods for determining fact and authority. A large portion of the exhibit is dedicated to the meticulous photojournalism of a fictionalized Fontcuberta who meets with likewise fictional naturalists and records their discoveries. Fantastical animals and plants, many of them created by grafting real organisms together, are presented sketched, taximerdized, and intricately described. The largest portion of the exhibit documents the discovery of Hydropithecus, an ancient siren whose name references Australopithecus.

Passengers per hour per direction

Passengers per hour per direction or passengers per hour in peak direction (PPHPD or p/h/d) is a measure of the capacity of a rapid transit or public transport system.
Directional flow.
Many public transport system handle a highly directional flow of passengers—often traveling to work to a city in the morning rush hour and away from a city in the late afternoon. To increase the passenger throughput, many systems can be reconfigured to change the direction of the optimised flow. A common example is a railway or metro station with more than two parallel escalators, where the majority of the escalators can be set to move in one direction. This gives rise to the measure of the peak-flow rather than a simple average of half of the total capacity.

James K. Marshall

James Keith "Jimmy" Marshall (April 17, 1839 – July 3, 1863) was a Confederate Army officer during the American Civil War. Marshall commanded the wounded J. Johnston Pettigrew's brigade during Pickett's Charge at the Battle of Gettysburg. He was killed during the assault.
Early life.
Marshall was born in Fauquier County, Virginia, to Edward Carrington Marshall and Rebecca Courtenay Peyton Marshall. He was a grandson of Chief Justice of the United States John Marshall. He was related through blood or marriage to Thomas Jefferson, George E. Pickett, and Robert E. Lee. His great-grandfather had attended school with George Washington and was commander of the 3rd Virginia Infantry during the American Revolutionary War. He was also a first cousin of Col. Thomas A. Marshall and second cousin of General Lee's aide, Col. Charles Marshall. 
James K. Marshall graduated from the Virginia Military Institute in 1860. He was chosen as the final orator for graduation ceremonies by the Society of Cadets. He also served as first lieutenant of a cadet company. When the Civil War broke out, Marshall was serving as a teacher in Edenton, North Carolina.
Civil War.
Marshall became a captain of Company M of the 1st North Carolina "Bethel Regiment" of Col. Daniel Harvey Hill in the spring of 1861. He did not take part in the Battle of Big Bethel. He was made colonel of the 52nd North Carolina on April 23, 1862 under the command of Brig. Gen J. Johnston Pettigrew, despite having no combat experience. Marshall was initially elected to the post of lieutenant colonel and Zebulon Vance was elected colonel, however, Vance declined the position so Marshall took the spot instead. Marshall spent much of this period defending the Blackwater River. Pettigrew's Brigade joined the Army of Northern Virginia in late May 1863, for the Gettysburg Campaign.
Gettysburg.
Pettigrew's Brigade saw intense fighting during the Battle of Gettysburg. On July 1, 1863, Marshall's regiment initially encountered two companies from the 80th New York Infantry at the Harmon farm. After dispersing these men, a portion of the 52nd North Carolina fought part of the 8th New York Cavalry at Meal's Orchard. The 52nd crossed Willoughby Run and faced resistance from more cavalry units around Fairfield Road. After crossing Fairfield Road, Marshall's men slammed into the flank of the 121st Pennsylvania of Lt. Col. Alexander Biddle, routing them from the field and sending them running toward Seminary Ridge. Marshall's men next attacked the 80th New York of Col. Theodore Gates and forced them to retreat. Soon after this attack, Maj. Gen. Henry Heth was wounded and Pettigrew was elevated to divisional command. Due to the high casualty rate in Pettigrew's Brigade command structure, Marshall was given charge of it. The brigade suffered 1,100 casualties out of 2,584 engaged, however Marshall's 52nd North Carolina suffered only 26 casualties. 
The brigade was not involved in any fighting on July 2, 1863. Marshall had the brigade's Moravian band perform for the men to heighten their morale after the first day's carnage.
Leading the decimated brigade during Pickett's Charge, Marshall's men crossed the field around the Bliss Farm and Stevens' Run and then crossed the Emmitsburg Rd, coming under withering fire at the fence line. While crossing the Emmitsburg Road, Marshall turned to Capt. Stockton Heath (son of Maj. Gen. Henry Heth) and said "We do not know which of us will be next to fall." Just minutes later, as Marshall neared the stonewall on Cemetery Ridge he was struck in the forehead and killed instantly by two bullets while cheering his men on.
Aftermath.
Marshall's family did not know what had happened to him until several months later when they received a letter from Marshall's cousin F. Lewis Marshall informing them of James K. Marshall's death at Gettysburg. The family had heard conflicting reports of Marshall's fate, and thought that he was a prisoner of war.
Marshall's remains were buried on the field at Gettysburg. It is assumed, but not known for sure, that he was re-interred at Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia.

Red Hill, Worcester

Red Hill is an area of Worcester, Worcestershire, England. It is in the south-east of the city on the A44. It has historically been used as high ground to attack the city and as a place of execution.
History.
Red Hill is mentioned regarding King Stephen's attack upon the city of Worcester in 1149. He burnt Worcester and expelled William de Beauchamp, but the castle against which he raised two forts at Red Hill near Digly and Henwicks Hill resisted his attacks. It was said that the remains of this fort could still be seen in 1820.
In the 17th century, it was an area of execution. Edward Oldcorne and Ralph Ashley who had been captured at nearby Hindlip Hall were hanged, drawn and quartered on the 7 April 1606. Holy relics of these Jesuit priests are still revered today. The others executed were a tenant farmer named Perkes, Humphrey Littleton and John Wintour. All were executed for involvement with the Gunpowder plot.
The hill featured also in the Battle of Worcester in 1651 when it was fought over by Royalist forces and Oliver Cromwell's forces. Cromwell used the heights of Red Hill and Perry Wood to hold his artillery and most of his troops on the 29 August 1651. At the time Red Hill was just outside the city gates. The Royalist attacks on the guns were turned back because there was a Worcester spy named Guise. He was caught and hanged.
Red Hill continued to be a place of execution for some time. On the 16 August 1805, for instance, it is recorded that W.Dalton was executed for two counts of burglary. It was said that "His demeanour was becoming".

Florida Department of Education

The Florida Department of Education (FLDOE) is the state education agency of Florida. It governs public education and manages funding and testing for local educational agencies (school boards). It is headquartered in the Turlington Building in Tallahassee.
The Florida Commissioner of Education manages the day-to-day operation of the department. The office of Commission of Education was originally a Cabinet-level position filled by direct election and directly responsible for education in Florida. The 1998 Florida Constitution Revision Commission submitted a revision to the Florida Constitution, amending Article IV, Section IV to reduced the Cabinet from six elected officials to three. The voters approved the changes and it became effective January 7, 2003; after this time, the Commissioner of Education became an appointed position and the FLDOE became the overall responsibility of the Governor. The revised constitution also created a new Florida Board of Education with seven members (one of whom is the Commissioner of Education), appointed by the Governor to oversee the Department of Education.
Division of Vocational Rehabilitation - 930 positions 
Division of Blind Services - 300 positions 
Annual operating budget for all entities in 2012-13 - approximately $18.6 billion 
Oversee 28 locally-governed public state colleges and 47 school district technical centers 
The department supports 2.6 million students, 3,800 public schools and 318,000 full-time staff and more than 180,000 teachers.
State exams.
The State of Florida requires students to take the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test (FCAT 2.0) each year in grades 3-10. Students' results from the FCAT are compiled to generate a grade for each public school under former Governor Jeb Bush's "A+ Plan." Under this plan, public schools receive a letter grade from A to F, depending on student performance and the degree to which the bottom 25% of the school has improved compared to its past performances. The higher a public school scores, the more funding it receives.
Students in third grade are required to pass the reading portion of the test in order to be promoted to the fourth grade.
Students in Florida must also pass the tenth grade FCAT in reading and mathematics, in order to be eligible to receive a high school diploma.
Teacher certification.
The department paid bonuses to teachers certified by the federal government. Up until 2010, the bonus was as much as $3,800 annually. This is expected to diminish with diminished income to the state.

The Opposable Mind

The Opposable Mind: How Successful Leaders Win Through Integrative Thinking is a book published in December 2007 by Roger Martin, Dean of the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management. The book introduces the new concept of integrative thinking, using academic theory and insights from prominent business leaders to substantiate the idea.
Book Summary.
Martin argues that to emulate the world’s best leaders people need to study how leaders think. He argues integrative thinking, is a common feature found in successful leaders. The book gives a working definition of integrative thinking as: “The ability to face constructively the tension of opposing ideas and, instead of choosing one at the expense of the other, generate a creative resolution of the tension in the form of a new idea that contains elements of the opposing ideas but is superior to each”.
Martin notes some of the major differences between integrative thinkers and conventional thinkers. Integrative thinkers: take a broad view of what is salient despite the increase it causes in the complexity of problems, consider multi directional and non-linear causal relationships, keep the entire problem in mind while working on individual segments, and search for creative resolutions rather than accept trade offs.
In the second half of the book Martin outlines how to develop integrative thinking capabilities. The three main components that make up the integrative thinkers personal knowledge system are stance, tools and experience; “the tripod supporting the system”. Martin devotes a chapter to each element of the tripod, explaining their significance in the integrative thinker’s development and how they combine to create an effective integrative thinker. 
Throughout the book, Martin studies the thought processes of prominent leaders and for each chapter uses several examples outlining how the leader used a particular aspect of integrative thinking to create successful strategy.
Reaction.
The book has been noted for having a thesis that understands "that fresh thought processes are required to deal with the world's contradictions and complexities" and has been praised for showing how great leaders think rather than what they do. India’s Business Today argues that the book will “almost certainly enable you to go beyond the sort of reasoning taught at most B-schools.”
The main criticism of the book has been its inability "to teach "generative reasoning" or to provide readers with specific conceptual tools and a knowledge system for integrative thinking."
Integrative thinking is taught in MBA programs at several business schools, most notably the Rotman School.

Divine Action and Modern Science (2002) is a book written by Nicholas Saunders. It looks at Near Eastern biblical and modern theological approaches to the idea of divine action, covering such questions as how divine action occurs, what its effects are, the relationship between divine and finite causation and complementarity versus mutual exclusivity. Saunders concludes that God is active in the physical world, but not as described by traditional accounts.

Dartmouth North Community Centre is a Community centre in Albro Lake a neighbourhood in the north end of the community of Dartmouth in Nova Scotia's Halifax Regional Municipality. Albro Lake is also known as District 9.
The DNCC.
The Dartmouth North Community Center was officially opened on March 22, 1996 at its present location on 134 Pinecrest Drive. The center was created through a cooperative effort between the municipal, provincial, federal governments through the Canada/Nova Scotia Infrastructure Work Program, which allotted $1.7 million to build the facility and created twenty jobs at the time of the centre's initial opening. The center has expanded since its opening and offers a variety of services, programs and resources to the community which includes a C@P site, job search services, seniors activities, and children's and youth activities. There is also a branch of Halifax Regional Library an office of the Halifax Regional Police as well as the Department of Parks and Recreation in the building.
History of the community.
First occupants of the area were industrial workers as this area was the location for several industrial factories. The industrial factories were set up in the early 19th century by John Albro and his brother Samuel (after whom the community is named). The two brothers established the area as an industrial hub with a nail factory, tannery and barking mill. The Naval Radio Station in Albro Lake is another feature of the community. It served as a naval radio communications station for the Atlantic Coast set up in 1942. The site was developed in order to cope with the North Atlantic U-boat threat in WWII. The site was renamed HMC NRS Albro Lake on July 1, 1956 and remained such until its closure in 1968. Near the end of WWII the area was a residential subdivision until 1961 when it was amalgamated into the city of Dartmouth

John Early (educator)

Father John Early (1814–1873) was an Irish-American Jesuit educator and founder of the Loyola College in Maryland. He was also the President of Georgetown University from 1858-1866 and again from 1870-1873.
Early life.
Born to farmers in Maguiresbridge, Northern Ireland in 1814, Early left his home at a young age to study at the Armagh Academy. Hoping to become a priest he applied to the seminary at St Patrick's College, Maynooth where he was unable to gain admission.
Education.
Frustrated, the nineteen-year-old then moved to the United States and enrolled as a third-year college student at Mount Saint Mary's Seminary in Emmitsburg, Maryland. After gaining some academic momentum, Early then left St. Mary's for Georgetown University where he sought enrollment in the Society of Jesus, due to the influence of his mentor Father John McElroy.
Presidency at the College of the Holy Cross.
In 1848, thirty-four-year-old Father John Early was mandated the presidency of the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts. Young and newly ordained, Early became quickly frustrated as the college exhibited two large problems since it had yet to be chartered. First off, since it had not been chartered with the state it was unable to distribute diplomas. Secondly, a non-chartered school was subject to very large taxation. With the help of Boston's Bishop John Fitzpatrick, and a current senior's father, Orestes Brownson, Early wrote up a petition to the state that included privileges of six of the school's Jesuits. He, however, was not included because of his lack of American citizenship. The state of Massachusetts quickly rejected because of Bishop Fitzpatrick's clause which Fr. Early highly criticized that insisted only Catholics be allowed to enroll. Holy Cross would not distribute diplomas for another sixteen years. In 1851 Father Early handed the reins over to Anthony Ciampi, who had the arduous task of rebuilding the college after it caught fire in July 1852.
Founding of Loyola College.
After his presidency at the College of the Holy Cross, Early continued his training as a Jesuit under Father Felix Spranis. During this time he ventured to Baltimore, visiting his sister who was at the Carmelite convent. During these trips he would preach at Saint Patrick's church in Fells Point which was led by pastor James Dolan. James Dolan had for a long time been wanting to open up a university in Baltimore for the sons of upper class Catholics. After he failed to get Father Aschwanden for the job, due to health issues, he asked Fr. Early to begin the task on August 15, which happened to be exactly the same day that Father Charles Stonestreet was handed the position of provincial.

Akihiko Hirata

Early life.
Hirata was born in Keijo, Japan, in 1927, and was born into a wealthy family and educated at the prestigious Tokyo University's School of Interior Design. Before joining Shintoho as an assistant director (under his older brother, Yoshiki Onoda), Hirata moved into still photography, and eventually joined Toho in 1953, under the studio's "New Face" program, which would lead to his casting in Godzilla (although Hirata was originally intended for the part of Ogata, eventually played by another genre regular, Akira Takarada).
Career.
Hirata's film debut came in 1953, with "The Last Embrace". Hirata would go on to play everything from snarling villains to government officials, his long face and intense features have earned the actor a cult following. Although Hirata earned lasting fame with his part in "Godzilla", the role also typecast him, and the actor would go on to star in over 20 other sci-fi fantasy films for Toho (among them "The H-Man", "Gorath", and "Prophecies of Nostradamus", as well as an important recurring role in the original "Ultraman" series. It is fitting that in both his first and final appearances in a Godzilla film, Hirata would play mysterious and disturbed scientists, as Hirata took on the role of the tragic Dr. Mafune in 1975's "Terror of Mechagodzilla".
Death.
Hirata died in 1984. The actor's association with the "kaiju" genre continued right until his death, as he helped announce the production of "The Return of Godzilla" at a Tokyo press conference, but unfortunately Hirata was too ill to appear in the film, and the part would eventually go to Yosuke Natsuki, who had appeared alongside Hirata in "Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster" in 1964. Hirata died on the 25th of July, 1984, after a long battle with lung cancer.

Friedrich Hermann Wölfert

Friedrich Hermann Wölfert (17 November 1850 in Riethnordhausen, Kreis Sangerhausen - 12 June 1897 in Tempelhof (in Berlin)) was a German publisher and aviation pioneer.
Early life.
From 1870 he studied theology and philosophy at Leipzig, and he founded his own publishing company in 1873. He published over 50 books and newspapers, some of which he wrote himself. In the same year he married Christiane Trautmann, with whom he had two daughters.
Human-powered airships.
After meeting the forester Georg Baumgarten in 1879, he became fascinated with airship flight and offered not only financial support but helped him further develop airships. Baumgarten had patented and experimented with his own airship designs, but his royal employer soon forbad him from airship work. Therefore they both continued work using Wölfert's name. Their first cooperative work, the ' (three gondola airship) flew on 31 January 1880, and crashed. In 1881 further models were built, all of them, non-rigid designs. Due to their activities the ' was founded on 8 September 1881.
Wölfert neglected his publishing business, which was sold in 1881. After Baumgarten's death in 1884 he continued the work and built a series of seven airships, including the human-powered "Deutschland" which flew in Berlin.
Gottlieb Daimler's petrol engine.
After flying another airship in Dresden in 1887, a Leipzig illustrated newspaper printed a detailed account, describing it as a muscle-powered airship and hinting at a military project. Gottlieb Daimler noticed this article and, after patenting his new petrol engine for airflight, invited Wölfert to Cannstatt.
On 10 August 1888 Wölfert's airship, driven by Daimler's so-called (Grandfather Clock) petrol engine, flew 10 kilometres from Cannstatt to Aldingen (part of Remseck am Neckar) and back. Other flights were made in Cannstatt, Ulm, Augsburg, Munich, and Vienna. He also offered the use of one for military purposes to the Berlin airship department.
1896 to 1897.
Wölfert wished to present his airship at the 1896 (a large commercial exposition). A sponsor provided 50,000 Mark to build a hangar at the expo. At least three flights were made; one on 20 May 1896 reached the then record height for an airship of .
Later flights included the delivery of Post, from which some envelopes still exist. These successes led to support from the military and at the last, and fatal, flight at Tempelhof. Guests from Greece, China and Japan were present. Wölfert again named the airship "Deutschland". It had a gas volume of 800 cubic metres and an eight horsepower Daimler motor. On 1897-06-12 it rose up about 200 m (670 ft) but caught fire and crashed, killing both him and his mechanic. "", a street not far from the accident site, was named after him on 4 August 1930.

Brigadier Ambrose

Brigadier Ambrose are an alternative pop band from Chatham, England. After releasing a series of digital only singles, the band released their debut album "Fuzzo" on CD in early 2010 through their own Brigadier Records (distributed by Nova/Universal). "Fuzzo" was entered into the Mercury Music Prize for 2010. The band have not released anything since and haven't performed live since 2008.
Formation.
Brigadier Ambrose formed in 2006 when school friends David Goggin, Matthew Boorman and Daniel Boorman began recording songs they had written at Goggin's house in Chatham. The band was completed when Goggin met Karl Butler through a university friend, and the foursome began rehearsing and writing in a studio in Maidstone, Kent. The first year was spent playing low key gigs in the Medway Towns, until a demo of the track "Police" made it onto Stuart Maconie's Freak Zone show on BBC 6 Music. More airplay followed, and the year ended with Alan McGee inviting the band to play at his Death Disco club night at Notting Hill Arts Club twice in consecutive months.
2007 and 2008.
The band then spent some time recording songs with Jim Riley at his Ranscombe Studios in Chatham. A song from these sessions, the Pavement influenced "How Popular You Are", started picking up radio and club airplay in the UK and the band decided to form their own record company, Brigadier Records, to release it as a single. The song, described by the BBC as "quirky guitar pop", was supported by Phill Jupitus and Huw Stephens and backed with a song from the same Jim Riley sessions, the chiming "Back In The Old Days". The release saw the band's first artwork collaboration with Christoff Spurr, who has gone on to design all of the band's sleeves since. The single proved to be a big breakthrough for the band, who were then invited to record a Maida Vale session for BBC Radio One. Brigadier Ambrose followed this up with a small tour of England, a highlight being the Latitude Festival (travelling to which some of the band were involved in a motorway crash with a juggernaut).
The band then chose to turn down a series of record company offers, preferring instead to continue working independently by releasing their own material via Brigadier Records. They rounded off a hectic 2007 by recording and releasing a Christmas single, the chaotic "Decembered", which was nominated for single of the week on Mark Radcliffe and Stuart Maconie's BBC Radio Two show. It was released on Brigadier Records on 10 December 2007.
2008 began with BBC Radio One including the then unreleased "Mrs Peel We're Needed" in their Introducing Tips For 2008. The song marked a change of pace for the band following their frantic opening singles and drew comparisons with the likes of Felt and Pulp. "Mrs Peel We're Needed" was written after the tagline in the cult 1960s series The Avengers and featured "The Cut Of Your Jib" as a B-side. The band eventually released the single in April 2008, accompanied by a tour with BBC Introducing and the fringe event of Radio 1's Big Weekend. Brigadier Ambrose released their 4th single, the double A side "Police/There Has Been A Murder In Nasons", on 1 September 2008, which followed on in the footsteps of the previous singles, gaining significant national airplay and positive critical acclaim.
Current activity.
A gig at Alan McGee's seminal The Queen Is Dead clubnight at London's Borderline venue in December 2008 had to be cancelled due to an injury to drummer Karl Butler. Despite receiving continual offers, the band never played live again - their final gig being at Club Fandango's 229 in London in September 2008. 
The band finally released their debut album "Fuzzo" on CD and digital download in February 2010. The album was in the longlist for 2010's Mercury Music Prize but did not make the final shortlist.

History.
Located 20 miles north of Big Timber, Melville was established in 1877 as a village named after Colonel Melville, the arctic explorer. A post office first went into operation in Melville in 1883, and the first Lutheran congregation in Montana was established there in 1885. Until a church was built in 1914, all services were held in the schoolhouse. Melville is a ranching community, originally settled by Norwegians. It became regional a meeting place for Saturday night dances, horse races, and gambling. This resulted in the town quickly gaining a reputation for being particularly rough and tumble.
At its height, Melville had a flourmill, a cheese factory, a hotel, at least four saloons, two stores and a drug store. The railroad in Big Timber made such luxuries as dried fruits and green coffee available.

Hatase Buemon

Hatase Buemon was a Japanese potter. He was the son of Hatase Jūbei. Hatase Jūbei worked for the famed Nabeshima Katsushige (1580–1657) who was the lord of the Saga Domain. 
Nabeshima opened the first porcelain kiln in the Arita area of Iwatani Kawachi, soon he moved the kiln to Minamikawara. Nabeshima decided to move the Minamikawara kiln due to the close proximity of his rival land owners in Nagasaki, Hirado and Omura. He feared his closely guarded secret of making fine porcelain was in jeopardy. He moved the clan to what is still known as Okawachiyama to get away from Hiradohan and Omurahan. Once there Katsushige Nabeshima decided to gather many special workers for his kiln. He gathered a total of 31 of the best artists to work in his kilns. Among those commissioned to work for Nabeshima were Kakiemon, Iaemon, Genemon and Hatase Jūbei. They were hired to make special porcelain pieces for the Emperor and Shogun. Hatase Jūbei late in life adopted a son from Shibata.
Biography.
Buemon Hatase was a child of the adopted son of, or the son of, Hatase Jūbei. In 1871 things in Japan were starting to change. They were stopping the han system and how land was controlled. During this time many potters stopped making porcelain. Buemon Hatase wanted to take over the Nabeshima kiln owned by the Nabeshima Clan. He bought the kiln and started gathering the same people that worked for the Nabeshima kilns. He took the top artists to work at his kiln. This act of aggression caused many problems for Hatase. 
Buemon Hatase was trained by the lineage of original Nabeshima porcelain masters. He was also a carver by trade and kiln owner. He was only in business for a short time. During his time at the Nabeshima kiln he produced some of the highest quality and unique pieces to ever come from Nabeshima. Most pieces are a tan/brown in color, high relief, carved Sansui which is modeled after Chinese water, mountain and landscape pictures the Japanese call "Sansui ga". It is unknown if Buemon Hatase is the son or grandson of Hatase Jūbei. What is known is that Seiko company was the company that eventually took over the kiln. 
It is also known that Shibata Senpei and more famous Mitsutake Hikoshichi were both trained by Buemon and worked for him after he bought the kiln. Mitsutake Hikoshichi was displayed at the Tokyo National Museum in 2007. Both Mitsutake Hikoshichi and Shibata Senpei were hired to make only the most beautiful and precious items for the Emperor. Buemon made very few pieces of his own and it is quite possible the pieces showing his name may have been made by Hikoshichi or Senpei. Most of Buemon's pieces are located in Arita, Mikawa and Takeo. Most of them have never been sold as the price of each piece is so high. The average prices are between $15,000-$25,000 on the current market which most Japanese people cannot afford. Within the collection there are ten known pieces most of which are of the tan/brown carved extremely high relief porcelain done in the sansui style. There are two known pieces of pure white Buddhist-style statues one of which is damaged. There is a dragon piece that has been lost which was last located in Takeo at an antique shop that is now closed. Further history is that Buemon trained his son Nao or Naotaro who took over his technique, then Naotaro taught his son Keishichi or Keihichi.

Miné Okubo

Miné Okubo (first name pronounced MEE-NEH; February 10, 1912 – June 27, 2001) was an American artist and writer. She is best known for her book "Citizen 13660", a collection of 189 drawings and accompanying text chronicling her experiences in Japanese American internment camps during World War II. 
Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Okubo and her brother were interned to Tanforan Assembly Center and then the Topaz War Relocation Center from 1942 to 1944. There she made over 2000 drawings and sketches of daily life in the camps, many of which were included in her book. After her release Okubo relocated to New York to continue her career as an artist, earning numerous awards and recognitions.
Early life.
Born in Riverside, California, Miné Okubo attended Poly High School, Riverside Junior College, and later received a Master of Fine Arts degree from the University of California at Berkeley, class of 1938. A recipient of the Bertha Taussig Memorial Traveling Fellowship in 1938, Okubo spent two years traveling in France and Italy where she continued her development as an artist. While in Paris, she studied under the famous early 20th century avant-garde painter Fernand Léger.
From 1939 to 1942, following her return to American from Europe, Okubo created several murals under commission by the Federal Art Project. She was also commissioned by the United States Army to create mosaic and fresco murals. She collaborated with the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera in San Francisco for the Works Progress Administration. Prior to the order for internment, while living in Berkeley, CA, Miné had been creating mosaics for Fort Ord and the Servicemen's Hospitality House in Oakland, CA. Miné obtained a special permit, an exemption to the 5-mile travel limit from home, necessary to perform her work in Oakland.
Internment.
On April 24, 1942, within five months of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and two months after Roosevelt's Executive Order 9066, Miné along with her brother, Toku Okubo, who had been a student at Berkeley, were relocated to the Japanese internment camp of Tanforan. Living in a converted horse stall furnished with army cots, they adjusted to the twice-daily roll calls, curfews and the lack of privacy.
Following six months of confinement at Tanforan, Miné and her brother were transferred to the Topaz Relocation Center, Utah. Almost never without her sketchpad, Miné recorded her images of drama, humiliation and everyday struggle. While interned, Okubo taught art to children and later entered a magazine contest with a her drawing of a camp guard.
When "Fortune" magazine learned of her talent, the firm hired her as an illustrator, an arrangement that allowed her to leave the camp after a two-year confinement and relocate to New York City. Prior to her relocation to New York, Okubo had shipped a crate of her belongings to Fortune magazine's offices.
Citizen 13660.
Following her confinement, Miné Okubo relocated to New York and published a book of her experiences, "Citizen 13660", which documented, without bitterness, the indignities, struggle and sparse humor of daily life for internees at the camps. Named for the number assigned to her family unit, the book contains over two hundred of her pen and ink sketches accompanied by brief explanatory text. Published in 1946 and in print for more than 50 years since, the book provides a unique perspective on the historical record of the internment.
Later life and death.
Okubo collaborated on the April 1944 special issue of Fortune magazine's article on Japan, a work that included a small number of her drawings — the first time any of her work had been published. She remained in New York, continuing her career as an artist, for the next half century. She worked as a freelance illustrator and later resumed painting full time.
Okubo's art is found in solo and group exhibitions at museums including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and has been shown in many cities. In 1948, designer Henry Dreyfuss had commissioned Okubo to create a large Mediterranean map mural for the main foyer of a new fleet of ships called "4 Aces" for American Export Lines. — later pictured in a "Fortune" magazine article, "Modern Art Goes to Sea".
Miné Okubo testified in New York before the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians following its establishment in 1981. "Citizen 13660" — by then widely reviewed and recognized as an important reference book on the internment — was presented to the commission by Okubo.
Her book has been used in courses taught by teachers throughout the country for topics including female artists, artists in war, and ethnic artists. Becoming nationally recognized, Okubo received numerous awards, among which included the 1984 American Book Award for "Citizen 13660". In 1991, the Women's Caucus for Art awarded her a Lifetime Achievement Award, and she is listed in "Distinguished Asian Americans: A Biographical Dictionary" edited by Hyung-chan Kim. At the time of her death in February 2001, Okubo was living in her canvas-filled apartment near Greenwich Village, Manhattan.
Following her death in 2001, Okubo's various artworks and papers were transferred to Riverside Community College District, a primary beneficiary of the estate, for preservation of the collection. The transferred items include approximately 25 banker boxes of reference materials, photographs, slides, books, writings, letters, printed material, and a host of paintings, many unmounted as either loose canvas or rolled.
Okubo became the subject of a play, "Miné: A Name For Herself", written by Riverside author Mary H. Curtin and Theresa Larkin. The play, interwoven with reminiscences about Okubo's later life as a New York artist, portrays her experiences in the camps of Tanforan and Topaz and shares her artwork and aesthetic principles with the audience.
On February 22, 2006, Riverside Community College honored the memory of its noted alumna when it announced that a street on the campus had been renamed Miné Okubo Avenue.
As of August 2009, the school was working to catalog, archive and curate its collection of Okubo's personal writings, sketches, and paintings.
Quotes.
"In the camps, first at Tanforan and then at Topaz in Utah, I had the opportunity to study the human race from the cradle to the grave, and to see what happens to people when reduced to one status and one condition. Cameras and photographs were not permitted in the camps, so I recorded everything in sketches, drawings and paintings."
"Miné Okubo - preface to the 1983 edition of Citizen 13660"
"To me, life and art are one and the same, for the key lies in one's knowledge of people and life. In art one is trying to express it in the simplest imaginative way, as in the art of past civilizations, for beauty and truth are the only two things which live timeless and ageless."

Plot synopsis.
"Zoe's Tale" is a parallel retelling of Scalzi's third Old Man's War novel, "The Last Colony", written as a first-person narrative from the viewpoint of Zoë Boutin Perry. It follows up on several plot points that were underrepresented in the original novel.
Zoë is the 17-year old adopted daughter of John Perry and Jane Sagan, two former-soldiers-turned-colonists who were the subjects of Scalzi's first book, "Old Man's War". Her biological father, Charles Boutin, created a device capable of giving a race of creatures, called the Obin, consciousness. The Obin worshiped him, but he was killed for being a traitor to mankind and wanting to overthrow the Colonial Union, and so his daughter, Zoë, became a demigod to them. As such, she is accompanied at all times by a pair of Obin bodyguards, Hickory and Dickory, who also relay all they experience and feel back to the rest of the Obin.

Medical-surgical nursing is a nursing specialty area concerned with the care of adult patients in a broad range of settings. The Academy of Medical-Surgical Nurses (AMSN) is a specialty nursing organization dedicated to nurturing medical-surgical nurses as they advance their careers. Traditionally, medical-surgical nursing was an entry-level position that most nurses viewed as a stepping stone to specialty areas. Medical-surgical nursing is the largest group of professionals in the field of nursing. Advances in medicine and nursing have resulted in medical-surgical nursing evolving into its own specialty.
Many years ago a majority of hospital nurses worked on wards, and everyone was a medical-surgical nurse. Today licensed medical-surgical nurses work in a variety of positions, inpatient clinics, emergency departments, HMO’s, administration, out patient surgical centers, home health care, humanitarian relief work, ambulatory surgical care, and skilled nursing homes. Some military medical-surgical nurses serve on battlefields.
Registered Nurses can become certified Medical-Surgical Nurses through the American Nurses Credentialing Center.

Insanity Radio 103.2FM

Insanity Radio 103.2FM is a community radio station broadcasting to north Surrey, England from Royal Holloway, University of London on 103.2FM, 1287AM and online. It targets young people in the 15-25 age bracket, broadcasting a varied schedule of locally-produced programming for up to 18 hours per day during term time.
Live programmes run from 7am to 1am on weekdays, starting at a later time of 9am on weekends. Overnight, a selection of music from the station's playlists is played. In late 2013, the station reported having over 140 volunteers producing 92 weekly shows.
The majority of programming during the day takes a CHR format, playing music from the station's weekly playlists. There are also talk-based shows which discuss current affairs. In the evenings, specialist programming covers a wide range of genres including Asian, Blues, Electronic, Hip hop, Rock and classic pop.
History.
The station began as Royal Holloway's Radio Society in 1997 after Ed Harry had sent four delegates (Richard Clarke, Ian Joliet, Simon Delany and Karen Williams) to the annual Student Radio Conference in Edinburgh.
Insanity Radio was formed a year later, taking its name loosely from the fact that Royal Holloway's founder Thomas Holloway also opened the Holloway Sanatorium, a hospital for the treatment of the mentally ill, a short distance away.
It began broadcasting under Restricted Service Licences in 1998, allowing it to broadcast for 28 days at a time, twice a year on 87.7FM. The station initially operated from a studio in Royal Holloway's historic Founder's Building with a satellite dish positioned out of ground view on to the building’s roof.
In 1999 the station was forced to move out of the Founder's Building and find a new home. Matt Deegan and Richard Clarke started making lists of rooms in the university that they felt were acceptable to base the radio station. All of these ideas were dismissed, except for a seminar room in the Queen's Annexe. After getting the budget cleared by the Students' Union it was constructed into a broadcasting studio, a meeting room and a production studio, which still operates to the present day.
In September 2000, the station was granted a Long-term Restricted Services Licence to broadcast on low-power AM (LPAM) all year round on 1287 kHz. This license is still held by the station.
Community FM.
In November 2008, Insanity Radio — led by then Station Manager Joe Friel — applied for a Community Radio Licence. The licence was granted by Ofcom in February 2010. In late 2011, Ofcom allocated the frequency 103.2 MHz to the station, allowing it to broadcast on 103.2 MHz at a maximum power of 25W ERP.
The installation and testing of the transmission equipment began in February 2012, and the station officially began broadcasting on FM on 7 March 2012, with the transmitter being switched on by then Station Manager David Lamb and then Students' Union Vice President (Communications and Campaigns) Sarah Honeycombe.
Two new Production Board positions — Head of Community (Schools) and Head of Community (Youth Groups) — were created to reflect the station's new status as a community radio station. These positions were changed to Head of Community (Outreach) and Head of Community (Activities) in 2013.
The station is licensed to broadcast as a community radio station until March 2017, at which point it may apply for an extension from Ofcom.
Management.
The station is run by an elected committee of 17 which meets weekly, known as the Production Board.
The Production Board positions are Station Manager, Assistant Station Manager, Head of Operations, Head of Programming, Head of Content & Standards, Head of Training, Head of Station Sound, Head of Audio Engineering, Head of Computing, Head of Online Content, Head of Community (Outreach), Head of Community (Activities), Head of Events, Head of Music, Head of News, Head of Marketing and Head of Publicity. The Students' Union's Vice President (Communications & Campaigns) also sits on the board. 
In addition, the station's operations are overseen by the Board of Directors which meets quarterly to ensure that the station is meeting its licensing commitments. The Board of Directors consists of members from the university, the Students' Union, two alumni (currently Matt Deegan and Joe Friel), the current Station Manager, and the current Assistant Station Manager.
As set out in the station's constitution, the positions of Station Manager and Assistant Station Manager are elected annually by students at the university in a campus-wide election, while the rest of the board are elected annually at the station's annual general meeting which is open to anybody.
Awards and recognition.
The station has won a number of awards at the Student Radio Awards:

<doc id="18382894" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18382894" title="EcoCute">
EcoCute

The EcoCute is an energy efficient electric heat pump, water heating and supply system that uses heat extracted from the air to heat water for domestic, industrial and commercial use. Instead of the more conventional ammonia or haloalkane gases, EcoCute uses supercritical carbon dioxide as a refrigerant. The technology offers a means of energy conservation and reduces the emission of greenhouse gas.
Etymology.
The name of the EcoCute comes from the Japanese phrase , which literally means "natural refrigerant heat pump water heater". "Eco" is a contraction of either ecology or economical and "Cute" is a near homonym to ; literally “supply hot water.”
History.
Modern chemical refrigeration techniques developed after the proposal of the Carnot cycle in 1824. Jacob Perkins invented an ice-making machine that used ether in 1843, and Edmond Carré built a refrigerator that used water and sulfuric acid in 1850. In Japan, Fusanosuke Kuhara, founder of Hitachi, Ltd., made an air conditioner for his own home use using compressed CO2 as a refrigerant.
In 1930 Thomas Midgley, Jr. discovered dichlorodifluoromethane, a chlorinated fluorocarbon (CFC) known as freon. CFCs rapidly replaced traditional refrigerant substances, including CO2 (which proved hard to compress for domestic use), for use in heat pumps and refrigerators. But from the 1980s CFCs began to lose favor as refrigerant when their damaging effects on the ozone layer were discovered. Two alternative types of refrigerant, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), also lost favour when they were identified as greenhouse gases (additionally, HCFCs were found to be more damaging to the ozone layer than originally thought). The Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer, the Montreal Protocol and the Kyoto Protocol call for the complete abandonment of such refrigerants by 2030.
In 1989, amid international concern about the effects of chlorofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons on the ozone layer, scientist Gustav Lorentzen and SINTEF patented a method for using CO2 as a refrigerant in heating and cooling. Further research into CO2 refrigeration was then conducted at Shecco (Sustainable Heating and Cooling with CO2) in Brussels, Belgium, leading to increasing use of CO2 refrigerant technology in Europe.
In 1993 the Japanese company Denso, in collaboration with Gustav Lorentzen, developed an automobile air conditioner using CO2 as a refrigerant. They demonstrated the invention at the June 1998 International Institute of Refrigeration/Gustav Lorentzen Conference. After the conference, CRIEPI (Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry) and TEPCO (The Tokyo Electric Power Company) approached Denso about developing a prototype air conditioner using natural refrigerant materials instead of freon. Together they produced 30 prototype EcoCute units for a year-long experimental installation at locations throughout Japan, from the cold climate of Hokkaidō to hotter Okinawa. After this successful feasibility study, Denso obtained a patent to compress CO2 refrigerant for use in a heat pump from SINTEF in September 2000.
The first commercial domestic EcoCute was marketed in Japan by Corona Corporation in May 2001, and several manufacturers sold 1.5 million units there by October, 2008.
FEPC reported 2 million EcoCute units had been delivered by end of October 2009, with the equivalent CO2 absorption of 9400 km² of forest.
Features and demand.
In Japan in 1998, water heating () accounted for 33.8% of typical domestic energy consumption, with air conditioner and kerosene heater heating accounting for another 26.9% and cooling by air conditioner another 2.3%. Most of the remaining 37% was spent on electrical home appliances, a field where 21st century innovations in energy conservation began to make considerable energy savings. This left hot water supply as the most difficult area for energy conservation, leaving a gap in the market for the EcoCute. By January 2005, 26 Japanese companies were producing more than 450 models of EcoCute machines, and sales of domestic units increased 130-150% each year between 2001 and 2005.
Denso first introduced the EcoCute outside Japan at the COP9 Milan, Italy on December 9, 2003. From 2007, Denso began concentrating on marketing the EcoCute in the EU. In Japan, the Japanese government incorporated the EcoCute into its CO2 reduction program under the Kyoto Protocol, mandating the installation of 5.2 million units in commercial and domestic properties by 2010. The cost of EcoCute is approximately 500 thousand Japanese yen as of February - March 2009.
EcoCute machine basics.
An EcoCute machine or system consists of a heat pump and hot water storage unit. The components are serially concatenated with sealing refrigerant CO2 gas in circulation.
The EcoCute derives two units of energy from ambient air temperature for every unit of electrical power it requires. Each of these produces more than three units of hot water energy, resulting in reduced CO2 emissions compared to water heating via electricity or natural gas. To produce 90℃ hot water, an EcoCute consumes 66% less energy than an electric water heater, and costs 80% less than heating water via natural gas in Japan. Also, by reducing use of fossil fuels, the EcoCute results in more than 50% reductions in CO2 emissions
The EcoCute's COP is 3.8 in industrial use, while electric power water heating is 1.0, and gas boiler is 0.88 including pilot light loss.

Thomas Hitton

Thomas Hitton is generally considered to be the first English Protestant martyr of the Reformation, although the followers of Wycliffe, the Lollards had been burnt at the stake as recently as 1519. Hitton was a priest who had joined William Tyndale and the English exiles in the Low Countries. He returned to England on a brief visit in 1529 to contact the supporters of Tyndale and to arrange for the distribution of smuggled books such as the first English Psalter translated by George Joye. He was seized near Gravesend on his way to the coast to take a ship, and found to be in possession of letters from the English exiles. He was then arrested on the grounds of heresy, interrogated and probably tortured. He was condemned by Archbishop William Warham and by Bishop John Fisher and burnt at the stake at Maidstone on 23 February 1530. When Joye's second Primer (entitled "Hortulus animae") appeared a year later, he included the feast of "Sainte Thomas mar." (referring to Hitton) in the calendar. 
Tyndale also referred briefly to Hitton's execution: 
Thomas More described Hitton as "the devil's stinking martyr" and took a personal interest in the case. He criticized George Joye for canonizing Hitton: .
Hitton believed in the supremacy of the Scriptures. He also argued that, whilst baptism was necessary and marriage was good, neither had to be done by a priest or in a church, and that baptism "would be much better if it were spoken in English".

Eyvind Lambi

Eyvind Lambi or Eyvind Lamb was a Norwegian Viking and hersir of the late ninth and early tenth centuries, known from, among other sources, "Egils saga". Eyvind was the son of the Viking Berle-Kari and brother-in-law of Kveldulf Bjalfason, who married Eyvind's sister Salbjorg Karadottir; he was thus uncle to Skalla-Grímr and Thorolf Kveldulfsson and great uncle to the famous poet Egill Skallagrímsson. Eyvind also had a brother named Olvir Hnufa, who became a famous skald at the court of King Harald I of Norway.
Viking career.
Like his brother Olvir, Eyvind joined his nephew Thorolf Kveldulfsson on a number of Viking expeditions after the latter received a longship as a gift from his father Kveldulf. They gained a great deal of profit from such voyages. At a thing in Gaular, Olvir fell in love with Solveig Atladottir, the daughter of a jarl in Fjordane named Atli the Slender. The jarl refused Olvir permission to marry the girl, but he was so smitten that he abandoned his viking life to be near her. Eyvind continued to voyage with Thorolf for some time thereafter.
Harald's retainer.
Together with Thorolf, Eyvind made his way to the court of King Harald of Vestfold, who was in the process of conquering the Norwegian kingdoms and uniting Norway under his rule. His brother Olvir had already joined the court as a skald. However, after swearing allegiance to King Harald, Eyvind returned home with his father Kari. With Olvir and Thorolf, Eyvind fought at the Battle of Hafrsfjord (c. 872/885) aboard Harald's flagship. Eyvind is thereafter not mentioned until the death of Thorolf at the hands of King Harald (c. 900), at which time he administered to those wounded in the battle. Eyvind assisted Thorolf's widow Sigrid in administering her estates. He subsequently married Sigrid on King Harald's orders. "Egil's Saga" relates that Eyvind and Harald "remained friends for the rest of their lives."
Family.
With Sigrid Eyvind had two children mentioned in Egil's Saga: Finn Eyvindsson "the Squinter" and Geirlaug Eyvindsdottir. Finn married Gunnhild, daughter of a jarl named Halfdan and maternal granddaughter of King Harald. Their children included Eyvindr skáldaspillir, court skald to Haakon the Good. Another son, Njal Finnsson, settled in Hålogaland; his daughter was Astrid Nialsdotter, who appears in the "Hervarar saga".
Another daughter, Rannveig, is mentioned in the "Landnámabók". She is said to have married Sighvat the Red, a nobleman from Halogaland who settled at in Bolstad, Iceland near Ketil Trout's landtaking. Rannveig and Sighvat had a number of children: (1) Sigmund Sighvatsson, who became the father of Mord Gig, Sigfus of Hlid, Lambi Sighvatsson, Rannveig, the wife of Hamund Gunnarsson, and Thorgerd, wife of Onund Bill; and (2) Barek Sighvatsson, the father of Thord, the father of Stein.

Gustav Fredrik Lorentzen (1915–1995) was a thermodynamic scientist from Norway. 
<br>Gustav Lorentzen was a professor at Norwegian Institute of Technology, and Norwegian University of Science and Technology. In the late 1980s, Gustav Lorentzen rediscovered how CO2 could be used as a refrigerant in heating and cooling applications. He developed the modern thermodynamic transcritical cycle in 1988-1991.
In 1988 Lorentzen designed a concept for a new, but simple and efficient way of regulating CO2 systems. This idea became the turning point in the re-invention of CO2 cooling technology. Meanwhile, the Japanese corporation Denso had familiarized itself with Lorentzen's dissertation in 1993, and was evaluating the concept as a basis for a new air-condition application in cars. A series of communications between Lorentzen and Denso followed and the result of the collaboration between Lorentzen and Denso was a fundamental step in the innovation of EcoCute which was commercialized in 2000s.

The region is also called the Gulf Savannah. It contains large reserves of zinc, lead and silver. The Gulf Country is crossed by the Savannah Way highway.
Location and description.
The Gulf Country is a block of dry savanna between the wetter areas of Arnhem Land and the Top End of the Northern territory to the west and the Cape York Peninsula of Far North Queensland to the east, while to the south and east lie upland plains of Mitchell grasses and the Einasleigh Uplands. The Northern Territory side of the area is the Gulf Fall area of sandstone slopes and gorges draining the interior uplands into the gulf. The main land uses in the Gulf Country are beef cattle and mining. 
The region covers an area of . The landscape is generally flat and low-lying tropical savannah cut through with rivers that carry the monsoon rains to the gulf and feed coastal mudflats and patches of rainforest. The Sir Edward Pellew Group of Islands and the Wellesley Islands lie off the gulf coast. 
The main settlements in the region include the city of Mount Isa and the towns of Doomadgee, Cloncurry, Camooweal, Kowanyama, Karumba, Normanton and Burketown. The port at Karumba is one of Australia's main live cattle exporting ports. The oldest building in the region is the Burketown Hotel.
Climate.
The climate is hot with a dry season and a monsoon. The dry season lasts from about April until November and is characterized by very dry southeast to east winds, generated by migratory winter high pressure systems to the south. The wet season lasts from December to March and is characterised by humid northerly monsoonal airflows. This wet season can be very erratic: at Burketown, which is typical of the region, the rainfall of various wet seasons has ranged from as little as to as much as . Overall rainfall is low (from 750 mm on the coast to 500 mm inland) but if the wet season is at all strong, low-lying areas are flooded and even the few sealed roads are cut. The Gulf is also a breeding ground for cyclones during the period between November and April.
In September and October the Morning Glory Cloud appears in the Southern Gulf. The best vantage point to see this phenomenon is in the Burketown area shortly after dawn.
History.
The first known European explorer to visit the region was the Dutch Willem Janszoon "(whose name is also written as Jansz)" in his 1606 voyage. His fellow countryman Jan Carstenszoon (or "Carstensz") visited in 1623 and named the gulf in honour of Pieter de Carpentier, at that time the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies. Abel Tasman also explored the coast in 1644. The region was later explored and charted by Matthew Flinders in 1802 and 1803. 
The first overland explorer in the area was the Prussian Ludwig Leichhardt who traversed the area in 1844 and 1845. He was followed by Augustus Gregory of the North Australian Expedition in 1856, and then Burke and Wills in 1861. John McKinlay, Frederick Walker and William Landsborough lead separate search parties into the Gulf looking for Burke and Wills in 1861 and 1862.
As pastoralists settled in the area there were significant clashes with local aboriginal populations. Historian Tony Roberts has described the nature of massacres and violent encounters in the Gulf Country in his book titled "Frontier Justice".
The 1964 Mount Isa Mines Strike was a prolonged strike between miners and management at Mount Isa Mines.
Mining.
The region is source of great mineral wealth such as copper, zinc, lead and silver. Mount Isa Mines includes a number of copper, lead, zinc and silver mines in Mount Isa where production began in 1931. Century Mine, Australia's largest zinc mine began operations near Mount Isa in 1997 and is expected to be exhausted by 2016. Other mines in the region include George Fisher mine, Cannington Mine and Hilton Mine.
Ecology.
Flora.
In the Gulf Country there are no mountains to restrict rainfall to the coastal band and the transition from the coastal mangroves through Acacia stenophylla woodlands to the arid scrubs of central Australia is gradual. There are up to nineteen important areas for bird migration in rivermouths along the gulf coast including the Gregory River-Nicholson River estuary and the Roper River in Limmen Bight. The patches of rainforest habitat occur in parts that are less vulnerable to the grassland fires. On the savanna dicanthium bluegrass grows tall after the monsoon rains as the Gulf Country is one of the largest areas of native grassland in Australia. The sandstone gorges of the Gulf Fall are home to a specific wildlife. Finally the Pellew Islands have retained original mangroves and thick woodland.
Fauna.
The area is home to a number of endangered species including an endemic rodent, the Carpentarian Rock Rat "(Zyzomys palatalis)" and endemic reptiles such as the Carpentarian lerista skink . The mudflats and saltpans on the coast are home to waterbirds such as the Magpie Goose. One endemic grassland bird the Carpentarian Grasswren is suffering as changing fire regimes (the way grasses are systematically burnt and allowed to renew) are reducing their habitat.
Threats and preservation.
Much of the area is unspoilt vegetation but overgrazing of cattle and the introduction of feed grass species is changing both grasslands and wetlands while the woodlands are vulnerable to changing fire regimes. Introduced weeds include the rubber vine. Protected areas include Staaten River National Park, Boodjamulla National Park (formerly Lawn Hill), the World Heritage fossil finds at Riversleigh, Camooweal Caves National Park and Mitchell-Alice Rivers National Park on the Queensland side. However the coastal wetlands are little protected. Lawn Hill crater, an impact crater with a ring of limestone hills, is also located in the Gulf Country. Finally Barranyi (North Island) National Park is one of the Pellew Islands.

45/85

45/85 is an ABC News television documentary. It aired on September 18, 1985. The three-hour program combined archive film and television footage with new interviews to document post-World War II history, focusing especially on the Cold War. That special was produced by Avram "Av" Westin, who also produced "Our World".
Ted Koppel and Peter Jennings were the co-anchors. The executive producer of the broadcast was Avram Westin and it was written by Koppel, Jennings and senior producer Pete Simmons. "45/85" featured interviews with then President of the United States Ronald Reagan, as well as interviews with every living former President, Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford and Richard Nixon. In a stylistic innovation, 45/85 confined itself in its other interviews to people who were eyewitnesses and participants of the events they described, rather than historians or "experts."
The success of "45/85" led ABC to create the documentary series "Our World" in 1986. "Our World", with a similar format blending archive footage and eyewitness interviews, was critically acclaimed but low-rated and ABC canceled it after a single season.

Transformative assessment

Transformative assessment is a form of assessment that uses “institution-wide assessment strategies that are based on institutional goals and implemented in an integrated way for all levels (the course, the program, and the institution) to systematically transform teaching and learning.” Transformative assessment is focused on the quality of the assessment instruments and how well the assessment measures achieving of a goal. "The classic approach is to say, if you want more of something, measure it"
There is a dialectical aspect to transformative assessment with standardized measures that implicitly claim that learning can be decontextualized and that comparisons of scores across contexts hold meaning. Transformative assessment by its title implies that there is no single absolute standard that can be assessed, and that each context requires its own definition of a successful learning performance. Further, the process of assessment will do much to shape the performance that defines the outcome. Central to transformative assessment, therefore, are the stakeholders (faculty AND students) who engage in the assessment process. Because standardized measures rarely involve faculty who teach or the hearts of the students who learn, they are not transformative.
This is unlike Student-centered learning, where the focus is on the needs of the student, and also unlike Standards-based assessment where the focus is on the institution achieving a specific level of learner proficiency. Neither of those strategies help the institution to reform at all levels.
History.
The Transformational Assessment Project (TAP) was an activity within the EDUCAUSE National Learning Infrastructure Initiative (since renamed the EDUCAUSE Learning Initiative (ELI)). The project was active from January 2002 to September 2003 and was coordinated by Vicki Suter of EDUCAUSE. Core members were Gary Brown, Darren Cambridge, Steve Ehrmann (The TLT Group), Joan Lippincott (CNI), Patricia McGee, Vicki Suter (NLII) and Robin Zuniga (The TLT Group); Colleen Carmean served as a member during her tenure as NLII 2002 Fellow. Project members made presentations on the work at Educause 2002, NLII 2003 Annual Meeting and the AAHE Assessment conference in 2003.
The project produced a rubric for evaluating the transformative potential of an assessment program or plan. While the project produced a tool for assessing the transformative potential of institutional assessment strategies, it did not produce any implementation.
Rubric Dimensions.
The assessment plan aligns with other institutional plans and promotes a collaboration of
administration, faculty, students, and community.
Data from multiple and diverse sources illuminate students’ learning, learning processes, and
learning purposes, particularly learning as those aspects of learning extend beyond course-
specific outcomes.
The assessment findings are used to systematically inform and reshape teaching and learning
practice to improve effectiveness, efficiency, and/or value, and specifically to promote an
operational “culture of evidence” (e.g., influence promotion and tenure decisions).
Results are reported internally and externally with plans for expanding the collaboration for
transformation.

José António Freire Sobral

José António Freire Sobral (Sobral de Monte Agraço, São Quintino, June 10, 1840 – Lisbon, April 19, 1905), was a rich farmer and a large exporter of coffee, cocoa and woods who made his fortune in São Tomé Island in Portuguese São Tomé and Príncipe. He was the owner of the Roças Saudade and Santa Maria in the village of Trindade and was a Vocal of the Council of the Province of Portuguese São Tomé e Príncipe and Regedor of the village of Trindade. He was made Commander of the Order of Agricultural Merit of Portugal.
He was the son of António Freire, an agricultural employee, and wife Joana Maria, both born in Sobral de Monte Agraço, São Quintino, from where he took his surname.
He married Mariana Emília de Sousa, without issue. He had however, before his marriage, eight natural children from three different mothers, and was the Godfather of his grandson José de Almada Negreiros. By Leopoldina Amélia de Azevedo, born in Benguela, he had five children. She lived in São Tomé Island, where she had four of their children. Since he refused to marry her she ran off back to Benguela, where she died of childbirth of her fifth child. She was a natural daughter of Manuel de Azevedo Pereira, born in Santarém, who lived in Benguela, where he had natural daughters by Luzia, an African woman born there. Their oldest natural child was daughter Elvira Freire Sobral (São Tomé Island, Mé-Zóchi District, Trindade, Roça Saudade, – São Tomé Island, December 29, 1896), who was recognized and raised by her father, married in São Tomé Island, Água Grande District, City of São Tomé, at the Parrish of Conceição, on April 30, 1892 António Lobo de Almada Negreiros and died at childbirth of and with her daughter. She studied in Coimbra, at the Colégio das Religiosas Ursulinas, where "she won the fame of a skilled drawer". Her half-brother Joaquim Freire Sobral was also an artist and a painter. They had, beside a daughter, two sons António (b. 1895) and José Sobral de Almada Negreiros.

Johannes Juilfs

Johannes Wilhelm Heinrich Juilfs, also known by the alias Mathias Jules, (1911 – 1995) was a German theoretical and experimental physicist. He was a member of the "Sturmabteilung" (SA) and then, in 1933, of the "Schutzstaffel" (SS). Prior to World War II, he was one of three SS staff physicists who investigated the physicist Werner Heisenberg during the Heisenberg Affair, instigated, in part, by the ideological "deutsche Physik" (German physics) movement. During the war, he worked as a theoretical physics assistant at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics. During the denazification process after World War II, he was banned from working as a civil servant in academia. For a few years, he worked as a school principal, and then he took a job as a physicist in the textile industry. With the help of Heisenberg and the Minister of Lower Saxony, he was able to become a full professor at the University of Hanover.
Education.
Juilfs conducted his university studies from 1930 to 1938. He was a student of Werner Kolhörster and Max von Laue. He received his doctorate in mathematical physics under Kolhörster, in 1938, from the "Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität" (today, the " Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin"). He completed his Habilitation there on 30 March 1945.
Career.
World War II.
Juilfs was a theoretical physics assistant from 1938 to 1945 at the "Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut für Physik" (KWIP, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics; today, the Max-Planck Institut für Physik), first for Max von Laue and from 1943 to Werner Heisenberg.
Juilfs was first a member of the "Sturmabteilung" (SA, Storm Detachments) and then, in 1933, of the " Schutz-Staffel" (SS, Defense Squadron). He was also a leader in the Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund (NSDStB, National Socialist German Student League). In the SS, he rose to the rank of "Obersturmführer".
The "deutsche Physik" movement & the Heisenberg Affair.
On 1 April 1935 Arnold Sommerfeld, Heisenberg’s teacher and doctoral advisor at the University of Munich, achieved emeritus status. However, Sommerfeld stayed on as his own temporary replacement during the selection process for his successor, which took until 1 December 1939. The process was lengthy due to academic and political differences between the Munich Faculty’s selection and that of both the Reichserziehungsministerium (REM, Reich Education Ministry.) and the supporters of "deutsche Physik", which was anti-Semitic and had a bias against theoretical physics, especially including quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity. In 1935, the Munich Faculty drew up a candidate list to replace Sommerfeld as ordinarius professor of theoretical physics and head of the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Munich. There were three names on the list: Werner Heisenberg, who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1932, Peter Debye, who would receive the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1936, and Richard Becker - all former students of Sommerfeld. The Munich Faculty was firmly behind these candidates, with Heisenberg as their first choice. However, supporters of "deutsche Physik" and elements in the REM had their own list of candidates and the battle commenced, dragging on for over four years. During this time, Heisenberg came under vicious attack by the supporters of "deutsche Physik." One such attack was published in "Das Schwarze Korps", the newspaper of the Schutzstaffel, or SS, headed by Heinrich Himmler. In the editorial, Heisenberg was called a “White Jew” who should be made to “disappear.” These verbal attacks were taken seriously, as there was physical violence against the Jews and they were incarcerated. Heisenberg fought back with an editorial and a letter to Himmler, in an attempt to get a resolution to this matter and regain his honor. At one point, Heisenberg’s mother visited Himmler’s mother to help bring a resolution to the affair. The two women knew each other as a result of Heisenberg’s maternal grandfather and Himmler’s father being rectors and members of a Bavarian hiking club. Eventually, Himmler settled the Heisenberg affair by sending two letters, one to SS-Gruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich and one to Heisenberg, both on 21 July 1938. In the letter to Heydrich, Himmler said Germany could not afford to lose or silence Heisenberg as he would be useful for teaching a generation of scientists. To Heisenberg, Himmler said the letter came on recommendation of his family and he cautioned Heisenberg to make a distinction between professional physics research results and the personal and political attitudes of the involved scientists. The letter to Heisenberg was signed under the closing “Mit freundlichem Gruss und, Heil Hitler!” (With friendly greetings, Heil Hitler!”) Overall, the Heisenberg affair was settled with a victory for academic standards and professionalism, however, with Wilhelm Müller taking over for Sommerfeld on 1 December 1939, this appointment was a political victory over academic standards. Müller was not a theoretical physicist, had not published in a physics journal, and was not a member of the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft; his appointment as a replacement for Sommerfeld was considered a travesty and detrimental to educating a new generation of theoretical physicists.
During the SS investigation of Heisenberg, there were three investigators and all had training in physics. Heisenberg had participated in the doctoral examination of one of them at the " Universität Leipzig". The most influential of the three, however, was Juilfs. During their investigation, they had all become supporters of Heisenberg as well as his position against the ideological policies of the "deutsche Physik" movement in theoretical physics and academia.
Afterwards.
It was in the summer of 1940 that Wolfgang Finkelnburg became an acting director of the "Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Dozentenbund" (NSDDB, National Socialist German University Lecturers League) at the "Technische Hochschule Darmstadt" (today, the " Technische Universität Darmstadt"). As such, he organized the "Münchner Religionsgespräche" (“Munich Synod”), which took place on November 15, 1940. The event was an offensive against the "deutsche Physik" movement. Finkelnburg invited five representatives to make arguments for theoretical physics and academic decisions based on ability, rather than politics: Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, Otto Scherzer, Georg Joos, Otto Heckmann, and Hans Kopfermann. Alfons Bühl, a supporter of "deutsche Physik", invited Harald Volkmann, Bruno Thüring, Wilhelm Müller, Rudolf Tomaschek, and Ludwig Wesch. The discussion was led by Gustav Borer, with Herbert Stuart and Johannes Malsch as observers. While the technical outcome of the event may have been thin, it was a political victory against "deutsche Physik" and signaled the decline of the influence of the movement within the German Reich. 
In November 1942, as a follow-on to the 1940 "Münchner Religionsgespräche", 30 scientists met at Seefeld in the Austrian Tyrol to establish guidelines for the teaching of physics. Among those in attendance were Werner Heisenberg, Carl Ramsauer, Wolfgang Finkelnburg, Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, Juilfs, as well as supporters of the declining "deutsche Physik" movement. Juilfs clearly expressed the side the SS had taken against the movement. The "deutsche Physik" supporters were sufficiently cowed and the program of the 1940 "Münchner Religionsgespräche" was adopted, i.e., quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity were accepted as essential parts of German physics. This was a considerable victory by the physics establishment in Germany, as the state was forced to back down on ideological purity in the teaching of physics in order to get the physics community’s support.
Post World War II.
The denazification process in Germany after World War II barred Juilfs from returning to a university career. From 1948 he was a principal at an adult education school in Helmstedt. However, with the founding of the "Bundesrepublik Deutschland" (Federal Republic of Germany) in 1949, and with the help of some influential individuals, the fortunes of Juilfs began to change. It was in 1950 that he became head of the physics department at the "Textilforschungsanstalt" (Textile Research Institute) at Kerfeld. The Minister of Culture of the German state of Lower Saxony intervened on his behalf with a grant. Shortly thereafter, Juilfs coauthored a textbook, "Physik der Gegenwart", with Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, which was published in 1952 and contributed to his rehabilitation in academia. For Juilfs supporting Heisenberg during the Heisenberg Affair, the quid pro quo from Heisenberg was a whitewash certificate; these certificates were known as "Persilschein", a word play on the detergent "Persil". The Minister of Lower Saxony intervened again and helped Juilfs obtain a temporary position as lecturer on theoretical physics at the "Technische Hochschule Hanover" (today, the " Leibniz Universität Hanover". By 1958, he was an "ordentlicher Professor" (ordinarius professor) there. After World War II, many academicians lost their jobs through the denazificaion process, but by or shortly after the formation of the new Federal Republic of Germany, most of them were again found in academic positions.

Modular Man

The Modular Man is a fictional character, a Marvel Comics supervillain. He first appeared in "Rampaging Hulk" #2 (April 1977) and was created by John Warner and Val Mayerik.
Fictional character biography.
Stephen Weems was a physicist employed by the Brand Corporation (a subsidiary of Roxxon Energy Corporation) to perform experiments using microwaves to induce molecular dissolution. There was an accident during one of the experiments, and Weems was gravely injured by a burst of microwaves, which caused his molecules to start drifting apart. He quickly designed an exoskeleton for himself that would hold him together, keeping his atoms from drifting apart entirely, although his body itself could only be maintained in an intangible form.
An organization known as The Conspiracy promised to cure Weems of his affliction if he aided them in their plans. They gave Weems the code name "Modular Man" because of his ability take his body apart and put it back together without ill effect.
Agents of The Conspiracy mailed parts of Weems' body in several packages to Delenor Hospital, where another agent of the Conspiracy, Killer Shrike, lay in a coma after a fight with Ulysses Bloodstone. Members of the Conspiracy reassembled Weems in the hospital's mail room.
Weems kidnapped Killer Shrike and brought him to his masters in the Conspiracy. Unfortunately, the Conspiracy's leadership had shortly before been all killed while attempting to acquire the Hellfire Helix. Weems managed to make Killer Shrike conscious again, but could not cure the latter's amnesia. Killer Shrike promised to help Weems if he would reveal the Shrike's past to him. The two stole scientific equipment from labs at Empire State University, and came into conflict with Spider-Man and Beast.
Weems and Killer Shrike took a helicopter to the antenna of the Empire State Building prior to a new television broadcast that would presumably provide the necessary microwaves for Weems to restore himself. The broadcast initially caused Weems great pain, but then, instead of curing him, caused him to increase in size and power. He revealed that his true intent had never been to be cured, but to transform himself into a creature made out of pure energy wielding "power beyond that which any man has ever known." He struck Killer Shrike unconscious, as he no longer needed him. Spider-Man and Beast showed up again and used the Shrike's energy gauntlets to overload Weems' exoskeleton, without the protection of which, his molecules spread out further and further until he just dissolved into thin air.
Powers and abilities.
The Modular Man possessed superhuman strength and endurance, and was able to disassemble and reassemble his body any way he wished. He could absorb microwave radiation to vastly increase his size and physical strength, but could not survive without his exoskeleton. He also carried a number of weapons, such as a gas gun.

Richard Thomas Evans

Richard Thomas Evans (1890 – 20 July 1946) was a British Liberal Party politician.
Before Parliament.
Evans was educated at the University of Wales. During the Great War he served in Europe and attained the rank of Captain. In 1918 he married Edith Rhys Williams. In 1923 he published the book Aspects of the Study of Society, in the series Library of Philosophy and Religion. He was for a time a lecturer in economics at University College, Cardiff.
Parliamentary candidate.
Evans had fought the Carmarthenshire seat of Llanelly in the general elections of 1923, 1924 and 1929 but was on all three occasions unsuccessful, albeit having campaigned with energy and ability against a complacent Labour party. At the 1929 general election, Evans had hopes of a straight fight with Labour in Llanelly when the local Conservatives voted not to put up a candidate. However their decision was overturned by Conservative Central Office who sent down Mr. J P L Thomas of Llandilo in Carmarthenshire to stand in the election.
Industrial expert.
In the run-up to the 1929 general election, Evans had been involved in drafting the Liberal Party industrial policy. Evans was certainly close to David Lloyd George who was the source of inspiration for many innovative policy initiatives in the late 1920s. In 1925 the Liberal Industrial Enquiry was set up bringing together many well-known politicians and economists including Maynard Keynes, Ramsay Muir and Herbert Samuel as well as Lloyd George himself. This led to the publication in 1928 of "Britain’s Industrial Future", also known as the Liberal Yellow Book.
MP for Carmarthen.
Evans entered Parliament at the 1931 general election as MP for Carmarthen, taking the seat from Labour. As the 1931 general election approached and the debate over the National Government raged, Evans was on the side of official Liberal group in Parliament led by Sir Herbert Samuel but he promised to support the National government of Prime Minister Ramsay Macdonald on the basis of Macdonald’s published manifesto and, despite the pledge of the Unionist candidate to do the same with the prospect of the splitting of the National vote, this was enough to gain him the seat in a three-cornered contest, although with hardly a safe majority of 1,214. Once elected Evans, although he called himself a free-trader, did initially support the government, voting for a Bill to authorise duties on abnormal imports, despite some declared misgivings. However in spite of this profession of loyalty to Macdonald, Evans soon crossed the floor to sit with the official Liberal group who were in opposition. Nevertheless, his flirtation with the National Government had soured his relationship with Lloyd George. By 1934 Evans must have been having thoughts about the approaching general election because, according to the diary of Frances Stevenson he wrote to Lloyd George’s principal private secretary, A J Sylvester, asking about a rumour he had heard that Lloyd George had told Daniel Hopkin, the former Labour MP for Carmarthen, that he would publicly support him at the next election and possibly even go down to Carmarthen to speak for him. Stevenson also records that Lloyd George thought Evans a man of limited gifts, with some oratorical skills but with only one good speech which he adapted to suit his audience. The speech apparently went down well in Wales but was coldly received in the House of Commons.
Evans’s drifting between support of and opposition to the National Government did not endear him to the Conservatives either and they decided to oppose him at the next general election in 1935. Evans’s trying to ride two horses at once on the question of his support for the National Government extended into the election campaign itself. Once the Conservative candidate had put himself in the field, Evans put out a statement, undertaking to support Stanley Baldwin’s administration. Had he done so earlier he might have attracted more National support but in the end Evans, who described himself on the ballot paper as a plain Liberal (rather than a Liberal National), lost by 1,942 votes to Labour candidate Daniel Hopkin, the man he had defeated in 1931.
Would-be biographer.
In 1933, Evans’s relationship with Lloyd George had not yet descended into ruin. He approached Lloyd George with a proposal that he should write a biography of the former prime minister in Welsh and they had dinner together at the House of Commons to discuss it. But according to Lloyd George’s principal private secretary, A J Sylvester, Lloyd George discouraged Evans from this project and certainly the book was never published. But in the course of their conversation Evans managed to extract from Lloyd George an admission of regret that he had not done more to stop the Passchendaele offensive of 1917 which resulted in tremendous loss of Allied life. Lloyd George said he failed to act to stop the battle because he did not wish to be accused if interfering as prime minister directly with the military decisions of his soldiers, particularly General Jan Smuts who was in favour of the operation.

Samantha Spiro

Samantha Spiro (born 20 June 1968) is a double Olivier Award-winning English actress. She is best known for portraying Barbara Windsor in the stage play "Cleo, Camping, Emmanuelle and Dick", the television film "Cor, Blimey!", and DI Vivien Friend in "".
Background.
Born in Whitechapel, London, England, Spiro grew up in Radlett, Hertfordshire. She is Jewish. Spiro decided to be an actress at the age of ten, after seeing a production of "Androcles and the Lion" at the Open Air Theatre, Regent's Park. She joined the National Youth Theatre, and later trained at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art.
Spiro married the actor Mark Leadbetter, whom she met at drama school, in February 2002. They have two daughters and currently live in Queen's Park, London.
Career.
Theatre.
Spiro's first acting job after graduating from drama school was with the Open Air Theatre, Regent's Park, in productions of "A Midsummer Night's Dream", "The Boys From Syracuse" and "Macbeth". Her many theatre credits include "As You Like It", "Teechers", "The Tragic Roundabout", "Jumpers", "On the Piste", "Roots", "How the Other Half Loves" and "Glyn and It", opposite Penelope Keith.
Spiro played Barbara Windsor in "Cleo, Camping, Emmanuelle and Dick" at the National Theatre, a production she credits as her first big break, which "open a lot of doors". She has also appeared in the Minerva Theatre production of "Funny Girl" and the first West End revival of Alan Ayckbourn's "Bedroom Farce".
Spiro played Rachel in Mike Leigh's production of "Two Thousand Years" at the National Theatre. This was the first Jewish role of her career. She said:
"For English/Jewish artists in this business, we’re English first and the Jewish thing comes down the line. Whereas in the United States, Jewishness is a much celebrated thing. Jewishness is a part of their very being.
"Here, I think, we repress it and, far from celebrating it, almost shy away from it. After "Two Thousand Years", I suddenly felt that there is a place for people like me. Until that point I hadn’t had a career playing Jewish people. I had got that stuff out of the way by the time I came to play Fanny Brice "Funny Girl" who is very much a Jewish character."
In 2009, Spiro played Maria in the Donmar Warehouse production of "Twelfth Night" at the Wyndham's Theatre, alongside Derek Jacobi, and Beatrice in "Much Ado About Nothing" at the Open Air Theatre. Most recently, she appeared in the acclaimed Open Air Theatre production of "Hello, Dolly!", playing Dolly Levi.
In 2013, Spiro played Lady Macbeth in "Macbeth" at Shakespeare's Globe, alongside Billy Boyd (actor) and Joseph Millson.
Discussing whether she prefers acting in the theatre to television or film, Spiro said: "I think theatre prefers me. These days you have to do both, but it never feels as if the TV casting people are beating down my door to offer me work. I just feel that in this business you are lucky if you’re doing something you enjoy."
Television, film and radio.
Spiro reprised the role of Barbara Windsor in the television adaptation of "Cleo, Camping, Emmanuelle and Dick", "Cor, Blimey!", starring opposite Geoffrey Hutchings.
Her other television credits include "The Bill", "Cold Feet", "Coupling", "After You've Gone" and "", in which she played the lead role of DI Vivien Friend. She described the role of Friend as "quite an unusual departure for me...I've done quite a bit of comedy and I've played characters who are light-hearted and characters who are tarts with hearts. In M.I.T. there is no tart or heart!" In order to research the part, Spiro spent time with a female Detective Inspector with the real-life Murder Investigation Team. From 9 August 2010, Spiro starred in the BBC comedy "Grandma's House". She plays the part of Simon Amstell's aunt Liz. In 2012 she also appeared in Playhouse Presents "Psychobitches" where she played Judy Garland and Mary Whitehouse. 
In September 2013, Spiro joined the cast of Jack Whitehall's BBC Three sitcom Bad Education as Professor Celia Green, the new deputy headmaster and adversary to Jake Whitehall's character.
n December 2013 the television channel Sky Atlantic aired a new comedy series called Little Cracker. This was the second programme in the series and was an autobiographical story written by Rebecca Front and her brother Jeremy Front about Front's life as a child. The story centres around the time Front witnessed a serious incident when her father, Charles, was nearly drowned in a lake. In the drama Spiro played the part of Front's mother, Sheila. The role of Front's father was played by the actor Richard Lumsden.
Spiro has appeared in the films "Beyond Bedlam" (1994), as WPC Foster, and "Tomorrow La Scala!" (2002), as Janey. She also played Martha Tabram in "From Hell" (2001), opposite Johnny Depp. She also appears impersonating many historical female figures in "Psychobitches". 
Her radio drama credits include "The Casebook of Inspector Steine", "Gospel According to Mary", "Little Cinderellas", "Beside the Seaside" and the Guy Meredith play "Spring Forward, Fall Back" for BBC Radio 7.
Awards.
In 2001, Spiro was awarded the Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical for her performance in the 2000 season Donmar Warehouse production of "Merrily We Roll Along". She won a Whatsonstage.com award for Best Actress in a Musical for the same production. In 2010, Spiro was once again awarded the Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical for her performance in "Hello, Dolly!" at the Open Air Theatre, Regent's Park.
Spiro won a 2004 Joseph Jefferson Award for Actress in a Supporting Role in a Musical, for the production of "A Little Night Music" at the Chicago Shakespeare Theater in Chicago, Illinois.

Polynomial expression

In mathematics, and in particular in the field of algebra, a polynomial expression in one or more given entities "E"1, "E"2, ..., is any meaningful expression constructed from copies of those entities together with constants, using the operations of addition and multiplication. For each entity "E", multiple copies can be used, and it is customary to write the product "E"×"E"×...×"E" of some number "n" of identical copies of "E" as "E""n"; thus the operation of raising to a constant natural number power may also be used (as abbreviation) in a polynomial expression. Similarly, subtraction "X" – "Y" may be used to abbreviate "X" + (–1)×"Y".
The entities used may be of various natures. They are usually not explicitly given values, since then the polynomial expression can just be evaluated to another such value. Often they are symbols such as ""x"", "λ" or ""X"", which according to the context may stand for an unknown quantity, a mathematical variable, a parameter, or an indeterminate, and in such cases the polynomial expression is just a polynomial. It is however also possible to form polynomial expressions in more complicated entities than just symbols. Here are examples of such uses of polynomial expressions.

List of Roman bridges

The Romans were the world's first major bridge builders. The following list constitutes an attempt to list all known Roman bridges, many of which still survive to this day.
A Roman bridge in the sense of this article includes any of these features:
Also listed are bridges which feature substantially Roman material (Spolia), as long as the later bridge is erected on the site of a Roman precursor. Finally, incidences where only inscriptions lay testimony to a former Roman bridge are also included.
In the following, bridges are classified either according to their material or their function. Most data not otherwise marked comes from O’Connor's "Roman Bridges" which lists 330 stone bridges for traffic, 34 timber bridges and 54 aqueduct bridges. An even larger compilation of more than 900 Roman bridges (as of 2011) is offered by the Italian scholar Galliazzo, which is used here only selectively.
Note on classification.
Bridges are particularly difficult to classify as they, more than other structures, are subject to wear, on account of war and the impact of natural elements. The constant need for repairs through the ages has often turned bridges into hybrid structures, making it often difficult or nearly impossible to determine the exact date and origin of individual parts of a bridge. Thus, the majority of bridges listed below can be assumed to include medieval or (early) modern modifications, replacements or extensions, to a small or large extent.
Masonry bridges.
The following table enlists bridges made out of stone or brick. The vast majority features arches, although stone deck slabs were also known. Bridges' spans and height abbreviations: S = small, M = middle, L = large.
Timber and stone pillar bridges.
A timber bridge is a structure composed wholly out of wood, while a stone pillar bridge features a wooden superstructure resting on stone pillars. Strictly speaking, many bridges of the second type should be rather called "concrete pillar bridges", as the Romans preferably used opus caementicium for constructing their bridge piers (stone was confined in these cases to covering). Both types, timber bridges and stone respectively concrete pillar bridges, are listed here in the same category as historically, with the consolidation of Roman power in the newly conquered provinces, wooden bridges often gave way to solid pillar bridges.
Pontoon bridges.
As an alternative to ferry services, the Roman army often made use of pontoon bridges, along with timber structures, for river crossings. They usually consisted of boats lashed together, with the bows pointing towards the current. Permanent bridges of boats were also commonly set up for civilian traffic.

David Moor

Dr. David Moor (born 1947) was a British general practitioner who was prosecuted in 1999 for the euthanasia of a patient. He was found not guilty but admitted in a press interview to having helped up to 300 people to die. He was the first doctor in Britain to be tried solely for the mercy killing of a patient.
Career.
Moor worked as a GP in Stamfordham, Northumberland, but retired just before his trial in 1999.
George Liddell.
George Liddell was an 85-year-old ex-ambulance driver and a widower, who was suffering from cancer of the bowel. An operation was done to remove part of his bowel, but there was still some cancerous tissue left in surrounding fatty tissue and the liver. Liddell was sent home by the hospital to live with his daughter, and be treated by Moor and a team of nurses. The patient's condition deteriorated and he became depressed and appeared to be in significant pain. Moor prescribed 5 mg of diamorphine to be taken at intervals, but this had to be doubled when the pain got worse. It was agreed by his carers he was "terminally ill".
It was agreed to send Liddell to a hospice. Moor set the diamorphine level at a rate of 30 mg per 24-hours by means of a syringe driver. Liddell's breathing got worse and on 19 July 1997 Moor gave him an injection of diamorphine and chlorpromazine. Within about 20 minutes Liddell was dead.
The case would have gone unnoticed, but when "The Sunday Times" published an article by Michael Irwin on euthanasia, a journalist Rachel Ellis asked Moor his opinion on the subject. Moor said that he had given many patients overdoses of diamorphine, a comment he repeated in an interview on television. In particular, his statement that "This week I helped two patients on the way to a pain-free release from their painful agony and suffering" and that he had perhaps helped 10 patients per year for 30 years attracted considerable media attention. One newspaper called Moor "Britain’s greatest serial killer" and referred to him as "Doctor Death".
Trial.
The trial, presided over by Mr Justice Hooper, took place at Newcastle Crown Court on 4 April 1999 and concluded on 11 May 1999. It was prosecuted by James Goss QC and Moor was defended by Anthony Arlidge QC. One key turning point in the case was the exclusion of toxicological evidence regarding the amount of diamorphine given, calling into question whether the final injection had in fact caused death.
The jury took 65 minutes to find Moor not guilty. Mr Justice Hooper awarded the defence team only two-thirds of their costs, because Moor had brought the prosecution on himself by "very silly remarks to the press" and by lying to the NHS and the police.
Reaction.
Dr Michael Wilks, chairman of the British Medical Association's ethics committee, said after the trial that guidelines for doctors were insufficiently clear: "We are no further along the road towards any change in the law on euthanasia [...] This case just tells us that doctors who take the law into their own hands, who intend to kill their patients, as it was originally thought that Dr Moor had, are likely to be prosecuted."
Broadcaster Ludovic Kennedy said: "Dr Moor should never have been tried - the whole trial was a complete waste of time and money [...] He was only doing what hundreds and hundreds of doctors do in this country every year. The sooner the law is changed to allow doctors to legally help people on their way, the better."

Utah State Route 73

State Route 73 (SR-73) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Utah, connecting the Rush and Utah Valleys.
Route description.
SR-73 begins at an intersection with SR-36 in the Rush Valley, northeast of the town of the same name. It heads southeasterly, climbing slightly to the edge of the Oquirrh Mountains, and then curving between the south end of the range and the Deseret Chemical Depot. When the highway reaches Fivemile Pass, a wind gap between the Oquirrh Mountains and Thorpe Hills, it curves northeast, joining the historic Central Overland Trail (Pony Express route) through the pass and descending into the Cedar Valley. At Fairfield, SR-73 curves north, while the old trail continues its northeasterly path as Lehi-Fairfield Road. The route again curves northeast at Cedar Fort, crossing the valley and passing between the Lake Mountains and Traverse Mountains. The final segment is within the Utah Valley, as SR-73 heads east across the Jordan River and into Lehi, where it serves as that city's Main Street before ending at US-89.
History.
The state legislature defined State Route 73 in 1933, running from SR-68 (created in 1931) west of Lehi southwest via Cedar Fort, Fairfield and Topliff to SR-36. Up until Fivemile Pass, beyond Fairfield, this followed the present route of SR-73, but at Fivemile Pass the route curved southwesterly, generally following the former Fairfield Branch of the Union Pacific Railroad. Two years later, the portion west of Fairfield was dropped, in favor of a routing south from Fairfield to SR-26 (now US-6) near Eureka. State Route 180 was also created in 1935, beginning at SR-36 south of Stockton and heading east through Ophir Canyon to Ophir and southeast through the Oquirrh Mountains to Mercur. State Route 202 was defined in 1939 as an eastern approach to Mercur, splitting off SR-73 north of Fairfield and climbing Manning Canyon, and in 1941 the portion of SR-180 between Ophir and Mercur was removed from the state highway system, with an extension of SR-202 west down Mercur Canyon to SR-180 replacing it.
SR-73 was realigned again in 1945, turning southwest between Cedar Fort and Fairfield, absorbing the beginning of SR-202, and continuing southwest to a point between Fairfield and Fivemile Pass. The remainder of the route followed its present alignment to SR-36, replacing the portions of SR-202 and SR-180 that lay outside the canyons in the Rush Valley. The part of former SR-73 from Fairfield north to the junction south of Cedar Fort became State Route 191, while the part south of Fairfield was given to the county. SR-202 was cut back to only the portion in Mercur Canyon, with the Manning Canyon piece dropped. Finally, a connection from the Deseret Chemical Depot north to SR-73 near its west end, constructed with federal aid in 1942, was numbered State Route 198. In short, SR-73 now connected SR-36 to SR-68, with four spurs from west to east: SR-198 to the chemical depot, SR-180 to Ophir, SR-202 to Mercur, and SR-191 to Fairfield.
Over the next two decades, all four spurs disappeared. The first two to go were SR-191 and SR-202, both eliminated in 1953. This completely removed Mercur from the state highway system, but Fairfield was kept by moving SR-73 to its current alignment through that community. SR-180 was eliminated in 1961, and SR-198 was deleted in 1969. Due to a southerly extension of SR-68 in 1960, splitting at the SR-73 intersection, the portion of SR-68 into Lehi was renumbered as an extension of SR-73, which gained its current length at that time.
