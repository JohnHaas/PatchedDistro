Anthrenus

Anthrenus is a genus of beetles in the family Dermestidae, the skin beetles. One of several genera of carpet beetles, "Anthrenus" was historically placed in a subfamily Anthreninae, though presently included in the Megatominae. The genus "Neoanthrenus" is closely related.
"Anthrenus" carpet beetles are small beetles a few millimetres long with a rather rounded shape. Their antennae bear small clubs at the end, which are plumper in males than in females. Many have a delicate and rather pretty pattern, with a dark body covered in colorful scales of various brown, tan, red, whitish and grey hues. These scales rub off easily, and old individuals are often partially devoid of them, showing the shining black elytra. A considerable number of subspecies and varieties have been named, but it is questionable whether these are all valid or simply refer to such age-related differences. The massive number of species has been divided into several subgenera, but these are not too firmly established. The small subgenus "Helocerus" for example is sometimes entirely included in "Florilinus". Also, new species are being described every now and then.
These beetles range essentially all over the world; they have even colonized some remote oceanic islands. Most species are harmless pollen-eaters, with the long-haired larvae feeding on a wide range on dead animal or plant matter. This makes them important decomposers, which clean up decaying organisms. Some, however, most notoriously the museum beetle ("A. museorum"), are significant pests, infesting stored goods and especially biological specimens in museum collections. These species have caused considerable damage to biology by destroying valuable type specimens.

Blake &amp; Brian

Blake & Brian was an American country music duo composed of singer-songwriters Brian Gowan (born March 7, 1969 in Temple, Texas) and Blake Weldon (September 13, 1966 in Lufkin, Texas).
The two were paired up by record producer Chuck Howard in 1995. Their self-titled debut album was issued in 1997 on the Curb Records label. The album's lead-off single, "Another Perfect Day", peaked at No. 45 on the "Billboard" country charts. "Country Standard Time" gave the album a mixed review, stating that although Gowan and Weldon were "indistinguishable vocally and equally malleable", and although some of the songs were derivative of the Eagles, the more up-tempo tracks were "punch up... with timeless Texas kick". After releasing this album, they charted two more singles ("The Wish" and "Amnesia"), the latter of which was not included on an album. By 1999, Blake & Brian had parted ways. Gowan released a solo album entitled "Warm Spanish Wine" in 2000. He also co-wrote Rodney Atkins' 1997 debut single "In a Heartbeat" and three songs on Atkins' 2003 debut album "Honesty".

Find Us

"Find Us" (sometimes subtitled "In the Back of the Club") is the second single from "Milk Me", a 2004 album by East Coast hip hop group The Beatnuts. It was released by Penalty Recordings as a CD single and 12 inch with "Hot" as its United States b-sides and "It's Nothing" as it United Kingdom b-side. The song is produced by The Beatnuts and features raps by Juju and Psycho Les, as well as a chorus sung by a young Akon. The song's lyrics are both braggadocios and sexually explicit. The song's beat is characterized by its stomp-and-clap percussion, as well as its intermittent whistling noise. The song also features live instrumentation provided by guitarist Eric Krasno and keyboardist Neal Evans.
"Find Us" was released to mainly positive critical reception: Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic considers it a "standout" song, while Tom Doggett of RapReviews.com adds that it has a "marvelous minimalist beat" and "catchy hook." Low Key of MVRemix.com describes "Find Us" as "a perfect club song for the summer" because of its "infectious handclaps." On a less positive note, Robert DeGracia of AllHipHop.com claims: "['Find Us'] is a complete eye-crosser that makes listeners struggle to make sense of what's exactly rocking around the clock."
Music Video.
"Find Us" failed to chart despite its critical reception and the release of a Ulysses Terrero-directed music video. The video was controversially not played on BET because some suspect the channel was anti-underground hip hop. BET justified their decision claiming, "BET doesn't break new artists," in reference to Akon. The music video shows The Beatnuts and Akon rapping in a club environment.

In 1968 after winning the Portuguese League and reaching the European Cup final, against Manchester United in a final played at the Wembley Stadium, lost after extra time, S.L. Benfica were presented with European Team of the Year by France Football. 
In 1970 after winning the domestic double (Scottish League and Scottish League Cup) and getting to the European Cup Final of 1970, Celtic F.C. were presented with European Team of the Year by France Football. At this time in European football, Celtic were a force to be reckoned with and the winning of the League title was one of their 9 in a row from 1966 to 1974.
Although Celtic F.C. lost the final in Italy (Milan, San Siro) to Feyenoord, the media coverage in the semi-final between Celtic F.C. and Leeds United (2nd leg at Hampden Park on 15 April 1970) was very intense, newspapers on both sides of the border reported it and said it to be "one of the most exciting battle of Britain yet". The attendance for the match was also a record at a UEFA competitive match (136,505). In the League Cup, Celtic won against mid-table team St Johnstone and in the League Celtic won against Rangers by a margin of 12 points.

Inner Six

The Inner Six, or simply The Six, are the six founding member states of the European Communities. This was in contrast to the outer seven who formed the European Free Trade Association rather than be involved in supranational European integration (though most later joined the European Communities).
History.
The inner six are those who responded to the Schuman Declaration's call for the pooling of coal and steel resources under a common High Authority. The six signed the Treaty of Paris creating the European Coal and Steel Community on 18 April 1951 (which came into force on 23 July 1952). Following on from this, they attempted to create a European Defence Community: with the idea of allowing West Germany to rearm under the authority of a common European military command, a treaty was signed in 1952. However the plan was rejected by the Senate of France, which also scuppered the draft treaty for a European Political Community (which would have created a political federation to ensure democratic control over the new European army). President of the ECSC High Authority, and architect of the ECSC, Jean Monnet resigned in protest and began work on a new plan concentrating on economic fields.
Dependency on overseas oil and the steady exhaustion of coal deposits led to the idea of an atomic energy community (a separate Community was favoured by Monnet, rather than simply extending the powers of the ECSC as suggested by the Common Assembly). However the Benelux countries and Germany desired a common market (though opposed by France and Monnet). In order to reconcile the two ideas, both communities would be created. Thus, the six went on to sign the Treaties of Rome in 1957, establishing the European Economic Community and the European Atomic Energy Community. The institutions of these communities would later be merged in 1967, leading to them collectively being known as the "European Communities". The six would continue in their co-operation until 1973 when they were joined by two of the outer seven (UK and Denmark) and Ireland.
Enlargement to the seven.
The events of the Suez Crisis showed the United Kingdom that it could no longer operate alone, instead turning to the United States and the European Community. Britain, along with Denmark, Ireland and Norway, applied for membership in 1960. However, then–French President Charles de Gaulle saw British membership of the Community as a Trojan horse for US interests, and hence stated he would veto British membership. The four countries resubmitted their applications on 11 May 1967 and with Georges Pompidou succeeding Charles de Gaulle as French President, the veto was lifted. Negotiations began in 1970 and two years later the accession treaties were signed with all but Norway acceding to the Community (Norway rejected membership in a referendum).
After its democratic revolution, Portugal would also leave EFTA to join the Communities in 1986, joined by Sweden and Austria in 1995, leaving only Norway and Switzerland as the remaining members of the original outer seven, although EFTA has gained two new members (Iceland and Liechtenstein) and Finland had joined, then left the pact in the intervening time. On the other hand, membership of the Communities, now the European Union (EU), has reached 28.
Modern "inner" groups.
Today, there are still some groups within the European Union integrating faster than others, for example; the eurozone and Schengen Area (see: Opt-outs in the European Union). The Treaty of Lisbon includes provisions for a group of countries to integrate without the inclusions of others if they do not wish to join in as, following the rejection of the European Constitution, some leaders wished to create an inner, more highly integrated Federal Europe within a slower-moving EU.

Nickelodeon (Sweden)

Nickelodeon Sweden is a children's channel broadcasting to Sweden.
Nickelodeon has been the third most popular children's television channel in Sweden since 2006. SVTB is by far the most popular, with the Disney Channel as a strong second.
History.
Nickelodeon has been available in Sweden since 1996 when a pan-Scandinavian version was launched on the analogue Viasat platform. Since 2001, it has been broadcasting in the digital terrestrial television network. This pan-Scandinavian channel used to broadcast between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. since it started sharing a transponder with TV6 Nature/Action World in the late 1990s. In March 2008, Nickelodeon received a license to broadcast between 5 a.m. and 7 p.m. on the terrestrial network.
On June 18, 2008, the dedicated Swedish version of Nickelodeon was launched with a separate schedule. The new channel broadcasts between 5 a.m. and 7 p.m. on most digital pay television platforms. Unlike the Pan-Scandinavian channel, which was broadcast from the UK, the Swedish version is broadcast from the Netherlands.
Since September 2013, Nickelodeon Sweden started to use the new Idents from Nickelodeon USA and Nickelodeon UK & Ireland.
The channel used to share frequency space with Comedy Central Sweden since the launch of the latter in January 2009. The two channels got separate channel slots in November 2013. This allowed Nickelodeon Sweden to start broadcasting between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m. on most providers from November 15.
Shows.
The schedule starts with a Nick Jr strand for younger kids with series such as "Dora the Explorer", "Backyardigans" and "Postman Pat". The channel also includes music video strands called "Nick Hits". Cartoons for younger children are dubbed into Swedish. Non-cartoon series aimed an older audience are broadcast in Swedish dub.
The Nicktoon "The Fairly OddParents" is broadcast on Disney Channel and Nickelodeon (as of Spring 2009).

Gunther Gerzso

Gunther Gerzso (June 17, 1915 – April 21, 2000) was a Mexican painter, designer and director and screenwriter for film and theatre.
Biography.
Gerzso was born in Mexico City, in the times of the Revolution. His parents were Oscar Gerzso (), a Hungarian immigrant, and Dore Wendland, German by birth. After his father's death a few months after Gunther was born, his mother married a German jeweler. The economic crisis during the revolution caused the family to flee to Europe in 1922. The family returned to Mexico two years later and her mother divorced. Not being able to provide for the children, she sent Gunther to Lugano, Switzerland to live with his uncle Dr. Hans Wendland, who was an influential name in the art world. Gunther, then a teenager, met Paul Klee and lived among his uncle's collection of paintings which included works by Pierre Bonnard, Rembrandt, Paul Cézanne, Eugène Delacroix and Titian. During his time in Lugano, he also met Nando Tamberlani, noted set designer who would introduce him to the world of theater.
In 1931, due to the impact of the Great Depression in Europe, Dr. Wendland sent the boy back to his mother in Mexico City. Back home he started doing sketches for set designs and writing plays influenced by Mr. Tamberlani. Two years later he started working in a local theater production company run by Fernando Wagner. In 1935 he was offered a scholarship to study at the Cleveland Play House where he made more than 50 set designs over the course of four years. During the 1940s and '50s he made various set designs for Mexican, French and American films. He won a total of five Premios Ariel (The Mexican Equivalent of the Oscars) for Best Production Design as well as two more honorary Ariel Awards in 1994 and 2000. During this time he collaborated with directors like Emilio "El Indio" Fernández in "Un Día de Vida" (1950), Luis Buñuel in "Susana" (1951), "Una Mujer sin Amor" (1952) and "El rio y la muerte" (1955), Yves Allégret in "Les Orgueilleux" (1953), and John Huston in "Under the Volcano" (1984).
In the late 1930s Gerzso also started painting as a hobby. The steady parade of beautiful actresses and interesting people he met in show business provided him with a great inspiration for his canvases which showed a mix of European and Mexican influences. His friend, Bernard Pfriem, convinced him to enter the annual Art Exhibition at the Cleveland Museum of Art where two of his works were selected. It was then that Gunther Gerzso started considering himself a painter more than a set designer. In 1941 Gerzso and his wife moved permanently to Mexico City and in 1944 he joined a group of surrealist painters that had taken refuge from the Second World War in Mexico. These artists were Benjamin Péret, Leonora Carrington, Remedios Varo, Alice Rahon and Wolfgang Paalen. His works from this period show a clear surrealist influence, which he later abandoned when he started working his famous abstracts.
According to Octavio Paz, Gunther Gerzso was one of the greatest Latin American painters, since it was him, along with Carlos Mérida and Rufino Tamayo, who opposed the ideologist aesthetic movement into which muralism had degenerated.
Gunther Gerzso was awarded the Guggenheim Fellowship in 1973 and later in 1978 he was the recipient of the Premio Nacional de Bellas Artes. Gunther Gerzso died on April 21, 2000.

Alton Beast (later known as New Beast) was a roller coaster at Alton Towers. It first opened in 1988 in the Talbot Street (now Cloud Cuckoo Land) section of the park with the "Alton Mouse", a second-hand wild mouse coaster, and was marketed by the park as the largest coaster in the UK. It was a very popular ride, and it stayed in Talbot Street until 1992, when it was moved to Thunder Valley near the "Thunder Looper" (where the "Air" shop is now) and renamed the "New Beast". In 1994, "Nemesis" opened and the area was changed into Forbidden Valley. The "New Beast" stayed in Forbidden Valley until the end of 1997, when it was removed to make way for "Air", the park's 2002 flying coaster.It was later removed in 1999

<doc id="18420982" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18420982" title="Artificial gravity (fiction)">
Artificial gravity (fiction)

Artificial gravity is a common theme in fiction, particularly science fiction.
Rotational gravity.
In the movie "", a rotating centrifuge in the "Discovery" spacecraft provides artificial gravity. The people would be walking inside the circle; their feet toward the exterior and their head toward the center, the floor and ceiling would curve upwards. A rotating circular set was used in at least one instance to make this effect with the actors always at the bottom; as they walked, the set would be turned to keep the actors at the bottom and prevent them from falling over as they walked up the curved floor. The movie also features a rotating space station.
Larry Niven's novel "Ringworld" featured a gigantic habitat encircling a star, which created artificial gravity through rotation. Niven also makes a reference to the Coriolis effect when the protagonists see what looks like a giant eye above the horizon. When they get closer, they realise that it is in fact a hurricane, but rotating about an axis parallel to the ground rather than perpendicular to it. Large hurricanes on Earth rotate the way they do due to the Coriolis effect. A number of early Known Space and Man-Kzin Wars stories also make use of rotational gravity, prior to the adoption of "gravity polarizer" technology which generates artificial gravity fields.
In the Gundam universe, gigantic space habitats similar to O'Neill cylinders, called Colonies, are an important aspect to the plot. They spin to generate artificial gravity.
In the anime "Cowboy Bebop", the Bebop possesses a ringed area that generates artificial gravity and is often seen being used (with the rest of the ship not rotating).
The book "Rendezvous with Rama" and the sequels featured an alien construct similar to an O'Neill habitat which was able to generate approximately 0.6g on the intentionally habitable ground section. The plot employed significant use of the difference in strength of artificial gravity as an object approaches the center of the rotating cylinder.
In the television series "Babylon 5", the Earth Alliance made extensive use of rotational gravity in its space stations and some larger military vessels, as well as civilian cruise ships. It has been suggested that the cruise ships would alter their rate of spin gradually en route to match the destination, helping to acclimate the passengers to the new gravity they would find upon arrival. Earlier Earth Force ships using straps and harnesses to hold crew in place, and the Minbari later share the secret of artificial gravity as part of the Interstellar Alliance.
In the stories based on Sid Meier's "Alpha Centauri", the Unity provided artificial gravity by spinning, though the game made allusions to less conventional technologies developed later on.
In John Varley's "Gaian" trilogy ("Titan", "Wizard", and "Demon"), the title world Gaia, being a torus with a diameter of 1300 kilometers, spins at a rate of one revolution per sixty-one minutes, producing an apparent gravity of one-quarter "g".
In Iain M. Banks's Culture series, Orbitals are made ten million kilometres in circumference so that they spin with a rate that gives a natural day/night cycle while the center is in orbit around a star.
In the game "", the main location of the story is an artificial ringworld that creates artificial gravity by computer-controlled rotational spin (inspired by the aforementioned Larry Niven's novel "Ringworld" but also uses some form of field or other artificially generated gravity as it is stated in Halo: The Flood, the ring world does not spin nearly fast enough to create the amount of gravity it possesses. "Halo" (or "Installation 04") is approximately 10,000 km in diameter and is eventually destroyed by the same forces keeping it in operation. A fusion explosion weakens part of the ringworld, and centrifugal forces tear the ring apart.
Field generators.
In many science fiction stories, there are artificial gravity generators that create a gravitational field based on a mass that does not exist. It helps the story by creating a more Earth-like spaceship, and in the case of a movie or television program, it helps the production because it is a lot cheaper than the special effects needed to simulate weightlessness.
In the "Star Trek" universe, artificial gravity is achieved by the use of "gravity plating" embedded in a starship's deck.
In Gene Roddenberry's "Andromeda", set thousands of years in the future, gravity field generators not only provide gravity for the people inside the ship, but also reduce inertial mass of ships such as the "Andromeda Ascendant" to just under a kilogram. This greatly increases the efficiency of their Magneto-Plasma Dynamic Drive, allowing them to go from a stop to percentages of light speed very quickly. It can also be easily manipulated to do things like increase gravity and immobilize intruders (though prepared intruders can use an antigravity harness to prepare for this possibility), and reversed to expel things from the ship.
In the anime "Dragon Ball Z", gravity simulation plays a key part in various character's training regime. It is also used to demonstrate the character's increasing strength. For example, when Goku first arrives on King Kai's planet, he is nearly crushed by the gravity, which is ten times that of Earth's. By the end of his visit, nearly a year later, he is able to move at great speed under such conditions. This method of training gradually appears more and more in the universe, and the gravity gets stronger as well. Ten times Earth's gravity goes from a seemingly indomitable level of opposition to nothing, and several hundred times Earth's gravity becomes the standard. Vegeta even had a Gravity Room built into his house.
In the "Doctor Who" story "The Sontaran Experiment", a Sontaran used similar technology to make a bar above a human very heavy, so that his friends had to lift it up with as much force as they could to prevent him being crushed. The Sontaran gradually increased the bar's weight as part of an experiment to study not only their physical strength but also their loyalty, as their friend had recently attempted to betray them.
In the BioWare series "Mass Effect", the eponymous "mass effect" is responsible for the manipulation of gravity or kinetic forces(if the mass effect field is alternating), caused by subjecting a quantity of fictional "element zero" to an electrical current. A negative current reduces the mass of anything within the field, a positive current increases mass, and an alternating current will create a barrier force of immense power that can shield or crush anything the force is directed at. Mass effect is used in faster than light travel, artificial gravity on spacecraft, weapon technology, kinetic barriers and shields, and much more. Individuals exposed to element zero are known as "biotics," the nodules of element zero embedded into their nervous systems allow them to use neural impulses to create mass effect fields themselves if the power of the element is amplified with a biotic amp, granting specific types of abilities such as certain types of telekinesis. An individual exposed to this "eezo" would often rather cause cancer.
In the video game "Dead Space", artificial gravity plates are used to simulate an Earth-like environment in outer space. In several levels, gravity plating is off and the player has to navigate in weightlessness using 'Zero-Gravity Boots', similar to magnetic boots. Defective gravity plates are also encountered sometimes, which push objects upward rather than downward with great force, killing the player or enemies instantly if they step on them.
Dense matter.
In "Killing Field" by Charles Sheffield, he envisaged ships with a disk containing a flat arrangement of black holes at the nose, with a moveable crew capsule. When the ship was stationary, the crew compartment was positioned to give a comfortable 1g downwards towards the nose, but as the ship accelerated at up to 50g, the crew compartment was moved closer to the nose to cancel the acceleration effects and keep the crew comfortable.

The Wines of Alsace

The Wines of Alsace by Tom Stevenson was published in 1993 by Faber & Faber. This 600 page book profiles 300 producers, 118 wine villages, 51 grands crus, 84 lieux-dits, 28 clos and 4 wine-producing châteaux of Alsace. The vintage chart stretches from 1992 back to 585.
In “Alsace, French or German?”, Stevenson traces the historical development of Alsace back to the Protocelts who settled this part of the Rhine 3,500 years ago, and determines that not only was Alsace originally German, but it was the French who were the first to invade the region. He also researched the popular notion that the reputation of Alsace wine was deliberately lost by the Germans after the Franco-Prussian War, and discovered that prior to that war the French had expanded the region’s vineyards into unsuitable areas on the plains, and planted them with lowly varieties, “proof positive” according to Stevenson that “it was Gallic madness, not German vindictiveness”.
Although published in 1993, Stevenson’s portraits of the growers are still considered valid today, due to his ability to capture the essence of the people and their wines.

<doc id="18421030" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18421030" title="Prosection">
Prosection

A prosection is the dissection of a cadaver (human or animal) or part of a cadaver by an experienced anatomist in order to demonstrate for students anatomic structure. In a dissection, students learn by doing; in a prosection, students learn by either observing a dissection being performed by an experienced anatomist or examining a specimen that has already been dissected by an experienced anatomist (etymology: Latin pro- "before" + sectio "a cutting")
A prosection may also refer to the dissected cadaver or cadaver part which is then reassembled and provided to students for review.
Use of prosections in medicine.
Prosections are used primarily in the teaching of anatomy in disciplines as varied as human medicine, chiropractic, veterinary medicine, and physical therapy. Prosections may also be used to teach surgical techniques (such as the suturing of skin), pathology, physiology, reproduction medicine and theriogenology, and other topics.
The use of the prosection teaching technique is somewhat controversial in medicine. In the teaching of veterinary medicine, the goal is to "create the best quality education ... while ensuring that animals are not used harmfully and that respect for animal life is engendered within the student." Others have concluded that dissections and prosections have a negative impact on students' respect for patients and human life. Some scholars argue that while actual hands-on experience is essential, alternatives such as plastinated or freeze-dried cadavers are just as effective in the teaching of anatomy while dramatically reducing the number of cadavers or cadaver parts needed. Other alternatives such as instructional videos, plastic models, and printed materials also exist. Some studies find them equally effective as dissection or prosections, and some schools of human medicine in the United States have abandoned the use of cadavers entirely. But others question the usefulness of these alternatives, arguing dissection or prosection of cadavers are required for in-depth learning and teach skills alternatives cannot. Some scholars and teachers go so far as to argue that cadavers and prosections are irreplaceable in the teaching of medicine.
Whether prosections are as effective as dissections in the teaching of medicine is also an unsettled aspect of medical education. Some have concluded that prosections are equally effective. However, others argue that the use of prosections is not as effective, and that dissections help students learn about "detached concern," better understand medical uncertainty, and allow teachers to raise moral issues about death and dying. 
But some academics conclude that the effectiveness of prosections versus dissection or other alternatives depends on the type of anatomy or the discipline being taught (e.g., anatomy versus pathology), that the teaching of anatomy is not yet well-enough understood, and that existing studies are too narrow or limited to draw conclusions.

Master of the Barbarigo Reliefs

The Master of the Barbarigo Reliefs was an Italian sculptor active around Venice between about 1486 and about 1515. His name is derived from a set of reliefs in bronze, depicting the Coronation and Assumption of the Virgin and the twelve Apostles. These may be seen today in the Ca' d'Oro in Venice; they were formerly on the altar, serving as a double tomb for the Barbarigo family, which once stood in the church of Santa Maria della Carità, which now houses the Gallerie dell'Accademia. The tombs were dismantled in 1808, but other pieces survive, including a kneeling effigy of Doge Agostino Barbarigo in marble and a relief in limestone depicting the Resurrection; another kneeling effigy, depicting Doge Marco Barbarigo, is also known to have at one time existed as part of the tomb. The complete tomb design is shown in an engraving from 1692; according to this the bronzes were placed on the altar of the central bay, flanked by the kneeling figures on either side. Further effigies, depicting figures reclining on a bier, were placed in each adjoining bay. Documentary evidence indicates that work on the sculpture was begun around 1486, at Marco Barbarigo's death; the reliefs were probably completed by 1515.

He moved out from Magra at the age of 12 and started to play for Morlanda GoIF in Orust. He changed club to Stenungsunds IF where he also played senior football. He was signed for the youth team of the Swedish champions IFK Göteborg in December 2007, but soon began to train and play with the senior squad.
He made his debut in Allsvenskan on 1 July 2008 when he came on as a substitute against Trelleborgs FF. Only eleven days later, he made his first Allsvenskan goal for the club, securing three points against Djurgårdens IF by scoring 2–1 in the 91st minute.
After his debut season he was awarded Best Newcomer at the annual Fotbollsgalan, beating Sebastian Rajalakso, Rasmus Jönsson and Joel Ekstrand. At the same time the Managing Director of FC Groningen, Hans Nijland claimed that the club had made an offer for Söder, but had been turned down by the player.
In January 2009 was linked with a move to Werder Bremen, Milan, Bayern Munich, Palermo and Roma.
International career.
He has been a regular in the Swedish national youth teams, and he was the captain of the Swedish U17 team in 2 matches in 2007. He became the youngest person ever to play in the Swedish U21 team, being 17 years and 157 days old when he played in Sweden U21's match against Poland on 5 September 2008. The record was previously held by Leif Eriksson (Köpings IS), who was 17 years and 212 days when he made his debut for Sweden U21 in 1959 against Norway.
On 23 May 2009 he was selected for the Swedish squad competing in the 2009 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship. Söder played one game in this tournament, coming as a substitute in the semi-final against England.

CLCA3

Chloride channel, calcium activated, family member 3, also known as CLCA3, is a protein which in humans is encoded by the "CLCA3P" pseudogene. The protein encoded by this gene is a chloride channel. This protein is not expressed in humans but is in certain other species such as mouse.
Function.
This gene is a transcribed pseudogene belonging to the calcium sensitive chloride conductance protein family. To date, all members of this gene family map to the same site on chromosome 1p31-p22 and share high degrees of homology in size, sequence and predicted structure, but differ significantly in their tissue distributions. This gene contains several nonsense codons compared to other family members that render the transcript a candidate for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Therefore, this gene is unlikely to be protein-coding. Protein structure prediction methods suggest the N-terminal region of CLCA3 protein is a zinc metalloprotease, and the protein is not an ion channel per se.

Utto

The Blessed Utto was the first abbot of the Bavarian Metten Abbey of the Benedictine Order. His feast is celebrated on October 3.
Biography.
Utto was presumably a monk at the abbey of Reichenau; his place of birth is unknown. According to tradition he was a relative and the godson of the priest and landlord Gamelbert in the Bavarian community Michaelsbuch, a few kilometers up from the confluence of the river Isar on the right-hand side of the Danube near the modern-day town of Plattling. As Gamelbert founded Metten Abbey on his ground around 766, he is said to have entrusted Utto with the settlement. Utto, who came from Reichenau to Metten together with twelve other monks was appointed the first abbot of the abbey. The name Abbot Utto of Metten appears in 772 in the Verbrüderungsbuch (a German register of medieval abbeys) of the synod of Dingolfing and in 784 in the Verbrüderungsbuch of St. Peter's Archabbey in Salzburg. He died on October 3, 829 in Metten Abbey.
Legend.
According to late medieval legend, Charlemagne was the founder of Metten Abbey and Utto was a hermit in the woods around Metten. Charlemagne was said to have met him while hunting and to have promised the foundation of an abbey in the honour of Saint Michael on the request of this pious man (after 788). A small church called Uttobrunn was erected in the 17th century at a spring to commemorate the site of this alleged meeting.
Relics.
Metten Abbey keeps a medieval crosier, that is revered as the staff of Blessed Utto. The crook is carved from walrus tooth to form a dragon encircling a lamb with a banner of victory. From comparison with similar objects it cannot be dated earlier than the beginning of the 13th century, however. The staff itself may be older, as a bronze band below the crook is inscribed with Romanesque majuscules: QVOD DŇS [= Dominus] PETRO, PETRVS TIBI CONTVLIT, VTTO ("What the Lord has assigned to Peter, Peter has assigned to you, Utto").

The Master of the Weibermacht (sometimes called the Master of 1462) was a German engraver active in the Lower Rhine area between about 1450 and 1460. His name comes from the work for which he is best known, a large-format depiction of the "Weibermacht", or "Power of Women". A further group of engravings, depicting both religious and secular subjects, has also been attributed to him on the basis of style; the works in question show coarse draughtsmanship, and their engraving technique is similar. These works have nonetheless been ascribed to various artists at one time or another.

Haig Point Range Lights

The Haig Point Range Lights were range lights on Calibogue Sound at the northeastern end of Daufuskie Island in Beaufort County, South Carolina. The Haig Point Range Lights were built in 1873 and were maintained as an official aid to navigation until about 1924. The Rear Range Light house has been restored. It is a guest house for the Haig Point Club and serves as a private aid to navigation. 
Calibogue Sound is between Daufuskie and Hilton Head Islands. It connects the Intracoastal Waterway and the Harbour Town Marina with the Atlantic Ocean. 
In 1871, the U.S. Congress authorized two sets of range lights on Daufuskie Island. The other range lights were the Bloody Point Range Lights on the south end of the island. Land was procured in 1872 at Haig's Point for the first set. The Haig Point range lights were lit in 1873. Although most sources indicate that the range lights were deactivated in 1924, others indicate that it was as early as 1922, to as late as 1934 or 1938.
Rear Range Light.
The Rear Range light, built by James H. Reed, had a square tower on top of the light keeper's wooden, two-story Victorian house. The foundation for the house rests on the Tabby cement foundation of an old plantation house. The house and tower are painted white. The lantern has a red roof. The light was a 5th order Fresnel lens with a kerosene lamp. Later, an electric light was installed. In addition to the house, an oil house, and a 6,000 US gallon (22,700 L) cistern were built. This light was manned until about 1924. 
In 1925, the house was sold. Over time, it passed through several hands and fell into disrepair. In 1984, the house was purchased by the International Paper Realty Corporation. They began a restoration of the house as a guest house of the Haig Point Club. The oil house and cistern remain near the lighthouse.
In 1986, after about sixty years of darkness, a lamp was again activated in the Haig Point lighthouse. This light has an acrylic lens and is powered by solar cells and batteries. This flashing white light is a private aid to navigation.
The rear range is a contributing property of the National Register of Historic Places' Daufuskie Island Historic District. The nomination form and an additional picture is available from the South Carolina Department of Archives and History. In addition, the Beaufort County Historical Surveys for both the lighthouse and the oil house are available. These have recent photographs.
Front Range Light.
The front range light was a wooden structure with a lantern; the lighting apparatus was a steamer lens. The tower was located about south of the rear range light. This structure was movable to adjust to shifts in the channel. The fate of the front light after the station was closed is unknown, although some sources list it as having been destroyed.

The Holy Innocents (novel)

The Holy Innocents (1988) is a novel by Gilbert Adair about incestuous siblings and the stranger who enters their world. Its themes were inspired by Jean Cocteau's novel "Les Enfants Terribles ("The Holy Terrors") and by the film of the same name directed by Jean-Pierre Melville.
Publishing.
The book has been printed in hardcover and paperback only once. Remaining copies of the original novel fetch hefty prices on auction websites such as eBay. "The Holy Innocents" was revised
Plot.
"The Holy Innocents" is the story of three young cinephiles, Matthew, an American studying in Paris, and the French twins Guillaume and Danielle. Set in the tumultuous months of 1968, it is a story of obsession and youth. 
The initial obsession is cinematic. Matthew is studying film, the twins are fascinated by the cinema, and they become close because of their shared interest. Spending their evenings at Paris's grand Cinémathèque they live only for the cinema. When French Culture Minister André Malraux fires Cinémathèque director Langlois, a prelude to the May uprising, the Cinémathèque is closed. A nation is thrown into confusion, but the three youngsters hardly notice: their small world has been ruined, and they do not know what to do. Matthew manages to establish a relationship with the twins beyond the confines of the Cinémathèque—though it is initially still cinematically centered. Invited for dinner at their house he is invited to spend the night, which he does. There he discovers that Danielle and Guillaume's relationship goes beyond the usual sibling intimacy—and finds he is not as troubled by this as he would have expected. Attracted to both of them he moves in with them, their father—a famous poet—and stepmother conveniently setting off for an extended stay in the country. 
The youngsters live in their own little world, not bothering to go to school any more, playing cinematic trivia games (raising the stakes all the while), reveling in their youth. They live the lives of innocents, cut off from society and civilization. They do not wash their clothes, they steal their food, they don't care about the world around them. They have sex as partners (in all permutations) and all together. 
They are finally thrust back into society in May 1968, only to find the siege on the streets as Paris has risen up around them.
Adaptation.
A French-British-Italian co-produced "film adaptation" of the novel was made in 2003, directed by Bernardo Bertolucci and starring Louis Garrel, Eva Green, and Michael Pitt.

Last Child in the Woods

Last Child in the Woods: Saving Our Children From Nature-Deficit Disorder is a 2005 book by author Richard Louv that documents decreased exposure of children to nature in American society and how this "nature-deficit disorder" harms children and society. The book examines research and concludes that direct exposure to nature is essential for healthy childhood development and for the physical and emotional health of children and adults. The author also suggests solutions to the problems he describes. A revised and expanded edition was published in 2008.
Reception.
The book was on the New York Times best seller list for best paper nonfiction. The author received the Audubon Medal "for sounding the alarm about the health and societal costs of children's isolation from the natural world—and for sparking a growing movement to remedy the problem."
Children & Nature Network.
The success of Last Child in the Woods inspired the creation of Children & Nature Network co-founded and chaired by the book’s author, Richard Louv, to encourage and support the people and organizations working to reconnect children with nature.
Green Hour.
Green Hour is an organization that provides information on how to reverse Nature-Deficit Disorder, and encourages parents to let their children explore and reconnect with the outdoors.

Viviparus glacialis

†Viviparus glacialis is an extinct species of fossil freshwater snail, an aquatic gastropod mollusks in the family Viviparidae, the river snails.
Shell description.
This species of snail had an elongated, slim, rather thick-walled shell with approximately 6 ¼ flat whorls which are separated by a shallow suture. The apex is blunt. The aperture is slantingly oval and weakly angulated at the top. The peristome is simple, not thickened and not continuous. There is a narrow umbilicus that may be covered with callus. The surface of the shell is smooth and glossy and bears regular growing lines. Under a magnification of c. 50× a sculpture of fine spiral grooves can be observed. These 'grooves' are composed of densely spaced tiny holes. In most cases the periostracum has not been preserved but if still present this has a light brown to black color. Whether or not the shell had a color pattern, and if so what that might have been is unknown.
The width of the shell is up to 13.5 mm, the height is up to 24 mm.
Anatomy.
Nothing is known about the anatomy of the animal.
Distribution.
The species is only known from the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. From the United Kingdom only 6 specimens are known (among which is the holotype). The specimens have been found in the Weybourn Crag, which has an estuarine facies. In the Netherlands the species has been only found in deposits of the River Rhine. It is known from clay pits in the surroundings of the village of Tegelen (Province of Limburg) and in several dozens of boreholes, especially in the Southern part of the Netherlands. The species may occasionally occur there in very high numbers.
Fossil occurrence.
In the Netherlands known from interglacial deposits with a Tiglian and Pretiglian age. In the United Kingdom only present in the late Tiglian.
As an index fossil.
"Viviparus glacialis" is, although already present in the Pretiglian, considered as a guide fossil or index fossil for the Tiglian.
Ecology.
Reproduction and life span.
Although all Viviparidae are ovoviviparous, nothing is known about the reproduction strategy of this species. Based upon counting of the annual growth rings within the shell, this species may reach an age of at least 12 years.
Habitat.
According to the ecological preferences of extant species co-occurring with "Viviparus glacialis" and the sedimentary facies in which these are found, the species favours quiet parts of a fluvial environment. From the same data it may be concluded that the species can endure a slight increase of salinity.

The Little Show

The Little Show is a musical revue with lyrics by Howard Dietz and music by Arthur Schwartz. This was the first of 11 musicals that featured the songs of Dietz and Schwartz. The revue opened on Broadway in 1929.
History.
The show grew out of a number of Sunday evening variety shows co-produced by Tom Weatherly with James Pond at the Selwyn Theatre. Weatherly said that they were "really nothing more than high-class vaudeville shows but they were far more artistic than the Sunday night variety programs being offered at the Winter Garden."
Revue elements.
"This was the first American revue to give wit precedence over spectacle." Fred Allen (who had been a vaudeville headliner as a juggler and ventriloquist) "won acclaim with his sardonic banter", "torch singer Libby Hollman smoldered." Clifton Webb, the debonair star, "wanted a number that was more perverse, a number he could deliver all alone in full-dress suit and a spotlight...a lyric with suave romantic frustration." The song was "I Guess I'll Have to Change My Plan", which was used again in the 1953 MGM musical "The Band Wagon". The song "Hammacher Schlemmer, I Love You" was an "open-hearted tribute" to the hardware store.
According to Kay Green, the funniest sketch was George S. Kaufman's "The Still Alarm" which concerns nonchalant hotel guests Webb and Fred Allen, completely oblivious to being in a raging fire. The most "dramatic scene was the torrid dance Clifton Webb and Libby Holman performed after Miss Holman moaned "Moanin' Low" in a squalid Harlem tenement." Smith and Litton described another act: "Fred Allen's monologues before the curtain held the audience transfixed, especially one about a little boy who shot both parents in order to be entitled to go to the orphans' picnic."
Ken Bloom wrote: ""The Little Show" was one of the first intimate revues that proved to audiences that all the Ziegfeldian trappings were not necessary for the enjoyment of a revue."
Production.
Produced by William A. Brady, Jr. and Dwight Deere Wiman, in association with Tom Weatherly, the production opened on April 30, 1929 at the Music Box Theatre for a total of 321 performances. The revue was directed by Wiman, choreographed by Danny Dare, and had scenic design by Jo Mielziner. The cast included Fred Allen, Libby Holman, John McCauley, Romney Brent, and Clifton Webb.

Western Terrace

Western Terrace is a housing subdivision on the West Side of Evansville, Indiana. It was constructed in the 1950s in a suburban style similar to Levittown, New York, where every house is very similar which allowed for more efficient, and thus more economical homebuilding practices. It is the epitome of a late 1950s Midwestern middle class subdivision. The neighborhood has evolved with Midwestern family demographics and technologies of the last 50 years and is still a vibrant community today.
Geography / Housing.
Western Terrace is not a town, just a neighborhood of about . There are approximately 222 houses on 13 streets (including the bordering thoroughfare Upper Mount Vernon Road). The streets in Western Terrace are: Upper Mount Vernon Road (bordering thoroughfare), Craig Avenue (eastern entrance), Columbia Street, Maryland Street, Oregon Street, Helfrich Avenue (western entrance), Western Avenue, Beale Street, Werner Avenue, Bosse Avenue, Clement Street, Genesta Drive, and Terrace Avenue.
The development was built by CA (Clem) Frank in the latter part of 1950s and was completed in the 1960s. The houses are stick-built with brick veneer and a low roof pitch. The basic model has gables but many have the upgraded hip roof. A gravel driveway was standard, but most have a concrete drive by now.
The standard house was a 3 bedroom, 1 bathroom house with a living room and dine-in kitchen. Hardwood floors were standard in the living and bedroom areas, but they were often covered with carpet during the '70s. Common options included basements and carports. Garages and room additions have been common improvements in the ensuing 50 years. A couple of the houses had a bomb shelter built during the height of the Cold War, and a few had the big satellite dishes (big ugly dish) installed during the advent of satellite television. Television aerials and CB radio antennas also had their day jutting up above the rooflines.
Base model houses sold in the $10,000 range at the outset of development. Current values in 2008 are in the $120,000 range giving the area an average compounded appreciation rate of approximately 5.25% over 50 years. During that time, inflation has averaged 4.1%.
Demographics / Family Life.
In the beginning, Western Terrace was populated mostly by young couples filling their houses with Baby Boom kids. These children attended primarily Perry Heights Elementary School and Corpus Christi Catholic School [http://www.corpuschristievansville.org/. From there, they went on to F.J. Reitz High School or Mater Dei High School (Evansville, Indiana). Homeowners held a combination of blue and white collar jobs with Mead Johnson, Whirlpool, and local plastic companies being popular employers.
For many years in the '60s and '70s there was a city-staffed playground park in the neighborhood. The "Ballpark", as it was known, was the kids' social hub and was located down a short little lane at the intersection of Clement and Werner streets. It had a chain-link backstop for slow pitch softball and a basketball hoop with a grass and dirt court area as its only permanent fixtures. However, many other games were played there including volleyball, badminton, various running races and field events, washers, and the ever popular box hockey The park hosted Western Terrace teams that competed against other city parks, mainly in softball. The Ballpark was also a site for qualifying for the Little Olympics which was also hosted by the Evansville City Parks Department [http://www.evansvillegov.org/index.aspx?page=48. The Little Olympics was a city wide track and field style competition. Ribbons and medals were presented to placewinners at qualifying and finals sites.
As the bulk of the baby-boom aged kids outgrew the Ballpark (as evidenced by softball home runs that bounced off nearby houses), it began to be staffed less often by the city until it was finally stopped altogether. The backstop fell into disrepair and was eventually dismantled by some of the neighborhood men because it was a hazard. The area was used as a makeshift and bicycle [bmx riding area for a while in the latter '70s. 
For a couple years in the '70s the construction site of the nearby Western Hills Apartments was an attraction for the neighborhood kids. The woods that divided Western Terrace from the Western Hills neighborhood was also a popular playground. Vine covered hideouts and treehouses dotted the landscape. The woods and entire neighborhood was the milieu for day and nighttime chase games of the Can and Fox and Hounds. Vines hanging over the valleys in the woods were used as swings until they broke, sometimes breaking an arm at the same time.
Local Landmarks.
Up until the middle 1970s the Barning family owned a horse farm adjacent to the neighborhood at the corner of Craig Avenue and Maryland Street. A popular pastime was feeding the horses through the fence along Craig Avenue. The Barnings would sometimes give the neighborhood kids horseback and pony rides. Later the Barning house and yard was sold and the rest of the property was purchased by George Marx whose family had owned land in the area for a couple of generations. Marx expanded one of the lakes on the property, cleared it all, and built a nice ranch house as a personal residence. While prohibited, the expanded lake was a semi-popular clandestine swimming hole in the late '70s and early '80s.
Between the old Barning property and Upper Mount Vernon road laid the Brickyard. In the early years of the neighborhood, the Brickyard was a functioning brickyard complete with a clay pit where clay was excavated and baked into bricks in ovens on the site. Most of the houses in Western Terrace were built from bricks fired in these ovens. By the middle 1960s the brickyard manufacturing operations ceased and the site became a distribution facility for the brick company. Today it is a General Shale Brick sales and distribution office.
As the first generation of Western Terrace children graduated high school and moved on to college or their work careers, the neighborhood went through a quieter period where the original residents had emptying nests and older kids. Slowly but surely, as happens with all new neighborhoods, Western Terrace began to "turn over". The older original residents sold their houses and moved on to other homes and new young families moved in.
Western Terrace Today.
In the 1990s the neighborhood started to experience a renaissance when the Western Terrace Neighborhood Association (WTNA)was formed to do necessary repairs and beautification projects. Signs were installed at the entrances of the neighborhood and the old ballpark began to be used for neighborhood picnics. The WTNA has also been a supporter of the National Night Out program, even garnering a mention in the local paper for their efforts in 2003. [http://local.evpl.org/views/viewimage.asp?ID=790650[http://local.evpl.org/views/viewimage.asp?ID=790649]
Some of the original owners still reside in the neighborhood but most of the houses have sold more than once.

Greylock was founded in 1965 by Bill Elfers and Dan Gregory, joined shortly thereafter by Charlie Waite. Bill and Charlie had both worked at American Research and Development Corporation—one of the country’s first venture capital firms—while Dan was an investment manager at John P. Chase. The original capital ($9 million in total) was committed by a group of six prominent families, all of whom are still investors in Greylock. Over the ensuing 43 years, Greylock has raised a series of partnerships, with current committed capital in excess of $2 billion, and helped build over 300 growth companies.
Funding.
Greylock Partners is organized in a series of thirteen limited partnerships begun in 1965, 1973, 1979, 1983, 1985, 1987, 1990, 1994, 1997, 2000, 2001, 2005 and 2009. On 2 November 2009 Greylock announced $575 Million Fund and hired Reid Hoffman, LinkedIn Co-Founder, as Partner. In 2006, Greylock launched Greylock Israel, a separate fund dedicated to Israel. Committed capital across the Greylock partnerships exceeds $2 billion. Greylock's limited partners include the nation’s most prestigious university endowments, major American industrial families and not for profit foundations. Greylock has had all of its limited partners participate in all partnerships subsequent to their original investment.

Don Adams' Screen Test

"Don Adams' Screen Test" is an American game show that aired in syndication for one season with actor Don Adams, who played Agent 86 on "Get Smart". The announcer was Dick Tufeld, probably most recognized from the science fiction television series "Lost in Space".
Gameplay.
The game involves two 15-minute periods, in which a random person would be asked to act out or re-enact a famous Hollywood movie scene (such as the race scene from the 1964 movie "Viva Las Vegas"). They would then be helped out by Adams and guest celebrities that appeared on the show. Blunders such as forgotten lines, failures of props, and celebrities ad-libbing would provide more comedy.
A second contestant would do the same. At the end, both contestants would see their screen tests, and the contestant whose screen test got a bigger reaction from the audience received a trip to Hollywood to take part in a real screen test to be in an upcoming movie or television show.
Episode status.
The series is held in its entirety (including the hour-long pilot taped May 16, 1975) by Universal Television, however has not been seen since its original airing.

The Sikeston Bulls are a summer collegiate baseball team based in Sikeston, Missouri. The team, which plays in the KIT League plays its home games in VFW Memorial Stadium, located in Sikeston, Missouri. The stadium has a seating capacity of 1,800 people. 
The Bulls were inactive in 2008 but returned to play in the 2009 season, opening with a 6-4 win over the Fulton Railroaders in the first of a three-game series. The team's home-opener was on June 1 against the Union City Greyhounds as part of a two-game series (second game on June 2). The Bulls won their home-opener with a score of 3-2 in the first home game for the Bulls since July 31, 2007.[http://www.semosportsweb.com/stories/june2009/2.html 
History.
The Sikeston Bulls joined the KIT League in 2004 in Sikeston, Missouri, which had been the previous home of the ill-fated "Bootheel Bombers", not to be confused with the Dexter, Missouri boxing club of the same name. The Bootheel Bombers played for one season in Sikeston, but then disappeared. The new team, the Sikeston Bulls, participated in the regular season play of the KIT League since the team's inception.
2005.
In 2005, the Bulls were the KIT League Playoff Champions, despite finishing the season with a .308 record and 19 games behind the first-place Farmington Firebirds.
2006.
The General Manager for the 2006 season was Jason Compton, who had previously worked with the West Tennessee Diamond Jaxx of the Southern League for five years. After departing the Bulls, Compton returned to the Diamond Jaxx, where he is now the General Manager.
2007.
The General Manager in 2007 was Fred Johnson. The announcers were Tom and Carla Young. Jiggs Moore took care of the field and grounds.
The Manager for the 2007 season was Jamie Puckett, a 2001 graduate of Sikeston High School, which has produced other notable baseball players, such as Blake DeWitt, a player for the Los Angeles Dodgers and Eric Hurley, a pitcher for the Texas Rangers (baseball).

In May 2008, an announcement was made that the team was for sale. In August 2008, a new owner was identified. John Crockett, a native of Sikeston expressed an interest in the team. He'd found out the team was for sale while serving as a Navy Reservist mobilized for a year in Iraq. 
In November 2008, Crockett finalized the purchase from the previous owner, Will Jones. Also in November 2008, Fred Johnson agreed to return as the General Manager and CJ Zeller was selected as the Manager.[http://www.standard-democrat.com/story/1497136.html] Fred Johnson had been the Bulls' General Manager for the 2006 and 2007 seasons.

On June 5, the Bulls played their first game ever against the Marion Bobcats in Marion, Kentucky, which ended in a 2-1 victory for the Bulls.
On June 28, the Bulls had a Marine color guard present for the raising of the flag prior to the start of the game. The flag had previously been flown on July 28, 2008 at the US Embassy in Baghdad, Iraq in recognition of the contributions that the city of Sikeston has made for veterans.
In 2009, the Bulls beat their all-time team record for wins in a season (18 in 2007) with a final record of 22 wins and 28 losses (.440).
All-Stars.
During a league meeting, the KIT League's 2009 All-Star Line-Up was selected. Even though the team won't actually play an All-Star game this year, team managers and owners voted to select an All-Star team as a way to recognize many of the players who made significant contributions to their teams this season. Kody Campbell, Logan Lawson, and Zach Secoy were selected as Sikeston's representatives for this team. Lance Young received Honorable Mention.[http://www.sikestonbulls.com/2009-all-star.htm]
Team Performance.
The Bulls have a history of 69 wins and 116 losses out of a total of 186 games (.371). Prior to the 2009 season, the Bulls' record was .346 with a win-loss record of 47-89 in 136 games.

Biography.
Chany was born in Langeac, Haute-Loire, the son of a near-illiterate father who worked in the horse industry. The family then moved to Paris, to run a small bar in the rue Guillaume Bertrand, in the 11th arrondissement. Chany grew up there and, in his teens, escaped from the city on his bicycle, sometimes riding as far as Melun. He became interested in cycle-racing after reading L'Auto, Paris-Soir and Match and looking at sepia pictures of riders such as André Leducq. He rode several races, including the Premier Pas Dunlop event which in other years showed the talent of young riders such as Louison Bobet and Raphaël Géminiani. In Chanaleilles, he won a cycle and a running race on the same day, winning two packets of Gauloises cigarettes. After that he joined the CV des Marchés club in Paris.
He raced for five years and then, in 1942 when he was 20, went into hiding rather than be sent to Germany as a worker.
He was arrested and jailed first at Puy-en-Velay and then Riom. He escaped - on his birthday - from a train taking him to Germany. He joined a branch of the Resistance, the Francs-Tireurs et Partisans, then joined an Algerian regiment. He was wounded three times and awarded the Croix de Guerre.
The war ended his aspirations as a cyclist and he turned to sports reporting, having briefly tried the transport business in buying two army lorries with a friend, Jacques Michelon. Encourage by another friend, Stanilas Gara, he wrote his first pieces, in 1946, for an agency which sold articles to "La Marseillaise" among others. It was in "La Marseillaise" that his first writing appeared. He then took a job with "Front National", a Resistance publication edited by Jacques Debu-Bridel. He was to replace Albert Baker d'Isy (1906–1968), an author and one of France's best-known contemporary writers. Baker d'Isy was already Chany's hero and the move brought them together for the first time and led to a lifelong friendship.
From there Chany moved to "Sport" and to "Ce Soir", publications associated with the Communist Party but which employed journalists of various opinions. It was when "Ce Soir" went out of business in 1953 that he joined L'Équipe. He was head of cycling there from 1953 to 1987.
He also wrote under the pen name Jacques Périllat for 'Miroir Sprint and 'Miroir du Cyclisme'. Chany insisted that L'Équipe's editor, Jacques Goddet, knew Chany was doing it but chose to say nothing rather than lose his leading cycling writer.
Cycling writer.
Pierre Chany wrote not only journalistic pieces but numerous other works, including books of cycling history which went to several new editions. He wrote a history of the Tour de France and then of the cycling classics and the world championships. He wrote a history of all cycle racing from the days of the first bicycle to his death in 1996. From 1974, he produced a roundup of each season, called "L'Année du Cyclisme". He wrote biographies of Fausto Coppi and Jacques Anquetil and a novel called "Une Longue Échappée" - A Long Break, a reference to a group of cyclists breaking away from the main field.
Chany received the Prix Martini in 1967 for the best sports article of the year and the Grand Prix of Sporting Literature in 1972 for his work on the Tour de France.
Jacques Anquetil said of the insight of Chany's journalism: "Don't ask me to tell you what happened during the race. There's someone more competent than I am to do that... Even I will wait until tomorrow's article by Pierre Chany in L'Équipe to find what I did, why and how I did it. What gives him authority is that he is competent, that he knows me and understands me. His version will be better than mine and it will become mine."
The Prix Pierre Chany is now awarded each year to the writer of the season's best cycling work in French. It was established in 1989. It was awarded in 2008 to Philippe Bouvet for an article about the Carrefour de l'Arbre, a section of cobbles in Paris–Roubaix.
A cyclo-sportive race is held in Chany's name in Haute-Loirehim.
"The Man of 50 Tours".
Pierre Chany sat through a succession of interviews with the writer Christophe Penot, who planned to publish them under the title "Pierre Chany, l'homme aux 50 Tours de France". Chany would have followed his 50th Tour in 1996. He attended the Classique des Alpes, won by Laurent Jalabert on 1 June and then next day went to the prologue of the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré. There he fell ill. He died of pleurisy on 18 June. By then production of the book was in progress and the author and the publisher, Éditions Cristel, kept the name in homage.
Among those at his funeral was the former professional and radio and television commentator, Robert Chapatte. It proved his last appearance in public and he died in Paris shortly afterwards.
"L'Équipe "said of Chany the day after his death: "Our newspaper has lost one of those who made his own history: sports journalism has lost one of its masters."

Kandiah Balasegaran

Balasegaram Kandiah also known as Balraj was the senior commander of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.
Early life.
Balasegaram Kandiah was born to Kandiah and Kannagi. Balraj was the youngest of a family of four boys and one girl. Balraj had his primary education at Kokkuthoduwaai in Mullaitheevu district and secondary education at Pulmoddai in the Trincomalee district. Balraj passed his "O levels" and his parents were very keen to send him to university but this didn't work out as there too many riots in the country. Balraj could speak Tamil, Sinhala and English fluently. None of his siblings joined the tigers but some of his nephews and nieces did.
Personal life.
Balraj married a woman cadre Varathaa, one of Velupillai Prabhakaran's relative making him a relative of the LTTE leader. Velupillai Prabhakaran trusted him very much and proposed the wedding himself. Varathaa like Balraj had injured her leg in a battle. Balraj soon had problems with his wife and they soon separated. Balraj never had children. His wife was stung by a russel’s viper and died. Even though they separated Balraj was emotionally affected.
LTTE.
When Balraj was a student when he was recruited by Suntharam who was one of the top leaders in PLOTE until he was shot by LTTE in a press conference. PLOTE didn't believe in hit and run tactics which was one LTTE's main tactics against the Sri Lankan Army. Instead PLOTE formed sleeper cells everywhere so that they can carry out a massive onslaught. Therefore Balraj didn't fight against the army. Balraj was an impatient person, he was prepared to fight any time. When the 1983 riots began he thought of LTTE than PLOTE and opted for it. He went to a school teacher who was recruiting members for LTTE. Even though he had a PLOTE background he was accepted. In 1983 he was a part-time member and became a full-time member in 1984.
He was soon recognised for his talent by Mahattaya who was killed in 1993 for leaking information to RAW, an Indian intelligence agency who planned to kill LTTE supremo. Velupillai Prabhakaran suspected him because of his background in PLOTE and kept him as a helper than a fighter. When the fight began with the IPKF, most of the LTTE leadership went into the deep jungles. This is where Prabhakaran found out how valuable Balraj was.
Balraj is known for his conventional warfare and psychological warfare. He commanded the first conventional, Charles Antony Brigade. During the Second Battle of Elephant Pass, Balraj landed by sea into Jaffna peninsula rather than by land. LTTE unlike many separatist organisations were very advanced. They were similar to a real government but without recognition. Balraj would attack when the enemy least expected it. The Sri Lankan army didn't expect Balraj and his cadres would be coming by sea.
Balraj always preferred to fight on the frontline amidst heavy shelling and bombing rather than the confines of a command-centre.
Velupillai Prabhakaran would always seek Balraj's help as he understood his plan more and could execute it successfully. During Balraj's last years he would be asked by Prabhakaran for assistance on the battlefield. Balraj would be there for many hours. This caused his physical health to even deteriorate. Most of the times he would in hospital in Puthukkudiyirupp for treatment but would come to the battlefield to supervise. Balraj knew during 2008 that the Sri Lankan Army were breaking through the defences and were going to capture Kilinochchi any time soon (which they did in 2 January 2009 after he died). He even said it was the final battle for Eelam, which was true because LTTE were defeated as a conventional army on May 19.
Theepan once recalled that in one heavy battle at Munthirikaikkulam, Balraj took part in an LTTE ambush in which fourteen SLA soldiers were killed and several weapons were seized.
Notable attacks.
Second Battle of Elephant Pass.
Balraj was known for his attack on Elephant pass during Operation Unceasing Waves III. He led 1,200 cadres behind enemy lines and captured the V box. Sri Lankan Army kept assaulting the area to save the Elephant Pass. He cut off supplies going to the Sri Lankan Army and attacked from three directions. This attack was deemed impossible by an US officer who visited the site few months before, it was said that a lightly armed force cannot attack such a complex base. This attack was notable for high casualties in the SLA, no air support was used and because Balraj, instead of taking land route went by sea with the aid of Colonel Soosai. This operation was very successful because Brigadier Theepan and Karuna Amman attacked south of elephant pass stopping reinforcements coming in.
LTTE military academy.
After Balraj's health started to deteriorate, he started to give lectures and instructions to LTTE cadres and officers. Balraj taught military strategy, planning and tactics. He also provided specialised training for the LTTE commandos and special forces.
Tamils in Sri Lanka.
Balraj would often talk to the Tamil people in Sri Lanka wherever he is. He is one of the most liked people in Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam because of his simplicity. He would often solve the problems of the people with Velupillai Prabhakaran. This has caused him problems with other LTTE authorities as it was their responsibility of resolving the problems. Anyone could talk to Balraj as he was easily accessible. He unlike other LTTE commanders doesn't go with bodyguards in vehicles, instead he walks to places or cycles there.
Human rights.
Even though the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam waged a violent war, Balraj was one of the commanders known for no human rights violations. He would only attack the security forces.
Politics.
Balraj would never interfere in politics and accepted Velupillai Prabhakaran as the leader of LTTE and Tamil Eelam. Being the "number 2" after Velupillai Prabhakaran, Balraj didn't get involved like Karuna Amman who split in 2004 after a political dispute.
Health.
Balraj was injured even before he received military training in Tamil nadu. He was wounded three times during direct confrontations with the Indian Army.
Balasegaram Kandiah had an heart operation in Singapore during the ceasefire period in 2003 as he was an heart patient. He has been hospitalised for two-weeks. He was injured many times in battle against the Sri Lankan Army.
Further more to Balraj's physical health, his emotional health was affected when his wife died. Balraj had dedicated his own life for the Tamil Eelam cause and cared about him less.
Death.
Balraj died on May 20, 2008 at 2:00 p.m. due to a sudden heart attack. He was promoted posthumously as Brigadier because he was responsible for many LTTE victories on the battlefront against the Sri Lankan Army. A three-day period of mourning from May 21 – 23 was declared by the LTTE.

<doc id="18421460" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18421460" title="Matthias Petersen">
Matthias Petersen

Matthias Petersen (born Matz Peters 24 December 1632 in Oldsum, died 16 September 1706) was a sea captain and whaler from Oldsum on the North Frisian island of Föhr. He became known for catching 373 whales throughout his career.
Life.
He was born as Matz Peters to a certain Peter Johnen (1595-1643) on Christmas Eve of 1632; his two older brothers were Jens (1627-1697) and Peter (1629-1678). He also had a younger brother John (or Jon) (1641-1691) and two younger sisters Thur and Jong Thur. As was the custom on the Frisian islands at the time, Peters left his home as a young boy of about 12 years to participate in the newly flourishing whaling business in the Netherlands and also took lessons in navigation. In the course of his travels he also changed his name to Matthias Petersen.
Known as ""Glücklicher Matthias"", ""Matthias der Glückliche"" or ""Mathis der Glückliche"", all of which translate to "Lucky Mathew", he became eventually famous by catching a total of 373 whales within five decades and for gathering great riches thereby. And that was, as his tomb in the graveyard of St. Lawrence's church in Süderende testifies, the reason why he "with everybody's approbation accepted the surname of "Lucky"".
The exploit of 373 caught whales was only possible since Petersen still participated in the so-called "bay fishery". At the time, the whalers would encounter great numbers of whales in the bays of Spitsbergen, so the catch for a successful return could quickly be made. Petersen also acquired his legendary catches due to his long experience as a navigator. Aged only 20, he had been made commander of a whaling vessel and for fifty years in total he would keep that occupation. As a result he also made a financial fortune. During 19 voyages as a commander, Petersen acquired a total income of € 577,800 converted, which was a valuable asset given the circumstances of the time.
In 1677, Petersen and his brother donated two great brass chandeliers to the St. Laurentii parish which are still in use today in the church of St. Lawrence. 
At the beginning of the Spanish War of Succession in 1701 Petersen's eldest son Matz, who was a commander as well, was abducted to St. Malo by a French privateer but was later released for ransom. On his last voyage in 1702 Petersen himself was caught when his ship was seized by a French privateer. He and his crew were only released after paying a ransom of 8,000 Reichsthalers. In the same year, his sons Ock and John would fall in battle with a French pirate.
Matthias Petersen died in 1706 on his native island Föhr. His tombstone displays a vita in Latin and a coat of arms with the goddess of fortune and a whale.
Offspring.
Matthias Petersen had his children homeschooled by a private teacher. So his sons were able to study at a university. Clement became a preacher in Schwesing and presumably it was him who wrote the Latin text for the inscription on his father's tomb.
Another son, Peter Matthiesen, studied at the Latin School of Husum and the University of Jena. He became bailiff of Eastern Föhr, Wyk auf Föhr and even Sylt at the same time.
His son, also a Peter Matthiesen, later became bailiff of Eastern Föhr and bailiff in the district of Western Föhr and Amrum. By Count Struensee, a university companion, Mathiessen, Jr. was made mayor of Copenhagen in 1771. After Struensee's execution for treason he remained influential and became director of the trade and fisheries school in the then-time Danish town of Altona. From there, he helped to convey posts in the Greenland trade to many seafarers from Föhr.
One great-great-grandson of Matthias Petersen, Jens Jacob Eschels from Nieblum on Föhr, became known by writing a detailed autobiography of his own exploits as a whaler and merchant captain.
It is a lesser known fact that Matthias Petersen bequeathed 100 gold florins to the church which were not paid out by his heirs. After many years of quarrelling, the parish eventually decided to move Petersen's tomb, which had been installed inside the church amid great pomp 14 years prior, out into the graveyard where it still can be seen today.

<doc id="18421473" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18421473" title="Metastasectomy">
Metastasectomy

In oncology, metastasectomy is the surgical removal of metastases, which are secondary cancerous growths that have spread from cancer originating in another organ in the body.
In many cases, metastases are not treated surgically. There are two common reasons for this. Often, even with a successful surgery the patient would have a poor prognosis. If the cancer is widely disseminated, it is likely that after surgical removal of all known metastases, new ones would occur elsewhere. Sometimes, surgery itself would have a low likelihood of success due to the location and/or extensiveness of the cancer. If complete surgical excision is feasible, however, removing both the primary cancer and its metastases may substantially improve the patient's prognosis. Some patients may even be in effect cured.
The use of metastasectomy evolved in the field of liver resection for metastasised colorectal cancer, but has evolved to include resection of metastases from different primary cancers (such as breast cancer, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, etc.) to the lungs, brain, and other organs. Not all of these applications are equally evidence-based, although with respect to some other primary cancers metastasectomy may be underutilized.
Liver metastasectomy.
Colorectal cancer.
Among colorectal cancer patients, 15-25% will have liver metastases already when the colorectal cancer is discovered, and another 25-50% will develop them in the three years after resection of their primary cancer. Of patients who die from metastasised colorectal cancer, 20% have metastasis in the liver alone.
Surgical resection of liver metastases from colorectal cancer has been found to be safe and cost-effective.
Reports from several large retrospective patient series suggest that it has a 5 year overall survival rate (5y OSR) averaging 30 to 40% and a 10y OSR around 16%, whereas the highest 5y OSR for modern chemotherapy regimens is only 9% (with FOLFOX). However, no randomized clinical trial has directly compared surgical management to chemotherapy or treatment with bevacizumab. Some have argued that the excellent results of liver metastasectomy for colorectal cancer are partially confounded by selection bias or reporting bias. Nevertheless, surgery for resectable metastases has become the standard of care, probably making such a trial (ethically) infeasible.
Previously, liver metastasectomy was limited to patients with less than four sites of metastasis in the liver, with a tumour-free margin of at least 1 centimetre, and no cancer elsewhere.
These criteria have been challenged, however, and today the main criteria are a tumour-free margin and enough functional liver tissue (70%) preserved after surgery. Patients with initially unresectable liver metastases can be pre-treated with chemotherapy (this is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy). This pre-treatment causes the tumors to shrink, resulting in a larger proportion of liver tissue that is functional, with broader margins.
Preoperative evaluation involves imaging of the liver and its metastases, for example with ultrasound, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Positron emission tomography can be useful to check the entire body for metastases, although the test can be falsely normal with small lesions or preoperative chemotherapy. Baseline blood tests typically include liver function tests and tumour markers. During surgery, intraoperative ultrasound can aid the surgeon to find additional metastases.
Pulmonary metastasectomy.
Surgery is the mainstay of treatment for patients with isolated lung metastasis from colorectal cancer. Again, no randomized clinical trials exist, and the scientific evidence is weak, limited only to case series. The surgery can be performed with a low operative mortality.
For patients in whom the primary tumour is controlled and metastases are limited to the lung, criteria for eligibility include the technical resectability of the metastases and the general fitness and lung function reserve of the patient. If there are both liver and lung metastases, a resection of both can be attempted. In general, only 10% of patients with pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer are resectable.
Blalock reported the first lung resection for metastasis from colorectal cancer in 1944.

Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)

The social norm of reciprocity is the expectation that people will respond to each other in similar ways—responding to gifts and kindnesses from others with similar benevolence of their own, and responding to harmful, hurtful acts from others with either indifference or some form of retaliation. Such norms can be crude and mechanical, such as a literal reading of the eye-for-an-eye rule lex talionis, or they can be complex and sophisticated, such as a subtle understanding of how anonymous donations to an international organization can be a form of reciprocity for the receipt of very personal benefits, such as the love of a parent.
The norm of reciprocity varies widely in its details from situation to situation, and from society to society. Anthropologists and sociologists have often claimed, however, that having some version of the norm appears to be a social inevitability. Reciprocity figures prominently in social exchange theory, evolutionary psychology, social psychology, cultural anthropology and rational choice theory.
Patterns of Reciprocity.
One-to-one reciprocity.Some reciprocal relationships are direct one-to-one arrangements between individuals, or between institutions, or between governments. Some of these are one-time arrangements, and others are embedded in long-term relationships. Families often have expectations that children will reciprocate for the care they receive as infants by caring for their elderly parents; businesses may have long-term contractual obligations with each other: governments make treaties with each other.
There are also one-to-one reciprocal relationships that are indirect. For example, there are sometimes long chains of exchanges, in which A gives a benefit to B, who passes on a similar benefit to C, and so on, in which each party in the chain expects that what goes around will eventually come back around. The classic anthropological example is the Kula exchange in the Trobriand Islands.
One-to-many and many-to-one reciprocity often lies somewhere between direct reciprocal arrangements and generalized reciprocity. Informal clubs in which the hosting arrangements circulate among members are examples of the one-to-many variety. Bridal showers are examples of the many-to-one variety. So are barn raising practices in some frontier communities. All of these are similar to direct reciprocity, since the beneficiaries are identified as such in each case, and contributors know exactly what they can expect in return. But because membership in the group changes, and needs for new meetings or marriages or barns are not always predictable, these cases differ significantly from precisely defined one-to-one cases.
Generalized reciprocity is even less precise. Here donors operate within a large network of social transactions largely unknown to each other, and without expectations about getting specific benefits in return — other than, perhaps, the sort of social insurance provided by the continuance of the network itself. Recipients may not know the donors, and may not themselves be able to make a return in-kind to that network, but perhaps feel obligated to make a return to a similar network. Blood banks and food banks are examples. But in fact any stable social structure in which there is a division of labor will involve a system of reciprocal exchanges of this generalized sort, as a way of sustaining social norms.
All of these patterns of reciprocity, along with related ideas such as gratitude, have been central to social and political philosophy from Plato onward. These philosophical discussions concern the ways in which patterns and norms of reciprocity might have a role in theories of justice, stable and productive social systems, healthy personal relationships, and ideals for human social life generally.
The Concept of Reciprocity.
Philosophical work on reciprocity often pays considerable attention, directly or indirectly, to the proper interpretation of one or more of the following conceptual issues.
Reciprocity as distinct from related ideas. In Plato’s Crito, Socrates considers whether citizens might have a duty of gratitude to obey the laws of the state, in much the way they have duties of gratitude to their parents. Many other philosophers have considered similar questions. (See the references below to Sidgwick, English, and Jecker for modern examples.) This is certainly a legitimate question. Charging a child or a citizen with ingratitude can imply a failure to meet a requirement. But confining the discussion to gratitude is limiting. There are similar limitations in discussions of the do-unto-others golden rule, or ethical principles that are modeled on the mutuality and mutual benevolence that come out of the face-to-face relations envisaged by Emmanuel Levinas or the I-Thou relationships described by Martin Buber. Like gratitude, these other ideas have things in common with the norm of reciprocity, but are quite distinct from it.
Gratitude, in its ordinary sense, is as much about having warm and benevolent feelings toward one’s benefactors as it is about having obligations to them. Reciprocity, in its ordinary dictionary sense, is broader than that, and broader than all discussions that begin with a sense of mutuality and mutual benevolence. (See the reference below to Becker, "Reciprocity", and the bibliographic essays therein.) Reciprocity pointedly covers arm’s-length dealings between egoistic or mutually disinterested people.
Moreover, norms of gratitude do not speak very directly about what feelings and obligations are appropriate toward wrongdoers, or the malicious. Reciprocity, by contrast, speaks directly to both sides of the equation – requiring responses in kind: positive for positive, negative for negative. In this, it also differs from the golden rule, which is compatible with forgiveness and “turning the other cheek” but has notorious difficulties as a basis for corrective justice, punishment, and dealing with people (e.g., masochists) who have unusual motivational structures.
Finally, the idea of enforcing, or carrying out a duty of gratitude, as well as calibrating the extent one’s gratitude, seems inconsistent with the warm and benevolent feelings of “being grateful.” There is a similar inconsistency in the idea of enforcing a duty to love. Reciprocity, by contrast, because it does not necessarily involve having special feelings of love or benevolence, fits more comfortably into discussions of duties and obligations. Further, its requirement of an in-kind response invites us to calibrate both the quality and the quantity of the response. 
The norm of reciprocity thus requires that we make fitting and proportional responses to both the benefits and harms we receive – whether they come from people who have been benevolent or malicious. Working out the conceptual details of this idea presents interesting questions of its own. The following matters are all considered at length in many of the sources listed below under References, and those authors typically defend particular proposals about how best to define the conceptual details of reciprocity. What follows here is simply an outline of the topics that are under philosophical scrutiny.
Qualitative similarity. What counts as making a qualitatively appropriate or “fitting” response in various settings—positive for positive, negative for negative? If one person invites another to dinner, must the other offer a dinner in return? How soon? Must it be directly to the original benefactor, or will providing a comparable favor to someone else be appropriate? If the dinner one receives is unintentionally awful, must one reciprocate with something similarly awful? Sometimes an immediate tit-for-tat response seems inappropriate, and at other times it is the only thing that will do.
Are there general principles for assessing the qualitative appropriateness of reciprocal responses? Reflective people typically practice a highly nuanced version of the norm of reciprocity for social life, in which the qualitative similarity or fittingness of the response appears to be determined by a number of factors.
"The nature of the transaction". One is the general nature of the transaction or relationship between the parties – the rules and expectations involved in a particular interaction itself. Tit for tat, defined in a literal way as an exchange of the identical kinds of goods (client list for client list, referral for referral) may be the only sort of reciprocal response that is appropriate in a clearly defined business situation. Similarly, dinner-for-dinner may be the expectation among members of a round robin dinner club. But when the nature of the transaction is more loosely defined, or is embedded in a complex personal relationship, an appropriate reciprocal response often requires spontaneity, imagination, and even a lack of premeditation about where, what, and how soon.
"Fitting the response to the recipient". Another aspect of qualitative fit is what counts subjectively, for the recipient, as a response in-kind. When we respond to people who have benefited us, it seems perverse to give them things they do not regard as benefits. The general principle here is that, other things equal, a return of good for good received will require giving something that will actually be appreciated as good by the recipient – at least eventually. Similarly for the negative side. When we respond to bad things, reciprocity presumably requires a return that the recipient regards as a bad thing.
"Unusual circumstances". A third aspect of qualitative fit is the presence or absence of circumstances that undermine the usual expectations about reciprocity. If a pair of friends often borrow each other’s household tools, and one of them (suddenly deranged with anger) asks to borrow an antique sword from the other’s collection, what is a fitting response? The example, in a slightly different form, goes back to Plato. The point is that in this unusual circumstance, reciprocity (as well as other considerations) may require that the recipient not get what he wants at the moment. Rather, it may be that the recipient should be given what he needs, in some objective sense, whether he ever comes to appreciate that it is good for him.
"General rationale". A final determinant of qualitative fit is the general rationale for having the norm of reciprocity in the first place. For example, if the ultimate point of practicing reciprocity is to produce stable, productive, fair, and reliable social interactions, then there may be some tensions between things that accomplish this general goal and things that satisfy only the other three determinants. Responding to others’ harmful conduct raises this issue. As Plato observed (Republic, Book I), is not rational to harm our enemies in the sense of making them worse, as enemies or as people, than they already are. We may reply to Plato by insisting that reciprocity merely requires us to make them worse-off, not worse, period. But if it turns out that the version of the reciprocity norm we are using actually has the consequence of doing both, or at any rate not improving the situation, then we will have undermined the point of having it.
"Quantitative similarity". Another definitional issue concerns proportionality. What counts as too little, or too much in return for what we receive from others? In some cases, such as borrowing a sum of money from a friend who has roughly the same resources, a prompt and exact return of the same amount seems right. Less will be too little, and a return with interest will often be too much, between friends. But in other cases, especially in exchanges between people who are very unequal in resources, a literal reading of tit-for-tat may be a perverse rule – one that undermines the social and personal benefits of the norm of reciprocity itself. How, for example, may badly disadvantaged people reciprocate for the public or private assistance they receive? Requiring a prompt and exact return of the benefit received may defeat the general purpose of the norm of reciprocity by driving disadvantaged people further into debt. Yet to waive the debt altogether, or to require only some discounted amount seems to defeat the purpose also.
Anglo-American legal theory and practice has examples of two options for dealing with this problem. One is to require a return that is equal to the benefit received, but to limit the use of that requirement in special cases. Bankruptcy rules are in part designed to prevent downward, irrecoverable spirals of debt while still exacting a considerable penalty. Similarly, there are rules for rescinding unconscionable contracts, preventing unjust enrichment, and dealing with cases in which contractual obligations have become impossible to perform. These rules typically have considerable transaction costs.
Another kind of option is to define a reciprocal return with explicit reference to ability to pay. Progressive tax rates are an example of this. Considered in terms of reciprocity, this option seems based on an equal sacrifice interpretation of proportionality, rather than an equal benefit one. Under an equal sacrifice rule, making a quantitatively similar return will mean giving something back whose marginal value to oneself, given one’s resources, equals the marginal value of the sacrifice made by the original giver, given her resources.
Reciprocity and Justice.
Standard usage of the term justice shows its close general connection to the concept of reciprocity. Justice includes the idea of fairness, and that in turn includes treating similar cases similarly, giving people what they deserve, and apportioning all other benefits and burdens in an equitable way. Those things, further, involve acting in a principled, impartial way that forbids playing favorites and may require sacrifices. All of those things are certainly in the neighborhood of the elements of reciprocity (e.g., fittingness, proportionality), but it is challenging to explain the precise connections.
Reward and punishment.
Discussions of merit, desert, blame, and punishment inevitably involve questions about the fittingness and proportionality of our responses to others, and retributive theories of punishment put the norm of reciprocity at their center. The idea is to make the punishment fit the crime. This differs from utilitarian theories of punishment, which may use fittingness and proportionality as constraints, but whose ultimate commitment is to make punishment serve social goals such as general deterrence, public safety, and the rehabilitation of wrongdoers.
Justice and war.
In just war theory, notions of fittingness and proportionality are central, at least as constraints both on the justification of a given war, and the methods used to prosecute it. When war represents a disproportionate response to a threat or an injury, it raises questions of justice related to reciprocity. When war fighting employs weapons that do not discriminate between combatants and noncombatants, it raises questions of justice related to reciprocity. A profound sense of injustice related to a lack of reciprocity – for example, between those privileged by socioeconomic status, political power, or wealth, and those who are less privileged, and oppressed – sometimes leads to war in the form of revolutionary or counterrevolutionary violence. Political solutions which end the violence without dealing with the underlying injustice run the risk of continued social instability.
Legitimation of social, political, and legal obligations.
A very deep and persistent line of philosophical discussion explores the way in which reciprocity can resolve conflicts between justice and self-interest, and can justify the imposition (or limitation) of social, political, and legal obligations that require individuals to sacrifice their own interests.
This aspect of the philosophical discussion of reciprocity attempts to bring together two ways of approaching a very basic question: What is the fundamental justification for the existence of social and political institutions – institutions that impose and enforce duties and obligations upon their members?
Individual well-being. One obvious answer is that people need to stay out of each other’s way enough so that each can pursue his or her individual interests as far as possible, without interference from others. This immediately justifies rules that are mutually advantageous, but it raises questions about requiring obedience from people whenever it turns out that they will be disadvantaged by following the rules, or can get away with disobeying them. So the problem becomes one of showing whether, and when, it might actually be mutually advantageous to follow the rules of justice even when it is inconvenient or costly to do so.
Social contract theorists often invoke the value of reciprocal relationships to deal with this. All human beings need help from one another from time to time in order to pursue their individual interests effectively. So if we can arrange a system of reciprocity in which all the benefits we are required to contribute are typically returned to us in full (or more), that may justify playing by the rules—even in cases where it looks as though we can get away with not doing so.
Social well-being. Another obvious answer to the question of why people organize themselves into groups, however, is in order to achieve levels of cooperation needed for improving society generally – for example by improving public health, and society-wide levels of education, wealth, or individual welfare. This also gives a reason for rules of justice, but again raises problems about requiring individuals to sacrifice their own welfare for the good of others—especially when some individuals might not share the particular goals for social improvements at issue.
Here too, the value of reciprocal relationships can be invoked, this time to limit the legitimacy of the sacrifices a society might require. For one thing, it seems perverse to require sacrifices in pursuit of some social goal if it turns out those sacrifices are unnecessary, or in vain because the goal cannot be achieved.
To some philosophers, a theory of justice based on reciprocity (or fairness, or fair play) is an attractive middle ground between a thoroughgoing concern with individual well-being and a thoroughgoing concern with social well-being. This has been part of the attraction of the most influential line of thought on distributive justice in recent Anglo-American philosophy – the one carried on in the context of John Rawls’ work.
Future generations. It may also be that there is something to be gained, philosophically, from considering what obligations of generalized reciprocity present generations of human beings may have to future ones. Rawls considers (briefly) the problem of defining a “just savings principle” for future generations, and treats it as a consequence of the interests people typically have in the welfare of their descendents, and the agreements fully reciprocal members of society would come to among themselves about such matters. Others (e.g., Lawrence Becker) have explored the intuitive idea that acting on behalf of future generations may be required as a generalized form of reciprocity for benefits received from previous generations.
Mutuality.
What is the relation between reciprocity and love, friendship or family relationships? If such relationships are ideally ones in which the parties are connected by mutual affection and benevolence, shouldn’t justice and reciprocity stay out of their way? Isn’t impartiality inconsistent with love? Doesn’t acting on principle take the affection out of friendship or family relationships? Doesn’t following the norm of reciprocity eliminate unconditional love or loyalty?
Some contemporary philosophers have criticized major figures in the history of Western philosophy, including John Rawls’ early work, for making familial relationships more or less opaque in theories of justice. (See the reference below to Okin.) The argument is that families can be grossly unjust, and have often been so. Since the family is “the school of justice,” if it is unjust the moral education of children is distorted, and the injustice tends to spread to the society at large, and to be perpetuated in following generations. If that is right, then justice and reciprocity must define the boundaries within which we pursue even the most intimate relationships.
A somewhat different thread on these matters begins with Aristotle’s discussion of friendship, in "Nicomachean Ethics" 1155-1172a. He proposes that the highest or best form of friendship involves a relationship between equals – one in which a genuinely reciprocal relationship is possible. This thread appears throughout the history of Western ethics in discussions of personal and social relationships of many sorts: between children and parents, spouses, humans and other animals, and humans and god(s). The question is the extent to which the kind of reciprocity possible in various relationships determines the kind of mutual affection and benevolence possible in those relationships.
This said, reciprocation in personal relationships rarely follows a mathematical formula and the level of reciprocation, i.e. the give and take, will vary depending on the personalities involved, and situational factors such as which party has more control, persuasive power or influence. It is often the case that one party will typically be the lead reciprocator with the other being the responsive reciprocator. The form of reciprocation can also be influenced by the level of emotional need. Sometimes one party will need more support than the other and this can switch at different times depending on the life situation of each party. Because reciprocation is influenced by personal circumstances and since people do not follow a set pattern like robots, reciprocation from a friend to a friend for example will vary in intensity and an absolutely consistent pattern cannot be expected. If for example a person has a large inner circle of friendships with reciprocation as the key element of friendship, then the level of reciprocation within the inner circle will influence the depth of a friendship therein. Reciprocation can be responsive or initiative. It is also a fundamental principle in parenting, a successful work place, religion and karma.
So for example, in the friendship context, reciprocation means to give or take mutually but not necessarily equally. Overall reciprocal balance is more important than strict equality at every moment. Friendship based on reciprocity means caring for each other, being responsive and supportive and in tune with each other. But without some form of overall reciprocal balance, the relationship may become transformed into a nonreciprocal form of friendship, or the friendship may fail altogether.

Quinton catheter

Quinton catheters are non-tunneled central catheters, which are often used for temporary access for dialysis or infusion of medicine when peripheral IV access is not possible (e.g. small vessel caliber, extensive burn injuries). They can also be used to infuse liquids which cause peripheral blood vessel irritation, directly into the vena cavae where they are immediately diluted.

Predictably Irrational

Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions is a 2008 book by Dan Ariely, in which he challenges readers' assumptions about making decisions based on rational thought. Ariely explains, "My goal, by the end of this book, is to help you fundamentally rethink what makes you and the people around you tick. I hope to lead you there by presenting a wide range of scientific experiments, findings, and anecdotes that are in many cases quite amusing. Once you see how systematic certain mistakes are--how we repeat them again and again--I think you will begin to learn how to avoid some of them".
Chapter summary.
Ariely discusses many modes of thinking and situations that may skew the traditional rational choice theory. There are 15 chapters in total, and the following outline the main points.
The Truth about Relativity.
In chapter 1, Ariely describes the ways in which people frequently regard their environment in terms of their relation to others; it is the way that the human brain is wired. People not only compare things, but also compare things that are easily comparable. For example, if given the following options for a honeymoon - Paris (with free breakfast), Rome (with free breakfast), and Rome (no breakfast included), most people would probably choose Rome with the free breakfast. The rationale is that it is easier to compare the two options for Rome than it is to compare Paris and Rome. Ariely also explains the role of the decoy effect (or asymmetric dominance effect) in the decision process. The decoy effect is the phenomenon whereby consumers will tend to have a specific change in preference between two options when also presented with a third option that is asymmetrically dominated. This effect is the "secret agent" in many decisions. In the example with the honeymoon options, Rome without free breakfast is the decoy. (It makes Rome with breakfast look superior to Rome without breakfast. Comparing Rome and Paris is difficult, so the easy comparison of Rome makes it more likely to choose Rome over Paris.) It makes Paris look inferior when compared to Rome with the free breakfast. Relativity helps people make decisions but it can also make them miserable. People compare their lives to those of others, leading to jealousy and envy. Ariely finishes the chapter by saying “the more we have, the more we want” and his suggested cure is to break the cycle of relativity. To break the cycle, people can control what goes on around them. The focus on smaller "circles" can boost relative happiness, as can changing this focus from narrow to broad. When considering upgrading a phone, the consumer could think about what else they could buy with the money they would spend on the upgrade.
The Fallacy of Supply and Demand.
In chapter 2, consumers purchase items based on value, quality or availability – often on all three. The methods of appointing a value to an object with no previous value, like the Tahitian black pearl, is susceptible to irrational pricing. A value can be as easily (arbitrarily) assigned as by having a fancy ad with “equally” precious items and a high price tag in a window of a store on Fifth Avenue. When consumers buy a product at a certain price, they become "anchored" to that price, i.e. they associate the initial price with the same product over a period of time. An anchor price of a certain object, say a plasma television, will affect the way they perceive the value of all plasma televisions hence forth. Other prices will seem low or high in relation to the original anchor. In other words, decisions about future LCD television purchases become coherent after an initial price has been established in the consumer's mind. A person's self value for services rendered can also be affected by anchor prices; one can irrationally price his/her abilities or services based on an anchor price proposed. Using the concepts of anchor price and arbitrary coherence, Ariely challenges the theory of supply and demand. He states that demand, the determinant of market prices, can be easily manipulated. Furthermore, supply and demand are dependent on each other (manufacturer's suggested retail prices affect consumers' willingness to pay). Finally, the author claims that the relationships between supply and demand are based on memory rather than on preferences.
The Cost of Zero Cost.
In chapter 3, Ariely explains how humans react to the words "free" and "zero". Humans make decisions without rationalizing the outcomes of their choices. To illustrate this point, Ariely conducted multiple experiments. The outcome was consistent: when faced with multiple choices, the free option was commonly chosen. With the opportunity to receive something for free, the actual value of the product or service is no longer considered. Ariely claims, “Most transactions have an upside and a downside, but when something is FREE! we forget the downside. FREE! gives us such an emotional charge that we perceive what is being offered as immensely more valuable than it really is.” 
Ariely's concept of "FREE!" applies not only to monetary and quantitative costs, but also to time. We forgo some of our time when we wait in line for free popcorn or to enter a museum on a free-entrance day. We could have been doing something else at that time. Ultimately, he demonstrates how such a simple concept can be used to drive business and social policy. For example, to reduce health cost, companies could offer free regular checks. Employees would be more willing to get them at zero cost rather than paying some amount of money. Ariely recommends the consideration of the net benefits of the choices we make regarding both preference and money. Perhaps we would get the better deal and even save money if we did not react to free the way we do.
Being Paid vs. A Friendly Favor.
In chapters 4 and 5, Ariely speaks in great detail of the differences between social norms—which include friendly requests with instant payback not being required—and market norms—which account for wages, prices, rents, cost benefits, and repayment being essential. 
He also explains how combining the two can create troubling situations. The author proves that people are happy to do things occasionally when they are not paid for them. In fact there are some situations in which work output is negatively affected by payment of small amounts of money. Tests showed that work done as a “favor” sometimes produced much better results than work paid for. 
For example, some lawyers were asked by AARP to provide needy retirees with services at a cost of about $30. The lawyers did not accept the offer. However, when asked to offer services at no cost, they agreed. Experiments also showed that offering a small gift would not offend anybody (the gift falls into social norms), but mentioning the monetary value of the gifts invokes market norms. 
Ariely talks about how social norms are making their way into the market norms. To illustrate, State Farm's slogan, “Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there,” proves that companies are trying to connect with people on a social level in order to gain trust and allow the customer to overlook minor infractions. The author concludes that "money, as it turns out, is the most expensive way to motivate people. Social norms are not only cheaper, but often more effective as well."
Emotion in Decision Making.
In chapter 6, Ariely collaborated with close friend George Loewenstein, a professor of economics and psychology at Carnegie Mellon University, to test the influence of arousal on decision making in high-emotion situations. Ariely and Loewenstein chose to test the effects of sexual arousal on decision-making in college-aged men at University of California, Berkeley. By using computers to stimulate sexual arousal, they determined that in a stimulated state, the young men were more likely to undergo an action that they would not normally consider. Using the data, Ariely argues that other high-emotion situations such as anger, frustration, and hunger have the potential to trigger similar effects on decision-making. In such situations our behavior is fully controlled by emotions. We are not the people we thought we were. No matter how much experience we have we make irrational decisions every time we are under the influence of arousal. Furthermore, he presents ideas to improve our decision-making abilities in other emotion-provoking situations such as safe sex, safe driving, and making other life decisions. For example, Ariely proposes an OnStar system that could potentially lower the number of car accidents in teenagers by performing tasks such as changing the car’s temperature or dialing the teenager’s mother when the car exceeds a set speed.
The Problem of Procrastination and Self-control.
In chapter 7, over the last decade Americans have shown surprisingly little self-control. Ariely blames this lack of self-control on people's two states in which they make their judgments—cool state and hot state. In our cool state we make rational long-term decisions, whereas in our hot state we give in to immediate gratification and put off our decisions made in the cool state. 
Ariely describes putting off these goals for immediate gratification as procrastination. With proper motivators such as deadlines and penalties, people are more willing to meet deadlines or long-term goals. The author states that based on his experience with his students, deadlines set by authority figures such as teachers and supervisors make us start working on a specific task earlier. If we set the deadlines ourselves, we might not perform well. Moreover, we will not start making any progress towards the completion of the task until the deadline approaches. 
Ariely also applies his theories to other aspects in life such as health care and savings. Having to pay a deposit at the doctor's office would make people more likely not to procrastinate and show up for their appointments. He goes on to say that if more consequences were put into effect, people would be more likely to meet their goals, appointments, deadlines, etc. made in a cool state. Ariely also elaborates on his idea of self-control credit cards. When applying for such a card, users can decide how much they can spend in each category and what would happen when they exceed their limit.
The High Price of Ownership.
In chapter 8, Ariely discusses how we overvalue what we have, and why we make irrational decisions about ownership. The idea of ownership makes us perceive the value of an object to be much higher if we own the object. This illustrates the phenomenon of the endowment effect -- placing a higher value on property once possession has been assigned. The author begins the chapter by using an example of how a lottery for highly sought-after Duke University basketball tickets inflates students’ sense of value for the tickets. Students who actually received the tickets valued them ten times more than the students who did not receive them. 
Ariely gives three reasons why we do not always think rationally when it comes to our possessions:
Ariely also lists the "peculiarities" of ownership as he calls them. One of them is that the harder we work on something, the more we start feeling about them as our own. Take assembling a piece of furniture as an example. Another peculiarity is that sometimes, the sense of ownership comes before the actual ownership, e.g. online auctions. To avoid the endowment effect, Ariely suggests that we create a barrier between ourselves and the material things we are tempted by daily.
The Effect of Expectations.
In chapter 9, Ariely and several colleagues conducted a series of experiments to determine whether previous knowledge can change an actual sensory experience. One of the experiments was conducted in the Muddy Charles, one of the MIT's pubs. Students visiting the pub tasted two types of beer -- Budweiser and the MIT Brew (which contains balsamic vinegar). 
In the “blind test” the majority preferred the altered brew, but when they were told in advance that it was vinegar-laced, they chose the original Budweiser. Another group of students was made aware of the vinegar content immediately after tasting both kinds of drinks. However, they still reported that they preferred it, proving that knowledge after the experience does not affect our sensory perceptions. 
Ariely also states that expectations shape stereotypes. Stereotypes provide us with knowledge before the actual experience and thus influence our perceptions. The author describes an experiment in which an objective math exam was administered to two groups of Asian-American women. Before taking the test, the women from the first group were asked questions regarding gender-related issues, whereas the second group had to answer questions about race-related issues. The second group did better than the first one and met the expectation that Asians are good at math. 
Ariely concludes, “Expectations can influence nearly every aspect in one’s life.” He presents an argument that expectations can override our senses, partially blinding us from the truth.
The Power of Price.
In chapter 10, Ariely started out with a medical procedure called internal mammary artery ligation for chest pain. The interesting twist is when a cardiologist decided to test the efficacy of this procedure by performing a placebo procedure. The result showed that the placebo is equally effective, thereby disputing the effectiveness of the original surgery. This example is one of many that illustrate the power of placebo in medical science.
While the effect of placebo has been knowingly and unknowingly practiced for millennia, the interesting observation Ariely and his collaborators made was that prices of the prescribed medicine can be used as a placebo as well. This chapter ended with a complex and moral question as to whether or not the placebo effect in medicine should be studied more closely or even eliminated systematically.
Reception.
In a "New York Times" review, David Berreby said ""Predictably Irrational" is a far more revolutionary book than its unthreatening manner lets on. It’s a concise summary of why today’s social science increasingly treats the markets-know-best model as a fairy tale."

List of Cleveland Indians managers

The Cleveland Indians are a professional baseball franchise based in Cleveland, Ohio that formed in 1901. They are members of the Central division of Major League Baseball's American League. 
The Indians have had 42 managers in their history. Jimmy McAleer became the first manager of the then Cleveland Blues in 1901, serving for one season. In 1901, McAleer was replaced with Bill Armour. The Indians made their first playoff appearance under Tris Speaker in 1920. Out of the six managers that have led the Indians into the postseason, only Speaker and Lou Boudreau have led the Indians to World Series championships, doing so in 1920 and 1948, respectively. Al Lopez lost the 1954 World Series in four games to the New York Giants. Mike Hargrove lost the 1995 World Series and 1997 World Series with the Indians. The highest winning percentage of any manager who managed at least one season was Lopez, with a percentage of .617. The lowest percentage was Johnny Lipon's .305 in 1971, although he managed for only 59 games. The lowest percentage of a manager with at least one season with the Indians was McAleer's .397 in 1901.
Armour became the first manager who held the title of manager for the Indians for more than one season. Boudreau has managed more games (1383) than any other Indians manager, closely followed by Hargrove (1364).. Charlie Manuel, Eric Wedge, Speaker, Boudreau, Lopez, and Hargrove are the only managers to have led the Indians into the playoffs. Speaker, Boudreau, Lopez, Walter Johnson, Joe Gordon, Nap Lajoie and Frank Robinson are the seven members of the Baseball Hall of Fame who are also former managers of this club. Of those seven, Lopez is the only one inducted as a manager. 
The highest win–loss total for an Indians manager is held by Boudreau, with 728 wins and 649 losses. Wedge became the first Indians manager to win the Manager of the Year award, in 2007. The current manager of the Indians is Terry Francona, who replaced Manny Acta after the end of the 2012 season.

Precision engineering

Precision engineering is a subdiscipline of electrical engineering, software engineering, electronics engineering, mechanical engineering, and optical engineering concerned with designing machines, fixtures, and other structures that have exceptionally low tolerances, are repeatable, and are stable over time. These approaches have applications in machine tools, MEMS, NEMS, optoelectronics design, and many other fields. 
Overview.
One of the fundamental principles in precision engineering is that of determinism. System behavior is fully predictable even to nanometer-scale motions.
"The basic idea is that machine tools obey cause and effect relationships that are within our ability to understand and control and that there is nothing random or probabilistic about their behavior. Everything happens for a reason and the list of reasons is small enough to manage." - Jim Bryan
"By this we mean that machine tool errors obey cause-and-effect relationships, and do not vary randomly for no reason. Further, the causes are not esoteric and uncontrollable, but can be explained in terms of familiar engineering principles." - Bob Donaldson
Professors Hiromu Nakazawa and Pat McKeown provide the following list of goals for precision engineering:

Biography.
Ron Fagin was born and grew up in Oklahoma City, where he attended Northwest Classen High School. Following that, he completed his undergraduate degree at Dartmouth College. Fagin received his Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1973, where he worked under the supervision of Robert Vaught. 
He joined the IBM Research Division in 1973, spending two years at the Thomas J. Watson Research Center, and then transferred in 1975 to what is now the IBM Almaden Research Center in San Jose, California.
He has served as program committee chair for ACM Symposium on Principles of Database Systems 1984, Theoretical Aspects of Reasoning about Knowledge 1994, ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing 2005, and the International Conference on Database Theory 2009.
Fagin has received numerous professional awards for his work. He was elected Member of the National Academy of Engineering, IBM Fellow, ACM Fellow, IEEE Fellow, and AAAS Fellow. He received a Docteur Honoris Causa from the University of Paris. The IEEE granted him the IEEE W. Wallace McDowell Award and the IEEE Technical Achievement Award; the ACM the ACM SIGMOD Edgar F. Codd Innovations Award and IBM Eight IBM Outstanding Innovation Awards, Two IBM supplemental Patent Issue Awards, given for key IBM patents, the IBM Outstanding Technical Achievement Award, and the IBM Corporate Award. Fagin is listed among the "Highly Cited Researchers." He won Best Paper awards at the 1985 International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, the 2001 ACM Symposium on Principles of Database Systems, and the 2010 International Conference on Database Theory. He won 10-year Test-of-Time Awards at the 2011 ACM Symposium on Principles of Database Systems and the 2013 International Conference on Database Theory. 
Work.
Fagin's theorem.
Fagin's theorem, which he proved in his PhD thesis, states that existential second-order logic coincides with the complexity class NP in the sense that a decision problem can be expressed in existential second-order logic if and only if it can be solved by a nondeterministic Turing machine in polynomial time. This work was seminal to the area of finite model theory. 
Other contributions.
Another famous result that he proved is that first-order logic has a zero-one law, a tool for proving inexpressibility results for database query languages. This result was proven independently by Glebskiĭ et al. slightly earlier in Russia.
He is also known for his work on higher Normal Forms in Database Theory, particularly 4NF.
Publications.
Fagin has authored and co-authored many publications in his fields of expertise. Books, a selection:

Cold in the Earth

Cold in the Earth (1992) is Ann Granger's third "Mitchell and Markby Mystery". Set in rural England, it is about three seemingly unconnected deaths which occur in quick succession in the fictitious town of Bamford in the Cotswolds. Chief Inspector Alan Markby and his team are unofficially joined in their investigations by Meredith Mitchell—who is introduced in "Say It with Poison"—, who leaves her London job to spend Holy Week in the country.
Plot summary.
The first death is from a drug overdose; the victim is a promising young girl from a respectable local family. However, Markby's investigations, which aim at getting hold of the suppliers, do not lead anywhere. Shortly afterwards, the body of a stranger, possibly a foreigner, is found buried in a shallow grave in a trench at a building site on the outskirts of Bamford. Finally, a local construction foreman employed at that very building site is slain to death on a lonely country road.
Mitchell and Markby probe into the dubious roles played by land developers, diehard farmers and juvenile delinquents alike.

Radius of curvature (mathematics)

In geometry, the radius of curvature, "R", of a curve at a point is a measure of the radius of the circular arc which best approximates the curve at that point. It is the inverse of the curvature.
In the case of a space curve, the radius of curvature is the length of the curvature vector.
In the case of a plane curve, then "R" is the absolute value of 
where "s" is the arc length from a fixed point on the curve, "φ" is the tangential angle and formula_2 is the curvature.

Ein Beit al-Ma'

'Ein Beit el Ma (Arabic: ), also known as Camp No. 1 (), is a Palestinian refugee camp established in the northern West Bank in 1950, adjacent to the city of Nablus. According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), 'Ein Beit el Ma Camp had a population of approximately 5,036 inhabitants in mid-year 2006. It currently houses 6,683 registered Palestinian refugees.
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) supports two schools built with funds from the Saudi Arabia and Swedish Governments in 1997, close to the 'Ein Beit el Ma camp, on land donated by the Nablus municipality. The schools have approximately 1,268 pupils.
'Ein Beit el Ma, (No.1) Refugee Camp, west of Nablus city was established in 1950 on 45 dunums beside the main Nablus/Jenin road, and within the municipal boundaries of Nablus. Following the Israeli redeployment in 1995, the camp fell under Palestinian Authority control in "Area A". The camp is very cramped, there is serious overcrowding, and the narrow alleys are in desperate need of repair. During funerals, the deceased are usually passed through windows from one shelter to another in order to reach the camp's main street.
A serious outbreak of diarrhoea hospitalised several hundred camp residents in the summer of 1998. Contaminated municipal water supplies was the cause of the epidemic and UNRWA's health staff worked day and night to treat the sick and to take patients to clinics and hospitals in other parts of the West Bank. 
18 September 2007, Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and Border Police entered 'Ein Beit el Ma Refugee Camp. The entire camp population of approximately 5,000 people was placed under complete curfew for three days. The IDF entered the camp with the stated aim of disarming militant cells in the camp. After initial clashes between IDF troops and Palestinian militants inside the camp, the IDF began house-to-house search and an arrest campaign.
Over the course of the three days there were two Palestinian fatalities and 25 injuries reported, including two children and one woman. In addition, one IDF soldier was killed and five were injured including 4 soldiers who were injured when a tear gas canister exploded prematurely inside their armoured vehicle.

Savaria Mithraeum was the shrine of Mithras in the Roman town of Savaria (now Szombathely, Hungary) which was discovered in 2008.
History.
The cult of Mithras was popular in the Roman province of Pannonia. Archeological evidences proved its presence in Aquincum, Fertőrákos and Sárkeszi but its popularity in Savaria, the capital of Pannonia Prima was only proved in 2008 when a mithraeum was unearthed in the vicinity of the most important surviving Roman monument of the town, the shrine of Isis. 
The Savaria Mithraeum was used until the 4th century when it was burned down and collapsed. The mithraeum was discovered during the building works of a new shopping center in 2008. The remains were excavated by local archeologists who claimed that the discovery is of European importance. The ruins will be preserved in the basement of the new plaza. Many other finds were unearthed in the area like an intact Roman cellar and a 3 m wide, stone waterdrain that was repaired in the 19th century.
Remains.
Two stone altars were uncovered which were decorated with scenes from the life of Mithras in reliefs and had dedicative inscriptions. The inner room and the narthex of the shrine was decorated with wall paintings. The frescoes are being restored by experts from the collected fragments. Their design were geometric with some figurative scenes. The ceiling was coffered. The ancient painters used expensive pigments like Egyptian Blue and vermilion. There were stone benches along the walls in the inner room.

"Prayin' for Daylight" is the title of the debut single written by Steve Bogard and Rick Giles, and recorded by American country music group Rascal Flatts. It was released in February 2000 as the lead-off single from the band's self-titled debut album. It peaked at #3 on the U.S. "Billboard" Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) chart.
Content.
The song is a moderate up-tempo song in which the narrator's lover has just left him, and he has not been able to sleep.
Background.
On the band's website, Jay DeMarcus commented on the recording of "Prayin' For Daylight".
"The first single. That was the first tune we ever cut as a group, and the first song that Lyric Street ever heard us do. It was very, very instrumental in getting our deal. We love the song. It's a very memorable kind of chorus and it just showcases what we can do as well as the band. I think if somebody said tell us what you're all about, we could play that song and they'd get a pretty good picture of what we can do. "Prayin' For Daylight" was special because at the last minute we changed the feel of the whole song. The demo was really, really different and what's become the little, hooky guitar riff, that happened moments before we went to tape."
Chart performance.
"Prayin' for Daylight" debuted at number 60 on the U.S. "Billboard" Hot Country Singles & Tracks for the week of March 4, 2000. The song spent thirty-one weeks on the U.S. "Billboard" Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart, reaching a peak of number 3.

Serbs of Toronto

The Serbs of Toronto (Serbian language: Срби у Торонту, "Srbi u Torontu") are a minority. Abroad, Toronto is said to be home to the 3rd largest Serb diaspora population after Vienna and Chicago.
Demographics.
The 2006 census showed that the total of single and multiple ethnic origin responses for Serbian was 25,160. Single ethnic origin responses was 17,265 while multiple ethnic origin responses was 7,890.[http://www.statcan.ca] The total of single and multiple ethnic origin responses for Yugoslav was 12,685. Single ethnic origin responses was 4,950 while multiple ethnic origin responses was 7,725.
Toronto Population by Language in 2001 showed 13,635 Serbians.[http://anton.panchishin.com/docs/toronto_demographics.xls]
History.
One of the first Serbian immigrants in Toronto was Sremac Herceg. He arrived in August 1903.A great number of Serbian settlers that came in 1912 were from Niš region. In between Balkan Wars and World War I, more than two hundred Serbs lived in Toronto.[http://sabornik.com/index.php?lang=en&ldd=history
Culture.
In 1954 the Serb Youth Club in Toronto was formed, and its folk-dance group Stražilovo became one of the first highly successful dance groups in Canada.
Toronto’s folk-dance group Hajduk Veljko (founded in 1964) danced at the Montreal Olympics in 1976 and at Expo ’86 in Vancouver, and Toronto’s Oplenac (1973).
From the early 1950s to 1984 the Serbian Cultural Club St Sava was active in Toronto, publishing eight volumes in Serbian dealing with Serb history.
In 1968 the Serbian Orthodox Church of St Michael the Archangel hosted the "Belgrade" pavilion of the Toronto Caravan cultural festival, organized by the late Colette Sekulovich (née Leroy) which displayed many Serbian cultural artifacts, showcased Kolo dancing and other performance arts and gave the people of Toronto a chance to taste Serbian delicacies. The annual festival ran for over 30 years winning, in 2001, the Zena Kossar "Best Pavilion Award".
The Serbian Heritage Academy (SHA), formed in Toronto in 1981, has organized academic conferences, exhibits, and lectures. In 1984 it installed a bronze plaque at the University of Toronto’s Medical Sciences Building honouring Canadian doctors and nurses who had worked as volunteers in Serbia during World War I.
Serbian Cultural Association Oplenac was founded in 1987 in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. Serbian folk dancing has been a major activity in SCA Oplenac since its inception as a non-profit organization. All proceeds from the events organized by SCA Oplenac go to the preservation and presentation of Serbian culture and tradition in North America. In 2012 it reached the company consisting of 8 large ensembles, Choir and Orchestra as well as a large recreational ensemble. They established Drama school for children that performs theatre plays on Serbian language as well as Serbian language school. Since 2000 it was clear that the association is undoubtedly the biggest Serbian folklore group in North America http://www.oplenac.ca
The first Serb bookstore, Srbica Books, was opened in Toronto in 1990 by Živko Apić.
Established in 2008, Toronto's Pulse Theatre (or Пулс Театар) is the biggest drama club and theatre for children in Serbian Language in Canada. http://www.pulsteatar.com

"It's Nothing" is the third and final single from "Milk Me", a 2004 album by East Coast hip hop group The Beatnuts. It was released by Penalty Recordings as a 12 inch with "Confused Rappers" as its b-side. The song is produced by The Beatnuts and features rapped verses by Juju, Psycho Les and guest rapper A.G., as well as a chorus performed by Gab Goblin. The song is lyrically composed of braggadocios metaphors and punchlines. The song's beat is characterized by a flute sample and quick drums giving it a "futuristic funk" sound. The song also features live instrumentation provided by keyboardist Neal Evans.
Although "It's Nothing" failed to chart or receive an accompanying music video, it elicited positive critical attention: Tom Doggett of RapReviews.com considers it comparable to The Beatnuts' 1997 hit single "Off the Books" because of its flute sample. Robert DeGracia of AllHipHop.com claims that "It's Nothing" proves the great prowess of Beatnuts production, whilst complementing guest rapper A.G..

San Antonio Film Festival

The SAFILM - San Antonio Film Festival was founded in 1994 by Adam Rocha as a video festival, which sported a logo of a naughty-looking angel. It was later renamed the San Antonio Underground Film Festival and then finally the SAFILM – San Antonio Film Festival. The non-profit festival is held annually in June at the Instituto Cultural de Mexico en San Antonio in Hemisfair Park and theaters throughout the city. The festival showcases independent narrative, animated, documentary and experimental shorts or features.
The mission of the film festival is to serve as an accessible and inclusive platform for artists in the category of cinema and to provide cinematic culture to a diverse audience. The SAFILM - San Antonio Film Festival showcases films from around the world in its role of nurturing, fostering, and developing filmmakers of all ages.
The 18th annual SAFILM – San Antonio Film Festival was held June 18–24, 2012 with more than 130 films and included film workshops and discussions with filmmakers and actors.
The 19th annual festival will be held June 19-23, 2013.
History.
The San Antonio Film Festival has been a cultural support for the San Antonio community since 1994. SAFILM has worked with the director of the Instituto Cultural de México to provide the San Antonio community with cinematic culture and elevate arts appreciation. During the past 15 years, Adam Rocha, the founder and executive director of SAFILM, has transformed his non-profit organization from a small film screening to one of the largest film festivals in South Texas.
The SAFILM has grown in size and reputation through the years. After his sophomore year at San Antonio College, Adam Rocha was invited to screen his short film at the San Diego Latino Film Festival in California. The experience inspired him to organize his own film festival. In 1994, the first festival screened a dozen films and awarded low-rider bikes to the best picture.
That year, Fredrick Weiss, the founder of the Texas Music Coalition, encouraged Rocha to develop the festival into a more substantial event. Renamed “The San Antonio Underground Film Festival,” the small festival slowly expanded over the next five years into an event that attracted wider participation, larger audiences, and greater news coverage.
The nonprofit's mission statement still drives the organization: “to offer an accessible and inclusive platform for artists and to provide cinematic culture to a diverse audience,” while maintaining a sociable, community-centered atmosphere. For several years the historic Instituto Cultural de México, located in Hemisfair Plaza in downtown San Antonio, through Gabriela Franco has partnered with the festival to provide a venue. 
In 2006, the organization adopted its current name: SAFILM - San Antonio Film Festival. 
Today the San Antonio film festival showcases more than 100 films by professional, amateur, and high school filmmakers. During the festival, SAFILM conducts free public workshops to teach film technique, style, and content.
Throughout the year, SAFILM volunteers encourage students to appreciate the arts and become involved in film making by regularly visiting high schools to give guest lectures on career paths involving film, handling media exposure, and tips for successful networking. The festival itself helps students begin film careers, highlights outstanding filmmakers with a variety of awards, exposes rising talent, and reminds the public of the value of art.
Since its inception, the San Antonio Film Festival has also showcased local visual artists. Artists Mig Kokinda, James Cobb, Robert Tatum and Rigoberto Luna are among those submitting accepted designs for festival posters. The 2009 SAFILM Festival Poster created by Rigoberto Luna was selected as a finalist for the 39th annual Hollywood Reporter Key Art Awards for Theatrical Print - Festival Posters.
Awards.
As of 2011, the San Antonio Film Festival due to popular demand and evident success rates, decided to award more Audience Choice Awards instead of the traditional Jury Prizes. The Audience Choice Awards not only allow for large success for the filmmakers, but also allows for the audience to have a voice. This change in additional Audience Choice Awards makes the awarded films more attractive to distributors in the increasingly competitive film market.

1st Canadian Parachute Battalion

The 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion was formed in July 1942 during the Second World War; it served in North West Europe. Landing in Normandy on D Day, June 6, 1944 and in the airborne assault crossing of the River Rhine, Operation Varsity. After the end of hostilities in Europe, the Battalion was returned to Canada where it was disbanded on 30 September 1945.
By the end of the war the battalion had gained a remarkable reputation: they never failed to complete a mission, and they never gave up an objective once taken. They are the only Canadians to participate in the Battle of the Bulge and had advanced deeper than any other Canadian unit into enemy territory.
Early history.
Colonel E.L.M. Burns was the leading mind behind the creation of a Canadian parachute battalion and fought endlessly for its creation. The idea was denied several times because of its lack of relevance in regards to the home army. Burns’ attempted to suggest that the paratroopers would serve as a good way of transporting troops into obscure parts of Canada if a German attack were to occur. It was not until the German’s fallschimrjäger stunning accomplishments, and the creation of British and American parachute regiments that Canada’s military would grant Burns’ request.
On 1 July 1942 the Department of National Defence authorized the raising of the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion. The battalion had an authorised strength of 26 officers and 590 other ranks, formed into a battalion headquarters, three rifle companies and a headquarters company. Later in the year, volunteers were also requested for the recently formed 2nd Canadian Parachute Battalion, which formed the Canadian contingent of the 1st Special Service Force.
The initial training was carried out at Fort Benning in the United States and at RAF Ringway in England. Groups of recruits were dispatched to both countries with the intention of getting the best out of both training systems prior to the development of the Canadian Parachute Training Wing at CFB Shilo, Manitoba. The group that traveled to Fort Benning in the United States included the unit’s first Commanding Officer, Major H.D. Proctor who was killed in an accident when his parachute rigging lines were severed by a following aircraft. He was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel G.F.P. Bradbrooke who led the battalion until the end of operations in Normandy on 14 June 1944.
Recruitment and Training.
Due to very high standards and an alarming dropout rate, the members of the Battalion were the elite of Canadian Soldiers.
The screening process for possible candidates was extreme and further grading systems were put into place to ensure that the finest were kept.
A – Outstanding
B – Superior
C – Average
D – Inferior but acceptable
E – Rejected
Only men who fell under the "A" category were kept for airborne training. That was 20% of the original volunteers.
The training was separated into 4 separate stages labelled “A”, “B”, “C”, and “D”.
“A” stage consisted of a series of gruelling exercises including Jiu-Jitsu and other hand to hand combat classes. Candidates were given the permission to quit at this point. The "A" stage was a way of weeding out men who were unfit to be a paratrooper.
“B” stage saw the highest percentage of dropouts. It consisted of a series of landing exercises and also included “the man breaker” which was a thirty-two foot high structure used to practice plane exit drills.
“C” stage was done using a 250 foot high tower to perform parachuting drills and important life saving techniques.
“D” stage was the final step of the training. Soldiers had to complete 5 successful jumps from an airborne plane to successfully pass and become a Canadian Paratrooper.
England.
In July 1943, the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion was dispatched to England and came under the command of the 3rd Parachute Brigade of the British 6th Airborne Division.
The Battalion then spent the next year in training for airborne operations. Major differences between their previous American training and the new regime included jumping with only one parachute, and doing it through a hole in the floor of the aircraft, instead of through the door of a C-47 Dakota.
Operation Overlord.
On the evening on 5 June 1944 the battalion was transported to France in fifty aircraft. Each man carried a knife, toggle rope, escape kit with French currency, and two 24 hour ration packs in addition to their normal equipment, in all totalling 70 pounds. The battalion landed one hour in advance of the rest of the brigade in order to secure the Drop zone (DZ). Thereafter they were ordered to destroy road bridges over the river Dives and its tributaries at Varaville, then neutralize strongpoints at the crossroads.
In addition, the Canadians were to protect the left (southern) flank of the 9th Battalion, Parachute Regiment during that unit's attack on the Merville Battery, afterwards seizing a position astride the Le Mesnil crossroads, a vital position at the centre of the ridge.
Lieutenant Colonel Bradbrooke issued the following orders to his company commanders:
The Battalion landed between 0100 and 0130 hours on June 6, becoming the first Canadian unit on the ground in France. For different reasons, including adverse weather conditions and poor visibility, the soldiers were scattered, at times quite far from the planned drop zone. By mid-day, and in spite of German resistance, the men of the battalion had achieved all their objectives; the bridges on the Dives and Divette in Varaville and Robehomme were cut, the left flank of the 9th Parachute Battalion at Merville was secure, and the crossroads at Le Mesnil was taken. In the following days, the Canadians were later involved in ground operations to strengthen the bridgehead and support the advance of Allied troops towards the Seine River.
On 23 August 1944 Lieutenant Colonel Bradbrooke was appointed to the General Staff at Canadian Military Headquarters in London with Major Eadie taking temporary control of the battalion. Three days later, on 26 August 1944, the 6th Airborne Division was pulled from the line in Normandy. Of the 27 officers and 516 men from the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion who took part in the Battle of Normandy, 24 officers and 343 men gave their lives. The unit had to be re-organized and retrained in order to regain its strength and combat-readiness. The Battle of Normandy had brought a major change to the way the war was fought. Airborne troops needed new training to prepare for an offensive role, including street fighting and capturing enemy positions. On 6 September the Battalion left Normandy and returned to the Bulford training camp in the United Kingdom. While there, Lieutenant Colonel Jeff Nicklin became battalion commander.
In December 1944, the Battalion was again sent to mainland Europe, on Christmas Day they sailed for Belgium, to counter the German offensive in the Ardennes what became known as the Battle of the Bulge.
The Ardennes and Holland.
On 2 January 1945, the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion was again committed to ground operations on the continent, arriving at the front during the last days of the Battle of the Bulge. They were positioned to patrol during both day and night and defend against any enemy attempts to infiltrate their area. The Battalion also took part in a general advance, taking them through the towns of Aye, Marche, Roy and Bande. The capture of Bande marked the end of the fight for the Bulge and the Battalion's participation in the operation.
The Battalion was next moved into the Netherlands in preparation for the crossing of the River Rhine. They were active in carrying out patrols and raids and to establish bridge heads where and when suitable. Despite the heavy shelling of the Canadian positions, there were very few casualties considering the length of time they were there and the strength of the enemy positions. During this time, the Battalion maintained an active defence as well as considerable patrol activity until its return to the United Kingdom on 23 February 1945.
On 7 March 1945, the Battalion returned from leave to start training for be the last major airborne operation of the war, Operation Varsity, the crossing of the Rhine.
Operation Varsity.
The 17th U.S. Airborne and 6th British Airborne divisions were tasked to capture Wesel across the Rhine River, to be completed as a combined paratrooper and glider operation conducted in daylight.
3rd Para Brigade was tasked;
1st Canadian Parachute Battalion was ordered to seize and hold the central area on the western edge of the woods, where there was a main road running north from the Wesel to Emmerich, and to a number of houses. It was believed this area was held by German paratroopers. "C" Company would clear the northern part of the woods near the junction of the roads to Rees and Emmerich. Once this area was secure, "A" Company would advance through the position and seize the houses located near the DZ. "B" Company would clear the South-Western part of the woods and secure the battalion's flank. Despite some of the paratroopers being dropped some distance from their landing zone, the Battalion managed to secure its objectives quickly. The battalion lost its commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Jeff Nicklin who was killed during the initial jump on 24 March 1945. Following the death of Nicklin, the last unit commander was Lt. Col. G.F. Eadie until its disbandment.
The outcome of this operation was the defeat of the I. "Fallschirmkorps" in a day and a half. In the following 37 days, the Battalion advanced as part of the British 6th Airborne Division, and taking, the city of Wismar on May 2, 1945 to prevent the Soviets from advancing too far West.
It was at Wismar that the battalion met up with the Red Army (the only Canadian army unit to do so during hostilities, other than a Canadian Film and Photo Unit detachment). The armistice was signed on May 8 and the battalion returned to England.
The Battalion sailed for Canada on the "Isle de France" on 31 May 1945, and arrived in Halifax on 21 June. They were the first Canadian unit to be repatriated and on September 30 the battalion was officially disbanded.
Victoria Cross.
One member of the Battalion was awarded the Victoria Cross, Corporal Frederick Topham, east of the River Rhine, near Wesel, Germany, on 24 March 1945.

1891 Martinique hurricane

The 1891 Martinique hurricane, also known as Hurricane San Magín, was an intense major hurricane that struck the island of Martinique and caused massive damage. It was the third hurricane of the 1891 Atlantic hurricane season and the only major hurricane of the season. It was first sighted east of the Lesser Antilles on August 18 as a Category 2 hurricane. The storm made landfall on the island of Martinique, where it caused severe damage, over 700 deaths and at least 1,000 injuries. It crossed eastern Dominican Republic while tracking on a northwestward direction on August 19–20, passed the Mona Passage on August 20 and the Bahamas on August 22–23. It crossed the U.S. State of Florida and dissipated in the Gulf of Mexico after August 25. Total damage is estimated at $10 million (1891 USD). The storm is considered to be the worst on Martinique since 1817.
Meteorological history.
The equivalence of a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale with winds of was first observed at 1200 UTC on August 18, 1891, about east of Barbados. Tracking northwestward at , at 1800 UTC the storm attained winds that correspond to Category 3 status, what is now considered major hurricane. That night, the hurricane passed over Martinique, lashing the island for four continuous hours. It is reported that numerous people suffered deafness on the island during the passage of the storm, believed to be a result of drastic decreases in barometric pressure. After reaching a peak intensity with winds of and a minimum central pressure of 961 mb, the storm began to weaken, and was downgraded to the equivalence of Category 2 status early on August 20. At 1800 UTC, it tracked just to the south of Puerto Rico and, as it began to turn northward, it made landfall on the extreme eastern edge of the Dominican Republic with winds of . Around midnight on August 21, the cyclone passed north of Grand Turk of the Turks and Caicos Islands. During the late afternoon and into the evening hours there, frequent rain squalls occurred, and at 10:15 pm a strong gust of wind was reported. After that gust, the winds decreased in intensity, until around 12:00 am when winds picked up from the west. By 8:00 am the next morning, the wind had become south, and rain was steadily falling on the island.
Back on a northwestward track, it continued to weaken, and tracked through the Bahamas on August 22. The center of the storm was reported to have tracked directly over Crooked Island, Bahamas. Beginning on August 23, a ridge of high pressure was situated off the southeast coast of the United States. Now a Category 1 hurricane, the ridge of high pressure prevented the storm executing a recurve to the north or northeast. Instead, it tracked over the Florida Peninsula as a tropical storm, making landfall near Homestead on August 24. Subsequently, it moved into the Gulf of Mexico, where it officially dissipated on August 25. However, there were reports of a cyclonic disturbance in the east Gulf of Mexico until August 29.
Impact.
On Martinique, the storm struck the east side of the island at about 6:00 pm. Throughout the storm, frequent lightning occurred. Houses, crops and trees across the entire island were obliterated. Especially, the loss of coffee, sugar and cotton crops had a large effect on Martinique's economy. At Ducos, it is noted that only four homes remained following the storm, and at St. Pierre, at least 34 people lost their lives. At Fort de France, the main part of the hospital collapsed, crushing to death two artillery men. Also, a military camp in Balata was destroyed, where houses comprising the campus suffered from severe roof damage. A number of soldiers there sustained injuries from airborne wood blanks and beams. All vessels at harbors were lost during the hurricane.
the 1813 hurricane which killed 3000 on Martinique.-->
Initially, the total number of fatalities was placed at sixty. Later, 118 were reported dead in coastal locations alone. Even after the storm, finding an exact number of casualties was difficult because all roads in and out of interior sections of the island were impassible, blocked by downed trees and large amounts of washed out soil and rock. For a final death toll, the August 1891 Monthly Weather Review states that 700 perished in the storm. However, some newspapers report that the passage of the cyclone resulted in at least 1,000 deaths in Martinique. Additionally, another 1,000 people sustained injuries of one form or another as a direct result of the cyclone. Total damage is estimated at $10 million (1891 USD).
Elsewhere, when the hurricane passed north of Grand Turk, three people drowned on the island, and there was some damage to small houses and shipping vessels. In the U.S. State of Florida, it hit near Homestead as a minimal hurricane, though due to lack of observations near the landfall location its impact in the state is unknown.

511th Parachute Infantry Regiment (United States)

The 511th Parachute Infantry Regiment was a parachute infantry unit of the United States Army first activated during World War II. It formed the parachute infantry element of the 11th Airborne Division.
Activation and Training.
The regiment was formed at Camp Toccoa, GA, in January 1943, under the command of Col. Orin D. "Hard Rock" Haugen. It trained at Camp Mackall, NC, and Fort Benning, GA, and in December 1943 took part in the Knollwood Maneuver. After final examination at Camp Polk, LA, it proceeded to Camp Stoneman, CA, and in May 1944 embarked for the Pacific on the troop transport SS "Sea Pike". It trained at Oro-Dobodura in New Guinea until November 1944, when it was sent to the Philippines to join the Battle of Leyte.
Philippines.
Its mission on Leyte was to take and hold the passes through the mountains in the center of the island, and engage and reduce the Japanese forces in the area, ultimately in support of the battle of Ormoc simultaneously ongoing. The 511th performed this mission during harsh monsoonal weather in the steep, heavily forested terrain, emerging shortly after Christmas of 1944 onto the Ormoc plain.
After rest and resupply the regiment was sent to the island of Mindoro where the 11th Airborne was preparing for its part in the Battle of Luzon. On 3 February 1945 the 511th on board 48 C-47 aircraft performed a combat jump on Tagaytay Ridge. Due to the shortage of planes, the regiment and its associated elements jumped in 3 echelons. Despite some misdrops, the 511th assembled successfully at its drop zone at the Manila Hotel Annex on Tagaytay Ridge and proceeded in battalions north towards Manila, encountering occasional Japanese resistance in the towns of Imus and Las Piñas before engaging the Japanese at the Parañaque River just south of Manila.
During the Battle of Manila, the 511th fought through the Japanese Genko Line from 5–12 February, penetrating as far into Manila as the Dewey-Libertad area, before turning east to attack and recapture Fort William McKinley (Fort Bonifacio, now Bonifacio Global City). On 23 February its 1st Battalion took part in the Raid at Los Baños, freeing over 2,000 foreign Allied civilians from a Japanese internment camp south of Manila, with its B Company performing a parachute jump on the camp itself.
The regiment proceeded to clear a transport corridor from Manila to the towns of Lipa and Batangas City, which has an important port, and took the crossroads town of Santo Tomas. With the rest of the 11th Airborne it also engaged Japanese forces throughout the provinces of Laguna, Batangas, and Tayabas (modern Quezon); the regiment's 1st and 2d battalions in Sixth Army reserve in the towns of Batangas and Bauan, its 3d battalion in active fighting. From April 27–29 it engaged and eliminated the remaining Japanese forces entrenched in underground complexes in the Mount Malepunyo (Malarayat) range east of Lipa.
On 23 June elements of the regiment took part in a combat jump on Aparri in northern Luzon, part of the effort to seal off the retreat of Japanese commander General Yamashita. The regiment remained in the Lipa-Batangas area, training for the planned invasion of Japan, until the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 
Japan.
After the surrender of Japan, the 511th went to Tokyo and then to northern Honshū to perform occupation duty.
On August 30th, 1945 the 511th arrived by air at Atsugi Air Base near Yokohama to occupy the city and guard the docks from which the peace delegation left to go to the USS Missouri and the signing of the Surrender. On September 2nd the Division Band was on hand to greet the debarking 1st Cavalry Division with the strains of “The Old Grey Mare.”
<br> On September 16th, 1945 the 511th moved to Morioka, Japan to begin the occupation of Iwate and Aomori Prefectures in Northern Honshu. In February of 1949, the Regiment except for the 3rd Battalion departed Camp Haugen and returned to the United States via the Panama Canal and arrived in New Orleans in March 1949, from where it moved to Camp Campbell, Kentucky. The 3rd Battalion remained in Camp Haugen until April 1949, when it departed for the United States. 
Germany.
In March 1956 the 511th (as part of the 11th Airborne Division) crossed the Atlantic into Europe to replace the 5th Infantry Division at Augsburg, Germany during Operation Gyroscope. 
Inactivation.
The 511th's fifteen-year history came to an end at Fort Campbell in July 1958, when the Regiment was inactivated. 
Company A.
On June 1st 1993, Company A, 511th Parachute Infantry Regiment was reactivated at Fort Rucker, Alabama to serve as Pathfinders, replacing Company C, 509th Parachute Infantry Regiment in that role. They were deactivated in November 1994 and the Pathfinder mission discontinued. On October 1st 1997, Company A, 511th Parachute Infantry Regiment was reactivated as a Test Company for the Enhanced Fiber Optic Guided Missile (EFOGM) system, under the Command of Captain Stephen Inouye at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. It was the first and only EFOGM Company in the world. On July 28th 2005, Captain Mark Chandler cased the colors during the deactivation ceremony at Rose Field in Fort Bragg, North Carolina.

Teddy Tamgho

Teddy Tamgho (born 15 June 1989) is a French triple jumper and long jumper. He specialises in the triple jump. He is the current triple jump world indoor record holder at 17.92 m, achieved in winning the final and gold medal at the 2011 European Indoor Championships. He is the world's third best ever triple jumper outdoors, with his best mark of 18.04 metres achieved in winning the final and gold medal at the 2013 World Championships.
Tamgho's first triple jump gold medal came at the 2008 World Junior Championships and he reached the triple jump final (where he finished in 11th position) of the World Championships the following year. He came to prominence by setting
a new triple jump world indoor record of 17.90 m in winning the triple jump final and gold medal at the 2010 World Indoor Championships. He was the triple jump overall winner of the 2010 IAAF Diamond League and the triple jump bronze medallist at the 2010 European Championships. Tamgho missed the 2012 London Olympics because of an operation on his right ankle.
Career.
2007-2009: Early part of his career.
Born in Paris, France, Teddy Tamgho became interested in athletics as a young boy growing up in the commune of Sevran. He began representing Dynamic Aulnay Club in triple jump competitions from the age of 13. His first international championships appearance came at the 2007 European Junior Championships and he just missed out on the podium, taking fourth, but still managed a personal best jump of 16.35 m. At the end of 2007, in Eaubonne, he set a new national junior record of 16.53 m. He registered a mark of 16.94 metres to win his first French National Indoor Championships senior triple jump title on 16 February 2008 in Bordeaux — a jump which made him the second best junior triple jumper indoors of all time internationally, just behind Volker Mai. Tamgho stated that his run-up speed was his strong point and that his success was a result of working with his coach, Jean-Hervé Stievenart, and training partners Karl Taillepierre and Benjamin Compaoré.
Going into the 2008 outdoor season, Tamgho achieved the Olympic qualifying mark (17.10 m) but the tailwind of 2.1 m/s was slightly too strong to make his jump valid. He did not manage to achieve the requisite mark in time for the Olympic team selection and it was Colomba Fofana who took the only men's triple jump berth in the 2008 French Olympic team. Tamgho won the 2008 World Junior Championships gold medal with a jump of 17.33 m in the final, but the mark was wind-aided (2.1 m/s), just outside the legal limit of 2.0 m/s. Tamgho was the only athlete to clear the 17m mark in that final, and he did it thrice. He failed to repeat his form at the French national outdoor championships, and was fourth in 16.79 m—far behind the event winner Jules Lechanga. 
Coached by Jean-Hervé Stievenart and Laurence Bily, Tamgho started the 2009 indoor season with notable improvements, beating his 16.94 m (set on 16 February 2008) indoor personal best three times consecutively in Mondeville on the 1st February (the best jump was 17.37 m). He improved even further in mid February at the Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy indoor meeting in Paris with a jump of 17.58 m (he had a foul jump near the 17.80 m mark) — a new under-23 world record and just one centimetre short of the French national indoor record set by Pierre Camara in 1993 in Toronto. He then jumped 17.44 m to claim his second senior national indoor triple jump title at the 2009 French National Indoor Championships in Liévin. Tamgho had been competing in recent weeks with an injury, however, and he used the two weeks leading to the 2009 European Indoor Championships in Turin as recovery time. At those championships he opened with a jump of 15.94m but fouled his remaining two jumps, and was thus eliminated in the qualification round despite being one of the favourites of the triple jump event.
At the start of the 2009 outdoor season he lined up against the 2008 Olympics silver medallist Phillips Idowu at the Meeting Areva in Paris. While Idowu jumped 17.17 m to earn victory, Tamgho was well below his top form and jumped 16.97 m to take fifth place. He confirmed himself as the nation's top triple jumper in July 2009 by winning his first French National Outdoor Championships 
(held in Angers) senior triple jump title with a jump of 17.11 m (which was his best jump of the year). That was enough to earn him qualification for the upcoming World Championships in Berlin. At the 2009 World Championships in August, Tamgho qualified for the final with a jump of 17.11 m in the qualification round. However, he did not improve in the final. He could only finish the final in eleventh position, with only one legal jump in the final (16.79 m).
2010-2013: Major international championships gold medals and world records.
After finishing as runner-up to Colomba Fofana in the triple jump senior category at the French National Indoor Championships in February 2010 with a jump of 17.01 m, Tamgho turned his attention on the global stage. At the 2010 World Indoor Championships, he took an early lead in the triple jump final with a jump of 17.41 m, but Yoandri Betanzos surprised him with a 17.69 m personal best in the first round. Tamgho initially thought a lesser jump would have been enough to secure the title, but following the Cuban's jump he said "I had to react and give it all". After a couple of fouls and two more jumps past the 17-metre mark, Tamgho had one final jump left to overhaul Betanzos. On his last attempt, he jumped seven centimetres clear of the existing indoor world record mark (jointly held by Aliecer Urrutia and Christian Olsson) to set a new world indoor record of 17.90 m and break Pierre Camara's 17-year old national indoor record of 17.59m. He said he thought his previous season had been flawed, but that he had now grown stronger and matured, following advice from fellow competitors Jadel Gregório and Phillips Idowu to take part in competitions in a calmer manner.
Tamgho's good form continued into the 2010 outdoor season. He recorded a series of five jumps over 17 metres at the French National Interclub Championships, highlighted by a world leading jump of 17.63 m (and a new French national record), on 23 May in Franconville. He had a wind-assisted jump of 17.63 m two weeks later in Montreuil. On 12 June 2010, he took part in the Adidas Grand Prix in New York City, his first IAAF Diamond League event. In that event, he jumped 17.60 m in the third round, and improved by a centimetre in the next jump before setting a personal best of 17.84 m to take the lead. Having already secured victory, he pushed even further with his final attempt to jump 17.98 m, making himself the third best triple jumper outdoors on the all-time list behind Jonathan Edwards and Kenny Harrison. Just three days before his 21st birthday, Tamgho had achieved the longest triple jump outdoors for over a decade. He won the 2010 French National Outdoor Championships senior triple jump title for the second time, but had to contend with a right calf cramp en route to victory. He was ruled out of the Paris Diamond League meeting due to injury. He had not jumped in training in the build up to the 2010 European Championships, but he still managed to clear 17.45 m to take the bronze medal, his first medal at the competition. Wins at the DN Galan and Memorial Van Damme triple jump events made him the inaugural 2010 IAAF Diamond League triple jump overall winner. He announced a change of coach at the end of the season, starting work with four-time long jump world champion Iván Pedroso. He was recognised as the 2010 European Athletics Rising Star of the Year for his breakthrough year.
Tamgho started 2011 in similarly strong form as he improved his world indoor record by a centimetre to win the French National Indoor Championships senior triple jump title for the third time with a jump of 17.91m. He improved his world indoor record one centimetre further at the 2011 European Indoor Championships, clearing 17.92 m in the triple jump final on both the second and fourth jumps, to take the gold medal with a new world indoor record in front of the home crowd at the Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy in Paris. The day before the triple jump final, Tamgho had narrowly failed to win the bronze medal in the long jump event of the 2011 European Indoor Championships. He finished the long jump final in 4th position, jumping only 2 cm less than the bronze medallist Morten Jensen. 
On 30 June 2011, Tamgho achieved an outdoor jump of 17.91 m at the 2011 IAAF Diamond League Athletissima athletics meeting in Lausanne. That mark would remain the world leading outdoor jump for 2011 until Christian Taylor beat it by 5 cm on September 4 in the triple jump final of the 2011 World Championships in Daegu. Tamgho fractured his right ankle while warming up for the qualification round of the 2011 European Under-23 Championships that was held in Ostrava in July 2011. He was thus forced to pull out of the upcoming 2011 World Championships in Daegu and for the rest of the year he did not take part in any athletics event held after the 2011 European Under-23 Championships in Ostrava. He underwent surgery on his fractured right ankle in the second half of 2011. 
In December 2011, Tamgho was handed a 12-month ban from competition by his national athletics federation, half of which was suspended, for assaulting a female athlete following his altercation with her at the CREPS sports training camp in Saint-Raphaël at the end of October 2011. He was also fined €1,500 and ordered to complete 50 hours of community service. He thus missed the chance to defend his triple jump title at the 2012 IAAF World Indoor Championships in March but would be eligible to participle in the 2012 Olympics in London. He accepted the verdict and expressed his regret.
Tamgho was forced to pull out of the 2012 Olympics in London after undergoing a right ankle operation on 4 June 2012 to remove a bone growth that was the result of the right ankle fracture sustained in July 2011. 
Tamgho returned to athletics competition in May 2013 after an absence of 22 months. He had earlier skipped the entire indoor season of 2013 to concentrate on his preparations for the 2013 World Championships in Moscow. He won the 2013 World Championships men's triple jump gold medal with a jump of 18.04 m in the final, which made him only the third man in history, after Jonathan Edwards and Kenny Harrison, to jump 18.00 m or more outdoors. In the final, on three of his first five jumps, Tamgho appeared to land beyond the 18-metres barrier but all of these jumps were slight fouls. He was just two centimetres over the board on his second and third jumps, and six centimetres over the board on his fifth. Therefore, before attempting his sixth and final jump, only his first (17.65m) and fourth jump (17.68m) were legal jumps. On his sixth and final jump, he hit the board square and legally jumped over the magic 18-metres barrier for the first time in his life. Tamgho became the first ever French male World Championships medallist in the triple jump and the first French World Championships gold medallist in any event since 2005. 
After fracturing his left tibia during training on 27 November 2013, Tamgho was immediately sent to the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris,where he successfully underwent surgery on his left tibia on the following day. On 13 December 2013 at a press conference in Paris, Tamgho announced that he would miss the entire 2014 athletics season in order to recover fully from his left tibia surgery. "My goal is to be number one and I will not enter any competition if I am not at 100 percent of my capabilities. I do not want to rush things."
In December 2013, Tamgho was chosen as the 2013 French male athlete of the year, according to an Internet poll taken from the athletics fraternity, in which more than 2500 votes were cast over two weeks. The poll was conducted by the Fédération française d'athlétisme.

Silesian Treasury (pl: "Skarb Śląski") - name of the treasury of the Silesian Voivodeship.
General information.
The Silesian Treasury consisted of about 1 ton of gold in 1939. It was managed by the Silesian Parliament. The voivodeship produced about 46% Polish PKB; 90% of the local income remained in the autonomous region, while the remaining 10% used to be become part of the state budget.
Vault.
A vault containing the Treasury of Silesia was placed in the basements of the building of the Silesian Parliament. At the outbreak of the second world war, there was about a ton of gold in staffs kept inside. The walls of the vault were thicker than in the rest of the building, they were about 1,5 metre thick, and so were the ceilings. The vault contains a mechanism which, if a stranger attempted to open the manhole, sinks the treasure in a pool below. The vault serves today as a place where archive documents are being formed.

French Supertouring Championship

The Championnat de France de Supertourisme () was a touring car racing championship organised by the Fédération Française du Sport Automobile between 1976 and 2005.
The championship was contested on several circuits around France, with points awarded for driver classification. The winning driver was the one with the most points at the end of the season.
A national title was given in 1974, but a proper touring car championship only started in 1976. The cars were run to Group 2 specification, and the championship was called the Championnat Français de Voiture de Tourisme (French Touring Car Championship). From 1982, Group A rules were adopted to replace the outgoing Group 2, but in 1983 the FFSA modified them to be loosely based on Group A, evolving into the 1987 and 1988 seasons, where Group B type machines, called "Superproduction," were allowed to run alongside Group A, dominating the series. The championship changed its name to Super Tourisme in 1989, when Group A cars were allowed technical evolutions to keep up with the faster Superproduction cars.
A major change happened in 1991, when the FFSA adopted a set of regulations similar to the British Touring Car Championship, with a maximum engine displacement of 2000 cm3. In 1994, these regulations were formally codified by the FIA as Supertouring. All works teams abandoned the championship at the end of 1995 but the series soldiered on with privateers. To make up the numbers, rally kitcars were allowed on the grid.
In 2001, Supertouring cars were replaced in the series by silhouette cars. Despite the change of class, the series retained its name. The final season was held in 2005, when because of rising costs the championship was cancelled. Since then, the most prestigious French circuit championship has been the GT Tour.

<doc id="18421892" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18421892" title="Guangdong Experimental High School">
Guangdong Experimental High School

Guangdong Experimental High School () is a selective Public High School in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China. It is one of the six best high schools in the city, one of the two key high schools directly administered by the Department of Education of Guangdong Province (along with the Affiliated High School of South China Normal University). The school has a tremendously high reputation in Southern China for its consistently outstanding academic performance.
The school is commonly known as SS, an abbreviation of "Sheng Shi" or "Sang Sat",() by parents and students in Guangzhou. It means 'Provincial Experimental (school)', which abbreviates Guangdong Experimental High School.
If unspecified, Guangdong Experimental High School usually refers to the senior high campus at Fangcun.
History.
The history of the school has always been a controversial topic as it has involved many schools in the city after a series of mergers, splits and renames. Strictly speaking, the current SS established in 1960, however, the earliest origin of the school can be tracked back to 'Guǎngdōng Gézhì Xuétáng'() in 1888. Due to many reforms took place while the school developed, there were different stories regarding this topic. Some also argued that the establishing date of SS should be in 1924. It was backed up by the story that the school selected the year as to commemorate Sun Yat-sen.
In 1888, Dr. Andrew Patton Happer established the Christian College in Shaji, Guangzhou, also known as '广东格致学堂' in Chinese. It was then reformed into National Higher Normal College, also known as '两广优级师范学堂' in Chinese, in 1910 to train teachers within Guangdong and Guangxi Province.
In 1924, the college merged into National Kwangtung University, who later became the Sun Yat-sen University in 1926, as its affiliated high school and primary school.
Due to the Disciplinary Adjustment of Chinese Higher Education, four high schools merged into the Affiliated School of South China Normal University in 1952:
In 1960, the school was split into high school and primary school. The high school later became the current Affiliated High School of South China Normal University, whereas the primary school had then reformed into the current SS.
SS was renamed to the No.60 Middle School of Guangzhou for a decade during Cultural Revolution. After that, It formalised its name as Guangdong Experimental High School in 1987.
In 2008, The current senior management team of the school decided to use 1888 as the official establishing date of the school and celebrated the school's 120th anniversary. This flawed decision, however, has now been widely accepted by the public.
Present day.
The school now has four campuses. The main campus, senior high campus, locates at Kengkou, Liwan District, Guangzhou. It is also known as the 'New Campus' or 'Fangcun Campus' by students as it was constructed in 2004 and the location was in the previous Fangcun District, which was withdrawn and merged to Liwan District in 2005.
The old campus, also known as 'Zhongsi Campus', has then become the junior high campus, since three upper year groups moved to the new campus. It is located at No.4 Zhongshan Rd in Yuexiu District, Guangzhou. 'Zhongsi Campus' had been the only campus before the school expanded at the beginning of the 21st Century, It contains all the history and precious memory of SS, and has recorded the step by step development of the school since 1960.
Other campuses are as follows;
Strictly speaking, these three campuses are not quite parts of the school. Although they are administered under the same senior management team and have strong links with SS's main campus, but are highly independent and completely privately funded. They are more commonly known as the affiliated Schools of SS, and are also generally excluded by the students and parents in regard to school's performance.
Senior High.
Admissions.
SS's senior high, unlike the junior high, selects students by their academic abilities, primarily by students' results in 'Zhongkao', the senior secondary education entrance examination. SS has always maintained a fairly high entrance requirement, as to ensure the limited places are offered to students who meet the academic standard.
Similar to most of the other high schools who have experienced an expansion in the 21st century. The school now has the capability to offer additional places to students who missed the set requirements. However, a relatively lower score is still required and an additional tuition fee will be charged as well.
The school also encourages students who have extraordinary talents beside academics, primarily in sports and performing arts, to apply. A different application process is offered, where good academic results are much less desirable. This policy has attracted many exceptional athletes, singers and dancers, and it has been proven to be a successful measure in boosting the school's competitiveness outside academic areas.
Campus.
Senior high campus is a boarding campus accommodates some 3000 students. The first group of students moved in from the old campus in 2004, when the construction was completed. (Although there were still minor ongoing constructions taking place at the time and some facilities were yet to be installed.) Later in 2005, the whole senior high department, including the senior management team, had moved over to the new campus. Student number rose rapidly as the expansion was introduced in 2004. The new campus allows the school to have the capability of offering more than 1000 places each year to new junior graduates. All the facilities were put in use around that time in 2005.
The campus simply consists of academics area, dormitory area, sports area and restaurant. As enter from the front gate, academic buildings can be found on the right hand side, sports area on the front, and on the left hand side, dorms and restaurant. In academics area, three year groups are taught in three separate buildings with 20 classrooms in each. There is a massive laboratory building behind the three main teaching buildings equipped with brilliant facilities for Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Technology experiments.
Library, private study rooms, computer rooms and a large lecture room are located in the centre building of the area, with a small outdoor stage at the back of it. The administration building, which has meeting rooms for conferences and offices to the heads, sits in the front between the two teaching ones. All buildings in the academic area are internally connected, and the architecture is very modern.
Two dorms separated by gender can be easily spotted on the left of the front gate. Each of them has 6 floors with about 35 rooms on each to accommodate some 95% of the student body. Rooms are shared between six, all en suite and air conditioner-ed. Lockers and cupboards are provided as well. There is also a staff dorm next to the student ones.
The school provides great sporting facilities. There is a sport centre right in front as enter from the school gate, primarily for badminton and table tennis. Eight outdoor basketball courts are on the right of the centre. Behind it, a standard 400m track with a football pitch in the middle is there for students to jog or play football. There is also a standard 50m swimming pool and a well equipped gym room next to it. The sports centre is also sometimes used as a stage for variety performances, ceremonies and large presentations.
Academics.
Guangdong Experimental High School has always been praised for its exceptional academic performance, which is the most important criterion in judging schools in China.
Performance in Gaokao, also known as National Higher Education Entrance Examination, is the most convincing academic indication for senior high school in China. Being one of the best schools, SS has always undoubtedly been given very high expectations. And in recent years, proud SS senior graduates continually to impress everybody with outstanding results.
Over the last decade, 36 students nailed the first place in the province, in both overall score and single subject. In 2009, Guangdong Experimental High School graduates took up 21 places in the top 200 in the province, including 7 first places in different subjects. 40% of the top scorers (above 680*) in the city are from Experimental High School, 20% for score over 650 and 10% for over 600.
ExtraCurricular Activities.
SS prides itself on the vast range of extracurricular activities offered to students in school.
Choir.
Guangdong Experimental High School Choir, founded in 1952, has participated in many chorus competitions both nationally and internationally and received numerous prizes for its exceptional performance. It has always been one of the best vocal groups in China. Being the only choir that was made up of no professionals but only high school students, it has won nine consecutive champions in the Interscholastic Chorus Competitions.

The new campus offers brilliant facilities, including eight outdoor full courts and an indoor court ready to be put up when needed, for student/staff to play basketball while in school. The eight courts are normally allocated different year groups, with Court 1 - 2, 3 - 4, 5 - 6 shared between senior 1 - 3 respectively, Court 7 being the training court for the school team and Court 8 for the staff.
The school runs a basketball team, who plays in the Nike High School League as well as the local competitions. The school team squad trains up to 4 days a week during term time. Tryouts normally take place in the second semister every year to Senior 1 students for the coming season, however, extraordinary players may be recruited anytime in the year.
Notable alumni.
SS has thousands of successful alumni all over the world, including four fellows of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, three fellows of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
American Campus Fraud.
In September 2011, several major medias reported that a new campus of SS in Los Angeles, CA, USA was established, which made SS the first Chinese high school to have a campus in the United States of America. However, this was soon discovered to be a fraud, and the said collaboration between SS and the US Academy was never formed in any ways. Few weeks later, the school made a formal apology to the public, the alumni in America in particular.

Leonid Efimovich Minin (Ukrainian: Леонід Юхимович Минин) (Born 14 December 1947) is an international arms trafficker. He was arrested on August 4, 2000 by Italian authorities in Cinisello Balsamo near Milan. Minin had been under surveillance since 1992 for his suspected illegal arms dealings, mostly to West African nations. He was sentenced to two years in prison in Italy.
He was born in Ukraine, but moved to Israel in the 1970s. In the mid-1970s, Germany arrested him for falsifying identity documents and he was suspected of theft of art. He moved to Bolivia, Switzerland, Germany, Monaco, and Italy. In the 1990s he opened a timber business registered in Zug in Switzerland as well as offices in Monrovia in Liberia and Tel Aviv in Israel.
It is believed that his customers have included Liberian dictator Charles Taylor and the Revolutionary United Front militants in Sierra Leone. Police found documents regarding these transactions in Minin's belongings. The arms allegedly came from Aviatrend, a Russian company owned by Valery Cherny. The same Aviatrend has been involved in money laundering by Slobodan Milošević.
Nicolas Cage's character in the film "Lord of War" is a composite of Minin and suspected arms smuggler Viktor Bout.

Ellon railway station

Ellon railway station was a railway station in Ellon, Aberdeenshire.
History.
Ellon Railway Station (originally Ellon for Cruden) was situated on the Formartine and Buchan Railway, which ran from Peterhead/Fraserburgh to Dyce (where it connected to the Great North of Scotland Railway to Aberdeen).
A few years after opening, Ellon Station became a junction station for the Boddam Branch line, which ran to Boddam via Cruden Bay. In its heyday the station had three platforms, two for the main line and one for the Boddam Branch. There was also a substantial goods yard. The branch line closed in 1932, and was used to store wagons until the track was lifted in 1950.
The station is situated in Auchterellon, about 1 mile from the town centre.
Ellon survived until 1965, when passenger services were withdrawn from the Formartine and Buchan Railway due to the Beeching Axe. The line was closed to freight in 1978, with the tracks being lifted soon afterwards.
The station today.
The trackbed of the main line was initially preserved, before becoming the Formartine and Buchan Way, a long distance cycle path. At the station site itself, no buildings survive, however the platforms and base of the water tower are still extant. A council depot was built on the former Goods Yard. The bridge over station road has been removed to the south, with the abutments being converted to allow graded access to cross the road. 
As the Boddam Branch closed in 1932, with the track being lifted much earlier, most of the branch line within Ellon has been built on, by housing along Hospital Road, and the A948 Ellon Northern Bypass in 2001. However some of the trackbed is still visible from Golf Road, next to the McDonald Parklands housing estate.
The future.
Transport Scotland ordered a feasibility study for the reopening of sections of the Formartine and Buchan line in 2013. Depending on the results of the study, it is possible that a station in Ellon may reopen in the future.

188th Infantry Regiment (United States)

The 188th Glider Infantry Regiment was a regiment in the United States Army that was active during World War II. It was a part of the 11th Airborne Division during its entire existence.
The 188th Infantry Regiment was constituted on 12 November 1942 at Camp Mackall, North Carolina. On 25 February 1943, the 188th was activated under the command of Colonel Robert H. Soule. It was designated a glider regiment, and assigned to the 11th Airborne Division. A two battalion regiment, the 188th trained and prepared for combat with its men trained at the end of the war both as gliderists and parachutists. Subsequently, on 4 July 1945 the regiment was redesignated as the 188th Parachute Infantry.
In April, 1944 the 11th was moved to Camp Stoneman, east of San Francisco, California. The camp processed units for movement overseas. The 11th spent 6 days at the camp being fed extremely well and provided with as much entertainment as possible. One of the tasks at Stoneman was to learn what to do on a ship in case of an attack, and the need to abandon ship. By 11 May the division had sailed on several ships from the port of San Francisco for a 28 day voyage to New Guinea.
New Guinea.
The 11th landed as a reserve unit for the Hollandia Operation. Japanese still occupied the island and there was fighting in other parts of the island. Although the 11th had combat alert, they were not committed. By July, 1944 the Japanese had been cut off and isolated in New Guinea. In the meantime Admiral Nimitz's "Island Hopping" had retaken the Solomons, Gilberts, Marshals and Marianas. Between June, 1944 and that September, the 11th had become accustomed to the heat and the jungle conditions. This included jumping into razor sharp Hunai grass. Malaria medication also became a daily routine.
While they there, General MacArthur personally informed General Swing the 11th would be committed to a large operation. He was investigating an airborne assault. New training was centered on jump school and combat in the jungle, with an emphasis on live firing exercises. The entire 11th also had amphibious training whenever possible. General Swing took care of his troops in every way he deemed necessary to improve their survival and morale. His troops would realize after their combat experiences that he trained them hard, and well. He demanded the discipline they would need to survive. Staff and commanders were expected to bolster the welfare and morale of the men whenever possible.
This ghost unit was created for specific purposes, not known to others. It was not an authorized unit. The members, on paper, were assigned to various units within the division. This included the 511th, 187th, and 188th. It was an all volunteer unit, and those men could drop out any time without explanation. General Swing wanted a small, well trained unit at his disposal to use as necessary without any explanation. It would be a secret that remained within the 11th.
The Philippines.
On 3 October 1944 The Joint Chiefs of Staff approved MacArthur's commitment to return and free the Philippines. The 11th landed at Bito Beach on the Leyete Gulf in November, 1944. The 11th relieved the 7th Infantry Division and was ordered to search and destroy the enemy in their sector. The sector included a very rugged heavily forested mountain range which extended from the Cariaga Bay in the north to the Cabalian and Sogod Bays in the south. The 188th under Colonel "Shorty" Soule was to secure the southern part of the sector. The 188th 1st Battalion also patrolled and engaged the enemy as far as the west coast of Leyte. They protected the 511th as it moved west. When that was completed, the 188th turned and moved north. Unknown at the time, the increased Japanese buildup of ground forces on Leyte would result in major combat for the 11th.
The first Japanese offensive occurred 5 December 1944. It was a major attack by General Yamashita to recapture the airfields in the Burauen-Dulag area. Before Japanese paratroopers with fighter escort jumped, the Buri, San Pablo, and medium bombers strafed Buyug airstrips. The enemy was repelled, and the 1st of the 187th was ordered to clear the Buri strip as soon as possible. The Japanese retreated because they recognized it was more important to hold another location, Ormoc. At the Bayug strip the enemy had set fire to a number of planes that the 11th relied on to keep troops in the hills supplied.
Luzon.
The 11th landed on 31 January 1945. Two glider combat teams landed amphibiously at a town, Nasugbu, on the west coast of the island of Luzon, south of Manila. The 188th 1st battalion Co. C was among them. The plan was that the 188th Infantry Regimental Combat Team would assault Nasughu first and secure a beachhead. Co. C of the 1st 188th was also ordered by Colonel Soule to follow and clear Japanese from the area to the north of the beach.
The landing was very dangerous. The seas were too calm, and the artillery supporting the 188th could not get ashore to suppress Japanese firepower. When the 2 Battalions of the 188th were organized on the shore, Colonel Soule then ordered them to push to an area, Tagauytay Ridge, to stop the enemy from setting up defensive positions against the 511th troopers who would be dropped there. As this occurred, the 187th relieved the 188th of the operations and defense of Nasugbu. General Eichelberger of the 8th Army had the 11th attached to his command. He bluffed the enemy into thinking a large force was moving up Highway 17 across Tagaytay Ridge heading for Manila. He ordered the men to move as fast as possible and make as much dust as possible. They were to fire as many weapons and artillery as possible.
The 188th spearheaded the push to Manila. They moved so fast under Colonel Soule that the Japanese were taken by surprise at the Palico River Bridge, and it was captured. Later on Highway 17 they ran into the best Japanese combat troops since their landing. With the 1st of the 187th and the 188th they launched another major attack against Japanese defenses on Mount Aiming near Tagaytay Ridge.
The attack began the morning of 1 February 1945. A Co. of the 188th withstood 4 hours of continuous counterattacks, and one Banzai attack. It continued to the morning of 3 February 1945 when the 188th and the 1st of the 187th launched an attack against the 3rd and final enemy position. The Japanese responded with heavy artillery and machine gun fire.
The 188th and 1st of the 187th were pinned down along with several high-ranking officers. Two battalions of Japanese artillery were pounding the area of Tagaytay Ridge. In the final assault the 188th and the 1st of the 187th used flamethrowers and grenades to overtake an area of the ridge that was later renamed "Shorty Ridge". As a result, the 11th that landed amphibiously (187th & 188th) were ready to make contact with the 511th paratroopers who on 3 February 1945 were landing to the east on Tagaytay Ridge.
After the 188th made contact with the 511th, they continued to clear enemy from the ridges and slopes south of the ridge, as well as from the caves and tunnels on "Shorty Ridge". It was then discovered that the ridge was honeycombed with enormous supply tunnels, reinforced concrete caves, as well as strong guns and individual firing positions. Then next day, 4 February 1945, a wounded Colonel Soule (recipient of the Distinguished Service Cross) would continue to lead the rest of the 188th, less one company to keep the ridge secure, on foot towards Manila.
Manila.
Before its liberation the city of Manila and its people would suffer horrific destruction of its buildings and people. By the fall of 1944 there were 800,000 people in Manila. The Japanese had already destroyed large parts of the city and converted houses into machine gun nests. As the Americans advanced, Filipinos tried to flee the city. The Japanese retaliated with torture and other atrocities that they had used against civilians before. Nursing women were bayoneted in their breasts. People’s tendons in the back of their necks were severed with sabers, so that a person could no longer hold their head up. Small children and babies were also bayoneted. Soon the 11th would face their own horrors and suffer heavy losses against the Japanese fortified Genko Line outside Manila. 12,500 Japanese were guarding Manila in an entrenched protected fortified area south of Manila, including Nicklos Field and Fort William McKinley.
By 6 February 1945 the 511th had stormed into the southern suburbs of Manila. On 7 February 1945, the 188th attacked the area around Nicklos Field, while the 511th fought house to house and in the streets. On 10 February 1945, the 1st of the 188th was pinned down by heavy machine fire until a Major Loeper led them in an attack on enemy positions. He died in action, and was later award the Distinguished Service Cross.
Nevertheless, by 11 February 1945, the Japanese firepower at Nicklos Field remained unchanged. For this reason a full scale attack was launched by the 187th and the 188th. The fighting was to the death with hand-to-hand combat using bayonets and knives. By nightfall, the 187th and 188th had cleared most of the field of enemy combatants. The next objective was Fort Mc Kinley itself. By 17 February 1945 the attack on the fort had begun. The plan called for the 188th, the 2nd of the 187th and the 511th to pivot and strike the Fort. They were to meet at the Caribon Gate of Fort McKinley.
By the next day the 1st of the 188th was within the fort, and joined by the 511th. The rest of the enemy retreated to the east. All organized resistance in Manila would not cease until the beginning of March. By then the 11th had control of the city and achieved their first of 2 goals given to them by Mac Arthur. The next task was the freeing of civilian POWS at the Los Banos Camp.
Raid at Los Banos.
Since the beginning of the Philippines campaign, it was a priority of General MacArthur that both civilians and soldiers held in Japanese camps be rescued as soon as possible. He feared retribution on them, as the Japanese suffered defeats. The Los Banos Camp held more than 2,000 civilians of all ages, and nationalities who were captured during the Japanese invasion. The rescue would involve sending the 11th, behind Japanese lines. Also, a 90 minute march away from the camp were 9,000 battle hardened soldiers of the Japanese 19th Division, known as the "Tiger Division".
In order to have a plan, Sgt. John Fulton of the 511th Signal Co. volunteered to join Filipino guerrillas in the area. For a few weeks he lived with them and transmitted information back to the 11th. He had also made contact with some young men who were sneaking out at night from the camp to search for food. In this way a rescue plan was designed to overtake the guards by surprise. Its success was dependent on knowing the camp routine, especially that of the guards.
The plan would involve the 672nd Amphibious Tractor Battalion, the 1st of the 511th and the 188th under Colonel Soule. Co. B of the 511th would lead a parachute attack on the camp. C. Co. of the 511th would jump and eliminate a small Japanese force nearby and set up a roadblock near the town of Los Banos. A Co. of the 511th would jump and also set up another roadblock to intercept the enemy. All the men were greatly outnumbered should this attack and rescue go wrong.
Again under the command of General Joe Swing, the attack began on 23 February 1945 at 7:00 a.m. The time was chosen because advance information had placed the guards at that time away from their weapons, doing calisthenics. The 511th easily overtook them. Several hours later the entire population had been moved and transported amphibiously across a large body of water to a safe area While the attack on the camp was occurring, the 188th had attacked Japanese positioned near the camp at the San Juan River. By midmorning they had cleared the area of the enemy and marched towards Los Banos to provide more fighting power for the rescue. When Colonel Soule saw the Amtracs filled with the internees on Laguna de Bay moving to a safe location, Mamated, he gave new orders. He ordered a bridgehead near the San Juan River, and blocked the road from Santo Tomas, where the Tiger Marines were positioned. The 188th placed themselves directly in their path to Los Banos, should they be alerted. Fortunately, this did not occur. It would have been a death sentence for every man. The 188th was credited with the success of the raid and the protection of the 511th and others transporting the internees.
Besides Los Banos the 1st of the 188th, was ordered to clear the southern sector of Luzon of any enemy. They attacked in an area known as Ternate and the Pico de Loro Hills on the southern shore of Manila Bay. This action took one month. The Japanese were again using a cave defense system. The artillery and mortars couldn't hit their targets because of the terrain, and razor sharp thickets hid the caves. It required man-to-man combat. After this sector was captured by the 188th, they found 40 Japanese suicide Q boats used to ram American ships. The 1st lost 40 men and 103 wounded in action in one month. In April they were again engaged in another attack.
The entire division committed 105 days of combat from the landing at Nasugbu to the end of the Southern Luzon campaign with a battle at Malepungo. The last operation was Operation Aparri on 23 June 1945. 7 gliders were used, to drop troops, for the first time in the Pacific Theater. This was the end of the Luzon Campaign. The next destination would be the invasion of Japan. The 11th was poised to be among the first to lead the invasion. To that end the 11th was retrained, reorganized and sent on R&R to Australia. The 188th and the 674th became parachute units 20 July 1945 (glider regiments had been increased to 3 battalions).
Then the decision to use the atomic bomb on Japan changed the course of history. It was estimated that the U.S. would lose approximately one million men in an invasion, because of fanatical resistance by the population as well as the homeland troops. After 2 Atomic bombs were dropped, Japan was forced to an unconditional surrender.
Occupation, Japan.
The 11th was selected by General Mac Arthur to lead the Allied Forces in occupying Japan. On 30 August 1945, the 188th were the first to land on Japanese soil with 1096 men. The 187th quickly followed with 1257 men and the 511th with 1165 men.

541st Parachute Infantry Regiment (United States)

The 541st Parachute Infantry Regiment was a regiment in the United States Army during World War II. While never to see combat the unit, was composed of highly trained and highly educated troopers. It was also utilized to send trained replacements overseas.
The 541st Parachute Infantry Regiment Is Born.
The 541st Parachute Infantry Regiment was activated August 12, 1943 at Fort Benning, Georgia, under the command of Colonel Ducat M. McEntee and his Executive Officer Major Harley N. Trice. The unit was filled with men who had already completed Basic and Infantry Training, but were yet to complete Jump School. The men who filled out the unit's ranks were of a high caliber, all had scored exceptionally well on their Army Entrance Exams; all were volunteers.
One of the original members of the unit was famed 101st Airborne author Donald R. Burgett, who later participated in all the World War II battles of A Company 506th Parachute Infantry. Pvt. Burgett's first impressions of the 541st were to meet the Parachute School instructors who would take them through the four week program, after a five-mile run and a full morning of calisthenics, men were already beginning to fall out. 
The Regiment was taking form and only the determined would survive! Any man who quit was immediately removed and banished to the Military Police, a fate deemed shameful to a paratrooper who considered their duty to challenge the authority of the MPs every chance they got.
The men completed Jump School as a unit, but not without casualties. One planeload of prospective paratroopers crashed in a ball of fire, killing all on board. Others, Pvt Burgett included suffered Jump Injuries, which put a halt to their training until they were well enough to continue, after which they would catch up with the unit, which moved out to Camp Mackall upon completing the Parachute School.
The Knollwood Maneuvers, North Carolina, December 1943.
By late December 1943 the Army High Command had become disenchanted with the idea of Parachute Troops, to the point where they were contemplating dissolving the existing Airborne Divisions in favour of independent Battalions, which could be attached to regular Divisions for use in sabotage and deception operations. The 82nd Airborne Division had jumped into Sicily at this point and a mixture of misdrops and friendly fire had the High Command concerned about the practicality of large scale airdrops of troopers. General Dwight D. Eisenhower, later Overall Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, famously said: "I do not believe in the Airborne Division..."
In order to decide whether to keep or disband the Airborne Units it was decided to hold a 2 week maneuver to assess the fate of Airborne Troops, this was the Knollwood Maneuvers.
By this time the 541st was a part of the Strategic Reserve held in the United States. The Regiment was chosen alongside the 11th and 17th Airborne Divisions to participate in the Maneuvers. The future of Airborne Troops was resting on the shoulders of these men and they approached the task with determination to preserve their branch of service. 
Despite foul weather the maneuvers were a resounding success and the future of Airborne Troopers was safe. The 541st performed particularly well, scoring high marks and making a good account of themselves.
However, despite their good performance and obviously being ready for movement overseas, the men of the 541st were still held in Reserve, watching as their counterparts in the 11th and 17th Airborne Divisions were deployed overseas. To further add to their disappointment the 541st was tasked with providing replacements for the 101st and 82nd Airborne Divisions overseas. As a result many original members of the 541st were on hand to participate in the Invasion of Normandy.
Strategic Reserve, USA.
After the end of the Knollwood Maneuvers, training continued for the 541st. A new group of men came into the outfit, to replace those lost to units overseas, and the Regiment began a 13 week Airborne Infantry Training Cycle. One of these men was Billy Tom Lusk, a young draftee, later a Sergeant of a Machine Gun Squad, who had taken Infantry Basic Training, volunteered for the Army Air Corps, been recalled to the Infantry and volunteered for the Paratroopers to get out of the 71st Infantry Division and get overseas and into the action.
He remembers spending most of 1944 doing problems in the field, Jumping onto the DZ on Monday and staying until Friday of Saturday. He was not happy with the assignment, remembering that the unit never went to the field without sustaining a few casualties from friendly fire, as well as the inherent jump injuries.
Lusk became disenchanted with the unit and when it became obvious that they weren't getting overseas he volunteered for OCS. The war ended before he graduated, so he dropped out and discharged, having never gotten overseas as he wished.
The Regiment moved back and forward between Fort Benning and Camp Mackall, demonstrating Airborne Tactics for dignitaries, developing new tactics and technique, and providing cadre for new Airborne Units being raised, like the 13th Airborne Division.
Then in July 1945 the Regiment was alerted for movement to the Pacific Theatre of Operations, pending an assignment to the 11th Airborne Division.
The Pacific Theatre.
The Regiment arrived at Manila in the Philippines waiting to be attached to the 11th Airborne, which was preparing to Jump on the Japanese Homeland. However much to the disappointment of the men of the 541st, the Regiment was deactivated and absorbed into the 11th Airborne ranks.
The 541st, after three years of dedication and waiting, was no more.
Soon thereafter the Atomic Bomb was dropped and the Second World War came to an end. The 11th Airborne Division moved to Mainland Japan as an occupation force, taking the men of the former 541st with it.

Maud Junction railway station

Maud Junction railway station was a railway station in Maud, Aberdeenshire now housing the Maud Railway Museum. It served as junction where the line north from Aberdeen split into two routes to the coastal town stations of Peterhead and Fraserburgh, both of which are now closed.
History.
The 29 mile long railway from Dyce to Mintlaw opened on 18 July 1861, with the extension to Peterhead opening the following year. The final section north to Fraserburgh opened in 1865. Dyce was on the Great North of Scotland Railway north from Aberdeen Waterloo station. The line was built by the Formartine and Buchan Railway Company, which became part of the GNSR in 1866. In 1923 the GNSR was incorporated into the London and North Eastern Railway, which was in turn nationalised on 1 January 1948. Passenger services on the Buchan lines were withdrawn in 1965 as part of the Beeching cuts. Freight trains continued to operate to Peterhead until 1970 and Fraserburgh until 1979. The track through Maud station was subsequently lifted.
Maud Junction was a major railhead for N. E. Scotland cattle transport. An auction mart in the village was the source of Aberdeenshire beef cattle for transport to all parts of Great Britain. On market days special arrangements were made to accommodate heavy cattle traffic on the single track line to Dyce given the shortage of sidings at Maud.
There was no engine shed at Maud, even though it had a turntable. Each morning a locomotive came down from Fraserburgh to collect the Fraserburgh coaches from the first train from Aberdeen which then proceeded to Peterhead. The last engine at night went back 'light engine' to the Fraserburgh shed.
Current status.
Today the station building houses the small Maud Railway Museum and some vacant business units. The museum can be opened by special request to Aberdeenshire Council. Great North of Scotland Railway Association volunteers open the museum on selected weekends most years. The station site is open to be explored and has been mainly preserved but the track is lifted. The remains of the turntable can be seen, along with the cattle loading platforms.
The Formartine and Buchan Way long distance footpath follows the line of the old track.

Along with Johann Adam Schall von Bell he was a leading figure among the fifty German Jesuits who between 1650 and 1750 worked in the Chinese missions. He entered the Society of Jesus on 4 October 1696, and taught mathematics and Hebrew from 1712 to 1714 in the University of Ingolstadt. Mederer, "Annal. acad.

He left Prague for Portugal in 1715, being joined by the noted Czech sinologist Karel Slavíček. In Lisboa a Portuguese Jesuit joined them. On March 13, 1716 they left for China. It took them 170 days to get there, surviving a major storm, during which many of their belongings were damaged. 
On account of his wide learning he enjoyed consideration at the imperial court, and held the office of president of the mathematical astronomical tribunal for thirty years. He was a mandarin of the second class, and was from 1731 a member of the supreme court of equity (Li-pu), a position which had never before been held by a foreigner ("Welt-Bott", No. 676). In accepting these positions he refused the stipends attached to them. 
Father August von Hallerstein, his co-operator and successor, considers him "one of the most cultivated minds that ever came into these countries" (ibid., No. 587). Kögler carried on a brisk scientific correspondence with a number of European scholars, such as Eusebius Amort and T. S.

"Miscellanea Berolinensia", 1737, pp. 185, 189 sqq.; Gottfr. von Murr, "Journal", VII, 240 sqq.; IX, 81 sq.; "Neues Journal", I, 147 sqq.; II, 303, sqq.). 
He was twice visitor of the mission, and provincial of the Chinese and Japanese province, and, during the persecution which began under Emperor Yung Cheng, he was the main support of the mission, through his influence at court. He died, aged 65, at Beijing.

Morley, Alberta

Morley is a First Nations settlement within the Stoney 142/143/144 Indian reserve in southern Alberta, Canada. It is located along the Canadian Pacific Railway between the Trans-Canada Highway and the Bow River, upstream from Ghost Lake. It has an elevation of . The settlement is located in census division No. 15 and in the federal riding of Wild Rose. The settlement and the Indian reserve are part of the Stoney Nation.
The historic McDougall Memorial United Church is located a few miles from Morley. Built in 1875, it is southern Alberta's oldest surviving Protestant church and the oldest remaining structure in the Bow Valley. It was once a part of Morleyville, the oldest pioneer settlement in southern Alberta and home to its first herd of breeding cattle. Founded by the Methodist missionary George McDougall and his sons as a missionary outpost, Morleyville existed until 1921 when a new church was built in the present settlement of Morley, which had developed around the Morley Indian Agency building. The old church is now a provincial historic site. Other milestones in the settlement's history include the construction at Morley in 1920 of the first airport established by the Canada Air Board and the 1969 establishment of Canada's first magistrate's court to be held in a First Nations owned building on First Nations land.
History.
Settlement in the Morley area began with the arrival of the Methodist missionary John McDougall and his wife in 1873 to establish a missionary outpost in the Bow Valley for outreach to the Nakoda (Stoney) and Siksika (Blackfoot) First Nations. They founded the mission at the request of John's father, George McDougall, the superintendent of Methodist missionary work in western Canada. The site John chose was originally called Ghost River, but he renamed it Morleyville in honour of his friend Morley Punshon, an Ontario doctor.
John McDougall and his wife began their work by constructing a two room log shack with a sod roof for themselves and a small church. Shortly thereafter, the McDougalls moved their fledgling outpost to a new site to the south, closer to the river. In 1875, they built a larger church with the help of George McDougall and Andrew Sibbald, a carpenter and teacher. Logs and boards laboriously fashioned from local timber with a whipsaw were used to build the one room church. Aside from the framed gable ends, the exterior surface of the log walls remained unfinished, but the interior surfaces were daubed with mud and painted white, except for the paneled end walls. Around 1900, the log walls were covered with board-and-batten siding and a steeple was built. It is southern Alberta's oldest remaining Protestant church, the oldest remaining structure in the Bow Valley, and is the province's earliest example of a building constructed in the carpenter gothic style still standing at the place of its original construction.
David McDougall later joined his brother John at Morleyville and helped to found the Indian Trading Post. In its early days, some seven hundred First Nations people visited the post to barter animal skins for food, blankets, stockings, and prints. The homes and the trading post were enclosed by a stockade of heavy logs erected to provide defense in case a party of First Nations warriors attempted a raid. The outpost became a hub for settlers coming into the Bow Valley and reached a population of over two hundred at its peak; Morleyville was southern Alberta's first pioneer settlement. A school, orphanage, missionary residences, barns and corrals were built. Southern Alberta's first herd of breeding cattle supplied Morleyville's residents with meat and milk. Sibbald, one of Alberta's first trained teachers, taught at the school.
Morleyville's early prominence declined in the 1880s after the Canadian Pacific transcontinental railroad bypassed the settlement as it was routed through the valley on the opposite side of the Bow River. John McDougall and his wife remained there until their retirement to Calgary in 1898. The church remained in use until 1921 when it was replaced by a new church located a few miles away at a First Nations settlement that developed around an Indian Agency building. This newer settlement is the present-day Morley. The old settlement and its church stood abandoned until volunteers affiliated with the United Church of Canada formed the Morley Church Restoration Society. Work was completed in 1952 and the restored church continues to be used for weddings and special occasions. The building has been declared a provincial historic site and is listed in the Canadian Register of Historic Places; a historical marker at the site describes its significance. The McDougall Stoney Mission Society currently maintains the church and the surrounding fifty acres of ecologically significant native prairie that has never been disturbed by agricultural activities.
The first airport and test station to be established by the Canada Air Board began operation at Morley in 1920. It was equipped with six Airco DH.9A aircraft used for aerial reconnaissance of Banff National Park, forestry ranging in the Rocky Mountain Foothills, and aerial firefighting.
In 1969, Morley hosted the first magistrate's court in Canada to be held in a First Nations owned building located on First Nations land.
Demographics.
Statistics Canada has not recently published a population for Morley.
However, Industry Canada shows that Morley's greater rural area had a total population of 35 living in 8 dwellings in 2001. With a land area of , its greater rural area has a population density of .

Kirani James

Kirani James (born 1 September 1992) is a Grenadian sprinter who specializes in the 200 and 400 metres. He won the 400 m at the World Championships in 2011 and is the reigning Olympic champion, winning the 400 metres at London 2012. He was Grenada's first Olympic medalist in any sport.
Prodigious from a young age, he ran the fastest 400 m times ever by a 14-year-old and a 15-year-old. He won a series of gold medals at the CARIFTA Games and the Commonwealth Youth Games and rose on the international stage with 400 m silver medals at the 2007 World Youth and 2008 World Junior Championships. James became the first athlete to run a 200/400 double at the 2009 World Youth Championships and was the 2010 World Junior Champion.
James received an athletic scholarship at the University of Alabama and won back-to-back NCAA Outdoor Championship titles in his first two years. He is the third fastest of all-time indoors (44.80 seconds) and ran a personal best of 43.94 at the 2012 Olympic Games. James is one of only nine athletes (along with Valerie Adams, Usain Bolt, Veronica Campbell-Brown, Jacques Freitag, Yelena Isinbayeva, Jana Pittman, Dani Samuels and David Storl) to win world championships at the youth, junior, and senior level of an athletic event.
Career.
Youth career.
At the age of 14 James won the gold medal in the 400 m at the 2007 CARIFTA Games in the under 17 category with a time of 47.86 seconds. He went on to win silver medals at the 2007 World Youth Championships with a time of 46.96 s, a time which is the fastest run by a 14-year-old.
In April 2008 he defended his CARIFTA 400 m title, winning the 200 metres with a time of 21.38 s. In July that year, he won a silver medal at the 2008 World Junior Championships with a time of 45.70 s, which is his personal best nation youth and junior record and the fastest time ever run by a 15-year-old. In October, he won the gold medal at the 2008 Commonwealth Youth Games with a new games record of 46.66 s.
James made his third CARIFTA Games appearance in 2009 and, in his under-20 debut, he defeated the defending 400 m champion and fellow Grenadian Rondell Bartholomew to win in a personal best of 45.45 s. This easily set a new championship record, beating Usain Bolt's six-year-old mark of 46.35 s. In consequence, he was awarded the Austin Sealy Trophy for the most outstanding athlete of the games.
James became the first youth athlete to complete a 200/400 metres double gold at the 2009 World Youth Championships in Athletics. Noting that he would be a junior athlete for a further two years, he focused on upcoming events, pinpointing the 2010 World Junior Championships in Athletics and the 2012 Summer Olympics as future goals. Following this, he won the 400 m at the 2009 Pan American Junior Championships. He was declared the 2009 Grenada Sportsman of the Year.
College athletics.
At least ten colleges in the United States had expressed strong interest in recruiting James for their track team, including Baylor, Alabama, South Carolina, Florida State, and Arizona State. He accepted a scholarship offer from Alabama and in his first ever appearance on an indoor track he ran a 45.79 in the 400 meters, placing first and breaking the 10-year-old school record of 46.46 held by Cori Loving.
James ran a new indoor personal best of 20.94 in the 200 m dash at the Texas A&M Challenge at Gilliam Indoor Track Stadium in College Station, Texas on 13 February 2010. He was runner-up at the NCAA Indoor Championships, finishing behind Torrin Lawrence. James lowered his 400 m personal best to 45.02 s at the 2010 CARIFTA Games, where he took a 200/400 m double, and improved further to 45.01 in winning the SEC Championships 400 m title. He claimed the gold medal over 400 m at the 2010 World Junior Championships in Athletics, but stated he was only running for times and was not satisfied with his winning performance of 45.89 seconds. He won the NCAA Outdoor Championship title in his first year of collegiate competition.
James moved up to third on the all-time indoor lists in February 2011, recording 44.80 seconds to win at the SEC Indoor Championships. This left only Michael Johnson and Kerron Clement as the faster athletes indoors, and also bettered LaShawn Merritt's previous world best junior time of 44.93 seconds. He failed to reach the podium at the NCAA Indoor meet as he clashed with another athlete and fell mid-race. He managed to repeat as the collegiate champion outdoors, however, as he edged ahead of Gil Roberts by one hundredth of a second. After the end of the college season, he made his professional debut at the London Grand Prix Diamond League meeting and established himself among the world's best with a personal best run of 44.61 seconds – a time which made him the fastest man that year.
Professional career.
At the 2011 World Championships in Daegu, South Korea, both James and fellow Grenadian runner Rondell Bartholomew made the finals of the 400m event. James won the event in a personal best of 44.60 seconds, becoming the youngest 400m world champion at the age of 18. The medal is the first for Grenada in any event at the World championships in athletics. Nine days later, James won the 400m at the 2011 IAAF Diamond League in Zürich with a new personal best of 44.36 seconds.
At the London 2012 Olympics, James won the 400m semi final 2, achieving a season best of 44.59 seconds. At the end of the race, James exchanged name tags with double-amputee runner Oscar Pistorius as a sign of respect for him.
On 6 August 2012, James won the 400m Olympic gold in a time of 43.94, a national record, earning Grenada its first Olympic medal. He was the first non-US runner to break the 44-second mark. World record holder Michael Johnson said, following the race, that James stood a chance of beating his record if he was able to deal with the remaining flaws in his technique. James described his win as "a huge step for our country in terms of stepping up to the plate in track and field, just going out there and putting us on the map."
His domestic reception proved to be a euphoric one. Thousands lined the street in preparation of his return, and he was greeted with an emphatic and vociferous national pride. Also upon his arrival the Prime Minister Tillman Thomas announced Mr. James would be bequeathed government bonds totaling up to EC500,000, a commemorative stamp be crafted in his honor, a new stadium be named for him, and that he would be appointed a tourism ambassador.
In December 2012, James and Jamaica's Usain Bolt were named co-sportsmen of the year by "Caribbean Journal".

Home Building &amp; Loan Association v. Blaisdell

__NOTOC__
Home Building & Loan Association v. Blaisdell, 290 U.S. 398 (1934), was a decision of the United States Supreme Court holding that Minnesota's suspension of creditors' remedies was not in violation of the United States Constitution. "Blaisdell" was decided during the depth of the Great Depression and has been criticized by modern conservative and libertarian commentators. 
Background and decision.
In 1933, in response to a large number of home foreclosures, Minnesota, like many other states at the time, extended the time available for mortgagors to redeem their mortgages from foreclosure. The extension had the effect of enlarging the mortgagor's estate contrary to the terms of the contract.
The Supreme Court upheld the statute, reasoning that the emergency conditions created by the Great Depression "may justify the exercise of State's continuing and dominant protective power notwithstanding interference with contracts." "Blaisdell" was the first time the court extended the emergency exception to purely economic emergencies.
While the "Blaisdell" judgment itself might have been held to apply only in limited instances of economic emergency, by the late 1930s the emergency exception doctrine had expanded dramatically.
Criticism.
Adherents of the Chicago school of economics have characterized "Blaisdell" among the Court precedents that have diminished constitutional protection of individual property rights. Richard Epstein's (the Laurence A. Tisch Professor of Law at the New York University School of Law and Adjunct Scholar at the American libertarian think tank Cato Institute) criticisms have been some of the most vocal:

The Isaac Hayes Movement (album)

The Isaac Hayes Movement was the third studio album released by Isaac Hayes. Released in 1970, it was the follow-up to "Hot Buttered Soul", Hayes' landmark 1969 album. Marvell Thomas had come up with "The Isaac Hayes Movement" as a name for Hayes' backup ensemble. He modeled the name after the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Similar in structure to "Hot Buttered Soul", "The Isaac Hayes Movement" features only four long tracks, all with meticulous, complex and heavily orchestrated arrangements. However, unlike the previous album, this time all four songs are reworked covers of others' material. This includes Jerry Butler's "I Stand Accused", which features a nearly five-minute long spoken intro that precedes the actual song, and The Beatles' "Something", which features violin soloing by John Blair. The other two songs included on the album were the Bacharach-David song, "I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myself" and Chalmers and Rhodes' "One Big Unhappy Family".
Released in November 1970,"The Isaac Hayes Movement" spent a total of seven weeks at #1 on "Billboard's" Soul Albums chart and remained in the top ten until the last week of November in that year. The album also reached #1 on the Jazz Albums chart and spent 75 weeks on the Billboard 200 chart, peaking at #8. An edited version of "I Stand Accused" was released as a single in July 1970. It reached #23 on the Soul Singles chart and #42 on the Pop chart.

Sha'ir

A "sha'ir" was a pre-Islamic Arab poet believed to have magical powers.
History.
The origin of the term "sha'ir" is unknown. The ancient Arab culture viewed the "sha'ir" as a type of wizard, able to commune with supernatural forces, or "djinni", for both knowledge and power. Members of the tribe treated "sha'ir" as oracles and wisemen. The poems and songs of the "sha'ir" inspired tribe members during war, and were considered powerful weapons. "Sha'ir" also served as advisors to rulers.

J.W. Childs Associates

J.W. Childs Associates (JWC) is a private equity firm focused on leveraged buyout and recapitalization transactions for middle-market growth companies. JWC places particular emphasis on consumer products, healthcare and specialty retail companies. 
The company is headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts and was founded in 1995 by longtime buyout investor John W. Childs, who had previously been the number two partner at large-cap Boston-based private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners.
History.
The firm was founded in 1995 by long-time leveraged buyout investor John W. Childs after a split from Thomas H. Lee. Prior to founding J.W. Childs Associates, from 1987 through 1995 Childs had been a managing director and subsequently the senior managing director of Thomas H. Lee Partners (THL). While at THL, Childs had helped negotiate the buyouts of Snapple Beverages and Ghirardelli Chocolate Company, along with others of the firm's largest investmeents. From 1971 through 1987, Childs had held various investment positions at the Prudential Insurance Company of America.
J.W. Childs completed a number of large leveraged buyouts including takeovers of several of the following notable companies: Nutrasweet, Chevy's, Empire Kosher, Equinox Fitness, South Beach Beverage Company and Edison Schools.
Additionally, the firm has raised approximately $3.1 billion of investor commitments in three private equity funds:
The firm began "premarketing" its fourth private equity fund in early 2006, with a target size of $2.5 billion. However, in mid-2007, J.W. Childs decided to postpone the fundraising process because institutional investors were proving less receptive to the offering than had been expected. Performance at two of the firm's previous funds was below median for their respective vintage years and many investment professionals resigned from the firm. Additionally, the fundraising environment for private equity firms became increasingly difficult with the onset of the 2007-2008 credit crunch.
In March 2008, following the failed fundraising for JW Childs Equity Partners IV, JWC registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a $200 million IPO of J.W. Childs Acquisition I Corp., a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company(SPAC). Several "fallen" buyout professionals have pursued SPACs (most notably Thomas O. Hicks, formerly of Hicks Muse Tate & Furst) to raise capital when the more common institutional market is unreceptive.

Tapis (Philippine clothing)

Among cultures in the Philippines, Tapis may generally refer to a single rectangular piece of cloth one wraps around oneself as clothing, but usually specifically applies to a colorful hand-woven wraparound skirt which was commonly used by women throughout the Philippines before the arrival of European colonizers, and which is used by some indigenous tribes today.
The tapis worn by the Cordilleran women of Northern Luzon, known locally as the "alampay", are the most prominent example.
It is worn by wrapping the cloth around one's waist and holding the ends together with the use of a tightly tied sash. It generally reaches down to knee length, and the weaving pattern of describes the culture and temperament of the wearer's tribe.
Broader usage (verb).
Another use of the term, as a verb, simply means to wrap a piece of cloth around one's body to cover it up. A person who does so is said to be "nagtatapis" (putting on a tapis). This usage of the term does not require that the piece of cloth that you wear in the Philippines
In historical record.
The Tapis has been in use in the Philippine archipelago since at least the indigenous period that came before the arrival of European colonists. Those colonists would take note of this particular mode of dress, considering it immodest. Spanish chroniclers from the early period noted that this mode of dress remained common on many islands despite Spanish efforts to introduce what they considered more suitable clothing. The felt that the tight profile of the tapis on a female wearer was revealing, and made even worse by the often sheer fabric of the cloth. One noted that the tapis became even more revealing whenever the wearer was caught in the rain, or had just taken a bath. The locals, however, did not consider the revealing properties of the tapis to be immodest. Among the lowland peoples who came under the full influence of the Spanish, this would soon change as Christianization and Hispanization brought along a much more conservative culture, and along with it, a mode of dress that emphasized modesty. The tapis would continue to be worn, but not in public venues, and usually only in more intimate locales such as ones own home. The tapis saw continued use among upland peoples, but as their upland environments were colder, their variation of the tapis tended to be thicker and thus less revealing.

Alexander Vassiliev

Alexander Vassiliev (; born 1962) is a Russian journalist, writer, and espionage historian living in London. A former officer in the Soviet Committee for State Security (KGB), Vassiliev is known for his two books based upon KGB archival documents: "Spies: The Rise and Fall of the KGB in America", co-authored with John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr, and "The Haunted Wood: Soviet Espionage in America: the Stalin Era," co-authored with Allen Weinstein.
Biography.
Early years.
Alexander Vassiliev was born in Moscow, Russia — then the capital of the Soviet Union — on May 1, 1962.
Vassiliev joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1983 while he was a student at Moscow State University (MGU). He graduated from MGU with a degree in journalism in 1984.
Vassiliev was married in 1983 and fathered a son in 1986. He was divorced in 2009.
Vassiliev worked in the international department of "Komsomolskaya Pravda" (Young Communists' Truth) from 1984 to 1985. In 1985, he became a student in the Andropov Red Banner Institute of the KGB of the USSR, completing his studies there in 1987.
Career in Russia.
Vassiliev worked as an operative of the First (American) Department of the First Chief Directorate of the KGB from 1987 to 1990.
In February 1990, Vassiliev resigned from the KGB for political and moral reasons. He resigned from the Communist Party in that same year. He returned to the editorial staff of "Komsomolskaya Pravda," where he worked as a reporter and then columnist, writing mostly about international issues and espionage from 1990 to 1996. He also worked as an author and presenter of several political shows on the First Channel of the Russian TV ("Ostankino") from 1991 to 1993.
In the summer of 1993, Vassiliev received a telephone call from Iurii Kobaladze, press officer of the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) of the Russian Federation, requesting a meeting. Kobaladze asked Vassiliev to participate in a book project with Crown Publishers, a division of Random House, which had arranged for a five book series based upon KGB archival documents, each edited by one Russian and one American editor. The SVR (successor to the KGB), was in the midst of a budgetary crisis and sought to improve its image as an effective service and had agreed to the proposal. Although having misgivings, Vassiliev finally agreed to work on a book dealing with Soviet Espionage in America in the 1930s and 1940s as part of the project.
In the fall of 1993, Vassiliev signed a book contract and met the American chosen by Crown to work with him, historian Allen Weinstein, a specialist in the Alger Hiss spy case. Vassiliev quit his television job and in early 1994 began to work on the book project in earnest, working with archival documents provided at the press bureau of the SVR.
Documents housed in SVR archives were carried to Vassiliev at the SVR press office; he was allowed to made copious notes both summarizing and transcribing their content in the presence of two SVR officers. Although locked up in a safe each night with the archival material, no one checked what he was writing and Vassiliev was allowed to take notebooks home as he filled one and brought in another. A total of eight notebooks were kept, along with a number of unbound pages. Vassiliev later recalled that he attempted to transcribe as many documents as possible verbatim and painstakingly noted archival file and document numbers for each.
The writing of draft chapters for Vassiliev's first book, "The Haunted Wood: Soviet Espionage in America — The Stalin Era," began in 1995, with each vetted by the SVD Declassification Commission, the head of the archives department, and Kobaladze. Vassiliev was unable to name Americans who assisted Soviet intelligence in his draft chapters owing to SVR regulations which forbid the "outing" of agents and sources, so cover names were used in Vassiliev's draft. Many cover names were already well known in the United States, however, and American author Weinstein had little difficulty understanding who was who and retained control over the final draft.
Beginning in 1995, the political environment began to change in Russia, Vassiliev later recalled, with the popularity of Boris Yeltsin plummeting and an anxious mood sweeping the country. A conservative nationalistic restoration seemed to be in the offing, headed by Russian Presidential candidate Gennady Ziuganov. Adding to the difficulty, Crown Publishing found it necessary to cancel the five volume book deal for financial reasons, throwing the entire project into doubt. In January 1996, Vassiliev was informed that he would be receiving no new files from the archives.
Emigration.
Feeling a communist-nationalist restoration somewhat likely and their own safety tenuous, Alexander Vassiliev and his wife Elena decided to emigrate to Great Britain in 1996, leaving his precious notebooks with trusted friends for safekeeping rather than risking losing them to inquisitive officials at the airport. Copies of his draft chapters for "The Haunted Wood" were transferred to computer disks and some key documents were transcribed prior to their leaving. The resulting book based upon these materials was published in the United States by Random House in 1999.
The years 2001 to 2003 were filled with two legal actions related to "The Haunted Wood." After losing his cases in June 2003, Vassiliev took some time away from the bitter subject which had taken the last ten years of his life. Then in 2005 he became interested in Wikipedia and decided to check the article for Alger Hiss to see how accurate it was. At the end of the article was an to the website of historian John Earl Haynes, on which Vassiliev found a document in his own handwriting which he had introduced at his London trial, along with some comments questioning the accuracy of the document. Vassiliev wrote a letter to Haynes attempting to set the matter straight — and a book collaboration project was born.
Vassiliev managed to recover his original notebooks with transcriptions and summaries of secret Soviet foreign intelligence archival documents and these served as the core of a second publication. In May 2009, Yale University Press published "Spies: The Rise and Fall of the KGB in America," co-authored by Haynes, Vassiliev, and Harvey Klehr of Emory University, another widely recognized scholar in the field of American communist history.
Upon completion of the project, Vassiliev donated his original notebooks to the U.S. Library of Congress. The contents of these were scanned in original film, transcribed into Russian, and translated into English, and are now available online in all three forms through the Cold War International History Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.
Vassiliev worked in the BBC Russian Service as an online producer from 2000 to 2009. He served as a co-publisher, editor, and designer of "The Hyde Park," a Russian magazine in London, from 2004 to 2006.
In 2009, Vassiliev published his first novel, an espionage thriller called "Russian Sector." This book was released in both Russian-language and English-language editions.
As of 2010, Vassiliev was living in London and working full-time as a writer and publisher. Vassiliev's current endeavor involves the editing and publication of parallel Russian-English texts of classic Russian literature for language students. The initial titles in the series included works by Mikhail Lermontov, Anton Chekhov, and Leo Tolstoy. Similar French-English parallel texts are also planned, with "Madame Bovary" by Gustav Flaubert released in 2010.
Legal battles.
Alexander Vassiliev vs Frank Cass.
Vassiliev launched two lawsuits in association with "The Haunted Wood," representing himself as a litigant in person in both cases.
In July 2001, Vassiliev sued for libel Frank Cass & Co., publisher of the journal "Intelligence and National Security", in The High Court of Justice in London, over the article "Venona and Alger Hiss" by John Lowenthal, published in Autumn 2000 issue of the journal.
In January 2003 Frank Cass's lawyers offered Alexander Vassiliev to settle the monetary claim for more than 2,000 British pounds and promised not to republish the John Lowenthal article. Vassiliev rejected the offer. In May 2003 Frank Cass proposed to settle the case for 7500 pounds, but Vassiliev rejected that offer, too.
The trial "Vassiliev vs Frank Cass" started on June 9, 2003 and concluded on June 13, 2003, with Judge David Eady presiding. Frank Cass & Co. prevailed on the basis of "fair comment."
Alexander Vassiliev vs Amazon.com.
Also in July 2001, Vassiliev sued Amazon.com for libel over allegedly defamatory assertions published by John Lowenthal, lawyer and friend of Alger Hiss, on its "The Haunted Wood" page. Lowenthal's hostile review declared that Vassiliev and Weinstein's book, "particularly in its use of KGB archival files, is unreliable and, for the most part, unverifiable. Where it is verifiable at all, it turns out to be wrong."
The judge decided that the contents of John Lowenthal's allegations in the article and in his review published on Amazon.com were similar, and there was no need to have a trial of Alexander Vassiliev vs Amazon.com, which meant Vassiliev lost that one as well. Amazon.com defense was based mostly on the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which it claimed gave them immunity from prosecution.
On June 3, 2002 the contents of John Lowenthal’s review of "The Haunted Wood" were altered.

Samuel Butler (cricketer)

Samuel Evan Butler (born 15 April 1850 at Colombo, British Ceylon; died 30 April 1903 at Combe Hay, Bath, Somerset, England) was an English cricketer. In the University Match of 1871 he took all ten Cambridge University wickets in their first innings, the only time this has been achieved in the fixture, and (as of March 2013) the only time an Oxford bowler has taken ten wickets in any first-class innings.
He captured five more wickets in the second innings, for fifteen in the match, assisting Oxford University to win by eight wickets. His figures were 10/38 and 5/57. His "Wisden" obituary says of him: "On that one afternoon at Lord's he was unplayable, but he never afterwards approached the same form."
His first-class career lasted only from 1870 to 1874; after leaving Oxford in 1873 he played in only two further first-class matches, both in 1874. 16 of his 21 matches were played for Oxford, the remainder being for various "Gentlemen" sides. He was a right-arm roundarm fast bowler and a right-handed batsman. "Wisden" says that he "possessed great pace". He took 106 wickets in his career at an average of 14.33, ten times taking five wickets or more in an innings and three times ten or more in a match. He was a negligible batsman, managing 256 runs at an average of 9.14, with a highest score of only 31.
On the strength of his performance in the 1871 University Match, he was chosen for the Gentlemen against the Players that year both at Lord's and the Oval, but he did nothing of note with the ball and made a duck in all three of his innings.
In the 1873 University Match, he took 5/48 in Cambridge's first innings, helping Oxford to win a close match by three wickets.

The Union of Orthodox Banner-Bearers

The Union of Orthodox Banner-Bearers is a Russian nationalist-fundamentalist organization that identifies itself as part of the Russian Orthodox Church, co-founded in 1993 by Leonid Simonovich. The Union's stated primary aim is to "resurrect the spirit" of Russian Orthodoxy, by conducting processions with banners and icons in Moscow and the regions.
The group became famous for its use and promulgation of the phrase "Orthodoxy or Death," and its association with violent skinhead reactionaries. In 2009 Patriarch Kirill denounced this slogan and to "beware" those who used it, calling it “dangerous, false and intrinsically contradictory.” A Moscow court later upheld the decision by denouncing the phrase as "extremist."

Orpheus with Clay Feet

Orpheus with Clay Feet is a science fiction short story by Philip K. Dick originally published in 1964 in "Escapade" magazine. The story has a self referential time travel theme, and was published under the pen name "Jack Dowland".
Synopsis.
The main character is Jesse Slade, a bored man living in 2040 who visits a time travel tourism agency for a vacation. The agency offers him a trip to the past where he can act as the muse for a famous artist of his choice. Slade chooses to inspire his favorite science fiction author of the 1960s, Jack Dowland, who is said to be universally acclaimed as the greatest of the three master science fiction authors of his time, the others being Isaac Asimov and Robert A. Heinlein. 
Slade travels to Purpleblossom, Nevada, in 1956, where he is to inspire the writing of Dowland's masterpiece, "The Father on the Wall". On his arrival, he has difficulty communicating, and is so unable to impress Dowland that he desperately discloses his identity as a time traveller. Dowland is so irritated at this that he becomes cynical about science fiction altogether, and never becomes the master that he might have been.
Self reference.
The story makes several references to itself and its author. Dowland's masterpiece, "The Father on the Wall", has a title very similar to Dick's masterpiece, "The Man in the High Castle". Jack Dowland, the fictional author featured in the story, was the pen name used by Dick when the story itself was published. In the story, Dowland takes Slade's tale about time travelling muses and publishes it as a science fiction short story called "Orpheus with Clay Feet" under the pen name "Philip K. Dick". After Slade's return to the future, Slade and the time travel agent read Dowland's published story. The agent (who calls it a "wretched story") decides what to do with Slade after he reads about his own actions in the published story, saying "that's how he resolved it in the end".

Truce of Vilna

Truce/Treaty of Vilna or Truce/Treaty of Niemieża () was a treaty signed at Niemieża (modern Nemėžis) near Vilnius () (also known as Vilna) on 3 November 1656 between Tsardom of Russia and Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, introducing a truce during the Russo-Polish War (1654–67) and an anti-Swedish alliance in the contemporaneous Second Northern War. In return for ceasing hostilities and fighting Sweden alongside Poland–Lithuania, the treaty promised Alexis of Russia succession in Poland after John II Casimir Vasa's death. The cossacks under Bohdan Khmelnytsky were excluded from the negotiations, and subsequently supported the Transylvanian invasion on the Swedish side.
Developments.
After a series of successes for the Russian forces, with an even more successful Swedish invasion of Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the Russian tsar decided that total defeat of the Commonwealth and Swedish victory leading to major strengthening of Sweden (a threat to Russia) would not be in the best interests of Russia.
The negotiations began in Autumn of 1655, between Field Hetman of Lithuania Wincenty Korwin Gosiewski and Russian commander Afanasy Ordin-Nashchokin, and led to a quick ceasefire along the Polish-Russian front, allowing the Commonwealth to concentrate on the Swedish incursion. In the light of its successes, the Commonwealth's stance in the negotiations intensified, and it has rejected Russian territorial demands; however both Poland and Russia agreed to continue engaging Sweden. There were also negotiations about the Russian tsar or his descendant ascending to the Commonwealth's throne (see Polish–Lithuanian–Muscovite Commonwealth). Russian forces marched on Swedish Livonia and besieged Riga in the Russo-Swedish War (1656–58). The Russian ally, Zaporozhian Cossack hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky was informed about the Russian plans; he was not against a temporary armistice with Poland as such; but he was afraid of an alliance between Muscovy and Poland aimed at crushing Cossack rebellion as a possible consequence of the treaty. 
In 1658 the Russo-Polish war would resume, with another Russian invasion of the Commonwealth territories.

Adonis Stevenson

Stevenson Adonis (born 22 September 1977 in Port-au-Prince, Haiti) is a Haitian-born Canadian professional boxer, who inverts his family name and given name, boxing as Adonis Stevenson and using the nickname "Superman". Although Stevenson usually fights as a super middleweight, as of December 1, 2013 he is the reigning Lineal, WBC, and "The Ring" light heavyweight champion. Stevenson won those titles from former champion Chad Dawson in his adopted hometown of Montreal.
In the amateur, he was Quebec Middleweight champion in 2004, best amateur fighter of the country in 2005-2006, and he also grabbed the Canada national title in 2005 and 2006. Stevenson competed in the XVIII Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, Australia in 2006 and won the silver medal losing to Local Australian, Jarrod Fletcher in the final. It was also the only medal a Canadian boxer received at the games.
He has a record of 33-5 in amateur contests.
Professional career.
Stevenson turned professional in September 2006. 
On August 1, 2008, at Windsor Station in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, Stevenson defeated Anthony Bonsante by first round knockout. The two fighters came out of their corners for the fight with Bonsante launching the first attack, but just moments after the assault, Stevenson landed a left hand that sent Bonsante down to the canvas. Bonsante sprawled out on the canvas with his eyes closed, while the referee reached the count of six before stopping the fight. Bonsante had begun to get up at the count of six, but it was too late, leaving Bonsante livid with the decision as he chased the referee around the ring in an attempt to protest the decision, but to little avail. He also won a fifth round TKO decision against Jermain Mackey on September 25, 2009.
On April 17, 2010, in his first fight in the United States, which also was his first time fighting for promoter Lou DiBella, he suffered his first defeat being stopped in the second round by Darnell Boone. Boone had been knocked down on the canvas twice in the first round, however, in the second round, Stevenson rushed to Boone without maintaining his defense and he got caught by a solid right sending him on the canvas for the first time in his career. Stevenson managed to get back on his feet inside the count of 10, however, the referee ended the fight even if Stevenson seemed ready to continue the bout.
Nonetheless, Stevenson resumed with GYM Promotions and won the North American title NABA on April 8, 2011 at the expense of Derek Edwards by KO in the third round. He then won by referee stoppage in the first round against Dion Savage (Shujaa El-Amin) on September 17, 2011, and retained his title against Aaron Pryor Jr on December 10, 2011 by referee stoppage in the ninth round. Stevenson jumped from 15th to 2nd position for the IBF title, winning by KO in the first round duel against Jesus Gonzalez on February 18, 2012. He then fought Noe Gonzalez on April 20, 2012 and won the fight at 1:40 in the second round when the referee stopped the fight.
His next fight originally set to be against Don George with the winner getting a shot at the IBF champion. The fight was originally scheduled to be a co/main event of a fight card also including a match between Jean Pascal and Tavoris Cloud on August 11, 2012 but the even was cancelled due to an injury suffered by Pascal. The Stevenson fight was then moved up to August 17, 2012 and was set to be part part of ESPN Friday Night Fights, but Stevenson later injured his hand cancelling the fight. The fight was then rescheduled to October 12. In the fight Stevenson knocked George down twice in the fifth and once in the sixth round before winning the fight with a 12th round TKO after knocking him down twice more.
Stevenson avenged his only loss, knocking out Darnell Boone with a pair of lefts in the sixth round in March 22, 2013 at the Bell Centre. The left-hander, fighting at 171.9 pounds, forced Boone to take a knee with a right hook to the body early in the sixth, then stunned him coming out of a corner with a left uppercut, followed with a straight left that sent Boone on the canvas.
Stevenson moved up to light heavyweight to face Chad Dawson on June 8, 2013. Stevenson hit Dawson with a left hook that dropped him very early in the first round of the fight, and although Dawson got up before the count of eight the referee stopped the fight giving Stevenson an unexpected knockout victory. Stevenson's victory was his eighth straight since his only career defeat, all coming by knockout.
The WBC originally ordered Stevenson to face mandatory challenger Tony Bellew, but then allowed him to make a voluntary defense first against Tavoris Cloud, where the winner of the fight must face Bellew at a later date. 
On September 28, Stevenson fought Tavoris Cloud and started well. Stevenson dominated the precedings with quick hands and shocking power. The result ended when Cloud failed to answer the bell for the start of the eighth round.
On November 30, 2013, Stevenson defended his light heavyweight title against Tony Bellew at the Colisee Pepsi.

Pontygwaith, Rhondda

Pontygwaith (Welsh language: "Bridge to work" or "Bridge of the Ironworks") is a small village located in the Rhondda Fach valley in the county borough of Rhondda Cynon Taf, Wales.
History.
Pontygwaith takes its name from a blast furnace built in the early 16th century, though by 1863 it was described as "a shapeless ruin" The location of the furnace was at the north end of what today is Furnace Road and the only documented proof of the structure is in a contract drawn up in 1614 between John Hanbury of Pontypool and Richard ap Rhys of Llantrisant for the supply of charcoal to the ""furnace of Penrees"" (Penrhys).
Gwilym Elfed Davies, Labour Party Member of Parliament for Rhondda East 1959-74 and who went on to become elevated to the Peerage as Lord Davies of Penrhys, was born at Fenwick Street, Pontygwaith.
Transport.
Between 1849 and 1856, the Taff Vale Railway opened the Maerdy Branch from , including a station at . Passenger services were withdrawn in 1964, and the line closed completely and was lifted from June 1986 after coal from Mardy Colliery was raised through Tower Colliery. Since 2005, the southern section from Porth to Pontygwaith is now the A4223 Porth and Lower Rhondda Fach Relief Road (Porth Bypass). The upper section including the section passing Pontygwaith has become a branch of the Taff Trail cycleway.

Jason Furman

Jason Furman (born August 18, 1970) is an economist. On June 10, 2013, Furman was named by President Barack Obama as Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors (CEA). Previously, since January 28, 2009, Furman had served as the Deputy Director of the National Economic Council, which followed his role as an advisor to candidate Obama during the 2008 presidential campaign. Initially, Furman's appointment as a campaign adviser had been criticized by some labor activists.
Life and career.
Furman's research and policy focus includes the subjects of taxes, health care, and the U.S. Social Security program. Furman's qualified defense of Wal-Mart's business model provoked criticism from some labor organizations when he joined the 2008 Obama presidential campaign. 
Furman graduated from The Dalton School in 1988. In 1996, while he was a graduate student at Harvard Department of Economics, Furman was hired by economist Joseph Stiglitz to serve a one-year stint as Special Assistant to the President for Economic Policy in the Clinton Administration and on staff of the Council of Economic Advisers. He later worked with Stiglitz at the World Bank. Furman was involved to varying degrees with the Presidential campaigns of Al Gore and Wesley Clark, along with his wife, Eve Gerber, who also contributed as a speechwriter for Clark. In 2004, he took a position as Director of Economic Policy for the 2004 Kerry presidential campaign.
Furman received an MSc from the London School of Economics and in 2003 a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard University. His Ph.D. thesis advisor was N. Gregory Mankiw, who had once also served as Chairman of the CEA, during the administration of George W. Bush. Also at Harvard, Furman earned a bachelor's in social studies and a master's in government.
In recent years, Furman worked as a budget expert at the Brookings Institution. There, he worked with former Clinton Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and directed the Hamilton Project, an economic policy research group that develops policy proposals to achieve shared economic growth.
He was a Visiting Scholar at New York University's Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. He has been a visiting lecturer at Columbia and Yale Universities.
He and his wife Eve live in Washington, DC, with their two children, Henry and Louisa. The family also maintains an apartment in Greenwich Village.
Raised in New York City, Furman is the son of Jay Furman, a real-estate and shopping mall developer who donated more than $20 million to NYU and serves on its board of trustees. His mother, Gail Furman, a child psychologist, heads the family's Furman Foundation, Inc, which funds mostly left-leaning nonprofit groups. His brother Jesse Furman is a judge of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.
Furman's hobby, or at least a major skill, is juggling, which he mastered while performing on Manhattan streets for tourists some 20 years ago. His act included tossing knives, burning torches and even a bowling ball.

Second moment method

In mathematics, the second moment method is a technique used in probability theory and analysis to show that a random variable has positive probability of being positive. More generally, the "moment method" consists of bounding the probability that a random variable fluctuates far from its mean, by using its moments.
The method is often quantitative, in that one can often deduce a lower bound on the probability that the random variable is larger than some constant times its expectation. The method involves comparing the second moment of random variables to the square of the first moment.
First moment method.
The first moment method is a simple application of Markov's inequality for integer-valued variables. For a non-negative, integer-valued random variable "X", we may want to prove that "X" = 0 with high probability. To obtain an upper bound for P("X" > 0), and thus a lower bound for P("X" = 0), we first note that since "X" takes only integer values, P("X" > 0) = P("X" ≥ 1). Since "X" is non-negative we can now apply Markov's inequality to obtain P("X" ≥ 1) ≤ E["X"]. Combining these we have P("X" > 0) ≤ E["X"]; the first moment method is simply the use of this inequality.
General outline of the second moment method.
In the other direction, E["X"] being "large" does not directly imply that P("X" = 0) is small. However, we can often use the second moment to derive such a conclusion, using some form of Chebyshev's inequality.
Suppose that "Xn" is a sequence of non-negative real-valued random variables which converge in law to a random variable "X". If there are finite positive constants "c"1, "c"2 such that 
hold for every "n", then it follows from the Paley–Zygmund inequality that for every "n" and θ in (0, 1)
Consequently, the same inequality is satisfied by "X". In many situations, instead of using the Paley–Zygmund inequality, it is sufficient to use Cauchy–Schwarz.
Example application of method.
Setup of problem.
The Bernoulli bond percolation subgraph of a graph "G" at parameter "p" is a random subgraph obtained from "G" by deleting every edge of "G" with probability 1−"p", independently. The infinite complete binary tree "T" is an infinite tree where one vertex (called the root) has two neighbors and every other vertex has three neighbors. The second moment method can be used to show that at every parameter "p" ∈ (1/2, 1] with positive probability the connected component of the root in the percolation subgraph of "T" is infinite.
Application of method.
Let "K" be the percolation component of the root, and let "Tn" be the set of vertices of "T" that are at distance "n" from the root. Let "Xn" be the number of vertices in "Tn" ∩ "K". To prove that "K" is infinite with positive probability, it is enough to show that formula_4 with positive probability. By the reverse Fatou lemma, it suffices to show that formula_5. The Cauchy–Schwarz inequality gives
Therefore, it is sufficient to show that
that is, that the second moment is bounded from above by a constant times the first moment squared (and both are nonzero). In many applications of the second moment method, one is not able to calculate the moments precisely, but can nevertheless establish this inequality.
In this particular application, these moments can be calculated. For every specific "v" in "Tn",
Since formula_9, it follows that
which is the first moment. Now comes the second moment calculation. 
For each pair "v", "u" in "Tn" let "w(v, u)" denote the vertex in "T" that is farthest away from the root and lies on the simple path in "T" to each of the two vertices "v" and "u", and let "k(v, u)" denote the distance from "w" to the root. In order for "v", "u" to both be in "K", it is necessary and sufficient for the three simple paths from "w(v, u)" to "v", "u" and the root to be in "K". Since the number of edges contained in the union of these three paths is 2"n" − "k(v, u)", we obtain
The number of pairs "(v, u)" such that "k(v, u)" = "s" is equal to formula_13, for "s" = 0, 1, ..., "n". Hence,
which completes the proof.

Revella Eudosia Hughes (27 July 1895 – 24 October 1987) was an American singer, musician and recording artist. She was one of the best known and most successful African American sopranos of the first half of the 20th century.
Early life.
Hughes was born in Huntington, West Virginia. Her parents were George and Anna B. Page Hughes. Her musical education began at age 5 with piano and singing lessons, and she later learned the violin while attending Huntington High School (in Huntington, West Virginia, from which she graduated in 1915. She received a Bachelor of Music degree from Howard University in 1917.
Career.
Hughes began her professional career in New York City in 1920, where she appeared several Broadway shows featuring the likes of Paul Robeson, Marian Anderson and Roland Hayes. In 1923 she was made choral director for the Broadway revue "Shuffle Along". During the 1920s she appeared on radio and on stage, working on the B.F. Keith circuit in her home town of Huntington, and at the Regal Theater in Chicago.
After a substantial career as a soprano, Hughes began composing and arranging on the Hammond organ, creating a live-performance compilation she titled "An Informal Hour of Music." In 1953, Hughes toured Europe and the Middle East doing U.S.O. shows, where she played the organ and was musical arranger for Gypsy Markoff.
After retiring in 1955, Hughes was brought back to the spotlight for a round of performances connected with the Universal Jazz Coalition festival in 1980.
Personal life.
While at Howard, Hughes met Layton Wheaton, who became a dentist. They were married in 1920 and divorced in 1923. In 1932, she had returned to Huntington to take care of her widowed mother. Her mother's death led her to stop singing for a while, which brought about her extensive work with the Hammond organ.
She died in New York in 1987 at the age of 91.

Peter Anton

Peter Anton (born 1963 in New Haven, Connecticut) is an American artist and sculptor. His primary subject matter is food with an emphasis on chocolates and other sweets. Often referred to as "Candy Warhol," Anton creates giant realistic sculptures and is best known for his "bigger than life" boxed chocolates. 
Studio.
At times Anton's studio can resemble a sweet shop since it is filled with dozens of real treats which he uses as models. His beginning process is to eat, smell, feel, study and dissect a new food over and over again in order to hyper-familiarize himself with the new subject. He then begins the long and tedious process of sculpting, carving, sanding, painting, and construction of his mixed media works.
Exhibitions.
Anton had his first solo show in 1993 at the Henri Gallery in Washington, DC. His first one person exhibition in New York City was in 1995 at the Bruce R. Lewin Gallery in Soho. The show featured over seventy giant fruits and vegetables. It gained him much attention and it sold out. He went on to have four more solo shows at the gallery. Anton also had solo exhibitions at Galerie Ralph Schriever in Cologne, Germany, UrbanArt in Seoul, Korea, the Allan Stone Gallery in New York City, Galerie Terminus in Munich, the Hammer Galleries on 57th Street in New York City, Galerie Adler Bertin-Toublanc in Miami, and Scott Richards Contemporary Art in San Francisco.
Peter Anton's work has been featured in group exhibitions in the United States and abroad, including the Museum Villa Rot in Burgrieden, Germany; the Austin Museum of Art in Texas; the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers, New York; the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum in Ridgefield, Connecticut; the Castellani Art Museum in Niagara, New York; the Keszler Gallery in New York City; the Allan Stone Gallery in New York City; the Elaine Baker Gallery in Boca Raton, Florida; and the COPIA Museum in Napa Valley, California.
Special Project.
On exhibit during Art Basel Miami in December 2012, Peter Anton's "Sugar & Gomorrah" was the world's first art installation where the viewer rode through an exhibition in a carnival ride. "Sugar & Gomorrah" was an actual roller coaster reworked into an art experience showcasing the juxtaposition between a sense of doom and the magical world of giant sweets. The attendees darted through a snaking tunnel up and down hills rapidly twisting and turning all while viewing a modern interpretation of the destruction of a Sodom and Gomorrah-like world created entirely by Anton. On the full-sized carnival ride there was a backdrop of fire, dusty skeletons, tumbling pillars, nearly nude live models and a virtual candyland of gigantic treats--all while Lesley Gore's "Sunshine, Lollipops and Rainbows" played loudly. The ride was a visually stimulating experience, challenging the viewer to fall into temptations of food and the flesh. Attendees waited in long lines to experience the popular exhibition which ran continuously for six days.
Collections.
Peter Anton's work is featured in private and corporate collections including the CEO of Sony, Sir Howard Stringer, Boston Red Sox owner Tom Werner, New York Yankees owner Barry Klarberg, Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones, the Jordanian Royal Family, architect Sir Norman Foster, Oppenheim Bank, Breitling Watches, Raymond James Financial, and candy maker giant Perfetti Van Melle. His work is also in the permanent collection of museums including the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art in Kansas City, Missouri; the Copelouzos Art Museum in Athens, Greece; the Arkansas Arts Center in Little Rock; the Tennessee State Museum in Nashville and the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum in Ridgefield, Connecticut.

Round-Up (video game)

Round-Up is an arcade video game released in 1981 by Centuri. This game is also known and released by Taito as "Fitter".
Gameplay.
The object of the game is for the player to maneuver his white robot within a maze, capture a red character robot as they move about the maze, and race to the center to change the 9 white balls located there to red. The player may only change one white ball to red at a time after he has captured a red robot, and must evade 4 chaser monsters in the process. Bonus point may be earned when capturing the elusive 'red king' that appears on the screen. Capture him and you will momentarily immobilize the chasers. Play is over when the chasers have captured all of the player's robots. But, should the player be successful in changing all of the balls in the center to red, the pattern clears and then a new challenge is presented: a 3x3 or 4x4 tri-colored pattern will appear at the bottom of the screen and a slightly different tri-colored cube of corresponding size will appear at the center of the screen. The player may earn bonus points by moving the directional arrow and rearranging the colors of the cube at the center of the screen to match the sample pattern presented at the bottom of the screen. The player is given 90 seconds to rearrange the cube as many times as he can. Action returns to the maze whether the player wins or loses the cube challenge.

Khaliq v HM Advocate

Khaliq and Anor v HMA was a Scottish criminal case decided by the High Court of Justiciary on appeal, in which it was decided that it was an offence at common law to supply materials that were otherwise legal in the knowledge that they would be used for self-harm.
Two shopkeepers in Glasgow were arrested and charged, "inter alia", with supplying to children ‘glue-sniffing kits’ consisting of a quantity of petroleum-based glue in a plastic bag. They had been previously warned by the police to stop supplying the kits. They gave notice of objection to the indictment, averring that, on the charge of supplying, the facts as libelled did not disclose a crime known to Scots law because there was nothing illegal about the items that they had supplied. Their plea was repelled at a preliminary diet and they appealed.
On appeal, the High Court took the view that, even though Evostik glue and plastic bags might be perfectly legal, everyday items, the two shopkeepers knew perfectly well what the children were going to use the articles for and the charge on the indictment should stand. 'The Court refused to accept that there was any distinction between supply with knowledge of likely abuse and actual administration of a dangerous substance to a child.'
Said Lord Justice General Emslie: ‘There is ample authority for the view that the wilful and reckless administration of a dangerous substance to another causing injury or death is a crime at common law in Scotland’.
When the case finally came to trial at Glasgow High Court the two were each sentenced to three years’ imprisonment.
This case is reported at 1983 SCCR 483 (CCA); 1984 JC 23; 1984 SLT 137.

Triumph Tiger 100

The Tiger 100 (T100) was a standard motorcycle first made by Triumph at their Coventry factory for 1939.
Development.
With the runaway sales success of the Triumph Speed Twin, Edward Turner's mind turned to further developing the potential of his new parallel twin motor. The lighter and more powerful Tiger 100 was developed as a sports enthusiasts machine, where as with previous models the '100' referred to its claimed maximum speed.
Technical changes over the Speed Twin included forged alloy pistons, a very early use of the technology. Secondly, the cylinders were forged in a single casting and held in place by eight studs, instead of the Speed Twin’s six. Thirdly, the Tiger 100 used a single Amal carburetor, possible thanks to the 360-degree firing interval of the two cylinders. Finished in silver and costing £5 more, new features included a larger fuel tank and detachable silencers.
In March 1939, Triumph came up with an unorthodox 'launch' of the new Tiger 100. Using a Tiger 100 and a Speed Twin straight from dealers showrooms, endurance was tested with a run of over from John o'Groats to Land's End in Cornwall then to the Brooklands circuit for six hours of continuous high-speed laps, where riders Ivan Wicksteed and David Whitworth averaged with a final lap of , winning Triumph the Maudes Trophy. The Tiger100's sporting pretensions were later further proven through Freddie Clarke’s 1939 lap record at Brooklands of on a bored-out 503 cc Tiger 100.
The Triumph works was destroyed by German bombers on the night of 14 November 1940 - along with much of the city of Coventry bringing production of the Tiger 100 to an end until after the war. When Triumph recovered and began production again at Meriden the Tiger 100 re-appeared with the new telescopic fork. In 1951 it gained a new close finned alloy cylinder barrel and factory race kits for independent racers. In 1953 a fully race-kitted model, the Tiger 100C, was available although only 560 were made.
1954 saw the first swinging-arm rear suspension models and the Tiger 100 was developed year on year alongside the other models in the range. 1959 was the last of the pre-units (separate engine/gearbox) and in 1960 it was completely redesigned in the new 'unit' style as the T100A. A long line of T100SS, T100C, T100R and others appeared during the sixties in the UK & export (mainly US) markets culminating in the Daytona variants which soldiered on until 1973. The historic Tiger name was revived by the new Hinckley Triumph company in 1993.
Bob Dylan crash.
On 29 July 1966, Bob Dylan crashed his 500 cc Triumph Tiger 100SS motorcycle on a road near his home in Woodstock, New York, throwing him to the ground. In the wake of his accident, Dylan withdrew from the public and, apart from a few select appearances, did not tour again for eight years.
Jupiter's Travels.
A police-specification 1973 Tiger 100 T100P was also the bike that Ted Simon rode on his first trip around the world, starting that year. In the beginning of his book "Jupiter's Travels", he documents how the Meriden factory was undergoing a sit-in and as a result his motorcycle was hastily assembled.

The Black Cannon Incident

The Black Cannon Incident () is a 1985 Chinese black comedy film satirizing the bureaucracy and paranoia of Chinese authority. Presented by Xi'an Film Studio and directed by Huang Jianxin, it stars Gao Ming, Gerhard Olschewski, and Liu Zifeng.
The film was screened out of competition at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival.
Plot.
Zhao Shuxin (Liu Zifeng) is a capable engineer and German interpreter in a mining company. He is single and has the unusual habit of playing Chinese chess alone. The chessboard and pieces are his intimate friends and have accompanied him for years. One day, when Zhao returns from a business trip, he finds one of his chess pieces, the black cannon, missing. Despite heavy rain, he immediately hurries to the postal office and sends a telegram to the hotel he stayed in previously, which reads, "Missing black cannon. 301. Searching. Zhao.", requesting the hotel's help to search for the piece in Room 301.
Unexpectedly, this ambiguous telegram arouses vigilance of the authorities and the police swiftly set up a case to investigate the so-called "Black Cannon Incident". Zhao is removed from his post and assigned somewhere else. His interpreter post is taken over by Feng Liangcai (Yang Yazhou), a tourism interpreter who has little knowledge of engineering construction. A German specialist, Hans Schmidt (Gerhard Olschewski) arrives for the second time for the WD project. To his disappointment, his former partner, Zhao, has been replaced. The new interpreter frequently makes mistakes. Frustrated, Hans insists that Zhao return. He even meets Zhao personally and asks for the resumption of their cooperation, which pushes Zhao into a quandary.
Meanwhile, the company manager Li Renzhong (Gao Ming), visits Zhao and accidentally finds the chess set with the missing black cannon. Thus the puzzle seems resolved. In a Party committee meeting, Li suggests Zhao resume his post as interpreter. However, Zhou Yuzhen, the Party Chief, insists no further actions will be taken until the incident is completely straightened out. At the moment, the pitiful Zhao still knows nothing about the case. The only thing he can do now is to inspect the progress of the project stealthily at midnight with a flashlight and to garner information during a brief meeting with Hans. The new interpreter, Feng, mistakenly translates "bearing" into "bracket", leading to serious damage to the parts during a test run, as well as severe financial loss.
Before long, the postal office brings a package to Zhao, and Zhou and the others covertly open it, only to find a Black Cannon chess piece. The case is now completely clear, and Zhou grumbles to Zhao that he shouldn't have sent such a telegram. Apparently puzzled, Zhao asks, "Why can't I send a telegram of my own?"

Stephen Soldz

Stephen Soldz (born 19 November 1952) is a psychoanalyst, clinical psychologist, professor, and anti-war activist. Soldz is director of the Boston Graduate School of Psychoanalysis.
He has received media attention as a vocal critic regarding allegations of the use of psychological torture by the U.S. government in its conduct of the War in Iraq and the War on Terror.
In August 2007, Soldz publicly challenged the American Psychological Association to ban the involvement by professional psychologists in the interrogation of 'enemy combatant' prisoners held by the CIA and Defense Department. 
<br>Soldz, in an interview with the "San Francisco Chronicle", publicly accused psychologists attached to the U.S. military base at Guantanamo Bay of developing and applying torture techniques on detainees while advising interrogators on the levels of abuse that detainees could withstand. In November 2007, Soldz coauthored an article on psychological torture at Guantanamo Bay with Julian Assange, published via WikiLeaks.
The American Psychological Association did not pass the ban advocated by Soldz, but instead issued a resolution stating its opposition to torture and restricting its members from participating in interrogations that involved practices that could be defined as torture.
Additionally, Soldz, in his role as the publisher of the "Iraq Occupation and Resistance Report" web site, has written for Znet website questioning the accuracy in reporting the number of Iraqi civilian deaths since the March 2003 invasion and has challenged claims that the al-Jazeera television network was supportive of Saddam Hussein. He has also written opinion columns on the Iraq war for the Daily Kos web site.
Outside of politics, Soldz and Leigh McCullough co-edited the 1999 book "Reconciling Empirical Knowledge and Clinical Experience: The Art and Science of Psychotherapy", published by the American Psychological Association. Also in 1999, Soldz and George E. Vaillant published their article "The Big Five Personality Traits and the Life Course: A 45-Year Longitudinal Study" in the "'Journal of Research in Personality". The journal’s editors later named the Soldz-Vaillant article as the publication's most important paper for that year.

Middlesex Yeomanry

The 47 (Middlesex Yeomanry) Signal Squadron is a unit of the Royal Corps of Signals within the British Territorial Army.
Formation and Early History.
During the Napoleonic Wars that the Gentlemen of Uxbridge sought permission from the Government to form a Military Association to maintain law and order when the Regular Forces were sent to the coast to protect the country against invasion by the French. A Cavalry Troop was raised in 1797 and titled the 'Uxbridge Volunteer Cavalry' and its first Captain Commandant was Christopher Baynes Esq' (later Sir Christopher),
The role of the Uxbridge Volunteer Cavalry was to act as armed police and support the Civil Powers in maintaining law and order in the local parishes.
A second troop was raised in 1798 with the change of title to 'Uxbridge Yeomanry Cavalry'. Captain-Commandant Christopher Baynes was appointed Major-Commandant and the UYC was given a wider sphere of operation. The volunteers provided their own clothes and horses, and received no payment if called out to quell a disturbance,
At the end of the war with France the number of Yeomanry units was reduced and it was not until 1830 that the Uxbridge Yeomanry Cavalry was reformed to maintain the peace during a period of extreme poverty, when rioters terrorised the inhabitants and destroyed machinery which was being introduced into the agriculture and cotton industries.
The uniform worn by the Uxbridge Yeomanry Cavalry was of the Light Dragoon pattern with a broad-topped shako of dark green, ornamented with a brass Maltese Cross with the Arms of the County of Middlesex placed in the centre, and the motto adopted was 'Pro Aris et Focis', which can be loosely interpreted as 'For Hearth and Home'.
In 1856 the badge was changed to a gilt metal six-pointed star, surmounted by the Royal Crown, and a circle bearing the regimental motto 'Pro Aris et Focis' enclosing the Royal Cypher 'VR',
Middlesex Yeomanry Cavalry 1871.
There were variations to the uniform until 1871 when the Uxbridge Yeomanry Cavalry was ordered to raise a fourth troop and to change its title to 'Middlesex Yeomanry Cavalry'. The Commanding Officer adopted the Hussar uniform, keeping the green Hussar tunic with black collars and cuffs; yellow Hussar lace on the collars, cuffs, and back, with three across the breast. Blue black overalls with double red Hussar stripes; a Hussar busby with dark green bag, and a red-under-green brush, with yellow lines, trimmings and bosses,
Duke of Cambridge's Hussars 1884.
In April 1884 the Queen graciously honoured the Regiment with the title 'Middlesex (Duke of Cambridge's) Yeomanry Cavalry'.
There were many changes in the Yeomanry Force during the later years of the 19th century. The Squadron became the official unit. The Middlesex Yeomanry was formed of two squadrons, each with two troops, and the regiment was brigaded with the Royal Berkshire Yeomanry Cavalry, which formed the 1st Yeomanry Brigade.
South African War 1900-1902.
Soon after the reverses in Natal the Government found that the only way to raise a large number of mounted men was to call upon the Yeomanry for volunteers to serve overseas. There was an immediate response from the regiment and by the end of January 1900 the Middlesex Yeomanry had raised three Companies, the 34th, the 35th (2nd Middlesex Yeomanry), and the 62nd (3rd Middlesex Yeomanry) plus a maxim-gun detachment. The 34th and 35th Companies together with two Companies raised in Kent formed the 11th Battalion under command of Colonel Kenyon Mitford, the Commanding Officer of the Middlesex Yeomanry. The 62nd was placed under command of the 14th Battalion.
In January 1901 a second contingent of Yeomanry was raised to replace the original 34th, 35th and 62nd Companies, and with a fourth Company, the 112th, formed the 112th (Kent and Middlesex) Battalion under command of Colonel R.B. Firman (Middlesex Yeomanry).
'Few Yeomanry Regiments have such proud memories of daring in South Africa as the two fights against such heavy odds which occurred at Senekel and Tweefonteen'. (Historical Records of The Middlesex Yeomanry 1797-1927).
Middlesex (Duke of Cambridge's Hussars) Imperial Yeomanry. 1900-1914.
With the end of the South African War in 1902 there was a general re-organisation of the Yeomanry. The title of the whole force was changed to 'Imperial Yeomanry' and the name of the regiment changed to 'Middlesex (Duke of Cambridge's Hussars) Imperial Yeomanry'.
The regiment was increased to four squadrons totalling 596 all ranks, which included a machine-gun detachment. At the time there were four new Yeomanry regiments being recruited in London, so it was not an easy task to increase the strength of the regiment from 200 to about 600 all ranks.
1st County of London Yeomanry Middlesex, (Duke of Cambridge's Hussars).
On 1 April 1908 the regiment became part of the Territorial Force being recruited in London. The title then changed to the 1st County of London Yeomanry (Middlesex, Duke of Cambridge's Hussars) and with the other London Yeomanry Units formed the London Mounted Brigade.
The Great War 1914-1918.
In the summer of 1914 the regiment was in camp at Moulsford Berkshire when the declaration of war with Germany interrupted the inter regimental sports planned to take place on the Bank Holiday. Instead the regiment returned to headquarters and by 5 August was ready to mobilize.
The Middlesex Yeomanry together with the 1st City of London Yeomanry (Rough Riders) and the 3rd County of London Yeomanry (The Sharpshooters) formed the 8th Mounted Brigade of the Yeomanry Mounted Division.
It was the Yeomanry Regiments of this Division, which were used as detached regiments and brigades on the Egyptian, Gallipoli and Salonica fronts and with the Desert Column under General Allenby, took part in the advance from the Suez Canal culminating in the Battles of Gaza in 1917.
During this campaign, Alexander Malins Lafone was awarded the Victoria Cross.
Lt Col Oliver Cyril Spencer Watson, another Middlesex Yeoman, was detached from the Regiment to the 2nd/5th Battalion, King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry in 1917. He ultimately assumed command of this infantry Regiment and was awarded the Victoria Cross on 28 March 1918 at Rossignol Wood, north of Hebuterne, France. The Middlesex Yeomanry consequently lays claim to two of the three Victoria Crosses awarded to the Yeomanry as a whole.
Royal Signals.
After the war there was a reduction in the number of cavalry regiments and the Middlesex Yeomanry selected to re-role as Cavalry Signals to the 2nd Cavalry Division, and recruiting started on 20 May 1920. The 2nd Cavalry Divisional Signals (Middlesex Yeomanry) was integrated with the newly formed Royal Corps of Signals in June of that year, becoming the first unit formally established into the Corps.
The regiment fought hard to retain its old title, privileges, cap badge, motto and uniform, including the ancient custom of NCO's wearing a crown above their stripes, and the Quarter-master wearing four stripes with a crown, The shoulder title worn by the men changed to 'Royal Corps of Signals' with the concession of a 'Y' above it.
Second World War 1939-1945.
The years between the wars had seen the cavalry regiments gradually change from mounted to mechanised regiments, although the 2nd Cavalry Division had retained some of its horses at the outbreak of war in 1939.
Following the Munich crisis in 1938, and the subsequent threat of war, thousands of young men and women volunteered to join the armed forces.
In December 1938 the title of the regiment changed to Mobile Divisional Signals (Middlesex Yeomanry) T.A., until a second regiment was formed in 1939 and the title changed to 1st (Middlesex Yeomanry) Cavalry Divisional Signals.
Airborne Signals and afterwards 1945-1995.
The regiment was re-formed in 1947 and became the 16th Airborne Divisional Signals (Middlesex Yeomanry) T.A., and continued as such until the T.A., Airborne Division was reduced to a Parachute Brigade Group in 1956.
The Middlesex Yeomanry Signal Regiment became 40 Signal Regiment (Middlesex Yeomanry) T.A., until 1961 when it was amalgamated with 47 (London) Signal Regiment T.A. and the newly formed regiment became known as 47 Signal Regiment (Middlesex Yeomanry) T.A.
The new regiment was given the role of SHAPE Troops (Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe). No.3 Squadron, 40 Signal Regiment, 305 (Parachute Brigade) Signal Squadron T.A., did not become part of 47 Signal Regiment (Middlesex Yeomanry) T.A. but continued in its role as the Signal Squadron to 44 Parachute Brigade, retaining its Middlesex Yeomanry cap badge and badges of rank. It was subsequently reduced to become Airhead Signal Troop, still in support of 44 Para bde but now part of 55 Signal Sqn, which also had troops in Cardiff (Port Troop) and Liverpool (Nobody knew what this troop was for). 55 Sqn was not parachute minded but the arrangement continued - including an eventful exercise in Cyprus - until 1978 when 44 Para Bde was broken up into three separate Parachute battalions: 4, 10, and 15 (Scottish). The remnants of the Airhead Troop merged with the Signal Platoon of 10 PARA (V). The CO of 10 PARA, a charming Cameronian, greeted the former OC of the Airhead Troop with the suggestion that, as he was to take over the Signal Platoon, he would need to do a training course. The former OC whose career had started in a Signals regiment in Wales and had declined through 305 Sqn to Airhead Tp, replied "Yes Sir" (always a good answer) "What should I teach?" It remains a mystery why he was not then sacked.
Territorial Army Volunteer Reserve 1967.
When the Territorial Army Volunteer Reserve was formed in 1967 the Middlesex Yeomanry retained its title, but like so many other yeomanry' regiments was reduced to squadron establishment and became 47 (Middlesex Yeomanry) Signal Squadron., 31st (Greater London) Signal Regiment TAVR.
In accordance with historical precedence all Yeomanry and Militia units, including the Honourable Artillery Company, do not adopt the suffix (Volunteers) as Yeomanry and Militia can and have only ever been volunteer units/formations. This is reflected in policy of the Royal Armoured Corps, who retain responsibility for the continued use of Yeomanry titles, and within the Signal Officer in Chief's Policy Directive.
Following the 1967 reorganisation the Squadron was permitted to continue the ancient custom of NCO's wearing a crown above their stripes, and the SQMS wearing four stripes and a crown, and Middlesex Yeomanry collar badges continued to be worn on regulation uniform, but the Middlesex Yeomanry cap badge was replaced for the Royal Signals 'Mercury' cap badge which is worn on all headress less side hat.
The coloured side hat of scarlet, piped with gold, and rifle green flaps piped with gold with scarlet tipped peak and two buttons, worn by officers and soldiers off duty, was retained and continues to be listed in the Army's Dress Regulations. Officers caps have an embroidered cap badge, in gold on rifle green cloth, of an oval strap bearing the motto Pro Aris et Focis, in the centre the cypher MYC, and the whole ensigned by St Edward's crown. 
On Service and No.2 Dress members of the Squadron wear a metal Middlesex Yeomanry collar badge and the khaki/green woven lanyard representing the rigging line of an army parachute commemorating the previous airborne role rather than the standard blue of the Royal Signals. The Squadron's webbing stable belt comprises crimson over, gold, and green with black edging, fastened by two nickel plated buckles and black leather straps. (Headdress,Badges & Embellishments, of the Royal Corps of Signals by Major A. G. Harfield BEM., Picton Publishing Chippenham).
With recent changes in combat and barrack uniform styles, Squadron dress has also evolved. However all NCOs continue to wear a crown above their stripes, a throwback to the days when they would escort the 'Widow at Windsor'. To distinguish Sgts (three stripes AND a crown remember) from SSgts, the Staffies get to wear FOUR stripes and a crown. Rank slides, for all ranks (including officers) have the abbreviation 'Mx Yeo' below the rank insignia and soldiers who have completed trade training are entitled to wear a slide solely with the Squadron's abbreviated title. 
Recent reorganisations within the Territorial Army and TA Royal Signals has seen 47 (Middlesex Yeomanry) Signal Squadron move, in 1995, to come under command of the 39th (Skinners) Signal Regiment (Volunteers). In 2006 47 (Middlesex Yeomanry) Signal Squadron came under the command of 71 (Yeomanry) Signal Regiment. The Sqn took command of 831 Troop based at Southfields on 1 October 2009. At this stage the Sqn become the lead sabre Sqn for 71 (Yeomanry) Signal Regiment because of the number of trained soldiers when compared to the other sarbre Sqn in the Regt.
The Squadron is loosely associated with the USMC due to previous members attending joint exercises on the US/UK exchange and the long standing relationship with the USMC London Embassy detachment quartered in west London.
The Squadron is currently commanded by Major Michael Curtis-Rouse and the Squadron Sergeant Major is Staff Sergeant Claire Goodwin. It holds the Freedom of the London Borough of Hillingdon and it also has an active Regimental Association which is affiliated to the Royal Signals Association.

Samuel Hoare Jr

Samuel Hoare Jr (9 August 1751 – 14 July 1825) was a wealthy British Quaker merchant and abolitionist born in Stoke Newington, the north of London. He was one of the twelve founding members of the Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade.
Background.
His parents were Samuel Hoare (1716-1796), a London merchant from an Irish background, and Grizell Gurnell (1722? - 1802), of Ealing. It was a numerous family, although the eldest son, Joseph, died at 25. His only surviving brother Jonathan, merchant of Throgmorton Street, partner in Gurnell, Hoare & Co, built a mansion in what became Clissold Park, across Stoke Newington Church Street from the family home in Paradise Row. Jonathan ran into financial difficulties, which led Samuel Jr to attempt to assist him. One of their sisters married Thomas Bradshaw, a linen manufacturer in Ireland. Another, Mary, married the abolitionist Joseph Woods and bore the more famous botanist and architect son of the same name. The youngest sister Grizell (1757-1835) married Wilson Birkbeck in 1801, having stayed at home as nurse and companion to her father; as a wealthy 72 year old widow, she married William Allen, another notable Quaker abolitionist, with whom she founded Newington Academy for Girls in 1824. Their elderly marriage was greeted by a satirical cartoon entitled "Sweet William & Grizzell-or- Newington nunnery in an uproar!!!" by Robert Cruikshank.
Early life.
Samuel Jr was sent sent away to school when he was five years old, returning home only once a year. The school was in Penketh, between Warrington and Widnes on the Irwell, and was run by Gilbert Thompson. In his mid teens he became apprenticed to Henry Gurney in Norwich, a woolen manufacturer. He had some connection with the Freshfield family there; James William Freshfield lived in Fleetwood House on Stoke Newington Church Street. He followed several branches of the Hoare family in pursuing a career in banking.
He married Sarah (1757–1783), the eldest daughter of Samuel Gurney (1723–1770) of the Gurney family (Norwich), and 90 friends and relatives witnessed their marriage. They lived first in Old Broad Street and could afford four servants without scrimping. Their children were Sarah (b. 1777), Hannah (b. 1779), and Grizell (known as Sophia or Sophy) (1781), and then a longed-for son:
Hannah died ten days later, and was buried at Winchmore Hill. The widower moved his family back to Stoke Newington, in the same street as his father, so that his sisters, particularly Grizell, could help raise the children.
Work.
His main interest at this time was the abolition of the slave trade and the establishment of Sunday schools across the country. He was also involved in a plan to establish a free black colony in Sierra Leone. Many of his neighbours were abolitionists. From 1774 James Stephen spent his summers in Stoke Newington at the Summerhouse next to Fleetwood House.
In 1772 he became a junior partner in the Lombard Street bank of Bland and Barnett, which became Barnett, Hoare & Co. The bank traded under the sign of the black horse. Further mergers followed, to form Barnetts, Hoares, Hanbury & Lloyd and unlimately in 1884, Lloyds Banking Company took over Barnetts, Hoares, Hanbury & Lloyd in a bid to gain a foothold in London and acquired the black horse sign which continues in use as the Lloyd's TSB logo. The leading partner in Barnetts, Hoares, Hanbury & Lloyd, Edward Broadie Hoare, joined the Lloyds board of directors and became Deputy Chairman.
In 1788 he married the nineteen-year-old daughter of Henry and Mary Sterry, of Bush Hill, Enfield and Hatton Garden. The family holidayed in Cromer, and kept up the connections with his first wife's relatives. Later his illness drove him to take the family to Bath, where a medical man advised him that the New River, running so close to Stoke Newington Church Street and Clissold Park, might be harming his health. In 1790 they moved to higher ground: Heath House, a prominent mansion in Hampstead.
In 1794 they became friends with Anna Laetitia Barbauld, and through her met Joseph Priestley. They knew Amelia Alderson, later Mrs Opie, Mary Knowles, the intimate of Samuel Johnson, and William Savory, a Philadelphia minister. In Bath in a later year he conversed with Hannah More.
Children and descendants.
In 1802 his daughter Hannah married Thomas Marlborough Pryor. His son Samuel (1783–1847) learned banking in Lombard Street from 1803, and in 1806 he married Louisa Gurney (1784 - 1836) of Earlham Hall near Norwich. This connected the family to (Gurney's Bank), and also to Louisa's siblings Elizabeth Fry, prison reformer, Joseph John Gurney and Samuel Gurney, philanthropists, and Daniel Gurney, banker and antiquary. The marriage was strongly supported by Samuel Hoare Jr. According to his daughter Sarah, "I know of no event which gave my father more pleasure than the engagement of his son to the daughter of his old friend. With perfect confidence in her principles, and a persuasion that she would make my brother happy, he was pleased with her being, like my mother, a Norfolk woman, and interested himself much in procuring for them an house at Hampstead that they might be established near him."
His descendants included Sir Samuel Hoare, M.P., and Viscount Templewood.
His banking firm later merged with those of Joseph John Gurney and Barclays to form part of Barclays Bank
Beliefs.
The historian Peter Brock notes that Hoare wasn't wholly convinced by Quaker pacifism and quotes him as saying that he "looked upon in the present state of society as a necessary evil" and that it "is the duty of a man to defend his country".

Psilocybe galindoi

Psilocybe galindoi is a psychedelic mushroom in the section Mexicana, having psilocybin and psilocin as its main active compounds. It is also known as P. galindii, the mushroom was named in honor of Mr. Carlos Galindo Arias and his family by Dr. Gastón Guzmán.
Distribution and habitat.
"Psilocybe galindoi" is found growing gregariously in soil at higher elevations and in tall grass in or near "Pinus"-"Quercus" (pine with oak) forests in Mexico. Most recently they have been seen in the U.S. state of Georgia. Elevation does not seem to play a role in the habitat of "Psilocybe galindoi" in the U.S. "Psilocybe galindoi" is usually found in Bermuda grass or fescue grass.
Consumption and cultivation.
Like several other psilocybin mushrooms in the genus, "Psilocybe galindoi" has been consumed by indigenous North American and Central American peoples for its entheogenic effects. 
In the Western world, sclerotia of "Psilocybe galindoi" are sometimes cultivated for entheogenic or medicinal use. The sclerotia usually have a lower content of active substances than the actual mushrooms themselves.

A. D. Watts

A. D. "Aus" Watts (1867–1927) was a North Carolina politician. A Democrat, Watts represented Iredell County, North Carolina in the North Carolina House of Representatives (1901 and 1903) and in the North Carolina Senate. 
In 1912, Watts did not support Woodrow Wilson for the Democratic nomination for President, but Wilson appointed him as a federal revenue collector for western North Carolina in 1913, at the behest of Sen. Lee S. Overman.
His most important role, arguably, was as "chief lieutenant" to U.S. Senator Furnifold Simmons, whose powerful political machine dominated North Carolina politics in the early 20th century, according to the journalist Rob Christensen. 
Watts was instrumental in helping Cameron Morrison win the Democratic primary for Governor in 1920, using race-baiting tactics. After the election, Morrison appointed Watts as the first state revenue commissioner. He resigned in 1923 after police caught him in the company of an African-American prostitute. 
Watts returned to his hometown of Statesville, where he died four years later. Most of the state's Democratic Party leadership attended his funeral.

Shafir

Shafir () is a moshav in southern Israel. Located in the Shephelah near Kiryat Malakhi, it falls under the jurisdiction of Shafir Regional Council. In 2006, it had a population of 499.
Shafir was founded on August 15, 1949 by immigrants from Hungary and Czechoslovakia. It was named after the Biblical city of Shafir that is mentioned in the Book of Micah 1:11, which also means "good and beautiful". It is built near the depopulated Palestinian village Al-Sawafir al-Shamaliyya, on the land belonging to the village of Al-Sawafir al-Sharqiyya.
In 1956, during the Shafir shooting attack, a fedayeen "opened fire on a synagogue full of children and teenagers, in the farming community of Shafir. Three children and a youth worker were killed on the spot, and five were wounded, including three seriously".

Uvaricin

Uvaricin is a bis(tetrahydrofuranoid) fatty acid lactone that was first isolated in 1982 from the roots of the Annonaceae "Uvaria acuminata". Uvaricin was the first in a class of compounds with potent anticancer activity known as acetogenins. Acetogenins, which are found in plants of the family Annonaceae, seem to kill cells by inhibiting NADH dehydrogenase in the mitochondrion. A method to synthesize uvaricin was first published in 1998, and an improved stereoselective synthesis published in 2001.

Overseas housing allowance (United States military)

An overseas housing allowance (OHA) is a United States military entitlement given to military servicemen and women living overseas. It is administered by Defense Travel Management Office (DTMO) and is the overseas equivalent of the Basic Allowance for Housing. OHA is intended to private lease local housing instead of living in government or on-base housing. Over $1.8billion is paid in OHA benefiting approximately 61,000 members annually.
How it works.
Eligibility Factors.
OHA is given to servicemembers so that they can provide housing for themselves and their dependents (usually spouse and children). OHA is given when the member and their dependents do not occupy government quarters. 
OHA is non-taxable money paid on a monthly basis, and is equivalent to the amount of rent owed. Whereas servicemembers stationed in the Continental United States (48 contiguous states) are allowed to keep any additional allowance pay that they do not use for their rent, servicemembers do not receive their full complement of OHA if their rents are lower than the maximum allowable rates.
Each servicemember is allowed a set OHA rate, broken down by district, depending on where they are stationed. The rates are slightly higher for those servicemembers with families, otherwise known as dependents. There are three factors for determining the maximum amount of OHA allowed to the servicemember: 
OHA is paid in the dollar equivalent of the rent due, and therefore rises and falls with monthly changes in the exchange rate.
Determining allowances.
Frequently a "utility allowance" also accompanies OHA. This is usually a flat rate given to the member to cover the cost of utilities, regardless of the actual amount. In certain countries, an additional Move In Housing Allowance (MIHA) is allotted to cover the cost of cleaning, maintenance, repainting, and general refurbishing of the rental unit. Utility/recurring maintenance expenses are calculated annually. Move-in Housing Allowance (MIHA) expenses are calculated every 3 years. Both are based on actual servicemember expense reports. The rent allowance is meant to cover 80% of a servicemember's full expenses and the majority of the remaining 20% servicemember housing expenses.

Tatsunoko Fight

Gameplay.
"Tatsunoko Fight" is a two-dimensional, one-on-one fighting game where players must defeat their opponent in two of three rounds in order to advance. The game relies on using both normal and special attacks in order to damage the opponent, with a round ending once all of a character's remaining vitality has been lost. A special gauge at the bottom of the screen steadily fills when a character deals or receives damage, reaching a maximum of three levels. Player's can then expend one level at a time to unleash a more powerful super attack on their opponent to deal more damage. The game uses a combo system where light and heavy attacks can be chained together to launch a succession of attacks that cannot be interrupted or stopped until the sequence ends. In addition to normal versus mode, players may choose a round-robin-style team battle mode involving multiple characters, as well as a single-player story mode that resembles an arcade fighting game.
Characters.
"Tatsunoko Fight" features playable characters from four established Tatsunoko franchises: "Science Ninja Team Gatchaman", "Neo-Human Casshern", "", and "Hurricane Polymar", as well an original series created exclusively for the game, "Denkou Senka Volter" (電光石火ヴォルター, literally "Lightning Warrior Volter"). Each series is represented by three members, consisting of a "Hero", "Supporter", and "Arch Rival" character from their respective titles. Original characters created solely for the game include the superhero Volter, his companion Neon, and their nemesis Karochi Taiki, as well as the game's primary antagonist, the demonic Rosraisen. Many of the game's characters are voiced by the actors who portrayed them in their original animated appearances, with additional supporting characters making cameo appearances throughout gameplay.

Mountaineer Hotel

The Mountaineer Hotel is an historic hotel located in Williamson, West Virginia, USA. Situated at the corner of East Second Avenue and Court Street with the main entrance located on East Second Avenue, the one hundred sixteen room hotel is in the center of the downtown commercial district.
The Classical Revival building was built in 1925 and added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on March 21, 1997. 
History.
Construction.
In 1923, in response to the rapid population and business growth in Williamson, the Williamson Chamber of Commerce sponsored an executive committee to raise funds for a new local hotel. Shares of stock for a new hotel were sold to 1,400 stockholders, who were mostly local residents, and $493,000 was raised. Four lots were purchased for $90,000 in the central commercial district and, in 1925, the community hotel was constructed. The Charleston, West Virginia, architectural firm of Meanor and Handloser designed the building, and the construction of the hotel was done by Payne Construction of Ashland, Kentucky, at a final cost of $600,000. In a naming contest held by the Chamber of Commerce, the name "Mountaineer Hotel" was chosen with a $100 prize going to the winner.
Events.
The Mountaineer Hotel's location in the town center made it a key part of the Williamson's cultural history. Over the years, community events ranged from political rallies and civic club meetings to weddings and reunions. 
When dignitaries such as President John F. Kennedy and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, entrepreneurs such as Henry Ford and celebrities such as Loretta Lynn and Hank Williams came to the area, they stayed at the Mountaineer Hotel.
Architecture.
Exterior.
The square Classical Revival building is five stories tall. All around the building at the street level there are large bay openings where various retail shops are located. The exterior is framed with yellow glazed brick.
The street level and mezzanine stories are accentuated by a stringcourse at the cornice line, with the cornice line accentuated by angled bricks to give a dentil effect. Around the windows at the mezzanine level are false arch brick work in a keystone and centered diamond pattern.
The roof's cornice line has brick corbeling. Below the c[orbeling is a row of bricks extended slightly from the facade with bricks in a diamond design intermittently interrupting the row pattern.
Interior.
The main entrance leads to a large lobby and the front desk with pigeonhole boxes for room keys and a teller window. French doors lead to the ballroom. The hotel has 116 rooms for guests, a formal ballroom, a lobby restaurant and sports bar.

Monroe Dunaway Anderson

Monroe Dunaway Anderson (1873–1939) was a banker and cotton trader from Jackson, Tennessee. With his brother-in-law, William L. Clayton, Anderson built Anderson, Clayton & Co into the world's biggest cotton company. In the event of one of their deaths, the partnership would lose a large amount of money to estate taxes and might be forced to dissolve. In order to avoid this, Anderson created the M.D. Anderson Foundation with an initial sum of $300,000. In 1939, after Anderson's death the foundation received an additional $19 million.
In 1941, the Texas Legislature appropriated $500,000 to build a cancer hospital and research center. The Anderson Foundation agreed to match the state funds if the hospital were located in Houston at the Texas Medical Center (another project of the Anderson Foundation), and named after Anderson.
Using surplus World War II Army barracks, the hospital operated for 10 years from a converted residence and 46 beds leased in a Houston hospital before moving to its current location in 1954.

The Second Little Show

The Second Little Show is a musical revue with lyrics by Howard Dietz and music mostly by Arthur Schwartz.
Produced by William A. Brady, Jr. and Dwight Deere Wiman, in association with Tom Weatherly, the Broadway production opened at the Royale Theatre on September 2, 1930 and closed in October 1930, after 63 performances. Directed by Wiman and Monty Woolley and choreographed by Dave Gould, with scenic design by Jo Mielziner, the cast included Jay C. Flippen, Gloria Grafton, and Al Trahan.
This is the second of the "Little Shows". The only claim to fame is the song "Sing Something Simple" with words and music by Herman Hupfield, introduced by Ruth tester.
Other songs include "I Like Your Face" (originally "Foolish Face"), "Lucky Seven", "What a Case I've Got On You", and "You're the Sunrise".
The producers of The Little Show, in doing the follow-up, decided to do the show without stars, but the show did poorly. (And the stars of the first "Little Show" went on to success.)
There was a "Third Little Show", which opened at the Music Box Theatre on June 1, 1931 and ran for 136 performances. The music was by various composers (including Hupfield) and the sketches were by Noël Coward, S. J. Perelman, Marc Connelly, among others. It was directed by Alexander Leftwich and starred Beatrice Lillie, Ernest Truex, and Constance Carpenter. Lillie introduced the Coward song "Mad Dogs and Englishmen" to the American audience in this revue.

HD 141569

HD 141569 is a blue-white dwarf star approximately 320 light-years away in the constellation of Libra. The primary star has two red dwarf companions (orbiting each other) at about nine arseconds. In 1999, a protoplanetary disk was discovered around the star. A gap in the disk speculate a possible extrasolar planet forming in the disk.
Planetary system.
Protoplanetary disk.
In January 1999, NASA announced a protoplanetary disk around HD 141569. The Hubble Space Telescope showed that the disk appears to come in two parts (inner and outer). It superficially resembles the largest gap in Saturn's rings (known as the Cassini division).
The vast disk is 75 billion miles across (13 times the diameter of Neptune's orbit). The inner edge of the gap is 21 billion miles from the star. The relatively narrow gap lies approximately halfway between the inner and outer edges of the disk. Though already a fully formed star, HD 141569 is relatively young, probably only 1% through its lifetime as a stable star. The star is nearly three times more massive and 22 times brighter than the Sun.
HD 141569 was first identified as a source that might have a disk in 1986 as a result of observations done with the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS). Thermal radiation emitted by the warmed dust was observed in images taken last June at the W. M. Keck Observatory.
Light from the central star which was reflected from dust particles in the disk was captured by Hubble's Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) at a wavelength of 1.1 micrometres. At the distance of HD 141569, the crisp resolution of the telescope and camera combination reveals structures as small as 1 billion miles across. Dust disks surrounding newly forming stars are common, but only a small number of adult stars are known to have disks; of these, only a handful have been imaged. Astronomers believe these disks must form and/or be replenished when older rocks and debris collide and break up into small particles.
Possible planet.
The gap in the disk leads to the conclusion of a protoplanet in formation around the star. The planet does not have to be in the gap, however. It could either be sweeping up the dust and rocks from the disk as it travels in its orbit around the star, or the gravity of the planet could knock the dust out of one part of the disk.

The Olive tree of Vouves (Greek "Ελιά Βουβών") is an olive tree in the village of Ano Vouves in the municipal unit of Kolymvari in Chania regional unit, Crete, Greece. It is probably one of the oldest olive trees in the world and still produces olives today. The use of tree ring analysis has proven the tree to be at least 2000 years old. On the other end of the scale, scientists from the University of Crete have estimated it to be 4,000 years old. The trunk has a perimeter of 12.5 m and a diameter of 4.6 m. It belongs to the variety tsounati. It is considered by some a natural monument. Current research in Crete and abroad, indicates that earlier estimates of the age of olive trees are to be debated as far as their accuracy. There is not yet an agreed upon scientific method established to ascertain the ages of olives. 
In the case of the Vouves Olive, it could be much younger than earlier estimates indicated or for example the ancient tree in Finix (Sfakia).

<doc id="18423049" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18423049" title="Cost of Living Allowance (U.S. Military)">
Cost of Living Allowance (U.S. Military)

Cost of Living Allowance (COLA) is a United States military entitlement given to military servicemen and women living in high cost areas or stationed overseas. It is intended to compensate servicemembers for the high cost of living at certain duty stations.
How It Works.
The fundamental goal of COLA is to compensate servicemembers for the high cost of living at certain duty stations. COLA rates are based on a servicemember's pay grade, years of service, and number of dependents.
An area is considered high cost if the cost of living for that area exceeds 108% of that national average of non-housing costs. COLA takes into account the availability of commissary, exchange, and hospital facilities at a specific duty station, because servicemembers without this infrastructure tend to have a higher cost of living. However, not having this infrastructure is not enough in an of itself to qualify an area for COLA. COLA also factors in local taxes, including taxes on such things as Privately Owned Vehicles for a specific duty location in calculating the cost of living in a particular area.
You will only receive COLA, whether you are stationed in the United States or abroad, if you are assigned to an area where the cost of living is higher than it would be in an average area in the United States. If the cost of living at your duty station is the same as or lower than the average in the US, you will not receive any COLA.
COLA rates vary from station to station, even within a specific country.
Calculating Cost of Living Allowances.
The Defense Finance and Accounting Service calculates the cost of living in a particular area by using two surveys: the Living Pattern Survey and a Retail Price Schedule.
The Living Pattern Survey indicates how much servicemembers purchase at on post facilities, and how much they spend off post at local stores. The survey produces an average for a specific area. For example, in a specific area the survey may show that servicemembers but half of their products on post, and half on the local economy. This is only an average and may not apply to all servicemembers within that area.
Using this information and the Retail Price Schedule, shoppers will price 120 goods and services, everything from auto repair to zucchini, to compare their prices with equivalent goods and services in the US. If the overseas costs are higher than in the US, a COLA equal to the difference is paid.
When changes in spending patterns occur because of changes in the exchange rate, the Living Pattern Survey will be updated. The opening/closing of a commissary or an exchange may also prompt an update to the Living Pattern Survey.
Updating Overseas COLA Rates.
The Per Diem Committee in the Defense Finance Accounting Service monitors the exchange rates between local currency and US currency throughout the year. Changes to an area's COLA are made along with changes to the exchange rate to maintain your purchasing power overseas.
The committee adjusts the COLA rate as often as possible and can even adjust it every day. These changes, however, will not have an immediate impact on your paycheck. It takes time for the Department and Defense Finance and Accounting Service to chart currency movements, set the COLA, and then distribute the money via payrolls.
In other words, the COLA rate is always playing catch up with the dollar's movement in value against other currencies. On the reverse side of it, if the dollar rebounds, it will again take some time for servicemembers to see a reduction in their COLA.
In the short term, servicemembers may see big fluctuations in the US dollar's buying power. But over time, COLA adjustments will offset those changes and a servicemember's purchasing power will remain steady.
Updating Stateside COLA Rates.
COLA rates for the Continental United States are updated once a year, and changes go into effect January 1 of each year. At that time, an area's COLA may increase or even decrease, based on the changes in the cost of living in the area.
On Post vs. Off Post Housing.
You will receive less COLA if you live on post than you would if you lived off post. This reduction in COLA reflects your lower living expenses. Overseas Housing Allowance, however, is completely independent from COLA and the amount you receive in COLA will not affect your Overseas Housing Allowance.
Taxation of COLA.
Overseas COLA is a non-taxable allowance. Stateside COLA, however, is taxed. To offset these taxes, these COLA rates incorporate an 18% increase to cover the average income tax.

Edgemont Memorial Park

Edgemont Park is a park in Montclair, New Jersey, in the United States of America.It shares a name with the nearby Edgemont Elementary School.
History.
A committee for park construction in 1906 decided to purchase the land for the park with a $100,000 bond issue, following a town referendum. The effort to buy the land was led by William B. Dickson, who backed a quarter of the bonds issued. The land which comprised the park was originally a golf course, built 10 years prior to the park's founding. Edgemont was originally name the Harrison Tract park. The memorial was dedicated in 1925.
Overview.
The park has had problems over the past few years with Canada Geese and their droppings. 
Memorial.
The most prominent feature of the park is the pond and the small island with the World War I memorial on it. Edgemont Park is known for its World War I memorial, which is one of the landmarks of Montclair. The main memorial, created in 1924 by Charles Keck, is a tall obelisk with bronze sculptures of Winged Victory on top and the Billy Boys on the bottom. On the sides of the obelisk are etched the names of those who fell in the First World War, to whom the monument is dedicated. In front of the memorial there are small plaques that have the names of those who died in the Vietnam War and Korean War and World War II.
Electrocution of geese scandal.
The park has always had trouble with the many non-migratory Canadian Geese which live in the park, rendering it unpleasant and unusable with their copious excrement. The first plan was to discourage the public from feeding the birds while having a worker go to the pond every once in a while and shoo the geese away. Then it was decided to install devices that annoyed the geese: stuffed foxes, lasers, balloons, loud noises, plywood coyote silhouettes, and fake goose corpses were used. Sabotaging goose eggs was tried. Eventually chemicals were put into the water in an attempt to scare the geese away, had a short effect, and then ceased to work. These measures were also used in Montclair's Yantacaw Brook Park, which had similar problems with geese. Eventually the decision was made in 2007 to round up the geese and electrocute them, after which they were turned into food. despite these controversial measures, there are still geese defecating and attacking people in the park. The non-lethal measures also were a danger to herons and egrets that live in the park.

Dirk Heyne (born 10 October 1957 in Magdeburg, then East Germany) is a former German football goalkeeper turned manager.
Career.
Heyne began his footballing career at 1. FC Magdeburg's youth teams in 1967. In 1977 he had his debut in the DDR-Oberliga team and went on to tend goal in 323 Oberliga matches for 1. FC Magdeburg. His international career lasted for more than 11 years but only in the 1989/90 season Heyne was East Germany's first choice goalkeeper. In 1991, after German reunification and Magdeburg's relegation to the tier III NOFV-Oberliga Mitte, Heyne moved to Borussia Mönchengladbach, playing in 24 Bundesliga matches until 1994, when he retired from playing. 
Until 2001 he stayed at Mönchengladbach, holding several positions including the post of goalkeeper coach. In 2001 he returned to 1. FC Magdeburg, coaching the U19 youth team. In 2003 he took over managing the senior team in the tier IV NOFV-Oberliga Süd, leading them to a league title in 2006 and thus winning promotion to the Regionalliga Nord. After a successful first year in the new league, when the team finished third, missing out on promotion to 2. Bundesliga by a mere point, crisis followed. With the team lagging six points behind a non-relegation spot in the 2007–08 season, Dirk Heyne was sacked by the club.
On 4 July 2008, FC Sachsen Leipzig announced they had signed Dirk Heyne as manager for their Regionalliga Nord campaign.
Aside from his manager career, Heyne owns a goalkeeping academy near Magdeburg.

FC Grün-Weiß Wolfen

FC Grün-Weiß Wolfen is a German association football club from the industrial city of Bitterfeld-Wolfen in southern Saxony-Anhalt. They currently compete in the tier V NOFV-Oberliga Süd.
History.
After an Agfa factory had been founded in Wolfen in 1909, the city experienced a boom that also led to the creation of the "Wolfener Ballspielclub" in 1915. This club was later renamed, first becoming "VfL Wolfen" and then "IG Farben Sportverein". After World War II all sports clubs and associations in Germany were dissolved. "Sportgemeinde Wolfen" emerged as a successor side in 1945 and became part of football competition in East Germany. In November 1948, "SG"
joined "BSG Agfa Wolfen" and "BSG Einheit Wolfen" to form "ZSG Wolfen", which was renamed "BSG Chemie Agfa Wolfen" on 7 October 1949.
In 1950, the "Wolfen" team were promoted to the Landesliga Sachsen-Anhalt, then the third tier of the East German football league system. In their first season there, they earned a respectable 6th place finish, and the following season they were Landesmeister (en:state champions) of Saxony-Anhalt, winning promotion to the DDR-Liga (II).
In July 1957, the club was joined by "BSG Aktivist Sandersdorf" to form "BSG Chemie Wolfen". The Sandersdorf side was established in 1945 as "SG Sandersdorf" and played as "SG Falke Sandersdorf" (1948) before becoming "Aktivist" in 1951. After advancing to second division play in 1952, "Wolfen" generally managed mid-table results until being sent down to the Bezirksliga Halle in 1964 after a 16th place finish. They reclaimed a place in second tier play through a first place Bezirksliga finish in 1968, followed by a successful promotion playoff run.
A third place finish in the 1970–71 season nurtured hopes that "Wolfen" had successfully re-established themselves in tier II, but instead the club was sent down for breaking DFV statutes by poaching players, and financial irregularities. Despite winning immediate re-promotion out of the Berzirksliga, the club could only manage 10th and 11th finishes in 1973 and 1974, and was sent down yet again. "Wolfen" spent seven of the next eight seasons on the DDR-Liga (II) before slipping out of sight into lower level competition in 1985. Their most successful season during this period was in 1983–84 when they finished third, drawing crowds of about 1,600 spectators to watch their matches at the 10,000-capacity Jahnstadion.
In 1989, "Wolfen" won another Bezirksliga championship, failed to return to the DDR-Liga when they finished third in the promotion playoffs. 
In the FDGB Cup Chemie Wolfen had their best season in 1956, beating SC Lok Leipzig in the round of last 16, and going out in the quarter final against ASK Vorwärts Berlin.
Women's section.
More successful than their male counterparts, Wolfen's women's team was one of the pioneers in GDR women's football. Until 1982 they were part of the top flight that had been established in 1979, finishing 4th, 3rd, 2nd and 5th, respectively. Today the women's section plays in the Landesliga.
FC Grün-Weiß.
Political and economic change following German reunification led to the film factory no longer sponsoring the club. The club was renamed again, now called SG Chemie Wolfen. Four years later, on 21 January 1994, the football section left the club and created FC Grün-Weiß Wolfen. The men's team has been playing in the tier V Landes/Verbandsliga Saxony-Anhalt since 1990, as does the women's team. Thanks to sponsoring from solar panel producer Q-Cells the men's team won promotion to the Oberliga in 2008. After a very poor championship and despite its ambitions, the club was relegated after only one season. They will thus continue to play in tier VI of the German football league system, in the "Verbandsliga Sachsen-Anhalt".
Notable people.
A number of people who spent time at Chemie Wolfen have gained notability prior or after their time at the club, becoming GDR internationals, playing in the DDR-Oberliga or in Fußball-Bundesliga.

Football club (GDR)

Football club (short: FC) was a designation for the elite football teams in the GDR (German Democratic Republic, commonly East Germany). They were formed in the mid-1960s as centers of high-level football. 
After World War II and the occupation of Germany by Allied forces, a separate football competition emerged in the Soviet-held eastern half of the country. The term "FC" continued to be used in its traditional sense in West Germany, but eventually became a specialized designation in the east.
Since the introduction of the Sportclub system in the mid-1950s their football departments had dominated play in the DDR-Oberliga. In late 1965 football was granted a special status in the East German elite sports, when the footballing departments were dissociated from the Sportclubs and - under the new designation of football club - were given the same rights as sport clubs.
This special status of the sports clubs and football clubs as the only centers of elite sports led to an establishment of a two-class society in the DDR-Oberliga: The heavily supported and largely professionalized clubs dominated play in every respect, the best Betriebssportgemeinschaften (BSG) were used as a talent pool. Their players were delegated to the big football clubs. After 1954, when the sportclubs were first established, there is just one instance when a BSG won the DDR-Oberliga: BSG Chemie Leipzig were crowned champions in 1964, however, the team had been formed from two dissolved sportclubs the year before. From 1968 to 1991 only football clubs finished in the top 3 of the DDR-Oberliga.
The football clubs in the GDR.
° While the SG Dynamo Dresden was a "Sportgemeinschaft" (Sports association) by name, they had the same status as the football clubs.
°° Until 1971, the club was based in Berlin and played under the name of Vorwärts Berlin

The Band Wagon (musical)

"For the film, see The Band Wagon"
The Band Wagon is a musical revue with book by George S. Kaufman and Howard Dietz, lyrics by Howard Dietz and music by Arthur Schwartz. It first played on Broadway in 1931, running for 260 performances. It introduced the song "Dancing in the Dark" and inspired two films.
Production.
The revue opened on Broadway at the New Amsterdam Theatre on June 3, 1931 and closed on January 16, 1932, running a total of 260 performances. Produced by Max Gordon, staging and lighting were by Hassard Short, choreography by Albertina Rasch, and scenic design by Albert R. Johnson. The cast included Fred Astaire, Adele Astaire, Helen Broderick, Tilly Losch, and Frank Morgan. 
According to Steven Suskin, "very few people are around who saw "The Band Wagon", but they all seem to insist that it was the finest Broadway revue ever." According to Furia and Lasser, "The Band Wagon" is "arguably the greatest of the 'little' revues of the 1930s". Ken Bloom states that "The Band Wagon" "is considered the greatest of all revues." 
The show introduced one of the best Schwartz-Dietz songs, "Dancing in the Dark", which was also the title of one of the two motion pictures made from this show. (The other was "The Band Wagon.") This was the first New York production to use the double revolving stage for the songs and sketches. Although it had incomparable dancing by Fred and Adele Astaire, it was the last time the brother and sister team appeared together.
Sketches.
A parody of the set pieces of the typical show, involved moonlight seranade, the waltz number, and the overworked blackout ("Where Can He Be?") and ("Nanette"). In the "Pour le Bain" sketch, Helen Broderick is a Westchester matron shopping for bathroom fixtures in an expensive store, including bathtubs and washbowls. Noting that there was no mention of the "other fixture," the salesman replies with a line of poetry from Keats -- "Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard/ Are sweeter," followed by a blackout. Frank Morgan, a Southern colonel in "The Pride of the Claghornes," throws his daughter out because she never did anything wrong, thereby going against Southern tradition. Percy Hammond repeatedly noted about the attractive chorus girls "They look, as Miss Laurette Taylor used to say, as if they all had mothers."
In "Good Old Nectar," instead of cheering the football star, the old graduates cheer the history champion (Adele Astaire, Fred Astaire, John Barker, Phillip Loeb, Frank Morgan, Francis Pierlot, Roberta Robinson, Jay Wilson).
Recording.
In October 5, 1931, RCA Victor pressed a two-sided record (program transcription) cut at 33 RPM of the "Band Wagon" score, featuring Fred and Adele Astaire, composers Dietz and Schwartz, and Leo Reisman's Orchestra (including jazz trumpeter Bubber Miley). This record (L-24003) was one of the first commercially recorded at that speed. (This was part of the new long playing "Program Transcription" series requiring a special 2-speed phonograph. Due to the Depression, they were never good sellers.)

Bisi Alimi

Bisi Alimi (born Ademola Iyandade Ojo Kazeem Alimi, 17 January 1975) is a Nigerian gay rights activist, public speaker, blog writer and HIV/LGBT advocate who achieved notoriety when he became the first Nigerian to come out of the closet on television.
Early life.
Born in the Mushin district of Lagos to parents Raski Ipadeola Balogun Alimi (a Nigerian police officer) and Idiatu Alake Alimi (a university clerk), Alimi was raised in Lagos where he attended primary and secondary school. He was the third in a family of five children from his mother and sixth from a family of ten children from his father. He later changed his name to Adebisi Alimi.
Bisi attended Eko Boys’ High School, in Lagos, and graduated in 1993. He led his school cultural dances both at primary and secondary school to many awards and honors. He was a member of his secondary school literary and debating society and a Social Prefect (where he organized social activities) in his senior year Also, in 1993, he gained admission into Ogun State Polytechnic, and would later study Creative Arts, majoring in Theatre at University of Lagos. It was during his tenure at university that his sexuality attracted media attention after "Campus Lifestyle", the university’s magazine outed him as a gay man. Prior to the magazine outing, Bisi had experienced much discrimination within the campus, including facing a disciplinary committee on the accusation of his gay status. Although he did graduate, he was nearly refused his certificate as it was believed that his morals were unacceptable for an alumnus of the university.
He then followed that at Birkbeck College, University of London, where he earned his Master’s degree in Global Governance and Public Policy. 
"New Dawn with Funmi".
Prior to his public self-outing, Bisi Alimi began his career in late 1990s in Nigeria when his friends were dying due to HIV/AIDS. After 2 years of doing community mobilization work and condom distribution among Gay men and Men who have Sex with other Men (MSM) in Nigeria, he joined the Alliance Rights Nigeria (ARN) in 2002 as a Program Director developing and providing HIV/AIDS and sexual health services and supports. 
In his capacity as ARN Program Director, He was at the heart of developing Nigerian MSM HIV prevention framework in 2004. He was trained by the International AIDS Alliance in 2004 as HIV project Designer, Community Mobiliser, Care, Support and Treatment. That same year, Bisi was diagnosed with HIV. 
Alimi's turning point came in 2004 when he became the first Nigerian gay man to appear on national television as a guest on Funmi Iyanda's "New Dawn with Funmi", a talk show on the NTA; it was on this show that Alimi confirmed his sexuality as a homosexual and asked for social acceptance from the public. His decision to come out of the closet generated potential love interests and death threats, and Alimi was disowned by his family and most of his friends - including some in the gay community - ejected from his home and made redundant, and "New Dawn 's" live format was cancelled. Future guests on the pre-recorded version were screened by NTA executive producers to avoid what was considered "causing public offence".
Activism.
Shortly after coming out, Alimi was chosen as a representative to give face to homosexuality in Nigeria at the 4th National Conference on HIV/AIDS held in Abuja. He later became a Nigerian gay rights activist leading several peaceful protests and social dialogues to demand acceptance of homosexuals in Nigeria. In July 2005, The Independent Project for Equal Rights-Nigeria was founded by Alimi with a group of friends. He served as Executive Director of this organization where he pioneered several Nigerian LGBT Youth Group initiatives until April 2007. He also worked as director of Nigeria youth programmes at Alliance Rights organization. However, his controversial interview on national television in 2004 had become catalyst for the proposed motion on "Anti-Same Sex Bill" of 2006 that was presented to law makers in the Nigerian National Assembly. The motion for this controversial “Anti-Same Sex” bill was presented before the legislative house three times between 2006 and 2011.
An attempt on Alimi’s life in 2007 prompted his decision to leave Nigeria as continued repression of gay rights and hostile oppositions against LGBT organizations in the country created a grim hope. He quickly migrated to the United Kingdom where he later applied for and was granted protection asylum in 2008. In 2011 he completed his Master's in Politics from Birkbeck University in "Global Governance and Public Policy". His academic research is titled “Access to Anti-retroviral Medications in Middle, Low income countries and the Intellectual Property Rights”.
Now residing in London, Alimi has continued his advocacy on gay rights within Migrant African communities. He has worked for organizations in the UK including Naz Project London, Michael Bell Research and Consultancy and HIV I-Base.
Bisi also worked with AHPN, Terrence Higgins Trust and Mesmac in the North East of England to set up a project for newly arrived African gay immigrants to the United Kingdom. He was selected a member of the IAS youth organizing member for Mexico 2008 and was a member of AmfAR review panel for the international grants for African MSM AIDS initiative 2009 and 2011 respectively. He joined Kaleidoscope Trust in 2011 as the Director in charge of Africa. 
Presently Alimi is steering a community engagement project for Migrant African MSM in the United Kingdom and has remained visible in leading debates and discussions on sexual health issues of Black and African gay men.
Awards.
Bisi Alimi was listed in the “Independent on Sunday” Pink List of most influential LGBT people in Britain in 2011, 2012, 2013, peaking at number 90 in 2012.
He was listed third on the 100 most influential Non White Atheist and Free thinkers in Britain and Northern Ireland. 
On New Year’s day, 2014, he was named to The Gay UK LGBT 2014 honour list in recognition of his exemplary work to Education in the LGBT community and he has been nominated for an “Out In The City magazine’s” Diversity Champion of the Year Award. The Out In The City award is known as "UK LGBT Oscar".

<doc id="18423220" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18423220" title="Generalized game theory">
Generalized game theory

Generalized game theory is an extension of game theory incorporating social theory concepts such as norm, value, belief, role, social relationship, and institution. The theory was developed by Tom R. Burns, Anna Gomolinska, and Ewa Roszkowska but has not had great influence beyond these immediate associates. The theory seeks to address certain perceived limitations of game theory by formulating a theory of rules and rule complexes and to develop a more robust approach to socio-psychological and sociological phenomena.
Overview.
In generalized game theory, games are conceptualized as rule complexes, which is a set containing rules and/or other rule complexes. However, the rules may be imprecise, inconsistent, and even dynamic. Distinctions in the properties and functions of different types of rules allows the rules themselves to be analyzed in complex ways, and thus the models of the theory more closely represent relationships and institutions investigated in the social sciences.
The ways in which the rules may be changed is developed within the context of generalized game theory based on the principle of rule revision and game restructuring. These types of games are referred to as open games, that is, games which are open to transformation. Games which have specified, fixed players, fixed preference structures, fixed optimization procedures, and fixed action alternatives and outcomes are called closed games (characteristic of most classical game theory models).
Because its premises derive from social theory generalized game theory emphasizes and provides cultural and institutional tools for game conceptualization and analysis, what Granovetter (1985) refers to as the social embeddedness of interaction and social and economic processes. This is in contrast to conceptualization of games consisting of actors which are autonomous utility maximizers. Further, the modeling of the actors themselves in generalized game theory is especially open to the use of concepts such as incomplete information and bounded rationality.
Proponents of generalized game theory have advocated the application of the theory to reconceptualizing individual and collective decision-making, resolutions of the prisoners' dilemma game, agent-based modeling, fuzzy games, conflict resolution procedures, challenging and providing robust and normatively grounded alternatives to Nash equilibrium and Pareto optimality, among others.
Principles.
Judgment in generalized game theory.
A key aspect of actors decision making in generalized game theory is based on the concept of judgment. Several types of judgment could be relevant, for instance value judgment, factual judgment, and action judgment. In the case of action judgment, the actor seeks to take the course of action offered by the rules of the game which most closely fit the values held by the actor (where the values are a sub-rule complex of the game). 
Even the method by which the actor calculates closeness of fit can be controlled by the actors values (such as an actor might use a more speedy algorithm, or a more far-sighted one). Each actor has a judgment operator by which the actor can create a preference order of the perceived qualities of possible outcomes based on satisfying the condition that the qualities of the outcomes can be roughly said to be sufficiently similar to the qualities of the actors primary values or norms. Thus, in generalized game theory, each actor's judgment calculus includes the institutional context of the game.
General game solutions.
A general or common game solution is a strategy or interaction order for the agents which satisfies or realizes the relevant norms and values of the players. This should lead to a state that is acceptable by the game players, and is not necessarily a normative equilibrium, but represents the "best result attainable under the circumstances". 
Solutions may be reached through a sequence of proposed alternatives, and when the actors find the ultimate solution acceptable, the proposed solutions may be said to be convergent. Roszkowska and Burns (2002) showed that not every game has a common solution, and that divergent proposals may arise. This may result in a no equilibrium being found, and stems from dropping the assumption for the existence of a Nash equilibrium that the game be finite or that the game have complete information. Another possibility is the existence of a rule which allows a dictator to force an equilibrium. The rules which make up the norms of the game are one way of resolving the problem of choosing between multiple equilibria, such as those arising in the so-called folk theorem.
Example: prisoner's dilemma.
In the example of the two-player prisoner's dilemma, for instance, proponents of generalized game theory are critical of the rational Nash equilibrium wherein both actors defect because rational actors, it is argued, would actually be predisposed to work out coordinating mechanisms in order to achieve optimum outcomes. Although these mechanisms are not usually included in the rules of the game, generalized game theorists argue that they do exist in real life situations. 
This is because there exists in most interaction situations a social relationship between the players characterized by rules and rule complexes. This relationship may be one of, for instance, solidarity (which results in the Pareto optimal outcome), adversary (which results in the Nash equilibrium), or even hierarchy (by which one actor sacrifices their own benefits for the other's good). Some values, such as pure rivalry, are seen as nonstable because both actors would seek asymmetric gain, and thus would need to either transform the game or seek another value to attempt to satisfy. 
If no communication mechanism is given (as is usual in the prisoner's dilemma), the operative social relationship between the actors is based on the actors own beliefs about the other (perhaps as another member of the human race, solidarity will be felt, or perhaps as an adversary). This illustrates the principle of game transformation, which is a key element of the theory.

The 1931 Belize hurricane was a devastating Category 4 tropical cyclone that struck British Honduras on 10 September 1931, killing an estimated 2,500 people. Although weaker than Hurricane Hattie of 1961, it remains the deadliest hurricane and natural disaster in British Honduras history. The hurricane was first detected as a tropical wave off the west coast of Africa on 29 August. Moving westward, the disturbance remained relatively weak till 6 September, when it was first classified as a tropical cyclone just west of the Windward Islands. The depression gradually intensified, reaching tropical storm intensity within the first six hours following tropical cyclogenesis. The cyclone intensified further to hurricane intensity by 8 September. Strengthening and organization remained gradual until the storm reached the Gulf of Honduras, by which time it began to rapidly intensify. The tropical cyclone quickly attained Category 4 hurricane intensity. The hurricane subsequently made landfall on Belize City on 10 September with maximum sustained winds of 135 mph (215 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 952 mbar (hPa; 28.12 inHg). Moving across the Yucatán Peninsula, the tropical cyclone weakened, and continued to weaken when it moved across the Bay of Campeche. This track brought it to a second landfall north of Tampico, Mexico as a tropical storm on 13 September. Once inland, the storm quickly weakened, and dissipated later that day.
Meteorological history.
The hurricane began as a tropical wave—a westbound low-pressure area—first observed southeast of Cape Verde on 29 August. Traversing the tropical Atlantic, the wave retained a minimum barometric pressure of about 1010 mbar (hPa; 29.83 inHg) and strengthened briefly the following day. By 1 September, however, the wave had become rather weak and indiscernible; it would remain as such for much of its early existence till 6 September, by which time it had moved past the Windward Islands. In this region the system became sufficiently organised to be classified as a tropical depression at 1800 UTC that same day, about north-north-west of Grenada. Some six hours after its inception the depression strengthened to a tropical storm over the eastern Caribbean Sea. Owing to a lack of ship observations, data on the storm were scarce in that region. The first ship to identify the storm clearly was the tanker "Geo H. Jones", which recorded strong winds in conjunction with rapidly decreasing barometric pressures late on 7 September. As the storm remained north-north-westbound across the Caribbean, more ships were able to record data on the cyclone.
At 1800 UTC on September 8, the tropical storm attained hurricane intensity. Intensification remained gradual until the hurricane moved into the Gulf of Honduras by September 10, when the hurricane began to rapidly intensify. At 0000 UTC on September 10, the cyclone intensified into a Category 2 hurricane. The storm strengthened further before reaching its peak intensity with as a Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 135 mph (215 km/h) at 1800 UTC. The strong hurricane made landfall on Belize City at the same intensity two hours later. A barometer in the city recorded a minimum pressure of 952 mbar (hPa; 28.12 mbar); this was the lowest barometric pressure measured in association with the storm. The hurricane substantially weakened over the Yucatán Peninsula, and had weakened to tropical storm strength by the time it had entered the Bay of Campeche. Despite moving back over water, the tropical cyclone continued to weaken in the bay, and made its final landfall roughly 60–70 mi (95–110 km) north of Tampico, Mexico with winds of 40 mph (65 km/h) at around 0000 UTC on September 13. Over the mountainous terrain of Mexico, the storm quickly weakened, and dissipated later on September 13.
Preparations, impact, and aftermath.
September 10, the day of the hurricane, is also a national holiday for British Honduras, on which many locals gather in the streets to celebrate the defeat of Spanish conquerors by the British in 1798. It is widely believed that the hurricane struck without any warning, although some recent historians have disputed this. In his column for "The Belize Times" on September 5, 2004, Emory King claimed that Belizean authorities withheld continuous warnings from U.S. ships in the region of a possible hurricane strike on British Honduras so the festivities would not be interrupted. King cited as evidence a letter dated September 24, 1931, from a local radio operator to the Colonial Secretary in which the warnings were discussed, adding that "perhaps none of authorities had ever been in a hurricane and didn't know exactly how bad it was going to be."

Sejdo Bajramović

Sejdo Bajramović (1927–1993) was a Yugoslav soldier and politician of the former Yugoslavia, who was the acting head of state of Yugoslavia for a brief time in 1991. 
Bajramović was elected as Member of the Presidency representing Kosovo, when the Serbian president Slobodan Milošević out-maneuvred the incumbent Riza Sapunxhiu, through a recall by the Serbian Parliament. In the same move, he also became acting head of state (Coordinator of the Presidency) of Yugoslavia, as Milošević initially refused to accept the President-designate Stipe Mesić, representing Croatia, and unilaterally declared the presidency incapable of functioning. 
As the provincial legislature of Kosovo was suspended, Bajramović was appointed as presidency member by the Assembly of the Republic of Serbia. His unquestioned loyalty to Milošević and obvious lack of a democratic mandate in difference to the rest of the Presidency, made him remembered as a mere puppet for the Milošević administration and his name became synonymous with "quisling", "proxy" and "false alibi". 
Bajramović's only merit before being handpicked by Milošević to vote on behalf of Kosovo, was being a Sergeant First Class in the Yugoslav People's Army.
