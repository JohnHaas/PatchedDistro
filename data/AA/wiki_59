Military sociology

Military sociology aims toward the systematic study of the military as a social group rather than as a Military organization. It is a highly specialized subfield which examines issues related to service personnel as a distinct group with coerced collective action based on shared interests linked to survival in vocation and combat, with purposes and values that are more defined and narrow than within civil society. Military sociology also concerns civil-military relations and interactions between other groups or governmental agencies.
Contemporary military sociology.
Contemporary military sociology is primarily a result of the World War II and Cold War eras. These events initiated the systematic study of military sociology, though it stands to reason that the relationship between the military and society would predate these events. There are numerous topics within military sociology, and it is important to note that its scope is not exclusively limited to the military institution itself or to its members. Rather, military sociology encompasses areas such as civilian-military relations and the relationship between the military and other military groups or governmental agencies. Other topics within military sociology include:
Military as a society.
Military as an occupation.
There has been discussion about whether the military should be seen as more of an occupation rather than an institution. Although the military still retains institutional principles (patriotic values, historic traditions, etc.) the military is becoming oriented to the principles of business and economics and can be fairly categorized as a profession. This can be explored in relating to other professions in the grouping of power and compensation. There are different ranks within the military, granting some people more power. Many young people look to the military for compensation benefits and the opportunity to attend college without enormous loans. Military profession holds the view that it is a unique profession. There are six key elements that are paramount in shaping the character of the military profession, according to Sam C. Sarkesian and Robert E. Connor. These are listed as:
Recruitment practices.
Perhaps no other institution places as much emphasis on procedures for assimilating new members as does the armed forces. Assimilation involves the continuous process of recruitment, selection, training, and career development. Not only must the new recruit, officer, or enlisted officer learn new and difficult skills. He or she is also expected to master an elaborate code of professional behavior and etiquette, since membership in the military means participation in an organizational community which regulates behavior both on and off the "job". The American Military utilizes the citizen-soldier concept to gather military personnel from across the country. This term means the ability to quickly round up or call up troops for war or military tour at a virtual moment's notice. But once the assignment or tour is over, the military personnel are returned to civilian life.
According to Norman A. Hilman 2.5 million men were enlisted into military during the peacetime draft. During that rapid transitional period, many soldiers may have felt lost or confused by the differences in their previous life (civilian) and their new military life, which calls for a demand to conform to new orders that are expected to be followed without question. Although, there were many men and now women who have voluntarily joined in the armed forces, there are those who view joining the military and working for the government as selling out. The negative characterization of military life can be a real turn off for most people looking from the outside. Despite the negative thoughts about military life and the incentives of economic security, military recruitment practices changed from a means to help one's country into a way to attain an education back to a need to serve one's country, in recent years. Throughout its changes the enlisting numbers have not declined, they have stayed steady, if not increasing over the years.
The effects of military life on dependants (and the influence of military dependent subcultures).
A military family by definition is a unit that may consist of husband and wife and children (in many English-speaking countries, called military brats, which is a term of respect and endearment, not an insult); with either the husband and/or wife as the primary military enlisted. The emotional stress that a partner can experience, before, during and after a soldier, sailor, marine or airman's deployment is perhaps just as bad mentally, as the one who is fighting in the military. Those whose husbands or wives were deployed for the first time, rated their feelings about the whole experience as being very sad, and found it difficult to cope with the sudden absence of their loved one. However, women or men whose spouses have been deployed prior, coped with the present deployment with more positive reactions. They felt that they had a job to do away from home that was important and they and the rest of their family (children) had to be supportive and take care of things while the family member was away. Children begin taking on more adult responsibilities like: cooking, cleaning, getting groceries, etc. Despite the positive coping skills of some military families, some do not do well on their own coping with the long separation from their family and family members. Stressors and stress reactions of spouses vary over time. What is perceived as stressful before the deployment differs from what is perceived as stressful during and after the deployment. Most deployments last 6–18 months, and during this time, the role that the members of the family believe they should hold changes. This often makes it difficult for all members of the family.
Approximately one-fifth of all enlisted 18-year-olds and one-third of all junior personnel in the United States Army are married, compared to less than 5% of civilian 18-year-olds. As a result, young military families experience many of the same hardships that can accompany the start of a family in greater numbers than young civilian families. Like young civilian families, young military families may also experience maturity issues, life inexperience, low incomes, and living away from home. But these issues are compounded by the fact that young military families also experience special hardships not experienced by young civilian families. For example, while many young families, both military and civilian, often endure difficulties, civilian families are more likely to have the support of family and friends which is less likely to be an option for military families (e.g. on a military base stationed in a foreign country).
Another hardship experienced more commonly by military families (compared with civilian families) is frequent relocation. Approximately 33% of military families relocate every year compared to only 5% of civilian families. Special planning must be undertaken by families in which both parents are on active duty, as either could be (re)deployed at any time. (Planning for this contingency can be especially difficult.) In other military families with only one active-duty-parent, the other parent is less likely to stay at home with children as in the past. Rather, they are more likely to find employment and/or attend college, and therefore find constant relocations more stressful due to the commitments to working and studying, respectively.
Military families have the option of living at the parents’ place of employment. For families living in an on-base house, they must follow the rules of the base command and the housing office on how to maintain their property and are afforded little privacy. In short, they may experience pressure to conform to the base’s standards of behavior. Some families may opt not to live on base, but off-base housing is usually more expensive and can be inconvenient.
Stress and military service.
De Soir suggests there are seven stages in the way partners of married personnel experience stress before, during and after deployment.
Age as a factor.
In the United States, almost half of the enlisted force is below 25 for both men and women with the average age being 27. The trend of youth is perpetuated by the fact that most people enter into the service at 18 years of age and leave after only a few years. This creates a situation in which those with college experience are underrepresented in military as they only make up 8.5% of the military force. Youth inclusion in armed conflict is not a new concept or one restricted to large well organized forces such as the United States military. In various societies over time, youth has been prized in armed conflict. Such instances include the Dinka of the Sudan, boys who received spears as an initiation rite between sixteen and eighteen years of age, the nineteenth-century Cheyenne who joined their first war parties when they were about fourteen, and the female warriors of Dahomey who were recruited between nine and fifteen. During the American Civil War, it has been estimated that between 250,000 and 420,000 soldiers under 18 years of age served in Union and Confederate armies, which yields somewhere between 10 and 20 percent of recruits. During these earlier periods youth was not looked upon in the context of innocence as it is framed today, rather children were seen as naturally existing with adults, as they frequently coexisted with them through apprenticeships and other work. It was not until formal education became more widespread that a change in attitudes towards youth develop, and consequently a prolongation of the perceived youth period.
Religion in the military.
In the past, all U.S. service academies required attendance to religious services which in 1972 was found to be unconstitutional by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in Anderson v. Laird. Despite this, the Naval Academy still has prayer before meals and attendance is required at these meals. This has caused some students at the Naval Academy to seek legal help from the American Civil Liberties Union. A comparable practice of pre-meal prayers for compulsory meals at the Virginia Military Institute was found unconstitutional by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Mellen v. Bunting in 2003.
The religious spectrum of the United States military is comparable to that of the general population. In comparison with the nearest available age group, a demographic of 20- to 39-year-olds that make up eighty percent of the military, there are slight variations. Mainline Protestants, Catholics, Jews, Muslims, and Buddhists are underrepresented, but other Christian religions (such as the Christian and Missionary Alliance, Church of God, Seventh Day Adventists, Assemblies of God, and others) disproportionately overrepresented, at nearly three times the percentage in the applicable demographic. Those reporting atheism or no religion are very slightly overrepresented. None of these differences account for more than a 10% spread, Christians self-identifying as Protestant only constituting the largest discrepancy. The data and other studies suggest that servicemembers may be less likely to identify with mainstream religious organizations than the country's general population.
Minorities in the military.
Throughout history non-indigenous members of minority groups have been absorbed into military service. Examples of this practice in ancient armies include Hannibal's use of Ethiopian soldiers, the Roman Auxilia, the Byzantine Empire's recruitment of the Middle Eastern population, and the Ottoman Empire's use of religious minorities through the Millet system. In these cases where military service was voluntary, minorities saw it as an opportunity to progress socially in the society, and perhaps achieve citizenship for themselves and by extension, to their children. For most of the history of minority groups in military organizations, minorities were often segregated from the dominant racial group by forming separate contingents for such groups. This was true in ancient military organizations, but also in a more recent historical context through the French-Canadian regiments of Canada during World War I, and World War II, the British army and their conscription of various minority groups from their conquests during colonialism, and the segregation of minority groups into Caucasian commanded, minority composed, regiments during similar time periods as mentioned previously. In the case of the United States, African-American participation in the military after World War II was high due to the better treatment afforded African-Americans in the military by Caucasian members. With the end of job exclusion by 1954 reenlistment rates increased on average until they were close to double that of Caucasian servicemen. A similar situation arose in the United Kingdom with minority participation, but both situations saw a sharp disparity in upper rank distribution, as both had, and to a lesser extent, still have a disproportionately low level of upper ranked minorities.
Women in the military.
The roles of women can include being the transmitter of cultural values to children, reproducers of boundaries and active militants in national struggles. Women have served in the military throughout history. Women's military recruitment rejects the idea that 'women should be protected'. Recruitment is very important in Latin America, Israel, Nicaragua, Rwanda and Northern Ireland. In Turkey, the wife of the chief commander represents the mother of the military family. Some states in the developing world are egalitarian and many women are recruited into the military to achieve the modern ideal. With women's customary role as a nurturer and mother, the increased equality and inclusion of women in the military could change the reason for war or raison d'être of wars.
The advancement of military technology is breaking down barriers for women to enter military service.
There has historically been a role for women as military nurses. The major issue though in contemporary society has to do with women involved in combat units, especially those engaged in ground combat.
During World War II women served in the Women's Army Auxiliary Corp (WAAC) which was later renamed Women's Army Corps (WAC). In addition, there was WAVES, or Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Services.
Homosexuality and the military.
Homosexuals were not recruited into the U.S. military from World War II to the Clinton presidency. In 1993, the Clinton administration began the policy of "Don't ask, Don't tell, Don't pursue", meaning that military personnel will be neither compelled ("Don't ask") nor allowed ("Don't tell") nor harassed ("Don't pursue") to disclose or discuss their sexual identity while serving in the military. The "Don't ask, Don't tell, Don't pursue" policy actually had the effect of increasing discharges due to homosexuality from 617 in 1994 to 1,273 in
2001. Estimates have been made that in 2000 there were 1 million gay and lesbian veterans in the U.S. population as based on census information. Homosexual women with partners reported higher rates of military service than other women, while homosexual male veterans served for a similar amount of time as heterosexual male veterans.
Military Science.
Recently there has been interest in how the modern militaries have constructed their knowledge. Military science in modern armed forces has taken on the aura of a hard science when it is arguably a combination of hard science, sociology ("soft science"), and military history (the humanities). Postmodern deconstructions of the assumptions behind modern military science can be effective in revealing how modern militaries have socially constructed their reality.
Military and society.
Political control of the military.
In the modern relationship between the military and the state, the state relies on the military to protect it from external threats as well as violence between various internal groups. Concurrently, the military draws so-called 'violent resources' from the state and from society. Such resources can include money, technology, raw materials, and manpower. The relationship has changed somewhat from the 16th and 17th centuries, however, where internal centers of power and specific sectors of society (e.g., skilled builders or guilds) were somewhat more autonomous than the rest. These sectors were not under the direct control of the sovereign power and could avoid feeding resources to the state. This meant that pre-modern militaries were 1) somewhat weaker than the modern version due to a lack of state-funded resources but also 2) powerful sectors of society that controlled certain privately funded resources and which could raise their own mercenary forces if needed.
As this system began to evolve, states started to exert more control over society by exploiting 'existential fears' which led to the creation of various bureaucratic methods including mass conscription, tax systems, and territorial centralization. The result is that various civil sectors began to work exclusively for the state, which in turn desired a stronger military, and which used these sectors to extract more resources and more manpower for exclusive military use. This 'modern' military now was reliant on the state for its very existence, whereas, in pre-modern times, the military could be the tool of various autonomous sectors of society.
Military's use of research and industry.
Burkard Schmitt a Research Fellow for the EU Institute for Security Studies identifies two types of research. Pure research is done from the bottom-up with no specific demand and are long term oriented. Capability research is done from the top down, most research of this type is defined for mostly military use with a specific goal in mind.
Few European countries have had significant investments in research and technology. National sensitivities and defense companies that are hesitant to share research findings has long hindered research in Europe. This is beginning to change with the formation and strengthening of the EU and the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). The EU is currently implementing its "Agenda for advanced research relating to global security" which is crucial to the future of European security. The idea in Europe is that research should be undertaken by all member states. A goal for member states and something to aid future research is a "harmonization" of military requirements.
The American model for research is based on the old German standard, which the Americans emulated starting from the founding of the American Chemical Society in 1876. The use of research and industry to develop new and more deadly chemical and biological weapons is an intriguing aspect of the modern military. German universities were involved in early chemical gas development for use in World War I. German universities "carefully cultivated the ideal of science as an emphatically value-free activity; they bestowed upon their wards the right and the duty to serve the interests of knowledge and to brush aside other interests with which the welfare of scientific pursuits might clash." American universities also had chemical labs, Harvard University began work on poison gas in 1917. By World War I, the chemical industry began to influence politics because of the great interdependence between industry, military and politics.
The amount of research that is done relates to the U.S. economy. The U.S. is thought to be in a permanent war economy, boasting the largest military budget in the world. This has created a strong link between military, the state, and corporate America. This has been coined the military industrial complex, but the military has also dominated large university science departments. This concept is the military industrial academic complex, or MIA.

Tracker Fund of Hong Kong

Tracker Fund of Hong Kong or TraHK () () is a unit trust which provides investment results that correspond to the performance of the Hang Seng Index in the Hong Kong stock market.
History.
In 1998, the Hong Kong SAR Government acquired a substantial portfolio of Hong Kong shares to sustain linked exchange rate during the Asian Financial Crisis. To minimize disruption to the market, the Government chose to launch the IPO of the exchange-traded fund, "the Tracker Fund of Hong Kong", in 1999 as the first step in its disposal programme.
In August 1998, the Hong Kong Government acquired a substantial portfolio of Hong Kong shares during a market operation. The Exchange Fund Investment Limited (EFIL) was established in October 1998 by the Government to advise on the disposal of this portfolio in an orderly manner.
When seeking to dispose of these shares, the Government chose a stock neutral solution that would create minimal disruption to the market. An Exchange Traded Fund, the Tracker Fund of Hong Kong (TraHK), which met these requirements and added depth to Hong Kong's capital markets, was launched in November 1999 as the first step in the Government's disposal programme. State Street Global Advisors Asia Ltd was appointed as the Fund Manager and State Street Bank and Trust Company was appointed as the Trustee of TraHK. These appointments provided the Tracker Fund with a comprehensive solution to its needs, including portfolio management, custody, fund administration and compliance monitoring functions.
With an issue size of HK$33.3 billion (approximately US$ 4.3 billion), TraHK's Initial Public Offering (IPO) was the largest IPO ever in Asia except Japan at the time of launch. Since the IPO, approximately HK$ 140.4 billion (by 15 October 2002) in Hang Seng Index constituent stocks has been returned to the market through TraHK's unique tap mechanism.

Timothy Williams (author)

Timothy Williams (born 1946) is a bilingual British author who has written five novels in English featuring Commissario Piero Trotti, a character critics have referred to as a personification of modern Italy. Williams' books include "Black August", which won a Crime Writers' Association award. His novels have been translated into French, Italian, Danish, Russian, Bulgarian, Polish, and Japanese.
Williams' first French novel, "Un autre soleil", set in the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, was published in Paris by Rivages in March 2011 and was published in English in New York in April 2013 as "Another Sun".
Williams was born in Walthamstow (Essex, now London) and attended Woodford Green Preparatory School, Chigwell School and St Andrews University. He has previously lived in France, Italy, and in Romania, where he worked for the British Council.
Williams is among the small number of authors writing Italian crime novels in English (including Magdalen Nabb, Michael Dibdin, and Donna Leon), three of whom are British and were born in the span of a single year. Ms. Nabb's "Death of an Englishman" was published in 1981 and Williams' "Converging Parallels" followed in 1982. Williams is also the author of a soon to be published series of cr"Italic text"ime novels set in Guadeloupe in the French West Indies featuring Anne Marie Lavaud, a juge d'instruction. Mr. Williams, who holds dual British/French citizenship, currently lives on the island of Guadeloupe and teaches in the main lycée of Pointe à Pitre.
For the Observer Timothy Williams is one of the ten best European crime novelists. "The five books in Williams’s Commissario Trotti series, written from 1982–96, are hard to find, but if you liked Zen (Dibdin’s books or the TV series) you’ll enjoy Trotti just as much. A delight." 
Cultural milieu.
Commissario Trotti investigates crime in a small, unnamed city on the river Po in the north of Italy (sometimes erroneously identified as Padua). Trotti's career spans much of the First Republic, from the period known as the "Italian Miracle" through the Anni di Piombo. This milieu keeps the Polizia di Stato busy and in his enquiries Trotti frequently confronts problems facing Italian society: terrorism, political instability, corruption, socialism under Craxi, Operation Clean Hands ("mani pulite"), and above all, the decline of civilised intercourse.
Writing in a minimalist style, in which he relies largely on dialogue to advance the plot, Williams has at times been considered a demanding author. One critic complained that the books read like translations from Italian. Some readers find that pace and tension are sacrificed for sociology and politics and that the moody, brooding Trotti, addicted to rhubarb sweets, is too slow and too wordy for their taste.
Characterization.
The novels are populated with an array of acquaintances, colleagues, criminals, and the occasional walk-on, which together present a spectrum of the Italian national character. The author often uses minor characters to demonstrate the Italian penchant for labyrinthine and sometimes obfuscatory dialogue.
Having grown up under Fascism and having lost a brother in the partisan war of 1943-45, Piero Trotti is cynical yet dourly optimistic. By the fifth novel this optimism is in scant evidence. Trotti's estranged wife lives in America. A number of women find Trotti appealing but Trotti is torn in his loyalty to the marriage.
The primary characters, Trotti and the two subalterns with whom he works, employ a more restrained, direct discourse. Trotti himself is not expressive and seems impervious to personal relationships, but both lieutenants form close bonds with their demanding mentor. Magagna eventually leaves for Milan, in part to escape Trotti’s overwhelming influence. Pisanelli, who replaces Magagna as Trotti’s foil, is unable to remove himself from Trotti’s orbit and comes to both admire and resent his superior.
In the early novels Trotti's daughter Pioppi suffers from anorexia, a fact which continues to haunt Trotti for years, long after her recovery, and causes him to question his role as a father. In the later novels, Trotti is a grandfather to two little girls who give meaning to his life.
Anne-Marie Laveaud.
In 2012 Rivages Noir published "Un autre soleil", a crime novel set in the island "département" of Guadeloupe, in the French Caribbean. In 2013, the book was published by Soho Crime. 
In 1980, the ex-convict, Hegesippe Bray, returning home after forty years spent in the penal colony of Cayenne, has been charged with the murder of a white landowner who was running him off his property. Nine months before the French presidential elections of 1981, for political reasons, the authorities wish to view the murder as an open-and-shut case of revenge killing. Anne Marie Laveaud, the "juge d'instruction" (investigative magistrate) in charge of the case, does not agree. To learn the truth, she will put herself, her career and her family in jeopardy.

Mark Beaufoy

Colonel Mark Beaufoy FRS (1764–1827) was an English astronomer and physicist, mountaineer, explorer and British Army officer. His father, Mark Beaufoy (1718–1782), who was originally from Evesham, established a vinegar factory in Lambeth, London. 
He was the first-known English climber to make an ascent of a high mountain in the Alps. In 1787, he made an ascent (the fourth) of Mont Blanc. This mountain was an attraction to his fellow countrymen, such as J. D. Forbes (1809–1868), A.T. Malkin (1803–1888), John Ball (1818–1889) and Sir Alfred Wills (1828–1912). He describes his ascent of Mont Blanc: 
He devoted much of his life to naval experiments at the Greenland Dock with James Scott and Captain John Luard of the "Society for the Improvement in Naval Architecture"; a volume "Nautical and Hydraulic Experiments with Numerous Scientific Miscellanies" was published by his son Henry in 1834 (one volume only, called Volume I). He also made astronomical observations and advocated other ideas like rifles in the militia and schemes for reaching the North Pole. 
He married his cousin Margaretta Beaufoy (died 1800) in a 1784 "runaway" marriage, after which they had a "long sojurn" in Switzerland. They had three sons (Henry, Mark and George) and a daughter; Margaretta took the infant girl Henriette to watch Mark ascend Mont Blanc. She assisted him with mathematical and astronomical calculations. 
Beaufoy was commissioned Captain of the Hackney Volunteer Company in 1794 and Colonel of the 1st Regiment of Tower Hamlets Militia in 1797. However, in October 1813 he was court-martialled for the "vexatious and frivolous" disciplining of a junior officer and was relieved of his command in January 1814.
His grandson, Mark Hanbury Beaufoy, was an English vinegar manufacturer and politician. The family firm is now called British Vinegars Limited.

Mimusops elengi

Mimusops elengi is a medium-sized evergreen tree found in tropical forests in South Asia, Southeast Asia and northern Australia. English common names include Spanish cherry, medlar, and bullet wood. In it is called "maulsari" in Hindi, "bakul" in Sanskrit, Bengali, "Elanji" (ഇലഞ്ഞി) in Malayalam, Manipuri, "magizamaram" in Tamil, and "ranja" in Kannada. Its timber is valuable, the fruit is edible, and it is used in traditional medicine. As the trees give thick shade and flowers emit fragrance, it is a prized collection of gardens.
Its flower is the provincial flower of Yala Province, Thailand. 
Tree description.
Bullet wood is an evergreen tree reaching a height of about 16 m. It flowers in April, and fruiting occurs in June. Leaves are glossy, dark green, oval-shaped, 5–14 cm long, and 2.5–6 cm wide. Flowers are cream, hairy, and scented. Bark is thick and appears dark brownish black or grayish black in colour, with striations and a few cracks on the surface.
The tree may reach up to a height of 9–18 m with about 1 m in circumference.
Ayurvedic uses.
The bark, flowers, fruits, and seeds of "Bakula" are astringent, cooling, anthelmintic, tonic, and febrifuge. It is mainly used in dental ailments like bleeding gums, pyorrhea, dental caries, and loose teeth. 
Extracts of flowers are used against heart diseases, leucorrhoea, and menorrhagia, and act as antiduretic in polyuria and antitoxin. The snuff made from the dried and powdered flowers is used in a disease called "ahwa" in which strong fever, headache, and pain in the neck, shoulders, and other parts of the body occurs.
Ripened fruits facilitate a cure for burning urination. The ripe fruit pounded and mixed with water is given to promote delivery in childbirth. The powder of dried flowers is a brain tonic and useful as a snuff to relieve headache.
Decoction of bark is used to wash the wounds.

Albert Van Vlierberghe (Belsele, 18 March 1942 — Sint-Niklaas, 20 December 1991) was a Belgian professional road bicycle racer. Van Vlierberghe won three stages in the Tour de France, and three stages in the Giro d'Italia.
In his 1999 book, "Breaking the Chain: Drugs and Cycling, the True Story," Belgian sports physiotherapist Willy Voet described an incident involving Van Vlierberghe that occurred during the 1979 Deutschland Tour. Voet, then the "soigneur" with Van Vlierberghe's team, Flandria, claims that Van Vlierberghe, "a decent Belgian racer but with no taste for the hills," asked Voet to drive him ahead of his fellow racers to avoid a six-mile stretch of hill in the course. Voet claims that Van Vlierberghe slipped back into the race without being detected and went on to place sixth on the stage. Voet used the incident to defend his assertion that for many professional riders at the time, cheating was "a way of life."

Flex Your Rights

Flex Your Rights (Flex) is a 501(c)(3) educational non-profit organization that aims to "educate the public about how basic Bill of Rights protections apply during encounters with law enforcement". To accomplish this, Flex Your Rights creates and distributes media (including two full-length docudrama videos) that explains individuals' legal rights during a police encounter. Flex was founded in 2002 and is based in Washington, D.C.
History.
Flex was founded by Steven Silverman in 2002. Silverman, who serves as the organization's Executive Director, created Flex in response to what he perceived as widespread confusion over the basic rules of search and seizure. Silverman came to this conclusion while he worked as a campus organizer for the campaign to repeal the Higher Education Act’s aid-elimination penalty, which denies financial aid to students with drug convictions. As part of his work, Silverman prompted students to describe the details of the police stops and searches leading to their minor drug arrests.
Silverman noted a pattern during these interviews, and various legal and law enforcement experts confirmed his conclusion: The vast majority of people are mystified by the basic rules of search and seizure and due process of law. In order to ensure that constitutional rights and equal justice are upheld by law enforcement, Silverman believes we must build a constitutionally literate citizenry.
Videos.
"BUSTED: The Citizen's Guide to Surviving Police Encounters".
In 2003, Flex secured funding from the Marijuana Policy Project grants program to create its first docudrama, "BUSTED: The Citizen’s Guide to Surviving Police Encounters", hosted by Ira Glasser, past executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union. The film illustrates scenarios of police encountering citizens in various situations and how the relevant civil rights should be asserted in regards to the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendments of the Constitution of the United States.
Flex has overseen the independent distribution of more than 20,000 "Busted" DVD copies, the video has more than 2.5 million online views, and it is regularly screened in hundreds of college and high school classrooms.
An array of professional and civic groups—including police instructors, student and community activists, lawyers and concerned parents—have expressed their support of the video.
"10 Rules for Dealing with Police".
Flex has recently completed production of "10 Rules for Dealing with Police", a new docudrama that focuses on the concerns of communities of color.
"Not Guilty: A Juror’s Guide to Protecting Good People from Bad Laws".
The next film project is a film that illustrates the various US Constitutional rights and powers of juries, such as the option of jury nullification.
Controversies.
In May 2010, two Norview High School teachers of Norfolk, Virginia were placed on paid administrative leave after screening "Busted" to their 12th grade Government class. A parent complained to the Norview administration that her daughter had come home from school and said, "'You won't believe what we are learning in Government. They are teaching us how to hide our drugs." Norview's spokeswoman Elizabeth Thiel Mather said division leaders are currently investigating the incident over concerns that the materials were unauthorized.
Activism.
Flex collaborates with community activists to fight new policing schemes that violate citizens' Bill of Rights protections. Successes include victories against D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty's Safe Homes Initiative and an attempt by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority to implement random searches of Metro passengers.

European Union and the G8

The European Union (EU) is a member of the G8, dubbed its "9th member", holding all the privileges and obligations of membership but without the right to host or chair a summit. As the full name of the G8 is the "Group of Eight Nations", the EU has not been included in the number, hence there being nine members in the G8.
The President of the European Commission has attended since he was first invited to the third G7 summit in 1977, Roy Jenkins was the then-President. Since 1981 the President has attended all sessions of the G7. The EU is currently represented by the Commission President and the President of the European Council. The latter used to be the rotating chair of the council of EU state leaders, with irregular attendance since 1982. The Council Presidency sometimes coincided with one of the G8 members, in which case that leader attended with their national and European mandate. Since 2009, the President of the European Council is a permanent position, who always attends the summits. As the EU is a member, what the Presidents endorse at the G8 is politically binding on them.
The EU attends due to its role in the world economy, and its relevancy increased with the establishment of a single market, common currency and foreign policy. The Paris Summit of 1989 was a landmark year for the EU's participation in the G7, when the G7 asked the EU to assume responsibility for Phare.

Casablanca directive

The Casablanca directive was approved by the Combined Chiefs of Staff (CCOS) of the Western Allies at their 65th meeting on 21 January 1943 and issued to the appropriate the Royal Air Force and United States Army Air Forces commanders on 4 February 1943.
The CCOS met during the Casablanca Conference when the Allies were deciding the future strategy of the war.
The directive set out a series of priorities for the strategic bombing of Germany by the air forces based in the UK (RAF Bomber Command and US Eighth Air Force. With modification in June, making German fighters (part of their main defence against Allied bombers) an "intermediate target " and the primary goal, it gave direction to the combined (USAAF and RAF) bombing offensive known as Operation Pointblank.
Contents.
Memorandum C.C.S. 166/1/D by the Combined Chiefs of Staff, 21 January 1943:
C.C.S. 166/1/D was a revised and expanded version of the "C.C.S 166" document which had been presented for discussion to the Combined Chiefs of Staff on 20 January by the British Chiefs of Staff. The discussions brought up several issues, such as how to phrase the memorandum to balance the concerns of the different stake-holders about the priority to give to anti-U-Boat activities as opposed to support for the planned operations to take place in the Mediterranean theatre. Two changes were proposed and agreed that the addition "for political reasons" should be inserted into "... issued from time to time political reasons by His Majesty's Government ..." and that the word "synthetic" was removed "Synthetic oil plants". Further changes were made to the British draft of the memorandum in the ordering of some of the sentences.
A modified version of the Casablanca directive as sent to RAF Bomber Command on 4 February 1945:
Arthur "Bomber" Harris, the commander of RAF Bomber Command from 1942, included the directive in his papers (published in 1995 as "") with an attached note to the bottom.
The RAF Bomber command version contains most of the information that is in the C.C.S. memorandum but in a different order and in the note at the bottom it makes it clear that this directive replaced general directive No. 5, that is often referred to as the Area Bombing Directive. Missing from the Bomber command directive are mention of "point 4" in the C.C.S. version — objectives of great but fleeting importance such as the German Fleet — and point 7 which was redundant as RAF Bomber Command already obeyed orders originating from the Chiefs of Staff Committee (British Chiefs of Staff) whatever their military or political origins.
Despite the lack of an explicit mention of "point 4" in the Bomber Command version of the directive, Bomber Command was involved in attacking the German capital ships only a few days after this directive reached them, when along with the Royal Navy and its Fleet Air Arm they failed to prevent the successful "Channel Dash" made by the , , , supported by a number of smaller ships, from France to their home ports.
In his post war book "Bomber offensive" Harris mentions the Casablanca directive at the start of chapter seven "The offensive underway". In it he emphasises the "Object" paragraph of the directive issued to the RAF and mentions the "Primary" paragraph in passing. He explains that the subject of morale had been dropped (it had been emphasised in the previous general directive No. 5 (the Area Bombing Directive)) and that he was to proceed with the "general 'disorganisation' of German industry" but that some parts of that industry, such as U-Boat building, had a higher priority than others, from which he drew the conclusion that it "allowed to attack any German industrial city of 100,000 inhabitants and above" and that the Ruhr remained the principal target for the RAF.

Henry Holden

Henry Holden (1596 – March 1662) was an English Roman Catholic priest, known as a theologian.
Life.
Henry Holden was the second son of Richard Holden, of Chaigley, Lancashire, and Eleanor, his wife. He entered the English College at Douai under the name of Johnson, 18 September 1618. There he studied till 15 July 1623, when he proceeded to Paris, took his degree as Doctor of Divinity, and was made a professor at the Sorbonne. He also became penitentiary at Saint-Nicolas du Chardonnet and one of the grand vicars of the Archbishop of Paris. 
When Bishop Richard Smith fled from England in 1631, there arose a difference of opinion between the Jesuits and the other religious orders, who on the one hand thought the presence of a bishop in England was not advisable at the time, and the secular clergy, who took the opposite view. Holden was sent to Rome to represent the seculars and to avert the dissolution of the chapter. In 1655, on the death of Bishop Smith, the question again arose, and Holden's friend and brother-priest, Thomas White, alias Blackloe, wrote a book, "The Grounds of Obedience and Government", which gave offence to his opponents, and led to some of his other works being censured by the Holy See. Holden, who thought Blackloe had been hardly treated, undertook his defence, and thus the "Blackloist Controversy" was begun. 
Holden, however, did not approve of all Blackloe's opinions and persuaded him to submit and retract the teaching which had been condemned. Blackloe did this, though without satisfying his adversaries, who were also unsparing in their denunciations of Holden, whom they described as an unlearned and rash man. 
In the later years of his life he took a keen interest in the famous community known as the "Blue Nuns" at Paris. The sisters were originally Franciscans, but when Cardinal de Retz, Archbishop of Paris, refused to allow Franciscans to dwell in his diocese, they obtained leave from the Holy See to change their rule to that of the Immaculate Conception of our Lady, and Dr. Holden was appointed their superior in 1661. 
In the heat of controversy his opponents accused him of Jansenism as well as of Blackloism. His own statement survives, that he condemned the five key propositions of Jansen from the first, and that "in the same sense in which they were condemned by him" (the pope). He also signed the Sorbonne's censure of Antoine Arnauld's letter to Roger du Plessis, duc de Liancourt.

Thompson was the daughter of the Anglo-American physicist and inventor Benjamin Thompson and of Sarah Rolfe, a rich and well-connected heiress, who was thirteen years older than her husband. Both were born and brought up in the American colonies and married there in 1772. 
During the American Revolutionary War of 1775 to 1783, Benjamin Thompson took the side of the British, and at the end of the war he moved to London. He was knighted in 1784. In 1785, when Sarah Thompson was eleven years old, her father moved to Bavaria to become an "aide-de-camp" to the Prince-elector Charles Theodore. She, however, remained in New England with her mother. 
In 1792, Sir Benjamin Thompson was created a Count of the Holy Roman Empire. He took the name "Rumford" for Rumford, New Hampshire, which was an older name for the town of Concord, where he had been married, becoming "Count Rumford".
Adult life.
Around 1796, at her father's request, Sarah Thompson traveled to London to be with him, since four years earlier her mother had died. In 1797, the Elector of Bavaria accepted Thompson as a Countess of the Holy Roman Empire. In recognition of her father's military services to Bavaria, she was to be given one half of his pension of 2000 florins upon his death, with the right to live in any country she wished. When her father died in 1814 she became "Countess Rumford". Thompson spent her time between her homes in Brompton, London, and Concord, New Hampshire, with other trips in-between. She often would travel to Paris and lived there for two and three years.
Later life.
From 1845, Thompson lived primarily at her home in Concord, New Hampshire. She lived there in luxury with an adopted daughter until her death in 1852. 
Thompson established the Rolfe and Rumford Asylums in Concord, New Hampshire. She provided assistance to and bequeathed large sums of money to charitable societies in Concord and Boston for needy children, motherless girls, widows, and the mentally ill. The United Way in 1984 founded the Rumford Society in honor of the charitable donations given by Thompson.

Georg Christian Oeder

Georg Christian Edler von Oldenburg Oeder (February 3, 1728 in Ansbach - January 28, 1791 in Oldenburg (Oldenburg)) was a German-Danish botanist, medical doctor, economist and social reformer. His name is particularly associated with the initiation of the plate work "Flora Danica".
Life and work.
Oeder was the son of a Bavarian parish minister, Georg Ludwig Oeder (1694–1760). He studied medicine at the University of Göttingen under Albrecht von Haller. He then settled as a doctor of medicine in the city of Schleswig. The king called him to Copenhagen in 1751, on von Haller's recommendation. The autonomous – and conservative - University of Copenhagen, reluctant as it was to employ foreign experts, resisted Oeder's appointment in an ordinary chair. Thus, he was appointed "Professor botanices regius" (Royal Professor) and soon led the installation of a new botanic garden. From 1753 he led the publication of a monumental botanical plate work, "Flora Danica", which at first was planned to cover all plants, including bryophytes, lichens and fungi native to crown lands of the Danish king – Denmark, Schleswig-Holstein, Oldenburg-Delmenhorst and Norway – with its North Atlantic dependencies Iceland, the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Oeder visited the mountain regions of Norway up to Trondheim during the years 1758-1760. Consequently, the first fascicles of Flora Danica contain many alpine plant species. Oeder also corresponded with the Norwegian bishop and botanist Johan Ernst Gunnerus during the time. 
Oeder also built up a considerable botanical library, mainly through purchase from colleagues abroad. English and American literature was obtained from Philip Miller of Chelsea Physic Garden and as many as 1327 volumes were bought from the estate of Richard Mead in 1754.
At the time of Oeder, botany was amalgamated with economy at large. Oeder thus was also a member of a number of commissions on agrarian reforms (e.g. “Landkommissionen” in 1770) and state finances ('Finanskollegiet' in 1771). From the first Danish census, which was soon destroyed, he extracted data on married couples, widowers and widows in all parishes of Zealand, Amager, Møn and Bornholm – these excerpts are now valuable data to genealogists. Oeder advocated the need for charities for widows. At large, Oeder was a spokesman of social reform and freedom of the rural population.
With the fall of Johann Friedrich Struensee in 1771 and the consequent crisis in state finances and the strengthening of anti-enlightenment and anti-German conservative circles, Oeder lost his professorship. He was first given the post as prefect (stiftamtmand) of Trondhjem stift, but never installed. He then was given a little honorable post as bailiff (Landvogt) in Oldenburg, which was then under Danish rule, but to be exchanged to Holstein-Gottorp in 1773. Two years before his death, he was ennobled by emperor Joseph II. He was buried in the churchyard of St. Gertrude's Chapel ("Gertrudenfriedhof") in Oldenburg.
Plant taxa named for Oeder.
The plant genus "Oedera" L. was named to his honour. A number of species have been named similarly, e.g. "Pedicularis oederi" Vahl and "Carex oederi" Retz.

San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department

The San Bernardino County Sheriff-Coroner's Department (SBSD) serves San Bernardino County, California, which is geographically the largest county in the lower 48 states. SBSD provides law enforcement services to the unincorporated areas of the county and contract law enforcement services to 14 of the county's cities, serving a total of 1,029,466 of the county's 2 million residents. The department also operates the county jail system, provides marshal services for the county superior courts, and has numerous other specialized divisions to serve the citizens of San Bernardino County.
The Sheriff-Coroner is an elected office. However, in 2012 when then-Sheriff Rod Hoops announced his retirement, the Board of Supervisors appointed Assistant Sheriff John McMahon to the position. The Board made the appointment after determining that a special election for sheriff would be cost prohibitive ($3.5 million). McMahon announced that he intends to run for sheriff in 2014.
History.
Early Sheriffs of San Bernardino County.
When San Bernardino County was established in 1853, its first Sheriff was a Mormon, Robert Clift, who served until 1857. On January 12, 1856, a volunteer militia unit known as the San Bernardino Rangers was organized under the command of Captain Andrew Lytle to aid the Sheriff in suppressing raids by Indians and the gangs of outlaws like the Flores Daniel Gang that plagued the County. Sheriff Clift left for Utah that year and was followed in office by Joseph Bridger who held the office until 1859.
Valentine Herring was next as Sheriff until the fall of 1860. Herring was replaced by Charles W. Piercey who held the office until he resigned in October 1860 to run for the State Assembly. Anson Van Leuvan served as Sheriff from 1860 to 1862. He had difficulties enforcing the law in Belleville and the other boom towns of the Holcomb Valley gold rush and with the turbulence caused in the County by the secession crisis and the beginning of the American Civil War. Eli M. Smith elected in the fall of 1861, was known for his pursuit of a gang of horse thieves who had been operating in the county for several months stealing horses made precious by the wartime need for horseflesh. On one occasion Sheriff Smith rode into an outlaw camp, recovering a herd of stolen horses and arresting three thieves. By the end of his term in office he had convicted 18 men of horse theft and sent them to prison.
Sheriff Benjamin F. Mathews elected Sept. 14, 1863, served from October, 1863 to October, 1865. In September 1865 the outlaw James Henry of the Mason Henry Gang and his gang of rustlers, robbers and murderers were in the county, camped out near San Bernardino. Sheriff Mathews and his posse led by John Rogers (a gang member sent to town to obtain provisions and captured after drunken boasting), found and surprised Henry camped in Railroad Canyon, (then called San Jacinto Canyon), about twenty-five miles south of town. At sunrise on September 14, 1865, the posse approached cautiously but Henry awoke and fired three shots, striking one posse member in the foot. Henry died in a hail of gunfire, sustaining 57 wounds. His corpse was taken back to town, photographed and his body was displayed to the public in Old West fashion.
Some of the other men holding the office of Sheriff in the early years were George T. Fulgham was Sheriff from (1865 to 1869), Newton Noble (1869–1873), J. C Curry (1873–1877), William Davies (1877–1879), John King (1879–1882), J. B. Burkhart (1882–1884), Nelson G. Gill (1884–1885), Edwin Chidsey Seymour (1888–1892), James P. Booth (1892-1894), Charles A. Rouse (1894–1895), John C. Ralphs (1902–1915), J. L. McMinn (1915–1918).
Members killed on duty.
Eleven SBSD deputies have been killed in the line of duty. SBSD established the Frank Bland Memorial at its headquarters to honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice while serving the citizens of San Bernardino County.
Organization.
The current San Bernardino County Sheriff-Coroner is John McMahon (formerly an Assistant Sheriff). When appointed in December 2012 McMahon replaced Rod Hoops, who replaced Gary Penrod who retired on January 31, 2009.
Serving below the Sheriff is the Undersheriff. As in most counties, the undersheriff is second-in-command of the entire Sheriff's Department.
Beneath the Undersheriff are two Assistant Sheriffs. One Assistant Sheriff is in charge of Operations and the other is in charge of Support (administration and logistics).
SBSD is organized into seven bureaus. Each bureau is commanded by a Deputy Chief.
The bureaus are:
Administrative Services Bureau.
This bureau operates the following divisions:
Detentions and Corrections Bureau.
SBSD operates a total of 9 jail facilities throughout the county. The average daily inmate population is 5,600. In 2006, 107,606 people were booked into these jails. The bureau operates the following Type-II jails that are used for long term housing:
Patrol Operations Region I.
This bureau provides law enforcement services to the densely populated southwest corner of the county, which includes parts of the San Bernardino Valley, Pomona Valley, Cucamonga Valley, and the communities in the San Bernardino Mountains. This area also operates a Type I Jail booking facility.
Patrol Operations Region II.
This bureau provides law enforcement services to the large Mojave Desert portion of the county. The deputies at many of these stations operate in remote areas. This area also operates 3 of SBSD's Type I Jail booking facilities.
Specialized Operations Bureau.
Aviation.
Aviation provides services including general law enforcement support, surveillance, fire suppression, medical transport, and search and rescue duties. It operates the following aircraft:

Meanwhile, Rai got offers to handle the camera for two more Kannada feature films, "Mithayi Mane" and a black comedy film called "Mata".
Rai directed his first movie, "Seven O' Clock", for Suresh using a cast that included Mithun Thejaswi and Pooja Kanwal. He left the cinematography to Chandrashekar. The movie was not successful at the box office.
Rai and Chandrashekar took similar roles for the former's second movie "Savi Savi Nenapu", which again failed at the box office but was dubbed into Telugu.

<doc id="18431562" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18431562" title="Kirtland AFB UFO sighting">
Kirtland AFB UFO sighting

The Kirtland AFB UFO sighting could suggest either of two incidents, separated by a number of years, but initially refers to an observation (and possible RADAR contact) of an unidentified flying object at Kirtland Air Force Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico, late in 1957. The Air Force initially concluded the witnesses misidentified a conventional aircraft, but the case has since gained notoriety through being mentioned in a number of well-known studies, and has been cited by organisations such as NICAP as an incident defying conventional explanations. A possibly more significant series of incidents began in the 1979-1980 time frame with films taken by Paul Bennewitz. His sightings and film evidence, eventually brought the involvement of Air Force AFOSI personnel and others, and reportedly led to a disinformation campaign that spawned allegations of MJ-12 and Project Aquarius.
The sighting.
The incident took place on November 4, 1957, at around 22:45 MST. Two Civil Aeronautics Administration controllers in the tower at Kirtland AFB, R. M. Kaser and E. G. Brink, noticed a white light travelling eastwards across the airfield. The light appeared to manoeuvre and a brief RADAR contact was confirmed before the men saw a dark object descend steeply at the end of Runway 26. The object proceeded to cross the airfield at a moderate speed and a height of a few tens of feet; through binoculars, it appeared to be around 15-20 feet tall, vertically elongated and egg-shaped, with a single white light in its base. It came to within 3000 feet of the tower before hovering for a period of up to a minute; it then moved eastwards to the base boundary before suddenly climbing at high speed into the overcast.
At this point, Kaser and Brink called the Albuquerque Radar Approach Control unit, who were able to confirm a target moving eastwards in the expected area. It turned south, moving (according to Kaser) at a very high speed, before orbiting in the vicinity of the Albuquerque Low Frequency Range Station for a number of minutes. The target then moved back north towards Kirtland, hovering over the outer marker south of the main north-south runway. It finally took up position half a mile behind a C-46 leaving the base and followed it for around 14 miles before again hovering over the outer marker and fading. The total period of RADAR contact lasted around 20 minutes. 
The sighting was investigated almost immediately by the Air Force for Project Blue Book. The witnesses were traced and again interviewed in the late 1960s by Dr James E. McDonald, a prominent atmospheric physicist and UFO researcher, adding further detail (the bulk of the above account is based on McDonald's description).
Investigation for Blue Book; possible solution.
The witnesses were interviewed a few days later by a Capt. Shere from Ent AFB. Shere was of the opinion that while the two tower operators - who were characterised as completely reliable, competent, and somewhat embarrassed at their report - had genuinely seen something, the object did not display any performance capabilities beyond those to be expected of an ordinary private aircraft, and as there was no other obvious explanation, concluded that they had most likely seen such an aircraft. The RADAR returns were, it was noted, identical to those of a small plane, strengthening this view. Shere surmised that the aircraft's pilot had mistakenly tried to land at Kirtland before realising his error and hurriedly leaving, after executing a turn which may have been partly obscured by buildings. The case was filed with the conclusion "Possible Aircraft".
This explanation was also used in the final report of the Condon Committee on UFOs, which agreed with the Air Force that "a small, powerful private aircraft, flying without flight plan, [...] became confused and attempted a landing at the wrong airport".
Subsequent investigation by McDonald.
Dr James McDonald, when reviewing the case, stated that he did not find it credible that a pilot could execute such a dangerous manoeuvre as described at night, in the rain, and at low height, or that the control tower's view was obscured at key points. His dissatisfaction with the Condon Report and Blue Book conclusions led him to take the step of tracing and contacting Kaser and Brink, although he was unable to locate any of the RADAR personnel involved or records of the RADAR tracks. In his paper "Science in Default", McDonald claimed that the two tower operators independently confirmed to him that the object seen by them did not in any way resemble an aircraft (even when viewed through 7x binoculars), lacking wings, fuselage or tail, and that rather than being obscured by buildings at any point was in their full view for the duration of the sighting, including the period when it apparently hovered; it did not execute a turn, as Shere had concluded. They also stated that the performance and departure speed of the object was far in excess of that of even contemporary jet aircraft.
McDonald's conclusion was that the Blue Book and Condon Report explanation was, in this case, completely unsatisfactory. He was particularly concerned that the Condon Committee did not seem to have made any attempt to re-interview the witnesses but had simply relied on the original Blue Book file. His analysis did not suggest any alternative solution, but was used to support his thesis that certain incidents defied explanation and merited further scientific study.
Further sightings.
The Kirtland sighting took place in the context of a UFO "flap" or panic across the southern states in early November 1957. This included the Levelland UFO Case, which took place two days earlier and a similar case in Orogrande, New Mexico, on November 4. Other sightings allegedly occurred in 1980 and were described in documents released under the Freedom Of Information Act. These documents (commonly referred to as "The Kirtland Documents") are the source of some controversy, and the alleged sightings attributed to Air Force and Sandia personnel have never been fully substantiated.

Ximenia americana, commonly known as yellow plum or sea lemon, is a small sprawling tree of woodlands native to the tropics.
Leaves are oval shaped, bright green and have a strong smell of almonds. Flowers are pale in color. Fruits are lemon-yellow or orange-red.
Uses.
As food.
The fruits have a pleasant plum-like flavor. In Asia, the young leaves are cooked as a vegetable. However, the leaves also contain cyanide and need to be thoroughly cooked, and should not be eaten in large amounts.
In medicine.
It is being investigated by researchers from Nigeria's Ahamadu Bello University. In animal tests, it is showing promise against the parasite that causes sleeping sickness and severe anaemia in livestock in many parts of Africa. Leaf extract is active against "Escherischia coli", "Pseudomonas aeruginosa" and "Candida albicans". Tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids, saponins, anthraquinones, starch, general glycosides and bitter principles can be found in the extract. Indigenous people of Florida used the bark to treat sore muscles and gums.
The root also contains the fatty acids tariric acid and 10Z,14E,16E-octadeca-10,14,16-triene-12-ynoic acid.

Epargyreus clarus

The Silver-spotted Skipper (Epargyreus clarus) is a butterfly of the family Hesperiidae. It is claimed to be the most recognized skipper in North America.
Description.
The wingspan of an adult is 43–67 mm. The adult has translucent gold spots on the forewings and silvery bands on the hindwings.
The caterpillar's head is large and brown with two orange dots mimicking eyes. It has a long, narrow, green body.
Life cycle.
The adult Silver-spotted skipper occurs in fields, gardens and at forest edges. It ranges from southern Canada throughout most of the United States to northern Mexico; it is absent in the Great Basin and western Texas.
Adults fly throughout the warm part of the year. They have one brood per year in the North and West, two in the East, and three or four in the Deep South.
Females lay single eggs near, not on, the caterpillars' food plants. The caterpillars must find their own way to the plants. Young caterpillars fold leaves to make shelters, and older ones stick leaves together with silk. They overwinter as chrysalids.
Larval foods.
The larvae feed on legumes, many trees and shrubs but also some herbaceous plants. Their hosts include:
Nectar flowers.
Adults almost never feed on yellow flowers. Among their favorites are:

David Tsugio Tsutada

David Tsugio Tsutada (1906 – 25 July 1971), known as "The John Wesley of Japan," was the founder of the Immanuel General Mission (Immaneru Sogo Dendo Dan), an indigenous Japanese holiness denomination founded on 21 October 1945 in Tokyo, Japan.
Biographical Details.
David Tsugio Tsutada was the second son of Kenri "Henry" Tsutada, a Japanese Methodist dentist of Singapore. After studying at Anglo-Chinese School (ACS) in Singapore, Tsutada completed high school in Japan. After graduation he studied law at the University of Cambridge. He subsequently graduated from the University of London. Despite his academic success, Tsutada believed he was called to become a preacher, and so terminated his legal studies and returned to Japan to attend Bible College. Prior to graduation, his college president chose a Christian woman, Nobuko, for him to marry. Tsutada was effective in reaching the poor and marginalised of Tokyo, resulting in several conversions to Christianity. David and Nobuko had five children: John Makoto, Mary Migiwa, Joshua Tadashi, and twins Grace Midorino and Margaret Makiba.
At the outbreak of World War II, Tsutada refused to erect a Japanese flag in front of his church and bow deeply to the Emperor in the direction of the imperial palace, saying "only God in heaven is divine. We worship Him alone". On 26 June 1942, Tsutada was arrested, along with about 130 others who likewise refused to comply with the regulation. After two years in solitary confinement in Sugamo Prison, Tsutada was convicted, but released on probation. After the war ended, Tsutada decided to build a church in Tokyo, naming it "Immanuel" because "You, O God, are with us, just as you were in the cell with me." The Immanuel General Mission was organised on 21 October 1945 in Tokyo.
In 1949 Tsutada founded the Immanuel Bible Training College in Urawa, a city 30 kilometres north of central Tokyo, and became its first president.
Tsutada died on 25 July 1971.
Legacy.
John, his eldest son, took over as President of the Bible Training College (BTC), Pastor of the Tokyo Central Church and the head of the Tsutada family. John's eight children went into full-time Christian work as staff members of the Tokyo Central Church, missionaries overseas, and one of them in medical work.
John's brothers and sisters actively supported the Mission and together, continued to serve the Lord in Japan and elsewhere. Mary, a fine scholar, enrolled at the BTC, married her brother's friend Benjamin Saoshiro, but died prematurely, but not before her son, Ken, became a Christian. Benjamin became pastor, teacher, translator of songs and books from English to Japanese and took charge of the missionaries from Immanuel Church.
Joshua, the third sibling, after graduation from Rikkyo University, studied at BTC, then at Yeotmal Union Biblical Seminary in India where, after graduation, he stayed on as registrar and preached during the weekends for a total of 14 years. Returning to Japan he pastored a church in Kyūshū, and after his brother John became Chairman of Education, Joshua succeeded him as President of the Bible Training College. He serves also as Chairman of the Evangelical Fellowship of Asia.
Grace and Margaret both studied at BTC and alternated pastoring and looking after their mother. Margaret went on to do pastoral work not far from Tokyo, and later was sent to begin a church at Beppu. Eventually, her work led her to marrying Benjamin Saoshiro in 1988.

Chianan Plain

The Chianan Plain or Jianan Plain () is an alluvial plain located at the central-southern region of western Taiwan. It is the largest plain of the island, and lies in Tainan City and Chiayi County/Chiayi City, from which the name of the plain derived. It also includes some portions of Yunlin County, Changhua County, and Kaohsiung City. There are several rivers flowing through it, such as the Tsengwen River. 
Historically, the plain was mostly inhabited by Taiwanese Aborigines, a small fraction of the population today. Since the era of the Qing Dynasty, the Chianan Plain became a main destination of Han immigrants. This area also supplies many food crops to the whole island of Taiwan since the Japanese-ruled era.
Geography.
The Chianan Plain faces the Taiwan Strait on the west, Taichung Basin on the north, Pingtung Plain on the southeast, and lies to the west of foothills that extend from the Alishan Mountains. The area determined by dividing the groundwater zones of Taiwan is about . Between broadest points, the plain is about wide and long. 
Average rainfall in this area is about 1600 mm, lowest in the whole island of Taiwan, and the rainy season is in summer, thus the plain lacks rain in winter. Rivers which pass through this region are the Peikang River, Putzu River, Pachang River, Chishui River, Tsengwen River, Yenshui River and Erhjen River. These rivers flow over the plain roughly from the eastern mountainous area to the western seacoast, and discharge into the Taiwan Strait.
History.
About 6000 years ago, the lands near the seacoast of the Chianan Plain were flooded by seawater, and emerged gradually since 5000 years ago. Several archaeological sites are located here, including some late neolithic cultures such as the Tahu Culture, which existed between 3500 to 2000 years ago. The Iron Age Niaosung Culture appeared from 2000 to 500 years ago.
The Hoanya people are known in written history to have lived in the northern part of Chianan Plain, and the Siraya people lived in the south. Han Chinese began to immigrate to the Chianan Plain since the European-ruled era of Taiwan. After the Koxinga defeated the Dutch to claim Taiwan in 1662, Han people ruled this region, and became the majority later. Most of them came from Zhangzhou and Quanzhou of Fujian, and Chaozhou of Guangdong, in the era of the Qing Dynasty.
Japanese started to rule Taiwan in 1895. In this era, the colonial government launched infrastructure and businesses on the Chianan Plain, such as the Western Line railway, the irrigation system of the Chianan Canal, and sugar production companies which were later combined into the Taiwan Sugar Corporation. After the Japanese Empire collapsed, the Republic of China held Taiwan. National Highway No. 1 and National Highway No. 3, which pass through this region, were built in the late 20th century.
Economy.
The Chianan Plain is a place of cultivation of wet rices and other minor food grains. It is the main planting area of sugarcane in Taiwan, but sugar production is being gradually reduced. The area can reap three rice harvests annually since the Chianan Canal was established, and also produces peanuts, corn, sweet potatoes and some floricultural plants and vegetables. The plain was once a place of salt production, but most of the salt evaporation ponds have been abandoned in recent years. Additionally, many fish farms are located along the seacoast.
There are several industrial parks located in Chianan Plain, such as Changbin Industrial Park and Linhai Industrial Park. Heavy industries situated in this area include oil refining, steel making and shipbuilding. It also has two relatively newer high-tech industrial parks named Tainan Science Park and Kaohsiung Science Park.

Sea Songs

Sea Songs is an arrangement of three British sea-songs by the English composer Ralph Vaughan Williams. It is based on the songs "Princess Royal", "Admiral Benbow" and "Portsmouth". The work is a march of roughly four minutes duration. It follows a ternary structure, with opening material based on "Princess Royal" and "Admiral Benbow", with "Portsmouth" forming the central section before a return to the opening material featuring the first two songs. 
The march was originally arranged for military band in 1923 as the second movement of "English Folk Song Suite", and the world premiere of the suite was given at Kneller Hall on July 4, 1923. As a single work, its first performance was given at Wembley during the British Empire Exhibition in April 1924. This work, as well as the "English Folk Song Suite", stemmed from Vaughan Williams' admiration for the band of the Royal Military School of Music at Kneller Hall. The work was subsequently re-arranged for full orchestra in 1942 by the composer.
Performances and recordings.
The piece became well known in the United Kingdom as the theme tune to the BBC television adaptation of "Billy Bunter" in the 1950s, which used the central, "Portsmouth", section as its title music. It was also used as the start-up music to Anglia Television until the early 1980s. Both used the 1955 orchestral recording of the work performed by the New Concert Orchestra, conducted by Nat Nyll, which was part of the Boosey & Hawkes music library. This version is available on CD. Other more recent stereo recordings include performances conducted by Richard Hickox with the Northern Sinfonia, Leonard Slatkin with the Philharmonia Orchestra, George Hurst with the Bournemouth Sinfonietta and Paul Murphy with the Royal Ballet Sinfonia. The original military band score is available in a recording by the Royal Northern College of Music Wind Orchestra conducted by Timothy Reynish. 
To commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the death of Vaughan Williams, the piece was performed at the 2008 Last Night of the Proms, in place of the traditional "Fantasia on British Sea Songs" by Sir Henry Joseph Wood, founding conductor of the Proms, and friend of Vaughan Williams.

During his career in the law, Northey filled several senior posts and eventually became Attorney General for England and Wales, serving in this capacity on two separate occasions. He also sat in parliament, retaining a position of influence following the accession of King George I by remaining neutral on significant political issues.
Life.
Edward Northey was born in 1652, the son of barrister William Northey and Elizabeth Garrett and baptised at St Mary-le-Bow in London. In preparation for a career in the law, Northey was educated at St Paul's School and Queen's College, Oxford, graduating in 1668. Entering the Middle Temple the same year, Northey was called to the bar in 1674 and remained in private practice for the next 15 years, arguing several significant cases in the House of Lords relating to King James II exercise of power.
In 1687, shortly after the death of his father, Northey inherited a substantial amount of money from Lady Wentworth and married Anne Joliffe, with whom he had one son and two daughters. In 1689, Northey became attorney-general to the Duchy of Lancaster and was touted as the next solicitor-general in 1693, although not appointed. He was later involved in the case surrounding John Toland's work "Christianity not Mysterious", arguing successfully that it could not be declared heretical.
In 1701, at the promotion of Thomas Trevor to be a judge, Northey was made Attorney General for England and Wales by King William III and was confirmed the following year on the ascendancy of Queen Anne, when he was also knighted. Northey retained the position for the next six years, prosecuting in many trials, including those of David Lindsay and John Tutchin, but refused to become involved in the Henry Sacheverell trial. In 1708, he was replaced by Simon Harcourt, but regained the post in 1710 and held it until 1718.
In addition to regaining the attorney-generalship, Northey was also elected to parliament in 1710 as Member of Parliament for Tiverton. During his time in parliament Northey, politically a mild Tory remained largely neutral, allowing him to keep his appointments on the accession of King George I in 1714. He was vocal in his disapproval of the Duke of Marlborough in 1712, but otherwise remained non-partisan.
In 1718, he was replaced as attorney-general by Nicholas Lechmere and accepted a pension of £1,500 annually. In 1722, suffering severely from an unidentified paralysing illness, Northey resigned his parliamentary seat and retired to his home in Epsom. He died there in 1723 and was buried nearby, survived by his wife and children.

Kadamtala

Kadamtala is a residential as well as semi-industrial area in the central part of Howrah City in Howrah District in the Presidency Division of south of West Bengal.
History.
This area was a part of bhurshut kingdom. This area was mainly developed under British occupation when ceded by Nawab of Murshidabad after the Battle of Plassey. With the establishment of the Howrah Railway Terminus in 1854 started the most important phase of its industrial development. Flour mills were established in 1855, followed by Jute mills and around 1870s, there were five mills near Howrah station. The Howrah–Shalimar Railway Section and the Shalimar Terminus were constructed in 1883.
Kadamtala was also a major railway junction of Martin's Light Railways. 
Kadamtala has turned to an industrial area during world war II. A high demand of iron leads to establish a number of small and medium sized iron-casting industries. Gradually the city of Howrah was called as Sheffield of Bengal when Mr. Alamohan Das established a large factory township named Dasnagar. A large number of Machines/tools/precision instruments manufacturiing factories were established.
All the above reasons result to a flow of population from rural belts of Howrah, Hooghly and Midnapur districts to this area to meet the demand of a high demand of labor. Gradually, this area has become a densely populated area with the location advantage of industries of Dasnagar in west, Howrah Railway terminus in east.
The rapid growth of population and negligence of planned infrastructure of the British Government and then flux of people from Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) leads to a breakdown of infrastructure of unplanned and narrow roads. The economic decline of West Bengal after partition of India also causes a big blow to Howrah's famous jute and machine-tools industries.
Recent developments.
Currently Kadamtala is mainly residential area, but still there exist significant number of private smalled scaled industrial infrastructures. The population is mainly divided into few economic classes. There is a working class who temporarily stay in this town and work in the small scaled iron-casting, machine tools and precision instruments industries. A number of people also work in different Government and Private service sectors. Also few are engaged with small-scaled businesses.
After the famous Vidyasagar Setu established, this town has become well connected with Kolkata by both Vidyasagar Setu and Howrah Bridge. 
Kadamtala is also connected to Kona Expressway, which was built by Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority (KMDA). This road serves as a connector of Kolkata (via Vidyasagar Setu) to National Highway 2 (India) (NH 2) and hence is part of Golden Quadrilateral project. At Nibra town of the Howrah district, Kona Expressway joins with National Highway 6 (India) (NH 6) as well.
A recent on-going development of Kolkata Metro from Saltlake to Howrah Maidan will also increase the significance of this town. This railway connection Line 2 (East-West Metro) is under construction by Kolkata Metro Rail Corporation.
Education and sports.
Sri Ramkrishna Sikshalaya, Tara Sundari Valika Vidyabhaban, Howrah Vivekananda Institution, Howrah Zilla School, Bantra MSPC High School are well known schools in the locality for large numbers of good students.
Kadamtala also has a number of colleges to study regular under-graduation ( such as Narasingha Dutta College, Howrah Bijay krishna girls college) and Medical education (such as Mahesh Bhattacharyya Homeopathic Medical college and Government Hospital). 
It adds to sports excellence of Howrah known for the football talents like Sailen Manna. The newly built indoor stadium in Dumurjala is encircled with a clubs devoted to various sports and athletic activities like swimming, hockey and cricket, not to mention football.
Problems.
Even after all the improvement in the recent two decades the place is not free of the usual problems with Howrah. The amount of road space to the population in Howrah is too small compared to even smaller towns by populations like Berhampur. The same problem applies to Kadamtala too.

Perkins Eastman

Perkins Eastman is an international architecture, interior design, urban design, planning, landscape architecture, graphic design, and project management firm. Headquartered in New York, New York, the firm is led by founding Principals Bradford Perkins and Mary-Jean Eastman, along with the firm's other Principal and Executive Directors: J. David Hoglund, Aaron B. Schwarz, Jonathan N. Stark, Daniel J. Cinelli, Carl Ordemann, and Alan Schlossberg.
History.
Bradford Perkins and Mary-Jean Eastman met at Llewelyn-Davies International, where Perkins served as the Managing Partner of the New York, Toronto, and Caracas offices. Both of them moved to Perkins + Will (a firm founded by Bradford's father), where Bradford Perkins became the Managing Partner of the Eastern offices, and Eastman ran one of the major design studios. 
In 1981, they left Perkins & Will to found Attia & Perkins, which was reorganized as Perkins Eastman in 1984. As the firm grew throughout the years, it expanded its range of expertise. Practice areas of the firm include: housing, higher education, hospitality, primary and secondary education, public, office and mixed-use, corporate interiors, research, religious and cultural facilities, and urban design. The firm's principals and staff regularly participate in professional conferences, research studies, and other activities to advance the conventional boundaries of design in each of its specialized areas. A number of principals and staff members have written basic textbooks on elementary and secondary school design, senior living, justice facilities, retail/mixed-use facilities, and healthcare facilities, as well as published more than 200 articles in total in professional journals and research papers on related topics.
Growth and expansion.
In addition to the completion of notable, award-winning projects, the firm has expanded into other practice areas by acquiring smaller firms. In 1999 it merged with Susan Black Architects to create Perkins Eastman Black, the Toronto-based office of the firm. Perkins Eastman's Charlotte, North Carolina, office combined with Healthcare Interiors, Inc. (HCI) in September 2004. In August 2005, Akol Architects of Oakland, California, merged its practice with Perkins Eastman. That same year, Perkins Eastman also acquired the creative staff at Larsen Shein Ginsberg Snyder LLP (LSGS) of New York City, a culminating event in a close working relationship built over the previous ten years on more than two dozen projects. 
In recent years, Perkins Eastman has also formed affiliations with four firms that provide related services to clients and operate as part of the firm under an affiliate business relationship. BFJ Planning (BFJ) offers professional expertise in planning, zoning, design, environmental analysis, real-estate analysis, and transportation planning. RGR Landscape (RGR) focuses on land planning and design for cultural institutions, public open space in urban settings, parks, recreational facilities, residential, and commercial projects. Urbanomics provides public- and private-sector clients with an array of economic development planning studies, market studies, tax policy analyses, program evaluations, and economic and demographic forecasts. Russell Design, an internationally recognized multi-disciplinary graphics firm, specializes in corporate communications, branding, and identification planning, as well as design for electronic media and environmental graphic design.
Today, Perkins Eastman is the largest New York-based design firms per "Crain’s New York Business," one of the largest architectural firms in the United States, among the 25 largest architecture firms in the world according to "BD World Architecture 100," and the 16th-largest interior design firm. The firm maintains offices in: New York, (1981); Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (1995); Stamford, Connecticut (1998); Charlotte, North Carolina (2001); Chicago, Illinois (2002); San Francisco, California (2005); Washington, DC (2005); and Boston, Massachusetts (2008).

In 2011, Perkins Eastman and Ehrenkrantz Eckstut & Kuhn Architects (EE&K) merged their practices.
Practice.
Senior Living.
Perkins Eastman started with a focus on senior living and healthcare design. Perkins Eastman's senior living practice began with the design of six buildings for The Jewish Homes of Miami campus. This project led to a referral for MorseLife in West Palm Beach, where Perkins Eastman refined what is now the widely used bi-axial room. These projects were widely published and visited by other sponsors, and contributed to the firm's growing reputation as innovative designers and strategic problem solvers with a distinctive understanding of a senior living provider’s programs, operations, financial resources, and technical needs. 
Perkins Eastman has developed expertise in the design of continuing care retirement communities; active adult developments; independent and assisted-living apartments, villas and cottages; long-term care and memory support environments; geriatric healthcare and short-term rehabilitation facilities; and Small House and Green House® communities. Innovative prototype designs include Woodside Place (1991), a community for persons with Alzheimer’s disease, in Oakmont, Pennsylvania; House for Betty (2010), an experimental housing community designed for active adults who may be predisposed to Alzheimer’s disease; and The Green House Project (2012), intentionally small communities for groups of elders and staff.
The firm's recent portfolio includes: Moorings Park, Naples, Florida, USA; Camphill Village, Ghent, New York, USA; C.C. Young – The Overlook, Dallas, Texas, USA; Atria Hacienda, Palm Desert, California, USA; Bivins Foundation: Childers Place, Amarillo, Texas, USA; VA Illiana Health Care System Community Living Centers, Danville, Illinois, USA; Otterbein Skilled Nursing and Rehab Neighborhoods, Ohio, USA; Sun City Yokohama, Japan; Sun City Kashiwa, Japan; Sun City Takatsuki, Japan; and Landgent Shuangjing Exhibition Center for Senior Living, Beijing, China.

Islamic Supreme Council of Canada

Islamic Supreme Council of Canada (ISCC) (Le Conseil Suprême Islamique de Canada) is a Canadian Muslim organization based in Calgary, Alberta. It was founded in 2000 by Imam Syed Soharwardy with the aims of fostering Canadian understanding of Islam, contributing to society in general, guiding Canadian institutions on the needs of Muslims, furthering Canadian relationships with Muslim-majority countries and organizing Canadian Muslims as a voting bloc. The ISCC has four major objectives: to propagate the teaching and observance of Islam, to support a Muslim house of worship, to proselytize Islam and to establish and operate an Islamic school.
Fatwa condemning terrorism.
In response to the bombing attempt on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 a group of Canadian and U.S. Islamic leaders associated with the Islamic Supreme Council of Canada issued a fatwa [http://www.islamicsupremecouncil.com/iscc-fatwa-against%20terrorism.htm], or religious edict, condemning any attacks by extremists or terrorists on the United States or Canada and declaring that an attack by extremists on the two countries would constitute an attack on Muslims living in North America. "In our view, these attacks are evil, and Islam requires Muslims to stand up against this evil," said the fatwa signed by the 20 imams. It concludes that Muslims "must expose any person, Muslim or non-Muslim, who would cause harm to fellow Canadians or Americans". One of the imams was reported saying: "it is religious obligation upon Muslims, based upon the Qur'anic teachings, that we have to be loyal to the country where we live". The fatwa also indicated that religious leaders have a duty to show others around the world that Muslims in Canada and the U.S. "have complete freedom to practise Islam" and that "any attack on Canada and the United States is an attack on the freedom of Canadian and American Muslims."

Before Interstate 25 was built, shoppers pulled off the road and filled up with gas or bought Indian rugs, jewelry, pottery and much more. The bar was attached and only a small part of it.
After the freeway came, the New Mexico Outlet Center mall was built in 1993 and closed in 1997. The mall was redeveloped in 2000 as ¡Traditions!, featuring New Mexico products and a cultural center, but it stands empty today.
At the south end of the West Frontage Road in Budaghers stands the Mormon Battalion Monument. It is a rock pillar with a wagon wheel at the top and with an information plaque on the east side. Also in Budaghers is a brightly painted cylindrical metal tank which changes subject from time to time. As of June 2013 it has a quirky skeletal car scene on the south, a misplaced saguaro on the east, and jazz instruments on the north. The west is plain green paint and rust.

Syncsort

Syncsort Incorporated is a global software company specializing in Big Data, high speed sorting products, and data integration software and services, for Hadoop, Microsoft Windows, UNIX, Linux, and mainframe systems. According to the company, Syncsort products are used by thousands of companies worldwide, with over 12,000 deployments in 70 countries.
History.
In 1968, seven recent graduates of New York University and Columbia University forged a partnership to develop software for mainframe computers. The result was a business with a niche product portfolio originally based on high speed data sorting, but which later moved into Big Data, Hadoop, Cloud, and ETL.
According to co-founder Duane Whitlow, the company's original task was to develop an airlines reservations system for Control Data. In the course of that work, Whitlow encountered timing charts for IBM's existing sort utility, and thought he could build a sort that was much faster. When sales opportunities arose, the nascent firm demonstrated a smaller footprint and better performance than IBM's equivalent offering.
In the early years, co-founder Aso Tavitian managed sales and marketing operations, which soon took off, especially after then-startup "Computerworld" published a front page story about the product. That story, Whitlow said, resulted in openings in Europe, and the company was one of the first to sell an independent software product in Europe. In those early days, according to Whitlow, Syncsort's product was often the first non-IBM product for many customers.
In the 1990's, Syncsort expanded into client/server environments with a Unix-based sort utility and a backup product. In 2004, Syncsort introduced DMExpress, which added core ETL (extract, transform, load) integration capabilities, metadata management and improved job management. In 2008, DMExpress was awarded the ETL world speed record by transferring 5.4TB of raw data into a Vertica Analytic Database on an HP c-class BladeSystem in 57 minutes.
By 2013, Syncsort had positioned itself as a “Big Iron to Big Data” company whose products reportedly require less manual tuning and still exhibit high performance. Reflecting the importance of its Big Data strategy, in 2013 Syncsort recruited technology industry veteran Lonne Jaffe as CEO. Jaffe had previously served as Senior Vice President of corporate strategy at CA Technologies, and VP of strategy in the IBM software group.
Also in 2013, Syncsort acquired Circle Computer Group, whose product DL/2 facilitates migration of mainframe data, especially from IBM IMS instances to IBM's DB2 under z/OS.
Syncsort Incorporated is one of the oldest continuously operating software firms of its size. Now in its fifth decade, the company has diversified beyond its original namesake product and operates subsidiaries in France, Germany and the UK.
Reorganizations.
In April 2008, Insight Venture Partners, Bessemer Venture Partners, Georgian Partners, Goldman Sachs and other investors bought a majority interest in Syncsort Incorporated. In October 2013, Syncsort sold its data protection business to an investor group led by Bedford Venture Partners and Windcrest Partners. According to the firm, the sale is expected to allow Syncsort to focus on the “Big Iron to Big Data" market opportunity.

Urbanus is a genus of skipper butterflies. They belong to the subfamily Eudaminae, which was long included with the spread-winged skippers (Pyrginae) as a tribe. They are found from southern USA to South America.
Some smaller genera have been merged with "Urbanus". One of these, now junior synonyms, is "Eudamus", the type genus of the Eudaminae. But in the wide circumscription listed here, "Urbanus" is apparently not monophyletic, and thus some of the formerly independent genera are likely valid.

Argyrosomus japonicus

Argyrosomus japonicus is a silvery to bronze-green colored fish, a member of the Sciaenidae family, which may grow up to in length. It is known as mulloway or jewfish in Australia and dusky kob in South Africa. The name jewfish refers to the large earstones, which are prized as "jewels" by some fishers. 
Description.
"Argyrosomus japonicus" is a large, slender fish which can grow to . It has a copper-colored head and is silvery with a bronze-green dorsal surface and paler belly. It has with a row of distinctive white spots running along the lateral line. The caudal fin is angular in juveniles but becomes more rounded in larger fish. 
Distribution and habitat.
"Argyrosomus japonicus" has an Indo-Pacific distribution occurring in coastal waters surrounding Australia, Africa, India, Pakistan, China, Korea and Japan. Adults are gregarious and are found over soft bottoms mainly beyond the surf zone, occasionally going inshore. Juveniles are exclusively found in shallow water and sometimes move in to estuaries. 
Fish stocks in South Africa.
In South Africa, the fish is sought after by both commercial and recreational fishermen alike. Over the past 5 years, the fish stock has been declining rapidly. In a recent study, local beach seine operations were cited as being responsible for decimating the fish stocks. Little regard is taken by these Seine Netters to conserve these fish. There have been continual reports that these Seine netters at Muizenberg Beach in False Bay have kept every fish caught on occasions when no fisheries' official is on site. There has been photographic proof posted on the web showing pickups full of undersized fish leaving the beach. These fish are supposed to be released, but the Seine netters seek opportunity to keep every fish possible when no law official is present. The authorities have been slow to act on this matter.
In 2011, officials arrested one of the two seine netters that operate at Muizenberg Beach for having a freezer full (over 1500 juvenile) of undersized "Argyrosomus japonicus". The case was dropped until there was a public outcry and the department of public prosecution in Cape Town had decided to reopen the case. A decision should be made before the end of 2013 as to whether to charge the Muizenburg Beach Seine Netter or take no action and set a precedent for other operators to keep undersized fish.

Lloyd Demetrius

Lloyd A. Demetrius is a mathematician and theoretical biologist at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics at Berlin, Germany, and the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary biology, Harvard University. He is best known for the discovery of the concept, evolutionary entropy, a statistical parameter that characterizes Darwinian fitness in models of evolutionary processes at various levelis of biological organization - molrcular, organismic and cultural .. Evolutionary entropy, an analogue of the Gibbs entropy in statistical physics, is the cornerstone of directionality theory, an analytical study of evolution by variation and selection . The theory has applications to : a) the development of aging and the evolution of longevity ; b)the origin and progression of age related diseases such as cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer,s disease and Parkinsons,s disease ; c) the evolution of cooperation and the spread of inequality.
Education.
Born in Jamaica, he carried out his undergraduate studies in mathematics at the University of Cambridge, UK. He received his PhD in mathematical biology, from the University of Chicago and was then a postdoc at the University of California, Berkeley.
Career.
Demetrius was a faculty member in a number of mathematics departments in the USA: University of California, Berkeley; Brown University, and Rutgers University (1971–1979); and a research scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Göttingen (1980–1989). Since 1990, he has been with the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, first as a visiting professor (1990–1992), and then as an associate in population genetics. He has held visiting professorships at MIT, University of Paris, and was an occupant of a Chaire Municipale, a distinguished visiting professorship at the University of Grenoble. His research includes the application of ergodic theory and the theory of dynamical systems to the study of evolutionary processes in biological and socio- economic systems .He has also pioneered the application of the methodology of Quantum Mechanics to the study of allometric relations between metabolic rate and generation time in cells . This work is the mathematical basis for the analysis of cancer and neurodegenerative disorders as metabolic and bioenergetic diseases.

Church of the Militant Elvis Party

The Church of the Militant Elvis Party is a political party in the United Kingdom. The leader of the party is David Bishop who also goes by the nickname of Lord Biro/Bus-pass Elvis. The party has 6 registered campaign groups i.e. 'Bus-pass Elvis Party', 'Elvis Defence League', 'Elvis turns Green Party', 'Grumpy old Elvis Party', 'Militant Elvis Anti-Tesco Popular Front' (MEAT-PF) and the 'Elvis and the Yeti Himalayan Preservation Party' as will as 'Militant Elvis Anti HS2'. The party is concerned with the depletion of the Amazon rainforest, climate change, the power of Tesco on the British high street and the power of large corporations. A book on Elvis noted that "an obviously ironic attitude toward Elvis is used in the service of rather serious anti-imperialist political objectives". It deregistered in December 2008, but re-registered in March 2010 and stood in the 2010 general election in Kettering, gaining 112 votes.
Electoral history.
Bishop previously stood in the 1997 general election in Tatton against Neil Hamilton as "Lord Byro versus the Scallywag Tories", gaining 116 votes (0.2%).
He first stood as the Church of the Miltant Elvis in the 2001 General Election in Brentwood, where the party came last with 52 votes. Bishop stood in the same seat as then Veritas politician Robert Kilroy-Silk in the 2005 General Election in Erewash. He promised to place giant photos of celebrities at airports "to discourage undesirable foreigners from entering Britain", to have a public inquiry into British vets' fees, to go to Antarctica and shout at icebergs to "stop melting", to "present Mr Blair with an Oscar for his marvellous performance as a sincere politician", to give Kilroy-Silk a job as "keeper of the Royal stool", and to preserve the red squirrel. He campaigned in a red cat suit, and says he was heckled while campaigning. The party gained 116 votes and again came in last place.
Bishop stood again as one of 26 candidates in the Haltemprice and Howden by-election, 2008, on a platform of overthrowing the capitalist state, due to it turning Elvis into a "fat media joke". He argued that George W Bush is the anti-Christ, and campaigned to imprison Cherie Blair to prevent her reporting details of her sex life, and to place CCTV in the bedroom of Nick Clegg. He came 17th with 44 votes (0.2%).
Campaign pledges for the 2010 general election for Kettering included filling in potholes, bringing back dog licences, introducing moats around houses, Bono for Pope, turning public schools into pound shops, and keeping public lavatories.
Bishop stood for election in the Oldham East and Saddleworth by-election on 13 January 2011 as the candidate for the Bus-Pass Elvis Party, gaining 67 votes (0.1% of votes). 
In the Corby by-election on 15 November 2012, as candidate for the Elvis Loves Pets party, Bishop came 10th out of 14 candidates, with 99 votes (0.28% of votes), almost three times the vote of the candidate for the apparently politically serious Democracy 2015, which was fighting its first election.
On 28 February 2013, Mr Bishop stood in the Eastleigh by-election, 2013 as a candidate for the Elvis Loves Pets party, registering 72 votes (0.17%).

Apium prostratum

Apium prostratum, commonly known as sea celery, is a variable herb native to coastal Australia and New Zealand. The leaves are variable, with toothed leaflets, and a celery like aroma. The tiny white flowers occur in clusters. 
There are two varieties:
The subspecies "Apium prostratum" subsp. "howense" is endemic to Lord Howe Island.
Uses.
Sea celery was an important vegetable for early Australian explorers and colonists. Captain Cook ate sea celery at Botany Bay and gathered it in bulk along with "Lepidium oleraceum" at Poverty Bay in New Zealand in October 1769 to protect his crew from scurvy. It was commonly eaten by colonists as a survival food in the early days of the Sydney colony.
Both leaf and stem are eaten. Dried leaves are used in native Australian spice mixes. It tastes much the same as celery and is used to flavour soups. Variety "filiforme" is considered to be more palatable. 
It was first cultivated by colonists around Albany, Western Australia, as a vegetable. It is commercially cultivated to a limited extent.

Cast and characters.
The main stars of the film are Bella Heesom, who plays "Emma", and Alex Falk, who plays her ex-boyfriend "Jamie". Deborah Bouchard also stars as Emma's best friend, "Avril".
Make Your Mark in Film.
Ten teams of wannabe film-makers from across the UK won the chance to film one episode of a 50 minute film that was screened at the Edinburgh International Film Festival. The teams had access to a shooting kit and main cast but with no additional budget for filming, they needed to use their entrepreneurial skills to source the other resources required to get their episode ‘in the can’.
This exciting and unique collaborative production kicked off on 29 March 2007 when the teams met the actors, scriptwriter and each other at a launch party at the Rich Mix cultural centre in Bethnal Green, London. They also had the opportunity to meet influential individuals from the film industry including Stewart Till, Chair of UK Film Council; Senior producer for BBC Film Network, Claire Cook; and founder of the Raindance Film Festival, Elliott Grove.
The first team started shooting in Liverpool in April 2007. Each subsequent episode was filmed in a different region and the final film screened at Edinburgh International Film Festival in August 2007.
The competition, Make Your Mark in Film, was designed to encourage young people in their teens and twenties to have ideas and make them happen through their interest in film. It is run by the national Make Your Mark campaign and Cobra Beer’s short film competition, CobraVision, and backed by key players in the film industry, including UK Film Council, Lord Puttnam and the Raindance Film Festival.
To win the chance to produce one of the episodes, each team had to beat fellow competitors in their region. Now, they are competing for the accolade of ‘best episode’ in the film.
Production.
The first stage of the competition, to write a 10-episode screenplay, was launched at the 2006 Edinburgh International Film Festival. The winner, chosen by a panel of judges including Quadrophenia director Franc Roddam,was Judy Upton with My Imprisoned Heart.
The second stage began in February 2007, when teams from across the UK competed to be one of ten collaborative film production teams, each producing one five-minute episode of My Imprisoned Heart.
Each winning team had access to a ‘shooting kit’, main cast and, on occasion, celebrity cameos. But there was no budget provided for filming as the competition relied on teams using their enterprising skills.
Each episode was shotwithin 3 days in a different location across the UK.
Locations.
Due to the film's unique production, being made by ten independent teams, the film was shot across eight different UK cities (Norwich and London had two teams and were thus represented twice). Each episode was film in the following cities:
Release.
Despite premiering at The Edinburgh International Film Festival on August 22, 2007, the final 59 minute film is currently in post production, but should be completed in the summer of 2008.

John Buckley (sculptor)

John Buckley (born 1945 in Leeds, England) is an English sculptor whose best known work is the sculpture "Untitled 1986", better known as "the Shark House" or "The Headington Shark" in Headington, a suburb of Oxford.
Buckley went to sculpture classes in the evenings when studying for his O-levels in a technical college. He went on to Winchester School of Art and Leicester College of Art, and thereafter worked as a lorry driver and labourer while getting his career as sculptor off the ground.
In 1976, his friend Bill Heine invited Buckley to design the sculptural fixtures on the Penultimate Picture Palace. For the facade Buckley chose a dramatic figure reminiscent of Al Jolson with outstretched hands. Mae West's lips were the inspiration for the cinema's door handles and, somewhat later Buckley would erect a male and a female figure above the toilet entrances, whimsically named Pearl and Dean.
In 1978, a work of his ("Pagliaccio") was exhibited by Nicholas Treadwell at the Washington Art Fair, and he stayed with Treadwell for some time thereafter.
The "Headington Shark" was erected on the 41st anniversary of the dropping of the atomic bomb on Nagasaki. Made of fibreglass on the farm near Wallingford, Oxfordshire where he was based, the shark itself weighs 203 kilograms and is 25 feet long. Buckley regards it as an integral part of "Untitled 1986" or "Shark House", a work of ""Mixed Media, Brick, slates, wood, metal, polyester resin, glass, plaster, oil paint, lace curtaining and window boxes…….""
John Buckley is a patron of MAG (Mines Advisory Group), a neutral and impartial humanitarian organisation.

Citizens United to Protect the Maurice River and Its Tributaries, Inc.

Citizens United to Protect the Maurice River and Its Tributaries, Inc., or "CU", is a 501(c)(3) (nonprofit) regional watershed organization. It was founded in 1979 and incorporated in 1986. 
CU received Environmental Quality Awards from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1994 and again in 2000 for their efforts to procure the federal Wild and Scenic designation for the Maurice, Manantico, Manumuskin Rivers and the Muskee Creek. In the year 2000 CU was also acknowledged by the EPA for the work on an osprey colony, their annual raptor and waterfowl survey, the film “Down Jersey” and accompanying teachers’ guide, and the North American Wetlands Conservation Act.
In 2002 Citizens United to Protect the Maurice River and Its Tributaries, Inc. took first place in the category of Education and Learning Institute, NJ Department of Environmental Protection, Division of Watershed Management for their PBS film “Down Jersey” and the teachers’ curriculum, “Down Jersey: Celebrating Our Sense of Place.” Over 500 teachers have taken workshops in order to teach the curriculum.
CU also co-produced a documentary with New Jersey Network for which they received a Mid-Atlantic Emmy award for Outstanding Arts Program or Special.
Mission.
Their mission reads:
Work.
CU’s work in the Maurice River watershed typically begins geographically at Willow Grove Lake and continues south; the South Jersey Land and Water Trust begins its work in the vicinity of Willow Grove Lake and extends northward to the headwaters of Scotland Run.
The Maurice River watershed has a drainage of and runs south through Cumberland County, New Jersey to the Delaware Bay. The major tributaries of the Maurice River include Scotland Run, Manantico Creek, Muskee Creek, Muddy Run, and the Manumuskin River.
On December 1, 1993, President Bill Clinton signed a congressional act designating 10.3 miles (16.6 km) of the Maurice River, 7.9 miles (12.2 km) of the Manantico Creek, 14.3 miles (23.0 km) of the Manumuskin River, and 2.7 miles (4.3 km) of the Muskee Creek as Wild and Scenic.
The Delaware Bay estuary is a Ramsar Wetlands of International Importance listed site. It has also been named by The Nature Conservancy as one of the "Last Great Places on Earth".
Ecological significance.
The Maurice River watershed includes a variety of habitat supporting rare wildlife and plant populations. Its vast wetland and forest complexes host wintering waterfowl and spring migratory shorebirds. A 1992 report by the National Wild and Scenic River Study states that “he study area functions as critical migration-related habitat for shorebirds, songbirds, waterfowl, raptors, rails and fish. The Maurice River and its tributaries drain the Southwest portion of the Pinelands National Reserve, which is also an International Biosphere Reserve under the United Nations Man and Biosphere Program.”
The New Jersey Landscape mapping indicates the Maurice River watershed as habitat for bald eagles, waterfowl, and several other migratory birds. In addition, the area contains the world’s largest population of "Aeschynomene virginica", (sensitive joint vetch). Its NatureServ Conservation Status is G2, globally imperiled. The watershed also contains the state’s largest expanse of wild rice marsh, within the Glades Refuge, and an old growth swamp forest, Bear Swamp, a NJ state listed Natural Heritage Priority Site.
Cultural history.
The Native Americans called the Maurice River “Wahatquenack”. The river’s current name is thought to be derived from the Prince Maurice, a 17th-century Dutch ship reputed to have sunk in its waters.
The river’s maritime history is intertwined with the oyster harvest, commercial fishing, and shipbuilding. The AJ Meerwald, a 1928 oyster schooner that operated on the Maurice and in the Delaware Bay, dubbed “NJ’s Tall Ship” by former Governor Christie Whitman, has been restored by the Bayshore Discovery Project for educational purposes.
Economic importance and recreational opportunities.
The Maurice River supports such industries as commercial crabbing, eeling, net fishing, and oystering. Boating, kayaking, canoeing, birding, hiking, fishing, hunting and railbirding are several of the recreational activities pursued on the river. President Benjamin Harrison hunted on the Maurice River during his presidential term.
Approach.
Education.
CU created a curriculum called “Down Jersey” which won the 2000 EPA Regional Education Award, and the 2001 NJDEP Statewide Watershed Award for Education. CU also partnered with New Jersey Network Public Television in 1997 to create a documentary by the same name in conjunction with this curriculum. Additionally, CU and NJN partnered on two other documentaries: “Bayshore Artists: Celebrating Our Sense of Place,” in 2001, and “Glenn Rudderow: Reflections of a Bayshore Painter,” in 2005, the second of which was awarded a Mid-Atlantic Emmy award for Outstanding Arts Program or Special. The documentary aired nationally in 2006.
CU has also created various educational slideshows such as “Eggs to Flight” which follows the maturation of osprey from hatching to fledging, and “Fish and Chicks” which traces the decline and subsequent restoration efforts involving the osprey on the Maurice River.
Additionally, CU has created a botanical site that focuses on the flora of southern New Jersey and the Pine Barrens of New Jersey.
CU has documented the local history of a number of reaches on the Maurice River as well as securing source material on the Burcham Farm, the last remaining diked farm in southern New Jersey.
Other aspects of CU’s educational approach include:
The group also provides a scholarship for art students. The Connie Jost Scholarship was created in 1998 in memory of the late Connie Jost, a local artist, painter, sculptor, and educator who frequently incorporated fish and marine animals into her works.
Fieldwork.
CU’s fieldwork includes an osprey colony project, purple martin banding, wood ducks, Adopt-a-Swamp pink population, eagle nest monitoring, and international shorebird team assistance.
Osprey colony project: The osprey (Pandion haliaetus) ) is a bird of prey (raptor) which feeds almost exclusively on fish. Seen in the coastal estuaries of many countries, the osprey is present on every continent with the exception of Antarctica. Its head is white with a black eye stripe. Its wing span is four and half to six feet and it is highly streamlined, making it an extremely maneuverable flier. Its talons are extremely sharp, which helps in piercing through the scales of a fish. Osprey generally mate for life but they will choose a new partner if a mate perishes. They normally lay three eggs; four is rare. On average they raise 2.5 young each season. Under the management of the New Jersey State Division of Fish and Wildlife, the NJ Endangered and Nongame Species Program monitors osprey populations statewide. Historically there were 500 nesting pair of osprey in NJ. In the 1950s and 1960s the use of DDT reduced their numbers to 50 pair. They were not productive, so chicks were brought in from nests in regions that had not been exposed to these chemical contaminants and the young were fostered by NJ’s remaining birds. The fledglings imprinted to the area and returned as adults to build their own nests along New Jersey’s rivers and bays. 
Citizens statewide volunteered to help restore populations by providing nesting platforms for this threatened species. In the mid-1980s Citizens United to Protect the Maurice River and Its Tributaries, Inc. (Citizens United or CU) began an osprey colony. In 2007 the State passed the milestone of 400 nesting pair. Citizens United’s volunteers monitor approximately 50 nesting platforms and they have constructed and erected more than 50 platforms for other organizations and corporations, including the NJ Endangered and Nongame Species Program, NJ Department of Protection Bureau of Emergency Response, Community Energy, PSE&G and The Natural Lands Trust. 
CU volunteers maintain the 50+ platforms along the Maurice River. Each June and July they band the offspring in these structures. Between 1985 and 2007 more than 150 people participated in this project. When the program was begun in 1985, an average of three chicks fledged each year. Since 2006, nesting pairs have produced in excess of 60 chicks. The platform design developed by Citizens United has become the official design of the State of New Jersey. The platform plans and materials list, available online, have been utilized by people from a number of different geographical regions.
Purple martin banding: Purple martins (Progne subis) are the largest of the North American swallows and, in the eastern U.S., are entirely dependent upon man for their housing. In conjunction with CU, members and other individuals band the birds for research purposes. In 2008, CU member Allen Jackson and those working with him banded over 8000 purple martins, an increase of 2000 birds from the prior year. CU also donates funds to purchase the bands. 
Wood ducks: CU has put up a number of wood duck boxes on both the Manumuskin and the Maurice, and has also taught various groups of local high school students to build them, as well as making the plans for the boxes available online.
Adopt a swamp pink population: Swamp pink (Helonias bullata) is a federally threatened member of the lily family. Seventy percent of its global population occurs in New Jersey. CU has partnered with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service on a monitoring project, “Adopt-a-Swamp-Pink Population”. The survey results are shared with U.S.F.W.S. and NJ Natural Heritage.
Assisting NJ Division of Fish and Wildlife, Endangered and Nongame Species Program: CU assists in two facets: a number of volunteers monitor eagles’ nests for the State; and their members also provide support to the international Shorebird Team that visits May–June of each year to study the migratory shorebird phenomenon. CU members help with the banding of shorebirds, as well as hosting the scientists during their stay by providing them with meals and local cultural activities. 
World Series of Birding: CU’s team, the “Fish Hawks”, was formed in 2007 and placed second in the category of limited geographical region that year. A portion of the monies raised by the team defray the expenses of hosting the international shorebird scientists.
Research.
CU has funded in part or wholly a number of studies of flora and fauna in the Maurice River watershed including an annual Raptor Waterfowl study carried out since 1988, a number of botanical surveys, and the Parvin-Tarkiln Branch Water Study.
Advocacy.
Citizens United to Protect the Maurice River and Its Tributaries, Inc. has been involved in environmental advocacy since its inception, and has made presentations and given testimony at local, state, and national levels for local land protection efforts.
Some of those include: 
Partnerships.
Since its inception, CU has partnered with other conservation organizations. Partners have included National Park Service, Natural Lands Trust, The Nature Conservancy, New Jersey Network, New Jersey Audubon Society, NJ Conservation Foundation, Bayshore Discovery Project, NJ Division of Fish and Wildlife, Rutgers Environmental Law Clinic, Columbia Environmental Law Clinic, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. CU also works with corporations on their habitat projects: Community Energy, PSE&G Estuary Enhancement Project, Morie Sand and Gravel and others.
CU is also a member of the South Jersey Bayshore Coalition.

Filipe da Madre de Deus

Frei Filipe da Madre de Deus (Lisbon, ca. 1630 – Seville, ca. 1688 or 1690) was a Portuguese Baroque composer.
Life.
Filipe da Madre de Deus was born in Lisbon, about 1630. Although he lacked a deep knowledge of music theory, he was a skilled composer and vihuelist at the court of Philip IV of Spain (Philip III of Portugal until 1640).
In 1654, John IV of Portugal heard about the notoriety of Madre de Deus and hired him for the Portuguese court. Two years later, John IV died and was succeeded by Afonso VI. Sometime between April 1660 and August 1661, Afonso VI nominated Madre de Deus as "mestre da câmara de música real" ("master of the royal chamber music").
In 1668, Peter II was appointed regent for Afonso VI, his insane brother, and all his former employees were taken off the royal payroll. Thus, Filipe da Madre de Deus had to return to Spain in 1668. He was succeeded by the renowned António Marques Lésbio as master of the royal chamber music of Portugal.
Madre de Deus retired to the monastery of the barefooted Mercedarians of San Laureano in Seville. He continued as chapel master of this monastery until at least 1688, the year of his last known work. He probably died there about 1688 or 1690.
Works.
Filipe da Madre de Deus composed mainly "villancicos" and "tonos" for several occasions and holidays, including an 18th-birthday salute to Afonso VI, "Ostente aplausos festivos" ("Ostentate joyous applause"), and the famous "negro villancico" for Christmas, "Antonya, Flaciquia, Gasipà". He also composed sacred choral works with continuo accompaniment.
Recordings.
The following recordings include works by Madre de Deus:

State Hill, Pennsylvania

State Hill is a rather large and sparsely populated unincorporated community in Lower Heidelberg Township, Pennsylvania, in Berks County. The area that is now State Hill was once called Lorah, Pennsylvania. This was named for the first settler within the village's boundary. At one time, the main road thru the unincorporated community was called Dry Road. It received the name for lack of water to tap into for wells. This road is now known as Brownsville Road. The village started out as just a few cabins, but by the mid-1800s had built a Tavern. It was called Dry Tavern, named after the road it was on. The village has a great view of Blue Marsh Lake along Brownsville Rd. It is also home to an extinct elementary school, Lower Heidelberg Consolidated School, which ran from 1931 to 2006. It is served by the academically prestigious Wilson School District. State Hill also has several businesses, including Berks Western Telecom, Ganly's Pub and Deli, Blue Marsh Taxidermy, a Fire Station, and a Police station. Ganly's was built in 1993. It was built where The Beer Garden Tavern used to be on. There are also 5-6 row homes on the intersection of State Hill Road and Brownsville Road. These were built by the government for the residents of the now flooded Blue Marsh village.

Pond Lane Flood Gates

Pond Lane Flood Gates is a redundant flood defence structure, located near Lea Bridge Road on the River Lee Navigation in the London Borough of Hackney, England.
History.
The flood gates were the third water control structure to be built in the vicinity. When the Hackney Cut was first opened in 1769, the River Lea flowed over a weir, now known as the Middlesex Filter Beds Weir, to follow its original course, and the new cut was protected by Lea Bridge half lock, a single set of gates just below the start of the cut. These could be closed to prevent high levels on the river affecting the cut. Lea Bridge Lock was demolished in 1853, and was replaced by Pond Lane Lock at Cow Bridge in 1865, but it was only operational for seven years, as the navigation was rebuilt for larger barges, and was made level between Old Ford and Tottenham. Although the lock was no longer needed, it was retained so that it could be used to protect the cut from flooding as Lea Bridge half lock had once done. There were plans to fit it with gates pointing in both directions, to prevent draining of the cut below the gates if too much water was drawn from the river by the waterworks at Lea Bridge, but this was not carried out. The structure lasted until 1931, when it was demolished, to be replaced by the Pond Lane Flood Gates, a little further upstream. These consisted of vertical guillotine gates, which could be used to isolate the cut in times of flood, and were designed to help prevent flooding of Hackney Marsh. 
The construction of the Thames Barrier caused the flood gates to become redundant and they were finally removed in 1987. The footbridge over the lock still remains.
Location.
The remains of the flood gates are located south of the Lea Bridge Road at Lea Bridge and adjacent to the former Middlesex Filter Beds which are now a nature reserve. The filter beds were built in 1852, to provide cleaner water to London, as a response to an outbreak of cholera three years before. They became redundant when the Coppermills Water Treatment Works was built at Walthamstow in 1969, and by the time Thames Water took over responsibility for them in 1974, they were already providing habitat for a range of plants and wildlife. They subsequently became part of the Lee Valley Regional Park in 1988, and the filter beds now provide areas of wet woodland, reed beds and open water. Over 60 varieties of birds have been seen at the reserve, which is close to the Waterworks Nature Reserve, a similar site occupying some of the Essex filter beds, which were built later than the Middlesex filter beds.
Public access.
Walking and cycling access to the gates is possible by following the Lea Valley Walk, which runs along the towpath of the Hackney Cut. The nearest railway station is Clapton railway station, which is about to the west of the gates.

Middle Level Commissioners

The Middle Level Commissioners are a land drainage authority in eastern England. The body was formed in 1862, undertaking the main water level management function within the Middle Level [http://middlelevel.gov.uk] following the breakup of the former Bedford Level Corporation.
The Middle Level is the central and largest section of the Great Level of The Fens, which was reclaimed by drainage during the mid-17th Century. The area is bounded on the northwest and east by the Nene and Ouse washes, on the north by previously drained Marshland silts and to the south and west by low clay hills. The Middle Level river system consists of over 120 miles (190 km) of watercourses most of which are statutory navigations and has a catchment of over 170,000 acres (70,000 hectares).
History.
In the distant past Great Britain was part of continental Europe with the rivers of eastern England being tributaries of the River Rhine, which flowed across a flat, marshy plain, which is now the southern North Sea. Following the end of the last Ice Age, the sea levels rose, severing Britain from Europe and flooding the area now occupied by the Fens. The fen area gradually became separated from the sea by extensive sand banks, which circled the fringes of the Wash. Within the fens, dense vegetation grew in the fresh water forming peat deposits, which built up over some 6000 years, until at the time of the Norman Conquest, the peat fen had risen above the level of the sea, although several lakes or meres remained. A number of settlements had been built, not only on the silt fringes of the Wash but also on a number of clay islands within the fens. 
Although the Romans and Saxons had built a series of flood banks to protect the Marshland silts to the north, and a number of small local projects had been carried out during the Middle Ages to reclaim small areas of fen in the vicinity of some of the island towns and villages, no comprehensive schemes for the draining of the Fens were carried out until the 17th Century. During the period between 1630 and 1655, the Dutch engineer Sir Cornelius Vermuyden[http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~engcam/cvermydn.htm] was employed by the Earl of Bedford and others to carry out a comprehensive scheme to reclaim the Great Level of the Fens. The scheme involved the cutting of the Old and New Bedford Rivers to bypass the meandering course of the River Great Ouse and create a huge washland from Earith to Salters Lode to store flood water. The Middle Level area was protected from the flood waters of the Great Ouse and Nene by two huge barrier banks which stretched from Earith to Salters Lode and from Stanground to Guyhirn. Within the Middle Level he cut a number of new straight drainage channels such as the Sixteen Foot, Forty Foot and Twenty Foot drains with the bulk of the Middle Level area draining into the Great Ouse at Salters Lode, via the Old Course of the River Nene which continued to be the major waterway of the area. 
The improved drainage caused a rapid shrinkage of the peat fen and land levels dropped. By the early 18th Century, lowering land levels had required the Middle Level rivers to be embanked and many wind pumps to be built to lift the water from the field dikes into the rivers. By the early 19th Century many of the wind engines had been replaced by steam to allow the water to be lifted through greater heights, to take account of the even greater peat shrinkage resulting from the improved drainage. 
By this time it was clear that improvements to the drainage systems would be a never ending process and, in 1844, an Act of Parliament was passed to allow the cutting of the Middle Level Main Drain, which moved the main outfall sluice from Salters Lode to St Germans, some 9 miles further down the Great Ouse, where low tide levels were 7 feet (2.5 metres)and lower. At Mullicourt Aqueduct, the old drainage channel, which is still a statutory navigation, is carried over the Main Drain, providing a graphic illustration of the effects of land shrinkage. 
From the time of Vermuyden, the drainage of the Middle Level had been run by the Bedford Level Corporation, until 1862 when a new Act of Parliament set up the Middle Level Commissioners [http://www.middlelevel.gov.uk/], who have continued to administer the drainage and navigation of the Middle Level to the present day. 
The Middle Level Commissioners.
The Middle Level Commissioners consist of representatives from both the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors. Occupiers of agricultural property receive a rate demand direct from the Commissioners. The "rates" on non-agricultural properties, such as houses and factories, are paid through a special levy issued to the district councils within the Commissioners' area. These councils, Fenland District Council Huntingdonshire District Council [http://www.huntsdc.gov.uk and the Borough Council of King's Lynn & West Norfolk [http://www.west-norfolk.gov.uk] are therefore, able to appoint representatives as Commissioners in respect of the payment made in relation to these properties.
Internal drainage boards.
Within the Middle Level there are 29 independent internal drainage boards initially set up in the 18th century and each responsible for the local drainage of their area. Most have pumping stations and discharge their run-off into the main Middle Level watercourses. Many of these IDBs are administered from the Middle Level Offices and their administrative and financial work is carried out by Middle Level staff. In addition, Middle Level staff also undertake engineering and planning liaison consultancy work for a large number of Boards. Internal drainage districts administered by the Middle Level Commissioners:
Navigation.
The Middle Level, apart from its flood protection role, is also the fourth largest navigation authority in the United Kingdom and is responsible for approximately 100 miles (160 kilometres) of statutory navigation and operates six navigation locks. The Nene-Ouse Navigation Link forms part of the Middle Level Navigations. The Link is at present is the only connection between the Great Ouse and the Main Canal Network. During a normal summer, over 1,000 passages of the Link-Route are made by pleasure craft. The Commissioners issue Navigation Notes, which provide navigation details for boat owners, who wish to use the system.
The Middle Level Waterways Users Committee consists of representatives of the Commissioners and Users of the Middle Level system. It advises the Commissioners of the different requirements for water use in the Middle Level area and assists them in meeting such requirements so far as the Commissioners are able to do.
Conservation.
Within the Middle Level Catchment there are three Major National Nature Reserves at Woodwalton MarshMonks Wood and Holme Fen [http://www.yaxleypc.org.uk as well as a number of smaller sites of more local interest. The Commissioners have a statutory duty to further nature conservation in the performance of their functions and operate a specific conservation strategy, which forms a basis for all their river maintenance operations. There is also a close working relationship with Natural England, in particular through the Conservation Committee, which includes representatives of the Commissioners, the Environment Agency, Natural England and the local Wildlife Trusts.

Semecarpus australiensis

Semecarpus australiensis, Australian cashew nut, is a species of Australian trees that grow naturally in monsoon forests (rainforests with deciduous trees) or rainforests, from sea level to 250m, often near to the sea. It has been found in NT, Cape York, and Queensland wet tropics, Australia, Torres Strait Islands, New Guinea, New Britain, Aru Islands and additional Pacific Islands. It is related to the standard cashew ("Anacardium occidentale").
The leaves are prominently veined, large, dark green on the upper surface and paler underneath. Small cream-coloured flowers are followed by unusual fruits that have the seeds on the outside contained in a leathery pod attached to an orange or red fruit-like fleshy base.
Uses.
Because of the extremely irritating sap, Aborigines exercise great care in preparing the seeds, including handling the fruit with hands coated in clay for skin protection. The seeds are roasted in the fire before eating, and taste similar to normal cashews.

Craigmore, South Australia

Craigmore is a large suburb north of Adelaide, South Australia. It is located in the City of Playford local government area, just east of Elizabeth south of Gawler.
History.
Craigmore is within the traditional territory of the Aboriginal Kaurna people of the Adelaide Plains. European settlement in the area began in 1855 when Blair Farm was constructed situated just north of what is now Uley Road . Modern development of Craigmore started circa the late 1960s/ early 1970s with the construction of State Housing Trust estates. During 1975, the south eastern part of what is now Craigmore was built as a private development named Blair Park. Further private developments occurred during the mid-1980s, late 1990s, and throughout the 2000, with urban infill still incomplete. This development has made Craigmore one of Adelaide's longest suburbs by distance, totalling 3.75 kilometres parallel with Adams Road between Kakuna Crescent and Arthur Street.
Geography.
Craigmore is situated on foot hills approximately 29 km by road from the Adelaide GPO. Although Craigmore is a suburb of Adelaide and part of the Adelaide metropolitan area, Craigmore is 11 km from Gawler by road. Most dwellings are build up to the start of the hills (One Tree Hill), which are used for cattle grazing and wine growing.
Adams Creek runs through the middle of Craigmore, with elevation of the suburb ranging from 86 to 149 meters at its highest point.
Demographics.
The 2006 census shows Craigmore as having a population of 10,319. Residents of Craigmore have a mixed income, with older former public housing residents located in the middle, and newer larger, more expensive houses in the newer estates such as Somerset Grove and Beckham Rise.
Community.
The local newspaper is the News Review Messenger. Other regional and national newspapers such as The Advertiser and The Bunyip are also available.
Facilities.
Craigmore is serviced by a High School which opened in 1970. Craigmore is also serviced by a shopping centre containing a Coles Supermarket, a liquor store BWS, an award winning bakery and many other speciality shops. There is a YMCA, a number of public primary schools, Catherine McCauley School, and an R-12 Christian school. Close by, the large Munno Para Shopping City has many large stores including K-Mart, Foodland, Bunnings, and Harvey Norman. as well as the even bigger Elizabeth shopping centre. A new Woolworths shopping centre is also located in the adjacent Blakes Crossing. Uleybury Winery and restaurant is a short 3 km walk from Craigmore. Some sporting clubs that reside in the area are Craigmore Cricket Club and the Munno Para City Soccer Club.
In June 2010, Craigmore was finally given television reception through the erection of a tower on the corner of Uley and Adams Roads in Elizabeth Park. In the same month, Craigmore was also given ADSL equivalent speed internet through wireless WiMAX. Prior to this date, one half of the dwellings in Craigmore were within an ADSL blackspot and were required to rely on 3G, dialup, or satellite internet.
Parks.
Craigmore Park runs through the centre of the suburb. The linear park known as the 'Elephant Walk" can be followed to Anderson Walk in Smithfield. As Craigmore borders the Adelaide Hills, there are lookout points on Craigmore Road and Uley Road, where the York Peninsula can sometimes be seen on a clear day.
Transport.
The area is serviced by the 441, 442 and 443 Adelaide Metro buses. Both these buses terminate at Smithfield and Elizabeth Interchanges, with train connections to Adelaide and Gawler. The 443 covers most the routes covered by the 441 and 442, running late at night.

Judicial nominating commission

A judicial nominating commission (also judicial nominating committee, judicial nominating board) in the United States, is a body used by some U.S. states to recommend or select potential justices and judges for appointments by state governments. 
Judicial nominating commissions are often established by the state constitution as part of merit selection plans.. They are designed to be independent bodies. A common procedure is for the commission to receive applications for that position and forward three names to the governor, who has some number of days (often 60) to select one.
The powers, size, role, and makeup of judicial nominating commissions vary widely from state to state. Some commissions only make recommendations for appellate courts (the state supreme court and any intermediate appellate courts). Others make recommendations for trial court judge appointments as well.
Judicial nominating commissions are also used on the county level, such as in some Alabama counties.

Olive Riley

Olive Riley (20 October 1899 – 12 July 2008) was an Australian centenarian woman, born in Broken Hill, New South Wales, believed for a time to have been the world's oldest blogger. (politician Ruth Hamilton of Orlando, Florida was later found to be older and also a blogger).
Blog sites.
She began her blog "The Life of Riley" in February 2007 at the age of 107 and made her final post on 26 June 2008 from a nursing home in Woy Woy, New South Wales, complaining of a cough about two weeks before she died at the age of 108. She had posted over 70 entries, as well as several video posts on YouTube.
Documentary Film - Co-director.
Her blog (or "blob" as she called it) began soon after the release of a film about her, "All About Olive", directed by documentary filmmaker Michael Rubbo and released in 2005. Rubbo gave Olive a co-directing credit, making her the oldest director in the world. The blog was suggested by Eric Shackle, a journalist in his late eighties, who was interested in promoting the idea that one is never too old for the internet.
Since Olive could not see well enough to type, Mike set up the blog for her and ran it for next two years with Eric's help, recording her stories, at first on audio and then later on video, to post over 100 YouTube items, all still visible today, as is her archive at "mike.mikerubbo.com".

One of the six main fish hatcheries in Bangladesh, it was the largest hatchery in the district during the Noakhali Rural Development Project implemented during 1978-1992 by DANIDA, a Danish development agency. One of the three Principal Scientific Officers (PSO) of the Department of Fisheries of Bangladesh governments is assigned to Raipur Hatchery. It also is one of three training centers directly governed by the Director General of the Department, along with Fisheries Training Institute (Chandpur) and Fisheries Training Academy in (Dhaka).
The Raipur Upazila has 8 fish farms, 14 dairy farms, 72 poultry farms and this one hatchery. As of 2004, the government-owned hatchery was able to produce 504 kilograms of hatchlings a year, which mostly consisted of endemic species like "Catla catla" (katla), "Labeo rohita" (rui), "Cirrhinus cirrhosus" (mrigal), "Labeo calbasu" (kalabaus), "Clarias batrachus" (magur), and "Channa striata" (shingi).
History.
In 1979, mirror carps ("Cyprinus carpio var. specularis") from Nepal were first introduced to Bangladesh for the World Bank financed Raipur Fish Hatchery. In 1982, the Raipur Hatchery started artificial spawning in Bangladesh. In 2001, the Greater Noakhali Aquaculture Extension Component (GNAEC), a sub-program of DANIDA's Agricultural Sector Program in Bangladesh, shifted from the hatchery development strategy of hatched at the Raipur Hatchery. GNAEC abandoned "backyard hatcheries" and "village type prawn hatcheries" models for large-scale private sector development

Celaenorrhini

The Celaenorrhini are a tribe in the skipper butterfly subfamily Pyrginae (spread-winged skippers). When the Eudaminae were still included in the Pyrginae as a tribe, their delimitation versus the Celaenorrhini was disputed, and there were even suggestions that the latter might belong in the former. But in reality, these two lineages of moderately advanced skippers are quite distinct. Some Celaenorrhini genera were also placed in the fairly closely related (but nonetheless distinct) tribe Tagiadini on occasion; "Capila" however has turned out to be properly placed there.
These skippers are mainly found in tropical Africa. A few are found in Asia, and some species presently placed in the (paraphyletic) type genus "Celaenorrhinus" are found in the Neotropics. The closest living relatives of the Celaenorrhini are – other than the Tagiadini – the firetips, which were formerly treated as a subfamily but are nowadays considered the Pyrginae tribe Pyrrhopygini.

The following genera – listed in the presumed phylogenetic sequence – are placed in the Celaenorrhini:

The Brew (band)

The-Brew is a British Rock band consisting of Tim Smith (bass), Kurtis Smith (drums) and Jason Barwick (guitar, vocals). They were voted "best band" 2006/7 by "its only Rock & Roll" magazine (the magazine of the rolling stones fanclub [http://www.iorr.org]). The band was described by rock critic Michael Arens as "earthy, fertile, and sometimes wonderfully grainy" and creating "flawless rock" with a "touch of Psychedelic," and described by RockTimes critic Joachim 'Joe' Brookes as a "bridge between the sixties and seventies".
Biography.
Though often named a modern blues band, The Brew have evolved far beyond the restrictions of blues to become one of Europe's most prominent rock bands. Hailing from Grimsby (UK) the band draws inspiration from a wide range of influences, from the experimental psychedelic tunes of the '60s, to more contemporary artists on the rock scene. 
The band's extensive European tours have resulted in a massive underground following, which is just beginning to break into the mainstream as their fan-base rapidly increases. Appearances across national television and radio stations in Belgium, France, Germany, Poland, Spain and Holland have confirmed the band as one of Britain’s better known musical exports.
In early July 2007, The Brew headlined the Maasboulevard Festival in Holland and were invited back to perform in 2008. They were described there at the end of the gig by their Dutch hosts as ‘The father, the son and holy spirit!’ for their sensational performance.
In 2006, The Brew were such a success at The Rock ‘n’ Blues Custom Show at Pentrich, Derbyshire, they were asked not only to do a second gig by the organisers on the following day on the Centre Stage, something not heard of in this events 25 year history, they were then booked to return in 2007.
Pentrich, Rock ’n’ Blues regularly attracts some 45,000 people every year and Saturday, July 28, 2007, The Brew headlined on the Cross Piston Stage and were an outstanding success, taking a double encore from the audience. The Brew, in August 2007, performed on The British Stage at the UK’s biggest R’n’B festival in Colne, and once again on the day were the only band to receive double encores. In 2008 they headlined the festival on the Sunday, on the British stage.
They have played alongside some of the Worlds leading Rock bands past and present and continue to tour extensively across the world.
Recently The Brew completed a 2hour Live Set for the national Belgium Radio Station, Classic 21 and were filmed by National France TV 2, for their performance at this year's Festival in France, Le Blues Autour Du Zinc. They have performed at the National Classic 21 Radio Station, RTBF Showcase Festival in Brussels,one Belgium’s Premier festivals.
Reaching number two in the USA iTunes Blues Download Chart in August 2007 provided even more evidence that the world is ready for the band.
Recently, the latest album, "The Joker" reached number 16 in the Popular Album Charts in Poland and number 15 in The blues Album Charts in the same country.
In 2009 The Brew received national recognition throughout Germany when their performance at Rockpalast Festival was broadcast across the country and beyond, on WDR TV and they performed again on Rockpalast in 2012.
A MILLION DEAD STARS
In 2009 The Brew returned to the recording studio and the result, A Million Dead Stars, was released January 2010. The album was produced by legendary British producer Chris West and released by Jazzhaus Records. Since its release the trio have toured the breadth of Europe extensively and headlined dozens of festivals across the continent.

Guido Rodríguez Alcalá

Guido Rodriguez Alcalá (born Asunción, Paraguay, 1946) is a poet, narrator, historian, journalist, essayist, and literary critic. He is an assiduous collaborator in different local and international newspapers.
Work.
This play has a wide selection of letters interchanged between Artigas and Paraguay’s Government Board, that show some less known aspects of Paraguayan history. The author includes explanations.
This play includes vivid stories from the protagonists of the Paraguayan War, compiled by Guido Rodríguez Alcalá. The residents were the women that didn’t have any misfortune with the president. The destined or traitor ones, were the women destined to g onto the concentration camps for being relatives of enemies of the president.
«And that is not all, that were just little things that happened at the beginning, I mean at the end of the war, because the Brazilians didn’t want to hear talk about an armed Paraguayan with a knowledge; they didn’t want us to have an army… they didn’t trust us, that’s why they stayed here until 1887… but back then, any soldier would go out to the street, out of his barracks, and right there he was grabbed among two or three other men, when they could grab them, there was no security.. there was no respect, no police, no nothing… there were police, but they were like four stupid men armed with sticks, and that didn’t really work out to assure the tranquility, and then they realized that they needed an army; they needed something like us, to assure the peace and also for the liberals to not give away all the Chaco to Argentina. Because you would understand that Paraguay didn’t want to stay without its Chaco, neither Brazil wanted that a territory like the Chaco was given away to Argentina just like that, because back then, the Argentines reached Brazil until Mato Grosso and that could damage them. and that was when we agreed with the Brazilians, both of us against Argentina. ¡who would’ve said that we would fight that much! ¡who would’ve said that they had to pick me, me, the one who had liquidated so many regiments so many times! but that was my advantage in my trip to Rio: Paraguay’s provisory government had asked the Brazilians to hold me like a war prisoner because in Paraguay I could do a mess, they say, buy I took advantage of my trip to make good relations that would work for me 
In 2002, Guido Rodríguez Alcalá took farther Paraguayan history with his novel "Velasco" to put it correctly in its regional environment, in the time just before the independence, and examine the political processes that had happened to reach to it and to speculate with documented facts about what had happened. 
In some way, Rodríguez Alcalá abandons his regular historical subject, based in the reestablishment of Paraguayan mystified figures by the dictatorship, to widen his perspective to the international connection of Paraguayan independence. 
Besides rebuilding everything that had happened during the time in which Velasco was Paraguay’s governor, with the nucleus that pursued the emancipation, in it, the principal conclusion that we can get is that the Paraguayan politics has been hold on to the process of development of the neighbor countries, that’s why the incident of the exterior relations in national politics has been bigger than what usually people think and not only in the politic perspectives that guilt the other countries or the English imperialism of the warlike disasters. 
This, in the end, refutes the isolating perspective of the official historiography. "Velasco" is one of the most transcended transparent rebuilding of a period, the moment of the independence, where there are lots of gaps. 
As you can see, this narrative correspond to the common places of common treatments in the colonial time, to force the revisiting of this period, to ask themselves of the human reactions and to re-vindicate a new point of view that comes closer to what could`ve happened since the reinterpretation allowed by fiction.
Comments.
Guido Rodríguez Alcalá centered his last novel "Velasco" in one of those men who had marked the history of his country. The Colonel Bernardo de Velasco (was the first governor of the Misiones Province and since 1806 also Paraguay's governor) was the last representative named by Spain: in very unclear circumstances, Velasco was taken down in the night of May 14 and the morning of May 15 in the year 1811; and later included in the temporary government (supposedly independent) that was formed on May 16 of that year. 
After a thorough documentation (this was the origin of his unpublished essay “Rasgos americanos de la independencia Paraguaya” (American features of Paraguayan Independence), Guido Rodríguez Alcalá, in his novel, gets close to the last moments of the colony and to the first moments of the independence. To do this, like he had already done in his two previously mentioned novels, he fictions the figure of an historic character, and gives him a voice, making him become the narrator, main character and witness of the facts. 
The plot of "Caballero" and "Caballero rey" (as in many other stories of Rodríguez Alcalá) is that Velasco abandons the struggle of the Paraguayan War and its immediate consequences. Nevertheless, some of the resources like the insertion of different narrative voices, and the combination of real and unreal events are still maintained. And he continues with the tendency of building much more linear plots that make them easier to understand. 
Against what would happen in the other two novels, the character now attracts the reader. And not just because we are not in front of a treacherous like Caballero, but also because Velasco lacks contradictions and invites to the credibility; and because the language used by the author incites the readers to identify themselves with the narrator. In fact, when we confront an unclear subject that is slightly manipulated by the official historiography, it seems that Rodriguez Alcalá is abandoning part of his previous attacking aim. In a democratic transition moment like the one happening right now, in the sense of the historic novel is slightly different from the one during the dictatorship: back then, attempting to the myths established by the stronismo was like battling to the regime itself; now, the novel retrieves its playful function without forgetting the investigation of truth. 
And that truth implies stripping some of the affirmations of the official historiography: that way, Velasco says (page 58) that on May 16, 1811 “there was no tricolor flag ran up like people had said. The flag that was ran up was the Spanish one”; and he says, “we swore royalty to Fernando VII”. Regarding to the Communist Revolution, that some people interpreted like a preamble of the independence, Velasco affirms “it was not a rebellion against the law but against the Jesuits” (page 66).
Like it happens it his previous novels, Guido Rodríguez Alcalá plays with the word of his characters to proclaim situations that are extended in time much more than what the characters in the novels should know: for example, Velasco rush forth against the “local addiction of destroying documents”(page. 49); affirms that the guarani is “the language of the poor population and of the ignorant rich population, that among our rich people, there are lots of them” (page. 100);and he proclaims “books about Paraguay, unfortunately are not written or are not published” (page. 105). When that system isn’t enough to update the text, the author does not doubt to turn his characters into visionaries (“those porteños [...] will still guilt us of their own mistakes within 100 years” page. 176), nor going to the anachronism (Saturnino Rodríguez de la Peña appears like «the Poltergeist of the soap factory», page. 159).
However, the most used resource is the irony: «not a single French philosopher had taken care of this business, so we don’t have a fiction such as the hatch about the Jesuit system» (page. 84). An irony commonly used by the author is the one against the first Paraguayan dictator: in the margin of this considerations, we need to emphasize that as in his previous work, the text "Velasco" is full of quotes of real documents: Velasco’s peaces of letters (page. 49), notes sent to the authorities (pág. 55), Cabildo’s transactions (page. 62), parts of the report written by Governor Pinedo in 1775(pages. 108-109), rules of the government (page. 188).Some of this are useful for the character to be able to respond to multiple questions that are made in the attempt to understand what has happened. This is just a reflection of the author’s costumes. 
As we’ve seen, “Donde ladrón no llega”, “Vagos sin tierra” and “Velasco” are three approaches to Colonial Paraguay’s history and intrahistory. Three extraordinary novels that witness the validity of historic narrative in Paraguay during the change of century; and that show the existence of mature authors that had known how to create an own literary voice.
Writings.
Guido Rodríguez Alcalá has published work in almost every genre. 
His literary production includes, among others:
Poetry.
He has also written lots of essays: "Literatura del Paraguay" (1980) and "Ideología autoritaria" (1987) and also some historic researches: "Paraguay y Brasil", "documentos sobre las relaciones binacionales, 1844-1864" (2007) about 20 years before the Paraguayan War and "Justicia Penal de Gaspar_Rodríguez_de_Francia" (1997) among others.
Sometimes it is difficult to separate the narrative of the store in his work, because of the exhaustive research and the abundance of quotes and references.

Lounge On The Farm

Lounge On The Farm is a music festival held annually at Merton Farm, Canterbury, Kent, which attracts thousands of visitors each year. Although there has been a vast increase in the capacity of the event, as well as the amount and quality of the performing acts, organizers insist that they keep the festival ‘non-conformist’, promoting bands and produce from Kent. The festival had been held six times, with a festival also planned for 2012.
2006.
The first Lounge On The Farm festival, taking place on Saturday Sunday 15–16 July with three stages; the DJ tent, the acoustic tent, and the main stage, (now the Cow Shed). Around 80 acts performed.
Notable Acts
2007.
Second Lounge On The Farm festival, held over three days, with almost double the amount of acts as the last. The Acoustic Tent from WSSL, the Arabesque tent, the DJ tent was renamed the Hoedown, and the main stage renamed the Arabesque stage cover. New additions included the Sheep Dip, The Further Tent and The Festival Folly stage.
Notable Acts
2008.
The third Lounge On The Farm, with 7 stages over 3 days. 150 acts performed in total, attracting the biggest attendance of the festival yet, 4000.
Notable Acts
2009.
The 2009 Lounge On The Farm took place on the 10–12 July. The Horrors and Edwyn Collins have been announced to headline the Cow Shed on Friday and Sunday respectively but, as of May, no Saturday headliner has been revealed. Additions this year include the Sunday night Rockaoke where festival-goers will be able to grace the stage with a full backing band and The Meadow, a new area which aims to take festivals back to the era where festivals were all about being chilled out. The Meadow will include an open-air theatre and a petting zoo.
Notable acts
2010.
2010 was a stellar, sun drenched three day extravaganza for LOTF. 
A wonderfully eclectic line-up saw the likes of Martha Reeves, Example, Hercules & Love Affair and Toots and the Maytals rocked Merton Farm to its core, with a great further array of acts such as Slow Club, Tunng, Kitty Daisy & Lewis, These New Puritans & DJ Yoda, The Glimmers, Gold Panda, James Yuill, whilst our superb green credentials saw the Sustainability Award come our way once more!
Notable acts
2011.
Merton Farm saw 10,000 revellers roll through its gates for the very first time, and the festival introduced a new Main Stage, whilst the Cow Shed became the Dance Arena. Acts such as The Streets, Ellie Goulding, Example, Katy B, Everything Everything, The Vaccines & Echo and the Bunnymen all impressed, whilst The Meadows Stage held a deliciously eclectic bunch. Cast, Cornershop, La Shark, Syd Arthur, Spector and a host of other acts played amazing shows but the highlight for many was Graham Coxon ..
Notable acts
2012.
The festival is yet again planned for another year, on 6th, 7 & 8 July 2012 at Merton Farm. Due to incidents that occurred during the 2011 festival (including removal of all Youth ticket holders from the Cow Shed while Netsky (musician) was playing, sparking outrage from hundreds of young people across social networking sites), the Festival organisers have restricted the sale of youth tickets, as detailed in their terms and conditions.
A Selection of the Acts Announced as of 09/05/2012

Arnd Krüger

Arnd Krüger (born July 1, 1944) is a German professor of sport studies. Krüger earned his BA (English major) from UCLA in 1967 and his PhD from the University of Cologne (Modern and Medieval History) in Germany in 1971. He attended UCLA on a track scholarship, was 10 times German champion, and represented Germany in the 1968 Olympics in the 1500m run.
After completing the PhD, Krüger worked for the German Sports Federation (1971–74), and the Berlin Teachers' Training College (1974–78). He was Associate Professor for "Coaching and Movement Sciences" at the University of Hamburg (1978–80) and then became full professor for Sport Studies and Chair of the Physical Education Department at the University of Göttingen. He has served several times as Dean of the School of Social Sciences in Göttingen.
Krüger was the founding president of the European Committee for the History of Sport (1995–97). and has been the President of the "Niedersächsisches Institut für Sportgeschichte" (Lower Saxony Institute for Sport History). since 2000. He is the author/editor of more than 40 books and has been published in 15 languages.
Krüger gained international notoriety in 2008 when he told an academic conference that the eleven Israeli Olympic athletes killed by Palestinian terrorists in an event known as the Munich massacre had effectively decided to commit suicide by allowing themselves to be killed in order to "strengthen the victim status of Israel" and thereby allow the Jewish state to use their deaths as an "instrument against the Palestinians."
According to Haaretz, the German Sports Sciences Association dubbed Krüger's remarks "unfortunate," and said the disciplinary board will convene to discuss the case. He later was reprimanded, but not excluded, as he was clearely not an anti-semite 
The ombudsman-commission of his university in charge of the case (under the chairmanship of a Law Professor, with qualifications of a high court judge) heard witnesses and acquitted him.
He was honored by an international Festschrift at the occasion of his 65th birthday (2009).

<doc id="18432824" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18432824" title="Detached object">
Detached object

Detached objects are a dynamical class of bodies in the outer Solar System beyond the orbit of Neptune. These objects have orbits whose points of closest approach to the Sun (perihelion) are sufficiently distant from the gravitational influence of Neptune that they are essentially unaffected by Neptune and the other planets: this makes them appear to be "detached" from the Solar System.
In this way, they differ substantially from the majority of the known trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), which form a loosely defined set of populations that have been perturbed to varying degrees onto their current orbit by gravitational encounters with the gas giants, predominantly Neptune. Detached objects have larger perihelia than these other TNO populations, including the objects in orbital resonance with Neptune, such as Pluto, the classical Kuiper belt objects in non-resonant orbits such as Makemake, and the scattered disk objects like Eris.
Detached objects have also been referred to in the scientific literature as extended scattered disc objects (E-SDO), distant detached objects (DDO), or scattered–extended, as in the formal classification by the Deep Ecliptic Survey. This reflects the dynamical gradation that can exist between the orbital parameters of the scattered disk and the detached population.
At least nine such bodies have been securely identified, of which the largest, most distant, and best known is Sedna.
Orbits.
Detached objects have perihelia much larger than Neptune's aphelion. They often have highly elliptical, very large orbits with semi-major axes of up to a few hundred astronomical units (AU, the radius of Earth's orbit). Such orbits cannot have been created by gravitational scattering by the gas giants (in particular, Neptune). Instead, a number of explanations have been put forward, including an encounter with a passing star or a distant planet-sized object. The classification suggested by the Deep Ecliptic Survey team introduces a formal distinction between "scattered-near" objects (which could be scattered by Neptune) and "scattered-extended" objects (e.g. 90377 Sedna) using a Tisserand's parameter value of 3.
Classification.
Detached objects are one of four distinct dynamical classes of TNO; the other three classes are classical Kuiper-belt objects, resonant objects and scattered-disc objects (SDO). Detached objects generally have a perihelion distance greater than 40 AU, deterring strong interactions with Neptune, which has an approximately circular orbit about 30 AU from the Sun. However, there are no clear boundaries between the scattered and detached regions, since both can coexist as TNOs in an intermediate region with perihelion distance between 37 and 40 AU. One such intermediate body with a well determined orbit is .
The discovery of 90377 Sedna together with a few other objects such as and (also known as "Buffy") has motivated discussion of a category of distant objects that may also be inner Oort cloud objects or (more likely) transitional objects between the scattered disc and the inner Oort cloud.
Although Sedna is officially considered a scattered-disc object by the MPC, its discoverer Michael E. Brown has suggested that because its perihelion distance of 76 AU is too distant to be affected by the gravitational attraction of the outer planets it should be considered an inner-Oort-cloud object rather than a member of the scattered disc. This classification of Sedna as a detached object is accepted in recent publications.
This line of thinking suggests that the lack of a significant gravitational interaction with the outer planets creates an extended–outer group starting somewhere between Sedna (perihelion 76 AU) and more conventional SDOs like (perihelion 35 AU), which is listed as a scattered–near object by the Deep Ecliptic Survey.
One of the problems with defining this extended category is that weak resonances may exist and would be difficult to prove due to chaotic planetary perturbations and the current lack of knowledge of the orbits of these distant objects. They have orbital periods of more than 300 years and most have only been observed over a short observation arc of a couple years. Due to their great distance and slow movement against background stars, it may be decades before most of these distant orbits are determined well enough to confidently confirm or rule out a resonance. Further improvement in the orbit and potential resonance of these objects will help to understand the migration of the giant planets and the formation of the Solar System. For example simulations by Emel’yanenko and Kiseleva in 2007 show that many distant objects could be in resonance with Neptune. They show a 10% likelihood that 2000 CR105 is in a 20:1 resonance, a 38% likelihood that 2003 QK91 is in a 10:3 resonance, and an 84% likelihood that is in an 8:3 resonance. The likely dwarf planet appears to have less than a 1% likelihood of being in a 4:1 resonance.
Possible detached objects.
This is a list of known objects by decreasing perihelion, that could not be easily scattered by Neptune's current orbit and therefore are likely to be detached objects:

Massachusetts general election, 2008

The Massachusetts general election, 2008 were held on November 4, 2008 throughout Massachusetts. Among the elections which took place were those for the office of President of the United States, John Kerry's seat in the Senate, all ten seats in the Massachusetts delegation to the House of Representatives, all eight seats in the Massachusetts Governor's Council, and all of the seats of the Massachusetts Senate and Massachusetts House of Representatives. There were also three ballot questions: to eliminate the commonwealth's income tax; to decriminalize possession of a small amount of marijuana; and to prohibit greyhound racing. Numerous local elections also took place throughout the state.
United States Senate.
U.S. Senator John Kerry (D) defeated Democratic challenger Edward O'Reilly in the primary on September 16, 2008. He defeated Republican Jeff Beatty and Libertarian Robert Underwood in the general election. The seat was considered safe for John Kerry.
United States House of Representatives.
All 10 members of the delegation to the United States House of Representatives in Massachusetts were up for re-election in 2008. All 10 seats were under Democratic control. Republican candidates contested four of the races. In District 1, Republican Nathan Bech opposed Democratic incumbent John Olver. (John Olver defeated a Democratic challenger, Robert Feuer, in the primary on September 16, 2008.) In District 4, Republican Earl Sholley and Unenrolled candidate Susan Allen opposed Democratic incumbent Barney Frank. In District 6, Republican Richard Baker opposed Democratic incumbent John Tierney. In District 7, Republican John Cunningham opposed Democratic incumbent Ed Markey. Despite these challenges, all ten seats were considered safe for their incumbents.
Governor's Council.
All 8 current members of the Massachusetts Governor's Council were up for re-election in 2008. The Governor's Council's most important role is to approve the governor's judicial nominees, serving as an important check on the power of the Governor. Because Governor's Council districts are so large, and because the office of Governor's Councillor has very little awareness in the state, it is notoriously difficult to unseat an incumbent.
In 2008, six of the eight incumbent Governor's Councillors defeated a Democratic challenger in the primary on September 16, 2008. One of the eight incumbents, Thomas Merrigan, faced a Republican challenger, Michael Franco, in the general election. One of the seats was uncontested.
Massachusetts Senate.
All 40 seats in the Massachusetts Senate were up for election in 2008. The Massachusetts Democratic Party maintained a supermajority of 35 seats, with the remaining 5 seats under the control of the Massachusetts Republican Party.
Massachusetts House of Representatives.
All 160 seats in the Massachusetts House of Representatives were up for election in 2008. The Massachusetts Democratic Party maintained a supermajority of 144, with the remaining 16 seats under the control of the Massachusetts Republican Party.
Local Races.
Register of Probate.
Each of Massachusetts' fourteen counties elected a Register of Probate, who will administer the county's family and probate court. Races in Barnstable County, Bristol County, Hampden County, and Nantucket County are expected to feature more than one candidate in the general election.
County Treasurer.
Bristol County, Duke's County, Norfolk County and Plymouth County each elected a County Treasurer in the 2008 Massachusetts general election. Only the race in Plymouth County featured more than one candidate for the position.
County Commissioner.
Barnstable County, Bristol County, Duke's County, Norfolk County and Plymouth County will each elect one or two County Commissioners in the 2008 Massachusetts general election. Every race will feature more than one candidate for the position.

Quadrilateralized spherical cube

In mapmaking, a quadrilateralized spherical cube, or quad sphere for short, is an equal-area mapping and binning scheme for data collected on a spherical surface (either that of the Earth or the celestial sphere). It was first proposed in 1975 by Chan and O'Neill for the Naval Environmental Prediction Research Facility.
This scheme is also often called the COBE sky cube,
because it was designed to hold data from the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) project.
Elements.
The quad sphere has two principal characteristic features. The first is that the mapping consists of projecting the sphere onto the faces of an inscribed cube using a curvilinear projection that preserves area. The sphere is divided into six equal regions, which correspond to the faces of the cube. The vertices of the cube correspond to the cartesian coordinates defined by |x|=|y|=|z| on the unit sphere. For an Earth projection, the cube is usually oriented with one face normal to the North Pole and one face centered on the Greenwich meridian (although any definition of pole and meridian could be used). The faces of the cube are divided into a geodesic grid of square bins, where the number of bins along each edge is a power of 2, selected to produce the desired bin size. Thus the number of bins on each face is 22N, where N is the binning depth, for a total of 6 × 22N. For example, a binning depth of 10 gives 1024 × 1024 bins on each face or 6291456 (6 × 220) in all, each bin covering an area of 23.6 square arcminutes (2.00 microsteradians).
The second key feature is that the bins are numbered serially, rather than being rastered as for an image. The total number of bits required for the bin numbers at level N is 2N+ 3, where the three most significant bits are used for the face numbers and the remaining bits are used to number the bins within each face. The faces are numbered from 0 to 5: 0 for the north face, 1 through 4 for the equatorial faces (1 being on the meridian), and 5 for the south. Thus at a binning depth of 10, face 0 has bin numbers 0–1048577, face 1 has numbers 1048576–2097151, and so on. Within each face the bins are numbered serially from one corner (the convention is to start at the "lower left") to the opposite corner, ordered in such a way that each pair of bits corresponds to a level of bin resolution. This ordering is in effect a two-dimensional binary tree, which is referred to as the "quad-tree". The conversion between bin numbers and coordinates is straightforward: if four-byte integers are used for the bin numbers the maximum practical depth, which uses 31 of the 32 bits and results in a bin size of 0.0922 square arcminutes (7.80 nanosteradians).
In principle, the mapping and numbering schemes are separable: the map projection onto the cube could be used with another bin-numbering scheme, and the numbering scheme itself could be used with any arrangement of bins susceptible to partitioning into a set of square arrays. Used together, they make a flexible and efficient system for storing map data.
Advantages.
The quad sphere projection does not produce singularities at the poles or elsewhere, as do some other equal-area mapping schemes. Distortion is moderate over the entire sphere, so that at no point are shapes altered beyond recognition.

Kilroy (TV series)

Kilroy was a BBC One daytime chat show hosted by Robert Kilroy-Silk that began in 24 November 1986 and finished on 29 January 2004 after 18 years. The series was originally called "Day to Day" for the first two seasons, and renamed to "Kilroy" in September 1988.
Controversy and cancellation.
The show was taken off the air in 2004 after Kilroy made racist remarks. Kilroy said that the "Arabs have never contributed to civilisation". He stated other views that made matters worse. He ridiculed Scots, the Irish, the Iraqis, Black people, Pakistanis, the French and Germans. The Commission for Racial Equality reported him to the police.
The BBC cancelled the show, stating that his views were a threat to the network's impartiality. Kilroy claimed afterwards on the BBC's "Question Time" that he had been under a six month investigation when this happened. He stated that his show was cancelled because he was anti-religion, rather than racist. However panelist Shappi Khorsandi claimed that his views were about Arabs as a people rather than their religion. Kilroy had previously claimed to have apologised in 2004. It was rejected primarily because Kilroy himself twisted his words. Iqbal Sacranie (secretary-general of the Muslim Council of Britain) claimed that Kilroy had not retracted his views but skimmed over the apology and changed a few words.
The programme was replaced by "Now You're Talking!", which followed a similar format and was presented by Nicky Campbell and Nadia Sawalha.

Dialogue in the Dark

Dialogue in the Dark ("Dialog in the Dark" in American promotional materials) is an awareness raising exhibition and franchise, as well as a social business. In "Dialogue in the Dark", blind guides lead visitors in small groups through different settings in absolute darkness. Through this visitors learn how to interact without sight by using their other senses, as well as experience what it is like to be blind. The exhibition is organized as a social franchising company, which offers the exhibition as well as business workshops, and has created jobs for the blind, disabled, and disadvantaged worldwide. The exhibition aims to change mindsets on disability and diversity, and increase tolerance for “otherness”. Since its first opening in 1988 over six million visitors from more than 25 countries have experienced "Dialogue in the Dark", which has provided over 6,000 blind people jobs.
History.
The founder, Andreas Heinecke (*1955), had both Jewish and German ancestry. At the age of 13 he realized that members of his mother’s family had been victims of the Holocaust and members of his father’s family had been supporters of the Nazi regime. This realization started a lifelong search for answers such as: What is the process of marginalization and exclusion? On what ground do we judge people and feel inferior or superior? The impact of his search for answers was the start of his quest for tolerance, open dialogue and exchange, and created the ground work for the creation of the Dialogue in the Dark exhibition.
The foundation stone for the social enterprise "Dialogue in the Dark" was laid in 1986. At that time Andreas Heinecke worked as a journalist and documentary writer for a broadcasting corporation in Germany. One day he was assigned to organize a formation for a 28 years old journalist, who had lost his eyesight in a car accident. Initially confronted with awkward feelings, Andreas started to realize that his pity was misplaced. He discovered being blind is another form of life that contains lots of capabilities. To his surprise it was the blind colleague who showed him how to cope with fundamental changes in life, forcing him to question what makes a truly valuable life. Thereafter he was fascinated by the world of blind people, and he was shocked by the discrimination against them, to which they are still exposed today. This inspired the concept of overcoming the barriers between and promoting exchange between blind and seeing people that is the basic idea of Dialogue in the Dark.
In December 1988 "Dialogue in the Dark" had its premiere in Frankfurt, Germany. For more than 10 years it toured throughout the world as a travelling exhibition in places like museums or as a special event in a fair or festival. Since then the exhibition has been turned into a franchise, headed and owned by the brand owner Dialogue Social Enterprise. The first permanent exhibition was established in Hamburg, Germany (Dialog im Dunkeln) in 2000.
There have been exhibitions in more than 150 cities in over 30 countries in America, Asia, Europe and the Middle East. Meanwhile there are now permanent exhibitions in Japan, Italy, Israel, Austria and the USA. The most recent being the temporary exhibition in New York City which opened on August 2011.
Andreas Heinecke, was announced Social Entrepreneur by Ashoka (2005) and the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship (2007).
Idea.
The main concept of the exhibition is role reversal, as within the exhibit the blind become "sighted" and are placed with in their element while the seeing become blind. Furthermore the sighted get torn out of their social routines and blind people give them a sense of orientation and mobility. During and after the tour visitors have the opportunity to ask questions they normally might never have the chance to ask a blind person, reducing the barriers on both sides and helping the engender understanding between both groups. As a “platform for communication” the emphasis of the exhibition is not on blindness, but rather on the importance of understanding, empathy, and solidarity. The exhibition aims to facilitate social inclusion of marginalized people on a global basis.
Mission.
Dialogue in the Dark has two main goals. The first is to increase the public’s awareness of and tolerance for “otherness”, thereby overcoming barriers between “us” and “them”. Sighted people enter the darkness and, as they begin to experience how capable they actually are, will find themselves questioning their assumptions and prejudices about what it means to be "normal" and "capable". Placing themselves in the care of a blind person allows people to understand the strengths and potential of those they often assumed to be weaker and less able then themselves. This experience allows the darkness to become a place of unfettered communication and a beneficial exchange.
According to its website, Dialogue in the Dark's second goal is to create jobs for disadvantaged people by turning perceived deficits into potential assets.

Juji Nakada

Biography.
Personal history.
Juji Nakada was born on 27 October 1870 in the northern town of Hirosaki in what is now Aomori prefecture, the son of Heisaku, "a samurai of the lowest rank in the Tsugaru domain."(Goodman 48) His father died when Nakada was four leaving his family impoverished. He was raised in the Methodist church. After studying in the Methodist Too college (Daimyo School), in 1888 he enrolled in Tokyo Eiwa Gakko, the forerunner of today's Aoyama Gakuin University, another Methodist institution. Pre-occupation with judo prevented his graduation. Nakada married on 23 February 1889. In 1891 he left to became a Methodist missionary to Yakumo, a small village on the island of Hokkaido. He subsequently served in Otaru, Etorofu island, and Odate in Akita Prefecture.
On 20 March 1911, Nakada's wife and child both died. Five months later Nakada married Ayame. On 14 September 1939, his second wife, Ayame, died of uterine cancer. Ten days later, on 24 September 1939, Nakada died of intestinal tuberculosis at the age of 68.
Moody Bible Institute (1896-1898).
After the death of his first son, and the illness of his wife, Katsuko, Nakada experienced a deep crisis of faith. (Goodman 49) Nakada, while already an effective evangelist, experienced dryness in his soul: "'If I don't find the power of the Holy Ghost,' he told his wife before he left Japan, 'I'll come back, leave the ministry, and become a dentist.'"(McCasland 77)Soon after, in 1896 Nakada traveled to Chicago, Illinois and enrolled at the Moody Bible Institute.
While studying at MBI, Nakada befriended a Western Union executive, Charles Elmer Cowman (1868-1924) and his wife, Lettie Burd Cowman (1870-1960); and Ernest A. Kilbourne (1865-1928) and his wife, Julia, (some sources say Hazel) through the Grace Methodist Episcopal Church. While studying at MBI he met holiness theologian Rev A.M. Hills, who gave him a copy of his book "Holiness and Power". Mrs Cowman records:As he earnestly sought to be filled with the HOLY SPIRIT, it was not long until his hungry heart was satisfied. Having come so definitely into the blessings, he soon felt strongly impressed that GOD would send him back to his people to preach full salvation to them.[http://www.baptistbiblebelievers.com/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=XLGIArlJlFs%3d&tabid=216&mid=705] Nakada was also influenced by the writings of John Wesley (McCasland 77); an association with J.R. Boynton, a Chicago physician who practised faith healing(Goodman 49); and Martin Wells Knapp, who later founded God's Bible School in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1901.(McCasland 77)
Return to Japan (1898-1900).
In September 1898 Nakada returned to Japan after meeting Barclay Fowell Buxton, leaders of the English holiness movement in England. In 1899 Nakada was appointed a traveling evangelist in the Methodist church, although he preached beyond that denomination. He was supported financially by the Cowmans and Kilbournes, who have formed the Telegraphers Missions Band in Chicago. Also in 1899 he started the Japan Holiness Journal.(Bays 486)
Central Gospel Mission (1900-1904).
In 1900 Nakada left the Methodist church and founded the Central Gospel Mission (Chuo Fukuin Dendokan) in Jinbo-cho in central Tokyo. The Cowmans arrived in Japan on 1 February 1901 as the first missionaries of the Pilgrim Holiness church. (Bundy 711) Soon after the arrival of the Cowmans, Nakada helped establish the Tokyo Bible Institute (later Tokyo Bible Seminary) The goal of the mission group, which by 1902 included Ernest and Julia Kilbourne and their three children, was to "establish self-supporting, self-governing, and self-propagating churches on the William Taylor model" (Bundy 711). The hall held Bible classes in the daytime and was the venue for evangelistic services in the evening. (Goodman 49) By 1903 the Central Gospel Mission had outgrown its hall and relocated to a new building in Kashiwagi, Yodobashi-cho.
Oriental Missionary Society (1904-1917).
In 1904 the name was changed to the Oriental Missionary Society (Toyo senkyokai) with an enlarged focus on all of East Asia, including Korea and China. A conflict between Cowman and Nakada over the leadership of the OMS resulted in a split in 1911, with the Cowmans heading the OMS and Nakada as the head of the new Japan Holiness Church (Nihon seikyodan). While there would be reconciliation later, there was lasting damage in the relationship.
Korea (1904).
During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905 Nakada served as a chaplain under General Kuroki Tamemoto.(Stark 481) Nakada secured permission from the Japanese government to minister to Japanese troops fighting in Manchuria. As he passed through Korea, Nakada preached "wherever the opportunity arose. Two Koreans in particular, Chung Bin and Kim Sang-jun, were profoundly moved by Nakada's preaching on "the glorious experience of sanctification...The two Koreans, burdened about their struggle for the life of holiness, were left with no source of spiritual guidance. Providentially, they met a Korean doctor who knew Nakada and had visited the OMS Bible Training Institute in Tokyo. He urged that they visit the school. Deciding it must be the place for them to hear more about the experience they were seeking, Chung and Kim unexpectedly showed up in Tokyo one day in 1904." Out of these contacts, Cowman and Kilbourne were able to start the OMS work in Korea in 1907.
Manchuria (1904-1905).
Nakada left Korea to serve as chaplain in Manchuria until the end of the Russo-Japanese War.
Evangelism in Britain and the USA (1906-1907).
In early 1906 Nakada went to Britain "ostensibly to rest and be spiritually recharged."(McCasland 93) While there he became friends with Scottish holiness preacher Oswald Chambers. Nakada preached throughout the British Isles, including preaching holiness to the recent converts of the 1904–1905 Welsh Revival(McCasland 94) with American Quaker evangelist Charles Stalker, and also throughout Scotland and England with Chambers. After almost a year in Britain, Nakada departed on 6 November 1906 with Chambers for the USA on the "SS Baltic". After a ten-day crossing of the Atlantic Ocean, Nakada and Chambers spent five weeks preaching on the East Coast, before moving to Cincinnati, Ohio to preach in the Christmas Holiness Convention at God's Bible School.[McCasland 104) Nakada travelled throughout the USA preaching often. He returned to Cincinnati in June 1907 to preach during another ten-day holiness convention. On 10 July 1907 Nakada and Chambers departed from Seattle, Washington on the "SS Shinano Maru", and arrived in Yokohama on 27 July 1907.(Stark 3ff).
Oriental Missionary Holiness Church (1917-1928).
In 1917 the Oriental Missionary Holiness Church (Toyo senyokai horinesu kyokai) was organised with Nakada as the first bishop.(Bays 486)(Goodman 50) Nakada wrote that the purpose of the new organisation was: "as the name indicates, a missionary society. Our purpose is simple: to propagate the complete Gospel, that is, the Foursquare Gospel (salvation, holiness, the Second Coming of Christ, and healing) all over Japan"(Goodman 50)
Second Advent Movement.
On 6 January 1918, Nakada and Uchimura Kanzō began the Second Advent Movement. Rallies were held throughout Japan with up to two thousand attending. While Uchimura and Nakada were momentarily united by their shared devotion to preaching the Second Coming, there were significant theological differences between them. Uchimura, influenced by neo-orthodox thought, rejected the idea of a literal millennium and calculating the dates of Christ's Second Coming. Nakada's beliefs that the Jews and Japanese descended from a common ancestor and that the salvation of the Jews would result in the salvation of the Japanese resulted in Uchimura leaving in 1920.
Revival in Tokyo (1919-1920).
Toward the end of November 1919, as a result of evangelistic preaching and prayer, a revival broke out at the Yodobashi Holiness church in Tokyo. It spread to other churches in the city. While not resulting in the conversion of non-Christians, according to Nakada it had the following results:(1) the qualitative development of the membership;(2) an increase in giving;(3) the spiritual unity with men of other denominations (mostly pastors) who shared in the revival meetings;(4) an increase in the spirit of evangelism. (McGavran 197)
Japan Holiness Church in America.
By 1920, Nakada was "one of the most influential evangelists in Japan".
Shrine Shinto.
Nakada’s statement on the shrine issue appeared in the church publication, "Friends of Holiness", on 30 January 1930:
Some people in authority in the Bureau of Religions have set forth the idea that Shrine Shinto is not a religion, and thus have disposed of the issues very simply. In the name of ancestor veneration it has been schemed that everyone be required to bow at a Shinto shrine. But religion is not a thing that can be dealt with so simply at the hands of politicians who know nothing about spiritual things…. Even if one skillfully says that the religious content is negligible, to the average person’s life there could be nothing more intimately related than this existential religion. We have no choice but to here and now go on record that no matter what happens we will never bow at a Shinto shrine! The reason we make this clear is that we may be silenced by those who say that we are disloyal and lack filial piety. We are prepared to take Article Twenty-eight of the Constitution, that guarantees religious freedom, as a shield and argue our case ad infinitum. If there is an infringement of freedom of religion in any part of the country I hope that you will notify us immediately. We are prepared to face persecution! If it is the Lord’s will, at any time we are completely ready to become a sacrifice. This is the attitude with which we work. (translation by Merwin 1983, p. 266) (Mullins 273)
Ten years after this strong statement against shrine worship, Nakada’s followers would become the “sacrifice”. According to Mark Mullins: Holiness members had refused to participate in jinja sanpai (shrine worship), and many kept their children from participating in shrine visits sponsored by the public schools. The Tokkõ also knew from a number of church publications that many Holiness leaders held essentially the same eschatological views as the sectarian groups that had already been investigated. While they refused to participate in Shrine visits, the Holiness leaders made every effort to express support for the emperor and (to my knowledge) never made any public statements against the war. As early as the third general assembly of the Holiness Church in 1932 (that is, almost a decade before it entered the Kyõdan), the church declared that it would protect and honor the central place of the emperor in obedience to the Scriptures (Romans 13). Almost a decade later (1941), at the first general meeting of block six (one section of the Holiness congregations that were incorporated into the Kyõdan), the service began with singing the national anthem, obeisance in the direction of the Imperial Palace, and silent prayer for those who had given their lives on the battlefield for the Emperor. On another occasion, the pastor leading a meeting of block six stopped the proceedings during a bombing raid by US planes and asked all those in attendance to pray for Japan’s victory and the safety of the emperor. These pastors were hardly political subversives, but their basic eschatological convictions nevertheless clashed with the claims of the state. In the end, a total of 131 Holiness clergy were arrested for violations of the Peace Preservation Law and abandoned by the Kyõdan in their time of trial. (Mullins 273-274)
Mullins indicates that 71 Holiness pastors were arrested and 14 were eventually sentenced. It was Nakada's belief in a literal thousand year reign of Christ that created the difficulties for the arrested Holiness members:Fujikawa Takurõ the lawyer for thirteen Holiness ministers, argued that the investigators of this case ... mistakenly assumed that all Holiness ministers followed the interpretation of Bishop Nakada, who in 1933 developed the position that the salvation of the Jews and earthly return and millennial reign of Christ were indispensable ingredients of a biblical eschatology. According to Fujikawa, it was the belief in a literal one thousand-year reign of Christ that was creating the conμict with the government. In the appeal, Fujikawa explained that the reference to the millennial reign of Christ appears in apocalyptic literature (Revelation 20:4) and should not be interpreted literally, as Nakada and some other groups had done. (Mullins 274)

When the Lion Feeds

When the Lion Feeds is the debut novel of Zambian writer Wilbur Smith. It introduces the Courtney family, whose adventures Smith would tell in many subsequent novels. In 2012 Smith said the novel remained his favourite because it was his first.
Plot.
The plot focuses around twin brothers, Sean and Garrick Courtney, and their lives in South Africa in the 19th century, including the Anglo-Zulu War and the Transvaal Gold Rush.
Background.
Smith was working as an accountant and had already written a novel "The Gods First Make Mad" but been unable to find a publisher. After the failure of his first marriage he tried again with a different story:
I wrote about my own father and my darling mother. I wove into the story chunks of early African history. I wrote about black people and white. I wrote about hunting and gold mining and carousing and women. I wrote about love and loving and hating. In short I wrote about all the things I knew well and loved better. I left out all the immature philosophies and radical politics and rebellious posturing that had been the backbone of the first novel. I even came up with a catching title, 'When the Lion Feeds'.
His agent in London, Ursula Winant, managed to sell the book to William Heinemann for an advance of two thousand pounds and an initial print run of ten thousand copies. The book went on to be successful, selling around the world (except in South Africa, where it was banned) and enabling Smith to leave his job and work full time. Charles Pick, who bought the book for Heinemann, later became Smith's agent.
The book was dedicated to Smith's father, whom the author idolised. "When I showed him he was a bit taken aback but Mum said that he always used to carry it around with him to show his mates,” said Smith.
The novel was banned in South Africa on the grounds of obscenity and blasphemy. Heinemann appealed this to the South African Supreme Court and succeeded in having the decision overturned. However this was reversed on appeal and the ban stayed.
Smith did not originally envision the Courtney family would become a series but he ended up continually returning to them in later novels.
Proposed Adaptation.
Stanley Baker bought the film rights and announced plans to make a movie version after "Zulu" (1963) but no film resulted.

Japanese destroyer Namikaze

History.
Construction of the large-sized "Minekaze"-class destroyers was authorized as part of the Imperial Japanese Navy's 8-4 Fleet Program from fiscal 1917 with nine vessels, and fiscal 1918 with an additional six vessels. However, the final three vessels in the fiscal 1918 were built to a different design and have a different enough silhouette that many authors consider them to be a separate class. "Namikaze", built at the Maizuru Naval Arsenal, was the second ship of this sub-class. It was laid down on November 7, 1921, launched on June 24, 1922 and commissioned on November 11, 1922.
On completion, "Namikaze" was teamed with sister ships , , and flagship at the Yokosuka Naval District to form Destroyer Division 1 (第一駆逐隊). In 1938-1939, the division was assigned to patrols of the northern and central China coastlines in support of Japanese combat operations in the Second Sino-Japanese War
World War II history.
At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, "Namikaze" was based at the Ōminato Guard District in northern Japan, and was assigned to patrols of the Hokkaidō and Chishima Islands coastlines. 
During the Battle of Midway in May 1942, "Namikaze" was assigned to the reserve force for the Aleutian Islands Operation, which did not leave Japanese waters. Afterwards, she returned to patrol and escort duties based out of Ōminato through July 1943, with its patrol area extended to include much of Honshū as far south as Ise Bay. In July she was assigned temporarily to the IJN 5th Fleet for the mission to evacuate surviving Japanese forces from Kiska, but only performed backup duties. She was slightly damaged in a collision with the coastal patrol vessel "Manei Maru No.7" at the entry to Otaru port, Hokkaidō on November 6, 1943. "Namikaze" continued to be based at Ōminato for patrol and escort in northern waters until December 1943.
In December 1943, "Namikaze" was reassigned to Moji on December 1 to escort convoys to French Indochina. She returned to Ōminato to resume the Hokkaidō-Chishima patrols from March 1944
On August 21, 1944, "Namikaze" was torpedoed by north of Iturup. Her stern severed, she was towed by "Kamikaze" to Otaru for emergency repairs. She was subsequently sent on to Maizuru Naval Arsenal for rebuilding into a carrier for "Kaiten" manned torpedo. 
This conversion involved removing three of her four main guns and all of the torpedo launchers. Her first boiler was also removed, reducing her output to and top speed to . Six Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Guns and eight 13 mm anti-aircraft guns were added. The stern was modified with a sloping deck, and two to four "Kaiten" could be carried.
After completion of the refit on February 1, 1945, "Namikaze" was assigned to the Combined Fleet, but there is no record of "Namikaze" actually launching "Kaiten" in battle. From June 16, 1945, "Namikaze" was based at Ube in the Inland Sea, and was used primarily as a minesweeper searching for mines dropped by B-29s. She was at Kure Naval Base at the time of the surrender of Japan.
On October 5, 1945, "Namikaze" was officially removed from navy list. However, after being demilitarized, she was pressed into service by the American occupation authorities for use as a repatriation ship, and continued in that role from December 1, 1945 until 1947 evacuating demilitarized Japanese soldiers and civilians from the Asian mainland.
Service with the Republic of China.
On October 3, 1947, ex-"Namikaze" was turned over to the Republic of China as a prize of war, and renamed Shen Yang. "Shen Yang" was based in Tsingtao from 1947 until the fall of that port city to communist forces in the Chinese Civil War. She continued to be used by the Republic of China Navy from bases in Taiwan until 1960, when she was finally scrapped.

Havenwoods State Forest

Havenwoods State Forest, a is a property managed by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources within the city limits of Milwaukee. The forest was created to provide an urban green space and environmental education center. 
The land includes grasslands, woods, wetlands, Lincoln Creek, an urban arboretum, and education gardens. The Environmental Awareness Center includes an auditorium, classrooms, displays, and a resource center. There are trails for nature study, hiking, biking, and cross-country skiing. Schoenecker Park abuts the property on the northeast.
Havenwoods is open from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily. A state park vehicle admission sticker is not required to use the park.
History.
Havenwoods is a triangle of land that has almost come full circle. In the early 19th century, the land was a swampy forest. Wild animals trekked though the tall trees, followed occasionally by Native Americans in search of food. 
In 1836, surveyors walked the land, measuring out a grid that opened this area to settlement. Early settlers included the Zautkes, Pipkorns, Douglases, Bourkes and Schalocks. Being farmers, they cut down the trees, drained the land, and planted crops. 
In the early 20th century, Milwaukee County began buying up farmland, needing a new location for its House of Correction, which opened in 1917. The prisoners tended crops, milked cows, and constructed furniture in the Granville Chair Factory. The inspector’s report from 1939 indicates the prison kitchen canned 5534 gallons of tomatoes, 1100 gallons of catsup, 1350 gallons of corn, 172 gallons of rhubarb, and much more that year.
In 1945, the US Army seized the House of Correction for use as an Army Disciplinary Barracks (USDB). The USDB housed soldiers, prisoners of war, and German-American internees. The prison buildings went out of use in the 1950s and were demolished in the 1970s.
In 1956, the Army constructed a Project Nike Ajax missile base at Havenwoods. Altogether, the Army built eight Nike sites, encircling Milwaukee, to protect the city from long-range bombers. By 1958, the Ajax missile was obsolete. The site at Havenwoods was abandoned in 1963.
From about 1950 to 1967, the U.S. Army Reserve used Havenwoods as a training facility. The 84th Division is still located south of Havenwoods on Silver Spring Drive. The city also used parts of the land as a landfill (1958–1970), and homeless families took up residence in the abandoned buildings (1969–1971). 
In 1974, the Army decided it no longer needed the land or buildings and declared them surplus. For the first time in 130 years, this parcel of land on the northwest side of Milwaukee lay abandoned. The prison buildings, underground tunnels, Nike missile site, and wild grasslands became open to the public.

Wildwood Amusement Park

Wildwood Amusement Park was an amusement and picnic park that existed between 1910 and 1911 on the southeast shore of White Bear Lake in Mahtomedi, Minnesota.
The Park was built and operated by Minneapolis and St. Paul Suburban Railroad Company (a subdivision of the Twin City Rapid Transit Company), who ran a streetcar line from Mahtomedi to nearby St. Paul. It was the sister Park of Big Island Amusement Park on Lake Minnetonka as both were intended to draw crowds of people to opposite ends of the Minneapolis-St. Paul streetcar system on the weekends.
Wildwood Amusement Park proved to be more successful than Big Island Amusement Park (which closed in 1911); it operated until 1932 when it was closed due to financial hardship.

History of Valdivia

Valdivia is one of the few cities in southern Chile with a more less contineous and well documented history from its foundation in the 16th century onwards.
Prehispanic times (12,000 B.P.-1543).
The site of Valdivia may have been populated since 12,000 – 11,800 B.P according to archaeological discoveries in Monte Verde (less than 200 km south of Valdivia), which would place it about a thousand years before the Clovis culture in North America. This have challenged the models of migration to the New World and it is possible that the first inhabitants of Valdivia and Chile travelled to America by watercraft and not across a land-bridge in the Bering Strait. 
By the time of the arrival of the Spanish conquistadores, Valdivia was inhabited by Huilliches (Mapudungun for "People of the South"). Huilliches and Mapuches were both referred by the Spaniards as "Araucanos". Their main language was a variant of Mapudungun, the Mapuche language. 
There was a large village called "Ainil" in present day downtown Valdivia, and the Valdivia River was called "Ainilebu". "Ainil" seemed to have been an important trade center due to its ease of access to the sea and the interior using the river network of the Cruces and Calle-Calle Rivers, both tributaries of the Valdivia. "Ainil" may be described as ""a kind of little Venice"" as it had large areas of wetlands and canals, most of them drained or filled nowadays. The market in "Ainil" received shellfish and fish from the coast, legumes from Punucapa, and other foods from San José de la Mariquina; an agricultural zone north east of Valdivia. Remains of this ancient trade is the modern "Feria Fluvial" (English: Riverside Market) on the banks of Valdivia River. The surroundings of Valdivia were described as large plains having a large population that cultivated potatoes, maize, quinoa and legumes among other crops. The population have been estimated by some historians as 30-40 thousand inhabitants as of 1548 based on descriptions made by the conquistadors. Pedro Mariño de Lobera, an early conquistador and historian wrote that there were half a million Indians living within ten leagues (one league is roughly 4.2 km) from the city. Other historians consider these numbers too high and argue that early Spaniards usually exaggerated in their descriptions. 
Later Charles Darwin would state that ""there is not much cleared land near Valdivia"" which suggests that pre-Hispanic agriculture in Valdivia was far more extensive than the agriculture practiced in the early 19th century.
Spanish colony (1544-1810).
The first European to visit Valdivia River's estuary was the Genoese captain Juan Bautista Pastene, who took possession of it in 1544 in the name of the Spanish king, Carlos I. He named the river after the Governor of Chile Pedro de Valdivia.
Pedro de Valdivia later traveled by land to the river described by Pastene, and founded the city of Valdivia in 1552 as "Santa María la Blanca de Valdivia". It was the southernmost Spanish settlement in the Americas at the time of the founding. Following the establishment of the church of "Santa María la Blanca" in Valdivia, more buildings were constructed, so many that it was considered ""the second city in the Kingdom of Chile"". 
After Pedro de Valdivia's death, the war with the Mapuches, called the War of Arauco, continued as the Spanish made many attempts to defeat the Mapuche and defend the cities and forts built on their territory. On March 17 of 1575 the city was damaged by an earthquake similar to the Great Chilean Earthquake of 1960. Until 1575 the Huilliches of Valdivia had not made any notable resistance against their new rulers. They had even fought as Indios amigos with the Spanish against the northern Mapucuhes in the Arauco War. But that year 4,000 Indians that had been fighting in Martín Ruiz de Gamboa's army rebelled when they returned to the surroundings of Valdivia.
After the demoralising Battle of Curalaba in 1598, in which an entire Spanish army was defeated and the Mapuches killed the governor, the Mapuches and Huilliches made a mass rebellion. The Indians proceeded to destroy all the Spanish settlements and forts in their lands, in what came to be known as the "Destruction of the Seven Cities". On 24 November 1599 Huilliches destroyed and plundered Valdivia. The border of the Spanish Empire shifted north of the Bío-Bío River, while the later refounded city of Valdivia remained a Spanish enclave surrounded by native Huilliche territory, and along with the island of Chiloé, continued to be the southernmost colonies of the Empire. 
Eleven days after the first destruction of Valdivia, a group of 270 Spanish soldiers arrived from Perú. The commander of the troops, colonel Francisco del Campo was convinced that the city of Valdivia needed to be repopulated. After Francisco del Campo's expedition left, the Dutch corsair Sebastian de Cordes occupied the site of Valdivia for some months, giving the Dutch government information about this abandoned part of the Spanish Empire. The Spaniards returned on 13 March 1602, when captain Francisco Hernández Ortiz established a fort on the ruins of the city. On September 24 natives attacked the fort unsuccessfully, but laid siege. The Spaniards could not acquire food or supplies, and on 3 February 1604 abandoned the fort, with the last starving survivors rescued by ship.
The Dutch governor of the East Indies Hendrik Brouwer, learned about the situation in Valdivia, and decided to establish a base there for further attacks against the Viceroy of Peru. This plan was well accepted as the Netherlands was at war with Spain. The Dutch had previously taken the North of Brazil from the Spanish-Portuguese crown, and the idea of creating a South American empire was attractive. In spite of his advanced age, Hendrik Brouwer left his post as governor in the East Indies to personally lead the expedition. The Dutch fleet destroyed the Fort of Carelmapu and the city of Castro before arriving at Corral Bay at the mouth of the Valdivia River. Hendrik Brouwer died the 7th of August in Puerto Inglés while waiting for spring to sail north to Valdivia. John Maurice of Nassau while in charge of the Dutch part of Brazil had equipped the expedition and had secretly appointed Elias Herckman as commander if Brouwer died. Herckman finally occupied the ruins of Valdivia in 1643. The Dutch did not find the gold mines they expected and the hostility of the natives forced them to leave on 28 October 1643. 
Pedro Álvarez de Toledo y Leiva Viceroy of Peru (1639–1648) knew of the strategic importance of Valdivia and decided to repopulate and fortify it once for all. He financed partly the expedition to repopulate Valdivia with his own capital. The contingent in charge of the mission was organized in Peru and consisted of seventeen ships filled with building materials and supplies that astounded contemporaries by its magnitude.] The local government of Chile could not secure Valdivia as it was engaged in continuous war with the Mapuches and was deeply dependent on the Real Situado, an annual payment of silver from Potosí to finance the army of Chile. The Valdivia enclave was placed directly under the control of the Viceroyalty of Peru that administered Valdivia from its repopulation in 1645 until 1740. Corral, located on the river entrance to Valdivia, became one of the most fortified bay at the time, with 17 forts. During this time it was several times proposed to move the city of Valdivia to Mancera Island. Valdivia's original site, downtown of modern Valdivia was repopulated in 1684. 
From the 18th century onwards Valdivia was used as a base for colonization of southern Chile. This was partly fueled by rumours about a fabulous city called Trapananda, Lin Lin or City of the Caesars (Spanish: "Ciudad de los Césares") that was situated in the unexplored lands of Patagonia. An expedition from Valdivia searching this city founded Río Bueno in 1777. In 1784 the Governors of Chile and Chiloé were ordered to establish a Camino Real from Valdivia to Chacao Channel in order to connect Ancud with Valdivia by a land road. This led to the celebration of the treaty of "Río Bueno" with local Huilliches in 1789. But by 1792 the Huilleches rebelled and planned to assault Valdivia. In 1793 the Parliament of "Las Canoas" was arranged. This treaty allowed the Spanish to build the road and repopulate Osorno in 1796. Osorno had previously been destroyed in 1602. With the "Parliament of Las Canoas" the local Huilliches became subjects of the Spanish Crown but were allowed to retain their lands and social structure. They were also meant to defend the land against Spain's enemies and the Spanish to defend them from hostile tribes. By the same time Huilliche lands around Valdivia were slowly overtaken by mestizos and nearby Indians became "reduced" (Spanish: "reducidos") it means "pacified" by a combination of military force and conversion into Christianity. The territories north of Valdivia were not totally incorporated into the Chilean state until the 1880s when the Chilean army overwhelmed the indigenous resistance during the occupation of the Araucanía.
Independence and growth (1811-1959).
Self-governing juntas appeared in Spanish America and Spain after Napoleon occupied Spain and held the Spanish king Fernando VII captive. Many juntas, as was the case of Chile, declared plans to rule their territory in the absence of the legitimate king. At the time of the first governing junta of Chile in 1810 the Valdivian governor, an Irishman, Albert Alexander Eagar, led the celebration of what was seen as an affirmation of the legitimacy of the Spanish king. However, Valdivian independentists, such as Camilo Henríquez, saw an opportunity to gain absolute independence from Spain, organized a coup on 1 November 1811, and joined other Chilean cities that were already revolting against the old order. Four months after the coup, on 16 March 1812 a counterrevolutionary coup took control of the city and created a War Council. The War Council broke trade relations with the rest of Chile and confirmed Valdivia's loyalty to the Spanish government.
Even after several defeats of the Spanish troops during the Chilean Independence War, Valdivia and Chiloé remained loyal to the Spanish King. By 1820 the newly created Chilean Navy, commanded by Lord Cochrane, captured Valdivia, but failed to liberate Chiloé. Cochrane's land-based attack took the Spanish by surprise, avoiding a direct confrontation with the highly-defended forts at the entrance to the Valdivia River. When loyal troops in Valdivia heard the news about the fall of Corral they sacked the city and fled south to reinforce Chiloé, passing by Osorno.
Chilean Supreme Director, and Libertador, Bernardo O'Higgins founded the city of La Unión south of Valdivia in 1821, to secure the way to Osorno, city that had been repopulated in 1796 by his father Ambrosio O'Higgins. Valdivia had been a province of the General Captaincy of Chile and was in 1826 incorporated as one of the eight provinces of Chile.
On February 20, 1835, Valdivia was affected by the worst earthquake in the area in several decades, event witnessed by Charles Darwin. He also stated that ""there is not much cleared land near Valdivia"" which contrasted with the description made by early Spaniards of large fields and extensive croplands. 
The expansion and economic development of the city were limited in the early 19th century. To jump-start economic development, the Chilean government initiated a highly focused immigration program under Bernhard Eunom Philippi and later Vicente Pérez Rosales as government agents. Through this program, thousands of Germans settled in the area, incorporating then-modern technology and know-how to develop agriculture and industry. While immigrants that arrived to the Llanquihue area where often poor farmers, Valdivia received more educated immigrants, including political exiles and merchants. Some of the immigrants that arrived in Valdivia established workshops and built new industries. One of the most famous immigrants was Carlos Anwandter, an exile from Luckenwalde who arrived to Valdivia in 1850 and in 1858 founded Chile's first German school. Other Germans left the city and became settlers, drawn by the promise of free land. They were often given forested land, which they cleared to turn into farms. Native Mapuche and Huilliche either sold their land or were pushed into reservations. The Osorno department of Valdivia Province was moved to Llanquihue Province (created in 1853) as consequence of German immigration to the Llaquihue area.
Valdivia prospered with industries, including shipyards, the Hoffmann gristmill, the Rudloff shoe factory, the Anwandter beer company and many more. The steel mills of Corral were the largest recorded private investment in Chile at the time, and were the first steel mills in South America. In 1891 Valdivia became a commune according to a law that created such subdivisions. After the Malleco Viaduct was built in 1890 the railroads advanced further south, reaching Valdivia in 1895. The first passenger train arrived in 1899. In 1909 a fire destroyed 18 city blocks in downtown Valdivia, which were rebuilt with modern concrete buildings. By 1911 lumber production, from clearing native forests, became the most important industry. Cattle-raising was a growing industry, and wheat was grown on the cleared lands. Lumber, cattle, leather, flour and beer were exported. In 1895 the city's population was of 8,062 inhabitants and was estimated in 9,704 as of 1902. 
The prosperity of Valdivia continued throughout the first half of the 20th Century. In 1917 the first "Valdivian Week" (Spanish: "Semana Valdiviana") was celebrated. Chile's oldest beauty content, "Queen of The Rivers" (Spanish: "Reina de Los Ríos") began the same year. The city evolved as an early tourist center in Chile, while popular songs that named Valdivia and the Calle-Calle River made it better known in Chilean popular culture. The Pedro de Valdivia Bridge crossing the Valdivia River was built in 1954. Valdivia came to be one of the most important industrial centre in Chile together with the capital Santiago and the main port city, Valparaíso.
Great Chilean Earthquake and Valdivia in Los Lagos Region (1960-2006).
On May 22, 1960, south-central Chile suffered the most powerful earthquake ever recorded, rating 9.5 on the Moment magnitude scale, with Valdivia being the most affected city. The earthquake generated devastating tsunamis that affected Japan and Hawaii. Spanish-colonial forts around Valdivia were severely damaged, while soil subsidence destroyed buildings, deepened local rivers, and created wetlands of the Río Cruces y Chorocomayo - a new aquatic park north of the city.
Large sections of the city flooded after the earthquake, and a landslide near the Tralcan Mount dammed the Riñihue Lake. Water levels in Lake Riñihue rose more than 20 meters, raising the danger of a catastrophic break and of destroying everything downriver. Government authorities drew plans for evacuating the city, but many people left on their own. Danger to the city was reduced after a large team of workers was able to open a drainage channel in the landslide, allowing water levels of the lake to slowly reduce to normal levels. There is evidence that a similar landslide and earthquake happened in 1575.
After the Great Chilean Earthquake Valdivia's economy and political status declined. Much of the city was destroyed and many inhabitants left. By 1974, the military junta reorganized the political divisions of Chile and declared Valdivia a province of the Los Lagos Region with Puerto Montt as the regional capital. Many Valdivians resented the decision, and felt theirs should have been the legitimate regional capital—while Valdivia was founded in 1552, and had resisted pirate attacks, hostile natives and several earthquakes, Puerto Montt was a relatively new city founded only in 1853 (three hundred and one years later).
Since the liberalization of the economy in Chile in the 80s the forestry sector in Valdivia boomed, first by exporting wood chips to Japan from Corral and then by producing woodpulp in Mariquina (25 km northeast of Valdivia). This led to deforestation and substitution of native Valdivian temperate rainforests to plant pines and eucalyptus, but also created new jobs for people with limited education. Valdivia also benefitted from the development of salmon aquaculture in the 90s, but to a much lesser extent than places such as Puerto Montt and Chiloé.

Greenwich Savings Bank

The Greenwich Savings Bank was an American savings bank based in New York City that operated from 1833 to 1981. At the time of its closure in 1981, it was the 16th largest bank in the U.S. by total deposits.
History.
The Greenwich Savings Bank was chartered in 1833 in New York City. At its height, it had branches in New York City, Nassau County and Suffolk County with $2.1 billion in assets. 
By the time of bank deregulation in 1980, the bank started having big losses. In 1981, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the New York State Banking Department sought buyers for the bank. In October of that year, a participant in a meeting about possible buyers left material on the meeting table. This information was given to "The New York Times", which printed the story.
In its final three days the bank lost $500 million in deposits out of its total of $1.5 billion due to a run on the bank. At the end of the third day the New York State Banking Department closed the bank, naming the FDIC as receiver. That same day Metropolitan Savings Bank of Brooklyn (now part of HSBC Bank USA) was named the new owner of the bank accounts.
Headquarters building.
In 1922-24, the bank constructed its new headquarters at the intersection of Broadway and West 36th Street in Midtown Manhattan. The steel-reinforced limestone and sandstone building was designed by noted bank architects York and Sawyer in a Classical Revival style with monumental Corinthian columns on three sides of the building, rusticated walls and a Roman-style dome.
The interior was embellished with ten-foot-tall brass foyer doors, a board room and executive office with rubbed-oak paneling and soapstone fireplaces, and an elliptical banking room with limestone Corinthian columns, granite walls, a marble floor, a bronze tellers' screen with sculptures of Minerva (symbolizing wisdom) and Mercury (representing commerce), and a coffered, domed ceiling with a stained-glass skylight.
Haier America purchased the building in 2000 to be its American corporate headquarters. In 2002, Haier rechristened it The Haier Building.
An event management company leases several of the Haier Building's large historic rooms, which are operated as the venue Gotham Hall. The old main banking room, board room and executive office are rented out as the "Grand Ballroom", "Oak Room", and "Green Room", for corporate events, private parties such as weddings and receptions, and other functions.
Both the exterior and the first floor interior of the building were designated New York City landmarks in 1992, and the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.
In popular culture.
In the 2008 remake of "The Day the Earth Stood Still", the coordinates for the "Impact Location" that appears on the big screen (Lat 40.75136, Long -73.98712) falls on the The Haier Building. It is unknown if the writers intended to choose this location on purpose. The film "Going in Style" starring George Burns and Art Carney also used this location in the scene where they robbed a bank.
In season 21 of "The Amazing Race", Gotham Hall was the finish line.

FC Augsburg II

The FC Augsburg II is the reserve team of the German association football club FC Augsburg from the city of Augsburg, Bavaria, whose first team play in the Fußball-Bundesliga.
The team, which has never played above the fourth tier, had its greatest success in 1977, when it won the local Schwaben Cup, qualified for the German Cup and reached the third round of the competition, going out to Hertha BSC Berlin.
The side plays as an under-23 team.
History.
The club's reserve side can trace its roots back to the pre-merger BC Augsburg Amateure, which had its greatest success when it played for a season in the southern division of the Amateurliga Bayern in 1962–63. A sixth place there allowed the side to qualify for the unified Bavarian league the following year but, along with the decline of the senior team, the reserve side got relegated too, finishing 17th.
In the post-merger era, the team disappeared into the lower amateur leagues after that but returned to the Landesliga Bayern-Süd in 1976, finishing runners-up in the league in its first season, now as FC Augsburg Amateure. By 1978 however, the side was relegated again, not to return to this level for a quarter of a decade. It did however take out the Schwaben Cup in 1977 and qualified for the first round of the 1977–78 German Cup. After away victories over second division side Arminia Hannover and fellow amateur club 1. FC Normannia Gmünd in the first two rounds, the team reached the third round, where it lost 0–4 to Hertha BSC Berlin. Incidentally, the senior team was knocked out in the same round, too, losing to TSV 1860 München.
After becoming a founding member of the Bezirksoberliga Schwaben in 1988, the team was withdrawn at the end of the season, disbanded altogether and not reformed for more than a decade.
After 2004 the side once more played in the Landesliga Bayern-Süd again, generally achieving good results but not managing another promotion, with a second place in 2012 as its best result. The team was one of two clubs in the league to apply for a licence in the new tier four Regionalliga Bayern. Taking part in the promotion play-off, FCA II advance past Bayernliga clubs SB/DJK Rosenheim and FC Schweinfurt 05 to play in the Regionalliga from 2012. The club was thereby also able to win promotion from the sixth tier to the fourth without playing in the fifth.
In the 2012–13 season the club had to struggle against relegation all season and beyond, having to defend its league place in the relegation round with the Bayernliga runners-up. In a two-leg play-off against BC Aichach FCA II defended its league place with an aggregate score of 5–2.

Joe Egan (rugby league)

Joe Egan (1919-2012) was an English professional rugby league footballer of the 1930s, '40s and '50s, and coach of the 1950s and '60s, playing at representative level for Great Britain, and England, and at club level for Wigan from 1938 to 1950, and Leigh, as a , or , i.e. number 9, or, 11 or 12, during the era of contested scrums. Egan is a Wigan Hall of Fame inductee, and was a life member at Wigan.
Playing career.
Wigan.
Egan played at hooker for a Rugby League XIII against Northern Command XIII at Thrum Hall, Halifax on Saturday 21 March 1942. In the 1948 Challenge Cup final Wigan defeated Bradford Northern 8-3 and Egan was the first captain to receive the trophy from a reigning monarch, King George VI. On the same day former prop forward with Egan on the indomitables tour Frank Whitcombe of Bradford Northern, was the first man to win the Lance Todd trophy on the losing side. Joe Egan, Frank Whitcombe & Ken Gee formed a formidable front row in the first two test which the Australians feared on the tour to Australia in 1946, he later became the oldest surviving member. He also won two Championships with Wigan, in 1946 and 1947. He accompanied the Great Britain test team as hooker on their tour of Australia in 1946 and 1948.
Leigh.
Egan joined Leigh for a record £5,000 fee in October 1950 and succeeded Emlyn Jenkins as player / coach. Leigh finished 4th in the league in his first season. In Egan's second season, Leigh made it to the Lancashire Cup Final and a Challenge Cup semi-final as well as finishing 7th. On Saturday 27 October 1951, 33,230 spectators saw Leigh lose 14-6 to Wigan in the final of the Lancashire Cup at Station Road, Swinton. They repeated that league placing a year later, this time helping the Centurions win the Lancashire Cup in front of a crowd of 34,785 at Swinton. An injury to Egan saw him sit out the entire 1953-54 season and his absence hit hard with Leigh finishing well down the table in 13th and interest in cup competitions also finished early. He tried to make a playing comeback the following season but was forced to retire, although once more the club enjoyed runs in the cup competitions, losing to Barrow in the Lancashire Cup semi-final and then getting knocked out of the Challenge Cup by Featherstone. He retired with the most appearances of any player for the England national team with 21.
Post playing.
Egan remained with the Leigh club purely as coach and the team was once again successful in his final season, finishing 11th but winning the Lancashire Cup for a second time with a resounding 26-9 success over Widnes. Egan later became coach of Wigan, taking them to championship success in the 1959–60 season and Challenge Cup finals in 1958, '59 and '61. Egan later coached the Warrington club. After a disastrous start to the 1970–71 season, coach Joe Egan decided to stand down. He was replaced by Peter Harvey.
Egan died on 11 November 2012, aged 93.

USS Lyndonia (SP-734)

USS "Lyndonia" (SP-734), later known as USS "Vega" (SP-734) was a yacht acquired by the U.S. Navy during World War I. She was assigned as an armed patrol craft, but, at times, performed other duties along the U.S. East Coast, such as dispatch boat and training ship for the U.S. Naval Academy. Post-war, she was disposed of through sale to the public.
Constructed in New York.
"Lyndonia" -- a steel-hulled, steam yacht designed by Charles L. Seabury and built in 1907 at Morris Heights, New York, by the Gas Engine and Power Co. and the Charles Seabury Co. -- was acquired by the Navy from the noted Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, publisher Cyrus H. K. Curtis on 5 September 1917. Designated SP-734 and converted for Navy use at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, the former yacht was placed in commission on 4 December 1917, Lt. Comdr. John J. McCracken in command.
World War I service.
Start-up problems.
"Lyndonia" departed Philadelphia on 22 December bound for Bermuda in company with "Venetia" (SP-431) and tugs "Gypsum Queen" (SP-430) and "Montauk" (SP-1213). At 1020 the following day, "Lyndonia" blew two tubes in her forward boiler; at 1800, all tubes in the after boiler blew as well. As the ship slowly lost steam, she signaled "Venetia" of her plight. Accordingly, at 1820, "Montauk" passed a hawser to "Lyndonia" and took her in tow. On Christmas Day, while en route to the Virginia Capes, the remaining boiler tubes blew, leaving the ship without any steam whatever.
As if losing steam were not enough, 10 minutes later, the hawser parted, leaving "Lyndonia" adrift for nearly 20 minutes before she was again taken in tow. Subsequently, "Joseph F. Bellows" (SP-323) pulled "Lyndonia" to the Norfolk Navy Yard where the yacht then underwent repairs in drydock.
Ice blocks passage.
"Lyndonia" got underway on 4 February for New London, Connecticut, and arrived off the Delaware Capes the following day, only to encounter heavy ice floes which blocked further passage. She accordingly returned to Norfolk, Virginia, and remained there into the spring, serving as dispatch and mail boat in the Chesapeake Bay. During this tour of duty, on 20 February, the ship was renamed "Vega".
On 22 April, "Vega" sailed for Philadelphia. Arriving there the following day, she was attached to the 4th Naval District and based at Cold Spring Inlet, near Cape May, New Jersey, for patrols off the New Jersey coast.
Friendly fire on a neutral ship.
On 25 June, "Vega" sighted a ship resembling a surfaced submarine at long range. Going to general quarters, "Vega" altered course to close the unidentified craft and flashed recognition signals and challenges in Morse code. The ship would not respond, however, and "Vega" opened fire with her 6-pounder forward -- firing six quick shots before the target hove to. Upon closer investigation, the unidentified ship turned out to be "SS Skandeborg", a Danish merchantman bound from Cuba to New York City with a general cargo -- mostly sugar. No member of the Danish vessel's crew knew Morse code -- hence her seeming reluctance to reply to "Vega's" challenges!
The warship continued her operations out of Cold Spring Inlet into the fall of 1918. During this period, she also undertook local escort duties.
Assigned as training ship.
On 28 October, following repairs at the New York Navy Yard, "Vega" sailed south to Annapolis, Maryland, where she arrived three days later to commence duties as a training ship for midshipmen at the U.S. Naval Academy. She remained in the Annapolis vicinity from 1 November to 4 December before she got underway for Pensacola, Florida, on 5 December.
Reaching Pensacola three days before Christmas, 1918, "Vega" conducted local operations out of Pensacola until 22 March 1919, when she got underway for Philadelphia. 
Post-war disposition.
The yacht remained at the Philadelphia Navy Yard through the spring and summer months, and was decommissioned on Friday, 13 September 1919. She was subsequently sold to Charles H. Crocker, of San Francisco, California, on 20 December 1921. Meanwhile, in 1920, Curtis had a new ship built named Lyndonia after his home estate with that ship, one of the great yachts of its era, also seeing Army and Navy service in World War II.

Macmillan Publishers (United States)

Macmillan Publishers USA was the former name of a now mostly defunct American publishing company. Once the American division of the British Macmillan Publishers, remnants of the original American Macmillan are present in McGraw-Hill's Macmillan/McGraw-Hill textbooks and Gale's Macmillan Reference USA division. The German publisher Holtzbrinck, which bought Macmillan UK in 1999, purchased most US rights to the name in 2001 and rebranded its American division with it in 2007.
History.
Brett family.
George Edward Brett opened the first Macmillan office in the United States in 1869 and Macmillan sold its U.S. operations to the Brett family, George Platt Brett, Sr. and George Platt Brett Jr. in 1896, resulting in the creation of an American company, Macmillan Publishing. Even with the split of the American company from its parent company in Britain, George Brett Jr. and Harold MacMillan remained close personal friends. 
George P. Brett Jr. made the following comments in a letter dated 23 January 1947 to Daniel Macmillan about his family's devotion to the American publishing industry:
For the record my grandfather was employed by Macmillan's of England as a salesman. He came to the United States with his family in the service of Macmillan's of England and built up a business of approximately $50,000 before he died. He was succeeded . . . by my father, who eventually incorporated The Macmillan Company of New York and built up business of about $9,000,000. I succeeded my father, and we currently doing a business of approximately $12,000,000. So then, the name of Brett and the name of Macmillan have been and are synonymous in the United States.
Under the leadership of the Brett family, MacMillan served as the publisher of American authors, Winston Churchill
, Margaret Mitchell, who wrote "Gone with the Wind", and Jack London, author of "White Fang" and "Call of the Wild". 
The Bretts remained in control of the American offices of Macmillan from its creation in 1869 to the early 1960s, "a span matched by few other families in the history of United States business."
Mergers and end.
Through its merger with Crowell Collier in 1961 and other acquisitions (notably The Scribner Book Companies in 1984), the U.S. publisher became a media giant in its own right, as Macmillan, Inc. It was acquired by the controversial British tycoon Robert Maxwell in 1989 and eventually sold to Simon & Schuster in 1994 (at the time, Viacom had just purchased S&S, it is now owned by CBS Corporation) in the wake of Maxwell's death (1991) and the subsequent bankruptcy proceedings. Macmillan Publishing USA became the name of Simon & Schuster's reference division. Pearson acquired the Macmillan name in America since 1998, following its purchase of the Simon & Schuster educational and professional group (which included various Macmillan properties). Pearson sold the Macmillan Reference USA division (which included Scribner Reference) to Thomson Gale in 1999.
Holtzbrinck.
Holtzbrinck purchased most of the rights to the Macmillan name from Pearson in 2001, but not any of the businesses then associated with it. Holtzbrinck rebranded its US division with the name in 2007. However, McGraw-Hill continues to market its pre-kindergarten through elementary school titles under its Macmillan/McGraw-Hill brand.

<doc id="18433240" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18433240" title="7th Legion">
7th Legion

7th Legion is a real-time strategy computer game for Microsoft Windows, developed by Vision and Epic MegaGames and published by MicroProse in 1997. The game consists of two single-player campaigns and supports multiplayer online games. On February 18, 2014, Tommo Inc. re-released the game on GOG.com, but without multiplayer.
In-Game Background.
The conflict in 7th Legion takes place in the future, stemming from rampant overpopulation and reckless consumption and pollution of Earth's precious natural resources, the many industrial phases of Humanity ravaging the planet's ecosystem to a critical point. As scientists broadcast dire warnings of impending doom, the governments of Earth enact the PEP - "Planetary Evacuation Program" - to safely get everyone off-world in vast colony ships, leaving the planet to heal.
Unfortunately, there was never going to be enough room for the entire population, and, even though a lottery was devised to see who would be fortunate enough to escape the mass famine and chaos that were to follow the exodus, slaughtering thousands, it quickly became apparent that only the most worthy specimens of the human race - the smart, powerful and rich - were chosen and allowed to get a berth on one of the ships, preparing their jump into Hyperspace.
In the centuries following the evacuation, much of Earth's population perished, with the survivors, the scattered tribes of those left behind, forming themselves into 7 "Legions", all vying for control of what was left - and for a post-exodus civilization, their technology seems advanced enough to warrant walker mechs and "Priests" - cybernetic soldiers given "divine" power. Events of centuries ago and the PEP cloud into myth and legend - the most well-known one tells of the "Returning", a time of war, when the "Chosen" come back to claim the Earth, in three signs signalling their return: the "Night without Darkness", the "Day without Light" and the "Rain of Fire".
As the game begins, the 7th Generation of the Chosen - those descended from the evacuees - have indeed returned and are ready to make war on the descendants of those left behind who have united to face this most terrible foe and keep the Earth they have righteously inherited, all under the banner of the most powerful of all Legions: the 7th Legion (hence the game's title).
Gameplay.
The game keeps true to most other videogames of its genre, that is, putting the player in control of a number of soldiers. During the game players assume the role of a commander of either the Chosen or those that were left behind, with the overall objective being to annihilate the other. To do so, the player have to amass funds to construct various buildings and produce tanks and various war-machines whilst also recruiting foot-soldiers to combat the enemy.
Each player is also able to collect special "power-ups" that would be found in boxes that randomly dotted the landscape. These would provide bonuses to the force who collected the box. These bonuses might include making the player's forces invisible to the enemy or more powerful and thus harder to defeat.
What made 7th Legion truly unique, however, was that the player (and his opponent) could take advantage of special "power cards." These cards, each being different from each other, had effects on the game in some way. Some cards would destroy the opponents soldiers, or at least badly damage them, whilst others would cause mechanical troops to behave in a way that wasn't intended, often leading the opponents' machines in the wrong direction or not doing what was required of them.

Vision of Peace (Indian God of Peace)

The Vision of Peace is a statue in the three-story memorial concourse lobby along the Fourth Street entrance of the Saint Paul City Hall and Ramsey County Courthouse in Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States. The memorial to Minnesota 20th-century war dead was created by Swedish sculptor Carl Milles. He drew on memories of a Native American ceremony he witnessed in Ponca City, Oklahoma, when he designed the statue, "Indian God of Peace". Although there is no connection between Native American spirituality and his own vision, Milles depicted five Native Americans seated around a fire and holding their sacred pipes. Emerging from the smoke of those pipes is a “god of peace” which Milles imagined speaking to “all the world.”
The statue was unveiled on May 28, 1936 as the "Indian God of Peace". Originally there were 340 names to commemorate those who died in World War I. In 1988 the VFW started a funding campaign to add names of Minnesota soldiers who died in combat from other wars such as World War II, Korean War and the Vietnam War. There are 1,578 names engraved of those lost to war. It was later renamed "Vision of Peace" in 1994 at a special community ceremony involving three major Minnesota Native American tribes.
The statue weighs approximately 60 tons, stands 38 feet high, and was carved from creamy white Mexican onyx using Milles’ full-scale model. The statue sits on a revolving base which turns the figure 132 degrees every 2.5 hours. There are 98 sections fastened to a steel I-beam and supported by three-quarter inch bronze ribs.

Damatria

Damatria is a village on Greek island of Rhodes, located on the west coast, about 20 km far from the capital. It's a part of the Municipality of Petaloudes. It has a population of only 489 people. Damatria is believed to be the only village of Rhodes dating back to the Dorian era in the 11th century B.C. Excavations in the surrounding area have confirmed continuous habitation for over 3,000 years. Historians believe this ancient settlement was actually named after the sanctuary of the Goddess Dimitra that had been built in the area.Most of the settlement is typically traditional, bar a few exceptions of scattered modern, multi-level homes that belong to prosperous Damatrians who prefer to continue living in their village of birth. A few natural springs dotted here and there, a Second World War memorial in the form of the Italian headquarters, some historic churches and quite a number of ancient ruins and sites, complete the list of attractions to this green and fertile village.

<doc id="18433437" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18433437" title="University counseling center">
University counseling center

A university counseling center (UCC) provides mental health and other services within a university or college environment. The need for these services is on the rise. Counseling center directors and other student affairs personnel have reported an increase in the mental health needs of college students, with issues like eating disorders, alcohol and drug abuse/dependence, severe depression/anxiety, suicidality, and sexual assault becoming more prevalent in this environment. Among Big Ten Conference universities, directors report a 42% increase in the number of students seen at their counseling centers. In a summary of recent survey data, Duenwald also reports that the use of psychiatric medication has increased almost 10% among college students since the year 2000. May (2003) finds that a UCC will typically work with 15-20% of students at colleges and 8-12% at a university. Given these numbers, May recommends 1 counselor per 600 students in colleges and a 1:1000 ratio in universities with an average of 5 to 6 sessions per student. 
UCCs generally offer a variety of services including individual and group counseling, psychodiagnostic testing, alcohol and other drug counseling/evaluation, crisis assistance, campus outreach programs, consultation services, and graduate student training. Though services primarily target mental health problems (i.e., anxiety, depression), students also utilize counseling services to enhance areas of their life, including relationships, career/vocational choices, academic and athletic performance, and exploring psychological strengths. Lehigh University Counseling and Psychological Services (UCPS) is an example of a university counseling center. 
Another example of a university counseling center is the University of California, Irvine Counseling Center. In addition to the services mentioned above, the center also offers Peer Programs. Peer Programs offered by the UCI Counseling Center include C.O.A.C.H, The Peer Educator Program, and the LGBTQ Mentorship Program. In these programs, students receive services not from licensed health professionals, but from other students at UCI who have assumed these helping roles. This is a different approach to counseling for students who find more comfort in speaking with fellow peers who they can more easily relate with. Each program has a different focus, whether it be group-based, individual-based, or special needs-based; but all have the same goal—to promote student mental health and well-being in all aspects of life.
History.
Early to mid 1940's: University counseling centers began formal operations, responding to the increasing educational and vocational needs of returning veterans of World War II.
1950: The Association of College Counseling Center Directors (AUCCCD) was established in 1950 by a group of mid-western college and university counseling directors. Dr. Ralph Birdie, director of the Student Counseling Bureau at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis hosted the first conference on the UM campus. Annual meetings were hosted throughout the 1950s by several universities including the University of Illinois, Michigan State, The Ohio State University, State University of Iowa, University of Missouri, and the University of Minnesota . In the early days, the organization was referred to as the Annual Conference of College and University Counseling Directors. Conference attendance was based on invitation from participants a nd grew over time as directors around the country developed collegial relationships with each other. Initially membership was primarily drawn from mid-western institutions, but eventually the annual conference became a national affiliation of directors.
Following World War II, counseling centers were established in response to the educational and vocational needs of returning veterans. Directors were pioneering the development of organized counseling units and recognized their need to "talk shop" - to exchange information with each other and to develop a practical knowledge base on how to best to serve students. They gathered to discuss organizational issues, to share experience about how to work effectively with campus administration, and to discuss the nature of the work with students. An integral part of the annual meeting was the opportunity to develop and nourish collegial friendships through work and recreation in a restful setting.
Directors valued the opportunity to discuss confidential matters with their colleagues and trusted one another with sensitive details that they could not process with fellow administrators on their own campus. Directors were challenged with issues such as managing relations with campus administration and faculty who could be skeptical of the value of counseling students as well as issues related to the management of their staff. Conference attendance was restricted to directors with staffs of at least three full-time equivalents (FTE) in order to create a confidential environment for consultation.
The annual conference provided the opportunity for both formal and ad hoc presentations, roundtable discussions, and individual consultation. The group was loosely organized as a "non-organization" with a minimum of bureaucracy, and the pivotal activity was the annual meeting. A steering committee was elected annually to manage routine business, and a conference host was chosen from among competing institutions during the conference business meeting.
The formal structure of AUCCCD as we now know it, developed slowly through the 1980s with the decision to revise the organization's By-laws and to incorporate as a non-profit organization. Throughout the 1990s several initiatives have been undertaken to develop a formal organizational structure to advance the business of AUCCCD as a national professional organization, and to put significant emphasis on advocating on behalf of counseling and psychological issues in higher education. Conference membership increased considerably after the 3 FTE restriction was lifted in the l990's.
Membership in AUCCCD is institutional with one director being selected to represent the member college or university. We have experienced significant growth with our current membership of 677 universities and colleges throughout the United States, Canada, and Europe and Asia.
1960s: As outpatient psychiatric clinics and services became more accessible to the general public, university counseling centers also began to provide standard psychological services to college students, including individual, couples, and group psychotherapy; vocational and personality assessment; consultative services to college administration, faculty, parents, and students; and crisis management among other services to the campus community.
1968: The Association of Psychology Postdoctoral and Internship Centers (APPIC) began formally coordinating pre-doctoral and post doctoral internships and jobs. Currently, there are 444 pre-doctoral internships listed through APPIC.
1978: The Association of Counseling Center Training Agencies (ACCTA) was established to coordinate the training objectives of university counseling centers, including creation and maintenance of pre-doctoral internship and practicum programs.

Max Wagner

Max Wagner (November 28, 1901 – November 16, 1975) was a Mexican-born American film actor who specialized in playing small parts such as thugs, gangsters, sailors, henchmen, bodyguards, cab drivers and moving men, appearing in nearly 400 films in his career, most without receiving screen credit. Newspaper gossip columnists noted his rise from playing "Gangster #4", with no lines, and not carrying a gun, to "Gangster #2", with both lines and a gun.
Biography.
Wagner was one of five children, all boys, of William Wallace Wagner, a railroad conductor, and Edith Wagner, a writer who provided dispatches for the "Christian Science Monitor" during the Mexican Revolution. When he was 10 years old, his father was killed by rebels and the family moved to Salinas, California, where he met John Steinbeck, who became a lifelong friend. Steinback based the character of the boy in his novel "The Red Pony" on Wagner.
Three of Wagner's brothers were working in Hollywood – Jack Wagner and Blake Wagner as cameramen for D.W. Griffith, Hal Roach and Mack Sennett, and Bob as an assistant cameraman at First National – and Max Wagner moved there in 1924, where he got an acting job on the Harry Langdon film his brother Jack was working on, "All Night Long".
Under the name "Max Baron", Wagner acted in many Spanish-language versions of English-language films, which studios made as a matter of course in the early days of sound films, He also served as a Spanish language coach for other actors, and appeared in many of the "Mexican Spitfire" films starring Lupe Vélez, where he also served to monitor Velez's Spanish ad-libs for profanity.
Other series that Wagner appeared in include the Charlie Chan films, and Tom Mix serials, as well as others made by Mascot Pictures Corporation. In the 1940s, Wagner was part of Preston Sturges' unofficial "stock company" of character actors, appearing in six films written and directed by Sturges, beginning with "The Palm Beach Story"
In 1940 during the filming of "The Mad Doctor", Wagner was credited for driving 50,000 miles as an on-screen taxi driver on the studio back lots of Hollywood. Since his appearance as a cab driver in "Charlie Chan in Shanghai" (1935), producers often cast him as a wise-cracking or henchman taxi driver. "I was cast as a taxi driver about five years ago", Wagner told a reporter. "And I was typed." 
Wagner's career has several breaks in it. He served with the U.S. Army in the North African Campaign of World War II, and his struggle with alcoholism caused a short break in 1950.
Paul Kelly case.
Wagner was the star prosecution witness in the manslaughter trials of actor Paul Kelly and actress/screenwriter Dorothy Mackaye in 1927. Wagner was Kelly's roommate. During an alcohol-fueled party at Wagner and Kelly's apartment on April 16, 1927, Kelly beat to death Mackaye's husband, Ray Raymond, a Vaudeville entertainer. Kelly and Mackaye had been seeing each other for some time before the fight had occurred. Wagner was present when Kelly and Raymond were fighting.
Kelly was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to two years in state prison. Mackaye was sentenced to 10 months in prison on accessory and concealing evidence convictions. Kelly and Mackaye were married after Kelly's release from prison. Wagner and Kelly appeared together in two films after the incident: "Death on the Diamond" (1934) and "Frenchie" (1950).
Later career.
In , Wagner began to appear on television, in episodes of such shows as "The Cisco Kid", "Zane Grey Theater" and "Perry Mason", playing much the same kind of parts he played in the movies.
He was a regular cast member on the western television series "Gunsmoke", making nearly 70 appearances between 1959 and 1973. He also appeared in many episodes of "The Rifleman", "Bonanza", "Cimarron Strip", "The Wild Wild West" and "Maverick", including a guest-starring role in the 1959 "Rifleman" episode "Blood Brother." He appeared in more than 150 television episodes between 1952 and 1974.
Notable film roles for Wagner include a supporting role in the cult science fiction classic "Invaders from Mars" (1953), an actor playing a gangster in the film-within-a-film segment of "Bullets or Ballots" (1936), and the bull farm attendant in Laurel and Hardy's "The Bullfighters" (1945). Late in his career, he appeared in "To Kill a Mockingbird" (1962) and "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" (1962). He also occasionally composed music, such as the Mexican folk ballad "Pedro, Rudarte y Simon" in the Western film "The Last Trail" (1933).
Wagner died of a heart attack in Hollywood in 1975, just 12 days before his 74th birthday.

Kevin P. Clark

Kevin Clark is a former commissioner of the Baltimore Police Department, who held the position from early 2003 until November 2004. A former NYPD officer, Clark's term as police commissioner was strained with both the mayor and police department as Clark was involved in domestic issues and an unpopular turnover of veteran officers such as former Major Gary D'Addario. He was fired by then-mayor (current governor) Martin O'Malley, resulting in a lawsuit in which he sought $120 million in damages and fought to get back his job. O'Malley's justification for the firing had been that these accusations were distracting to his duties as a commissioner.
According to the motions filed to Clark, the firing was a violation of his contract.
On the day of his firing, O'Malley named Leonard Hamm as the interim commissioner, a job to which Hamm would be permanently assigned.
In 2005, Clark made a request to the Baltimore board of estimates for $75,000 in severance pay. On April 4 of that year, Clark lost his case in court. But in July 2006, an appeals court reinstated his suit.
In 2008, a court ruled in Clark's favor.

Lepiota aspera

Lepiota aspera; sometimes known commonly as the Freckled Dapperling, is a large brownish; white gilled mushroom, with a warty or scaly cap. It lives in woodland, or on bark chips in parks, and gardens.
Taxonomy.
Noted by two of the most eminent nineteenth century mycologists (Persoon & Fries), the Freckled Dapperling has been back and forth through many taxonomical name changes. For a time; it was placed with the so called spiny "Lepiota" species into a separate sub-genus called Echinoderma, and was also placed into Cystolepiota. However; the most recent and widely accepted binomial name is Lepiota aspera (Pers.) Quel. The genus name "Lepiota" coming from the Greek, and meaning 'scale', which probably refers to the cap surface.
Description.
The cap is oval at first; becoming convex, or campanulate with age. Uniform reddish/brown, or brown at the centre; breaking up into erect scales, on a paler ground, and up to 10cms in diameter. The stem is paler; around 10cms in length, and has sparse brown scales below the ring. The ring itself is large and cottony; sometimes adhering to the cap perimeter, and often taking brownish scales from there, which are seen at its edge. The gills are free; crowded, and white, with the spore print being white also. The flesh is white, and is said to smell of rubber; earth balls, or "Lepiota cristata".
Similar species.
Check Lepiota; Macrolepiota, and Amanita species.
Distribution and habitat.
Lepiota aspera appears during autumn; in deciduous woodland, or in parks and gardens where 'wood chip' mulch has been used. It has been recorded in most northern temperate zones; England; Europe, and North Africa.
Edibility.
This mushroom has been shown to cause alcohol intolerance and may be poisonous.
