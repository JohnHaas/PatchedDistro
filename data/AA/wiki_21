Hermitage Cascade

Hermitage Cascade is a 4-metre cascade waterfall located in the Dundas Valley Conservation Area in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Its source is Hermitage Creek.
Nearby attractions include the Bruce Trail, Griffin House, Dundas Valley Trail Centre, Hamilton Conservation Authority Main Office, Fieldcote Museum, historic Ancaster Town Hall (built in 1871). There's also a convenience store, gas station, restaurant, motel and retail stores nearby.
History.
The property on which Hermitage Cascade is found was originally owned by Otto Ives, who bought it in 1833 and moved in with his wife and niece. Coachman William Black fell in love with the girl, and when Ives blocked the marriage proposal, Black went to the property's gatehouse and killed himself. Suicides were rarely given cemetery burials in those days, so he was interred at the nearest crossroads, now locally known as "Lover's Lane" because of the ill-fated affair. It is believed that Black's final resting place is adjacent to property now owned by Chris Ecklund.
George Gordon Browne Leith purchased the Hermitage in 1855. The Hermitage itself was a magnificent place to behold and visit: its ground floor contained an opulent dining room, library, drawing room, and stately entrance all, all furnished with original works of art and the best furniture. Leith spent over 2000 pounds in modernizing the place. After his death in 1901, his daughter Alma bought the estate from the rest of the family and lived there until 1934, when a fire broke out during a party and burned the house down. All that can be seen today is the old gatehouse and the ruins.

Smoky Mountain Jam

The Smoky Mountain Jam team is a member of the American Basketball Association (ABA) that began play in the 2008- 2009 season. They are located in Sevierville, Tennessee, which is in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains.
The Jam is owned by the Crossroads Sports Entertainment Group, LLC, headed by Chris Glisson. On May 18, 2009, the Jam announced their name, logo, and colors. The choice of "Jam" as the nickname comes from a play on words where a "jam" refers to a basketball scoring effort as well as a jam session in music. The team made a decision to enhance its Tennessee heritage in its choice of names, especially its musical roots.
History.
Their first season, where they were known as the Knoxville Thunderbolts and played in the city of Knoxville, (they were originally going to be called the Knoxville Storm before changing their name due fellow ABA members the Winston-Salem Storm using the nickname). under coach Chad Smith, saw them entering the playoffs and surprising the league by winning successive games over favored teams New York Internationalz and Texas Fuel before bowing to the #1 ranked Southeast Texas Mustangs in the quarterfinals held in Nashville, Tennessee. The first-season success by the Knoxville team was even more surprising considering the fact that the ABA was a 40-team league.
The Thunderbolts were named runners-up as the Franchise of the Year at the awards ceremony after the 2008-2009 championship game. The Thunderbolts placed second to the Kentucky Bisons franchise.
Forward Gus Chase and guard Scott Williams were named to the ABA All-Star squad for the 2008-2009 season.
The 2009-2010 season is scheduled to play in Sevierville its temporary headquarters before construction of the new facilities for the 2011-2012 season.

Constant problem

In mathematics, the constant problem is the problem of deciding if a given expression is equal to zero.
The problem.
This problem is also referred to as the identity problem or the method of zero estimates. It has no formal statement as such but refers to a general problem prevalent in transcendence theory. Often proofs in transcendence theory are proofs by contradiction, specifically they use some auxiliary function to create an integer "n" ≥ 0 which is shown to satisfy "n" < 1. Clearly this means that "n" must have the value zero, and so a contradiction arises if one can show that in fact "n" is "not" zero.
In many transcendence proofs, proving that "n" ≠ 0 is very difficult, and hence a lot of work has been done to develop methods that can be used to prove the non-vanishing of certain expressions. The sheer generality of the problem is what makes it difficult to prove general results or come up with general methods for attacking it. The number "n" that arises may involve integrals, limits, polynomials, other functions, and determinants of matrices.
Results.
In certain cases algorithms or other methods exist for proving that a given expression is non-zero, or of showing that the problem is undecidable. For example, if "x"1, ..., "x""n" are real numbers then there is an algorithm for deciding if there are integers "a"1, ..., "a""n" such that
If the expression we are interested in contains a function which oscillates, such as the sine or cosine function, then it has been shown that the problem is undecidable, a result known as Richardson's theorem. In general, methods specific to the expression being studied are required to prove that it cannot be zero.

Acadesine

Acadesine (INN), also known as 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-D-ribofuranoside, AICA-riboside, and AICAR, is an AMP-activated protein kinase activator which is used for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and may have applications in treating other disorders such as diabetes.
Acadesine is an adenosine regulating agent developed by PeriCor Therapeutics and licensed to Schering-Plough in 2007 for phase III studies. The drug is a potential first-in-class agent for prevention of reperfusion injury in CABG surgery. Schering began patient enrollment in phase III studies in May, 2009. The trial was terminated in late 2010 based on an interim futility analysis.
Chemistry.
Reaction of 2-bromo tribenzoyl ribose with 1,2-diaminomaleionitrile results in the displacement of the anomeric halogen by one of the amino groups and the formation of the aminosugar largely as the β-anomer. Treatment of this product with methyl orthoformate in the presence of a base leads to the replacement of the alkoxy groups in orthoformate by the adjacent amines, resulting in the formation of the imidazole ring. Reaction with alkoxide then interestingly converts the nitrile nearest the sugar to an iminoester; the benzoyl groups are cleaved in the process. Hofmann rearrangement in the presence of a bromine and a base converts the iminoester to the corresponding primary amine. Basic hydrolysis then converts the remaining nitrile to an amide, affording acadesine.
Pharmacology and use in doping.
Acadesine acts as an AMP-activated protein kinase agonist. It stimulates glucose uptake and increases the activity of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases α and β in skeletal muscle tissue, as well as suppressing apoptosis by reducing production of reactive oxygen compounds inside the cell.
In 2008, researchers at the Salk Institute discovered that acadesine injected in mice significantly improved their performance in endurance-type exercise, apparently by converting fast-twitch muscle fibers to the more energy-efficient, fat-burning, slow-twitch type. They also looked at the administration of GW 501516 (also called GW1516) in combination with acadesine. Given to mice that did not exercise, this combination activated 40% of the genes that were turned on when mice were given GW1516 and made to exercise. This result drew attention to the compound as a possible athletic endurance aid. One of the lead researchers from this study has developed a urine test to detect it and has made the test available to the International Olympic Committee, and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) has added acadesine to the prohibited list from 2009 onwards. The "British Medical Journal" reported in 2009 that WADA had found evidence that acadesine was used by cyclists in the 2009 Tour de France.

Wat Pah Nanachat

Wat Pah Nanachat (, International Forest Monastery) is situated in a small forest in north-east Thailand about fifteen kilometres from the city of Ubon Rachathani. It is an international forest monastery primarily for non-Thais. The late Ajahn Chah established the monastery in 1975 to serve as a training community for non-Thais along traditional monastic lines. Its monks, novices and postulants include a wide range of nationalities. The primary language of communication and instruction is English.
History.
The monastery was founded in response to increasing international interest, particularly from the United Kingdom, in the theravadin forest tradition of Thailand. The first abbot of Wat Pah Nanachat was Ajahn Sumedho, an American bhikkhu trained by Ajahn Chah at Wat Nong Pah Pong, the mother house of Wat Pah Nanachat. Today, as a consequence, students of the Thai forest tradition are found in branch monasteries around the world under the collective label of "The Forest Sangha". The largest monastery of this network is Amaravati Monastery about 30 miles north of London. Its abbot was Ajahn Sumedho, who recently relinquished the post to Ajahn Amaro (ex-abbot of Abhayagiri Buddhist Monastery in California).
Meditation.
Buddhist meditation practice of all types is encouraged at Wat Nanachat, though breathing meditation predominates. In the spirit of Ajahn Chah's teachings, vipassanā or insight, and samatha or concentration, are regarded as two sides of a coin rather than two distinct categories. Lay visitors are expected to observe the eight precepts version of sila, or the practice of virtue. For monks, strict adherence to the Vinaya, the 2,500-year-old code of discipline, is not only required but is the distinguishing characteristic of the lineage. For lay visitors, no formal meditation teaching is available beyond Dhamma talks and what may be derived from freely available reading matter, the priority being the formal training of the full-time mendicants.
Visiting.
Prospective visitors to the Wat are advised to write well in advance, as facilities are somewhat limited. Men staying for more than a few days are required to shave their heads, as well as facial hair and eyebrows. Laypeople dress in modest white clothing, borrowed from the monastery if necessary. Some laywomen wear black skirts with a white blouse. Venerable Ajahn Kevali, abbot since 2007, encourages a more communal atmosphere than perhaps earlier had been the case. Guests are expected to take part in all daily activities. Following is a summary of a typical daily schedule:
On Observance Days (uposatha), the schedule may vary somewhat as monks and laity alike attempt to sit in meditation all through the night till five in the morning.
Getting there.
The monastery is in Isaan, the north-eastern region of Thailand, in the district or amphoe of Warin Chamrap, Ubon Ratchathani Province, Tambon Bung Wai.
"To Ubon Ratchathani:" Thai Airways offers flights to Ubon from Don Mueang in Bangkok. Overnight sleeper from Bangkok, as well as other trains and buses are available. "To Wat Pah Nanachat:" Once in Ubon, going to Wat Pah Nanachat is straightforward and there are a few options. Any buses in Ubon bound for Si Saket drive past the Wat, simply ask the driver to be let off there. Another option is to take a bus to Warin Chamrap, where you can take a Songthaew to the Wat. It's also possible to hire a tuk-tuk or taxi to the wat from the airport, bus or train stations.

Communicative ecology

Communicative ecology is a conceptual model used in the field of media and communications research to analyse and represent the relationships between the social interactions, discourse, and communication media and technology of individuals, collectives and networks in physical and digital environments. Broadly, the term communicative ecology refers to “the context in which communication processes occur” (Foth & Hearn, 2007, p. 9). These processes are seen to involve people communicating with others in their social networks, both face-to-face and using a mix of media and communication technologies (Tacchi, Slater & Hearn, 2003) (Tacchi, et al. 2007).
Rationale.
The communicative ecology model enables researchers to take a holistic approach to understanding the dynamic interrelationships between social dimensions, discourse and communications technology in both physical and digital environments. The use of an ecological metaphor markedly expands the potential sphere of inquiry for communications and media research. It shifts the focus away from studies focusing on single communications devices or applications, for example the mobile telephone or email, towards whole system interactions. Consequently, it extends the possibility of research into population change and lifecycles, spatiotemporal dynamics, networks and clusters, and power relations within the frame of a communicative ecology. Also, as ecologies are not isolated entities, further questions regarding the similarities, differences, interrelationships and transactions between ecologies can be examined. A richer understanding can then be derived from micro and macro level analysis of the social and cultural context of communication (Foth & Hearn, 2007).
The concept of communicative ecology has emerged amidst concerns that studies attempting to identify causal relationships between discrete technologies and social impacts neglect variables that are salient to the successful implementation and uptake of technologies "in situ" (Dourish, 2004). This mirrors the way in which the biological field of ecology emerged from the perceived inadequacies of studies of single species of flora and fauna. In a similar way, researchers who use the communicative ecology framework argue that media technologies should not be examined independent of their context of use. They assert that new media must be both studied and designed with reference to the users’ wider set of social relationships, the nature of the communication itself and other media in use. Through use of ethnographic approaches a richer, more nuanced understanding of the communicative system of a given setting is able to be developed.
New media are usually introduced into existing communication structures and must compete for attention in relation to the users’ existing portfolio of communication tools. Consequently, if a new communication technology does not complement or enhance the existing toolset it risks rejection. The communicative ecology model allows researchers to examine how a new form of media or technology may or may not be integrated into existing communication patterns (Tacchi, 2006).
However, the potential utility of the communicative ecology model is far broader than this. Any new form of social intervention, content or technology must be locally appropriate for it to succeed (Tacchi, 2006). Hence, the communicative ecology framework is useful for human-computer interaction designers, content creators, urban planners, community development practitioners and educators seeking opportunities to enhance or augment local social and communication practices.
History and usage.
The concept of communicative ecology is derived from Altheide’s “ecology of communication” (1994;1995). Altheide developed this concept to examine the mutually influential relationships between information technology, communication formats and social activities, within the context of people’s social and physical environments, as they define and experience them. The concept is influenced by McLuhan’s (1962) research on media ecology, which demonstrates that new media and technology can influence communicative content, and also the symbolic interactionist perspective of communication as embedded in context (Barnlund, 1979). Altheide considers ecology of communication to be a fluid construct that can be used as a frame to investigate the ways in which social activities are being created and modified through the use of technologies that, in turn, give rise to new communication formats. He is particularly interested in the relationship between social activities and technologies for surveillance and control.
The communicative ecology concept has been further developed for use in studies of information and communication technologies (ICT) initiatives in developing nations (Slater, Tacchi & Lewis, 2002). A guide to the study of communicative ecologies using the ethnographic action research method, developed with the support of UNESCO, has spawned a proliferation of empirical research (Tacchi et al., 2007) (Tacchi, Slater & Hearn, 2003). Many of these investigations have focused on ICT for development projects associated with community technology centres and local information networks in South Asian and African nations (Slater et al., 2002;Slater & Tacchi, 2004;Pringle, Bajracharya, & Bajracharya, 2004;Sharma, 2005;Nair, Jennaway & Skuse, 2006;Rangaswamy, 2007). In these studies, local community members are often engaged as active participants in a research and project development process that provides opportunities for them to gain the ICT literacy skills necessary to create locally meaningful content (Subramanian, Nair & Sharma, 2004;Tacchi, 2005a, 2007;Tacchi & Watkins, 2007). Many of these research activities investigate and support interventions that aim to alleviate poverty (Slater & Kwami, 2005), educate (Subramanian, 2005) and promote the digital inclusion necessary for citizens to actively participate in civic life and have their voices heard (Tacchi, 2005b;Skuse & Cousins, 2007, 2008;Skuse, Fildes, Tacchi, Martin & Baulch, 2007;. Some studies have reported on the use of a particular ICT, for example community radio (Tacchi, 2005c) or mobile phones (Horst & Miller, 2006;Miller, 2007), in relation to broader communication patterns.
More recently, the communicative ecology framework has been extended in studies of the nature of media use to support social networks in urban villages and inner-city apartment buildings (Foth & Hearn, 2007). This paper introduced the concept of dimensions to the communicative ecology model. Button and Partridge (2007) used the model to examine the online communicative ecology of neighbourhood websites. The model has also been used to investigate how students communicate and reflect on their learning (Berry & Hamilton, 2006).
A special issue of the Electronic Journal of Communication showcased the versatility of the communicative ecology approach (Hearn & Foth, 2007). In this issue, Allison (2007) looked at the communicative ecology from the perspective of the individual, whereas Wilkin, Ball-Rokeach, Matsaganis and Cheong (2007) used a panoptic perspective to compare the ecologies of geo-ethnic communities. Peeples and Mitchell (2007) used the model to explore the social activity of protest. Powell (2007) focused on a particular medium, public internet access, in an urban context. Shepherd, Arnold, Bellamy and Gibbs (2007) extended the concept to attend to the material and spatial aspects of the communicative ecology of the domestic sphere.
The term “communicative ecology” has also been used in other studies with various interpretations. Interactional sociolinguists use the term to describe the local communicative environment of a particular setting in which discourse is contextualised. Using methods drawn from linguistic anthropology, their research begins with a period of ethnography in which a rich understanding of the local communicative ecology is formed. Discourse is then analysed in relation to this ecological context (Gumperz, 1999). Roberts (2005) describes a communicative ecology as comprising the identity of participants, the topics of communication and the ways in which things are communicated, including tone of voice, directness, etc. Beier (2001) draws on Hymes’ (1974) work in ethnography of communication and uses the concept to understand the range of communicative practices of the Nanti people as a system of interaction.
From an applied linguistics perspective, McArthur (2005) describes a communicative ecology as embracing the nature and evolution of language, media and communication technologies. He uses the term to discuss the interactions between the world’s languages and communication technologies. Wagner (2004) uses the term to refer to the deep structures of meaning and communicative action that human language shares with other species, particularly the bonobo. In cultural studies of terrorism, White (2003) uses the term to describe the interchange of signs within interacting networks of individuals and collectives.
In their study of computer-mediated communication in the workplace, Yates, Orlikowski and Woerner (2003) draw upon Erickson’s (2000) work on genre ecologies to suggest a communicative ecology can be identified by the types and frequencies of communicative practices, such as email threading activities. Their version of communicative ecology is influenced by members of a workplace engaging in common activities, the length of time over which interaction takes place, whether communication media is synchronous or asynchronous and members’ linguistic or cultural background.
There is not a single, agreed upon communicative ecology model, rather, this section highlights that there are various approaches to understanding and applying the model in various contexts. Furthermore, concepts that bear some similarity to communicative ecology include actor-network theory (Latour, 2005), activity theory (Nardi, 1996) the communication infrastructure model (Ball-Rokeach, Kim & Matei, 2001) and the personal communication system (Boase, 2008).
Characteristics.
Often in sociological literature, an ecology is seen to be anchored in a geographical area of human settlement. In the case of a communicative ecology, while the majority of studies have been conducted in physical environments, it is also possible to use the framework to examine ecologies grounded in an online environment. In many cases, communicative ecologies move seamlessly across both kinds of settings. For example, settings may include both public and private spaces, transport infrastructure and websites, in any combination.
Different settings have distinct affordances that may facilitate or hinder communication within an ecology. In a physical setting this might mean a neighbourhood has several coffee shops and parks where residents can interact. In an online setting, certain design features may enable certain types of communication and constrain others. For example, discussion boards facilitate one-to-many or many-to-many collective forms of communication but not one-to-one or peer-to-peer style networked communication that would be better served by SMS or instant messaging (Foth & Hearn, 2007).
Similar to biological ecologies, communicative ecologies have lifecycles. They can be described as new or well-established, active or dormant, or in a period of growth or decline. For example, residents of a new master-planned housing estate will have a young communicative ecology that is in a period of growth but may need cultivation in order to become active. In this case, sociocultural animation of the ecology may be required for it to become socially sustainable (Tacchi et al., 2003).
Communicative ecologies can be conceived as having three layers and differing across several spectral dimensions. The nature of a communicative ecology changes as its members engage in and transition between different types of activities.
Layers.
A communicative ecology has three layers: social, discursive and technological (Foth & Hearn, 2007). These layers are seen to be intricately entwined and mutually constitutive, rather than discrete, hierarchical or as having unidirectional causal relationships. While it is challenging to consider each layer in isolation, analysing each layer independently can be a beneficial preliminary step prior to the examination of the complex, mutual shaping relationships that form part of the holistic view of a communicative ecology.
The social layer refers to people and the various social structures with which they identify themselves, ranging from informal personal networks to formal institutions. For example, this may include groups of friends, formal community organisations and companies. The discursive layer refers to the themes or content of both mediated and unmediated communication. The technological layer comprises communication media and technologies. This includes both traditional media, such as newspapers and television, and new media including mobile phones and social networking sites. The devices and applications within this layer are differentiated according to the communication model they facilitate. For example, collective communication is made possible through one-to-many or many-to-many forms of media, such as television or online discussion boards, whereas networked communication can be enabled through one-to-one or peer-to-peer media, including instant messaging or SMS (Foth & Hearn, 2007).
The layered nature of the communicative ecology framework enables the investigation of research questions surrounding the media preferences of diverse individuals and groups and how these choices influence their relationships. It also allows researchers to explore the nature of discourse between individuals and within groups, and how communication changes according to the nature of people’s relationships with one another. The communicative ecology model is also useful for considering how different topics of communication affect choice of media and how different media shape communicative content.
Dimensions.
Communicative ecologies vary across several spectral dimensions. The dimensions identified to date, include networked/collective, global/local and online/offline (Foth & Hearn, 2007). The dimensional properties of communicative ecologies allow researchers to consider both the relative strength of each characteristic, and also how individuals and the ecology itself transitions fluidly between dimensions.
For example, researchers can question how an individual or group’s choice of media changes as they transition between networked and collective forms of interaction. They may also consider how different media may facilitate or constrain either networked or collective interaction. If interested in the global or local characteristics of an ecology, researchers may examine how communication with proximate others may be mediated differently to communication with others in distant locales. They could also explore which communication topics are more likely to occur at the local level rather than within globally distributed social networks. As users of new technologies now move seamlessly between what was formerly constituted as online and offline domains, researchers may use the communicative ecology model to address questions of how and why people choose certain assemblages of online and offline media to achieve particular communicative goals. Investigation of how the nature of discourse may affect the choice of online or offline modes of interaction is also possible.
Communicative ecologies can also be characterised across several other dimensions. One example is the private/public dimension. People may choose to interact and communicate with each other in private settings, such as their home or via email, or in more public settings, such as a restaurant or chat room.
Types of activity.
The nature of an individual’s communicative ecology changes as they transition between types of activity. For example, they may choose to use different media when communicating with work colleagues as compared to planning an evening out with friends. Similarly, a workplace’s communicative ecology may differ from that of a tennis club or a loosely-joined network of environmental activists.
The activities of everyday life can be grouped into various types. Five example categories are as follows. The first three are derived from Stebbins’s (2007) typology of leisure activities.
These groupings enable exploration of the patterns of social interactions, topics of communication and media applications that may be specific to an activity type.
Scope, resolution and granularity.
The study of a communicative ecology requires decisions to be made concerning the scope of both data collection and analysis. Prior to data collection, a decision must be made as to the investigative frame of the study, whereas decisions regarding the analytical scope of a study may be made after a rich picture of the ecology has emerged.
While an ecological study aims to be holistic, an appropriate frame for the study must be decided upon at the outset. The scope of communicative ecology research settings is generally restricted to a bounded geographical space. It has been proposed that the communicative ecology framework is suited to studies at the level of the dwelling, neighbourhood, suburb or city (Hearn & Foth, 2007). However, it is also suitable for studies of communicative ecologies that are grounded in online environments. In this case, the setting could be limited to one or several websites (Button & Partridge, 2007).
Temporal considerations may also shape data collection procedures. For example, an ecology could be examined at a single point of time or longitudinally. It is possible that the nature of a communicative ecology may also vary according to time of day, week or season.
The analysis of a communicative ecology can occur at both macro and micro levels within this spatiotemporal frame. It can help to think of a communicative ecology as a map and its edges as the frame. We can increase the resolution of certain features by using a magnifying glass. By stepping away from the map, we can increase the granularity of our view and see how features interrelate with the ecology as a whole. In this way, the interrelationships between agents are not ignored, as they may be in studies that focus on single communication devices or applications, but may be temporarily set aside while other features are examined more closely. By viewing the map as a whole first, the researcher may be able to make better analytical choices than was possible prior to data collection.
Some possible methods for delimiting the analytical scope of a communicative ecology study include using features of a layer or another characteristic. For example, the analysis could be delimited to examining the ecology of an individual, a small social network or group, or by certain demographic characteristics. It could focus on the ecology of a specific theme of communication, form of media or technology, setting or activity. Alternatively, it could investigate a single dimension of a communicative ecology, for example, only local or public forms of communication.
Perspective.
Communicative ecology researchers speak in terms of “mapping” the ecology. This term may be misleading as it could appear to indicate the creation of cartographic renderings of the communicative ecology as it relates to its locality. Mapping the ecology, in the main, refers to drawing conceptual maps and creating or collecting oral or written descriptions of the phenomena that constitute the communicative ecology.
There are two primary perspectives taken to communicative ecology research that are loosely correlative with the emic and etic positions taken in classic ethnographic studies. A researcher can work from the outside of the ecology looking in with the aim of creating a holistic overview. Alternatively, they can position themselves within the communicative ecology with the aim of looking at it from the participants’ points of view. The external view is useful if a comparison between local systems is desired. A centric view is better suited to understanding how people construct and make sense of their communicative ecology.
The choice of perspective may enhance or limit the utility of the data. For example, a birds-eye view may fail to capture significant individual differences in the experience of a communicative ecology, such as those brought about by differing wealth or literacy levels. Ideally, communicative ecology research should use a variety of perspectives in order to obtain a more complete representation and deeper understanding.
Associated research approaches and methods.
The study of communicative ecologies is commonly associated with a research approach known as ethnographic action research. This approach combines ethnographic methods, including participant observation and in-depth interviews, with participatory methods and action research. The ethnographic methods enable researchers to develop a rich understanding of the meanings derived from media and communication technologies. The action research methods allow the study to be located in not only communication theory, but also grassroots communication practice. In this approach, participants can act as co-investigators in cycles of inquiry, action and reflection and researchers are able to give back in a way that will develop the communicative ecology. In this way, ethnographic action research is suited to both research and project development agendas (Tacchi, 2006).

Challengers of the Unknown (alternate series)

Challengers of the Unknown is the title of a comic book series used on various occasions by DC Comics. Most of these series dealt with the original Challengers of the Unknown. The concept behind this team was a group of individuals surviving a disaster (a plane crash with the original group) and deciding to collectively do something with the "borrowed time" they have left.
On two occasions DC used the name and concept, with a new set of characters, as the basis for a new series. The first of these two, intended to be an ongoing series, was published from late 1996 to mid-1998. The second was a six-issue limited series published in 2004.
1996 series.
Started as a part of DC's Weirdoverse group of titles, the 1996 series was published for a total of eighteen issues -- cover dated February 1997 to July 1998. The characters were a mix of races and were, like the original group, the only survivors of a plane crash:
The 1996 series was originally conceived as the basis for a television series that never came about, as writer Steven Grant revealed in 2000:
2004 series.
The 2004 series was a six-issue limited series, written and drawn by Howard Chaykin. Unlike the other two versions this group didn't originate in a plane crash, instead, it was made up of survivors of a large scale terrorist attack in Long Beach, California:

Radio Science Subsystem

Radio Science Subsystem (RSS) is a subsystem placed on board a scientific spacecraft. 
Function of the RSS.
The RSS uses radio signals to probe a medium such as a planetary atmosphere. The spacecraft transmits a highly stable signal to ground stations, receives such a signal from ground stations, or both. Since the transmitted signal parameters are accurately known to the receiver, any changes to these parameters are attributable to the propagation medium or to the relative motion of the spacecraft and ground station.
The RSS is usually not a separate instrument; its functions are usually "piggybacked" on the existing telecommunications subsystem. More advanced systems use multiple antennas with orthogonal polarizations.
Radio science.
Radio science is commonly used to determine the gravity field of a moon or planet by observing Doppler shift. This requires a highly stable oscillator on the spacecraft, or more commonly a "2-way coherent" transponder that phase locks the transmitted signal frequency to a rational multiple of a received uplink signal that usually also carries spacecraft commands.
Another common radio science observation is performed as a spacecraft is occulted by a planetary body. As the spacecraft moves behind the planet, its radio signals cuts through successively deeper layers of the planetary atmosphere. Measurements of signal strength and polarization vs time can yield data on the composition and temperature of the atmosphere at different altitudes.
It is also common to use multiple radio frequencies coherently derived from a common source to measure the dispersion of the propagation medium. This is especially useful in determining the free electron content of a planetary ionosphere.

The Town of Banff, in Banff National Park in Alberta's Rockies, Canada, launched a new rebranded local bus system called Roam in June 2008. There are three routes connecting the town, Tunnel Mountain, the Banff Springs Hotel, and the Banff Gondola. Service is provided using four hybrid Nova buses, each decorated with scenes from the National Park, featuring either a grizzly bear, elk, mountain goat or wolf.
Cash fare is $2 for adults and $1 for seniors and children under 13, with children under 5 riding for free. A $5 Day Pass provides unlimited travel for that day. Tokens can be bought in advance at a reduced rate and a Smartcard is available for one, three and six month periods.
Formerly known as "Banff Public Transit", the town has had some form of public transportation since 1994, contracted to a variety of private operators. On May 31, 2008, local tour bus company Brewster Inc., took over operation of the revamped system, using the newly acquired fleet.
The Bow Valley Regional Transit Services Commission (BVRTSC) was formally established on 21 April 2011, to provide passenger transportation services in Bow Valley, which includes the municipalities of Canmore, Banff and Improvement District No. 9, and assumed responsibility for Roam public transit services. On December 3, 2012, regional transit service between Banff and Canmore began.

Charles Edward Long

Charles Edward Long (28 July 1796 – 25 September 1861), was an English genealogist and antiquary.
Life.
Born at Benham Park, Berkshire, he was the elder and only surviving son of Charles Beckford Long (d. 1836) of Langley Hall, Berkshire, and his wife, Frances Monro Tucker. He was the grandson of Edward Long, the historian of Jamaica, and nephew of Charles Long, 1st Baron Farnborough, and also of General Robert Ballard Long, his father's twin. Long was educated at Harrow School (1810 – 1814) and at Trinity College, Cambridge (1815 – 1819). He won the Chancellor's Gold Medal in July 1818 for English verse on the subject of imperial and papal Rome, and graduated BA in 1819 and MA in 1822.
Returning from a visit to Hamburg, Long died unmarried on 25 September 1861 at the Lord Warden Hotel, Dover. He was buried in the churchyard at Seale, Surrey.
Works.
Possessed of an ample fortune, Long's devotion to historical and genealogical studies were greatly facilitated by access to the College of Heralds granted him by the Deputy Earl Marshal, Lord Henry Thomas Molyneux Howard - his uncle by marriage. Long always maintained a personal and scholarly interest in Harrow and in 1849 assisted George Butler in his biographical notes of Harrow scholars. In 1860 he wrote for the Harrow Gazette an article on the life of John Lyon, the founder of the school. Descended from the Long family of Wiltshire, he also took a considerable interest in the history of that county: he was an earnest promoter of the Wiltshire Archaeological Society, and contributed to its magazine. He was for many years a frequent correspondent of the Gentleman's Magazine, and the leading antiquarian periodicals of his day. In 1845 with the assistance of the Garter King of Arms, Sir Charles George Young, Long compiled a volume called "Royal descents: a genealogical list of the several persons entitled to quarter the arms of the royal houses of England" In 1859 from the original manuscript in the British Museum, he edited for the Camden Society, the "Diary of the Marches of the Royal Army during the Great Civil War, Kept by Richard Symonds". He presented his "Genealogical collections of Jamaica families", to the British Museum. During 1857–9 he also gave to the museum many valuable documents relating to Jamaica, an also preserved in the British Library are his letters to Joseph Hunter, extending from 1847 to 1859. Amongst many other of Long's publications, notable is his pamphlet of 1832 in which he defends the conduct of his uncle Robert Ballard Long during the campaign of 1811; and also his 1824 volume Considerations on the Game Laws, in which he offered an argument for regarding game as property, thereby allowing its sale to become a legal transaction.

Bug (comics)

Bug is a fictional character, a superhero in the . Bug was originally a member of the Micronauts and later joined the second incarnation of the Guardians of the Galaxy.
When he first appeared in "Micronauts" #1 (dated January 1979), Bug was known as Galactic Warrior, taking this name from a figure from the Micronauts toy line on which the comic book series was based. The toy based characters were all owned by Takara Co., Ltd., with any original characters owned by Marvel. Starting with the fourth issue Galactic Warrior's name was changed to Bug. This was done after Marvel realized that since the character's design looked nothing like the toy, they could assume ownership if they used a different name.
Publication history.
Micronauts membership.
Bug appeared as a featured character throughout "Micronauts" original run, starting from the first issue until issue #59 (dated August 1984), the series' final issue. Months later Marvel restarted the series with "Micronauts: The New Voyages" #1 (dated October 1984) with Bug once again appearing as a featured character. This second series lasted until issue #20 (dated May 1986).
Planned relaunch and solo one-shot.
In the 1990s Marvel began plans to launch a new series starring the Micronauts, despite the fact that they no longer held the publishing rights to the toy based characters. Assuming that Abrams Gentile Entertainment (the company that, at the time, owned the American rights to the Micronaut toy line) would agree to this new series, Marvel hired Shon C. Bury to write the series and Cary Nord to draw it. In preparation Bug and the other Micronauts that Marvel owned guest starred in "Cable" #39 (dated January 1997) and Bug was featured in a solo one-shot (dated March 1997). The negotiations with AGE eventually fell apart, the series was shelved and the three issues already produced were never published.
Bug would later appear with the other Marvel owned Micronauts (now named the Microns) in issues of "Captain Marvel" in 2000 and 2001. 
Annihilation: Conquest.
Bug did not make any further appearances until 2007. At this point he appeared alone, without any of the other Microns, as a prisoner of the alien race the Kree. He was then recruited into a hastily assembled covert team led by Star-Lord. His activities at this point were depicted in the limited series, "Annihilation: Conquest - Star-Lord" and in the subsequent limited series "Annihilation: Conquest". He was then a recurring character in the second volume of "Guardians of the Galaxy", which spun out of the events portrayed in "Annihilation: Conquest".
Guardians Membership.
Although Bug was not a founding member of the "modern" Guardians team, Rocket Raccoon asked him to join when the original group disbanded after some internal misunderstandings. Bug agreed, and fought alongside the Guardians as they attempted to stop the Shi'ar-Kree interstellar conflict known as the War of Kings. Although they failed, Bug stayed with the Guardians as they dealt with the war's aftermath in the Realm of Kings storyline through the series' end with issue #25 in 2010. Bug appeared as a member of the Guardians in "Avengers Assemble" issues #4-8 in 2012.
Bug will appear in the new 2013 "Guardians of the Galaxy" series by Brian Michael Bendis and Steven McNiven.
Powers and Abilities.
Bug can cling to walls and has exceptional agility. He has extraordinary sight, with enhanced peripheral vision gained by wearing his helmet. His antennae enable communication with others bearing antennae, and provide heightened sensory awareness with a limited degree of danger sense.

Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma

Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FHCC) is a rare form of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that typically affects young adults and is characterized, under the microscope, by laminated fibrous layers interspersed between the tumour cells. Approximately 200 new cases are diagnosed worldwide each year.
Diagnosis.
Due to lack of symptoms, until the tumor is sizable, this form of cancer is often advanced when diagnosed. Local symptoms may include a palpable liver mass.
FHCC often does not produce alpha fetoprotein (AFP), a widely used marker for conventional hepatocellular carcinoma. However, FHCC is associated elevated neurotensin levels. 
Epidemiology.
FHCC has a low age of onset (~27 years) when compared to conventional HCC. Also, unlike conventional HCC, patients most often do not have coexistent liver disease.
FHCC generally occurs in young adults without underlying cirrhosis. Compared to conventional HCC, FHCC grows slowly and has better prognosis, probably owing to its high resectability. 
Pathology.
The histopathology of FHCC is characterized by laminated fibrous layers, interspersed between the tumor cells. Cytologically, the tumor cells have a low nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. Tumors are non-encapsulated, but well circumscribed, when compared to conventional HCC (which typically has an invasive border). 
Treatment.
In FHCC, plasma neurotensin and serum vitamin B12 binding globulin are commonly increased and are useful in monitoring the disease and detecting recurrence.
FHCC has a high resectability rate, i.e. it can often be surgically removed. Liver resection is the optimal treatment and may need to be performed more than once, since this disease has a very high recurrence rate. Due to such recurrence, periodic follow-up medical imaging (CT or MRI) is necessary. 
As the tumor is quite rare, there is no standard chemotherapy regimen. 
The survival rate for fibrolamellar HCC largely depends on whether (and to what degree) the cancer has metastasized, i.e. spread to the lymph nodes or other organs. Distant spread (metastases), significantly reduces the median survival rate.

Students for a Libertarian Society

Students for a Libertarian Society (SLS) is an activist organization for students in the United States who want to promote libertarian ideals on college campuses.
Origins.
The name and organizational structure were inspired by the success of Students for a Democratic Society in the 1960s. SLS was founded in April 1979. It was organizationally distinct from the Libertarian Party which had its own, much smaller, official youth wing, the Young Libertarian Alliance.
National organization.
At its height in 1979 and 1980, SLS had a central national office with a paid staff in San Francisco, and dozens of chapters. It also published a variety of pamphlets and issue papers and "Liberty" magazine in a newspaper format with a circulation of more than 10,000 copies per issue.
The National Directors of Students for a Libertarian Society were Milton Mueller (1979-1981), Jeffrey Friedman (1981-1982), Kathleen Jacob Richman (1982), and Chris Gunderson (1982–83). Others active in the organization were Williamson Evers, Chris Sciabarra, Mark Brady, Mark Joffe, Eric Garris, and David Beito, who were members of the national board, and Paul Jacob, a prominent draft registration resister, Tom G. Palmer, and Dave Nalle, the publications director and editor of "Liberty" magazine. Former chapter heads included Justin Raimondo, Lee Cronk, Greg Costikyan and Alan R. Weiss.
The SLS was very active in organizing protests against draft registration during the presidential administration of Jimmy Carter. It later organized protests against governmental support for nuclear power. As part of this effort, it worked closely with scientist John Gofman, a veteran of the Manhattan Project and a key developer of an early process for separating plutonium from fission products, in a campaign to repeal such subsides for nuclear power as the Price Anderson Act. Gofman, sometimes described as the "father" of the modern anti-nuclear movement in the United States, was a self-described libertarian. Many members of SLS supported the Libertarian presidential campaign of Ed Clark in 1980 but, unlike the Young Libertarian Alliance and its successor Students for Clark, SLS did not officially take a stand.
Decline.
Beginning in 1982, the SLS began began to fall apart as a national organization over disagreements between the Radical Caucus of Murray Rothbard, Williamson Evers and Justin Raimondo, and others associated with Ed Crane and the Cato Institute. In 1982, it had to make massive cutbacks when billionaire, Charles Koch, withdrew his financial support. After the last National Director, Chris Gunderson, failed to get replacement funding, SLS quickly collapsed. It seems to have disappeared as a national organization in 1983 though a few chapters remained active for several years.
Reestablishment.
Justin Raimondo was involved in an attempt to reestablish a national organization under the aegis of antiwar.com and led by Mike Ewens of the Washington University chapter, but although some local chapters seem to have been founded not much else appears to have been done on a national basis and the website is offline. The banner of organizing libertarian students has since been picked up by new organizations: Students For Liberty and Young Americans for Liberty.

Last Gospel

The Last Gospel is the passage from the Gospel according to St. John in , where Jesus is described as the Logos. It is so named because it is part of the concluding rite of the Traditional Latin Mass of the Roman Rite.
The Last Gospel began as a private devotional practice on the priest's part, but was gradually absorbed into the rubrics of the Mass. Immediately, after the blessing, the priest goes to the Gospel side of the altar. He begins with the "Dominus vobiscum" as at the proclamation of the Gospel of the Mass. But, since he reads from the altar card, he makes a sign of the cross with his right thumb on the altar rather than on the Gospel text before signing his own forehead, lips, and chest. At the words "Et Verbum caro factum est" (And the word became flesh), the priest genuflects.
The text of the Gospel is perhaps best known for its opening lines:
The third Mass on Christmas (where this same Gospel is the Gospel of the Mass) has no Last Gospel; before 1954, the Gospel of Epiphany would be used here. Also, a superseded Mass (e. g. if a feast of a Saint is superseded by a Sunday) could be commemorated by, among other things, having its Gospel as Last Gospel.

15 cm hrubá houfnice vz. 25

The 15 cm hrubá houfnice vz. 25 (Heavy howitzer model 25) was a Czech heavy howitzer used in the Second World War. It was taken into Wehrmacht service as the 15 cm sFH 25(t). Slovakia had 126 in inventory.
Design & History.
Intended to replace the various Austro-Hungarian heavy howitzer that the Czechs had inherited, they began a program to develop a new howitzer shortly after achieving independence in 1919. It didn't reflect many of the lessons of World War I as it retained a box trail and wooden wheels suitable only for horse traction. Its carriage broke down into two loads for transport. It fired a shell.

Springfield Town Center

Springfield Town Center is a shopping center currently under redevelopment in Springfield, Virginia. It opened in 1973 as Springfield Mall, an enclosed shopping mall, which closed on June 30, 2012 as part of a multi-million dollar redevelopment plan to turn it into an multifaceted "Town Center"-style shopping center with a main indoor area similar to the nearby Tysons Corner Center and Dulles Towne Center, while transforming the exterior into a pedestrian friendly environment with restaurants with cafe style outdoor seating and entrances. It is located at the intersection of Interstate 95 and Franconia Road (Route 644), which is part of the Springfield Interchange, 1/4 mile north of Franconia-Springfield Parkway (State Route 289) and the Franconia-Springfield (Washington Metro) metro station. It is scheduled to open in the summer of 2014.
Original anchors were Lansburgh's (later E.J. Korvette), Garfinckel's (later Sports Authority), J.C. Penney, and Montgomery Ward (building demolished in 1999, site now Target). Macy's was added in 1991.
Prince Charles and Princess Diana visited the JCPenney store at the mall on November 11, 1985, during their famous American tour.
One of the largest malls in Northern Virginia, it was owned and operated by Vornado Realty Trust. In 2005, Vornado purchased an option valued at $36 million to buy the mall from the previous owners Franconia Two LP. In early 2006, Vornado purchased the mall for an additional $80 million along with plans to redevelop. Renovations were last completed in 1987, and by the time the mall closed they were needed again. By 2010 Vornado was no longer even attempting to rent stores in the mall to new tenants and as large sections of stores at Springfield Mall closed, they were simply walled over with drywall and forgotten.
In March 2012, Vornado announced plans to close all but the three anchor stores starting on July 1, ahead of the two-year renovation and redevelopment, which is part of a decade-long plan intended to turn the Mall and its surrounding area into the new Springfield Town Center.
Demolition.
Demolition of Springfield Mall was started on Monday November 26, 2012, at external entrance number 2. As of December 31, 2012, almost all of entrances 1, 2, and the former Sports Authority store has been demolished.

K's Merchandise Mart

K's Merchandise Mart, Inc. (usually known as simply K's Merchandise) was a catalog showroom department store based in Decatur, Illinois. It offered furniture, jewelry, and general merchandise, including electronics, at 17 locations in 5 Midwestern states at the time of its closing.
K's was founded in 1957 by Raymond "Ray" Eldridge Sr. and his brother Kay. However, by the 2000s, competition from big box stores had eroded K's sales for years, though it had 17 locations in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, and Kentucky. Boston's Gordon Brothers Group took over the company from the original family, appointing Bill Weinstein as president. After an attempt at turning around the stores' operations, K's announced on 3 October 2006 that it would liquidate and close to pay off its creditors in full.
K's Merchandise also operated four chain stores by the name of "Bargain's Only", and had locations in Mt Zion, Champaign, Springfield and Peoria, Illinois. These stores closely resembled a TJ Maxx style offering, with clothing, household goods and furniture. They closed in front of their parent stores, with the final store closing in October 2006 in Mt. Zion.

Nasty Boys (TV series)

The Nasty Boys is a television action drama series based on the real life Narcotics Officers of the North Las Vegas Police Department.
Background.
The innovative cops were known locally as the NTNB which stood for the North Town Narcotics Bureau but quickly were nicknamed the North Town "Nasty Boys" by the local drug dealers because of the unit's all black hooded raid uniforms and their quick breeching methods for serving search warrants. The unit caught the attention of the producers of "The Reporters" while they were in Las Vegas for an unrelated show. It was the practice of the unit at the time to allow the local press to ride with them and tape their raids and "Reversals", that's where the cops take over a drug sales location and then pretend to be the drug sellers busting the arriving buyers one by one. Then with the help of the local NBC affiliate would air the bust on the 11:00 p.m. news with the opening, "The Nasty Boys shut down another drug sales location at ..." The Reporters aired a segment showcasing the Nasty Boys serving warrants and speaking their "Say No To Drugs" presentation to local adult and children's organizations. 
Two of the undercover narcotics officers began the anti-drug presentations with a rap song, BUSTED, written by one of the officers and sung by three of them, this was followed by t-shirts that read, "BUSTED by the Nasty Boys" and another showing a photo of the hooded team with the caption "We Make House Calls!" the NBC affiliate KVBC produced several award winning anti drug Public Service Announcements that featured real life footage of the Nasty Boys making busts and one featured the North Las Vegas Chief of Police looking into the camera, with the heavily armed team behind him, saying, "If you sell drugs in North Las Vegas, we'll be knocking at your door."
Synopsis and broadcast history.
Producer Dick Wolf, of "Miami Vice" fame, noticed the Nasty Boys and proposed to the two North Las Vegas Narcotics Officers who had produced the anti-drug song that a television show to be released by Universal Studios, and broadcast on the NBC network. The two officers agreed and provided stories to the writers, were technical advisors and acted in the pilot and several episodes. A pilot episode was aired as a TV movie September 21, 1989, and 13 episodes aired as a mid-season replacement show. The show was very popular with a small cult following but the Universal Studios-produced "Nasty Boys" was not renewed because that same year, NBC had begun producing many of their own television shows and only renewed one non-NBC production that year.
"The Nasty Boys" featured a North Las Vegas Police narcotics unit consisting of six undercover police officers who fought crime in drug-ridden neighborhoods using “unorthodox” methods. The show starred Benjamin Bratt, Don Franklin, Craig Hurley, Jeff Kaake, James Pax, and Dennis Franz, who played Lieutenant Stan Krieger. William Russ played Lieutenant Farlow in the pilot movie and was killed off unexpectedly. 
Basil Poledouris composed most of the episode scores.
The theme song was "Nasty" by Janet Jackson, though the song was performed by Lisa Keith and the lyrics were changed to fit the TV series.
Cast.
Jimmy Jackson and Larry Bradley were technical advisors/actors

Defendens

Saint Defendens of Thebes () is venerated as a martyr by the Catholic Church. Venerated as a soldier-saint, Defendens was, according to Christian tradition, a member of the Theban Legion, and thus martyred at Agaunum. 
Particular veneration for Defendens was widespread in Northern Italy; evidence for this cult dates from as early as 1328. His feast day was celebrated in the cities of Chivasso, Casale Monferrato, Novara, and Lodi on January 2, and oratories, altars, and confraternities were dedicated to him. He also enjoyed veneration in Marseilles; the "Catholic Encyclopedia" states that “several saints belong in a particular way to Marseilles: the soldier St. Victor, martyr under Maximian; the soldier St. Defendens and his companions, martyrs at the same time...” But as Antonio Borrelli writes, some scholars believe that the Defendens venerated in Italy is different from the martyr who was a member of the Theban Legion.
Veneration.
There is an oratory dedicated to him at Solto Collina. There is also a church dedicated to him at Clusone, the church of , and another at Invorio.
Until 1476 his relics, according to the 1578 "Martyrologium Sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae" of Pietro Galesino, were kept in the church of Santa Croce in Casale Monferrato, which suggested that his martyrdom may have taken place in that region.
The painter Defendente Ferrari, born at Chivasso, where Defendens was venerated, thus carries the baptismal name of this martyr.

Ramon d'Abella

Ramon d'Abella (fl. 1389–1401) was a Catalan military leader and royal councillor under John I and Martin of the Crown of Aragon.
During the "guerra dels armanyaguesos" in 1389, Ramon led a regiment of cavalry in the area around Torroella de Montgrí and Palafrugell. The young poet Guillem de Masdovelles fought under Ramon in these campaigns against Bernard VII of Armagnac and composed a "sirventesch" dedicated to him. It was probably sometime before this war that Ramon had a falling out with Guerau de Queralt i de Rocabertí.
In 1392 Ramon purchased the castle of Solivella and its jurisdiction, both high and low, for 16,500 Aragonese "sous" from John I. From 1395 to 1397 and again from 1398 to 1401 he served as governor of the Kingdom of Majorca. His lieutenant was Berenguer de Montagut.

Carol Plum-Ucci

Carol Plum-Ucci ( in Atlantic City, New Jersey) is a young adult novelist and essayist. Plum-Ucci’s most famous work to date is "The Body of Christopher Creed", for which she won a Michael L. Printz Award in 2002 and was named a Finalist to the Edgar Allan Poe Award. Describing her subjects as "the most common, timeless, and most heart-felt teenagers," Plum-Ucci is widely recognized for her use of the South Jersey shore to set scenes for engaging characters embracing suspense themes.
Growing up.
As Plum-Ucci grew up she knew she wanted to write books. The Body of Christopher Creed was her "cloud song."
Plum-Ucci grew up on the barrier island of Brigantine, New Jersey, where she attended the public schools until the age of thirteen. She then went to Atlantic City Friends’ School, where her grandmother, Neva Ingersoll, taught advanced high school mathematics. She graduated from Holy Spirit High School in 1975. Her father, Neil Plum, and her paternal grandmother, Ads Plum, partnered in the funeral business, owning Plum Funeral Homes in Brigantine, Atlantic City, and Ventnor. Plum-Ucci largely attributes her writer’s imagination to lying awake at night, above the Brigantine funeral parlor, listening to the sounds downstairs.
She received her bachelor’s in communication from Purdue University in 1979. She served as feature editor of the "Purdue Exponent", a two-year post. After Purdue, Plum-Ucci was a freelance writer in the Chicago area for several years. She became Assistant to the Producer of the Miss America Pageant in Atlantic City in 1984. She later served as Staff Writer and Director of Publications of the Miss America Organization and Miss America Scholarship Foundation, producing up to a dozen publications a year for volunteers and participants. Plum-Ucci retired in 1999, two months after receiving her first advance on royalties from The Body of Christopher Creed from Harcourt—the first novel she sold.
She has been a resident of Absecon, New Jersey.

Shrink–swell capacity

The shrink-swell capacity of clay refers to the extent to which a clay will expand when wet and retract when dry. Soil that is problematic due to high capacity is known as shrink-swell soil, or expansive soil.
Description.
Due to the physical and chemical properties of some clays (such as the Lias Group) large swelling occurs when water is absorbed. Conversely when the water dries up these clays contract (shrink).
Problems.
Clay groups with a high shrink-swell capacity tend to damage crops during dry spells, as the soil contracts, pulling roots apart. Additionally in wet periods expansion of the clay can lead to ground heave, which can damage the foundations of buildings.

Crusty Bunkers

Crusty Bunker, or the Crusty Bunkers, was the collective pseudonym of group of comic book inkers clustered around Neal Adams' and Dick Giordano's New York City-based art and design agency Continuity Studios from 1972-1977. The group was also occasionally credited as Ilya Hunch, Chuck Bunker, or The Goon Squad. Many of the Crusty Bunkers went on to individual careers in the industry.
History.
According to former member Alan Weiss, the name "Crusty Bunker" was first coined by Continuity Studios co-principal Neal Adams in relation to his children. "It was like calling someone a name that wasn't really dirty. . . . It didn't really mean anything, it just sounded good."
There were over 60 artists who at one time or another were Crusty Bunker members. The core group consisted of artists who rented space at Continuity or worked up front in the advertising studio itself. Continuity would get the assignment, someone with experience (usually Adams or Giordano) would ink the faces and main figures, then pass it around for everyone to work on it, until the whole thing was completed. Comic book titles that the collective worked on included Marvel's "Red Sonja" and "Marvel Premiere", the Marvel black-and-white magazine titles "Dracula Lives!", "Tales of the Zombie", and "Monsters Unleashed"; and DC's "Sword of Sorcery".
Former Crusty Bunker Larry Hama recounted, "If a job was incredibly late, then the Crusty Bunkers would gather together half-a-dozen to a dozen inkers and... turn out a whole book in a day or two, all under the supervision of Neal . It was a whirl. Guys would be passing pages back and forth. Guys would be standing over boards filling in blacks upside down while somebody was rendering a face at the bottom of the page."
This period was one of transition in the comics industry, as DC Comics had been toppled from comics dominance by Marvel Comics. In an attempt to revitalize its brand, DC made a concerted effort to entice young artists, including from this talent pool. As many of the Crusty Bunkers began getting regular comics work, they discontinued working in the group's collaborative fashion. The collective was effectively disbanded in 1977, although Adams resurrected the name for some of the comics put out by his own publishing company, Continuity Comics, from 1985-1993.
Art style.
Although directed (and often worked on directly) by Adams, the Crusty Bunkers inking style was not a clone of Adams' individual work. Their early published work showed a herky-jerky, jumble of styles that revealed the work of multiple hands . Within about a year, however (in response to the demand from publishers for a homogenous look), the Crusty Bunkers had developed a true "house style," with only hints of the individual styles that the respective artists later became known for. This house style was more rough-hewn than similar work by Adams.

Abdur Rashid Kardar

Abdur Rashid Kardar (1904–1989), often abbreviated as A.R. Kardar, was a pre-partition Lahore-born actor and later director. He is credited as establishing the film industry in the Bhati Gate locality of Lahore, British India (now in Pakistan).
Biography.
Solemn beginnings.
Kardar started as an arts scholar and a calligraphist making posters for foreign film productions and writing for newspapers of the early 1920s. His work would often lead him to meet filmmakers around India.
In 1924, the first silent film, "The Daughters of Today" was released in Lahore at a time when the city only had nine operational cinema houses. Most of the films shown in theatres in Lahore were either made in Bombay or Calcuta, besides ones made in Hollywood or London. "The Daughters of Today" was the brain-child of G.K. Mehta, a former officer with the North-Western Railway, who had imported a camera into the country for this very project from London. He asked Kardar to assist him as an assistant director on the project and ended up giving Kardar his début role in his film as an actor. Muhammad Ismail, his friend and fellow calligraphist, accompanied Kardar in the making of the film.
The film was produced in the first open studio in the city near the Bradlaw Hall. It is believed that some other films had been produced indigenously at the studios which had to be closed down due to unsaid financial reasons. After finishing shooting for the film, Kardar was left with no other role and was neither approached for one for a long time. Hailing from the Bhati Gate locality, where it was not unusual to find writers and poets, Kardar saw a viable future for a film industry.
Foundations for a film industry.
In 1928, with no work left after their maiden venture, Kardar and Ismail sold their belongings to set up a studio and production company under the name of "United Players Corporation", the foundation stone for the film industry in Lahore. After scouting for locations, they settled for their offices to be established at Ravi Road. Although, the dim-lit area presented with much difficulties after the studios were established. Shootings were only possible in the day-light but nevertheless the area had some very important landmarks like the Ravi Forest and the tombs of Mughal emperor Jahangir and his wife Nur Jahan.
It is reported that the team working at the studios would commute on tangas and even lost equipment once while traveling on the bumpy roads on the horse-drawn carriage. However basic and crude their working conditions, Kardar believed in his work and in 1930 he produced the first film under the studio's banner.
With this film, "Husn Ka Daku" aka "Mysterious Eagle", Kardar made his first directorial début. He also cast himself as an actor in the male lead opposite Gulzar Begum with Ismail in a supporting role. The film featured an American actor, Iris Crawford, as well. The film had mild success at theatres but prominently established Lahore as a functioning film industry. Kardar vowed on not acting in any other film and instead focusing on direction.
Immediately afterwards the studio released the film "Sarfarosh" aka "Brave Heart", with Gul Hameed playing the lead rold with more or less the same cast as in the previous film. This production proved equally appealing but was able to stir noise about this industry in film production circles throughout India. Roop Lal Shori, a resident of Brandreth Road in Lahore, upon hearing of a new film industry in the city, returned to his hometown. He later produced "Qismat Ke Her Pher" aka "Life After Death" which would firmly ground the new industry's reputation as being in line with other film industries of the time.

2008–09 Primera División A season

The format for the 2008-09 season changed from 2 groups of 12 to 3 groups of 9 teams. This gave the opportunity and the number increased from 24 to 27, many teams served as reserve teams from teams in D1.
Changes for the 2008-2009 season.
Added teams
Torneo Apertura.
The Primera División A Apertura 2008 is a Mexican football tournament, one of two short tournaments held each year. It began on July 18, 2008 and ran until December 7, 2008. The reigning champions, León, were eliminated in the quarterfinals by Irapuato on a 2–1 two-leg aggregate, and thus could not successfully defend their "Clausura 2008" title. Querétaro won the tournament, defeating Irapuato on a 2–0 two-leg aggregate, and will earn a spot into the promotional playoff held after the end of the "Clausura 2009" season, where the winners of the two tournaments meet in an effort to gain promotion to the "Primera División".
After winning the 2008 promotional playoff against León, the "Indios" (Indians) of Ciudad Juárez were promoted to the Primera División. The "Tiburones Rojos" (red sharks) of Veracruz were relegated to the "Primera División A" due to finishing at the bottom of the "Primera División" relegation table. Pachuca Juniors won the right to be promoted to the "Primera División A" after winning the "Segunda División" promotional playoff but lacked the certificate of promotion given to teams by the Federación Mexicana de Fútbol Asociación (FMF). Instead, the "Freseros" of Irapuato were promoted to the "Primera División A", and two new reserve teams were created for the "Indios" of Ciudad Juárez (the "Indios" of Chihuahua) and Atlante (the "Potros" of Chetumal).
Tournament Format.
A total of 27 teams are divided into three groups of nine teams each. Each team plays the other eight teams in its group twice, once at home and once away, for a total of 16 games. At the end of the regular season the top two teams in each group, as well as the next two highest placed teams, qualify to the "Liguilla" (playoffs). The teams are seeded based on their position in the general table and are arranged before each round so that the highest seeded team remaining always plays the lowest seed remaining. The teams play a home and home series and whichever team has the better aggregate score advances. If the two teams are tied after both legs in the quarterfinals and semifinals the higher seed advances automatically. In the finals, if the two teams are tied after both legs two 15 minute halves of extra time are added. If the teams are still tied after extra time the champion is determined through a penalty shootout.
Promotion.
One team is promoted to the "Primera División" each year (two short tournaments). After the "Clausura 2009" tournament, the champions of the "Apertura 2008" and "Clausura 2009" tournaments will play a home and home series to determine which team will be promoted. If the same team wins both tournaments it will be promoted automatically. In order for a team to be promoted it has to obtain a certification from the Federación Mexicana de Fútbol Asociación. If the winner of the promotional final is not certified for promotion a home and home series is played between the highest placed certified team and the club being relegated to the "Primera División A" to determine which will be in the "Primera División".
Relegation.
One team is relegated to the "Segunda División" each year (two short tournaments). The team that has the worst points to games played ratio over the previous three years ("Apertura 2006", "Clausura 2007", "Apertura 2007", "Clausura 2008", Apertura 2008, "Clausura 2009") is relegated to the "Segunda División".

Isabel suffers from diabetes. While she does not have a meek personality, ever since the death of her parents, she is easily manipulated by her sister Clara. Clara lives tormented with the thought that she will never marry, since in that small town, the only bachelor is her sister's fiance, Leandro, who initiates an uncontrollable passion in her.
The wedding between Isabel and Leandro is postponed because he must make an important business trip. Clara attempts to persuade him to call off the wedding saying that Isabel only has a short time to live, but he refuses to listen. On the contrary, Leandro and Isabel agree to spend the last night together before he leaves for the trip. They decide to meet in the stable, but Clara finds out. Along with her faithful servant, Andres, Clara plans an accident so that Isabel never makes it to the date. Instead Clara goes to the dark stable, with Isabel's perfume and dressed like her. Leandro, who has drank some drinks, spends the night with Clara. Isabel feels betrayed when she sees them together.

Clara then asks a dying cousin to leave her newborn baby under her and Leandro's care. The cousin dies after making Leandro swear that he will be like a father to the baby. However, the baby also dies and Clara replaces her with the daughter of Andres, her servant. The baby is named Fabiola.
Isabel gives birth to a baby girl and names her Ana, but Isabel dies in a car accident when Ana is a young girl.

Carol Kalish

Carol Kalish (February 14, 1955 – September 5, 1991) was an American writer, editor, comic book retailer, and sales manager. She worked as Direct Sales Manager and Vice President of New Product Development at Marvel Comics from 1981 to 1991. She is credited with pioneering the American comics direct market when it was in its adolescence, in part through a program wherein Marvel helped pay for comic book stores to acquire cash registers. She was the winner of an Inkpot Award in 1991, and in 2010 was posthumously awarded the first ComicsPRO Industry Appreciation Award, beating nominees such as Will Eisner, Julius Schwartz and Phil Seuling.
Early life.
Kalish had a sister named Candace. She graduated from Radcliffe College with Honors in Geography and a specialty in History. 
Kalish was a childhood friend of writer Paul Dini, who credits her with introducing her to the character Wonder Woman when they were children.
Career.
Kalish worked as a comic book retailer and wholesaler. Her first work in circulation was two years as Circulation Manager on the science fiction publication "Galileo". This led to the position as assistant editor on a line of comic books with New Media Publishing, and later Marvel, where she began working at 1981, having been hired by Ed Shukin, Marvel’s Vice President in charge of sales.
She was known as Marvel's "Mistress of Propaganda," and "discovered" Alex Ross and Peter David, who worked with Kalish as Assistant Sale Manager in Marvel Comics' Sales Department, along with Sandy Schechter. 
Beginning in the mid-1980s, Kalish spearheaded the expansion of the Marvel's distribution into theretofore unexplored retail outlets, including major bookstores such as B. Daltons and Waldenbooks.
Kalish also conducted numerous trips to comic book shops during the course of her work and on her vacation time, during which she would offer advice to retailers on how to improve their stores. During these visits, Kalish consistently observed the absence of cash registers on the part of retailers, and was inspired to originate Marvel's cash register program, with which the company would subsidize, at bulk cost, registers for retailers, which is credited with positively affecting the level of professionalism of the direct market. 
According to a March 2010 piece by retailer and Comic Book Resources columnist Brian Hibbs: 
Once upon a time Marvel, under Carol's DM sales team, was the most DM-friendly publisher. The cash register program, rack credits via the IADD, effective and scrupulous solicitations, these were all things that happened under Carol's watch. In fact, I'll still always remember being 16 years old, working at another person's store, and Carol was in town for a vacation, and she took the time to come in and make a half-dozen practical and direct suggestions as to how that store could be made better; not specifically for Marvel, but just a better store in general. That was a powerful memory for me, and the lessons that Carol taught us have stuck with me all of these years later. I thought, "that's how I want to be when I grow up", and I am, frankly, personally embarrassed that current Marvel management isn't willing to live up to her legacy, and engage the people who sell their comics for them, and represent them to the buying public.
Kalish also set the official Marvel direct sales policy regarding retailer orders of back issue stock, emphasizing to retailers that they should order only what they could sell within a month’s time, and not order additional copies intended solely for back stock, as this would merely tie up their money. Although this was considered "heresy" at the time, Kalish advised retailers that was far wiser to keep capital available for the flow of new comics coming into stores.
It was during Kalish's tenure in Marvel Sales that copies of the company's adaptation of the 1983 film "" was discovered by actor Mark Hamill on sale a month prior to the release of the film. After Hamill alerted Lucasfilm, Marvel, according to Kalish, swiftly recalled the book off the stands. Though none of the three people in the Sales Department were fired over the incident, it resulted in premature revelation of the secrets of the film's plot.
During the last year or so of her life, Kalish developed a line of religious books, Civil War comics, and "greeting card" comics to expand Marvel's market. She was also preparing to leave Marvel to start her own publishing firm.
Personal life.
Kalish's long-time boyfriend was writer/artist Richard Howell.
Death and legacy.
Kalish died on September 5, 1991 from a brain aneurysm, at the age 36.
Tributes to Kalish were generally complimentary, including a Peter David-written eulogy in the "Comics Buyer's Guide", in which he credited her with making him a comics industry professional, and a memorial service arranged by Marvel Comics president Terry Stewart. The outpouring of grief seen in the letters pages of "CBG" was theretofore unprecedented.
Fantagraphics publisher Gary Groth, however, was less effusive. Although respectful of Kalish's personal qualities, Groth considers that these were not always used for the best of purposes: "Kalish, who I have no reason to believe was anything other than decent and personable in her personal relations, devoted her professional life to expanding the hegemonic power of a corporation that already owns all the distributors and most of the retailers..." Groth's piece led to outrage on the part of Kalish's friend and former co-worker, writer Peter David, who named his youngest daughter after Kalish, and found Groth's piece to be "vicious", and retaliated by parodying Groth as Louis Lance, a snobbish publisher of the only comics he considers to be "true art", who looks down on superhero comics published by large, work-for-hire companies, in a fictitious panel discussion that David ran in "Snob Appeal", an edition of his then-weekly column, "But I Digress..." in "Comics Buyer's Guide". David also took issue with attacks on Kalish by Mile High Comics retailer and columnist Chuck Rozanski.
When Glenn Hauman, the webmaster of David's website, reprinted David's eulogy to Kalish on David's site in 2002, along with a request to the site's visitors to link heavily to the post in order to displace Groth's 1991 piece as the top search result on Google, "Comics Journal" online editor Dirk Deppey defended Groth's 1991 piece, saying that it was directed not at Kalish personally, but at her work and the outpouring of grief on the part of "CBG" letter writers and David himself, which Groth and Deppey perceived as "beatification", trite and inarticulate.
In 2010, Kalish was awarded the first ComicsPRO Industry Appreciation Award in the posthumous category, a "Hall of Fame"-type award that was created to honor behind-the-scenes publishing personnel for helping to promote the comics market, beating fellow nominees Will Eisner, Phil Seuling and Julius Schwartz. The award was accepted by Richard Howell on her behalf. Though Howell was not present at the ceremony, writer/editor Paul Levitz read a statement by Howell, who stated that Kalish's goal was "to make the direct market as strong as it could be".

World Trade Center (Colombo)

The World Trade Center (also known as WTC Colombo or WTCC) is the tallest completed building in Sri Lanka. Standing over from the ground, it ranks as the third tallest twin tower in South Asia. WTCC runs under the management of Overseas Realty Ceylon plc (better known as ORCPLC). ORCPLC is a part of Mireka Capital Land (pvt) Ltd which owns the Havelock City Project, one of the largest residential projects in Asia. 
History.
The WTCC was opened on 12 October, 1997 by the former Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga. The centre consists of two identical 40-storey east and west towers.
In the later years of the Sri-Lankan civil war, the LTTE atttempted a 9-11 copycat attempt to crash a plane into the towers. However, the attack failed as the plane was shot down.

St. Denys Priory, Southampton

St. Denys Priory was a priory of Austin canons in the St Denys area of Southampton, Hampshire, England.
Foundation.
The priory was founded by Henry I in 1124. The foundation charter granted 
to God and the church of St. Denis and the canons serving God there, for the health of his soul and of the souls of his father and mother, Maud his wife and William his son, a parcel of land between Portswood and the Itchen, having a rental of 11s. 6d., together with another parcel of land near the sea to the east of the borough, having a rental of 41s. 6d.
A canon named Girard was named in the foundation charter and is assumed to have become the first prior.
12th to 16th centuries.
In 1338 the town of Southampton was sacked and burnt by the French. The town took a long time to recover and as late as April, 1385 protection was granted to the priory of St. Denis and its possessions, because so much of its property had been burnt and destroyed that the costs of repairing the tenements and contributing to the fortification of the town had placed the priory deeply in debt and it did not have the means to pay pensions and corrodies or to maintain the canons. 
The priory held the free chapel of the Blessed Mary which was a place of pilgrimage known as St. Mary of Graces. Henry VIII visited it in 1510 and made an offering in person of 6s. 8d..
By the time of the dissolution the priory held various possessions in Southampton, including the manor of St. Denis, and pensions from the churches of the Holyrood, All Saints, St. Lawrence and St. Michael's. In Hampshire it held the:
Dissolution.
The priory was suppressed in 1536. According to the Valor Ecclesiasticus its annual value was £80 11s. 6d.. There were nine canons and the prior at that time. The prior received a pension of £13 6s. 8d. and the chapel of the Blessed Mary with its appurtenances for life.
Post-Dissolution.
In 1538 the site and some of the possessions of the priory were granted to Francis Dautry.
Present day.
Only fragments of the priory buildings remain, one wall in a private garden in Priory Road, and a small archway re-sited in the garden of the Tudor House Museum. The present church is late Victorian and holds a few tiles and a coffin from the original site.

Malankara Catholic Youth Movement (MCYM) is the official organization of the youth in Syro-Malankara Catholic Church. The Kerala Catholic Youth Movement was officially inaugurated on December 28, 1978 in the special senate held at Mannam, Kottayam. Although there were some youth organisations in the parish level at different parts of Kerala, the spread of the organization of the youth movements in the diocesan took place rather late.
Different stages of growth.
MCYM acts in unit/regional/ecclesiastical district/mission centres/diocese/ archdiocese/church. MCYM works in parish units, in regional or ecclesiastical districts, in mission centres, in eparchies or archieparhies, in the Church as a whole .
The following is a brief description of the permanent action-plan of the central body, developed during the past fifteen years. It organizes six major activities in a year.
National Meet/Global Meet, Annual Senate.
National Meet, Annual Senate, Directors’ Meet are organized in the month of May from 2004 onwards and now it is conducted as global meet.
2008 
Youth conventions.
Along with the Re-union celebrations, the youth convention is being conducted in September and it commences with the Flaming Light Procession, and Flag Procession.
The youth conventions are conducted under the leadership of the central body and each eparchial unit.
Commemoration of Mar Ivanios.
On the day before the commemoration of the late Archbishop Mar Ivanios, the founder of Malankara Re-union Movement, the MCYM conducts memorial meetings at the tomb of Mar Ivanios.
MCYM Day - October.
The Sunday close to the Feast of St. Francis Assisi is celebrated as the MCYM Day in the units.

<doc id="18309949" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18309949" title="Drainage system (geomorphology)">
Drainage system (geomorphology)

In geomorphology, a drainage system is the pattern formed by the streams, rivers, and lakes in a particular drainage basin. They are governed by the topography of the land, whether a particular region is dominated by hard or soft rocks, and the gradient of the land. Geomorphologists and hydrologists often view streams as being part of drainage basins. A drainage basin is the topographic region from which a stream receives runoff, throughflow, and groundwater flow. Drainage basins are divided from each other by topographic barriers called a watershed. A watershed represents all of the stream tributaries that flow to some location along the stream channel. The number, size, and shape of the drainage basins found in an area varies and the larger the topographic map, the more information on the drainage basin is available.
Drainage patterns.
According to the configuration of the channels, drainage systems can fall into one of several categories known as drainage patterns. Drainage patterns depend on the topography and geology of the land.
Accordant drainage patterns.
A drainage system is described as accordant if its pattern correlates to the structure and relief of the landscape over which it flows.
Dendritic drainage pattern.
Dendritic drainage systems (from Greek , "dendrites", "of or pertaining to a tree") are the most common form of drainage system. In a dendritic system, there are many contributing streams (analogous to the twigs of a tree), which are then joined together into the tributaries of the main river (the branches and the trunk of the tree, respectively). They develop where the river channel follows the slope of the terrain. Dendritic systems form in V-shaped valleys; as a result, the rock types must be impervious and non-porous.
Parallel drainage pattern.
A parallel drainage system is a pattern of rivers caused by steep slopes with some relief. Because of the steep slopes, the streams are swift and straight, with very few tributaries, and all flow in the same direction. This system forms on uniformly sloping surfaces, for example, rivers flowing southeast from the Aberdare Mountains in Kenya.
Parallel drainage patterns form where there is a pronounced slope to the surface. A parallel pattern also develops in regions of parallel, elongate landforms like outcropping resistant rock bands. Tributary streams tend to stretch out in a parallel-like fashion following the slope of the surface. A parallel pattern sometimes indicates the presence of a major fault that cuts across an area of steeply folded bedrock. All forms of transitions can occur between parallel, dendritic, and trellis patterns.
Trellis drainage pattern.
The geometry of a trellis drainage system is similar to that of a common garden trellis used to grow vines. As the river flows along a strike valley, smaller tributaries feed into it from the steep slopes on the sides of mountains. These tributaries enter the main river at approximately 90 degree angles, causing a trellis-like appearance of the drainage system. Trellis drainage is characteristic of folded mountains, such as the Appalachian Mountains in North America.
Rectangular drainage pattern.
Rectangular drainage develops on rocks that are of approximately uniform resistance to erosion, but which have two directions of jointing at approximately right angles. The joints are usually less resistant to erosion than the bulk rock so erosion tends to preferentially open the joints and streams eventually develop along the joints. The result is a stream system in which streams consist mainly of straight line segments with right angle bends and tributaries join larger streams at right angles.
Radial drainage pattern.
In a radial drainage system, the streams radiate outwards from a central high point. Volcanoes usually display excellent radial drainage. Other geological features on which radial drainage commonly develops are domes and laccoliths. On these features the drainage may exhibit a combination of radial patterns.
Centripetal drainage pattern.
Centripetal drainage systems are similar to radial drainage systems except the rivers flow in the opposite direction. They drain from the sides of hills to a central depression where a lake is formed. This is common in western and south-western US, where centripetal drainage systems form intermittent lakes. These lakes leave behind salt flats when they evaporate during dry seasons.
Deranged drainage pattern.
A deranged drainage system is a drainage system in drainage basins where there is no coherent pattern to the rivers and lakes. It happens in areas where there has been much geological disruption. The classic example is the Canadian Shield. During the last ice age, the topsoil was scraped off, leaving mostly bare rock. The melting of the glaciers left land with many irregularities of elevation, and a great deal of water to collect in the low points, explaining the large number of lakes which are found in Canada. The watersheds are young and are still sorting themselves out. Eventually the system will stabilize.
Annular drainage pattern.
In an annular drainage pattern streams follow a roughly circular or concentric path along a belt of weak rock, resembling in plan a ringlike pattern. It is best displayed by streams draining a maturely dissected structural dome or basin where erosion has exposed rimming sedimentary strata of greatly varying degrees of hardness, as in the Red Valley, which nearly encircles the domal structure of the Black Hills of South Dakota.
Angular drainage pattern.
Angular drainage patterns form where bedrock joints and faults intersect at more acute angles than rectangular drainage patterns. Angles are both more and less than 90 degrees.
Discordant drainage patterns.
A drainage pattern is described as discordant if it does not correlate to the topology and geology of the area. Discordant drainage patterns are classified into two main types: antecedent and superimposed. Anteposition drainage patterns combine the two.

Culture of Sindh

The Culture of Sindh (سنڌي تهذيب) has its roots in the Indus Valley Civilization. Sindh has been shaped by the geography of the largely desert region, the natural resources it had available and the continuous foreign influences. The Indus or Sindhu River that passes through the land, and the Arabian Sea (that defines its borders) also supported the seafaring traditions among the local people. The local climate also reflects why the Sindhis have the language, folklore, traditions, customs and lifestyle that are so different from the neighbouring regions. Sindhi culture is also practiced by the Sindhi diaspora.
History.
The roots of Sindhi culture and civilization go back to the distant past. Archaeological researches during 19th and 20th centuries showed the roots of social life, religion and culture of the people of the Sindh: their agricultural practices, traditional arts and crafts, customs and tradition and other parts of social life, going back to a ripe and mature Indus Valley Civilization of the third millennium BC. Recent researches have traced the Indus valley civilization to even earlier ancestry.
Archaeological discoveries.
Archaeological discoveries sometimes help to unfold the certain latent aspects of a specific culture. The excavations of Mohen-Jo-Daro have unfolded the city life of a civilization of people with values, a distinct identity and culture. Therefore, the first definition of the Sindhi culture emanates from that over the 7000-year-old Indus Valley Civilization. This is the pre-Aryan period, about 3,000 years BC., when the urban civilization in Sindh was at its peak. In Sir Mortimer Wheeler's book, "Civilization of the Indus Valley and Beyond", it is said that; "Civilization, in a minimum sense of the term, is the art of living in towns, with all that the condition implies in respect of social skills and disciplines." When people speak of Sindhi civilization, they have to concern themselves, mainly with the material and concrete side of human habitation of which Sindhi culture is the only essence called the superstructure. The present day Sindh, along with the Northern part of the Indus Valley Civilization (around 3000 to 2500 BC) is located on its urban civilization. <br>
Ranikot Fort is also a landmark of the Indus valley civilization. It is the world's largest fort, with walls extending to 20 km. It has been called a "second Wall of China", and it attracts many visitors.
Literature.
History.
Sindhi language is ancient and rich in literature. Its writers have contributed extensively in various forms of literature in both poetry and prose. Sindhi literature is very rich, and is one of the world's oldest literatures. The earliest reference to Sindhi literature is contained in the writings of Arab historians. It is established that Sindhi was the first Eastern language into the Quran, when it was translated in the 8th or 9th century. There is evidence of Sindhi poets reciting their verses before the Muslim Caliphs in Baghdad. It is also recorded that treatises were written in Sindhi on astronomy, medicine and history during the 8th and 9th centuries.
Poetry.
Sindhi poetry is also prominent in Sindhi culture. Poetry of Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai. Sachal Sarmast is very famous amongst all of Pakistanis. Regional poets are Shaikh Ayaz, Ustaad Bhukhari, Ahmed Khan MAdhoosh, Adal Soomro,aakash ansari, Ayaz Gul, Abdul Ghaffar Tabasum, G.N.Qureshi, Rukhsana Preet, Waseem Soomro. Many Sindhi poets are doing their poetry work continuously.
Music.
Sindhi music has its own unique quality. It is performed in many different ways. Sufi music is performed at shrines, and other simple music is performed at studios and gatherings.
Sports.
There are many regional sports that are played in Sindh. Malakhiro is one of the famous sports of Sindh. Other sports include "Wanjh wati", "Kodi Kodi", "Beelarhoo", "Thipai Rand", "Notinn" and "Biloor","cricket","football".
Cultural Character.
The ancient Sindhi civilization was the place, where the aesthetic utilization of leisure was freely indulged. There has been evidence, that the excavations of sites dating back to 3000 BC (all over Sindh) is also true, around 1200 years ago when Jaina Dakshiniya Chihna (778 AD) described the distinguished features of Sindhis in this way: "Elegant, with a lovely, soft and slow gait, they are fond of the art of Gandharvas (that is, songs, music and dancing) and full affection towards their country."
Sindhi Cultural Day (Ekta Day).
Sindhis celebrate Sindh Cultural day world wide every year on December 8, by wearing Ajrak & Sindhi Topi. On that occasion, the musical programmes and rallies are held in many cities to mark the day with zeal.Major hallmarks of cities and towns are decorated with Sindhi Ajrak to highlight the cultural values of Sindh. The people across Sindh exchange gifts of Ajrak and Topi at various ceremonies.Even, the children and women are dressed up in Ajrak, assembling at the grand gathering, where famous Sindhi singers sing Sindhi songs, which depicts love and progress of Sindh. The musical performances of the artists compel the participants to dance on Sindhi tunes and ‘Jeay Sindh Jeay-Sindh Wara Jean’.
<br>All Political, social and religious organisations of Sindh, besides the Sindh culture department and administrations of various schools, colleges and universities, organize variety of events including seminars, debates, folk music programmes, drama and theatrics performances, tableau and literary sittings to mark this annual festivity. Sindhi culture, history and heritage are highlighted at the events.<br>
<br>Ekta (Unity) day is observed to display solidarity among the Sindhi-speaking masses, the event is celebrated not only in Karachi, but throughout Sindh. The province’s culture and unity day was celebrated for the first time on December 6, 2009 (as the Sindhi Topi Day) as a backlash to the comments of anchorman Dr Shahid Masood who had criticised President Asif Ali Zardari for wearing a Sindhi cap on his foreign tours. People across the Sindh province condemned Masood’s comments via SMS, which ultimately resulted in the announcement of celebrating the Sindhi Topi Day. Moreover, the KTN Group had started issuing a call for observing a unity day, and a large number of people responded to the call and started celebrating the culture and the unity days.Ever since, Sindhi media groups have started to celebrate the day as ‘Sindhi Cultural Day’ or 'Ekta day'.The Sindhi language TV channels including KTN, Sindh TV, Awaz TV and Mehran TV broadcast special programmes on the culture of Sindh , besides these media outlets separately arrange the mega musical events, which also attract large audience to celebrate the Culture Day every year. The Sindhi language TV channels and Political Parties of Sindh, first time celebrated Sindhi Cultural Day (Ekta Day), together on December 8th, 2013.

Billboard (magazine)

Billboard is an American music magazine, headquartered in New York City, New York and owned by Prometheus Global Media. It was first published on November 1, 1894, and is distinguished as being among the oldest trade magazines in the world. The magazine originally focused on bill posting and outdoor amusements before specializing in the music industry in the 1960s. "Billboard" maintains several internationally-recognized record charts, which track the most popular songs and albums across several categories on a weekly basis. Its primary charts, the "Billboard" Hot 100 and the "Billboard" 200, respectively rank the top songs and albums regardless of genre, and are based on digital downloads, radio airplay, and internet streaming. Its data is largely based on the Nielsen SoundScan tracking system, which it has used since 1991.
History.
"Billboard" was founded in Cincinnati on November 1, 1894, by William H. Donaldson and James Hennegan. Originally titled "Billboard Advertising" it was a trade paper for the bill posting industry, hence the magazine's name. Within a few years of its founding, it began to carry news of outdoor amusements, a major consumer of billboard space. Eventually "Billboard" became the paper of record for circuses, carnivals, amusement parks, fairs, vaudeville, minstrels, whale shows and other live entertainment. The magazine began coverage of motion pictures in 1909 and of radio in the 1920s. Though the first music connection was the Billboard sheet music best sellers charts & top songs in vaudeville theaters published in 1913 but it was not a regular chart yet.
With the development of the jukebox industry during the 1930s, "The Billboard" began publishing music charts. Originally, there were only three genre-specific charts: Pop, Rhythm & Blues, and Country & Western. In the 1950s it introduced a section covering the television industry, including ratings charts for programs. It continued to carry news of fairs, carnivals, theme parks and other outdoor entertainments until 1961 when these departments were spun off into a new weekly magazine called "Amusement Business". By this time the television coverage had also been moved to another publication.
At the start of 1961, "The Billboard" was renamed "Billboard Music Week". The publication was now devoted almost entirely to the music industry, with some coverage of coin-operated vending and entertainment machines on its jukebox pages. The title was changed to simply "Billboard" at the start of 1963. In 2005, the magazine and its web sites were repositioned to provide coverage of all forms of digital and mobile entertainment.
"Amusement Business" prospered for a few decades, but was struggling by the beginning of the 21st century. Shortly after then its frequency of publication was reduced to monthly, and it finally ceased publication following its May 2006 issue.
For many years, the weekly syndicated radio program "American Top 40", hosted by Casey Kasem (July 4, 1970 to August 6, 1988), and Shadoe Stevens (August 13, 1988 to January 28, 1995), played the top 40 songs on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in reverse order; in late November 1991, it switched to using the top 40 portion of the Hot 100 Airplay chart. Later, in early 1993, it began using the Top 40 Mainstream chart until it temporarily went off the air in 1995. When the show returned in 1998, it no longer used "Billboard" charts as its source, instead relying on Mediabase charts based purely on radio airplay.
A country music version of "American Top 40", called "American Country Countdown", has been on the air since October 1973. The show is hosted each week by Kix Brooks of the country duo Brooks & Dunn, who replaced radio legend Bob Kingsley in January 2006. "American Country Countdown" used the top 40 songs of the Hot Country Songs chart until August 2009.
Current operations.
Record charts.
"Billboard", then titled "The Billboard", published its first music hit parade on January 4, 1936; its first record chart was calculated on July 20, 1940. The "Billboard" Hot 100, which documents individual singles, was introduced on August 4, 1958; the "Billboard" 200, which ranks full music albums, was premiered on August 17, 1963. Today, the service provides over 100 charts, which are updated on a weekly basis.
Magazine publications.
Billboard Publications became a major trade magazine publisher, acquiring "The Hollywood Reporter", "Kirkus Reviews", "Adweek" and "Mediaweek". It was acquired by Dutch publisher VNU (later renamed the Nielsen Company) in 1993, but later sold in 2009 along with the other Nielsen Business Media properties to the new company e5 Global Media, which was renamed in 2010 to Prometheus Global Media.
"Billboard" is intended for music professionals, such as record label executives, artists, music retailers, and radio DJs. Although it is generally considered a business-to-business magazine, it can be found at many consumer bookstores and magazine stands, particularly in cities with a large music industry presence such as New York, Los Angeles, Nashville, Austin, and Miami. In January, 2014, it was announced that Janice Min, the editorial director for the "Hollywood Reporter", would add editorial duties at "Billboard" as co-president and chief creative officer of Guggenheim Media’s Entertainment Group. 
Much of the magazine is available at "Billboard"'s B2B site, Billboard.biz. Billboard.com is the consumer-centered site, and includes artist interviews, daily news and charts. The group behind the billboard has an imprint of the Crown Publishing Group (itself a part of Random House) known as Billboard Reads, which bought the imprint from Nielsen in 2008. The publishing agency describes itself as "a leading publisher of music and entertainment titles".
"Billboard" Music Awards.
The Billboard Music Award is an honor given by "Billboard", the preeminent publication covering the music business. The Billboard Music Awards show had been held annually in December until it went dormant in 2007, it returned in May 2011.

In 2012, Tanmoy Bhaduri first time breaks the structure of the magazine and published Teachers' Day issue of ZOO.com, this issue consists of several creative writings of zoology students'. Then Tanmoy had given the editorial batton to his classmate Sabarna Saraswati. Sabarna had done great job in publishing "ZOO.com Pujo Sankhya 2012". After facing a great success, Team ZOO.com had decided to publish Swamiji's 151st Birthday & Golden Jubilee of College Celebration Issue. On 5 January 2013 they published "ZOO.com : Swamiji's 151st Birth Anniversary & Golden Jubilee of Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Centenary College Issue" in presence of Professors & Vice-Principal, but on the same day ZOO.com had faced a censorship. The college officials asked the issue editor to remove more than three articles from that issue and they compelled to remove those at night because college authority claimed there were a shade of delhi rape case and one article was "anti establishment" which may hurt dignitaries in Golden Jubilee Celebration. On the next day Team ZOO.com determined to remove all pages of ZOO.com and many columnists quited from the magazine. This incident created an apathy among the readers and writers of ZOO.com.

Genki Rockets.
Genki Rockets, a virtual band produced by Tetsuya Mizuguchi from Q Entertainment and fellow musician Kenji Tamai from AgehasSprings, was once believed to consist mostly of unknown musical artists. The band's vocalist, Lumi, is a fictional 18-year old woman born on September 11, 2019, and is the first human being born in outer space. She has never been to planet Earth. Initially, it was believed that Lumi's voice was synthesized from at least two different female vocalists.
Upon the release of Genki Rocket's debut album, "Genki Rockets I - Heavenly Star" (released on July 2, 2008), it was revealed through the credits listed in the album's leaflet that Lumi's voice is dually provided by Rachel Rhodes and Japanese singer Nami Miyahara. Rhodes also acts in the role of Lumi visually, in Genki Rockets' music videos, album art, and in media accompanying the band's live performances.
Rhodes appears as Lumi in the 2011 video game "Child of Eden".
Her debut single is "Best of my Love" (released on July 3, 2013) produced by Kenji Tamai. It is an ending theme to "Space Battleship Yamato 2199".

List of Harukanaru Toki no Naka de Hachiyō Shō episodes

This page deals with the episodes from the Television Series.
Overview of the Series.
Twenty-six original episodes, plus eight omake endings and an animated movie have so far been produced for the Harukanaru Toki no Naka De original characters. Based loosely on the manga of the same name, the animated series follows the adventures of Motomiya Akane in Heian Kyou as she tries to help the ordinary people fight against the powerful Oni clan who seek dominance over the city once and for all. 
The series is split into vague arcs which also appear in the manga, although often in a slightly different manner. The arcs are as follows:
Though the ending is conclusive in terms of the plot, it is not conclusive in terms of who Akane chooses in relation to the Hachiyou. In keeping with the neoromance theme, eight endings that were Episode 1 Eisen Episode 2 Inori Episode 3 Shimon Morimura Episode 4 Fujiwara no Takamichi Episode 5 Tenma Morimura Episode 6 Tachibana no Tomomasa Episode 7 Abe no Seimei Episode 8 Minamoto no Yorihisa were produced, one for each Hachiyou, and added as extra features on the final Japanese DVD release. These endings allowed viewers to choose for themselves which of the Hachiyou - if any - Akane would select to be with at the close of the story. 
Since the production of the series, a movie adaptation, has been released in Japan. This movie features the same characters and basic canon as the animated series, but cannot be seen as a sequel because during it Akane is still trying to work out to what good use she can put her Ryuujin-given powers, and the story appears to have been set during Akane's fight with the Oni clan. The film introduces the new character Oono Suefumi, who does not appear in any of the animated episodes.
Episodes.
The twenty-six episode anime series has been licensed by Bandai Visual and will be released in a series of nine volumes under the title "HARUKA: Beyond the Stream of Time – A Tale of the Eight Guardians". A new volume will be released monthly with the first volume being released April 22, 2008 and the final volume due January 13, 2009.

<doc id="18310015" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18310015" title="Burning of Norfolk">
Burning of Norfolk

The Burning of Norfolk was an incident that occurred on January 1, 1776, during the American Revolutionary War. British Royal Navy ships in the harbor of Norfolk, Virginia began shelling the town, and landing parties came ashore to burn specific properties. The town, whose significantly Tory (Loyalist) population had fled, was occupied by Whig (Revolutionary) forces from Virginia and North Carolina. Although these forces worked to drive off the landing parties, they did nothing to impede the progress of the flames, and began burning and looting Tory properties.
After three days, most of the town had been destroyed, principally by the action of the Whig forces. The destruction was completed by Whig forces in early February to deny use of even the remnants to the British. Norfolk was the last significant foothold of British authority in Virginia; after raiding Virginia's coastal areas for a time, its last Royal Governor, Lord Dunmore, left for good in August 1776.
Background.
Tensions in the British Colony of Virginia were raised in April 1775 at roughly the same time that the hostilities of the American Revolutionary War broke out in the Province of Massachusetts Bay with the Battles of Lexington and Concord. Rebellious Whigs (also known as Patriots) in control of the provincial assembly had begun recruiting troops in March 1775, leading to a struggle for control of the colony's military supplies. Under orders from John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore, the royal Governor of Virginia, British marines removed gunpowder from the colonial storehouse in Williamsburg to a Royal Navy ship, alarming members of the colonial legislature and prompting a militia uprising. Although the incident was resolved without violence, Dunmore, fearing for his personal safety, left Williamsburg in June 1775 and placed his family on board a Royal Navy ship. A small British fleet then took shape at Norfolk, a port town whose merchants had significant Loyalist (Tory) tendencies. Although the town did have some Whig support, the threat posed by the British fleet may have played a role in minimizing their activity in the town.
Confrontations and minor skirmishes continued in Virginia between Whigs on one side and Tories on the other until October, when Dunmore had acquired enough military support to begin organized operations against the rebellious Whigs. General Thomas Gage, the British commander-in-chief for North America, had ordered a small detachment of the 14th Regiment of Foot to Virginia in response to pleas by Dunmore for military help. These troops began raiding surrounding counties for rebel military supplies on October 12. This activity continued through the end of October, when a small British ship ran aground and was captured by Whigs during a skirmish near Hampton. Navy boats sent to punish the townspeople were repulsed by Continental Army troops and militia in a brief gunfight that resulted in the killing and capture of several sailors. Dunmore reacted to this event by issuing a proclamation on November 7 in which he declared martial law, and offered to emancipate Whig-held slaves in Virginia willing to serve in the British Army. The proclamation alarmed Tory and Whig slaveholders alike, concerned by the idea of armed former slaves and the potential loss of their property. Nevertheless, Dunmore was able to recruit enough slaves to form the Ethiopian Regiment, as well as raising a company of Tories he called the Queen's Own Loyal Virginia Regiment. These local forces supplemented the two companies of the 14th Foot that were the sole British military presence in the colony. This successful recruiting drive prompted Dunmore to write on November 30, 1775 that he would soon be able to "reduce this colony to a proper sense of their duty."
Virginia's assembly had sent companies of militia to Hampton under the command of William Woodford, the colonel of the 2nd Virginia Regiment in October, and further militia continued to arrive at Williamsburg. Woodford, his force swollen to 700 men, advanced toward Great Bridge in early December. Some of Dunmore's troops had fortified the north side of the bridge, so Woodford began entrenching the position on his side of the bridge, while more and more militia companies arrived from the surrounding counties and North Carolina. On December 9, British troops attempted to disperse Woodford's force, and were decisively repulsed. Following the battle, the British retreated back into Norfolk, and shortly after, Dunmore and his entire force withdrew to Royal Navy ships anchored in Norfolk's harbor, along with most of the remaining Tory population of the town. Woodford's force continued to grow with the arrival of Colonel Robert Howe and North Carolina regulars the day after the battle.
Continental Army occupation of Norfolk.
On December 14, with the Whig forces having grown by further militia arrivals to about 1,200, Howe and Woodford moved into Norfolk. Since Colonel Howe held a senior Continental Army commission, he outranked Woodford, and assumed command of the occupying forces. He adopted a hard line in dealings with Dunmore and the Royal Navy captains, denying the delivery of supplies to the overcrowded ships, and insisting on parity in the exchange of prisoners.
Howe and Woodford were also concerned about the possibility of a British attack, and at first appealed for additional troops. However, on further consideration they realized that the British fleet could easily maneuver around the town and isolate the garrison. They consequently recommended to the Virginia assembly that the town be abandoned and rendered useless to their enemy.
On December 21 the arrived, accompanied by a store ship loaded with supplies and munitions. Dunmore positioned four ships, the "Dunmore", the "Liverpool", the "Otter", and the in a threatening line along the town's waterfront, setting off an exodus of people and possessions from the town. On Christmas Eve, "Liverpool" captain, Henry Bellew, sent what amounted to an ultimatum into the town, stating that he preferred to purchase provisions instead of taking them by force. Howe rejected the ultimatum, and prepared for a bombardment. On December 30, Bellew demanded that the Whig forces cease parading and changing the guard on the waterfront because he found it offensive, and suggested that it would "not be imprudent" for women and children to leave the town. Howe refused to withdraw his men, telling Bellew "I am too much an Officer [...] to recede from any point which I conceive to be my duty."
Burning and looting.
On New Year's Day 1776, Howe's guards paraded as they had before. Between 3:00 and 4:00 pm, the four ships of the British fleet opened fire on the town. Mounting more than 100 guns, they cannonaded the town well into the evening hours. Landing parties were sent ashore, some to retrieve provisions, others to set fire to buildings that Whig snipers had been using as posts from which to fire on the fleet. Although the British movements were not particularly well coordinated, they succeeded in setting most of the waterfront ablaze.
The Whig militia resisted the landing parties, but did little to stop the flames, which were spread by advantageous winds. Some Loyalist properties were targeted for burning and looting by the Whigs shortly after the bombardment began, including a local distillery. Although the British ended their operations that day, the fires continued to rage; the next morning Colonel Howe reported that "the whole town will I doubt not be consum'd in a day or two." The burning and looting by the occupying Whigs continued for three days. By the time order was restored, much of the town had been destroyed.
Aftermath.
Damage to the town by the Whig forces significantly exceeded that done by the British, destroying 863 buildings valued at £120,000 (an estimated £ in modern pound sterling). In comparison, the British bombardment destroyed only 19 properties worth £3,000 (£); this was in addition to £2,000 (£) in damages done by Lord Dunmore during the British occupation of Norfolk.
Colonel Howe's report to the Virginia Convention omitted the role of the Whig forces in the burning, and repeated the recommendation that the town be destroyed. A newspaper account published by Lord Rawdon prompted some questions in Whig circles about the event, but many assumed that British forces were responsible for most of the damage, and no inquiries were made in the immediate aftermath. The convention approved Howe's plan, and by February 6 the remaining 416 structures had been destroyed. It was not until 1777 that the full extent of Whig participation in the burning was acknowledged.
Whig forces withdrew from the ruins of the town after completing its destruction, and took up posts in other nearby towns. They were further organized in March, when General Charles Lee arrived to take command of the Continental Army's Southern Department. He mobilized the militia to evict Dunmore from a camp he had established near Portsmouth; Dunmore finally abandoned Virginia for good in August 1776.
There is a marker at St. Paul's Boulevard and City Hall Avenue in Norfolk commemorating the action.

Dudley Long North

Dudley Long North (14 March 1748 – 21 February 1829) was an English Whig politician.
Early life.
Baptised Dudley Long at Saxmundham, Suffolk, he was the younger of two sons of Charles Long (1705–1778), landowner, of Hurts Hall, Suffolk, and his wife, Mary, daughter and coheir of Dudley North of Little Glemham, Suffolk, and granddaughter of Sir Dudley North. On 2 May 1789 he changed his surname to North in order to inherit Little Glemham from his aunt Anne Herbert.
Parliamentary career.
He was educated at Bury St Edmunds grammar school from about 1758 and Emmanuel College, Cambridge, from 1766, from where he graduated BA in 1771 and MA in 1774. In 1769 he entered Lincoln's Inn, but was not called to the bar. Of ample fortune, his father having left him £25,000 and a joint interest in his Jamaican plantations, he entered parliament in 1780 at Lord Rockingham's instigation, as MP for St Germans on the Eliot interest. His kinsman Lord North was then still Prime Minister, but due to a speech impediment, Long was discouraged from speaking in the House of Commons. His shyness, despite inheriting the family's corrosive wit, led Dr Johnson, when they were introduced in 1781, to dismiss him as a man ‘of genteel appearance, and that is all’. Nevertheless Long silently supported the Prime Minister, and in 1783 was mentioned as a possible secretary of embassy at Paris.
Long switched to Great Grimsby at the general election in 1784, a more expensive constituency under the patronage of his father-in-law Charles Anderson Pelham. He was in opposition together with Lord North, and aligned himself with North's ally Charles James Fox. Already a member of Brooks's, Long joined the Whig Club in 1785, and Fox relied on him as a dinner host to strengthen party unity, and for political counsel. He was instrumental in the Impeachment of Warren Hastings. On 11 February 1793, the contested Grimsby election of 1790 was eventually voided, and he secured re-election on 17 April. He had briefly joined the Friends of the People Society before seceding on 4 June 1792, but maintained his loyalty to Fox, who was deserted by conservative Whigs, and in 1793 backed the subscription to pay Fox's debts. His success at Grimsby in 1796 was thought unlikely, and he found another seat, for Banbury, on the North family interest, which he held unopposed until 1806. A supporter of parliamentary reform in 1793 and 1797, he disagreed with the decision of Fox to secede from the house in the latter year; he returned to oppose Pitt's taxes and Irish policy, and regularly attended the House of Commons from 1800 onwards. On the peace of Amiens and the war in Ceylon, he voted with the government, but otherwise opposed Addington, and Pitt in his second term of office.
In 1806, even though his friends were in office in George Grenville's administration, a surprise defeat occurred at Banbury, a one-seat constituency with only eighteen electors. In the 1807 election he tied with the usurper, William Praed, and in a fresh election, on 16 February 1808, regained the seat, by 5 votes to 3. He then vacated his seat of Newtown, Isle of Wight, where he had been returned on the Yarborough interest. He had expected his patron Lord Guilford to pay for these elections, which had cost Long £5000, especially as he had promised to bequeath his own estate to Guilford. Guilford asked him to relinquish Banbury in favour of his nephew at the dissolution in 1812, which left Long feeling justifiably let down. Yet in 1811 an offer was made by Charles Grey, which Long declined, of a sinecure if the Whigs returned to office, a hope dashed by the desertion of the Prince Regent. In 1812 after a protracted search, a seat was obtained for him by Earl Fitzwilliam in Richmond, Yorkshire, on the Dundas interest. In December that year, on succeeding his elder brother Charles to the family estate of Hurts Hall, he resumed his former surname, thereby becoming Dudley Long North. In parliament he voted with the opposition in favour of Catholic relief, against the resumption of war with Bonaparte in 1815, and for financial retrenchment. However, to the dismay of Earl Fitzwilliam in 1817, he also opposed the suspension of civil liberties and supported parliamentary reform. In the next parliament he sat on his friend Lord Lauderdale's interest for Jedburgh burghs (1818–20). He voted for Francis Burdett's critical motion of 1 July 1819, and was a supporter of George Tierney's move to lead the Whigs in the Commons, though he was absent from the last session of that parliament. He again represented Newtown, Isle of Wight, in 1820, but on 9 February 1821 resigned his seat.
Marriage and death.
On 6 November 1802 he had married Sophia (1775–1856), daughter of his former patron at Grimsby, Charles Anderson Pelham, by then first Baron Yarborough, and his wife, Sophia Aufrère. They had no children. Long North was dogged by ill health in his later years, which was exacerbated by his unwarranted anxiety about the state of his finances. A pallbearer at Edmund Burke's funeral, a mourner at Sir Joshua Reynolds's, and a patron of the poet George Crabbe, few of Long North's witticisms are preserved, despite his popularity in both literary and political circles; they were for the most part confined to his friends. He died at Brompton, London, on 21 February 1829, and was buried at Little Glemham church where there is a full length Italian marble statue of him, erected by his widow.

He is also notable for having fought against the acquisition by the city of the land for Mount Hope Cemetery. Gould declared the hilly land was not "fit for pasturing rabbits." Despite this he became one of the first people to buy a plot in the new cemetery.

Julio Vizcarrondo

Julio Vizcarrondo Coronado (December 9, 1829 – 1889) was a Puerto Rican abolitionist, journalist, politician and religious leader. He played an instrumental role in the development and passage of the Moret Law which in 1873 abolished slavery in Puerto Rico. Vizcarrondo was also the founder of the Protestant movement in the Iberian Peninsula in the 19th century.
Early years.
Vizcarrondo was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Dr. Jose Bonifacio Vizcarrondo y Ortiz de Zarate and María Josefa Coronado y Martínez. His family were the owners of slaves who worked their Hacienda. Vizcarrondo received his primary education in the capital city of Puerto Rico and his secondary education in Madrid, Spain and Paris, France.
Journalist.
Upon his return to Puerto Rico, Vizcarrondo began to write for a local newspaper, where he expressed his liberal ideas and his position against slavery. The Spanish government considered his remarks as treacherous, and the appointed governor of the island, Lieutenant General Juan de la Pezuela y Cevallos (1848–1851), ordered his exile to the United States.
Exile and return.
In 1850, Vizcarrondo arrived in New York City and joined the "International Conference of Paris against Slavery" as Secretary of the Permanent Committee of said organization. In New York he met and married Henriette Brewster y Cornell and converted to Protestantism, the faith of his wife. In 1854, Vizcarrondo returned to Puerto Rico and continued writing articles and expressing his ideas. He granted his slaves their freedom and became a defender of the rights of the Puerto Rican slaves. He often denounced, in the island's courts, the slave owners who mistreated their slaves, thereby making many enemies. Vizcarrondo also denounced what he felt was the mistreatment of the Puerto Ricans and Puerto Rico in general by the colonial Spanish government.
In 1857, he established the newspaper "El Mercurio" (The Mercury) and later established the "La Casa de la Caridad de San Ildefonso", an educational institution which provided free education to children of little or no means. The director (principal) of the institution was his wife. In 1863, he was named secretary of the commission in charge of moving the remains of Juan Ponce de León from its resting place in the Church of San José to the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista. Vizcarrondo continued to make enemies because of the liberal ideas which he expressed in his newspaper.
Vizcarrondo published various books on math, history and geography which were used in his school. In 1866, he also wrote a spelling book relying upon ancient methods of learning to read titled "El Silabario Puertorriqueño" (The Puerto Rican primary textbook) which was declared a textbook and used in the schools of the island. Vizcarrondo published the "Elementos de Historia y Geografía de Puerto Rico" (The Elements of History and Geography of Puerto Rico) which was made into a textbook.
In Madrid.
In 1863, Vizcarrondo moved to Madrid where he joined other Puerto Ricans and Cubans who were also abolitionists. During his stay, Spain suffered the consequences of a cholera plague. Vizcarrondo and his friends founded the "Sociedad de Amigos de los Pobres" (The Society of the Friends of the Poor), an organization which helped to rescue, feed and assist those who were most affected by the cholera plaque. He also offered his house as a temporary hospital. The government of Spain awarded him a medal in recognition of his heroic deeds during the cholera epidemic. He later co-founded the "Hospital del Niño Jesus". The origins of Protestantism in the Iberian Peninsula in the 19th century can be traced to Vizcarrondo. As president of the Central Committee of the Spanish Evangelical Union, he attempted and failed to establish a Protestant church in Madrid. Despite this setback, on January 24, 1869 he was able to convince the mayor of Madrid to grant the members of the Protestant faith permission to hold their religious services in public.
Political career.
Vizcarrondo joined the Spanish Republican Party. He helped in the preparation of the Liberal Revolution as Secretary of the revolutionary committee of Madrid. When the government discovered his role, he was exiled to France. He returned to Spain shortly after the revolution triumphed. Once again he was given a position in the revolutionary committee of Madrid, and he helped reorganize the Sociedad Abolicionista (Abolitionnist Society). In 1873, Vizcarrondo – together with Ramon Baldorioty de Castro, Luis Padial and the Spanish Minister of Overseas Affairs, Segismundo Moret – presented a proposal for the abolition of slavery in Puerto Rico and Cuba. On March 22, 1873, the Spanish Government approved the proposal which became known as the Moret Law.
Later years and legacy.
On May 1, 1880, Vizcarrondo and Rafael María de Labra became the founders of the Sociedad Nacional Democrática (National Democratic Society), a political party whose main goal was to ask for more autonomy for both Puerto Rico and Cuba. In 1886, he was elected as the representative for his party of the district of Ponce, Puerto Rico. In the Spanish Parliament, Vizcarrondo recommended an autonomy modeled after the type that Canada had at that moment. In 1887, he participated in a massive campaign directed against the Spanish appointed governor of Puerto Rico, Romualdo Palacios, which resulted in the governor's replacement. Julio Vizcarrondo Coronado died in 1889, in Madrid.
The government of Puerto Rico honored Vizcarrondo's memory by naming schools in the towns of Carolina and Cayey after him.

Queen (slang)

In gay slang, queen is a term used to refer to flamboyant or effeminate gay men. The term can either be pejorative or celebrated as a type of self-identification.
Related terms.
"Fruit salad" refers to gay men who don't have a racial preference in their sex partners.
Drag queen.
A drag queen is a person, usually a man, who dresses, and usually acts, like a woman often for the purpose of entertaining or performing. There are many kinds of drag artists and they vary greatly from professionals who have starred in movies to people who just try it a few times. Drag queens also vary by class and culture and can vary even within the same city. Although many drag queens are presumed to be gay men or transgender people, there are drag artists of all genders and sexualities who do drag for many reasons.
Generally, drag queens dress in a female gender role, often exaggerating certain characteristics for comic, dramatic or satirical effect. Other drag performers include drag kings, who are women who perform in male roles, faux queens, who are women who dress in an exaggerated style to emulate drag queens and faux kings, who are men who dress to impersonate drag kings.
The term "drag queen" usually refers to people who dress in drag for the purpose of performing, whether singing or lip-synching, dancing, participating in events such as gay pride parades, drag pageants, or at venues such as cabarets and discotheques. In the United Kingdom, alongside traditional drag work such as shows and performances, many drag queens engage in 'mix-and-mingle' or hosting work at night clubs or at private parties/events.
Drag is a part of Western gay culture; it is often noted that the Stonewall riots on June 27, 1969 in New York City were inspired and led by drag queens and, in part for this reason, drag queens remain a tradition at pride events. Prominent drag queens in the gay community of a city often serve as official or unofficial spokespersons, hosts or emcees, fund-raisers, chroniclers and community leaders.
Rice queen.
A "rice queen" is usually a gay male who prefers or exclusively dates Asian men, typically from the Far East. The term is considered gay slang and depending on the context, may be considered derogatory and offensive internationally.
"Sticky rice" refers to Asian males who prefer other Asian males.
The term "rice king" is used to describe heterosexual males who seek Asian women.
" Yellow fever" denotes the attraction certain non-Asian individuals may have for Asian men or women.
Bean queen.
"Bean queen" or "rice and bean queen" are terms used in the English-speaking gay community to refer to a person, usually a white male, who is primarily attracted to Hispanic and Latino males. One source describes these as "Gay men who are attracted to gentlemen of the Latino flava."
The term is probably derived from the better-established term "rice queen", substituting the rice that forms the basis of the Asian diet with the beans or rice and beans popular throughout Central America, South America and the Caribbean. Other food-based variations such as "taco queen", "salsa queen" and so on are heard occasionally.
"Refried beans" refers to Hispanic and Latino men who prefer other Hispanic and Latino men.
Much less frequently, these terms are used to describe gay Latino males themselves.
Hummus queen.
A "hummus queen" is a gay/bisexual man, who prefers or exclusively dates Middle Eastern men. Hummus is a traditional Middle Eastern chickpea-based dip.
Potato queen.
A "potato queen" is a person who prefers or exclusively dates Caucasian men. Often, but not always, it is a younger Asian man who dates older white men. The name could be considered gay slang. Depending on the context, the term may be considered derogatory and offensive internationally.
Matzah queen.
A "matzoh queen" is a gay male who prefers or exclusively dates Jewish men. Matzah is an unleavened bread traditionally eaten by Jews during Passover.
Dairy queen.
A "dairy queen" is a black or Hispanic male who prefers or exclusively dates Caucasian men. They are also known as "snow queens". The phrase probably nods to the chain of restaurants bearing the same name.
Chocolate queen.
A "chocolate queen" is a white male who prefers or exclusively dates black men. Other terms are "coal queen" and "dinge queen".
Size queen.
A "size queen" is a gay male who prefers or exclusively dates or has sex with men who have large penises or large build.
Opera queen.
"Opera queen" is a gay slang term for gay men who love opera. The term inspired the title of the book "The Queen's Throat: Opera, Homosexuality, and the Mystery of Desire" by Wayne Koestenbaum, and opera queens are, more generally, the subject of "Mawrdew Czgowchwz" by James McCourt.
Gym queen.
"Gym queen" refers to gay men who are into body building and working out either to bulk up and may include steroid use or those looking for a more lithe physique. Although body building and male physique magazines were popular before the 1970s, the Castro clone look — workboots, jeans, tight white t-shirt, shorter well-kept hair, and a well-muscled physique — became widely known and emulated in the 1970s and 1980s replacing the hippie artictic constructs and fashions.
Chicken queen.
A "chicken queen" is a person who prefers or exclusively dates men younger than he is.
Spice queen.
A "spice queen" is a gay/bisexual man, who prefers or exclusively dates Indian, Pakistani, and Bangladeshi men. Spice refers to the primary ingredient in Indian cuisine.
Queen bee.
"Queen bee" is a gay slang term for the dominant member of a group of gay men. It is normally synonymous with the word "bitch". It is unclear whether the term is taken from the term applied to the leader of a female social group or literally from the insect world.
Sticky rice.
A "sticky rice" is an Asian who prefers or exclusively dates other Asian men too.
Mashed potato.
A "mashed potato" is a Caucasian person who prefers or exclusively dates other Caucasian men too.
In literature.
An early example of this usage in mainstream literature occurs in the 1933 novel "The Young and the Evil" by Charles Henri Ford and Parker Tyler: "While waiting Karel wet his hair and put his handkerchief smeared with mascara behind a pipe. You still look like a queen Frederick said..."
In music.
The Kinks song from 1970, "Top of the Pops", contains the line "I've been invited to a dinner with a prominent queen..." and may be one of the earliest recorded examples of this usage. Their 1966 song "Little Miss Queen of Darkness" may be an even earlier reference, though more ambiguous in its possible description of a drag queen "accidentally met" in a discotheque, whose "false eyelashes/ were not much of a disguise..." and who was "not all that it might seem..."

Fang Xiaoru

Fang Xiaoru () was an orthodox Confucian scholar-bureaucrat of the Ming Dynasty, famous for his continuation of the Jinhua school of Zhu Xi and later for his loyalty to his former pupil, the Jianwen Emperor, who died in the rebellion of the Prince of Yan.
After the Prince of Yan usurped the throne to become the Yongle Emperor in 1402, he summoned Fang Xiaoru, who was famed for his connection to Song Lian and the scholars of the Jinhua school as well as for his own talent and lucid composition. He demanded Fang write an inaugural address that would compare his usurpation of the throne with the regency of the Duke of Zhou during the reign of his nephew King Cheng of Zhou in ancient China. Fang refused, retorting "Then where is King Cheng?" Threatened with the nine familial exterminations, Fang Xiaoru is reported saying: ("Never mind nine agnates; go ahead with ten!"). He was granted his wish with perhaps the only case of an "extermination of ten degrees of kinship" in the history of China. In addition to his own execution, his blood relations and their spouses were killed along with all of his students and peers as the 10th group. Altogether, 873 people are said to have been executed.
Before death, Fang Xiaoru was forced to watch his brother's execution. Fang Xiaoru himself was executed by "waist severing" (). The legend goes that prior to his death, he dipped his finger in his own blood and wrote on the ground the Chinese character "篡" ("cuàn"), meaning "usurper".

Ravi Roy

Ravi Roy is a fictional character from the British Channel 4 soap opera "Hollyoaks", played by Stephen Uppal. He first appeared in an episode airing on 20 May 2008, introduced by series producer Bryan Kirkwood. Since then he has been central to a bisexuality storyline and living with an aneurysm. Uppal announced in 2010 that he had decided to leave the show.
Character creation.
Details of Ravi's character were announced at the same time as Leila Roy, with Stephen Uppal and Lena Kaur being cast in the roles. Ravi is described as a "cheeky jack-the-lad". Of his character, Uppal explained, "Ravi certainly makes an impression when he arrives at Hollyoaks. His cocky attitude gets him a job as doorman at The Loft and he certainly wins over resident bad-boy, Warren, with his cheek. There’s also some chemistry between Ravi and Nancy, but if Nancy likes him, she’ll have to get her skates on before man-eater Mercedes beats her too it!"
Uppal decided to leave "Hollyoaks" in 2010, following the beginning of Paul Marquess's new role as series producer. Uppal announced his exit on social network website Twitter. He later said: "Sorry guys, yes I decided to leave a while back. I've had a good time but always wanted to leave after a few years. Bye bye Ravi Roy!"
Development.
Bisexuality.
Ravi's first storyline was his bisexuality. The character was first revealed as bisexual during an episode in which he tried to kiss Russ Owen. Speaking of the character's masculinity and non-stereotypical bisexual, Stephan Uppal stated, "I think they've dealt with it really well. When it's something as big as this, you sit down with the writers and the directors and you discuss everything. I thought that it was about time that a soap portrayed a bisexual or gay character who isn't overtly feminine or camp. You get them in every other soap — you see "Coronation Street", "EastEnders" and even "Hollyoaks" with — he was quite camp in the way he was playing the part because that's how the character was meant to be played. But with Ravi, he's just this very masculine lad."
Ravi embarked on a three-way relationship with Kris Fisher and Nancy Hayton, however this was short lived. Ravi came out to his parents about his sexuality, however they were not bothered and actually assumed he was gay. Siblings Leila and Ash appeared to already know of Ravi's sexuality, with Ash saying in an episode "You still greedy then?", referring to having sexual feelings towards both males and females.
Aneurysm.
Ravi's diagnosis with a cerebral aneurysm was the characters second storyline. After several dizzy spells, Kris urged Ravi to see a doctor, when he did so, he was told he had an aneurysm, which could kill him any time. Ravi struggled with the prospect of having to live without things including alcohol and sexual intercourse, which both could trigger the aneurysm to kill him. Kris and Ravi became closer once again. Uppal spoke out about the relationship stating, "They're both mature men but it really brings them closer together than when they were a couple. When they were together, though, Kris just thought "he's a gorgeous bloke, I'm having a bit of fun here". There was never anything deep and meaningful from his point of view — it was Ravi who ended up falling for Kris, surprisingly enough. But now their relationship's taken to another level because you realise that Kris does genuinely have strong feelings for Ravi as a friend and he does care about his well-being and his welfare."
Ravi, despite being fully aware of what could happen, began illegal street fights, coached by Ash, who was unaware of the aneurysm until Ravi became slightly blinded by a fight. When the rest of his family found out, they became over-protective, this sending Ravi over the edge, threatening Leila violently. Ravi began another illegal fight, however his family found out and stopped him. Angry, Ravi taunted Ash, who then punched him. Ravi went into a coma and had to under-go an emergency craniotomy, to remove the tumour, with a 60% chance of his dying or being severally brain-damaged. Ravi's operation was a success, however he was left with slight disablements in his hands and leg.
Storylines.
Backstory.
Born in 1985, Ravi is the second child of Govinda (Anthony Bunsee) and Bel Roy (Nila Aalia), he is the brother of Ash (Junade Khan) and Leila (Lena Kaur) and the adoptive brother of Anita (Saira Choudhry). When Ravi was eight, Gov and Bel adopted Anita, which he forgot as he grew up. He moved to Hollyoaks in 2008 and was followed later that year by his family.
2008–10.
Ravi is first seen when he begins to play with Charlie Dean (Joshua McConville). Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox) sees him and assumes he is trying to kidnap Charlie. Nancy then realises the misunderstanding. Ravi starts work at The Loft as a bouncer and briefly moves in with Warren Fox (Jamie Lomas) and Louise Summers (Roxanne McKee). Ravi is given the job of interviewing several people for a position at The Loft and interviews Nancy. Ravi takes her application as a joke and sleeps with Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe) after her interview. Ravi and Nancy grow closer when a smoke bomb goes off in The Loft and he saves her. Nancy gives Ravi a kiss but is offended by Warren, who says the bomb was him due to his ethnicity. Nancy and Ravi then begin a relationship.
During a talk about relationships, Ravi attempts to kiss Russ Owen (Stuart Manning), revealing himself as bisexual. Russ pushes back Ravi, who tries to say he was just joking. Ravi breaks up with Nancy, however the pair do get back together. Kris Fisher (Gerard McCarthy) catches Ravi looking at him and becomes suspicious. Kris and Ravi then start a secret affair, however, unbeknown to Ravi, Nancy and Kris have also begun an affair. Nancy catches Ravi and Kris kissing, however does not do anything. They then decide to try the relationship as a three-way. Nancy struggles to cope with two relationships due to jealousy over Ravi and Kris and finishes with both of them. Kris and Ravi continue their relationship, with Kris urging Ravi to come out to his parents at Bel's Ram Navami, which he does. Kris then decides to dump Ravi, leaving him heartbroken.
Ravi helps Ash rebuild his restaurant Relish. He befriends Caleb Ramsey (Michael Ryan), who is also helping with brother Zak (Kent Riley). Ash tells Caleb that Ravi might have a thing for him. Caleb, realising what he means, runs after Ravi outside and punches him due to his sexuality. Ash notices Ravi's burst lip, but Bel assumes that it was a racially motivated attack. Ash tells Ravi to tell Bel and Gov that Caleb hit him because of his sexuality and then states that Ravi is ashamed of himself. Later, Ravi goes dizzy and collapses in the bathroom. He admits to Kris what happened after he almost faints again. Kris convinces Ravi to go to the hospital for a check-up. Ravi agrees and Kris accompanies him. Ravi runs out of the hospital after receiving devastating news, which he then reveals to Kris and tells him that he was diagnosed with a cerebral aneurysm, which could kill him at any moment. Caleb later tries to start another fight with Ravi and Kris. Ravi punches a drunken Caleb when he tries to kiss Leila.
Ravi becomes involved in illegal fighting, managed by Ash. Ravi is punched during one fight and slightly loses his sight. Leila blames Ash for his condition. Ravi eventually regains his sight. In August, Ravi and Loretta Jones (Melissa Walton) begin flirting and go to The Dog on a date. Ravi feels smothered by Leila and Nancy, who sit near them in the bar. Ravi then violently attacks Leila, telling her to stay away. Despite his family's pleas, Ravi arranges another illegal fight without anyone knowing until Kris finds out and alerted the Roys. Bel, Anita, Loretta, Kris and Ash all arrive and stop him before he is seriously injured. Ravi, angry by their inference, taunts Ash, which leads to Ash punching him. Ravi then collapsed and falls into a coma. During his time in hospital, Ravi wakes up and overhears Ash telling Anita she was adopted. When Ravi wakes up fully, he tells his family what he heard, despite Ash claiming Anita had found her birth certificate and came to him. Ash is then disowned. Ravi returns from hospital with slight brain damage and has lost the full use of his hands and one of his legs, however he reveals he will return to normal. Anita confronts Ravi, who tells her he was only eight when she was adopted and he forgot about it. Anita later forgives him. Bel and Gov decide to leave Hollyoaks after Gov applies for a new job in Middlesbrough. Ravi decides to stay in Hollyoaks, as do Leila and Anita. The three stay in the family home, however Ravi feels bad as he is the only one without a job.
Ravi reopens Ash's business Relish with the help of Dominic Reilly (John Pickard). Ravi begins dating a woman called Kate Simpson, who in secret is actually Eva Strong (Sheree Murphy), Anita's birth mother. When Anita decides to locate her mother, she discovers who Kate actually is. Anita is hurt and tells Ravi, who is heartbroken. Anita and Ravi visit Eva at her market stall in Manchester. She tries to explain her situation, but Ravi is only interested in Anita's feelings and tells Eva that Anita does not deserve to be hurt. Eva then returns to Relish to discuss the problem and they soon reconcile.
Someone sprays racist graffiti on Relish and sets off a smoke bomb whilst Ravi is still inside. It is revealed to be Des Townsend (Kris Deedigan), who Ravi, Zak, Michaela McQueen (Hollie-Jay Bowes) and Jacqui McQueen (Claire Cooper) later force to leave Hollyoaks. Following this, Ravi begins a relationship with Jem Costello (Helen Russell-Clark), but cannot control his feelings for Eva. After Jem discovers Ravi and Eva sleeping together, she moves out. Anita is not happy to find out her brother and mother were having an affair. Anita starts to worry, when Ravi disappears for two days, and it is questioned whether or not he was a fatality in the recent fire. Dom informs Anita that the police have found Ravi's body in a ditch. He is sent to hospital, as his aneurysm has returned. In order to recover, Ravi moves to Middlesbrough to be with his parents.
Reception.
David Knox from TV Tonight branded Ravi a "temperamental" character.

Leila Roy

Leila Roy is a fictional character from the long-running Channel 4 soap opera "Hollyoaks", played by Lena Kaur. The character made her first appearance in June 2008. In November 2009, it was announced that Kaur had quit the role and would leave in January 2010.
Character creation.
Backstory.
Leila was born in 1989 to Govinda and Bel Roy. She is their eldest daughter and sister to Ash, Ravi and Anita. Leila, a keen artist, had told her father that she was at college studying a law course in order to retrieve his dream of her becoming a lawyer. When Leila was four, Gov and Bel adopted Anita, who Leila grew up believing to be her sister.
Casting.
Regular role auditions were held for the part of Leila with actress Lena Kaur securing the role. In November 2009, it was announced that Kaur would leave the soap. Speaking of her decision, Kaur stated: "I decided to leave a while ago because I wanted to do something else. It's the same with every soap - you don't get time to rehearse, there are ups and down and it's so quick to film. You learn all the technical side of things, which is fabulous but for me, I want to move on. It seems like a good time to go as projects are being commissioned that are big for Asian actors - the casting world is moving forward. Young Asian actors are being cast in lead roles in which the characters are who they are regardless of their skin colour. Casting's definitely on a turn compared to what it was five or ten years ago."
Development.
Personality and identity.
Leila is kind, generous and forgiving. She is a firm believer in the spirit world, karma and horoscopes and on several occasions, has used her horoscope to envision her life. In August 2008, Lena Kaur praised "Hollyoaks" producer Bryan Kirkwood for not stereotyping Asians on the programme. Speaking to "Take 5" magazine, she stated, "The storylines for me and Stephen (Ravi) aren't being dictated by the colour of our skin. We're both British Asians in real life as well as in the show. We are both totally westernised. We've been brought up in Britain, so the storylines will reflect people like Stephen and me."
Storylines.
Leila arrives as a student at Hollyoaks Community College, where she moves into the halls of residence. Shortly after arriving, Leila begins to develop feelings for Justin Burton, which she tells friend Nancy Hayton. Leila accidentally knocks Justin over. He hits his head and is knocked unconscious. One of the nurses at the hospital tells Leila that Justin has lost his memory. Leila then pretends to be Justin's girlfriend when he leaves hospital. At a party, Justin's friend Ste Hay tells him that Leila is making their relationship up. Justin decides to go along with it and gets back at her by making her do housework. Justin then proposes to a shocked Leila, he then admits to knowing she is lying and reveals he has not lost his memory.
Leila has fun with Gilly Roach and they share a kiss, which makes Justin jealous. Gilly and Leila go on date, but are forced to take Archie Carpenter and Rhys Ashworth with them. Leila then turns down Gilly and starts a relationship with Justin, who finally realises feelings towards Leila. Leila begins to sleepwalk, which is discovered when she is caught on camera eating her own chocolates from an advent calendar. The novelty of Leila and Justin's relationship begins to ware off when Justin realises his true feelings for Hannah Ashworth. During Sasha Valentine and Josh Ashworth's joint birthday party, Justin kisses Hannah and is seen by Hannah's boyfriend Ash and Elliot Bevan, who has developed feelings for Leila. Leila and Elliot kiss outside and are seen by Ash. Elliot tells Leila he wants to start a relationship, as Justin does with Hannah, however Leila feels guilty and continues her relationship with Justin. Justin the splits up with Leila, who then helps him ask out Hannah. Leila and Elliot share a kiss, their love for each other and begin a relationship.
Leila begins feeling ill. When Elliot takes her for a romantic picnic, Leila, who is still ill, appears uninterested, prompting Elliot to believe she has lost interest in their relationship. After a confrontation, Leila tells Elliot she thinks she may be pregnant. Elliot runs off, worrying he would be a bad father like his own. He tries to avoid Leila, who claims to have taken a pregnancy test. Elliot returns and she reveals she is in fact pregnant. Elliot then runs out again. Leila tracks him down and tells him she never took the test and wanted to see how Elliot would react. With a strain already on their relationship, Leila takes a test and discovers she is not pregnant, to the relief of the pair. Leila contacts Elliot's father Gareth, however Kris Fisher tells her that Elliot does not want anything to do with his father. Leila then gets Elliot and Kris to take some of her art to a gallery, in order for her to tell Gareth to leave when he arrives. Gareth turns up just as Elliot prepares to leave for the gallery, however he assumes Gareth is a delivery man. Finally the truth comes out and Elliot is angry at Leila for interfering. Leila grows suspicious of Gareth, who's relationship with Elliot has grown. She discovers Elliot's half brother Maynard is in fact the same age as Elliot and not fourteen as Gareth had said. Realising Gareth is lying to Elliot and had obviously cheated on Elliot's mother Bonnie, Leila calls her. After Gareth leaves, Elliot rejects Leila.
Leila, Bel, Loretta, Kris and Anita discover Ravi is involved in an illegal fight, which could cause his aneurysm to rupture. Angry Ravi taunts Ash, who then punches him. Ravi falls into a coma and Leila blames Ash, who tries to apologise. Ash tells Anita that she is adopted and manipulates her into keeping quiet. When Anita tells Gov she knows, Leila is shocked that her family lied to her and Anita. The Roys then disown Ash. Leila tells Gilly that Ash had hidden food in Hannah Ashworth's room to make it look like her eating disorder had returned, Ash then leaves Hollyoaks. Leila ends her relationship with Elliot and has a one-night-stand with Archie Carpenter, who later asks her out but she declines. When Bel and Gov move away to Middlesbrough, Leila, Ravi and Anita move into a smaller flat, previously occupied by the Cunningham family. Leila begins to worry Anita has an eating disorder after a confrontation from Hannah. However, Anita is pretending for attention. Leila overhears Anita and Theresa McQueen talking, and believes Anita has lost her virginity. Anita then pretends she has, due to Leila treating her more like an adult. When Anita collapses due to taking MDMA, Leila and Ravi believe Dave Colburn spiked her drink. However, Anita admits she took it herself to impress him.
Leila creates a sculpture as part of an exhibition. During an interview for a job with artist Jack Welsh, she is told the job is in Paris. Not knowing whether to take the opportunity, Leila confides in Elliot, and the pair grow close again, much to the dislike of his girlfriend Sheila Buxton. Anita accidentally smashes Leila's sculpture during a party, possibly ruining her chance for the job. However, Anita and Ravi Roy reconstruct her sculpture and she is then offered the job. Initially she is reluctant because of her feelings for Elliot, however he persuades her to move on and she leaves for Paris that night.

Madhusudan Gupta

Early life.
Dr. Madhusudan Gupta dissected a corpse after several years of legendary Indian Surgeon, Sushruta. 
Gupta came from a Baidya family, who were practitioners of Ayurveda by tradition. He was born to Balaram Gupta in Baidyabati, Hooghly sometime in the year 1800. After completing his school, he took admission in Sanskrit College. He was a student in the Baidyak discipline.
Career.
In 1830, he was appointed a professor at the Sanskrit College, replacing Khudiram Visharad, which created a ripple among the student community. 
In 1835, the Medical College was set up. The Baidyak discipline was discontinued at the Sanskrit College and Gupta joined Medical College as an assistant teacher. He studied Western medicine along with the students and passed in 1840. In 1845, he became the Superintendent of the Hindusthani medium. In 1848, he was promoted to a first class sub-assistant surgeon. In 1852, the Bengali medium was opened at the Medical College for the first time. Gupta took charge as the Superintendent of the Bengali medium.
Gupta had significant contribution to the history of Calcutta Medical College (CMC) and hospital. During the prima stage of medical college, Indian students were not coming to join the course partly because they were from aristocratic Indian families who had disdain for surgery (reluctant to touch the dead body) and partly because the Ayurvedic and Unani systems of medicine were popular at that time. He was a Sanskrit scholar and Ayurvedic doctor and he did proclaim that he will dissect the dead body and that created waves among the people and after that many came to join the medical education at CMC. The British government fired 50 cannon shot to honour him. It is difficult to conceive that 50 gun-salutes were made. Because there was rumour of "cutting up a kid" and the college gates were closed to prevent encroachment. The government was happy because they broke past the custom thought prevailing there to some extent which in fact went against "The Native Medical Institution (NMI)" which was practicing Ayurvedic and Unani medicine culture. He was one among the first batch of students passed from the CMC. He did not pass in the first batch of CMC graduates. Moreover, R Havlock Charles dismises Madhusudan's role as the first dissector. Madhusudan's role may be viewed as one of the first internalizers of modern anatomical education who acted as the agency for the Company's education.

Maria in der Tanne

Maria in der Tanne is a small baroque church near Triberg im Schwarzwald in the Black Forest of Germany. The legend behind this church dates from 1644, when a young girl was cured from an eye disease by the water of a nearby spring. Within the next year, a local tailor cured his leprosy by washing in the same spring. The thankful tailor placed a small statue of Mary in the cavity of a fir tree (from which the church draws its name -- "Mary in the Fir").
The statue was forgotten, then rediscovered years later by three Tyrolean soldiers around the year 1700. Shortly thereafter, a small wooden chapel, then a larger stone church, and finally the existing church were built by pilgrims.

When You Lie Next to Me is the debut studio album by American country music artist Kellie Coffey. It was released on May 7, 2002 by BNA Records. "When You Lie Next to Me," "At the End of the Day" and "Whatever It Takes" were all released as singles. The title track was Coffey's highest charting single, reaching #8 on the "Billboard" country charts in 2002. The album is Coffey's only studio album affiliated with a professional record label, as Coffey was dropped before self-releasing Walk On in 2007. 
Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic rated the album three stars out of five, describing Coffey as "a more approachable Faith Hill— her polished country-pop is every bit as urbane, yet it doesn't feel as glamorous." Country Standard Time reviewer Jeffrey B. Remz compared her vocals to those of Sara Evans, saying that Coffey's voice was "strong full-bodied" but added that he thought the album lacked a sense of identity.

A despatch rider is a military messenger, mounted on horse or motorcycle.
Despatch riders were used by armed forces to deliver urgent orders and messages between headquarters and military units. They had a vital role at a time when telecommunications were limited and insecure.
United Kingdom.
In the British Army, motorcycle despatch riders were first used in the World War I by the Royal Engineers Signal Service. The riders were originally volunteers, some of whom supplied their own machines. The British often referred to despatch riders as Don R's during World War 2. In World War II, Royal Corps of Signals soldiers carried out the role and the Royal Signals Motorcycle Display Team was formed from their number. They were also used by the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy, where they maintained contact with land bases and some of the riders were members of the Womens Royal Naval Service. The British military often used Triumph Motorcycles for this purpose.

Avengi Ja Nahin is the second album by Rabbi Shergill. The album was produced in Italy by Mauro Pagani.
Though regular Rabbi fans took a quick liking to this new album, with its varied themes and soulful songs, it did not receive the kind of broad based patronage the previous one enjoyed. (Even in the previous album, the only song which truly broke through in popular consciousness was "Bulla ki jana") However, to the small amount of Rabbi followers, the second album definitely represented the experience one may expect from a talented artist's second offering - a growth, a maturing, an expansion and a bit more variety.

Paddy Canny

Paddy Canny (1919–2008) was an Irish fiddle player. In a career that spanned over six decades, Canny was instrumental in popularizing Irish traditional music, both in Ireland and internationally. He gained initial fame in the late 1940s as a founding member of the Tulla Céilí Band, which made its first appearance on RTÉ Radio in 1948 and had positioned itself as the top céilí band in Ireland by the late 1950s. Canny captured the All Ireland fiddle championship in 1953 and was featured on the landmark 1959 recording, "All-Ireland Champions: Violin". Although he stopped performing for large audiences in 1965, he returned briefly in the 1990s to record his critically acclaimed solo album, "Paddy Canny: Traditional Music from the Legendary East Clare Fiddler".
Biography.
Paddy Canny was born in the townland of Glendree in County Clare in 1919, the youngest son of Pat Canny and Catherine MacNamara. Pat Canny was a noted local fiddle player, and taught the instrument to his three sons, Paddy, Mickie, and Jack. Paddy also learned techniques from a blind fiddle teacher named Paddy McNamara, who would board with the Canny family in winter and hold lessons in their home. By the time he was in his late teens, Paddy was performing at local crossroads dances, céilís, and weddings. 
In 1946, Paddy and several other musicians— among them fellow fiddler P.J. Hayes, pianist Teresa Tubridy, and accordion player Joe Cooley— founded the Tulla Céilí Band at Minogue's Bar in the town of Tulla. The band's popularity grew quickly after they captured first prize at a Limerick fleadh and made their first radio appearance in 1948. The following decade, the band began competing in the All Ireland competitions, initiating a rivalry with the Kilfenora Céilí Band, which won the competition in 1954 and 1955. In 1956, Tulla tied Kilfenora for first place in the Munster competition but lost by a half point in the All Ireland. Tulla won first place the following year, however, and won again in 1960. The band toured Britain and the United States in 1958, delivering a memorable performance at Carnegie Hall in New York on St. Patrick's Day. The Tulla Céilí Band recorded five 78 rpms for HMV in 1956 and recorded their first LP, "Echoes of Erin", in 1958. 
Paddy individually captured the All Ireland fiddle championship in 1953. In 1961, he married Philomena Hayes, the sister of his bandmate P.J. Hayes. Both Canny and P.J. Hayes were featured on the 1959 album, "All-Ireland Champions: Violin", one of the first major commercial recordings of Irish traditional music. Paddy's rendition of the traditional song "Trim the Velvet" was the signature tune of the long-running radio program "A Job of Journeywork". By the mid-1960s, however, Canny decided the band's demands were too much of a distraction from his farm (which he considered his primary occupation), and he left the band in 1965. 
In the early 1990s, Canny finally returned to the commercial music scene when he appeared on Gearóid OhAllmhuráin's "Traditional Music From Clare and Beyond". Canny finally released his first solo album, "Paddy Canny: Traditional Music from the Legendary East Clare Fiddler", in 1997. The album was named the year's top traditional album by "The Irish Times". 
Canny died on June 28, 2008. He was predeceased by his wife Philomena and is survived by his daughters Mary and Rita. His nephew, Martin Hayes, has captured the All Ireland fiddle championship six times and continues to record and perform traditional Irish music.

<doc id="18310337" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18310337" title="Line lock">
Line lock

A line lock is a device that allows the front brakes to lock independently of the rear brakes via a switch. The device is an electric solenoid that controls a valve which is placed on the front brake line, and is controlled by a switch. Simpler systems consist of a manually operated valve which directly opens and closes the brake line, usually with a lever or tap inside the cabin of the vehicle. Normally, the valve is open and allows fluid to pass through to the front brakes. However, when the brakes are applied and the solenoid is activated, the valve closes to trap the brake fluid, keeping the front brakes applied until the switch is released.
History.
Drag racing is a motorsport often run using cars with manual transmissions. Manual transmissions allow drivers to control the amount of power transferred from the engine to the wheels by manipulating both clutch and throttle inputs, allowing vehicles to accelerate quickly without losing traction. However, launching a vehicle requires simultaneous gas pedal and clutch pedal inputs, preventing drivers from manipulating the brakes with their feet. Without brake input, drivers staging their vehicle at the starting line would roll if the clutch was slightly engaged. If the driver's vehicle rolled across the staging line before the start of a drag race, driver would "red light" and lose that race. The line lock prevents vehicles from rolling by allowing the driver to control the clutch and accelerator using foot input and braking with the hand. In an automatic transmission vehicle, a line lock allows the engine to rev up to its peak power RPM and launch aggressively from the starting line.
Usage.
Line locks are often used for burnouts by fully locking the front wheels and then engaging the gas pedal and disengaging the clutch pedal, this makes the rear tires spin but keeps the car stationary.
Although less common, rolling burnouts can be achieved with modified line locks by proportionally increasing the front brake pressure and the throttle to keep the car at a steady speed. This makes the rear tires slip and spin faster than the front tires and burnout.
Line locks are sometimes used to stop the car rolling off start lines so the driver can keep their feet on the accelerator and clutch pedals.
Additionally, line locks can be installed on the rear brake lines. When the line lock is activated, fluid pressure is prevented from being transferred to the rear, allowing the rear wheels to spin freely while the front brakes can be controlled with the brake pedal. This allows one to creep at varying speeds while maintaining a burnout. 
Achieving such a burnout requires manipulation of both throttle and brake inputs. The burnout is initiated by manipulating the clutch with the left foot and both the brake and gas pedal with the right foot. The brakes must be held while revving up the engine, then the clutch is released while continuing to hold the brakes. Once the rear tires start spinning, the left foot is used to control the brakes while the right foot continues to control the throttle.
The only main advantage for such a setup would be the ability to maintain a burnout at low speeds, and to reduce the wear on the rear brakes while doing a burnout. Such an application would only be practical for show purposes such as drifting exhibitions, or just for fun.

85 mm antitank gun D-48

The 85-mm antitank gun D-48 () was a Soviet 85-mm calibre antitank gun used after World War II. It was designed as the replacement for the 100 mm field gun M1944 (BS-3). Distinguishing features of the D-48 include a very long barrel and a pepper-pot muzzle brake. The D-48 was itself replaced in the 1960s by the T-12 antitank gun.
Overview.
The gun was designed by the F. F. Petrov Design Bureau on the basis of the D-44 85-mm divisional gun and production of the D-48 began in 1953 at the No. 75 factory in Yurga. The D-48 used the breechblock from the BS-3 100-mm field gun in order to achieve a rate of fire of 15 rounds per minute at maximum cadence. The gun can transition from march to combat order in about two minutes.
The D-48N was a version with an APN 2-77 or 3-77 infrared imaging device fitted for night combat. A licensed version of the D-48 was produced in China as the Type 60.
The gun fires a high velocity armor-piercing tracer (HVAP-T) BR-372 Projectile at 1040 meters per second and can penetrate 185mm of armor at a range of 1000 meters at an angle of obliquity of 90 degrees. The 3BK-7 high explosive antitank (HEAT) projectile can penetrate 192mm of armor at an angle of obliquity of 60 degrees. The effective range of armor-piercing shells for the D-48 is 1,230 meters (HVAP-T) or 940 meters (HEAT). Additionally, the D-48 antitank gun is capable of firing a 9.66 kilogram OF-372 high explosive projectile to a direct fire range of 1,200 meters or an indirect fire range of 18.97 kilometers. The Ammunition for the D-48 was developed by necking down 100-mm ammunition in order to achieve higher muzzle velocities.
The gun is towed by a URAL-375D truck or an AT-P tractor with a maximum towing speed over asphalt roadway of about 60 km/h. The tires on the D-48 are those of the ZIS-5 truck.
Designs with auxiliary power units were also investigated but never developed beyond prototype stage.
Use by other nations.
The D-48 has been exported to Afghanistan, Bulgaria, Congo, India, Iraq, North Korea, Mongolia, Mozambique, Romania, Somalia, Sudan, and Vietnam.

Aubrey Lewis

Sir Aubrey Julian Lewis, FRCP, FRCPsych (8 November 1900- 21 January 1975), was the first Professor of Psychiatry at the Institute of Psychiatry, London, and is credited with being a driving force behind the flowering of British psychiatry after World War II as well as raising the profile of the profession worldwide.
Early life.
Aubrey Julian Lewis was born on 8 November 1900 in Adelaide, the only child of Jewish parents George Solomon Lewis, an accountant from England, and his South Australian-born wife Ré Lewis, née Isaacs, an elocution teacher. He was educated at Christian Brothers College, Adelaide, Wakefield Street, where he proved to be a gifted pupil. He went on to study medicine at the University of Adelaide and graduated with distinction in 1923 (M.B., B.S.).
Career.
Lewis worked at the Royal Adelaide Hospital for two years and undertook anthropological research on Aborigines. In 1926 he accepted a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship in psychological medicine. This brought him to the Phipps Clinic under the mentorship of Adolf Meyer, whom he respected and admired greatly, and whose work he praised in lectures such as the Adolf Meyer Lecture in 1960. This was the start of two years postgraduate study performed in the USA and thence on to Germany. Lewis then moved to the United Kingdom and joined the staff of the Maudsley Hospitalin London in 1928. In, 1931 he received his M.D. from the University of Adelaide and in 1936 he became Clinical Director of the hospital. In 1938 he became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians.
Institute of Psychiatry.
In 1946 the Maudsley Hospital was designated the Institute of Psychiatry under the auspices of the University of London and Lewis was appointed to the inaugural Chair of Psychiatry at the institute. He held this post until his retirement in 1966. It has been said that the flowering of British psychiatry after World War II can be attributed to three factors: a long humanitarian tradition; the National Health Service and Aubrey Lewis. Lewis built a reputation as a leader, educator and administrator and is credited with moulding the Institute into a model of scientific research and teaching attracting many of the most promising medical graduates from around the world. He is also credited with raising the profile of psychiatry worldwide, through his work as an adviser to general medical bodies, national and international research councils, and political organizations. He was a member of the Advisory Committee on Medical Research of the World Health Organisation.
Many esteemed psychiatrists worked under the direction of Lewis at the Institute of Psychiatry, including Martin Roth and Michael Shepherd; the latter was at great pains to point out that Lewis's impact also extended to his contributions as a clinician, scholar and researcher, particularly in the field of epidemiology, but also genetics, clinical phenomenology and biology. He was perhaps most well known for his studies of melancholia and obsessional illness, and indeed guided the young Michael Shepherd on his research into morbid jealousy.
Family and Personal Life.
On 22 February 1934 at the Liberal Jewish Synagogue, St Marylebone, he had married Hilda North Stoessiger, also a psychiatrist. Hilda died in 1966 which affected Aubrey greatly. They had two daughters and two sons, all of whom survived Lewis. Lewis died on 21 January 1975 in Charing Cross Hospital, London. A memorial service was held in April at the synagogue in which he had been married. 
Sir Aubrey was known to have an austere appearance, which was captured in Ruskin Spear's official portrait of 1966. However, to those who knew him his high standards of personal and professional integrity went with a warm, kindly, humorous disposition which earned him the affection of colleagues and friends. Michael Shepherd described him as a "representative man" in Emerson's sense of the term.
The man Adelaide forgot.
It had been noted by a number of commentators, including Michael Shepherd, that Lewis’ reputation, achievements and qualities were recognized during his lifetime, except, paradoxically, in his native land. This lack of recognition began to be addressed in the decade following his death. On 5 November 1981 a memorial plaque was unveiled in his honour, having been sponsored by the South Australian Branch of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists, the University of Adelaide and the South Australian Association for Mental Health. The plaque is placed in the foyer of the Florey lecture theatre. The last line reads:
“He was a leading figure in British Commonwealth Psychiatry in the mid-20th century era, exerting great influence through his scholarship and inspirational qualities.”
In 1990 an Aubrey Lewis unit was opened at Royal Park Hospital, Melbourne which prompted a newspaper article entitled, 'The man Adelaide forgot'. It began: 'Had Aubrey Lewis gone to St Peter's College and been interested in field sports his name would probably be well known to generations of South Australians. But he was Jewish, went to a Catholic school, his father was a nobody and he lived up the east end of Rundle Street - definitely the wrong side of the tracks for a prejudicial, parochial Adelaide of the 1920s'. However, writers have pointed out that these reasons for the lack of recognition of Lewis in South Australia should be tempered by two other factors, namely that for much of Lewis’ lifetime psychiatry had a traditionally inferior status, and perhaps more importantly for the latter part of his life he was unable through illness to revisit the country of his birth.

Spirax-Sarco Engineering

Spirax-Sarco Engineering () is a leading British-based manufacturer of boiler and pipeline control valves for steam heating and process plants. It is headquartered in Cheltenham and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.
History.
The Company was founded in 1888 as "Sanders, Rehders & Co." ('Sarco') in London importing thermostatic steam traps from Germany. It started to manufacture steam traps in United Kingdom under the "Spirax" brand name in 1932 and was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1959. In 1960 a range of self-acting pressure controls are introduced for the first time. Then in 1963 it bought "Drayton Controls", a control valve and instrumentation business. 
In 1990 the Company diversified in pump manufacturing in 1990 when it bought "Watson-Marlow". It acquired the "Jucker Industrial Division", an Italian controls business, in 1993 and "M&M International", an Italian piston actuated and solenoid valve business in 2001. In September 2005 it acquired "Mitech Actuators & Controls" and "Proportional Control Technology", a pair of South African businesses making process controls. Then later that year it bought "EMCO Flow Systems", a metering business.
The company acquired Intervalf for £2.8m in 2009. It completed a new facility in Shanghai, China in June 2010: the plant, designed as Spirax's regional headquarters, combines a factory, warehouse, and offices.
In 2011 the Minister for UK Trade & Investment, Lord Green, opened the new Spirax Sarco facility in St Petersburg, Russia and in May 2012 the Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg visited Spirax Sarco’s manufacturing facility in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.

Apparition of Face and Fruit Dish on a Beach

Apparition of Face and Fruit Dish on a Beach (1938) is a painting by the Spanish surrealist Salvador Dalí.
The picture shows fruit on or in a wine glass. A human face (which would be seen again in one of Dalí's later works, "The Endless Enigma") is seen below the fruit, the handle of the wine glass acting as the face's nose bridge. The texture of the face is the sand of the beach. On the sand is a cloth and a snapped rope. There also are two dogs featured in the background of the painting.

List of coal mines and landmarks in the Nanaimo area

This is a list of landmarks and historic locations, mostly related to coal mining, in the vicinity of the City of Nanaimo in the Canadian province of British Columbia.
Origins of Nanaimo - Coal.
Most of these landmarks relate to the city's history as a coal mining town. Coal was discovered in the area in 1849. Joseph William McKay took possession of the deposits for the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) in 1852 at the direction of Governor James Douglas. The area was first known as Wintuhuysen Inlet and then Colville Town (named for an HBC Governor) but became known as Nanaimo in 1860. The first church opened in 1861. In 1853 the population was 125. By 1869 it was about 650 and by 1874 it was close to 1,000. 
By 1859, 25,000 tons of coal had been shipped from Nanaimo, mostly to San Francisco. In 1862 the HBC sold its coal interests to an English Company known as the Vancouver Coal Mining and Land Company (VCML). Output was 100 tons a day by 1863 and double that by 1866. By 1874, annual production was 80,000 tons and it was 10 times that by 1884. The mines in Wellington were owned by Robert Dunsmuir. Initially his company was Dunsmuir, Diggle and Co but after he bought out his partners he carried on as R. Dunsmuir and Sons. The family company was sold by son James Dunsmuir in 1910 to Canadian Collieries (Dunsmuir) Ltd (CCD). The VCML mines were mainly under Nanaimo and the harbour. The East Wellington colliery was owned by R.D. Chandler of San Francisco. Peak production of the Nanaimo coal fields was 1,400,000 tons in 1922. Production declined steadily after that. The last mine in Nanaimo closed in 1968. In the early 1980s the Wolf mountain coal mine opened up and produced coal from the Wellington seam until 1987.
Locations shown are generally for the main shaft entrance although some mines, Extension No. 8 for example, had numerous slope shaft entrances as well.

Aloha Air Cargo

Aloha Air Cargo is an American cargo airline headquartered in Honolulu CDP, City and County of Honolulu, Hawaii, operating from a hub at Honolulu International Airport. Formerly part of Aloha Airlines, it became an independent cargo operator following the closure of the passenger airline in 2008.
History.
Aloha Airlines was formed in 1946 and expanded over the next few decades. It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2004 an attempt to cut costs and remain competitive with other airlines serving Hawaii. Following approval of new labor contracts and securing additional investment from new investors, the airline emerged from bankruptcy protection on February 17, 2006. The airline filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection again on March 20, 2008. Ten days later, on March 30, 2008, Aloha Airlines announced the suspension of all scheduled passenger flights, with the final day of operation to be March 31, 2008.
After the shutdown of passenger operations, Aloha and its creditors sought to auction off its profitable cargo and contract services division. Several companies expressed interest in purchasing Aloha's cargo division, including Seattle-based Saltchuk Resources, California-based Castle & Cooke Aviation, and Hawaii-based Kahala Capital (which included Richard Ing, a minority investor in the Aloha Air Group and member of Aloha's board of directors). However, a disagreement between cargo division bidders and Aloha's primary lender, GMAC Commercial Finance, ended with the bidders dropping out of the auction. Almost immediately afterwards, GMAC halted all funding to Aloha's cargo division, forcing all cargo operations to cease; at the same time, Aloha's board of directors decided to convert its Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization filing into a Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation.
Saltchuk Resources decided to renew its bid to purchase the cargo division at the urging of U.S. Senator Daniel Inouye, and a deal between Aloha and Saltchuk was struck and approved by the federal bankruptcy court, where Saltchuk would purchase the cargo division for $10.5 million. The sale was approved by federal Bankruptcy Judge Lloyd King on May 12, 2008, with the sale expected to close two days later.
Prior to its bid for Aloha, Saltchuk Resources was already present in Hawaii through its subsidiaries Young Brothers/Hawaiian Tug & Barge, Hawaii Fuel Network, Maui Petroleum and Minit Stop Stores. The company also owns Northern Air Cargo, Alaska's largest cargo airline. A new subsidiary, Aeko Kula Inc., was set up by Saltchuk to operate Aloha Air Cargo.
On the May 15, 2008 the airline received its FAA and Department of Transport authority to operate as an independent airline. The airline went through a big transformation in the first two years of operation. The airline's first president, Mike Malik, rebranded the airline; launched a host of new products and services; and established "Aloha Tech Ops", the MRO division. During this time the airline won numerous awards and was named Hawaii's Cargo Airline of the year for 2008.

Youth (wind sextet)

The woodwind sextet Youth (Czech: "Mládí"), (1924) is a chamber composition by Czech composer Leoš Janáček. It was composed for flute, oboe, clarinet, French horn, bassoon and bass clarinet.
Background.
The first impulse to compose a woodwind sextet came into Janáček's mind during his visit of the festival of the "International Society of Contemporary Music" in Salzburg in August 1923. Albert Roussel´s "Divertimento for Wind Quintet and Piano" was performed here, and it is possible that this composition motivated Janáček's interest to create a similar work. Another important impulse came to Janáček with a short piece called "March of the Blue-Boys" for piccolo, bells and tambourine (or piano). It was written in May 1924 as a reminiscence of Janáček's youth in the Old Brno Monastery. He had probably already decided to write a more extensive work. The composition was created during Janáček's three weeks stay in Hukvaldy in July, 1924. At the beginning of the autumn 1924, during the rehearsals, Janáček made a number of changes to the score.
The premiere took place on October 21, 1924 in "Besední dům" in Brno. The players consisted of the Brno Conservatory teachers Josef Bok (flute and piccolo), Matěj Wagner (oboe), Stanislav Krtička (clarinet), František Janský (French horn), and the members of the "Brno National Theatre Orchestra" František Bříza (bassoon) and Karel Pavelka (bass clarinet). Unfortunately, the performance wasn't very successful. The oboist finally managed to repair a defect of his instrument, but the clarinettist, because of a broken key spring only pretended to be playing. Janáček was very angry. However, the work was performed in Prague on November 25, 1924, this time with members of the Czech Philharmonic, and the performance was received with great success. A pocket score, parts and piano arrangement by Břetislav Bakala were published in January 1925 by "Hudební matice".
"Youth" in 1925 was awarded the Prize of the Czech Academy of Sciences.
Structure.
The composition consists of four movements:
A considerable part of Janáček's chamber music was created in his later years and is considered as an outgrowth of his "youthful mood". The work is example of virtuoso use of a woodwind instrumental ensemble, but it was not only a "technical task" for Janáček. It also contains interesting musical ideas, characteristic of the composer's later style.
Janáček used the main theme from the "March of the Blue-Boys" in the third movement.

Demissionary cabinet

A demissionary cabinet (Dutch: "demissionair kabinet") is a type of caretaker cabinet in the Netherlands. 
A demissionary cabinet continues the current government after a cabinet has ended. This can either be after completion of the full term, between general elections (when the new house of representatives is installed) and the formation of a new cabinet, or after a cabinet crisis. In both cases the prime minister hands in the resignation of his cabinet to the Dutch Monarch. The Monarch will not accept full resignation until a new cabinet has been formed. Between the moment in which the prime minister hands in the resignation and the monarch installs a new cabinet, the cabinet is labelled demissionary. As a demissionary cabinet is considered a continuation of the previous cabinet, it is not counted as a new cabinet (e.g. Balkenende IV did not become Balkenende V when becoming demissionary). 
By constitutional convention, a demissionary cabinet has fewer powers than a conventional cabinet. The main aim of a demissionary cabinet is to organise elections and take care of ongoing business until the new cabinet comes into power. Thus, besides organising elections, it can only take care of urgent and pressing matters and not initiate controversial legislation. The States General decide which affairs are urgent and pressing, and which are deemed controversial. It is a custom (which is not always followed) that the opinion of minority parties is taken into account for these decisions.
A demissionary cabinet takes care of policy during elections and cabinet formation. This is relevant as the formation process can take, in comparative terms, a very long time. An example of a very long-lasting caretaker government was the cabinet Den Uyl between 22 March and 18 December 1977, during the formation of the cabinet Van Agt-I. 
In the case of the fall of a cabinet, there are several ways in which a cabinet can be a caretaker cabinet.

Basket of Bread

Basket of Bread (1945) or Basket of Bread-Rather Death Than Shame is a painting by Spanish Surrealist Salvador Dalí. The painting depicts a heel of a loaf bread in a basket, sitting near the edge of a table. Dalí's use of bread in his paintings is much more than a staple of one's diet. In this case, to understand Dalí's message, one must look at the political context at the time of the painting, his progression as an artist, his societal beliefs and how bread is used in the painting.
Progression and comparison to "The Basket of Bread" (1926).
Dalí has used bread in many of his paintings, he explains:
At 22, Dalí spent four months on the 1926 painting "The Basket of Bread", of which he explains: "by the power of its density, the fascination of its immobility, creates the mystical, paroxysmic feeling of a situation beyond our ordinary notion of the real. We are at the borderline of dematerialization of matter by the sole power of the mind."
The subject of this article, painted and completed in Monterey, California in 1945, he described to Luis Romero as "the most esoteric and the most Surrealist of anything I have painted to date," where the painting is even more dynamic by having the basket of bread placed on the edge of the table, giving a strong sense of forthcoming "borderline of dematerialization" than the painting of 1926.
Political context.
Dalí writes in the Bignou Gallery of New York catalogue that he painted "Basket of Bread" in two months, when "the most staggering and sensational episodes of contemporary history took place" and finished "one day before the end of the war".
The painting's subtitle ""Rather Death than Shame"" takes on special significance during this time period. The basket is precariously situated on the edge of the uncovered table, against a starkly black backdrop, an omen to its own sacrificial destruction.
Adolf Hitler, a well-recorded subject by Dalí, chose death rather than the inevitable shame of capture on April 30, 1945. In Dalí's essay, "The Conquest of the Irrational" written in 1935, Dalí speaks of a "moral hunger" of the modern age that the German people sought relief through Hitler and National Socialism. Dalí writes that Hitler’s followers were "systematically cretinized by machinism" and "ideological disorder", to which they "seek in vain to bite into the senile and triumphant softness of the plump, atavistic, tender, militaristic, and territorial back of any Hitlerian nursemaid." Further, this "irrational hunger is placed before a cultural dining table on which are found only ... cold and insubstantial leftovers." Hitler portrayed as the heel of a loaf of bread, on the edge of a precipice, sums up Dalí's opinion of Hitler and his ultimate demise. 
The painting was also said by Dalí to have been painted the week the atomic bombs fell on Japan. "My objective was to arrive at the immobility of the pre-explosive object", Dalí reveals. Taken in the context of the Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, "Rather Death than Shame" could also mean that it's better to have died a victim than bear the shame of having dropped the bombs .
Marshall Plan.
"Basket of Bread" was used as propaganda for the European Recovery Program, better known as the Marshall Plan from 1947 to 1951. The Marshall Plan, which earned General George C. Marshall the Nobel Peace Prize, is credited with rebuilding European nations by restoring agricultural and industrial production and thereby restoring food supply and economic infrastructure in the aftermath of World War II.
More information.
In the 1940s, William Nichols, managing editor of "This Week", saw an artist's work in an art gallery. Finding the piece, a painting of a loaf of bread, one of the most charming paintings he had ever seen he printed it in his magazine giving the artist in question his first mass audience. "This Week Magazine", a syndicated Sunday magazine, at one time had a circulation of 15 million, the biggest in the world.
The painting resides in Figueres Teatre-Museu Dalí, containing the broadest range of works of Salvador Dalí (1904–1989), managed by the Gala-Salvador Dalí Foundation.

Alfred (opera)

Alfred is a sung stage work about Alfred the Great with music by Thomas Arne and a libretto by David Mallet and James Thomson. The work was initially devised as a masque in 1740 and was first performed at Cliveden, country home of Frederick, Prince of Wales, on 1 August 1740, to commemorate the accession of George I and the birthday of the Princess Augusta. Arne later revised the work turning it into an all-sung oratorio in 1745 and then an opera in 1753. It is best known for its finale "Rule, Britannia!".
History.
In its original form, "Alfred" contained only seven musical numbers, including the famous patriotic song "Rule, Britannia!" With successive additions, Arne significantly expanded the music, and the final version was an all-sung opera in three acts. Today, the third and final version of the work is the one that is most often performed.
Frederick, a German prince who had grown up in Hanover, arrived in Britain as an adult and was on very bad terms with his father. He made considerable efforts to ingratiate himself and build a following among his subjects-to-be (although he never ultimately reigned, as he died before his father in 1751). A masque linking the prince with both the ancient hero-king Alfred the Great's victories over the Vikings, together with the contemporary issue of building British sea-power, went well with his political plans and aspirations.
Thomson was a Scottish poet and playwright who spent most of his adult life in England and hoped to make his fortune at Court. He had an interest in helping foster a British identity, including and transcending the older English and Scottish identities.

John McLachlan

John McLachlan (1840–1915) was a New Zealand Member of Parliament for Ashburton in the South Island.
Early life.
McLachlan was born in Ardrossan, Ayrshire, Scotland, in 1840. He learned his father's trade as a plaster. He came to New Zealand in 1863 by the ship "Sebastopol" and arrived at Lyttelton. After some time spent in looking around the country, he chose land near Lake Ellesmere / Te Waihora and became a farmer.
His brothers, sister and his mother followed him to New Zealand.
Member of Parliament.
McLachlan stood for election in the Selwyn electorate for the Canterbury Provincial Council, but was defeated by Edward Jollie.
McLachlan unsuccessfully contested the electorate in the and was beaten by John Hall. He represented the Ashburton electorate in the House of Representatives for twelve years (–1896; –1908).
He was a colourful character in Parliament.
""The representative of Ashburton"", wrote a newspaper reporter, ""is about the wildest looking specimen in the Parliamentary collection. But if he is in the rough to gaze on, he can give 'points' to some more ornamental members in the matter of ability and originality of thought and expression. He is a sturdily built, carelessly dressed man, with a large head, made to look larger by the wild disorder of a huge shock of curly hair. He is a farmer and might have stepped out of his market trap into his place in the House. He is, as a rule, a breezy, happy-go-lucky sort of member with a good sense of humour and a fine stock of anecdotes and a great admiration for and acquaintance with the writings of Robert Burns.""
He was a leading Canterbury Presbyterian, and was known for his love of whisky. On occasions he spoke on the platform or in the house while intoxicated and made a fool of himself, and in 1894 he fell into Wellington Harbour when he mistook the lights of a ship for the lights outside a chemist’s shop where he had lodgings. In 1907 he was 'almost certainly' the subject of a complaint by J. T. Marryat Hornsby to the Speaker about his language and his intoxicated condition in the house, which the Premier promised to have put right. 
Alexander McLachlan, a son of John, was a farmer and mill owner and Labour candidate for Mataura at the 1919 election.

Spar varnish

Spar varnish is a wood finishing varnish.
Spar varnish was originally developed for coating the spars of sailing ships. These formed part of the masts and rigging, so suffered a hard life in service. They were flexed by the wind loads they supported, attacked by sea and bad weather, and also suffered from UV degradation from long-term exposure to sunlight.
The most important condition for such varnishes to resist was the mechanical flexing. This required a varnish that was flexible and elastic. Without elasticity, the varnish would soon crack, allowing water to penetrate to the wood beneath. At the time, varnish production was rudimentary and had only simple materials with which to work. It pre-dated the development of modern polymer chemistry. Spar varnish was a 'short oil' varnish, where a small proportion of a finishing oil, universally boiled linseed oil, was added to a majority proportion of varnish (see Danish oil for a 'long oil' finish). This gave flexibility, even though its weather resistance was still poor and relatively frequent re-coating was required.
In modern times, 'spar varnish' has become a genericised term for any outdoor varnish. Owing to modern varnish materials, their weather resistance is likely to be good, but the original requirement for flexibility has largely been forgotten.

Izmail Sreznevsky

Izmail Ivanovich Sreznevsky (; 13 June 1812, Yaroslavl - 21 February 1880, St. Petersburg) was a towering figure in 19th-century Slavic studies. 
His father, Ivan Sreznevsky, was a prolific translator of Latin poetry who taught at the Demidov Lyceum in Yaroslavl before moving to Kharkov University. It was in Kharkov that Sreznevsky graduated in philology (in 1829) and gained a professorship (in 1842). He was a notable figure in the Ukrainian literary revival and compiled several multi-volume anthologies of local folklore, including "Zaporozhian Antiquities". In 1839-42 he undertook a tour through every major library of Central and Eastern Europe with a view toward consulting the oldest extant Slavic manuscripts.
In 1847 Sreznevsky moved to St. Petersburg, where he applied himself to the task of preparing a comprehensive dictionary of the Old Russian language. This work spanned several decades and involved the study and publication of numerous obscure medieval texts and codices, including Codex Zographensis (in 1856), Codex Marianus (in 1866), and Kiev Fragments (in 1874). Sreznevsky's "pièce de résistance", "The Materials for a Dictionary of the Old Russian Language", though incomplete, was published posthumously in three volumes (1893-1903) and was reprinted with an addendum in 1912, 1958, and 1988. It was superseded only with the publication of a 24-volume academic dictionary in 1975-99.
Sreznevsky was the founding father of the Russian Language Department of the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences (of which he was elected a member in 1851) and the St. Petersburg academic school of Slavic studies. As early as 1849, he delivered a series of lectures on the history and evolution of the Russian language, the first such work of a scholarly type. His influential outline of Slavonic palaeography was published in 1885. A long list of his students at St. Petersburg University includes Alexander Pypin, Nikolai Chernyshevsky, Nikolay Dobrolyubov, and Vladimir Lamansky (who published his biography in 1890).

History of the Jews in Alsace

[[File:Strasbourg ancienne Synagogue quai Kléber 1898.jpg|thumb|250px|Synagogue du Quai Kléber, Strasbourg, inaugurated in 1898, burnt and razed by the Nazis in 1940]]
The history of the Jews in Alsace is one of the oldest in Europe. It was first attested in 1165 by Benjamin of Tudela, who wrote about a "large number of learned men" in "Astransbourg", and it is assumed that it dates back until around the year 1000 CE. Although Jewish life in Alsace was often disrupted by outbreaks of pogroms, at least during the Middle Ages, and reined in by harsh restrictions on business and movement, it has had a continuous existence ever since it was first recorded. At its peak, in 1870, the Jewish community of Alsace numbered 35,000 people.
Language and origins.
The language traditionally spoken by the Jews of Alsace is "Yédisch-Daïtsch" or Judeo-Alsatian, originally a mixture of German, Hebrew and Aramaic idioms and virtually indistinguishable from genuine Yiddish. From the 12th century onwards, due among other things to the influence of the nearby Rashi school, French linguistic elements aggregated as well, and from the 18th century onwards, some Polish elements due to immigrants blended into Yédisch-Daïtsch too.
Medieval antisemitism and massacre of 1349.
Several disparaging representations of Jews in medieval Alsatian art, usually showing them with the characteristic three-pointed hat, have survived and can still be seen "in situ", notably on the tympanum of the romanesque "Église Saints-Pierre-et-Paul" in Sigolsheim, on the roof of the "Église Saints-Pierre-et-Paul" in Rosheim and the "Église Saint-Léger" in Guebwiller (both romanesque as well and showing a seated Jew holding a money purse), on Strasbourg Cathedral and on the gothic "Collégiale Saint-Martin" in Colmar, which shows no less than two different representations of a "Judensau". Other medieval representations have survived through copies of the Hortus deliciarum and as architectural fragments in the Musée de l’Œuvre Notre-Dame. Stained glass windows in the Niederhaslach Church, frescoes in the "Église Saint-Michel" of Weiterswiller and a tapestry in the "Église Saints-Pierre-et-Paul" of Neuwiller-lès-Saverne also show disparaging representations of Jews in traditional attire.
In 1286, rabbi Meir of Rothenburg, one of the leading Jewish figures of his day, was imprisoned by the German king in a fortress near Ensisheim.
In 1349, Jews of Alsace were accused of poisoning the wells with plague. On February 14, Saint Valentine's day, thousands of Jews were massacred during the Strasbourg pogrom. Jews were subsequently forbidden to settle in the town and were reminded every evening at 10 o'clock by a Cathedral bell and a municipal herald blowing the "Grüselhorn" to leave. Alsatian Jews then settled in the neighbouring villages and small towns, where many of them became cloth merchants ("Schmatteshendler") or cattle merchants ("Behemeshendler").
Early modern times.
An important political figure for the Jews of Alsace and beyond was the long-serving "shtadlan" Josel of Rosheim. In 1510 he was made the "parnas u-manhig" (sworn guide and leader) of the Jewish communities of Lower Alsace, before becoming the German Emperor's favourite interlocutor on Jewish matters and the most influential intercessor on the Jew's behalf.
French rule until 1871.
With the annexation of Alsace to France in 1681, Catholicism was restored as the principal Christian current. However, the prohibition laid on Jews to settle in Strasbourg, and the special taxes they were subjected to, were not lifted. In the 18th century, Herz Cerfbeer of Medelsheim, the influential merchant and philanthropist, became the first Jew to be allowed to settle in the Alsatian capital again. The French Revolution then admitted Jews back into the town.
By 1790, the Jewish population of Alsace was approximately 22,500, about 3% of the provincial population. Another 7500 Jews lived in neighboring Lorraine. Together they comprised three-fourths of the 40,000 Jews who lived in France at the time. The Jews were highly segregated, subject to long-standing anti-Jewish regulations. They maintain their own customs, Yiddish language, and historic traditions within the tightly-knit ghettos; they adhered to Talmudic law enforced by their rabbis. Jews were barred from most cities and instead lived in hundreds of small hamlets and villages. They were also barred from most occupations, and concentrated in trade, services, and especially in moneylending. They financed about a third of the mortgages in Alsace. Leading philosophes of the French Enlightenment, such as Denis Diderot and Voltaire, ridiculed and condemned French Jews as misanthropic, rapacious, and culturally backward. In 1777, a local judge forged hundreds of receipts, which he gave to Catholic peasants, to prove they had repaid their debts to Jewish moneylenders. The Jews protested, and a Prussian official Christian Wilhelm von Dohm wrote a highly influential pamphlet “On the Civic Improvement of the Jews” (1781), which advanced the cause of Jewish emancipation in both Germany and France. 
Tolerance grew during the French Revolution, with full emancipation given Protestants in 1789, Sephardic Jews in 1790, and the Ashkenazi (Yiddish-speaking) Jews of Alsace and Lorraine in 1791. When Napoleon created the "Grand Sanhedrin" in 1806, he appointed the Chief Rabbi of Strasbourg, Joseph David Sinzheim, as its first President. However, local antisemitism also increased and Napoleon turned hostile in 1806, imposing a moratorium on all debts owed to Jews. In 1808 Napoleon imposed tight limitations on all Jewish moneylending, capping interest rates at 5% Napoleon's decrees collapsed after he fell from power but, but an undercurrent of antisemitism remained. In the 1830-1870 era, urban middle-class Jews made enormous progress toward integration in an acculturation, as antisemitism sharply declined. By 1831, the state began paying salaries to official rabbis, and 1846 a special oath for Jews in court was discontinued. Anti-Semitic riots occasionally occurred, especially during the Revolution of 1848. In 1854, Isaac Strauss becomes director of orchestra of the "bals de l'Opéra" and then of the "bals des Tuileries", before his replacement by Émile Waldteufel, in 1867 by the empress Eugénie de Montijo. Many conversions to Christianity followed: David Paul Drach, Francis Libermann or Alphonse Ratisbonne. Merger of Alsace into Germany in 1871-1918 lessened antisemitic violence.
Dreyfus affair.
While the Dreyfus affair by and large played out in France, and Alsace was in Germany, it had immediate repercussions on the Jews in Alsace. Alfred Dreyfus was by birth a citizen of Mulhouse and thus suspected by French conservatives of innate sympathy with the German enemy by virtue of his being Alsatian and Jewish, and put him under suspicion of being thus doubly disloyal. One of the alleged traitor's most stubborn advocates was the fellow Mulhousian Auguste Scheurer-Kestner, a (non-Jewish) chemist, industrialist, politician and philanthropist. Another main player of the Affair, and advocate of Dreyfus' cause, was the Strasbourg-born army general Georges Picquart.
1940–1945.
In 1940, Alsace was again annexed to Germany. The evacuation of the Jews of Alsace had started already on 3 September 1939, mostly to Périgueux and Limoges. On 15 July 1940, the last expulsion of Jews from Alsace took place. 2,605 Jews from Bas-Rhin and 1,100 from Haut-Rhin were murdered during the Holocaust. Some were victims of the experiments of August Hirt at the Reichsuniversität Straßburg.
Business men like Théophile Bader, founder of the Galeries Lafayette, Pierre Wertheimer, founder of the entreprise Bourjois and partner of Coco Chanel or Albert Kahn, banker and philanthropist face spoliation or deportation.
Jews in Alsace today.
After the Algerian war, Sephardi Jews came to Alsace in 1962 from North Africa. In the year 2000, roughly 4,000 Jews in Strasbourg were Sephardic, making up for a little over 25% of the total Jewish population. In the year 2001, roughly 25% of the 500 Jewish families of Mulhouse were Sephardic.
Presentation of Alsatian Jewish history and heritage.
A presentation of the Alsatian Jews's history and culture through collections of artifacts and architectural elements can be found in the "Musée Judéo-Alsacien" of Bouxwiller, Bas-Rhin, in the "Musée du bain rituel juif" (Mikvah museum) of Bischheim, in the "Musée alsacien" and the "Musée historique" of Strasbourg, in the "Musée historique" of Haguenau, in the "Musée d'Arts et Traditions Populaires" of Marmoutier, in the "Musée du vieux Soultz" of Soultz-Haut-Rhin, in the "Musée du pays de la Zorn" of Hochfelden, in the "Musée de l'image populaire" of Pfaffenhoffen and in the "Musée Bartholdi" of Colmar.
The annual European Day of Jewish Culture had been initiated in 1996 by the B'nai Brith of Bas-Rhin together with the local Agency for development of tourism. It now includes 27 European countries including Turkey and Ukraine. The original aim of the day was to permit access to, and ultimately restoration of, long abandoned synagogues of architectural value like those of Wolfisheim, Westhoffen, Pfaffenhoffen, Struth, Diemeringen, Ingwiller or Mackenheim.

Gilles Bernheim

Gilles Uriel Bernheim (; born 30 May 1952) is a French philosopher and rabbi who was formerly the Chief Rabbi of France. Born in Aix-les-Bains, Savoie, in 1952, he was elected by the general assembly of the Central Consistory chief rabbi of France on June 22, 2008, for a seven-year mandate starting from January 1, 2009. Until then, he had been rabbi of synagogue de la Victoire, the main synagogue in Paris, since May 1, 1997. The Chief Rabbi of France was long renowned as an eminent scholar, whose intellect shone beyond the Jewish community to enlighten politicians. However, he resigned as chief rabbi in April 2013 before his term had ended, amid revelations of plagiarism and deception about his academic credentials.
He succeeded chief rabbi Joseph Sitruk. He was very critical of the lifting of the excommunication of bishop Richard Williamson.
The French Government appointed him Knight in the Légion d'honneur, on April 10, 2009.
Career as chief rabbi.
In October 2012, he took a clear position against gay marriage in a plagiarized essay entitled ""Mariage homosexuel, homoparentalité et adoption : ce que l’on oublie souvent de dire"" (approximately equivalent to ""Gay marriage, gay parenting and adoption: What we frequently forget to mention"" in English) 
This essay found a strong echo in Roman Catholic circles, culminating in Pope Benedict XVI quoting him at length in his annual address
to the Roman Curia, 21 December 2012 
""The Chief Rabbi of France, Gilles Bernheim, has shown in a very detailed and profoundly moving study that the attack we are currently experiencing on the true structure of the family, made up of father, mother, and child, goes much deeper."
Personal.
Bernheim's father was a wood seller and died when he was 14. His mother, Berthe (Blime), née Klein, is a former pupil of Antoinette Feuerwerker and was a teacher of mathematics. His wife is a psychoanalyst, and he is the father of four children.
Gilles Bernheim was a student of in Paris.
Plagiarism and qualification scandal.
The affair started in early March when the Strass de la Philosophie blog revealed that a passage on hasidic exegesis from Bernheim’s work was almost identical to an interview of the philosopher Jean-Francois Lyotard that appears in the 1996 book "Questioning Judaism" by Elisabeth Weber.
Bernheim acknowledged that his that his 2011 book “40 Jewish Meditations” contained one passage that his ghostwriter plagiarized without Bernheim’s knowledge. “I have been fooled,” he wrote. “However, I am responsible. I apologize to the authors whose texts have been copied, to the people who have read these 'meditations' and to my publisher who was not informed of the existence of an outsider.”
It was also revealed that he did not actually qualify for the prestigious title of ""agrégé" of philosophy" that had often been attributed to him. The agrégé title required passing a rigorous examination that was necessary for becoming a professor of philosophy. While he may not have directly claimed to hold that qualification, he had allowed others to refer to him using the title without clarifying his actual status.
Le Figaro reported that “there was heavy pressure” on the part of unnamed officials from the Jewish community for Bernheim to resign. On April 11, 2013 he resigned as chief rabbi.

Dutch cabinet formation

The formation of a Dutch cabinet is the process of negotiating an agreement that will get majority support in parliament and results in the appointment of the council of ministers. Dutch cabinet formations tend to be a time consuming process, and is for the most part not codified in the constitution.
Formation process.
The cabinet of the Netherlands is the executive body of the Dutch government. It consists of ministers and junior ministers (staats-secretaris). The cabinet requires support from both chambers of the Dutch parliament to pass laws. Thus to form a stable government sufficient, and most preferably majority support in both chambers is required.
Due to several factors--the multi-party system and the nationwide party-list system of proportional representation--no political party (in the modern sense) has ever had a majority in parliament since 1900. Indeed, since the adoption of the current proportional representation system in 1918, no party has even come close to the number of seats needed for a majority in its own right. To gain sufficient support in both chambers it is therefore necessary to reach an agreement of multiple parties to form a stable government. The negotiations leading to this agreement are the cabinet formation period in the Netherlands.
Cabinet formation is engaged in, in two situations. After general elections the house of representatives is renewed. The changing size of party representations in this most important of the two chambers, will require a new cabinet to be constituted. Even if the same parties continue, the agreement has to be renegotiated to fit election promises and shift in powers. Another reason for cabinet formation can be the fall of a cabinet, i.e. those cases where the agreement between parties breaks down. In the latter case (in principle) a new cabinet can be formed without general elections, although in practice the house of representatives is almost always disbanded and early general elections are called. 
Forming a cabinet can be a time-consuming process. The monarch has a formal role in appointing the newly created cabinet and in accepting the resignation of a fallen cabinet. Traditionally the monarch played an important advisory role in cabinet formation process, although this role comes from tradition and convention only.
Advice.
First, the monarch has private individual meetings with the Presidents of the Senate and House of Representatives and the vice-president of the Dutch Council of State. Next, the monarch meets the chairs of each parliamentary party in the House of Representatives, the political leaders of all parties. The talks concern how to interpret the election results, which parties should form the new cabinet and who should be appointed (in)formateur. Because this advice is a matter of public record, the monarch cannot easily take a direction which is contrary to the advice of a majority in parliament. On the other hand, the substance of talks behind the closed doors of the palace remains undisclosed.
Information phase.
On basis of this advice, the monarch then appoints an informateur who explores the options for a new cabinet. The informateur often is a relative outsider and a veteran politician who has retired from active politics: a member of the Senate, Council of State or a minister of state. He generally has a background in the largest party in the House of Representatives. It is also possible to appoint multiple informateurs, with backgrounds in other prospective partners. The informateur is given a specific task by the monarch, often to "seek a coalition of parties with coalition agreement and a majority in parliament." The informateur has meetings with individual chairs of parliamentary parties, and chairs sessions of negotiations between them. During these negotiations the parties barter, abandoning some policy goals to achieve others.
Formation phase.
If the informateur is unsuccessful, he tenders his resignation and the process starts again, with new consultations and the appointment of a new informateur. If he is successful, he returns to the monarch, who then appoints a "formateur." Conventionally he is the leader of the largest party in the prospective coalition and thus also the prospective prime minister. The formateur leads negotiations between parties willing to cooperate to form a cabinet. He leads the talks about all the issues the informateur has not resolved. Often these include the coalition agreement, the distribution of government portfolios and the personal nominations to the cabinet.
If the formateur is successful, the monarch formally invites him to form a government, then appoints all ministers and state secretaries individually by Royal Decree ("Koninklijk Besluit"). Each minister declares an oath of loyalty to the Constitution in private. After this the entire Council of Ministers and the monarch are photographed on the stairs of Huis ten Bosch palace. The newly minted ministers all tender their resignations from the House of Representatives, as cabinet ministers aren't allowed to be members of Parliament. The new cabinet then proposes its plans to parliament, and is confirmed in office.
Demissionary cabinet.
After the dissolution of parliament and before the appointment of a new cabinet, the incumbent cabinet stays on as a demissionary cabinet, limiting itself to urgent and pressing matters and traditionally not taking any controversial decisions. If the cabinet fell because one of the parties removed its support, it is possible for the ministers and state secretaries representing that party to leave the cabinet without the cabinet becoming demissionary: the other parties then continue to form a new cabinet, which is called a rump cabinet, often a minority government. It is also possible for the monarch to ask the ministers to remain demissionary in office until a new parliament has been elected.
Importance of the formation.
The formation is often considered as important as or the elections themselves - or even more important. This is because the coalition agreement lays down most of the policies for the future cabinet.
Criticism.
The process has been criticized for many reasons. First, it takes place out of public and parliament's view, which means democratic control over the process is limited. Second, a competent Monarch can have a decisive personal influence on which coalition is formed. Finally, it can all take a very long time, normally months. In 1977 it took seven months. During this period the cabinet cannot launch any new initiatives.
There have often been proposals to codify the procedure in the constitution and make it more democratic. One proposal is to let the population elect the Prime Minister separately. This has always been rejected because it might result in a prime minister being elected at the same time as a parliamentary majority of opposing political signature. A less radical proposal is to let the parliament appoint the formateur and informateur, and making the responsible to parliament.

Aldin Grange for Bearpark railway station

Aldin Grange for Bearpark railway station was located on the Lanchester Valley Railway that operated in County Durham, England. The railway station opened in 1883 as Aldin Grange, and was renamed Aldin Grange for Bearpark about a year later. In 1927 its name was changed to Bearpark. The station closed to passengers in 1939, although miners' gala excursions used the line until 1954, and freight then used the line until 1965.
History.
Opened as part of the North Eastern Railway, it became part of the London and North Eastern Railway during the Grouping of 1923, and that company withdrew regular passenger services in 1939. Occasional excursions to the Durham Miners Gala joined the goods and Bearpark Colliery traffic until the last gala excursion in 1954, after the line had passed to the Eastern Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. Goods traffic continued until 1966 and the line was lifted in 1967.
The Site Today.
Today the site is a popular walk, the Lanchester Valley Railway Path. Nothing of the station remains.

Group (stratigraphy)

A group in stratigraphy is a lithostratigraphic unit, a part of the geologic record or rock column that consists of defined rock strata. Groups are generally divided into individual formations. Groups may sometimes be divided into "subgroups" and are themselves sometimes grouped into "supergroups".
Some well known groups of northwestern Europe have in the past also been used as units for chronostratigraphy and geochronology. These are the Rotliegend, Zechstein (both of Permian age), Buntsandstein, Muschelkalk, Keuper (Triassic in age), Lias, Dogger and Malm (Jurassic in age) groups. Because of the confusion this causes, the official geologic timescale of the ICS does not contain any of these names any longer.

Wintney Priory

Wintney Priory was a priory of Cistercian nuns in Hartley Wintney, Hampshire, England.
Foundation.
The priory was founded in the twelfth century, dedicated to the Blessed Virgin and St. Mary Magdalene. There is some uncertainty over the name of the founder, the obituary of the convent calendar states that Richard Holte and Christine his wife, the daughter of Thomas Cobreth, founded the house and Geoffrey Fitz Peter founded the first church. But Leland states that the founders were Roger Cobreth and his son Thomas. The Cobreth family clearly had close associations with the priory since various members were benefactors and one Dame Diana Cobreth had her heart buried before the high altar.
Twelfth to sixteenth centuries.
The original temporary church or chapel was replaced in 1234 by a stone church, founded by Richard de Herriard. Several other members of the de Herriard family were benefactors of the convent.
In 1316 the priory's finances were in a poor state due to 'negligance and poor administration' and the nuns were dispersing since there were no provisions being made for their food. This was perhaps related to the famines of 1315 and subsequent years. The Archbishop of Canterbury instituted a commission with full powers "to visit the nunnery and to inquire, correct, reform and punish the excesses of delinquents". This seems to have turned matters around by the 1320s. However in 1398 and again in 1404 the priory was exempted from collection of the second moiety of the tenth "because it is a house of poor nuns heavily encumbered".
Occasionally the convent's superiors were termed abbesses rather than prioresses.
The church of St. Mary, Hartley Wintney was included in the original endowment and the prioress and nuns presented the vicars till the Dissolution.
Dissolution.
On 23 May 1536 commissioners visited the priory of Wintney, "a hedde house of nuns, order of Cisteaux." They estimated its annual value at £52 5s. 8d. and found there ten nuns, "by reporte of good conversation, which trooly desieren to contynue in the same religion." There were also two priests, a waiting servant, thirteen hinds, nine woman servants, and two 'corediers' with their two servants. The church and mansion were in good repair save the tiling, but the kitchen and brewhouse were in great decay.
The priory was surrendered on 22 July 1536.
Post-Dissolution.
A grant of the site and lands of the prioress was given to Sir William Poulet, comptroller of the king's household, in August 1536. In May 1538 "the house and site of the dissolved priory of Wintney, with the church, steeple and churchyard of the same, the manor and rectory of Hartley Wintney and all lands pertaining" was granted to Richard Hill and Elizabeth his wife. A letter of 1538 from Richard Poulet to Mr. Hill ordered him "in the name of the king's commissioners, to cease to deface any of the buildings of the late priory of Wintney besides those which the king had given him, which were only the cloister and the dorter".
Present day.
An eighteenth-century farmhouse, Wintney Farm stands on the site of the priory. The old parish church of St. Mary, which was originally a substantial church of the 13th and 14th centuries, and hence extant when the convent existed, still remains.

Slave Market with the Disappearing Bust of Voltaire

Slave Market with the Disappearing Bust of Voltaire (1940) is a painting by Spanish Surrealist Salvador Dalí. The painting depicts a slave market, while a woman at a booth watches some people. A variety of people seem to make up the face of Voltaire, while the face seems to be positioned on an object to form a bust.
The painting was completed in 1940. Dalí describes his work on the painting "to make the abnormal look normal and the normal look abnormal."

Femarelle (DT56a)

Femarelle (DT56a) is as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) for the treatment of menopause and bone health. Femarelle contains approximately 322 mg DT56a (a tofu extract) and 108 mg flaxseed powder.
Mode of action.
In animal models, Femarelle exerts agonistic (stimulatory) activity on estrogen receptors in the brain and bone. The compound has been reported to alleviate menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes and elevate bone mineral density (BMD), while having no proliferative effects on isolated breast cancer cell lines and uterine tissues of rats. 
Femarelle was found to regenerate the bone through increased osteoblast activity, which makes it a possible agent for postmenopausal bone loss. 
Although stimulating estrogen receptors, Femarelle does not appear to change the hormonal blood profile. A recent study found that Femarelle has no effect on clotting in both healthy and thrombophilic women.
Quality issues and regulatory concerns.
Femarelle is not a standardized drug. According to an European Food Safety Authority panel, the food/constituent for which the claim is made, i. e. Femarelle®, has not been sufficiently characterized and the presented studies by the manufacturer do not support its purported effects.
Trade names.

Privileged access

In the fields of epistemology and philosophy of mind it is said the first person (the subject, the self) has "privileged access" to his own thoughts. This implies the subject has access to (and knows) his own thoughts (has self-knowledge) in such a way that the third person (others) do not. Privileged access can be characterized in two ways:
What philosophers say.
The still prevailing traditional position argues each of us do in fact have privileged access to our own thoughts. Descartes is the paradigmatic proponent of such kind of view (even though "privileged access" is an anachronic label for his thesis):
For Descartes, we still have privileged access even in the doubt scenario. That is, for him we would retain self-knowledge even in those extreme situations in which we can't have knowledge about anything else.
Gilbert Ryle, on the other hand, maintains a diametrically opposed view. According to the behaviorism of Ryle, each of us knows our own thoughts in the same way we know other's thoughts. We only come to know the thoughts of others through their linguistic and bodily behaviors, and must do exactly the same in order to know our own thoughts. There is no privileged access. We only have access to what we think upon evidences supplied through our own actions.

Indefinite pronouns and adjectives.
The interrogative pronouns "kъto, čьto" can also have the indefinite meanings of 'anybody', 'anything' respectively.
The prefix "ně-" imparts an indefinite meaning to the word to which it is attached: thus "kъto" ('who?') becomes "někъto" ('someone'), and "čьto" ('what?') becomes "něčьto" ('something'). Similarly, the prefix "ni-" imparts a negative meaning: "nikъto" ('no one'), "ničьto" ('nothing'). A prepositions may come between prefix and base word:
Adjectives.
OCS adjectives can be in two forms: short and long, corresponding to indefinite and definite meaning respectively. The long form is generally used only attributively, whereas the short form is predicative in nature. So, e.g., "člověkъ dobrъ" "a good man, man is good" whilst "člověkъ dobryi" "the good man, the man who is good".
Indefinite adjectives are inflected as the corresponding nouns of the primary declension, e.g., "novъ" as "rabъ", "nova" as "žena", "novo" as "selo", "ništь" as "vračь", "ništa" as "duša", "nište" as "polje".
Definite adjectives (also known as compound, long, or pronominal forms of adjective) are formed by suffixing to the indefinite form the anaphoric third-person pronoun "jь" (spelled as "i" in OCS orthography), "ja, je" as shown in the table.

Adjective gradation.
There are three levels of adjective gradation in OCS:
Superlative.
The superlative is formed:
The absolute superlative is formed:
Numerals.
Ordinals.
All ordinals are inflected like the corresponding adjectives.
Verbs.
Present.
The present tense is formed by adding present-tense endings onto the present tense stem, which itself is sometimes hidden due to sound changes that have occurred in the past (more common verbs are listed):
There are several classes of verbs:
1. e-type verbs add the interfix "-e-" to the present stem (except in front of "") and the endings:
2. i-type verbs exhibit the same set of endings, but this time the interfix is "-i-" (except in front of ' and '). In the first person singular one finds the processes of iotation ("k/c + j > č, g/z + j > ž, x/s + j > š, l + j > lj, n + j > nj, t + j > št, d + j > žd") and epenthesis ("bj > blj, pj > plj, mj > mlj, vj > vlj"):
3. The athematic verbs "byti", "dati", "věděti", "iměti" and "jasti" form the present tense irregularly:
One should distinguish the verbs "iměti" ("imamь, imaši, imatъ"), "imati" (, jemleši, jemletъ") and "jęti" (, imeši, imetъ"). Exceptional is also the verb "xotěti" which exhibits iotation even though it's not an i-type verb (, xošteši, xoštetъ").
Asigmatic aorist.
The asigmatic aorist (also called root or simple aorist) was named after the loss of the phoneme /s/ in the inflection (AGr. "sigma"), i.e. there is no "VsV > VxV" change (intervocalic /s/ yielding /x/). Over time, the asigmatic aorist became increasingly marked as an archaic language feature and was eventually replaced by the other two aorist formations.
The asigmatic aorist was formed by adding to the infinitive stem of e-type verbs with stem ending in a consonant (i.e. verbs with the infix "", which is dropped before the aorist endings, and verbs with the null infix) the following endings: -ъ, -e, -e; -omъ, -ete, ; -ově, -eta, -ete.
Sigmatic aorist.
The sigmatic or s-aorist was formed in the following ways:
New aorist.
The new aorist (also known as ox-aorist) is formed by suffixing to the infinitive stem of e-type verbs ending in a consonant (verbs with the interfix "" and verbs with the null interfix) the interfix "-os-" ("-ox") and onto it the endings -ъ, -, -; -omъ, -te, -ę; -ově, -ta, -te. Intervocalic sigma "s" changes into "x".
The 2nd and the 3rd person singular forms are not attested and thus the asigmatic aorist forms are taken as a replacement.
Imperfect.
There are two ways of forming the imperfect:
1. If the infinitive stems ends in "-a" or "-ě", the interfix -ax- is appended (which changes to -aš- according to the first palatalization in front of "e") and onto it, the endings of the asigmatic aorist: -ъ, -e, -e; -omъ, -ete, ; -ově, -eta, -ete.
2. The other way of forming the imperfect, applying to all other verbal stems, is by adding onto the present stem the interfix -ěax- (which, in accordance with the first palatalization, is changed to "-ěaš-" in front of "e") and onto it the endings of asigmatic aorist: -ъ, -e, -e; -omъ, -ete, ; -ově, -eta, -ete.
Both of these imperfect formations often occur side by side in verbs with stem alternation:
In the texts of the OCS canon the forms are often contracted, so that ěax becomes ěx and aax becomes ax. An illustrating example is in Chernorizets Hrabar's famous work "O pismenex" "An Account of Letters":<br>
Some forms exhibit sound changes, namely palatalization or iotation in front of "ě", yat thus turning into "a". The same applies if the stem ends in "j" which is then reduced in front of yat and yat again changes into "a":
That the second form and not the first is the original one (the first being formed by the change of yat to "a") is confirmed by the imperfect paradigm of the verb "byti":
Participles.
Present active participle.
The present active participle is formed by adding the following endings to the present stem:
1. e-type verbs and athematic verbs:
2. e-type verbs whose present stem ends in a palatal:
3. i-type verbs:
Present passive participle.
The present passive participle is formed by suffixing to the present stem the endings -o/e/i + m + ъ/a/o (masculine, feminine, neuter):
1. e-type verbs and athematic verbs:
2. e-type verbs whose stem ends in a palatal:
3. i-type verbs:
Past active participle.
The past active participle is formed by suffixing to the infinitive stem the following endings:
1. e-type verbs and athematic verbs:
2. i-type verbs exhibit epenthetic "v", which eliminates hiatus:
The latter i-type verbs have twofold forms of this participle - the mentioned one of older origin, and a newer one which arose due to analogical leveling:
3. Verbs with liquid metathesis form this participle from its older stem form:
4. Irregular participles:
l-participle.
The l-participle (also known as the resultative participle or second past active participle) is formed by adding to the infinitive stem the interfix -l- and the endings ъ/a/o. If the stem ends in "-t" or "-d", this consonant is dropped.
Past passive participle.
The past passive participle is formed by suffixing to the infinitive stem the following endings:
1. Verbs with stem ending in a consonant, "-y" or "-i":
2. Verbs with stem ending in "-a" or "-ě":
3. Verbs with stem ending in "-ę", "-u", "-i" and "-ě" (obtained by liquid metathesis):
Of the latter verbs, those with stem ending in "-i" ("viti, biti" etc.) can also form the past passive participle like the verbs in the first group: "bitъ" or "bijenъ", "vitъ" or "vijenъ" etc.).
Compound tenses.
Perfect.
The perfect is formed by combining the l-participle with the imperfective present forms of the auxiliary verb "byti".
Pluperfect.
The pluperfect can be formed in multiple ways, by combining the l-participle with the perfect, imperfect or aorist formation of the auxiliary verb "byti".
Future.
The future tense is usually expressed using the present tense form of the perfective verb. Imperfective verbs form the future tense by combining the auxiliary verb ("byti, xotěti, načęti, iměti") and the infinitive.
Future perfect.
The future perfect is formed by combining the l-participle with the perfective present of the auxiliary verb "byti".
Conditional.
The conditional (or conditional-optative) modal formation is formed by combining the l-participle with special modal forms of the auxiliary verb "byti" (with unattested dual forms).
The alternate forms in the plural are formed by analogy with the aorist.
Adverbs.
Primary adverbs.
These are original adverbs with difficult to guess etymology and origin.
Derived adverbs.
Pronominal adverbs.
Pronominal adverbs are derived by suffixing pronouns (e.g., "ov" + "amo" = ovamo, "kъ" + "de" = "kъde"):
Nominal adverbs.
Nominal adverbs are derived from nominals or turn by conversion to adverbs which are in fact inflective lexemes with adverbial semantics.
Modal adverbs are created with the suffixes -o or -ě (the endings of accusative and locative singular neuter gender respectively), with no difference in meanings between suffixes, although some adverbs have only the forms in "-o" ("veselo"), and some in "-ě" ("javě").
Modal adverbs could also be formed deadjectivally by means of the interfix -ьsk- and the ending -y (by origin, the instrumental plural ending; e.g., "slověnьsky").
Adverbs could also be formed with the suffix -ь ("pravь", "različь") and are by origin probably inherited Proto-Slavic accusative forms.
Frequently occurring are the adverbialized a-stem instrumentals such as "" and also adverbially used oblique cases.
Locative adverbs are by origin mostly petrified locative case forms of nouns: "gorě", "dolě", "nizu", and the same can be said for temporal adverbs: "zimě", "polu dьne".
Prepositions.
Primary prepositions.
The primary and non-derived prepositions are of PIE and PSl. heritage:
Secondary prepositions.
The secondary prepositions are derived from adverbial expressions: "vьslědъ" from "vь slědъ", "prěžde" is a comparative form of "prědъ" etc.
Conjunctions and particles.
Conjunctions and particles are not easily separable because they sometimes function as an intensifier, and sometimes as a conjunction.

The Twelve Sisters

The legend of The Twelve Sisters or The Twelve Ladies, known as "Nang Sip Song" (นางสิบสอง) or as "Phra Rot Meri" (พระรถเมรี) in Thai and as "Puthisen Neang Kong Rei" in Khmer, is a Southeast Asian folktale based on an apocryphal Jātaka Tale, the Rathasena Jātaka of the Paññāsjātaka collection. It is one of the stories of the previous lives of Buddha in which Rathasena, the son of one of the twelve women, is the bodhisattva.
Background.
The story of the Twelve Sisters is part of the folk tradition of certain countries in Southeast Asia such as Thailand, Cambodia and Laos and the folktales derived from it come in different versions, often under different titles depending from the country. This legend was also brought to Malaysia by the Malaysian Siamese where it became popular among the Malaysian Chinese community.
It is a long story about the life of twelve sisters abandoned by their parents and adopted by an ogress (Lao "Sundara"; Khmer: "Santhomea"; Thai: Santhumala) disguised as a beautiful lady. The conclusion is the sad love story about the only surviving son of the twelve sisters, "Rathasena" (Thai: "Phra Rothasen" พระรถเสน; Khmer: "Rithisen" or "Puthisen"; Lao: "Putthasen") with "Manora" (Thai: "Meri" เมรี; Lao: "Kankari"; Khmer: "Kong Rei"), the adopted daughter of ogress "Sundara". At the end both died together upon the long and lonely shore of a lake.
Thai version.
A long time ago, there was a rich merchant and his beautiful wife who lived happily in a big house. Despite their good fortune, the couple didn't have any children. One day, they went together to a shrine and made an offering of twelve banana hands to a tree spirit. Not long thereafter the wife became pregnant and the rich man wished with all his might that the child would be a boy, but his wife gave birth to a girl. His wife, however, conceived again and again. She became pregnant twelve times and each time she had a daughter. By that time his business started to go wrong for him since the ships that took his goods to sell in another country were robbed several times. Finally the rich merchant ended up borrowing a lot of money from his friends trying to fix his business problems. Yet, no matter what he did, his family kept getting poorer.
The former rich man found it hard having so many mouths to feed. So he made a plan to abandon his daughters in the forest. He hid this plan from his wife but his youngest daughter named Phao heard about it. When their father left them alone in the deep forest, the twelve girls were able to find their way back home thanks to their younger sister who had left marks in the path. But their father tried again and this time they were not able to find their way back home. They spent days walking deeper and deeper into the forest and became very hungry. Their father had given them twelve packets of rice, but when they opened them they found out that eleven of them were filled with sand and only one had rice in it. They shared that little rice and ate it crying, lamenting their misfortune. Wandering aimlessly the twelve girls came to a lake, where they tried to catch fish to satiate their hunger. Each of the sisters succeeded in catching a fish and eleven of them playfully poked the eyes of their fish with sharp twigs, except for the youngest one who poked only one eye. 
Finally they arrived to the yaksha kingdom, where an ogress named Santhumala saw the exhausted and emaciated girls resting under a tree and decided to adopt them. The ogress transformed herself into a human being, a pleasant-looking woman, and brought the twelve sisters to her home. For many years she treated them as her own daughters and under her care the twelve girls grew up into beautiful young women. 
One day, while Santhumala was away hunting, the twelve sisters met an old man who told them that Santhumala was not a human, but an ogress who liked to eat young women like them. So they fled from the ogre kingdom and wandered for days until they arrived to a clear river where they took a bath to refresh themselves. The local king saw the twelve ladies playing in the water and fell in love with them. So he brought them to his palace and married the twelve sisters.
When Santhumala came back to her home and found that the girls were gone, she flew into a rage. She quickly found out where they were and transformed herself into a very beautiful young woman, more beautiful than any of the twelve sisters; then she went to the city of the king and asked to meet him. The king was spellbound by Santhumala's beauty and swiftly married her, promoting her to the rank of first queen. 
Jealous of the king's favoritism, the Twelve Sisters were not kind to the new queen. Although they were polite to her in front of the king, they were often mean to her in private. 
To take her revenge from the Twelve Sisters, Santhumala, the favorite queen, feigned sickness and the king became worried. She told the king that the cause of her disease was the ill-treatment of the twelve other wives and the only thing that would heal her would be a medicine distilled from the eyes of the Twelve Sisters.
The king was so infatuated with Santhumala that he assented. Under his orders eleven of his wives had both of their eyes gouged out, but the youngest one had only one eye removed. Following this the Twelve Sisters were banished to a deep dark cave from where there was no way out. Then the king instructed his servants not to bring any food and not to help the Twelve Sisters in any way.
All the twelve sisters were pregnant and they all successively gave birth to babies but all died. Since the women were being starved under Santhumala's strict orders, each one chopped her baby's body into twelve pieces to share with the other sisters to eat. When Phao gave birth to a beautiful boy who was alive, she lied to her sisters that her son was dead. Phao named her son Rothasen and looked after him well. As he grew he found a secret way out of the deep cave. He had a cock that won in all the cockfights. With the prize money he bought rice and from then onward he brought regularly food for his mother and his eleven aunts. As years went by Rothasen became a handsome young man. When the king heard of him, he invited him to the palace where he played games of dice with the monarch displaying great skill. 
Santhumala found out that twelve sisters were alive and she was angry that her plan to get rid had failed. Again she feigned sickness and told the king that only a certain fruit growing in her kingdom could cure her. She also told the king that only Phra Rothasen would be able to fetch it. So she wrote the following letter to her adoptive daughter, Meri, in the language of the ogres: ""If this young man arrives to our kingdom in the morning, devour him in the morning; but if he arrives in the night, devour him in the night" 
On the way to the kingdom Phra Rothasen met an old Rshi who gave him a flying horse named Pachi to ride and who gave him hospitality. While the boy slept the sage altered the meaning of the letter by replacing the words "devour him" with "marry him".
Thus, when he arrived at the kingdom of the ogres Phra Rothasen went straight to Meri and showed her the letter. Meri was surprised and pleased at seeing the virtuous-looking and handsome young man and she fell in love with him, celebrating her wedding with him straight away as directed.
Meri was a kind-hearted and beautiful lady and Phra Rothasen lived with her very happily for some time, but he remembered his blind mother and aunts who still stayed in the dark cave. While showing him the palace, Meri had told Rothasen about certain magic medicines kept in a locked room including Phra Rothasen's mother and aunts's eyes. Then he made a plan to get Meri to sleep by making her drink wine and take the eyes for his mother and aunts. Thus one night, after Meri was sleeping, Phra Rothasen stole many medicines and the eyes from the locked room. Meri woke up and looked for her husband but she saw him far away riding his flying horse. She suddenly grew into a giant and followed Phra Rothasen crying and calling him with a loud voice. To stop her, Phra Rothasen threw a magic branch that turned the space between them into a deep lake and a high mountain. Seeing her husband escape from her Meri wailed in despair, asking him to stop. Phra Rothasen was moved by her sad screams and replied that he will back after he finished his urgent mission. Then Phra Rothasen flew away and left Meri with a broken heart crying bitterly at the shore of the lake.
Phra Rothasen arrived back to his city and killed evil Santhumala with a magic club. He then went into the deep dark cave and healed the eyes of his mother and aunts by putting them back in their place with a special magic ointment. His mother and aunts left their deep cave and regained their former status with the king. They invited him to live in the palace again but Phra Rothasen told them that he had to hurry back to live with Meri who was waiting for him.
But meanwhile Meri had died of sorrow. During her long wait she had shed so many tears that she had become blind. Before she died, she solemnly vowed that she would follow Phra Rothasen in every future reincarnation. Then she died with her grandmother crying at her side and surrounded by her servants. 
When Phra Rothasen arrived to the ogre kingdom he realized it was too late. He heard about her vow and carried his wife's body. Full of sadness at having lost everything, he dropped dead while holding his wife in his arms.
Finally, their spirits flew together to their next rebirth where they would be joined again.
In Tambon Mon Nang, Phanat Nikhom District, Chonburi Province, there is a shrine to the Twelve Sisters with the rock they used as pillow when they wandered in the wilderness and a Carissa carandas tree.
"Sa Siliam" (สระสี่เหลี่ยม), also in Chonburi Province, is said to be the pond where Phra Rothasen brought his cock to drink water when he ran cockfights to make a living for the twelve sisters while they were banished in the deep dark cave, according to a legend of the area.
Cambodian version.
In Cambodia this legend is known as "Puthisen Neang Kong Rei". The story goes thus:
Once upon a time, there was a rich man who turned to a poor man because of his twelve daughters. So he abandoned his daughters in a deep forest. There the giant Neang Santema took the 12 foundlings to be the servants of her daughter, Kong Rei.
Eventually tiring of the toil of their lives under the terrifying giants, the 12 fled their bondage and made their way to a neighboring kingdom where they were wed en masse to its king, Preah Bath Rothasith.
But the giant Santema was unwilling to allow the dozen former servants of her daughter to live in even the relative freedom that polygamous relationships of the time allowed. Instead, Santema concealed her identity - not a small matter considering her physical stature and reputation - and charmed Rothasith into making her his 13th wife.
Once she had gained the trust and sympathy of her new husband, Santema feigned a deadly illness, one that all the doctors and medicines of her husband failed to cure.
Santema capitalized on Rothasith's growing desperation and informed him that only a potion concocted from the eyeballs of her 12 pregnant co-wives would save her life. Entranced by Santema's wiles, Roth-asith ordered his soldiers to carve out the eyes of 11 of the 12 women, with wife Neang Pov allowed to keep one of her eyes.
After their ritual mutilation, the now blind or nearly blind women were confined in a cave, where they were forced to consume their newly born children one by one.
Only one-eyed Neang Pov was allowed to let her son, Puthisan, survive. In the darkness of the cave with his blind, grief-crazed aunts, Sen quietly fortified himself with dreams of revenge as he nourished himself with the flesh of his dead cousins.
When he became an adult, the evil Santema began to fear the consequences if Puthisan became King. To circumvent any possible acts of revenge by Sen, Santema sent him a letter instructing him to use it for passage into the Forest of Giants. In fact, the letter was a death warrant that stated "When Pothisan arrives, eat him".
But the letter was cunningly altered by a hermit living in the forest to read : "When Puthisan arrives, marry him to my daughter." 
Thus when Pothisan entered the Forest of Giants, the letter was read and its instructions obeyed by the sentinel giants. Unbeknownst to Santema, her beloved daughter Kong Rei became the adoring wife of her greatest enemy.
After their marriage, Kong Rei had told Puthisan all about the magic thing in her Kingdom including the Eyeballs that belonged to Puthisen's mother and aunts.
Predictably, rather than fulfilling his conjugal duties Puthisen took advantage of his new position to steal back the eyeballs of his long-suffering aunts along with some magical potions designed to facilitate his escape.
When a stricken Kong Rei attempted to pursue Sen, he used the magical potion to turn the land between them into water, allowing him to flee. Kong Rei cried and begged him to come back to live with her but he refused cause he should thought of his mother stronger than wife. Kong rei cried until she died and became the Mountain called Kong Rei Mountain at Kampong Chhnang
When he arrived in his kingdom, he made his mother and aunts have their eyeballs again and killed Santema. Finally, Putisan, his mother and aunts lived happily in the royal palace with Santema's body turned to stone and abandoned in the deep forest.
Phnom Kong Rei is a mountain in Kampong Chhnang Province, Central Cambodia. The silhouette of the mountain seen from afar looks like a sleeping lady. According to local folklore this mountain is related to the story. Kompong Cham province of Cambodia as the temple of the 12 sisters rest in Siemreap, Cambodia. The story was adapted to movie and released in 1968.
Lao version.
The Lao version of the Twelve Sisters, the story of Putthasen (Buddhasen), was translated into French by Louis Finot in 1917.
A merchant fell into poverty and abandoned his twelve daughters in the forest.
Two mountains located close together facing Luang Prabang on the right bank of the Mekong are named Phu Tao Putthasen and Phu Nang Kankari, after Putthasen and Kankari.
Popular culture.
Films and soap operas.
The story has been adapted to Thai films, Thai television soap operas (ละคร) and Khmer films.

Jeffrey Kahane

Jeffrey Alan Kahane (born September 12, 1956, in Los Angeles, California, USA) is an American classical music pianist and conductor. He is music director of the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra.
Personal history.
Kahane grew up in West Los Angeles, and began studying piano at age five, and at age 10 began learning to play the guitar. For the next few years, he split his time between his piano studies and playing folk and rock music on the guitar. At age 14, he was accepted as a scholarship pupil by the Polish-born pianist Jakob Gimpel. "I was completely transformed by the contact with him", Kahane said. "There was something that I got from Brahms and Beethoven and Bach that I couldn't live without. And I wanted to make a contribution to keeping it vital and alive."
After his sophomore year of high school, Kahane entered the San Francisco Conservatory of Music. He studied piano and conducting, and graduated in 1977. While in San Francisco, he played keyboard instruments in the San Francisco Symphony, explored jazz, and played in the pit for a touring Broadway musical.
Kahane and his wife, Martha, a clinical psychologist in private practice and an avid choral singer, currently divide their time between their homes in Denver, Colorado, and Santa Rosa, California. They have two adult children: Gabriel Kahane, a composer, pianist, and singer living in Brooklyn; and Annie, who attends Northwestern University.
Piano performance career.
At the age of 24, Kahane entered the prestigious Van Cliburn International Piano Competition in 1981 and won fourth place. "I was amazed just to get in", Kahane said. "By the end, I was in an altered state. It really changed my life." Kahane received additional exposure because PBS broadcast the competition's finals round. Two years later, he won the Grand Prize in the Arthur Rubinstein International Piano Competition in Israel.
Kahane made his Carnegie Hall debut in 1983 at an Arthur Rubinstein Tribute Concert, and his London debut in 1985. In 1983 he won an Avery Fisher Career Grant, and in 1987 the first Andrew Wolf Chamber Music Award.
He has made numerous solo appearances in recital and with major orchestras around the world, including New York Philharmonic, Cleveland Orchestra, Los Angeles Philharmonic, Philadelphia Orchestra, San Francisco Symphony, Rotterdam Philharmonic, Israel Philharmonic and the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra. In addition, he has become a favored recital accompanist for Yo-Yo Ma, Dawn Upshaw, Joshua Bell, and Thomas Quasthoff, and he often appears with leading chamber ensembles such as the Emerson String Quartet.
In the summer of 2003 Kahane performed all five Beethoven piano concertos with the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra over two consecutive nights at the Hollywood Bowl. He repeated the cycle at Ravinia with the Chicago Symphony in the summer of 2004.
During the 2005–06 concert season, he performed all 23 of the Mozart piano concertos as part of the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra's celebration of the 250th anniversary of the composer's birth.
Conducting career.
Kahane made his conducting debut at the Oregon Bach Festival in 1988, conducting a Mozart concerto from the keyboard. He has often returned to the festival as both pianist and conductor.
In 1991, Kahane co-founded the Gardner Chamber Orchestra at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, an ensemble of outstanding students and recent graduates of the major schools of music in the Boston area. He served as artistic director and conductor from 1991 to 1995.
Santa Rosa Symphony.
In 1995, Kahane became music director of the Santa Rosa Symphony. He held the post until the end of the 2005–06 season, after which he was given the title of Conductor Laureate.
Under Kahane's leadership, the subscriber base increased almost twofold and artistic standards improved. "My tenure with the Santa Rosa Symphony has been the most fulfilling and exciting years of my musical life", Kahane said. "As I move forward, I know that nothing I ever do will mean more to me than the privilege of working with these amazing and dedicated musicians and making music with them for this exceptionally passionate and committed audience."
Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra.
Kahane has been music director of the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra since 1997, succeeding Iona Brown. In 2008, his contract was extended through the 2011–12 season.
According to critic David Mermelstein:
Kahane's taste in new music doesn't appeal to everyone. Some critics find his idea of "modern" too conservative, and LACO's older subscribers have been known to grumble about even "safe" choices. Of course, pleasing everyone all the time isn't music making; it's pandering. On balance, Kahane does a laudable job of giving concert goers a healthy mix of the familiar and the slightly daring. His ability to land major soloists, however, is beyond reproach. Such celebrated performers as Hilary Hahn, Thomas Quasthoff, Lang Lang, Lorraine Hunt Lieberson, and Daniel Hope have appeared with LACO in recent years, and next season promises first appearances by Cho-Liang Lin and Peter Serkin.
But Kahane's achievement at LACO has nothing to do with enriching the musical canon or lassoing big names. It is instead the story of a modest musician who through patience and perhaps a little guile restored dignity to a group of dispirited players. He made them feel their music making mattered, and now others do, too. "We're certainly not the only place in America where musicians are happy", says the conductor, "but the combination of that attitude with this level of playing is very rare."
Colorado Symphony.
Kahane became music director of the Colorado Symphony Orchestra in 2005. His initial contract was for three years. In 2008, Kahane extended his Colorado Symphony contract through 2012. However, in July 2008, Kahane announced his resignation from the orchestra at the end of the 2009–10 season. Kahane said that severe hypertension in 2007, which caused him to cancel several weeks of concerts in both Colorado and Los Angeles, led to his decision to concentrate more on his solo piano career:
I had a real scare. That forced me to really stop and take a look at my life and say, "You know what? You can't do everything." I don't think I underestimated the job. I think I overestimated myself, not in my abilities but just being in a body and turning 50."
According to "The Denver Post", Kahane's tenure "has been marked by increased audiences and an uncommonly strong bond with the orchestra's musicians."
Guest conducting.
Kahane has been a guest conductor with many prominent orchestras, including the Los Angeles Philharmonic, New York Philharmonic, Philadelphia Orchestra, Chicago Symphony, Minnesota Orchestra, San Francisco Symphony, Kansas City Symphony, St. Louis Symphony, Toronto Symphony, Detroit Symphony, Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra, and the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields.
Educational activities.
Jeffrey Kahane founded the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra's Family Concert series, and he is personally involved in the orchestra's Meet the Music program, which serves approximately 2,700 Los Angeles elementary school students annually.
"The thing I myself am most proud of", Kahane said in 2004, "is that in the nine years that I've been music director between the two orchestras Angeles and Santa Rosa, with two exceptions, I have conducted every single children's concert, youth concert, family concert and neighborhood concert that either of those two orchestras has done."

Royal Signals Trades

The Royal Signals Trades are the employment specialisations of the Royal Corps of Signals in the British Army. Every soldier in the Corps is trained both as a field soldier and a tradesman. There are currently seven different trades, each of which is open to both men and women:
Initial Training Common to All Trades.
Every tradesman trains first as a soldier at the Army Foundation College Harrogate or the Army Training Regiment Bassingbourn in Hertfordshire or at ATC (army training centre) in Pirbright, Surrey. At the Army Training Regiment recruits complete a 14-week course which teaches basic military skills such as military drill, how to handle and fire a weapon, how to live and work outdoors and how to tackle an assault course. In addition they develop their stamina and fitness.
On completing his or her initial training every soldier then moves to 11th Signal Regiment at Blandford Camp in Dorset to commence their trade training.
Trade Skills and Training.
Communication Systems Operator.
Communication Systems Operators form the largest trade in the Royal Signals and are trained to operate secure digital radio systems, satellite communications and wide-area computer networks. Their course at the Royal School of Signals lasts 28 weeks and covers the following disciplines:
At the rank of sergeant selected Communication Systems Operator go on to become Yeomen of Signals. 
Communication Systems Engineer.
Communication Systems Engineers are the technical experts of the Royal Signals. They install, maintain and repair the British Army's battlefield communication networks and information systems. Their course at the Royal School of Signals lasts 28 weeks. Their training includes the following elements:
At the rank of corporal Communication Systems Engineers can be highlighted for potential supervisory roles. These roles are Foreman of Signals or Foreman of Signals (Information Systems).
With the merging of the two trade groups, Systems Engineering Technicians and Information Systems Engineers these supervisory roles are still being scrutinized to match the new trade group. At present the Foreman of Signals deals with the technical aspect of Squadron life, working with the squadron technical workshops, dealing with 1st and 2nd line inspections and holding and maintaining the sqn master works register and technical inventory.
The Foreman of Signals (Information Systems) deals with the information systems aspect of life within a squadron, arranging for information systems courses relevant to the Squadron assets, network management and the deployment and tracking of squadron Information system equipments.
Whilst both supervisory trade groups act independently, there is a need for the two to interact and exchange information on a regular basis.
Royal Signals Electrician.
Royal Signals Electricians install, maintain and repair field-distribution power supplies and lighting. They are responsible for the mechanical and electrical repair of the Army's field generator systems. Their course at the Royal School of Signals lasts 25 weeks. It covers the following disciplines:
Driver Lineman.
Linemen drive, maintain and service vehicles from cars to Large Goods Vehicles. Their role includes the movement of hazardous materials, constructing field cable routes and laying fibre-optic cabling.
Their course at the Royal School of Signals lasts 6 weeks. It covers the following disciplines:
The final stage of training for Driver Linemen is 14 weeks at the Defence School of Transport at Leconfield, East Yorkshire, learning how to drive cars and Large Goods Vehicles both with and without trailers.
Installation Technician.
Installation Technicians install, maintain and repair the Army's telephone systems and fibre-optic networks, including cable infrastructures, local area networks, closed circuit television and video conferencing systems. Their course at the Royal School of Signals lasts 40 weeks and covers the following disciplines:
Electronic Warfare Systems Operator.
Electronic Warfare Systems Operators are responsible for intercepting and disrupting enemy radio transmissions. They deploy alongside Intelligence Corps linguists, and some work with bomb disposal teams. They train alongside Communication Systems Operators on a 23 week course at the Royal School of Signals, followed by a five-week aptitude course and a 17-week Communications Exploitation course at the Defence College of Intelligence, Chicksands in Bedfordshire. Their training covers the following disciplines:
Technical Supply Specialist.
Technical Supply Specialists are responsible for the storage and distribution of technical supplies, both on base and when deployed on operations. Managing technical stores is the core responsibility of this trade, but Supply Specialists must have a thorough understanding of the communications equipment used by Royal Signals units. Their course at the Royal School of Signals lasts 13 weeks and covers the following disciplines:
Supervisory trades.
Staff sergeants and warrant officers work in one of five supervisory rosters:
Candidates for YofS and FofS are selected from the Operator and Technician trades for training to first degree and Honours degree respectively. Both are obtained through the Royal School of Signals Blandford whilst being validated by Bournemouth University.
Subsequent employment.
After basic and trade training most Royal Signals tradesmen are posted to the Field Army as Class 3 trained soldiers in the rank of signaller. Communication Systems Engineers and Electronic Warfare Operators, however, leave training as lance corporals. After a year's experience all tradesmen become eligible for upgrading to Class 2 and a pay rise. Throughout their careers tradesmen attend further training courses (including upgrading to Class 1). Promotion is based on experience, ability and merit. Depending on their trade, upon reaching the rank of sergeant, soldiers may apply to join one of the supervisory rosters, which brings extra responsibility and qualifications. Alternatively, soldiers from any trade may choose to follow a career path at Regimental Duty, in which they specialise in delivering military training and, if successful, fill roles such as squadron sergeant major, regimental quartermaster sergeant (RQMS) and regimental sergeant major (RSM).
Soldiers from any trade can volunteer for service with airborne forces or as a Special Forces Communicator, a small number may undertake All Arms Commando Course for service with 3 Commando Brigade.
Signallers of all trades may apply to join the Royal Signals Motorcycle Display Team, better known as the White Helmets.
Commissioning.
Signallers may apply for commissioning, either as a Direct Entry officer undertaking the complete training package at Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, or as a Late Entry officer, undertaking a short commissioning course at Sandhurst. LE Officers are employed as Traffic Officers, Technical Officer (Telecommunications) or General Duties based on experience as a Yeoman of Signals, Foreman of Signals or Regimental Duty.

Virtualization

Virtualization, in computing, refers to the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, including but not limited to a virtual computer hardware platform, operating system (OS), storage device, or computer network resources. 
The term "virtualization" traces its roots to 1960s mainframes, during which it was a method of logically dividing the mainframes' resources for different applications. Since then, the meaning of the term has evolved to the aforementioned.
Hardware virtualization.
"Hardware virtualization" or "platform virtualization" refers to the creation of a virtual machine that acts like a real computer with an operating system. Software executed on these virtual machines is separated from the underlying hardware resources. For example, a computer that is running Microsoft Windows may host a virtual machine that looks like a computer with the Ubuntu Linux operating system; Ubuntu-based software can be run on the virtual machine.
In hardware virtualization, the "host machine" is the actual machine on which the virtualization takes place, and the "guest machine" is the virtual machine. The words "host" and "guest" are used to distinguish the software that runs on the physical machine from the software that runs on the virtual machine. The software or firmware that creates a virtual machine on the host hardware is called a "hypervisor" or "Virtual Machine Manager".
Different types of hardware virtualization include:
Hardware-assisted virtualization is a way of improving the efficiency of hardware virtualization. It involves employing specially designed CPUs and hardware components that help improve the performance of a guest environment.
Hardware virtualization can be viewed as part of an overall trend in enterprise IT that includes autonomic computing, a scenario in which the IT environment will be able to manage itself based on perceived activity, and utility computing, in which computer processing power is seen as a utility that clients can pay for only as needed. The usual goal of virtualization is to centralize administrative tasks while improving scalability and overall hardware-resource utilization. With virtualization, several operating systems can be run in parallel on a single central processing unit (CPU). This parallelism tends to reduce overhead costs and differs from multitasking, which involves running several programs on the same OS. Using virtualization, an enterprise can better manage updates and rapid changes to the operating system and applications without disrupting the user. "Ultimately, virtualization dramatically improves the efficiency and availability of resources and applications in an organization. Instead of relying on the old model of “one server, one application” that leads to under utilized resource, virtual resources are dynamically applied to meet business needs without any excess fat" (ConsonusTech).
Hardware virtualization is not the same as hardware emulation. In hardware emulation, a piece of hardware imitates another, while in hardware virtualization, a hypervisor (a piece of software) imitates a particular piece of computer hardware or the entire computer. Furthermore, a hypervisor is not the same as an emulator; both are computer programs that imitate hardware, but their domain of use in language differs.
Video game console emulation.
A video game console emulator is a program that allows a personal computer or video game console to emulate a different video game console's behavior. Video game console emulators and hypervisors both perform hardware virtualization; the fact that words like "virtualization", "virtual machine", "host" and "guest" is not used in conjunction with console emulators concerns linguistics, rather than computer science.
Snapshotting.
A snapshot is the state of a virtual machine, and, generally, its storage devices, at an exact point in time. Snapshots are "taken" by simply giving an order to do so at a given time, and can be "reverted" to on demand, with the effect that the VM appears (ideally) exactly as it did when the snapshot was taken.
The capability is, for example, useful as an extremely rapid backup technique, prior to a risky operation. It also provides the foundation for other advanced capabilities (discussed below).
Virtual machines frequently use virtual disks for storage. In a very simple case, for example, a 10 gigabyte hard disk is simulated with 10 gigabyte flat file. Any requests by the VM for a location on its physical disk (which does not "exist" as an actual physical object in and of itself) are transparently translated into an operation on the corresponding file (which "does" exist as "part of" an actual storage device).
Once such a translation layer is present, however, it is possible to intercept the operations and send them to "different" files, depending on various criteria. In a snapshotting application, every time a snapshot is taken, a new file is created, and used as an overlay. Whenever the VM does a write, the date is written to the topmost (current) overlay; whenever it does a read, each overlay is checked, working from the most recent back, until the most recent write to the requested location is found. In this manner, the entire stack of snapshots is, subjectively, a single coherent disk.
The RAM memory of the system can be managed in a similar way (though in the simplest systems, snapshots are disk-only, and the VM must be restarted).
Generally, referencing a snapshot means to reference "that" snapshot, and all "prior" snapshots on which it is based, down to the initial state when the VM was created.
To revert to a prior snapshot simply means to restart (or resume, if a memory state, processor state, and peripheral state snapshots are available in addition to disk states) the machine using only the overlays available up to a specific exact point in time (when the snapshot was taken, which resulted in new overlay files, rendering the ones that had been in use an instant before read-only), plus a new set of overlays to hold the current running state of the machine.
Teleportation.
The snapshots described above can be moved to another host machine with its own hypervisor; when the VM is temporarily stopped, snapshotted, moved, and then resumed on the new host, this is known as teleportation (or migration). If the older snapshots are kept in sync regularly, this operation can be quite fast, and allow the VM to provide uninterrupted service while its prior physical host is, for example, taken down for physical maintenance.
Failover.
Similar to teleportation above, failover allows the VM to continue operations if the host fails. However, in this case, the VM continues operation from the "last-known" coherent state, rather than the "current" state, based on whatever materials the backup server was last provided with.
Challenges.
An issue with virtualization is the complexities of licensing. For example, a server running a Linux OS attempting to offer a virtualized Windows Server must still satisfy licensing requirements. Therefore the potential benefits and flexibility of on-demand virtualization must be balanced against the requirements of closed-source, proprietary systems. Some vendors of proprietary software have updated their licensing schemes to address virtualization.
Virtualized desktop results in dependence on centralized servers (for computing and SAN storage) and the network (and higher-bandwidth requirements). This leaves the end users vulnerable to server and network outages or capacity limits.
Desktop virtualization.
Desktop virtualization is the concept of separating the logical desktop from the physical machine. 
One form of desktop virtualization, virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), can be thought as a more advanced form of hardware virtualization. Rather than interacting with a host computer directly via a keyboard, mouse, and monitor, the user interacts with the host computer using another desktop computer or a mobile device by means of a network connection, such as a LAN, Wireless LAN or even the Internet. In addition, the host computer in this scenario becomes a server computer capable of hosting multiple virtual machines at the same time for multiple users.
As organizations continue to virtualize and converge their data center environment, client architectures also continue to evolve in order to take advantage of the predictability, continuity, and quality of service delivered by their Converged Infrastructure. For example, companies like HP and IBM provide a hybrid VDI model with a range of virtualization software and delivery models to improve upon the limitations of distributed client computing. Selected client environments move workloads from PCs and other devices to data center servers, creating well-managed virtual clients, with applications and client operating environments hosted on servers and storage in the data center. For users, this means they can access their desktop from any location, without being tied to a single client device. Since the resources are centralized, users moving between work locations can still access the same client environment with their applications and data. For IT administrators, this means a more centralized, efficient client environment that is easier to maintain and able to more quickly respond to the changing needs of the user and business.
Another form, session virtualization, allows multiple users to connect and log into a shared but powerful computer over the network and use it simultaneously. Each is given a desktop and a personal folder in which they store their files. With Multiseat configuration, session virtualization can be accomplished using a single PC with multiple monitors keyboards and mice connected. 
Thin clients, which are seen in desktop virtualization, are simple and/or cheap computers that are primarily designed to connect to the network. They may lack significant hard disk storage space, RAM or even processing power, but many organizations are beginning to look at the cost benefits of eliminating “thick client” desktops that are packed with software (and require software licensing fees) and making more strategic investments.
Desktop virtualization simplifies software versioning and patch management, where the new image is simply updated on the server, and the desktop gets the updated version when it reboots. It also enables centralized control over what applications the user is allowed to have access to on the workstation.
Moving virtualised desktops into the cloud creates hosted virtual desktops (HVD), where the desktop images are centrally managed and maintained by a specialist hosting firm. Benefits include scalability and the reduction of capital expenditure, which is replaced by a monthly operational cost.
Nested virtualization.
Nested virtualization refers to virtualized virtualization, or simulation of a virtual machine within another. The general concept can be extended to an arbitrary depth. A nested guest virtual machine need not be homogenous with its host virtual machine (e.g., application virtualization within hardware virtualization).

St Mary's Church, Newchurch in Pendle

St Mary's Church, Newchurch in Pendle, is in the village of Newchurch in Pendle, Lancashire, England. The church is designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building. It is active Anglican parish church in the diocese of Blackburn, the archdeaconry of Blackburn and the deanery of Pendle. Its benefice is combined with that of St Thomas', Barrowford.
History.
A chapel of ease was on the site of the present church in 1250. A later chapel was dedicated by John Bird, Bishop of Chester, on 1 October 1544. It is not known when the tower was built, but it was restored in 1653, and again in 1712. The rest of the building dates from around 1740. In 1815 it was decided to raise to walls of the church to accommodate a gallery. This was built between 1816 and 1817 at a cost of £352 (£ as of ). In 1830 the church bell was purchased. Restorations took place in 1850 and 1902.
Architecture.
Exterior.
The church is built in hammer-dressed stone, with ashlar to the porch and a slate roof. Its plan consists of a west tower, a nave with a north aisle, a chancel, and a south porch. At the east end of the aisle is a Lady Chapel and to the east of this is the vicar's vestry. The choir vestry is at the west end of the aisle. The tower is in two stages with a string course between. In the second stage is a clock face with mullioned belfry windows above it. The summit is embattled. On the south and north front of the church are four windows with elliptical heads. At the east end is a Venetian window with a keystone. On the south front is blocked priest's door. On the southwest corner of the nave roof is a sundial dated 1718. On the west face of the tower is a carving which resembles a filled-in window above which is a dripstone. This is said to resemble the all-seeing "Eye of God".
Interior.
In the porch is a memorial containing the names of the men from the parish who lost their lives in the World Wars together with the names of those who served in the armed forces in these wars. Inside the church, to the left of the entrance, are the churchwardens' seats and a board containing the names of the districts into which the parish was divided. Inside the church is a north arcade of Doric columns and wooden panelled north and west galleries. The chandelier dates from 1756.
Organ.
The organ in the west gallery was made by Wordsworth and Company of Leeds, and was installed in 1890 at a cost of £550. It was refurbished in 1990 and then completely rebuilt in 2000 by Harrison & Harrison of Durham at a cost of over £75,000.
External features.
In the churchyard are two Grade II listed features. The Parker tomb is a table tomb dated 1691. The Nutter headstone probably dates from 1694. It is possible that the members of the family inscribed on this headstone were relatives of Alice Nutter, one of the women accused in the Pendle witch trials. Also in the churchyard are the war graves of two soldiers and a Royal Flying Corps officer of World War I.
Present activities.
St Mary's continues to be an active parish church, holding regular services. In addition, it is one of the few remaining churches to hold an annual rushbearing service in August.

Pyrton

Pyrton is a village and civil parish in Oxfordshire about north of the small town of Watlington and south of Thame.
The toponym is from Old English meaning "pear-tree farm".
Archaeology.
In 1957 a late Iron Age cremation burial from the first half of the 1st century AD was discovered on Pyrton Heath. The burial pit contained two Belgic butt beakers, a bowl and a dish. The smaller of the beakers contained cremated human remains and fragments of a bronze brooch. The finder donated all the items to the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.
Strip parish.
The ancient Icknield Way passes through the parish, where it is crossed by the Mediaeval Knightsbridge Lane that runs the length of the parish.
Pyrton is a strip parish. The ancient parish comprised two detached portions extending about between Standhill Farm near Little Haseley and Stonor in the Chiltern Hills. The Stonor portion became a separate parish in 1896, and in 1922 joined Pishill to form the parish of Pishill with Stonor. The remaining Pyrton portion extends about between Standhill Farm and a point just north of Christmas Common. Standhill had been a hamlet with a manor house, but in the 14th century it was depopulated in the Black Death.
Manor.
Pyrton was a royal estate in 774, when King Offa of Mercia gave land there to Worcester Cathedral. The Domesday Book records that after the Norman conquest of England Pyrton manor passed to Hugh d'Avranches, 1st Earl of Chester, whose heirs retained it until John de Scotia, 7th Earl of Chester died in 1237. It was then annexed by the Crown, and in 1360 was recorded as part of the Honour of Wallingford. In 1480 King Edward IV gave the manor to the Dean and Chapter of St George's Chapel, Windsor, who remained lords of the manor until about 1870.
The statesman Richard Hampden leased the manor from 1669 until his death in 1695, after which it remained with his widow until 1707. The Earl of Macclesfield leased the manor from 1751. A Hugh Hamersley of Old Windsor leased the manor from 1781. The lease remained with his descendants until 1870 when his grandson, another Hugh Hamersley, seems to have bought the manor from the Dean and Chapter of St. George's Chapel. In 1909 Hugh's younger son Edward Samuel Hamersley died without heir and his widow gave Pyrton to her nephew, Major Hugh C.C. Ducat, who changed his surname to Ducat Hamersley. In 1945 the Major left the estate to his son, Colonel Hugh Ducat Hamersley, who still held the estate in the 1960s.
The estate was not inherited by Hugh's elder son, Alfred St. George Hamersley, because he lived in New Zealand. Alfred St. George Hamersley was a nineteenth-century barrister, English MP and English rugby union international who played in the first ever international match, went on to captain his country and pioneered the sport in the south of New Zealand and in British Columbia.
Parish church.
Pyrton has had a parish church since the 10th century. The present Church of England parish church of Saint Mary was built in the 12th century but was largely rebuilt in 1856 to designs by the architect J.C. Buckler.
Houses.
Pyrton had a Mediaeval manor house surrounded by a moat. There was a Hundred of Pyrton, making the manor house the administrative centre of this division of Oxfordshire. The present Elizabethan manor house was built around the beginning of the 17th century. It is largely of red brick and has a roughly E-shaped plan typical of its period. In 1786 it was in poor condition and received major repairs. Most of the present sash windows seem to have been added at this time. Also in the 18th century the grounds were landscaped, replacing a dovecote and small pond with a larger lake.
Pyrton Vicarage is a lath and plaster house that was built before 1637. The present brick-built south front was added late in the 18th century. By 1635 Pyrton had also a substantial rectory, but by 1777 it was a ruin and towards the end of the 18th century it was demolished and replaced by the present Georgian rectory was built in its place. From about 1885 this Rectory was used to house successive vicars of the adjacent Shirburn parish. In 1943 the two benefices were merged, bringing this unusual housing arrangement to an end.
Railway.
The Watlington and Princes Risborough Railway was built in 1869–72. Its Watlington terminus is in fact in Pyrton parish, from Watlington. The Great Western Railway took over the line in 1833. British Railways closed Watlington station and withdrew all train services between Watlington and in 1957.

Shadow Host

Formation of Band.
Shadow Host is a Power metal, Thrash metal band from Russia that was formed in 1993 by guitarist Alexey Arzamazov. Moscow band Shadow Host was founded by guitarist Alexey Arzamazov in autumn 1993. At first the music played by The Band was pretty common power/thrash-metal. The Band line-up gets stable only by August 1994 when Sergey Kayumov appears as a singer. He also plays rhythm guitar at first, switching to bass in autumn 1995. In December 1994 the very first demo “Nothing Left Behind” containing 8 tracks was recorded. Shortly Shadow Host appears live on stage for the first time – on 28th of January 1995. By this time The Band’s style is completely configured as melodic power-metal. In January 1996 The Band goes to the studio TEF to record “Beyond the Line” - the song is planned to appear on “Melodic Metal in Russia” compilation. Unfortunately, the compilation has never been released. At the time Shadow Host line-up was the following:Sergey Kayumov - vocals, bass, Alexey Arzamazov - guitar, Oleg Sonin - guitar, Roman Proshenko - drums.
In the summer of the same year radical reorganization happens - only Sergey and Alexey remain from the former line-up. Alexey from the band Nifelheim is taken as the second guitarist and Sergey Kutaev from Snakes becomes the drummer. The Band starts to play in many Moscow clubs. Simultaneously the work on the material for the upcoming album goes on. In May 1997 Shadow Host went to the studio to record their debut album. A little before thas the second guitarist left and Alexey Martynov from Warcloud was taken to replace him. He joined The Band in studio. So the line-up became: Sergey Kayumov - vocals and bass, Alexey Arzamazov - guitar, Alexey Martynov - guitar, Sergey Kutaev - drums.
The debut album named “Twilight Legend” included 9 tracks written from 1993 to 1996. In November 1997 a contract with Hobgoblin Records was signed. The album presentation takes place on February 22nd in Camelot club. In spite of the low quality of the record and mixing mistakes the album achieves appreciation in music press and positive reaction of the audience as well. Owing to this The Band becomes one of the most popular Russian bands in the appropriate style. The series of the shows followed the release, and not only in Moscow but also in Saint-Petersburg, Tula and Moscow Region towns. The Band takes part in most of the large concerts in Moscow, including Apocalypses and Death Rider fests. From spring 1999 until the summer next year 5th band member Ludmila Gerasko plays keyboards on live shows. In July Shadow Host are in the studio again to record a mini-CD “Downfall” containing 6 songs. The new material seems to be more diverse with folk and progressive influences. The presentation of the CD takes place in Art-2000 club on December 12th. There The Band plays 1.5 hrs set with the material from both releases, the demo and cover versions. 
In spring 2000 the decision was made to re-release the debut album “Twilight Legend” with Valiant Music Productions adding “Beyond the Line” video as a multimedia bonus track. But after the remastering it got clear that the quality of the recorded material is not good enough to be released on a CD. That’s why it was decided to record the whole album again with the new arrangements and adding a few new songs. Unfortunately the beginning of autumn brought dissentions between band members and as the result on October 20th Sergey Kayumov announced that he leaves The Band... The replacement was found in two musicians: Sergey Sergeev (Gulf Stream) as a singer and Sergey Lobanov (ex-Amon, T.H.R.O.N.) on bass. They've got ready with the set shortly and on October 29th Shadow Host already plays at Musica.Mustdie.Fest introducing the brand new line-up. From now on Shadow Host can be considered to be a quintet: Sergey Sergeev - vocals, Alexey Arzamazov - guitar, Alexey Martynov - guitar, Sergey Lobanov - bass, Sergey Kutaev - drums.
During the next few months preparations for the recording were proceeding. The title "Twilight Legend" was changed to "Neverland" since a lot of remakes were made; one more new track "Dragonfire's Burning" - composed by the new line up, one song from "Downfall" and Helloween cover "Twilight Of The Gods" as a bonus track were added. At the end of February 2001 Shadow Host started working in the studio. By the beginning of April nearly everything was recorded, but at that very moment they had to interrupt for 2 months. At the end of June The Band goes back to studio to finish their works. 
However, musicians made a conclusion that the quality of the earlier recorded stuff is far below the desired level. Seeing no sense in releasing what was already recorded as it was Shadow Host make a hard decision to start recording again - this time in their own studio. 
More than half a year passed while Alexey Martynov assembled essential equipment and prepared studio for the recording. Thus the recording sessions weren't started until spring 2002. During the recording it revealed that Shadow Host bass player Sergey Lobanov ceased to suit the rest of The Band as a musician so he was discharged. Bass parts for the 6 remaining tracks were recorded by Alexey Arzamazov and Alexey Martynov. Mixing was finished by May 23rd after that the record was sent out for mastering. At the same moment search for a new bass player started. A quantity of candidatures was considered and vacancy was taken by Alexey Zavolokin (ex-Chronica, Galgen). Sergey Sergeev - vocals, Alexey Arzamazov - guitar, Alexey Martynov - guitar, Alexey Zavolokin - bass, Sergey Kutaev - drums.
The new album "Neverland" was released on September 12th 2002. Afterwards The Band played a number of concerts to support the new release, including opening for Blind Guardian in Luzhniki on October 27th and in MDM with Grave Digger 8th of February 2003. At the end of February 2003 line-up was renewed - as Alexey Martynov left Shadow Host deciding to concentrate on sound engineer career, the young guitar maniac Andrey Smirnov (who is the frontman and mastermind of melodic-death metal formation Everlost as well) joined The Band. He opened the new horizons for The Band creative work - henceforth guitar parts became by far more compound and intricate. Sergey Sergeev - vocals, Alexey Arzamazov - guitar, Andrey Smirnov - guitar, Alexey Zavolokin - bass, Sergey Kutaev - drums.
"Nothing Left Behind".
The band was now writing and rehearsing songs for their first demo. A change was made to the band's line-up in order to record this demo, which would be titled "Nothing Left Behind." Zelensky, the band's drummer, was replaced by Roman Proschenko, who is commonly recognized as the band's first official drummer. In December, the demo was recorded. It included 8 tracks including "The Last Hope" which would be re-released later on their debut album, "Twilight Legend."

Capriccio (Janáček)

The Capriccio for Piano Left-Hand and Chamber Ensemble (sometimes titled Defiance, in Czech: "Vzdor") is a composition by the Czech composer Leoš Janáček. The work was written in the autumn of 1926 and is remarkable not just in the context of Janáček's output, but it also occupies an exceptional position in the literature written for piano played only by the left hand. The piece is scored for piano, flute, two trumpets, three trombones and tenor tuba.
Background.
The work was apparently inspired by the request of the pianist Otakar Hollmann, who had lost the use of his right hand during World War I. During their first meeting Janáček refused to write such a work, declaring: "But, my dear boy, why do you want to play with one hand? It's hard to dance when you have only one leg." Janáček later changed his decision and began composing a piano piece for left hand, but didn't notify Hollman about the composition. Hollman contacted Janáček again after finding out about the existence of the work in the press. Janáček did not dedicate the work to him and did not give him the right to premiere the work, stating: "I cannot give any kind of rights to the first performance. Whoever manages to do it can play it." However, in May 1927 he sent the score to the pianist, and in the summer of the same year Hollmann started to study the new composition. The first private hearing of the work took place on February 6, 1928 at Janáček's apartment in Brno, to the composer's satisfaction. The preparations for the premiere of the Capriccio were led by the conductor Jaroslav Řídký. Janáček observed with humour that the trombonists of the renowned Czech Philharmonic were forced to practise their parts at home.
The premiere took place on March 2, 1928 in the Smetana Hall of the Municipal Cultural Center in Prague, with conductor Jaroslav Řídký and five Czech Philharmonic members: Václav Máček (flute), Evžen Šerý and František Trnka (trumpets), Antonín Bok, Jaroslav Šimsa and Gustav Tyl (trombones) and with Antonín Koula (tenor tuba). 
Janáček often called the piece ""Vzdor"" (Defiance) in his letters to Kamila Stösslová.
The first edition of the Capriccio was prepared by Jarmil Burghauser in 1953. Nowadays it is played regularly at concerts and on recordings.
Structure.
The composition consists of four movements:
The work shows typical traits of Janáček's mature creative period. All parts are composed in a fairly free form, with the first and last movement having outlines of the sonata form. The elements of structure are divided among all of the instruments and, unlike other works (as in the case of his Concertino) the piano does not always have a leading role. The composer made all the instruments parts equally important.
In the work very unusual demands are placed on the individual instruments, with the brass parts in particular containing difficult passages.

William Streatfeild

William Champion Streatfeild (1 September 1865 – 15 February 1929) was the Anglican Bishop of Lewes for a brief period in the second quarter of the 20th century. He was also the father of the novelist Noel Streatfeild, and appears as the beloved but over-saintly father of the heroine, Victoria, in her autobiographical novel "A Vicarage Family".
William was the eldest son of the Rev. William Champion Streatfeild (1839–1912) and Selina Frances Diana Leveson-Gower (1840–1916), and was educated at Marlborough and Pembroke College, Cambridge before being ordained in 1890. His ministry began with a curacy at Sittingbourne under his father-in-law, Henry Venn, after which he was Curate to his own father in Frant, Sussex. He then began a long period as Incumbent at several Sussex parishes before his elevation to the Episcopate. He was only bishop for two months from December 1928. A small brass memorial to him lies in the north aisle of Chichester Cathedral.
Family.
William's father, Rev. William Champion Streatfeild, was the sometime Vicar of Howick, Ryton-on-Tyne, Kings Worthy and Frant.
William married Janet Venn (1873–1952), daughter of Henry Venn, under whom William was curate in Sittingbourne, on 7 September 1893. Janet was from a strong evangelical family. Her great grandfather John Venn was one of the founders and her grandfather (Henry Venn) honorary secretary of the Church Missionary Society (CMS). Her uncle, John Venn was the mathematician famous for Venn diagrams.
Two of William's brothers, Rev Claude Streatfeild (1870–1951) and Rev Roland Harry Streatfeild (1871–1952) were also Church of England Clergymen. Roland was curate to William in Eastbourne.
One of William's daughters was the children's novelist Noel Streatfeild (1895–1986)
William died on 15 February 1929 while travelling on the 9.29 train from Lewes to Eastbourne for a dental appointment, three days after his Diocesan Bishop Winfrid Oldfield Burrows.

Solomon Islands national cricket team

The Solomon Islands national cricket team is the team that represents the country of the Solomon Islands in international cricket matches. Cricket is a minor sport in the country, and the national team hasn't played since 1999. The game now appears to be in decline.
History.
Cricket was introduced to the Solomon Islands by missionaries in the 1870s. Initially the game was played enthusiastically throughout the islands, but by the 1960s, interest outside the capital Honiara waned.
The national side first played in 1977, when they played Fiji in the capital city. The match was drawn. By the 1980s, the game outside the capital city was non-existent, though an attempt at a revival was made in the early 1990s. This revival led to the national side being sent to the cricket tournament at the 1991 South Pacific Games in Papua New Guinea.
Interest again declined after this though and equipment was in short supply. A match by the national team was played against an Australian club side in 1999, and they won by six wickets. They have not played since. A cricket association was formed in 2000 with the aim of setting up a national league and seeking membership of the International Cricket Council. However the civil war caused many of the expatriate community to leave the country, and the game again went into decline.

Daybreak (2008 film)

Daybreak (Filipino: Bukang-liwayway, English: dawn, twilight) is a 2008 Philippine gay indie film written by Charliebebs Gohetia and directed by the Manila-based Filipino director Adolfo Borinaga Alix, Jr. who also directed other indie films such as Donsol, Kadin and Batanes. The movie features only two characters, Paolo Rivero (as William) and Coco Martin (as JP) who are both Filipino actors. The film is homosexual in terms of theme but was rated R-18 uncut, regardless of its nudity features by the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB) in the Philippines as most of the members of the board were impressed by the cinematography and intelligence of the film. Daybreak had its exclusive screenings on February 13 and 14, 2008 at the University of the Philippines Cine Adarna (formerly UP Film Institute). The movie was officially released and aired in major Philippine cinemas from February 20 to March 11, 2008. "Daybreak" is produced by "Bicycle Productions".
Introduction.
The whole movie occurs entirely in one place; a big white vacation house in Tagaytay, Cavite and only with two male characters. In a single narrative time, intending by way of voyeurism, the film allows viewers to discover what happens when two men spend one night contemplating whether to break up or continue their relationship.
According to the Philippine Entertainment Portal, Daybreak is not a typical gay-love story because of the complicated situation conveyed by the movie and the extremely difficult roles played by Coco Martin and Paolo Rivero. The movie also gives extraordinary wit and intelligent meaning to homosexuality and failed relationships supported by a beautiful screenplay by Gohetia and script by Alix and Ferrer.
Synopsis.
A married man is having an affair with another man. After some time apart, the two men spend a night together in a family vacation home in Tagaytay, Cavite. Together in such close quarters, the two are left with nothing to do but to confront the realities of their relationship.
The movie opens with William (Paolo Rivero), a doctor, driving up to Tagaytay City to meet his secret lover JP (Coco Martin), a handsome young fellow in his mid-twenties. While driving, William had been engaged in a cell phone conversation with his wife, who was asking when he will return home. William made up an alibi saying that he has an unexpected appointment in Tagaytay and will probably be back in Manila the next day.
On the other hand, JP was waiting in a public viewing park of the Taal Volcano to join William in his Tagaytay escapade. JP is a local boatman and tour guide in Taal, Batangas and William’s secret lover for a year now. Although it was not specifically reiterated in the movie, listening to their dialogue, one will learn that the two men obviously met during one of William and his wife’s visits to Taal Volcano. If William has a wife, JP has a girlfriend.
The two did not see each other for two months partly because William is very busy being a Makati physician and partly because he is a family man. JP, on the other hand, had spent two months secretly waiting for William while keeping himself busy with his boating job and his girlfriend. Deep inside, the two lovers missed each other.
When they reach the rest house, William cooks pasta and they eat and drink wine together. It is to be, however, the last night that the two lovers will be together as William is scheduled to leave for Australia. William wants to call it quits but doesn't know how to break the news to JP, who is already emotionally attached to him although they really didn't have an agreement that they are indeed a couple.
The tension starts when William tells JP that he's leaving the country. Several scenes and dialogue lead up to the climax as JP is reluctant to accept the fact that it was the end of their relationship. The two men had spent the night talking about their past including happy and unforgettable memories while browsing their pictures.
The night has been a beautiful night. Their intimacy is renewed and they make love as pleasurable as ever. But as the daybreak comes, William remains firm to his decision, leaving for Australia and ending his relationship with JP.
The movie ends as William is driving back to Manila again and JP, alone in the nocturnal Tagaytay rest house, is numbed to the truth that their relationship is doomed in just one night.

Raja Ganesha

Raja Ganesha () (reigned 1415) was a Hindu ruler of Bengal, who overthrew the Ilyas dynasty rule from Bengal. The Indo-Persian historians of the medieval period considered him as an infidel (Kafir) usurper. The dynasty founded by him ruled over Bengal from 1415−1435. His name mentioned in the coins of his son, sultan Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah as "Kans Rao" or "Kans Shah". The Indo-Persian historians mentioned his name as Raja "Kans" or "Kansi". A number of modern scholars identified him with Danujamardanadeva, but this idenitification is not universally accepted.
Early life.
According to the "Riaz-us-Salatin" (a chronicle written in 1788), Raja Ganesha was a landlord of Bhaturia and according to Francis Buchanan Hamilton he was the "Hakim" (Governor) of Dinajpur in the northern Bengal. In a contemporary letter, he was described as a member of a landholder family of 400 years' standing. Later, he became an officer of the Ilyas Shahi dynasty rulers in Pandua. According to a very late authority, the "Riaz-us-Salatin", he killed Sultan Ghiyasuddin Azam Shah (reigned 1390–1410), but the earlier authorities like Firishta and Nizam-ud-Din Ahmad do not refer to any such event and probably he died a natural death. Ghiyas-ud-Din Azam Shah was succeeded by his son Saifuddin Hamza Shah (reigned 1410–12) and the latter by Shihabuddin Bayazid Shah (reigned 1413–14). Firishta says that he became very powerful during the rule of Shihabuddin Bayazid Shah. While the earlier authorities like Firishta and Nizam-ud-Din say that Ganesha ascended to the throne after the death of Shihabuddin but again the "Riaz-us-Salatin" says that he killed Shihabuddin and seized the throne. Shihabuddin was succeeded by his son Ala-ud-din Firuz Shah (reigned 1414–15) but he was soon deposed by Raja Ganesha.
Reign.
According to Firishta, the reign of Raja Ganesha was marked by his conciliatory policies toward the Muslims in Pandua. He mentioned that, "although Raja Ganesha was not a Muslim, he mixed freely with them and had so much love for them that some Muslims, witnessing to his faith in Islam, wanted to bury him in the Islamic manner." But according to the "Riaz", soon after he took over the power in Pandua, he oppressed the Muslims of Bengal and slew a number of them. Thereupon, a Muslim Chishti saint Shaikh Nur Qutb-ul-Alam wrote a letter to the Jaunpur Sultan, Ibrahim Shah Sharqi, with an appeal to invade Bengal. Purport of this letter is found in a letter written by Hazrat Ashraf Jahangir Sinnani, a saint of Jaunpur. According to a tradition, recorded by Mulla Taqyya, a courtier of Akbar and Jahangir, Ibrahim Shah, while proceeding to chastise Raja Ganesha, was opposed by Sivasimha, the ruler of Mithila. Mulla Taqyya gives the date of this event as 805 AH (1402-3), which is obviously wrong but there may be some truth in his statement about the alliance of Sivasimha with Raja Ganesha. 
According to the narrative given in the "Riaz", when Ibrahim Shah reached Bengal with his army, Ganesha asked saint Shaikh Nur Qutb-ul-Alam for his forgiveness and protection. The saint agreed and Jadu, the twelve-year-old son of Ganesha, was converted to Islam by him and renamed "Jalaluddin". He was placed on the throne under the title Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah. Sultan Ibrahim returned to Jaunpur. Ganesha ascended the throne immediately after the return of Ibrahim Shah for the second time. But this time, he was killed by some servants of his son, who re-occupied the throne after his death.
The earlier accounts of the invasion of Ibrahim Shah Sharqi are different from the account given in the "Riaz". A Chinese source mentioned that a kingdom to the west of Bengal had indeed invaded, but desisted when placated with gold and money. Abd-ur Razzaq Samarqandi, in his "Maṭla'-us-Sadain wa Majma'-ul-Bahrain" mentioned that in 1442, a diplomat in the service of Shah Rukh, the Timurid ruler of Herat (reigned 1405–47), wrote that his master had intervened in the Bengal-Jaunpur crisis at the request of the sultan of Bengal, "directing the ruler of Jaunpur to abstain from attacking the King of Bengal, or to take the consequences upon himself. To which intimidation the ruler of Jaunpur was obedient, and resisted from his attacks upon Bengal". A contemporary Arakanese tradition recorded that the army of Raja Ganesha, then firmly in control of Pandua, had defeated Ibrahim in battle. According to this tradition, one of the rulers of Arakan, who had been given refuge in Pandua after having been defeated by a Burman monarch in 1406, gave Raja Ganesha the military advice that enabled his army to defeat Ibrahim .
Identification with Danujamardanadeva.
In 1922, a modern scholar, Nalini Kanta Bhattasali assumed in his "Coins and Chronology of the Early Independent Sultans of Bengal", that, Danujamardanadeva, who issued silver coins in Saka era 1339-40 (1416–18) from Suvarnagrama, Pandunagara and Chatigrama with the Sanskrit legend, "Shri Chandi Charana Parayana" (devoted to the feet of Goddess Chandi) in Bengali script on the reverse, is actually a title of Raja Ganesha. He also assumed that Mahendradeva was the title assumed by the son of Raja Ganesha after his reconversion to Hinduism and before his second conversion to Islam. But his view is not accepted by all. A number of scholars, which include Jadunath Sarkar, who favour the identification of Raja Ganesha with Danujamardanadeva believe that after the death of Raja Ganesha, the Hindu party in the court raised his second son to the throne under the title Mahendradeva, who was soon ousted by his elder brother Jalal-ud-Din. But Ahmad Hasan Dani regarded Danujamardanadeva and Mahendradeva as the local chiefs in East and South Bengal who asserted independence during troubles caused by the capture of power by Raja Ganesha and the invasions of Ibrahim Shah Sharqi. He, on the basis of the testimony of later oral and literary sources, identified Danujamardanadeva and Mahendradeva as the descendants of the Deva dynasty kings of "Chandradvipa" (the present-day Barisal district). Another modern scholar, Richard Eaton supported his view and identified the mint town Pandunagara with Chhota Pandua in the present-day Hooghly district. However, Vaishnava tradition of Bengal too hold Raja Ganesh as taking the title upon accession to throne.
Dinajpur Raj.
According to a tradition, Dinajpur derived its name from Raja Dinaj or Dinaraj who founded the "Dinajpur Raj" (the estate of Dinajpur). But according to another tradition, Raja Ganesha was the real founder of this estate. In the late 17th century Srimanta Dutta Chaudhury became the zamindar of Dinajpur. After him, his sister's son Sukhdev Ghosh inherited his property as Srimanta's son had a premature death. Sukhdev's son Prannath Ray began construction of the Kantanagar Nava-Ratna Temple, presently known as the Kantajew Temple. The main blocks and the enclosing moats of the "Rajbari" (palace) were most probably constructed by Prannath and his adopted son Ramnath in the 18th century. The two-storied main palace was seriously damaged by an earthquake in 1897 and rebuilt later by Girijanath Ray.

Musée des Plans-Reliefs

The Musée des Plans-Reliefs is a museum of military models located within the Hôtel des Invalides in the 7th arrondissement of Paris, France. It is open daily except the first Monday of each month; an admission fee is charged.
The construction of models dates to 1668 when François-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois and minister of war to Louis XIV, began a collection of three-dimensional models of fortified cities for military purposes, known as 'plans-relief'. The models gave particular attention to the city fortifications and topographic features such as hills, harbors, etc. In 1700 Louis XIV installed the collection in the Louvre. Initially the models were constructed in the field, by military engineers, but in 1743 two central workshops were established for their construction in Béthune and Lille. A large number of models were built during and after the War of the Austrian Succession (1741-1748) to represent newly captured sites. The collection was updated in 1754, but then fell into some disuse; the final models built under the Ancien Régime were those of Saint-Omer (1758) and the fort Saint-Philippe aux Baléares (1759).
In 1774 the collection was nearly destroyed when its Louvre gallery was rededicated to paintings, but was in 1777 moved to the Hôtel des Invalides where it remains to this day. Under Napoleon, a new set of models was built, including Luxembourg (1802), La Spezia (1811), Brest (1811), and Cherbourg (1811-1813). Their production then continued until about 1870, when it drew to a close with the disappearance of "fortifications bastionnées". The collection was declared a historical monument in 1927, and the museum established in 1943.
All told, some 260 plans-reliefs were created between 1668 and 1870, representing about 150 fortified sites. About 100 models are conserved today by this museum, of which about 15 are kept in the Musée des Beaux-Arts de Lille. At present, the museum displays 28 plans-reliefs of fortifications along the English Channel, the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts, and the Pyrenees. It also contains presentations on construction and use of the plans-reliefs.

Hong–Ou–Mandel effect

The Hong–Ou–Mandel effect is a two-photon interference effect in quantum optics which was demonstrated by three physicists, C. K. Hong, Z. Y. Ou and Leonard Mandel in 1987 from the University of Rochester. The effect occurs when two identical single-photon waves enter a 50:50 beam splitter, one in each input port. When both photons are identical they will extinguish each other. If there are changes in phase the propability of detection will increase. In this way the interferometer can measure accurately bandwidth, path lengths and timing.
Quantum-mechanical description.
Physical description.
When a photon enters a beam splitter, there are two possibilities: it will either be reflected or transmitted. The relative probabilities of transmission and reflection are determined by the reflectivity of the beam splitter. Here, we assume a 50:50 beam splitter, in which a photon has equal probability of being reflected and transmitted.
Next, consider two photons, one in each input mode of a 50:50 beam splitter (see figure 1). There are four possibilities for the photons to behave: 1) The photon coming in from above is reflected and the photon coming in from below is transmitted; 2) Both photons are transmitted; 3) Both photons are reflected; 4) The photon coming in from above is transmitted and the photon coming in from below is reflected. We assume now that the two photons are identical in their physical properties (i.e., polarization, spatio-temporal mode structure, and frequency).
Since the state of the beam splitter does not "record" which of the four possibilities actually happens, Feynman's rule dictates that we have to add all four possibilities at the amplitude level. In addition, reflection off the bottom side of the beam splitter introduces a relative phase shift of −1 in the associated term in the superposition. This is required by the reversibility (or unitarity) of the quantum evolution of the beam splitter. Since the two photons are identical, we cannot distinguish between the output states of possibilities 2 and 3 in figure 1, and their relative minus sign ensures that these two terms cancel. This can be interpreted as destructive interference.
Mathematical description.
Consider two optical modes "a" and "b" that carry annihilation and creation operators formula_1, formula_2, and formula_3, formula_4. Two identical photons in different modes can be described by the Fock states
where formula_6 is a single-photon state. When the two modes "a" and "b" are mixed in a 50:50 beam splitter, they turn into new modes "c" and "d", and the creation and annihilation operators transform accordingly:
The relative minus sign appears because the beam splitter is a unitary transformation. This can be seen most clearly when we write the two-mode beam splitter transformation in matrix form:
Unitarity of the transformation now means unitarity of the matrix. Physically, this beam splitter transformation means that reflection off one surface induces a relative phase shift of −1 with respect to reflection off the other side of the beam splitter (see the Physical Description above). Similar transformations hold for the annihilation operators.
When two photons enter the beam splitter, one on each side, the state of the two modes becomes
Since the commutator of the two creation operators formula_10 and formula_11 vanishes, the surviving terms in the superposition are formula_12 and formula_13. Therefore, when two identical photons enter a 50:50 beam splitter, they will always exit the beam splitter in the same (but random) output mode.
Experimental signature.
When two photodetectors monitor the output modes of the beam splitter, the coincidence rate of the detectors will drop to zero when the identical input photons overlap perfectly in time. This is called the "Hong–Ou–Mandel dip", or HOM dip, shown in figure 2. The coincidence count reaches a minimum, indicated by the dotted line in figure 2. The minimum drops to zero when the two photons are perfectly identical in all properties. When the two photons are perfectly distinguishable, the dip completely disappears. The precise shape of the dip is directly related to power spectrum of the single-photon wave packet, and is therefore determined by the physical process of the source. Common shapes of the HOM dip are Gaussian and Lorentzian.
A classical analog to the HOM effect occurs when two coherent states (e.g. laser beams) interfere at the beamsplitter. If the states have a rapidly varying phase difference (i.e. faster than the integration time of the detectors) then a dip will be observed in the coincidence rate equal to one half the average coincidence count at long delays (Nevertheless it can be further reduced with a proper discriminating trigger level applied to the signal.). Consequently, to prove that destructive interference is two-photon quantum interference, the HOM dip must be lower than one half.
Applications and experiments.
The Hong–Ou–Mandel effect can be used to test the degree of indistinguishability of the two incoming photons. When the HOM dip in figure 2 reaches all the way down to zero coincidence counts, the incoming photons are perfectly indistinguishable, whereas if there is no dip the photons are distinguishable. In 2002, the Hong–Ou–Mandel effect was used to demonstrate the purity of a solid-state single-photon source by feeding two successive photons from the source into a 50:50 beam splitter. The interference visibility "V" of the dip is related to the states of the two photons formula_14 and formula_15 by:
If formula_17 then the visibility is equal to the purity formula_18 of the photons. In 2006, an experiment was performed in which two atoms independently emitted a single photon. These photons subsequently produced the Hong–Ou–Mandel effect.
The Hong–Ou–Mandel effect also underlies the basic entangling mechanism in linear optical quantum computing, and the two-photon quantum state formula_19 that leads to the HOM dip is the simplest non-trivial state in a class called NOON states.

Anna Dymna

Anna Dymna (née Dziadyk ) (born July 20, 1951 in Legnica, Poland) is a Polish TV, film and theatre actress. Foundress of a charity foundation Mimo Wszystko (Against the Odds).
Biography.
Artistic career.
Anna Dymna intended to study psychology before she decided to sit an entrance examination for the Ludwik Solski Academy for the Dramatic Arts in Cracow. While still at studies, Dymna already performed at the Juliusz Słowacki Theatre in Cracow. In 1969 she played the role of Isia and Chochoł in the performances of Stanisław Wyspiański's "Wesele". Dymna made her film debut also when she was still a student. She admittedly played a role in Henryk Kluba's "Pięć i pół bladego Józka" (1971) but, because that film was actually never shown on screens, her first official film role is considered to be the role of Gabrysia in the same year's "Szerokiej drogi, kochanie" directed by Andrzej J. Piotrowski. Dymna became popular with television viewers owing to her role of Klarysa in a TV series "Janosik" (1973). The later role of Ania Pawlak in Polish cult comedy films "Nie ma mocnych" and "Kochaj, albo rzuć" turned out to be even more successful. She also appeared in a number of Jerzy Hoffman's melodrama films.
Dymna was employed by the National Helena Modrzejewska Old Theatre in Cracow immediately after her graduation in 1973 and has performed on its stage since then. Her major roles included characters of beautiful women, e.g. Kora in "Noc listopadowa" ("November night"); Anna in "Warszawianka" ("The Varsovian lady"); and Ania in "The Cherry Orchard" by Anton Chekhov. Later she also performed in Thomas Mann's "The Magic Mountain"; Joyce's "Exiles"; and "The Master and Margarita" by Mikhail Bulgakov.
Dymna has played about 250 theatrical and film roles. She has been esteemed for her talent and looks which "emanated with freshness, naturalness, girlishness and charm". Her photographs decorated covers of magazines, but her beauty became, in a way, an obstacle for portrayals of more mature characters. Such a possibility emerged in the second half of 1980s when she experienced physical change related with motherhood.
In 2002 Dymna initiated the Cracow Poetry Salon, which has become a weekly reading of poetry by most distinguished actors and poets. The Salon takes place each Sunday at Juliusz Słowacki Theatre but it already has its separate branches in some other cities of Poland, e.g. in Częstochowa, Gdańsk, Opole and Tarnów. The Cracow Poetry Salon was granted the Nike Award in 2003 for "the most interesting cultural activity in the region".
Charity work.
Dymna has been involved in charity for many years. In 1999 she started co-operation with the St. Brother Albert Foundation which organizes charity performances with therapists and their disabled charges. Two years later she originated the "Albertiana" National Festival of Theatre and Musical Works of Disabled Persons.
Finally, in the year 2003 Dymna established her own charity foundation, called Mimo Wszystko ("Against the Odds") which aims at improvement in the living conditions of the poor and disabled people. This aim is to be achieved by gradual diminishment of mental barriers that exist between the disabled and the healthy citizens of society, as well as by equalising opportunities for them.
Dymna is also the co-author of a TV program "Spotkajmy się" ("Let's meet"), in which she talks with her ill and disabled guests about "love, acceptance, loneliness, happiness, faith and hope". The program is produced in an intimate and peaceful atmosphere.
She also supported actions focused on help for the refugees from Kosovo.
Awards.
Anna Dymna has received many important awards for her artistic achievements, including the Golden Mask (1996, 1999, 2000); the Golden Screen in 1984; and the Golden Lions in 1994. The President of the Republic of Poland awarded her with the Officer’s Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta in 2004. Disabled children granted her the Order of the Smile for her charity involvement in the same year.
Other noticeable awards for Anna Dymna include:
Private life.
Dymna was married to an artist Wiesław Dymny from 1973 until his death in 1978. She often emphasized the impact her first husband had on her, owing to his colourful personality. On the 20th anniversary of his death, she asked Big Cyc, the favourite band of her son, to write three songs on the basis of Wiesław Dymny's texts.
She remarried in 1983 to Zbigniew Szota and they had a son, Michał (born 1986). They divorced in 1989. Later on she got married for the third time. Her current husband, Krzysztof Orzechowski, is an actor and theatre director.

Operation Braganza

Operation Braganza was launched on the night of 29 September 1942, by General Horrocks. It was intended as a preliminary to Operation Lightfoot, part of the Second Battle of El Alamein. The objective was to capture an area of ground near to Deir el Munassib in Egypt, to be used for extra artillery deployment. This would involve the 131st (Queen's) Brigade from the 44th (Home Counties) Division, supporting armour from the 4th Armoured Brigade, nine field regiments and one medium battery of artillery.
The battle.
The 1/6th Queens Royal regiment—on the northern side of the battle—encountered very little opposition, however in the south its sister battalion—the 1/5th—were badly handled when they ran into positions held by the paratroops of the Ramcke Brigade and the Folgore Division, losing 12 officers and 260 men killed, wounded and missing.
There were then attempts to relieve the survivors and renew the attack. In the northern part of the battle, these were successful, when the 132nd (Kent) Brigade took over, it was found that, despite little fighting, there had been a great many casualties from heatstroke in the 131st Brigade. When, on the following day, the relief operations and attempts to renew the attack in the south broke down, General Horrocks called off the operation. As a result of the losses from the operation, some of the formations were unfit for the battle (Operation Lightfoot) and General Montgomery had to change his plans of keeping divisions together. During the remaining period of training, this often led to bewildering interchange of units, which also created considerably extra difficulties for the command structure.

The Tuvalu national cricket team is the team that represents the country of Tuvalu in international cricket matches. They are not currently a member of the International Cricket Council, but the national team is still active, playing occasional matches against Kiribati.
History.
As in much of the Pacific Islands cricket was introduced to Tuvalu by missionaries in the late 19th century. However, the local population showed little interest in the game. The national side took part in the cricket tournament at the 1979 South Pacific Games in Fiji, playing against Papua New Guinea, Tonga and Western Samoa. They lost all their games and finished seventh and last.
The national side is still active however, and occasional matches are played against Kiribati. There is no formally organised competition.

Cristina Bontaș

Cristina Bontaş (born December 5, 1973 in Ştefan cel Mare, Bacău, Romania) is a Romanian former artistic gymnast, who competed in international events between 1987 and 1993. Her best events were the floor exercise, the vault, and the all around. She is a world champion on floor, a double olympic medalist and a six-time world medalist. Bontaş scored a perfect ten on floor in the all around event of the 1989 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships.
Early life and career.
She started training at the age of seven at the CSM Oneşti club under coaches Nadia Comăneci and Mihai Săndulescu. She had a successful junior career, medaling in various competitions. In 1987 her debut at a major international event (International Japan Junior Invitational) brought her four medals, one gold for vault and three silver for the all around, uneven bars and floor. At the 1988 Junior European Championships, Avignon, France she won bronze in the all around event and she managed a fifth place on vault and a seventh place on floor.
The 1988 Junior Friendship Tournament (Druzhba) was another especially successful meet: she won gold for floor, bronze for balance beam and vault and finished fourth in the all around event. In spite of her successful junior career she was the second and therefore the non traveling alternate for the team at the 1988 Olympics.
Senior career.
1989-1990.
Bontaş' debut as a senior in an international event was at the 1989 Romanian Internationals where she medaled silver for all around, uneven bars and floor and bronze for vault. 1989 was the start of a series of medals for floor and vault in international events. Bontaş was the surprise top Romanian gymnast at the 1989 World Championships, finishing in fourth place in the all around event ahead of the great Daniela Silivaş and just behind the trio of Soviet medalists (Boginskaya, Laschenova and Strazheva). In the all around event she scored a perfect 10 for the floor exercise. She won bronze on floor and tied for silver on vault with Brandy Johnson. Bontaş also contributed to the team's silver medal by achieving the third highest average score on her team.
In 1990 she won silver medal on vault at the European Championships in Athens, Greece and placed seventh in the floor and uneven bars events.
1991.
At the 1991 World Championships in Indianapolis, USA Bontaş tied for gold for floor with Oksana Chusovitina. Her performance on the floor exercise based on a musical background of well-known American songs (e.g., "The Star-Spangled Banner" (USA anthem), "Oh Susanna", "When Johnny Comes Marching Home Again", "Yankee Doodle" and "Deep in the Heart of Texas") energized the crowds. She also won the bronze medal on the all-around event, contributed heavily to the team bronze with the highest average score on her team and placed fourth on vault, seventh on uneven bars and eight on balance beam.
1992 Olympic Games.
Together with Lavinia Miloşovici, Gina Gogean, Mirela Paşca, Vanda Hădărean, and Maria Neculiţă, Bontaş was a team member of the Romanian team at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. In the team finals she had once again the highest contributing score of all her colleagues, highlighted by an average 9.95 on the floor exercise. She qualified first in the floor finals, third all around and fifth in the balance beam finals. She won silver with the team, tied for the bronze medal on floor exercise with Tatiana Gutsu and Shannon Miller, and placed fourth in the all-around and beam finals.
Post retirement.
Bontaş retired after the 1992 Olympic games. She first coached in Romania and did some TV commentaries for gymnastics events. Later, she coached in Italy and in Wales. When the contract in Wales was up, Bontaş immigrated to Canada to coach at Hamilton's Mountain Star Gymnastics. She went back to Romania in 1998 to marry, returning to Canada without husband Gabi Tătaru while they waited for immigration papers. After several months, her husband was able to join her in Canada, he too coaching at Hamilton Mountain Gym Elites (formerly Mountain Star Gymnastics). The couple have a daughter named Elisa, born May 1999 and a son, born in April 2002.
In September 2003, Bontaş and her husband opened their own gymnastics club in Hamilton, World Class Gymnastics. Here Bontaş was training her pupils for the 2012 Olympic Games.

Oxymorphazone

Oxymorphazone is an opioid analgesic drug related to oxymorphone. Oxymorphazone is a potent and long acting μ-opioid agonist which binds irreversibly to the receptor, forming a covalent bond which prevents it from detaching once bound. This gives it an unusual pharmacological profile, and while oxymorphazone is only around half the potency of oxymorphone, with higher doses the analgesic effect becomes extremely long lasting, with a duration of up to 48 hours. However, tolerance to analgesia develops rapidly with repeated doses, as chronically activated opioid receptors are rapidly internalised by β-arrestins, similar to the results of non-covalent binding by agonists with extremely high binding affinity such as lofentanil.

Duncan Patterson (born 5 June 1975) is a Liverpool born musician, (of Irish nationality) best known for his work as a member of Anathema (1991–1998) and Antimatter (1998–2005).
Career.
Patterson was a driving force behind Anathema's success during their early years, being co-principle songwriter (with Daniel Cavanagh) on the band's first four albums. As such, he helped them to define the death/doom sound (along with bands like Paradise Lost and My Dying Bride), as well as being a catalyst in Anathema's shift towards a softer, deeper style. After releasing four albums with Antimatter, spanning several genres (ambient, electronica, acoustic), he has now started another full time project called Íon, a mix of acoustic and traditional music. In between recording and touring his own projects, he has enjoyed chart success with the Irish alternative rock band The Aftermath, playing on three Top 20 singles, as well as appearing on their debut album, "Friendlier Up Here" alongside The Waterboys' Steve Wickham. Patterson also wrote and performed the music on the German rapper Bushido's single, "Von der Skyline zum Bordstein zurück", which charted at #14 in Germany. He is also the founder of Strangelight Records, a small independent record label.
Patterson's music was used in Hisham Zreiq's films, music that was composed for Íon was used in the award-winning film "The sons of Eilaboun", and music that was composed for Antimatter was used in the film, "Just Another Day". In December 2011 he recorded another full length album, with a new project titled Alternative 4 titled 'The Brink' released by Avantgarde Music.
In 2012, he recorded mandolin for the unofficial Irish Euro 2012 anthem alongside Shane MacGowan, entitled "The Rockier Road To Poland".

NG-Gamer

Next Generation Gamer, commonly abbreviated as NG-Gamer, is one of the largest gaming websites in the Benelux. It can be accessed via the extensions .eu, .be or .nl, though the latter is the main extension. NG-Gamer is fed entirely by volunteered work by its editors.
History.
The domain for NG-Gamer was reserved back in 2004, though the actual site was founded in 2005, by Christian de Jong and Raoul Wolff. Before the website had even been firmly created, they started a search for people with interests and the needed capacities to supply a website with news and articles. After a search of several months, a crew was assembled.
NG-Gamer officially went online in November 2005. The launch of the website went as planned. Though during the course of the first several months online, several members of the crew left the team. However, NG-Gamer acquired several new crewmembers to compensate the loss. These crewmembers have supplied the website with a steady amount of newsposts, articles, screenshots, video’s and more, making NG-Gamer what it is today.
NG-Gamer as a source.
NG-Gamer gained some international fame due to its lengthy interview with Randy Pitchford about , an interview that was spread out over three articles. Other interviews such as the interview with Miroslaw Dymek, Technical Director of Reality Pump Studios about Two Worlds also gained fame. Though these two are not the only contributions of NG-Gamer that were used as sources or references by other media. 
NG-Gamer's Martijn Müller was also been the first source to mention Sony’s release of PlayStation Home. Details were later given by Kotaku with NG-Gamer to finally confirm the rumors. This reporter was also the first source, in 2007, to report on Electronic Arts' interest in a remake or sequel of American McGee's Alice, which was officially announced in 2009. In January 2010, NG-Gamer was the first to confirm the development of Killzone 3, 2 months before it was first officially confirmed.
In the Dutch community, NG-Gamer was one of the few outlets to be given a number of multiplayer beta codes to Halo 3.
The future of NG-Gamer.
Though nobody has an actual working crystal ball to foresee the future, intentions are to implements several new functions. Amongst these are:
NG-Gamer content.
Screenshots and videos.
Screenshots have been a part of the NG-Gamer database ever since the beginning. Video’s however were introduced in May 2007. Video’s from Gametrailers, iFilm and YouTube can now be seen at their corresponding gamepage. The latest video’s appear on the front page and can be accessed there.
Articles.
NG-Gamer is supplied by several kind of articles. These vary from columns to previews to reviews. Columns are always somewhat related to gaming, but are biased opinions of the writers. Previews and reviews however always handle a single subject, whether it’s a videogame or a piece of hardware. The authors try to remain as neutral as possible whilst analyzing the subject, though a review is always just another opinion. The articles themselves can be accessed via the appropriate gamepage, though the latest articles appear on the front page with a spotlight and superlight.
Not all articles are written by the crewmembers themselves. A system has been implanted to allow users to post their own articles, for which they are awarded full credit. With the allowance of html tags, these articles can be supported with pictures to brighten them up and make them more attractive.
Reputation system and the community.
Unlike most communities, NG-Gamer members do not gain fame by posting a lot. Instead they start with a reputation score of 10. Their reactions to newspost, articles, etc. get a score from zero to three, with three being highest. The more good scores you have, the higher your reputation gets, or vice versa. The lowest reputation score is zero whilst thirty is the highest. User’s reputation score can be seen next to their username.
The reputation system is also connected to a filter. Users have the ability to filter out responses of other members by selecting the minimum score they want to see.
Although NG-Gamer has several hundreds of thousands unique visitors each month, few of them actually use the forums. These are mostly used by either the crewmembers themselves, or a group of hardcore visitors. NG-Gamer is working on a strategy to make their forums more attractive and expand their community.
One of the strategies used to attract more people to use the forums, etc. is the implementation of the previously mentioned option for users to contribute their own articles. Other options, such as a list of favorite boards, topics, newsposts, etc. are also to contribute to making NG-Gamer more appealing to users.
PSP-, PDA- and mobile phone versions.
NG-Gamer has several versions of its website up and running. All of these versions are custom made so that they can be used in an optimal way wi th the corresponding platform. The PSP version of NG-Gamer went live on February 27, 2006. The PDA and mobile phone versions went live at launch.
The NG-Gamer crew.
General Management, PR-management and Editors in Chief.
Raoul Wolff and Christian de Jong.
Along with Christian de Jong, Raoul Wolff was the founding member of NG-Gamer. He left early 2006 due to disagreement with Christian about the policy of NG-Gamer. His function as General Manager would not be succeeded. Christian kept his position as General Manager until his departure in October 2007. Christian no longer had the time or motivation to invest into NG-Gamer. Hence, he sold the website to Daan de Jong and Sander Schetters.
Daan de Jong and Sander Schetters.
Daan de Jong would pick up his function as General Manager in October 2007 when he and Sander Schetters bought NG-Gamer from Christian de Jong. Sander however, left the team in early 2008 due to unknown reasons.
Michiel Hanswijk.
It was clear from the beginning that an Editor in Chief was needed. Therefore, Michiel Hanswijk was assigned this function in January 2006. During the course of the year he would also get assigned the job of PR-contact. He would keep fulfilling these functions until his departure in December 2007. The reason for this was that Michiel no longer saw the possibility to combine his personal life with his function as he simply did not have enough spare time to invest into NG-Gamer. His function would then be assigned to Dominique Pijnenburg. Michiel rejoined the crew though in June 2008. After the departure of Wesley Winterswijk, he would pick up his old function as PR-contact, which he would soon drop once again. This time it's because he has completely lost the time, being sponsored as a skater.
Kenny Lammers.
Kenny Lammers started as PR-contact for NG-Gamer in January 2006. He supplied the website with review copies of games, goodies and games to give away, interviews with developers, etc. Due to his excellent work as PR-contact, he was also assigned the function of Editor in Chief in July 2006. Due to a hectic personal life, Kenny resigned from this function. His PR-contacts were taken over by Editor in Chief Michiel Hanswijk. Joeri Crauwels gained Kenny’s function as Editor in Chief.
In January 2008, former PR-contact and Editor in Chief Kenny Lammers got into a car accident. While his car ended up a complete wreck, he and his girlfriend got out with a scare and some bruises. According to Kenny, someone above must have been watching over him. The circumstances involving the accident are unknown, but fatigue was certainly amongst the causes.
Joeri Crauwels.
Joeri would pick up Kenny’s function as Editor in Chief after his departure in March 2007. Joeri would keep fulfilling this function until his departure in January 2008. However, Joeri rejoined the crew in June 2008. As of September 2008 he would reprise his role as Editor in Chief alongside Dominique Pijnenburg until April 2012.
Dominque Pijnenburg.
Dominique applied for free spot of Editor in Chief after the departure of Michiel. He was assigned this function several weeks later.

Viktor Vinogradov

Viktor Vladimirovich Vinogradov (; , Zaraysk, Russian Empire – 4 October 1969, Moscow, USSR) was a Soviet linguist and philologist who presided over Soviet linguistics after World War II. 
Vinogradov's teachers at the Petrograd Institute of History and Philology included Lev Shcherba and Aleksey Shakhmatov, but Charles Bally's ideas influenced him the most deeply during his formative years. He made his mark as a scholar of Russian literature with a series of works examining the style and language of Russian classical writers, including Alexander Pushkin (1935, 1941), Nikolai Gogol (1936), Mikhail Lermontov (1941), and Anna Akhmatova (a family friend, 1925). In 1926 he married Nadezhda Malysheva (Надежда Матвеевна Виноградова-Малышева, 1897-1990), a singing teacher.
From the standpoint of linguistics, Vinogradov set out as a good-natured critic of the Russian Formalists: he was on friendly terms with many of them. After moving from Leningrad to Moscow in 1929 he became implicated in the "Slavists conspiracy" and the authorities exiled him to Vyatka in 1934. Two years later, he was allowed to settle somewhat closer to the capital, in Mozhaysk, only to be exiled to Siberia after Hitler's invasion of Russia in 1941. His father, an Orthodox priest, was purged in 1930.
After Joseph Stalin became alarmed with the (mis)management of Soviet linguistics by Nicholas Marr and his followers, Vinogradov found himself appointed Director of the Linguistics Institute (1950). The authorities heaped honors on him in profusion: he was elected into the Soviet Academy of Sciences and was awarded the Stalin Prize (1951). This sudden reversal of fortune made him willing to gratify the authorities, as was demonstrated by his participation in the notorious Sinyavsky-Daniel trial (1965-1966). Vinogradov's rise to power cemented his followers (Sergei Ozhegov, Natalia Shvedova) into the dominant academic school of Soviet linguistics. The Russian Language Institute, which he administered from 1958, still bears his name.

Irish FA Charity Shield

The Irish FA Charity Shield is a now-defunct football competition which involved teams from Northern Ireland that was held on an occasional basis through the 1990s and early-2000s. Similar to the English FA Charity Shield (now Community Shield) it pitted together the previous campaign's Irish League champions and Irish Cup winners and provided the opening match of the Irish League season.
Sponsorship.
The competition ran only when a willing sponsor was available. The two companies to provide sponsorship were McEwan's Lager (1992–1994) and Wilkinson Sword (1998–2000), both of whom also sponsored other competitions in Irish League football.
Format.
Held in early August as a single match, if the scores were level at full-time the trophy was shared between the two competing sides for a period of six months.

Arfon Griffiths

Arfon Trevor Griffiths (born 23 August 1941) is a Welsh former football player and manager. During his playing career which lasted from 1959 to 1979, Griffiths played at both professional and international levels, before becoming a football manager.
Career.
Born in Wrexham, Griffiths was originally spotted in local junior football by former Wrexham player Frank Blew, who then alerted the club's manager Cliff Lloyd. He initially signed Griffiths on amateur forms in May 1957, as the youngster turned down offers of trials from both Liverpool and Sheffield Wednesday. This started a 22 year-long association between with Wrexham as both player and manager.
He made his first team in a 2-1 home win over Reading in November 1959, having been a member of the previous season’s successful Welsh Youth Cup winning side. He kept his place in the side for the rest of the season collecting a Welsh Cup winners' medal from a 1-0 win over Cardiff City.
He became an established member of the side during 1960-61, and it was not long before the bigger clubs began to take an interest. In February 1961 Arsenal paid £15,500 to take him to Highbury, and he made his debut in a 5-1 defeat at the hands of Wolverhampton Wanderers on 22 April 1961. He broke through intermittently in the 1961-62 season, making 14 league appearances as an attacking midfiielder, scoring twice. Unable to maintain a first-team place, Griffiths returned to Wrexham in September 1962.
Affectionately known to Wrexham fans as the 'Prince of Wales', he played a major part to some of the most successful years in Wrexham Football Club's history. These include guiding the club to promotion in both 1962-63 and 1969–70; winning the Welsh Cup four times; playing in three European campaigns, which included reaching the quarter-final stages of the European Cup Winners' Cup in 1976, before losing out to the eventual winners RSC Anderlecht, 2-1, on aggregate. He was awarded a testimonial match in 1972 against Bill Shankly's Liverpool, which netted him £3,000 for his testimonial fund. In total he made a club record 591 Football League appearances and scoring the second highest total number of goals in the club's history, 120.
These successes also led him on to international recognition by gaining 17 full Welsh caps, the highlight of which was scoring at the Racecourse Ground against Austria in 1975, which enabled Wales to qualify for the 1976 European Football Championship finals. He was also selected for a Welsh FA tour to New Zealand, Australia, Tahiti and Malaysia in 1971.
He played under eight managers at Wrexham, before taking charge himself in the summer of 1977 following the resignation of John Neal. Arfon had previously been his assistant manager for a year. Wrexham's directors had no hesitation in appointing him as Neal's replacement, and he kept faith with the same squad that had just missed out on promotion at the end of the previous season.
He was soon to lose the services of Billy Ashcroft, however, who followed Neal to Middlesbrough. Griffiths then splashed out in the transfer market, spending £60,000 to bring in Dixie McNeil from Hereford United as Ashcroft's replacement; £8,000 for Dai Davies from Everton; and £40,000 to Coventry City for Les Cartwright. These three signings were a key part of the side that Griffiths led to the Third Division championship, becoming the first manager in the club's history to win promotion to the then Second Division.
Injuries affected the team's performances in the Second Division and they struggled to come to terms with a higher grade of football. When the going got tough the crowds began to drop, and, in the summer of 1981, Griffiths resigned on a matter of principle after an internal disagreement.
Although he began to assist Bangor City with their training in an advisory capacity, he was to make a quick return to football management, however, when he was appointed manager of Crewe Alexandra on 3 August 1981. He spent just over a season at Gresty Road until relieved of his duties in October 1982. He did play for his local side, Gresford Athletic, in the Welsh National League, for a short while, before finishing with football altogether to concentrate on his newsagents' shop in the village and playing golf.
Griffiths was awarded the MBE in June 1976 for his services to Welsh soccer, and he in 2006 he was made Club President of his home town club, Wrexham, as well as being added to the club's Hall of Fame.

Ralph Kerr

Captain Ralph Kerr CBE (16 August 1891 – 24 May 1941) was an officer in the Royal Navy. He served in the First and Second World Wars, and was killed in the sinking of by the German battleship "Bismarck" at the Battle of the Denmark Strait.
Early life.
Kerr was born on 16 August 1891, the only son of Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Russell Kerr, and his wife Lady Kerr, of Newnham on Severn, Gloucestershire. He joined the Royal Navy on 15 May 1904, and after service as a cadet he rose through the ranks, being promoted to Lieutenant on 28 February 1914. He served in the First World War, spending most of the period aboard the battleship HMS "Benbow", the flagship of Admiral Sir Doveton Sturdee. He was present at the Battle of Jutland in May 1916, and by 1918 he had been given his own command, that of the destroyer HMS "Cossack".
With the destroyers.
Kerr was promoted to Commander on 30 June 1927 and in December 1928 he was given command of the destroyer HMS "Windsor", followed by HMS "Thruster" in August 1929. He commanded "Thruster" until February 1931, and after a year on land, returned to sea in February 1932 in command of HMS "Decoy". Promotion to Captain followed on 30 June 1935, and on 6 September 1935 he became commander of the Flotilla leader and Captain (D) of the 21st Destroyer Flotilla. He stepped down from the position on 22 May 1936. His commander, Admiral Thomson reported that he had found Kerr to be "A very capable Captain (D) who has trained his Flotilla well. An officer probably much better suited to the practical side of naval life rather than to Staff duties. A strong personality with definite powers of command and a very good seaman. Most loyal and is very thorough in the carrying out of his duties. Social qualities good. Physically fit and has good powers of endurance."
Kerr became Senior Officer, Reserve Fleet aboard HMS "Caledon" in July 1936, transferring to HMS "Colombo" on 3 November 1936. As well as being the senior officer of the reserve fleet he then also became Chief Staff Officer to the Rear-Admiral of the 10th Cruiser Squadron, where he remained for the next year, until July 1937. Vice-Admiral Sir Gerald Dickens also produced a highly favourable report, noting that Kerr was "A very keen zealous officer who has done well as Senior Officer Reserve Fleet. Has plenty of character and drive and is mentally alert. A good seaman and a sound administrator. Very loyal, while ambitious to do well. Good social qualities. Keeps fit."
Kerr was to have then received an appointment to command the Flotilla leader HMS "Duncan", where he would be Captain (D) of the 8th Destroyer Flotilla. The appointment was cancelled before he could take it up however. Instead, after a period of training, he became commander of HMS "Hardy" and Captain (D) of the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla. During this period he served under Vice-Admiral John Tovey, and impressed both him, and the Commander-in-Chief Mediterranean Admiral Sir Dudley Pound. Kerr then took command of HMS "Broke" and the 15th Destroyer Flotilla, later transferring to the shore establishment HMS "Cochrane", at Rosyth on 30 August 1939. He remained at Rosyth with the Rosyth Destroyer Force until 24 January 1940, spending time on the staff of the Commander-in-Chief, Rosyth. He was awarded the CBE in 1940.
HMS "Hood".
Kerr took command of the battlecruiser on 15 February 1941. Command of the Navy's largest capital ship was a major change, Kerr having only previously commanded destroyers. He took her to sea on the completion of her refit in mid March, and carried out gunnery exercises and patrols off Iceland. He was commander of "Hood" for just three months, when he was killed at the Battle of the Denmark Strait, along with most of his crew, when "Hood" was sunk by the German battleship "Bismarck". He was posthumously Mentioned in Despatches. Kerr is commemorated on Portsmouth Naval Memorial.
Family.
He had married Margaret Augusta Kerr on 14 February 1920, the marriage producing two children, Russell and Jane. They resided in St John's Wood, London. Russell Kerr, who had served as a Captain in the Royal Artillery and as a tank commander, was killed while fighting in Burma in 1945.

Montjuïc Cemetery

Montjuïc Cemetery, known in Catalan as Cementiri del Sud-oest or Cementiri de Montjuïc, is located on one of the rocky slopes of Montjuïc hill in Barcelona.
History.
It was opened on 17 March 1883 by the city of Barcelona as its main cemetery, supplanting the older cemetery at Poblenou in the east. It now contains over one million burials and cremation ashes in 150,000 plots, niches and mausolea and is operated by Cementiris de Barcelona S.A.
The city became heavily industrialised during the 19th century and its economic and growth led Barcelona becoming the centre of the Principality of Catalonia and a major city of Spain. The growth in population led to an increased demand for burial facilities, and a location was chosen on the slopes of Montjuïc, away from the pressures of housing development. The steep slopes of the hillside give Montjuïc its special character, with winding paths and terraced niches looking seawards over the harbour.
The cemetery contains one Commonwealth war grave, British Army Private Charles Hill (d. 1941) of the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders who died fighting during World War II.
Monument design.
The timing of the cemetery and its memorials coincided with several artistic and design movements; its early monuments are inspired by classic and Gothic styles, while those of the Fin de siècle exhibit the influence of the Art-Nouveau design movement. In Catalonia that style developed into Modernisme, as it was known in the Catalan language.

Earl Thompson (author)

Earl Thompson ( May 24, 1931 – November 9, 1978 ) was a leading American writer of naturalist prose. Nominated for the National Book Award for "A Garden of Sand" and chosen by the Book of the Month Club for "Tattoo", Thompson died suddenly at the peak of his success, having published just three novels—the fourth "The Devil to Pay", was published posthumously.
Life and career.
Thompson was born in Wichita, Kansas in 1931. His first novel "A Garden of Sand" describes the events of his birth and early childhood in vivid detail. "Tattoo" picks up where his first novel left off with his protagonist joining the U.S. Navy. Both novels are autobiographical, with the lead character (called Jack MacDeramid in the first and Jack Andersen in the second) a close facsimile of Thompson himself.
Thompson's third novel "Caldo Largo" was his first to depart from his autobiographical preoccupations, although its main setting—a fishing boat—was one with which Thompson had had first-hand experience. 
Two years after "Caldo Largo" was published, Thompson died of a heart-attack in Sausalito, California. His fourth and last book, "The Devil to Pay", returns to his autobiographical narrative—this time with a nearly identical protagonist called Jarl Carlson ("Jarl" is the Scandinavian form of Earl)—and was published after his death by Thompson's friend and estate executor Gilmer Y. Waggoner. The book is considerably shorter than the dense "A Garden of Sand" and its counterpart "Tattoo", and according to Waggoner, was finished by a ghostwriter.
Thompson served in the U.S. Coast Guard from 1945–46 and in the U.S. Army from 1948–54, serving as a Sergeant First Class, Tank Commander, and First Sergeant. He attended the University of Missouri from 1954–57, and Columbia University in 1959–60. Thompson lived in Europe for several years, and taught a novelist workshop at the University of California at Berkeley.

Lincoln Park, Denver

Lincoln Park is a neighborhood and public park close to downtown Denver, Colorado and the location of the Santa Fe Arts District.
The neighborhood, which has about 7,000 residents, is one of Denver's oldest and is just to the south of the area where Denver was first settled in the 1850s. Many houses date from about 1900. Based on data from 2000 for the combined Auraria and Lincoln Park neighborhoods, the racial makeup of the neighborhood is 32.38% White, 7.23% African American, 3.97% Asian, 1.51% Native American. Hispanic or Latino of any race is 52.47% of the population. The crime rate and poverty rate are also much higher than city and national averages. The crime rate is 196 incidents per 1,000 people and a poverty rate of 37.64%.
Interstate 25 runs north-south through the western part of the neighborhood. The RTD's light rail line also runs north-south through the neighborhood and includes a station located at 10th Avenue and Osage Street. The neighborhood is sometimes called "La Alma/Lincoln Park" or the West Side. 
The Santa Fe Arts District, on Santa Fe Drive between 6th and 12th Avenues (its primary retail and commercial corridor), includes more than 40 galleries, restaurants and shops. The "First Friday Art Walk" and the "Collectors' Night" are monthly events in the district. 
The Denver Civic Theater on Santa Fe Drive was opened in 1921 as a cinema house, one of Denver's first silent movie theaters. The building was later used for various purposes (even as a meatpacking plant), before it was eventually renovated in 1993 as a neighborhood arts center containing two theaters (one with 332 seats, another with 134) and an art gallery. The venue has been used by local playwrights and a resident performance company for dramatic productions, and in 2010 became the new home of El Centro Su Teatro.
