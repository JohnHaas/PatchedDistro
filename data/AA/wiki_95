MissionFish

Founded in 1999, MissionFish is the partner charity of eBay, which runs auction and shopping websites in 30 countries. Through MissionFish, eBay users are able to donate to registered nonprofit organisations when they buy and sell through the eBay.com and eBay.co.uk sites. The programmes are called eBay Giving Works and eBay for Charity, respectively.
In June 2008, eBay announced that its global user base, through eBay Giving Works and eBay for Charity, had raised over $150M for good causes from listings created around the world.
MissionFish’s role in the partnership is to provide the technology that enables eBay users to make donations when they buy and sell through the sites; to vet, register and advise nonprofits that wish to participate in the programme; and to collect and process donations made by eBay users.
History and milestones.
MissionFish was launched in the US in 2000 as an online exchange, where nonprofits could accept in-kind gifts, keep anything useful, and sell the rest. MissionFish was supported by Points of Light (formerly the Points of Light Foundation), The Case Foundation, and The Pew Charitable Trusts.
In 2003, eBay and MissionFish collaborated to build the eBay Giving Works programme, which enables eBay sellers to donate a percentage of their proceeds to the registered nonprofit of their choice.
Later that year, the nonprofit Communities in Schools auctioned lunches with leaders through eBay Giving Works, raising $157,000.
By May 2004, over 2000 nonprofits had signed up for eBay Giving Works, and had raised about $30m.
In 2004 MissionFish was awarded First Place for growth stage ventures in the Social Enterprise Alliance’s 2004 Earned Income Showcase. In 2005, MissionFish was a Grand-Prize winner of the Yale School of Management – The Goldman Sachs Foundation Partnership on Nonprofit Ventures.
MissionFish (UK) was set up in 2005, and began working on eBay for Charity that year. The first eBay for Charity auction took place in November 2005 for the charity BBC Children in Need.
In 2006, the NSPCC ran part of its Dream Auction through eBay for Charity, raising over £500,000.
eBay for Charity opened to all registered charities in 2006. Since then, over 5,500 charities have joined the programme, raising over £27m.
Recent developments.
In May 2008, eBay and MissionFish relaunched eBay Giving Works and eBay for Charity, incorporating all MissionFish’s donation functions within eBay users’ My eBay accounts. This change removed the need for donors to register separate accounts with MissionFish, and led to a considerable growth in charity listings. As of July 2008, there were over 100,000 live listings benefiting charities on the eBay websites.
In June 2008 a lunch with investor and philanthropist, Warren Buffett, was sold to a Chinese businessman for $2.1m, becoming the most expensive charity item ever to be sold on eBay. 
In July 2008, two board members of MissionFish UK, Abbie Rumbold and Mike Kelly, were appointed to the Cabinet Office’s third sector advisory panel, which was set up to provide ministers “with clear and authoritative advice on policy regarding the third sector.”
[http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/third_sector/news/news_stories/080701_advisory.aspx]
Products and donation processing.
In 2009, MissionFish launched new giving products on eBay, enabling eBay users to make cash donations to charity when they shop and browse the eBay site. The most successful of these, which enables eBay buyers to add a small donation at checkout, has raised over $5m in the US, and over £2.5m in the UK.
MissionFish is partly funded by deductions from donations. These vary from 3.75% for cash donations, up to around 11%-20% from donations made from the proceeds of eBay sales, on a sliding scale. (For US sellers, the scale is as follows: 20% of the first $50, 15% of the next $50–$199, 10% of the next $200–$999 of each individual donation for processing costs)

Clavering Windmills

Clavering Windmills are a pair of Grade II listed Tower mills at Clavering, Essex, England which have both been converted to residential use. They are named North Mill and South Mill. A third mill existed in Clavering until the mid-nineteenth century, known as Clavering Mill.
History.
Clavering Mill.
"Clavering Mill" was a Post mill. It was marked on a map dated c.1625 and then in the ownership of Sir Francis Barrington. In 1702 it was conveyed to Sir Charles Barrington. The mill was marked on Warburton, Bland and Smyth’s map of 1724. It was marked on a plan of Clavering dated 1783 and also on the 1840 Tithe map of Clavering. White’s Directory of 1848 records three millers in Clavering, the last date at which the post mill can be assumed to have been standing.
North Mill.
"North Mill" was built for James Pavitt in 1811, working in conjunction with the post mill until 1845. A oil engine was installed in 1919 by Thomas Hunt, the Soham millwright. The sails were removed about this time, but the mill worked by the engine for many years.
South Mill.
"South Mill" was built in 1757. The mill was idle in 1906, but then put back to work by its new owner, William Caton. It worked by wind until autumn 1919 and the sails were removed the following spring. No auxiliary power was provided, the mill working by wind alone.
Description.
Clavering Mill.
No details are known of this mill, although it would have had Common sails when built. It is not known whether there was a roundhouse or not.
North Mill.
"North Mill" is a five storey tower mill with a beehive cap, winded by a fantail. It had four Single Patent sails, which rotated clockwise. The Upright Shaft is wooden, as is the clasp arm Great Spur Wheel, which drove three pairs of millstones overdrift.
South mill.
"South Mill" is a four storey tower mill with a beehive cap with a gallery. It was winded by a fantail It had four Single Spring sails. The mill drove two pairs of French Burr millstones.

Dese Bones G'wine Rise Again

Dese Bones G'wine Rise Again is an American Negro spiritual that tells the story of the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden.
In this spiritual, a caller tells the story in rhymed couplets; each line of the couplet is followed by the final line of an abbreviated chorus sung in answer by the audience or congregation. Between each couplet, a complete chorus is sung. In the example below, the sung chorus is given in italics; the other words are the caller's lyrics:
De Lawd, He thought He’d make a man
"Dese bones gwine rise again"
Made ‘im outa mud an’ a han’ful o’ san
"Dese bones gwine to rise again"
"I knowed it Indeed I knowed it, brother"
"I knowed it Dese bones gwine to rise again"
There are several variants of the lyrics; the dramatic and creative talents of the caller generate considerable variation. For one version of the lyrics, see the external link below.

Libys

Libys is a genus of the prehistoric coelacanth lobe-finned fish, an intermediary form between sea and land animals. It belongs to the family of Latimeridae, which is also the family of the living coelacanth, "Latimeria". These fishes lived during the Upper Jurassic period (Kimmeridgian - Tithonian, about 150 to 145 million years ago).
Description.
"Libys" had an exceptionally squat body, especially when compared to other coelacanths of the same period as Undina and Holophagus species. Libys could reach 60 centimeters in length and was therefore a medium-sized coelacanth, with a short and high skull. The pectoral fins were quite long, while the tail was remarkably short and high
Distribution.
Fossils of these fishes have been found in Germany, in the famous deposits of Solnhofen.
Species.
Genus "Libys" has been described for the first time in 1842 by Muenster. The species "Libys polypterus" was then established as the type species, on the basis of fragmentary remains. Later has been described another species ("Libys superbus"), on the basis of a complete large specimens, but most authors believe that these two forms have in reality to be considered conspecific.

Maly Uzen River

Maly Uzen () is a river in Saratov Oblast of Russia and West Kazakhstan Province of Kazakhstan. It is 638 km in length, with a drainage basin of 18 250 km². 
The Maly Uzen has its sources north of the town Yershov, on the western edge of the Obshchy Syrt plateau in Russia, and flows in a generally southerly direction over the steppes of the Caspian Depression. It terminates in West-Kazakhstan, in a network of small lakes and swamps called the Kamysh-Samarskiye Lakes. The Maly Uzen runs parallel to the Bolshoy Uzen River, some 50 km further east.
Most of the river's waters comes from melting snow, and its discharge it therefore at its peak in April, while in the summer parts of the river will dry up completely. At the village of Maly Uzen the discharge varies from 3.4 m³/s to 782 m³/s. The river freezes over in December, and stays icebound to the end of March - beginning of April. 
The river is used for water supply and irrigation.

Dance for the Sun

Dance for the Sun, "Yoga Songs for Kids", is the self-released 2006 debut album by Kira Willey.
Background.
Willey initially began writing music in the forms of lullabies to her daughter. After a few years passed, she started playing the guitar, writing more often, and had begun teaching Yoga classes in New York City to children. The songs for "Dance for the Sun" were written with her class in mind, and after building up a collection, Willey began using these songs as a musical guide to compliment her class, and received positive feedback from both her daughter and her class. When recording the album, Willey enlisted the help of her brother for bass vocals, her cousin for percussion and production, and several of the children in her class to provide vocals, nicknamed the "OmGirls". "Dance for the Sun" was released on December 1, 2006 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
The album is primarily 15 tracks, the ones which appear first. The remainder are bonus tracks, which are of live recordings in her Yoga class that include children singing along and participating. The booklet contains educational illustrations of Yoga positions and poses that coincide with the bonus tracks.
The song "Colors" was popularized by its use in a Dell computers commercial, called "Portraits". The 31-second commercial showcased the company's laptop model, which featured casing in a variety of colors, presumably to match an aspect of the owner or their personality. This was part of a campaign that Dell ran, which asked consumers "What's your color?".
Review.
Among critics of children's music, "Dance for the Sun" has received positive reviews, but it is said to be enjoyable by listeners of any age, and in the August 2007, Cookie Magazine said that "Dance for the Sun" was "joyful, upbeat, and eminently danceable. Willey’s vocals have a breezy coffeehouse quality that will appeal to listeners young and old alike." 
"Dance for the Sun" has won several awards; an Independent Music Award for Best Children's Album, as well as a 2008 Parent's Choice Award. The track "Caterpillar Caterpillar" has also won an Independent Music Award and a Children's Music Web Award for Best Song.

No. 76 Squadron RAF

No. 76 Squadron was a squadron of the Royal Air Force. It was formed during World War I as a home defence fighter squadron and in its second incarnation during World War II flew as a bomber squadron, first as an operational training unit and later as an active bomber squadron. With the end of the war the squadron converted to the role of transport squadron, to be reactivated shortly in the bomber role during the 1950s. From 2007 to 2011, it was a training unit, equipped with the Short Tucano at RAF Linton-on-Ouse.
History.
First World War.
No. 76 Squadron, RFC was formed at Ripon, Yorkshire for home defence duties on 15 September 1916 in the Yorkshire area, having detachments at Copmanthorpe, Helperby and Catterick. It was equipped with Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2s and B.E.12s, these being replaced by Bristol F.2Bs in 1918. The squadron disbanded at Tadcaster on 13 June 1919, having seen no action during this part of its service life.
Second World War.
Wellesleys, Hampdens and Ansons.
The squadron was next reformed at RAF Finningley on 12 April 1937 from 'B' Flight of No. 7 Squadron, equipped with Vickers Wellesley bombers. These were replaced by Handley Page Hampdens and Avro Ansons in April 1939, the unit moving to RAF Upper Heyford at the outbreak of war. It performed an operational training role until 8 April 1940, when it merged with No. 7 Squadron to form No. 16 Operational Training Unit (OTU).
Halifaxes.
The squadron reformed shortly on 30 April 1940 at RAF West Raynham as a Hampden unit before being disbanded on 2 May 1940. On 1 May 1941, the squadron reformed properly at RAF Linton-on-Ouse as the second Handley Page Halifax bomber squadron, part of the newly created No. 4 Group, RAF Bomber Command. The Squadron moved to RAF Middleton St. George in June 1941, returning to Linton-on-Ouse in July 1942. The squadron moving again, this time to RAF Holme-on-Spalding Moor in June 1943 as part of a policy to allow the newly formed Canadian 6 Group to use the better equipped RAF stations that had been built pre-war. The Squadron had a substantial number of Norwegian pilots and aircrew
From August 1942 to April 1943, No 76 Squadron was commanded by Wing Commander Leonard Cheshire.
Dakotas.
With the rest of No.4 Group, 76 Squadron was transferred to RAF Transport Command in May 1945, re-equipping with Dakotas, shortly thereafter moving to RAF Broadwell. It moved to India in September the same year, where it was disbanded on 1 September 1946 at Palam Airport by being re-numbered to No. 62 Squadron.
Post-war.
On 9 December 1953 the squadron reformed at RAF Wittering, equipped with Canberra B.2 bombers. The squadron moved in November 1955 to RAF Weston Zoyland, for Operation Grapple. Some of these aircraft were tasked with collecting air samples during the Operation Grapple nuclear trials in 1956/58. The squadron disbanded on 30 December 1960 at RAF Upwood.
Training.
The squadron remained dormant until 1 May 2007, when the Tucano Air Navigation Squadron at RAF Linton-on-Ouse was redesignated as No. 76 (Reserve) Squadron. In 2008, Prince William spent three months at Linton learning to fly. The Squadron continued to train WSOs (Weapons Systems Officers) until December 2010, and was disbanded in May 2011.

Lotus Evora

The Lotus Evora is a sports car produced by British car manufacturer Lotus. The car, which was developed under the project name "Project Eagle", was launched as the Evora on 22 July 2008 at the British International Motor Show.
Development.
The Lotus Evora is based on the first all-new vehicle platform from Lotus Cars since the introduction of the Lotus Elise in 1995 (the Exige, introduced in 2000, and the 2006 Europa S are both derivatives of the Elise). Evora was planned to be the first vehicle of three to be built on the same platform.
Evora is the first product of a five-year plan started in 2006 to expand the Lotus line-up beyond its current track-specialized offerings, with the aim of making Evora a somewhat of a more practical road car that would appeal to the mainstream. As such it is a larger car than recent Lotus models Elise and its derivatives (Exige, Europa S, etc.), with an unladen weight of . 
It is currently the only Lotus model with a 2+2 configuration, although it has been announced that it will also be offered in a two-seater configuration, referred to as the "Plus Zero" option. It is also the only 2+2 mid engined coupé on sale. The interior is larger to allow taller persons to fit, such as Lotus CEO Mike Kimberley, and two 6'5" (195.6cm) tall people.
The cooled boot behind the engine is large enough to fit a set of golf clubs, although Lotus Design Head Russell Carr denies that this was intentional. Lotus intends Evora to compete with different market sectors including the Porsche Cayman.
Name.
The name "Evora" keeps the Lotus tradition of beginning model names with an "E". The name is derived from the words evolution, vogue, and aura. Other names considered were Eagle, Exira and Ethos; Exira was rejected as it was considered not good enough and the other two because it would be difficult for Lotus to claim them as a trademark. The name "Evora" sounds similar to Évora, which is the name of a Portuguese city and UNESCO World Heritage Site, in Portugal.
Production.
Sales were expected to start in summer 2009, The sales target is 2000 cars per year, with prices between £45,000 and just over £50,000. and in America from the beginning of 2010.
Reviews.
The car was reviewed by Jeremy Clarkson on the television show "Top Gear". Overall his review was positive: he was very happy with the performance, handling and comfort. He was extremely impressed with the ride comfort even after driving it into a field saying "Here, the suspension is taking the knocks, not me." and described the car as "the only car I've ever driven, ever, which is a killer attack dog and an old sofa". However, he considered the rear seats to have not enough legroom, the interior felt tiny and the satellite navigation was sub-optimal.
Motorsport.
Ollie Hancock won the Nurburgring round of the 2010 GT4 European Cup season. A team including Johnny Mowlem, Stefano D'Aste and Gianni Giudici finished on the podium in the 2011 Dubai 24 Hour endurance race.
During the 2011 Geneva motor show, Lotus announced the Evora enduro GT concept, as a follow up to the Type 124 and GT4 race cars. Lotus is aiming for this car to enter into the GT3 category by Mid-2011, with a 444 bhp Toyota supplied V8.
Lotus entered two Evoras at the 2011 24 Hours of Le Mans, which were run by the Jetalliance Racing team. Despite overheating issues during practice and qualifying, car no.65 finished 22nd overall, completing 295 laps, whilst car no.64 retired after 126 laps.
In 2012, Jetalliance Racing failed to negotiate a deal to run the cars in Europe; instead, Alex Job Racing chose to run a GTE in the American Le Mans Series.
Lotus Evora S and the Carabinieri.
In July 2011, Lotus Cars donated two Evora S models with special equipment to the Carabinieri, the Italian gendarmerie. Lotus will take care of the maintenance of the cars and the training for the drivers.

Oil and gas basins of Kazakhstan

The oil & gas basins of Kazakhstan can be grouped into four revealed or prospective oil & gas provinces in the Republic of Kazakhstan. Exploration in those provinces in which oil and gas has already been extracted had, by 2010, led to the discovery of more than 200 oil, gas, oil-and-gas and condensate hydrocarbon accumulations. Of these, the Kashagen, the Tengiz and the Karachaganak fields can be considered giants.
Oil & gas basins of Kazakhstan.
Kazakhstan has a share in four oil & gas provinces:
1. The "Pre-Caspian Basin" lies in the western part of the country, behind the Mugodzhary mountains. The geology of this province is made up of Paleozoic sediments covering a Proterozoic basement.
2. The "Mangistau-Usturt Basin" lies in the Mangistau and Aktyubinsk areas of Kazakhstan.
3. The "Central Kazakhstan Basin" lies in the eastern and southern areas of Kazakhstan.
4. The "Western Siberian Basin" is in the northern and northeastern region of Kazakhstan, north of the Kokshetauskikh mountains. The geology is of a platform type, with a Mesozoic cover overlying a Paleozoic basement.

Walls of Padua

The Walls of Padua (Italian: "cinta muraria di Padova") are a complex of defensive works around the Italian city of Padua, designed to defend it from hostile attack. It was built in 4 phases.
Phases.
Roman.
Of the walls built during the ancient Roman era, the only traces to survive are those incorporated into the foundations of certain palazzi. The route of this wall corresponded to a meander of the river Medoacus (now the Brenta River) in which developed Padua's first urban centre.
13th century.
The "Mura Duecentesche" ("13th century walls"; also known as the "mura comunali" or "mura medievali") were built at the start of the 13th century by the Comune of Padua. Their route was delimited by the two branches of the Bacchiglione, the Tronco Maestro and the Naviglio Interno, which came to be used as defensive ditches. There are several remains of them around the Castello and near Porta Molino. More minor remains are to be found in the Riviera Tito Livio and Riviera Albertino Mussato; the only gates to remain from this wall are the main north gate, Porta Molino (or Molini, after several mills in the area which functioned up to the early 20th century), and the main west gate, Porta Altinate (named after the road to Altino which began here). 
The Porta Molino's upper stories were used at the end of the 19th century as a reservoir the town's first drinking water system, though tales of the tower being used as an observatory by Galileo Galilei during his time in the city are probably false. The Porta Altinate fronted onto the Naviglio Interno, crossed by an ancient Roman three-arch bridge (the Naviglio and the bridge were buried in the 1960s), and in 1256 this gate was stormed and destroyed by crusaders fighting against Ezzelino da Romano (as recorded in an inscription recorded by Carlo Leoni). It was rebuilt in 1286.
14th century.
The "Mura Carraresi" ("Carraresi's Walls") were built by the Carraresi in the 14th century and followed a route which corresponds almost entirely to that of the later 16th century wall. Almost nothing remains of them, since they were demolished during the War of the League of Cambrai to create the Renaissance wall - some sections can be seen in via delle Dimesse, near the Prato della Valle.
16th century.
The "Mura Cinquecentesche" ("16th century Walls"; also known as the "Mura rinascimentali" or "Mura Veneziane") were built by the Venetian Republic during the first decades of the 16th century as a project of the condottiero Bartolomeo d'Alviano. They were protected on its west flank by a canal known as the "fossa Bastioni", which still exists. They survive to this day, almost entirely unbroken apart from sections demolished in the 1960s to build the new Ospedale Civile. Nearly all the walls' gates survive, including 
Later use of the walls.
Recent discussions about the city walls have discussed creating a green ring around them, a green lung as envisioned by the town planner Luigi Piccinato, though recent works seem to be moving in the opposite direction (including the controversial monument "Memory and Light" by the architect Daniel Libeskind in the golena of the Porte Contarine).

99 Cent II Diptychon

The artwork 99 Cent II Diptychon from 2001 is a two-part photograph made by Andreas Gursky probably in 1999, as the work is sometimes called "99 cent.1999".
The work depicts an interior of a supermarket with numerous aisles depicting goods resulting in a colorful work. The work is digitally altered to reduce perspective. The photograph is a chromogenic color print or c-print. It is a two-part work, also called a diptych. There were 6 sets made and mounted on acrylic glass.
The photographs have a size of .
Record sale prices.
The work became famous as being the most expensive photograph in the world when it was auctioned at Sotheby's on February 7 in 2007 for a price of US$3.34 million. Another auction in New York in May 2006 fetched $2.25 million for a second print, and a third print sold for $2.48 million in November 2006 at a New York gallery. These would be the fourth and sixth-most costly photographs sold, as of 2011. On May 12, 2011 Cindy Sherman's "Untitled #96" from 1981 was sold for $3.89 million.

T Jones was a German artist born in Munich, Germany and migrated shortly to England during World War II. Several pieces of art were displayed in the House of German Art in Munich, Germany during Hitler's Third Reich. After the war a great effort was exerted to return art pieces to the original owners. What was discovered in 1946 was T Jones had a sister living in Garmish, Germany who said he recently fled to the United States in fear of being a Nazi supporter. She said very little about her brother except, " He was a fine Painter". Today, his paintings are sought after for Nazi Relics.

Once Brewed

Once Brewed (also known as Twice Brewed or Once Brewed/Twice Brewed) is a village in Northumberland, England. It lies on the Military Road (Northumberland) B6318. A motorist arriving over the B6138 from the east will see the place name shield "Once Brewed", while those coming from the west will read "Twice Brewed".
Name.
According to a sign in the Once Brewed Youth Hostel, there first was a Twice Brewed Inn, and the youth hostel was therefore called "Once Brewed".
Location.
The village consists of the Twice Brewed inn, a YHA youth hostel and a visitor centre to the Northumberland National Park, and also some farms. One of the farms is a bit further away, and is called "West Twice Brewed" on the Ordnance Survey maps.
Both the Twice Brewed Inn and the youth hostel are popular sleeping places for walkers on the Hadrian's Wall Path and the Pennine Way.
Twice Brewed Inn.
There are several stories which explain the name of the inn. The most romantic story has it that on the eve of the Battle of Hexham in 1464, Yorkist foot soldiers demanded their beer be brewed again because it lacked its usual fighting strength. The ploy worked as the Lancastrian army fled after an early morning raid. A more prosaic explanation is that 18th-century farmers tended to brew (and serve) weak ale, and hence "twice brewed" meant the inn offered stronger ale. A third theory is that Hadrian's Wall snakes its way across the brows, or "brews", of two hills where there is also a meeting of a pair of drovers’ roads.
The antiquarian William Hutton walked the length of Hadrian's Wall in 1801 and stayed one night at the Twice Brewed inn. He describes how a pudding was cooked "as big as a peck measure" and "a piece of beef ... perhaps equal to half a calf." Although the inn was full the landlady was able to find him a bed for the night.

Tomasina Morosini

Tomasina Morosini (c. 1250, Venice, – 1300, Óbuda), Princess of Slavonia, was a member of the prominent Venetian Morosini family. Her son was Andrew III, the Venetian King of Hungary.
Life.
She was the daughter of Michele Sbarra Morosini, Patrician of Venice. In 1263 she married Stephen the Posthumous, Prince of Hungary in Venice where he was living in exile. His paternity was disputed by his brothers born from their father's earlier marriage and he was not recognized as heir presumptive to the Hungarian throne. Tomasina gave birth to a son, Andrew III, King of Hungary (ruled 1290-1301), who was named after his grandfather, Andrew II. She supported her son's claim to the Hungarian throne. After the death of King Ladislaus IV, Prince Andrew succeeded to gain the kingdom and he was crowned King of Hungary in the name of Andrew III in 1290. He summoned his mother to Hungary and appointed her Princess of Slavonia.
Allegedly she was poisoned in 1300, shortly before her son's death on 14 January 1301 which was also rumoured to have been caused by poisoning. He was the last king of the House of Arpad.

Caerleon railway station is a former station serving Caerleon on the east side of the city of Newport. 
History.
The station was opened by the Pontypool, Caerleon and Newport Railway on 21 December 1874. This came after the absorption of the Pontypool company by the Great Western Railway. The station closed to passengers on 30 April 1962 and to all traffic on 29 November 1965. 
Proposed reopening.
The Newport City Council unitary development plan and Sewta rail strategy set out plans for the station to be re-opened, but these plans were shelved. A public consultation was launched in 2012 to gauge receptiveness for the new station. Work on a new station has been initially set for between 2016-2020.

Botiller v. Dominguez

Botiller v. Dominguez, 130 U.S. 238 (1889), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court dealing with the validity of Spanish or Mexican land grants in the Mexican Cession, the region of the present day southwestern United States that was ceded to the U.S. by Mexico in 1848 under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.
The action was in the nature of ejectment, brought in the Superior Court of the Los Angeles County by Dominga Dominguez against Brigido Botiller and others, to recover possession of a tract of land situated in said county, known as 'Rancho Las Virgenes'. The title of the plaintiff was a grant claimed to have been made by the government of Mexico to Nemecio Dominguez and Domingo Carrillo, on October 1, 1834, but no claim under this grant had ever been presented for confirmation to the board of land commissioners, appointed under the California Land Act of 1851 (9 St. 631,) 'to ascertain and settle the private land claims in the state of California,' and no patent had ever issued from the United States to any one for the land, or for any part of it.
The Court held that no title to land in California dependent upon Spanish or Mexican land grants can be of any validity unless presented to and confirmed by the board of land commissioners within the time prescribed by the United States Congress.

Kip (artistic gymnastics)

In artistic gymnastics, a kip is a basic skill on the women's uneven bars. It is also performed on the men's high bar, parallel bars and still rings. 
The kip is an important skill that is used as both a mount and an element or connecting skill in a bar routine. The kip allows the gymnast to swing below the bar to arrive in a front support on the bar. From the front support, the gymnast may then perform any number of skills. The glide kip is the most commonly used mount on the women's uneven bars. 
The kip has been used since the early days of modern gymnastics. Currently, in the USA, the kip first appears in the women's USAG Level 5. Previously, USAG Level 4 also included a glide kip. According to a recent (October '09) survey sent out to USAG Professional Members, the glide kip may again be introduced in the level 4 routine starting in 2013.
Variations.
Variations of the kip include the long hang kip, glide kip, drop kip, kip with stoop through and kip with jump turn.

The River Gwydderig or Afon Gwydderig in Welsh is a tributary of the River Bran (Welsh: Afon Brân). It rises as the Nant Gwydderig on the southern slopes of Mynydd Bwlch-y-groes, about North of the small village of Llywel, Powys. The A40 runs next to the river from Llywel as far as Llandovery, Carmarthenshire.
The Gwydderig crosses the boundary between Powys and Carmarthenshire at the village of Halfway. It joins the Brân in Llandovery, Carmarthenshire, about upstream of the confluence of the Brân with the River Towy. The Gwydderig therefore forms part of the Towy's catchment basin and drains into the Bristol Channel at the Towy estuary.

<doc id="18539449" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18539449" title="ThefucKINGFUCKS">
ThefucKINGFUCKS

thefucKINGFUCKS is an underground Belgium industrial rock performance art group that began as a musical side-project for controversial visual artist Kendell Geers, Patrick Codenys of Front 242. From 2007 they collaborated with Choreographer / Performer Ilse Ghekiere from Charleroi Danses. but Ghekiere left in 2009 to pursue her solo career. The group was launched in April 2003 at the Pompidou Centre in Paris with a concert called "Prototype" under the name "Red Sniper". Since then, the group have performed in music festivals like Elektra Festival Electronic Festival in Montreal Canada, a concert called "10 Guests" curated by Revolting Cocks founding member Luc Van Acker, "Guided by Heroes" curated by Fashion Designer Raf Simons for Z33 in Hasselt and the Techno Music Festival 10DAYSOFF in Gent. Bootleg recordings of this concert are available for download on pirate torrent sites.
Background.
thefucKINGFUCKS are an Open source Artist collective strongly influenced by the ideas and theories of the Acéphale group of Georges Bataille from the 1930s. The collective functions within a more experimental based esoteric research group and an exoteric Performance Art and music group. Secretive research into the history and nature of rituals, rites, initiation, sacred sexuality and Magick is then translated into the public, more popular languages of performance, art, music, dance or installation. Following the Acéphale model, there is a complete rejection of any form of social and political hierarchy and the group opposes any authoritarian form of leadership in terms of both their structure and their production. The operative members change even though the core has remained fixed since its inception in 2003. The group rejects the divisions that exist today between the different art forms and instead insist on working simultaneously in the worlds of dance, music and the visual arts. Frequently the collective presents their Performances or actions alongside their official more famous productions. For instance 
"PostPunkPaganPop" was the title of a solo exhibition by Kendell Geers at the Depuryluxemburg Gallery in Zurich in June 2008. At the opening he presented a performance with the same name as "thefucKINFUCKS" It was also the title for a performance by thefucKINGFUCKS presented at the Cimatics V.J. Festival in Brussels in 2007 and the S.M.A.K. Museum in Gent 
Name.
The group decided on the name thefucKINGFUCKS since the word FUCK remains forbidden on most television channels and especially on MTV, to which the group is generally opposed. They selected the name "thefucKINGFUCKS" (a line in the David Lynch film Blue Velvet ) in order to preclude assimilation into mainstream media.
PostPunkPaganPop.
The term "PostPunkPaganPop" has been used by Geers to describe both his own work and that of thefucKINGFUCKS. Post-punk defines an attitude as a musical genre, whereas pagan defines the groups interest in rites, rituals and the question of faith. The public face of the group maintains the Pop centred style of music that Codenys became famous for in the 1980s.
LostLustLast.
On the 26 June 2008 Kendell Geers and Ilse Ghekiere presented their collaborative work in an installation at the Royal Monceau "Demolition Party" in Paris. The installation called "LostLustLast" was "an orgy of ink that resembled the scene of a crime of passion" The pair worked in situ for a week, using the body to imprint images upon the walls, floor and bed.
Body Sound Image.
The performances are an audio-visual-sensory-experience. In the 1980s Patrick Codenys used the terms Electronic body music to describe the music of Front 242. A generation later Kendell Geers defines his art as a "Panaesthetik", a term that attempts to describe an all-encompassing notion of aesthetics. Together with Ilse Ghekiere, their performances are sensory overload in which the senses of hearing, seeing, smalling, even touching are all pushed to their limits. The razorblade installations of Geers are the backdrop to the grinding electronic body music rhythms and beats of Codenys and the erotic female body in trance of Ghekiere is the key to unlocking the mystery. As a reflection of their interest in the dark arts, the sounds tend to hang in the extreme low sub base area and heard in the pit of your stomach more than the ears.
Multiple Identities.
Since 2004 thefucKINFUCKS have performed under the names "Red Sniper, Head Sniper, Firewire, Akephale, Kissing Kousins, USB2, PostPunkPaganPop, S338 and Suite 338. The number 338 is frequently used by the group as a reference to the group Front 242 because United Nations Resolution 338 is the annex to Resolution 242.

John Brodie (footballer born 1862)

John Brant Brodie (30 August 1862 – 16 February 1925) was an English footballer who was a pivotal figure in the formative years of Wolverhampton Wanderers.
Brodie attended St Luke's School in Blakenhall, and was a founding figure of the football club that became Wolverhampton Wanderers. He played in the club's first-ever FA Cup tie in 1883, scoring twice in a 4-1 win over Long Eaton Rangers, and first-ever Football League match in September 1888. He also captained the team in the 1889 FA Cup Final, where they lost 0-3 to league champions Preston North End.
Brodie won three England caps, making his debut on 2 March 1889, when he scored - as captain - in a 6-1 win over Ireland at Anfield. His other appearances were against Scotland and, again, Ireland.
He retired from playing in 1891 due to a knee injury and became headmaster of a Wolverhampton school. He later returned to Wolves as a director.

Halifax, West Yorkshire

Halifax is a Minster town, within the Metropolitan Borough of Calderdale in West Yorkshire, England. It has an urban area population of 82,056 in the 2001 Census. It is well known as a centre of England's woollen manufacture from the 15th century onward, originally dealing through the Halifax Piece Hall. Halifax is known for its Mackintosh chocolate and toffee (now owned by Nestlé), the Halifax bank (formerly Halifax Building Society), and the nearby Shibden Hall.
Name.
The name is first recorded in about 1091 in the form "Halyfax", possibly from the Old English "halh-gefeaxe", meaning "area of coarse grass in the nook of land". This explanation is now preferred to derivations from the Old English "halig" (holy), for example "hālig feax" (holy hair), first proposed by 16th century antiquarians. The incorrect interpretation gave rise to two local legends. One concerned a maiden killed by a lustful priest whose advances she spurned. Another held that the head of John the Baptist was buried here after his execution. The legend is almost certainly medieval rather than ancient, though the town's coat of arms still carries an image of the saint. Another explanation for the name is a corruption of the Old English words Hay and Ley, 'hay' and 'clearing' or 'meadow'. This etymology is based on the presence of Haley Hill, the nearby hamlet of Healey (another corruption), and the common occurrence of the surnames Hayley/Haley around Halifax. The erroneous derivation from "halig" has also given rise to the demonym Haligonian, which is of recent origin and not in universal use.
The Earldom of Halifax took the name of the town. The first creation, in the Peerage of England in 1677, was for William Savile, 1st Viscount Halifax. He had already been made Baron Savile of Eland and Viscount Halifax in 1668 and was later made Marquess of Halifax (this creation of the earldom became extinct in 1700; see Marquess of Halifax for more information). George Montagu-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax, (2nd order of the 3rd creation) became the President of the Board of Trade in 1748. In 1749 he helped to found the town (later city) of Halifax, the capital of Nova Scotia, Canada which was named after him. He helped foster trade, especially with North America. The Halifax River in Central Florida, United States, was named after him.
History.
Halifax is not mentioned in the Domesday Book, and evidence of the early settlement of the town is sketchy. However, by the 12th century the township had become the religious centre of the vast parish of Halifax, which extended from Brighouse in the east to Heptonstall in the west. Halifax Minster, parts of which go back to the 12th century, has always been dedicated to St John the Baptist. The Minster's first organist, in 1766, was William Herschel, who went on to discover the planet Uranus. The coat of arms of Halifax include the chequers from the original coat of arms of the Earls Warenne, who held the town during Norman times.
Halifax was notorious for the Halifax Gibbet, an early form of guillotine used to execute criminals by decapitation, last used in 1650. A replica of the gibbet has been erected on the original site in Gibbet Street. The original gibbet blade is on display at Bankfield Museum, Halifax. Punishment in Halifax was notoriously harsh, as remembered in the "Beggar's Litany" by John Taylor (1580–1654), a prayer whose text included "From Hull, from Halifax, from Hell, ‘tis thus, From all these three, Good Lord deliver us.".
The town's 19th-century wealth came from the cotton, wool and carpet industries and like most other Yorkshire towns had a large number of weaving mills many of which have been lost or converted to alternate use.
In November 1938, in an incident of mass hysteria, many in Halifax believed a serial killer—The Halifax Slasher—was on the loose. Scotland Yard was called in, but they concluded there were no "Slasher" attacks after several locals came forward and admitted they had inflicted the wounds upon themselves.
Halifax has given its name to a bank, Halifax plc which started as a building society in the town. Nowadays Halifax is a trading name of HBOS, as part of the Lloyds Banking Group. Halifax is a twin town with Aachen in Germany. The A58 has a stretch called Aachen Way, with a plaque on the town-bound side of the road.
Halifax has benefited from Single Regeneration Budget, European URBAN II and the Home Office’s Community Cohesion Fund money through Action Halifax who have a vision for "a prosperous, vibrant and safe centre where all sections of the community can access opportunities to enhance their quality of life."
Governance.
The ancient parish of Halifax was divided in the 19th century into a large number of civil parishes. In Halifax itself, a body of improvement commissioners or town trustees was created between 1762 and 1823, and the town became a borough constituency under the Great Reform Act of 1832. Halifax was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1848 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, and with the passing of the Local Government Act 1888 became a County Borough in 1889. Since 1974, Halifax has been the administrative centre of the Metropolitan Borough of Calderdale, once a part of the now-former metropolitan county of West Yorkshire.
Geography.
Topographically, Halifax is located in the south-eastern corner of the moorland region called the South Pennines. Halifax is situated about from the M62 motorway close to Bradford, Huddersfield and Rochdale. The Tees-Exe line passes through the A641 road, which links nearby Brighouse with Bradford and Huddersfield, The town lies from Kingston upon Hull and Liverpool, and about from the cities of London, Edinburgh, Belfast, Dublin and Cardiff as the crow flies. The major waterway is the Hebble Brook. The River Calder into which the Hebble joins it at Salterhebble bypasses the town and nearby Huddersfield.
Demographics.
, Calderdale had a population of 192,405, of which 82,500 live in the Halifax urban area. The main ethnic group in Halifax is White (87%), followed by Pakistani (10%). Over 90% of people aged 16–74 were employed, mostly full-time. 64% of residents had qualifications.
Halifax is home to a large South Asian community mainly of British Pakistanis from the Kashmir region. The majority of the community lives in the west central Halifax region of the town, which was previously home to immigrant Irish communities who have since moved to the outer suburbs. The Illingworth / Mixenden areas, in contrast to west central Halifax's ethnic diversity, consists mostly of white, indigenous Protestant residents. In the 2001 census, 5% stated they were Muslim, 16.3% of no religion, and 63.8% of Christian background. 12.8% did not disclose their religion. The population density of the Halifax urban area is 530/km2.
Economy.
As well as the significance of the bank Halifax plc which, since 2008, is part of the Lloyds Banking Group, the town has strong associations with confectionery.
John Mackintosh and his wife, Violet, opened a toffee shop in King Cross Lane in 1890. Violet formulated the toffee's recipe. John became known as "The Toffee King". A factory was opened on Queens Road in 1898. A new factory at Albion Mill, at the current site near the railway station, opened in 1909. John died in 1920, and his son Harold not only continued the business but took it to the present size and range of confectionery it has today. Their famous brands, including Rolo, Toffee Crisp and Quality Street of chocolate and confectionery are not just popular in the UK, but around the world including the USA.
In 1969 John Mackintosh & Co Limited merged with the York-based Rowntree Limited to form Rowntree Mackintosh. This was, in turn, purchased by Nestlé in 1988.
Halifax was a busy industrial town, dealing in and producing wool, carpets, machine tools, and beer. The Crossley family began carpet manufacture in modest premises at Dean Clough, on the banks of the Hebble Brook. The family was philanthropic and Joseph and Sir Francis Crossley built and endowed almshouses for their workers, which exist to this day and are run by volunteer trustees. Halifax is also home to Suma Wholefoods, which was established in 1975 and is the largest workers' co-operative in the UK.
Transport.
Public bus and train transportation in Halifax is managed and subsidised by the West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive. It was announced in January 2009 that Halifax was to have a direct rail link to London after a long campaign backed by many, including the local paper the "Courier"; the service began to run on 23 May 2010.
Bus.
Most of the bus services in Halifax operate from the town's bus station. Unlike many other bus stations, Halifax is noted for having much character, with many listed buildings being incorporated on the site. First Calderdale & Huddersfield operate most of the town's services, while Yorkshire Tiger operate many of the south Calderdale services. Arriva Yorkshire operate services that link Halifax with the West Yorkshire towns and cities of Dewsbury and Wakefield. First operate bus services from Halifax to the town of Huddersfield and the nearby cities of Bradford and Leeds. First also run services into other counties, Rochdale in Greater Manchester and Burnley in Lancashire. Other bus operators in the town include T.J. Walsh (also known as The Halifax Bus Company) and Halifax Joint Committee which use the livery of the old Halifax Corporation buses, used on the town's buses until 1974.
Rail.
Halifax railway station is on the Caldervale Line, with services to Manchester Victoria, York, Selby via Bradford and Leeds; Blackpool North; via Brighouse to Huddersfield and Wakefield Westgate and to London Kings Cross via Wakefield Kirkgate. All but the London service are operated by Northern Rail.
Rail passenger representation is organised by the local users' group, the Halifax and District Rail Action Group (HADRAG).
The rail line leading from Halifax due north towards Keighley (and thus towards Skipton, Morecambe and Carlisle) with a further branch to Bradford via Queensbury saw its last through services in May 1955, although parts of the route, which was extremely heavily engineered with long tunnels and high, spectacular, viaducts, have now been repaired and revived by Sustrans as a walking and cycle route.
Media.
Calderdale's local radio station, Phoenix Radio 96.7 FM has its studios in Halifax, and the "Evening Courier", Calderdale's local newspaper, has its offices in the town.
Education.
The Halifax area is home to two selective state schools, which are The Crossley Heath School in Savile Park and North Halifax Grammar School in Illingworth. Both schools achieve excellent GCSE and A-level results with both schools achieving a large proportion of A* to C grades at GCSE level. In 2005, the Crossley Heath School was the highest ranking co-educational school in the North of England.
The Crossley Heath School was formed when two schools merged. The original schools were: Heath Grammar School, an all-boys school and given its charter by Elizabeth I of England, and The Crossley and Porter School, a mixed school founded with his brothers by Sir Francis Crossley, 1st Baronet which started as an orphanage. They were combined in 1985. There are other schools in the area, including the Trinity Academy (formerly Holy Trinity Church of England Senior School), which became an academy in 2010, and St Catherine's Catholic High School, both of which are located in Holmfield. St Catherine's, is designated a Specialist Technology College. In July 2013 St Catherine's closed leaving Trinity Academy the only non selective school in the area.
Calderdale College is the local further education college on Francis Street, just off King Cross Road, in the west of the town. In December 2006 it was announced that Calderdale College, in partnership with Leeds Metropolitan University, opened a new higher education institution in January 2007 called 'University Centre Calderdale'.
Culture.
The 3rd Battalion Yorkshire Regiment (Duke of Wellington's) formerly the Duke of Wellington's Regiment (West Riding) Halifax Area Headquarters is based at Wellesley Park, on the junction of Gibbet Street and Spring Hall Road, in the former Wellesley Barracks Museum and Education Centre building. The Regimental Museum has been re-located within the Bankfield House Textile Museum on Haley Hill. The former barracks was converted into an educational school in 2005.
Former regimental colours of the 'Duke's' are laid up in the Halifax Minster. These include the stand used by the 33rd Regiment between 1761 and 1771, which is one of the oldest in existence in England, plus those carried by the regiment during the Battle of Waterloo and the Crimea. The 1981 stand of colours, was taken out of service in 2002. They were marched through the town from the town hall to the Minster, which at that time was still a Parish Church, accompanied by two escorts of 40 troops, the Regimental Drums and the Heavy Cavalry and Cambrai Band on Sunday 31 March 2007. The troops were then inspected by The Lord Lieutenant of West Yorkshire, Dr Ingrid Roscoe BA, PhD, FSA and the Mayor of Halifax Cllr Colin Stout making a total of eight stands of colours within the Regimental Chapel. The regiment was presented with the "Freedom of Halifax" on 18 June 1945.
Eureka! The National Children's Museum was inspired and opened by Prince Charles in the summer of 1992 and is located in part of the railway station. Once the home of the diarist Anne Lister, Shibden Hall is located just outside Halifax in the neighbouring Shibden Valley. Dean Clough, a refurbished worsted spinning mill, is the home of Barrie Rutter's Northern Broadsides Theatre Company and the IOU theatre company as well as providing space for eight art galleries.
Halifax, and in particular the Victoria Theatre (originally the Victoria Hall) is home to the oldest continually running amateur choral society in the country and possibly the world. Halifax Choral Society was founded in 1817 and has an unbroken record of performances. The Choral Society has a strong rivalry with the equally eminent nearby Huddersfield Choral Society. The Victoria Theatre contains a large concert organ built by William Hill & Sons that was installed in 1901. During the 1960s, when the hall was converted into the theatre, The organ was re-located to the back of the stage. The original console was replaced with a Rushworth and Dreaper unit, which consists of three manuals and a 32 note pedal board. A complete rewiring of the organ to add a second touch facility and a hydraulic lift was carried out, so that it could be lowered and stored under the stage. The organ was rarely used, being played for a few orchestras and the choral society's Messiah. But the instrument is still playable and is occasionally used for private practice.
There is plenty to occupy lovers of amateur theatre. Halifax Thespians and the Actors' Workshop present plays of all kinds, and musical theatre is represented by Halifax Amateur Operatic Society, Halifax Light Opera Society, Halifax Gilbert and Sullivan Society, and All Souls Amateur Operatic Society. Halifax YMCA Pantomime Society presents its annual show in late January each year. Young people interested in drama are catered for by Halifax AOS and Halifax LOS, which each have a junior section, and another group, Stagedoor Theatre Co, specialises in dramatic activities and performances by children and young people. The Halifax & District Organists' Association, is one of the oldest organists' fellowships in the country.
As well as conventional cultural attractions, the Calderdale area has also become a centre for folk and traditional music. The Traditions Festival, held at the Halifax Piece Hall in the town centre, is a celebration of traditional music and dance from around the world, whilst the Rushbearing, held in Sowerby Bridge and the surrounding villages, is a traditional festival which was restarted to celebrate the Queen's Silver Jubilee and attracts Morris dancers from all around the country. The Square Chapel Centre for the Arts offers music, dance, plays, comedy as well as community events such as tea dances. The Victoria Theatre seats 1,568 people or 1,860 for a standing concert, and hosts a variety of performances.
Halifax town centre has a busy night life with a variety of clubs and bars. To help with those who become vulnerable whilst enjoying and using Halifax's night life, Street Angels was launched in November 2005. Street Angels patrol the town centre on Fridays and Saturdays between 9 p.m. and 3 a.m.. In the first year police reported that violent crime had fallen by 42%. Street Angels work in partnership with St. John Ambulance, Nightlife Marshals, Police Community Support Officers, Police and door-staff as well as the Halifax Ambassadors who patrol in the daytime.
Halifax had one of the highest densities of pubs to inhabitants during a study that took place in the late 1990s. One such establishment that gained notoriety during November 2005 was the Zoo Bar. The nightclub had a history of under-age drinking, and became the first establishment in the UK to be closed because of the Licensing Act 2003. At the time of the police intervention officers reportedly identified 420 of the 500 people in the club to be under-age drinkers. The nightclub was identified in an American study regarding youths and alcohol and gained European notoriety. The nightclub was subsequently closed and sold to developers to renovate into flats. A recent report showed Halifax to have above average levels of drink-related violence and associated issues.
Sport.
The town has relatively successful sport clubs. Its rugby league club, Halifax RLFC, plays in Co-operative Championship. The town's football team, F.C. Halifax Town participates in the Conference National, the fifth tier of English football.
Halifax is one of the most historic rugby league clubs in the game, formed over a century ago, in 1873. Known as 'Fax', the official club colours are blue and white hoops, hence the former 1990s nickname: The Blue Sox. Halifax are also one of the original twenty-two rugby clubs that formed the Northern Rugby Football Union in 1895, making them one of the world's first rugby league clubs. They have rivalries with local neighbours Bradford and Huddersfield. Halifax have won the Rugby Football League Championship on four occasions: in 1902–03, 1906–07, 1964–65, 1985–86 and the Challenge Cup five times: in 1903, 1904, 1931, 1939 and 1987. They won the Co-operative Championship Grand Final in 2010. Halifax played at the Thrum Hall ground from 1886 to 1998. The ground staged rugby for 112 years and closed its gates for the last time after Halifax had won what was misleadingly billed as a friendly against Leeds 35–28.
Since then both teams share the Shay football ground, which is the largest ground used by a non-league football club in England. In the 1960s Halifax Town played Millwall in a Fourth Division match that had the lowest attendance ever recorded for a professional match in England. The Crossley Heath Grammar School normally excels in nationwide school rugby union competitions.
Motorcycle speedway racing has been staged at two venues in Halifax. In the pioneering days of 1928–1930 a track operated at Thrum Hall. A Halifax team took part in the English Dirt Track League of 1929. Speedway returned to Halifax at the Shay Stadium in 1949 and operated until 1951. The team operated as the Halifax Nomads in 1948 racing three away fixtures. The Halifax Dukes, the name they took once the Shay was opened, operated in the National League Third Division in 1949 before moving up to the Second Division in 1950. Riders including Arthur Forrest, moved on to Bradford. The Dukes re-emerged in 1965 as founder members of the British League and operated there for many years before the team moved en bloc to Odsal Stadium, Bradford. The steeply banked bends of the track at the Shay have been buried under stands at either end when the spectator facilities were squared off.
Religious buildings.
The 15th century Minster dedicated to St. John the Baptist did not achieve cathedral status when a new diocese was being considered for the West Riding (Wakefield Parish Church became the cathedral in 1888 and was extensively altered and enlarged). Minster Status was conferred on the Parish Church in a ceremony on 22 November 2009. There is a collection of rare Commonwealth white glass as well as a series of Victorian windows. Another feature is the complete array of Jacobean box pews. The pair of Gothic organ cases by John Oldrid Scott now house the four-manual instrument by Harrison & Harrison. The belfry holds fourteen bells and an Angelus.
The Serbian Orthodox Church dedicated to St. John the Baptist, in the Boothtown area, formerly the Mount Carmel Methodist Chapel, was acquired in 1956 and after extensive refurbishment was opened in the early part of the 1960s by the town's Serbian community.
The currently mothballed mid-Victorian All Souls Church by Sir George Gilbert Scott standing part way up Haley Hill to the north of the main town centre is now vested in the Historic Churches Preservation Trust. Its lofty spire and white magnesian limestone exterior stand as a very personal statement in 13th-century French style of the mill owner Colonel Edward Akroyd, who paid solely for its construction as the centre-piece of a purpose-built model village ("Akroydon"). All Souls' boasts an unusually complete sequence of windows by the leading artists of the 1850s, including William Wailes, John Hardman and Clayton & Bell. The large organ by Forster & Andrews inserted in 1868, ten years after the building was completed, is currently unplayable and many of its surviving parts are in storage awaiting restoration. The tower houses a ring of eight bells.
Other churches include the Georgian Holy Trinity Church (now converted to office use) and the late neo-Gothic (1911) St. Paul's, King Cross, by Sir Charles Nicholson. St Paul's is notable not only for its fine acoustics but also for an unusual and highly colourful west window, specified by Nicholson, showing the apocalyptic vision of the Holy City descending upon the smoky mills and railway viaducts of Halifax as it was before the First World War.
The spire of the Square Church, not far from the Minster at the bottom of the town, paid for by the carpet manufacturing Crossley family, is all that remains of the Gothic Congregational church built by Joseph James in 1856–58 as a rival design to All Souls', Haley Hill. The building was closed in 1969 and arsonists caused severe damage to the building two years later leading to its partial demolition. The rather comic story of the rival spires runs that the two buildings' towers were nearing completion simultaneously; the architects were ordered to stop work within a few feet of the top of the spires to see who would finish first. After some time, the Crossleys lost patience and finished their spire at , prompting the immediate completion of the rival building one foot higher. The neighbouring and earlier (Georgian) Square Chapel (1772) survived a hundred years of use as a church hall and Sunday School for the larger church: it is currently an arts centre.
There are four Mosques in Halifax, the main ones being Madni Jamia Mosque on Gibbet Street, and Al Jamia Al Zahra which is co-located with: Zahra Educational and Cultural Centre, on Francis Street.

Porta Asinaria

The Porta Asinaria is a gate in the Aurelian Walls of Rome. Dominated by two protruding tower blocks and associated guard rooms, it was built between 270 and 273, at the same time as the Wall itself. It is through this gate that East Roman troops under General Belisarius entered the city in 536, reclaiming the city for the Byzantine Empire from the Ostrogoths.
By the 16th century it had become overwhelmed by traffic. A new breach in the walls was made nearby to create the Porta San Giovanni. At this point, the Porta Asinaria was closed to traffic.

Via Campana

The Via Campana (Italian - "Via Antica Consolare campana") was one of the main roads of the Roman Empire. It begins at the Flavian Amphitheatre at Pozzuoli and ran through several ancient craters, passing the town of Qualiano and ending at a junction with the via Appia at the town of Giugliano. 
Four kilometres from Pozzuoli it crosses the craters of the Quarto Flegreo that give their name to the nearby town of Quarto and cross through the Montagna Spaccata, literally a cut through the wall of the crater made by the Romans to allow the road to cross to the opposite side of the crater (where the road climbs along the slopes instead). The Montagna Spaccata passage is now perfectly preserved and used as the main road in and out of the town. The bricks put in by the Romans to prevent the crater wall from collapsing can still be seen in excellent states of preservation all along the passage. Various Roman catacombs and necropolises can also be seen along the route.

Via Asinaria

The Via Asinaria was an ancient Roman road starting at the Porta Asinaria in the Aurelian Wall. It could be accessed from the via Latina, and Belisarius diverged from the via Latina in his advance on Rome so that he would enter the city through the Porta Asinaria (Not. app.; Procop. BG I.14.14). It is also mentioned by Festus 282 "retricibus: aqua eo nomine quae est supra viam Ardeatinam inter lapidem secundum et tertium, qua inrigantur horti infra viam Ardeatinam et Asinariam usque ad Latinam", showing it must have run towards the via Appia and the via Ardeatina. Its course is debated, but probably the initial section of the modern Via Appia Nuova probably coincides with it (Bull. d. Inst. 1861, 72; RE II.1581; T. II.28‑33; PBS IV.42‑45). The via Tusculana splits off from it about 400 metres from the gate (PBS IV.51 sqq.).

Beach volleyball at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Women's tournament

The women's beach volleyball tournament at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing was held from
August 9 to August 21, at the Beach Volleyball Ground at Chaoyang Park.
Each of the 24 pairs in the tournament was placed in one of six groups of four teams apiece, and played a round-robin within that pool. The top two teams in each pool advanced to the Round of 16. The six third-place teams were ranked against each other, with ties being broken by the ratio of points won to lost. The best two advanced to the Round of 16, while the other four played two matches (#3 vs. #6 and #4 vs. #5) with the winners of those two matches advancing as well. The losers of those matches, along with the fourth-place teams in each group, were eliminated.
The 16 teams that advanced to the elimination rounds played a single-elimination tournament with a bronze medal match between the semifinal losers.
Qualification.
The top eight finishes that a team has from January 1, 2007 to July 20, 2008, on the Swatch FIVB World Tour (2007 and 2008), SWATCH FIVB World Championships (2007) and on FIVB recognised Continental Championship Finals, counts towards Olympic qualification for the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games.
There are 24 teams competing at the Olympic Games, with a maximum of two teams per country.
The USA had four teams in the top 8 of the FIVB Beach Volleyball Olympic Ranking, Brazil had seven teams in the top 24, but only two teams from each country can participate in the Olympic Games. Also, China had three teams and Germany had four teams in the top 24 ranking before the Games.
Qualifiers.
The official cut off date for Olympic qualification for beach volleyball was July 20, 2008. The final Olympic Qualification Ranking for the 24 teams, was announced confirmed by the FIVB on July 24, 2008.
1 Juliana Felisberta is replaced by Ana Paula Connelly on the Brazilian team, because of an injury to Juliana.
2 Austrian team Montagnolli - Swoboda is replaced by the Swiss team Kuhn - Schwer, because of medical reasons.
Preliminary round.
The two best teams from each group will advance to the quarterfinal round.
The composition of the preliminary rounds was announced confirmed on April 16, 2008.
The #1 seeded team is placed in pool A, #2 in pool B, #3 in C, #4 in D, #5 in E, and #6 in F. But if the host nation has a team in the top 6 teams, it is automatically seeded as #1. Therefore, China's team Tian Jia - Wang (ranked as #2,) is placed in pool A.
There was held a draw of lots between seed #7 - #9, between #10 - #12, between #13 - #18, and between #19 - #24. The Drawing of lots was hosted by the 1 to 1 Energy Grand Slam, in Gstaad on July 26, as part of the 2008 SWATCH FIVB Beach Volleyball World Tour.
After the preliminary rounds, from August 9–14, 2008, the teams placed 1st and 2nd in each pool have qualified for the playoffs. The two best 3rd placed teams have also qualified. Two lucky loser matches qualifies two more of the 3rd placed teams. The two 3rd placed teams that lose their lucky losers match, are out of the competition. Also out of the competition are teams placed 4th in their pool.

Playoffs.
Round of 16.
The USA, Brazil and China managed to directly qualify two teams each, for the Round of 16, through the pool play. All six teams then won their matches in the Round of 16, and qualified for the quarterfinals. Austria and Australia also won each their Round of 16 match, and took the remaining two spots in the quarterfinals.
On August 15, one of the spectators gave birth to a baby boy, in the bathroom of the Olympic beach volleyball stadium where she was watching the women's playoff. Medical workers received the message about the woman at 10:10 a.m., and the baby was already born when they arrived 4 minutes later.
Overview.
If the host nation has a team in the top 6 teams on the FIVB Olympic ranking when the Olympic Games begin, it is automatically seeded as #1. Therefore China's team Tian Jia - Wang (ranked as #2 on the Olympic ranking,) is seeded as #1.
Final ranking.
If the host nation has a team in the top 6 teams on the FIVB Olympic ranking when the Olympic Games begin, it is automatically seeded as #1. Therefore China's team Tian Jia - Wang (ranked as #2 on the FIVB Olympic ranking before the Olympic Games,) is seeded as #1.

Elsenham &amp; Thaxted Light Railway

The Elsenham & Thaxted Light Railway was a long light railway in Essex, England. The line was sanctioned in 1906, although did not finally open to traffic until 1 April 1913. It was the last rail line built in Essex until the construction of Stansted Airport railway station.
The railway left the West Anglia Main Line at Elsenham. There were two stations (Sibleys and Thaxted) and three halts on the Railway; all except Mill Road Halt (opened in 1922) were opened with the line. The line was never a commercial success, since all the stations were located at some distance from the settlements they served; Thaxted station was 0.75 miles (1.2 km) distant from the town, since to construct a crossing of the River Chelmer would have been too costly.
As a light railway it was limited to giving a journey time of 22–28 minutes. There were five down and four up trains per day on opening.
Passenger services were withdrawn from 15 September 1952 and the railway finally closed on 1 June 1953.

History.
The Northern Maori electorate boundary was in South Auckland. It extended from Auckland City north to Northland, and had only minor boundary changes from 1868 to 1996.
The first member of parliament for Northern Maori from 1868 was Frederick Nene Russell; he retired in 1870. The second member of parliament from 1871 to 1875 and in 1887 was Wi Katene.
The electorate was held by Labour from 1938. Paraire Karaka Paikea died in 1943, and was replaced by his son Tapihana Paraire Paikea.
In 1979, Matiu Rata resigned from the Labour Party as a protest against Labour policies. In 1980 he resigned from Parliament, but came second in the subsequent by-election. The by-election was won by the Labour candidate, Bruce Gregory.
Tau Henare won the electorate from Gregory for New Zealand First in 1993; a foretaste of the success of Henare and the other New Zealand First candidates (known as the "Tight Five") in the Māori electorates in 1996. In 1996 with MMP, the Northern Maori electorate was replaced by Te Tai Tokerau, and won by Henare.
Tau Henare is a great-grandson of Taurekareka Henare who had held the electorate for the Reform Party from 1914 to 1938.

Iglu &amp; Hartly

Iglu & Hartly is an American pop rock band from Los Angeles, California. The band is composed of Jarvis Anderson (vocals, keyboards), Sam Martin (vocals, keyboards), Simon Katz (guitar), Luis Rosiles (drums), and Michael Bucher (bass).
History.
Formation.
Jarvis Anderson, Sam Martin, and Simon Katz met at the University of Colorado at Boulder. Before long, the 3 of them left school and moved to Echo Park, California to pursue a career in music. Shortly after moving to Los Angeles, Luis Rosiles flew from Jarvis' hometown of Park Ridge, Illinois to join the band as their drummer, and LA local Michael Bucher joined as bassist.
Signing to Mercury Records (2008).
After two years of playing in Southern California clubs, the band started receiving strong interest from a number of major record labels in the UK, as well as getting airplay from Jim Gellatly on Xfm Scotland. The band finally decided to sign with Mercury Records, but not before releasing their debut UK single "Violent & Young" on indie label Another Music = Another Kitchen on 2 June 2008 to critical acclaim.
The band's next single "In This City" was released in September and was identified as "an anthem in the making" by an "NME" blogger. This kicked a massive tour, seeing the band play over 120 shows in a span of 150 days in 17 countries. The band also performed on "Friday Night With Jonathan Ross" on BBC One, helping "In This City" rise to number five in the UK charts, securing the band their first hit. An instrumental version of the song was also used as the theme tune for the "Match Of The Day" Goal of the Month competitions. "NME" featured the Band in over 15 different pieces prior to and after their controversial review of the album, including inviting the band to headline two dates on their NME Awards Tour. They also named them one of the "Twenty Bands Making America Cool Again." In regards to other press outlets the album and the band were a polarizing force, generating both glowing reviews and venomous criticism.
Live performances.
The band has gained quite a reputation for their live shows, playing both small venues and large festivals with equal intensity, passion and fervor. In a review of a show in St Louis on August 26, 2009, one newspaper wrote, "In their ripped jeans and tank tops, Iglu and Hartly took the stage at the Firebird around 9:45 p.m., the people there witnessed a phenomenal show." SPIN included them in their "Best of Bumbershoot Festival 2009" and called their performance "absurdly successful" The band played at The UCD Ball in Dublin in both 2009 and 2010.
Debut in the United States (2009).
On May 5, 2009 their CD "& Then Boom" was released in the United States. They performed on Last Call with Carson Daly as part of their promotional tour.
At SXSW in Austin, Iglu & Hartly's Jarvis Anderson was arrested in the early hours of March 19 after allegedly assaulting a hotel security guard while half naked.
Iglu & Hartly performed their song "DayGlo" live at BETA Records TV Studios in Hollywood, California. The acoustic song segment was taken in October 2009 for the BETA Records Music TV Series, directed by Eric MacIver and produced by Chris Honetschlaeger.
Hiatus and New Projects (2011).
It was announced by various members through their respective Twitter and Facebook pages that Iglu & Hartly is on "hiatus" with no plans for a second record. Jarvis has announced through his Twitter page that he is going "solo" and will have a record out very soon. Sam and Simon, the other founding members of the band, have started a new project called Youngblood Hawke that has released an EP and is already getting radio play in the UK. Youngblood Hawke signed with Universal Republic in early 2012 and are releasing a new EP in August 2012.

Valerio Cioli (or Cigoli or Giogoli) (1529–1599) was an Italian sculptor
Works.
His most famous work is the "Fontana del Bacchino" in the Giardino di Boboli, near the entrance to piazza Pitti in Florence. It shows a dwarf at the court of Cosimo I, ironically nicknamed "Morgante" (the giant of the poem "Morgante" by Luigi Pulci), portrayed nuded and sitting on a tortoise like a drunken Bacchus. Two more of Cioli's works (collaborations with Giovanni Simone Cioli) are to be found in the giardino di Boboli - the "Uomo che vanga" (digging man) and the "Uomo che scarica il secchio in un tino" (man emptying a bucket into a vat).
Other works of his include a "Satyr with a flask" in the Museo del Bargello and sculptures of personifications of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture on the tomb of Michelangelo Buonarroti in the basilica of Santa Croce.

Tourettes Action

Tourettes Action is a United Kingdom support and research charity for people with Tourette syndrome (TS) and their families. TS is a neurological condition characterised by tics—involuntary sounds and movements.
History.
The charity was founded as the Tourette Syndrome (UK) Association in 1980 by a small group of parents of children with TS, who came together for mutual support. In 2006, the charity relocated to London and substantially expanded its services. A windfall from Big Brother 2006 winner Pete Bennett gave the organisation the opportunity to plan for future development to reach a higher percentage of the 300,000 children and adults in the UK with TS. In June 2008 the charity adopted the name Tourettes Action, a new ID and website.
Aims and services.
According to their website, Tourettes Action's goal is to help individuals with TS receive the practical support and social acceptance they need to help them live their lives to the fullest. It also funds research into treatment and diagnosis of TS.
Tourettes Action's services include a Helpline, information packs, conferences and workshops, support groups, camps for teenagers, help finding specialists, networks among professionals, ID cards for people with a diagnosis of TS, free monthly email newsletters and an online forum.
Ruth Ojadi, organiser of the London Tourettes Action group, appeared in a BBC documentary titled "Tourettes: I Swear I Can Sing", broadcast on BBC in December 2011. The documentary follows her over a number of months as she focuses on her ability to sing and her newfound confidence.

Jong Ajax

Jong Ajax () ("English: Young Ajax"), also referred to as Ajax II or Ajax 2 are the reserve team of AFC Ajax, based in Amsterdam, and competing in the Dutch Eerste Divisie.
History.
Jong Ajax ("formerly more commonly known as Ajax 2") is the reserve team of AFC Ajax. The team is composed mostly of professional footballers, who are often recent graduates from the highest youth level (Ajax A1) serving their first professional contract as a reserve, or players who are otherwise unable to play in the first team.
Since 1992 Jong Ajax have competed in the Beloften Eredivisie, competing against other reserve teams such as Jong PSV, Jong FC Groningen or Jong AZ. They have won the Beloften Eredivisie title a record eight times, as well as the KNVB Reserve Cup three times, making them the most successful reserve squad in the Netherlands. By winning the Beloften Eredivisie title, Jong Ajax were able to qualify for the actual KNVB Cup, even advancing to the semi-finals on three occasions. Their best result in the Dutch Cup was under manager Jan Olde Riekerink in 2001-02, when a semi-final loss to FC Utrecht in a Penalty shoot-out after extra time, which saw Utrecht advance, and thus preventing an Ajax vs. Jong Ajax Dutch Cup final.
The 2013–14 season marked the Jupiler League debut of the AFC Ajax reserves' squad Jong Ajax. Previously playing in the Beloften Eredivisie (a separate league for reserve teams, not included in the Dutch professional or amateur league structure) players were allowed to move around freely between the reserve team and the first first team during the course of the season. This is no longer the case as Jong Ajax now registers and fields a separate squad from that of Ajax first team for the Eerste Divisie, the second tier of professional football in the Netherlands. Their home matches are played at Sportpark De Toekomst, except for the occasional match in the Amsterdam Arena. Now regarded a semi-professional team in their own respect, the only period in which players are able to move between squads are during the transfer windows, unless the player has made less than 15 appearances for the first team, then he is still eligible to appear in both first team and second team matches during the course of the season. Furthermore the team is not eligible for promotion to the Eredivisie or to participate in the KNVB Cup. Jong Ajax were joined in the Eerste Divisie by Jong FC Twente and Jong PSV, reserve teams who have also moved from the Beloften Eredivisie to the Eerste Divisie, in place of VV Katwijk, SC Veendam and AGOVV Apeldoorn, increasing the total amount of teams in the Jupiler League from 16 to 20.
Ajax reserve squad Jong Ajax left the Beloften Eredivisie in 2013, having held a 21 year tenure in the reserves league, having also won the league title a record eight times. (1994, 1996, 1998, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2009)

Aliquippa Station

The Aliquippa Station is a former railway station located in Aliquippa, Pennsylvania, USA. The station was constructed and used by the now defunct Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad. Constructed in 1911, the station has also gone by the name of Woodlawn Station because of the former town of Woodlawn that was merged with Aliquippa in the late 1870s. After the station closed to passengers, it was used for several years by the Jones and Laughlin Steel Company as an office building. Today, the structure sits vacant just outside the city of Aliquippa. The station was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.

Jonathan Oxer

Jonathan Oxer (born 26 July 1970, London, England) is a computer programmer, Debian developer, author, entrepreneur, and Free Software activist. He lives in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia with his wife and their two children.
Early life and education.
Jonathan Oxer was born at St Mary Abbott's Hospital in London, England to Australian parents who were working in London at the time. In late 1970 his parents returned to Melbourne, Australia.
Oxer's primary education was at Blackwood Community School, a small alternative school created in the mid-1970s by a group of parents. The school was known for having an unstructured learning program that mixed students across all year levels and did not use scheduled class times.
Oxer's secondary education was at St Michael's Grammar School where he completed his HSC in 1989. In 1987 Oxer was one of a group of students from the school who conducted an extra-curricular project to use information published by researchers at IBM Zurich, the University of Alabama, and the University of Houston to create a sample of yttrium-barium-copper-oxide (YBCO) superconductor capable of exhibiting superconducting properties at the temperature of liquid nitrogen, which at the time was the highest-temperature superconductor yet created Oxer's contributions to the project included writing software to plot the optimum cooling curve of the material to maximise crystal alignment during the annealing process.
Career.
In 1994 Oxer founded Mission Internet, one of the first companies in the world to specialise in connecting database content to the Internet. In 2000 Mission Internet's operations became part of Internet Vision Technologies, a company formed in partnership with Andrew Minett. Oxer is currently Technical Director of Internet Vision Technologies.
Free Software.
Debian Project.
Oxer was admitted to the Debian Project in August 2002. He subsequently convened the Debian Miniconf in a different city every year in conjunction with Linux.conf.au: Perth in 2003, Adelaide in 2004, Canberra in 2005, Dunedin (New Zealand) in 2006, Sydney in 2007, and Melbourne in 2008.
Linux Australia Inc.
Oxer was elected President of Linux Australia on 25 January 2005, serving three consecutive terms. He was also nominated for the 2008 election but did not accept the nomination.
Early in his first term Oxer was the focus of controversy surrounding the application for a trademark in Australia for the term "Linux". In many countries the trademark "Linux" is registered by or on behalf of the Linux Mark Institute, an organisation which administers the trademark on behalf of Linus Torvalds. Following an attempt by an unassociated commercial entity known as Linux Australia Pty Ltd to register the trademark within Australia, Linux Australia agreed to act as an agent of Linux Mark Institute to contest the pending trademark application by Linux Australia Pty Ltd and submit a counterclaim for the trademark. Subsequent action taken by Linux Australia included presentation of a request for support for the trademark application to a number of FOSS-related businesses in Australia by a lawyer acting on behalf of the organisation. As a result of the way the letter was worded some recipients misinterpreted it as a demand for payment for use of the trademark, causing a negative backlash within the FOSS community. Jon Hall, President of Linux Mark Institute, subsequently defended the actions of Linux Australia Inc and confirmed that the application was submitted on behalf of the organisation. The trademark applications by both Linux Australia Pty Ltd and Linux Australia Inc were ultimately denied.
During his incumbency Oxer was a vocal opponent of changes to Australian intellectual property law mandated by the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement, and in particular the broader definition of technological protection measures.
Cryptography.
Oxer has coordinated the large PGP/GPG keysigning parties at every Linux.conf.au from 2004 onward, and to assist with key collection and management for large groups created the keysigning.org website. He also administers keys.keysigning.org, the only keyserver in the subkeys.pgp.net network geographically located in Australasia.
RFID Implant.
In March 2006 Oxer used a veterinary RFID tag implantation tool to implant an RFID tag under the skin of his left arm, and subsequently modified his house to allow the implanted tag to control items such as the door locks. He was subsequently labelled "Australia's geekiest geek" in The Age and Sydney Morning Herald.
Author.
Oxer is author of several books relating to computers and e-business:

De Heurne

De Heurne is a village in the municipality of Aalten, near Dinxperlo (Achterhoek region) in the eastern Netherlands.
The village contains a Protestant church and a school. At the beginning of the 20th century, De Heurne had its own train station, on the Varsseveld - Dinxperlo railway line. Although the station has closed, the building is still there.
According to CBS, the village had a population of 1,009 inhabitants as at 1 January 2008.
Revenues in the village are mainly from the agricultural sector. In recent years it has shifted towards tourism. Around 1950, the village contained more than ten small grocery shops, however these have all now closed.
To avoid confusion with Heurne ("Aaltense Heurne"), De Heurne is locally known as "Dinxperlose Heurne"

Lasakau sea warriors

The Lasakau Sea Warriors were a 19th-century warrior sub-culture in the pre-colonial state of Bau, in Fiji. The sea warriors were instrumental in spreading Bau's political power throughout the South Pacific archipelagic islands. The rise of the eminent islet of Bau amongst other embryonic states was due mainly to the projection of sea power through its naval forces. Bauan chief Ratu Tubuanakoro was praised by French Captain Dumont D' Urville in May 1827 for his geographic knowledge of the Fijian archipelago signifying Bau's naval influence. More far-ranging than Bau's land warriors led by the "Vusaradave" clan, the "Lasakau" clan became the leading proponents of war and tribute for the emerging island kingdom. They became known as the "Bai kei Bau" or 'War fence of Bau'. Sahlins made the crucial observation that," The kings of Bau based their rule not on native cultivators but on native sailors and fishers-which is to say in Fijian categories, as in political strategies, not on the land but on the sea". This was the great political transformation that catapulted Bau to power over other pre-colonial kingdoms.
"The fleet of Thakombau sailed out this morning with not less than 200 warriors on board each canoe."
-Rev. Walter Lawry, a missionary, 1847.
The Lasakau clan was traditionally the fishermen of Bau. The clan was also renowned as seafarers. This is verified by many traditional blood links to far-flung islands of Fiji. The leading families of Lasakau as purveyors of sea bounty and wealth married into Bauan royalty. They became key allies in the competing chiefly intrigues that shaped Fiji’s pre-colonial political landscape. As Bauan maritime supremacy came into contact with Western explorers, traders and missionaries, its native hegemonic power was transformed. Christian missionaries and British colonisers consolidated Bauan political influence as the conduit of Western civilization in the Fiji Islands.
Bau history and ethnology.
The importance of Bauan history to pre-colonial Fiji has often been emphasised by scholars. In tracing its ascendency, Scarr succinctly posits, "The rise of Bau was rapid, and was due partly to the natural ability of her chiefs, and partly to the advantages gained from the first use of firearms. The Bau chiefs claimed descent from certain elements of the Fijian mythical Nakauvadra mountain range migration. Whom, having come to Verata, divided and wandered widely; in the final stage of their wanderings they settled, in comparatively recent times, on the coast near their present island, then named Ulu-ni-vuaka (The Pig's Head)."The Kubuna people on Bau (Ulu-ni-vuaka) island became embroiled in a struggle for power involving their chiefs that subsequently involved other tribal kingdoms of Fiji. The relationship between the Roko Tui Bau as sacred King and the Vunivalu of Bau as his warlord hence underwent a role inversion in the early nineteenth century.
Originally Bau island was occupied by the Butoni, a predatory tribe of sailors and traders. About 1760, the Bau chief Nailatikau seized Ulu-ni-vuaka and expelled the Butoni, who thenceforth were rovers, wandering to many parts of the Group establishing settlements at Lakeba and Somosomo. The Butoni however, continued to owe a degree of allegiance to their conquerors, and their canoes were always at the disposal of the chiefs of Bau for the transport of property and warriors.
The Vunivalu of Bau, Nailatikau was succeeded by Banuve, who, during a period of nearly thirty years, consolidated the young state's position and carried out an ambitious scheme of improvements to the island. He reclaimed wide areas of the adjacent reef flats, and built stone canoe-docks and sea-walls as a protection against erosion. To provide manual labour, he allowed fishermen from Beqa and craftsmen from Kadavu to settle on the island in the areas known as Lasakau and Soso.
The Lasakau people of the Yavusa Nabou clan trace their roots to Delailasakau Naitasiri and the Nakauvadra ranges foothills where their original ancestral home or "yavutu" was located. The clan re-located to Bau from Beqa Island on the invitation of the Vunivalu Ratu Banuve. This was after the banishment of the Levuka and Butoni people from Bau around the 1760s. A branch of the Lasakau clan from Beqa headed South to Yale, Kadavu Island. In addition an earlier migration of the Lasakau clan had also journeyed from Nakauvadra to Wainibuka with the Rokotuibau and on to Kubuna at Tai ko Bau with the Butoni and Levuka clans.
The seafaring exploits of Bau's sea warriors, recounted through the lineage of the Lasakau Nabou sub-clan of Mataqalikira and in particular the two chiefly households of "Nacokula" and "Nadrukuta" reflected the Machiavellian and martial mores of the times. Through the chiefs of these two households, Bau's fortunes were intrepidly pursued by the Vunivalu Tui Kaba.
Ratu Pope Seniloli the Vunivalu of Bau (1883–1936), in his sworn statement at the Native Lands Commission in 1933 for the Village of Lasakau asserted, "Ai tokatoka ka liu ko Nacokula. Sa bula eso na kena kawa". (The leading family is of the household Nacokula. The descendants are alive)."Oi rau vata ko Nacokula kei Nadrukuta" (Nacokula and Nadrukuta are of the same household). "A vale ruarua koya e rau i liuliu ni kai Lasakau kece edaidai." ( These two households are the present leaders of the Lasakau people) There are strong geneaological and traditional evidence that suggests that the ancestors of these two households originated from within the Tui Kaba Vunivalu clan and not the Tunidau ni Bau clan as made out.
In fact in his detailed drawing of the Islet of Bau in 1856 Joseph Waterhouse (minister) singles out Cakobau and Lasakau chief Kolivisawaqa II, also known as Kamikamica, and son of Ratu Loaloadravu Tubuanakoro who was also known as Kolivisawaqa, the elder half brother of Cakobau, residential sites or "yavus" from all others, signifying their high status in Bauan society.
The surname 'Kamikamica' or 'pleasant' and 'sweet' that survives in the Nacokula household today is an allusion to the personality, chiefly character and high intellect of Ratu Loaloadravu Tubuanakoro alias Kolivisawaqa I. He was slain by Bauan rebels in antipathy to his father Ratu Tanoa Visawaqa's rule as Vunivalu. Tubuanakoro's son was named ' Kamikamica' alias Kolivisawaqa II to immortalize the fallen chief.Another of Ratu Tubuanakoro's son was Ratu Vuniani Vukinamualevu who later was Roko Tui Ba in the 1880s.
French Captain Dumont D' Urville in his 1827 expedition of the Fiji archipelago, was amazed at Tubuanakoro's seafaring skills and knowledge of the group of islands when Cakobau's elder half brother acted as pilot on board his ship the "Astrolabe". Captain D'Urville was particularly taken by Tubuanakoro's " gentle manners,agreeable appearance and accommodating character". 
Warlords.
Capell in his study of Fijian history stated that, "the history of Fiji is the history of chiefly families". The phrase in fact emphasized the hierarchical nature of Fijian traditional society where chiefly power was absolute. The relationship between Chiefs and Westerners in especially Missionaries thus became a focal point for gathering insight into Fijian culture and tradition in the nineteenth century. 
On the rise of the Matanitu of Bau, David Routledge pointed out that the ".. support of the Lasakau was necessary to stability on Bau, even though they were not of the ruling family". Adolf Brewster described the Lasakau as ... “the Royal Fishermen, a highly important and powerful clan, who like our Marines were soldiers and sailors too, as they were warriors in addition to their ordinary calling.” The feats of the warmongering Lasakau tribe became widespread and abhorred by Missionaries such as Reverend Williams who stated, "The Lasakau people especially, were widely known as dangerous men (tamata rerevaki)".."Very bloodthirsty and cruel". Reverend Jagger said of the Lasakau, " much feared on that account, the circumstance of them having plenty of canoes at their command enables them the more effectively to carry their schemes into practice".
The introduction of firearms in tribal skirmishes by Bau added to their naval superiority. From 1803 to 1829, during Ratu Naulivou's reign as Vunivalu of Bau, the islet kingdom reached the zenith of its power. Naulivou recruited European beachcombers as mercenaries into his Bauan forces and was able to make good use of this advantage to further his political control. Mercenary Charlie Savage fought alongside Bauan forces in many skirmishes and was given the title "Koroinavunivalu". He terrorized Bau's enemies with his musketry though this did not spare him from the club. In 1813 he was ambushed along with others in the sandalwood trade skirmishes in Bua, Vanua Levu. At the time of Naulivou’s death though, Bau was well on the way to establishing a Fiji-wide political hegemony founded on sea power and western fire arms.
During the reign of Naulivou (1803–1829) probably around 1810, there was an internal power struggle in Lasakau due to the rise of the Tui Kaba Vunivalu as the premiere chief in Bau. This led to the banishment of the sacred king, the Vuaniivi Roko Tui Bau to Vanua Balavu, Lau. See Turaga na Rasau. This inversion of the chiefly role led to drawn out internal strife on the island. In Lasakau , the Tunidaunibau clan succumbed to the Mataqalikira. The Mataqalikira supported the Tui Kaba Vunivalu in the overthrow of the Roko Tui Bau. 
This struggle continued during the time of Ratu Tanoa Visawaqa and his son Ratu Seru Epenisa Cakobau. Riven with intra-tribal schisms, a faction of the Tui Kaba had ousted Ratu Tanoa as Vunivalu. In 1837, Ratu Seru re-installed his father Tanoa through a plot with the Lasakau Mataqalikira headed by Tutekovuya.
Around the early nineteenth century the contention for ascendency in the Kubuna hierarchy of Bau between the Roko Tui Bau and the Vunivalu Tui Kaba spilled over to Lasakau's . The "Tunidaunibau" who were loyal to the Roko Tui Bau was overpowered by the "Mataqalikira". This subversion of the Roko Tui Bau by the Tui Kaba Vunivalu was gained and alliance with the "Mataqalikira" sealed by marriages to Bauan ladies of rank.
Sahlins typifies this relationship of the Sea warriors or "Kai wai" and the paramount chief as, "always of outside origin and condition, considered different people or "Kai tani", even when long established within the chiefdom, such service are attached to the paramount service by founding gift of a royal daughter". However, there is genealogical evidence that suggests that the chiefly male ancestors of Nacokula and Nadrukuta were indeed decendents of the Vunivalu Tui Kaba line from Ratu Tanoa Visawaqa and Ratu Vuibureta.
Consequently the daughters of Bau's sacred King, the Roko Tui Bau: Adi Vuniwaqa and Adi Sivo, were betrothed to Lasakau chiefs; Tuisavura I and Tutekovuya. In addition, Adi Loloakubou the half sister of Cakobau was given as a bride to notorious Lasakau chief Ratu Gavidi. This traditional marriage is vividly captured by Mary Wallis in 1851. Adi Litiana and Adi Kaunilotuma of the Vunivalu Tui Kaba clan were also given as wives to Kolivisawaqa II and Ratu Isoa Tuituba both of the Mataqalikira. In all likelihood the 'Mataqalikira' refers in fact to the 'Mataqali ira ni Tui Kaba' or half brothers and first cousins of Ratu Seru Cakobau given the contention for power that was rife within the Vunivalu clan at the zenith of Bauan political struggles from 1800-1852.

The rise of the Mataqalikira clan of Lasakau began with Ratu Tubuanakoro alias Kolivisawaqa I, Tutekovuya and Tuisavura alias Gavidi. In 1832 Ratu Tubuanakoro, vasu to Gau and Cakobau’s half brother, was slain by rebels on Bau who were against his Father Tanoa's rule.Routledge's account of Tubuanakoro's demise was that he was disposed of by his half brother Tutekovuya or the 'Burner of Vuya'. Tubuanakoro through his mother and first wife of Tanoa, Adi Vereivalu was vasu levu to the Takala- i- Gau clan, of Sawaike. Ratu Tubuanakoro with his army of Lasakau marauders, hence had great authority over Gau island and the Lomaiviti group of islands as a whole. As Tanoa's trusted collector of tribute and wealth this may have led to his demise at the hands of rebels including his half brother Tutekovuya, the vasu-i- Tamavua Naitasiri.
Ratu Nalila and his father Maibole of the Tunidaunibau then later deposed Tutekovuya. Tutekovuya was the Lasakau leader and co-conspirator with Ratu Seru Cakobau’s in the coup of 1837, where Bau was destroyed and Ratu Tanoa restored as the Vunivalu. The support of the Roko Tui Dreketi to Lasakau was crucial in the success of this coup in which Tanoa the vasu to Rewa was re-installed though Cakobau was the power behind the throne. Later Ratu Gavidi then disposed of Nalila in revenge of Tute his half brother's death. Nalila from the Tunidau sub-clan was contending ascendency with Gavidi of the Mataqaliira clan among the Lasakau people. The phrase "Verevakabau" became synonymous with Bauan politics and the ongoing struggle for power.
Through the successful coup of 1837 the name "Ca ko Bau" (Destroyer of Bau) was conferred upon Ratu Seru and "Ga(sau)vidi" upon Tuisavura II. Many recorded contacts in the 1830s and 1840s such as with Commodore Charles Wilkes, Captain John Erskine and Reverend Calvert, place Lasakau chief Gavidi as Cakobau's leading enforcer. In 1849 Captain Erskine of H.B.M. ship Havannah wrote," The town or city of Bau seems to consist of three divisions :viz; Soso, Bau, Lasakau; the latter meaning the fishermen, of whom Gavidi is chief, being next in importance to Thakombau, and his great friend."(Waterhouse :1866:159)
Ratu Gavidi was later killed in battle at Verata in 1850. In an account of his death Rev Waterhouse revealed, " Two things are quite certain: first, that Cakobau was unusually anxious during the attack, and his mind seemed to be occupied with something else rather than with the battle; and, second, that as soon as Gavidi was killed, the signal was given for general retreat, after which the attack was not repeated"(1866:179). Another account stated that it was witnessed that Cakobau's "anxiety was high" as the Lasakau chief forayed too deep into the Veratan battle lines and "was shot in the back". His death so demoralized the Bauan army that they withdrew from the battlefield. His body was taken back to Lasakau and buried in Nadrukuta-his home which was built to honour his mother Adi Vuniwaqa the daughter of the Roko Tui Bau. 
In Lasakau folklore,Cakobau's erstwhile companion Gavidi always sailed with him on the Vunivalu's war canoe the "Ramarama" to war. On the expedition to his last battle at Verata, Gavidi 'sailed separately' hence the surname 'Vodo vakatani' that exists in the Nadrukuta household today.
Alliances.
Vunivalu Ratu Seru Cakobau gave his half-sister Adi Loloakubou in marriage to Ratu Gavidi of Lasakau. Adi Loloakubou's mother was Adi Talatoka, the Radi-Levuka, the first consort of the Vunivalu Ratu Tanoa and daughter of the Tui Cakau. This marriage alliance in essence strengthened the Vunivalu's control of the Lasakau people's seafaring role as chief purveyors for the islet Kingdom. Ratu Cakobau had also promised another prominent chief, the Tui Nakelo his sister in marriage to gain his support in the war against Rewa. This he obviously reneged on, which greatly displeased the Tui Nakelo. The warrior chief of the Rewa delta in kind changed allegiance to the Roko Tui Dreketi of Rewa in opposition to Bau.
At Gavidi's death and in breaking with traditional mourning practices, the people of Lasakau pleaded with Ratu Cakobau that Adi Loloakubou, be spared the custom of wife strangulation as she was with child. Subsequently she gave birth to a son, Ratu Isoa Tuituba. Adi Loloakubou after the death of Ratu Gavidi was later betrothed to Ratu Mara Kapaiwai (1815–59)-cousin and a fierce rival of Cakobau, and the father of Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi, (1859–1920) the leading Fijian administrator of his day.
Ratu Isoa Tuituba, the "Komai Nadrukuta" married Adi Litia Kaunilotuma of the Vunivalu Tui Kaba clan. Ratu Vodovakatani I, Ratu Inoke Takiveikata I, Adi Tuikilakila, Adi Lewakikau Unaisi and Adi Tatila were born from this union and ensured the Nadrukuta household prominence in Lasakau. Adi Tuikilakila was Ratu Isoa Gavidi II and Ratu Inoke Takiveikata's II mother. Ratu Inoke was acting Vice-President of Fiji in the 1990s. As "Vasu Levu" to Lasakau Ratu Inoke was honoured as "Komai Nadrukuta". He was married to Adi Sainimili Rokoyau of Lomanikoro Rewa.
Ratu Tevita Vodovakatani II, the Komai Nadrukuta (?-1990) and long time engineer on the Governor's vessel the "Ramarama", was Ratu Inoke Takiveikata's I son from Roko Naisua of the Tui Moala and also blood linked to Nacokula. Ratu Vodovakatani II married Adi Asenaca Rarogo of the Nabaubau-Rokotui Bau. Their issues were Reverend Ratu Inoke Takiveikata, Adi Litia Vuniwaqa, Ratu Eroni Cinavilakeba, Adi Viniana Tuirewa, Adi Finau, Adi Qolikoro and Roko Naisua. WPC 742, Adi Litia Vuniwaqa was one of the first Fijian female police officers passing-out in December 1970.
The arranged marriage of women of status to gain or seal political alliances was often practised by monarchies in ancient times. Hence Bauan ladies of the Roko Tui Bau and the Tui Kaba were likewise married off to chiefly households of Rewa, Naitasiri, Cakaudrove and Lau.
Similarly through such marriages the chiefly clans of the Tui Ba- Nailega, Takala i Gau of Sawaieke, Gau island and the Tui Moala of Naroi, Moala are kinsmen to the chiefs of Lasakau.In fact the surname 'Kamikamica' and the yavu name 'Nacokula' are still used by the chiefs of Sawaike,Naroi,Dravo,Beqa and Nailega today. These strategic familial links reinforced Bauan supremacy on the western coast of Viti Levu, Lomaiviti and the yasayasa Moala Lau group of islands. Ratu Seru Cakobau is said, to have been reared as a child, on Gau island in Lomaiviti and Moala island in Lau.
Honours.
Tubuanakoro (?-1832), chief of Lasakau and son of Tanoa, for his warrior prowess was bestowed the title "Koli-visawaqa" I by Tanoa Visawaqa-‘Burner of Boats’- who reigned from 1829 to 1852 as the Vunivalu of Bau. Koli was Tanoa's leading warrior during the struggle and banishment of the Roko Tui Bau Vuaniivi from Bau. This struggle and inversion of the chiefly hierarchy invariably escalated to wars with the kingdoms of Verata and Rewa.
The Bauans had a penchant for bestowing honorific titles on their more accomplished warriors as prefixes to their names or "yaca ni ravu". The names "Koli","Koroi" and "Waqa" are the more exalted prefixes. Furthermore the title "Koli" is the prefix for a slayer of ten and 'visa' for a slayer of twenty. The title "Kolivisawaqa" I as an example was bestowed on Lasakau and Bauan chief Rabonu alias Ratu Tubuanakoro. Through the main support of Kolivisawaqa I and his Lasakau clan, the Vunivalus Naulivou and Tanoa gained ascendency in the eastern parts of the Fiji archipelago.
Again the name of Lasakau chief Gavidi is a "yaca ni ravu" and short for 'Gasauvidi'. The name is an allusion to the burning arrows and reed fences set ablaze by the Lasakau on the night of the 1837 coup that re-installed Cakobau's father Tanoa as Vunivalu. Gavidi was Cakobau's main warrior during the young Tui Kaba chief's ascendency. Both their mothers Adi Vuniwaqa and Adi Savusavu were of the Roko Tui Bau.
Clash with Christianity.
Kolivisawaqa's I son Kolivisawaqa II succeeded Gavidi after his death in Verata in April 1850. His siding with Ratu Cakobau and King George of Tonga's Christian forces at the Battle of Kaba (1855) was critical to the defeat of rebel forces led by Ratu Mara Kapaiwai. This was initially not the case. As told by Rev Calvert, "I feared that danger was at hand, mainly, I thought, through Koli-i-Visa Wanq-qa head chief of the Bau fishermen who was holding intercourse with Mara the rebel chief who had joined the King of Rewa." Cakobau realising the dire predicament he was in urged Rev Calvert, "There is one thing that may be useful-Do you keep close intercourse with Koli." Apparently, Cakobau was weary of intra-Tui Kaba conspiracy for the title of Vunivalu given that Kolivisawaqa II was a powerful close relative of his. Kolivisawaqa II however later joined rebel chiefs in creating dissention to Cakobau's rule. In 1859, he was captured along with other rebel chiefs, Ratu Mara Kapaiwai, Naulivou and Ratu Isikeli (Tui Viwa) for resisting the spread of Christianity.
They were tried but they escaped. Ratu Mara and Ratu Naulivou were later recaptured, tried and hung on 6 August 1859. Later Koli after being pardoned became a Christian. He eventually featured prominently in all other Bauan Christian wars and pacification campaigns in particular at Ba in the 1860s and 70s.
Adi Litiana (daughter of Ratu Masivesi the son of Tanoa) of the Tui Kaba was betrothed to Tutekovuya. Kamikamica I had at least four wives. From Adi Mereoni Kula of Bau he had two sons; Ratu Maika Rabonu, Ratu Pio Tini(1887-?) and a daughter Adi Stela. Ratu Maika, Pio and Adi Stella's, Christian names signify that they were baptized in the Roman Catholic faith.
This was probably due to Koli's falling-out period with Cakobau and the Wesleyan missionaries. Many chiefs after the Battle of Kaba in 1855 still sided with rebel Bau chief Ratu Mara Kapaiwai. They saw Wesleyanism as a Cakobau and Tongan conspiracy for political supremacy. This was one of the reasons for some high chiefs opting to convert to Roman Catholicsm. Furthermore Koli's move to adopting Catholicism would have stemmed more from a political motive due to the Wesleyan missionaries abhorrence of his tribe's pillaging and plundering- the raision d' etre, of Lasakau's sea warriors.
Evidently Kamikamica's I eldest son Ratu Maika Rabonu had four daughters who married into other noble houses of other provinces. Adi Sainimili Lewamoqe married the Tui Ba, Adi Mereani Salele married the Vunivalu of Rewa. Adi Mereoni Nawaibau, and Adi Josivini Maisavu also married into leading Kubuna clans.
Kamikamica's I second son Ratu Pio Tini had three son's and two daughters.His first son, Ratu Viliame Kamikamica II married Adi Lele of the Tui Cakau of Somosomo Taveuni and had children: Adi Litiana, Ratu Filimoni, Ratu Sakiusa, Ratu Viliame, Ratu Filimoni II, Adi Lele and Adi Wati. Ratu Viliame Kamikamica III (1915–64) and Adi Kelera Kataogo (1911–1980) followed from his union with Silafaga Paniani (1876–1918) of the Ainu'u Maliatoa clan of Sapapali'i village Savaii Samoa and another son, Ratu Qionikoro whose mother was a Ms Wedlock.Kamikamica's I daughters, Adi Stela was married to Ratu Filimoni Loco, Tui Sawakasa and had a son Ratu Ovini Loco.His youngest daughter was Rokonaisua from a lady of Naroi Moala.
Ratu Viliame Kamikamica III had two children from Teuila Tunufai Selio of Sale'aula village Savaii Samoa, Adi Silafaga and Ratu Alisada Vodo Kamikamica. Ratu Viliame Kamikamica's III second marriage to Sala Ahome'e-a half-sister of Queen Mata'aho of Tonga produced two children, Ratu Jiale Kamikamica and Adi Kelera Kamikamica.
Colonies of Bau.
The Lasakau fishermen were in essence the Bauan navy. These sea warriors projected nascent Bauan traditional power throughout eastern Fiji. As seafarers their dominating reach by the use of huge sailing war canoes established Bauan colonies in various villages on Gau, Moala, Vanuabalavu, Nairai and coastal Tailevu and Ba. The earlier banished Butoni and Levuka people of Bau also settled in Taveuni, Macuata, Koro, Lakeba and Kadavu. These sea people formed a network of colonies and auxiliaries of the islet kingdom of Bau. Hence well beyond the tiny islet's horizon, Bau was able to levy food, traditional wealth and more importantly war canoes through the Lasakau sea warriors. From these kinsmen villages all over the Fiji Islands, Bau was able to sub-jugate contending chiefdoms and extract tribute.

Oldbawn

Oldbawn (or Old Bawn, ) is a small suburban area now within Tallaght on Dublin's Southside. Formerly a small village in its own right, it is situated near the River Dodder.
History.
Old Bawn was the site of an estate for several centuries, and later of a small village, whose population reached over 380 in the mid-19th century.
Old Bawn House.
Old Bawn House was built in 1635 by Archdeacon William Bulkeley, son of Launcelot Bulkeley the Archbishop. It was situated where the St. Maelruan schools now stand. 
It was almost unique in architectural style, being one of the first Irish houses that was not built purely for defence. Oldbawn had extensive pleasure gardens that survived, albeit in a neglected state, until 1900. "From a rude, desolate, and wild land he brought it to a most delightful patrimony" Handcock quoted Blacker as saying of Bulkeley's house. 
Old Bawn House was damaged in the rebellion of 1641 but was restored immediately at a cost of £3,000. The house was designed in an H shape with high pointed gables, and had many windows and twelve chimneys which was unusual at that time. It had many internal features such as the chimney piece and a carved oak staircase both of which are in the National Museum. The chimney piece reached to the ceiling and depicted the building of the walls of Jerusalem, dating back to 1635. There was also an unusual lodge house built to the front of the house.
The house passed to Lady Tynt who leased it. In 1830, Old Bawn was bought by the McDonnell family who established a paper mill behind the house. This was one of many mills along the Dodder in the nineteenth century. The house fell into disrepair during the early 1900s and was used as a storehouse when the lands were being developed in the 1960s, and eventually Old Bawn house gave way to the new developments in the area.

G. Janardhana Reddy

Gali Janardhana Reddy(Kannada: ಗಲಿ ಜನಾರ್ಧನ್ ರೆಡ್ಡಿ ), born on 11 January 1967 is an Indian politician with the BSR Congress party (formerly with the Bharatiya Janata Party) and one of the richest politicians of Karnataka.
He obtained his first iron ore mining license in Karnataka in 2004, when the Congress party led the state government. He has subsequently been implicated in the illegal mining scandal in Bellary and the related Belekeri port scam. In 2009, a Supreme Court of India-appointed central empowerment committee recommended action against Reddy-owned Obulapuram Mining Company. An FIR in the case was filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation. Also, Santosh Hegde, the Lokayukta or ombudsman of Karnataka state, had indicted Reddy and his two brothers, all of whom were cabinet ministers in the BJP's Karnataka state government at the time, in the mining scandal.
After being arrested and sent to judicial custody, all three Reddy brothers (and the then CM B. S. Yeddyurappa) were removed from their ministerial positions. Subsequently, they broke away from the BJP. While Yeddyurappa formed the Karnataka Janata Paksha (KJP) party, the Reddy brothers joined up with B. Sriramulu to form the BSR Congress party.
Life.
Janardhana Reddy and his brothers G. Karunakara Reddy and G. Somashekara Reddy were born into the family of police constable Chenga Reddy, and grew up in Bellary. He and his brothers transformed themselves in less than a decade from industrialists into political bosses who dominated local government in the Bellary district, which holds the state’s richest iron ore deposits.
Janardhana never had a college education. He came into the limelight during the Lok Sabha elections in 1999, when the Reddy brothers worked in the campaign for Sushma Swaraj after she stood as a long-shot candidate in Bellary, against Sonia Gandhi. Though Swaraj lost, she remained a patron of the Reddys, and was known to visit Bellary frequently. However, after the mining scandal broke out and the Reddy brothers were indicted, chargesheeted and sent to judicial custody, Swaraj distanced herself from them, and all three Reddy brothers were expelled from the BJP's state government in Karnataka as well as from the party itself.
Business history, growth of influence and wealth.
In 1998, Janardhana Reddy's finance company, Ennoble India Savings, collapsed, leaving unpaid debts of over Rs. 200 crores. However, by 2008, he and his wife declared assets of Rs. 115 crores. The Reddy brothers obtained their first lease for an iron mine in 2004 when the Indian National Congress party led the government in Karnataka state. Since then, their rise has been meteoric, driven by soaring commodity prices, primarily due to demand for iron ore from China.
Involvement in Karnataka politics.
The state government headed by B. S. Yeddyurappa of the BJP, requiring the support of a group of legislators aligned with Reddy, was in a precarious position in mid-2009. In a compromise with Yeddyurappa, the Reddys forced the removal of Karnataka minister Shobha Karandlaje and chief secretary V.P. Baligar, and obtained ministerial berths for themselves.
Sushma Swaraj is said to have stepped in to prevent the removal of the Reddy brothers from the Karnataka ministry in mid-2010, after uproar due to the mining scandal.
In August 2011, D. V. Sadananda Gowda of the BJP succeeded Yeddyurappa as chief minister of Karnataka and did not include the Reddy brothers in his cabinet of ministers. Subsequently, Yeddyurappa broke away from the BJP to form his own party, the KJP. The Reddy brothers broke away to form BSR Congress with B. Sriramulu.
Involvement in Andhra Pradesh politics.
Born into a Telugu-speaking family, Janardhana Reddy also wields considerable influence in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh. He was close to former chief minister Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy and his son Y. S. Jagan Mohan Reddy. It is alleged that it was this influence that he wielded with the Congress party that enabled him to obtain the iron ore mining license in Bellary from the Congress state government in Karnataka in 2004. Jaganmohan Reddy is also reported to have a business interest in Brahmani Steels. The loss of political support resulting from the death of Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy has increased the scrutiny of Janardhana Reddy's mining activities. The CBI is running two parallel investigations in Hyderabad into the illegal mining activities of Janardhana Reddy and the allegations of corruption against Jaganmohan Reddy.
Implication in 2011 Lokayukta report on Illegal Mining.
In July 2011, the Lokayukta of Karnataka, Santosh Hegde, published a report on the illegal mining activities in the Bellary region. Janardhana Reddy was accused of completely rigging the iron ore mining in this area and defrauding the government. Directorate General of Income Tax Investigation officials had clues to tax evasion and found that Reddy had entered into a MoU with a one-dollar company of Singapore to camouflage the company's income suppression. They raided the place along with other investigative agencies and formed a report which was the basis of the report on illegal mining. Reddy is said to have designed a "Zero-Risk system" of iron ore mining, where he seamlessly provided protection to unauthorized and unaccounted mining, with active connivance from government officials at all levels. The rule of the iron ore mafia under his command was called the "Republic of Bellary" in which no external control or governance mechanism had any effect.
Arrest.
Janardhana Reddy was arrested on 5 September 2011 by the CBI, and taken to Hyderabad, the capital of the neighboring state of Andhra Pradesh. He is accused of being involved in illegal mining of iron ore in Bellary in Karnataka and Anantapur in Andhra Pradesh. This investigation is the culmination of a recommendation to Income Tax Department and CBI by the former Andhra Pradesh chief minister K. Rosaiah and not directly related to the findings of Karnataka Lokayukta Santosh Hegde. After the CBI court heard his lawyers representations, he along with his brother-in-law, B. V. Srinivas Reddy was remanded to judicial custody and sent to Chanchalguda Jail. The CBI in its ongoing investigations also arrested senior officers of the IAS and IRS. A CBI court on 4 August 2012, extended the judicial custody of Janardhana Reddy and four others arrested in the illegal mining case till 7 September.
Allegation of Judicial Bribery.
The CBI is also investigating the alleged bribing of Hyderabad Special Court judge T.Pattabhirama Rao to secure bail for G. Janardhana Reddy in the Obulapuram Mining Company case, by his family members (G.Somashekar Reddy & H.Suresh Babu). Further investigations by CBI implicated others, including a retired judge T.V. Chalapathi Rao, in the "Cash for Bail" scandal.

<doc id="18540033" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18540033" title="Porthemmet Beach hoax">
Porthemmet Beach hoax

The Porthemmet Beach hoax was a spoof website that was set up to advertise the "best beach in Cornwall" in 2007. The site claimed that although Cornish people would often pretend not to know it, hiding its true location was an in-joke among locals. It encouraged visitors to say that they were an "emmet"; a person who loved Cornwall.
However Emmet is a Cornish dialect word for ant, and has come to be used in Cornwall as a derisory nickname for tourists and visitors, or people who have moved to Cornwall from other parts of the UK. The website's creator, Jonty Haywood from Truro, said he was inspired by a similar hoax about an "Ice Bar" in a Scandinavian city. He denied his motives were "part of a wider agenda to promote Cornish nationalism by poking fun at some of the millions of tourists who help sustain the county's economy"; it was actually about the humour in sending visitors to Cornwall "off to find an imaginary beach".
The website featured various words related to Cornwall, such as pasty and chough. It encouraged visitors to use false pronunciations, for instance, the false etymology for the name "Porthemmet" was said to have derived from the name "Port of Emmet", where Emmet was a Cornish saint, brother of the patron saint of Cornwall, Saint Piran. Along with the website, hoax signs to the beach were also erected around the county. However anyone following the directions ended up leaving Cornwall on the A30 road.
In July 2008, a second set of road signs appeared. Haywood later admitted his involvement.
Reaction.
The Porthemmet hoax sparked a mixed response from various groups. More than 2,000 people joined its page on Facebook. Malcolm Bell, chief executive of South West Tourism, thought that although the spoof had negative connotations he said people would "see the West Country humour" and any "publicity was good publicity". However VisitCornwall, the Cornwall tourism board, criticised the hoax. Other thought it reflected badly on rural communities that depended on outside revenues for survival.

<doc id="18540038" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18540038" title="Kalmyk Project">
Kalmyk Project

The Kalmyk Project was the name given to Soviet plans to launch a surprise attack on the northwest frontier of India via Tibet and other Himalayan buffer states in 1919-1920. It was a part of Soviet plans for destabilising Britain and the Western European powers through unrest in the Colonial Empire. British Indian intelligence sent agents, among them F. M. Bailey, to Central Asia to trace early Bolshevik designs on India.
Soviet Russia intended to nurture political upheaval in British India in its strategy against British imperialism. In 1919, she sent a diplomatic mission headed by an "orientalist" by the name of N.Z. Bravin. This was at the time that Afghanistan had seen a coup d'état that placed young prince Amanullah Khan in power and precipitated the Third Anglo-Afghan war. Bravin proposed to Amanullah a military alliance against British India and a campaign for which Soviet Turkestan would bear the costs. These negotiations however failed to reach concrete conclusions, and the Soviet advances were also detected by British Indian intelligence. Among other works, this Bravin expedition established links at Herat with the Austrian and German remnants of the Niedermayer-Hentig expedition, and also liaised with the Indian revolutionaries of the Provisional Government of India in Kabul.
A later plan considered by the soviets intended to raise a force of nearly forty thousand cavalry from Turkestan or the Urals which would advance to India through Afghanistan, with help from Afghan tribes who may rally against Amanullah. However, these plans presented their own problems. Amongst other routes to India that were explored were plans to foment unrest in Tibet and the Himalayan buffer states of Bhutan, Sikkim, Nepal and Thailand and Burma through the Buddhist Kalmyk people, and use these places as a staging ground for revolution in India and the shortest route to Bengal which was the centre of the revolutionary movement in India. This was to proceed under the cover of a scientific expedition under Indologist Fyodor Shcherbatskoy, and would arm the indigenous people in the North-East Indian region with modern weaponry before a regular supply could be arranged. The Kalmyk project may have been the brainchild of Raja Mahendra Pratap who had led the Niedermayer-Hentig Expedition into Afghanistan in 1915 and subsequently established the nationalist Provisional Government of India at Kabul in December that year. Pratap liaised with the Nascent Bolshevik Government and the Kaiser after 1917 to explore the scopes of a joint Soviet-German invasion of India through Afghanistan. The most notable of these meetings was Pratap's audience with Lenin arranged by People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs in 1919 when he met the latter with a group of Indian revolutionaries from the Berlin Committee. The project had the approval of Lenin. Pratap himself had a strong obsession with Tibet, and made efforts as early as 1916 to penetrate into the Himalayan Kingdom to cultivate anti-British propaganda. His efforts were resumed after his return from Moscow in 1919. He was close to Fyodor Shcherbatskoy and Sergey Oldenburg, and intended to participate in People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs' planned expeditions to Tibet in summer 1919, and was privy to the organisation's designs in the region.
However, the project was ultimately curtailed following the Czech uprising in the Trans-Siberian railway. Pratap himself set out alone to unsuccessfully pursue his goal in Tibet.

St. Peter Island, Bulgaria

St. Peter Island (, "ostrov sv. Petar") is a small Bulgarian island in the Black Sea, with an area of 0,025 square kilometres and a height of 9 metres above sea level. Also known as Bird Island, it is located in the Bay of Sozopol, close to the St. Ivan and St. Cyricus Islands. As it was not mentioned in any sources until the mid-19th century, it is presumed to have separated from the larger St. Ivan Island (which is a few hundred meters to the west) as a consequence of some kind of natural phenomenon around that time. Archaeologists have discovered the ruins of a Bulgarian National Revival-time chapel, as well as traces of ancient pottery. Two small islets or large rocks also existed to the east of St. Peter, known by the names of Milos and Gata; they were last described by Russian war correspondents in the 1820s and have presumably submerged in the following years.

Black &amp; White (book)

Black & White is a non-fiction book written by Shiva Naipaul and published by Hamish Hamilton in the U.K. in 1980. It was published with the title Journey to Nowhere: A New World Tragedy in the U.S. The book is based on Naipaul's trip to Guyana in the aftermath of the Jonestown Massacre, and his subsequent trip to the United States, in which he explored links between the People's Temple and other groups and individuals. Naipaul attempted to connect Rev. Jim Jones, founder of the People's Temple, with disparate parts of California's counterculture, and Guyanese and other Third World governments and the revolutionary ideologies which supported them. Naipaul was highly critical of these and other movements, including black liberation, the nascent New Age movement and EST, in as much as they helped, in his analysis, to create fertile ground for the People's Temple to flourish on the two continents. The book's US paperback cover tagline reads "How American ideas and ideologies led to the mass suicide of 900 people in Jonestown, Guyana."
Naipaul later told his father-in-law of the arresting effect that visiting Jonestown had had on him, saying that the dissipation of the earlier comic, lighter tone in his work was due to this experience.

Cyber Sunday (2008)

Cyber Sunday (2008) was the fifth and final Cyber Sunday (the third under this name) professional wrestling pay-per-view event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It took place on October 26, 2008 at the US Airways Center in Phoenix, Arizona. It featured wrestlers from the Raw, ECW, and SmackDown brands. Eight professional wrestling matches and one miscellaneous segment were featured on the event's card. The event received 153,000 pay-per-view buys, less than the previous year's event.
Background.
Unlike other WWE events where the stipulations were determined by WWE's creative staff, stipulations for matches were determined by votes from WWE fans conducted on WWE's website and by text messaging. The event was scheduled to feature eight professional wrestling matches and one miscellaneous segment. Although the stipulations resulted from votes by WWE fans, different wrestlers were involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines, which led to scheduled matches in which WWE fans could vote upon stipulations. Wrestlers were portrayed as either villains or fan favorites as they followed a series of tension-building events. All wrestlers were from either the ECW, Raw, or SmackDown brands – a storyline division in which WWE assigned its employees to a different television program.
The main feud from the Raw brand was over the World Heavyweight Championship. On the October 6, 2008 episode of "Raw", General Manager Mike Adamle announced that World Heavyweight Champion Chris Jericho would defend his title against Batista in a standard wrestling match, also known as a singles match, in which a guest referee would be voted for by WWE fans; the candidates for the position were Randy Orton, Shawn Michaels, and Steve Austin. Earlier that night, it was also announced that Santino Marella would defend his WWE Intercontinental Championship against a former Intercontinental Champion voted for by the WWE fans; the candidates were Roddy Piper, Goldust, or The Honky Tonk Man.
The main rivalry from the SmackDown brand was over the WWE Championship. It was announced on the October 10, 2008 episode of "Friday Night SmackDown" that WWE Champion Triple H would defend his title against either Jeff Hardy or Vladimir Kozlov in a singles match, or in a triple-threat match, a standard match involving both Hardy and Kozlov. Later that night it was also announced that The Big Show would face The Undertaker in a fans choice of match, which included a Knockout match, "I Quit" match, or a Last Man Standing match.
The only rivalry from the ECW brand was over the ECW Championship. It was announced on the October 14, 2008 episode of "ECW" that ECW Champion Matt Hardy would defend the title against the fans' choice of an opponent, with Mark Henry, Evan Bourne, or Finlay as the options from which to choose.
Event.
Before the event aired live on pay-per-view, Shelton Benjamin defended the WWE United States Championship against a superstar of the fans' choice in a match that was streamed exclusively on WWE.com. The candidates to be voted in were R-Truth, Montel Vontavious Porter and Festus. R-Truth won the poll by 59% over MVP and Festus, and hence faced Benjamin for the title. The match went back and forth, but ultimately Benjamin performed the Paydirt on R-Truth and pinned him to retain his title.
The first match to be aired live was a No Holds Barred match between Kane and Rey Mysterio. The No Holds Barred match stipulation was voted by the fans over a Falls Count Anywhere match and a Two out of three falls match. Early on in the match, Mysterio used his quickness and agility against Kane, along with some weapons like a Kendo stick and a STOP sign. Soon, Kane overpowered Mysterio and dominated the later part of the match. Near the end, Mysterio drop-toe held Kane and drove him face-first into the steel ring-steps kept in the corner of the ring. Then he hit Kane with a steel chair multiple times, before delivering a 619 and springboard splash and pinning him to win the match.
The next match featured Matt Hardy defending the ECW Championship against Evan Bourne, who was voted as the challenger by the fans over Mark Henry and Finlay. Early in the match, Bourne surprised Hardy with his agility, but Hardy eventually got control of the match. Nevertheless, Bourne hit several high-flying moves on Hardy, like a standing moonsault, a hurricanrana countering Hardy's Splash Mountain Bomb, and a diving knee drop from the top rope. In the end, Bourne missed the Air Bourne, and hence capitalizing, Hardy delivered a Twist of Fate to Bourne and pinned him to retain his title.
The third match aired was a tag team match with John Morrison and The Miz taking on Cryme Tyme (Shad Gaspard and JTG). This tag team match was chosen over an intergender tag team match having William Regal and Layla taking on Jamie Noble and Mickie James, and a World Tag Team Championship match between the champions Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase and the team of CM Punk and Kofi Kingston. The match featured numerous tag team moves from both the teams. At one point, Shad threw JTG over the ropes onto Morrison and Miz outside the ring. Back in the ring, Morrison and Miz controlled the latter part of the match. In the end, Miz, who was not the legal man in the ring, kicked Shad's knee behind the referee's back and Morrison delivered the Moonlight Drive to Shad for the pinfall.
The fourth match was between Santino Marella and The Honky Tonk Man for the Intercontinental Championship. Honky Tonk Man was voted as Marella's challenger by the fans over Roddy Piper and Goldust. Before the match started, Honky Tonk Man danced to his theme music and asked Marella to do the same, but he delivered a cheap shot to Honky Tonk Man to officially start the match. However, the match ended soon when Beth Phoenix, who was by Marella's side, tripped Honky Tonk Man as he preparing to hit Marella with his fist, and hence, the match ended in Honky Tonk Man's favor as he won via disqualification. Nevertheless, Marella remained the Intercontinental Champion as the title does not change hands via disqualification. After the match, Piper and Goldust made their way down to the ring to confront Marella. In the ring, Goldust hit the Final Cut on Marella, Piper hit him with a punch combination followed by an eye poke, and Honky Tonk Man delivered the Shake, Rattle and Roll to Marella.
The fifth match of the evening was a Last Man Standing match between The Undertaker and The Big Show. The Last Man Standing match stipulation was voted by the fans over a Knockout match and an "I Quit" match. In the beginning, Big Show threw Undertaker out of the ring, and after some time, Undertaker hit Big Show with a steel chair. The match continued with Big Show dominating Undertaker and striking him with punches. The match featured many other spots, like Undertaker thrusting Big Show's throat against a ringpost with a steel chair; Undertaker delivering a leg drop to Big Show on the ring apron, and then later countering Big Show's Chokeslam into a DDT; and, then Big Show hitting Undertaker with a TV monitor and even chokeslamming him from the Barricade through an announcer's table. In the end, Big Show hit Undertaker first with a chokeslam, followed by a knockout punch to the face and then with a steel chair, but Undertaker got to his feet each time before the ten count. Finally, Undertaker locked in Hell's Gate on Big Show causing Show to lose consciousness and allowing Undertaker to win the match.
Throughout the night, a costume contest was held featuring the WWE Divas. The winner was announced in the ring before the WWE Championship match. Mickie James, dressed as Lara Croft, won the contest.
The next match was a WWE Championship match where the fans voted who Triple H's opponent, who was Jeff Hardy, who won the poll over Vladimir Kozlov. During the beginning of the match both Hardy and Triple H countered each other's moves, then it was evenly matched. Hardy then hit the Swanton Bomb, then went up to the top rope for a second Swanton Bomb, but was unsuccessful in doing so. As Hardy was attempting the move, Triple H got up and countered the move into a Pedigree, and pinned Hardy for the win, and to retain his WWE title.
The main event featured Chris Jericho defending his World Heavyweight Championship against Batista. Steve Austin was voted by the fans to be the special guest referee. Upon hearing the voting results, Jericho attempted to walk away from the match and get counted out, but Austin explained that if Jericho got counted out or disqualified, then he would lose the title. So Jericho ran back in and proceeded with the match. It went back and forth between the two until Jericho hit a double knee facebuster, called the Codebreaker, on Austin, allowing Batista to take advantage of Jericho. Shawn Michaels came down to the ring and counted Batista's attempted pinfall, which Jericho kicked out at two. Michaels was about to hit a superkick to the face, called Sweet Chin Music, on Jericho, but instead faked Jericho out. John "Bradshaw" Layfield came down to the ring and attacked Michaels. Then Randy Orton came out and was appearing to take over as the special referee, but Austin got up and hit a Stunner on Orton. The match ended with Batista pinning Jericho after a Batista Bomb to become the new World Heavyweight Champion. After the match, Austin and Batista celebrated as they drank beer.
Aftermath.
It was announced on the 800th episode celebration of "Raw" that the World Heavyweight Championship would be defended at Survivor Series against John Cena. Later that night, Chris Jericho defeated Batista to win back the title, resulting in a Jericho versus Cena match at Survivor Series. At Survivor Series, Cena defeated Jericho to win the World Heavyweight Championship.
The feud between Triple H, Jeff Hardy and Vladimir Kozlov continued. On the November 7 episode of "SmackDown", Kozlov defeated the Undertaker via disqualification to win a title match against Triple H at Survivor Series. Hardy asked Vickie Guerrero for another chance at the title, which she refused. Then on the November 14 episode of "SmackDown", Hardy defeated Undertaker in an Extreme Rules Match, which led to Guerrero announcing that if Hardy could beat Triple H the next week, the match at Survivor Series would be a triple threat match between Triple H, Kozlov and Hardy. The next week, Hardy defeated Triple H to gain entry into the match. On the morning of Survivor Series, however, the storyline called for Hardy to be found unconscious in his hotel. The WWE Championship was changed to a standard singles match between Kozlov and Triple H, but during the match, Guerrero announced that, as promised, there would be a triple threat match.

Białystok Voivodeship (1945–75)

"See also: Białystok Voivodeship (1919–39) and Białystok Voivodeship (1975–1998)"
Białystok Voivodeship () was a unit of administrative division and local government in Poland from 1945 to 1975, when its purview was separated into eastern Suwałki Voivodeship, Łomża Voivodeship and Białystok Voivodeship (1975-1998). Its capital city was Białystok. The establishment of Podlaskie Voivodeship in 1999 was essentially a reunion of the areas of Białystok Voivodeship (1945-1975).
Area administrative region of 1950, amounted to 23 201 square kilometers, was later reduced to 23 153 square kilometers. The population was in 1946, approximately 941 000, in 1970 approximately 1 176 000 inhabitants.
History.
In early 1944, when the Red Army crossed the Polish frontier before the war, the Bialystok Voivodeship was divided administratively by the German occupied areas incorporated into the Third Reich (Bezirk Bialystok) and the occupied territories of the USSR (Reich Commissariat East).
Over the next months, the front was moving into the pre-war Polish territory. However, according to the findings of the Tehran Conference of 1943 it was known that the pre-war Polish eastern territories will be incorporated into the Soviet Union and eastern territories of Germany will be incorporated into Polish (more precisely define these territorial changes occurred during the Yalta Conference and the Potsdam Conference ). For this reason, the Polish territories occupied by the Red Army in early 1944 did not create the Polish administration. Only after crossing the line in July 1944 the Bug, which is the future eastern border of Polish, Polish authorities have been established in the form of the Polish Committee of National Liberation (PCNL) .
A month after the start of its operations PCNL issued Decree of the Polish Committee of National Liberation of August 21, 1944 on the Procedure for the appointment of general administration authorities and second instance, which came into force on 22 August 1944. In this decree (Article 11) abolished the administrative structure introduced by Germany and restored the Bialystok Voivodeship administrative divisions during the Second Polish Republic. At the time, ran on the front line of the Vistula and Narew, and the formal authority PKWN had was only part of the pre-war Bialystok Voivodeship.
29 September 1944, administration of 17 (of the 23) districts of Belastok Region (including the city of Białystok) and an additional three (Siemiatycze, Hajnówka and Kleszczele) of the Brest Region was passed to the Polish Committee of National Liberation from the BSSR.
31 December 1944 the Provisional Government of the Polish Republic replaced the Polish Committee of National Liberation.
14 March 1945 the Provisional Government of the Republic of Polish made the initial administrative division of the German lands included in the Polish (so-called Recovered Territories ), even before taking all of these areas, creating them four administrative districts do not have the status of regions: Region I (Opole Silesia), District II (Lower Silesia), District III (West Pomerania), District IV (Mazury).
The Border Agreement between Poland and the USSR of 16 August 1945 established the borders between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) and the Republic of Poland. It was signed by the Provisional Government of National Unity ().
August 18, 1945 transferred Lomza County from the Warsaw Voivodeship to the Białystok Voivodeship.
September 25, 1945 part of the counties of the Recovered Territories transmitted under the management of the Białystok Voivodeship (Gołdap, Ełk and Olecko) from District IV (Mazury). These districts have provisionally become parts of the Voivodeship, although de jure continue to form part of Recovered Territories (MP, 1945 No. 29, item. 77). On June 28, 1946, the areas of the Recovered Territories assigned to Białystok Voivodeship were formally transferred.
Some cities lost civic rights without joining larger neighboring cities: Dąbrowa Białostocka*, Kleszczele*, Krynki, Sokoły, Suchowola*, Tykocin* (1950)
1 July 1952 created Siemiatycze County.
1954 the following Counties were created: hajnowski, łapy, moniecki, zambrow 
Between 1954 and 1972, gromadas formed the lowest tier of local government in the voivodeship, taking over the role previously played by gminas. A gromada would generally consist of several villages, but they were smaller units than the gminas had been. In 1973 gminas were reintroduced and gromadas abolished.
1956 the following counties were created: dąbrowski (białostocki), sejneński

DRG Class 44

The Class 44 (German: "Baureihe 44" or "BR 44") was a ten-coupled, heavy goods train steam locomotive built for the Deutsche Reichsbahn as a standard steam engine class ("Einheitsdampflokomotive"). Its sub-class was G 56.20 and it had triple cylinders. It was intended for hauling goods trains of up to on the routes through Germany's hilly regions ("Mittelgebirge") and up to on steep inclines.
History.
The first 10 examples were built in 1926. These engines had a somewhat higher steam consumption than the first ten units of the DRG Class 43 procured in parallel for comparison purposes, and which were equipped with two cylinders. Not until 1937 were further 44s procured, because by then the rising demands of rail transportation could be better met with a triple-cylinder configuration.
From 1926 to 1949, a total of 1,989 locomotives were manufactured. During the Second World War an austerity variant was built with simplified construction and delivery, known as the Class 44ÜK (one of the so-called "Übergangskriegslokomotive"). This primarily used home-produced materials; components were simplified, both in manufacturing methods and design, or left out completely. The most striking features of the ÜK locomotives were the omission of the smoke deflectors (that from 44 013 was standard) and also the forward side windows of the driver's cab.
After the war, Class 44 locomotives remained with the following railway administrations:
The Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB) gave 9 engines back to the Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) in 1952. The DB transferred at least 291 engines to the French railways SNCF as reparations. These were predominantly locomotives that had been built in France. The SNCF sold on 48 engines in 1955 to the Turkish State Railway (TCDD).
Until their replacement by modern diesel and electric locomotives, the Class 44 engines were the backbone of heavy goods train duties in Germany.
German railwaymen nicknamed the Class 44 locomotive the "Jumbo" because of its power. Only the rebuilt ("Reko") locomotives of East Germany's Class 58.30, converted between 1958 and 1962, attained the performance of the Class 44s, at least on the plains.
Construction.
The top speed of the standard variant was 80 km/h, the prototypes (44 001 to 44 010) were permitted to run at 70 km/h. The engine is designed as a 3-cylinder locomotive with one cylinder located in the middle. The outside cylinders drive the third axle, the inside one drives the second.
Standard 2'2' T 32 and 2'2' T 34 tenders were used. Both types held 10 tons of coal.
Variants.
The Class 44 used a lot of steam and correspondingly large amounts of coal. In order to simplify the work and hold its power steady, 32 locomotives were converted to oil-firing by the DB in 1958 and 91 by the DR in 1963. With oil firing the viscous, heavy oil, almost solid when cold, is liquefied by a jet of steam, atomised and then combusted. The job of the stoker consists of starting the burner, greasing and pumping.
The DB's oil-fired locomotives ran under the classification 043 in the new EDP-generated numbering scheme of 1968 until they were retired. These numbers were spare because all DRG Class 43 engines belonged to the DR's fleet. The engines with grate firing were given the designation 044.
The DR converted 20 locomotives to Wendler coal dust firing. These proved themselves well on the ramps of the Thuringian Forest with their precise firing. However no more locomotives were converted, as oil-firing was generally favoured because it enabled unrestricted operations.
Following the 1973 oil crisis, all oil-fired engines in the DR were reconverted to coal-firing, because they were indispensable for operations. They were given the old operating numbers that they had had before their modification to oil-firing. In the DB, they were not reconverted because they were soon due for retirement. The last coal-fired Class 44 locomotive with the DB was taken out of service in 1977 at the Gelsenkirchen-Bismarck shed.
On its final journey, number 043 903-4 hauled train 81453 (consisting of a breakdown train equipment wagon) from Oldersum to Emden on 26 October 1977 for the "Neubauamt Nord". It was the last schedule steam service in the Deutsche Bundesbahn.
Preserved Locomotives.
At present there are still two working "44s" in the world. At the 'traditional locomotive shed' at Stassfurt ("Traditionsbetriebswerk Staßfurt"), stands number 44 1486, the only current representative of her class in Germany. In addition, number 44 1593 remains operational with the Veluwsche Stoomtrein Maatschappij (VSM) in Beekbergen, Netherlands.
The following non-working Class 44s can be visited in various German railway museums:
Monuments include:
Details of other locomotives are given in the list of preserved steam locomotives in Germany.
Trial Locomotives.
In 1932 and 1933 the firm of Henschel built two trial locomotives designed for a raised boiler overpressure of 25 bar and equipped with four-cylinder compounding, which were also incorporated into Class 44. The two engines, which initially ran under the numbers M 01 1004 and M 01 1005, and later as 44 011 and 44 012, were certainly very powerful, but also high-maintenance. As a result the initial boiler pressure of 25 bar was quickly reduced to 16 bar. 
After the Second World War, number 44 011 went to the Deutsche Bundesbahn and 44 012 to the DR. The DB engine, being a one-off, was retired as early as 1950. Number 44 012 was operated by the FVA Halle as a braking locomotive and not retired until 1962. 
In 1975, the repair shop at Brunswick fitted a Riggenbach counter-pressure brake to 44 404. The Bundesbahn Federal Railway Office in Minden used this engine as a braking engine to test new electric locomotives. In 1977 it was retired. It stands today in the Darmstadt-Kranichstein Railway Museum.

Construction began May 7, 2008, and the casino opened to the general public on August 5, 2009 at 10 a.m. Construction was a joint venture between Shingobee Builders and Clark Construction. 
The casino has a huge electronic sign on the I-94 freeway, the heavily traveled corridor between Detroit and Chicago. The sign itself is tall by wide by deep, and the total structure weighs more than . The electronic display unit on the sign is tall by wide. It is double sided (there is one unit on each side of the sign), and each side has 43,000 full-color pixels. The sign is capable of displaying 281 trillion colors, significantly more than the human eye can distinguish. Content is sent via wireless broad band communication from the casino marketing office. The sign uses energy-saving LED technology, and the cost of its energy consumption will be about $17.59 per day. More than 47,000 vehicles travel pass the FireKeepers Casino location daily, and the sign is expected to be seen by more than 66,000 persons each day.
The casino itself has 2,900 state-of-the art slot machines, and 76 table games, including blackjack, roulette, craps, big six and baccarat. It has five restaurants, including a buffet, and also a sports bar and cabaret. The gaming floor occupies , and there are 3,000 parking spaces, 2,080 of them in a covered garage. Casino officials have had over 20,000 applicants for 1,500 positions before opening.
FireKeepers was developed by Gaming Entertainment Michigan (GEM), a joint venture of gaming operator Full House Resorts and real estate developer Robert Mathewson. From its opening, GEM signed an agreement to manage the casino through August 2016, receiving 26 percent of net income. The Nottawaseppi Huron Band bought out the agreement four years early for $97.5 million, and took over management in May 2012.
An eight-story, 242-room hotel opened in December 2012. The expansion also included an event center, a new restaurant, and a smoke-free gaming area.

(It was later amended to a maximum of 6 members in 1997 GE By far in 2008 (2006 GE), no opposition candidates have ever won a GRC yet.
The aim of the GRC is to allow minorities to be elected and represented in parliament more easily despite opposition critics of being unfair.
With the system of GRC, the divisions has drastically reduced (Up to 3 / 4 seats counted as 1 division in GRC), despite actual division is 81.

Sheffield Software Engineering Observatory

The Sheffield Software Engineering Observatory (Observatory) was founded in 2005 by an EPSRC grant at the University of Sheffield. The Observatory is a multi-disciplinary collaboration between the Department of Computer Science and the Institute of Work Psychology at the University of Sheffield.
Overview.
Its aim is to understand the processes that make for good software engineering practice, and how these need to combine human and technical factors.
The Software Engineering Observatory is an empirical software engineering research facility where researchers can use a variety of methodologies to study software developers working on real industrial projects. The software developers are students, both undergraduate and postgraduate and up to 20 group projects are undertaken each year. Thus, researchers can investigate how software developers work in teams, deal with industrial clients and handle the plethora of problems that arise in group projects with tight time-scales.
A key feature is that the Observatory allows multiple teams to work on identical projects concurrently in competition with each other, which allows comparisons to be made of different software development processes.
The Observatory enables researchers to gather data that are relevant to many of the key issues in contemporary software engineering, which will be of interest to both academics and practitioners. The implications of the results so far are that effective software managers must not just understand the technical aspects of the work that their staff are doing, but must also understand their staff as individuals and how they can best work together in teams.
Research areas.
The Observatory’s research agenda includes:
The data from these experiments will be made available to bona-fide researchers in empirical software engineering.
History.
The Observatory was founded in 2005, however prior to that a number of PhD students designed experiments and collected data on the software engineering process. These were all based on the pioneering taught courses devised at the University of Sheffield

The Golden Blade

The Golden Blade is an adventure film from 1953 directed by Nathan Juran and starring Rock Hudson as Harun Al-Rashid and Piper Laurie as Princess Khairuzan. It is set in ancient Bagdad and borrows from the Arabic fairy tales of "One Thousand and One Nights" as well as the myth of King Arthur and the Sword in the Stone.
Plot.
The movie opens with a raging desert battle between the cities of Basra and Baghdad, during which Harun's (Rock Hudson)father, Basran is fatally wounded. Before he dies, he gives his son a medallion he has pulled from his killer's neck, and urges him to somehow end the senseless killings.
Harun rides to Bagdad, where he meets the beautiful Khairuzan (Piper Laurie), who tries to sell clothes to shopkeeper Barcus (Steven Geray). He bargains with Barcus that for 10 dinars, he can pick any item in the shop. Under a pile of rags, he finds a golden sword that seems to somehow call him. Khairuzan ignites a riot when she defends the citizens of Basra. Barcus watches in awe as Harun cuts solid metal in half with his golden sword. As soon as soldiers appear and spirit Khairuzan away, the fighting stops, and Harun finds a medallion on the ground identical to the one his father gave him. 
Barcus discovers that the sword will cut through iron only when Harun wields it. He warns Harun to be careful until they can translate the inscriptions on its blade and discover all its powers.
Meanwhile, in the palace, sinister Vizier Jafar (George Macready) urges Badgad's Caliph to fight Basra, but the Caliph refuses. Khairuzan, who is in fact the princess, is soon brought in by her guard, Jafar's dim-witted son Hadi (Gene Evans). Jafar convinces the Caliph that Khairuzan's headstrong ways may be tamed by marriage to his son, then later plots with Hadi to undermine the Caliph by inciting more battles against Basra. When Khairuzan learns of the arranged marriage, she escapes again and disguises herself as a boy. Harun is waiting outside for an audience with Jafar, and when the guards spot Khairuzan, she steals Harun's horse. She is finally caught by both Hadi and Harun, who begin a fight which Harun wins. He discovers that he is actually invincible while wielding the golden sword.
Khairuzan claims to be a boy slave and Harun brings her to the city, where she eavesdrops as Barcus reveals that the sword's first inscription promises that whoever unsheathes the sword will gain the throne. Later, Harun, realizing that Khairuzan is a girl, protects her when a guard questions them, and they are both thrown to the dungeon, where they fall in love and kiss. After a minor quarrel, Khairuzan makes herself known to the guards and moves back to her harem. Knowing of the sword's magical powers, she declares that only the winner of a tournament may claim her hand. She names Harun as her guard, and although he is infuriated to discover she is a princess and he her servant, he later watches admiringly as she is very kind to the poor townspeople.
Meanwhile, Khairuzan's handmaiden, Bakhamra (Kathleen Hughes), informs Hadi about the magic sword, and he and his father steal it by creating a replica and then drugging Harun in order to switch the two. Khairuzan wakes Harun from his stupor and later asks him why he has not yet signed up for the tournament. When she disagrees with his response that he is not aristocratic enough to marry her, he kisses her. He then races to Barcus to proclaim his newfound joy, and refuses to listen when Barcus warns him that the second inscription counsels that the bearer's true reward will arrive in a grave of stone. 
At the tournament, Hadi tampers with Harun's saddle. Quickly, all but Hadi and Harun are eliminated from the contest, and Hadi finally wins by throwing Harun from his saddle. 
Harun realizes his sword was switched and suspects Khairuzan. He breaks into the palace and finds Bakhamra, who has just been jilted by Hadi and so reveals his scheme to Harun. Harun locates Hadi just as he is about to bring his unwilling bride to bed, and fights with him. He is captured by Hadi's guards and brought before Jafar. Bakhamra and the Caliph overhear the vizier plan to kill them and blame Harun. When the Caliph orders Jafar arrested, the vizier brings out his medallion, which is the same as the one Harun carries, and tries to kill the Caliph with the magic sword, but it slices into a stone pillar and remains stuck there. The guards kill the Caliph, but Harun and Khairuzan escape by fooling the guards into believing they have died.
Jafar and Hadi soon discover that they cannot pull the sword out of the column and call men in from across Bagdad to attempt to pull it out. While Khairuzan gathers the townspeople around her, Harun and Barcus sneak back into the palace. Harun fights with the guards and is almost captured when Khairuzan rouses the people to storm the palace. He grabs the sword from the stone, causing it to collapse on top of Jafar and Hadi. Khairuzan bestows on Harun the title "Al-Rhashid" (the righteous). Then they kiss.

Duke of Guimarães

Duke of Guimarães was an Nobility title granted by King Afonso V of Portugal in 1475, to Ferdinand II, 3rd Duke of Braganza. The king just upgraded the previous title of count of Guimarães, that he granted to the same Duke of Braganza, some years before (in 1464).
When Isabel of Braganza married Infante Duarte, King Manuel I of Portugal youngest son, her brother, Teodósio I, Duke of Braganza ceded the dukedom as her dowry, and Duarte became the 4th duke of Guimarães. As their son (Duarte II, 5th duke of Guimarães) died without issue, the dukedom returned to the crown, but was soon granted again to the House of Braganza, when king Philip III of Portugal, gave it to John II, 8th Duke of Braganza.

José Alonso (trade unionist)

José Alonso (February 6, 1917August 27, 1970) was an Argentine politician and trade-unionist.
Early life.
José Alonso was born in the Montserrat section of Buenos Aires, in 1917. The son of a Spanish tailor, he dedicated himself to the same profession, and was first elected as a union delegate of the tailors in 1938. Alonso initially supported socialism and Alfredo Palacios, but balked from the Socialist Party of Argentina in his support for the populist Colonel Juan Perón, Secretary of Labor of Pedro Pablo Ramírez' military government in power since June 4, 1943.
On March 23, 1943, Alonso created the SOIVA ("Sindicato de la Industria del Vestido de la Capital Federal", Trade-Union of Garnment Industry of Capital Federal) textile trade-union to counter the influence of the communist "Federación Obrera del Vestido" (FOV, Workers' Federation of Garnment). Supported by Perón, the SOIVA soon became one of the strongest trade-unions of Argentina. Again, in 1945 and also with support of the military "junta", Alonso founded the FONIVA ("Federación Obrera Nacional de la Industria del Vestido") national federation, and became its vice-secretary.
During the Peronist government.
José Alonso, elected secretary of the SOIVA in 1946, became part of the Confederal Central Committee of the CGT trade union. He travelled abroad, being delegate of Argentine workers' in several conferences of the International Labour Organization (ILO) and took part in the formation of the "ATLAS" ("Agrupación de Trabajadores Latinoamericanos Sindicalistas", a Latin American trade-union confederation) in 1952.
He married at that time María Luisa Pinella, another trade-unionist who had earned Eva Perón's trust.
José Alonso then participated, along with other unionist leaders, as representant of the CGT, to the First National Congress of Philosophy, in Mendoza (March–April 1949), which contributed to set the bases of the Peronist movement.
He also collaborated to the creation of the FATRE ("Federación Argentina de Trabajadores Rurales y Estibadores") and was a member of the directorship of the "Fundación Eva Perón" from 1952 to 1955, as well as secretary of the directorship of the EPASA, which published "La Prensa" and other newspapers.
Alonso was elected deputy of the Capital Federal from 1952 to 1955. He participated to the elaboration of the law on collective bargaining and the law on the pay of free day for workers working at home.
"Revolución Libertadora".
Following the 1955 "Revolución Libertadora", a military coup which ousted Perón, Alonso was detained, before being unexpectedly released on 25 June 1956. Apparently that was an error, and the "junta" tried to capture him again, but Alonso managed to join Perón in his Venezuelan exile. He then participated to the negotiations between Perón and Rogelio Frigerio, who represented presidential candidate Arturo Frondizi of the UCRI. These negotiations resulted in Perón's decisive endorsement of Frondizi in the 1958 presidential elections.
Alonso returned to Argentina in 1957, and was again detained, for several months, following the strike in the "Frigorífico Nacional Lisandro de la Torre". He then tried to re-organize his former group of textile workers, as the trade-union had been put under federal receivership by the dictatorship. Frondizi would win the February 1958 elections, and would gradually restore the CGT to its former, independent status.
In March 1960, he was again elected as secretary general, and participated in the "CGT de la Resistencia", headed by the steelworker Armando Cabo (the father of Dardo Cabo, who would join the Montoneros). He authorized his union's adhesion to the "62 Organizaciones", a Peronist trade-union association created following the 1957 CGT Congress.
General Secretary of the CGT.
Alonso became a member of the "Commission of the 20", a unionist organization which gathered Peronists and independents, and headed the CGT following its legalization by Frondizi's government on February 28, 1961. Until 1963, the CGT was not completely institutionally normalized. President José María Guido authorized the CGT Normalization Congress in 1963. One hundred trade unions participated, and because the 62 Organizations supported José Alonso as candidate for Secretary General of the CGT, he was thus elected on February 1, 1963.
Alonso supported at first political reforms issued by Arturo Illia's new president (1963-1966), such as the cancelling of oil contracts subscribed by Frondizi. But on December 4, 1963, he presented a 15 points petition list, which requested increased wages, rupture with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), active participation of workers' in the state firms and the elimination of unemployment.
A few days later, he started his speech in La Boca by declaring: "Viva 1964 because it is the year in which Perón will return to the country." He then headed the CGT's struggle against Illia's policies ("Plan de Acción"), between March 1964 and July 1965. On 21 May 1964, around 80 factories of the Greater Buenos Aires were occupied, and 6 other strikes were organized under the CGT's leadership, followed by 3,900,000 workers and 11,000 working sites.
The plan, initially supported by independents among the CGT, then lead to the resignation of the graphist and vice-secretary general of the CGT, Héctor Riego Ribas, who opposed himself to the mobilization in favor of Perón's return.
"Operativo Retorno" and the break with Vandor.
In December 1964, Alonso participated to the organization of "Operativo Retorno" (Operation Return), aimed at bringing back Perón from exile. The Operation was defeated however by the government.
In 1965, he was reelected as representant of the CGT, and began to break with the steelworker Augusto Vandor, who headed the 62 Organizations and wanted more independence from Perón's directives, launching the famous the "mot d'ordre" "A Peronism without Perón". Along with Lorenzo Pepe, Andrés Framini and Amado Olmos, he established the anti-Vandor "62 Organizations Standing with Perón".
When María Estela Martínez, Perón's third wife, travelled to Argentina to head the opposition to Vandor, Alonso became her main counsellor. Meanwhile, the government and the military supported internal struggles among the CGT, particularly following Labor Minister Rubens San Sebastián's implementation of a "divide and conquer" policy, around 1966.
Despite open support from Perón and his wife, José Alonso lost his functions at the CGT on 2 February 1966, under pressures from the Vandoristas, and was replaced by Fernando Donaires.
The CGT General Congress then named as general secretary Francisco Prado, a man from the Light and Power Workers' ("Luz y Fuerza") trade-union - aliies of Vandor.
Alonso then decided a new turn. Using his good relationship with the diplomacy, the Church and the Armed Forces, he supported a coup d'État against Arturo Illia's elected government, and managed to reach an agreement with Vandor, both unified in a common criticisms of liberal democracy.
Onganía's dictatorship.
Following Juan Carlos Onganía's military coup of June 28, 1966, Alonso declared: "We congratulate ourselves in having witnessed the fall of the last bourgeois liberal government, because it will never be able to establish itself here again.".
The main trade unionist leaders, Vandor, Prado, Light and Power workers' leader Juan José Taccone, and Alonso attended the inaugural of the new "de facto" President Onganía. Along with Rogelio Coria, José Alonso participated to the "Nueva Corriente de Opinión", which, headed by Taccone, supported a "partipationist" or "collaborationist" attitude toward the military regime. A new tendency, opposed to the latter, formed in the workers' movement, headed by Amado Olmos, Raimundo Ongaro, Julio Guillán, Jorge Di Pasquale, Ricardo De Luca, Atilio Santillán, and Agustín Tosco.
However, trade unionists, and in particular José Alonso, began to oppose themselves to Onganía's dictatorship following Perón 's public condemnation of the military regime in September 1966. On November 21, 1966, Alonso stated that the military's policies were handing out the country to foreign hands.
The break with the military "junta" became definitive with the nomination of the orthodox liberal Adalbert Krieger Vasena to the Economic and Labor Ministry, in December 1966. The government began to detain trade unionists. Francisco Prado resigned from his functions as CGT general secretary in May 1967, and called a Normalization Congress at the end of March 1968. The radical tendency, opposed to collaboration with the military, won the elections, and the print workers' leader, Raimundo Ongaro, was elected general secretary. Since the "participationists" (Vander, Alonso, etc.) retained control of the CGT's headquarters, Ongaro headed a split, leading to the creation of the "CGT de los Argentinos".
In this context, the Cordobazo riots of 1969 erupted, followed by the assassination of Vandor on June 30, 1969. Ongaro's CGT de los Argentinos was outlawed, while the CGT itself was temporarily suspended. On July 4, 1970, the right-wing unionist and steelworker José Ignacio Rucci was elected general secretary of the CGT.
Assassination.
Alonso was assassinated on August 27, 1970 by Montoneros militants, although the crime has never been solved. He was buried in La Chacarita Cemetery.

Minimum weight

In error-correcting coding, the minimum Hamming weight, commonly referred to as the minimum weight "w"min of a code is the weight of the lowest-weight code word. The weight "w" of a code word is the number of 1s in the word. For example the word 11001010 has a weight of 4. 
In a linear block code the minimum weight is also the minimum Hamming distance ("d"min) and defines the error correction capability of the code. If "w"min = "n", then "d"min = "n" and the code will correct up to "d"min/2 errors.

USS ATA-215

USS "ATA-215 was an of the United States Navy built near the end of World War II. Originally laid down as Paloverde" (YN-86), a net tender of the , she was redesignated as AN-65, a net layer, before launch. Before completion, the name "Paloverde" was cancelled and the ship was named "ATA-215", an unnamed auxiliary ocean tug. Post-war she was assigned to the Finn Ronne Antarctic Expedition where she became stuck in the ice for 12 months before returning to the United States for decommissioning.
Career.
"Paloverde", originally designated "YN–86", was laid down on 19 July 1943 as "AN–65" by Snow Shipyards, Inc., Rockland, Maine; renamed and redesignated "ATA–215" on 12 August 1944; launched 2 September 1944; sponsored by Miss Patricia Adams; and placed in service 17 December 1944.
"ATA–215" was assigned to Service Squadron 2, U.S. Pacific Fleet. She proceeded to Norfolk, Virginia, where she arrived 2 January 1945. Then, getting underway for the U.S. West Coast, she transited the Panama Canal 19–20 February and arrived San Pedro, California, 19 March. She proceeded to Pearl Harbor on a towing assignment, arriving 26 March. 
She remained at Pearl Harbor until departing for Eniwetok 11 May, and arrived at Leyte 18 June. On 28 June she proceeded back across the Pacific via Eniwetok for Pearl Harbor. In Pearl Harbor after the war, she was designated for disposal in March 1946.
Later in 1946, Congressional action provided "ATA–215" to the Finn Ronne Antarctic Expedition on a loan basis. On 25 January 1947 Edith Ronne rechristened "ATA-215" the "Port of Beaumont", and the ship shoved off with 21 explorers for the Antarctic. She returned to New York City 15 months later after spending 12 months frozen in the ice pack of Marguerite Bay on the Palmer Peninsula. 
She was struck from the Navy List December 1948 and was sold by the Navy 8 February 1949.

Harold Holzer

Harold Holzer (born February 5, 1949) is a scholar of Abraham Lincoln and the political culture of the American Civil War Era. He served for nine years as co-chairman of the United States Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission (ALBC), appointed to the commission by President Bill Clinton in 2000 and elected co-chair by his fellow commissioners. In June 2010, he was elected chairman of the ALBC's successor organization, The Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Foundation. In his professional career, Holzer serves as Senior Vice President for Public Affairs at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, where he is chief spokesman and holds responsibility for government relations, admissions, visitor services, and multicultural audience development at the nation's largest art institution. In 2012, he was named a Roger Hertog Fellow at The New-York Historical Society and served as a script consultant to the Steven Spielberg film, "Lincoln".
Life and career.
In his work as a historian, Holzer has authored, co-authored, and edited 46 books, and contributed more than 500 articles to magazines and journals, plus chapters and forewords for 54 additional books. He is a frequent guest on television (C-Span, A&E, The History Channel, and PBS including on "Bill Moyers Journal" and bicentennial-year documentaries on a variety of networks). He also lectures, and has curated six museum exhibitions, including three shows of Lincoln art at the former Lincoln Museum in Fort Wayne, Indiana. He served as chief historian for the exhibition "Lincoln and New York" at the New-York Historical Society, October 2009-March 2010 and co-organized "The First Step to Freedom," a multi-city, sesquicentennial exhibition of Lincoln's original Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, which debuted at The Schomburg Library in Harlem on September 22, 2012. He has performed, throughout the nation, stage programs entitled "Lincoln Seen and Heard," "The Lincoln Family Album," "Lincoln in American Memory," and "Grant Seen and Heard"—combining period pictures with authentic words—with such actors as Sam Waterston, Liam Neeson, Richard Dreyfuss, Stephen Lang, Holly Hunter, and Dianne Wiest. The programs have been staged at such venues as: the White House, the George H. W. Bush Presidential Library, The William J. Clinton Presidential Library, Lincoln Center in New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Library of Congress, the Lincoln Association of Los Angeles, The Lincoln Forum at Gettysburg, Ford's Theatre, site of the Lincoln assassination, and The U.S. Capitol.
Before joining the Metropolitan Museum in 1992, Holzer was special counselor to the New York State economic development director in the administration of Governor Mario M. Cuomo (with whom he co-edited the 1990 book, "Lincoln on Democracy," which has now been translated into four languages). Before that, he was director of communications at WNET/Channel 13, the flagship PBS station in New York, and in the 1970s, served as a political press secretary—first to Rep. Bella S. Abzug (D-NY) in Congress and in her campaigns for the U. S. Senate and Mayor of New York; and in the 1977 general election mayoral campaign of Mr. Cuomo. Holzer started his career as a reporter, later editor, for the onetime news weekly the "Manhattan Tribune."
In 2008, Holzer received the National Humanities Medal from President Bush and the National Endowment for the Humanities and The Lincoln Medal of Honor from the Lincoln Society of Springfield, Illinois. He also won a second-place 2005 Lincoln Prize (for "Lincoln at Cooper Union"). For his book "Lincoln President-Elect," Holzer received awards from The Lincoln Group of New York, The Civil War Round Table of New York, and The Illinois State Historical Society. His young readers' book, "Father Abraham: Lincoln and His Sons," won the first James Robertson Jr. Award for Civil War Children's Literature from The Civil War Round Table of New York. He has also won lifetime achievement awards from The Civil War Round Tables of New York and Chicago, and Lincoln groups in Washington and New York. He won the DAR History Award Medal in 2012. In 2013, he wrote the Lincoln-Emancipation essay for the official program for the re-inauguration of President Barack Obama. 
Appearances.
A frequent guest on television, Holzer has appeared on C-SPAN's "Washington Journal" and its 2009 documentary special on The White House. He has also appeared on The History Channel, PBS, "The Today Show", "Bill Moyers Journal", "CBS Sunday Morning", "Morning Joe", "The Lou Dobbs Show", and "The Charlie Rose Show". C-SPAN has broadcast Holzer's stage presentation "Lincoln Seen and Heard" with Sam Waterston and "Grant Seen and Heard" with Richard Dreyfuss among many others. In February 2005, President and Mrs. Bush hosted a special Lincoln's birthday-eve performance of "Lincoln Seen and Heard" with Holzer and Waterston, telecast live from the White House. During the Lincoln bicentennial, he appeared on such documentaries as "Stealing Lincoln's Body," "The Lincoln Assassination," "Looking for Lincoln," and "Lincoln: American Mastermind." He's featured in the forthcoming major documentary film "The Gettysburg Address."

List of sarcopterygian genera

This list of lobe-finned fish is a comprehensive listing of all genera that have ever been included in the class Sarcopterygii, excluding purely vernacular terms. The list includes all commonly accepted genera, but also genera that are now considered invalid, doubtful ("nomen dubium"), or were not formally published ("nomen nudum"), as well as junior synonyms.
Scope and terminology.
There is no official, canonical list of lobe-finned fish genera but one of the most thorough attempts can be found on the "Sarcopterygii" section of Mikko Haaramo's Phylogeny Archive. 
Authors and Year.
The authors column lists the authors of the formal description responsible for the erection of the genus listed. They are not necessarily the same as the authors of the type species as sometimes a species from one genus is determined sufficiently distinct to warrant the erection of a new genus to house it. If this is the case, only the latter authors will be listed. The year column notes the year the description was published.
Status.
Naming conventions and terminology follow the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. Technical terms used include:
Age.
The age column denotes the epoch of geologic time to which the fossils date. The abbreviations are as follows.
Genera that are invalid, misidentified, or otherwise do not represent a valid sarcopterygian are listed as age N/A because there was never a time in which a sarcopterygian by that generic name actually lived.
Location and Notes.
The location column designates the geographic region where remains of the relevant genus have been found. The regions used are continents except in the case of smaller landmasses (e.g. Cuba). Political bodies, being non-existent in the Mesozoic are not used to indicate genera locations. Genera that are invalid, misidentified, or otherwise do not represent a valid sarcopterygian are listed as location N/A because there was never a place in which a sarcopterygian by that generic name actually lived. Extant marine sarcopterygians are listed by ocean. Extant freshwater sarcopterygians are listed by continent. The notes column is a collection of annotations on the scientific significance and taxonomic history of listed genera, as well as elaborations on the information presented in other columns.

Aitken House

Aitken House is a Canadian all-male residence, located on the University of New Brunswick's Fredericton campus. It was established in 1958 and has since been a prominent member of UNB's residence community. The house holds many traditions such as their Club Med beach party, their house dance to the song "Shout" by the Isley Brothers, and their house cheer. Aitken House is the only residence at UNB to have their own alumni association, and has recently celebrated their 55th anniversary, which saw Aitken brothers from 1958-2013 attend.
History.
Built in 1958 with funding provided by Maxwell Aitken A.K.A. Lord Beaverbrook, Aitken house was the second residence to be built on the UNB Fredericton campus.
In the Winter of 2007 UNB Residential Life & Conferencing Services decided that due to a lack of enrollment in residence, they would close Aitken House and attempt to sell it to the University to be turned into an academic building. Although the residence community had seen many buildings come and go throughout its lifetime, the residents and alumni of Aitken House were not ready to let it go without a fight. The majority of the residence community showed their support to keep Aitken House alive through painting red A's in their windows, flying banners, and attending meetings. There were also those who supported reslife's position and the campus newspaper's letters to the editor section was filled with controversy every week. Throughout the remainder of that academic year the supporters of Aitken appealed at many meetings to stop the sale of the house. But to their dismay they were unable to stop it along the way. It progressed all the way through to the UNB Board of Governor's (BOG) meeting, a step that is usually just a formality. Traditionally only the members of the BOG are allowed to be present during a meeting but they allowed the house to make a presentation as to why the residence building should be spared. As the members of the BOG entered the Wu Center for their meeting they were greeted by Aitken House residents and supporters mainly from other residences at UNB; all lined up beside each entrance. The meeting went on for hours and everyone went to wait for the final word back at Aitken House. For the first time in UNB BOG's history, a decision was overturned and the House was saved.
It has been proven, over 55 years, that all the men of Aitken are, in fact, gentlemen and 'beauties'.
Sports.
Aitken house competes in many of UNB's intramural athletics. Every year the house is found at such sporting events as:
Outdoor & Indoor Soccer
Softball & Co-Rec Softball
Flag football
Volleyball & Co-Rec Volleyball
Basketball
Water Polo
Ball Hockey & Ice Hockey
Co-Rec Ultimate Frisbee
Aitken house always has a good showing at each sporting event, and often is number one among the other UNB residences.

The Robot Johnson Show

The Robot Johnson Show is a weekly sketch comedy show put together by the members of Robot Johnson, based out of Charlotte, North Carolina. The show format consists of sketches, commercial and song parodies and original comedy songs, and lasts roughly an hour and ten minutes. Founded by Sean Keenan and A. Blaine Miller, two original members of Charlotte stalwart comedy group The Perch, Robot Johnson is made up of Perch alumni along with local actors and comedians. Relying on local humor and pushing the envelope on racial, sexual and political issues, Robot Johnson claims to provide "good humor by bad people."
History.
The initial concept for The Robot Johnson Show came out of a series of conversations Keenan had with Douglas Young, Director of Theatrical Programming of the North Carolina Blumenthal Performing Arts Center, of which Spirit Square is a part. Given the previous success of The Perch (which had folded in 2006 after eleven years of performing in Charlotte) and Keenan's national notoriety as the voice and puppeteer of MTV2 character The Talking Baby, Young thought that the time was right to start a new sketch comedy troupe in the city. Although initially reluctant to get involved, Keenan eventually agreed, calling Miller to gauge interest in the foundation of a new group. The Robot Johnson Show debuted in the Charlotte Comedy Theatre on December 7, 2007, with its first show including favorites like "Quay Rogers: Surrogate Black Guy," "Of Maple Leaves and Human Suffering," and "The Incredibly Sad Indian."
Present.
Currently, Robot Johnson is performing at Wine Up in Charlotte, NC and is a touring company across both North and South Carolina.
Cast.
The current cast and writing staff of The Robot Johnson Show is as follows:
The Talking Baby.
The Talking Baby is described by creator Sean Keenan as an "R-rated puppet show," though the baby in question is not actually a puppet but rather an anatomically correct baby doll. During the Talking Baby segments, audience members are able to see Keenan's hand as he operates the baby, changing its hand positions and turning its head. The ostensible function of Talking Baby is to review movies, but the character often goes off on tangents about characters, actors, directors or concepts involved in the movie and quite often has not seen the movies he reviews. The Talking Baby segment is the raunchiest and most profanity-laden of each show, with the Baby promising to "clean it up" for children and the elderly before descending into a tirade of obscenity. One of the most popular sketches in the show, Talking Baby was eventually made the spokesman for MTV2 in the early 2000s. The sketch typically starts out with Disembodied Voice paraphrasing a pop song to introduce the baby (one segment featured Disembodied Voice singing the entire first verse to "More Than Words" by Extreme) before introducing the first film to be reviewed.
Partnerships and media appearances.
At their July 26 shows, Robot Johnson filmed a national 30-minute pilot. As of February 2009, the pilot is in post-production and there are plans to shop it to two major networks as well as smaller cable stations. Robot Johnson recently launched its own YouTube channel and plans are in the works for a national tour as well as a comedy album.
In September 2008, the troupe partnered with Collaborative Arts Theatre to produce "SITCOMS LIVE," which featured three weeks of three separate sitcoms from the latter half of the twentieth century, including episodes of "Three's Company," "The Facts of Life," and "Married...With Children." Robot Johnson performed the commercial breaks for each sitcom, along with a new hour-long sketch comedy show after each performance. The following year, The Robot Johnson Show received the Metrolina Theatre Award (MTA) for "Other Exemplary Performance/Element - Comedy" for its contribution to "SITCOMS LIVE."
On September 21, 2008 Robot Johnson announced that they would move back into The Charlotte Comedy Theatre in October of that year to begin workshopping shows for 2009.
In February 2009, Robot Johnson partnered with Charlotte photography museum The Light Factory to promote "American Zombie," a citywide festival devoted to the work of director George A. Romero. Cast members Sean Keenan, Zaq Rogers and Tiffany Apple appeared on "Wilson's World" segments of local news program "Fox News Rising" on opposite sides of the zombie-rights argument in order to promote the event.
September 2009 saw Robot Johnson's first musical releases. The troupe released free promotional CDs at performances at the Carolina Actors Studio Theatre in Charlotte, NC and at The Gathering Spot in Greenville, SC. The promo CD singles featured members of the troupe performing parodies of "Here Comes the Sun" by The Beatles, "The Times They Are a-Changin'" by Bob Dylan, "Islands in the Stream" by Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers, and "Disarm" by The Smashing Pumpkins. Also in September 2009, troupe member David Golden released his debut album, "Here's What I Really Think of You," featuring songs he had written for the troupe.
In January 2010, Robot Johnson began a year long run of monthly shows at the CAST Theatre. 
On February 4, 2010, Robot Johnson performed at the North Carolina Comedy Arts Festival.

Rıza Nur

Riza Nur (August 30, 1879 in Sinop–September 8, 1942 in Istanbul) was a Turkish surgeon, politician and writer.
Early years.
After graduating from the Military Medical School in 1901 Riza Nur went on to work as a surgeon at Gülhane Military Hospital before returning to the Military Medical School as an academic in 1907. Before this an early posting had seen him serve on the border with Bulgaria where his job was to check if imported flour was contaminated with killer germs, after the Sultan had claimed this to be the case. The somewhat foolish nature of the work, as well as the refusal of his superiors to supply Riza with a microscope and other basic scientific tools, helped to convince him that Abdul Hamid II's rule was backward, corrupt and leading Turkey into severe decline. He entered politics following the adoption of a constitutional monarchy but was imprisoned and later exiled for coming into conflict with the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) administration, remaining a dissenting voice from abroad. Feeling that Turkey was too reliant on Germany but accepting that the country needed a close relationship with a bigger power to prosper he toyed with the idea of a United States mandate in Turkey in the immediate aftermath of World War I.
In Government.
Returning to Turkey in 1919 he was a founder member of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey and was appointed Minister of National Education in 1920 and Minister of Health and Foreign Affairs in 1921, as well as serving as the envoy at the 1921 Treaty of Moscow and the Conference of Lausanne. For Kemal Ataturk, Riza was an important appointment as his presence in government, along with that of Ahmet Ferit, lent weight to Ataturk's claims to being a uniting force as both men had been opponents of the CUP which provided most government ministers.
At Lausanne Riza was sent as assistant to the head of the Turkish delegation İsmet İnönü. It was he who proposed the motions recognising the Grand National Assembly as the legitimate government of Turkey, the end of the monarchy but the continuing control of the Caliphate by the Turkish government. However whilst at Lausanne he also came to blows with the former Prime Minister of Greece Eleftherios Venizelos over the issue of the Pontic Greeks. Indeed what the Allies saw as Riza's intransigence over both this issue and that of the Armenians led to a Yugoslavian delegate claiming that Riza was "beginning to show the cloven hoof".
Later years.
Following the formation of the Turkish Republic, Riza Nur fell out of favour somewhat and he left the country in 1926 after an attempt on the life of Ataturk at Izmir. Riza condemned the executions of Mehmet Cavit Bey and the other alleged conspirators arguing that, whilst he personally disliked the men who had been his own political opponents, he felt that they had not been involved in the plot and so were unjustly killed. Embittered at the fall-out with his former ally, Riza also wrote widely about Ataturk's alleged alcoholism. Returning from exile in Paris and Alexandria after Atatürk's death he published the "Tanridagi" journal, which supported Turanism.
Rıza Nur was also a noted writer on a number of topics, with his most well-known work being a history of Turkey in 14 volumes.
He died at the age of 63 and was buried at the Merkezefendi Cemetery, Istanbul.

Kadima leadership election, 2008

An election for the leadership of Kadima was held on 17 September 2008 as a concession to Kadima's coalition partner, Labour, which had threatened to bring down the government if Prime Minister Ehud Olmert didn't stand aside following police investigations into alleged corruption during his terms as minister and as mayor of Jerusalem.
As Kadima remained the largest party in the Knesset and the coalition, Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni, the designated new leader after balloting, had the chance to form a government without a need for elections.
Campaign.
The two front-runners throughout the campaign consistently remained Mofaz and Livni, with Livni always holding a consistent lead in the polls. (Note--Israeli primary polls can often be very unreliable due to poor sampling and turnout predictions. Most of the polls in the 2012 Kadima primary showed that Livni would beat Mofaz, yet Mofaz ended up winning in the end by a 62-38% margin, a whopping 24% difference. Likewise, Amir Peretz beat former Prime Minister Shimon Peres in the 2005 Labor leadership primary despite the fact that all or most of the polls predicted a solid Peres victory.) While both frontrunners supported a two-state solution, Mofaz attacked Livni for wanting to divide Jerusalem in a final peace deal with the Palestinians, and claimed that his military experience would make him a more qualified Prime Minister. Livni and her supporters claimed that a vote for Mofaz is the same as a vote for the Likud due to Mofaz's hawkish and more right-wing positions. They emphasized Livni's "clean" (free from corruption allegations) image and showed that Kadima led by Livni would win more seats in Parliament than Kadima led by Mofaz. Outgoing Prime Minister Ehud Olmert remained neutral in the primary, but was alleged to privately favor Mofaz.
Sources:
Results.
Exit polls released after the poll indicated a double-digit victory for Livni. The actual vote count turned out much closer, amid very low turnout, with Shaul Mofaz coming within a few hundred votes of winning an unexpected victory over Livni. Supporters of Mofaz called for a recount but Mofaz rejected any legal challenge of the declared result and called Livni to congratulate her on her victory, as did Sheetrit and Dichter.
Aftermath.
After Mofaz's loss, he announced that he would be taking a break from politics and leaving the government and Knesset. However, he would remain a member of Kadima. Soon after, however, he announced his return and won the 2nd place in Kadima's Knesset list for the 2009 elections. In a rematch in 2012, he won the leadership, and in the 2013 election led the party to a stunning collapse, winning 2 seats.
After her election, Livni failed to form a governing coalition, having failed to reach an agreement with Shas. Subsequently general elections took place on February 10, 2009.

Toronto Food Policy Council

The Toronto Food Policy Council (TFPC) is a citizen body of food activists and experts responsible for generating food policy for the City of Toronto.
Formed in 1991, the 30-member TFPC supports scores of programs with the shared goal of ensuring equitable access to food, nutrition, community development and environmental health, acting as professional lobbyist for the people on food and related issues. 
The TFPC is free to make its own decisions on food policy issues. Staff working with the TFPC are employed by, and responsible to, The Toronto Department of Public Health. This arrangement has gained interest from public health, community, food security and sustainable agriculture organizations around the world. The TFPC is under the leadership of Lauren Baker. Previous TFPC staff include Rod MacRae and Wayne Roberts. In April, 2009, the TFPC received the Bob Hunter Environmental Achievement Award, given to a City of Toronto agency with a record of outstanding leadership, for its efforts to make food an action item on the environmental agenda. The TFPC also won an honorary mention for a major award from the Community Food Security Coalition for its work promoting food sovereignty in October, 2009.
Working to ensure all significant decisions and expenditures are viewed through a “food lens,” the Council, under the leadership of Co-chair Janice Etter, succeeded in having food issues highlighted in the city of Toronto's official plan, adopted by city council in 2002 and updated in 2007.

Portello (district of Milan)

Portello is a district ("quartiere") of Milan, Italy, part of the Zone 8 administrative division of the city, located north-west of the centre. It is best known as a car-manufacturing area, as it used to house facilities of Alfa Romeo (now dismissed), Darracq, Citroën, and Fiat. The district also includes one of the major shopping malls in north-western Milan. It is crossed by the Circonvallazione ring road.
Portello is currently undergoing a major urban requalification process, as the former Alfa Romeo area (385,000 m²) is now being restructured. The project includes a major park called Parco Vittoria and what will become the largest plaza in Milan (20,000 m²), as well as commercial, service and housing infrastructures. The project is due to reach completion in 2011.
The design of Parco Vittoria, by architects Charles Jencks and Andreas Kipar, includes several unusual elements, and it is based on the general theme of time. It will comprise a large round lake, with a strip-shaped promontory that will allow pedestrians to walk to the center of the lake itself. A helix shaped hill (called "The Spiral of Time") will provide a panoramic view of the city; an artistic representation of the double DNA helix will be placed on top of the hill. Both the lake and the hill will be part of a park section called "Time Garden", partitioned into three areas dedicated to prehistory, history and present times.
Portello is adjacent to the Fieramilanocity district, and sources occasionally consider the two of them as a single "quartiere".
The name of the district comes from the "Strada del Portello" (Portello road), an ancient rural road that used to connect Milan to Rho, and that was later replaced by the new Strada del Sempione ("Simplon Road") leading to the Simplon Pass; the old Portello road is now known as "Via Traiano". In turn, the road was named after the Portello city gate, that was part of the city walls and that was located in the surroundings of the modern Cadorna railway station.

Thomas Twyne

Thomas Twyne (1543 - 1 August 1613 Lewes) was an Elizabethan translator and a physician of Lewes in Sussex, best known for completing Thomas Phaer's translation of Virgil's Aeneid into English verse after Phaer's death in 1560, and for his 1579 English translation of De remediis utriusque fortunae, a collection of 253 Latin dialogues written by the humanist Francesco Petrarca (1304–1374), commonly known as Petrarch.
Thomas was the son of John Twyne (c.1500-1581) of Bullington, Hampshire, himself a translator, schoolmaster, noted collector of antiquarian manuscripts and author of the Commentary "De Rebus Albionicis" (London, 1590). Tywne's son, Brian Twyne, became the first Keeper of the Archives of the University of Oxford.
Thomas was a native of Canterbury and was educated at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. He acted in the Richard Edwardes version of Palamon and Arcite, put on before Elizabeth I at Oxford in 1566, on which occasion the stage collapsed, killing and injuring a number of people. He enjoyed the patronage of Lord Buckhurst and greatly admired John Dee and his mystic philosophy.
Epitaph.
In St. Ann's church on the hill at Lewes. The historian Thomas Walker Horsfield, F.S.A. (1792–1837) translated the rather florid Latin inscription:
"Hippocrates saw Twyne lifeless and his bones slightly covered with earth. Some of his sacred dust (says he) will be of use to me in removing diseases; for the dead, when converted into medicine, will expel human maladies, and ashes prevail against ashes. Now the physician is absent, disease extends itself on every side, and exults its enemy is no more. Alas! here lies our preserver Twyne; the flower and ornament of his age. Sussex deprived of her physician, languished, and is ready to sink along with him. Believe me, no future age will produce so good a physician and so renowned a man as this has. He died at Lewes in 1613, on 1 August, in the tenth climacteric." 
A modern edition of forty-six of Petrarch's dialogues, "Phisicke Against Fortune", was published in 1993.

Arena.
Pete Maravich Assembly Center.
The Pete Maravich Assembly Center is a 13,215-seat multi-purpose arena in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The arena opened in 1972 and is home of the LSU Lady Tigers gymnastics team. It was originally known as the LSU Assembly Center, but was renamed in honor of Pete Maravich, a Tiger basketball legend, shortly after his death in 1988. The Maravich Center is known to locals as "The PMAC" or "The Palace that Pete Built," or by its more nationally known nickname, "The Deaf Dome," coined by Dick Vitale.
The slightly oval building is located directly to the north of Tiger Stadium, and its bright-white roof can be seen in many telecasts of that stadium. The arena concourse is divided into four quadrants: Pete Maravich Pass, The Walk of Champions, Heroes Hall and Midway of Memories.

Yana Bay

The Yana Bay (Russian: Янский залив; Yanskiy Zaliv) is the most important gulf of the Laptev Sea. It is located between Cape Buor-Khaya on its western side and the Ebelyakh Bay at its eastern end. 
The Yana River flows into the Yana Bay, forming a huge river delta (10,200 km²) that takes up much of the bay's coastline. The sea in this wide gulf is frozen for about nine months every year and is often clogged with ice floes.
Yarok is a large flat island located east of the main mouths of the Yana. Other islands in the Yana Bay are Makar and the Shelonsky Islands. East of these islands lies a deep inlet stretching southwards known in Russian as Sellyakhskaya Guba. 
Administratively the Yana Bay belongs to the Sakha Republic (Yakutia) of the Russian Federation.
History.
In 1712 Yakov Permyakov and his companion Merkury Vagin, the first recorded Russian explorers of the area, crossed the Yana Bay on dogsled from the mouth of the Yana River to Bolshoy Lyakhovsky over the ice in order to explore the then unknown island. Unfortunately Permyakov and Vagin were killed on the way back from their exploration by mutineering expedition members. 
In 1892–1894 Baron Eduard von Toll, accompanied by expedition leader Alexander von Bunge, carried out geological surveys in the area on behalf of the Russian Imperial Academy of Sciences.

Louis Vincent Aronson

Louis Vincent Aronson (December 25, 1869 – November 3, 1940), inventor and businessman, founded the Art Metal Works, which evolved to manufacture Ronson lighters.
Biography.
Louis Vincent Aronson was an American inventor, industrialist and philanthropist who is best remembered as the inventor of Ronson lighters. "He was a son of Simon and Jennie Aronson, who were natives of Prussia. He was born December 25, 1869, in New York City, and there his boyhood was spent." 
Aronson was an exceptionally gifted young man who graduated from public school at the age of 12 before entering a New York Technical School specializing in metallurgy, practical metal working and mechanical drawing. At the same time, he set up a laboratory in the basement of his parents' home where he experimented with plating processes and turned out money-making items while he devised ways of metalizing common items, in a durable finish of matte gold, including flowers, butterflies, animal claws and baby shoes.
Aronson demonstrated a natural ability for designing which was honed at the technical school and served him well throughout his life. He excelled and completed the School’s four year academic program in three years. When he graduated in 1885, at the age of 15, he was qualified as an expert metallurgist, draftsman and designer. He returned to the school five years later as an instructor in metallurgy for several years before devoting all his time to his own company. The year after Aronson graduated, when he was 16 years old, he sold the rights to a commercially valuable metal plating process, which he named Ormolu, according to Urban Cummings book Ronson, The World’s Greatest Lighter (1993, Bird Dog Books, Palo Alto, CA.) While retaining full use of his invention, young Aronson sold the patent rights for $5000 and used the proceeds to open his own company named the Art Metal Works in New York City.
Not long after opening the Art Metal Works, Aronson gained public recognition when he won an award in 1893 from the Belgian government for the creation of the first non-toxic match, and young businessman Aronson received 50,000 Francs, equaling $10,000 in U.S. dollars. In 1897 he received a U.S. patent (592,227) for a match design (called the Wind-match) that would light in windy conditions or when wet. He continued working on his match designs including inventing the “Birds Eye” or “Kitchen” match that had a dual-tip design in 1903; this was an important safety improvement because friction matches of the day would sometimes light accidentally especially when stepped on or while in one’s pocket. He realized that placing a small friction ignition chemical on the tip instead of the entire match-head greatly limited accidental ignition. This style of match is still in use today.
Aronson continued his research on all-weather matches finally receiving U.S. patent (1,287,819) in 1918, for a match that was praised by soldiers who were fighting in mud-filled trenches during World War I. His proficiency with matches led to a U.S. patent (1,295,952) for Bomb fuses also used in WWI, which he donated to the U.S. Government for the duration of the war, later earning his company the prestigious Distinguished Service Certificate from President Woodrow Wilson and the War Department. Through his research on matches, he sought to create and refine igniting devices that were efficient, safe and commercially viable.
By the year 1910 he received his first patent for a pocket lighter (U.S. Pat. 965,149). His pocket lighter used flint material which contained a mixture of cerium and iron according to the patent. His design was a simple device that created a shower of sparks with the press of a finger - but there was no sustainable flame. Based on the patent dates, this device preceded the Pist-O-Liter (U.S. Pat. 966,153) which he successfully produced that year, but likewise, it only produced sparks. Within three years he received a patent titled Pyrophorous Lighter, (U.S. Pat. 1,084,386) which we now appreciate as the Paragon striker lighter, a simple device capable of producing and sustaining a flame by means of a steel-tipped wand fitted with a cloth-wick saturated in petroleum ether also known as Benzine or Naphtha. The following year, 1914, he was granted a design patent for the well known Bulldog striker lighter (Des. Pat. D 45,407) which utilized the same principles as the Paragon, and soon became a very popular table lighter.
Aronson’s earlier efforts to produce igniting devices led him to invent many other useful and profitable items too. His ongoing experiments sparked ideas for other successful inventions like safe children’s toys including sparking guns, spinning tops & pinwheels and a series of hand held toys with sparking eyes called Archie(s). His inventions were ingenious in that they were appealing to children and safe for them to enjoy. He dedicated much of his time to causes that benefited children and the under-privileged in society. 
Before long the company was producing a variety of high quality lamps, book ends, statues and other decorative items, prized today for their detail in the collector marketplace.
In 1913 Louis Aronson applied for a patent for a Liter (lighter), which was approved along with others in years to come. In 1926 he released a new "automatic operation" Banjo lighter, which offered both ignition and extinguishment in a single push. It was a great success, demand shortly exceeding supply, spurring Aronson to patent it and design other products around the invention, which were marketed under the Ronson brand name.
With the success of the Art Metal Works and Ronson lighters, Aronson went on to become a Newark political and civic leader. He ran for Newark mayor in 1912, was a longtime treasurer of Essex County, New Jersey, Republicans, and became a bank executive. In time, Aronson's firm became the largest concern of its kind in the world.
Aronson's first wife died in 1934. He remarried in 1935, to stock-company actress Mabel Brownell. Aronson died on November 2, 1940 in Long Branch, New Jersey.

Liberdade Square (Porto)

Liberdade Square ("Liberty" or "Freedom" Square; ) is a square in the city of Porto, Portugal. It is located in Santo Ildefonso parish, in the lower town ("Baixa") area. The square is continuous on its north side with the Avenida dos Aliados, an important avenue of the city.
The square has its origins in the beginning of the 18th century. It was in 1718 that a project for the urbanisation of the area begun, which resulted in the creation of new streets and an ample square, known as "Praça Nova" (New Square). The square was initially limited by the medieval walls of the city and by urban palaces, all of which are now lost. 
After 1788, the religious order of Saint Eligius (known as "Lóios", in Portuguese) built a convent on the south side of the square that replaced the medieval wall; the imposing Neoclassical façade of the convent, nowadays known as the Cardosas Palace ("Palácio das Cardosas") is the oldest extant building of the square, dominating the south side of the square for over 200 years.
During the 19th century, several factors increased the importance of the square. The municipality moved to a building on the north side of the square after 1819, and towards the end of the century facilities like the D. Luís Bridge (1887) and São Bento Train Station (1896) were opened nearby. Liberdade Square was a political, economical and social centre for Porto.
In 1866 a monument dedicated to King Peter IV, a monarch closely linked to Porto, was inaugurated in the middle of the square. The monument, by French sculptor Anatole Calmels, consists of a statue of Peter IV riding a horse and holding the Constitution that he had fought to protect during the Liberal Wars.
The appearance of the square was much altered after 1916, when the municipality building was demolished and the Avenida dos Aliados, a modern boulevard, was built to the north of the square. The buildings around Liberdade Square and the avenues are occupied by banks, hotels, restaurants and offices. It is an important tourist attraction of the city.

Jess Smith

Jesse W. "Jess" Smith (1871 – May 30, 1923) was a member of President Warren G. Harding's Ohio Gang. He was born and raised in Washington Court House, Ohio, where he became a friend of Harry M. Daugherty. There, Daugherty helped him to become the successful owner of a department store. Smith became Daugherty's gofer during the 1920 campaign.
Role.
Smith came to Washington as an aide to Daugherty as U.S. Attorney General. He had a desk at the Department of Justice, but no official title. He nevertheless wielded considerable influence.
He was also Daugherty's roommate at Washington, D.C.'s Wardman Park Hotel. Daugherty's wife had remained behind in Columbus because of illness; Smith was divorced.
Smith's activities (it's said he sold bonded liquor to bootleggers, and was associated with a house at 1625 K Street, later to become notorious as the Little Green House on K Street) became an embarrassment to Harding and Daugherty as the Teapot Dome scandal focused increased scrutiny on Harding and his supporters. Before leaving for Alaska, Harding told Daugherty he wanted Smith out of Washington.
On May 30, 1923, Smith died of a gunshot wound, and was found with a pistol at his side. His death was pronounced a suicide, but Alabama Senator James Thomas Heflin alleged otherwise, first at an investigatory hearing and later from the floor of the United States Senate.
"Nobody else knew what he knew and with him dead there was nobody to tell the story — so Jesse Smith was murdered," said Senator Heflin, initially.
He followed up two days later, in the Senate, quoting an Alabama bootleggerYou know Secretary Mellon loaned the Republican National Committee $5,000,000 in 1920. Only $3,000,000 has been repaid. There is a deficit of $2,000,000. Jess Smith was charged with getting that money. The plan was to have the liquor men and the breweries contribute to this fund...
"That is one of the reasons," shouted Senator Heflin, "why they wanted to get rid of Jess Smith."
Documented links with Harding administration.
Smith's links with members of the Harding administration, including First Lady Florence Kling Harding, have been documented by Carl Sferrazza Anthony, in his "Florence Harding: the First Lady, the Jazz Age, and the Death of America's Most Scandalous President", New York: W. Morrow & Co., 1998
In fiction.
Smith is one of four characters (and the only one based on a real person) from whose point of view Gore Vidal's novel of the period, "Hollywood", is told. He is portrayed as a business-savvy but weak-willed and sycophantic follower of Harding and Daugherty, and it's speculated that his death might have been a murder used to cover up the Ohio Gang's crimes.
Roy Hoopes' novel "Our Man in Washington" also speculates that Smith might have been murdered as part of a coverup.
Smith is played by Ed Jewett in season 3 of the television series "Boardwalk Empire". When Harry Daugherty's office comes under investigation for its connections to bootleggers, Smith becomes increasingly paranoid. Daugherty comes to see Smith as a loose end and sends fellow Ohio Gang member, Gaston Means, to kill him. Means plans to kill Smith in his sleep but is unable to surprise him leading to an awkward confrontation where Smith kills himself.

Mike DeBardeleben

James Mitchell "Mike" DeBardeleben (March 20, 1940 - January 26, 2011) was a convicted rapist and counterfeiter who became known as the "Mall Passer" due to his practice of passing counterfeit bills in shopping malls abutting interstate highways across the country. After his arrest for counterfeiting, he was found to have committed much more serious sex crimes. Although he was never brought to trial for murder, he was the principal suspect in two homicides and he remains a suspect in several others. He died of pneumonia at the Federal Medical Center in Butner, North Carolina in early 2011.
Background.
DeBardeleben grew up in Little Rock, Arkansas, the second of three children. He had an older brother named Ralph and a younger sister whose identity is not publicly known. In 1945, when he was five years old, his family moved to Austin, Texas. His father who was serving in the U.S. Navy was then shipped out to the South Pacific for nine months. In 1949, his family moved to Kentucky for a short while before relocating to Frankfurt, Germany but after a year his family moved again.
Adult life.
In 1956, at the age of sixteen DeBardeleben physically assaulted his mother; it is unknown what sparked this violent encounter. On September 8 that year, at the age of sixteen, he purchased two handguns and ammunition with a friend. Later that month he was arrested and convicted for his first felony, possessing a concealed firearm. This arrest was the first of many that followed including arrests for sodomy, attempted murder and kidnapping.
In the Spring of 1957 he was expelled from Peter Schuyler High School and did not seek further formal education. In October that year, he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force and was stationed at the Lackland Air Force Base in Texas. Only after a year he was court-martialed for disorderly behavior and was sentenced to two months in the base stockade. In 1958 he was ordered to see a psychiatrist for counseling after he was pronounced AWOL several times. At the age of eighteen he was discharged from the air force and moved to Fort Worth, Texas with relatives of the family.
In 1959, he attempted school again, enrolling in R.L. Paschal High School, but after three months was expelled. In August that year, he married his first wife, Linda Weir, but three weeks later separated from her. Also that month, he was arrested for attempted robbery with an accomplice, followed two weeks later by his involvement in a string of auto thefts, and was sentenced to five years probation. In October with an unknown woman, he fathered a premature daughter who was a stillborn.
He later met Charlotte Weber who was seventeen at the time he started courting her. In March 1960, he impregnated Charlotte and on June 9 the same year, married her. On December 12, 1960, he successfully fathered a daughter, Bethene. Afterward, Charlotte became pregnant again with another child but was forced by DeBardeleben to give it up for adoption. In August 1961, his brother Ralph committed suicide for unknown reasons.
"Mall Passing" case.
In the early 1980s, Secret Service agents were investigating a string of counterfeiting cases in which a man was determined to be entering a mall with a wad of counterfeit $20 bills, making a small purchase at each store in the mall, and receiving most of the remainder in legitimate cash as change. Following the pattern of his itinerary, FBI agents out of Knoxville, TN began passing out his composite sketch to mall clerks in chain stores he had targeted along a hypothesized projected itinerary. DeBardeleben was identified as the suspect in these crimes, and a national manhunt ensued.
At the time of his arrest, more wads of counterfeit $20 bills were found in his car, each with a label stating the city in which it would be used. His counterfeiting operation was also discovered, along with evidence of sex crimes, which consisted of photographs taken during the act of rape/murder. FBI profilers speculate that in photographs where his face is seen along with the victim's, he murdered the woman & disposed of her body - whereas photographs where he is hiding his face, he allowed the victim to live. DeBardeleben asked to be allowed to represent himself at his trials, which were held in various jurisdictions & earned the respect of FBI profilers because he never gave himself away in unguarded moments, nor bragged about his exploits.
DeBardeleben was convicted of multiple crimes and sentenced to serving a 375-year sentence at Butner Federal Bureau of Prison, North Carolina. He made friends selectively with other serial rapists/murderers while in prison with whom he allegedly shared fantasies & actual details of his crimes.
The DSM-IV cites DeBardeleben as an example of antisocial personality disorder.

Lanner and District Silver Band

The Lanner & District Silver Band is a brass band based in Lanner, Cornwall, United Kingdom, and an important part of village life.
History.
The original Lanner & District Silver Band was formed in the Cornish village of Lanner in the mid-1890s. However, following large-scale emigration from the mining district it disbanded in 1902.
The band was reformed in 1965, and in those early days practised in a chicken shed in the garden of Lanner resident Daisy Moyle. Mrs. Moyle later became the band's first 'Life Member'.
As the band attracted more members they outgrew the chicken shed and moved to a bandroom at the top of Lanner Hill. From these humble beginnings a strong youth band emerged, and as time went by these young players progressed into the senior band, thus helping to sustain its development. Eventually, even the Lanner Hill Bandroom became too small, and a concerted effort from the players and committee members resulted in the purchase, in 1983, of the old Primitive Methodist chapel on Lanner Moor, which is the present band's headquarters.
Current activities.
Lanner & District Silver band has progressed from its early days in the fourth section of the Cornish and national ratings, and is today one of the finest bands in Cornwall (a county which has around 40 silver bands). It has represented the South West area at the National Finals and won many other contests throughout the south west. In April 2003 the band was crowned West of England 2nd Section Champions. This promoted the band to the 1st Section and gained them qualification to the National Brass Band Championships of Great Britain. The success continued later that year when, at the finals, the band achieved a magnificent 3rd place. Since that time the band has competed successfully in the First Section and will be proud to be competing in the Championship Section as of January 2014. The success continues and the Lanner Band is recognised as one of the most innovative, entertaining and successful bands in Cornwall.
In July 2013 the band successfully completed the building of its new Headquarters and recording facility, which can also be used as a community venue. Funded by the generous donation of a grant from the Sita Cornwall Trust, the building was completed with a huge amount of voluntary work by band members and committee.
The band plays at the head of the Lanner Carnival parade in July and the Remembrance Day parade in November, which march through the village every year along with Scouting groups, a number of village groups, and decorated floats.

Espinoza v. Farah Manufacturing Company

Espinoza v. Farah Mfg. Co., 414 U.S. 86 (1973), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court, which held that an employer's refusal to hire a person because he is not a United States citizen does not constitute employment discrimination on the basis of “national origin” in violation of §703 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Espinoza, a Mexican national admitted to residence in the United States and married to a U.S. national, brought suit after exhausting her administrative remedies with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, alleging that Farah Mfg. Company's refusal to hire her in its San Antonio, Texas division because of her Mexican citizenship violated §703 of the Civil Rights Act, which makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to fail or refuse to hire any individual because of his race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.
The District Court granted Espinoza's motion for summary judgment, relying primarily on an EEOC guideline providing that a lawful alien resident may not be discriminated against on the basis of citizenship. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, and the Supreme Court affirmed this decision.

Jody Sperling

Jody Sperling is an American dancer, choreographer, and dance scholar based in New York City. She is the Founder/Artistic Director of Time Lapse Dance, a dance company that gives a postmodern twist to vintage genres, from the fin de siècle spectacles of Loie Fuller, to circus and music hall entertainments.
Biography.
Sperling holds an MA in Performance Studies (New York University, 1996) and a BA in Dance and Italian (Wesleyan College, 1992). 
Sperling became interested in Fuller in 1997 when she performed Fuller's "The Butterfly Dance". Since then, she has gained an international reputation as an expert on Loie Fuller and as a contemporary interpreter of Fuller’s style of dancing. She has lectured and/or performed at colleges, universities and international festivals and conferences in countries such as the United States, Canada, France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, and Russia. 
Sperling has created five Fuller-inspired solos:"The Serpentine Dance" (after the 1891 original); "The Magic-Lantern Dance" (a collaboration with the American Magic-Lantern Theater); "Dance of the Elements, La Nuit" set to the music of John Cage; and "Debussy Soirée". She has also developed group works such as "Ghosts" (2008); the trio "Roman Sketches" (2007), co-commissioned by Vermont Performance Lab, LLC. and Marlboro College,; and the septet "Ballet of Light" [http://timelapsedance.com/rep_light.htm] (2007), a reinterpretation of Fuller’s 1908 original, commissioned by the University of Wyoming with funds from the National Endowment for the Arts/American Masterpieces program.
Sperling’s interest in dance history has led her to perform works from other periods, such as Yvone Rainer's 1960s "Trio A", and her dance "Orlando" was inspired by an interest in 16th-century galliard steps. She is also a hoop dancer/instructor, and has created dances for low-flying trapeze.
She has written occasional articles for "Dance Magazine", "The Village Voice", and other publications, including a contribution to the six-volume "International Encyclopedia of Dance" (Oxford University Press, 1998). 
Sperling has served on the Board of Directors of the Society of Dance History Scholars.

Macefen is a civil parish in the unitary authority of Cheshire West and Chester and the ceremonial county of Cheshire, England. It lies east of the village of Malpas and north west of Whitchurch, Salop. Part of the village of No Man's Heath lies within the northern boundary of Macefen.
Macefen is a slightly curious parish in that it scarcely appears in gazeteers. Kelly's Directory of Cheshire, 1914 
lists Macefen under Tushingham cum Grindley thus: "Macefen (or Maesfen) is a small township in the Whitchurch union, 2 miles south from Malpas station. The Hon. Mrs. Algernon R. Parker, who has a residence here on the north side of Bradley Lane, is lady of the manor and sole landowner." It never had its own church but was served by adjacent churches.

MRT Orange Line

The MRT Orange Line () is one of planned rapid transit lines of the Mass Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand (MRTA) in the Bangkok Metropolitan Area, Thailand.
This Line is divided into 3 sections, Taling Chan - Thailand Cultural Center (17.5-km), Thailand Cultural Centre - Bang Kapi (9-km) and Bang Kapi - Min Buri (11-km). The section from Taling Chan to Bang Kapi is scheduled to be completed in 2019.
When fully completed, the line will be about 37.5-km long, mostly underground, with 29 stations (7 elevated stations and other 22 underground stations, including the current Thailand Cultural Centre Station of MRT Blue Line).
The line is indicated by the colour Orange on the map.
History.
The original plan of Orange Line aimed to serve travel demand between the northwestern area of Thonburi, at Bang Bamru Railway Station in Bang Phlat District, and the east of Bangkok in Bang Kapi District. It also runs through downtown along Ramkhamhaeng Road and Ratchawithi Road, passing many public places like Hua Mak Stadium, Dusit Zoo and Victory Monument, and provides access to universities including Ramkhamhaeng University, Suan Sunandha and Suan Dusit Rajabhat University.
In 2009, the proposed MRT Brown Line extension from Bang Kapi District, elevated outbounds along Ram Khamhaeng Road, to the eastern suburb in Saphan Sung District and Min Buri District, has been merged with the Orange Line in Bangkok's mass rapid transit master plan. There are also notable changes on the western section of the Orange Line. The section from Din Daeng District to Bang Bamru has been rerouted via Pratunam Market and Larn Luang Road, then goes along the cancelled BTS Silom Line extension under Ratchadamnoen Klang Road and terminates at Taling Chan District, interchange with SRT Light Red Line.
In July 2011, the section from Bang Khun Non to Taling Chan has been scrapped, as it overlaps with the SRT Light Red Line. The connection from Siriraj to Bang Khun Non stays in place so travelers will be able to interchange with the MRT Blue Line north extension.
Alignment.
The Orange Line will start from Min Buri District as elevated structure on Ramkhamhaeng Road (former Suka Phiban III Road) from eastern suburb in Min Buri District and goes underground near Lam Sali intersection in Bang Kapi District, also transfers to MRT Yellow Line. It continues southwest along Ramkhamhaeng Road, passing Hua Mak Stadium and Ramkhamhaeng University. Then it turns to the west and crosses Pradit Manutham Road to the current MRT depot. Then it goes to Thailand Cultural Centre Station, the alignment crosses over and transfers to the current MRT Blue Line. It continues via Din Daeng housing estates and Bangkok City Hall 2 to Vibhavadi Rangsit Road, Sam Liam Din Daeng Junction. Then turn left into Ratchaprarop Road towards Pratu Nam and turn right into Phetchaburi Road then interchange with BTS Sukhumvit Line at Ratchathewi Station. It continues along Larn Luang Road and Ratchadamnoen Road. Then crosses the Chao Phraya River near Phra Pinklao Bridge, passes Siriraj Hospital and goes along Bangkok Noi Rail line and terminates at Taling Chan District, interchanges with SRT Red Line. The total length is 37.5 km.

Dudley bus station

Dudley Bus Station is a bus station in the town of Dudley, England. It is managed by Network West Midlands. Local bus and national coach services operated by various companies serve the bus station which has 19 departure stands.
The arrival stand is A and also on surrounding streets and the departures stands are lettered B - U "(excluding I and O)". U is allocated to long distance coach services, which are mainly pre-booked. They are not included in the bus routes list below.
The original bus station was constructed along Birmingham Street on a steep hill overlooking Dudley Castle in about 1950. It was complemented by an additional line of shelters along neighbouring Fisher Street. However, a series on incidents of buses rolling back injuring passengers led to widespread local criticism of its design. This resulted in West Midlands PTE rebuilding the bus station on a completely level site along Fisher Street. Construction of the new bus station began during 1985 and it was opened to the public in 1987.
The original lay-over facilities on adjacent Portersfield still remain to this day, on part of what is now a public car park.

<doc id="18541253" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18541253" title="The Red Line">
The Red Line

The Red Line ("Punainen viiva") is an opera in two acts with music by Aulis Sallinen to a libretto by the composer, which premiered on 30 November 1978 at the Finnish National Opera.
Based on the 1909 novel "Punainen viiva" by Ilmari Kianto (1874-1970), the opera – like the novel – is set in 1907, a watershed year in Finnish history during which its first elections were held, leading eventually to Finnish independence in 1917.
Performance history.
Outside Finland, the opera was performed at several European opera houses, including Sadler's Wells Theatre, London in 1979 and at the Metropolitan Opera of New York in 1983. It has been revived several times in Helsinki and was recorded in November 1979 by Finlandia. A DVD of Finnish National Opera's 2007 stage production conducted by Mikko Franck has been issued by Ondine.
Synopsis.
"North Finnish province of Kainuu; the croft of Topi and his family"
Act 1.
It is late autumn; a bear, symbol of the threat of brutal nature, is heard nearby; it has carried off one of their sheep. As Topi promises to slay the bear, he argues with his wife, both feel trapped by their poor life and realise that they have barely any food remaining for the family. Topi believes that things will change for the better.
Topi dreams that he has gone to the village to ask for help for children, but, admonished by the vicar for not attending church, aid arrives too late and his children are dead. Topi awakes, terrified by his dream, but takes some birds to exchange for grain and sets off to the village. Riika regrets having called Topi names.
A pedlar enters, Simana Arhippaini from Karelia, tells the children riddles and sings a ballad, but cannot answer their serious questions. Topi returns and gets Kunilla to read to him from a socialist newspaper, and talks about ‘an election’, a possible way of release from their toil and poverty without understanding the importance of it.
New Year
An agitator addresses an open-air meeting. Despite interruptions from a young priest, he proclaims social democracy and tells of freedom, equality and fraternity. The people are slowly aware of the meaning of the vote.
Act 2.
Twelfth Night
Neighbours join Topi and Riika to celebrate Twelfth Night. Riika reads from a socialist tract; all will be voting in the election but Topi, having only ever held axes and spades in his hands, wonders how he will make his mark — a red line — on the ballot paper. As they are discussing the future, dogs start barking, aware that the bear is turning in his sleep, but the people can't sense this.
Fifteenth of March
Outside the polling-booth a confrontation takes place between the young priest and his choir, and the socialist organiser and his group. The voters are checked as they enter to vote. Topi and Riika go in.
Later in the spring
Topi is at the logging camp; Riika anxiously clears fresh tracks in the snow for him every day, hoping for his return. She desperately longs for word that the election has changed their lives; but no one comes.
The children have all fallen ill from malnutrition. Kaisi tells Riika it is a punishment; when Topi returns they have all died. The vicar agrees to bury them for a reduced price, as they can all fit in a single coffin.
The message comes that the election has been won by the ordinary people. There is the promise of better clothes, food and health, but it is too late for Topi and Riika. Then dogs bark, warning of the bear, which has awakened. Topi goes to fight it, but he is killed and Riika finds him dead, and cries out in horror over his corpse, with blood pouring out of his throat, in a red line.
The music.
Grove notes the careful structuring of mood via the music with lyricism in the opening scenes, pastiche folk music where needed and a choral confrontation between the old (folk melody) and the new (revolutionary fervour).
Bush describes the music as "expertly composed and elegantly orchestrated", and commends scenes 4 and 6, and the orchestral interludes. Another writer commented that in this "grim opera" the very intense dramatic effect of the music may be due to its generally low-key approach.

Danish Jewish Museum

The Danish Jewish Museum (), in Copenhagen, Denmark, sits inside the Danish Royal Library’s old Galley House and exhibits Danish Jewish historical artifacts and art. Designed by world-renowned architect Daniel Libeskind, the building memorializes the story of Danish Jews who were saved from Nazi persecution by their fellow Danes in October 1943. Construction of the Museum began in March 2003 and the museum opened in June 2004.
History.
At the turn of the seventeenth century, King Christian IV built Denmark’s Royal Boat House, which was later renovated in 1906, during the construction of the adjacent Royal Library. In 1985, the Society for Danish Jewish History decided to establish a museum in Copenhagen dedicated to its namesake. It wasn’t until the 1990s, however, that the organization met with Daniel Libeskind and the Royal Library site underwent another transformation. The renovation of the Boat House, executed by Fogh & Følner architects, began in July 2002, and construction of the Danish Jewish Museum ended in September 2003. In June 2004, the museum opened.
Design.
The space’s evolving function influenced Libeskind’s design. The museum’s layout incorporates a pedestrian walk between the new and old libraries, outdoor summer seating for a café, and intimate conversation spaces at the ground level of the entrance. The whole building is organized as a series of planes, each corresponding to a particular field of religious discourse. Together, the planes, named Exodus, Wilderness, The Giving of the Law, and The Promised Land, carve interior corridors of fractured passageways and slanted floors. These corridors comprise the museum’s exhibition spaces and, as they wind, they form the letters for the Hebrew word Mitzvah, meaning “good deed.” According to the museum’s website, the form of the building stands as a commentary on the artifacts and artworks it houses, paralleling how accompanying texts often illuminate different aspects of the Talmud. Libeskind describes the space as a “sort of text running within a frame made up of many other surfaces – walls, inner spaces, showcases, virtual perspectives.”

Callington railway station

Callington railway station was a railway station in the village of Kelly Bray one mile north of the centre of the small town of Callington, Cornwall, built by the Plymouth, Devonport and South Western Junction Railway, but operated by the London and South Western Railway. It was the terminus of a branch line from Bere Alston, and the station closed in 1966. The Tamar Valley Line still operates services from Bere Alston with services terminating to the east at Gunnislake railway station. The now-closed section of line north of Gunnislake was remote from local communities and relatively slow compared to the competing roads (Callington had good bus services to Saltash and Plymouth which the landscape has denied Gunnislake) which limited traffic levels. The gradients and alignment were ironically better than the surviving section south of Gunnislake. 
A small locomotive depot was also built by the PD&SWJR at the station in 1872. This remained in use until closure in 1964.

Afternoon movie

The afternoon movie was a popular practice of local television stations from the 1950s through the 1970s. It consisted of the daily weekday showing of old films usually between 12:30 and 2:00 P.M; if the film ran two hours or more, it was split into two parts. Atlanta local station WSB-TV, for instance, would show films in this time slot under the umbrella title "Armchair Playhouse". Popular titles, such as the 1953 "House of Wax", "The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms" (also 1953), the 1935 "Mutiny on the Bounty", the 1949 "The Secret Garden", or "National Velvet" (1944), would often turn up as afternoon movies (years later, in 1978, "National Velvet" was shown on network television, by CBS). During the Christmas season, such films as "Gulliver's Travels" (1939), "" (1954), or "A Christmas Carol" (1938) would sometimes be telecast on local stations after the network telecast of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade.
There was no cable TV, home video, or video-on-demand in those days. Viewers either had to watch an old film when it was telecast, or wait for it to be shown at a revival house.
WABC-TV in New York City ran "" weekdays from 1968 to 1981. Other ABC owned-and-operated stations also used the format at different times in the afternoon.
Some local stations also telecast morning movies in much the same format; these were often shown from 9:30 A.M. to 11:00 A.M., and, like the afternoon films, would often be split up into two parts. Many obscure B-films turned up as morning movies, though occasionally a "big film" such as "The Miracle of the Bells" would be telecast.
As more and more films began to be televised by entire networks in prime time, and as more and more soap operas, talk shows, and daily syndicated programming filled the network airwaves and became extremely popular, the daily afternoon movie on TV was gradually phased out on the local affiliates belonging to the three major commercial networks (NBC, CBS and ABC). Ted Turner's WPCH-TV, on the other hand, showed old films such as the 1960 "Little Shop of Horrors" and the edited version of "Joan of Arc" both in the morning and in the afternoon throughout the 1970s, when it was called WTCG (no relation to the current WCTG).
Today, films are often shown locally on commercial stations in the afternoon during a weekend (especially since there are now so many more television channels), but none are shown in the afternoon on a weekday on the local affiliates.

Bwa people

The Bwa or Bwaba (plural), or Bobo-Wule (Bobo-Oule), are an ethnic group indigenous to central Burkina Faso and Mali. Their population is approximately 300,000. They are known for their use of masks, made from leaves or wood, used in performative rituals.
History.
In the 18th century, Bwa lands were occupied by the Bamana empire who made the Bwa pay taxes. The places left unconquered were raided by the Bamana, which led to a weakening of the Bwa social and political systems. In the 19th century, the Bamana declined and the area was dominated by the Fulani who raided and enslaved the Bwa and stole their livestock. The end of the 19th century brought French mercenaries who used the Fulani to help control the area. The Bwa traditions of storing crops for use in lean years were undermined by the crippling taxation systems of the French and they suffered further from famine from 1911–1913. The French demanded military recruits from the Bwa and in 1915, the Bwa revolted., starting the Volta-Bani War. This war lasted about a year and ended with the destruction of many Bwa villages.
Distribution.
The Bwa live in central Burkina Faso and south-east Mali, between Mali's Bani River and the Mouhoun River (Black Volta) in Burkina Faso. Their total population is approximately 300, 000. The major towns occupied by the Bwa are Houndé, Boni, Bagassi, Dossi and Pa.
Society and politics.
Like many of their neighbours, the Bwa are predominantly farmers, their main cash crop being cotton. They also farm millet, rice, sorghum, yams, and peanuts. Bwa villages are autonomous and they do not recognise any outside political authority. They are led by a council of male elders who make all the major decisions. Villages are structured with a cluster of mud walled buildings around a central space where livestock are guarded at night.
Culture.
Language.
The Bwa speak Bwa languages, a closely related group of Gur languages of the Niger–Congo family. Some speak Jula (Dioula) for trading and communication with outsiders, and French is also used.
Religion and mythology.
Most Bwa still retain traditional animist beliefs. Approximately 5% are Muslim, approximately 10% are Christian and approximately 85% are animists.
Creation myth.
The creator god of the Bwa is known as Wuro, Difini or Dobweni. He created the world by setting his creations up in balanced opposing pairs (for example male and female, domesticated and wild). 
Worship.
The Bwa have to work to maintain the balance. Wuro left the earth after being wounded by a woman pounding millet. He had three sons: Dwo (or Do), god of new life and rebirth; Soxo, god of the wilderness and Kwere, the god of lightning. Wuro sent Dwo, with his brothers, to earth as his messenger and manifestation.
The Bwa, (the northern Bwa in particular) worship Dwo as an intermediary between man and nature. The religious leader of each village is an earth priest called the "labie", the oldest man of the village. The congregation of Dwo is a strong cohesive force in Bwa villages. The Bwa share their Dwo religion with the neighbouring Bobo people, and probably acquired it from the Bobo centuries ago. In the late 19th century, following decades of oppression and misfortune, many southern Bwa villages abandoned the cult of Dwo and adopted the religion of their Nuna neighbours.
Masks.
The Bwa are well known for their use of traditional tribal masks. The masks, made from wood and leaves, are used in traditional rituals. In particular the Southern Bwa are known for their tall plank masks, known as "nwantantay", and tend to use wood to make their masks. This is a result of their adoption of Nuna religion and their traditions of using wooden masks. About 1897, after a series of disasters, including the arrival of the French and their Senegalese mercenaries, the Bwa decided God had abandoned them, so they turned to their Nuna neighbors and purchased the rights to use, wear, and carve wooden masks, their costumes, and the songs and dances that go with them. The religion associated with wooden masks is focused on the spirit Lanle, whose power is manifested through the wooden masks. The northern Bwa use leaf masks more than wooden ones. [http://www.uiowa.edu/%7Eafricart/Leaf%20masks%20web/index.htm These leaf masks frequently represent Dwo in religious ceremonies. The masks also represent the bush spirits including serpents, monkeys, buffalo and hawks. Mask performances generally take place in the dry season between February and May.
Classification.
Early European explorers to the area called the Bwa "Bobo", confusing them with their neighbours the Bobo people. Although the two groups share religion and culture, they are ethnically distinct. The confusion led to alternative names for the Bwa including Bobo Oule, or Eastern Bobo. In Jula, Bobo Oule means "Red Bobo". This distinguishes the Bwa from the Bobo who are called the "Black Bobo". 
The White Bobo, "Bobo Gbe", are also Bwa.
The southern Bwa became known by their neighbours as "Nieniegue" meaning "scarred Bwa" as a result of the tradition of scarification of their faces and bodies. This practice is no longer commonplace and so the term is also in decline.

<doc id="18541336" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18541336" title="Spring Street Financial District">
Spring Street Financial District

The Spring Street Financial District, referred to as the Wall Street of the West, is a historic district in Downtown Los Angeles. The historic district includes 23 financial structures, including the city's first skyscraper, and three hotels all located along a stretch of South Spring Street from just north of Fourth Street to just south of Seventh Streets. In the first half of the 20th Century, this stretch of Spring Street was the financial center of Los Angeles, with the important banks and financial institutions being concentrated there. At least ten of the buildings in the district were designed in whole or in part by John Parkinson, who designed many of the city's landmark buildings in the early 20th Century, including the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, Los Angeles City Hall, Bullocks Wilshire, and Union Station. Ten of the buildings in the district have been designated as Historic-Cultural Monuments by the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission.
History.
Early days.
In the 1890s, the city's business center was further north near South Spring and Temple Streets. The street can claim credit as the birthplace of the motion picture business in Los Angeles. In 1898, Thomas Edison filmed a 60-second film titled "South Spring Street Los Angeles California", mounting a giant camera on a wagon to film the bustling action along South Spring Street. Edison's movie with scenes of streetcars, bicycles and horse-drawn wagons traveling down Spring Street can be viewed here.
Wall Street of the West.
In the early 1900s, the city center began spreading south, and the city's banks and financial institutions began concentrating along South Spring Street. The first two important buildings to make the move south were the Hellman and Continental Buildings, with the Continental Building being considered the city's first skyscraper. In 1911, the "Los Angeles Times" boasted about the building boom on Spring Street:"The visitor to this city can at this moment observe skyscrapers in all stages of construction. It is a study which will provide the most comprehensible kind of answer to the query as to why Los Angeles is leading San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Baltimore, Detroit, Minneapolis, New Orleans, Boston, Buffalo and all other cities of anything near her in building activity as revealed by the monthly expenditures for construction work." The building boom along South Spring Street continued into the 1920s as the population and economy of Los Angeles boomed. South Spring Street remained the city's financial center even after World War II.
Decline of the district in the 1970s and 1980s.
In the 1960s, many of the banks and financial institutions began moving to the western part of the downtown area, along Figueroa Street and Wilshire Boulevard. By the early 1980s, South Spring Street had become known for "transients who sleep in doorways and urinate on sidewalks." In 1982, the "Los Angeles Times" commented on the district's decline from "Wall Street of the West" to a blighted area with empty office buildings lining both sides of the street:"When the banks and law firms moved to the 'Gold Coast' typified by Arco Towers, six blocks to the west, Spring Street plummeted to become a neighborhood of hoodlums, derelicts and winos—a neighborhood of echoing buildings full of absolutely nothing above the ground floor." 
Redevelopment projects and regentrification.
Since the early 1980s, South Spring Street has been the subject of numerous redevelopment projects. In recent years, numerous art galleries have moved into the old financial district, which is now known as Gallery Row. Many of the old bank buildings have also been converted into upscale lofts. As wealthier residents have moved into the district's lofts, older residents and artists have complained about the increased rents. One artist who had lived in the district for years said:"The real problem with downtown lately, Gronk and his friends half-jokingly agreed is 'those people.' Westsiders. Trust-fund babies. New tenants who demand their bohemian pleasures be liberally sweetened with suburban amenities. Landlords who previously recruited artists to help make downtown 'safe' for gentrification, then jacked up their rents so only lawyers and screenwriters could afford it."
Beaux Arts architecture as the district's enduring strength.
The strength of the district remains its period architecture. Many of the Beaux Arts facades along Spring Street remain virtually intact, making the district a popular shooting location for motion picture and television productions seeking authentic period cityscapes. In 1985, noted "Los Angeles Times" columnist Jack Smith pointed to the Spring Street Financial District as proof that "Los Angeles was never the cultural wasteland it was alleged to be." He hailed the district's "financial palaces" as "a solid architectural achievement" which give the street "beauty, strength, unity and dignity."
Buildings in the district.
Notable buildings in the district (from north to south) include:
Historic designation and walking tours.
Due to the large percentage of historic bank and financial buildings that remain intact in the district, the area was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. The Los Angeles Conservancy offers walking tours of the Spring Street Financial District on the fourth Saturday of each month at 10 a.m.; the tour lasts approximately 2-1/2 hours and costs $10 for the general public (reduced rate for Conservancy members).

<doc id="18541342" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18541342" title="Multicore Association">
Multicore Association

The Multicore Association, founded in 2005, is a member-funded, non-profit, industry consortium focused on the creation of open standard APIs, specifications, and guidelines that allow system developers and programmers to more readily adopt multicore technology into their applications.
The consortium provides a neutral forum for vendors and developers who are interested in, working with, and/or proliferating multicore-related products, including processors, infrastructure, devices, software, and applications. Its members represent vendors of processors, operating systems, compilers, development tools, debuggers, ESL/EDA tools, and simulators; and application and system developers.
The consortium’s president is Markus Levy, who is also president of EEMBC, the Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium.
Completed Projects.
In 2008, the Multicore Communications API working group released the consortium's first specification, referred to as MCAPI. MCAPI™ is a message-passing API that captures the basic elements of communication and synchronization that are required for closely distributed (multiple cores on a chip and/or chips on a circuit board) embedded systems. The target systems for MCAPI™ span multiple dimensions of heterogeneity (e.g., core heterogeneity, interconnect fabric heterogeneity, memory heterogeneity, operating system heterogeneity, software toolchain heterogeneity, and programming language heterogeneity).
In 2011, the MCAPI working group released MCAPI 2.0. The enhanced version adds new features, such as domains for routing purposes. MCAPI Version 2.0 adds a level of hierarchy into that network of nodes through the introduction of “domains.” Domains can be used in a variety of implementation-specific ways, such as for representing all the cores on a given chip or for dividing a topology into public and secure areas. MCAPI 2.0 also adds three new types of initialization parameters (node attributes, implementation-specific configurations, implementation information such as the initial network topology or the MCAPI version being executed). The MCAPI WG is chaired by Sven Brehmer.
In 2011, the Multicore Resource Management API working group released its first specification, referred to as MRAPI. MRAPI is an industry-standard API that specifies essential application-level resource management capabilities. Multicore applications require this API to allow coordinated concurrent access to system resources in situations where: (1) there are not enough resources to dedicate to individual tasks or processors, and/or (2) the Run time (program lifecycle phase) system does not provide a uniformly accessible mechanism for coordinating resource sharing. This API is applicable to both SMP and AMP embedded multicore implementations (whereby AMP refers to heterogeneous both in terms of software and hardware). MRAPI (in conjunction with other Multicore Association APIs) can serve as a valuable tool for implementing applications, as well as for implementing such full-featured resource managers and other types of layered services. The MRAPI WG was chaired by Jim Holt.
In 2013, the Multicore Task Management API (MTAPI) working group released its first specification. MTAPI is a standard specification for an application program interface (API) that supports the coordination of tasks on embedded parallel systems with homogeneous and heterogeneous cores. Core features of MTAPI are runtime scheduling and mapping of tasks to processor cores. Due to its dynamic behavior, MTAPI is intended for optimizing throughput on multicore-systems, allowing the software developer to improve the task scheduling strategy for latency and fairness. This working group was chaired by Urs Gleim of Siemens.
In 2013, the Multicore Programming Practices (MPP) working group delivered a multicore software programming guide for the industry that aids in improving consistency and understanding of multicore programming issues. The MPP guide provides best practices leveraging the C/C++ language to generate a guide of genuine value to engineers who are approaching multicore programming. This working group is chaired by Rob Oshana of Freescale Semiconductor and David Stewart of CriticalBlue.

<doc id="18541350" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18541350" title="Ignatian Volunteer Corps">
Ignatian Volunteer Corps

The Ignatian Volunteer Corps (IVC) exists to address the greatest social needs of U.S. cities with the experience and skills of mature adults. Ignatian Volunteers, men and women age 50 and older, donate 600 hours of service a year and are supported and sustained by IVC’s unique spiritual reflection program. 
History.
In response to both the growing retired and semi-retired community in the U.S. and the desire of mature adults to express their faith in the light of Vatican II, Jim Conroy S.J. and Charlie Costello S.J. launched Ignatian Volunteer Corps (IVC). IVC began in September 1995 with eleven Ignatian Volunteers in three cities (Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington D.C.). Ignatian Volunteers began by serving children and adults in need and reflecting together on their service experiences. Today, IVC has almost 300 volunteers working in 15 regions across the country. The organization relies on a network of Regional Directors and Regional Councils, led by an Executive Director and a national Board of Directors. The IVC national office is located in Baltimore, Maryland.
In 2002, Jim Conroy stepped down from the Executive director position in order to continue his Jesuit mission of service elsewhere. He still maintains contact with IVC and serves on the Board of Directors.
On October 29, 2004, Charlie Costello died from ill health.
The Program.
Ignatian Volunteers commit to 600 hours of service (roughly two days a week) in a year. IVC works with partner community organizations addressing a myriad of social ills and working to create a more just world. After being accepted into IVC, an Ignatian Volunteer visits one or more service sites from among those suggested by the Regional Director and discerns the best fit. Ignatian Volunteers receive no material compensation for their work, remain in their own homes and continue to be involved in their family, parish and community activities.
“We had the experience but missed the meaning.” This quote by T.S. Eliot from “The Four Quartets” is frequently referenced within IVC literature. It refers to IVC’s focus on reflection as one is engaged in service. In order to encourage Ignatian Volunteers not to “miss the meaning” of their service, IVC offers a strong program of reflection based in the Ignatian tradition. The program includes journaling, one-on-one spiritual conversations, group reflection and sharing, and retreats. 
IVC's Roots.
IVC accepts and encourages Ignatian volunteers of all Christian faiths. The program itself is rooted in the spirituality of St. Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Society of Jesus. While members of the Society of Jesus, or Jesuits, are members of a religious order, IVC is one way among many for lay people to experience Ignatian spirituality. Ignatian spirituality is the practice of taking time to reflect and pray, to imitate Jesus and to discern God’s calling. IVC borrows much from St. Ignatius of Loyola - his compassion; his commitment to people who are poor, marginalized, and abandoned; his desire to serve and bring about reconciliation in the world through love. IVC encourages its Volunteers to proceed in such a way of pilgrimage and labor in Christ. 
The concepts of mission and reflection surface frequently in the Spiritual Reflection component of IVC. To a follower of Ignatian spirituality, service and reflection reinforce each other and seek to unite the volunteer with a very real notion of charity and, therefore, mission to live as “men and women for others”. Ignatius writes in The Spiritual Exercises, "Consider the address which Christ our Lord makes to all his servants and friends whom He sends on this enterprise, recommending to them to seek to help all, first by attracting them to the highest spiritual poverty, and should it please the Divine Majesty, and should he deign to choose them for it, even to actual poverty." IVC promotes in mature adults the expression of divine love through service of and in the world.
2007 CARA Study.
In January 2007, IVC turned to the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate (CARA) at Georgetown University in order to better understand the effect of IVC on its former and current Ignatian Volunteers, spouses and spiritual reflectors. The resulting national survey of volunteers found that over 93% felt that their service in IVC had helped them feel that they were spending their retirement in a fulfilling way. 91% of volunteers felt that the spiritual reflection component of IVC had somewhat or very much helped them to see God in the people they served. One volunteer said, “The most satisfying was the looks on the faces of nearly a dozen cook-trainees when I responded to an inquiry by one of them as to why I did this individual resource for them. I answered: “Because I love you.” The silence was absolute for maybe a minute and then they all stood as one and applauded; at least four of us were crying.”

An Unfinished Journey

An Unfinished Journey is a posthumous collection of essays by Shiva Naipaul, published by Hamish and Hamilton in 1986.
The foreword is written by the author's father-in-law, Douglas Stuart, who creates a short biographical sketch of the author, describing Shiva as a writer who gained in discipline but was painfully slow, even at times spending an entire afternoon trying to finish a sentence. He also asked Naipaul why he had lost the comic tone in his writing, and wrote that Naipaul attributed it to the arresting horror of witnessing the aftermath of the Jonestown Massacre, part of his research for the book Black & White.
The essays in the collection are in part autobiographical, such as those on Shiva's relationship with his brother VS Naipaul, and his experiences in Australia and other countries. The titular essay is the beginning of an unfinished (due to death) travel book about South East Asia. Also included is an essay called The Illusion of the Third World originally commissioned by Channel 4 Television.

Performance Intelligence refers to technologies that utilize standard Business Intelligence techniques on performance-related IT metrics. Traditionally, the performance metrics are loaded into a set of tables that resemble the table structure of a data warehouse. Analysis is performed with standard Business Intelligence techniques such as slicing, dicing, drilling down and the trend analysis.
This type of analysis is useful, because it allows the user to quickly look at the data from several perspectives to see trends or anomalies that they might miss while looking at data in a more granular form.

He was elected as Ward 7 member of the Council of the District of Columbia in 1992 and served three terms until his defeat in the September, 2004 primary. In 1998, Chavous was an unsuccessful candidate for Mayor of the District of Columbia.
Early life and education.
He was born and raised in the Butler-Tarkington neighborhood of Indianapolis, Indiana. He is the oldest of four children born to Harold P. Chavous, a pharmacist, and Bettie J. Chavous, a homemaker. Chavous’ first job was working in Chavous Drugs, the family drug store, sweeping and mopping floors and stocking shelves.
Chavous was educated at Brebeuf Jesuit Preparatory School in Indianapolis and Wabash College in Crawfordsville, Indiana, where he earned a BA in Political Science. While at Wabash, he was NCAA Division III District All-American in basketball. Chavous also earned a JD degree from the Howard University School of Law, where he was President of his law school class. He is a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity.
Personal life.
In 1982, Chavous married attorney and law school classmate, Beverly Bass Chavous. The couple divorced in 2009. They have two sons, Kevin Bass Chavous, born November 10, 1984, and Eric Bass Chavous, born March 13, 1990.
Political career.
In 1992, Chavous waged an aggressive door-to-door campaign against longtime Ward 7 incumbent H.R. Crawford and school board member, Nate Bush. Chavous upset both, winning the Ward 7 Council seat with 42% of the vote.
After being re-elected in 1996, Chavous became Chairman of the Education, Libraries and Recreation Committee. His elevation as the committee chair coincided with the passage of charter school legislation in the District. Under his committee chairmanship, the DC charter school movement became the most prolific in the nation, with over 25% of the District’s public school children attending public charter schools.
In 1998, Chavous ran for Mayor in the Democratic Party primary. He finished second to eventual nominee and future Mayor, Anthony A. Williams. Chavous was re-elected to the Council in 2000 with 53% of the vote.
In 2003, Chavous and Mayor Williams publicly supported a controversial proposal by President George W. Bush and Education Secretary Rod Paige for a federal school voucher program designed for low income District schoolchildren. The program was part of a three sector initiative in which the federal government provided 50 million dollars to support DC public schools, DC public charter schools and the voucher program. While the voucher program has successfully educated thousands of DC children, Chavous was roundly criticized for supporting it at the time. He lost his 2004 re-election bid to Vincent Gray.
National Education Reform Advocacy.
Since leaving the Council of the District of Columbia in 2005, Chavous has emerged as a leader in the national education reform and parental school choice movement. In 2008, Chavous served on Barack Obama’s campaign education policy committee. He is also a Distinguished Fellow with the Center for Education Reform (CER) and a board member with the Black Alliance for Educational Options (BAEO). Chavous is a co-founder and Board Chair of Democrats for Education Reform (DFER), a New York based political action committee whose mission is to encourage the Democratic Party to embrace progressive policies which will fundamentally reform American public education.
Chavous is the author of the book "Serving Our Children: Charter Schools and the Reform of American Public Education" (2004, ISBN 1-931868-69-7).

Elliott Danforth

Elliott Danforth (March 6, 1850 in Middleburgh, Schoharie County, New York – January 7, 1906 in Manhattan, New York City) was an American lawyer and politician.
Life.
He was the son of Peter S. Danforth, a justice of the New York Supreme Court. He studied law with his father and was admitted to the bar in 1871. On December 17, 1874, he married Ida Prince, and they had a son, Edward Danforth, and a daughter. In 1878, he removed to Bainbridge, N.Y., where his father-in-law was President of the First National Bank. There, Danforth practiced law in partnership with George H. Winsor, and was President of the Corporation of Bainbridge.
He was a delegate to the 1880 and 1884, 1888, 1892, 1896, 1900 and 1904 Democratic National Conventions.
He was Deputy Treasurer under Lawrence J. Fitzgerald from 1885 to 1889, and was New York State Treasurer from 1890 to 1893, elected in 1889 and 1891. 
In November 1891, he was a member of the State Board of Canvassers (made up by the Secretary of State, Treasurer, Comptroller, Attorney General and State Engineer), when the electoral fraud in the Dutchess County senatorial election happened by which Governor David B. Hill gained control of the New York State Senate. The Republican candidate Gilbert A. Deane had received 78 votes more than Democrat Edward B. Osborne, but the Board changed 92 votes and declared Osborne elected by a plurality of 14. The New York Supreme Court issued a writ to Danforth, ordering him to certify the election of Deane, but Danforth refused to obey. For this he and the other members of the Board were fined $500 by Justice D. Cady Herrick. The sentence was later upheld by the New York Court of Appeals.
In August 1893, it became known that Danforth had received a loan of $50,000 (about seven times the annual salary of the Treasurer) from the Madison Square Bank in New York City in exchange for keeping a large amount of State monies in that bank. Danforth managed to withdraw the State's $250,000 from the bank in the early hours of August 9, the day the bank (of which Fitzgerald was a director) closed.
After leaving the Treasury, he resumed the practice of law at New York City. From 1896 to 1898, he was Chairman of the New York State Democratic Committee, and in 1897 campaigned successfully for the election of Alton B. Parker as Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals. In 1898, he ran for Lieutenant Governor of New York with Augustus Van Wyck but they were narrowly defeated by Theodore Roosevelt and Timothy L. Woodruff.
He died from pneumonia at his home at 51, East 58th Street in Manhattan, and was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx, New York).

<doc id="18541460" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18541460" title="Boletus rubellus">
Boletus rubellus

Boletus rubellus, commonly known as the Ruby Bolete, is a small, dainty, brightly coloured member of the "Boletus" genus, with a reddish cap and stipe, and yellow pores. Like many boletes, it stains blue when cut or bruised. It is found in deciduous woodland in autumn. There is some question over its edibility, and it is reportedly of poor quality with a taste of soap.
Taxonomy.
' was one of the pored basidiomycetes to be placed in the genus "Xerocomus" in the past, and is still regarded as such in some texts. The previously commonly used binomial name "Boletus versicolor" (Rostk.), published in 1844, is now reduced to synonymy as it postdates the current name by German mycologist Julius Vincenz von Krombholz which dates from 1836. Its present specific epithet ' is Latin for "somewhat red".
Description.
This mushroom has a cap that is scarlet to raspberry red when young, with a dry velvety texture. The extreme margin often has a pale yellow or white band around it, (as in the photograph on the right) and it discolours darker, and dirtier with age. It is a small bolete, with the cap being rarely over in diameter. The pores are small; pale yellow, and bruise slowly. Sometimes tapering, the stem is slender and long, and may reach . It is lemon yellow at the apex, but red elsewhere, and has a tendency to split or sheer vertically. The flesh is straw-coloured in the cap, and stains slowly blue over the tubes when cut. The flesh of the stem is pale yellow at the apex and yellow further down. At the stem base, the flesh may have a distinct spot of brick-red or orange. The tubes and pores are large and lemon-yellow, and may be greenish tinged when older. The spore print is olive. It smells pleasant, but indistinct, and is said to taste slightly soapy.
Conflicting information on pore size in notable publications is a possible indication that there may be more than one species involved, both in Britain and in North America. Boletus campestris is very similar, and
Boletus bicolor is almost identical. Neither of these are reported in the British Isles. In Europe, this species is often mistaken for the all too similar "Boletus armeniacus" which, however, does not show the same red coloration in the stem base.
Distribution and habitat.
Uncommon to rare in Southern England, occurring largely with oak ("Quercus"). It also appears in Europe, and the Eastern United States. A similar species noted as "cf versicolor" has been collected from Victoria in southeastern Australia.
Edibility.
It is edible, but often maggoty, and some sources describe the taste as soapy.

Pont-ar-Gothi

Pont-ar-gothi (otherwise Pontargothi or Cothi Bridge) is a village in Carmarthenshire, West Wales. 
The village takes its name from the bridge where the A40 road trunk road crosses the River Cothi. It lies some east of Carmarthen.
Cothi Bridge Show.
Cothi Bridge Agricultural Society was established in 1898. The Cothi Bridge Show contains breeders and exhibitors and attracts visitors from a large area. The ladies section of the show was introduced in 1972.
Holy Trinity Church.
Holy Trinity church is almost entirely due to the work of one man, Henry Bath, whose family made a fortune as Cornish tin producers and then, when the tin ran out, exported coal from Swansea and imported copper ore and guano. The coming of the railway to the Tywi Valley had allowed Bath to buy land to build a mansion and commute to Swansea. Alltyferin, a substantial Victorian house, was completed in 1868. An ardent churchman, Bath did not want to enforce English services on the parish church in Llanegwad. Construction of Holy Trinity church began in 1865, but it was not dedicated until 1878. It is a Grade II* listed building 
The church was built on land which had belonged to Talley Abbey, half a mile from the mansion and linked to it by a wooden bridge over the Cothi. The bridge was later taken down at the same time as Alltyferin mansion. The architect was Benjamin Bucknall, who was a friend of the Baths and had worked with them on Swansea docks. Bucknall employed his friend Alfred Stansell to paint murals and the interior is richly decorated. Biblical scenes form a frieze and the ceiling and the walls are covered in Gothic patterns. Over the years fumes from a coke heater blackened every surface until the paintings were hardly visible. In 2007 the interior was restored to the original colours. The restoration uncovered a further signature near the roof, ""Rawlins, Taunton"", who was presumably an assistant to Stansell. 
Bath only ever saw the plans of the church, as he died on a voyage home from Chile in 1875 at the age of 54. His nephew, Edward, inherited and continued the work. Bath and his wife, having no children, had been generous benefactors to the locality, building a school so that the tenants' children did not have to walk to Llanegwad.
War Memorial Hall.
The village hall was built in remembrance of local men who died in WW1. The Hall is used for a wide range of activities and events.

<doc id="18541490" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18541490" title="Great Retreat (Russian)">
Great Retreat (Russian)

The Great Retreat was a Russian retreat from Galicia and Poland during World War I.
Background.
During this period, the buildup of forces generally favored the Central Powers. Four new German armies, the 11th, 12th, Army of the Niemen and Army of the Bug, were being formed up, dramatically shifting the balance of power in the area, with 13 Central armies facing nine Russian. Under pressure from the Kaiser, Falkenhayn gave in to Hindenburg and Ludendorff's insistence that the offensive be continued.
Stavka decided to start a strategic retreat in order to gain time needed for the massive buildup of war industries at home.
Offensive.
After the Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive in early June 1915, Mackensen's armies crossed the San River and captured Przemyśl. On 22 June, the Russians left the Galician capital of Lvov. Between June 23 and 27 the Germans crossed the Dniester. In early July, Mackensen had to stop his offensive due to Russian counterattacks.
On 13 July, the Central Powers' armies opened a new offensive across the entire front. Outnumbered and still off-balance due to the earlier actions, the southern end of the Russian line collapsed and started moving northward, retreating to the Ivangorod-Lublin-Chełm line.
More worryingly, the German Tenth and Niemen armies pressed through on the extreme north end of the line, once again leading to the possibility of an encirclement of an entire Russian army.
By 13 July, the entire southern wing had been pushed back another to the Bug River, leaving only a small portion of Congress Poland in Russian hands, anchored on Warsaw and the Ivangorod fortress. On 22 July, armies of Central Powers crossed the Vistula river. On August, the Russian Fourth army left the Ivangorod fortress. With the continuing Russian retreat, Warsaw became isolated, and the German 12th Army (under Gallwitz) seized the opportunity and conquered it on 4–5 August.
New attacks by the German Eighth, Tenth and Twelfth armies moving south out of Prussia soon caused even this front to collapse, sending the entire northern end of the Russian lines streaming backward, eventually forming a line running north-south at about the pre-war eastern Prussian border.
The Germans, after having received considerable reinforcements, took Brest-Litovsk on 25 August. On 19 September, Hindenburg's forces captured Vilna.
Aftermath.
At this point, the German advance was finally executed. The frontline now ran from the Baltic Sea to the Romanian border by the Riga-Jakobstadt-Dünaburg-Baranovichi-Pinsk-Dubno-Ternopil line.
On 21 August 1915, Tsar Nicholas II dismissed Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich and took direct control of the army.

Starlight Express (song)

"Starlight Express" is the 'showstopper' number from the musical "Starlight Express". In the show, it is performed by Rusty, the show's protagonist. Before the song, he has been told by the old steam engine Poppa of a magical locomotive, named the Starlight Express, who will aid him in need.
The song has been rewritten in many languages, but has always kept the same title, apart from when the production opened in Mexico, when both the show and the song were renamed "Expreso Astral".
Music and lyrics.
The music was written by Andrew Lloyd Webber, in the key of E flat major, modulating to E major at the instrumental. In the Broadway production, Greg Mowry sings the song in the key of G major and modulates to Ab. The lyrics were written by Richard Stilgoe.
Before the song starts, Poppa and Rusty have the following (sung) conversation;
The song begins, and the introduction is the main theme played on a harmonica, and this is repeated for the instrumental.
Revision.
The song has undergone some revision since the show was premiered in London. The first draft started with the line
However, the verses were rewritten when the show opened on Broadway, in Germany, Japan and Australia. To fit the new tune, new words were written, starting with:
A new middle eight was added as well.
When the show was revised in London, both drafts were fused together, with the verses from London and the middle eight from later productions. This draft has become the most popular and well-used.
The original London tune has been revived for the revised Bochum production.
Thematic value.
The tune to the chorus is used throughout the show, for instance, when Rusty first hears of the Starlight Express; during the 'Starlight Sequence'; and when Rusty triumphs over his challengers (see main article). It is probably meant to show a point where there is a strong development in Rusty's character.
Starlight Express Introduction.
The Starlight Express Introduction was performed on Broadway and in London by Poppa and Belle. In later revisions, it is performed only by Poppa and has been shortened significantly. The number uses the first verse and chorus tunes from the London Production, and is used for the moment when Rusty first hears of the Starlight Express. In the first Bochum version this part was sung by Poppa and Control.
Recordings.
All versions of the song can be found on the following recordings;

The Great Man's Lady

"The Great Man's Lady" is a 1942 American western film directed by William A. Wellman, and starring Barbara Stanwyck and Joel McCrea. The film is based on the short story "The Human Side" by Viña Delmar.
Plot.
A statue is being dedicated to the late founder of Hoyt City, and reporters from around the country have gathered, speculating that "the old lady's going to talk." When the anticipated "old lady" does not appear at the event, they rush to her home. She is centenarian Hannah Sempler (Barbara Stanwyck), who lives in an old mansion among the skyscrapers of Hoyt City. As she confronts the press who have barged in, a photographer says, "Hold it, Mrs. Hoyt!" She replies that her name is Hanna Sempler, and refuses to answer their questions as to whether she and Hoyt had been married, which as another reporter says, would make him a bigamist. The intruders leave, having learned nothing to prove or disprove the many rumors, but Hannah is persuaded to tell her story to a young female biographer who lags behind. She reminisces about her experiences with Ethan Hoyt (Joel McCrea) in the American West. 
In 1848, a teenaged Hannah Sempler is squired by her wealthy father's associate, Mr. Cadwallader (Lloyd Corrigan), but she is not interested. Hannah meets and flirts with a young pioneer and dreamer, Ethan Hoyt, who comes to her home seeking financial backing from her father (Thurston Hall) in order to build a city in the western wilderness. Her father rejects Ethan's proposal, stating that it is too risky. Hannah, however, falls in love with the young man, and quite impulsively, they elope and head west. The first years of their marriage are not easy, but the couple are happy. When Ethan loses all his money and possessions in a drunken gambling spree to Steely Edwards (Brian Donlevy), Hannah wins back his losses and befriends Steely, who accompanies the couple to Sacramento, where they hope to strike it rich mining.
In Sacramento, Hannah and Ethan spend less time together, with Ethan working long hours in the mines. One day, Hannah discovers silver on Ethan's boots, carried from the Virginia City mine where he had been working. Hannah knows she is pregnant, but does not reveal this to Ethan, knowing he would never leave her behind in that condition. Instead she encourages Ethan to go to Virginia City and find his fortune in the silver mines. Thinking his wife wants him gone so she can be with Steely, Ethan leaves her with no intention of returning. 
After he leaves for Virginia City, the friendship between Hannah and Steely grows. Steely in fact looks after Hannah and her twin babies. When Sacramento is threatened by torrential flooding, Hannah plans to travel to San Francisco. But knowing that Hannah still loves Ethan, Steely arranges for her to travel by coach to Virginia City to be with her husband—he will go to San Francisco alone. As the coach crosses a bridge near Sacramento, the river overflows and washes away the coach and its passengers. Hannah alone survives; the babies perish. 
After burying the twins, and believing that Hannah is also dead, Steely travels to Virginia City to tell Ethan the tragic news. It has been years since they've seen or spoken, and by now Ethan has become a wealthy man. When Steely tells him that Hannah is dead, Ethan shoots him, saying, "He killed my wife." Thinking that Hannah and Steely are now dead—Steely actually survives the shooting—Ethan continues his dream of building a great city.
Steely returns to Sacramento and discovers that Hannah is still alive. He tells her that Ethan, who believes she is dead, has married another woman. Steely and Hannah move to San Francisco and open a gambling casino. Years later, Hannah's father visits her and urges her to "disappear" so as not to threaten the political future of Ethan Hoyt, who is now representing her father's railroad interests. Hannah refuses her father's request, and travels to Hoyt City, where she watches Ethan giving a political speech. No longer a champion of the people as he once dreamed of becoming, Ethan is now a man of wealth and power, participating in corrupt practices to achieve private goals. Ethan sees Hannah in the crowd and they meet. She tells him that she had divorced him, knowing his political future would be ruined by scandal if it were known they were still married. She reminds him of the dreamer he once was. He goes off with a renewed idealism, devoting the rest of his life to helping the less fortunate, even at his own expense.
The story concludes as it started, with the aged Hannah and the young female biographer discussing Ethan Hoyt, standing beneath the impressive statue. Hannah has been alone for many years now, Steely having died in the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake, the same year that Ethan returned to Hoyt City, to die in Hannah's mansion. No one knew why he chose to do this, and for some thirty more years Hannah has remained silent about their marriage. The biographer now realizes the profound role that Hannah played in Ethan's life and success, and in the founding of this now great city. Also aware of Ethan's mythic reputation, she kisses Hannah sweetly, saying, "I'm kissing my biography Ethan goodbye." Before Hanna leaves the statue, the old woman tears up the marriage certificate she has kept all these years, saying of his myth (and perhaps their relationship), "Forever, Ethan. Now no one can change it. Forever."

Daniel Gillespie

Daniel Thomas Gillespie (born 1938) is a physicist who is best known for his derivation in 1976 of the stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA), also called the Gillespie algorithm. The SSA is a procedure for numerically simulating the time evolution of the molecular populations in a chemically reacting system in a way that takes account of the fact that molecules react in whole numbers and in an essentially random way. Since the late 1990s, the SSA has been widely used to simulate chemical reactions inside living cells, where the small molecular counts of some reactant species often invalidate the differential equations of traditional deterministic chemical kinetics.
Gillespie's original derivation of the SSA began by considering how chemical reactions actually occur in a well-stirred dilute gas. Reasoning from physics (and not by heuristically extrapolating deterministic reaction rates to a stochastic context), he showed that the probability that a specific reaction will occur in the next very small time "dt" could be written as an explicit function of the current species populations multiplied by "dt". From that result he deduced, using only the laws of probability, an exact formula for the joint probability density function "p"("τ,j") of the time "τ" to the next reaction event and the index "j" of that reaction. The SSA consists of first generating random values for "τ" and "j" according to "p"("τ,j"), and then actualizing the next reaction accordingly. The generating step of the SSA can be accomplished using any of several different methods, and Gillespie's original paper presented two: the "direct method", which follows from a straightforward application of the well known Monte Carlo inversion method for generating random numbers; and the "first-reaction method", which is less straightforward but mathematically equivalent. Later workers derived additional methods for generating random numbers according to Gillespie's function "p"("τ,j") which offer computational advantages in various specific situations. Gillespie's original derivation of the SSA applied only to well-stirred dilute gas systems. It was widely assumed/hoped that the SSA would also apply when the reactant molecules are solute molecules in a well-stirred dilute solution with many smaller solvent molecules. In fact it does, but that was not definitively established until 2009. The extent to which the SSA is valid under other typical cellular conditions, such as when the reactant molecules crowd each other or when they move by active transport mechanisms along physically confined pathways, remains to be seen.
The SSA is one component of stochastic chemical kinetics, a field that Gillespie played a major role in developing and clarifying through his later publications. His broader research has produced articles on cloud physics, random variable theory, Brownian motion, Markov process theory, electrical noise, light scattering in aerosols, and quantum mechanics.
Education.
Born in Missouri, Gillespie grew up in Oklahoma where he graduated from Shawnee High School in 1956. In 1960 he received his B.A. (Magna cum Laude) with a major in physics from Rice University.
Gillespie received his Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University in 1968 with a dissertation in experimental elementary particle physics under Aihud Pevsner. Part of his dissertation derived procedures for stochastically simulating high-energy elementary particle reactions using digital computers, and Monte Carlo methodology would play a major role in his later work. During his graduate student years at JHU he was also a Jr. Instructor (1960–63) and an Instructor (1966-68) in the sophomore General Physics course.
Career.
From 1968 to 1971, Gillespie was a Faculty Research Associate at the University of Maryland College Park's Institute for Molecular Physics. He did research in classical transport theory with Jan Sengers. In 1971 he was also an Instructor in the University's Physics Department.
From 1971 to 2001, Gillespie was a civilian scientist at the Naval Weapons Center in China Lake, California. Initially he was a Research Physicist in the Earth and Planetary Sciences Division. There his research in cloud physics led to a procedure for simulating the growth of raindrops in clouds, and that prompted his paper on the SSA. In 1981 he became Head of the Research Department's Applied Mathematics Research Group, and in 1994 he was made a Senior Scientist in the Research Department.
Since his retirement from China Lake in 2001, Gillespie has been a private consultant in computational biochemistry, working under contract for various periods of time with the California Institute of Technology, the Molecular Sciences Institute (in Berkeley), the Beckman Institute (at Caltech), and the University of California, Santa Barbara. Most of this work has been, and continues to be, in collaboration with the Linda Petzold research group in the Computer Sciences Department of UCSB.

Hungarian Fantasy (Liszt)

The Fantasia on Hungarian Folk melodies (German: "Fantasie über ungarische Volksmelodien"), commonly known in short form simply as the Hungarian Fantasy, is Franz Liszt's arrangement for piano and orchestra of his Hungarian Rhapsody No. 14, originally for solo piano. The Fantasia was written in 1852 and premiered in Pest on June 1, 1853, with Hans von Bülow as soloist and Ferenc Erkel conducting the orchestra.
Overview.
During Liszt's lifetime, his Hungarian Rhapsodies were among his most popular works. Because of this popularity, he may have been under pressure to produce versions of them for piano and orchestra. The present work is the only such work that Liszt is known to have produced. However he may, at the end of his life, have helped his student Sophie Menter with her "Concerto in the Hungarian Style" (1885), a work which was clearly influenced by the Hungarian Fantasy.
A slow introduction by the orchestra is followed by a solo cadenza before proceeding to the main body of the work. The bold, marchlike main theme of the work, as in the version for solo piano, is the Hungarian folk song "Mohac's Field," with a long-short-short-long rhythm. While much of the piece's thematic material is derived from this song, there is also a section in A minor marked "in gypsy style" ("alla zingarese"). 
While the Fantasia is in the same style and tradition as the Hungarian Rhapsodies, it differs structurally from them. The Rhapsodies generally present a clear succession of three traditional scales — lassan, czifra, and friska. These dances are evident in the Fantasia, particularly in the long and brilliant friska section. However, Liszt is freer and wider-ranging in his combination and juxataposition of material than he usually is in this type of work.

Foymount, Ontario

Foymount is a small community situated in the township of Bonnechere Valley, Ontario, Canada, located on the Opeongo Road in Renfrew County, west of Eganville. Foymount is approximately 125 kilometres (80 mi) due west of Ottawa.
Foymount is Ontario's highest populated point at above sea level.
The community was named for John Foy, postmaster.
Foymount and the surrounding area is a popular destination for backpackers and hikers, and was the location of warranty and repair facilities for camping equipment manufacturer Sierra Designs. However, the outlet closed on August 26, 2010.
The location is also popular for amateur astronomers given the high altitude and low levels of artificial light.
Canadian military history.
Because of the high altitude, the Royal Canadian Airforce built a radar base on the site in the 1950s as part of the Pinetree Radar Line, established for the detection of nuclear bombers coming over the polar region from the Soviet Union. Canadian Forces Station (CFS) Foymount was closed in 1974 because more powerful radar installations that overlapped Foymount's coverage area were built at Canadian Forces Station (CFS) Falconbridge in Ontario and CFS Lac St. Denis in Quebec. The site is now a popular destination for "ghost town" enthusiasts.
Telecommunications and broadcasting.
The high-altitude site is also popular for the purpose of radio and television transmission. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation operates a rebroadcast transmitter (CBOT-TV-1) at the site. In 2006 the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission rejected an application for United Christian Broadcasters Canada to begin operating a rebroadcast transmitter on the site.

Hans-Egon Richert

Hans-Egon Richert (June 2, 1924 – November 25, 1993) was a German mathematician who worked primarily in analytic number theory. He is the author (with Heini Halberstam) of a definitive book on sieve theory.
Life and education.
Hans-Egon Richert was born in 1924 in Hamburg, Germany. He attended the University of Hamburg and received his Ph.D under Max Deuring in 1950. He held a temporary chair at the University of Göttingen and then a newly created chair at the University of Marburg. In 1972 he moved to the University of Ulm, where he remained until his retirement in 1991. He died on November 25, 1993 in Blaustein, near Ulm, Germany.
Work.
Richert worked primarily in analytic number theory, and beginning around 1965 started a collaboration with Heini Halberstam and shifted his focus to sieve theory. For many years he was a chairman of the Analytic Number Theory meetings at the Mathematical Research Institute of Oberwolfach.
Analytic number theory.
Richert made contributions to additive number theory, Dirichlet series, Riesz summability, the multiplicative analog of the Erdős–Fuchs theorem, estimates of the number of non-isomorphic abelian groups, and bounds for exponential sums. He proved the exponent 15/46 for the Dirichlet divisor problem, a record that stood for many years.
Sieve methods.
One of Richert's notable results was the Jurkat–Richert theorem, joint work with Wolfgang B. Jurkat that improved the Selberg sieve and is used in the proof of Chen's theorem.
Richert also produced a "readable form" of Chen's theorem (it is covered in the last chapter of "Sieve Methods").
Halberstam & Richert's book "Sieve Methods" was the first exhaustive account of the subject.
In reviewing the book in 1976, Hugh Montgomery wrote "In the past, researchers have generally derived the sieve bounds required for an application, but now workers will find that usually an appeal to an appropriate theorem of "Sieve methods" will suffice," and "For years to come, "Sieve methods" will be vital to those seeking to work in the subject, and also to those seeking to make applications."

National parks and nature reserves of Israel

National parks of Israel are declared historic sites or nature reserves, which are mostly operated and maintained by the National Nature and Parks Authority. As of 2005, Israel maintains more than 150 nature reserves that protect 2,500 species of indigenous wild plants, 20 species of fish, 400 species of birds and 70 species of mammals.
Some parks are located at archaeological sites such as Tel Megiddo, Beit She'an, Ashkelon and Kursi. Others, such as the Alexander stream, Mount Carmel National Park or Hurshat Tal focus on nature and the preservation of local flora and fauna. Several parks and nature reserves have camping options, such as tent grounds and bungalows, open to small groups and individual campers. Some of them are located in the Israeli occupied Golan Heights and the West Bank.
In 2011, the most popular national parks were Yarkon National Park, Caesarea, Ein Gedi and Tel Dan.
History.
During the 19th century, the region was sparsely populated, with a population between 275,000 and 475,000. Waves of immigration expanded local population needs. Forests were cut down to supply coal for heating, industry and the Turkish railway. The German Templars brought with them shotguns, quickly adopted by local peasants. The First World War was characterized by massive acquisition of firearms. By the early 20th century, hunting threatened the extinction of crocodiles, ostriches, deer, fallow deer, Syrian Brown Bears, onagers and cheetahs. 
As a result, the British Mandatory government passed laws aimed at saving the local flora and fauna. In 1924 a Hunting Act was published and in 1926 a Forest Ordinance were published. Many sites, such as the forests of Mount Carmel and Mount Meron, were declared forest reserves; certain trees were declared protected.
In 1953 the Knesset passed the Wildlife Protection Law (חוק הגנת חיות-הבר) and the Minister of Agriculture was appointed for its implementation. In 1955, the department for the improvement of the country's landscape (המחלקה לשיפור נוף הארץ) was established in the Israeli Prime Minister's Office, which was assigned the establishment of tourist infrastructure. The department established a number of well-known national parks, such as Gan HaShlosha, Caesarea, Shivta and Avdat. Following the drying of the Lake Hula and the public pressure, the Hula Reserve was established, which was the first declared nature reserve in Israel (in 1964). In 1963 the Knesset approved the "National parks and nature reserves act" (חוק הגנים הלאומיים ושמורות הטבע) (the legislation process of the law began already in 1956). As a result, two authorities were established: the National Parks Authority and the Nature Reserves Authority. In 1998 the two authorities were merged into one body - Israel Nature and Parks Authority.

Schwäbisches Turmuhrenmuseum

The Schwäbisches Turmuhrenmuseum in Mindelheim, Germany is a small horological museum dedicated to the history of towerclocks.
The museum is open every Saturday afternoon and the last Sunday afternoon of each month from 14h00 to 17h00 as well as anytime for groups by special appointment. It is located in a former historic church, the Silvesterkirche, at Hungerbachgasse 9, 87719 Mindelheim, as well as the associated clocktower, the Kappelturm (49 meters high, 155 steps to climb). Large working towerclocks are located on every floor of the tower, allowing the visitor to fully experience towerclocks in their natural environment.
Collection.
The collection focuses on towerclocks from the 16th through the early 20th century. It is particularly strong in German towerclocks of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Altogether over 50 clocks are displayed, most of them in running condition. A special attraction is the world's second longest clock pendulum, over 9 meters long, ticking once every five seconds, housed in the tower. Their showpiece is the 1750 abbey clock from Füssen, a one of a kind piece forged by one of the monks. Another attraction is the replica of a 1529 clock with astronomical indications showing the location of sun and moon, as well as the occurrence of eclipses.
History.
The building, a church, originally dates from 1409, but was extensively adjusted to the baroque style of the time in 1763. It was desecularized in 1804 and became the towerclock museum in 1979, when the formerly private collection of Wolfgang Vogt became a public municipal museum.

<doc id="18541636" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18541636" title="United States v. Brignoni-Ponce">
United States v. Brignoni-Ponce

United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, , was the case in which the Supreme Court determined it was a violation of the Fourth Amendment for a roving patrol car to stop a vehicle solely on the basis of the driver appearing to be of Mexican descent. A roving patrol car must have articulable facts that allow for an officer to have a reasonable suspicion that the person is carrying illegal aliens beyond their ethnicity. The Court handed down a 9-0 decision that affirmed the Circuit Court’s ruling in the case.
Background.
As part of normal procedure for the United States Border Patrol in Southern California there was a permanent traffic checkpoint set up Interstate 5 just outside of San Clemente, California. On March 11, 1973, the checkpoint had been closed because of inclement weather so the officers sat on the side of the highway in their vehicle with their headlights facing northbound traffic. They pursued a vehicle with three occupants in it, stating later that their only reason for pursuing the vehicle was because of the occupant's apparent Mexican ethnicity.
The officers questioned Felix Humberto Brignoni-Ponce and his two passengers about their citizenship and discovered that Brignoni-Ponce's two passengers had entered the country illegally. The officers proceeded to arrest the three individuals. The driver was charged with two counts of knowingly transporting illegal immigrants, a violation of § 274 (a) (2) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 66 Stat. 228 and the two passengers were arrested for entering the country illegally.
At the trial for the defendant, he argued that the two passengers should not have to testify because their statements were the result of an illegal seizure, but his motion was denied. The two passengers testified and the defendant was found guilty of both counts. The defendant then appealed the decision saying that because the stop was based solely on the basis of his ethnicity, it was a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. The Fourth Amendment protects a person from unreasonable search and seizures.
Border Patrol's Argument.
The Border Patrol derived its power to stop the individuals from two separate laws. The first was Section 287 (a) (1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U. S. C. § 1357 (a) (1), authorizes any officer or employee of the Immigration and Naturalization Service without a warrant, "to interrogate any alien or person believed to be an alien as to his right to be or to remain in the United States." The second was Section 287 (a) (3) of the Act, 8 U. S. C. § 1357 (a) (3), which authorizes agents, without a warrant, to search cars traveling near the border that are suspected to have or are transporting person trying to enter the country illegally. From this, they believe that their actions were lawful even if an act of Congress cannot supersede the Constitution.
Court's Decision.
The Court took into question where the line was drawn between the state's interest in protecting the border from illegal entry and protections provided by the Fourth Amendment. The Border Patrol has the nearly impossible task of securing a 2,000-mile long border where many people illegally cross on foot and then are transported by smugglers in private cars. To ensure the safety of the border, it is necessary for the Border Patrol to stop suspicious vehicles that may be carrying illegal aliens and investigate their right to be in the United States.
In contrast to the state’s interest, individuals must be protected from unreasonable interference in their privacy. According to the precedent set in "Terry v. Ohio" and "Adams v. Williams", under appropriate circumstances, a roving patrol may perform a limited search and seizure without having probable cause to arrest the person. These circumstances include information that the person may have drugs or weapons, a visual scan of the person’s vehicle reveals something suspicious or as in this case a visual reason to believe that the person is carrying illegal aliens into the country.
Some examples of what constitutes as suspicion of carrying illegal aliens include driving a station wagon with fold down seats or spare tires removed to conceal aliens, having a low riding vehicle, having an overly packed vehicle, or driving erratically. Also, the officer's knowledge of the area, experience, and training in dealing with illegal aliens dictates the decision to pursue a search. Thus, an officer must have one of these articulable facts in order stop someone and question their citizenship.
However, in this case the defendants were stopped for one reason: solely on the basis of their appeared Mexican ancestry. The court concluded that this reason alone made the stop unreasonable. The lack of articulable facts to generate suspicion that the car was carrying illegal aliens meant that this search was illegal. There are millions of people living in the area around San Diego that are naturalized and native-born of Mexico and "even in the border area, a small proportion of them are aliens." It is unreasonable to assume that any person who appears Mexican is an illegal alien or could be transporting illegal aliens. To allow such unrestricted roving patrol stops would be to subject all residents of the border area to unreasonable searches and seizures just because of their ethnicity, therefore the stop of the defendant was a violation of the Fourth Amendment and the charges were dropped.
History of Felix Humberto Brignoni-Ponce.
Despite being freed from the charges in this case, Brignoni-Ponce was arrested for carrying illegal aliens five times in fifteen years spending over three years in jail for his crimes. His last-known arrest was on February 25, 1981, six years after his Supreme Court Case was decided, at a San Clemente checkpoint smuggling thirteen illegal aliens. Ironically, Brignoni-Ponce was born in Puerto Rico, not of Mexican descent as suspected in his initial stop by the Border Patrol, and is an American citizen.

Hajj Sayyah

Mirza Mohammad Ali (1836–1925), better known as Hajj Sayyah (meaning "the traveler"), was a famous Iranian world traveler and political activist.
Early life.
Hajj Sayyah was born in 1836 in the town of Mahallat in Iran. His studies exposed him at a young age to modern and democratic ideas that were at the time spreading throughout parts of the world. The stark difference he observed between the treatment suffered by most Iranians under their autocratic rulers and the ideas he studied inspired him to see the rest of the world.
Journey.
At the age of 23, Hajj Sayyah embarked on a remarkable journey around the globe that would last for nearly 18 years. He began his travels by wandering throughout Central Asia and Europe for more than six years. Often he traveled alone and in poverty.
The motivation for Hajj Sayyah’s travels was his thirst for knowledge and spiritual strength. He wanted to learn as much as he could about the world and how other people lived, in order to bring those ideas back to Iran. As a result of his observations throughout his travels, he concluded that human beings are supposed to live in reasonably humane societies and enjoy basic human rights.
Hajj Sayyah came to the United States through New York. During his ten year stay in the U.S., he met with many prominent personalities such as President Ulysses Grant on more than one occasion. His travels across the United States eventually took him to San Francisco where he spent several months.
In the course of studying Hajj Sayyahʼs life, Dr. Ali Ferdowsi recently discovered through State Department documents that Hajj Sayyah had become an American citizen on May 26, 1875, making him the first Iranian to become a U.S. citizen.
Political activist.
Upon returning to Iran in July 1877, Hajj Sayyah became politically active and was imprisoned for having instigated a clandestine letter writing campaign to the monarch and clergy regarding the unbearable living conditions in Iran. After his release, fearing further persecution he sought the protection of the United States Legation in Tehran. This move puzzled many Iranians who didn’t know why he felt the United States government would protect him.
Hajj Sayyah went on to play a major role in the Constitutional Revolution of 1906 in Iran, and remained active until his death in 1925 at the age of 89.

Rufus Osgood Mason

Biography.
Mason was the son of Rufus and Prudence (Woods) Mason. He prepared for college at Thetford, Vermont and later graduated at Dartmouth College in 1854. He then entered Union Theological Seminary, 1854–55, before moving to medicine. In 1859, he graduated at the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City (now a part of Columbia University). He became one of the most noted surgeons of his day in New York City.
During The American Civil War, (1861–1864) he became an Assistant Surgeon for The United States Navy. From 1861 to 1864 he served on the USS "Santiago de Cuba". In 1864 he took up medical practice in New York city, where he was attending physician, Northwestern dispensary, until 1869. 
Between the years leaving Union Theological Seminary and entering the medical profession, he became an instructor at a public school in Cleveland, Ohio. It was there that he met, taught, inspired, and befriended "A small Barefoot Boy" named William Rockefeller (Brother of John D. Rockefeller). This relationship would endure through the years, and Mason became "A Rockefeller Patron" toward the advancing of the medical sciences.
Mason was also deeply interested in Metaphysical speculation and theory. His input would help in the early pioneer development of Parapsychology and psychical research. These subjects were published in many books, magazines, and newspaper articles. He is accredited as "An Early Father-Pioneer of Parapsychology" and advance-supporter of the study of applied therapeutic uses of what is known today as Hypnotherapy.
He was a contributing member of The Society for Psychical Research. His main publication was the book "Telepathy and theSubliminal Mind" (1897), and his work focused on case studies and popularization. His chief contributions to the field are considered to be the latter, in the United States, particularly relating to the work of the Society for Psychical Research and the theories of Frederic William Henry Myers.
Much of Mason's research and observations in psychical research would be applied in early ESP, Telepathy, Astral (OOBE) research, and in present day Remote Viewing. The 50th Annual Convention of the Parapsychological Association, September 2007, acclaimed him as an early pioneer in parapsychology and psychical research.
He was married first in New York City to Marian Isabelle Goodwin in July 1871, and married second to Charlotte Louise Quick in 1886. After his death the latter used her inheritance to became a leading patron of the Harlem Renaissance.

The Bothersome Man

The Bothersome Man () is a Norwegian film from 2006. It was directed by Jens Lien after a script by Per H. V. Schreiner. In the main roles were Trond Fausa Aurvåg, Petronella Barker and Per Schaaning. The story is about a man suddenly finding himself in an outwardly perfect, yet essentially soulless dystopia, and his attempt to escape. The film was well received by critics, and was awarded three Amanda Awards in 2006.
Synopsis.
As the movie begins, Andreas Ramsfjell (Trond Fausa Aurvåg) is underground in a train station watching a couple kiss; however, the kiss lacks any sign of aesthetics - on the contrary, it looks hideous and abominable. Andreas seems to be increasingly unsettled until eventually he steps forward and jumps off the track in front of a subway train and the scene abruptly ends. When he awakes he is on a bus which lets him off at a deserted gas station in the middle of nowhere. An older man greets Andreas with a welcome sign and escorts him into a car. From here he makes his way into an ideal city, where he soon finds himself with a corporate job, a furnished apartment and a beautiful girlfriend (Petronella Barker). The seemingly perfect life soon proves to be vacuous. Andreas seems to be the only person in the city capable of experiencing sensation and emotion. The only respite from the emptiness is a meaningless materialism. As the slightly uncomfortable turns into the absurd, Andreas tries to escape, but finds there is no way out of the city. Not even suicide. Eventually he meets Hugo (Per Schaaning), a cleaner who has found a crack in the walls of his basement from which lovely music streams out. The two dig frantically, in secret, through the wall and discover it leads into a house, presumably back in the real world. Andreas manages to get his arm into the house and grabs a handful of cake from the table, but both of them are caught and dragged out of the basement. Andreas gets thrown out of the city on the same bus that brought him there. The film ends with a violent ride into a frozen wasteland where the bus leaves Andreas, bewildered, distraught and alone.
Production.
The story for the film was originally written for radio theatre, two years before it was adapted for the screen. Director Jens Lien tells that he was very affected by Schreiner's script, and that the first time he read it he was unable to sleep. Schreiner and Lien had earlier collaborated on short films, but this was the first feature-length movie they made together. The movie was chosen for the Critics' Week of the Cannes Film Festival, and jury member Christophe Leparc expressed great admiration for the film. The "lovely music" in the basement is actually a recording made for thereminvox.com by theremin veteran Howard Mossman, who remains uncredited.
Reception.
"Den brysomme mannen" was generally very well received by the Norwegian press. The newspaper "Aftenposten" awarded five out of six points, calling the movie "advanced" and filled with literary and filmatic references, yet not without a wider appeal. The television station "NRK" also ended up on five, calling the film thought-provoking and funny, and "very, very good".
International reviews were good. Steve Rose, writing for "The Guardian", gave it three out of five stars. Noting the cultural references to other dystopic works, he complained that the movie failed to get "beneath the surface of this shallow parallel reality". The A.V. Club's Noel Murray called the movie "paced and plotted well throughout", though he felt it veered "too far into fantasyland" towards the end.
The film was awarded three Amandas in 2006: for "Best Direction", "Best Screenplay" and "Best Actor" (Aurvåg). It was also nominated in the categories "Best Film" and "Best Actress" (Barker). The movie also won several international awards, including the ACID Award (Agence du Cinéma Indépendant pour sa Diffusion) at the Cannes Film Festival, and the Golden Starfish at the Hampton International film festival.
Soundtrack.
The film heavily features music by Edvard Grieg. The score is composed by the Norwegian composer Ginge.
Locations.
The volcanic desert scenes were shot in Iceland (source - director q&a on YouTube)

MRT Purple Line

The MRT Purple Line () is a rapid transit line of the Bangkok MRT under construction for the Mass Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand (MRTA) in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region and Nonthaburi Province, Thailand. The project is due to be finished in 2014 and at that point, it will be the city's second MRT line.
Description.
The Purple Line is aimed to serve travel demand between the northwestern suburb of Bangkok in Nonthaburi Province and southern area of Thonburi in Rat Burana District. It also runs through downtown along Samsen Road, passing Rattanakosin old quarter and many historical places in Dusit and Phra Nakhon District like the national library, Thewet market, Bang Lamphu, the Democracy Monument, the Golden Mount, Phahurat, the Memorial Bridge and Wongwian Yai roundabout, and also intends to serve the new Thai parliament construction site at Kiak Kai intersection.
This Line is divided into two sections, Tao Pun - Khlong Bang Phai 23 km, which is under construction, and Tao Pun - Rat Burana, 19.8 km. The section from Tao Pun - Khlong Bang Phai is scheduled to be completed in 2014, but is now due to open on 5 Dec 2015.
This will be the first Bangkok metro line into an adjacent province (Nonthaburi). The section links Tao Pun Station in Bang Sue, Bangkok, to Khlong Bang Phai Station in Bang Bua Thong, Nonthaburi Province. The MRT Blue Line extension between the existing Bang Sue terminus and Tao Pun is constructed as part of copntract 1 to provide an interchange between both lines. The Purple Line will be operated Tao Pun - Khlong Bang Phai, comprising 16 stations along an elevated route. The first stage of construction commenced in early 2010.
The line is indicated by the colour purple on network maps.
Alignment.
The Tao Pun - Khlong Bang Phai section starts from the Tao Pun elevated station at Tao Pun junction, where it transfers to the MRT Blue Line extension. It runs north on a viaduct along Krung Thep-Nonthaburi Road, providing transfer to the Red commuter railway at Bang Son railway station, and approaches Mueang Nonthaburi District of Nonthaburi Province. The line goes further north via Tiwanon Road, passes the Ministry of Public Health, then turns at the Khae Rai intersection to west Nonthaburi via Rattanathibet Road, passes the Nonthaburi Government Centre, crosses the Chao Phraya River on a viaduct parallel to the Phra Nangklao Bridge. Then it continues to a large residential area in Bang Yai District and turns to the north along the Kanchanaphisek Highway, passes Bang Yai market and terminates at Khlong Bang Phai in Bang Bua Thong District. The total length is .
Construction contracts.
Construction is divided into three separate contracts. The first covers Bang Sue - Tao Pun - Phra Nangklao Bridge, with a length of 12 km, comprising nine stations. This contract also includes construction of a 1.2 km extension of the MRT Blue Line from Bang Sue to Tao Pun where the Blue Line and the Purple Line will interchange.
The second contract covers the Phra Nangklao Bridge (including a new bridge) - Bang Yai District - Khlong Bang Phai terminus, with a length of 11 km. and comprising seven stations. The third contract is for the construction of a train depot at the Bang Yai terminus and four park and ride buildings at Khlong Bang Phai, Bang Yai Intersection, Tha It, and the Nonthaburi Intersection station.
The 6th contract, which was due to be awarded in mid-2011 for the laying of track was delayed for over one year due to internal disputes within the MRTA and uncertainty about the bidding process. However, this contract was finalised in October 2012.
In October 2012, the BMCL, private operator of the MRT Blue line, was granted a 30 year concession to operate the Purple line and supply rolling stock & electrical systems.
Stations.
In the table below, an italicized name indicates that the station is under construction and not yet in operation.
Future extension.
The proposed extension from Tao Pun - Rat Burana will run southward through Bangkok's old quarter from Tao Pun junction on a viaduct. It then goes into an underground structure along Sam Sen Road, passing the new Thai parliament site, and transfers to the proposed Red inner-city shortcut commuter at Sanghi intersection. It passes the national library in Dusit District before it reaches Phra Nakhon District at Thewet Market. The line turns east at Bang Lamphu and goes along the city moat to the south, with transfers possible to the planned MRT Orange Line at Ratchadamnoen Road near the Democracy Monument. It also passes the Golden Mount before possible transfers to the southern extension of the Blue Line at Wang Burapha near Yaowarat Road in Chinatown and the Phahurat textile market.
The line crosses the Chao Phraya River near the Memorial Bridge towards the Wongwian Yai roundabout in Thonburi on the west bank, with possible transfers to the Dark Red Line commuter and to Wongwian Yai BTS Station. It continues south to Chom Thong, then on an elevated structure for and terminates in Rat Burana District, a short distance to the nearby Phra Pradaeng suburban town in Samut Prakan Province. The total length will be about 19.8 km, and comprising eleven underground and five elevated stations.
A 4.5 km extension from Bang Yai to Bang Bua Thong Intersection, which is not part of the original Purple Line plan, is under consideration due to a request from the Nonthaburi Governor.
