List of premodern combat weapons

This is a list of historical weapons, divided into categories of melee weapons and ranged weapons. They are further subdivided by weapon type and then ordered alphabetically. Although primarily consisting of cold weapons, early gunpowder weapons are also included.
Weapons are grouped according to their uses, with rough classes set aside for very similar weapons. Some weapons may fit more than one category (e.g. the spear may be used either as a pole weapon or as a projectile). Bladed hilt weapons follow Col. D.H. Gordon's classification where applicable.
Melee weapons.
Hand or fist weapons and fans.
Single-handed weapons not resembling a straight dagger blade, usually wielded without wrist action; often protects the forearm.
Bladed.
Thrusting and slicing weapons for close quarters melee.
Shortswords.
Delineated as 20-28 inches/51–71 cm total length.
Swords.
Long swords were classified by Gordon as longer than 28 inches/71 cm.
Axe-like swords.
Generally, convex blades used for heavy chopping or slashing.
Knives and daggers.
Sickles and sickle-like knives.
Generally short, concave blades used for heavy cutting.
Trauma weapons (clubs).
Wielded with one or two hands at close quarters with swinging motions.
Pole weapons.
Wielded mainly with two hands. Primarily for melee with sweeping, thrusting, and/or hooking motions.
Spears.
Thrown spears and javelins are listed under ranged weapons.
Ranged weapons.
Thrown.
Spears and javelins.
All could be used as polearm spears, but were designed and primarily used for throwing.
Throwing axes.
Could also be used as axe weapons, but were specifically designed for throwing.
Composite projectile weapons.
Having a built-in gun or ranged weapon combined with some other type of weapon.
Flexibles.
Sectional or composite.
Having multiple handles or holdable sections.
Chain weapons.
Having a heavy object attached to a flexible chain. Wielded by swinging, throwing, or projecting the end, as well as wrapping, striking, and blocking with the chain.
Shields.
Used not only to block strikes and missiles but also swung outwardly (or in quick upward motions) to strike an opponent. Also used to rush an opponent (known as shield bashing). Some shields had spikes, sharp edges, or other offensive designs.

Bavarian Pt 2/4 N

The Bavarian Pt 2/4 N was a steam locomotive with the Royal Bavarian State Railways ("Königlich Bayerische Staatsbahn"). It was developed in parallel with the Bavarian Pt 2/3 and for the same duties. Instead of a fixed carrying axle it was given a bogie. This change brought no advantage, so the more cost-effective Pt 2/3 was favoured. The two Pt 2/4 N engines were nevertheless taken over by the Reichsbahn, but were retired by 1928.

AVE Class 102

The AVE Class 102 or S-102 (nicknamed "Pato" in Spanish, because of its nose that looks like the beak of a duck, ""pato"" in Spanish) is a high-speed train used for the AVE service and operated in Spain by the state-run railway company RENFE. Outside of AVE service, Talgo markets this train as Talgo 350.
Further production of closely related trains, differing in seating arrangement resulted in the S-112.
Background, design and orders.
The AVE Class 102 was constructed by Talgo with Adtranz (later Bombardier Transportation) providing the power car technology. It was principally designed for the Madrid-Barcelona line.
The trainsets consist of Talgo passenger cars modified in order to allow speeds of up to with power cars at each end. However, its certified maximum operating speed is due to the limits of its eight motors. The trainsets can consist of up to 12 Talgo series VII coaches.
The train is nicknamed "Pato", Spanish for duck, due to the aerodynamic design of the power cars resembling a beak. The beak design reduces noise created by air resistance at top speeds.
The series trains were intended for a top speed of . This top speed was supposed to be enough to fulfill the tender condition of a two-and-a-half-hour travel time between Madrid and Barcelona. Experts ascribe this reduction compared to original plans to budgetary reasons, which derive from the strongly increased power requirements at even higher speeds.
RENFE Class 112.
RENFE's original order in 2004 was for 16 series units, delivery of which began in 2004. A follow-up order for 30 similar trains to be delivered in 2008-2010 and designated as class 112 (S-112). The first production unit was unveiled in June 2010.
Introduction, testing and operations.
In trials with the prototype unit (later used by track authority ADIF as test train Class 330), on 11 October 2002, was achieved.
Type approval tests began in 2004. Type approval requires test runs at speeds 10% above the desired permitted top speed. During the approval tests, a new record of was achieved in the early hours of 26 June 2004.
After the successful completion of the tests, the first eight series units commenced operation on the Madrid-Zaragoza-Lleida line on 26 February 2005. Initially, maximum service speed was restricted to , due to problems with the train control and signalling system on the line.
After the commissioning of the train control system ETCS Level 1, the top speed was increased in steps. Since 7 May 2007, the trains travel with the top speed targeted for the time being .
After the stabilisation of the train control system ETCS Level 2, the trains may cover the distance of 621 km between Madrid and Barcelona in about 2 hours 30 minutes, with a top speed of . However, presently, non-stop runs are carried by the AVE S-103, while the S-102 are deployed for runs with intermediate stops, with travel times between 2 hours 57 minutes and 3 hours 23 minutes.
Export.
Talgo 350 trains based on the Class 102 design are to be used on the Haramain High Speed Rail Project line in Saudi Arabia under a contract announced in October 2011.

List of Destroy All Humans! characters

This is a list of characters appearing in the "Destroy All Humans!" series.
Main series characters.
Cryptosporidium.
Cryptosporidium (Furon) Cryptosporidium, (also known as simply just "Crypto" for short), is the main protagonist of the entire franchise. He is part of an alien species known as Furons, he is also an anti-hero who enjoys wreaking havoc, destroying and most certainly humiliating the Earth's population and he speaks with an extremely slow and monotone voice. He is known to have a best friend/ally personality with Pox, although he does not like to admit it and enjoys pushing his buttons. He is also known to be an alcoholic, a gambler, a smoker and many other qualities of the sort. His name comes from the Cryptosporidium protist. Crypto's commanding officer is Orthopox 13, who usually gives him his missions. Sometimes, Crypto talks with a variety of wise-cracking remarks. Voiced by J. Grant Albrecht and Sean Donnellan (in "Big Willy Unleashed"). In the Japanese version, he is voiced by Kappei Yamaguchi.
In the game, Crypto uses mental powers and highly advanced technology to overcome his enemies. He uses weapons like the Zap-O-Matic, the Anal Probe, the Disintegrator, or the Ion Detonator, and many more in the sequels. He uses a jetpack for speed and flight across invasion sites and is equipped with a personal shield for protection. In addition, whenever he dies, his body is re-cloned with all his memories, making him virtually immortal. His advanced, alien mind allows him to use several psychic powers like moving and manipulating objects, cortex mind-reading, hypnotizing people, and disguising himself as a human. In the last sequel, he gains the ability to stop time and use the Temporal Fist, an ability that allows him to manipulate and throw objects while time is stopped.
His greatest weapon is his Saucer. It is a vehicle that is his primary means of transportation and has several destructive weapons to use against the human race, like the Death Ray, the Sonic Boom, and the Quantum Deconstructor for the total destruction of buildings, armies, and entire cities. It can also abduct objects and people with its Abducto Beam and cloak itself from sight.
Crypto's clones.
Cryptosporidium-136. - Crypto 137's clone, often referred to as Crypto 137's brother, who is sent to Earth for a mission similar to 137's, collecting human brain stems. Unfortunately, Crypto 136 met an untimely end at the hands of human scientists: sacrificed and dissected in the name of science. Crypto is enraged when he discovers this, and his hatred for humans becomes personal. He presumably had the same personality as 137, as Crypto refers to him as 'me' sometimes (often confusing himself). Crypto-136 was the pilot of a Furon scout ship sent by his boss Orthopox-13, to find a planet that furons visited many eons ago, a planet that was ripe with pure and more complete Furon DNA, which is discovered to be Earth. But while trying to land in an Area-42 (Reference to Area-51), he hovers above a missile in the final seconds of launch, and it fires and hits his ship. His ship crashed and he was taken by the Military and Majestic for experimentation. Silhouette, the leader of Majestic-12, oversaw these events herself and was responsible for his death. He was later given an autopsy.
Cryptosporidium 137 — Wise-cracking, Jack Nicholson-esque protagonist of the first game. He has an unlimited amount of clones that will take his place if he dies during a mission, all of which have the same personality, but an increasing number appended to their name (Crypto 138, Crypto 139, and so on). He likes destroying things, and uses one-liners a lot. He was the successor of Crypto-136, created even when Crypto-136's fate was still unknown. Crypto-137 was the first Furon on Earth for over a million years. In chronological order, Crypto-137 had many notable accomplishments. He destroyed an army task force in an American mid-western farm, in Rockwell he destroyed the Annual Rockwell Fair, assassinated and posed (by using the Holobob) as the Mayor. In Santa Modesta he assassinated the Mayor, destroyed several population food controlled diners controlled by Majestic, killed Sleepy Ernst, then destroyed the Santa Modesta Majestic base. He discovered the fate of Crypto-136 in Area 42, he also blew up Area 42 with a nuclear weapon, as well as blew up the Area 42 Majestic Base with his saucer. He was shot down and captured in Union Town, but soon escaped and destroyed the Union Town Majestic Base. He later visited Capitol City, assassinated the President, he then returned to Union Town and posed as the Navy leader and stopped Silhouette's plan to lead all five divisions of National Defense. Just after that he destroyed General Armquist. He later destroyed Roboprez (the brain of President Huffman put in a robot) and killed Silhouette. After that he permanently impersonated the President (using the Holobob) until his mysterious death between 1957 and 1969 (most likely resulting from being president during John F. Kennedy's assassination).
Cryptosporidium 138 — His clone, Crypto-138, continued to pose as the President until 1969, when the mothership was destroyed by a KGB missile, apparently eliminating his ability to Holobob. His notable achievements include: Saving Bay City from a Revelade blimp armada and vans fitted with nuclear bombs, killing Coyote Bongwater, destroying 'The Rock' (a KGB base). In Albion, he killed Oranchov, met Reginald Ponsonby-Smythe. He also met Natalya Ivanova, a former KGB agent. Later saves Albion from the deadly poison spores. Was betrayed by Ponsonby, but was rescued by Natalya, then killed Ponsonby. He then went to Takoshima where he destroyed both the evil black ninja and Japanese KGB base. He then saved Japan from Kojira (a summer intern at the KGB mutated into a Godzilla-esque creature which regains health by destroying buildings). He then left to Tunguska, where he recovered info about Project Solaris, Destroyed a Blisk warship, and discovered a deadly secret, he then rescued Natalya, and flew to the moon, where he killed Milenkov who turned out to be a blisk, and saved the Earth from the infectious spores, just after Natayla gets shot in the back and is killed. Sometime later, Crypto is lying in his bed in his saucer, with a person next to him under the covers. Pox has contacted him over what appears to be a video phone, and after discovering Crypto has cloned Natalya, Crypto abruptly hangs up on him. Natalya then emerges from the covers asking who it was, then tells Crypto to wake her when he's ready for "re-entry". Crypto then admits he made a few 'adjustments', indicating he tampered with her DNA so she would no longer resist him.
It is also noted that after he defeated Milenkov, he discovered surviving Blisk Warriors sending out an S.O.S.. Crypto then changed the message to a warning to any other beings listening, and killed the rest of the Blisk on the moon, making them extinct. He also has genitalia this time around. Sometime after these events, Crypto resigns his Presidency and breaks up with Natalya.
Cryptosporidium 139 - This clone was created in the mid-late 70's after 138 died in a saucer crash while drunk. After the crash, Crypto opened a casino called the Space Dust to use as a front to gather DNA. He became native. He also went to war with a local mob family known as the Molinari Brothers. Crypto 139 and the casino are attacked by Nexo warriors, and after defeating them, flees Las Paradiso. After traveling to Sunnywood, he is shot with a dart and brought to Shen Long, where he gets his answers from a furon Kung Fu master. This "Master" trains 139 in psychokinesis. After his training, Crypto still ends up with loose ends, and finally returns home to find some answers. It is revealed to him that his old Master was the true cause of his issues, and after the Master is slammed into the wall, Orthopox ascends the throne and he returns to Earth alone.
Cryptosporidium 137 (BWU) - The clone that appears in "Big Willy Unleashed". He is clearly misnumbered, as Crypto 137 was dead long before the time of the game. He is charged with helping Pox protect their new DNA front, Big Willy's. He has a son, named Blastomycosis, and resigned his presidency. He and Natalya are also Ex-lovers. He is responsible for the deaths of Kolonel Kluckin, Trahn, The Corncob King, Mindy Peters, Patty Wurst, Ratpoo, Mr. Pork, and Toxoplasma Gondii.
Cryptosporidium-??? - Little is known about this clone but he appears in multiplayer games as the second player. In DAH!2 he wears a red suit, and in "Big Willy Unleashed" he just has a red arrow floating above his head. In Path of the Furon, the first player Crypto wears a suit with blue replacing the brown areas, and the second player with red replacing the brown areas.
Orthopox 13.
Orthopox, known as "Pox" for short, is Crypto's commanding officer, who gives him his assignments. Pox is an intelligent furon scientist who likes to experiment on the species' DNA, and is the second most senior fleet commander in the entire Furon Navy. Pox is the mastermind behind the expedition to retrieve the furon DNA from Human brain stems. Pox is a brilliant tactician, a canny businessman, and holds his own in chess. However, years of physical neglect has rendered his lower extremities somewhat useless, requiring the use of a cerebro chair, with which he uses to float about, and to help support his massive cranium. Pox also has Cranial Implants on his head, which resemble metallic horns. These could be a sign of Pox's high status in the Furon Armada. Pox's achievements include: Conqueror of Zarkon-5, Hero of the Battle of Tharsis Mons, Winner of the Xanthrax-47 Mental Cruelty Award 6 years running. Having been destroyed at the beginning of Destroy All Humans! 2, Pox's mind has been confined to a HoloPox unit, a furon hologram projector that he developed himself, which he managed to download his conscious into before the mothership exploded and his last words ("WHAT THE???!!!") were spoken. Though with this unusual handicap Crypto makes many jokes about at Pox's expense about being dead. He remains this way until he obtains a monkey`s body by mistake in Destroy All Humans! 3. Between the times of Destroy All Humans! 2 and Destroy All Humans! 3, Pox opens a new restaurant called Big Willy's. However, it is revealed that Pox has been collecting the dead bodies Crypto leaves lying around and feeding them back to the people as hot dogs in the Big Willy Franchise. By the time of "Path of the Furon", Pox is extremely bitter about being confined to his holographic prison and wants to just collect the human DNA and go home so he can receive a new clone body. He is voiced by Richard Steven Horvitz (Pox himself sounds similar to Zim from Invader Zim, albeit with an English accent) and by Darryl Kurylo in Destroy All Humans! Big Willy Unleashed.
Orthopox 14.
Near the end of "Path of the Furon" Orthopox is finally re-cloned, however the wrong body mold was used, giving Pox a simian appearance. After Meningitis' death, Orthopox 14 ascends the throne as furon emperor while Crypto returns to Earth. Voiced by Richard Steven Horvitz and Darryl Kurylo (in "Destroy All Humans! Big Willy Unleashed").
Major supporting characters.
Path of the Furon.
Note - "Path of the Furon" is the first game in the series to feature 2 additional Furons who play major roles in person, other than Pox and Crypto. It is also the first game to feature The Furon emperor in person.
Other Characters.
Dodecalypse.
Dodecalypse is the furon equivalent of the Devil. Arkvoodle mentions him several times throughout the series, however, he has never made a physical appearance.
E-Coli.
E-Coli was a rich, upper-class female furon working at the palace, whom Pox fell in love with during his summer internship at the palace. It is revealed that she left Pox after her father bought her a new transportation device, leaving him disgusted and heart broken. She is only mentioned briefly in "Big Willy Unleashed".
Space Traffic Control and Admiral Cyclosporiasis.
In one of the Bay City odd jobs in "DAH!2", Pox and Crypto contact two other furons in desperation of rescue and/or back up. They transmit a radio signal created by a makeshift transmitter array, which is picked up by a non-helpful furon working at Space Traffic Control, whom Pox insults after he explains that he has never actually heard of Pox before. The call is then picked up by the furon admiral, Cyclosporasis, who, becoming angered after learning that Pox and Crypto were foolish enough to let the humans get the upper hand in the first place, threatens to send in another commander to take Pox's place, to which Pox becomes extremely upset, and then denies Pox any assistance. Pox is infuriated by this as the admiral discontinues the transmission, after which Pox yells out "Frak!" Stating it was an old Cylon curse word.

Theory of conjoint measurement

The theory of conjoint measurement (also known as conjoint measurement or additive conjoint measurement) is a general, formal theory of continuous quantity. It was independently discovered by the French economist Gérard Debreu (1960) and by the American mathematical psychologist R. Duncan Luce and statistician John Tukey .
The theory concerns the situation where at least two natural attributes, "A" and "X", non-interactively relate to a third attribute, "P". It is not required that "A", "X" or "P" are known to be quantities. Via specific relations between the levels of "P", it can be established that "P", "A" and "X" are continuous quantities. Hence the theory of conjoint measurement can be used to quantify attributes in empirical circumstances where it is not possible to combine the levels of the attributes using a side-by-side operation or concatenation. The quantification of psychological attributes such as attitudes, cognitive abilities and utility is therefore logically plausible. This means that the scientific measurement of psychological attributes is possible. That is, like physical quantities, a magnitude of a psychological quantity may possibly be expressed as the product of a real number and a unit magnitude.
Application of the theory of conjoint measurement in psychology, however, has been limited. It has been argued that this is due to the high level of formal mathematics involved (e.g., ) and that the theory cannot account for the "noisy" data typically discovered in psychological research (e.g., ). It has been argued that the Rasch model is a stochastic variant of the theory of conjoint measurement (e.g., ; ; ; ; ; ), however, this has been disputed (e.g., Karabatsos, 2001; Kyngdon, 2008). Order restricted methods for conducting probabilistic tests of the cancellation axioms of conjoint measurement have been developed in the past decade (e.g., Karabatsos, 2001; Davis-Stober, 2009).
The theory of conjoint measurement is (different but) related to conjoint analysis, which is a statistical-experiments methodology employed in marketing to estimate the parameters of additive utility functions. Different multi-attribute stimuli are presented to respondents, and different methods are used to measure their preferences about the presented stimuli. The coefficients of the utility function are estimated using alternative regression-based tools.
Historical overview.
In the 1930s, the British Association for the Advancement of Science established the Ferguson Committee to investigate the possibility of psychological attributes being measured scientifically. The British physicist and measurement theorist Norman Robert Campbell was an influential member of the committee. In its Final Report (Ferguson, "et al.", 1940), Campbell and the Committee concluded that because psychological attributes were not capable of sustaining concatenation operations, such attributes could not be continuous quantities. Therefore, they could not be measured scientifically. This had important ramifications for psychology, the most significant of these being the creation in 1946 of the "operational theory of measurement" by Harvard psychologist Stanley Smith Stevens. Stevens' non-scientific theory of measurement is widely held as definitive in psychology and the behavioural sciences generally .
Whilst the German mathematician Otto Hölder (1901) anticipated features of the theory of conjoint measurement, it was not until the publication of Luce & Tukey's seminal 1964 paper that the theory received its first complete exposition. Luce & Tukey's presentation was algebraic and is therefore considered more general than Debreu's (1960) topological work, the latter being a special case of the former . In the first article of the inaugural issue of the "Journal of Mathematical Psychology", proved that via the theory of conjoint measurement, attributes not capable of concatenation could be quantified. N.R. Campbell and the Ferguson Committee were thus proven wrong. That a given psychological attribute is a continuous quantity is a logically coherent and empirically testable hypothesis.
Appearing in the next issue of the same journal were important papers by Dana Scott (1964), who proposed a hierarchy of cancellation conditions for the indirect testing of the solvability and Archimedean axioms, and David Krantz (1964) who connected the Luce & Tukey work to that of Hölder (1901).
Work soon focused on extending the theory of conjoint measurement to involve more than just two attributes. and Amos Tversky (1967) developed what became known as polynomial conjoint measurement, with providing a schema with which to construct conjoint measurement structures of three or more attributes. Later, the theory of conjoint measurement (in its two variable, polynomial and "n"-component forms) received a thorough and highly technical treatment with the publication of the first volume of "Foundations of Measurement", which Krantz, Luce, Tversky and philosopher Patrick Suppes cowrote .
Shortly after the publication of Krantz, et al., (1971), work focused upon developing an "error theory" for the theory of conjoint measurement. Studies were conducted into the number of conjoint arrays that supported only single cancellation and both single and double cancellation (; ). Later enumeration studies focused on polynomial conjoint measurement (; ). These studies found that it is highly unlikely that the axioms of the theory of conjoint measurement are satisfied at random, provided that more than three levels of at least one of the component attributes has been identified.
Joel Michell (1988) later identified that the "no test" class of tests of the double cancellation axiom was empty. Any instance of double cancellation is thus either an acceptance or a rejection of the axiom. Michell also wrote at this time a non-technical introduction to the theory of conjoint measurement which also contained a schema for deriving higher order cancellation conditions based upon Scott's (1964) work. Using Michell's schema, Ben Richards (Kyngdon & Richards, 2007) discovered that some instances of the triple cancellation axiom are "incoherent" as they contradict the single cancellation axiom. Moreover, he identified many instances of the triple cancellation which are trivially true if double cancellation is supported.
The axioms of the theory of conjoint measurement are not stochastic; and given the ordinal constraints placed on data by the cancellation axioms, order restricted inference methodology must be used . George Karabatsos and his associates (Karabatsos, 2001; ) developed a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology for psychometric applications. demonstrated how this framework could be extended to polynomial conjoint structures. Karabatsos (2005) generalised this work with his multinomial Dirichlet framework, which enabled the probabilistic testing of many non-stochastic theories of mathematical psychology. More recently, Clintin Davis-Stober (2009) developed a frequentist framework for order restricted inference that can also be used to test the cancellation axioms.
Perhaps the most notable (Kyngdon, 2011) use of the theory of conjoint measurement was in the prospect theory proposed by the Israeli - American psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). Prospect theory was a theory of decision making under risk and uncertainty which accounted for choice behaviour such as the Allais Paradox. David Krantz wrote the formal proof to prospect theory using the theory of conjoint measurement. In 2002, Kahneman received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics for prospect theory (Birnbaum, 2008).
Measurement and quantification.
The classical / standard definition of measurement.
In physics and metrology, the standard definition of measurement is the estimation of the ratio between a magnitude of a continuous quantity and a unit magnitude of the same kind (de Boer, 1994/95; Emerson, 2008). For example, the statement "Peter's hallway is 4m long" expresses a measurement of an hitherto unknown length magnitude (the hallway's length) as the ratio of the unit (the metre in this case) to the length of the hallway. The real number "4" is a real number in the strict mathematical sense of this term.
For some other quantities, it is easier or has been convention to estimate ratios between attribute "differences". Consider temperature, for example. In the familiar everyday instances, temperature is measured using instruments calibrated in either the Fahrenheit or Celsius scales. What are really being measured with such instruments are the magnitudes of temperature differences. For example, Anders Celsius defined the unit of the Celsius scale to be 1/100th of the difference in temperature between the freezing and boiling points of water at sea level. A midday temperature measurement of 20 degrees Celsius is simply the ratio of the Celsius unit to the midday temperature.
Formally expressed, a scientific measurement is:
formula_1
where "Q" is the magnitude of the quantity, "r" is a real number and ["Q"] is a unit magnitude of the same kind.
This classical/standard definition of measurement does not take into account that measurement in one physical realm is affected by other physical realms as demonstrated by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and Einstein's theories of Special and General Relativity. For instance, we know from Boyle's law that measurement of volume is affected by temperature, pressure, etc. A gallon of gasoline measured in winter, will expand in volume by summer and vice versa. The definition of temperature in degrees Celsius itself is based upon the boiling temperature of water AT SEA LEVEL, but do we usually account for this in our measurement of temperature? We also know from Einstein's theories that length is not constant for any object in motion, and all objects in the universe are under varying motion. Similarly for time. Therefore it is not possible for any measurement (physical or psychological) to be the ratio between a magnitude of a continuous quantity and a unit magnitude of the same kind.
Extensive and intensive quantity.
Length is a quantity for which natural concatenation operations exist. That is, we can combine in a side by side fashion lengths of rigid steel rods, for example, such that the additive relations between lengths is readily observed. If we have four 1m lengths of such rods, we can place them end to end to produce a length of 4m. Quantities capable of concatenation are known as "extensive quantities" and include mass, time, electrical resistance and plane angle. These are known as "base" quantities in physics and metrology.
Temperature is a quantity for which there is an absence of concatenation operations. We cannot pour a volume of water of temperature 40 degrees Celsius into another bucket of water at 20 degrees Celsius and expect to have a volume of water with a temperature of 60 degrees Celsius. Temperature is therefore an "intensive" quantity.
Psychological attributes, like temperature, are considered to be intensive as no way of concatenating such attributes has been found. But this is not to say that such attributes are not quantifiable. The theory of conjoint measurement provides a theoretical means of doing this.
Theory.
Consider two natural attributes "A", and "X". It is not known that either "A" or "X" is a continuous quantity, or that both of them are. Let "a", "b", and "c" represent three independent, identifiable levels of "A"; and let "x", "y" and "z" represent three independent, identifiable levels of "X". A third attribute, "P", consists of the nine ordered pairs of levels of "A" and "X". That is, ("a", "x"), ("b", "y")..., ("c", "z") (see Figure 1). The quantification of "A", "X" and "P" depends upon the behaviour of the relation holding upon the levels of "P". These are relations are presented as axioms in the theory of conjoint measurement.
Single cancellation or independence axiom.
The single cancellation axiom is as follows. The relation upon "P" satisfies "single cancellation" if and only if for all "a" and "b" in "A", and "x" in "X", ("a", "x") > ("b", "x") is implied for every "w" in "X" such that ("a", "w") > ("b", "w"). Similarly, for all "x" and "y" in "X" and "a" in "A", ("a", "x") > ("a", "y") is implied for every "d" in "A" such that ("d", "x") > ("d", "y"). What this means is that if any two levels, "a", "b", are ordered, then this order holds irrespective of each and every level of "X". The same holds for any two levels, "x" and "y" of "X" with respect to each and every level of "A".
Single cancellation is so-called because a single common factor of two levels of "P" cancel out to leave the same ordinal relationship holding on the remaining elements. For example, "a" cancels out of the inequality ("a", "x") > ("a", "y") as it is common to both sides, leaving "x" > "y". Krantz, et al., (1971) originally called this axiom "independence", as the ordinal relation between two levels of an attribute is independent of any and all levels of the other attribute. However, given that the term "independence" causes confusion with statistical concepts of independence, single cancellation is the preferable term. Figure One is a graphical representation of one instance of single cancellation.
Satisfaction of the single cancellation axiom is necessary, but not sufficient, for the quantification of attributes "A" and "X". It only demonstrates that the levels of "A", "X" and "P" are ordered. Informally, single cancellation does not sufficiently constrain the order upon the levels of "P" to quantify "A" and "X". For example, consider the ordered pairs ("a", "x"), ("b", "x") and ("b", "y"). If single cancellation holds then ("a", "x") > ("b", "x") and ("b", "x") > ("b", "y"). Hence via transitivity ("a", "x") > ("b", "y"). The relation between these latter two ordered pairs, informally a "left-leaning diagonal", is determined by the satisfaction of the single cancellation axiom, as are all the "left leaning diagonal" relations upon "P".
Double cancellation axiom.
Single cancellation does not determine the order of the "right-leaning diagonal" relations upon "P". Even though by transitivity and single cancellation it was established that ("a", "x") > ("b", "y"), the relationship between ("a", "y") and ("b", "x") remains undetermined. It could be that either ("b", "x") > ("a", "y") or ("a", "y") > ("b", "x") and such ambiguity cannot remain unresolved.
The double cancellation axiom concerns a class of such relations upon "P" in which the common terms of two antecedent inequalities cancel out to produce a third inequality. Consider the instance of double cancellation graphically represented by Figure Two. The antecedent inequalities of this particular instance of double cancellation are:
formula_2
and
formula_3.
Given that:
formula_4
is true if and only if formula_5; and
formula_6
is true if and only if formula_7, it follows that:
formula_8.
Cancelling the common terms results in:
formula_9.
Hence double cancellation can only obtain when "A" and "X" are quantities.
Double cancellation is satisfied if and only if the consequent inequality does not contradict the antecedent inequalities. For example, if the consequent inequality above was:
formula_10, or alternatively,
formula_11,
then double cancellation would be violated and it could not be concluded that "A" and "X" are quantities.
Double cancellation concerns the behaviour of the "right leaning diagonal" relations on "P" as these are not logically entailed by single cancellation. discovered that when the levels of "A" and "X" approach infinity, then the number of right leaning diagonal relations is half of the number of total relations upon "P". Hence if "A" and "X" are quantities, half of the number of relations upon "P" are due to ordinal relations upon "A" and "X" and half are due to additive relations upon "A" and "X" .
The number of instances of double cancellation is contingent upon the number of levels identified for both "A" and "X". If there are "n" levels of "A" and "m" of "X", then the number of instances of double cancellation is "n"! × "m"!. Therefore, if "n" = "m" = 3, then 3! × 3! = 6 × 6 = 36 instances in total of double cancellation. However, all but 6 of these instances are trivially true if single cancellation is true, and if anyone of these 6 instances is true, then all of them are true. One such instance is that shown in Figure Two. calls this a "Luce — Tukey" instance of double cancellation.
If single cancellation has been tested upon a set of data first and is established, then only the Luce — Tukey instances of double cancellation need to be tested. For "n" levels of "A" and "m" of "X", the number of Luce — Tukey double cancellation instances is formula_12formula_13. For example, if "n" = "m" = 4, then there are 16 such instances. If "n" = "m" = 5 then there are 100. The greater the number of levels in both "A" and "X", the less probable it is that the cancellation axioms are satisfied at random (; ) and the more stringent test of quantity the application of conjoint measurement becomes.
Solvability and Archimedean axioms.
The single and double cancellation axioms by themselves are not sufficient to establish continuous quantity. Other conditions must also be introduced to ensure continuity. These are the "solvability" and "Archimedean" conditions.
"Solvability" means that for any three elements of "a", "b", "x" and "y", the fourth exists such that the equation "a" "x" = "b" "y" is solved, hence the name of the condition. Solvability essentially is the requirement that each level "P" has an element in "A" and an element in "X". Solvability reveals something about the levels of "A" and "X" — they are either dense like the real numbers or equally spaced like the integers .
The "Archimedean condition" is as follows. Let "I" be a set of consecutive integers, either finite or infinite, positive or negative. The levels of "A" form a "standard sequence" if and only if there exists "x" and "y" in "X" where "x" ≠ "y" and for all integers "i" and "i" + 1 in "I":
formula_14.
What this basically means is that if "x" is greater than "y", for example, there are levels of "A" which can be found which makes two relevant ordered pairs, the levels of "P", equal.
The Archimedean condition argues that there is no infinitely greatest level of "P" and so hence there is no greatest level of either "A" or "X". This condition is a definition of continuity given by the ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes whom wrote that "Further, of unequal lines, unequal surfaces, and unequal solids, the greater exceeds the less by such a magnitude as, when added to itself, can be made to exceed any assigned magnitude among those which are comparable with one another " ("On the Sphere and Cylinder", Book I, Assumption 5). Archimedes recognised that for any two magnitudes of a continuous quantity, one being lesser than the other, the lesser could be multiplied by a whole number such that it equalled the greater magnitude. Euclid stated the Archimedean condition as an axiom in Book V of the Elements, in which Euclid presented his theory of continuous quantity and measurement.
As they involve infinitistic concepts, the solvability and Archimedean axioms are not amenable to direct testing in any finite empirical situation. But this does not entail that these axioms cannot be empirically tested at all. Scott's (1964) finite set of cancellation conditions can be used to indirectly test these axioms; the extent of such testing being empirically determined. For example, if both "A" and "X" possess three levels, the highest order cancellation axiom within Scott's (1964) hierarchy that indirectly tests solvability and Archimedeaness is double cancellation. With four levels it is triple cancellation (Figure 3). If such tests are satisfied, the construction of standard sequences in differences upon "A" and "X" are possible. Hence these attributes may be dense as per the real numbers or equally spaced as per the integers . In other words, "A" and "X" are continuous quantities.
Relation to the scientific definition of measurement.
Satisfaction of the conditions of conjoint measurement means that measurements of the levels of "A" and "X" can be expressed as either ratios between magnitudes or ratios between magnitude differences. It is most commonly interpreted as the latter, given that most behavioural scientists consider that their tests and surveys "measure" attributes on so-called "interval scales" . That is, they believe tests do not identify absolute zero levels of psychological attributes.
Formally, if "P", "A" and "X" form an "additive conjoint structure", then there exist functions from "A" and "X" into the real numbers such that for "a" and "b" in "A" and "x" and "y" in "X":
formula_15.
If formula_16 and formula_17 are two other real valued functions satisfying the above expression, there exist formula_18 and formula_19 real valued constants satisfying:
formula_20 and formula_21.
That is, formula_22 and formula_23 are measurements of "A" and "X" unique up to affine transformation (i.e. each is an interval scale in Stevens’ (1946) parlance). The mathematical proof of this result is given in .
This means that the levels of "A" and "X" are magnitude differences measured relative to some kind of unit difference. Each level of "P" is a difference between the levels of "A" and "X". However, it is not clear from the literature as to how a unit could be defined within an additive conjoint context. proposed a scaling method for conjoint structures but he also did not discuss the unit.
The theory of conjoint measurement, however, is not restricted to the quantification of differences. If each level of "P" is a product of a level of "A" and a level of "X", then "P" is another different quantity whose measurement is expressed as a magnitude of "A" per unit magnitude of "X". For example, "A" consists of masses and "X" consists of volumes, then "P" consists of densities measured as mass per unit of volume. In such cases, it would appear that one level of "A" and one level of "X" must be identified as a tentative unit prior to the application of conjoint measurement.
If each level of "P" is the sum of a level of "A" and a level of "X", then "P" is the same quantity as "A" and"X". For example, "A" and "X" are lengths so hence must be "P". All three must therefore be expressed in the same unit. In such cases, it would appear that a level of either "A" or "X" must be tentatively identified as the unit. Hence it would seem that application of conjoint measurement requires some prior descriptive theory of the relevant natural system.
Applications of Conjoint Measurement.
Empirical applications of the theory of conjoint measurement have been sparse (; ).
, Kyngdon (2006), Michell (1994) and tested the cancellation axioms of upon the interstimulus midpoint orders obtained by the use of Coombs' (1964) theory of unidimensional unfolding. Coombs' theory in all three studies was applied to a set of six statements. These authors found that the axioms were satisfied, however, these were applications biased towards a positive result. With six stimuli, the probability of an interstimulus midpoint order satisfying the double cancellation axioms at random is .5874 (Michell, 1994). This is not an unlikely event. Kyngdon & Richards (2007) employed eight statements and found the interstimulus midpoint orders rejected the double cancellation condition.
Kyngdon (2011) used Karabatsos' (2001) order restricted inference framework to test a conjoint matrix of reading item response proportions ("P") where the examinee reading ability comprised the rows of the conjoint array ("A") and the difficulty of the reading items formed the columns of the array ("X"). The levels of reading ability were identified via raw total test score and the levels of reading item difficulty were identified by the Lexile Framework for Reading . Kyngdon found that satisfaction of the cancellation axioms was obtained only through permutation of the matrix in a manner inconsistent with the putative Lexile measures of item difficulty. Kyngdon also tested simulated ability test response data using polynomial conjoint measurement. The data were generated using Humphry's extended frame of reference Rasch model . He found support of distributive, single and double cancellation consistent with a distributive polynomial conjoint structure in three variables .

Bavarian D IX

The D IX steam locomotive was manufactured by the firm of Maffei between 1888 and 1899 for the Royal Bavarian State Railways ("Königlich Bayerische Staatsbahn"). They were used on the route from Reichenhall via Freilassing to Salzburg. After one engine had been successfully employed on the route to Berchtesgaden, the vehicles were also deployed on the suburban lines of Augsburg, Munich and Nuremberg. 
There were scarcely any differences between the various build series. Not until 1896 were minor changes made to the heating areas, the weights and the coal and water capacities. The rigid mounting of the driving and carrying wheels and the location of the cylinder just in front of the carrying wheel did not prove a success. The D IX locomotives could haul 170 t on the flat at a speed of 65 km/h, on routes with a 2% incline they could manage 95 tons at 20 km/h.
Apart from one engine, which had already been retired by Bavaria, the Reichsbahn took on all the engines. Some were taken out of service even before 1925, the rest had followed by 1932.
Unfortunately no examples of the Bavarian D IX have been preserved.

William Feimster Tucker (May 9, 1827 – September 14, 1881) was a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War.
Early life.
Tucker was born in Iredell County, North Carolina. He attended Emory and Henry College in Abingdon, Virginia, and graduated in 1848. That same year he moved to Houston, Mississippi. In 1855, he was elected probate judge of Chickasaw County. Tucker then studied law and was admitted to the bar and began practicing.
Civil War.
Tucker entered the Confederate Army as a captain of Company K, 11th Mississippi Infantry Regiment. He was part of Barnard Bee's brigade at the First Battle of Manassas. Soon afterwards Tucker's company was sent to the West and merged with the 41st Mississippi Infantry Regiment. Tucker was commissioned colonel of the regiment in May 1862. He led the regiment at the Battles of Perryville, Murfreesboro, Chickamauga, and Chattanooga before being promoted to brigadier general to rank from March 1, 1864. Tucker's field duty ended that summer after suffering a severe wound at the Battle of Resaca during the Atlanta Campaign.

Rainbows (Alice Nine song)

"Rainbows" (typeset in promotional material as RAINBOWS) is the 13th maxi single by Alice Nine. It was released on August 6, 2008 in three different versions. Each version contains the title track and a B-side, which may include a booklet, a music video, or another bonus track, respectively within the three versions.
The single marks a significant change in the bands overall dress style which no longer resembles their original Visual Kei look.
In Japan, the single went straight to #3 on the Oricon daily charts, selling over 3,500 copies on its first day and marking their highest position on a mainstream Japanese music chart to date. On the Oricon weekly charts, it ranked at #6, having sold a total of 15,921 copies during its first week.
Development history.
"RAINBOWS".
The title track was conceptualized by bassist Saga during a period in which the band members were creating songs without an overall motif. An early version of "Rainbows" was chosen out of a total of 17 songs from this period.
Saga mentions in an interview with Shoxx Magazine that the song's early sound had strong electronic influences at first, which faded as the band introduced and increased live instrumentation during production. Another characteristic that contributed to a more mechanical sound was a drum loop, but this was eventually replaced with live drum work as well.
For the lyrics, vocalist Shou envisioned an image of the band playing in a laser beam-filled disco after listening to the demo tape and created the theme of "shouting strongly from the darkness to the light" from there. The symbol for this theme was eventually realized as a rainbow.
"Strawberry Fuzz", "Kochouran".
Guitarist Hiroto handled songwriting duties for the following songs on the single, with different approaches to each. "Strawberry Fuzz" came to life as a song that he wanted to perform live, while "Kochouran" pushed him to search for female vocals, bringing an R&B feel to the song.
The titles for each song came about as themes pervading their lyrics. Shou explains the title of "Strawberry Fuzz" as a symbol for the embarrassment that a person experiences when they begin to pursue a dream. He chose the color pink to represent this, which in turn led to the word "strawberry." The "fuzz" of the title refers to hiding this intent from others. For "Kochouran," he elaborates that the theme is "people’s weaknesses and inferiority complexes about beauty," which came to be represented by flowers and butterflies.
Track listing.
Version 1 (CD and booklet)
Version 2 (CD and DVD) (Limited Edition)
Version 3 (CD only)
Music video.
The music video for Rainbows shows the band on the walkway-like stage lit with fluorescent lights on the ceiling and floor. The band appears in mostly bright, casual street clothing, with vocalist Shou even appearing in white Shutter Shades. The video often "glitches" at various points: pausing when the scene changes, stuttering, rewinding for a few seconds, or speeding up.
A making-of documentary aired with a live interview on Yahoo! Japan also shows a common video trick in which the band performs to a slowed-down version of the song, and the footage is later sped up. This results in the band members moving faster while maintaining lip-synching at normal speed.

333rd Field Artillery Battalion (United States)

Formation and history prior to the Ardennes Offensive.
Organized as the 333rd Field Artillery (FA) Regiment on 5 August 1917 and subordinated to the 161st Field Artillery Brigade, 86th Infantry Division. The regiment subsequently served in France during World War I, but did not see action. The regiment was demobilized in January 1919 at Camp Grant, Illinois.
The regiment was part of the Organized Reserves in Chicago from 1930 through 1937, at which time it was inactivated until World War II.
On 5 August 1942, the 333rd FA Regiment was activated at Camp Gruber, Oklahoma. As part of an army-wide artillery reorganization, the 1st Battalion was retitled the 333rd FA Battalion and the 2nd Battalion became the 969th FA Battalion. Regimental Headquarters became Headquarters and Headquarters Battery of the 333rd FA Group on 12 February 1943. The group subsequently served in Normandy, Brittany, participated in the siege of Brest and battled across Northern France before arriving in the Ardennes sector as part of the corps artillery of the U.S. VIII Corps.
Ardennes Offensive & the Wereth 11 Massacre.
The 333rd FA Group (333rd {155mm}, 969th {155mm} and 771st {4.5-inch} FA Battalions) initially supported the 2nd Infantry Division (United States) and its replacement, the 106th Infantry Division. At the onset of the Battle of the Bulge they were eleven miles behind the front lines. With the rapid advance of the Germans, the 333rd FA Battalion was ordered to withdraw further west, but C and Service Batteries were ordered to stay behind to give covering fire to the 106th Division. On 17 December they were overrun with most killed or captured. 
Eleven of its soldiers became separated from the unit after it was overrun early on the second day of the battle. In an effort to reach American lines they made their way to the hamlet of Wereth, Belgium (near Amel), where a farmer, Mathias Langer, sheltered them. However, later that day, a Nazi sympathizer revealed their presence to members of the 1st SS Division. They surrendered, but were taken to a field, where they were tortured, maimed, and shot on 17 December 1944. Their remains were found by Allied soldiers two months later, after the Allies re-took the area. The soldiers had their fingers cut off, legs broken, and at least one was shot while trying to bandage a comrade's wounds.
A memorial stands (since 1994) on the site of their murders, dedicated to the 11 ("Wereth 11") and all African-American soldiers who fought in the European theatre. It is believed to be the only memorial to African-American soldiers of World War II in Europe. 
The remnants of the 333rd FAB were ordered to Bastogne and incorporated into its sister unit the 969th Field Artillery Battalion. Both units provided fire support for the 101st Airborne Division in the Siege of Bastogne, subsequently being awarded the Presidential Unit Citation.
The 333rd Field Artillery Battalion suffered more casualties during the Battle of the Bulge than any other artillery unit in the VIII Corps. Six officers (including the commanding officer) and 222 enlisted men became either casualties or prisoners of war.
The 333rd FA Group subsequently served in the Central Europe campaign until the end of the war, while the 333rd FA Battalion subsequently served in the Rhineland Campaign.
Post World War II.
The 333rd FA Battalion was inactivated 10 June 1945 in Germany, while the 333rd FA Group was inactivated at Camp Patrick Henry, Virginia on 30 December 1945. Both the 333rd and 969th FA Battalions were later reactivated, although further reorganizations ensued, with the 333rd FA Battalion renumbered as the 446th FA Battalion. On 1 July 1959 the 333rd FA Group was reactivated as the 333rd Artillery Regiment with the 446th and 969th FA Battalions subordinated to it. On 1 September 1971, the regiment was retitled the 333rd Field Artillery Regiment. Four target acquisition batteries of the 333rd Field Artillery served in Operation Desert Storm in 1991. Today, there is only one target acquisition battery in the Army which still bear the number of the 333rd Field Artillery.
Names of the "Wereth 11".
The victims were:
Curtis Adams was a medic. Thomas J. Forte was a mess sergeant.

Matsumae Takahiro

Youth.
Takahiro, whose childhood name was Tamekichi, was born at Fukuyama Castle in Ezo. He was the 6th son of Matsumae Akihiro, the 9th lord of Matsumae. At age 4, he was sent to the family estate in Edo. In an act most unusual for a daimyo's son, his education included the study of the English language.
He succeeded to lordship of Matsumae in 1849.
Rise to Power as Rōjū.
Takahiro was appointed as rōjū in November 1864; this was a post that was unheard of for a tozama daimyo. The following year, he and his fellow rōjū Abe Masato were responsible for the opening of the Hyōgo port to foreign trade. However, as they did so against the wishes of the imperial court, the court issued orders calling for their dismissal from office. Both men lost their offices, court rank, and titles, and were forced to yield lordship of their domains. Takahiro retired in favor of his son Norihiro.
Death.
Takahiro returned to Matsumae in the spring of 1866. Soon after, he contracted a fever and died at age 36. A few years after Takahiro's death, his grandson Nagahiro petitioned the imperial court for a pardon, which was granted, along with a restoration of his court rank and titles.
Media.
Takahiro has appeared infrequently in fictional depictions of the bakumatsu era. Most recently he appeared as a minor character in the manga "Kaze Hikaru".

Philippicae

The Philippicae or Philippics are a series of 14 speeches Cicero gave condemning Mark Antony in 44 BC and 43 BC. The corpus of speeches were named and modeled after Demosthenes' Philippic, which he had delivered against Philip of Macedon, and were styled in a similar manner.
The political climate.
Cicero was taken by surprise when Gaius Julius Caesar, the effective dictator of the Roman Republic, was assassinated on the fifteenth day of March, 44 BC, (known as the ides of March) by a group of Roman senators who called themselves Liberatores. Cicero was not included in the conspiracy, even though the conspirators were sure of his sympathy. When Marcus Junius Brutus, one of the killers, lifted his bloodstained dagger after the assassination, he called out Cicero's name, beseeching him to "restore the Republic!" A letter Cicero wrote in February 43 BC to Trebonius, one of the conspirators, began, "How I wish that you had invited me to that most glorious banquet on the Ides of March!" 
Cicero became a popular leader during the period of instability after the assassination. He had no respect for Mark Antony, who was scheming to take revenge upon Caesar's murderers. In fact, Cicero privately expressed his regret that the murderers of Caesar had not included Antony in their plot, and he bent his efforts to the discrediting of the latter.
In exchange for amnesty for the assassins, he arranged for the Senate to agree that it would not proclaim Caesar to be a tyrant, an action that allowed Caesar's supporters, known as the Caesarian faction, to remain a lawful force. Cicero and Antony then became the two leading politicians in Rome, Cicero as spokesman for the Senate and Antony as consul, leader of the Caesarian faction and unofficial executor of Caesar's will. The two men had never been on friendly terms, and their relationship worsened after Cicero made it clear that he felt Antony was taking unfair liberties in interpreting Caesar's wishes and intentions. 
When Octavian, Caesar's adopted son and heir, arrived in Italy in April, Cicero formed a plan to play him against Antony. In September Cicero began attacking Antony in a series of speeches he called the Philippics, in honour of his inspiration, Demosthenes. In praise of Octavian, he labelled him a "god-sent child" and said that the young man desired only honour and would not make the same mistake as did Caesar. Meanwhile, his attacks on Antony, whom he called a "sheep", rallied the Senate in firm opposition to Antony. During this time, Cicero's popularity as a public figure was unrivalled and, according to the historian Appian, he "had the power any popular leader could possibly have". 
Cicero levied heavy fines on the supporters of Antony for petty offenses and recruited volunteers to make weapons for the supporters of the Republic. According to Appian, this policy was perceived by Antony's supporters to be so insulting that they prepared to march on Rome to arrest Cicero, but the latter fled the city and the plan was abandoned.
Summary.
The first two speeches mark the outbreak of the enmity between Mark Antony and Cicero. Possibly, Cicero wanted to revive his success of the attacks on the conspiracy of Catiline; at any rate, he compares Mark Antony with his own worst political opponents Catiline and Clodius in a clever rhetorical manner.
In the 3rd and 4th speeches, of 20 December 44, he tried to establish a military alliance with Octavian; the primary objective was the annihilation of Mark Antony and the restoration of the "res publica libera" – the free republic; to reach this goal, he favoured military means unambiguously.
As the Senate decided to send a peace delegation, in the 5, 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th speeches, he argued against the idea of an embassy and tried to mobilise the Senate and the Roman People to war.
In the 10th and 11th, he supports a military strengthening of the republicans Brutus and Cassius, but he was successful only in the case of the first one.
In the 12th, 13th and 14th, he wanted to wipe out any doubt against his own war policy. After the victory over Mark Antony, in the last speech he still warns against a too prompt eagerness for peace.
Consequence.
Cicero’s plan to drive out Antony failed, however. After the successive battles of Forum Gallorum and Mutina, Antony and Octavian reconciled and allied with Lepidus to form the Second Triumvirate. Immediately after legislating their alliance into official existence for a five-year term with consular "imperium", the Triumvirate began proscribing their enemies and potential rivals. Cicero and his younger brother Quintus Tullius Cicero, formerly one of Caesar's legati, and all of their contacts and supporters were numbered among the enemies of the state though, reportedly, Octavian argued for two days against Cicero being added to the list.
Among the proscribed, Cicero was one of the most viciously and doggedly hunted. Other victims included the tribune Salvius, who, after siding with Antony, moved his support directly and fully to Cicero. Cicero was viewed with sympathy by a large segment of the public and many people refused to report that they had seen him. He was eventually caught leaving his villa in Formiae in a litter going to the seaside from where he hoped to embark on a ship to Macedonia. He submitted to a soldier with less than professional skills, baring his neck to him, and suffering death and a grotesque beheading. Antony requested that the hands that wrote the Philippics also be removed. His head and hands were publicly displayed in the Roman Forum to discourage any who would oppose the new Triumvirate of Octavian, Mark Antony and Lepidus. 
According to Tacitus, this work, together with the Pro Milone, In Catilinam, and In Verrem, were the source of Cicero's fame, and much of his political career sprang from the effect of these works.

John E. Franz

John E. Franz is an organic chemist who discovered the herbicide glyphosate while working at Monsanto Company in 1970. The chemical became the active ingredient in Roundup, a broad-spectrum, post-emergence herbicide. This discovery had an incredible effect on the agricultural community, allowing farmers (as well as average homeowners) to easily and effectively control the growth of weeds. Franz has earned much acclaim and many rewards for this breakthrough. He also has over 840 patents to his name worldwide.
Early Life and education.
John Edward Franz was born on December 21, 1929 in Springfield, Illinois. By the age of ten, he knew he wanted to be a scientist. Franz received a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry from the University of Illinois in 1951 and received his Ph.D. in organic chemistry from the University of Minnesota in 1955. He has a wife, Elinor (whom he married in 1951), and four children (Judith, Mary, John, and Gary).
Career.
Franz has spent his entire career at Monsanto in St. Louis, Missouri. After finishing his Ph.D., Franz was hired by Monsanto as a Resident Chemist in 1955. His brilliance and creativity were apparent even before he discovered glyphosate as he was appointed Group Leader in 1959. He focused on process research, new polymer synthesis, and the development of plasticizers and polymer flame retardants. Franz received two patents while working in the organic division, one for nitrates in 1960, and one for a fire retardant in 1967. He transferred to the Agricultural Division of Monsanto in 1967, motivated by the department’s “emphasis on publishing, academic contacts, and the freedom to pursue ideas” (Monsanto biography). Because his background was in organic chemistry, Franz familiarized himself with the new field by spending a year studying and learning about plant physiology and biochemistry before beginning research.
Franz discovered the herbicide glyphosate, and received five dollars for his first patent from Monsanto. From 1960 to 1988, he received over 840 patents worldwide including approximately fifty in the United States. Over the course of his career, Franz published over forty papers and wrote the book ""Glyphosate: A Unique Global Herbicide"" with Michael K. Mao and James A. Sikorski. He was promoted to Senior Scientific Fellow in 1975, then Distinguished Fellow in 1980, and later in his career went back to the organic division to concentrate on environmentally friendly products until he retired in 1991.
Discovery of Glyphosate.
Researchers at Monsanto had been searching for a herbicide that was effective against annual and perennial weeds for nine years but found little success. They knew of two phosphonic acid compounds that were ineffective against weeds, and the researchers were not able to advance the compounds. Franz took over the research in 1969 and incorrectly hypothesized that the phosphonic acids acted as proherbicides that were metabolized to active compounds rather than herbicides. Franz and his research team screened possible metabolites and synthesized compounds and eventually discovered glyphosate in 1970.
Although all of the patents regarding glyphosate list Franz as the sole inventor and the Monsanto Company as the assignee, Franz acknowledged that the discovery was a group effort. In 2007, when he was inducted into the National Inventor's Hall of Fame, Franz said, “It's a recognition of the entire team of scientists who worked on and supported the development of Roundup herbicides". Glyphosate works by absortion through leaves, and then moving rapidly to a plant’s roots, rhizomes, and meristems. This invaluable breakthrough immediately spurred Monsanto to design and produce plants genetically immune to glyphosates in order to make it easier for farmers to thoroughly spray down their fields for weeds without killing their own crops.
Once glyphosate was invented, it took four years to reach the market. It was first introduced as "Roundup", and is still best known by that brand. See glyphosate article for further discussion of brands, uses, and controversy.
Other Research.
Dr. Franz undertook research in many areas during his time at Monsanto. Some of his other chemistry research includes antiauxin chemistry (isothiazoles, isoxasoles, pyrazoles), plant chemistry, cell membrane chemistry (glyceride and phospholipid syntheses, liposomes), plant hormone chemistry (abscissic acid analogs, ethylene generators), and nitride sulfide chemistry. He also performed research pertaining to reaction mechanisms, coenzyme A antimetabolites, biorational design of herbicides, and periselective addition reactions of one- and threedipoles, as well as fundamental organic research.
Honors, Awards, and Recognitions.
Franz has received many awards for his important discovery. In 1977, he was awarded the IR-100 award by Industrial Magazine. In 1981, he received the first J.F. Queeny Award from Monsanto to honor an invention that was also a commercial success. He was the recipient of the 1987 National Medal of Technology, one of the few agricultural technologies to ever receive the honor. Franz received the American Chemical Society’s Carothers Award in 1989 for “outstanding contributions and advances in industrial applications of chemistry”. In 1990, he was awarded the Perkins Medal by the American Section of the Society of Chemical Industry, based on his contributions to the research and development of applied chemistry. Franz also won the Outstanding Achievement Award in 1988, the 1988 Missouri Award, and was named the St. Louis Metropolitan Bar Association Inventor of the Year in 1986. Roundup was named one of the “Top 10 Products That Changed the Face of Agriculture” by the magazine Farm Chemicals in 1994. Franz was inducted into the United States' Inventor's Hall of Fame on May 5, 2007.
Monsanto has also created two awards in his honor. On December 8, 1995, the agricultural company introduced the Franz Sustainability Award, which consists of an annual $100,000 prize given to the individual or team that submits the best environmental project for improvement in the areas of conservation, technology, and/or education. Soon after Franz’s induction into the Inventors’ Hall of Fame, Monsanto announced a new annual scholarship called the Franz Innovation Award Scholarship. This scholarship is awarded each year to a graduate student taking organic chemistry at the University of Minnesota.
Patents.
Franz has over 840 patents to his name concerning glyphosate and lesser known discoveries. Because of the nature of glyphosate, it requires many patents concerning identification, synthesis, and other processes required to produce the chemical.

Great Road Style

The counties that make up southwestern Virginia and northeastern Tennessee are linked historically, culturally, and geographically. Connected by a shared decorative arts tradition the, “Great Road Style,” so called because of the region’s historical importance as a stage route connecting the eastern seaboard with the western frontier, the material culture of this region is evidenced in distinctive forms of furniture, ceramics, textiles, and metalwork. Yet until now, a systematic documentation of its decorative artifacts has never been conducted.
The first substantive effort to conduct primary research in a largely undocumented territory, Great Road Style: The Decorative Arts Legacy of Southwest Virginia and Northeast Tennessee, by Betsy White involved thousands of hours’ worth of fieldwork conducted across Tennessee and Virginia in an attempt to offer the most detailed accounting possible of handmade objects produced along the Great Road before 1940.
The eventual product of that exhaustive research was an archive of photographs, slides, and data sheets on more than two thousand objects representing diverse sectors of the survey area. In organizing and providing a narrative for this treasure trove of material, White and her research team have defined and delineated for the first time what constitutes Great Road Style.
Cultural Heritage Project.
The ongoing Cultural Heritage Project at the William King Regional Arts Center seeks to document the cultural and artistic legacy of Southwest Virginia and Northeast Tennessee from 1780 to 1940, and to foster a full and accurate appreciation of the region's role in American decorative and folk arts. To date, field researchers have identified more than 2,000 objects made by hand in the region, and eight exhibitions have been mounted from that research. Reproductions of selected heritage items can be purchased online at the William King Regional Arts Center Looking Glass Museum Store. Documentation and research is ongoing.

Least number bits

Least Number of Bits (LNB) is a database storage technology, which was first published in February 2001, as a type of database management system internals abstract. It consists of a method and system for determining the absolute least number of bits required to represent and process information within any database input and output process. 
The method includes an automated process for determining the most compressed form to represent each data item, including a file organization and access method that further facilitates transmission of only the few pertinent bits of data necessary to support any input output process.
It pertains to databases, and more particularly, to the representation and storage of detailed data used in control systems and information systems software, including transaction and decision support processing involving highly compact data technology and very large databases.
Examples of LNB methods exist among various products known for fast indexing, fast searching, or any representation of data requiring hyper-compression for optimization. Although the complete set of methods is still proprietary, the technological foundation for these proprietary methods is openly available to mathematicians and technologists.
History.
The notion of least number of bits technology was first proposed for artificial intelligence applications in the 1990s as a means for encoding vast amounts of knowledge into the least amount of storage possible. The concepts were prototyped in the late 90s to demonstrate significant value in various types of computer applications, particularly those faced with having to store and process extremely large volumes of data for analysis. The deployment of least number of bit methods facilitated efficient and effective use of available network bandwidths for global applications, and rendered conventional data warehousing technologies obsolete within the applications wherein LNB technology was introduced.
Architecture.
The basic architecture of LNB technology places the compressed value of each data occurrence of a data field into a contiguous one dimensional array that disregards the word and byte boundaries of conventional storage technology. A one-dimensional array is a string of one or more compressed occurrences of a specific data field, or even a bit position of a specific data field in its compressed form. In contrast to techniques used in conventional file organizations, gaps are not permitted within a one-dimensional array. For example, a two character code such as state codes would require a maximum of six bits to represent each state. As such, the second six bit occurrence begins in the seventh and eighth bits of the same byte that houses the first occurrence. Due to the flexibility and portability of this architecture, the methods are easily transferable to application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC), programmable chips (FPGA) or RAID hardware technology. 
The data dictionary itself establishes and maintains the key for all encryption and decryption of each data field value that exists within each one dimensional array, with full precision for the value of each data field.
The architecture fully extends to support relational theory, including the data virtualization of tables, foreign keys, indices, and all types of joins, and in addition to non-key values, it provides for the compression of all key values as well as support for mathematical operations that can be certified against the data in its compressed form.
This technology was first unveiled within the private sector at DAMA in New York City on May 12, 2000 at the Data Warehouse conference.

969th Artillery Battalion (United States)

The 969th Artillery Battalion was an African American United States Army unit that saw combat during World War II. Along with survivors of the 333rd Artillery Battalion, it gave fire support to the 101st Airborne Division during the siege of Bastogne. The 969th did not suffer the same harrowing casualties as the 333rd but was in the thick of it nonetheless. As a result of the 333rd's high casualty rate, those soldiers fought the rest of the war with the 969th even though on paper the members were still designated as the 333rd.
The 969th was equipped primarily with the M1 155 mm howitzer, one of the heaviest artillery pieces in common usage by U.S. forces during World War Two. The gun crews of the 969th were known for singing in cadence as they loaded and fired their guns, and have been praised by many veterans who fought in and around Bastogne, including Donald R. Burgett (cited below), for their deadly accuracy and precision.

Chris &amp; Don

Chris & Don is a 2008 documentary film that chronicles the lifelong relationship between author Christopher Isherwood and his much younger lover, artist Don Bachardy. "Chris & Don" combines present-day interviews, archival footage shot by the couple from the 1950s, excerpts from Isherwood's diaries, and playful animations to recount their romance. It was directed by Guido Santi and Tina Mascara, and was the centerpiece film at NewFest, the New York LGBTQ Film Festival, in 2008.
Synopsis.
"Chris & Don" tells the story of a romance that began on the beaches of Santa Monica in the 1950s, when Christopher Isherwood at age 48 met Don Bachardy who then was eighteen years old. Isherwood, an established author with works such as "The Berlin Stories", which helped inspire much of "Cabaret", helped Bachardy discover and develop his affinity for drawing and painting as he became a renowned portrait painter during the second half of the 20th century to the present. The documentary includes insight from friends, including Liza Minnelli and John Boorman, who tell of the countless struggles the two faced as one of the first openly gay couples in Hollywood. Despite the age difference, the couple endured until Isherwood succumbed to prostate cancer in 1986.
Critical reception.
The film received positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator MetaCritic reported a score of 83 out of 100, based on 12 reviews from major newspapers and magazines. Many critics also drew parallels between the California Supreme Court ruling affirming same-sex marriage and the release of the film.

Moncreiffe Hill

Moncreiffe Hill is a long, wooded ridge that lies south of Perth, Scotland. It can be easily seen on the right during the final stages of the drive north towards Perth on the M90 motorway. Unlike most British hills, the routes to the summit are almost entirely under tree cover, although the summit area, which is known as Moredun Top, is clear and offers impressive views over Perth and the Firth of Tay.
The shortest route to the summit is from the north, starting at NO132209, but car parking at the location, while not impossible, is evidently not encouraged. A more commonly used route to the summit, albeit a longer route, starts from the south east, starting at NO153192, which is signposted from the nearest public road and where there is sufficient parking space.
A wide variety of trees and other vegetation grow on the hill, which is managed by Scottish Woodlands. There are information boards and several marked trails.
Anyone seeking peace and solitude on this hill can expect to be accompanied by the continuous drone of traffic from the M90 motorway.

Rose in Bloom

Written by Louisa May Alcott, "Rose in Bloom" depicts the story of a nineteenth-century girl, Rose Campbell, finding her way in society. Sequel to "Eight Cousins".
Plot.
The story begins when Rose returns home from a long trip to Europe. Everyone has changed. As a joke, Rose lines up her seven cousins to take a long look at them, just as they did with her when they first met. The youngest accidentally mentions that the aunts want Rose to marry one of her cousins to keep her fortune in the family. Rose is very indignant, for she has decided ideas about what her future holds. From the beginning, she declares that she can manage her property well on her own and that she will focus on philanthropic work. Charlie has already decided she is marked out for him, with the approval of his mother.
Phebe also comes home no longer the servant that Rose "adopted" but as a young lady with a cultured singing ability. Rose challenges anyone who would look down on "her Phebe", and she is readily accepted as part of the Campbell clan until Archie falls in love with her: the family feel that Archie would be marrying beneath himself. Phebe's pride and debt to the family make her wish to prove herself before she will accept Archie; so she leaves the Campbells' home and sets off to make a name for herself as a singer, to try to earn the respect of her adopted family.
After some time at home, Rose has her "coming out" into society, much to her Uncle Alec's chagrin. She promises to try high society for only three months. During that time, her cousin Charlie falls in love with her and tries in various ways to woo her. Rose begins to give in to his charm, but he derails the budding romance by coming to her house, late one night, very drunk. This ruins all her respect for him and she sees how unprincipled he really is. After the three months are up, Rose begins to focus on her philanthropic projects and convinces Charlie to try to refrain from alcohol and other frivolous things, in order to win her love and respect.
She tries to help Charlie overcome his bad habits with the help of her uncle, but fails. Charlie does all he can to win her heart, but in the end he succumbs, hindered by his own weak will and his constant need for acceptance by his friends. Being spoilt by his mother meant he never learned to say "no", even to himself, and his lack of discipline proves fatal: Charlie's life ends tragically in an alcohol-induced accident on the eve of his voyage to see his father and restore his good character. Although Rose never was in love with Charlie, she did have hope that he would return a better man and that they might see what relationship could develop.
Several months after Charlie's death, Rose finds out that another cousin, Mac, is now in love with her. At first, never thought of him as anything but "the worm", she refuses his love; but she does declare the deepest respect for him. This gives Mac hope, and he goes to medical school, willing to work and wait for her. She finds his devotion touching, and she begins to see him clearly for the first time, realizing that Mac is the "hero" she has been looking for. He is exactly suited to her tastes and has become a man in the noblest sense of the word. He also settles a joke with her by publishing a small book of poetry to wide critical success, earning her respect even more deeply. It is his absence that shows her how much she cares for him.
While Rose is discovering her heart, Steve and a minor character, Kitty, engage to marry. This creates a new sensation in the family, and Kitty begins to look to Rose for sisterly guidance. Rose encourages her to improve her silly mind, and Kitty is a very willing pupil. Rose continues to wait for Mac's return but reaches a crisis when Uncle Alec becomes very sick while visiting Mac; Phebe nurses him back from the brink of death, at personal peril, and returns him to the anxious Campbells to be greeted as a triumphant member of the family, sealing her own engagement with Archie with everyone's blessing. This homecoming is completed for Rose when she is reunited with Mac and finally declares her own sentiments. The book closes with three very happy couples, and much hope for their felicity.

Galipeault Bridge

The Galipeault Bridge is a bridge on the western tip of the Island of Montreal, spanning the Ottawa River between Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue and L'Île-Perrot, Quebec, Canada. It carries four lanes of Autoroute 20, and was named after Antonin Galipeault, who was minister of public works under Louis-Alexandre Taschereau. Incidentally, Taschereau Bridge, along the same highway, was part of the same project. The first span was built in 1924, a girder bridge that was replaced in 1991 by another structure of the same type, using the same foundations. It was doubled in 1964 with a cable-stayed bridge, which carried the eastbound lanes of Autoroute 20 until its demolition early in 2008.
The 1964 doubling of the structure was done to appease business interests in L'Île-Perrot and Dorion who were worried that the abandoning of the unfinished Île Bray Bridge in favor of the nearby Île aux Tourtes Bridge, which avoids Perrot Island completely, might hurt their activities. The original plan for a freeway out of Montreal to the west called for upgrading the highway between Galipeault and Taschereau bridges to freeway standards, the doubling of Taschereau, and the construction of a new bridge in the vicinity of Galipeault, which would have connected with Autoroute 40 on the Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue side. The bridge in question, (Île Bray Bridge, which was never finished), was already under construction when the transportation ministry changed its plans in favor of a long span across Lake of Two Mountains.
The 1991 span carried the westbound lanes until the demolition of the eastbound structure forced its use as a two-way span. The eastbound span's construction was finished in early October and opened November 28, 2009.
Like Taschereau, Galipeault was built next to a Grand Trunk Railroad bridge that was part of the first fixed link from Montreal to the outside world.
54,000 vehicles use the bridge every day, or 19.7 million a year, making it among the busiest bridges in Montreal.

Library.
Serving the entire Southwest Virginia region as well as Northeast Tennessee, Western North Carolina and South Eastern Kentucky, William King’s Library is the only one west of Roanoke whose primary objective is arts and culture education. As such, it is the Museum’s mission to bolster the region– whose roots have long been planted in the cultural arts– with awareness and respect.
To meet this goal, the Library intends to accommodate specific areas of education. These include cultural heritage, exhibition history, curatorial records, and general arts based collections of books. Because the books cover such a large range of time and culture, a project that is currently underway will soon allow visitors to browse the library electronically.
The Print Archive is one of the most recent additions to the Library. Upon completion, visitors will be able to access all print materials affiliated with the Museum, including gallery guides, newsletters, education materials, special events, and much more.
Ultimately, the Library will provide a dedicated environment of arts based literature focusing on both the immediate region and across the world. The Library space is technologically equipped for projection purposes and the physical space is available upon request to host classes, discussions or lectures.
It is with hope and hard work that one day William King Museum’s Library will not only be another open door in the community, but a gateway into the world.
Research Archives.
The Cultural Heritage Archive is the research and data center for the Betsy K. White Cultural Heritage Project, a program of William King Museum. Since 1994, the Project has documented and photographed over 200 objects made by hand in Southwest Virginia & Northeast Tennessee prior to 1940. The goal of the Archive is to provide a lasting record of this region’s contribution to American decorative arts, including furniture, textiles, pottery, metalwork, musical instruments, art and other forms of material culture.
Sculpture Garden.
Weather permitting, view our permanent collection of outdoor sculpture on the Museum’s grounds. Several pieces are on view from the Museum’s most recent outdoor sculpture competition, held biennially. An additional work is here on extended loan. The outdoor sculpture guide is available for sale in the Looking Glass Museum Store.

Natural Area Reserves System Hawaii

The Natural Area Reserves System (NARS) of Hawaii is a statewide attempt to preserve in perpetuity specific land and water areas which support communities, as relatively unmodified as possible, of the natural flora and fauna, as well as geological sites, of Hawaii.
History.
Established in 1970 by Hawaii Revised Statutes Chapter 195, the system presently consists of 19 reserves on five islands, encompassing more than of the State's ecosystems. The diverse areas found in the NARS range from marine and coastal environments to lava flows, tropical rainforests, and even an alpine desert. Within these areas one can find rare endemic plants and animals, many of which are on the edge of extinction.
The Natural Area Reserves System is administered by the Department of Land and Natural Resources, Division of Forestry and Wildlife. Currently, management teams are working to control the encroachment of non-native plants and animals which threaten the existence of the natural biota on the reserves.
The reserves include:

Tottenham

Tottenham is an area in the London Borough of Haringey, in north London, England. It is situated north north east of Charing Cross.
History.
Toponymy.
Tottenham is believed to have been named after Tota, a farmer, whose hamlet was mentioned in the Domesday Book; hence Tota's hamlet became Tottenham. It was recorded in the Domesday Book as "Toteham".
Early history.
There has been a settlement at Tottenham for over a thousand years. It grew up along the old Roman road, Ermine Street (some of which is part of the present A10 road), and between High Cross and Tottenham Hale, the present Monument Way.
When the Domesday Book was compiled in 1086, about 70 families lived within the area of the manor, mostly labourers working for the Lord of the Manor. A humorous poem entitled the Tournament of Tottenham, written around 1400, describes a mock-battle between peasants vying for the reeve's daughter.
In 1894, Tottenham was made an urban district and on 27 September 1934 it became a municipal borough. As from 1 April 1965, the municipal borough formed part of the London Borough of Haringey.
The River Lea (or "Lee") was the eastern boundary between the Municipal Boroughs of Tottenham and Walthamstow. It is the ancient boundary between Middlesex and Essex and also formed the western boundary of the Viking controlled Danelaw. Today it is the boundary between the London Boroughs of Haringey and Waltham Forest. A major tributary of the Lea, the River Moselle, also crosses the borough from west to east, and often caused serious flooding until it was mostly covered in the 19th century.
From the Tudor period onwards, Tottenham became a popular recreation and leisure destination for wealthy Londoners. Henry VIII is known to have visited Bruce Castle and also hunted in Tottenham Wood. A rural Tottenham also featured in Izaak Walton's book "The Compleat Angler", published in 1653. The area became noted for its large Quaker population and its schools (including Rowland Hill's at Bruce Castle.) Tottenham remained a semi-rural and upper middle class area until the 1870s.
Modern era.
In late 1870, the Great Eastern Railway introduced special workman's trains and fares on its newly opened Enfield and Walthamstow branch lines. Tottenham's low-lying fields and market gardens were then rapidly transformed into cheap housing for the lower middle and working classes, who were able to commute cheaply to inner London. The workman's fare policy stimulated the relatively early development of the area into a London suburb.
An incident occurred on 23 January 1909, which was at the time known as the Tottenham Outrage. Two armed robbers of Russian extraction held up the wages clerk of a rubber works in Chesnut Road. They made their getaway via Tottenham Marshes and fled across the Lea. On the opposite bank of the river they hijacked a Walthamstow Corporation tramcar, hotly pursued by the police on another tram. The hijacked tram was stopped but the robbers continued their flight on foot. After firing their weapons and killing two people, Ralph Joscelyne, aged 10, and PC William Tyler, they were eventually cornered by the police and shot themselves rather than be captured. Fourteen other people were wounded during the chase. The incident later became the subject of a silent film.
During the Second World War Tottenham also became a target of the German air offensive against Britain. Bombs fell within the borough (Elmar Road) during the first air raid on London on 24 August 1940. The borough also received V-1 (four incidents) and V-2 hits, the last of which occurred on 15 March 1945. Wartime shortages led to the creation of Tottenham Pudding, a mixture of household waste food which was converted into feeding stuffs for pigs and poultry. The "pudding" was named by Queen Mary on a visit to Tottenham Refuse Works. Production continued into the post-war period, its demise coinciding with the merging of the borough into the new London Borough of Haringey.
In 1985, the Broadwater Farm housing estate in Tottenham was the scene of rioting between the police and local youths following the death of Cynthia Jarrett, a resident of Tottenham but who lived about a mile from the estate who died of heart failure after four policemen burst into her home. The response of the members of the black community in Tottenham and surrounding areas culminated in a riot beginning on Tottenham High Road and ending in the local Broadwater Farm Estate. One police officer, Keith Blakelock, was killed; 58 policemen and 24 other people were injured in the fighting. Two of the policemen were injured by gunshots during the riot, the first time that firearms had been used in that type of confrontation.
The Mecca Dance Hall was demolished in 2004 to make way for local housing.
The 2011 England riots were precipitated by the fatal shooting of a 29-year-old man in Tottenham, Mark Duggan, by officers of the Metropolitan Police Service on 4 August 2011.
Governance.
Parliament.
Tottenham is covered by the parliamentary constituency of Tottenham. The constituency was created in 1885 when the first MP was Joseph Howard of the Conservative Party, but was replaced by two constituencies: Tottenham North and Tottenham South in 1918. Since being reinstated in 1950 it has been predominantly represented by Labour Party candidates, with the exception of Alan Brown who defected to the Conservatives. The current MP is David Lammy who won a by-election in 2000 following the death of Bernie Grant.
Local Government.
Tottenham developed from a parish in Middlesex into an Urban sanitary district in 1875, after a local board of health had been established in 1850, then divided in 1888 so that Wood Green became a separate authority. In 1894 Tottenham was reconstituted first as an urban district then as a municipal borough in 1934, before being subsumed into the larger London Borough of Haringey under the Local Government Act 1963.
Today, Tottenham is represented by nine local council wards: Seven Sisters, Harringay, St Ann's, Tottenham Hale, Tottenham Green, White Hart Lane, West Green, Northumberland Park and Bruce Grove. Councillors in 8 of these wards represent the Labour Party, the ninth (Harringay) being represented by the Liberal Democrats.
Geography.
Districts.
Tottenham is a large area incorporating the N15 and N17 postcode areas.
North Tottenham.
This area stretches along Tottenham High Road from the Edmonton border in the north to Lordship Lane in the south: districts include Little Russia and Northumberland Park. Landmarks include White Hart Lane, home of Tottenham Hotspur, White Hart Lane station and Northumberland Park station.
Central Tottenham.
Continuing along the high road, Central Tottenham includes Bruce Grove, Tottenham Green and Tottenham Hale wards, as well as Tottenham Hale station and retail park, Tottenham Marshes (part of the Lee Valley Regional Park) and Bruce Castle.
South Tottenham.
Further along the A10 road until St Ann's Road, this area includes South Tottenham, St Ann's neighbourhood, West Green and Seven Sisters. Transport links include Seven Sisters station and South Tottenham station. Landmarks include the Markfield Beam Engine and Downhills Park.
West Tottenham.
To the west of the area are Broadwater Farm, the Tower Gardens Estate and Lordship Recreation Ground.
Neighbouring areas.
North.
The northern limit of Tottenham is north of Brantwood Road where Upper Edmonton begins. This is also the border between the London Borough of Haringey and the London Borough of Enfield. To the northwest is Palmers Green.
East.
The eastern limit of Tottenham is the River Lea, and across the river the neighbouring district is Walthamstow in the London Borough of Waltham Forest
South.
The southern limit of Tottenham is the junction of St. Ann's Road with Tottenham High Road, which after becomes Stamford Hill. The district of Stamford Hill borders Tottenham, marking also the border of the London Borough of Hackney. To the southwest, Tottenham borders Manor House and Harringay, briefly meeting the London Borough of Islington.
West.
Although the N15 postcode area extends to Green Lanes, the western border of Tottenham is better defined as Black Boy Lane, West Green Road and Downhills Way. The neighbouring districts are Harringay, Hornsey, Wood Green and Noel Park.
Demography and crime.
Ethnic composition.
Tottenham has a multicultural population, with many ethnic groups inhabiting the area. It contains one of the largest and most significant populations of African-Caribbean people. These were among the earliest immigrant groups to settle in the area, starting the UK's Windrush era. Soon afterwards West African communities – notably the many Ghanaians – began to migrate into the area. Between 1980 and the present day there has been a slow immigration of Colombians, Congolese, Albanian, Kurdish, Turkish-Cypriot, Turkish, Somali, Irish, Portuguese, and Zimbabweans populations. South Tottenham is reported to be the most ethnically-diverse area in Europe, with up to 300 languages being spoken by its residents.
According to David Lammy MP, Tottenham has the highest unemployment rate in London and the 8th highest in the United Kingdom, and it has some of the highest poverty rates within the country. There have also been major tensions between the African-Caribbean community and the police since (and before) the 1985 Broadwater Farm riot.
Organised crime.
Tottenham has been one of the main hotspots for gangs and gun crime in the United Kingdom during the past three decades. This followed the rise of gangs and drug wars throughout the area, notably those involving the Tottenham Mandem gang and various gangs from Hackney and all of the areas surrounding Tottenham, and the emergence of an organised crime ring known as the Turkish mafia was said to have controlled more than 90% of the UK's heroin market.
Transport.
Two London Underground lines serve the Tottenham area. The Piccadilly line, which opened in 1932, has one station Turnpike Lane, which was the first Underground station within the then Tottenham Borough boundaries. The Victoria line, which opened in 1968, has its operating depot in Tottenham at Northumberland Park, as well as two stations, Seven Sisters and Tottenham Hale, in the area. National Rail stations Seven Sisters, Tottenham Hale, Bruce Grove, White Hart Lane and Northumberland Park also serve the area with train services provided by Greater Anglia. London Overground trains serve South Tottenham station.
Sport.
Tottenham is the home of Premier League football club Tottenham Hotspur. Tottenham have won the Football League twice, the FA Cup eight times, the UEFA Cup twice, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup once and the Football League Cup, four times. In 2010, they qualified for the UEFA Champions League, Europe's elite competition for the first time. The club's home ground is White Hart Lane, located on Park Lane, rather than the road of the same name. The ground is named after the White Hart Inn that it was built behind, and the nearest station to the ground.
Tottenham also has two non-League football clubs, Haringey Borough F.C. and Haringey & Waltham Development F.C., which both play at Coles Park.
Namesakes.
"Tottenham cake" is a sponge cake baked in large metal trays, covered either in pink icing or jam (and occasionally decorated with shredded desiccated coconut). Tottenham Cake "was originally sold by the baker Henry Chalkley, who was a Friend (or Quaker), at the price of one old penny, with smaller mis-shaped pieces sold for half an old penny." The pink colouring was derived from mulberries found growing at the Tottenham Friends burial ground. Originally "a peculiar local invention" of north London, the cake is now mass-produced by the Greggs chain of bakers.

Peter McLeod

Peter Gerard McLeod (born 6 May 1948 in Newcastle, New South Wales) is a retired Australian racing driver, best known as co-winner of the 1987 James Hardie 1000 at Bathurst, and for driving the distinctive yellow and black Slick 50 Mazda RX-7 Group C touring car during the early to mid-1980s.
Group C Touring Cars.
McLeod began his racing career in 1980 at the relatively old age of 32, progressing immediately into touring car racing where in just three seasons to become one of Australia's fastest privately entered touring car racers, and usually had the fastest Mazda RX-7's behind Allan Moffat's factory supported team (though with reportedly more horsepower than Moffat's cars). By 1981 he had scored his first podium result with a third at the Oran Park 250 behind the Falcon's of Dick Johnson and veteran Murray Carter.
His pace and consistency were rewarded when he won the 1983 Australian Endurance Championship, which didn't start well with 12th at both the Sydney rounds (Amaroo Park and Oran Park), followed by a DNF in the Castrol 400 at Sandown Raceway in Melbourne. It was his results in the final 3 rounds of the series which lifted him above the JPS Team BMW 635 CSi of Jim Richards. McLeod finished 7th in the James Hardie 1000 at Bathurst co-driving with Graeme Bailey, 3rd at the Surfers Paradise 300, and finally 6th in the Humes Guardrail 300 at the Adelaide International Raceway (AIR) in November. Richards needed to finish at least 2 points in front of McLeod to win the title at Adelaide, but could only manage 9th in his BMW, giving the Wollongong based McLeod his first and only touring car championship in just his 4th season of driving.
Still driving the Slick 50 Mazda, McLeod finished third in the 1984 Australian Touring Car Championship behind the Holden Dealer Team Commodore of Peter Brock, and series winner Dick Johnson in his Greens-Tuf Ford Falcon. McLeod went into the final round at Adelaide in 2nd position, 22 points in front of Brock, and needed to only finish 14th to claim 2nd. Unfortunately a clash with the BMW of Jim Richards on lap 4 at the end of AIR's 900 metre long front straight meant the Mazda was out on the spot, and with Brock finishing the race 2nd behind Allan Grice and gaining 23 points, he moved to 95 points, 1 point in front of McLeod.
Following the ATCC McLeod was unable to repeat his 1983 Endurance Championship win and finished the 1984 Championship in 9th place. After finishing 3rd in the opening round, the Silastic 300 at Amaroo Park, behind the Nissan Bluebird Turbo of Garry Scott, he finished 7th in the Valvoline 250 at Oran Park, but it went downhill from there. McLeod and Graeme Bailey failed to finish at Sandown and Bathurst, while Mcleod didn't compete at the Surfers Paradise 300 bringing an end to the Group C era in Australia.
There were two more Group C races held before the end of 1994. One was the support race for the Australian Grand Prix at the Calder Park Raceway in Melbourne. After qualifying 8th at Calder the RX-7 didn't get off the line and was a first lap DNF. McLeod didn't take the car to the final ever competitive Group C race at Baskerville Raceway in Tasmania.
1985 Daytona 24 Hour.
In 1985 he joined Allan Moffat, Kevin Bartlett and Gregg Hansford in Mazda Australia's attack on the 24 Hours of Daytona. Driving Moffat's Bathurst RX-7, but with a different rear wing and without the CAMS imposed lead ballast, the car qualified in the 38th (11th in the GTO class) and ran strongly until mechanical failure near the end of the race. They were eventually classified 24th, 221 laps behind the winning Porsche 962 driven by A. J. Foyt, Bob Wollek, Al Unser and Thierry Boutsen. McLeod, Moffat and Hansford, all of whom had been regular drivers of the RX-7's in Australia, all expressed delight with how much quicker the car was without its added weight, stating that without that extra weight, the rotary powered cars would have proved more of a threat to the V8's at Bathurst.
1985 Australian GT.
Peter McLeod continued to race his Slick 50 RX-7 in the 1985 Australian GT Championship. He performed consistently during the series to finish 5th, his best finish being 3rd at Adelaide. Unfortunately the 13B engined Mazda was still in CAMS production based Group C trim that it finished 1984 in and was seriously outgunned by specially built cars such as Bryan Thompson's 4.2L Chevrolet powered, twin turbo Mercedes-Benz 450 SLC and his newly acquired 6.0L Chevy Monza (the Monza had easily won the 1984 Championship in the hands of Allan Grice), and Kevin Bartlett's ground effects De Tomaso Pantera. Thompson would win the title driving both the Merc and the Monza.
Following the 1985 championship the GT series wasn't seen on the Australian calendar until 2005.
Group A touring cars.
The change to Group A touring car regulations for the 1985 Australian Touring Car Championship forced McLeod, and others such as Allan Moffat, to abandon the RX-7 as the cars would have to revert to running the standard 12A motor, would have no aerodynamic aids and would generally be uncompetitive. Like many privateers, McLeod opted to drive a Holden VK Commodore for the 1985 season, but like most Commodore teams, including the factory-backed Holden Dealer Team, the 1985 Group A Commodore wasn't as competitive as hoped. Compared to 1984, the cars had no aerodynamic aids, was some 120 kg heavier, and had lost approximately in 1985. McLeod's car, built from an ex road car, came into its own in the 1985 James Hardie 1000 at Bathurst, and for much of the race McLeod and co-driver Bailey had the car running in the top 10, and indeed held 5th place for a time and was the second Commodore on the road behind Peter Brock's lead HDT car. Their good run came to and end when the gearbox broke on lap 126.
Like all Commodore runners, McLeod upgraded to the newly homologated Holden VK Commodore SS Group A for 1986. He competed in only two rounds of the 1986 ATCC at Sandown and Oran Park, and finished 19th in the championship. He did not have a good Endurance Championship. He failed to finish the Castrol 500 at Sandown and after qualifying 15th at Bathurst, McLeod crashed the Commodore heavily at the 160 km/h right hand McPhillamy Park on lap 48 of the race. McLeod later reported that the car blew its right front tyre and, unable to steer the car, he drove over the ripple strip on the outside of the track and flew clear over the sand trap and into the tyre wall, destroying the front right of the car in the process. The car's roll cars withstood the accident and Mcleod was able to walk away from the incident unhurt although he was a little shaken. Bathurst 1986 was where McLeod's friend Mike Burgmann lost his life in a 260 km/h crash at the base of the bridge near the end of the 1.9 km long Conrod straight. The consequence of Burgmann's crash saw the inclusion of Caltex Chase to the circuit in 1987 in a bid to slow the cars down. McLeod's former co-driver Graeme Bailey won the 1986 James Hardie with Allan Grice in a Holden Commodore.
McLeod continued to run his VK Commodore during 1987 including the Castrol 500 at Sandown co-driving with Peter Fitzgerald (DNF after only 17 laps with a failed clutch). Following the Sandown race, McLeod was drafted into the by then no longer factory-backed Holden Dealer Team, running under the name Brock HDT P/L after Brock's well publicised split with Holden earlier in the year, to drive the teams 2nd car at the 1987 James Hardie 1000 which had become a round of the 1987 World Touring Car Championship. Channel 7 commentator Neil Crompton was to drive but didn't have the proper international licence at the time for a World Championship event and McLeod drove in his place. McLeod joined formula 2 racer John Crooke in car #10 (Brock's 1986 car upgraded to VL Group A specs). Despite setting the qualifying time for his usual #05 car, Brock also set the time for car #10 (2 seconds faster than McLeod). Despite it being against the rules for a driver to qualify two cars (i.e. Brock's time for car #10 should not have counted towards the cars grid position as he had also set fastest time in 05, his nominated #1 car), somehow Brock's time stood and was good enough to put the car in 20th place (McLeod's time was good enough for 27th on the grid). McLeod completed the first two stints of the race totaling 61 laps, lifting the car to 5th place. Team mates Peter Brock and David Parsons then took over the car after their 05 went out with engine failure on lap 34. Inspired driving by Brock and Parsons in a rain-plagued second half combined with good strategy and a lucky break with safety car procedures placed them into third position behind the two Eggenberger Motorsport Ford Sierra RS500s at the end of the race. The car was only thrown together with old parts lying around the HDT workshop and wasn't expected to last very long (something McLeod didn't know at the time) so for it finish third while the teams lead car expired early was a surprise to the team.
Before the race, a formal protest had been lodged against the Eggenberger Sierras for illegal bodywork relating to the size of their front wheel arches. As no road-legal Sierra existed in Australia at the time, the protest was delayed by a few months and it wasn't until January 1988 that McLeod, Brock and Parsons were declared the winners of the 1987 James Hardie 1000.
Like other privateer Commodore runners, McLeod saw little value in driving in the 1988 Australian Touring Car Championship against the improving Ford Sierras, though he did run in the first five rounds of the nine-race series. Following the ATCC, McLeod built a new 'Walkinshaw' spec VL Commodore Group A SV with the engine and suspension supplied by the Peter Brock organisation, who by that stage were running the BMW M3's. The car debuted at the Enzed 500 at Sandown complete with sponsorship from Yellow Pages, the car's yellow and black paint scheme looking very similar to the Slick 50 Mazda of McLeod's Group C days. Clutch failure ended Mcleod and co-driver Jim Keogh's race after just 21 laps at Sandown after qualifying 15th. The Tooheys 1000 at Bathurst wasn't much better for the team. The car had three separate crashes in practice and qualifying and then blew its engine in the morning warm-up. The crew had just under 90 minutes to replace the engine and get the car into pit lane to make the start. This they accomplished just as the field was coming around for the rolling start (used for the first and only time in the race's history) and after taking two laps to get the car started, it lasted only 7 laps before the replacement engine failed. Following the race, Peter McLeod bowed out of touring car racing, claiming it was too expensive to run a competitive Group A touring car.
Bathurst 12 Hour.
With the advent of the 12 hour Production Car Race at Bathurst, McLeod took to the Mountain again in a Citroën BX 16V in 1991 finishing second in class B, returning the following year with a 3-car factory team to win the class, this time beating the Brock-prepared and driven Peugeot 405s. Further 12-hr attempts followed in the BX 16V's and later in a Mazda RX-7 Twin Turbo with moderate success.
V8 Supercars.
McLeod faded out of the scene over the next few racing seasons but returned to the sport in 1994 as McLeod's son Ryan started to make his way into V8 Supercar racing. McLeod co-drove with Ryan McLeod in endurance races from 1994-96 before retiring completely. McLeod has stayed involved in the sport and recently has acted as driver of V8 Supercar's safety car.
Semi-Retirement.
McLeod has since turned his attention to his passion for Citroëns, importing and fully restoring the rare and highly prized Maserati-engined Citroën SMs from the early 70s. His work is highly regarded on an international scale and the cars are in demand by classic car enthusiasts worldwide. Over 30 such examples have now been completed. A return to Bathurst as a competitor occurred for the 2009 WPS Bathurst 12 Hour driving a Holden Astra SRi Turbo, co-driving with his two sons, Ryan and Gerad. The family run car finished 21st.

Pan Guangdan

Pan Guangdan (Chinese: 潘光旦; 1899–1967) was one of the most distinguished sociologists and eugenicists of China. Educated at Tsinghua University, Dartmouth College and Columbia University, he was also a renowned expert on education. His wide research scope included eugenics, education policy, matrimony policy, familial problems, prostitute policy, intellectuals distributions and etc. Pan's wide-ranging intellect led to his active participation in the Crescent Moon Society.
For Pan, eugenics was both a political and scientific matter, and he is credited with the popularization of eugenic thought in the 1920s and '30s in China. Some of his most influential works include "The Eugenic Question in China" (中国之优生问题）and "Chinese Family Problems" （中国之家庭问题）(1928). In these works, Pan promoted the family structure over individualism, which he believed, along with traditional marriage, to be most effective in racial improvement through biological inheritance. Urban living, he said, only promoted decadent individualism and contributed nothing to the racial fitness of the nation. Although he supported the use of state power for the implementation of eugenic policies, primarily through his founding of The Chinese Eugenics Institute, conflicts such as the Sino-Japanese War, World War II, and the civil war between the KMT and the Communists prevented governmental adoption of his ideas. (Citation: Dikotter, Frank. "The Discourse of Race in Modern China." Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1992. pp. 174–185.)
Pan's most famous student/protégé was Fei Xiaotong, the "father of Chinese anthropology."
Pan joined the China Democratic Groups League (later China Democratic League) in 1941, and was a standing committee member of the central committee of the League.
During the Anti-Rightist Movement, he was determined to be a "rightist." 
Pan was persecuted in Cultural Revolution, and died in 1967, at 69. He was rehabilitated in 1979.

AVE Class 103

The AVE Class 103 is a high-speed train used for the AVE service and operated in Spain by the state-run railway company RENFE.
The trains were constructed by Siemens, as the second member of the company's Velaro family.
History.
On 24 March 2001, Siemens won one half of RENFE's tender to supply 32 high-speed trains for the Madrid-Barcelona high-speed rail line, offering a modified version of the ICE 3 high-speed train used by German Railways (Deutsche Bahn) for its InterCityExpress service. Changes involved an up-rate to higher power () for higher acceleration and top speed to cover the between Barcelona and Madrid in 2h30m, the ability to operate in a high range of temperatures, and a different interior.
The ICE 3 trains were a joint production with other Germany-based train manufacturers, who refused to supply parts or sell licenses to Siemens for the AVE Class 103. This caused a delay (for which Siemens eventually paid €21 million), during which Siemens had to re-develop the missing components. However, at the end of this development, Siemens had a complete high-speed train platform, which it named Velaro. The AVE Class 103 was intended as only the second member of a whole family after ICE 3, therefore, it was named by Siemens as the Velaro E.
The AVE Class 103 has been certified to run at . During testing between Madrid and Zaragoza, on 16 July 2006, train 005 reached . This is both the current national rail speed record for Spain, and also the current speed record for a normal series train in standard configuration.
On 23 December 2005, RENFE ordered a further 10 identical trains (Siemens designation Velaro E2). Currently, all 26 trains from both orders have been delivered and are in service.
Specifications.
The certified top speed of the AVE Class 103 is , currently the highest for any train in the world, although the Alstom AGV, currently conducting extensive tests, aims for certification at .
The class has distributed traction, traction equipment was moved underfloor, with powered bogies distributed in alternate carriages along the length of the train. This removes the need for driving units at either end, which AVE Class 100 and 102 have, allowing a better use of space, better energy efficiency, better acceleration at lower speeds, and better ability to climb grades. For the AVE Class 103, four of the eight cars were fitted with two powered bogies each.
Electronically, the train is actually two identical half-trains of four coaches each, each with an independent power system, apart from the active pantograph (only a single pantograph is raised on AC-fed rail lines) and a high voltage line along the entire length of the 8-car train.
The train's capacity of 404 passengers is split between three classes; with two coupled 8-car trains total capacity is therefore 808 passengers. In the end coaches (driving trailers), glass screens separate the driver and passengers, and allow passengers the same views as the driver, just as in the ICE 3 and other Velaros. The driver can turn these opaque if necessary or preferred.
In Service.
The AVE Class 103 entered commercial service on 22 June 2007, between Madrid and the temporary end of the line to Barcelona near Tarragona.
While the trains and the tracks were commissioned for a regular top speed of , the train control and signalling system necessary for such operation, ETCS Level 2, was not ready for service. Thus commercial top speed is limited to the maximum Spanish authorities approve for the line with ETCS Level 1 since 7 May 2007, .
ERTMS is technically capable of supporting speeds of up to 500 km/h, but the signal spacing on the Madrid-Barcelona line is only sufficient to support speeds of 300 km/h.
From the opening of the Córdoba-Málaga high-speed rail line on 24 December 2007, the AVE Class 103 were also used from Madrid to Málaga.
On 20 February 2008, the final section of the Madrid-Barcelona high-speed rail line into Barcelona was opened. From that day, the AVE Class 103 were used for the faster services between Madrid and Barcelona, achieving the shortest travel time of 2h30m on the non-stop runs.

Godzilla (Game Boy)

Plot.
Various monsters that Godzilla had previously defeated, have kidnapped his son, Minilla, and hidden him somewhere inside the Labyrinth of Matrix. It is up to Godzilla to fight the monsters' attacks and solve their many puzzles, all while navigating a much larger maze.
Gameplay.
The game is a 2D side-scrolling video game where Godzilla can only walk around or climb ladders, vines or crystals. A prominent part of the game is his punch, the only attack he has, which is used to punch and destroy boulders, and to kill or push enemies. The main point of each room is to destroy all of the boulders, by pushing them against a wall and hitting it again. Once all of the boulders are gone, one or two arrow panels will appear somewhere in the room. Touching one will take Godzilla to the room in a large map corresponding to its direction. As levels are completed, the direction is revealed on the map for further use.
There are two power-ups; the hourglass and the lightning bolt. The hourglass stops all enemy movement for a short period of time. The lightning bolt kills all enemies on-screen except for Ghidrah.
Saving.
The game uses a password system to save. There are two variations; a four-character password and an eighteen-character password. Four-character passwords only saves the player's position on the map, while eighteen-character passwords saves the revealed map points. Neither of them saves extra lives or the player's score.

David John Nevin

David John Nevin (Born 1830) was an American officer in the Union Army during the American Civil War.
Early life.
Prior to enlisting in the Anderson Zouaves Infantry Regiment of New York (later the Sixty-second New York State Volunteers), Nevin had worked as a coal merchant in New York City. 
Civil War.
Nevin enlisted in the Union Army on April 27, 1861, at New York City as Captain of Company 'D' of the Anderson Zouaves. He received his commission on June 30, 1861. 
With the resignation of the regiment's lieutenant colonel William S. Tisdale, Nevin was promoted to lieutenant colonel a position which became effective on October 25, 1861. A muster roll dated October 15, 1861 makes the comment that Nevin's promotion was made ""…by desire of the major (Oscar Veniah Dayton) and every line officer. Sanctioned by the Brig. General (John James Peck)"".
Nevin's promotion from captain to lieutenant colonel appears to have been a reward for good service while the regiment was encamped at Tennallytown, DC. Upon arrival at the encampment the colonel, lieutenant colonel and major were found to be absent and the regiment demanded that Nevin take command. Nevin acted in the capacity of senior officer for several weeks before handing in his resignation to Peck who forwarded it to Major General McClellan with the recommendation that it be rejected.
With the death of the regiment's colonel, John Lafayette Riker at the Battle of Fair Oaks on May 31, 1862, Nevin assumed command of the regiment a promotion which became effective on June 20, 1862. 
Nevin received special commendation from General Peck for his gallantry at the Battle of Fair Oaks. At the Battle of Malvern Hill, Nevin, due to sickness, commanded the regiment from an army ambulance.
In late 1862 Nevin was sentenced "to be cashiered," by a general court-martial. However, in April 1863 his sentence was disapproved by the Secretary of War, Edwin M. Stanton and he was released from arrest, and restored to his command.
After the removal of McClellan from command of the Army of the Potomac a conspiracy against Nevin by his superior officers was discovered, and Governor Seymour was ""…called upon to see that justice was done to one of whose services the State might well be proud.""
Nevin was mustered out of the regiment on June 29, 1864 at Petersburg, Va. He was succeeded by Lieut. Colonel Theodore B. Hamilton who commanded the regiment until it was mustered out at Fort Schuyler New York on August 30, 1865.

<doc id="18254249" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18254249" title="Load factor (electrical)">
Load factor (electrical)

In electrical engineering the load factor is defined as the average load divided by the peak load in a specified time period.
formula_1
Typical example of a large commercial electrical bill: KW Demand = 436, KWH Use = 57,200, Number of days in billing cycle = 32
Load Factor % = (57,200 KWH / (32 days X 24 hours per day)) / 436 KW X 100% = 17.08%
It can be derived from the load profile of the specific device or system of devices. Its value is always less than one because maximum demand is always more than average demand since we will not connect all the loads at a time and that to we will not operate its full capacity. A high load factor means power usage is relatively constant. Low load factor shows that occasionally a high demand is set. To service that peak, capacity is sitting idle for long periods, thereby imposing higher costs on the system. Electrical rates are designed so that customers with high load factor are charged less overall per kWh. This process along with others is called load balancing or peak shaving.
The load factor is closely related to and often confused with the demand factor. 
formula_2
The major difference to note is that the denominator in the demand factor is fixed depending on the system. Because of this, the demand factor cannot be derived from the load profile but needs the addition of the full load of the system in question.

Fortifications of Copenhagen

The fortifications of Copenhagen is the broad name for the rings of fortifications surrounding the city of Copenhagen. It can be classified historically as follows:
Medieval fortifications (12th-15th centuries).
The first fortification was the castle built by bishop Absalon in 1167 on Slotsholmen at the foundation of the city. This stood for 200 years until it was destroyed by the Hanse in 1369.
It was replaced in 1417 by the Copenhagen Castle built by the then bishop, but taken over by the king, Eric of Pomerania.
The ruins of both these castles are visible to the public view under the Christiansborg Palace.
Bastioned Fortifications (17th century).
The city was extensively fortified by Christian IV in the mid 17th century.
To the west the city was protected by a series of ramparts and bastions northwards from the Indrehavn, below Langebro. The remains of these works can be seen in the parks at "Tivoli", "Orstedsgarten", "Botanisk Have" and "Ostre Anlaeg". 
To the north, at the end of the wall, a fort was built, the "Kastellet".
To the east land was reclaimed from the sea to enclose the harbour; this land was also fortified with a rampart and ditch and a series of bastions. This now forms the district of Christianshavn.
Ring Fortification system (1886-94).
The most recent fortification of Copenhagen dates from the late 19th century. 
To the west was a fortification ring consisting of a rampart and ditch, with numerous bastions and batteries ("Vestvolden").
To the north, beyond a line of inundations around Utterslev Mose, lie 
5 detached land forts ("Bagsværd Fort", "Fortunfortet", "Garderhøj Fort", "Gladsaxe Fort", "Lyngby Fort"), backed to the south by 7 small batteries.
Along the coast, and connecting with the land defences were two bands of Naval forts or batteries; the first (inner) band comprising 3 older forts ("Trekroner", "Lynetten" and "Strykers") and 3 new ("Kalk", "Mellen" and "Provestenen"); and a second of 2 coastal forts ("Charlottenlund", "Kastrup") and a sea fortress ("Middelgrundsfortet"), plus 2 inland batteries ("Avedøre" and "Hvidøre") to reinforce the "Vestvolden". A third, outer line was added fifteen years later.
The design of the forts was guided by the principles of Brialmont.
Coastal defenses (1909-16).
The group of new coastal forts were constructed at the beginning of World War I. These were (clockwise): "Taarbæk Fort", connecting to the northern fort line; Flakfortet, at sea beyond "Middelgrund"; and "Dragør Fort", "Kongelundsfortet", Mosede Fort to the south.

Roberto Fonseca

Roberto Fonseca (born 1975, Havana) is a Cuban jazz pianist. From an early age, Fonseca was surrounded by music: his father was a drummer, his mother, Mercedes Cortes Alfaro, a professional singer (she sings on her son's most recent solo album, "Zamazu"), and his two older half-brothers, Emilio Valdés (drums) and Jesús "Chuchito" Valdés Jr. (piano) are also two young musicians of great international prestige.
After an early interest in drums, Fonseca switched to piano at the age of 8, and by 14 was experimenting with fusing American jazz and traditional Cuban rhythms; he appeared at Havana's Jazz Plaza Festival in 1991 when he was just 15.
Fonseca studied at the Cuba's prestigious Instituto Superior de Arte, where he obtained a master's degree in composition, even though he often says that he was a really bad student. After earning his degree, he left Cuba to find his sound.
His first album, "En El Comienzo", which he recorded with Javier Zalba and the group Temperamento, was awarded Cuba's Best Jazz Album in 1999. This success encouraged him to work on two solo records: "Tiene Que Ver" and "Elengo", combining latin jazz, drum and bass, hip-hop, urban music and Afro-Cuban rhythms.
In 2001, Fonseca went to Japan to record "No Limit: Afro Cuban Jazz". He also toured with the Buena Vista Social Club the same year and has worked with Rubén González, Ibrahim Ferrer, Cachaito, Guajiro Mirabal and Manuel Galbán.
A dream that toured all over the world, with over 400 concerts, promoting Ibrahim Ferrer's records next to great legends such as Cachaíto López, Manuel Guajiro Mirabal and Manuel Galbán, among others. Playing at the most prestigious venues, such as Frankfurt Alter Oper, Palais des Congrès (Paris), Albert Hall (London), Beacon Theatre (New York), Sydney Opera House (Australia), etc. Not a single review of Ibrahim's concerts, from South America to Asia, would fail to mention Fonseca's talent and his magnetic stage presence. 
That period of intense work, touring round the world, led Fonseca to realise that his music was ready for creating his own project. He dug deep to compose each of the songs that form "Zamazu", the result of the integration of all his influences; Afro-Cuban music, Jazz, classical music and traditional Cuban music. 
In the words of one reviewer, his last offering, Zamazu, is “a deftly varied and well-sequenced set that leaves a strong impression of who Fonseca is and promises plenty for the future".
2008 was a year full of work and experiences that have inspired Fonseca's new compositions, one being Columbia Pictures choosing the track "Llego Cachaito" from the "Zamazu" album for the Will Smith film "Hancock”.
With his latest album "Akokan" Fonseca wanted to bring the magic, strength and improvisation from a live show to the studio. With a quartet formation and accompanied by his band, the one that he has been playing with for the last 12 years, Fonseca as the record's producer has encouraged creativity and chemistry amongst the musicians
There are also two very special collaborations from artists that Fonseca admires, artists that have very different styles: Mayra Andrade, the Cape Verdean singer who wrote the words and sings on "Siete potencias", and Raul Midon, the American guitarist, wrote "Second Chance". On this track Fonseca did the arrangements and Midon accompanied him on guitar. In comparison to "Zamazu", on this new album the piano is the true protagonist with some incredible piano solos and a different way of playing, one enriched by many experiences and the desire for us to feel his passion for life and music as the driving force of each piece.
2010 Roberto Fonseca was the support act for Omara Portuondo's USA. And after the summer her latest album "Roberto Fonseca Live in Marciac" was released. this album includes a bonus DVD which features footage of Festival's 2009 show.

Line 14 of the Beijing Subway () is a rapid transit rail line in southwest Beijing. As of February 15, 2014, the line is 12.4 km in length with 7 stations, and is operated by the Beijing MTR Corp. Ltd.
The line is being extended to run across the southern and eastern fringes of urban Beijing from Zhangguozhuang west of the Yongding River in the southwest corner of the city to Shan'gezhuang in the northeast corner. When fully completed, Line 14 will be 47.7 km in length and have 36 stations.
The first phase of Line 14, from Zhanggezhuang to Xiju on the southwest corner of the Line 10 loop, opened on May 5, 2013. Most of Line 14's eastern portion is scheduled for completion by the end of 2014. The opening of the central portion of the line, from Xiju to Jiulongshan, is expected to follow in 2015. Line 14 is the first metro line in Beijing to use high capacity wide-body A size trains.
Route.
The precise route of Line 14 has been revised several times and is still subject to change even as construction on Phase I gets underway. Line 14 is certain to begin in the southwest at Dongheyan Lu, just west of the Yongding River, pass through Beijing South Station, where platforms for Line 14 have already been built, and eventually reach Wangjing. Phase I calls for construction of a line from Dongheyan Lu to Guangqu Lu.
In Phase I, Line 14 will begin at the Dongheyan Lu in Fengtai District, on the southwestern edge of urban Beijing. It will cross the river to Zhangyi Village and enter the 5th Ring Road. Going due east on Fengtai Nan Lu, it will pass by the Fengtai Sports Center, enter the 4th Ring Road and continue eastward on Fengtai Bei Lu, which becomes Lize Lu inside the 3rd Ring Road. Line 14 then meets Line 4 at the Beijing South Station, the city’s newly built high-speed rail terminus, near Yongdingmen, near the southern tip of Chongwen District. Going further east, Line 14 re-enters Fengtai District and crosses Line 5 near Puhuangyu. It then follows Pufang Lu through the heavily residential Fangzhuang section of Fengtai and emerges outside of the 3rd Ring Road on Hongyan Lu in Chaoyang District. Line 14 ends its eastward journey abruptly at Xidawang Lu, where it turns straight north. After passing by the Beijing University of Technology, Phase I of Line 14 will end at the junction of Xidawang Lu and Guangqu Lu, due east of Jinsong. Phase I may be completed by early as 2013.
Phase II of Line 14 will continue north on Xidawang Lu, crossing Line 7 near Baiziwan, and Line 1, at Dawang Lu. Further north, Dawang Lu turns into Jintai Lu, which Line 14 will follow to the Chaoyang Park. After cutting through the park, Line 14 will exit the 4th Ring Road via Jiuxianqiao Lu, which then extends straight north to the Capital Airport Expressway. North of the expressway, Line 14 enters the vast Wangjing neighborhood of Chaoyang District. The Line bisects Wangjing from south to north on Guangshun Nan and Bei Dajie. It then emerges north of the 5th Ring Road and terminates in the Laiguangying section of Chaoyang District. Phase II is expected to be completed in 2014.

Australia–Canada relations

Australia–Canada relations are the relations between the two countries of the Commonwealth of Australia and Canada, both former colonies of the British Empire with Elizabeth II as monarch.
According to a 2013 BBC World Service Poll, 79% of Australians view Canada positively, with only 7% expressing a negative view.
History.
Reluctant relations: 1886–1939.
The earliest, most notable connections between the two nations was the deportation of Canadian rebels who instigated an uprising in Upper and Lower Canada to Australia. A total of 154 Canadians from Upper Canada state prisoners were sent to Australian shores. Those involved in the Upper Canada rebellions, were sent to Van Diemen's Land (Tasmania). There are two monuments in Hobart commemorating the Canadian convict presence in Tasmania. One is at Sandy Bay (unveiled by The Honourable Douglas Harkness, former Minister of National Defence of Canada on 30 September 1970) and the other stands in Prince's Park, Battery Point (unveiled on 12 December 1995 by High Commissioner Brian Schumacher).
The rebels from Lower Canada were French Canadians known as "les patriotes". Like their Upper Canada counterparts, they rebelled against the appointed oligarchy that administered the colony and les patriotes, along with their English-speaking neighbours, clamoured for responsible government. As with the Upper Canada rebellions, the armed insurrections in Lower Canada also failed and 58 French Canadians were sentenced to transportation to New South Wales. Thanks to the intervention of John Bede Polding, Bishop of Sydney, they avoided the horrors of Norfolk Island and were allowed to serve their sentences in Sydney. They were eventually assigned as labourers to free settlers, contributing to the development of the colony, including the building of the Parramatta Road. Place names like Canada Bay and Exile Bay and a monument at Cabarita Park in Concord, Sydney (unveiled in May 1970, by PM Trudeau), attest to their presence in Australia.
In the last quarter of the 19th-century, the vast physical and psychological distances that separated Canada and the six Australian colonies suddenly narrowed. Victorian England's string of imperial successes in Africa and Asia – victories that gave London control over a quarter of the globe and over a third of its people – sparked a wave of romantic enthusiasm for the empire. This was particularly true in Canada, where economic stagnation, French-English tension, and the lure of easy American wealth caused some to doubt the young country's capacity to survive on its own. By the mid-1880s, as the Canadian Pacific Railway wove its final few miles through the Rocky Mountains to the edge of the Pacific, a number of influential Canadians began to envision the new railway as an integral part of a network that would unite Britain with its Asian empire. Throughout the decade, as Canada settled its western provinces and looked outward across the Pacific, popular support for an "All-Red Route" that would link Canada by cable and steamship to Australia grew steadily.
The romance of empire made a much smaller impression on the Canadian government. Nevertheless, it was soon forced to consider its relations with the Australian colonies. A slump in world trade, unrelenting pressure from Vancouver logging interests, and the persistent arguments advanced by Sir Sandford Fleming, a leading advocate of the Pacific cable, prompted it to accord the colonies a new importance. In May 1893, cabinet agreed to give an Australian, James Huddart, a £25,000 subsidy to operate a regular steamship service between Canada and New South Wales. Shortly after, Canada's first minister of trade and commerce, Mackenzie Bowell, agreed to lead a delegation to Australia to seek new markets for Canadian exports. He was not optimistic. "I do not," he wrote on the eve of his departure, "anticipate any great immediate results from our visit to Australia. The parties with whom we have been estranged so long can scarcely be brought into a close relationship at a moment's notice." Bowell was surprised then upon receiving a warm reception in Australia, and upon his return in the winter of 1893 reached two decisions designed to enhance Canada's relations with Britain's Pacific colonies; first, it agreed to convene a colonial conference in the summer of 1894; and second, it resolved to send John Short Larke to Australia as Canada's first trade commissioner.
Canada held the 1894 Colonial Conference in Ottawa, drawing representatives from the six Australian colonies, New Zealand, the South African colonies and Britain. Frustration in Ottawa arose though, when the Canadian proposal to strengthen imperial trade relations through a system of preferential British tariffs was effectively defeated by the opposition of two of Australia's largest colonies, New South Wales and Queensland, who were suspicious the Canadian initiative seemed designed to undermine Australia's protective Tariffs. The visit of John Short Larke also did not go as planned, as he was met with a protectionist press, warning "measure of [Larke's continuous success will also be the measure of our suicidal folly." Only the colony of New South Wales heeded the plead of Larke to help Ottawa subsidize Huddart's struggling steamship line. The Eastern Extension Company, which operated a telegraph service linking Australia to Egypt and thence to Europe, promoted widespread opposition to the whole idea of a Pacific Cable. The only sign of Australian interest in trade with Canada disappeared abruptly when exploratory talks between Larke and the premier of Victoria were suspended pending Australian federation.
Still, from the Canadian perspective, there seemed every reason to persevere. Despite initial financial reverses, the Canadian-Australian Steamship Line managed to establish a regular shipping service. Bilateral trade, though still minuscule, slowly increased as a result. Canadian exports to Australia – principally timber, canned salmon and manufactured farm implements – tripled in value between 1892 and 1900. Moreover, Canada enjoyed a tidy surplus: in 1900, it exported over $1.6 million worth of goods to Australia in exchange for imports worth only $660,000. Facilitated by regular steamship and cable connections, commerce between the two British dominions seemed certain to expand following the federation of the Australian colonies in January 1901. Canada's Liberal prime minister, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, was encouraged by Canadian exporters to take advantage of these developments and appointed a second trade commissioner to Australia in 1903.
The new trade commissioner, D.H. Ross, made little progress with the Australians. Most of Australia's exports to Canada were agricultural and so were already admitted free of duty; it had little need for the kind of broad reciprocal trade deal desired by the Laurier government. Instead, Australia suggested that the two countries negotiate an agreement that covered a very limited number of items. Protectionist sentiment, whose influence on Australian policy was magnified by a series of unstable minority governments, further complicated negotiations. These dragged on inconclusively for much of the decade, slowly straining Canada's patience. When Australia failed to respond promptly to a 1909 offer to conclude a treaty on the narrow basis it favoured, Ross erupted with exasperation:
"From several successive Ministers, I have heard strong expressions of sympathy towards the desires of the Canadian Government in regard to preferential trade that I am almost inclined to think that such sentiments are nothing more than empty platitudes."
Laurier shared his trade commissioner's indignation and as trade relations with the United States began to show evidence of a new vigour, he became less interested in concluding a trade agreement with Australia. Few Australians were probably surprised by Laurier's change of heart; many were already convinced that "within a few years Canada either be an independent republic or an integral part of the United States." Indeed, with their broad Yankee accents and populist attitudes, Canadians seemed more American than British. Canada's efforts to reconcile these two influences on its national life increasingly led to friction with Australia over the nature of relations within the Empire. The imperial outlook that fostered Canada's interest in Australia also spawned a number of proposals for some form of imperial federation. Advocates of such schemes pointed out that federation would allow the dominions an opportunity to reconcile their interests with imperial foreign and defence policy. In exchange, they would assume a small share of the financial burden associated with defending the empire. In Australia, particularly after the South African War. this imperialist vision was embraced with considerable sympathy. Isolated by the vast Pacific Ocean – where German, French and Japanese imperialism seemed to roam unchecked – imperial federation offered Australia an opportunity to ensure that its interests were kept front and centre when British decision-makers tinkered with the disposition of the empire's naval resources. Canadians, on the other hand, were disillusioned by the Boer War and were increasingly alarmed by the notion of imperial federation. The country's significant French-Canadian minority, profoundly North American in outlook and sceptical of Britain's imperial mission, viewed the imperial connection as a trap whose only purpose was to force the self-governing dominions to assume greater responsibility for imperial defence.
By common consent, the prime ministers of Britain's self-governing dominions skirted this contentious issue at the 1902 Colonial Conference. The question, however, could not be avoided indefinitely. Frustrated by his repeated inability to persuade Britain to eject France from its possessions in the New Hebrides, the Australian prime minister, Alfred Deakin, arrived in London for the 1907 Colonial Conference determined to change the very basis on which the empire was organized. He proposed that the conference create an Imperial Council that would assume responsibility for the general shape of imperial defence and foreign policy. A secretariat would carry out agreed policy and facilitate communications between meetings. Laurier was unconvinced. Aware that closer imperial relations would inflame French Canadian opinion, Laurier charged the Australian with endangering dominion self-government. The debate raged for days, but Laurier, whom Deakin later denounced for his "fifth-rate part in the Conference", defiantly stood his ground. For the moment, this fundamental difference over how the empire might be organized precluded close relations. Even the election in 1911 of a Conservative and imperially minded prime minister, Sir Robert Borden, had little immediate impact on Canada's wary approach to imperial issues. However, the swirling passions that accompanied the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 swept away many Canadian doubts about the value of the Empire. The country plunged into battle alongside Australia and the other overseas dominions. The war revived the debate over imperial organization. This time, Canada and Australia were firmly united in pursuit of identical goals.
The war placed dominion governments in an awkward position. Although they remained responsible for the nature of their national contribution to the allied cause, Britain retained complete control over strategy and high policy. During the initial stages of the conflict, when it was thought that the war would only last a few months, this state of affairs was perfectly acceptable. But as the war dragged on and its horrifying scale became apparent, a number of dominion premiers became restive and uneasy. During a visit to London in 1915, Borden began to wage a campaign intended to force the British government to keep the dominions more fully informed of the war's progress. Early the following year, the newly elected Australian prime minister, W.M. Hughes, joined Borden's crusade. After a brief meeting in Ottawa, the two agreed on a broadly similar set of dominion objectives. Borden and Hughes proved a formidable team. They readily convinced the wily British prime minister, David Lloyd George, of the need to establish formal mechanisms to facilitate consultation between Britain and the dominions. An Imperial War Conference invited dominion prime ministers to consider the general problem of imperial relations, while an Imperial War Cabinet gave them a direct voice in the conduct of the war. The initial struggle for greater dominion status was successfully concluded in April 1917 when the Imperial War Conference recognized "the Dominions as autonomous nations of an Imperial Commonwealth... a right to an adequate voice in foreign policy and foreign relations." A year later, this theoretical expression of dominion sovereignty assumed practical significance when Borden and Hughes joined forces again to secure separate dominion representation at the Paris Peace Conference.
The success enjoyed by Hughes and Borden in demonstrating that British and dominion interests could be accommodated within a single imperial foreign policy, provided a temporary basis for continued Australian-Canadian cooperation. From the start, however, the postwar relationship was tense. Hughes approached the Paris peace talks determined to enhance Australian security by annexing the former German New Guinea. Borden was preoccupied with maintaining, as the one positive result of the war, continued Anglo-American cooperation. A breach in the Canadian-Australian relationship over the fate of Germany's Pacific colonies was only narrowly averted when officials devised a compromise that satisfied both Hughes' desire to annex New Guinea and Borden's wish not to alienate an American president who was committed to the principle of self-determination.
Borden's successor as prime minister, Arthur Meighen, was not so lucky. There could be no disguising the differences that divided Australia and Canada over the question of renewing the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of 1902. In Australian eyes, this mutual defence pact remained the best, and perhaps the only effective, guarantee against Japanese aggression. However, Washington strongly opposed the treaty, which effectively excluded it from a major role in policing the Pacific. Although Meighen was a staunch imperialist, he could not ignore the fact that renewing the Anglo-Japanese alliance would almost certainly strain Anglo-American relations and force Canada into the untenable position of having to choose between its two major allies. Given the issues at stake, Meighen and Hughes arrived in London for the 1921 Imperial Conference, each resolved to have his own way. Hughes opened the conference by defiantly insisting on the treaty's immediate renewal. Over the course of the next few days, the Australian cause was championed by an array of British imperial talent that included Lord Curzon, the Foreign Secretary, and Arthur Balfour, the Lord President of the Council. Undaunted, Meighen charged dramatically ahead. Canada, he declared, had "a special right to be heard," for, in the event of war between the United States and the Empire, Canada " be the Belgium." No possible form of this treaty, he continued, would satisfy the United States. The Empire had no choice but to scrap the offending treaty.
The Australian prime minister was outraged. He questioned Meighen's interpretation of American opinion; he objected to having imperial policy dictated by Washington; and he scornfully dismissed American naval power. He poured ridicule on Meighen:
"What does he offer us? Something we can grasp? What is the substantial alternative to the renewal of the Treaty? The answer is none...Now let me speak plainly to Mr. Meighen on behalf of Australia...If he will look at his own [defence budget and ours he will see what it means to have a great nation like America as his neighbour, under whose wing the Dominion of Canada can nestle safely...I must regard Mr. Meighen's presentation of the case as not the case for the Empire, but as the case for the United States of America."
But in the end, the Canadian view prevailed. At the Washington Conference in 1921 the Anglo-Japanese Treaty was replaced with the Washington Naval Treaty, a virtually unenforceable set of multilateral disarmament agreements designed to strengthen Pacific stability. The treaty compelled the Royal Australian Navy to scuttle their flagship battlecruiser HMAS Australia, whereas the Canadians did not have any capital ships of their own. The new arrangement was cold comfort in Australia, where the Canadian victory rankled for a long time to come. A Liberal protege of Laurier, Mackenzie King was elected in December 1921. Unlike his predecessor Meighen, an imperialist at heart who opposed the Anglo-Japanese Treaty only as a matter of necessity, King shared his mentor's determination to avoid all external entanglements that would weaken the bonds that held together French and English Canada. During his first years of office he asserted Canada's right to control its own foreign policy to better suit Canada's interests. When it was decided to convene an imperial conference in the spring of 1923, King resolved to use the occasion to repudiate the whole notion of an imperial foreign policy. The prospect of challenging the British Empire during his first overseas assignment filled the self-effacing prime minister with dread. "I am filled with terror," he confided to his diary, "at the thought of having to speak many times and my inability to work out themes."
What King lacked as a public speaker, he more than made up for in dogged persistence. No sooner had Lord Curzon introduced the question of imperial foreign policy than the Canadian prime minister rose in his place to declare his government's intention to "pursue a foreign policy of its own." The new Australian Prime Minister, Stanley Bruce, quickly confronted King. Bruce rejected the idea that each part of the Empire might shape a foreign policy of its own. "If the discussion continues on the present basis," he exclaimed, "we are going to achieve nothing at all with regard to consultation on foreign affairs." That, of course, was precisely King's objective, and as the conference proceeded, he opposed every effort to reach agreed positions on individual questions of foreign and defence policy. In these detailed discussions, King and Bruce clashed once again. The Australian's repeated efforts to secure Canadian support for a resolution endorsing Britain's plans for the defence of Singapore and the Suez Canal were turned aside. By the end of the conference, King's victory was complete. In a final burst of activity, he amended the meeting's concluding resolution on foreign relations to reflect his conviction that imperial conferences were consultative not policy-making bodies. King's success ended the experiment with a common foreign policy and signalled the emergence of the modern Commonwealth. It also added to the growing gulf separating Canada and Australia. King's attitude towards the Empire was incomprehensible to many Australian observers. The young R.G. Casey, then serving as an Australian liaison officer in London, watched the Canadian prime minister with bewildered fascination:
"Surely no one man can claim credit for having done so much as Mackenzie King to damage what remains in these autonomous days of the fabric of the British Empire. His efforts to make political capital out of his domestic nationalism are analogous to a vandal who pulls down a castle in order to build a cottage."
The subject of trade, which was increasingly bound up in the debate over the imperial connection, was equally divisive. The failure to conclude a commercial treaty had not materially harmed bilateral trade. Indeed, the war provided a tremendous boost to the sale of Canadian forestry products, metal manufactures and auto parts in Australia. However, access to this market, which became more important as a postwar recession deprived Canada of its American sales, was threatened. In 1921, Australia introduced steep new tariffs on Canadian newsprint at the same time as it announced its readiness to conclude trade treaties with members of the British Empire. In October 1922, Mackenzie King's minister of trade and commerce, James Robb, set out for Australia in renewed pursuit of a bilateral trade agreement.
The Australians proved to be tough bargainers. As was the case during earlier rounds of negotiations, there was little incentive for them to conclude a reciprocal trade agreement. Australian officials also resented Mackenzie King's reluctance to seek a broad imperial solution to the postwar slump in trade. In their view any agreement with Canada would merely assist American subsidiaries operating in the dominion at the expense of companies from Britain. For over two years, the discussions dragged on before Canadian negotiators were forced to give in to Australian demands in order to preserve the market for British Columbia's forestry products. In exchange for receiving important concessions on canned salmon, auto parts and paper, Canada reduced its duties on Australian meat and butter and increased the margin of preference enjoyed by Australian dried fruit. The 1925 agreement was soon the source of some controversy. It was strenuously opposed by Canadian farmers, who feared new competition from imported Australian meat and butter. Canada's conciliatory prime minister fretted about the accord which caused this noisy debate and condemned the minister responsible. Mackenzie King's liberal philosophy was offended by the prospect of raising Canadian tariffs on imports from third countries in order to give Australia an increased margin of preference for dried fruit. Moreover, these provisions were aimed primarily at the United States just as trade between the two North American countries had begun to recover. The prime minister gave the accord only lukewarm support, and no sooner had the agreement been approved than he delighted in crippling one of its main provisions. An Australian program to promote the export of butter was found guilty on a technicality of violating Canada's anti-dumping legislation in early 1926. King rejected the Australian prime minister's repeated pleas for understanding and insisted on imposing punitive duties. When, later in the decade, a slump in international trade began to pinch at Canadian exports to the United States, F.L. McDougall, a close advisor to the Australian prime minister, gleefully waited for depression "to drive Mackenzie King into a much more helpful attitude towards Empire economic cooperation."15 In anticipation, perhaps, Australia appointed its first trade commissioner to Canada, R.A. Haynes, in 1929.
Within a year, depression had indeed arrived, and Canadian voters had dismissed Mackenzie King. From the opposition benches, he watched the new, Conservative prime minister, R.B. Bennett, embrace suggestions for an imperial trading bloc. Enthusiasm for imperial preferences surged through the 1930 Imperial Conference and, before the formal discussions had ended, Canada and Australia had agreed to seek a closer trading arrangement. Negotiations were speedy and painless. On his way home from London, the Australian minister for markets and transport, Parker John Maloney, stopped in Ottawa to explore the new agreement's main features. He and Bennett agreed that it would rest on two principles: first, domestic producers in fields where the two countries were competitors would be given adequate protection; second, "a strong effort should be made by each Dominion to divert to the other goods which it did not produce and was currently importing from foreign countries."
Under the terms of the 1931 trade agreement, Canada was accorded the benefits of Australia's British preferential tariff on 425 out of the 433 items in the Australian tariff.17 Canada also secured important concessions on timber and agricultural implements. In return, Canada extended to Australia the benefits of its own British preferential tariff and increased the margins of preference enjoyed by Australian raisins and currants. The agreement's impact on bilateral trade was dramatic but one-sided. Between 1931 and 1935, Canadian exports to Australia almost tripled, and Canada's share of the Australian market jumped from 2.3% in 1931 to 5.7% in 1935. Not surprisingly, Canada opened a second trade commissioner's office in Australia in 1936.
Australian trade did not fare nearly so well under the new agreement. Between 1931 and 1935, Australian exports to Canada increased by less than 50%. Some important Australian exports, including butter, meat and canned fruit, actually declined during this period. Australia pressed Ottawa to extend the agreement but met with little success. Australia's discontent with Canadian trade policy increased sharply when Mackenzie King was re-elected in 1935. The depression had strengthened Mackenzie King's traditional opposition to imperial preferences, and he was anxious to seek freer trade with the United States. The 1935 Canada-United States trade agreement, which diminished the value of Australia's preference on dried fruit, was hardly calculated to endear Canada to Australian policy-makers, whose devotion to imperial preferences remained undiminished. In the spring of 1936, Canada paid the price for its poor reputation in Canberra when Australia unveiled its new "trade diversion policy". In an ill-fated effort to secure its markets in Britain and to balance its trade with the United States, Australia proposed drastically limiting its imports. Worried that Canada might become an alternate source for restricted American products, Australia included Canada in its program. "Here," declared Canada's outraged under-secretary of state for external affairs, " economic nationalism with a vengeance."
The 'trade diversion' controversy subsided when Washington managed to convince the Australian cabinet to drop the plan. Neither the ravaging depression nor German or Japanese aggression in the late 1930s could unite the two countries after years of division. Canada suggested that the two countries exchange high commissioners in order to encourage a closer "exchange of views". These proposals were rejected as "inopportune". Australia was against exploring new forms of representation which would limit British control in the Empire, while Canada scoffed at such a Colonial view. This was certainly not an unfair caricature of Canadian policy. Mackenzie King, aware of the strain that depression and the threat of war placed on national unity, studiously avoided international commitments. Canada's fate, he insisted, would be decided by Parliament alone. The Canadian attitude was unsettling and seemed to indicate that Canada no longer shared Australia's interest in co-operating with the British Commonwealth, a suspicion which seemed confirmed by the meagre results of the 1937 Imperial Conference. On the eve of war, Mackenzie King stood fast against Australia and its prime minister's efforts to secure a final declaration of imperial solidarity.
Awkward allies: 1939 to 1968.
Mackenzie King's ambiguous attitude towards Britain and its Empire disappeared with the outbreak of war in September 1939. A united Canada hurried to join Australia at Britain's side. The war heralded a new era in Canadian-Australian relations and gave the partnership an increasingly important political character. This transformation began smoothly. In the first days of the war, Canada renewed its suggestion that the two countries exchange high commissioners and Australia readily approved of a step that now appeared to affirm imperial unity. A businessman and former minister of defence, Sir William Glasgow, was quickly sent to Ottawa to head the new mission. At the same time, the Australian and Canadian high commissioners in London, Stanley Melbourne Bruce and Vincent Massey respectively, took the lead in organizing support for the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan, the centrepiece of Canada's early war effort. This gesture of Commonwealth solidarity, under which some 9,400 Australian airmen trained in Canada, did not go unappreciated. "The possibility of promoting better relations and more cooperation...is much better now than it was two years ago," Canada's first high commissioner to Australia, Charles Burchell, reported in May 1941. Burchell's optimism was premature. Japan's entry into the war in December 1941 created widespread fear in Australia that the country might be overrun. Canada's apparent lack of interest in the Pacific War drew considerable criticism in the Australian press. Misled by Burchell's inexperienced successor, Major-General Victor Odlum, into believing that Canada was ready to assist Australia with men and munitions, the Australian Minister of External Affairs, Herbert Evatt, submitted an anxious request for help. Constrained by its war effort in Europe, Ottawa was unable to respond positively. Undeterred, the minister renewed his plea during a brief visit to Ottawa in April 1942. Again, despite some initially favourable indications, Canada could not meet the Australian request. Canadian assistance, when it was finally offered as part of Canada's multilateral Mutual Aid program in May 1943, did little to improve Australia's view of its Commonwealth colleague. Ottawa insisted that Australia agree to reduce its tariffs and trade barriers at the end of the war before it would actually send any aid. Only after a good deal of bickering did the two countries manage to effect a compromise in early 1944.
These bilateral tensions were partly moderated by the web of personal relationships that the war spawned between officials in the two governments. As a result, recalled one Canadian diplomat, "here developed a collaboration in international organizations so habitual that it was taken for granted by the 1950s." These officials quickly discovered a mutual interest in making certain that the concerns of the small and middle powers in the postwar international system were not ignored by the great powers. Canada and Australia, however, differed on how to achieve this. For the Australian prime minister, John Curtin, the solution lay in transforming the Commonwealth into an institution that would rival the major powers in stature and influence. Canadian officials were suspicious of suggestions for closer Commonwealth consultation, which they feared might limit Canada's flexibility in dealing with the United States. Mackenzie King took an even dimmer view of Curtin's ideas. Such notions, he fumed, were part of a "deliberate design... to revive an imperialism which left the Dominions something less than national sovereignty" and represented "an attack on his personal position." The difference in approach was even greater at the United Nations where Evatt enjoyed a free hand in shaping Australian policy. The outspoken and combative foreign minister preferred to attack head-on the privileges enjoyed by the great powers. At the U.N.'s founding conference in San Francisco in 1945, he stubbornly opposed every clause in the U.N.'s charter that seemed to weaken the new organization or that gave the major powers undue influence. While some Canadian officials quietly admired Evatt's determination to strengthen the U.N., most were dismayed by his confrontational tactics. As Cold War tensions reduced the likelihood that the great powers would achieve a sufficient level of cooperation to ensure the survival of the U.N., discretion seemed the greater part of valour.
This difference in approach was so profound that Mackenzie King refused to meet Evatt to discuss their views on the great powers' efforts to secure a veto in the Security Council. Instead, he sent his heir apparent, the stately and dignified minister of justice, Louis St. Laurent. The meeting was unsuccessful. Evatt considered St. Laurent "a pawn in a move to defeat the Australian case" and dismissed him as "an American stooge." The bilateral relationship remained tense during the immediate postwar period. This partly reflected the disruptive influence of Evatt, who continued to irritate Canadian diplomats and politicians. His success at pressing Australia's claim to the "Commonwealth" seat on the U.N.'s first Security Council in 1946 was particularly galling. More significantly, this tension reflected very different security concerns. Australia, haunted by the spectre of a reconstructed Japan, was anxious to press ahead with a peace settlement that would remove this threat. At a conference in Canberra in September 1947 it sought the support of its Commonwealth partners to push the process ahead. Ottawa, however, was dismayed by the Australian bid to re-fashion a Commonwealth bloc. Washington was almost certain to resent the Australian demarche, which seemed likely to jeopardize Anglo-American cooperation as the cold war erupted in Europe. This sharp geographic difference in focus, which only increased in 1948 when Canada joined in the discussions that resulted in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, diminished the possibility of bilateral cooperation. Indeed, by the late-1940s, relations were so strained that they became the object of gentle derision in Ottawa. After a meeting with Princess Elizabeth and the infant Prince Charles, Lester Pearson confessed to his diary the "hope that relations... were not further disturbed by the fact that I was able to make the baby laugh while Chifley [Curtin's successor as prime minister was not."
The triumph of communism in China and the outbreak of war along the Korean Peninsula in June 1950 transformed the postwar landscape. The Cold War spilled beyond its European origins and emerged as a global phenomenon with a unique Asian dimension. Once again, Australian and Canadian troops found themselves fighting together, this time in Korea under the auspices of the United Nations. However, good relations remained elusive. The defeat of Chifley's Labor government and the election of Robert Menzies' conservative coalition threatened to make things worse. Ottawa worried that the new government's aggressive anti-communism and its increasingly suspicious attitude towards Indonesia might inhibit the West's ability to secure cold war allies among Asia's newly independent states. Australia was equally critical of Canada's cautious approach to the desperate challenges facing Asia. Percy Spender, the coalition's first minister of external affairs, held Canada partly responsible for the frustrating delays he encountered in establishing an aid program for South-east Asia. Spender's "brutal and eccentric" tactics in pursuit of what eventually became the Colombo Plan were deeply resented in Ottawa. The tense international situation left little room for such disputes. Growing allied tension over the strategy to be pursued in response to Chinese intervention in the Korean War threatened the Anglo-American harmony upon which both Canada's and Australia's foreign policy was predicated. A new Australian minister of external affairs, R.G. Casey, set out to tackle this problem when he was appointed to his post in the spring of 1951. An experienced diplomat, who had served in both London and Washington, Casey possessed a clear conception of the role that Canada and Australia might play in the Anglo-American relationship. He lost no time in making Pearson aware of his views:
"There is a wide field of potential co-operation and understanding between Australia and Canada, in which our two countries, working together, could be an effective force for the reconciliation of interests between the United States and Britain and an element of stability in the United Nations and the world in general."
Although Pearson was amused by Casey's "old Etonian, striped-pants manner," he was charmed and impressed by the Australian's "almost Boswellian ingenuousness." The close relationship that developed between Casey and Pearson provided the basis for a stable partnership whose effects lasted well into the 1960s. For the Australian foreign minister, whose country's isolated location prompted an enduring fear that its Anglo-American allies might become too focused on the Soviet threat in Europe, Pearson became an important source of information on developments in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). In exchange, Casey regularly sent Pearson copies of his confidential diaries containing frank comments on his travels through Asia and on discussions in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO). A succession of crises in Asia provided a host of opportunities for bilateral cooperation. For instance, when Canada agreed to sit on the three international control commissions established in 1954 as part of an effort to contain conflict in Indo-China, contacts between Australian and Canadian representatives became "very close and continual." Casey and Pearson also came to form the core of a small group of powers that quietly sought a solution to one of the principal obstacles to Asian stability, Communist China's continued exclusion from the international community.
The interest each minister exhibited in the other's country fostered the development of the relationship. By the mid-1950s, there was a flurry of new bilateral activity. In 1954, for example, the two countries' departments of immigration, aware that each confronted similar problems in settling the wave of postwar European immigrants, established the first of many inter-governmental exchange programs. At the same time, stimulated by the postwar economic boom, officials began to dismantle those tax barriers that discouraged investors from seeking new investment opportunities in the other country. By the end of the decade, Canadian direct investment in Australia had more than doubled. The quickening pace of bilateral relations attracted the attention of Pearson's cabinet colleagues. In 1955, Canada's ubiquitous "minister of everything", C.D. Howe, visited Australia in his capacity as deputy prime minister. Howe's visit, which led to a 1959 agreement on nuclear cooperation, heralded a slow but steady stream of Canadian visitors that culminated in 1958 when John Diefenbaker became the first Canadian prime minister to visit Australia. A good many of these visitors were struck by Australia's potential as a market for Canadian products. Canadian exports had remained stagnant for most of the 1950s, constrained by the import restrictions that Australia imposed to protect sterling's weak foreign exchange position. This hiatus gave the booming Australian economy an opportunity to redress its perpetual trade deficit with Canada and exports to Canada doubled during the decade.38 As Australia gradually liberalized its import regulations in the late 1950s, there were grounds to hope that the warm political partnership might secure preferential access for Canadians to this strong economy. After two years of discussions, which were complicated by Canadian efforts to protect its dairy and agricultural industries, a new trade agreement with most of the substantive provisions found in its 1931 predecessor, came into effect in June 1960. When combined with Australia's decision to lift the last of its import restrictions, its effect on trade was dramatic. In three years, Canadian exports to Australia almost doubled from $54.2 million in 1959 to $105 million in 1962. By 1964, they had jumped to almost $146 million.
With Commercial relations growing progressively closer, the two countries' political objectives began to diverge. In part, this was caused by the changing importance the postwar Commonwealth played in each country's foreign policy. The Australian prime minister seemed especially unhappy with the modern Commonwealth. The accession of large numbers of Asian and African countries had destroyed the comfortable club of the inter-war period. In Menzies' view, the Commonwealth had been "modernized out of existence" and transformed into something that "no longer expresses unity but exists chiefly to ventilate differences." In contrast, Canada embraced the boisterous and multiracial Commonwealth as an integral part of its foreign policy. It promised the more established country a forum in which to exercise its influence and offered access to new perspectives on international developments. There was never any question that Ottawa would risk its standing in this new Commonwealth by trying to ease Australia's growing isolation. By 1961, for instance, Canada was prepared to help force South Africa out of the Commonwealth despite clear indications that such action would strain its relations with Australia. Similarly, Ottawa rejected Menzies' efforts in the spring of 1963 to foster closer bilateral relations lest other members of the Commonwealth, particularly India and Pakistan, feel excluded.
The 1960s developed another uncomfortable factor in relations between the two countries – the war in Vietnam. Australia had come to depend on the United States in the South Pacific for its own security as it was the foremost Western power in the pacific. This new relationship was initially rooted in the 1951 Pacific Security Agreement and subsequently defined through their common membership in SEATO. Australia increasingly shared Washington's desire to curb communism in Asia, and slowly found itself dragged into the quagmire of south-east Asia. By 1967, the few advisers Australia had sent to South Vietnam had basically become a full combat division. Australia's growing attachment to Washington's Asia policy proved to reduce Canberra's capacity and inclination to function as a middle power under the weight of America. Because of this, Canadian officials designated Australia with less importance. Moreover, Asia began to emerge as an active source of continuing bilateral tension. Canada had always been sceptical of applying the European doctrine of containment of to Asia. By the mid-1960s, Canadian scepticism had changed to opposition as the strategy failed and conflict flared in Vietnam. The Canadian secretary of state for external affairs, Paul Martin, was soon embroiled in the search for an end to the war in Vietnam. His efforts, which included an ill-fated initiative to bring Peking's influence to bear on the U.N.'s deliberations, were deeply resented in Canberra. Australians wondered why their former ally was no longer fighting beside them in defence of freedom. Sadly, recorded the Canadian high commissioner in 1968, the war in Vietnam had come to "impose an emotional barrier between us."
Pacific partners: 1968–present.
With the appointment of Pierre Trudeau as Prime Minister in the spring of 1968, there was some hope that there could now be harmonious bilateral relations between Canada and Australia. Trudeau had long been an opponent of Canadian foreign policy and the amount of attention Canada lavished on the United States and Western Europe. He sought to extend Canadian diplomacy beyond its traditional range. Thus, Canada was one of the first Western powers to recognize the Peoples' Republic of China and insisted that this was only part of a more broadly based review of Canada's approach to the Pacific region. The Australian foreign minister, Paul Hasluck, found Trudeau's interest in Asia encouraging; he and his officials were cautiously optimistic that the new government, unlike the old, might embrace the Australian perspective on the crises in Asia before proceeding to recognize China.
Despite objections from Australia and other key allies, Canada recognized China. The war in Vietnam also continued to divide Canberra and Ottawa. Thus the Canadian effort to redefine its presence in the pacific continued to run around these central issues with Australia. When Jean-Luc Pepin, the minister of industry, trade and commerce, sought Australian agreement for a regular program of ministerial visits in order to revitalize the relationship, he met with little interest. In dismissing Pepin's demarche, the Australian minister for foreign affairs was blunt: "could not expect to make much headway in [its relations with Pacific Rim countries if persisted in seeking relations with Communist China." Trudeau fared little better when he visited Australia in 1970. The continuing crisis in South-east Asia cast a long shadow over the discussions. Although Trudeau managed to secure a pledge from his Australian host "to hold high level consultations," it seemed clear that Australian officials and politicians were hardly enthusiastic about Canada and its new prime minister.
When reviewing the matter with Arthur Menzies, Canada's long-serving and trusted high commissioner in Canberra, Australian politicians complained loudly that Trudeau had made no effort to understand Australia's perspective on Indo-China. Menzies' conclusion was disturbing: "Until circumstances arise in which some effective Canadian initiative can be taken in helping to end the hostilities in Indochina, I think that we will find ourselves still rather far apart from the Australians." Indeed, when Trudeau declared that the plug could be pulled on the Indian Ocean for all he cared, Australian officials made it clear that they "now wished that had never concerned himself with them."
Many of the differences separating the two countries diminished in 1972 though with the election of Gough Whitlam as Prime Minister of Australia's first Labor government since the 1940s. Whitlam had been skeptical of Australia's foreign policy, especially concerning its steadfast loyalty to the shrinking British Empire and faith in American globalism that appeared to be woefully mismanaged. Whitlam was determined to seek a new direction, and he looked to Canada, a country he had visited frequently in the 1960s as opposition leader. He admired Trudeau's determination in separating Canada from the United States and modernizing the Canadian constitution, which quickly led to an easy and natural rapport between the two leaders. Upon Whitlam's encouragement, many Australian officials traveled to Ottawa to study Canadian policy initiatives. These included the recognition of China, the new cabinet committee system, and policy on royal prerogatives and honours. Canadian officials were delighted to see a new interest in Canada from Australia, and were intrigued by Whitlam's attempts to carve out a more independent foreign policy from Britain, likely making it more dynamic in the Pacific and perhaps a useful partner.
Despite the Labor's party defeat in the 1975 general election, there was no need to qualify this assessment. Australia's new conservative Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, seemed to adopt a harder line on Cold War issues this his predecessor, Gough Whitlam, but shared his vision of a more independent foreign policy. Fraser also showed a renewed interest in the Commonwealth and created bilateral links with Japan, the ASEAN countries, South Korea and Communist China. Fraser's attempts to provide Australia with an opportunity to fulfill its leadership aspirations worried Ottawa. The growing economic and political presence of Australia in the Pacific led Paul Martin, Canada's high commissioner to Britain to fret that "Australia steal a march over us" by assuming the lead in Commonwealth discussions on Southern Africa. Many Canadian observers though were excited by the re-establishment of Australia as a Middle Power willing to act constructively and decisively. Australia's enhanced profile in the Pacific confirmed Ottawa's inclination to view Australia as an increasingly important partner in Canada's efforts to increase trade with Japan and to ensure regional stability by supporting such organizations as ASEAN. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Canada and Australia found themselves comfortably aligned not only when dealing with such Pacific questions as Cambodia's civil war, but also when confronted by crises in Southern Africa, Afghanistan and Poland.
This successful multilateral partnership had its bilateral dimension as official and unofficial contacts between the two countries multiplied in the late 1970s. Growing interest in each other's cultural and intellectual life, for example, led to the creation of the Canada–Australia Literary Award in 1976. At the same time, comparative studies in the two countries were more clearly defined when the Canadian-Australian Colloquium, the Canadian visiting fellowship at Macquarie University, and the Australian Association for Canadian Studies were established in 1981. Similarly, official contacts increased dramatically. In the first two months of 1977 alone, for instance, the two governments signed agreements on the exchange of information regarding energy research, aboriginal peoples, and crime prevention and criminal justice. By 1980, there were official exchange programs between Canadian and Australian departments responsible for statistics, aboriginal people, labour, justice and defence. Australia's only complaint – a traditional one – was that far too few Canadian politicians visited Australia. The problem soon disappeared. In one 18-month period in 1979–1981, the premiers of Ontario, British Columbia, Manitoba and Saskatchewan all travelled independently to Australia. They were followed by nine other federal and provincial cabinet ministers. In June 1981, the growing number of Canadian contacts with Australia prompted Ottawa to add a new consulate in Perth to its existing posts in Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney.
The sudden vigour of this relationship caught both countries by surprise. In both capitals officials seemed unaware of the complete range of bilateral contacts and the possibilities for further cooperation. As a consequence, neither Australia nor Canada seemed able to measure the importance of individual issues against the value of the entire relationship. As the long postwar economic boom gave way to a series of recurring economic challenges in the late 1970s, both governments tended to scratch out economic advantage where they could. While Ottawa barred the importation of Australian meat to protect Canadian farmers, Canberra denied Canadian airlines landing rights in Australia. Some officials worried that the web of connections that bound the two countries together might be severed one at a time without anyone ever noticing.
The solution clearly lay in creating some kind of mechanism that would ensure that individual issues, however important in themselves, were placed within the context of the broader relationship. Australian officials agreed. When the Australian foreign minister, Andrew Peacock, expressed keen interest in exploring new bilateral initiatives in 1980, Canada seized the occasion to press for a formal mechanism that would provide overall direction. Australia hesitated. Recalling an earlier and easier era, Canberra wondered whether more might be lost than gained in institutionalizing the relationship. In the end, Australia agreed that relations had become too important to be managed through simple ad hoc consultations. In September 1982, the two countries agreed to create a Senior Officials Committee (SOC) that would meet annually to oversee the relationship.
Senior officials from both countries met in Canberra for the first time in June 1983. The gathering, according to a Canadian report, appeared an immediate success:
This robust assessment was perhaps overstated. Certainly, during the following decade, the SOC found it impossible to eliminate the tendency in both capitals to disregard the overall relationship in pursuit of more limited objectives. Similarly, the committee was not always able to bridge the very real differences that emerged in the 1980s over such questions as Pacific security or multilateral trade. What the committee did provide, however, was a framework and a context for partnership. Its very creation reflected a conscious decision by both Canada and Australia to pursue as mature and independent nations a relationship that began in the 1890s as a simple by-product of Britain's Victorian Empire.
Defence history and relations.
Canada's and Australia's militaries have fought alongside each other numerous times including World War I, World War II, the Korean War and many United Nations Security Council-sanctioned missions.
The Battle of Kapyong is one of the many – and most prolific – examples of Australian and Canadian forces fighting together within a close proximity. The Korean War battle which occurred between 22–25 April 1951, saw the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3RAR) and the 2nd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (2 PPCLI) engaged in a ferocious defensive action against a Chinese force outnumbering them at least 5 to 1. Australian casualties were 32 killed, 59 wounded and 3 captured whilst Canadian losses were 10 killed and 23 wounded. 3RAR and 2PPCLI were both awarded both the United States Presidential Unit Citation and South Korean Presidential Unit Citation for their actions during the Battle of Kapyong.
To maintain this strong military alliance, a Canadian Defence Advisor is stationed at the High Commission in Canberra to share intelligence. Australia and Canada both contributed the International force in East Timor and both worked closely together to fight terrorism in Afghanistan
Comparison of Australia and Canada.
There are a great many similarities between the countries of Canada and Australia. They are both independent former settler colonies of Britain from which they have inherited many political traditions. Both nations are large, relatively isolated, and sparsely inhabited, and both use federal systems of government and both have Queen Elizabeth II as head of state. At the federal level, the Queen is represented in Canada by the Governor General (no hyphen), and in Australia by the Governor-General (hyphenated).
Canada, being the first of the British colonies to peacefully gain independence, became a model that was followed first by Australia, and then the other Commonwealth Dominions. Both were also affected by the same events in Britain and around the world: World War I, the creation of the shared monarchy in 1927, the Statute of Westminster in 1931, World War II, and the Cold War had similar effects on both nations. Both nations have been influenced strongly first by the United Kingdom and then United States, both culturally and politically.
Demography.
It is possible that some differences between the two nations' politics may be ascribable to the existence of a French speaking population in Canada, which has no parallel in Australia.
In both countries, the nations' largest city is not its capital city, however they are capitals of the regions they are located in. In Canada, Toronto is the largest city and provincial capital of Ontario, while in Australia, Sydney is the largest city and state capital of New South Wales. Ottawa is the capital of Canada and Canberra is the capital of Australia.
Federalism.
Unlike the United Kingdom, both Australia and Canada cover huge and sparsely populated territories. Canada is divided into provinces (the nomenclature 'province' originating from Canada's origins as "New France" a "province" of the Kingdom of France). Canada's founding document, the British North America Act of 1867 created a powerful federal government with weak provinces. However, over time Canada has become progressively more decentralized. The Australian constitution of 1901 united the disparate Crown colonies under a weak central government which was influenced more strongly by United States federalism, but one that has grown more powerful over time at the expense of the states. Neither country had a bill of rights at first, although Canada adopted a statutory charter of rights in 1960 and a constitutional charter, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, in 1982. The leader of a Canadian province is called a premier, a term adapted in Australia from Canada, in order not to confuse provincial leaders (in Canada) and state leaders, also called premiers (in Australia), from the national prime minister.
Both nations also have territories; these are areas with smaller populations whose governments have almost all of the responsibilities of state/provincial governments, but are fully under the control of the federal government.
Both have internal territories, but Australia, unlike Canada, has a number of external territories, small islands in the Pacific, Indian and Southern Oceans. Australia also claims the largest portion of the Antarctic mainland, although this claim is not recognized internationally, whereas Canada claims in the Arctic include the Queen Elizabeth Islands (which are accepted as Canadian territory) and the waters of the Northwest Passage (which are disputed).
States and provinces.
The Crown is represented in Australian states by a Governor, and in Canadian provinces by a Lieutenant-Governor. The appointed head of government, usually the leader of the party that commands a majority in the Legislative Assembly, is called the Premier in both Australia and Canada. In this case, Australia borrowed the Canadian term and usage of Premier in order to not confuse provincial/state leaders from the national prime minister. In all Australian states except Queensland, the state parliament is bicameral with a lower and upper house. The self-governing territories are unicameral. All of the Canadian provinces' parliaments are now unicameral, Quebec being the last province to abolish its upper house in 1968.
The Governors of the Australian states are appointed directly by the Sovereign, on the advice of the Premier of that state. In contrast, the Lieutenant Governor of a Canadian province is appointed by the Governor General of Canada, acting on the advice of the federal Prime Minister; his or her salary is paid by the federal government. By loose convention, the Canadian Prime Minister is expected to consult with the respective provincial Premier prior to selecting a Lieutenant Governor, but he or she is under no obligation to do so. The Canadian Prime Minister could also advise the dismissal of a Lieutenant Governor at any time. These distinctions are significant, as they effectively leave the considerable vice-regal reserve powers over the Canadian provinces in the hands of the federal government. In the early years of Confederation, these powers were used on five occasions to dismiss provincial governments outright, although the last such use of the vice-regal reserve powers was in 1904.
Under the Constitution of Australia, any residual powers are left to the states, while the Constitution of Canada leaves residual powers in the hands of the federal government. (Residual powers refer to powers not initially specifically commanded by either federal or state government because they are not crucial to addressing the problem of administrating a small population in a number of separate colonies over a large geographical area, for example, the delivery of education). The reason for this discrepancy has its origins in the differing circumstances of Confederation (Canada) and Federation (Australia). In 1867 Canada faced a significant military threat from the United States, and many British and Canadian politicians blamed the concept of states rights for helping to trigger the then-recent American Civil War. Australia in 1901 did not face a similar military threat and its politicians were thus more comfortable in leaving residual powers with the states. Furthermore, rivalry existed between the states of Victoria and New South Wales, and the remaining states, which were significantly less populous at that time, feared that a strong central Government would see too much power and influence wielded by Sydney and Melbourne. As such, the Australian states wanted to be explicitly granted wide powers in their own right.
Yet despite these constitutional differences, or perhaps because of them, the powers of Australian state governments are now far "weaker" than provincial governments in Canada, which still have considerable powers over both income and sales taxes. Australian state governments receive the vast majority of their income through block grants from the federal government in Canberra, and this lack of financial independence has led to a gradual erosion of state power. This situation has led to a claim that Australia is "over-governed", and some politicians have called for the outright abolition of the states, with powers to be instead divided between national and local (or regional) tiers of government. However, the states retain considerable power and influence and there is no practical likelihood of their abolition. Proposals to abolish the Canadian provinces, although not non-existent, are very unusual.
For example, under Section 51 of the Australian Constitution, the Australian federal government has concurrent but primary (i.e. Federal Tax is Paid before state tax) power to excise income tax, so as to, as stated, not discriminate between any State or a part of any State. This was deemed necessary due to the large population discrepancy between States. (Australia's largest state, New South Wales numbers 7.3 million people, while its smallest, Tasmania numbers just 0.5 million people in 2010). The same paradigm has applied to the more recently applied Goods And Services Tax, which is collected in Australia by the federal government and re-distributed to the states as block grants, with most of the states sometimes complaining they have been short-changed. Another example was the High Court challenge in 2006 by certain States to the Howard Government applying Section 51 of the Australian Constitution relating to the corporations power in order to enforce federal legislation, where the federal government argued it had power to control virtually any incorporated body, including private hospitals, schools, public universities, local governments etc. The High Court affirmed the Federal Government's right to this power, thereby further very much weakening the powers of Australian state governments
Many areas of responsibility that are jointly exercised by federal and state governments in Australia, such as education, are the sole responsibility of provincial governments in Canada. Therefore Canada does not have a federal department or minister for education. Australian states do have some powers that the Canadian provinces do not – most notably, each Australian state enacts and amends its own criminal code while Canada has a uniform Criminal Code under federal jurisdiction. Most Australian states have their own police force which enforce state laws whereas Canada have a mixture of local police forces and the federal police agency; Royal Canadian Mounted Police. All provinces had abolished the provincial police except Ontario, Quebec and Newfoundland which still have their own provincial police forces.
Canadian Fathers of Confederation such as Sir John A. Macdonald did not intend to have provinces that were nearly as powerful as they have become. Strong provincial governments would only become entrenched when Britain's Judicial Committee of the Privy Council ruled jurisdictional disputes consistently in favour of the provinces starting in the 1870s. Another complicating factor in Canada is that the government of Quebec has gained control over immigration and other matters, which are not the responsibility of provinces in the rest of Canada. The existence of a powerful independence movement in Quebec has also been cited as a reason why the provinces in Canada have gained and maintained more jurisdiction than they were intended to have at Confederation.
Parliament.
The executive is all but identical with the British heritage of cabinet government kept intact, with the Prime Minister being the leader of the largest party in the Australian House of Representatives or Canadian House of Commons. In both countries, MPs represent single member constituencies, known as divisions in Australia and ridings in Canada.
Unlike Canada, which uses the first-past-the-post voting system, Australia uses instant runoff voting (known in Australia as preferential voting) for almost all lower house elections and proportional representation for almost all upper house elections.
Australia has also introduced compulsory voting, something Canada has not done. There is no political pressure to introduce such a measure in Canada, although poor electoral turnouts in the past three elections are beginning to make Canadians seriously consider some sort of electoral reform (while no major party wants mandatory voting, the New Democratic Party's platform indicates that they wish to lower the voting age to 16, something that reduced voter apathy in Brazil).
Canada and Australia both have strong multiparty systems with many parties represented in their legislatures as opposed to two (as in the United States). At the federal level, however, Canada's House of Commons tends to be more diverse than the Senate, while in Australia the reverse situation applies. This reflects the different means by which Members of Parliament are selected.
While both Canada and Australia have bicameral parliamentary systems, the composition of the upper house or Senate differs in each country. The Australian Senate is elected by single transferable vote, while the Canadian Senate is appointed by the Governor-General under the advice of Prime Minister. In Australia, each state has equal representation in the Senate, while in Canada, Senate seats are distributed between the "regions" of the country, not "provinces". The Australian Senate also has great power to block money bills, unlike the weaker Canadian Senate, which it used in 1975, resulting in the constitutional crisis.
Since the 1990s, all Canadian parties elected to parliament with the exception of the Liberals have suggested some kind of reform of the Senate. Many politicians in the western provinces, such as Preston Manning of the (now defunct) Reform Party have advocated an Australian style, or 'Triple-E Senate – elected, equally representative of all regions, and effective, while others, such as the NDP and the Bloc Québécois call for outright abolition. Efforts for an elected Senate with term limits are currently underway by the governing Conservative Party. In a recent address to the Australian Parliament, in which he praised the country's elected Senate Prime Minister Stephen Harper stated that "Canadians understand that our Senate, as it stands today, must either change or – like the old upper houses of our provinces – vanish.". By contrast, while former Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating described the Senate as an 'unrepresentative swill', proposals for reform have focused on its ability to block legislation rather than its existence or composition.
Australian Ministers and Deputy Ministers are professional elected politicians whereas Canadian Ministers are elected politicians and Deputy Ministers are the appointed professional senior servant of the bureaucracy. The Australian equivalent is the Director General in most states and in Canberra and Victoria is the Secretary of department.
Judiciary.
The nations share a very similar judicial system based on British common law (except for civil matters in Quebec, where a French-style civil code applies). The highest courts of both nations are now domestic, with Canada doing away with appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in 1949 and Australia doing the same in 1986.
However, the use by the Canadian federal courts of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms has begun to impact Canadian society in such matters as same-sex marriages and abortion. Australia has not enshrined similar measures.
Monarchy.
Elizabeth II is the monarch of both Australia and Canada, though her positions as Queen of Canada and Queen of Australia are legally separate; Elizabeth II cannot be advised on national affairs by anyone other than her ministers in the appropriate country, and when acting internally or abroad on the advice of said ministers, she does so as Queen of Canada or Queen of Australia, not as Queen of the United Kingdom. At the federal level, the Queen is represented in Canada by the Governor General (no hyphen), and in Australia by the Governor-General (hyphenated).
Canada discontinued the awarding of British honours to its citizens, establishing the Order of Canada in 1967, earlier than Australia, which introduced its own Order of Australia in 1975, and did not end the awarding of British honours until 1993. The Canadian monarch and Australian monarch, respectively, is sovereign of all Canadian and Australian national honours.
Polls in both countries over previous decades have shown shifts in the popularity of the monarchy, although to date, only Australia has held a national referendum on moving to a republican form of government, in 1999. Although some Canadian politicians, such as John Manley (described as "Canada's Paul Keating") have expressed support for ending the monarchy, it is not the policy of any of the three main federal parties.
Owing to the federal nature of both countries' constitutions, any constitutional change regarding the monarchy would require the consent of each country's states or provinces. In Australia, such a change requires both a majority of those voting throughout the country, and separate majorities in a majority of the states, and the complete abolition of the monarchy would require constitutional reform in each state. In Canada changes to the monarchy require the assent of every province's legislature as well as a majority in the Senate and House of Commons, unlike the usual amending formula which requires the approval of only seven out of ten provinces representing at least 50% of the population. In 1931, King George V appointed the first Australian-born person as Governor-General; Canada did not have a Canadian-born Governor General until 1953.
Health care.
Australia and Canada both tend to fall somewhere in the middle between the United States and Europe in the extent to which the government either provides or subsidizes health care services. In both countries the responsibility for health care is split between federal and provincial/state governments. Similarly, in both countries, services are provided by a combination of public and private institutions. Australia and Canada differ to some extent however on the role of health insurance. Canada implements restrictions on the role of private health insurance for publicly insured services whereas Australia implements a regulated system of private and public finance in parallel.
Australia provides a non-contributory (i.e., income tax based) universal health care scheme called Medicare, which allows people with a Medicare card to see private doctors, receive care in public hospitals and receive certain other health services (for example, up to 12 sessions with a qualified psychologist when referred by a GP) without having to pay fees directly. Instead, Australian taxpayers pay a levy of 1.5% on top of their income tax to help fund government administered health care. People on high incomes pay a 1% surcharge on top of this levy and people on low incomes qualify for a reduction or a waiver of the levy depending on income. Australia also has a Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) which means the consumer and the state make co-payments on most prescribed medicines. In 2009, a purchaser of a prescribed medicine under the PBS paid a maximum of A$32.90 per prescription, with concessional consumers holding a Health Care Card, (i.e. clients receiving most forms of government pension, including unemployment benefits) paying a maximum of $5.30 per script, up to an annual maximum of A$1,264.90 for general clients and A$318.00 for concessional clients annual, after which all medicines are given free.
War and peace.
Neither Canada nor Australia has been to war on its own; rather, they have fought as part of coalitions. The two nations are the most commonly cited examples of middle powers – states that try to pursue their interests through multilateralism and collective security because they are not large enough to act unilaterally.
Canada was founded in part because of threats of American invasion. The War of 1812 was a strong uniting force in Canada and sparked the creation of an independent federal state.
Both Australia and Canada were immediately called to the defence of Britain in World War I. While Australia suffered larger per capita casualties, the armies from the two dominions were acknowledged as the best of the Commonwealth army, and both nations won prestige and greater independence in the war in Europe. Both Australia and Canada emerged divided from the war because of similar crises concerning conscription, which in Australia set Anglo-Saxon Protestants against Catholics of Irish stock, and in Canada French-Canadians against English Canadians.
The Second World War was similar in regards to both nations again springing to the defence of Britain. Unlike Australia, Canada's political fabric was divided by the war – again for similar reasons in the Conscription Crisis of 1944. Conscription was not a major issue in Australia as the country was attacked by Japanese bombers. Although a Japanese attack of North America was feared by many, Australia faced what was perceived to be a far more dire threat from the Japanese Empire. While Quebec emerged from the troubles as a more distinct entity from the rest of Canada, the governments handling of the crisis lead to a release of tensions within only months.
The beginning of the Cold War saw both sides align with the United States: Canada being a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and Australia signing the ANZUS treaty. Both nations sent troops to the Korean War on the UN side who fought together as part of the Commonwealth Brigade.
From that point on, however, the pattern seems to have diverged as Australia joined the United States in Vietnam and in the 2003 Invasion of Iraq—two conflicts that Canada was not involved in. This may hypothetically be accredited to differing strategic dilemmas of respective governments at the time the conflicts began. If the Conservatives had been in power in Canada in 2003, that nation may have joined the war in Iraq. If the Australian Labor Party had been in office, that country may very well have not gone to war, although this remains inconclusive considering the involvement of the British centre-left party and comments made by former Labor leader Kim Beazley.

Galactic Crusader

Galactic Crusader is a 1990 shooter video game released in January for the NES.
Gameplay.
The game is a top-down perspective shooter, often compared to the popular space shooter "Galaga". The player progresses through numerous stages, using missiles and lasers to shoot oncoming enemies. One notable difference from "Galaga" is Galactic Crusaders many bosses which the player confronts at the end of each level- often taking many hits to defeat.

MHealth

mHealth (also written as m-health) is an abbreviation for mobile health, a term used for the practice of medicine and public health supported by mobile devices. The term is most commonly used in reference to using mobile communication devices, such as mobile phones, tablet computers and PDAs, for health services and information, but also to affect emotional states. The mHealth field has emerged as a sub-segment of eHealth, the use of information and communication technology (ICT), such as computers, mobile phones, communications satellite, patient monitors, etc., for health services and information. mHealth applications include the use of mobile devices in collecting community and clinical health data, delivery of healthcare information to practitioners, researchers, and patients, real-time monitoring of patient vital signs, and direct provision of care (via mobile telemedicine).
While mHealth certainly has application for industrialized nations, the field has emerged in recent years as largely an application for developing countries, stemming from the rapid rise of mobile phone penetration in low-income nations. The field, then, largely emerges as a means of providing greater access to larger segments of a population in developing countries, as well as improving the capacity of health systems in such countries to provide quality healthcare.
Within the mHealth space, projects operate with a variety of objectives, including increased access to healthcare and health-related information (particularly for hard-to-reach populations); improved ability to diagnose and track diseases; timelier, more actionable public health information; and expanded access to ongoing medical education and training for health workers.
According to the analyst firm Berg Insight, around 2.8 million patients worldwide were using a home monitoring service based on equipment with integrated connectivity at the end of 2012. The figure does not include patients that use monitoring devices connected to a PC or mobile phone. It only includes systems that rely on monitors with integrated connectivity or systems that use monitoring hubs with integrated cellular or fixed-line modems. Berg Insight forecasts that the number of home monitoring systems with integrated communication capabilities will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 26.9 percent between 2011 and 2017 reaching 9.4 million connections globally by the end of the forecast period. The number of these devices that have integrated cellular connectivity increased from 0.73 million in 2011 to about 1.03 million in 2012, and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 46.3 percent to 7.10 million in 2017.
Definitions.
mHealth broadly encompasses the use of mobile telecommunication and multimedia technologies as they are integrated within increasingly mobile and wireless health care delivery systems.The field broadly encompasses the use of mobile telecommunication and multimedia technologies in health care delivery. The term mHealth was coined by Robert Istepanian as use of "emerging mobile communications and network technologies for healthcare".
A definition used at the 2010 mHealth Summit of the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH) was "the delivery of healthcare services via mobile communication devices".
While there are some projects that are considered solely within the field of mHealth, the linkage between mHealth and eHealth is unquestionable. For example, an mHealth project that uses mobile phones to access data on HIV/AIDS rates would require an eHealth system in order to manage, store, and assess the data. Thus, eHealth projects many times operate as the backbone of mHealth projects.
In a similar vein, while not clearly bifurcated by such a definition, eHealth can largely be viewed as technology that supports the functions and delivery of healthcare, while mHealth rests largely on providing healthcare access. Because mHealth is by definition based on mobile technology such as smartphones, healthcare, through information and delivery, can better reach areas, people, and/or healthcare practitioners with previously limited exposure to certain aspects of healthcare.
Motivation of mHealth.
mHealth is one aspect of eHealth that is pushing the limits of how to acquire, transport, store, process, and secure the raw and processed data to deliver meaningful results. mHealth offers the ability of remote individuals to participate in the health care value matrix, which may not have been possible in the past. Participation does not imply just consumption of health care services. In many cases remote users are valuable contributors to gather data regarding disease and public health concerns such as outdoor pollution, drugs and violence.
The motivation behind the development of the mHealth field arises from two factors. The first factor concerns the myriad constraints felt by healthcare systems of developing nations. These constraints include high population growth, a high burden of disease prevalence, low health care workforce, large numbers of rural inhabitants, and limited financial resources to support healthcare infrastructure and health information systems. The second factor is the recent rapid rise in mobile phone penetration in developing countries to large segments of the healthcare workforce, as well as the population of a country as a whole. With greater access to mobile phones to all segments of a country, including rural areas, the potential of lowering information and transaction costs in order to deliver healthcare improves.
The combination of these two factors have motivated much discussion of how greater access to mobile phone technology can be leveraged to mitigate the numerous pressures faced by developing countries' healthcare systems. Both factors are discussed here.
Healthcare and mHealth in low- and middle-income countries.
[[File:All Causes world map - DALY - WHO2004.svg|thumb|Disability-adjusted life year for all causes per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004.
Middle income and especially low-income countries face a plethora of constraints in their healthcare systems. These countries face a severe lack of human and physical resources, as well as some of the largest burdens of disease, extreme poverty, and large population growth rates. Additionally, healthcare access to all reaches of society is generally low in these countries.
According to a World Health Organization (WHO) report from June 2011, higher-income countries show more mHealth activity than do lower-income countries (as consistent with eHealth trends in general). Countries in the European Region are currently the most active and those in the African Region the least active. The WHO report findings also included that mHealth is most easily incorporated into processes and services that historically use voice communication through conventional telephone networks. The report was the result of a mHealth survey module designed by researchers at the Earth Institute's [http://cghed.ei.columbia.edu/ Center for Global Health and Economic Development, Columbia University.
The WHO notes an extreme deficit within the global healthcare workforce. The WHO notes critical healthcare workforce shortages in 57 countries—most of which are characterized as developing countries—and a global deficit of 2.4 million doctors, nurses, and midwives. The WHO, in a study of the healthcare workforce in 12 countries of Africa, finds an average density of physicians, nurses and midwives per 1000 population of 0.64. The density of the same metric is four times as high in the United States, at 2.6.
The burden of disease is additionally much higher in low- and middle-income countries than high-income countries. The burden of disease, measured in disability-adjusted life year (DALY), which can be thought of as a measurement of the gap between current health status and an ideal situation where everyone lives into old age, free of disease and disability, is about five times higher in Africa than in high-income countries. In addition, low- and middle-income countries are forced to face the burdens of both extreme poverty and the growing incidence of chronic diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease, an effect of new-found (relative) affluence.
Considering poor infrastructure and low human resources, the WHO notes that the healthcare workforce in sub-Saharan Africa would need to be scaled up by as much as 140% to attain international health development targets such as those in the Millennium Declaration.
The WHO, in reference to the healthcare condition in sub-saharan Africa, states:
The problem is so serious that in many instances there is simply not enough human capacity even to absorb, deploy and efficiently use the substantial additional funds that are considered necessary to improve health in these countries.
Mobile technology has made a recent and rapid appearance into low- and middle-income nations. While, in the mHealth field, mobile technology usually refers to mobile phone technology, the entrance of other technologies into these nations to facilitate healthcare are also discussed here.
Health and development.
The link between health and development can be found in three of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), as set forth by the United Nations Millennium Declaration in 2000. The MDGs that specifically address health include reducing child mortality; improving maternal health; combating HIV and AIDS, malaria, and other diseases; and increasing access to safe drinking water. A progress report published in 2006 indicates that childhood immunization and deliveries by skilled birth attendants are on the rise, while many regions continue to struggle to achieve reductions in the prevalence of the diseases of poverty including malaria, HIV and AIDS and tuberculosis.
Healthcare and mHealth in developed countries.
In developed countries, healthcare systems have different policies and goals in relation to the personal and population health care goals.
In US and EU many patients and consumers use their cell phones and tablets to access health information and look for healthcare services. In parallel the number of mHealth applications grew significantly the last years.
Doctors, nurses and clinicians use mobile devices to access patient information and other databases and resources.
Technology and market.
Basic SMS functions and real-time voice communication serve as the backbone and the current most common use of mobile phone technology. The broad range of potential benefits to the health sector that the simple functions of mobile phones can provide should not be understated.
The appeal of mobile communication technologies is that they enable communication in motion, allowing individuals to contact each other irrespective of time and place. This is particularly beneficial for work in remote areas where the mobile phone, and now increasingly wireless infrastructure, is able to reach more people, faster. As a result of such technological advances, the capacity for improved access to information and two-way communication becomes more available at the point of need.
Mobile phones.
Mobile phones have made a recent and rapid entrance into many parts of the low- and middle-income world, with the global Mobile phone penetration rate drastically increasing over the last decade. Improvements in telecommunications technology infrastructure, reduced costs of mobile handsets, and a general increase in non-food expenditure have influenced this trend. Low- and middle-income countries are utilizing mobile phones as "leapfrog technology" (see leapfrogging). That is, mobile phones have allowed many developing countries, even those with relatively poor infrastructure, to bypass 20th century fixed-line technology and jump to modern mobile technology.
The number of global mobile phone subscribers in 2007 was estimated at 3.1 billion of an estimated global population of 6.6 billion (47%). These figures are expected to grow to 4.5 billion by 2012, or a 64.7% mobile penetration rate. The greatest growth is expected in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. In many countries, the number of mobile phone subscribers has bypassed the number of fixed-line telephones, this is particularly true in developing countries. Globally, there were 4.1 billion mobile phones in use in December 2008 . See List of countries by number of mobile phones in use.
While mobile phone penetration rates are on the rise, globally, the growth within countries is not generally evenly distributed. In India, for example, while mobile penetration rates have increased markedly, by far the greatest growth rates are found in urban areas. Mobile penetration, in September 2008, was 66% in urban areas, while only 9.4% in rural areas. The all India average was 28.2% at the same time. So, while mobile phones may have the potential to provide greater healthcare access to a larger portion of a population, there are certainly within-country equity issues to consider.
Mobile phones are spreading because the cost of mobile technology deployment is dropping and people are, on average, getting wealthier in low- and middle-income nations. Vendors, such as Nokia, are developing cheaper infrastructure technologies (CDMA) and cheaper phones (sub $50–100, such as Sun's Java phone). Non-food consumption expenditure is increasing in many parts of the developing world, as disposable income rises, causing a rapid increase spending on new technology, such as mobile phones. In India, for example, consumers have become and continue to become wealthier. Consumers are shifting their expenditure from necessity to discretionary. For example, on average, 56% of Indian consumers' consumption went towards food in 1995, compared to 42% in 2005. The number is expected to drop to 34% by 2015. That being said, although total share of consumption has declined, total consumption of food and beverages increased 82% from 1985 to 2005, while per-capita consumption of food and beverages increased 24%. Indian consumers are getting wealthier and they are spending more and more, with a greater ability to spend on new technologies.
Smartphones.
More advanced mobile phone technologies are enabling the potential for further healthcare delivery. Smartphone technologies are now in the hands of a large number of physicians and other healthcare workers in low- and middle-income countries. Although far from ubiquitous, the spread of Smartphone technologies opens up doors for mHealth projects such as technology-based diagnosis support, remote diagnostics and telemedicine, web browsing, GPS navigation, access to web-based patient information, post-visit patient surveillance, and decentralized health management information systems (HMIS).
While uptake of Smartphone technology by the medical field has grown in low- and middle-income countries, it is worth noting that the capabilities of mobile phones in low- and middle-income countries has not reached the sophistication of those in high-income countries. The infrastructure that enables web browsing, GPS navigation, and email through Smartphones is not as well developed in much of the low- and middle-income countries. Increased availability and efficiency in both voice and data-transfer systems in addition to rapid deployment of wireless infrastructure will likely accelerate the deployment of mobile-enabled health systems and services throughout the world.
Other mHealth technologies.
Beyond mobile phones, wireless-enabled laptops and specialized health-related software applications are currently being developed, tested, and marketed for use in the mHealth field. Many of these technologies, while having some application to low- and middle-income nations, are developing primarily in high-income countries. However, with broad advocacy campaigns for free and open source software (FOSS), applications are beginning to be tailored for and make inroads in low- and middle-income countries.
Some other mHealth technologies include
Mobile Device Operating System Technology
Technologies relates to the Operating Systems that orchestrate mobile device hardware while maintaining confidentiality, integrity and availability are required to build trust. This may foster greater adoption of mHealth Technologies and Services, by exploiting lower cost multi purpose mobile devices such as tablets pcs and smart phones. Devices in this class may include Apple's iPad 1&2 and Motorola's Xoom. Operating systems that control these emerging classes of devices include Google's Android, Apple's iPhone OS, Microsoft's Windows Mobile, Nokia Symbian OS and RIM's BlackBerry OS.
Operating Systems must be agile and evolve to effectively balance and deliver the desired level of service to an application and end user, while managing display real estate, power consumption and security posture. As advances in capabilities such as integrating voice, video and Web 2.0 collaboration tools into mobile devices, significant benefits can be achieved in the delivery of health care services. New sensor technologies such as HD video and audio capabilities, accelerometers, GPS, ambient light detectors, barometers and gyroscopes can enhance the methods of describing and studying cases, close to the patient or consumer of the health care service. This could include diagnosis, education, treatment and monitoring.
Air Quality Sensing Technologies
Environmental conditions have a significant impact to public health. Per the World Health Organization, outdoor air pollution accounts for about 1.4% of total mortality. Utilizing Participatory sensing technologies in mobile telephone, public health research can exploit the wide penetration of mobile devices to collect air measurements, which can be utilized to assess the impact of pollution. Projects such as the Urban Atmospheres are utilizing embedded technologies in mobile phones to acquire real time conditions from millions of user mobile phones. By aggregating this data, public health policy shall be able to craft initiatives to mitigate risk associated with outdoor air pollution.
Data has become an especially important aspect of mHealth. Data collection requires both the collection device (mobile phones, computer, or portable device) and the software that houses the information. Data is primarily focused on visualizing static text but can also extend to interactive decision support algorithms, other visual image information, and also communication capabilities through the integration of e-mail and SMS features. Integrating use of GIS and GPS with mobile technologies adds a geographical mapping component that is able to "tag" voice and data communication to a particular location or series of locations. These combined capabilities have been used for emergency health services as well as for disease surveillance, health facilities and services mapping, and other health-related data collection.
mHealth and health outcomes.
The mHealth field operates on the premise that technology integration within the health sector has the great potential to promote a better health communication to achieve healthy lifestyles, improve decision-making by health professionals (and patients) and enhance healthcare quality by improving access to medical and health information and facilitating instantaneous communication in places where this was not previously possible. It follows that the increased use of technology can help reduce health care costs by improving efficiencies in the health care system and promoting prevention through behavior change communication (BCC). The mHealth field also houses the idea that there exists a powerful potential to advance clinical care and public health services by facilitating health professional practice and communication and reducing health disparities through the use of mobile technology.
The growth of health-related Apps and the availability of mobile device drives the growth of mHealth.In 2010, only about 4,000 health-related app available and now more than 20,000 health-related apps are available for mobile device. Revenues from remote patient monitoring services that use mobile networks will rise to $1.9 billion globally by 2014, according to Juniper Research’s recent report in 2011.
Efforts are ongoing to explore how a broad range of technologies, and most recently mHealth technologies, can improve such health outcomes as well as generate cost savings within the health systems of low- and middle-income countries. In some ways, the potential of mHealth lies in its ability to offer opportunities for direct voice communication (of particular value in areas of poor literacy rates and limited local language-enable phones) and information transfer capabilities that previous technologies did not have. Overall, mobile communication technologies are tools that can be leveraged to support existing workflows within the health sector and between the health sector and the general public.
Within the mHealth space, projects operate with a variety of objectives, as stated by the UN Foundation and Vodafone Foundation's report on "mHealth for Development":
Applications in the mHealth field.
While others exist, the UN Foundation and Vodafone Foundation report presents seven application categories within the mHealth field.
Each application category as well as specific project within the category will be described.
Education and awareness.
Education and awareness programs within the mHealth field are largely about the spreading of mass information from source to recipient through short message services (SMS). In education and awareness applications, SMS messages are sent directly to users' phones to offer information about various subjects, including testing and treatment methods, availability of health services, and disease management. SMSs provide an advantage of being relatively unobtrusive, offering patients confidentiality in environments where disease (especially HIV/AIDS) is often taboo. Additionally, SMSs provide an avenue to reach far-reaching areas—such as rural areas—which may have limited access to public health information and education, health clinics, and a deficit of healthcare workers.
Helpline.
Helpline typically consists of a specific phone number that any individual is able to call to gain access to a range of medical services. These include phone consultations, counseling, service complaints, and information on facilities, drugs, equipment, and/or available mobile health clinics
Diagnostic support, treatment support, communication and training for healthcare workers.
Diagnostic and treatment support systems are typically designed to provide healthcare workers in remote areas advice about diagnosis and treatment of patients. While some projects may provide mobile phone applications—such as a step-by-step medical decision tree systems—to help healthcare workers diagnosis, other projects provide direct diagnosis to patients themselves. In such cases, known as telemedicine, patients might take a photograph of a wound or illness and allow a remote physician diagnose to help treat the medical problem. Both diagnosis and treatment support projects attempt to mitigate the cost and time of travel for patients located in remote areas
mHealth projects within the communication and training for healthcare workers subset involve connecting healthcare workers to sources of information through their mobile phone. This involves connecting healthcare workers to other healthcare workers, medical institutions, ministries of health, or other houses of medical information. Such projects additionally involve using mobile phones to better organize and target in-person training. Improved communication projects attempt to increase knowledge transfer amongst healthcare workers and improve patient outcomes through such programs as patient referral processes
Disease surveillance, remote data collection, and epidemic outbreak tracking.
Projects within this area operate to utilize mobile phones' ability to collect and transmit data quickly, cheaply, and relatively efficiently. Data concerning the location and levels of specific diseases (such as malaria, HIV/AIDS, TB, Avian Flu) can help medical systems or ministries of health or other organizations identify outbreaks and better target medical resources to areas of greatest need. Such projects can be particularly useful during emergencies, in order to identify where the greatest medical needs are within a country
Policymakers and health providers at the national, district, and community level need accurate data in order to gauge the effectiveness of existing policies and programs and shape new ones. In the developing world, collecting field information is particularly difficult since many segments of the population are rarely able to visit a hospital, even in the case of severe illness. A lack of patient data creates an arduous environment in which policy makers can decide where and how to spend their (sometimes limited) resources. While some software within this area is specific to a particular content or area, other software can be adapted to any data collection purpose.
Treatment support and medication compliance for patients, including chronic disease management.
Remote monitoring and treatment support allows for greater involvement in the continued care of patients. Recent studies seem to show also the efficacy of inducing positive and negative affective states, using smart phones. Within environments of limited resources and beds—and subsequently a 'outpatient' culture—remote monitoring allows healthcare workers to better track patient conditions, medication regimen adherence, and follow-up scheduling. Such projects can operate through either one- or two-way communications systems. Remote monitoring has been used particularly in the area of medication adherence for AIDS and diabetes; technical process evaluations have confirmed the feasibility of deploying dynamically tailored, SMS-based interventions designed to provide ongoing behavioral reinforcement for persons living with HIV.
Emerging trends and areas of interest in mHealth.
According to Vodafone Group Foundation on February 13, 2008, a partnership for emergency communications was created between the group and United Nations Foundation. Such partnership will increase the effectiveness of the information and communications technology response to major emergencies and disasters around the world.

Henry Lehman

Henry Lehman (born Hayum Lehmann; c. 1822 – November 17, 1855) was a German-born American businessman and the founder of Lehman Brothers financial services, which declared bankruptcy in 2008.
Biography.
Lehman was born to a Jewish family, the son of Abraham Lehmann, a cattle merchant in the small Franconian town of Rimpar near Würzburg, Lehman emigrated to the United States in 1844, where he changed his name to Henry Lehman. He settled in Montgomery, Alabama, and opened a dry goods store named, "H. Lehman". In 1847, following the arrival of his younger brother Emanuel Lehman, the firm became, "H. Lehman and Bro." With the 1850 arrival of Mayer Lehman, the youngest brother, the firm became "Lehman Brothers".
In those years, cotton was the most important crop of the Southern United States. Capitalizing on cotton's extremely high market value around the world, the Lehman brothers became cotton factors, accepting cotton bales from customers as payment for their merchandise. They eventually began a second business as traders in cotton. Within a few years, this became the major part of their firm.
In 1855, Henry Lehman died from yellow fever while travelling in New Orleans. Later, his brothers moved the company's headquarters to New York City, eventually building it into an important American investment bank, which was in operation for over 150 years until its September 15, 2008 collapse.

2008–09 Celtic F.C. season

The 2008–09 season was the 120th season of competitive football by Celtic.
Overview.
Celtic went into the 2008–09 season defending their Scottish Premier League title, which they won for the third consecutive time in 2007–08.
They also entered the UEFA Champions League directly at the group stage, as well as taking part in the two domestic cup competitions, the Scottish Cup and the Scottish League Cup.
To prepare for the Season, Celtic took part in two Pre-Season Tournaments; the Algarve Challenge Cup in Faro, Portugal, where they finished bottom, having faced Middlesbrough and Cardiff City, and the Feyenoord Jubilee Tournament in Rotterdam, where they finished second, having faced Tottenham Hotspur and host club Feyenoord.
The campaign.
League campaign.
The Championship flag was unfurled before Celtic's first League game, against St. Mirren at Celtic Park on 10 August by Rosemary Burns, the widow of former Celtic player Tommy Burns, who had died of skin cancer at the end of season 2007–08. Celtic won the game 1–0, through a Barry Robson penalty, getting their Campaign off to a winning start. 
Celtic finished second in the SPL table at the end of the season, eventually finishing four points behind champions Rangers. This was despite at one point having built up a seven-point lead over Rangers. This lead was squandered though, Celtic dropping points to Dundee United, Inverness Caledonian Thistle, Motherwell, Rangers themselves, and on two occasions to both Hibernian and Hearts.
One day after the final league game of the season, a 0–0 draw with Hearts at Celtic Park, it was announced that Gordon Strachan would leave as manager of Celtic with immediate effect. This brought to an end Strachan's four-year spell as manager, during which he guided the club to three SPL titles, one Scottish Cup and two Scottish League Cups. He also guided the club twice into the last 16 of the Champions League, losing out to A.C. Milan and Barcelona respectively.
European campaign.
Celtic, as Scottish champions, qualified directly for the UEFA Champions League, where they were the sole Scottish side as Rangers were knocked out in the second qualifying round by FBK Kaunas, meaning Celtic received all the TV money allocated to Scotland.
Celtic were in Pot 3 for the group stage draw, which took place in Monaco on 28 August. They were drawn with Manchester United, Villarreal and Aalborg. The first game, a home tie against Aalborg, finished in a goalless draw. The next game, away to Villarreal ended in a 1–0 defeat, which was followed by a 3–0 defeat away to Manchester United. Next up, at home, Celtic drew 1–1 with Manchester United, with Scott McDonald putting Celtic in the lead in the 13th minute, only for Ryan Giggs to equalise for Manchester United in the 84th minute. A disappointing 2–1 defeat to Aalborg in Denmark saw Celtic's European aspirations end, despite having taken the lead through Barry Robson. Nonetheless, Celtic rallied to end their campaign on a high with a 2–0 victory over Villarreal at Celtic Park.
Domestic cups.
Celtic entered the Scottish League Cup at the third round proper (the last 16 stage) and the Scottish Cup at the fourth round proper (the Round of 32). The club beat Livingston 4–0 in the third round of the League Cup on 23 September, and travelled to Kilmarnock on 28 October, beating them 3–1 and qualifying for the semi-finals, where they faced Dundee United at Hampden Park on 28 January. After a 0–0 draw in extra time, Celtic won a penalty shoot-out 11-10 to set up a final against Rangers on 15 March. The teaam won the 2009 Scottish League Cup Final 2–0 aet at Hampden, with Darren O'Dea and Aiden McGeady getting the goals.
The fourth round of the Scottish Cup took place on 10 January, with Celtic beating Dundee at Celtic Park. In the fifth round, Celtic hosted Queen's Park on 7 February, beating them 2-1. In the quarter-finals, Celtic lost 1–0 at St Mirren on 7 March.

Comic book letter column

A comic book letter column is a section of a comic book where readers' letters to the publisher appear. Comic book letter columns are also commonly referred to as letter columns (or lettercols), letter pages, letters of comment (LOCs), or simply letters to the editor. Letter columns appeared early on in the history of comic books themselves, and their growing prevalence — particularly beginning in the 1960s — helped create and legitimatize comics fandom. Letter columns remained a regular feature of most comic books until the early years of the 21st century, when they were gradually phased out in favor of the growing prevalence of E-mail and Internet fora.
History.
Although they were already standard in the science fiction magazines of the time, the first recorded comic book letter column appeared in "Target Comics" #6, published by Novelty Press in 1940. (The page in question also has an early mention of comic book collecting.) The first DC Comics comic to include a letters column was "Real Fact Comics" #3 (Jul-Aug 1946). The first DC title with a letters column as a regular feature was "Superman" beginning with issue #124 (September 1958).
Early versions of the lettercol tended to be simple fan letters, often from young readers. These letters tended to be praise for the previous issue's story and artwork; or simplistic questions about the correct pronunciation of "Mxyzptlk" or where Superman put his Clark Kent clothes when he was in costume; or alternately, obsessive dissections of perceived continuity errors or art mistakes.
Letter columns came into their prime in the 1960s, when readers' letters became longer and the discussions more sophisticated. For example, in the mid-1960s longtime letter writer (and future comics historian) Peter Sanderson's lengthy, well-reasoned, and impressively erudite missives forced DC editor Julie Schwartz to expand the lettercols in his books to a second, separate page (such as "Flash-Grams — Extra", "Letters To the Batcave — Extra", and "JLA Mailroom — Special Peter Sanderson Edition") to facilitate Sanderson's sharp analysis.
By the 1970s, nearly all mainstream comics included letter pages. Historian Matthew J. Pustz describes the different approaches of the two major publishers:
As the letter column became a longstanding tradition in the mainstream comic book industry, it even became a feature of underground, independent, and alternative comics of the 1970s and 80s. By the first few years of the 21st century, as comic-related forums sprang up all over the Internet, letter columns were gradually replaced by advertisements or in-house promotions. In 2002, DC officially ended the practice of the letter page. Ironically, many independent titles (such as Dark Horse's "Usagi Yojimbo" and "Hellboy", Drawn and Quarterly's "Optic Nerve" and "Palooka-ville", and the independently published "King-Cat Comics") still feature letters pages to this day.
In January 2011, DC announced it was bringing back letter columns to its monthly titles.
Form and content.
As standardized by the big mainstream American companies, the letter column was typically overseen by one of the comic’s staff members, often the book’s editor (or later on, the assistant editor), and occasionally the book’s writer(s).
The letters page was often used as a soapbox, where in addition to responding to reader comments, the editor would provide behind-the-scenes details about the comics world, announce changes to the title or the creative team, plea for more (or better) letters, needle the competition, and otherwise communicate with readers.
Due to the monthly (or longer) lag between issues, a comic’s letter column usually featured reader responses to issues about three-to-five months prior to the current one. Occasionally, if a story ran too long one month, or there were printer-related problems, a comic's letters page would be omitted that issue. This would often produce an outcry from deprived readers in later letter columns, accompanied by the requisite apologies and explanations.
Until the late-1970s, letter columns were usually found in the middle of the book, when they mostly moved to the book’s second-to-last page (the last page tending to be an advertisement).
Toward the end of 1960 — thanks in no small part to the urging of motivated readers like Jerry Bails (later to be known as the '"father of comics fandom") and Roy Thomas — DC editor Julius Schwartz decided to print readers' home addresses in the letters, a custom of long standing in science fiction magazines and one which helped originate science fiction fandom (where Schwartz himself got his start in publishing). The first letters page with the letter writers' full addresses appeared in "The Brave and the Bold" #35 (May 1961). Because of this practice, many readers connected with each other, becoming penpals, and starting communities of fans and/or publishing fanzines. In a number of cases, readers (including future "X-Men" artist Dave Cockrum) "met" their future spouses via a comic book letter page.
Peter Sanderson writes of Schwartz's letter columns:
Similarly, under the guidance of editor-in-chief/publisher Stan Lee, Marvel Comics also decided to print readers' home addresses in the letters. Lee made it a priority to create a community of readers, giving them a sense of personal investment in Marvel and its titles. Lee's ambition to create a company aesthetic in this way was overwhelming successful; many Marvel fans would sign off their letters with the phrase, "Make Mine Marvel!"
For many fans, having a letter printed was a badge of honor — especially if it was in one of the more high-profile letters pages. The feeling was that if one wrote enough good letters, it was possible to influence the direction of the comic and/or one's favorite characters. And as letters pages became more collaborative in this way, many became forums for long-running discussions among the editors and readers, with topics ranging from what defined a "mutant" to real-world issues such as religion, racism, feminism, gay rights, and the rights of the disabled. "Cerebus" creator Dave Sim's comments about women, for example, became the source of a particularly long-running and bitter debate in the pages of "Aardvark Comment".
In certain circumstances, it was practice for Marvel and DC to solicit letters for titles which had trouble filling a letters page each month. While popular titles could receive up to 40 or more letters per month, other titles might not receive enough to even fill a page. In desperate circumstances, DC and Marvel lettercol assemblers were even known to write fake letters under assumed names, just to fill out the column.
For some time in the 1970s, Marvel editors (and assistant editors, like Mark Gruenwald) responded to readers' letters in the guise of a "friendly armadillo." Beginning in 1980, under new editor-in-chief Jim Shooter, Marvel instituted new letter column policies. One change was to let writers of certain titles (rather than the book's editor) manage the letters pages. The other was to eliminate the conceit of the "armadillo" and have the books' editors or writers respond to letters under the own names.
In later years, some DC Comics letters pages — like those in "Lobo" and "Ambush Bug" — used the humorous device of having the main character "respond" to letters. Marvel's Deadpool, as part of his regular practice of breaking the "fourth wall," also answered his own letters.
The letters page also functioned as another form of "house ad," a place to promote the book, other books in the same line, or the comic book publishing company in general. Some had additional purposes such as in the 1980s "The Question" series, written by Dennis O'Neil, whose letters pages included a reading recommendation with each issue to complement the philosophical points illustrated in the feature story.
Letter column titles.
The typical letters page had its own title, which was usually a reference to the book’s hero or heroes. "Cape and Cowl Comments" ("World's Finest Comics"), "JLA Mailroom" ("Justice League of America"), "Legion Outpost" ("Legion of Super-Heroes"), "Metropolis Mailbag," ("Superman"), "Avengers Assemble!" ("Avengers"), "Letters to the Living Legend," ("Captain America"), "The Spider's Web" ("The Amazing Spider-Man"), and "X-Mail," ("Uncanny X-Men") are just a few examples of this tradition. "Suicide Squad" faced difficulties in this aspect, as the United States Postal Service objected to delivering what were labeled as "Suicide Notes."
Some books had trouble sticking with a lettercol title, and changed them on a more or less regular basis. It soon became a tradition to hold a contest for fans to write in with column title ideas, with the winning writer credited in the letters page. Similarly, when a new comic book series was created, readers were asked to submit names for the lettercol title right from the outset.
Reader participation.
Bails may have been the first reader to believe he could influence the direction of his favorite comics. In the early 1960s, he bombarded the DC offices with suggestions for new superhero revivals such as was already happening with the Flash, the Justice League, and so on. For instance, in "Justice League of America" #4, the letters page is filled with missives from Bails under different pen names. He did everything he could to fool editor Julius Schwartz, including mailing the letters from all across the country.
Later on, during the lettercol heyday of the 1970s and 1980s, many comics actively encouraged reader participation. Fans were asked to weigh in on a character’s uniform changes, or in some cases, submit their own uniform designs, with the winning entry actually becoming the character’s new costume. Readers of "Tomb of Dracula" and "The Vision and Scarlet Witch" limited series were asked to suggest names for the main characters' babies. (Winners of contests liked these were often awarded with original artwork from the book in question.)
For team books like "The Avengers", "Justice League", or the "Legion of Super-Heroes", fans were polled as to which characters should become permanent members, team leaders, or conversely, excised from the team. (Readers were also asked to suggest or vote on the title of the letter column. See further discussion below.)
Many 1970s Marvel lettercols stressed the importance of reader feedback, such as this one from "Power Man" #24 (April 1975): "We don't score hits with every issue. Sometimes a story has flaws or just doesn't come up to snuff. Which is why your letters are so valuable to us in producing these comments. . . . So don't let anybody tell you your letters aren't important, people. They are vital to these magazines."
Similarly, (beginning in the 1980s) the most esteemed letterhacks were occasionally solicited to send letters based on early preview copies, thus helping to build a fan-base for a new title. And in a few cases, low-selling titles were saved from cancellation by groups of dedicated fans writing in to the company’s editor-in-chief or publisher.
Letterhacks.
Fans whose letters were published regularly became well known throughout the industry by virtue of their letters. Writer Mark Engblom describes the phenomenon this way:
Some of the most prolific "LOCers" or "letterhacks" include Jerry Bails (the "father of comics fandom"), T.M. Maple (who published over 3,000 letters), Augie De Blieck, Jr. (who claims to have published over 400 letters), Bill Schelly (now a comic book historian), Peter Sanderson (ditto), and Irene Vartanoff (an omnipresent 1960s letterhack who ended up working behind the scenes for Marvel in the 1970s and 1980s). The 1994 Squiddy Awards even featured a "Favorite Letterhack" category (won by Augie De Blieck)!
As discussed above, some letterhacks gained entrée into an actual career in comics because of their letter-writing expertise. For instance, Bob Rozakis parlayed his frequent published letters to DC comics during the late 1960s and early 1970s into a job as DC's "Answer Man" and eventually a solid career as a DC writer. Kurt Busiek, Mary Jo Duffy, Mike Friedrich, Mark Gruenwald, Fred Hembeck, Tony Isabella, Paul Levitz, Ralph Macchio, Dean Mullaney, Martin Pasko, Diana Schutz, Beau Smith, Roy Thomas, and Kim Thompson are just a few of the many comic book professionals who got their starts as young letterhacks.

Psychotic Waltz

Psychotic Waltz is a progressive metal band formed in El Cajon, California in 1988.
Biography.
The first incarnation of the band was under the name Aslan, after a character in the novel "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" by C. S. Lewis. With money earned from local shows and T-shirt sales, they recorded a self-titled demo tape in 1986. After discovering another band with the same name, they changed theirs to Psychotic Waltz and recorded a new four-song demo in 1988.
In 1990, they debuted with their independently financed debut "A Social Grace", which was released in Europe via a licensing deal with the German label Rising Sun Productions. The album was very well received in Europe, being named album of the month in some European magazines, The situation in US was more difficult, as the album was released under the band's own Sub Sonic Records label. With practically no promotion and minimal distribution, it remained an extremely underground item. In 1991, the band appeared in the Dynamo Festival in Holland.
After the tour, the band's guitarist, Dan Rock, suffered a near-fatal accident after falling off a bridge while rappelling. The band went on to record their second album, "Into the Everflow". The album was recorded from August–October, 1992, at Phoenix Studios in Herne, Germany, and was produced by Mekong Delta's main man, Ralph Hubert. After recording the album, but before its release, the band did a small tour while Dan Rock recovered from his accident. The CD was released in Europe on Dream Circle Records, and was very well received, getting album of the month honors in many European magazines. After Rock recovered, the band was nominated as the Best Hard Rock band at the 1992 San Diego Music Awards.
By that time, the band was at the peak of its popularity. They signed with Ralph Hubert's own label, Zardoz Music, for their third album, "Mosquito". Recording took place in late 1994 in Record Plant and Madhatter studios in Los Angeles, with the help of the famous metal producer Scott Burns. The initial response for this album was mixed, as the more conventional songwriting that the band followed led some hardcore fans of the band to label it as a sell-out. This was the last album that was recorded with their initial lineup, as bassist Ward Evans left the band after two tours in Europe and was replaced with Phil Cuttino.
They entered the studio once again in 1996, for what proved to be their last studio work together, "Bleeding". This time, Scott Burns did the engineering, but the record was mixed by Dan Rock and engineer Woody Barber. Before the band started touring in support for the new album, guitarist Brian McAlpine announced that he would not be able to follow the band due to familial obligations. He was replaced by Steve Cox for the band's final two European tours. Phil Cuttino filmed a promotional video for the track "Faded". This proved to be disastrous for the band, as a crew member sued the band in April 1998, claiming that a light on the set caused him to go blind.
The lengthy court battle that followed, coupled with the different musical interests that the band members had, contributed in the band's demise. Buddy Lackey was the first to leave the band. For a short while, the remaining band members tried to continue with the band, but eventually each went his own way. Rock recorded two instrumental albums with his project Darkstar. Norm Leggio and Steve Cox created the band Teabag, and Buddy Lackey formed the band Deadsoul Tribe, where he performs using a new name, Devon Graves. 
Psychotic Waltz reunited in 2010, will tour Europe in support of Nevermore and Symphony X, and are planning to write, record and release a new album.

Hotel Hollywood

Hotel Hollywood is a dark thriller about a wedding party which checks into a hotel and is not found again. The film is written and directed by Param Gill. It stars Param Gill, Arsh Singh, Mehr Hassan and Rahul Nath in the lead roles.Param firmly believes that good cinema is possible without spending big bucks and involvement of audience. This statement was put to test when the movie released on 23 July 2010. The film opened to a huge response in North American theaters and made headlines for "Crack the Code and Win $20000". The Internet was abuzz with more than half a million hits to the web site and tens of thousands of fans on Facebook. Hundreds of code entries were submitted even before the film was released to the North American market. Critics gave the following comments: “TERRIFYING ACTION AND SUSPENSE! I felt wary and fearful for 2 days after watching HOTEL HOLLYWOOD... Mac Ferguson (Critic). HOTEL HOLLYWOOD IS A MUST WATCH... Times of India. 
The film score and soundtrack is composed by Shyam Vai.
Plot.
Param Gill has reportedly shot a film that is inspired by true events. At the heights of swine flu scare, a hotel in Hong Kong was quarantined for one week. The story goes on to tell the sequence of events that follow. The film has been promoted with a unique interactive contest for the first time in the history of cinema. Audience is asked to identify four single digit numbers in the order they appear in the film. These numbers could be on the hotel doors, trash cans, walls etc. The winning prize is $20,000.
According to the official website, "Hotel Hollywood" was initially written as a psychological thriller. But the sudden turn of events during the filming mixed the film with shades of horror.
Production.
It was very hard to find a suitable location for the shoot. After months of scouting, a hotel was finalized in city of West Hollywood, California. On the first day of shoot, many hotel guests complained and the hotel management backed out. The shoot was then moved to city of Modesto, California.The entire hotel was reserved for the shoot. Most of the hotel employees were sent on paid leave for the duration of the shoot. Rumors of super natural sightings started making the rounds of nearly empty hotel, soon after the filming started. These rumors were started by Param Gill in his efforts to provide a spooky environment for the actors to enhance their performance.
But things started to take a different course. The lead actress Mehr Hassan was locked inside the hotel room when the room door jammed. A mechanic had to be brought in to cut the lock and rescue the beautiful actress. She was totally freaked out since the lock was working perfectly fine just until the incident. The next day screenwriter, Sandeep Singh was discovered lying in front of the vending machine just after mid night. Emergency crews responded quickly and were able to revive him in few hours. He told the paramedics that he was just walking to vending machine to grab a bite when something punched him head on. He could not describe more than that. The special effects supervisor, Richard Miranda also experienced some strange presence in his room and he slept in his car for the duration of the shoot. Shooting was halted when most crew members threatened to quit. Param Gill changed the filming schedule. Rest of the filming was done in the day time by blocking out the doors and windows of hotel with sheets of black plastic. Security guards were hired to man the empty corridors.

Wells East Somerset railway station

Wells station in the Somerset city of Wells was the terminus of the East Somerset Railway line from Witham and opened when the line was extended from Shepton Mallet in 1862.
The station was only 100 yards or so from Wells' first station, the terminus of the Somerset Central Railway branch from Glastonbury, which had opened in 1859, and which would later be renamed as Wells (Priory Road). The East Somerset Railway, though nominally independent, was controlled by the Great Western Railway.
In 1870, the Cheddar Valley line from Yatton railway station also reached Wells, where a third station, later to be known as Wells (Tucker Street) was opened. This line too was controlled by the GWR and in the late 1870s a spur line was built to connect the Cheddar Valley line to the East Somerset line, passing through the Priory Road station, though trains did not stop there until 1934. This connecting line opened in 1878, at which time the original East Somerset Railway station in Wells closed, and GWR traffic was concentrated on Tucker Street.
The station building, minus its canopy, was later used as a cheese factory by a company called Marsh and Adams, but was destroyed by fire in 1929. The line through the site continued in operation until closure in 1963.

Rocker (album)

Rocker is the third studio album by Serbian heavy metal band Kraljevski Apartman. For the first time in the band's history, an official keyboard player was brought in substituting the second guitar. The band presented a heavy but at the same time a melodic approach to their music with heavy-riff songs and power ballads. The band recorded eleven new songs plus one bonus track from "Labyrinth" movie soundtrack. The album featured ballad "Dama iz kraljevskog apartmana" which became their stamp for the future, "Ranjena zver" (for which the band recorded a promotional video), glam metal-oriented "Vino, viski i Rock 'n' Roll" and "Za ljubav ne treba da moliš" which became classics and considered unskipable on live appearances. The track "Niemansland" was written in German language and Zdravković provided the vocals. This is the first Kraljevski Apartman track on foreign language and not sang by Lalović.

Naturalization of intentionality

According to Franz Brentano, intentionality refers to the “aboutness of mental states that cannot be a physical relation between a mental state and what is about (its object) because in a physical relation each of the relation must exist whereas the objects of mental states might nost.
Several problems arise for features of intentionality, which are unusual for materialistic relations. Representation is unique. When 'x represents y' is true, it's not the same as other relations between things, like when 'x is next to y' or when 'x caused y' or when 'x met y', etc. Representation is different because, for instance, when 'x represents y' is true, y need not exist. This isn't true when say 'x is the square root of y' or 'x caused y' or 'x is next to y'. Similarly, when 'x represents y' is true, 'x represents z' can still be false, even when y = z. Intentionality encompasses relations that are both physical and mental. In this case, “Billy can love Santa and Jane can search for unicorns even if Santa does not exist and there are no unicorns.”
History.
Franz Brentano, the nineteenth century philosopher, spoke of mental states as involving presentations of the objects of our thoughts. This idea encompasses his belief that one cannot desire something unless they actually have a representation of it in their minds. 
Dennis Stampe was one of the first philosophers in modern times to suggest a theory of content according to which content is a matter of reliable causes. 
Fred Dretske's book, "Knowledge and the Flow of Information" (1981), was a major influence on the development of informational theories, and although the theory developed there is not a teleological theory, Dretske (1986, 1988, 1991) later produced an informational version of teleosemantics. He begins with a concept of carrying information that he calls "indicating", explains that indicating is not equivalent to representing, and then suggests that a representation's content is what it has the function of indicating
Related theories.
Teleosemantics, also known as biosemantics, is used to refer to the class of theories of mental content that use a teleological notion of function. Teleosemantics is best understood as a general strategy for underwriting the normative nature of content, rather than any particular theory. What all teleological theories have in common is the idea that semantic norms are ultimately derivable from functional norms
The theory of asymmetric dependence, from Fodor, who says that his theory “distinguishes merely informational relations on the basis of their higher-order relations to each other: informational relations depend upon representational relations, but not vice versa. He gives an example of this theory when he says, “if tokens of a mental state type are reliably caused by horses, cows-on-dark-nights, zebras-in-the-mist and Great Danes, then they carry information about horses, etc. If however, such tokens are caused by cows-on-dark-nights, etc. because they are caused by horses, but not vice versa, then they represent horses (or property horse).
Alternative theories.
Indeterminacy of translation
20th century American philosopher Willard Van Orman Quine believed that linguistic terms do not have distinct meanings that accompany them because there are no such entities as "meanings”. In his books, "Word and Object" (1960) and "Ontological Relativity" (1968), Quine considers the methods available to a field linguist attempting to translate an unknown language in order to outline his thesis. His thesis, the indeterminacy of translation, notes that there are many different ways to distribute purpose and meanings among words. Whenever a theory of translation is made it is commonly based upon context. An argument over the correct translation of an unidentified term depends on the possibility that the native could have spoken a different sentence. The same problem of indeterminacy would appear in this argument once again since any hypothesis can be defended if one adopts enough compensatory hypotheses about other parts of the language. Quine uses as an example the word "gavagai" spoken by a native upon seeing a rabbit. One can go the simplest route and translate the word to "Lo, a rabbit”, but other possible translations such as "Lo, food" or "Let's go hunting" are completely reasonable given what the linguist knows. Subsequent observations can rule out certain possibilities as well as questioning the natives. But this is only possible once the linguist has mastered much of the natives' grammar and vocabulary. This is a big problem because this can only be done on the basis of hypotheses derived from simpler, observation-connected bits of language, which admit multiple interpretations, as we have seen. 
The intentional stance
Daniel C. Dennett’s theory of mental content, the intentional stance, tries to view the behavior of things in terms of mental properties. According to Dennett: 
"Here is how it works: first you decide to treat the object whose behavior is to be predicted as a rational agent; then you figure out what beliefs that agent ought to have, given its place in the world and its purpose. Then you figure out what desires it ought to have, on the same considerations, and finally you predict that this rational agent will act to further its goals in the light of its beliefs. A little practical reasoning from the chosen set of beliefs and desires will in most instances yield a decision about what the agent ought to do; that is what you predict the agent will do."
Dennett’s thesis has three levels of abstraction:
1. The most tangible is the physical stance, which is at the level of physics and chemistry. This level is concerned with things such as mass, energy, velocity, and chemical composition. 
2. Somewhat more abstract is the design stance, which is at the level of biology and engineering. This level is concerned with things such as purpose, function and design. 
3. Most abstract is the intentional stance, which is at the level of software and minds. This level is concerned with things such as belief, thinking and intent. 
Dennett states that the more concrete the level, the more accurate in principle our predictions are. Though if one chooses to view an object through a more abstract level, he will gain greater computational power by getting a better overall picture of the object and skipping over any extraneous details. Also, switching to a more abstract level has its risks as well as its benefits. If we applied the intentional stance to a thermometer that was heated to 500°C, trying to understand it through its beliefs about how hot it is and its desire to keep the temperature just right, we would gain no useful information. The problem would not be understood until we dropped down to the physical stance to comprehend that it has been melted. Whether to take a particular stance should be decided by how successful that stance is when applied. Dennett argued that it is best to understand human beliefs and desires at the level of the intentional stance.

Bala-Bangor Theological Seminary

Bala-Bangor was a theological seminary belonging to the Welsh Independents (Undeb yr Annibynwyr Cymraeg), an association of Welsh congregationalists. It was founded in 1841 at Llanuwchllyn, then moved to a permanent location at Bala, Gwynedd in 1842 under the principalship of Michael Jones (1787–1853), who was followed by his son Michael D. Jones (1822–1898). 
During Michael D. Jones's principalship, a row broke out between two rival factions within Welsh congregationalism over the seminary's constitution - Michael D. Jones and his followers wanted to keep and adhere to the old constitution but Rev. John Thomas of Liverpool and his followers wanted to impose a new constitution upon the seminary. Michael D. Jones's argument was that Rev. John Thomas's plan would only lead to the presbyterizing of the seminary and of the Congregational churches in general. This row lead to a split and for a period the Congregationalists had two seminaries in Bala, Thomas Lewis's seminary at Plasyndre and Michael D. Jones's at Bodiwan. But by 1886 Thomas Lewi's seminary had moved to Bangor. Michael D. Jones retired in 1892 and this paved the way to unite the two seminaries once again and this time at Bangor thus explaining the seminary's eclectic name: "Bala-Bangor". 
The seminary remained in Bangor up until its closure in 1989 by which time it was under the principalship of R. Tudur Jones, the last in the distinguished line of Principals to serve the Congregational churches in Wales. The seminary was closed mainly because of lack of demand for two Congregational seminaries in Wales. The Memorial College (having moved from Brecon to Swansea and then to Aberystwyth) offered a more central location for a United College to serve the Congregational churches throughout Wales. Through the 1990s, the United College remained at Aberystwyth, up until its closure - now Congregational training is based back in Bangor under the supervision of Rev. Euros Wyn Jones.

Richmond Hill (LIRR station)

Richmond Hill Station was a station on the Montauk Branch of the Long Island Rail Road in the Richmond Hill section of the borough of Queens, in New York City. The station was located at Myrtle Avenue and Jamaica Avenue.
History.
Richmond Hill Station was originally built by the South Side Railroad of Long Island in 1868 as Clarenceville Station, which is not to be confused with the LIRR Clarenceville Station on the Atlantic Branch. The name was changed to Richmond Hill in November 1871. It had two tracks with a station house on one side and an enclosed wooden shelter on the other. The original building survived until a grade crossing elimination project replaced it with an elevated structure in 1923.
The station was closed on March 16, 1998, along with Glendale, Penny Bridge, Haberman, Fresh Pond, Center Moriches, Quogue, Southampton Campus, Mill Neck, and Holtsville stations due to low ridership (Richmond Hill and Penny Bridge both literally had 1 daily rider at the time of their closure). The station and platform remain, though access via the staircase is gated off.
Configuration.
Richmond Hill was the only elevated station on the Lower Montauk branch at the time of closing. The station is an island platform, with a small shelter in the middle and two stairways (one in the shelter; one on the railroad east end). The Montauk Branch has 2 tracks at this location.

MYC4

MYC4 is a company that allows its users to invest microcredits via an internet-platform in medium and small businesses in developing countries in Africa.
History.
MYC4 was founded as a joint venture in May 2006 by Mads Kjær, chairman and former CEO of the Kjær Group and Honorary Danish Consul to Ethiopia, and Tim Vang. MYC4 is currently headquartered in Copenhagen, Denmark with a regional office in Nairobi, Kenya. As of beginning of 2011, it employs 7 people at its Danish office.
Since the company's creation, 19,073 investors from 115 countries have invested more than € 15 million in 8,334 businesses in seven African countries - Uganda, Kenya, Côte d'Ivoire, Rwanda, Ghana, Senegal and Tanzania.
Annual reports and up-to-date statistics are available.
Method of operation.
African businesses apply for a loan at a local credit provider, partnering with MYC4. They specify the amount of money they need, the interest they would be willing to pay and the time they plan for repayment.
Investors who have created accounts on the website can choose from these third-world businesses, which they then bid money towards supporting. They specify an amount, a target interest rate and a minimum interest rate. This process is known as a Dutch auction method and guarantees that the interest rate will be as low as possible, depending on the investor bids.
Depending on the amount of money offered by investors, and the interest rates, individual bids can proceed at the target or a lower interest rate, or be cancelled.
A bid can be as little as €5, repayment times are usually 6 to 12 months, sometimes 2 years.
Providers, Administrators and MYC4 itself all charge a fee for their services. They vary, but they are stated on each loan, in order to create transparency.
Major investments.
In December 2006, MYC4 received a € 670,000 grant from the Danish Aid Agency under the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
On 29 October 2008, The Industrialisation Fund for Developing Countries (IFU) decided to invest approximately € 1.3 million in Africa through MYC4. The Minister for Development Cooperation of Denmark Ulla Tørnæs supports the decision.
Risks.
As any investment, lending money via MYC4 carries risk. In the past, a significant number of loans defaulted, making investments effectively donations. After major restructuring, it was hoped that losses will reduce. As a result of this, the first quarterly report released in 2012 showed a portfolio risk that was the lowest in two years. This shows a net return for investors of -0.1%.
Potential investors should carefully read the 'Risks' page of the MYC4 website.
The forum, where investors could discuss issues, was disabled in October 2010, being replaced with a blog by the organizers.

Mikhail Annenkov

General Mikhail Nikolayevich Annenkov (; formerly also transcribed Michael Nicolaivitch Annenkoff) (1835 in St. Petersburg, Russia - January 22, 1899 in St. Petersburg, Russia) was a Russian nobleman, author, military officer, and renowned engineer. An important figure in the history of the Russian conquest of Turkestan in the 19th Century, he was Governor-General of the Transcaspian Region (today's Turkmenistan).
General Annenkov was the builder of the strategic Transcaspian Railway in its initial stages through what is now Turkmenistan, which made possible the bloody defeat of the Turkmen at Geok-Tepe in 1881. He was also involved in the planning of the Trans-Siberian railroad, which was under construction at the time of his death.
He also played a major role in the Pendjeh Crisis of 1885, when the UK and Russia nearly went to war.
Education and Early Career.
Born into the wealthy Annenkoff family, son of General Nicholas Annenkov, Governor of Odessa and the southwestern provinces and aide-de-camp to the Emperor, Michael studied at the Corps des Pages and was appointed general adjutant to the general staff of the Imperial Army at St. Petersburg. From 1864-1866, during the Polish uprising, Michael earned a reputation as a competent commander and military tactician: by age 27 he had been made a Colonel of the Imperial Army and appointed Aide-de-Camp to Emperor Alexander III of Russia. 
In the 1870s, Michael served as Military Attaché to Germany, during the Franco-Prussian War, and then later to France. His writings on German military tactics during the war were widely read. By 1878 he had been appointed a Lieutenant-General of the Imperial Army. During the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878) General Annenkoff was placed in charge of transportation, learning the valuable skills that would later make him one of the most prominent engineers of his era.
Central Asia.
In the 1880s, General Annenkoff served on several campaigns in Central Asia, most notably against the Turkmen population (serving under General Mikhail Skobelev in the Merv campaign). In order to move troops and supplies, he completed laying more than 1,000 miles of track in less than three years (1885–1888), which brought him immediate engineering fame. He was honored by scientific bodies throughout Europe, including being appointed a vice-president of the International Congress of Geography (1891). He later became a planner and chief promoter of the Trans-Siberian railroad.
General Annenkoff was also involved in the annexation of Emirate of Bukhara as a client state of the Czar. Upon the death of Emir Mozaffar al-Din in 1885, General Annenkoff marched into Bukhara and put Emir's younger son on the throne. The Russian troops that were left behind placed the Emirate of Bukhara under control of the Russian Empire.
Family.
Most prominent of General Annenkoff’s sisters were Madame Marie de Struve, wife of Karl de Struve, Russian Ambassador to Japan, the United States, and the Netherlands respectively, Elizabeth, princess Galitzine, and Alexandra, Vicomtesse de Vogüé, wife of French critic and author Vicomte Eugene Melchior de Vogüé. In 1878 the Vicomte de Vogüé and Miss Alexandra N. Annenkova were married at the Winter Palace, St. Petersburg. In 1883 General Annenkov married Dagmar von Oesterreich (19 years old). The marriage was dissolved in 1889.
General Michael N. Annenkoff died in 1899, reportedly from suicide. There was suspicion that he had misappropriated funds from the Transcaspian Railway. At the time, he was a member of the Imperial Military Council in St. Petersburg.

Old Men In Love

Old Men In Love is a novel by Alasdair Gray, published by Bloomsbury in 2007. Adapting its central conceit - that it represents a found manuscript by one John Tunnock, which Gray merely edits - from the author's earlier "Poor Things", the writing presented as Tunnock's likewise recycles earlier material by Gray. Tunnock's unfinished trilogy of novels, based on the lives of Socrates, Fra Lippo Lippi and Henry James Prince, are thus re-workings of earlier stage and television drama by Gray. Such unoriginality is pointed out in the afterword to the novel (a trick Gray employs earlier in "Something Leather") by the literary critic Sidney Workman (a fictitious alter-ego used in his debut novel, ""). Old Men In Love was met with an ambiguous critical reception, praised for its striking design and diverting contents, criticised for its lack of substance and cynical derivation from earlier material. Writing in the Observer, James Purdon commented that "In form as well as subject matter, this is probably the most twitchily onanistic fiction since "Portnoy's Complaint"".

<doc id="18255085" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18255085" title="USS Vedette (SP-163)">
USS Vedette (SP-163)

The first USS "Vedette" (SP-163) was a commercial yacht built in 1899. At the outbreak of World War I, the yacht was leased by the United States Navy, and was used as a patrol vessel in the North Atlantic Ocean. She served honorably during the war, rescuing survivors at sea, and attacking a German U-Boat. At war’s end, she was converted to her original configuration and returned to her owner, the railroad executive, financier, and philanthropist Frederick W. Vanderbilt (1856-1938) of New York City.
Built in Bath, Maine.
"Virginia" - a steel-hulled, single-screw steam yacht designed by G. L. Watson and built at Bath, Maine, by Bath Iron Works for New York City merchant Isaac Stern — was delivered on 23 December 1899. In 1916, the yacht was acquired by the Frederick W. Vanderbilt and renamed "Vedette". 
Acquired by the U.S. Navy.
The Navy acquired the ship from Vanderbilt on a free-lease basis on 4 May 1917. Earmarked for convoy escort and patrol duty overseas, "Vedette" was assigned the section patrol number SP-163 and was commissioned at the New York Navy Yard in Brooklyn, New York, on 28 May 1917 with Lieutenant Commander Chester L. Hand in command.
World War I service.
Sailing for France.
"Vedette" and five other patrol vessels - all former yachts - got underway from Tompkinsville on Staten Island, New York, bound for Bermuda on 9 June 1917 on the first leg of their voyage to France. and were the first to weigh anchor; , , , and "Vedette" followed. The ships formed up into divisions, with "Vedette" leading the second group.
On the evening of the 12 June 1917, they anchored in St. George's harbor at Bermuda. They remained in Bermuda for a little over three days, coaling ship and taking on water. The vessels got underway again on the morning of 16 June 1917 and reached the Azores on 25 June 1917.
Witnessing the debris of war.
After coaling and taking on water and provisions in the Azores, "Vedette" and her consorts began their passage to Brest, France. En route, they soon encountered abundant evidence that they were entering a war zone. "Vedette" spotted "considerable floating wreckage and a cork life belt" upon which no name was visible on the evening of 2 July 1917. The next morning, she spotted more of the same: boxes, barrels, a broken life-belt, and pieces of planking from an anonymous ship or ships — mute evidence of a sinking. 
The squadron sighted the French coast at 0440 on 4 July 1917, but before they could make it into port, "Christabel" broke down and "Vedette" stood by until she could get underway again. Later, as the ships made their way toward Brest, a French torpedo boat came out and greeted the American force. The six patrol vessels were among the first ships of the United States Navy to reach French waters in World War I.
Over the next 10 days, "Vedette" prepared for the operations that lay ahead. She finally put to sea, in company with "Harvard", on the morning of 16 July 1917.
Assigned to convoy patrol duty.
Her first patrol pretty much set the standard theme for the many that followed. The two ships initially headed for the middle of the patrol line 10 nautical miles (18.5 kilometers) off the coast, extending from the northward and westward of Ushant to the southward of Belle Île. "Vedette" patrolled the southern half of the line while "Harvard" prowled the northern. 
"Vedette" returned to Brest on 19 July 1917, without having met the enemy, but she did encounter more wreckage, including life rings from an unidentified ship. She twice more patrolled the area between Brest and Ushant, near Belle Isle, before the end of July 1917.
"Vedette" remained in port the first few days of August 1917, and she suffered slight damage on the morning of 3 August 1917 when "Christabel" - while shifting moorings — raked her stern, carrying away the flagstaff and damaging the after rail. Nevertheless, "Vedette" stood out to sea at 1700 that afternoon in the screen of an outward-bound "convoy" of 10 merchant ships which were also protected by "Harvard", three French patrol vessels, and two British ships. 
"Vedette" left that convoy at 0050 on 4 August 1917 and patrolled the vicinity until 0650, when she picked up a Brest-bound convoy of 19 merchantmen escorted by three patrol boats. "Vedette" anchored at Brest at 1025 the same day, but her respite was short. Less than six hours later, she stood out with a convoy of 16 merchantmen, three French patrol boats, and "Harvard".
"Vedette" left that convoy when it passed out of the coastal danger zone and waited to pick up a Brest-bound convoy at 1655 on 5 August 1917. While en route in, "Harvard" broke down, and "Vedette" stood by until her longstanding partner was ready to proceed.
Friendly fire.
Still en route to Brest during the pre-dawn hours of 6 August 1917, "Vedette" sighted a "suspicious vessel" at 0320 and opened fire with her number two 3-inch (76.2-mm) gun. The shot fell well forward of the stranger, who soon signaled that she was a French patrol boat. "Vedette"'s first shot of the war had been aimed at a "friendly" ship.
"Vedette" was docked at Brest shortly after noon that day for alterations. After the work was completed during the forenoon watch (0800-1200) on 7 August 1917, the ship was towed back to her former berth, where she provisioned and made ready to return to the Ushant-Brest patrol line.
Convoy ship strikes a mine.
"Vedette" escorted an outward-bound convoy late on 9 August 1917, and an inward-bound one on 10 August 1917, before she and "Harvard" were assigned to another outward-bound group of 10 merchantmen and two French patrol vessels. At 2010, "Vedette"'s watch heard an explosion astern, accompanied by several blasts of a ship's whistle. A British merchantman, last in line of the convoy, had struck a naval mine; nearby, a French vessel rescued 14 men before the rapidly sinking ship disappeared. Twelve men had died in the explosion.
After delivering the convoy to Quiberon Bay, "Vedette" anchored at 0645, but that evening again got underway — with a convoy of eight merchantmen, two French patrol vessels, and "Harvard" -- and arrived back at Brest with that group at noon on the following day. On the morning of 15 August 1917, "Vedette" was underway again and conducted convoy escort operations through the next day.
Rescuing crew members of torpedoed ship.
At 0650 on 17 August 1917, the Greek steamship "Pontoporos" -- bound from Tyne Dock to Spezia with a cargo of 4,600 tons of coal and 2,000 tons of coke — was hit by a torpedo on the starboard beam. It exploded eight feet (2.4 m) below the waterline, abreast the engine room, and tore up the decking topside.
"Vedette" rang up full speed ahead and stood about, hunting for the submarine. Unable to make contact with the enemy, the yacht picked up 27 men from a lifeboat, including the master of "Pontoporos", a Captain Panas, at 0715. Two more men were transferred from a French fishing boat five minutes later. "Vedette" soon cast the lifeboat adrift at 0725 and circled the sinking ship; at 0740, "Pontoporos" sank from sight. After "Vedette" reached Port Heliguen later that morning, she turned the 29 survivors over to French authorities.
"Vedette" continued the same routine of operations — interspersed with periods of upkeep, maintenance, and provisioning — through the remainder of the summer and autumn of 1917 and into 1918. On 20 January 1918, Lieutenant Commander Hand was relieved as commanding officer by Lieutenant Charles Alan Pownall (1887-1975), a future rear admiral who would command aircraft carrier task force during World War II and later serve as governor of Guam.
Updating anti-submarine weapons.
By January 1918, the ship's armament reflected the multi-national character of the escort work performed out of Brest, for not only did she carry her original allotment of 10 American Sperry Mk. I "Mines", but also eight French Guirand charges and three British Type "D" ones. By the summer of 1918, that had again changed, and the ship carried, by that point, 21 American Mark 2 depth charges.
"Vedette" goes to general quarters.
"Vedette"s routine changed little in 1918. Her only encounter with the enemy, however, came on 5 August 1918.
Underway from Quiberon Bay at 0435 that day, she was steaming at the head of a convoy of 11 ships; other escorts were "Harvard", the patrol vessel , and the torpedo boat "Stewart" (Coast Torpedo Vessel No. 13). At 0802, the convoy passed Point de Chats abeam to port, distance three nautical miles (5.6 kilometers); at 0812, the ships changed course so that by 0835, they were off Pen Men, abeam to port at a distance of two and one-half nautical miles (4.6 kilometers). At 0924, "Vedette"s watch felt a slight jar; within a minute, they saw that the merchant ship SS "Hundvaago" had taken a torpedo and was sinking rapidly.
"Vedette" went to full speed ahead and sprang to general quarters. At 0927, Signalman 3rd Class Nye, Chief Quartermaster Teiper, and the officer of the deck saw a submarine off the starboard quarter of the convoy. "Vedette" heeled as the helm was put over at hard right rudder and she raced toward the enemy. She sounded five short blasts on her whistle, but a merchant ship obstructed her view of the submarine, and the periscope disappeared. "Vedette" immediately commenced a search, circling and trying to locate the enemy submersible.
At 0935, "Vedette" received orders from "Harvard" and, in company with "Stewart", quickly proceeded to reform the panic-stricken convoy. Within 20 minutes, "Hundvaago" had sunk, another U-boat victim. An hour before noon, "Vedette" resumed her position at the head of the convoy and, 45 minutes later, took station on the port flank of the convoy.
Things were not quiet for long, however. At one minute past noon, a French seaplane, attracted to the scene of the torpedoing, dropped a smoke bomb, indicating the presence of what looked like a submarine. "Vedette" again went to general quarters and put over hard right rudder as she sped off to the hunt. She soon picked up a small oil wake about 200 yards (183 m) east of the smoke bomb and dropped a barrage of eight depth charges at 1215. Ten minutes later, having seen "no further evidence of a submarine," "Vedette" rejoined the convoy, taking station on the port bow.
"Stewart" later dropped four depth charges over a 15-minute period but failed to learn whether or not she had tangled with a submarine. She nevertheless continued the hunt, in company with "Vedette", "Harvard", and "Remlick", while the newly arrived destroyer "Tucker" (Destroyer No. 57) joined the convoy's screen.
Rescuing a downed French plane.
However, "Vedette's" work for that day was not complete until she had assisted a downed French seaplane from the French Naval Air Service. At 1718, another French plane had dropped a message requesting aid in Bay de Douarnez. A bit under an hour later, "Vedette" lowered her motorboat, which that took the pilots aboard and took the disabled plane in tow. When "Vedette" reached her destination, she lowered a whaleboat which took up the tow and safely delivered the French plane.
End-of-war-operations.
"Vedette" would never again have that much excitement in a single day. Thereafter, her duties for the remainder of the war were placid as she continued to escort convoys to and from Brest and patrolled offshore in between convoy runs. Less than a month after the Armistice with Germany stilled the guns of World War I on 11 November 1918, she departed Brest for the last time when she weighed anchor on 6 December 1918 for the long voyage home.
Steaming in company with the patrol vessels , , , and "Sultana", "Vedette" arrived at Ponta Delgada at 1025 on 11 December 1918. She coaled ship there, took on provisions, and brought aboard 133 bags of coal to store on deck for the transatlantic voyage. Underway at 0702 on 15 December 1918, the squadron anchored in St. George's harbor, Bermuda, on the morning of 24 December 1918. It got underway again on 25 December 1918 on the last leg of its voyage.
Shortly after leaving Bermuda, "Emeline", "Nokomis", and "Corona" steamed off "on duty assigned," leaving "Vedette" alone with "Sultana" -- one of her companions on her voyage to Europe in the summer of 1917. The two patrol vessels entered New York Harbor on the afternoon of 28 December 1918, home at last.
Decommissioning and disposal.
At 0900 on 30 December 1918, "Vedette" moved up the East River to the New York Navy Yard in Brooklyn. By noon, her trio of 3-inch (76.2-mm) guns, her machine guns, and small arms had been removed.
On 4 February 1919, at Tebo's Yacht Basin, "Vedette" was returned to Frederick W. Vanderbilt. She was stricken from the Navy List the same day.

Remedy Drive

Remedy Drive is an Alternative rock band founded in 1998 in Lincoln, Nebraska. They are currently located out of Nashville, Tennessee. The band is currently composed of lead vocalist David Zach, guitarist Dave Mohr, bassist Corey Horn, and drummer Tim Buell. They have recorded five independent studio albums, one independent live album and released their first Word Records studio album, "Daylight Is Coming", on August 26, 2008. The band was originally founded as a quartet consisting of the four Zach brothers. Three of the four brothers left the band in early 2011.
History.
Remedy Drive were originally called The Aslan Band when they formed in 1998. They released their first album, "Remedy", in 1998 under their original name. After changing their name to Remedy, they released four more independent albums: "Remedy (The Blue One)" (1999), "Remedy (The Red One)" (2001), "Remedy: A Live Album" (2003), and "Magnify" (2004), before once again changing their name, this time to Remedy Drive. Their last independent album, "Rip Open the Skies", was released on April 25, 2006 and has sold over 20,000 copies to date.
Before signing for Word Records, the band played over 200 concerts a year in the Midwest and West Coast of the United States.
"Daylight Is Coming".
The band signed on with Word Records in early 2008 after being an independent band for nearly ten years. Their first non-independent studio album, "Daylight Is Coming", was released on August 26, 2008 on Word Records. The album was produced by Ian Eskelin. Remedy Drive's first official single "Daylight" was released to Christian CHR radio stations on May 23, 2008. Lead singer David Zach said about the song: "In "Lord of the Rings", Gandalf said, ‘At dawn, look to the East’, and that’s the message we’re offering here: even in the most desperate times, each new day provides a glimmer of hope."
The Remedy Drive song, "Hope", was used for the Vancouver Olympic Games commercial in 2009 - 2010. In early 2010, Remedy Drive's official website said that the band were creating new songs for an upcoming project, possibly a second album for Word Records. In 2010, Remedy Drive toured with the Rock and Worship Roadshow, with artists such as David Crowder Band, MercyMe, Family Force 5, Fee, and Sidewalk Prophets.
On April 6, 2011, the band's website announced that all of the Zach brothers except David (Daniel, Philip and Paul Zach) would be leaving the band, to be replaced by Dave Mohr, Timmy Jones, and Corey Horn. Timmy Jones left in 2013 to join For King and Country, and Tim Buell stepped in.
"Resuscitate".
Remedy Drive signed with their current label, Centricity and began working on their seventh studio album, entitled ""Resuscitate"," which was released on September 18, 2012. On June 19, 2012, the band released their first single off the album, "Better Than Life," along with a lyric music video. The album has had good reviews so far. The title song "Resuscitate" spent significant time at the top of Christian rock charts.
The band has announced they are recording their next album "Commodity" with former bassist and David's brother, Philip Zach, who owns The Grid Studio in Lincoln Nebraska. Release date is TBA.

1917–18 Montreal Canadiens season

The 1917–18 Montreal Canadiens season was the team's ninth season and first as a member of the new National Hockey League (NHL). The Canadiens sided with other members of the National Hockey Association (NHA) and voted to suspend the NHA and start the NHL to expel the Toronto Blueshirts ownership. The Canadiens qualified for the playoffs by winning the first half of the season, but lost the playoff to the temporary Toronto franchise, made up of Blueshirts players.
Team business.
The club changed its name to "Club de Hockey Canadien Ltd." from "Club Athletic Canadien". The logo on the jersey was changed to reflect this, substituting the "A" within the "C" with an "H".
Regular season.
Quebec did not ice a team for the season. Quebec's players were dispersed by draft and Montreal chose Joe Hall, Joe Malone and Walter Mummery. Georges Vezina led the league in goals against average of 4 per game and Joe Malone had an outstanding 44 goals in 20 games to lead the league in goals.
The team was forced to return to its former arena the Jubilee Rink after the Montreal Arena burned down on January 2, 1918. The rival Montreal Wanderers folded after the fire, leaving only three teams (Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto) to continue the season. The Wanderers' players were dispersed and the Canadiens picked up Billy Bell and Jack McDonald.
On January 28, 1918, when Canadiens visited Toronto, Toronto's Alf Skinner and Montreal's Joe Hall got into a stick-swinging duel. Both players received match penalties, $15 fines and were arrested by the Toronto Police for disorderly conduct, for which they received suspended sentences.

Mary Lindell

Mary Lindell (1895-1986), also known as the Comtesse de Milleville, the Comtesse de Moncy and Marie-Claire was a British-born nurse who lived in France and worked independently against the Nazis during the Second World War. During the First World War, she served as a member of the Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD) and subsequently with the "Secours aux Blessés", a division of the French Red Cross. During the Second World War she created escape lines in occupied France, helping to get people out of the country. Despite being sentenced to death and arrested, she managed to survive the war. Two of her children were arrested by the Nazis; one was tortured severely, but survived, while the other is believed to have perished in a Nazi concentration camp.
Biographical details.
Lindell was born in 1895 to a wealthy family in Surrey, England. Her mother was a member of the Colls family, the daughter of a successful architect.
She was decorated for her bravery and service by the French, receiving a Croix de Guerre in 1918. She was also decorated by the Tsarist Russian governments. She married the Count de Milleville, a member of the French aristocracy, and made her home in France. Following the Nazi invasion of France, Lindell worked with various Allied agencies, at considerable risk to herself and family, to help smuggle downed airmen and others to freedom on the "Pat" line (named after "Pat O'Leary", an alias of Albert Guérisse). Despite a narrow escape, which led to her finding brief refuge in her native Britain, she joined MI9 and returned to occupied France in 1942, where she learned that as the Comtesse de Milleville, she had been sentenced to death.
She organized a new escape line, the "Marie-Claire" line, after her new name. She continued to work in France until severely wounded, captured and deported to Ravensbrück concentration camp at the end of 1943. She survived in the camp hospital and was liberated in 1945.
The Lindell children were involved in their mother's work. Her son, Maurice, was interrogated and severely beaten for his activities but was released when Mary paid the Gestapo chief in Lyons, Klaus Barbie, a bribe of 45,000 francs. Her other son, Oky, was similarly interrogated and deported to a concentration camp where it is presumed he died. Lindell was subsequently recognized for her work and was also an advocate for those British civilians who were interned in Nazi concentration camps.
Film and Television.
The 1991 film "One Against the Wind" starred Judy Davis, and was based on the biography "Story of Mary Lindell: Wartime Secret Agent" by Barry Wynne. She was featured in a television series called "Women of Courage" about four women who defied the Nazis, produced by Peter Morley, himself a German Jewish refugee. The other women were Maria Rutkiewicz, a Polish woman; Sigrid Helliesen Lund, a Norwegian; and Hiltgunt Zassenhaus, a German.

Insular Belt

The Insular Belt is a physiogeological region on the north western North American coast. It consist of three major island groups and many smaller islands and stretches from southern British Columbia into Alaska and the Yukon. It represents the Late Cretaceous to Eocene accretion of what is known as the "Insular Superterrane" the North American continent. 
The rocks that form the Insular Super-Terrane are allochthonous meaning they are not related to the North American continent. They consist of a series of volcanics, intrusions and sedimentary rocks from the collision of an ancient island arc called the Insular Islands. The exact collision of the Insular Islands remains uncertain.
The major island groups that compose the Insular Super-Terrane are, from north to south, Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands, the Queen Charlotte Islands and the Alexander Archipelago in Alaska.
The region is noteworthy as it has the greatest physiographic relief from the depths of Queen Charlotte Sound (which had been a coastal plain during the last ice age) to the heights of the Wrangell - Saint Elias Mountains. In general the region is extremely rugged with very little flat land except in certain regions (e.g. the east coast of Vancouver Island).
The region is thickly forested, having a temperate year round climate, with many of the worlds largest trees.

Andrew Goldberg (director)

Andrew Goldberg (born June 26, 1968) is a producer and director and is the founder and owner of Two Cats Productions in New York City. An Emmy Award winner, Goldberg's credits include producing/directing documentaries and news and long-form programming for PBS, ABC News, MSNBC and many others. His works include public affairs, history, and current events, with projects focusing on topics such as the Armenian Genocide and contemporary anti-Semitism.
Documentaries.
Some of his films include:
A Yiddish World Remembered
"A Yiddish World Remembered" (2002) focuses on the story of Jewish life in Eastern Europe before the Holocaust, as told by some of the remaining eyewitnesses. This film was hosted by Oscar-nominated actor Elliott Gould and was commissioned, funded, and distributed by PBS. It won a New York Emmy Award for Outstanding Historical/Cultural Programming in 2003.
Proud to Serve
In 2004, Walter Cronkite hosted Goldberg's film "Proud to Serve", which explores the life and culture of the US Army. Through reflections and personal stories of sacrifice and service, this program profiles the camaraderie and pride shared among those who engage in active combat. It also illustrates the lives of those who work behind the scenes, such as clerks, translators, and mechanics. It premiered nationally on American Public Television and was hailed by the Wall Street Journal as an "extraordinary and absorbing" film that's "...not to be missed."
The Armenian Genocide
Another of his films, "The Armenian Genocide" (2006) is the complete story of the first Genocide of the 20th century, when over a million Armenians died at the hands of the Ottoman Turks during World War I. The film, which aired nationally on PBS, features interviews with the leading experts in the field, such as Pulitzer Prize-winning author Samantha Power and New York Times best-selling author Peter Balakian, in addition to never-before-seen historical footage of the events and key players of one of the greatest untold stories of the 1900s.
"The Armenian Genocide" is narrated by Julianna Margulies and includes historical narrations by Ed Harris, Natalie Portman, Laura Linney, Jared Leto, and Orlando Bloom, among others.
Alessandra Stanley, the chief television critic of "The New York Times", described "The Armenian Genocide" as "powerful" and stated that it "...honors the victims of the Genocide."
Anti-Semitism in the 21st Century: The Resurgence
"Anti-Semitism in the 21st Century: The Resurgence", Andrew Goldberg's most recent release, aired on the PBS in January 2007. Hosted by Judy Woodruff, the film explores anti-Semitism in the Christian and Muslim worlds and covers the history of anti-Semitism from centuries ago in Europe to the present. Like "The Armenian Genocide", "Anti-Semitism in the 21st Century: The Resurgence" was reviewed in major newspapers across the country, including "The New York Times" and The Boston Globe. Barry Garron of "The Hollywood Reporter" said Goldberg "has performed a real service by analyzing the toxic mixture of ignorance and hatred and explaining why it has been so impervious to enlightenment and civilization for so long."
Jerusalem: Center of the World
"Jerusalem: Center of the World", Andrew Goldberg's most recent film, aired nationally on PBS, on April 1, 2009 to critical acclaim. Hosted by Ray Suarez, Co-Anchor and Senior Correspondent of the PBS NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, the two-hour film is a celebration of Jerusalem - its history, culture and impact on the world.
The Iranian Americans
"The Iranian Americans" chronicles the journey of Iranians who moved to the United States shortly after Ayatollah Khomeini's rise to power in the aftermath of the 1979 revolution. It aired on December 18, 2012.
Recognition and awards.
The New York Festivals World Medal, International TV Programming, 2000

2008–09 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season

The 2008–09 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season was an event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation. It began on November 15, 2008, and officially ended on April 30, 2009, with the exception for Mauritius and the Seychelles, for which it ended on May 15, 2009. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the basin, which is west of 90°E and south of the Equator. Tropical cyclones in this basin were monitored by the Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre in Réunion.
As predicted by the sub regional office of Mauritius ten named storms formed in this basin. It officially began on November 15, but began 1 month earlier when Tropical Storm Asma formed on October 16. Most of the storms that formed this year were weak or stayed at sea. Only two storms reached hurricane strength this year, both of which were Category 3 or higher, and only 3 storms made landfall in the entire season. Overall, the impact of this season was relatively minor, but damaging for Madagascar, due to the heavy rains from Eric, Fanele, Izilda and Jade.
__TOC__
Storms.
Zone of Disturbed Weather 01.
On October 6, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring an area of persistent convection about 575 km (355 mi) southeast of Diego Garcia. Although the center of circulation (CoC) was elongated, the system was located within an area of low wind shear and development of the low was possible. At 12:00 UTC later that day, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre (RSMC), Météo-France (MFR), began issuing advisories on "Zone of Disturbed Weather 01". Despite a banding feature developed around the CoC, significant development was not anticipated. The low gradually weakened throughout October 7, and dissipated the next day.
Moderate Tropical Storm Asma.
On October 16, MFR designated an area of low pressure north-west of Diego Garcia as Tropical Disturbance 02. Later that evening the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the system. At 2100 UTC on October 16, the JTWC issued their first advisory and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 01S. Early the next day the disturbance intensified into a tropical depression, but on October 18 MFR downgraded the system to a tropical disturbance, noting that the near gale-force winds that were near the center are now several hundred kilometers away from the center. The next day MFR re-upgraded the system to a tropical depression due to a slight decrease in vertical wind shear that had inhibited the disturbance and a slight re-location of the center. Later that day MFR upgraded the depression to a Moderate Tropical storm, so the Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centre in Mauritius assigned the name Asma to the tropical storm. Early on October 20, Asma reached its peak intensity with winds of 85 km/h (50 mph) with a minimum pressure of 985 hPa (mbar). The storm featured good outflow and was situated over warm waters; however, moderate wind shear was forecast to prevent the cyclone from intensifying any further. Shortly after reaching peak intensity, the combination of cooler waters and higher wind shear caused the storm to weaken slightly. Continued weakening took place throughout the day as deep convection associated with Asma dissipated and the strongest winds were displaced from the center. By the morning of October 21, Asma was downgraded to a tropical depression as the low became further disorganized. Later that day, the depression degenerated to a tropical disturbance as only an exposed low remained. The final advisory was issued at 0600 UTC on October 22 as no redevelopment took place. However, only 12 hours after the final advisory was issued, the disturbance began to regenerate and MFR began issuing advisories on the regenerated system. The redevelopment was short lived and Asma dissipated less than 24 hours later.
Officials in Madagascar issued storm warnings as Tropical Storm Asma was forecast to make landfall in the northern portion of the island on October 23. Despite warnings, residents did not take precautions before the storm. Following the regeneration of Asma, the storm produced heavy rains over northern Madagascar which caused flooding in eight rural communities. One person was killed in Doany common rural district of Andapa. A total of 448 hectares of farmland were also inundated by floodwaters. Six oxen and 24 pigs were also killed and three bridges were damaged. Following the damages caused by the storm, officials provided first aid kits, nine tons of rice, 100 cartons of soap, 60 cartons of clothing, 120 mosquito nets, 20 bags of pulses and 30 tents to the affected population. The heavy rains were accompanied by winds gusting up to 70 km/h (43 mph). After brushing Madagascar, Asma brought unseasonable heavy rains to parts of Mozambique and Tanzania.
Moderate Tropical Storm Bernard.
On November 15, a low pressure area was located about 795 km (495 mi) east-southeast of Diego Garcia, accompanied by persistent convection. It was centered east of a ridge and was within an area of moderate vertical wind shear. Over the next several days, the system moved slowly eastward with little development. On November 19, convection developed around the circulation after being nearly stationary for a few days. At 0600 UTC, MFR designated the system as Tropical Disturbance 03, about 695 km (430 mi) east-southeast of Diego Garcia. As rainbands and outflow developed, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. Later that day, MFR upgraded the disturbance to a tropical depression. About three hours later, the JTWC began issuing advisories on Tropical Cyclone 03S, although wind shear was forecast to prevent significant intensification. Located to the northeast of a low to mid-level trough and to the southwest of a near-equatorial ridge, the system began to accelerate to the east. At 0600 UTC on November 20, the JTWC assessed the system to have reached its peak intensity with winds of 75 km/h (45 mph 1-minute winds). Shortly after, MFR upgraded the depression to Moderate Tropical Storm Bernard, with peak winds of 65 km/h (40 mph).
Just six hours after being named, Bernard was downgraded to a tropical depression as all associated deep convection dissipated. The sudden decrease was caused by the storm's unusually fast movement of 50 km/h (30 mph) towards the east-southeast over cooler waters. At the same time MFR downgraded Bernard to a depression, the JTWC issued their final advisory on Tropical Cyclone 03S as it had weakened below tropical storm status. Early the next morning, MFR downgraded the system to a tropical disturbance and issued their final advisory on the dissipating cyclone. The remnants of Bernard entered the Australia region, where it was briefly designated as Tropical Low 01U before dissipating.
Severe Tropical Storm Cinda.
On the evening of December 16, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation alert on a rapidly organizing disturbance located west of Diego Garcia. The low level centre continued to improve with convection wrapping into the centre and the JTWC upgraded the disturbance into a tropical storm, at the same time MFR designated the system a tropical depression. Under low shear and favourable upper level outflow, 04S was upgraded to Moderate Tropical Storm Cinda by MFR early on December 18. Soon after, Cinda was upgraded to a severe tropical storm as it moved south-southwestwards away from Diego Garcia. Later that same day, Cinda was downgraded to a moderate tropical storm. The wind shear kept the eye north of the convection. On the morning of December 21, Cinda degenerated into a remnant low about 250 miles off the coast of Madagascar amongst heavy wind shear.
Severe Tropical Storm Dongo.
The origins of Dongo can be traced back to an area of low pressure that formed far from land late on January 7. At 06:00 UTC, MFR designated it as a Zone of Disturbed Weather 1,530 km (950 mi) northeast of Mauritius. However, strong wind shear was expected to inhibit short term development. A few hours later, MFR further upgraded the low to a tropical disturbance. At 1500 UTC, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. Situated along the edge of a low-mid level ridge, the disturbance tracked towards the southwest. Despite a brief decease in convection, at 0600 UTC on January 9, MFR upgraded the disturbance to a tropical depression. Shortly after, the depression was upgraded to Moderate Tropical Storm Dongo. At the time of the upgrade, Dongo began to turn more towards the south as further development of the storm was anticipated. Roughly three hours later, the JTWC began issuing advisories on Tropical Cyclone 06S . After weakening slightly early on January 10, Dongo began to turn towards the southeast. Subsequently, convection rapidly decreased, leaving the center partially exposed even though conditions were favorable for intensification. Six hours later, however, Dongo intensified into a severe tropical storm while reaching its peak intensity with winds of 95 km/h (60 mph 10-minute winds) with a minimum pressure of 984 hPa (mbar) according to MFR. Furthermore, Dongo peak with winds of 100 km/h (65 mph 1-minute winds) according to the JTWC about 1,240 km (770 mi) east-southeast of Mauritius. 
Tracking towards the south-southeast, Dongo approached cooler waters and began to transition into an extratropical cyclone. Wind shear was also increasing over the storm in response to an approaching upper-level trough. Despite moving over cooler waters, the storm remained a severe tropical storm until being declared extratropical at 0600 UTC on January 12. Several hours later, the JTWC issued their final advisory on the system Early on January 13, MFR followed suit, though it was later believed to have completed such transition earlier.
Moderate Tropical Storm Eric.
On January 17, the MFR identified a Zone of Disturbed Weather northeast of La Reunion. The following day the disturbance organized quite significantly west-northwest of Madagascar and MFR classified it as a tropical disturbance. The disturbance intensified into a moderate tropical storm on the 19th. Eric crossed the coastline around Toamasina, which reported a surface low pressure of 992 hPa, mid morning on that day and skitted along the eastern Madagascar coast for much of the day before tracking southeast away from the coast on January 20. On January 20, the JTWC issued its final advisory on Eric, as it had been torn apart by the shear from the strong Fanele. MFR downgraded Eric to a tropical depression on January 21, noting it could re-deepen as it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone.
Eric killed two people, injured 24, left 992 homeless, and affected an additional 7,606 in eastern Madagascar. A total of 32 classrooms were destroyed by the storm, mainly UNICEF tents and 42 other classrooms were damaged.
Intense Tropical Cyclone Fanele.
On January 17, the JTWC identified a rapidly organizing tropical low just off the coast of Madagascar, near Antananarivo, in the Mozambique Channel. The system showed signs of a quickly developing surface low, and evidence of an upper-level Anticyclone creating a favorable environment for the system. Later that day, the JTWC assessed the possibility of the system becoming a tropical cyclone in 24 hours as "Poor". As the system continued to organize, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert early the next morning. Soon afterward, the MFR designated the system as Tropical Disturbance 07. The system was predicted to organize at regular speed and remain quasi-stationary within the next 24 hours and then recurve toward the Malagasy coast as a moderate tropical storm. Six hours later, MFR upgraded the system to Tropical Depression 07. The next day, the tropical depression was upgraded to Moderate Tropical Storm Fanele and the JTWC upgraded it to Tropical Cyclone 09S. Later that day, Fanele continued to rapidly organize as it strengthened into a Severe Tropical Storm. Late on January 19, Fanele strengthened into a high-end Tropical Cyclone. It strengthened into an Intense Tropical Cyclone on the morning of January 20 with an intensity of 100 knot winds. Fanele made landfall between 00:00 am – 02:00 am UTC on January 21 and weakened to a Category 1 with 75 knot winds. Early in the morning of January 22, Fanele weakened to tropical depression as it exited into the Indian Ocean. It restrengthed back into a Moderate Tropical Storm, but it became extratropical the next day.
At least eight people were killed, two were left missing, and over 20,000 others were left homeless due to Fanele. 
Intense Tropical Cyclone Gael.
On February 1, MFR began issuing advisories on an area of disturbed weather newly formed in the central Indian Ocean. JTWC assessed the potential for the development of a significant tropical cyclone within next 24 hours as "poor". JTWC upgraded the disturbance's chances of forming into a tropical cyclone to "fair". On February 2, RSMC designated the area of disturbed weather as "Zone of Disturbed Weather 08. " Later that day JTWC upgraded the disturbance's chances to "good" and issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. Later that day MFR upgraded Zone of Disturbed Weather 08 into Tropical Disturbance 08. On February 3, JTWC was upgraded the system to Tropical Cyclone 13S, MFR re-designated Tropical Disturbance 08 to Moderate Tropical Storm Gael. Early next day on February 5, MFR upgraded it to Severe Tropical Storm Gael. The system quickly intensified that morning into a Tropical Cyclone north of Réunion Island in the early afternoon. Gael was upgraded to an Intense Tropical Cyclone in the evening on February 6. It held that strength for the next couple of days before weakening back to a Severe Tropical Storm. On February 10, the JTWC issued its final warning on Gael as it had transitioned into a cold-core system over the Southern Ocean which then merged with the extratropical remnants of Innis.
On February 3, Metéo-France issued a pre-cyclone alert (yellow alert) for the islands near Réunion. The next day, Mauritius Meteorological Services issued their Cyclone Warning Class II as Gael approached northeast of the island. Two fatalities occurred on Réunion as a result of heavy rain produced by Gael. A motorcyclist was swept away after trying to cross a submerged road. The other death occurred after a man, who was reportedly drunk, attempted to swim across a flooded road. He was overcome by the waters and swept away. Officials in Madagascar warned the public about the possibility of torrential rains, mudslides, and significant property damage from Gael.
Severe Tropical Storm Hina.
On February 20, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center began issuing advisories on an area of disturbed weather newly formed in the central Indian Ocean. Later that day, JTWC assessed the disturbance's potential for the development of a significant tropical cyclone within next 24 hours as "Poor". Early on February 21, JTWC upgraded the disturbance's chances of forming into a tropical cyclone from "Poor" to "Fair". In the afternoon, JTWC upgraded the system to "Good" and issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. The JTWC then upgraded the disturbance to a Tropical Cyclone 16S, and it is forecast gradually move southwestward and strengthen for the next couple of days. It already began to show a defined organization with some convective banding that same day. Mauritius Meteorological Services upgraded the Zone of Disturbed Weather 09 intensifying to Moderate Tropical Storm and named it "Hina". The next day, it became a Severe Tropical Storm. Later on February 25, Hina weakened to a Moderate Tropical Storm and then weakened to a tropical disturbance as wind shear removed all convection from the centre. Early on February 24, JTWC issued their final warning on 16S for the same reason.
Tropical Depression 10.
On March 6, the JTWC began monitoring a newly formed area of disturbed weather in the central Indian Ocean, and two days later, they issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert on the disturbance and upgraded it to Zone of Disturbed Weather 10. On March 9, the disturbance was upgraded to a depression and was reclassified as Tropical Cyclone 19S. Wind shear strongly affected the system and caused it to dissipate in the early morning of March 10. The depression did not intensify to a tropical storm, it was the first to do so since the first disturbance of the season formed on October 6.
Severe Tropical Storm Izilda.
A Tropical Disturbance formed in the Mozambique Channel around March 21 and on March 24 the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert and designated the system Tropical Cyclone 24S. The system is expected to drift very slowly south then south-west, remaining quasi-stationary. Around midday on the 25th, Izilda was upgraded to a severe tropical storm with 65 mph winds. It remained at that intensity throughout the day, but land interaction with Madagascar and wind shear caused Izilda to dissipate later on the 27th.
Due to the proximity of Izilda to Madagascar, storm warnings were put in place for coastal areas between Morondava and Toliara. Fishermen were advised to remain at port due to large swells produced by the storm. Officials in Mozambique feared that the storm would bring heavy rains to areas already suffering from severe flooding which has left over 4,000 people homeless. Fishermen in the country were also advised not to leave port due to the dangerous conditions. As a tropical depression, Izilda passed near Europa Island; however, no damage was reported. Izilda brought moderate rainfall to parts of southwest Madagascar and Europa Island. Waves up to 8 m (26.2 ft) impacted coastal areas of Mozambique and Madagascar as Izilda stalled on March 25.
Severe Tropical Storm Jade.
On April 4, an area of disturbed weather formed northeast of Réunion. JTWC reported the disturbance's chance of forming into a tropical cyclone as "good" and issued Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert, and MFR began designating the system as Zone of Disturbed Weather 12. Later that day, JTWC upgraded the system to Tropical Cyclone 26S. Early next day, the disturbance intensified into Tropical Depression 12 as predicted by MFR. Later on that afternoon, MFR upgraded the tropical depression to a moderate tropical storm, naming it Jade. Later that evening, Jade was upgraded to a severe tropical storm. Jade made landfall near Antalaha, Madagascar between 06:00 am – 08:00 am UTC on April 6 and weakened to a moderate tropical storm. Soon after, Jade weakened to an overland depression. On April 7, Jade exited the coast of Madagascar. However, later that day, Jade reintensified into a moderate tropical storm. Then, on April 8, Jade was again upgraded to a severe tropical storm by La Reunion. The storm became nearly stationary southeast of Madagascar later that day. It became extratropical soon afterwards but was quite powerful reaching a central air pressure of 958 milibars.
Heavy rains from the cyclone in northern Madagascar caused a home to collapse, killing three people. At least 800 others were left homeless due to the storm in northern Madagascar. Five other people were killed in a mudslide near Mananjary and another 3,320 were left homeless. A ninth person was killed on April 9 during a landslide in Nosy Varika. In all, Jade killed 15 people and left 22,900 others homeless throughout Madagascar.
Storm names.
Tropical disturbances were named upon reaching moderate tropical storm strength. When a tropical disturbance reached this intensity west of 55°E, then the Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centre in Madagascar assigned the appropriate name to the storm. If it reached moderate tropical storm strength between 55°E and 90°E, then the Sub-Regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centre in Mauritius named the storm. New name lists are used every year, so no names are retired. The naming list for the 2008-09 South-West Indian Ocean was announced by Meteo-France on August 20, 2008 and is as follows:
Season effects.

HeroEngine

HeroEngine is a 3D game engine and server technology platform originally developed by Simutronics Corporation specifically for building MMO-style games. At first developed for the company's own game "Hero's Journey", the engine won multiple awards at tradeshows, and has since been licensed by other companies such as BioWare Austin (which is using it for "") and Stray Bullet Games (for an as yet unnamed project).
On June 12, 2010, Idea Fabrik announced that it had purchased "the HeroEngine and HeroCloud game development technologies" as well as hired "the staff of Simutronics that was associated with the development and support of HeroEngine/HeroCloud".
Features.
The engine has online creation. For example, one developer can be creating a house and the entities inside, while another works on the landscaping and terrain around it. Each sees the other's work in real time.
The simulation and rendering processes of the engine are currently run on a single-thread. However, it is planned for there to be a multi-threaded release, but the publish date has not yet been determined.
Integration with other technologies.
HeroBlade contains integrated features such as custom scripting and collaborative project management, which allow developers to make notes directly onto the in-game levels for others to see. These notes can be attached to tasks to signal other developers that something specific needs to be worked on. HeroEngine also works with technology from third-party vendors, such as FMOD, PhysX, SpeedTree, Wwise, Scaleform, and Vivox, as well as having plugins for 3D Studio Max and Maya.
HeroCloud.
HeroCloud is a version of HeroEngine that is available for $99 per year, under the license that they receive 30% the money sales of any game made with it. It includes everything that a license to the HeroEngine has, except for access to the source code.

K. N. Nehru

K. N. Nehru is the Former minister for Transport in Tamil Nadu state of India. He was born in Neikulam on 09-November-1952. He has finished his school education. He has been elected to the Tamil Nadu assembly three times, twice from Lalgudi constituency and once from Tiruchy II constituency- which has changed to Trichy West He is currently residing at Trichy
He has been known to be associated with illegal Sand quarrying and has been known to have benefited terribly from that. Recently in the run up before assembly elections, the Election Commission officials retrieved close to 5 crore Rupees from one of the buses owned by KN.Nehru's relatives. KN. Nehru was Transport Minister of the state administration then. He of course conveniently rejected the charges.
Land Grabbing Charges & Arrest.
Mr. K.N.Nehru was arrested on 25 August 2011 on the charge of forcibly acquiring a piece of land from a doctor for building the party’s district office in Tiruchi.They were arrested by the City Crime Branch based on a complaint filed by a medical practitioner of Thuraiyur near Tiruchi, alleging that of land held by his family was illegally encroached upon and later taken over by Mr. Nehru an LOOSEructing the party office, Kalaignar Arivalayam, near the Chathram Bus Stand in the city.
Kalaignar Arivalayam was declared open by former Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi in September 2008. The building is spread over about of land and the value of the portion of land held by the doctor's family was allegedly estimated at Rs. 10 crore.
The land, the doctor alleged in his complaint, was illegally encroached upon during December 2006 by some persons on the instructions of Mr. Nehru. Subsequently, he, his wife and father were forcibly taken to the office of Mr. Nehru at Thillai Nagar by Mr. Anbazhagan and others. They were allegedly threatened there by Mr. Nehru, his brother K.N. Ramajeyam, Anbil Periyasamy, Anbazhagan and Kudamuritti Sekar, a party functionary.
The doctor claimed he was also assaulted on the occasion, resulting in his teeth being broken. He was forced to sign an unregistered agreement for the "sale" of his land to the DMK. Though an "advance" of Rs. 40 lakh was given to him, the money was robbed by DMK men when he was returning home.
On 7 September 2007, he was "taken" to Mr. Nehru’s office again when he and his wife were made to sign a sale deed in favour of the former Minister, on behalf of the party. The deed was registered without paying any compensation, it was alleged.
Police said Mr. Nehru and others were picked up after a preliminary investigation. Mr. Nehru was picked up by a police team from his house at Thillai Nagar in the city in a swift early morning operation and taken to the Armed Reserve Community Centre. He was held there for about a couple of hours before being produced before the Judicial Magistrate IV Pushparani at her house. He along with Mr.Periyasamy were remanded to custody till 8 September. They were later sent to the Cuddalore Central Prison.
As the news spread, a sizeable gathering of DMK supporters raised slogans against the government for foisting cases at the Armed Reserve Complex and also at the Magistrate’s house. They also attempted to block the police vehicle in which Mr. Nehru was being taken. Mr. Nehru stepped down from the vehicle to pacify the party men.
Four other accused, Mr. Anbazhagan, Mr. Kudamuritti Sekar, Sheriff and Mamundi were taken into custody later. A. Soundarapandian, sitting DMK MLA representing Lalgudi, Mr. Ramajeyam, Tamilmaran and Tamilselvan are the others cited as accused in the case.
A case has been registered under Sections 147 (rioting); 447 (criminal trespass); 363 (kidnapping); 342 (wrongful confinement); 325 (causing grievous hurt); 387 (causing fear of death or grievous hurt in order to commit extortion); 506 (ii) (criminal intimidation) and 392 (robbery) read with 120 (b) (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code.
The real estate firm TVH owned by K.N.Nehru holds most of grabbed lands .
He lost in 2011 assembly election and then came bi election also he lost.

Musée national Eugène Delacroix

The Musée national Eugène Delacroix, also known as the Musée Delacroix, is an art museum dedicated to painter Eugène Delacroix (1798–1863) and located in the 6th arrondissement at 6, rue de Furstenberg, Paris, France. It is open daily except Tuesday; an admission fee is charged.
History.
The museum is located in painter Eugène Delacroix's last apartment; he moved to this location on December 28, 1857, and remained until his death on August 13, 1863. In 1929, the Société des Amis d'Eugène Delacroix was formed to prevent the building's destruction; in 1952, the Société acquired the apartment, studio, and garden, and in 1954 donated the property to the French government. In 1971, the site became a national museum, and in 1999 its garden was renovated. Léon Printemps had his studio in this same building, where he died on 9 July 1945.
Collection.
Today the museum contains Delacroix's memorabilia and works, exhibiting pictures from nearly every phase of his career, including the artist's only three attempts at fresco from Valmont (1834); the "Education of the Virgin" painted in Nohant in 1842; and "Magdalene in the Desert" exhibited at the 1845 Salon.

Anyone may join the parade as it snakes its way to Lafayette Square to finish the festival with concerts, authentic Caribbean cuisine, arts and crafts.
Bayou Bacchanal is only one stop for the festival lovers. Throughout the year, party goers will follow the Caribbean party to cities all over North America. For example, a group of people may participate in the Caribbean festival in Toronto, Canada, drive to Atlanta, Georgia for another, afterward leave to Miami, Florida's event and then make a final stop in New Orleans, Louisiana for the Bayou Bacchanal. Every year almost every major city in North America holds a Caribbean festival. 
Bayou Bacchanal takes place every first Saturday of November where the weather is near perfect in New Orleans for outside activities.

Brianna Taylor

Brianna Taylor (born May 30, 1987) is a reality show personality, singer and songwriter, having appeared on both the fifth season of "American Idol" and "", the twentieth season of MTV's long-running reality television series, "The Real World". In 2008, she released her debut, self-titled EP, "Brianna Taylor", on Chamberlain Records; according to that label's website, she is now signed to Universal Music.
Early life.
Taylor is of African American, German, and Puerto Rican descent. Her mother, Yvonne, raised Brianna and her sister, Victoria, as a single mother. They lived first in the Mount Airy neighborhood of Philadelphia before moving to Warrington Township.
Taylor attended Central Bucks High School East in Buckingham Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, graduating in 2005. She also attended Golden Slipper Camp for Boys and Girls. There is where she found her love for singing.
Career.
Taylor never took singing lessons; her grandmother acted as her vocal coach. After gaining experience singing at weddings and shopping malls, she auditioned for the popular singing competition, "American Idol" during that show's fifth season and reached the Top 44 before eventually being eliminated.
Before auditioning for "The Real World" and eventually being cast in its 20th anniversary season, Taylor was an exotic dancer for two years at Double Visions in Horsham Township, Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia. While living in Philadelphia, Taylor maintained a volatile relationship with an ex-boyfriend, and at one point, a violent argument resulted in Taylor's arrest and eventual guilty plea to a reduced charge of harassment. The aftermath of the episode can be seen on her season of "The Real World". In the third episode of that season, she reveals that she had battled an addiction to crystal meth and cocaine as early as two months prior to being cast on the show.
During the show, Brianna develops a mutual attraction for fellow roommate Joey Kovar, but is later disturbed by how he behaves while intoxicated. She also returns to Philadelphia to resolve her legal troubles during the run of her season, and is picked up to record several songs of her own, as well as perform live with Alex Band, formerly of the band The Calling. In the show, she is also offered a song by Matthew Bair of the powerpop band Bandcamp.
Taylor's debut self-titled EP, "Brianna Taylor", was co-produced by Tomas Costanza, of the band Diffuser, and Matthew Bair, who is now a guitarist with Eve 6. The first single, "Summertime," was released in 2008. As of July 22, 2008, Brianna's self-titled EP was the 16th most-purchased album on iTunes and sold over 60,000 copies.
Taylor returned to MTV in order to participate in the eighteenth season of the show's long-running "The Real World/Road Rules Challenge", which premiered on September 30, 2009. She was in the challenger's team and was eliminated in the third episode.
On October 13, 2009, Taylor released her first full-length debut album, "Fireworks at the Fairground" via Chamberlain Records, featuring her new single "Criminal."

Iwate Medical University

History.
The institution has its origins in a private medical school founded in 1901. The school was closed in 1912, later re-established in 1928 as Iwate Medical College. In 1947 the college was reorganized into Iwate Medical University through Japanese educational reform.
Location.
The university is in the centre of Morioka City, the capital of Iwate Prefecture. In recent years the university has built a new campus in small town of Yahaba, some 10 km from the old campus. The new School of Pharmacy was opened at this new campus, and it is expected that the entire university will move to the new campus in the near future.
Facilities and education.
As its name suggests, the university specializes in health sciences. As of April 2008 the university comprised three schools: School of Medicine, School of Dentistry, and School of Pharmacy (the latter is the latest addition to the university). All instruction is conducted in Japanese.
The university runs a major teaching hospital which provides primary, secondary and tertiary health care for residents of Morioka city and the whole of Iwate prefecture. Although the university is relatively small and nowhere near the famous imperial colleges like Tokyo and Kyoto universities, it is well known in the eastern side of Japan for the competency of its graduates.
Due to its relatively small size, students have good access to facilities and the university boasts a superior instructor-to-student ratio. 
There are many sports fraternities at the university such as baseball (yakyu), football (sakkaa), etc. Students are free to join any of the fraternities. 
According to the Japanese Students Services Organization (JASSO), there were only two foreign students at the beginning of the academic year 2008, both at the graduate level. The first foreign doctoral (PhD) student to graduate from IMU was Denis Russa, a Monbukagakusho scholar from Tanzania who graduated in spring 2009. The number of foreign postdoctoral students joining the university has increased steadily over the years and it is therefore hoped that doctoral students will increase likewise.

The club was dissolved soon later, merging with Salthill Devon to form Galway F.C.. 
Ground.
Mervue's home ground is Fahy's Field. However, it did not meet League of Ireland requirements until the 2011 season, resulting in senior home games being played at Terryland Park. This has left Mervue with little or no fan base, and attendances are estimated at being the lowest in the League of Ireland. In the 2010 off-season, Mervue upgraded Fahy's Field to League of Ireland standard, meaning that 2011 season games could be played in Fahy's Field.

Areni

Areni (; formerly Arpa) is a village in the Vayots Dzor Province of Armenia. It is best known for its wine production, although the majority of wine produced locally is from the nearby village of Getap. The church of S. Astvatsatsin is a single-nave two-aisled domed Armenian church completed in the year 1321, and is located atop a plateau overlooking the Arpa River and Areni. It was designed by the architect and sculptor Momik Vardpet who is best known for his high-relief carvings at the monastery of Noravank (located approximately 6 kilometers southeast from Areni). Nearby are also the 13th century ruins of lord Tarsaitch Orbelian of Syunik's palace, moved from Yeghegis to Areni during that time. Ruins of a 13th-century bridge built by Bishop Sarkis in 1265-1287 are one kilometer northeast of the church. At the same location are the remains of an older bridge.
Copper Age excavations.
In 2007, an Armenian-Irish team decided to do test excavations in the cave site of Areni 1. Two test trenches in the front and rear galleries revealed Chalcolithic Age and Early Bronze Age layers dating back to 5000-4000 BCE. Excavations during 2007-2008 uncovered 3 pot burials in the rear chamber of the cave. Each pot contained a Copper Age human skull with no associated grave goods. All skulls belong to sub-adults of 9–16 years of age. These are currently being analyzed by the team's biological anthropologist. Remarkably, one skull contained a piece of a well-preserved brain tissue. This is the oldest known human brain from the Old World.
The cave has also offered surprising new insights into the origins of modern civilizations, such as evidence of a wine-making enterprise and an array of culturally diverse pottery. Excavations also yielded an extensive array of Copper Age artifacts dating to between 6,200 and 5,900 years ago. The new discoveries within the cave move early bronze-age cultural activity in Armenia back by about 800 years. Additional discoveries at the site include metal knives, seeds from more than 30 types of fruit, remains of dozens of cereal species, rope, cloth, straw, grass, reeds and dried grapes and prunes
In January 2011 archaeologists announced the discovery of the earliest known winery, the Areni-1 winery, seven months after the world's oldest leather shoe, the Areni-1 shoe, was discovered in the same cave. The winery, which is over six-thousand years old, contains a wine press, fermentation vats, jars, and cups. Archaeologists also found grape seeds and vines of the species "Vitis vinifera". Patrick McGovern, a biomolecular anthropologist at the University of Pennsylvania, commenting on the importance of the find, said, "The fact that winemaking was already so well developed in 4000 BC suggests that the technology probably goes back much earlier."

2010–11 UEFA Champions League

The 2010–11 UEFA Champions League was the 56th season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 19th under the current UEFA Champions League format. The final was held at Wembley Stadium in London on 28 May 2011, where Barcelona defeated Manchester United 3–1. Internazionale were the defending champions, but were eliminated by Schalke 04 in the quarter-finals. The winner - Barcelona, earned a berth to the 2011 UEFA Super Cup and 2011 FIFA Club World Cup.
Association team allocation.
A total of 76 teams participated in the 2010–11 Champions League, from 52 UEFA associations (Liechtenstein organises no domestic league competition). Associations were allocated places according to their 2009 UEFA country coefficient, which took into account their performance in European competitions from 2004–05 to 2008–09.
Below is the qualification scheme for the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League:
Distribution.
Since the winners of the 2009–10 UEFA Champions League, Internazionale, obtained a place in the group stage through their domestic league placing, the reserved title holder spot in the group stage was effectively vacated. To compensate:
Teams.
League positions of the previous season shown in parentheses.
TH Title Holder
Round and draw dates.
All draws held at UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland unless stated otherwise.
Seeding.
The draws for the qualifying rounds, the play-off round and the group stage are all seeded based on the 2010 UEFA club coefficients. The coefficients are calculated on the basis of a combination of 20% of the value of the respective national association’s coefficient for the period from 2005–06 to 2009–10 inclusive and the clubs’ individual performances in the UEFA club competitions during the same period. Clubs are ordered by their coefficients and then divided into pots as required.
In the draws for the qualifying rounds and the play-off round, the teams are divided evenly into one seeded and one unseeded pot, based on their club coefficients. A seeded team is drawn against an unseeded team, with the order of legs in each tie also being decided randomly. Due to the limited time between matches, the draws for the second and third qualifying rounds take place before the results of the previous round are known. The seeding in each draw is carried out under the assumption that all of the highest-ranked clubs of the previous round are victorious. If a lower-ranked club is victorious, it simply takes the place of its defeated opponent in the next round. Moreover, in the third qualifying round and play-off round, champion clubs and non-champion clubs are kept separated. Prior to these draws, UEFA may form "groups" in accordance with the principles set by the Club Competitions Committee, but they are purely for convenience of the draw and do not resemble any real groupings in the sense of the competition, while ensuring that teams from the same association not drawn against each other.
In the draw for the group stage, the 32 teams are split into four pots of eight teams, based on their club coefficients, with the title holder automatically placed into Pot 1. Each group contains one team from each pot, but teams from the same association cannot be drawn into the same group. The draw is controlled in order to split teams of the same national association evenly between Groups A-D and Groups E-H, where the two sets of groups alternate between playing on Tuesdays and Wednesdays for each matchday.
In the draw for the first knockout stage, the eight group winners are seeded, and the eight group runners-up are unseeded. A seeded team is drawn against an unseeded team, with the seeded team hosting the second leg. Teams from the same group or the same association cannot be drawn against each other.
In the draws for the quarter-finals onwards, there are no seedings, and teams from the same group or the same association may be drawn with each other.
Qualifying rounds.
In the qualifying and play-off rounds, teams play against each other over two legs on a home-and-away basis.
The draws for the first two qualifying rounds were held on 21 June 2010 by UEFA General Secretary Gianni Infantino and Michael Heselschwerdt, Head of Club Competitions, while the draw for the third qualifying round was held on 16 July 2010 by UEFA General Secretary Gianni Infantino and Giorgio Marchetti, Competitions Director.
First qualifying round.
The first legs were planned to be played on 29 and 30 June, and the second legs were played on 6 and 7 July 2010. However, the first match (29 June – FC Santa Coloma vs. Birkirkara) of the entire competition was cancelled due to the pitch being declared unfit.
Second qualifying round.
The first legs were played on 13 and 14 July, and the second legs were played on 20 and 21 July 2010.
Third qualifying round.
The third qualifying round were split into two separate sections: one for champions and one for non-champions. The losing teams in both sections entered the play-off round of the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League. The first legs were played on 27 and 28 July, and the second legs were played on 3 and 4 August 2010.

Play-off round.
The draw for the play-off round was held on 6 August 2010 by UEFA General Secretary Gianni Infantino and UEFA Competitions Director Giorgio Marchetti. The play-off round was split into two separate sections: one for champions and one for non-champions. The losing teams in both sections entered the group stage of the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League. The first legs were played on 17 and 18 August, and the second legs were played on 24 and 25 August 2010.
Following a trial at the previous year's UEFA Europa League, UEFA announced that in both the 2010–11 and 2011–12 competitions, two extra officials would be used – with one on each goal line.

Group stage.
The 32 clubs were drawn into eight groups of four on 26 August 2010 in Monaco. In each group, teams play against each other home-and-away in a round-robin format. The matchdays are 14–15 September, 28–29 September, 19–20 October, 2–3 November, 23–24 November, and 7–8 December 2010. The group winners and runners-up advance to the round of 16, while the third-placed teams enter the round of 32 of the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League.
If two or more teams are equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following criteria are applied to determine the rankings (in descending order):
Bursaspor, Hapoel Tel Aviv, Braga, Tottenham Hotspur, Twente and Žilina made their debut in the group stage. Bursaspor, Hapoel Tel Aviv, and Žilina came last in their respective groups, Twente and Braga came third in their respective groups and dropped into the knockout stages of the Europa League, and Tottenham Hotspur came first in their group and continued to play in the knockout stages of the tournament.
Knockout phase.
In the knockout phase, teams play against each other over two legs on a home-and-away basis, except for the one-match final.
The draw for the round of 16 was held on 17 December 2010. The draws for the quarter-finals, semi-finals and final (to determine the "home" team) was held on 18 March 2011.
Round of 16.
The first legs of the round of 16 were played on 15, 16, 22 and 23 February, and the second legs were played on 8, 9, 15 and 16 March 2011.
Quarter-finals.
The first legs were played on 5 and 6 April, and the second legs were played on 12 and 13 April 2011.
Semi-finals.
The first legs were played on 26 and 27 April, and the second legs were played on 3 and 4 May 2011.
Final.
The 2011 UEFA Champions League Final was played on 28 May 2011 at Wembley Stadium in London, England.
Top goalscorers.
The top scorers from the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League (excluding qualifying rounds and play-off round) are as follows:
Prize money.
Just for being in the group stage, each club received €3.9 million (compared with €3.8 million last season 2009-2010), followed by €550,000 for each group match they played, or €3.3 million for the whole group stage, giving them each a total of €7.2m in participation bonuses. In addition, each club had the possibility of netting up to €4.8m in group stage performance bonuses (€800,000 for a win; €400,000 for a draw). Real Madrid CF took the most from this pot, with a near-maximum €4.4m. A place in the round of 16 was worth €3 million, in the quarter-ﬁnals €3.3 million and in the semi-ﬁnals €4.2 million.
The overall winners, FC Barcelona, received an additional €9 million, bringing their ﬁxed sumbonuses to €30.7m (out of a maximum €31.5m). Manchester United FC, the runners-up, received a ﬁnal match bonus of €5.6 million.
The second payments category, the market pool, depends primarily on the value of the clubs’ domestic markets. If an association is represented by more than one club, however, the clubs’ shares are calculated, ﬁ rst, on the basis of their position in the 
previous season’s domestic championship and, second, on the basis of the number of matches they play in the competition (group stage onwards). With €27.023m, Chelsea FC received the largest market pool share of all the clubs in the 2010/11 
UEFA Champions League. In addition, the clubs all keep their own gate receipts.

Hieronymus van Beverningh

Hieronymus van Beverningh (sometimes spelled Beverningk) (Gouda, April 25, 1614 – Oud Teylingen,October 30, 1690) was a prominent Dutch regent, diplomat, amateur botanist, and maecenas, who lived during the Dutch Golden Age.
Biography.
Early life.
Beverningh was the son of Melchior Beverningh, a captain in the States Army and Sibilla Standert. His grandfather, Johan Beverningh, was a Prussian officer who had taken a commission in the States Army and reached the rank of lieutenant-general of artillery.
He studied at the Latin school in his birthplace Gouda under Jacobus Hovius and at the University of Leiden. After his studies he made the usual "grand tour" of a Dutch gentleman to France. He married Johanna le Gillon on April 4, 1655, a marriage that was to remain childless.
Beverningh was coopted in the Gouda "vroedschap" and elected "schepen" in 1645. The very next year he was sent as a deputy to the States of Holland. In 1651 he represented the province of Holland in the "Groote Vergadering" (the "Great Assembly", a kind of constitutional assembly) of that year, which inaugurated the First Stadtholderless Period in the Dutch Republic. In 1653 (the year in which Johan de Witt became Grand Pensionary) Beverningh was made a member of the Holland delegation in the States-General of the Netherlands. De Witt and he were to become close associates in the States Party.
The Peace of Westminster and the Act of Seclusion.
De Witt would have been happy to have a sent a single negotiator, but the other provinces would not agree, so together with another Holland Regent, Willem Nieupoort, and representatives of the provinces of Zeeland (Paulus van de Perre) and Friesland (Allart Pieter van Jongestall), Beverningh was sent as a plenipotentiary to the Commonwealth of England to negotiate the Treaty of Westminster (1654) that was to end the First Anglo-Dutch War. The already complicated negotiations were made more difficult when they reached an apparent impasse over the English demand that the young Prince of Orange William III (three years of age at the time) would be excluded from the offices that his father, William II, Prince of Orange and other ancestors had held in the Republic, like that of Stadtholder of Holland and Zeeland, and Captain general of the Union. To De Witt, and his States-Party faction of Holland regents, like Cornelis de Graeff, this demand was not unacceptable, but they knew that the other provinces would consider it an intolerable intervention in Dutch internal affairs. To overcome this obstacle to a peace that both parties by now strongly desired De Witt therefore engaged in a brazen intrigue. He secretly arranged that the two Holland negotiators would engage in surreptitious parallel negotiations with Oliver Cromwell behind the back of Jongestal (Van der Perre had died by that time).
Cromwell and Beverningh agreed to a secret annex to the draft treaty, that would become known as the Act of Seclusion. This Act was to be solely signed and ratified by the States of Holland, without the knowledge of the other Dutch provinces. It contained the solemn undertaking of the States of Holland that they would never appoint William stadtholder in their province, and would bar his appointment to high federal office in the Republic. After the States General ratified the treaty, without the secret annex, the States of Holland convened in secret session a few days later to discuss the secret annex. It was ratified over the objection of five Orangist cities by the States, and the instrument of ratification was sent to Beverningh in London, however with the instruction not to hand it over, unless it was absolutely necessary.
Meanwhile, the clerk of De Witt, Jan van Messem, betrayed the secret existence of the Act to the stadtholder of Friesland, William's kinsman Willem Frederik of Nassau-Dietz. The Frisian States now demanded an inquiry in the States General into the conduct of Beverningh and the other negotiators. The States-General instructed the negotiators to hand over their papers, including the instrument of ratification "unless that no longer was in their possession". De Witt, always a master of the legalistic phrase, was the author of this clause. He also persuaded the States-General to send the instruction in cipher, under a letter in plaintext in his own hand, warning Beverningh of what was afoot. Thus forewarned Beverningh immediately handed over the instrument of ratification to Cromwell, while the instructions were still laboriously being deciphered by the Dutch delegation. He therewith confronted the States-General with a "fait accompli".
The resulting scandal was eventually laid to rest, but the States of Friesland blocked Beverningh's appointment as "thesaurier-generaal" (Treasurer) of the Union, that was first proposed by Holland in 1654, until 1657 (during which time the function was formally left vacant).
Later official career.
Besides his office of Treasurer, which he would fulfil till 1665, and that of representative in the States-General, Beverningh regularly undertook important diplomatic missions for the Republic. The most important were his negotiations with the Elector of Brandenburg in 1665 about an alliance during the Second Anglo-Dutch War and the peace negotiations with the Prince-Bishop of Münster in the same year. In 1667 he led the Dutch delegation that negotiated the Treaty of Breda that ended that war with England. In 1668 he helped negotiate the Triple Alliance (1668) and the ensuing Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. In 1674 he led the Dutch delegation that negotiated the Treaty of Westminster (1674) that ended the Third Anglo-Dutch War. Finally, in 1678 he helped negotiate the Treaty of Nijmegen that ended the Franco-Dutch War
Meanwhile, he was appointed "schout" and later "burgemeester" of his native city. He acted as "gedeputeerde-te-velde" (a kind of political commissar) at the headquarters of William III in the campaign against the French during the Year of Disaster, 1672. After the popular revolution that brought William to power as stadtholder, and brought about the fall of the De Witt regime, Beverningh quickly changed sides from the States party (of which he had been a prominent exponent) and joined the new regime. He was one of the Gouda regents who welcomed the new stadtholder at a festive banquet in the city.
Final years.
After he had negotiated a commercial treaty with Sweden in 1679, he retired from public life. He had been appointed a regent of Leiden University in 1673. In these later years he embarked on a scientific career that would bring him plaudits from such luminaries as Carl Linnaeus, who would later credit the discovery of a nasturtium ("Tropaeus majus") to him.> He maintained a botanical garden at his estate "Oud-Teylingen" (or "Lokhorst") not far from Leiden that contained many rare plants. This garden inspired the German botanist Jacobus Breynius to write his "Prodromus fasciculi rariorum plantarum in Hortis Hollandiae" (vol. I 1680, vol. II, 1689), which he dedicated to Beverningh.
Beverningh also acted as a maecenas, enabling the Dutch botanist Paul Herman to travel to the East Indies, a journey that resulted in his "Paradisus Batavus" (1698), a standard work about orchids. He helped finance the purchase of the library of Isaac Vossius for the Leiden University Library.
While helping to catalog this library, Beverningh fell ill (possibly after he fell off a stepladder). He died at his estate after a short illness in October, 1690. He was buried in the tomb he had bought in 1668 from the Blois-van-Treslong family, in the Janskerk (Gouda).

Andrea Meyer

Andrea Meyer (born March 27, 1968) is an American journalist, screenwriter, and author of the chick lit novel, "Room For Love".
Early personal and professional life.
Meyer grew up in Los Angeles, California. She went to college at University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) and spent her junior year studying at the Sorbonne in Paris. After graduating from UCSB in 1990 with a BA in English with honors, Meyer traveled for six months in Europe, eventually getting a job bartending in a wine bar in London. She then moved to Paris, where she spent two years teaching English and doing translations. Meyer returned to the United States in 1993 to get her Master's degree in English at New York University. Upon graduation, she had a series of jobs, assisting playwright, composer and theater director Elizabeth Swados and a theater and film literary agent at ICM, and then in film production, on such projects as a French-language feature, Tempéte dans un vers d'eau, the Discovery Channel documentary "" and the HBO documentary "Daughter of Suicide". She also produced and helped program the Avignon/New York Film Festival in 1998, as well as being a juror at numerous film festivals.
After leaving her job at ICM in 1995, Andrea shared a cab home from the airport with the editor in chief of "Hamptons" magazine, who offered her a job writing for the magazine. She wrote her first article about Todd Solondz's film "Welcome to the Dollhouse". Andrea subsequently got assignments covering film for such publications as independent film website indieWIRE and eventually became a regular theater critic for "The Resident", a New York weekly. Eventually, she became a regular contributor to such publications as "Time Out New York" and the "New York Post". In 2000, Meyer became the Managing Editor of the IFC's print publication "IFC Rant", which was published by indieWIRE. She worked there for two years before leaving to pursue a freelance writing career.
Author.
In the spring of 2003, after getting evicted from her apartment and moving into an apartment she bought in the East Village, Andrea wrote a story for the "New York Post", in which she pretended to look for a roommate as a ploy to meet men. She decided to adapt the article into a novel (about a New York film journalist named Jacquie Stuart who writes an article for which she pretends to look for a roommate as a ploy to meet men). She began writing the book at the home of her friend and writing partner Kerry Eielson in Southwest France, with whom she was completing a screenplay called "The Alpha Girls".
Back in New York, Meyer worked on her novel while covering film, entertainment and social trends for such publications as "Time Out New York", "Variety", "Interview", "The Village Voice", the "New York Post", the "Daily News" and "Fitness" magazine and writing celebrity and women's interest stories for "Glamour". A regular job emerged writing movie reviews, interviews and a sex and the movies column called Hot & Bothered for IFC.com; and, from December through February, she reported on the Sundance Film Festival for "The Sundance Daily Insider". 
Andrea completed the first draft of her novel "Room for Love" days after she married cinematographer Harlan Bosmajian in 2005. The book was published by St. Martin's Press in 2007. In September 2006, Meyer and her husband moved to Los Angeles, where her history professor father and psychiatric social worker mother still live. Her younger sister, Katya, a commercial producer, moved into Meyer's apartment in the East Village. Meyer is working on her follow-up novel and writing a psychological thriller for MGM.

"Some Boys Got It, Most Men Don't" is the fourth album released by the North Vancouver punk band d.b.s. It was released by New Disorder Records in June 1999. This is the first d.b.s. recording to feature new bassist Ryan Angus, who replaced Dhani Borges.
The album marks a turning point in the band's development, and had some post-hardcore influence. Tracks such as "…And Then I Awoke" and "Past Friendships" included acoustic guitar; these tracks have been likened to the sound of The Promise Ring and Jawbreaker, respectively. The album also received comparisons to some emo hardcore bands on Jade Tree Records, such as Lifetime and Kid Dynamite, as well as Converge. For the final five minutes of "A Foundation for Positive Change", there is heavy feedback, a piano playing a repeated theme, and fuzzy sampled voice clips—resulting in a more experimental sound than the band's earlier recordings, and presaging the sampled music that band member Andy Dixon would later compose.

"If Life Were a Result, We'd All Be Dead" is the fifth and final full-length album released by the North Vancouver punk band d.b.s. It was released by Crap Records in February 2000.

The songs were intended to be released on various singles, but this plan never came to fruition.
The band's music on this album has been likened to Lifetime and Jawbreaker, marking an "awkward transition" from the political lyrics of "I Is for Insignificant" to the more personal lyrics of "Some Boys Got It, Most Men Don't".

Bill and Ben Party

The Bill and Ben Party was a New Zealand joke political party formed in 2008 and voluntarily deregistered in 2010. The party's leaders were Jamie Linehan and Ben Boyce ("Bill" and Ben) of the TV3 satirical sports show "Pulp Sport". In the 2008 general election the party secured 0.56% of the vote, outpolling every other party not in parliament prior to the election (New Zealand First, a party in parliament prior to the election, failed to gain representation in the subsequent parliament). It gained the ninth highest number of votes out of the 19 parties standing for election.
As a joke political party, it shared a rich and varied heritage with the former McGillicuddy Serious Party and Imperial British Conservative Party, both humorous political entities that contested New Zealand general elections from the 1970s until the late 1990s.
On 1 July 2008 the party applied for registration with the Electoral Commission, which would allow it to contest the party vote. The party was registered by the Electoral Commission on 29 July 2008. On 31 July 2008 the party applied to register a logo with the Electoral Commission. 
The party states that it managed to secure its required 500 members for Electoral Act registration after locating the requisite number of inebriated university students outside a student drinking establishment.
2008 general election.
For the 2008 general election, the party chose not to apply for the $10,000 in advertising money that all political parties are entitled to. It felt this was a waste of taxpayer's money, and self-funded its advertising. This also meant that it did not qualify for a TVNZ Political Party Opening Address.
It stood on a "no policies, no promises, no disappointment" platform and had the slogan "We're putting the party back in political party". It is understood New Zealand First Party Leader Winston Peters took exception to one of its election signs, which used the phrase "C'mon, you voted Winston in".
In the election on 8 November, the party secured 13,016 votes (0.56% of votes), allowing a refund of the $1000 party registration fee. It put the money on the bar in Invercargill as it received more votes from there than anywhere else.
Even though it was a joke political party, it out-polled all but one party (New Zealand First) that did not gain representation in the last election, including every other new party: the New Zealand Pacific Party, The Kiwi Party, The Family Party, the Workers Party and the Residents Action Movement. It gained the ninth highest number of votes out of the 19 parties in the election, and would have earned a seat if there had been no electoral threshold. It spent NZ$3,777 on advertising, $0.29 per vote, making it the most effective party in terms of dollars per vote.
Due to the way that mixed member proportional representation works, had the party crossed the minimum 5% threshold required to be admitted to parliament without an electorate seat, the total number of MPs would have been reduced by about four (an "underhang"). This is because 5% of the vote would entitle it to approximately six MPs but it had only two candidates (Bill and Ben) on its party list. However, the underhang would have partially been cancelled out by the Maori Party's overhang, having won five electorate seats when entitled to only three by the party vote.
2009 Mount Albert by-election.
Ben stood in the Mount Albert by-election on 13 June 2009 and secured 151 votes (0.76% of the vote), coming fifth. This is an improvement on the 0.38% party vote obtained in Mt Albert at the 2008 election. He out-polled the candidate from United Future New Zealand, a former MP, and every other micro party and independent candidate, including the Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party and The Kiwi Party. 
Deregistration.
On 17 March 2010 the party applied to the Electoral Commission to be deregistered, which took effect on 29 April 2010.
