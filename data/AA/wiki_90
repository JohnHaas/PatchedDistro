Umar al-Tilmisani

'Umar al-Tilmisani (, ; most often transliterated as "Omar el Telmesany" or "Telmesani ") (4 November 1904-22 May 1986) was the third General Guide (Murshid al-'Am) of the Egyptian Muslim Brothers. He headed the Egyptian Islamist organization from 1972 until 1986. Al-Tilmisani (his name is a variation on Tlemceni, reflecting his family origin in the Western Algerian city of that name) headed the Muslim Brothers during a period of cooperation and, some observers suggest, cooptation by the Egyptian state. While the Brothers were not precisely legal during Tilmisani's term, they were tolerated and encouraged by President Anwar al-Sadat as a bulwark against both leftist opponents and more extremist Islamists.
Biography.
Al-Tilmisani was born in the Darb al-Ahmar district of Cairo in 1904. A lawyer, al-Tilmisani joined the Brothers in 1933, and was inducted into the organization by its founding General Guide, Hassan al-Banna. 
Al-Tilmisani was from a family of prominent landowners, which owned 300 feddans (acres) and seven houses. His deputy, and a later successor as General Guide, Mustafa Mashhur, was also from a family of wealthy landowners. Their prominence and social status led historian Robert Springborg to conclude at the end of the 1980s that, "It can reasonably be claimed that those currently in control of the Muslim Brothers are of the Islamic infitah bourgeoisie who 'bought' the organization with resources acquired through collaboration with the Sadat regime". 
Despite heading the group during this period of cooperation with the state, al-Tilmisani was imprisoned three times, once in 1954, as an activist during the difficult Nasser years, and twice while at the head of the group, during Sadat's mass roundup of opponents in 1981, and again under Hosni Mubarak in 1984.

EIF4G

(eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma) is a protein involved in bringing mRNA to the ribosome for translation, in general based on mRNA's distinctive guanosine cap. Species versions of eIF4G have been studied in everything from humans, to yeast, to wheat. However, eIF4G is exclusively found in domain Eukarya, not in domains Bacteria or Archaea (these do not have capped mRNA). As such be aware that when eIF4G is spoken of in this article, the statements will apply to many variants but may not hold for all, and when comparing among species comparisons are relative to human eIF4G 1.
In all species, eIF4G strongly associates with the protein that directly binds the mRNA cap: eIF4E. These two together are known as the complex eIF4F (in general, also in association with the mRNA unwinding protein eIF4A).
Within the cell eIF4G is found primarily in the cytoplasm, usually bound to eIF4E; however, it is also found in the nucleus where its function is unknown. Though in the nucleus it has been found to associate with the splicing complex, it does not appear to be involved directly in RNA splicing. It also appears to have a role in nonsense-mediated decay.
History.
eIF4G stands for eukaryotic initiation factor 4 gamma (typically gamma is now replaced by G in the literature). Named so because it was initially isolated by fractionation (collecting small portions of fluid that had been separated on a column), it happened to be contained in fraction 4 gamma, and was involved in eukaryotic translation initiation.
eIF4G Binding Partners.
eIF4G has been found to associate with myriad other proteins: eIF4E, MNK-1, eIF4A, CBP80, CBP20, PABP, and eIF3. eIF4G also directly binds mRNA and has multiple positively charged regions for this function (note: RNA is negatively charged, so RNA binding regions are usually very positively charged). Various IRESs also bind eIF4G directly, as do BTE CITEs.
Some RNAs that do not have caps (such as those containing IRESs) bind eIF4G specifically (in preference to other RNA-binding proteins).
eIF4G in Translation Initiation.
eIF4G essentially serves the function of bringing mRNA to the 40S ribosome.
In essence, there are 3 ways that the 40S ribosome can come to recognize the start codon: scanning, internal entry, and shunting. Scanning is where the 40S ribosome slides along the RNA until recognizing a start site (typically an AUG sequence in "good context"). Internal entry is where the 40S ribosome does not start from the beginning (5' end) of the mRNA but instead starts from somewhere in the middle. Shunting is where after the 40S ribosome starts sliding along the mRNA it "jumps" or skips large sections; the mechanism for this is still unclear. eIF4G is required for all these types of initiation (with the exception of internal initiation by HCV or Cripavirus IRES initiation).
eIF4G in Disease.
eIF4G has been implicated in breast cancer. It appears in increased levels in certain types of breast cancer (and others) and increases IRES containing mRNA production; these mRNAs produce hypoxia and stress related proteins that encourage blood vessel invasion (which is important for cancer cells—requiring large amounts of nutrients to divide quickly and form sizable tumors).
Role in Aging.
Regulation of tranlsation initiation by eIF4G is vital for protein synthesis in developing organisms, for example yeast and nematodes. Complete removal of eIF4G is lethal in yeast. In the round worm, C. elegans, knockout of eIF4G leads to animals that cannot develop past the early larval stage (L2) of development. The critical role of eIF4G in development appears to be reversed in adulthood, when eIF4G dysregulation negatively impacts lifespan and increases susceptibility to certain aging-related diseases (see eIF4G in diseases above). Inhibiting eIF4G during adulthood in C. elegans drastically extends lifespan, comparable to the lifespan increase exhibited during dietary restriction. In addition, inhibiting eIF4G reduces overall protein translation, while preferentially translating mRNA of genes important for responding to stress and against those associated with growth and reproduction. Thus eIF4G appears to control differential mRNA translation during periods or growth and stress, which may ultimately lead to age related decline.
Importance in Virology.
As previously mentioned, eIF4G is bound by IRESs, which were initially discovered in viruses. Some viral IRESs directly bind eIF4G, and co-opt it for gaining access to the ribosome. Some cellular RNAs also contain IRESs (including eIF4G itself).
Some viruses do this by cutting off part of eIF4G such that eIF4E no longer binds it. This has the effect of preventing most cellular mRNAs from binding eIF4G (which require eIF4E to ride along on eIF4G); however, the few cellular mRNAs with IRESs still translate under these conditions.
Binding sites for viral IRES's: EMCV IRES aa 746-949.

National Consumer Agency

The National Consumer Agency (NCA) () is a statutory body that defends consumer interests in Ireland.
Background.
The NCA's origins can be traced to the setting up of the Consumer Strategy Group (CSG) in March 2004.
The CSG presented its report, “Making Consumers Count”, to the then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Micheál Martin, in April 2005. Among the report's key recommendations was the establishment of a new agency to champion consumer rights.
The NCA was set up on an interim basis in May 2005, and established on a statutory footing on 1 May 2007. Its first chief executive was Ann Fitzgerald, a former chief executive of the Irish Association of Investment Managers. She also chaired the Consumer Strategy Group.
The Irish government announced in its 2009 Budget on 14 October 2008 that the NCA would be amalgamated with the Competition Authority, as part of a rationalisation programme that will reduce the number of state agencies in the country by 41.
The NCA's campaigns to date include naming and shaming retailers who are caught breaking consumer law, preventing car dealers "clocking" second-hand cars (altering vehicles' odometers), and intervention in high-profile consumer disputes including ones with NTL Ireland, Aer Lingus and MCD Promoters These interventions resulted in speedy and satisfactory resolutions to the benefit of consumers.
http://www.irishtimes.com/news/health/consumer-agency-pulls-drug-price-survey-over-errors-1.1343496
The agency has also carried out a series of price comparison surveys between leading supermarket chains, and cross-border comparisons of grocery items in stores' branches in the Republic and Northern Ireland.
On 2 September 2008 the agency published draft guidelines for the retail sector about how they should advertise price reductions, and related matters such as how long an item needs to be on sale at a higher price before advertising it with a reduced price comparison.
In December the same year there was a nationwide withdrawal of pigmeat from retail outlets after a dioxin contamination scare. The NCA successfully campaigned for full compensation for consumers after initial reluctance by some supermarket chains to refund products that were not their own brands.
On 18 June 2009, Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan TD for the Irish Government established a single fully integrated regulatory institution, the Central Bank of Ireland.
As part of this change, the Financial Regulator's consumer information and education role was reassigned to the National Consumer Agency.
On 16 August 2010 the NCA published its response to the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government's Review of the Retail Planning Guidelines (RPGs) Issues Paper.
ConsumerProperty.ie.
In late September 2008 the National Consumer Agency launched a guide and a dedicated website, ConsumerProperty.ie, for people living in or planning on buying multi-unit dwellings. The website and guide have information and tipson consumers' rights and responsibilities if living in apartments, gated communities and other multi-unit developments.
The guide, "Buying and Living in a Multi-Unit Development Property" in Ireland, is available in booklet format or as a download from the website. It contains information on legal terms, Property management companies and agents, service charges, sinking funds, the function of developers, identifying defects (snagging), insurance and fire safety.
Economiser.
On 30 March 2010 the NCA launched the Economiser. This interactive tool advises consumers how much more or less they are spending than the average most relevant to them in Ireland, based on the profiling information they have provided.
This unique tool addresses five key expenditure areas:
Shop Smart.
In April 2010 the NCA launched an interactive game set in a virtual shopping centre called Shop Smart. It tests young consumers' knowledge of their consumer rights and consumer issues in Ireland.
The game is aimed at Irish Junior Certificate and Leaving Certificate students who are studying Home Economics, Business Studies and Civic, Social and Political Education (CSPE).

Kryłów is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Mircze, within Hrubieszów County, Lublin Voivodeship, in eastern Poland, close to the border with Ukraine. It lies approximately, south-east of Hrubieszów, and south-east of the regional capital Lublin.
Jewish Community.
The Jewish population numbered 750 Jews in 1921. Many Jews had left the village during World War I because of its proximity to the battlefront and moved to larger towns in the Lublin district, particularly Hrubieszow. In the inter-war years the Jewish community continued its traditional crafts and trading in the village. Their way of life was religious and the Zionist movement also exerted considerable influence. At the end of September, 1939 the village was occupied by the Germans. Many Jews fled across the Bug River into what is now the Ukraine but at the time was a part of Poland.
The remainder were herded into a ghetto. The Jewish community was wiped out in the summer of 1942. It is unclear how the Jews of the town were exterminated, except that some were sent to the Belzec extermination camp while others were murdered in the town itself. The only survivors were those who managed to escape to the woods.
Castle.
There is a castle on an island on the Bug River. The castle was built in the 14th century by J. Ostroróg. In the 17th century the Radziejowski family extended the castle and added reinforcements. The castle was destroyed in the middle of the 17th century. The castle, largely in disrepair, is yet to be archeologically investigated. It's said to be haunted by the ghost of an owner's daughter.

A Message to Your Heart

"A Message to Your Heart", written and composed by Paul Curtis, was the United Kingdom's entry at the Eurovision Song Contest 1991, performed by Samantha Janus. Paul Curtis also penned the previous year's entry, "Give a Little Love Back to the World."
Samantha Janus won the right to perform at Rome by winning the UK national final, "A Song for Europe", where she was the third singer to perform. As in the previous three years, the winner was picked via a nationwide telephone vote. Samantha Janus won over second-place finisher Brendan Faye by only 13,000 votes, in the slimmest margin since the telephone vote was introduced.
At Rome, the song was performed twentieth on the night in March 1991, after Spain's Sergio Dalma with "Bailar pegados", and before Cyprus's Elena Patroklou with "SOS." At the end of judging that evening, "A Message to Your Heart" took the tenth-place slot with 47 points. It was the worst showing for the United Kingdom since 1987, and resulted in the 1992 "Song for Europe" being retooled as far as telephone voting was concerned.
Like the previous year, composer Paul Curtis submitted a topical entry for consideration; this time, the subjects were the less fortunate, suffering from poverty and starvation. Janus sung of the contrasts between the people who "are hungry just from being born", and the people who have too much, with "their only hunger being greed." The "message to heart" refers to Janus imploring the better-off to, at the very least, say a prayer for the less fortunate, ending with the well-known John Bradford quotation, "There but for the grace of God, go I." 
In a somewhat ironic twist, the melody of the song is up-tempo. On the night of the Contest, Janus was dressed in a pink mini-dress, flanked by three women (Zoe Picot, Lucy Moorby, and Nikki Belsher) in white mini-dresses. Janus was also joined by two other "ghost" backing singers, masked by a music stand at the back of the stage; Kit Rolfe who had competed for the UK before in 1984 with the song "Love Games" (which, it was claimed, had also used "ghost" singers offstage), and Hazell Dean, who had worked extensively with Stock, Aitken and Waterman in the eighties.
After Eurovision, the song placed at #30 on the UK Singles Chart, and was in the chart for 3 weeks.
Janus went on to become a successful actress, starring in the sitcom "Game On" and the soap "EastEnders". Despite her achievements, her entry into the Eurovision is frequently remarked upon. She has said regarding the experience that her failure in the contest devastated her at the time and thought it would spell the end of her career. She has also called her appearance 'ridiculous', in that she was dressed in a pink mini-dress while singing about starving children and says the lyrics of the song are burned into her memory forever.

Terry Hermansson

Terry "The Rock" Hermansson is a former New Zealand rugby league player. An international representative prop forward, he played club football in England, Australia and New Zealand.
Playing career.
Hermansson was a Schoolboy Kiwi in 1982 and made the Junior Kiwis in 1985.
Nicknamed "The Rock" he spent his early years playing for the great Canterbury Rugby League sides of the 1990s before moving overseas to play professionally, first for Doncaster in England and then for the South Sydney Rabbitohs in the then NSWRL Premiership. At the height of the Super League war he moved to the Sydney City Roosters and played alongside fellow Kiwi prop Jason Lowrie. He returned to the Rabbitohs in 1998 before signing for the Adelaide Rams for the 1999 season.
When the Rams were closed down before the season he signed a two year contract with the Auckland Warriors, returning home to play in front of the New Zealand fans. In 1999 he was Clubman of the Year Award.
Representative career.
Terry played for the New Zealand Kiwis on four occasions between 1994 and 1999, with the Superleague war blocking him from making more appearances. During the war he played for an Australian Rugby League "Rest of the World" side that took on the Australian Kangaroos.
In 2000 he represented the Aotearoa Māori at the 2000 Rugby League World Cup. He retired in 2000 after the World Cup.

On retirement, he returned to his native Christchurch and has concentrated on coaching, winning several scholarships to improve his skills. He has coached the Canterbury under-18 side and in 2005 he coached the New Zealand under-16 side when they toured Australia.
In 2004 Hermansson was the assistant coach of the New Zealand Māori side in the Pacific Cup.

Far right in Poland

Like in other nations across the world, there are several far-right organizations in Poland. Public support of these parties is marginal, as they received 2.8% of the popular vote in the 2007 parliamentary elections. There is also a limited amount of nonparliamentary far-right extremism. Poland's neo-Nazi skinhead scene was estimated at some 2,000 active members in 1995. The political organization associated with that movement is the National Revival of Poland, with an estimated 500 members, raising some 0.6% of the popular vote.
The neo-fascist Polish Nationalist Union was one of the larger groups active in the early 1990s, numbering some 4,000 members and making international headlines for its rare attacks on Jewish property and on the Catholic Church.
The current major neo-fascist movement is the NOP under the leadership of Adam Gmurczyk. The organization "Niklot" was founded by Tomaz Szczepanski, a former NOP member, in 1998, promoting Slavic supremacy (a Slavic "übermensch"). Since the mid-1990s, the ultra-Catholic Radio Maryja station has been on air with an anti-modernist, nationalist and xenophobic program.
In 1995, the Anti-Defamation League estimated the number of far-right skinheads in Poland at 2,000, the fifth highest number after Germany, Hungary, the Czech Republic and the United States.

History.
World War II.
In the spring of 1944, Sahryń was one of 150 Ukrainian villages (with its prewar Polish minority already deported), which was burned down by Polish partisans during the conflict of ethnic cleansing with Ukrainian OUN-UPA, along the Curzon Line. The conflict "continued throughout June 1944, resulting in considerable bloodshed on both sides and the destruction of dozens of Polish and Ukrainian villages". Sahryń was the site of the initial thrust of the AK counter-offensive against UPA, under the command of Lieutenant Zenon Jachymek, due to Ukrainian self-defence stationing there.
At dawn on March 10, 1944 the AK unit from Division Hrubieszow attacked the fortified village. A heavy fighting broke out. The Ukrainians retreated, but both Catholic and Orthodox churches in Sahryń were burned down. Some 700 villagers were killed by the AK in reprisal, and 260 farmhouses set of fire.
The monument in memory of the Ukrainian victims of AK in Sahryń awaits its official unveiling. It was erected in 2009, with the hope that both Ukrainian and Polish presidents would attend the ceremonies, but there were spelling errors discovered in the names. The monument was built by the Ukrainian side, with Polish participation.

Soon afterward, however, Legrange suffered a severe loss of confidence in his backswing, and would often refuse to complete a shot, stepping away from the ball even after taking the clubhead away from the ball. Naturally, his form tailed off, and he would win only two minor events in South Africa in the 1970s.

2008 Guam B-52 crash

The 2008 Guam B-52 crash was a fatal crash of a United States Air Force (USAF) B-52H Stratofortress on 21 July 2008. The aircraft, operating out of Andersen Air Force Base, crashed into the Pacific Ocean during a training flight approximately northwest of Apra Harbor, Guam. The training flight was to include participation in a local municipal celebration of Liberation Day in Hagåtña. All six crew members aboard the aircraft were killed and the aircraft was destroyed.
An investigation by the USAF determined that the crash was likely caused by an improper stabilizer trim setting. The investigation was unable to determine conclusively what had caused the horizontal stabilizer trim to be set improperly, but theorized that the most likely cause was an aircraft system malfunction.
Crash.
On 21 July 2008, a United States Air Force (USAF) B-52H Stratofortress crashed into the Pacific Ocean approximately northwest of Apra Harbor, Guam, after taking off from Andersen Air Force Base. The aircraft, named "Louisiana Fire" and with the mission call sign of "RAIDR 21", was about to participate in a flyover for the Liberation Day parade in Hagåtña. It crashed at 9:55 am (local time), 20 July, five minutes before they were scheduled to fly over the parade. Air traffic control radar images indicated that the aircraft appeared to be descending rapidly before disappearing from radar scopes at about of altitude.
On 23 July 2008, the USAF announced that there were no survivors, and that the rescue effort had turned to a recovery mission for four still-missing members of the crew of six. -->
Aircraft and crew.
The bomber, assigned to the 20th Bomb Squadron, was, with its crew, on temporary duty at Andersen as part of a four-month rotation. The bomber's unit had replaced Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit bombers which had been grounded following the loss of one of them on 23 February that year.
The crew of RAIDR 21 were: Major Christopher M. Cooper (aircraft commander), Major Brent D. Williams, (radar navigator), Captain Michael K. Dodson, (co-pilot), First Lieutenant Joshua D. Shepherd (navigator), First Lieutenant Robert D. Gerren (electronic warfare officer), and Colonel George Martin. Martin, a flight surgeon, was the deputy commander of 36th Medical Group at Andersen. He was aboard in the Number 6 crew position to ride along for the Liberation Day "Fly Over". The rest of the crew members were from the 20th Bomb Squadron or the 96th Bomb Squadron at Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana. While bodies and remains were recovered from the area, Dodson's and Gerren's remains were not recovered. A memorial service for the crew was held at Arlington National Cemetery on 14 November 2008.
Recovery and investigation.
The USAF worked with the United States Navy to map and retrieve the aircraft's wreckage from the ocean floor. The wreckage did not include a flight data recorder because the aircraft was not equipped with one.
The accident investigation board concluded that the horizontal stabilizer was set at a down angle during the training mission. The cause of the mishap was an improper stabilizer trim setting. Due to the lack of available evidence, no surviving crew members, no radio calls, no other witnesses and lack of a data recorder, the accident investigation board was unable to determine by clear and convincing evidence why the stabilizer trim was mispositioned. The investigation board felt that the most likely cause of this runaway stabilizer trim was a system malfunction that would have led the stabilizer trim to improperly run in a nose-down direction. The improper trim setting occurred somewhere between 14,000 and and caused a rapid and uncontrollable descent the experienced crew could not overcome. Based on the descent profile of the mishap aircraft, there was only 34 seconds from the presumed start of the mishap sequence until impact.
The board president, Brigadier General Mark Barrett explained that two factors led to the crash. The first was the "combination of low altitude with a descending left turn of the aircraft". The second was "the late recognition of the serious nature of the situation by the crew". He added, "any experienced air crew could have found it difficult to recognize, assess and recover from the rapidly developing situation involving the stabilizer trim setting." The USAF also conducted a separate safety investigation into the mishap but did not publicly release its findings.

Helene Jacobs (25 February 1906, Schneidemühl - 13 August 1993, Berlin) was a member of the Confessing Church and of the German Resistance against National Socialism.
Life.
Jacobs was the secretary to a Jewish patent attorney and (from 1934 onwards) a member of the Confessing Church. She joined a group centred around the lawyer Franz Herbert Kaufmann which, from 1940 onwards, hid Jews fleeing Nazi persecution and helped them to escape from Germany. Jacobs hid some Jews in her own house out of a Christian-Socialist motivation, until she was denounced in 1943 and subsequently convicted to two and a half years' imprisonment in a zuchthaus or penitentiary.
Jacobs was a member of the Society for Christian-Jewish Cooperation since its foundation in 1949 and was honoured by Yad Vashem as Righteous Among the Nations. She died in 1993 and was buried at the Waldfriedhof Dahlem, where she was given a memorial in 2004.

Politics of Campania

The Politics of Campania, Italy takes place in a framework of a presidential representative democracy, whereby the President of Regional Government is the head of government, and of a pluriform multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the Regional Government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Regional Council.
Executive.
The Regional Government ("Giunta Regionale") is presided by the President of the Region ("Presidente della Regione"), who is elected for a five-year term, and is composed by the President and the Ministers ("Assessori"), who are currently 10, including a Vice President.
Legislative branch.
The Regional Council of Campania ("Consiglio Regionale della Campania") is composed of 60 members. 48 councillors are elected in provincial constituencies by proportional representation using the largest remainder method with a Droop quota and open lists, while 12 councillors (elected in bloc) come from a "regional list", including the President-elect. One seat is reserved for the candidate who comes second. If a coalition wins more than 50% of the total seats in the Council with PR, only 6 candidates from the regional list will be chosen and the number of those elected in provincial constituencies will be 54. If the winning coalition receives less than 40% of votes, special seats are added to the Council to ensure a large majority for the President's coalition.
The Council is elected for a five-year term, but, if the President suffers a vote of no confidence, resigns or dies, under the "simul stabunt, simul cadent" prevision introduced in 1999 (literally "they will stand together or they will fall together"), also the Council is dissolved and a snap election is called.

Anastasios Peponis

Anastasios Peponis (; 1924 – 8 August 2011) was a Greek politician and author.
Life.
He was born in 1924 in Athens, Greece. During the Axis Occupation of Greece in the Second World War (1941–44), Peponis was an active member of two resistance organizations: the Panhellenic Union of Fighting Youths (PEAN) and the National Coalition of Higher Education Institutions (ESAS), being involved especially in the underground press.
After the war he studied Law, and began practice in 1952. In 1951-52, during his studies, he was leader of the Youth Section of the National Progressive Center Union (EPEK). As the general director of the Hellenic Broadcasting Corporation in 1964-65 he founded the Experimental Channel which began Greek public television. During the Greek military junta of 1967–1974 he was arrested five times, imprisoned, held in solitary confinement, and ordered into internal exile.
After the junta's fall, he became a member of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK). From 1977 to 2000 he was elected with PASOK as a member of the Hellenic Parliament for Athens. After the accession of Greece to the EEC on January 1, 1981, he became a provisional member of the European Parliament representing Greece until the country could hold its first European Parliament elections. In successive PASOK cabinets he held the portfolios of Industry and Energy (1981–82), Industry, Energy and Research (1986–89, 1989–90 and 1995). He was Minister without portfolio in 1984, Minister to the Presidency of the Government in 1989 and in 1993-94, Minister for Justice in 1995, and Minister for Health and Welfare in 1996. In 1985-86, as MP he acted as the chief sponsor for the revision of the Greek Constitution.
As the minister responsible for energy policy he conceived of, negotiated and signed an agreement on importing natural gas to Greece from the then-Soviet Union and Algeria and started its realization in 1987-88. In the same capacity, he proposed and oversaw a strategy for disengaging foreign companies searching for oil in the northern Aegean from issues of national security and international policy.
As Minister for Public Administration he introduced and secured passage for Law 2190/94 establishing the Supreme Council for Personnel Selection (ASEP) and the system of public hiring by means of objective criteria.
Peponis died on 8 August 2011. He was 87.

Mainland India are the territories of India located on the Asian continental mainland. This includes all the parts of India except the union territories of Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep and the Antarctic base of Maitri.
Because more than 95% of India's land and population is on the mainland itself, politically and historically, the term has little significance. It is mostly used only by amateur radio operators as the territories outside mainland India have a different callsign block.

University of the Philippines Los Baños Institute of Plant Breeding

The Institute of Plant Breeding (IPB) is a research institute of the University of the Philippines Los Baños. It is the national biotechnology research center and repository for all crops other than rice, which is handled by the Philippine Rice Research Institute.
It traces its roots to the Plant Breeding Division of the Department of Agronomy, College of Agriculture. In 1975, President Ferdinand Marcos elevated the Division to an Institute and provided additional funds for new facilities and expanded research initiatives.
Samples of IPB research.
This variety is a genetically-enhanced papaya with PRSV resistance and delayed ripening trait. This trait will help reduce post-harvest losses due to spoilage which is another major problem to farmers. The first and second generation papayas had been previously subjected to polymerase chain reaction analysis, which indicated that the lines contain a copy of the PRSV coat protein gene. A third generation papaya is currently under development.
Initial crosses had already been made between Indian transgenic eggplants and selected Philippine varieties Mara, Mistisa, Dumaguete Long Purple, and Casino. The progeny of these crosses were then back-crossed with their Philippine variety parent in India.
The multiple virus resistant project aims to combine transgenic technologies for Cucumber Mosaic Virus with conventional resistance against Tomato Leaf Curl Virus (ToLCV) to produce commercial tomato varieties. After introgression lines and appropriate controls were supplied by IPB partners, these tomato lines were screened to identify the genome regions that confer resistance against each local ToLCV. Reliable DNA markers are also being developed for each identified genome (introgression) region.
Although engaged in genetic engineering, the Institute also uses mutation breeding, which is an alternative method of improving crop varieties. Small portions of avocado plant tissue (embryos) were allowed to grow (embryogenic cultures) and to differentiate into somatic embryos and shoots. Some of the plant tissue cultures were subjected to gamma irradiation to facilitate mutation from the regenerated plant tissue cultures. During the irradiation, some cells were killed and those capable of regrowth were multiplied. The surviving cells were grown to produce somatic embryos and shoots. The shoots from irradiated and non-irradiated tissues were then treated in a test tube environment to promote root growth and prepare them for natural growth environment. The IPB is currently undertaking the rooting and potting out of the plantlets to enable maximum recovery. The established regenerated plants will then be transferred to the greenhouse, and finally to the field for further evaluation.

Modliborzyce, Lublin Voivodeship

Modliborzyce is a village in Janów Lubelski County, Lublin Voivodeship, in eastern Poland. It is the seat of the gmina (administrative district) called Gmina Modliborzyce. It lies in the historic province of Lesser Poland, approximately north-west of Janów Lubelski and south of the regional capital Lublin. The village has a population of 1,311, and between 1631 - 1869 it used to be a town. Its name comes from Modliborzyce, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship, which had existed before the foundation of the village. The name Modliborzyce itself is based on an ancient Polish given name "Modlibog".
Modliborzyce is picturesquely located at the point where three major geographical regions of Poland meet - Lublin Upland, Sandomierz Basin, and Roztocze. Southern part of the village belongs to the Landscape Park of Janów Forest, and northern is covered by the protected area of Roztocze. 
The history of the village dates back to February 27, 1631, when a local nobleman Stanisław Wioteski received King Zygmunt III Waza’s permission to found a town in the area of the already-existing village of "Słupie". The town was called Modliborzyce, and in 1644-1664, the church of St. Stanisław was built. After the Wioteski family, the town belonged to Mikołaj Słoniewski. In the second half of the 17th century, a synagogue was opened, due to a steady influx of Jewish settlers. In 1706 Russian troops were garrisoned in Modliborzyce, which had a negative influence on the development of the town. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Modliborzyce belonged to several noble families - the Nahorecki, the Wierciński, the Doliński and the Gorzkowski. Since 1815 the town belonged to Russian-controlled Congress Poland. Modliborzyce burned in 1804 and 1841, and in 1855 its population was decimated by the cholera.
During the January Uprising, on initiative of a local nobleman Ignacy Solman, a regiment was formed, which was engaged in a skirmish with the Russians near Janów Lubelski. Solman was killed by the Cossacks, and in 1869 Russian government punished Modliborzyce by reducing it to the status of a village. In September 1939 the Luftwaffe twice bombed Modliborzyce (Sept 8 and 15). As a result, 87 people died and most of the buildings were destroyed. In 1940 German authorities brought here some 1,200 Jews from Vienna, who later perished at Bełżec extermination camp. Modliborzyce was one of local centers of the Home Army, and German occupation ended in July 1944. 
Due to its location, Modliborzyce is a tourist center of local importance. Its most important points of interest are the Baroque church (1644 - 1664), bell tower (1775), and a synagogue (1760), which now houses the center of culture.

Politics of Emilia-Romagna

The Politics of Emilia-Romagna, Italy takes place in a framework of a presidential representative democracy, whereby the President of Regional Government is the head of government, and of a pluriform multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the Regional Government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Legislative Assembly.
Executive.
The Regional Government ("Giunta Regionale") is presided by the President of the Region ("Presidente della Regione"), who is elected for a five-year term, and is composed by the President, the Ministers ("Assessori"), who are currently 12, including a Vice President and one Under-Secretary for in President's office.
Legislative branch.
The Legislative Assembly of Emilia-Romagna ("Assemblea Legislativa dell'Emilia-Romagna") is composed of 50 members. 40 councillors are elected in provincial constituencies by proportional representation using the largest remainder method with a Droop quota and open lists, while 10 councillors (elected in bloc) come from a "regional list", including the President-elect. One seat is reserved for the candidate who comes second. If a coalition wins more than 50% of the total seats in the Council with PR, only 5 candidates from the regional list will be chosen and the number of those elected in provincial constituencies will be 45. If the winning coalition receives less than 40% of votes special seats are added to the Council to ensure a large majority for the President's coalition.
The Council is elected for a five-year term, but, if the President suffers a vote of no confidence, resigns or dies, under the "simul stabunt, simul cadent" prevision introduced in 1999 (literally "they will stand together or they will fall together"), also the Council is dissolved and a snap election is called.
Parties and elections.
Last regional election.
In the last regional election, which took place on 28–29 March 2010, Vasco Errani (Democratic Party) was re-elected for a third full consecutive term by defeating Anna Maria Bernini (The People of Freedom).

The Deutscher Koordinierungsrat der Gesellschaften für Christlich-Jüdische Zusammenarbeit (DKR - "German Coordinating-Council for Christian-Jewish cooperation organisations") is an umbrella organisation for 81 local and regional organisations in Germany working for Christian-Jewish collaboration. It presently has around 20,000 members overall. They advocate Jewish-Christian dialogue and collaboration between Christians and Jews as well as for the study of the Holocaust. It was founded on 10 November 1949 and is based in Bad Nauheim. Its patron is "ex officio" the President of Germany.

Sudden stop (economics)

A sudden stop in capital flows is defined as a sudden slowdown in private capital inflows into emerging market economies, and a corresponding sharp reversal from large current account deficits into smaller deficits or small surpluses. Sudden stops are usually followed by a sharp decrease in output, private spending and credit to the private sector, and real exchange rate appreciation. The term “sudden stop” was inspired by a banker’s comment on a paper by Rüdiger Dornbusch and Alejandro Werner about Mexico, that “it is not speed that kills, it is the sudden stop”.
Sudden stops are commonly described as periods that contain at least one observation where the year-on-year fall in capital flows lies at least two standard deviations below its sample mean. The start of the sudden stop period is determined by the first time the annual change in capital flows falls one standard deviation below the mean and the end of the sudden stop period is determined once the annual change in capital flows exceeds one standard deviation below its sample mean.
Economic impact.
The balance of payments identity establishes that the current account is equal to the capital account plus the accumulation of international reserves. Therefore, a large slowdown in capital inflows is met either by a loss of international reserves and/or a lower current account deficit, both of which have negative economic effects. 
A reduction in the current account deficit is achieved through a decrease in domestic aggregate demand for tradable goods. Since tradable and non-tradable goods are complements, this also reduces demand for non-tradable goods. The demand for tradable goods reflects in a reduction in imports; however, the lower demand for non-tradable goods translates into lower output and real depreciation of the currency (lower relative price of non tradable to tradable goods). Firms producing non-tradable goods face an increase in the real cost of financing, as the cost of loans in terms of the price of non-tradable goods rises. These firms get lower revenues, which reduce their ability to repay their loans. As a result, banks face a higher rate of non-performing loans from this sector. In this situation, banks become more cautious and decrease loans, which worsens the economic recession. 
A collapse in asset prices also contributes to a sharp slowdown in economic activity. The value of loan collaterals are severely reduced which further impacts the situation of the financial system and reduces credit, reflecting in lower consumption and investment. Furthermore, lower asset prices have negative wealth effects for consumers, which further reduce consumption spending. The features of sudden stops are similar to those of balance of payment crises in terms of devaluations of the domestic currency followed by periods of output loss. However, sudden stops are characterized by sharper recessions and a larger fall in the price of non-tradable to tradable goods.
A similar argument relates large changes in relative prices of tradable and non-tradable goods with the effects of a sudden stop. The mechanism is explained by a credit based approach to currency crises, where countries with less developed financial markets experience a sharper output fall during a sudden stop episode, regardless of whether the country has a fixed or floating exchange rate regime, as the source of the crisis is through the deterioration of private firms’ balance sheets. Therefore, a higher proportion of foreign currency debt increases the vulnerability to currency devaluations. Different to first generation crisis models, in their model crises may occur even under low unemployment and sound fiscal policies.
An additional effect of sudden stops and third generation crises in emerging markets are related to financial institutions and sudden stops in short term capital inflows, in comparison to previous crises where the main features were related to fiscal imbalances or weakness in real activity. In this type of model, international financial markets play a key role, where small open economies face a problem of international illiquidity during the crisis episodes, associated with the collapse of the financial system.
Due to the inherent structure of the banking system, banks transform maturity from liquid deposits to illiquid assets, which creates vulnerability to bank runs. Even in situations where banks might be solvent, in the short run bank runs create an illiquidity problem, where banks would need to borrow funds to meet the temporary deposit withdrawals. However, under this situation, it might be harder to obtain foreign funds, as foreign creditors may also panic depending on the degree of commitment to repay international debts. Moreover, the higher the level of short term debt the higher the exposure to illiquidity problems. This models is particularly related to the situation in emerging markets, because of the larger role of banks compared to other financial institutions in these economies and because it is more difficult for them to get emergency funds from world markets during crisis periods.
An alternative explanation of sudden stops focuses on the interaction of temporary and permanent technology shocks, where highly volatile trend shocks in emerging market economies are closely related to sudden stop episodes. Emerging markets are characterized by frequent regime switches related to changes in fiscal, monetary and trade policies, which reflect in more volatile shocks to the trend. The sharp effects of sudden stop episodes are not only related to the large magnitude of the shock, but also to the fact that there is a negative productivity shock with a change in trend.
In order to study sudden stop episodes, using data from the 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, this model decomposes it to obtain a representation of transitory and permanent technology shocks. The results show that including permanent technology shocks is able to produce the behavior observed during a sudden stop episode. The model predicts a large contraction in output, consumption and investment, as well as a sharp current account reversal.
Empirical issues.
Empirical studies mention a group of indicators that may be related to sudden stops. The composition of capital inflows, with a higher proportion of short term financing may be more risky as they generate larger slowdowns in capital inflows. The time profile of maturity debt is important in assessing the potential for sudden reversals in capital flows. The shorter the maturity of a country’s debt, the more prone it is for a sudden stop crises.
Some empirical studies focus on the interaction between sudden stops and financial crises in emerging market economies. Using a sample of emerging market countries with large capital inflows from Latin America, Asia and Europe, they compare the severity of the sudden stop episodes associated with currency crises and banking crises. The severity of sudden stop episodes in emerging market economies are compared using indicators such as the real depreciation of the currency and indicators of currency and banking crises. Results suggest that currency and banking crises in Asia in 1995-1997 were more severe than the sharpest crises in Latin America, in terms of banking bailout costs and the size of capital account reversal. 
Another topic of study is the impact of sudden stops on output. Sudden stops can be accompanied by a currency crisis and/or a banking crisis. Empirical studies show that the effects of a banking crisis are more pernicious than the effects of a currency crisis, due to the additional effect of the credit channel on output. Lower asset prices are a persistent fact after a banking crisis, which indicate a low value of collaterals to loans, and therefore, negatively impact the banking sector and the supply of loans.
Regarding exports, currency crises show a faster recovery in the export sector, while exports remain low for an average of two years after banking crises. Banking crises also present a sharper recession, consistent with the disruption of the financial sector. There is a distinguishable boom–bust cycle, as unsustainable massive capital inflows that precede a sudden stop episode sharply increase economic activity.
Other studies focus on the relationship between current account reversals and sudden stops in both emerging markets and advanced economies. Using cross-country data for a sample of 157 countries during the 1970-2001 period, the results indicate that 46.1% of countries that suffered a sudden stop also faced a current account reversal, while 22.9% of countries that faced current account reversals also faced a sudden stop episode. The less-than-one relationship could be related to an effective use of international reserves to offset capital outflows during sudden stops, while during current account reversals, there are some countries that were not receiving large capital inflows, so their deficits were financed through a loss of international reserves.
A comparison of the stylized facts observed during sudden stop episodes in emerging market economies and developed countries on the financial crises of the 1990s relate sudden stops in emerging market and advanced economies with the presence of contagion effects. Most sudden stop episodes for emerging markets occur around the Tequila (1994), East Asian (1997) and Russian (1998) crises. In the case of developed economies, sudden stop episodes occur around the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) (1992–1993) crisis.
Policy measures.
Regarding policy measures adopted during sudden stop episodes, the massive slowdown in capital inflows, usually presented as large capital outflows, can be counteracted by exchange rate devaluation, loss of international reserves and/or increases in real interest rates. The nominal exchange rate behavior during most sudden stop episodes show that sudden stops in emerging markets are followed by a devaluation of the domestic currency, while most depreciation episodes in developed countries are not related to sudden stop phases. Real interest rates sharply increase during sudden stop episodes, especially in the case of emerging market economies. A sharp loss of international reserves is also observed during sudden stop episodes, both in developed countries and emerging markets. The current account balance shows a sharp reduction in current account deficits, with a significantly higher increase in the current account balance in emerging markets.

Papal Zouaves

The Papal Zouaves () were an infantry force formed in defence of the Papal States.
Origin.
The Zouaves evolved out of a unit formed by Christophe Léon Louis Juchault de Lamoricière
in 1860, the Franco-Belgian Tirailleurs. On January 1, 1861 the unit was renamed the Papal Zouaves. He had been introduced by Frédéric-François-Xavier Ghislain de Mérode.
International Composition.
The "" were mainly young men, unmarried and Roman Catholic, who volunteered to assist Pope Pius IX in his struggle against the Italian unificationist Risorgimento. They wore a similar style of uniform to that of the French Zouaves but in grey with red trim. A grey and red kepi was substituted for the North African fez. 
All orders were given in French and the unit was commanded by a Swiss Colonel, M. Allet. 
Nonetheless, the regiment was truly international, and by May 1868 numbered 4,592 men. At that time the unit was composed of 1,910 Dutch, 1,301 French, 686 Belgians, 157 Romans and Pontifical subjects, 135 Canadians, 101 Irish, 87 Prussians, 50 English, 32 Spaniards, 22 Germans from beyond Prussia, 19 Swiss, 14 Americans, 14 Neapolitans, 12 Modenese, 12 Poles, 10 Scots, 7 Austrians, 6 Portuguese, 6 Tuscans, three Maltese, two Russians and one volunteer each from the South Sea Islands, India, Africa, Mexico, Peru and Circassia. 
A British volunteer, Joseph Powell, noted in his account of his service with the Papal Zouaves, "Two Years in the Pontifical Zouaves" that at least three "blacks" and one person from China served in the Zouaves. 
Between February 1868 and September 1870 the number of Canadian volunteers, mainly from the francophone and predominantly Catholic province of Quebec, rose to seven contingents numbering some 500 men in total - with a contingent of 114 turning back to Canada because news had reached them of the surrender of the Papal States in September 1870.
The Battle of Mentana.
One thousand five hundred Papal Zouaves assisted in the notable Franco/Papal victory at the Battle of Mentana, fought on November 3, 1867 between French-Papal troops and Italian volunteers led by Giuseppe Garibaldi. 
In his report to the Pope, the commander of the Papal forces, General Kanzler, praised the elan of the Zouaves, citing a determined bayonet charge as a particular example. 
The Zouaves suffered the brunt of the fighting, sustaining 81 casualties in the battle, including 24 killed (the Papal forces suffered only 30 dead in total) and 57 wounded. The official French report of the battle prepared by the French commander, General de Failly, also cited the bravery of the Papal Zouaves. The youngest victim, aged seventeen, was English Zoave Julian Watts-Russel.
The Zouaves are mentioned in Victor Hugo's poem "Mentana."
Last days of the Papal States.
The Zouaves also played a role in the final engagements against the forces of the newly united Kingdom of Italy in September 1870, in which the Papal forces were outnumbered almost seven to one. The Zouaves fought off enemy lancers on the 13th, withdrew with Papal artillery under heavy fire on the 20th and made preparations for a counterattack against the Garibaldians before being told of the surrender, whereupon they destroyed their weapons. 
Several Zouaves were executed or murdered by the Italian forces following the surrender, including a Belgian officer who refused to give up his sword.
Volunteers of the West.
After the Capture of Rome by Victor Emmanuel in 1870, the French contingent of the former Papal Zouaves served the government of National Defence in France during the Franco-Prussian War. Renamed as the ' (Volunteers of the West) but retaining their grey and red Papal uniforms, the Zouaves fought the Prussians and their other German allies outside Orléans, with 15 killed or wounded between the 11th and 12 October 1870, and also engaged the enemy at Patay. Numbering about 1,800 men, the experienced former Papal Zouaves fought with distinction at the Battle of Loigny (2 December 1870) where they lost 216 men while covering the retreat of other French units. The ' were disbanded after the entrance of Prussian troops into Paris.
Monuments.
There are a number of monuments to the Papal Zouaves, including a Dutch museum near the Oudenbosch Basilica, the Mass chapel in the Capuchin Crypt and a monument in the Lateran.

Charlie Ward (golfer)

Charles Harold Ward (16 September 1911 – August 2001) was a prominent English golfer of the 1940s, winner of the British Order of Merit in both 1948 and 1949, and twice finishing third in The Open Championship, in 1948 and 1951. He would add his name, at some stage, to the roll of honour of almost every leading event in British professional golf, with the exception of the Open.
Ward was born in Birmingham, England. Like many players his age, Ward's best years were denied to him by World War II, so it was fitting that he should win the very first professional event played after VE Day, the Daily Mail Victory Tournament at St Andrews. After his victory he returned late to his posting at an RAF base and as a punishment, was confined to barracks. Ward would win two events in 1948 (one of them in a tie), and gained more recognition for his 1949 season, his three wins that year including the rich Spalding and North British-Harrogate Tournaments and then the British Masters, also played that year at St Andrews.
Further victories followed in 1950 (the Daily Mail Tournament at Walton Heath, which Ward won in a playoff against Bobby Locke and Australian Ossie Pickworth) and 1951 (the Dunlop Tournament and the Lotus Tournament) before Ward's final victory on the British circuit in 1956, the British PGA Championship at Maesdu. 
Ward represented Great Britain on three occasions in the Ryder Cup, in 1947, 1949 and 1951, although he only enjoyed one victory in his six matches, losing twice to Sam Snead and once to Ben Hogan.
Ward died after a short illness in August 2001, a month short of his 90th birthday.

Daijiworld Media

Daijiworld Media is an Indian private limited media company, headquartered in Mangalore, that provides news services, including the web portal, "www.daijiworld.com". It was founded by Walter Nandalike, as "www.daijidubai.com" on January 14, 2001, primarily with the objective of relaying news from the Coastal Konkan region of India. It was later renamed as "www.daijiworld.com", and established as a media company in 2007.
Daijiworld has currently a daily viewer-ship of around 350,000 visitors from around 180 countries, of which 40% of them are Non-resident Indian (NRI) Mangaloreans. The portal contains a variety of columns ranging from daily news, interviews, achievements, cookery, women interest, young world, and other information about Mangalore, Coastal Karnataka, Goa, Mumbai, and Middle-Eastern countries. Daijiworld runs TVDAIJIWORLD, which is in the test transmission stages. It also publishes a weekly named "Daijiworld Weekly".
History.
Daijiworld Media was a result of an April Fools' Day prank by Walter Nandalike, the Editor-in-chief of the portal. He had migrated to the Gulf for employment purposes, with no knowledge of computers. Having learnt about computers, he sent his first E-mail to his friends on April 1, 2000 saying that he was hosting a site on the Net, which was meant to be a joke for April Fools' Day. His friends took him seriously and started inquiring about the site. Surprised by the levels of interest, Walter started thinking seriously about the project. He learnt computers thoroughly, and eight months later on January 14, 2001, launched "www.daijidubai.com", primarily with the objective of hosting information and news pertaining to Konkani language and society. The portal is now known as "www.daijiworld.com" "Daiji" in Konkani means "relation", and the portal was started by Walter and a group of writers of the Daiji Dubai Writers Forum with a view of promoting and encouraging awareness of culture and tradition.
In May 2005, the portal had been ranked 30,714, among the estimated 60 million websites in India by ranking.com, a premier web monitoring agency. In addition, internetsupervision.com, one of the world's largest website monitoring portals, had cited daijiworld.com as among the 100 most popular websites in the world, as of May 2005. The ranking was based on the last 10 days of performance of the website. Daijiworld had been cited alongside major portals such as Google, Yahoo!, eBay, and Microsoft. In March 2007, it established itself as a media company under the banner of "Daijiworld Media Pvt Ltd". In order to cater to the increasing demand for news from India by the NRI's, an exclusive office was opened in Kankanady, Mangalore with 40 correspondents spread across the twin districts of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi. On July 18, 2008, Daijiworld took a step further and inaugurated its Udupi office. In May 2009, Daijiworld announced that it will soon be launching an English weekly tabloid named "Daijiworld Weekly", which would be promoted under the banner of a new company namely "Daijiworld Publications Pvt Ltd".
Charity.
Daijiworld.com has also created a bridge between people spread across different parts of the world. Hundreds of people who had lost links with their roots were reunited and reconnected through daijiworld. More than 300 families have received financial assistance for their medical, education or other needs, through frequent appeals to readers who have been more than generous in lending a helping hand to make lives better. The cumulative financial assistance generated through daijiworld today stands at an estimated Rs 6.5 crore (Until Sep, 2013).
Awards and Recognitions.

His younger brother Larry Jnr, played for the Newcastle Knights in the Jersey Flegg Cup in 2006 and 2007.
Playing career.
After playing junior rugby league in Maitland for the Woodberry Warriors, Taufua switched to rugby union, playing for The Waratahs in the Newcastle and Hunter Rugby Union competition. He was a Newcastle and NSW Country rugby union representative when in 2006 Brian Smith, the Knights coach at that time discovered him. After debuting in the NRL midway through 2007, at 25, Taufua continued to improve. In 2008, a Newcastle Herald article nicknamed him "The Samoan stealth bomber" after "teeth-rattling tackles and bone-jarring charges" against the Melbourne Storm, and in 2009, played in every game for Newcastle except their first-round loss to the Gold Coast Titans. He only missed a few games in 2010 due to injury.
On 7 June 2011, Taufua signed with the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks for 2 years, starting in 2012.
Throughout the 2013 season, Taufua struggled to obtain game time in the NRL, due to the likes of Luke Lewis, Paul Gallen, and Andrew Fifita, before him, but had a fitting end to his career with a stellar season as starting prop in a NSW Cup Premiership side, captained by Chad Townsend. 
He announced his retirement from the game after the 2013 Rugby League World Cup.
Representative career.
In 2009 he was named as part of the Samoan side for the Pacific Cup.

One Step Out of Time

"One Step Out of Time", written and composed by Paul Davies, Tony Ryan, and Victor Stratton, was the United Kingdom's entry at the Eurovision Song Contest 1992, performed by Michael Ball. 
After the disappointing result Samantha Janus received on behalf of the United Kingdom at Rome in 1991, the UK national final, "A Song for Europe", was retooled. Reverting to the selection process which decided the entries from 1964 to 1975, a singer was picked internally by the BBC, and the public would vote on which song would go with them to the Eurovision finals. Michael Ball sang eight songs on "A Song for Europe 1992", and "One Step Out of Time," performed seventh, emerged as the winner by an overwhelming margin (over 60,000 telephone votes separated the first and second place finishers). 
At Malmö, the song was performed sixteenth on the night, after Austria's Tony Wegas with "Zusammen geh'n", and before Ireland's Linda Martin with "Why Me?" At the end of judging that evening, "One Step Out of Time" took the second-place slot with 139 points, it had been the pre-contest favourite. Belgium, Austria, Denmark and Germany awarded the UK their 12 points that evening. Despite losing by 16 points to Ireland's entry "Why Me?", the UK received more 12 point designations than Ireland (four to three). This would be the third of four second-place finishes the UK had placed between 1988 and 1993.
The song was a mid-tempo ballad, relating the singer's comfort with being "one step out of time" in relation to rejecting the reality around him, instead pining after his former lover. Not accepting that his relationship is over, and spurning the disapproval of his friends, he wishes to put "his love on the line" one more time, imploring his former lover to just let him know what he had done wrong.
The song was included on the album "Past and Present" which was released on 9 March 2009.
Before Eurovision, the song débuted and peaked at #20 on the UK Singles Chart, and stayed in the chart for 7 weeks .

Vinotherapy

Vinotherapy, also written "Vinotherapie" describes a beauty therapy process where the residue of wine making (the pips and pulp) are rubbed into the skin. The pulp is said to have excellent exfoliating qualities and help reduce the problems associated with ageing.
History.
The concept of vinotherapy was expanded by Mathilde and Bertrand Thomas. The French couple learned about the impact of grape seeds from the leading expert on grape and grapevine polyphenols Dr. Vercauteren. 
In 1995, Mathilde and Bertrand launched a line of Vinothérapie skincare products made from grape derived ingredients: Caudalie. 
Vinotherapie makes use of the benefits from the grape and the vine extracts to provide effective skincare treatments, with anti-ageing action. Caudalíe was the first to stabilized and patent (Patent n° WO9429404) the extraction of Grape Seed Polyphenols (OPC), and use them in dermo-cosmetics.

Big Sha

Mihail Mihaylov born on December 27, 1972, better known as Big Sha or by his previous name, Misho Shamara, is a Bulgarian rapper from Varna, Bulgaria. He is known for his socialist leanings. One of the country's top rap artists in the 1990s and the early 2000s, his career has been waning ever since his partner, Ivan Glavchev (Vanko 1), was sentenced in 2003 to 12 years in prison for running an organization that exported Bulgarian prostitutes, including minors, to France, Spain, Belgium and Italy. Initially considered controversial, his opinions are now more likely to draw ridicule from media and population alike. Lately, he has been trying to draw attention by supporting the socialist-led government of Oresharski, whose decision to appoint a media tycoon Delyan Peevski with links to organized crime as head of the national security agency sparked nationwide protests against the Oresharski cabinet. He also provoked indignation by calling Bulgaria's former Finance Minister, Simeon Dyankov, "Jewish scum." 
Music career.
Known as the Hammer, after MC Hammer, he had a group called Hamburger 1 with which he caught some attention.
But his success came with Gumeni Glavi (Rubber Heads) when their debut album sold over 120 000 copies in 1994 which is equal to a four times platinum certification from BAMP (Bulgarian Association of Music Producers). Their second album Second-Hand Tires didn't sell as well.
After these two albums in 1997 Dj Dido D was introduced to the group and the albums that followed were instant classics in Bulgarian Hip Hop. The albums were called For More Money and For Even More Money.
After their success, Gumeni Glavi performed over 200 concerts in Bulgaria but after disputes within the band they split up and Sha began his solo career.
Solo career.
He reached solo success with the smash hit single, "Fenki, Fenki" ("Fans, Fans") which became infamous for its lyrics. The following album, "Moi" ("Mine") sold 90 000 and showed that Misho Shamara was still on top of the rap game in Bulgaria. After this success in 2002 Shamara and Vanko 1 started his own record label "R&B Records", through which they released Goliamata Kombina (The Big Duo) which sold over 200 000 copies. His protégés Konsa, 100 Kila, Benjamini and Loshite made numerous hits and Sha didn't stay behind. In 2003 he released "Azbukata Na Jivota" ("The Alphabet Of Life") which was again on top of the Bulgarian Album Charts. In 2006 he released "Obichai Blijnia, Bliji Obichania" ("Love Those Close, And Lick Those Loved"), the album contained the hit tracks "Gnusnia Bradan" ("The Disgusting Beardman", a diss track against Spens), "Edin Den Se Napih" ("One Day I Got Drunk") featuring Konsa and Ogi Dog and "Boom Boom" featuring Mc Michael.
In 2007, Misho Shamara (literally Misho the Slap) changed his stage name to Big Sha, and founded a new label, "Frontline Hustle", in association with Universal Music Bulgaria and Virginia Records.
In 2008 he released "Hliab I Amfeti" ("Bread and Amphetamines") which featured collaborations with U.S. rap stars such as Crucial Conflict and Drag-On. The album reached number one on the charts.
In 2009, he was featured on LiLana's song "Dime Piece" together with Snoop Dogg.
His career has been on the decline lately. 
Beefs.
Just like the east coast vs. west coast feud in America, there was a similar situation in Bulgaria. Shamara and his label, R&B Records representing the east and Sniper Records, representing the west. Numerous diss tracks where shot back and forward but the beef was never settled.

Enrique Henríquez

Enrique Henríquez (1536 – 28 January 1608) was a Portuguese Jesuit theologian.
Life.
Henriquez was born at Oporto. At the age of sixteen, in 1552, he entered the Society of Jesus, and became known for his philosophical and theological erudition. He taught both these branches at the Jesuit colleges of Cordova and Salamanca; in the latter place he numbered Francisco Suarez and Gregory of Valencia among his pupils. 
In 1593 he left the Society of Jesus and entered the Order of St. Dominic; but he soon returned to the Jesuits. Father Alcazar (Hist. Prov. Tolet., I, 204) gives the following account of this incident. After Henríquez had printed in the preface of one of his theological works some passages not approved by the censors, Claudio Acquaviva ordered him to tear out the page containing these paragraphs. Henríquez felt so disturbed over this punishment that he obtained permission from the Pope to leave the society and enter the Dominican Order. It was Gregory of Valencia who advised him to return to his former associates. He died in Tivoli, Italy.
Works.
Henríquez is especially noted for two theological works:

The Corley Conspiracy

The Corley Conspiracy is an opera by Tim Benjamin to a libretto by Sean Starke who also directed. The work premiered on 19 September 2007 in the Purcell Room at the Southbank Centre in London; the orchestral parts were played by the ensemble Radius. The opera was commissioned by the London Design Festival 2007.
Roles.
The performance of the work lasts for about 75 minutes.
Structure.
Unusual for an opera, all the vocal parts are spoken, but unlike a play, the music is continuous and relates strongly to the text.
Background.
The text of the work is based on Mike Corley's experiences and theories, as shown in his Usenet posts and on his website.
Mike Corley is an Information technology specialist residing in the United Kingdom. He has a long history of posting Usenet messages detailing how MI5 has allegedly bugged his home, watched him via his television and is sending people to follow him around and harass him. These messages are often crossposted to many different newsgroups. His claims of being persecuted by MI5 (the "Subject:" line of his posts) have led to claims that he is suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. He has claimed in his posts that television personalities are often talking about him in code and are part of the MI5 conspiracy. He has been banned from posting through Google for his abuse of Usenet and has been similarly barred from most Internet service providers in England, an assertion which Corley refuted in August 2012.

<doc id="18524311" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18524311" title="Dereferenceable Uniform Resource Identifier">
Dereferenceable Uniform Resource Identifier

A dereferenceable Uniform Resource Identifier or dereferenceable URI is a resource retrieval mechanism that uses any of the internet protocols (e.g. HTTP) to obtain a copy or representation of the resource it identifies.
In the context of traditional HTML web pages, this is the normal and obvious way of working: A URI refers to the page, and when requested the web server returns a copy of it. In other "non-dereferenceable" contexts, such as XML Schema, the namespace identifier is still a URI, but this is simply an identifier (i.e. a namespace name). There is no intention that this can or should be dereferenced. There is even a separate attribute, codice_1, which may contain a dereferenceable URI that "does" point to a copy of the schema document.
In the case of Linked Data, the representation takes the form of a document (typically HTML or XML) that describes the resource that the URI identifies. In either case, the mechanism makes it possible for a user (or software agent) to "follow your nose" to find out more information related to the identified resource.
Background.
In computing, identifiers are used to distinguish things and to facilitate data exchange. For example, two US citizens of the same name would have different SSN. In a totally distributed system, such as the World Wide Web, a URI is used to globally identify a thing in the world. Because the architecture and decision is made for HTTP, URIs often identify the web pages instead of the underlying thing. To remove this confusion, URIs that identify things often include a hash (see the following section). The following example shows the difference of a URL of a person (which usually means his/her homepage) and a URI of a person:
Because of the nature of a URI, it can be dereferenced to get the information of the thing it represents—hence the term dereferenceable URI. SSN and a person's name are not dereferenceable because, even though you could search for these strings on the Web, it is not guaranteed that the information exists and is unambiguous. In other words, there is no canonical way of dereferencing those identifiers. On the other hand, URIs can be dereferenced by standardized protocols such as HTTP.
Dereferenceable URIs are based on the well-established theory and practices of "data access by reference". A data access and manipulation mechanism is used extensively in general computer programming (e.g., C/C++ pointers) and database call level interfaces (e.g., ODBC and JDBC) amongst others. The term: "dereferencing" describes the act of obtaining a representation of a description of an entity via its URI.
In the Semantic Web realm, dereferenceable URIs offer the critical fabric that drive the Giant Global Graph of interconnected data popularly referred to as Linked Data, another term coined by Tim Berners-Lee in his Linked Data Design Note and furthered by other articles such as "Cool URIs for the Semantic Web" by Sauermann and Cyganiak.
Eventually everything will have its dereferenceable URI, but things that already have URIs and described in interoperable way at this moment are:
Formats.
Dereferenceable URIs are constructed using one of two forms: Hash or a Slash. The critical thing about either format is the underlying use of existing Web architecture to preserve the implicit identity (or pointer) function.
Hash URI example.

<doc id="18524318" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18524318" title="Herman Bagger">
Herman Bagger

Herman Bagger (20 July 1800–1880) was a Norwegian newspaper editor and politician.
Personal life.
Herman Bagger was born in Lemvig in Jutland, Denmark to physician Eggert Christian Bagger (1768–1812) and his wife Claudine Margrethe (1774–1838), née Borgen. He had one older brother and three younger siblings.
On 9 June 1829 he married Marthe Elise Winther (1802–1870). The couple had five sons and one daughter.
Career.
Bagger was a jurist by education. At the time of his marriage, he worked as a headmaster at a school in Drøbach.
In 1837, the year local government was introduced in Norway, Bagger was elected as the first mayor of Gjerpen municipality. He held this position until 1841. He was elected to the Norwegian Parliament in 1839, representing the rural constituency of "Bratsberg Amt". However, he was not re-elected in 1842. The seat was taken by Frederik Charlow Sophus Borchsenius.
In 1842 Bagger started the newspaper "Skiensposten", but he grew tired and resigned as chief editor later that year. "Skiensposten" survived for the time being, but went defunct in 1843. The same year, however, Bagger returned to the newspaper business, as co-editor of "Bratsberg Amtstidende", founded by Peter Feilberg in 1840. The name was changed to "Bratsberg Amtstidende og Correspondent". Bagger left already in 1844. He formed his own newspaper "Bratsberg Amts Correspondent", later renamed "Correspondenten". At the same time, Feilberg's newspaper reverted its name to "Bratsberg Amtstidende". "Bratsberg Amtstidende" and "Correspondenten" would from now on become fierce rivals. "Correspondenten", like "Skiensposten" before it, was pressed by Jens Melgaard, who owned a pressing plant rivalling that of Peter Feilberg. Bagger used his newspaper for political purposes, such as when he stood for election in 1844. He attacked the incumbent Frederik Charlow Sophus Borchsenius, who in turn was defended by Feilberg in the "Bratsberg Amtstidende". In the end, Borchsenius was elected, not Bagger.
By that time Bagger had moved to the city, Skien. He had several supporters there, and was able to be elected mayor of that city. He served as mayor from 1847 to 1848 and 1850 to 1851, alternating with his friend Hans Severin Arentz. When living in Skien, which was a constituency of its own, Bagger was elected to the Norwegian Parliament in 1848, 1851, 1854, 1862 and 1868. His rival Borchsenius was elected as well, from Bratsbergs Amt in 1848, 1854, 1857 and 1862.
Throughout this period, Bagger edited the "Correspondenten". He notably supported the radical politician Peter Bøyesen, and supported Hans and Hans Eleonardus Møller during the feud in the marine insurance business of Porsgrund. In his later years Bagger became more politically conservative. Bagger retired in 1874. "Varden", which was founded in 1874, would later take over as the number one newspaper in Skien.
He died in 1880.

St Edward's Sapphire

The St Edward's Sapphire is a sapphire and one of the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom. It gets its name from Edward the Confessor who wore the stone in his ring. According to legend the sapphire made its first appearance in the year 1042, where it was set into Edward's coronation ring. The gem survived through Oliver Cromwell's reign and disassembly of the crown jewels and was recut into its present form for Charles II after the restoration. Queen Victoria had the stone set into the finial cross of the Imperial State Crown which was made for her coronation in 1838.
Legend of Saint John.
According to legend King Edward had great respect for John the Evangelist and was noted for his generosity towards his poorer subjects. One day on his way to Westminster Abbey he was accosted by a beggar. The King's immediate reaction was to search his pockets for some money to hand the beggar. Upon finding his pockets empty the king, without hesitation, slipped the sapphire ring off his finger and presented it to the beggar. The beggar thanked the generous monarch and departed. Many years later two pilgrims from the Holy Land returned the ring to the king saying they had met St John the Evangelist who told them he had received the ring from the king, many years earlier in the guise of a beggar. He congratulated Edward for his kindness, and said that he would see Edward in heaven in six months time. Exactly six months later the king died of chicken pox.

Horace Henry Alfred "Ossie" Pickworth (17 January 1918 – 23 September 1969) was a leading Australian professional golfer of the 1940s and 1950s, winner of three successive Australian Open titles from 1946 to 1948, the first and last of which came in playoffs against Jim Ferrier. 
Pickworth was born in Sydney.
Unlike his contemporary Ferrier, who would enjoy great success on the U.S. PGA Tour, Pickworth travelled to play only infrequently, but when he did it was with some success - he played the British circuit in 1950 and finished third in the Order of Merit after winning the Irish Open and losing a playoff for the Daily Mail tournament. 
Pickworth would collect a fourth Australian Open title in 1954, and was also a three-time winner of the Australian PGA Championship, in 1947, 1953 and 1955, among numerous professional victories on the Australian circuit.

Momir Savić

Momir Savić (born 21 January 1951, Drinsko, Višegrad) is a Bosnian Serb paramilitary commander convicted for war crimes committed during the ethnic cleansing of the Višegrad region of eastern Bosnia during the 1992-1995 Bosnian War.
Crimes.
Momir Savić was the close associate of Milan Lukić, notoriously responsible for the campaign of terror directed against Bosniak civilians in the strategically located town of Višegrad and the surrounding municipality in the spring and summer of 1992, as part of the ethnic cleansing of the Bosniak population from the Podrinja area of Eastern Bosnia.
Savić was charged by the War Crimes Chamber of the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina with persecution of the Bosniak civilian population on political, national, ethnic and religious grounds between April and September 1992, as a member of a paramilitary unit at the time the Užice Corps of the former JNA commenced operations in the Višegrad region and later as commander of the 3rd Company of the Army of Republika Srpska's Višegrad Brigade. According to the indictment, he committed these crimes by commanding, committing and participating with other individuals in murder, forced deportation, imprisonment, torture and rape. He was accused of not preventing or punishing the actions of those under his command.
The specific crimes of which he was accused included the interrogation and beating of 4 Bosniak civilians and the plundering and burning down of the houses of 2 Bosniak civilians, as member of a group of several Serb soldiers, in the village of Meremišlje on 29 April. On 23 May, in the settlement of Drinsko, he and a group of other Serb soldiers took 10 Bosniak civilians from their houses, interrogated and brutalised them and then took them to Kik hill, in Pušni Do forest and shot them. On 25 May, when one of a group of captured Bosniak civilians being beaten up by Savić and a group of other Serb soldiers tried to run away, Savić shot and killed him. Individually, between 7 June and late September 1992, on numerous occasions he went fully armed to the house of a Bosniak woman where he raped her, threatening her not to tell anyone.
Savić was also accused by Bakira Hasečić of the rape and war crime victims' organisation Association of Women Victims of War (Udruzenje Žene-Žrtve Rata) of being responsible for the disappearance of a boy named Himzo (Hamed) Oprasic from a column of 800 civilians expelled from the village of Okrugla and of committing and supervising "horrendous and heinous" crimes in the Rudo area. Women Victims of War worked determinedly for a number of years to ensure that Savić was brought to justice.
Savić was also identified by survivors as one of the armed escort who took part in the execution of at least 50 Bosniak civilian prisoners at the Paklenik ravine on 15 June 1992.
Trial.
Savić was charged with crimes against humanity under Article 172(1)(h) (persecution) of the Criminal Code of BiH (CC BiH) involving the following:
a) Depriving another person of his life (murder),
d) Deportation or forcible transfer of population,
e) Imprisonment or other severe deprivation of physical liberty in violation of fundamental rules of international law,
f) Torture,
g) Coercing another by force or by threat of immediate attack upon his life or limb, or the life or limb of a person close to him, to sexual intercourse or an equivalent sexual act (rape),
i) Enforced disappearance of persons,
k) Other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering, or serious injury to body or to physical or mental health.
all in conjunction with Article 180(1)(2) (individual and command criminal responsibility) of the CC BiH.
He pleaded not guilty. The trial commenced on 12 August 2008 and on 2 July 2009 the Bosnian War Crimes Court pronounced the first instance verdict, finding Savić guilty of crimes against humanity, and sentenced him to 18 years of imprisonment.
Abscondment.
The session of the Appellate panel of the Section I for War Crimes of the Court was held on 19 February 2010. In June 2010, when confirmation of Savić's conviction was announced, he failed to respond to the bail conditions set at the time of his release from jail in late 2008 during the appeal. He has not been seen since. Judge Saban Maksumić, presiding judge of the Bosnian War Crimes Court, was severely criticised for allowing Savić to remain at liberty pending sentencing.̪

Flying Kukris

The Flying Kukris are a youth (aged 6 to 18) rugby union club based in Hong Kong.
The name was derived from the helicopters of RAF 28 Squadron - hence the 'Flying', and the Ghurkhas soldiers' a traditional Nepalese knife - the 'Kukri'. It was first started for the British military who were based at the RAF Sek Kong. Training takes place at their HKIEd Sports Centre ground in the New Territories from on Sundays between September and April. Minis (aged under 12) participate in occasional local tournaments and the Colts participate in the HKRFU-run League. The Club offers players to the HKRFU for consideration for national selection. Some U12 and above players compete in the annual New Years Day Peninsula v Island matches. Colts players compete for seven-a-side places representing Peninsula on the Saturday of the Sevens weekend.
In August 2010, the Flying Kukris introduced a U18B team with a small core of die-hards from the successful 2009-10 U16B team. To build out number, the U18B will be working with TSW Eagles.
In late 2010, the Flying Kukris have an agreement with the Nomads RFC; allowing FK to benefit from the senior experience of the Nomads and bringing 2 Nomads coaches in to support the Girls Colts and U18B.
With the start of the August 2011 season, the Flying Kukris sponsors changed to Schneider Electric, Universal, Hyatt Regency ShaTin and Ball. Colts age banding in HK was modified such that the U18 became U19; for the first time in over a decade, FK had its own U19B squad. The relationship with TSW to support other age groups continued. Nomads RFC was rebranded as HK Scottish though the coaching support continued.

Diet-induced obese

Diet-induced obesity (DIO) model, is a model created to study obesity and its co-morbidities such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis. In this model, an animal (mouse, rat, dog or non-human primate) is fed a high fat diet or high fat/high sugar diet for a number of weeks. As a result, it becomes obese, and usually hyperglycemic, and develops impaired glucose tolerance. These mice are then used to study the genetic and physiological mechanisms of obesity and type 2 diabetes and to test drug candidates that are expected to affect these conditions in humans.

Fernando Castro Palao

Fernando Castro Palao (b. at León in 1581; d. at Medina, 1 December 1633) was a Spanish Jesuit. theologian.
Life.
At the age of fifteen, in 1596, he entered the Society of Jesus. He taught philosophy at Valladolid, moral theology at Compostela, and scholastic theology at Salamanca. 
Later he became rector of the College of Medina, and consultor and qualificator of the Holy Inquisition. He filled these three offices until his death.
Theologian.
He excelled as a moral theologian; his classes of moral theology were attended by a greater number of students than were ever known to follow the course at Compostella. His decisions were regarded as oracles, and difficult cases were submitted to him for solution. Alphonsus Liguori numbers him among the principal authorities on moral theology (Dissert. schol. mor., Naples, 1755, c. iv, n. 119) and Jean-Pierre Gury calls him "a probabilist, a most learned, wise, erudite, and prolific author."
Works.
His "Opus Morale" comprises seven volumes, and covers in the same number of treatises, the whole field of moral theology. It appeared first at Lyon, 1631–51; its fifth edition is dated 1700. A general index to the whole work is found in the fourth volume of this last edition, and also in the third edition, which appeared at Venice in 1721.
Immediately after his death (1633) there appeared at Valladolid a meditation book written by him, entitled, "Manual del Cristiano de varias consideraciones para el exercico santa de la oracion." The first part of this work contains meditations on the end of man; the second treats of the life of Christ and his Blessed Mother; the third considers God Himself and in his relations to us. 
An English translation of a letter of Castro Palao on the death of Thomas White appeared in "The Month" for 1890 (vol. 69, pp. 91–93).

Colorado Springs Guidelines

The Colorado Springs Guidelines address gender issues in Bible translation, in response to "gender-neutral" Bible translations.
According to two participants at the Colorado Springs meeting, the final list of guidelines was compiled by reference to two separate lists drafted by each of the two ostensibly opposing parties who had agreed to the meeting to discuss their differences. One list was supplied by concerned scholars and pastors, the other by Ken Barker on behalf of translators and publishers.
The guidelines have found wide support amongst opponents of gender neutral translations, but have been criticised by supporters of gender neutral translations.

Nanjing No.1 High School

Nanjing No. 1 High School is a high school in Nanjing, Jiangsu, China, located on the bank of the Qinhuai River.
History.
Nanjing No. 1 High School dates back to 33rd year of Emperor Guangxu (1907). At that time, Sun Shao Yun and three other local leaders established "Chong Wen School" in Nanjing for children from the southern district of the Old City and provided them a place to study. In 1927, the government decided to set Nanjing as the capital city of China, and the school was renamed as the Capital City Central Experimental School which was inspired by Mr.Cai Yuanpei. It then became the first public middle school in Nanjing.
In the spring of 1927, the National Revolutionary Army occupied southern China. On April 18, Chiang Kai-shek started a national government, with Nanjing as its base. The government declared Nanjing the capital of the Republic of China. After the summer break, Nanjing Municipal Government set up five “experimental” schools in the central, western, eastern, southern, and northern districts respectively. Among them, the central capital experimental school was located at the corner of Zhonghua Avenue and Fu Xi Street. The location was the western garden of the Qing dynasty governor. From the 28th to the 29th year of Emperor Guangxu's era, “Three Rivers Normal School” (now called Nanjing University) was temporarily relocated to this location when the school started operating. Since the 33rd year of Emperor Guangxu, Chong Wen School, Jiang Ning First Elementary School, Jiang Ning county junior high school all started at this location.
In the year of 1933, the school was renamed as Nanjing City No.1 High School.
The land that the school currently occupies was previously used as a garden by a Qing dynasty official.

Navigant Consulting

Navigant () is a specialized expert services firm.
Based in Chicago, Illinois, Navigant has over forty offices across the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia. 
2012 revenues were $845 million. The company has been listed among Forbes' Best Run Small Companies and Fortune's Fastest Growing Companies. The company's stock is a member of the S&P 400 index.
History.
Formation.
Navigant Consulting was formed in 1999 under the name The Metzler Group Inc., a global management consulting company serving energy-based and other regulated industries. Founded in 1983 by Richard Metzler, the Metzler Group became a public company in October 1996, offering stock trades on the Nasdaq National Market under the ticker symbol “METZ.” In July 1999, the company received full shareholder approval to change the company’s name to Navigant Consulting, Inc. Shortly afterwards, Navigant Consulting’s stock listing was moved to the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol “NCI.” The company’s new name was meant to reflect its ability to help clients navigate changing business conditions.
Mergers and acquisitions.
Navigant expanded its range of services and international reach through a number of acquisitions.
In 1998, The Metzler Group merged with Peterson Consulting, an information management and technology firm specializing in information services, data processing, damage assessment and quantifying lost profits, regulatory compliance, process operations management and litigation support. Under the terms of the merger, Peterson Consulting became a wholly owned subsidiary and independent operating unit of The Metzler Group.
Navigant took advantage of the collapse of audit titan Arthur Andersen in 2002, absorbing the practices of 8 Chicago partners (plus 82 staff) in May and the Washington DC-based Government Contacts practice (3 partners and 34 staff) the next month.
Navigant then acquired Tucker Alan in February 2004, a privately held litigation and business consulting firm specializing in core litigation support services. With offices in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle, the Tucker Alan acquisition helped strengthen Navigant’s west coast presence and further develop the firm’s national platform.
Focusing its purchases on firms in the financial services and healthcare industry, Navigant bought the corporate finance consultancy Casas Benjamin & White in February 2005. The firm focused on corporate restructuring and transactional solutions. Several months later, the Tiber Group, a healthcare management consulting firm providing healthcare executives with strategic advisory services, was also purchased.
Other 2005 acquisitions included A.W. Hutchison, the construction litigation services firm assisting owners, contractors, and counsel with distressed engagements and projects in litigation, as well as the forensic accounting and litigation consulting and business valuation practices of Kroll Lindquist Avey in Canada - a subsidiary of Kroll, Inc.
In March 2006, Navigant acquired Precept Programme Management Limited, an independent dispute advisory and program management consulting firm based in the UK. In December, the firm acquired HP3, a nationally recognized management consulting firm that assisted senior healthcare executives with clinical documentation, coding, and data solutions for improved reimbursement, compliance, and patient care.
In 2007, Navigant added two additional UK based consultancies to its portfolio: the program management and public procurement firm, Augmentis, in June 2007, followed by the Troika acquisition in August. Troika provided operational performance improvement solutions to organizations in the financial services industry.
Chicago Partners of Illinois was acquired in May 2008, adding economics expertise to the firm’s portfolio. Founded in 1994, it specialized in economic and financial analysis and assisted law firms, corporations and government agencies with securities litigation, antitrust, valuation and asset pricing, forensic accounting, intellectual property, and labor market discrimination.
In 2009, Navigant acquired The Bard Group, a Boston based healthcare consulting firm that provided physician leadership and performance improvement services to healthcare executives, community hospitals, and physician groups in programs designed to ensure physician engagement.
In early 2010, Navigant acquired Summit Blue, a leading energy efficiency and renewable energy consulting firm and the Washington DC based economics consulting firm, Empiris. In May, Navigant acquired Daylight Forensic & Advisory LLC, an international regulatory consulting and investigative firm specializing in financial investigations, AML consulting, regulatory compliance, forensic technology services, and fraud risk management.
In October 2010, the firm has acquired EthosPartner, a national healthcare consulting group specializing in physician and hospital alignment, physician practice operations management, and physician revenue cycle management.
In July 2011, the company acquired Ignited Discovery, an electronic evidence and discovery services provider. In October 2011, the Company acquired Paragon Health, a national physician practice management and consulting firm specializing in Cardiovascular practices.
In October 2012, the company acquired Easton Associates, a strategic market consulting firm for the life sciences, healthcare, medical device and pharmaceutical industries with offices in New York, London and Beijing. 7 Mile Advisors acted as the sell-side advisor to Easton.
Services.
Navigant sells four core services:
Dispute & Investigative.
Navigant’s disputes and investigative professionals offer litigation consulting, forensic accounting and financial investigations, damages analysis, business valuation, and discovery management to corporate counsel and law firms. This team provides expert testimony in matters involving the state and federal courts as well as administrative and regulatory proceedings and international arbitrations.
Financial Advisory.
Navigant’s corporate finance business unit, Navigant Capital Advisors (NCA) serves the middle market investment banking, restructuring, valuation, and transaction advisory needs of companies, private equity groups, lenders, and other creditor constituencies.
Economics.
The Economic Consulting practice is composed of academic and industry professionals with backgrounds in economics and finance. Consultants provide economic analyses of complex legal and business issues for law firms, corporations, and government agencies.
Management Consulting.
The management consulting professionals provide operational, performance and regulatory assistance to companies undergoing significant business challenges across a variety of industries including energy, financial services, government, and healthcare.
Studies/Research.
The Risk Management Paradox.
Navigant partnered with the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) to conduct a pulse survey on risk management effectiveness. The survey reached out to 180 financial executives globally and focused on the evolving role of risk management in financial institutions. According to the survey results, Financial Services companies are confident about their risk management systems. However, results suggest that the process surrounding them and ensuring effective implementation require improvement. In light of lessons learned from the credit crisis, financial services firms plan to pay more attention to the impact of risk on enterprise business and profitability, rather than merely complying with arbitrary levels of risk exposure and performance.
Credit Crisis Litigation Doubles in 2008, Navigant Consulting Study Finds.
Navigant conducted a study on the number of sub prime-related filings in 2008. The study shows that cases filed in federal courts in 2008 were twice the number filed in 2007. According to the report, “2008: Seeking Relief,” the credit crisis produced 576 new litigation matters in U.S. federal courts. The number of filings peaked at 179 cases in the first quarter of 2008, but new cases continued to be filed through the year and even trended up slightly following the Lehman bankruptcy filing in September 2008. According to this report, new sub prime-related litigation matters will continue to increase in 2009.
North American Natural Gas Supply Assessment.
Commissioned by the American Clean Skies Foundation, Navigant conducted a study in 2008 to assess the current state of natural gas production in North America and determine the long-term viability of natural gas as a clean energy solution. The study focused on natural gas production from three unconventional sources; tight sands, coalbed methane, and gas from shale formations. According to the study, the United States has enough natural gas reserves to last over 100 years. While all three natural gas sources have increased production in the last decade, natural gas production from shale formation had grown at an exponential rate to 5 billion cubic feet a day. Given the natural gas production of shale and recent technological advancements, researchers believe the U.S. has the potential to expand the use of domestically produced natural gas for power generation and even vehicle fuel. Navigant's conclusions as to the U.S. potential supply were considered radical at the time of the study, but have now been borne out by the industry and by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.[
Name and Branding.
In March 2003, Navigant announced the launch of its new brand and visual identity. As part of the new brand strategy, all former legacy companies and subsidiaries were united under the Navigant name.

The new web site leverages virtual experience technologies to create an interactive forum for connecting with clients. The Knowledge Center, which invites users to explore business insights and perspectives in an interactive 3D environment, serves as a central repository for thought leadership. It provides information to clients through white papers, articles, reports, webcasts and videos. Visitors can read about issues that impact their business, including perspectives on the credit crisis and renewable energy.
Staff.

The program is also designed to ensure the organization continues to demonstrate the leadership competencies, values, and cultural attributes required to successfully attract, develop, and retain top talent and key client relationships from the diverse and global markets the company serves.

During 2008, Navigant hosted a number of programs to help educate and empower young people, such as the child mentor program, young women’s conference, and young persons programme in London.
Criticism.
King-Harbor Accounting Scandal.
In 2005, Navigant Consulting was accused of overcharging Los Angeles County in a contract to work at Martin Luther King Jr.-Harbor Hospital in Willowbrook, CA. County auditors rejected over $206,000 in expenses, including unauthorized first-class airfare to and from Los Angeles and determined that Navigant had deleted from their to-do list a number of tasks and goals that they had failed to accomplish. Despite Navigant's work, King-Harbor failed to meet federal standards for Medicare funding in 2006. prompting the county to undergo a radical restructuring plan for the hospital.
Long Island Power Authority Contract.
In June 2013, a New York state commission, which was appointed by Governor Andrew Cuomo to examine the Long Island Power Authority's handling of Hurricane Sandy, found evidence of “highly questionable” billing practices and “exorbitant” expenses charged by Navigant and referred its findings to federal prosecutors. Michael D. Hervey, former acting chief executive of the authority, took a job with Navigant after signing approximately $30 million in contracts to Navigant.

Soviet War Memorial (Schönholzer Heide)

The Soviet War Memorial in Schönholzer Heide (Sowjetisches Ehrenmal in der Schönholzer Heide) in Pankow, Berlin was erected in the period between May 1947 and November 1949 and covers an area of 30 000 m².
Schönholzer Heide was in the 19th century a popular recreation area. During the Second World War the place was turned into a work camp. After the war the north-western part of the area was used to build the third largest Soviet war memorial in Berlin, together with the memorials in Treptower Park and Tiergarten. 
A group of Soviet architects consisting of A. Solowjew, M. Belarnzew, W. D. Koroljew and the sculptor Iwan G. Perschudtschew made the sketch for the cemetery, where 13,200 of the 80,000 Soviet soldiers that had fallen during the battle of Berlin, should be buried. On a wall around the memorial there are 100 bronze tablets where the names, ranks and birth dates of the soldiers it was possible to identify, are written. This group constitutes about one fifth of the fallen soldiers.
On both side of the main axis, which at its end one finds a 33,5 meter tall obelisk made of syenite, there are placed 8 burial chambers where 1182 soldiers are buried. Under the Honor Hall inside the obelisk there are buried two Soviet colonels.
A statue of the Russian Mother Earth is situated in front of the obelisk and constitutes the main point of the memorial. On the statue's base, which is made out of black porphyry, one finds 42 bronze tablets on which the names of fallen officers are inscribed.

Ehrengrab

An ehrengrab (German: "Ehrengrab"; English: 'grave of honor') is a distinction granted by certain German, Swiss and Austrian cities to some of their citizens for extraordinary services or achievements in their lifetimes. If there are no descendants or institutions to care for the gravesites, the communities or cities will take responsibility for the graves and for financing their care.
Many ehrengrabs ("Ehrengräber") also serve to document cultural history; for example, when a cemetery containing artistically notable graves is closed and the graves are moved at public expense.
The basic details of the awarding, financing and care of honorary graves are similarly handled in all German-speaking countries. Berlin and Vienna maintain the largest number of such sites.
Cities.
Berlin.
In Berlin about 200 cemeteries contain approximately 740 tombs of honor with about 800 "Ehrengräber". The difference between the number of tombs and graves of honor is explained by the fact that some family tombs honor several individuals. Berlin public memorial graves are under the legislation of the Berlin Senate dating to 1952, labeled as "General Instructions for the recognition, transfer and maintenance ..." regarding tombs subject to benefits. The current basis is §12, Paragraph 6 of the "Law on the state-owned and non-state-owned cemeteries in Berlin" (Cemeteries Act) of 1 November 1995.
As such, Berlin provides at public expense honorary graves, available to:
Among those who have such tombs of honor in Berlin are Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Bertolt Brecht, Wilhelm Busch, Theodor Fontane, Brothers Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm Georg Ludwig Hartig, Heinrich von Kleist, Hildegard Knef, Otto Lilienthal, Herbert Marcuse Felix Mendelssohn, Marg Moll Helmut Newton, Ernst Reuter, Joachim Ringelnatz, Heinrich Zille and Arnold Zweig.
The Friedrichsfelde Central Cemetery contains a socialist monument with graves of honor, among them are the socialists Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg.
Vienna.
Graves of honor are called "Gewidmete Gräber der Stadt Wien" (Dedicated tombs of the City of Vienna). The name "Ehrengräber" is reserved for tombs in the Central Cemetery of Vienna. To make the cemetery more attractive, famous citizens such as Ludwig van Beethoven and Franz Schubert were exhumed and transferred to the cemetery. Funerary monuments were built for others, such as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Hundreds of graves of honor are found in cemeteries in Vienna.
Zurich.
The city of Zurich maintains an anonymous tomb of honor near the Nordheim crematorium. It is a common tomb for people who have donated their bodies to the Anatomical Institute of the University of Zurich for the needs of science and wished that their urn would be stored there. Some graves originate from the medical faculties of universities in other cities of Switzerland, Germany and Austria, and the maintenance costs for the graves are generally borne by the responsible institutions.

Mariappan Saravanan

Major Mariappan Saravanan ( – ), was an officer in the prestigious Bihar Regiment of the Indian Army who was killed during the Kargil War. He was killed in hand to hand combat with intruders after killing four intruders in the Batalik area of Kargil Sector on , along with 33 soldiers and four other officers. Saravanan had just completed four years of service on . 
Major Sarvanan was possibly the first officer killed in the Kargil War. The attack led by him came in the early stages of the conflict when adequate information was not available. The men in 1 Bihar took an oath after Maj. Sarvanan’s fall to fight to the finish and recover the heights, to the battle cry of ‘Bajrang Bali ki Jai’, they launched subsequent offensives that saw it not just take the heights but drive the Pakistanis all the way across the Line of Control. His actions have led to him being referred to as the "Hero of Batalik".
Biography.
Childhood.
Born on on the island of Rameswaram in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, Saravanan was commissioned into the famous Bihar Regiment on from OTA Chennai. He began his schooling at Kendriya Vidyalaya in Gaya district and later graduated from St. Joseph's College, Tiruchirapalli in 1992. 
Saravanan was also the president of the student union at St. Joseph's College in 1992, an interesting development since the most popular candidate (Thirichelvam) could not stand for election that year and all support went to Saravanan. Saravanan at college had a thin body frame and is a C certificate holder of NCC INFANTRY UNIT.
His father Lt. Colonel Adi Mariappan died in a road accident in Bangalore in while serving in the Indian Peace Keeping Force during Operation Pawan in Sri Lanka. Major M Saravanan was survived by Mrs A Mariappan, his mother, and two sisters. The elder one, Chitra, is a doctor whereas the younger one Revathi is a Computer Engineer.
Military career.
The 27-year-old officer Saravanan, as a Major in the Indian Army fell defending the peaks of Batalik in the Kargil war. 
After completing his schooling in various places—Belgaum, Kannoor, Gurdaspur, Jorhat and Bihar, he joined St Joseph's College in Tiruchi. "After college he tried to get into the National Defence Academy and landed up in the Officers Training Academy," says his closest friend Amalraj. He graduated from the OTA in 1995 and joined the First Bihar regiment as a lieutenant. After joining the Army he had served at places like Tamulpur, Cooch Behar and Bhutan before moving to Kargil. He was made captain the following year and major in 1999. 
They were a bunch of three friends—Saravanan, Karthik and Amalraj. A few years ago, they had made a trip to Kanyakumari. On the way, their bus driver fell asleep on the wheel and crashed headlong into an incoming lorry. "Seven people died on the spot and many were injured. We students were in a shock. But not Saravanan, he was cool. He went about checking the dead. Then he helped the injured into passing vehicles and took them to hospital. It was his army background that made him react to an emergency so calmly and resolutely." Amalraj is an IPS officer now and the Deputy Inspector General of Police in the Trichy Range of Tamil Nadu.
The Kargil War.
The First Bihar Regiment was in Assam when the Kargil War broke out. They were ordered to move to Kargil, Jammu and Kashmir. From the heat of Assam to the cold of Kargil wasn't an easy change. There wasn't enough protective weather gear.
On the night of , Major Sarvanan was assigned the task of capturing a well-fortified Pakistani position at in the Batalik sector. He and his men launched an attack at 04:00. Despite intensive firing from the enemy with artillery and automatic weapons, they charged into a volley of bullets. Saravanan fired a rocket launcher into the enemy position that killed two enemy soldiers. During the combat, he was hit by shrapnel and injured but continued fighting. His commanding officer ordered him to retreat because too many Indian soldiers had been injured. 'Genghis Khan fall back,' came the order. 'Not today sir, we are very close to the objective,' replied Sarvanan who was code named Genghis Khan. He killed two more invaders but this time he was hit by a bullet in the head at 06:30, his body nestled in the snow. A friend in Bangalore called his mother and told her Saravanan had died in Kargil. "We switched on the television and saw it in a news bulletin." Two days later, the official telegram arrived. "He was the first officer to fall".
The Vir Chakra was awarded to Saravanan posthumously and presented to his mother by President K. R. Narayanan. Its citation reads: "For our tomorrow... he gave his today...".

Better the Devil You Know (Sonia song)

"Better the Devil You Know" is a pop song written and produced by Brian Teasdale and Dean Collinson for Sonia. This single was released in April 1993 as the second and final single from Sonia's third album "Better the Devil You Know" (1993). This single's B-side "Not What I Call Love" appeared on Sonia's third album. "Better the Devil You Know" was United Kingdom's entry at the Eurovision Song Contest 1993.
Song information.
For "A Song for Europe 1993", the BBC asked the heads of each of the Eurovision Network member broadcasters for their opinion regarding who should represent the United Kingdom from a shortlist the BBC had prepared. A plurality chose 22-year-old recording artist Sonia, who already had a #1 hit to her credit. She then sang eight different songs at the national final. For the second year running, a nationwide telephone vote was held to pick one song to send to the Eurovision finals, held this year at Millstreet, County Cork, Ireland. "Better the Devil You Know", the fifth song performed, won with over 156,000 supporters, twice as many as the second-place entry.
At Millstreet, the song was performed nineteenth on the night, after Bosnia and Herzegovina's Fazla with "Sva bol svijeta", and before the Netherlands' Ruth Jacott with "Vrede." At the end of judging that evening, "Better the Devil You Know" took the second-place slot with 164 points. Belgium, Iceland, Austria and Israel gave the UK 12 points that evening. This was the last of four occasions the UK ranked second in the voting since 1988.
The song was a retro rock 'n' roll offering with a 1950s flair. Sonia tells the story about how in love she is with her boyfriend, wishing he won't hurt her, for her love is true. She lets it known that she would "sell her heart and soul" to get his unconditional love in return, rationalising that it's better that one deal with "the devil you know" (him with his faults) instead of "the devil you don't" (another potential boyfriend). 
Commenting on the song, Collinson stated that he'd written the song years before in an attempt to recreate "Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go" by Wham!. The song was played as part of a "Eurovision special" on "TOTP2". DJ Steve Wright commented during the song's introduction, "This is a good song, but Sonia is a bit too eager to please, so therefore didn't give it the required 'I don't care too much about Eurovision' attitude", implying that was her downfall. The second loss to Ireland in as many years prompted a bit of speculation in the British tabloid press; one of the most popular stories spread was that Sonia took Eurovision so seriously and hoped she would win that she sobbed uncontrollably after she learned she lost. For her part, immediately after the winner was known, Sonia accepted defeat in a humble manner, smiled, and shook winner Niamh Kavanagh's hand.
After Eurovision, the song peaked at #15 on the UK Singles Chart, and was in the chart for 7 weeks.

Two days later on 11 November 2008, a second timeshift, Pulse +45mins, was closed down, which suddenly fell off the air. However it did later return on 24 November 2008 after Pulse +30mins closed down. The Pulse +30mins EPG slot was replaced by OBE TV. Pulse was removed from the Sky EPG on 10 February 2009. Pulse +45mins was replaced by Rural TV on 2 March 2009.
It featured coverage of E-sports and in this respect, it differs from other examples of video game programming in the country, such as Cybernet, which had a broader remit, to cover video games in general. The channel is closely paired to its own self-titled website. The online resource encourages community discussion, while also serving as a platform to organise tournaments and invitational events, some of which may later be screened, on the channel, via its flagship programme, "The Match".
While the televised matches regularly feature members of recognised, successful gaming clans such as Team Dignitas, and individual victors of major gaming tournaments including Apollo - Shaun Clark Xleague.tv also encourages enthusiasts and non-professionals to get involved in the community (and thus, potentially, The Match) through the game-specific clubs and leagues set up in a way that ensures that players of like strength compete together.
History.
The channel started in May 2007 as X League.tv but in February 2008, it was revealed that the channel had entered into an agreement with US men's entertainment channel MavTV, who had provided the niche sports content, and the channel would be re-branded as Pulse, which would be made up of separately branded XLEAGUE.TV and Mav blocks, with- according to Digital Spy- XLeague are in talks with other providers to provide further programming blocks.
On Monday 25 February 2008, the Xleague.tv channel was rebranded as expected to "Pulse". The channel still retains all the Xleague programmes and website, prior to the rebrand.

Pfarrernotbund

The Pfarrernotbund () was an organisation founded on 11 September 1933 to unite German evangelical theologians, pastors and church office-holders against the introduction of the Aryan paragraph into the 28 Protestant regional church bodies and the Deutsche Evangelische Kirche (DEK) and against the efforts by Reich-bishop Ludwig Müller and the German Christians (DC) since April 1933 to merge the German evangelical churches into one "Reich's church", that would be Nazi in ideology and entirely lacking any Jewish or Christian origins. As a Christian resistance to National Socialism it was the forerunner of the Confessing Church, founded the following year.
Prelude.
Hitler discretionarily ordered unconstitutional and premature re-elections of all presbyters and synodals in all the Protestant regional church bodies in Germany for July 23, 1933. In this election the Nazi Faith Movement of the German Christians gained an average of 70-80% of all seats in the presbyteries and synods. Only in a minority of congregations the German Christians gained no majority. Only in 4 regional synods other church parties held the majority of the seats, those were the synods of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bavaria, the Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Hanover, and the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Württemberg, and the provincial synod of the ecclesiastical province of Westphalia, a regional substructure within the Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union, which itself had a "German Christian" majority in its general synod. In 1934 the new Nazi-submissive general leadership of the old-Prussian Church suspended the Westphalian provincial synod. The opposition among Protestant parishioners and pastors thus regarded only the former three church bodies as uncorrupted "intact churches", as opposed to the other than so-called "destroyed churches".
On September 5 and 6 the same year the "General Synod" of the "Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union" convened. The "German Christians" used their new majority, as they had done earlier in many provincial synods to the effect to adopt the so-called "Aryan paragraph" () as church law, thus demanding that employees of the "Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union" - being all baptised Protestant church members -, who had grandparents, who were enrolled as Jews, or who were married with such persons, were all to be dismissed.
On 7 April 1933 the Nazi Reich's government had introduced an equivalent law for all state officials and employees. By introducing the Nazi racist attitudes into the "Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union", the approving synodals betrayed the Christian sacrament of baptism, according to which this act makes a person a Christian, superseding any other faith, which oneself may have been observing before and knowing nothing about any racial affinity as a prerequisite of being a Christian, let alone one's grandparents' religious affiliation being an obstacle to being a Christian.
When on September 5 Karl Koch, then praeses of the Westphalian provincial synod, tried to bring forward the arguments of the opposition against the "Aryan paragraph" and the abolition of synodal and presbyterial democracy, the majority of "German Christian" general synodals shouted him down. The "German Christians" abused the general synod as a mere acclamation, like a Nazi party convention. Koch and his partisans left the synod. The majority of German Christians thus voted in the "Aryan paragraph" for all the "Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union". On September 5 the general synodals passed the retroactive church law, which only established the function and title of bishop, already prior used by Reich's Bishop Ludwig Müller, calling himself also state bishop () of the old-Prussian Church. The same law renamed the ecclesiastical provinces into bishoprics (, sg./pl.), each led - according to the new law of September 6 - by a provincial bishop () replacing the prior general superintendents.
Rudolf Bultmann and Hans von Soden, professors of Protestant theology at the Philip's University in Marburg upon Lahn, wrote in their assessment in 1933, that the "Aryan paragraph" contradicts the Protestant confession of everybody's right to perform her or his faith freely. "The Gospel is to be universally preached to all peoples and races and makes all baptised persons insegregable brethren to each other. Therefore unequal rights, due to national or racial arguments, are inacceptable as well as any segregation."
By enabling the dismissal of all Protestants of Jewish descent from jobs with the "Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union" and other regional church bodies, the official church bodies accepted the Nazi racist doctrine of anti-Semitism. This breach with Christian principles within the range of the church was unacceptable to many church members. Nevertheless, pursuing Martin Luther's doctrine of the Doctrine of the Two Regiments (God rules within the world: Directly within the church and in the state by means of the secular government) many church members could not see any basis, how a Protestant church body could interfere with the anti-Semitism performed in the state sphere, since in its self-conception the church body was a religious, not a political organisation.
Only few parishioners and clergy, mostly of Reformed tradition, followed Jean Cauvin's doctrine of the "Kingdom of Christ" within the church and the world. Among them were Karl Barth and Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who demanded the church bodies to oppose the abolition of democracy and the unlawfulness in the general political sphere.
Especially pastors in the countryside were outraged about this development. Herbert Goltzen, Eugen Weschke, and Günter Jacob, three pastors from Lower Lusatia, regarded the introduction of the "Aryan paragraph" as the violation of the confession. In late summer 1933 Jacob, pastor in Noßdorf (a part of today's Forst in Lusatia), developed the central theses, which became the self-commitment of the opponents.
Gathering the opposition in the Emergency Covenant of Pastors.
On September 11, 1933 Gerhard Jacobi, pastor of William I Memorial Church, Berlin, gathered ca. 60 opposing pastors, who clearly saw the breach of Christian and Protestant principles. Weschke and Günter Jacob proposed to found the "Pfarrernotbund", and so they did, electing Pastor Martin Niemöller their president. On the basis of the theses of Günter Jacob its members concluded that a schism was a matter of fact, a new Protestant church was to be established, since the official "destroyed churches" were anti-Christian, heretical and therefore illegitimate. Each pastor joining the Covenant - until the end of September 1933 2,036 out of a total of 18,842 Protestant pastors in Germany acceded - had to sign that he rejected the "Aryan paragraph".
In 1934 the Covenant counted 7,036 members, after 1935 the number sank to 4,952, among them 374 retired pastors, 529 auxiliary preachers and 116 candidates of ministry.

Dudjom Lingpa

Dudjom Lingpa (1835–1904) was a known meditation master, visionary, terton of the Nyingma tradition of Mantrayana and a Dzogchen master of the modern era of principal importance (particularly in the area of 'refining perception' or Nang Jang) at his time. A well known belief exists about his ability to receive direct transmissions (Wylie: "nye-brgyud") of the Mindstream or 'heart-mind transmission/continuum' (Wylie: "thugs-brgyud") of a number of lineage holder(s) such as (Wylie: "rig-dzin") and Buddha(s) (Wylie: "sang-gyay") Sri Singha, Saraha, Vajradhara and Manjushri.
Dudjom Tersar.
"Dudjom Tersar" is the collective name for the large collection of Terma teachings revealed by Dudjom Lingpa and Dudjom Rinpoche. As a class of texts, "Tersar" (Wylie: gTer gSar) means 'new or recently revealed treasure teachings'. Dudjom Rinpoche was a major terton (Wylie: gTer sTon) or treasure revealer of hidden teachings.
The following quote links Dudjom Tersar with the Three Roots, yidam, deity yoga, Padmasambhava, Sariputra, Saraha, Sakyamuni Buddha and Yeshé Tsogyel:
The Dudjom Tersar is a powerful and complete cycle of tantric transmissions deriving from Dudjom Lingpa and his reincarnation Dudjom Yeshe Dorje (1904-1987). It focuses on Three Roots (guru, tutelary deity, and goddess) deity yogas and associated primordial awareness yogas that derive from the teachings of Guru Padmasambhava of India and his close student, the Princess Yeshe Tsogyelma. Dudjom Lingpa and Dudjom Yeshe Dorje are no other than Guru Sakyamuni's own student Sariputra, and also the Great Adept / Mahasiddha Saraha.
Nang Jang.
"Nang-jang" (refinement of perception) is the name given to a visionary text of the Tibetan Dzogchen tradition, in which the Dzogchen master, Dudjom Lingpa, experiences visionary visitation from fourteen awakened beings, including Avalokiteshvara and Longchenpa, who teach him of the illusionality of all things and their ultimate dependence upon a universal 'ground of being'.
According to the teachings bestowed upon Dudjom Lingpa by the highly advanced spiritual beings who visit him in this text, all phenomenal, sensible things are empty and illusory. Yet there is that which is not separate from them, nor they from it, and which can be described as the 'ground of being'. Orgyan Tsokyey Dorje (one of the spiritual visitants) states:
'All sensory appearances are not other than the ground of being, but are of one taste with that ground itself, like the reflections of all the planets and stars in the ocean that are not other than the ocean, but are of one taste with the water itself.'
The text also tells of how the Buddha nature, the heart of awareness, is utterly pure and lucid and constitutes the very life essence of all things, both samsaric and nirvanic. Ekajati declares:
'Since the fundamental nature of awareness, buddha nature, is pristine and lucid, free of sullying factors, it is "utter lucidity". Since it is endowed with the seven indestructible vajra / adamantine attributes, it is "vajra". And since it abides as the vital essence of all phenomena of samsara and nirvana, it is "heart essence".
This is ultimate reality, a state of truth beyond ordinary mundane consciousness and beyond the power of words to describe. It is designated by Zurchhung Sheyrab Dragpa in the text as 'a supreme and inexpressible state', the 'fundamental nature beyond ordinary consciousness'. The practitioner of this spiritual path is urged to strive for obtaining of an ultimate all-knowingness which transcends time: 
'Hold this to be the most excellent key point - to practice with intense and unflagging exertion until you attain supreme timeless awareness ["jnana"], which is total omniscience.'

Mishmeret

Mishmeret (, "lit." Position or Post) is a moshav in central Israel. Located in the Sharon plain near Netanya and the HaSharon Junction and covering 3,800 dunams, it falls under the jurisdiction of Lev HaSharon Regional Council. In 2009 it had a population of 972.
The village was founded in 1946 by demobilised soldiers from the British Army near the Arab village of Miska. During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War the community moved to Herut, and was re-established after the war on its present site. Its name symbolises the steadfast courage of the Jewish ex-British soldiers who defended the land from the Arabs. Today the moshav farms chickens, flowers, exports sweet potatoes and other vegetables.
Land ownership disputes.
During the British Mandate "The Case of the Miska Village Lands" was heard by the Haifa Land Court for 7 years (1932-1939), with unknown outcome. According to Khalidi, Mishmeret was built on the land of the Palestinian village of Miska, which was depopulated in April 1948.

<doc id="18524907" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18524907" title="Aryan paragraph">
Aryan paragraph

An Aryan paragraph () is a clause in the statutes of an organization, corporation, or real estate deed that reserves membership and/or right of residence solely for members of the "Aryan race" and excludes from such rights any non-Aryans, particularly Jews or those of Jewish descent. They were an essential aspect of public life in Germany and Austria from 1885 to 1945.
In Austria and Germany.
One of the first documentable examples of such a paragraph was written by the Austrian nationalist leader and anti-Semite Georg von Schönerer in his nationalistic Linz Program of 1882, and countless German national sports-clubs, song societies, school clubs, harvest circles and fraternities followed suit to also include Aryan paragraphs in their statutes. However, the best-known Aryan paragraphs are to be found in the legislation of Nazi Germany. They served as regulations to exclude Jews from organizations, federations, parties, and, ultimately, all public life.
Based on the bylaws and programs of antisemitic organizations and parties of the late 19th century (as the German Social Party in 1889), the Aryan Paragraph first appeared in the Third Reich in the formulation of the Civil Service Law. It stipulated that only those of Aryan descent, without Jewish parents or grandparents, could be employed in public service, especially in an official capacity (see Aryan certificate). The Aryan Paragraph was extended to education on 25 April 1933, in the Law against the Overcrowding of German Schools and Universities. On June 30 of the same year, it was broadened to entail that even marriage to a "non-Aryan" sufficed for exclusion from a civil service career. In keeping with Nazi synchronization (Gleichschaltung), Nazi Party pressure led many federations and organizations to adopt the Aryan Paragraph. Thus, Jews were barred from the public health system, lost their honorary public offices, were driven from editorial offices (Editor Law) and theaters (Reichskulturkammer), and were excluded from agriculture (Reichserbhofgesetz), a progression culminating in the Nuremberg Laws "for the final separation of Jewry from the German "Volk". At the outset, there were exceptions to this discrimination (combat veterans, service in the National Rising ["Erhebung"], honorary Aryans, and so on), but now Jews and "Jewish mixed-breeds" (Mischlinge) were confronted with a ban on nearly all professions. The Aryan Paragraph was accepted largely without protest, except that within the Evangelical Church it provoked the splitting off of the Confessing Church.
In the United States.
Although not strictly speaking the same as the Nazi Aryan paragraph, which was legally required by the German government, a somewhat analogous practice occurred on an individual basis in the United States up until 1948. Many real estate deeds in the United States issued by builders of subdivisions included a restrictive covenant that stated property could not be inhabited by members of a certain race. The United States Supreme Court ruled in "Shelley v. Kraemer", 334 U.S. 1 (1948) that while such covenants are not strictly speaking illegal, their enforcement by state and federal courts violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution; thus the writing of such covenants became a futile exercise. The Civil Rights Act of 1968, better known as the Fair Housing Act, formally forbade by federal statute not only such covenants on the basis of race, but also religion and other classifications.

Peter Feilberg

Peter Fredrik Feilberg (7 April 1800 – 5 August 1863) was a Norwegian newspaper editor and politician.
He was born in Tønsberg. His family had immigrated from Flensburg, Southern Schleswig in 1787. Peter Feilberg was a dyer by education, and operated a printing press. He also ran a book shop, and, later, a rental library.
In 1830 Feilberg started the first newspaper in Skien, "Skiens Ugeblad". He was notably convicted of libel in 1837 and sentenced to pay 60 speciedaler; the complaint had been filed by County Governor Frederik Wilhelm Wedel Jarlsberg. Curiously, Feilberg's defender Pavels Hielm was convicted of inappropriate prodecure, having recited a poem during the final speech of the defence, and sentenced to pay 10 speciedaler. "Skiens Ugeblad" was liquidated in 1839, but in January 1840 he started another newspaper "Bratsberg Amtstidende". In 1843 the name was changed to "Bratsberg Amtstidende og Correspondent", and Herman Bagger was brought in as co-editor. In 1844, however, Bagger left to form his own newspaper "Bratsberg Amts Correspondent", later changed to "Correspondenten". At the same time, Feilberg's newspaper reverted its name to "Bratsberg Amtstidende". "Bratsberg Amtstidende" and "Correspondenten" would from now on become fierce rivals. "Correspondenten" was pressed by Jens Melgaard, a rival of Feilberg.
In 1837, when local government was introduced in Norway, Feilberg was elected to the first city council of Skien. He then served as mayor of Skien from 1838 to 1840. This was partially possible due to that County Governor Wedel Jarlsberg, who had sued him for libel earlier, had stepped down the same year. His rival Herman Bagger became both mayor and parliament member; Feilberg instead allied with another parliament member Frederik Charlow Sophus Borchsenius.
One of his sons, Karl (born 1828), became a school principal.

Peter Härtling

Peter Härtling (born 13 November 1933) is a German writer and poet. He is a member of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany and he received the "Großes Verdienstkreuz" for his major contribution to German literature.
Biography.
Härtling was born at Chemnitz and spent the early part of his childhood living in Hartmannsdorf, Mittweida, where his father maintained a law firm. Following the outbreak of World War II, the family moved to the German-occupied town of Olomouc in Moravia. Like many of the town's German residents, Härtling's family fled before the Red Army's advance on the city during the final months of the war; the family briefly settled in Zwettl, Austria. Härtling's father was captured by the Russians and died in June 1945 at the prisoner-of-war camp in Dollersheim. Following the conclusion of World War II, Härtling finally settled in Nürtingen, Baden-Württemberg. His mother committed suicide in October 1946. He studied under HAP Grieshaber at the Bernsteinschule art school before starting work as a journalist.
Härtling had his first collection of poetry published in 1953. From 1967 to 1973, Härtling was the managing director of the German publishing house S. Fischer Verlag, located in Frankfurt. Härtling became a full-time writer after leaving S. Fischer Verlag. In the winter semester of 1983/84 he hosted the annual Frankfurter Poetik-Vorlesungen, a lecture series in which a prominent writer discourses on topics pertaining to their work. Härtling used his lectureship to demonstrate the process of using a found object as the inspiration for a literary work. During the series of lectures he wrote "Der spanische Soldat", a short story based on a photograph by Robert Capa.
Härtling has worked as the editor of the magazine "Der Monat" and as the president of the Hölderlin society. He currently lives in Mörfelden-Walldorf.
Literary themes.
Härtling has devoted a large proportion of his literary output - both in poetry and in prose - to the reclamation of history and his own past. His autobiographical novel "Zwettl" (1973) deals with the period he spent living in Lower Austria after his family fled from the Red Army. "Nachgetragene Liebe" (1980) recounts Härtling's earliest memories of his deceased father.
Another major influence on Härtling's works has been the literature and music of Romanticism. Amongst other works, Härtling has written fictionalised biographical works on the writers Friedrich Hölderlin, Wilhelm Waiblinger and E. T. A. Hoffmann, and the composers Franz Schubert and Robert Schumann.
Children's literature.
In 1969, after writing a eulogy for the Czech children's writer Jan Procházka, Härtling began writing books for children. His first children's book, "Und das ist die ganze Familie", was published the following year. His children's literature has often focused on social problems involving children. In "Das war der Hirbel" (1973) he wrote about the home of a maladjusted child, "Oma" (1975) talks about aging and death, whilst "Theo haut ab" (1977) deals with being uprooted from home and family.
Radio.
Härtling has been the moderator of the "Literatur im Kreuzverhör" show on hr2, the cultural radio station of Hessischer Rundfunk.

Maria Anna Katharina Rutowska

Maria Anna Katharina Rutowska (1706–1746) was a Polish noblewoman.
She was the illegitimate daughter of Polish king Augustus II the Strong and his mistress, the Turk "Fatima or Fatime", later renamed Maria Anna of Spiegel.
Life.
Katharina was the second child of the liaison between Augustus II and Fatima; her older brother, Frederick Augustus, was born four years before.
Shortly after the birth of Frederick Augustus, the King married Maria Anna with his chamberman Johann Georg of Spiegel, but she remained as his mistress. Katharina was born during this marriage and legally used the name "Maria Anna Katharina of Spiegel" during her first years of life.
In 1715 her stepfather Johann Georg of Spiegel died; her mother Fatima survived him by only five years.
Augustus II took the guardianship of his children, but only recognized and legitimized both in 1724 and were granted the title of "Count and Countess Rutowska".
The now Countess Rutowska was married off by her father on October 1, 1724. with the Polish nobleman Count Michał Bieliński. The marriage was an immediate failure and after eight unhappy years, in early 1732, they divorced.
In February 1732 she re- married, this time, a Sabaudian aristocrat in Saxon service, count Claude Marie de Bellegarde et d'Entremont (1700-1755). From this marriage she has two one one Mauritz de Bellegarde (1743-1792), general-liutenant in service of Saxe,
Contrary to what is written in several works, she didn't die in 1746. From 1746 to 1752, in fact, she was with her husband in Turin, where count of Bellegarde was embassador of Saxony.

Pierre Doré

Pierre Doré (Auratus) (b. at Orléans about 1500; d. at Paris, 19 May 1559) was a French Dominican theologian and controversialist.
Life.
He entered the Dominican Order in 1514 and won his degrees at Paris, in 1532. Though elected to the office of prior at Blois in 1545, Doré continued to preach throughout the provinces.
At Châlons the bishop, impressed by his eloquence, entrusted him with the reform of the Carthusian monastery of Val des Choux (Vallis Caulium). For the same reason, Claude de Lorraine, Duke of Guise, and his consort, Antoinette de Bourbon, chose him as confessor.
Works.
He wrote thirty-five ascetico-theological works, which may be redactions of sermons. Chief among these is "Les voies du Paradis enseignees par notre Sauveur Jesus-Christ en son evangile", which appeared twice at Lyon in 1538 (Paris, 1540; Lyon, 1586; Rome, 1610).
In his "Paradoxa ad profligandas haereses ex divi Pauli epistolis selecta", he wrote against the Huguenots, but soon turned to writing ascetical commentaries on the Psalms. When Henry II of France entered Paris in 1548, Doré wrote a Latin ode which won for him the post of court preacher and royal confessor.
His defence of the Eucharist appeared in 1549, and two years later he published two other apologies on the same subject and another on the Mass. At the same time he prepared his defence of the Faith in three volumes, as also another attack on the Calvinists. He closed his literary career with two works on Justification.
Though Doré used the French vernacular very loosely, and indulged in far-fetched descriptions, which Rabelais (Pantagruel, ch. xxii) ridicules, his works were both original and orthodox. They include literal translations of the Eucharistic hymns of Thomas Aquinas, his Latin poems, and the Office for a Feast of St. Joseph, which he composed at the command of Pope Paul III.

Mendoza HM-3

The HM-3 is a submachine gun of Mexican origin chambered in the 9mm calibre and, since 2011, in .380 ACP caliber for private security forces, from a magazine fed from the grip, much like the Uzi.
This sub-machine gun is manufactured by Productos Mendoza, S.A. in Mexico. It is a lightweight weapon of reduced overall length achieved by largely extending the wrap around bolt forward around the barrel. A grip safety is provided to prevent accidental discharge. The stock is designed in a manner that makes folding and unfolding easy and provides a foregrip when the stock is folded. The selector lever is on the right-hand side of the weapon so that it can be operated by the right hand without releasing the weapon with either hand. The stock can be folded or unfolded while gripping the weapon with both hands unlike the previous models of the same gun. It is much like the UZI in the way that the magazine is located on the grip.
9mm Caliber Models.
There are currently three variations on the HM-3 using a 9mm caliber round. The HM-3-S LONG is a 15.74 in (23.85 in with extended stock) long model, used primarily for the Mexican Police and other State and Municipal security forces. The HM-3-S SHORT is almost identical, with the exception that the barrel is shortened and therefore measures only 12.99 in (21.06 in with extended stock). The HM-3-S BULLDOG (also called HM-3-S Mini) is a miniature version of the weapon, especially designed to be carried by motorcycle police and bodyguards, and measures only 10.8 in (19.3 in with extended stock) in longitude and weighs 2,827 g (6.2 lbs) with a full 32 round magazine. All versions may use 20 or 32 round magazines.
.380 Caliber Models.
Since 2011, Productos Mendoza has manufactured a variation of the HM-3-S that shots a .380 ACP caliber round. This is the largest caliber available to use by private security companies and individuals in Mexico, and the most popular caliber for personal defence in Latin America. The HM-3-S LONG model is called "COBRA .380" and the HM-3-S BULLDOG is called "BULLDOG .380". These names were created to facilitate the models' introduction to the consumer market. All specs are the same (excluding caliber) than the HM-3-S 9mm models, with the exception that .380 models can carry a 35 round magazine.

Colonel Effingham's Raid

"Colonel Effingham's Raid (UK title: Man of the Hour) is a 1946 comedy film made by 20th Century Fox, directed by Irving Pichel. It is also known as Berry Fleming's Colonel Effingham's Raid, Everything's Peaches Down in Georgia and Rebel Yell". The screenplay was written by Kathryn Scola, based on a 1943 novel by Berry Fleming. The music score is by Cyril J. Mockridge. The film stars Charles Coburn, Joan Bennett, William Eythe, Allyn Joslyn and Elizabeth Patterson. The plot involves a retired career Army colonel who returns to his hometown, starts writing a column in a local newspaper and takes on the corrupt local politicians to not replace the historic county courthouse.
Fleming based his novel on the Cracker Party and political corruption in Richmond County, Georgia.
Plot.
William Seaborn Effingham (Charles Coburn) returns to his home town Fredericksville, Georgia, in 1940 as a retired Army Colonel. He soon finds something to fill his days with, by starting a fight for the survival of the local newspaper. After many years of absence, he meets his cousin, Albert Marbury (William Eythe), who is a reporter at the newspaper, and hears that a rival newspaper is threatening the existence of the one Albert works for. The competing paper is getting more advertisers because of its support of the sitting mayor, Bill Silk (Thurston Hall). 
Among other things, the mayor favors renaming the town Confederate Monument Square after a highly questionable deceased politician named Pud Toolen. William isn’t happy at all with this development, and decides to support the editor, Earl Hoats (Allyn Joslyn), in the fight for survival. Effingham has opinions about the content of the paper, and convinces the editor to let him write a military column. The column becomes a success among the readers, and opens up the doors to society in the small town. Effingham eventually writes against renaming the town square in his column, and the editor wants to shut him down. 
Effingham goes to the mayor with a suggestion to transform the square, rather than renaming it. The mayor agrees, but only to cover up a larger scheme of his to compleely change the look of the town square, by tearing down the old beautiful courthouse. When Effingham learns about the plan, he is infuriated, and start fighting for the courthouse’s restoration. 
The mayor calls for a town meeting, hoping that no one will show up and protest against his plans of transformation of the town square. But Effingham spills the news about the meeting in his column, thereby filling the meeting with town folk opposed to the transformation idea. The mayor still manages to elude the crowd by telling them the town will only get federal money if the courthouse is torn down. 
Effingham decides to check the correctness of this information, and finds out that the mayor has lied to the people. He talks to the most influential people in town to reverse the decision taken by the mayor, but they refuse to help him. Cousin Albert realizes that William is right about saving the buildings instead of tearing them down, starts a fundraiser in support of the restoration. He succeeds in convincing the mayor to keep the square as it is, and Effingham gets apologies from his old friends as the realize he was right all along.

Skiensposten

Skiensposten was a Norwegian newspaper, published in Skien.
"Skiensposten" was started in 1842 by Herman Bagger, a Danish immigrant who had worked as a jurist, teacher, farmer and politician. Before the end of the year, however, he grew tired and resigned as chief editor. "Skiensposten" survived for the time being, but faced competition from "Bratsberg Amtstidende", a newspaper founded in 1840 by Peter Feilberg. The new owners of "Skiensposten" tried to halve the price, and changed its name to "Skiens Adressetidende". However, this was not enough to keep it in circulation, and it went defunct near the end of 1843.
It was pressed by Jens Melgaard, a printing press rival of Peter Feilberg.

Profile Rock

Profile Rock, also known as the Old Man of Joshua's Mountain, is a 50-foot high granite rock formation located in Freetown, Massachusetts just outside Assonet village and near the Freetown State Forest.
Native Americans believe it to be the image of the Wampanoag Chief, Massasoit. The Wampanoags occupied the region of present-day Rhode Island and Massachusetts bounded by Narragansett Bay to the west and the Atlantic Ocean to the east. Chief Massasoit was friendly to the early Pilgrim settlers, but his son, Philip, is the namesake of King Philip's War (1675) between the Wampanoags (sometimes referred to as the Pokanoket) and the English, which resulted in the tribe’s ruin.
Joshua’s Mountain was named after Joshua Tisdale who was the first to settle near the site. The mountain was privately owned for several years by former Freetown Selectman, Ben Evans, who sold the mountain to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to be used as a state park tourist attraction. Massachusetts has done little to promote the attraction, however, and the site has been vandalized with graffiti.

Biston strataria

The Oak Beauty ("Biston strataria") is a moth of the family Geometridae. It is native to Europe, but is primarily found in the United Kingdom. "B strataria" is found in a variety of habitats, but is mostly found in woodlands where it rests on the bark of trees, camouflaged by its mottled black and grey wings. The male has feather-like antennae while those of the female are more thread-like. The moth has a wingspan of 40 to 56 mm.
The larvae are mainly brown with three lumps near the end of the abdomen. They have evolved to resemble sticks which helps protect them from predators. The larvae feed on many species of trees, but the most commonly used host plants are oaks.
Morphology.
The Oak Beauty has white forewings with two irregular broad brown bands along each wing. The first band is short, located near the base of the wing, and surrounded with a black border. The second band is located near the outer margin with a black border surrounding the inner edge. Between these two bands is a white space sprinkled with black dots as well as a crescent-shaped black mark near the middle. The overall appearance gives the Oak Beauty a mottled look. "B. strataria"‘s forewings are 17-27 mm in diameter while its wingspan ranges from 40-56 mm. The Oak Beauty’s hind wings are paler than its fore wings and have transverse black bands. The forehead and the front of the thorax are white while its sides are a white-grey blend. Its body is covered with many hairs. The back of the thorax and the body are a darker shade of brown.
The Oak Beauty exhibits melanism and comes in two different variations; a dark (melanic) form and light (typica) form. The melanic form is prevalent in Holland, but this form has not been observed in Britain. Details explaining this discrepancy are not yet known. The closest relative to "B. strataria" is the Peppered moth ("Biston betularia"), which also has two forms. The proportion of melanics is higher in "B. betularia" compared to "B. strataria". This is unusual since, between the two species, it is "B. strataria" that should have a greater evolutionary selection for the prevalence of melanic individuals due to the higher pollution concentrations in the area.
Sex differentiation.
Adult males possess feathered antennae and are frequently observed during the daytime. Such feathered antennae are thought to aid in sensing female pheromones from over a kilometer away. This helps males locate females for mating.
Females are observed less often during the day than their male counterparts, and their antennae are thinner and more threadlike than the males’.
Distribution and habitat.
Although the Oak Beauty’s distribution stretches from central and southern Europe to Asia Minor, the moth is primarily confined to England and Wales and is occasionally spotted in Scotland and Ireland. Within the UK, the Oak Beauty has been found in western counties including Crom and Garvary. A few discoveries have been made in Argory and Peatlands in the late 1990s. They have also been rediscovered at Rostrevor Before this time the moth had not been seen since the early part of the twentieth century and sightings still remain relatively rare.
In July and August, the larvae can be found feeding on various host plants. "B. strataria" is prevalent in wooded areas including parks, gardens, and other suburban habitats. It is usually found on the trunk of trees rather than within the canopies where it can blend with its surroundings
Behavior.
Adults emerge in early spring. "B. strataria" begins its flight period from mid-March to April, which is an early flight period compared to other moth species. "B. strataria" usually flies at night and is readily attracted to light. Its mottled appearance aids in its concealment from predators when it rests on tree trunks during the day Although the adult camouflages well with its surroundings, predators may occasionally spot the moth. In these circumstances the moth has one last defense mechanism – its hindwings, which were previously hidden in the resting position, carries shocking markings which may warn off predators when suddenly exposed.
Larvae.
The Oak Beauty caterpillar is brown, marbled with white, and has two small red lumps on the back of its eighth, ninth and twelfth segments and a small lump on the belly on the seventh, eighth and ninth segments. The caterpillar’s head is slightly notched in the middle, possibly due to evolutionary pressures to resemble twigs in appearance.
The larvae are found from spring to fall feed on a variety of deciduous trees including oak ("Quercus spp."), elm ("Ulmus spp."), Hazel ("Corylus avellana"), Aspen ("Populus tremula") and Alder ("Alnus glutinosa").
Evolution.
Larvae.
An experiment was carried out to discover whether caterpillars of "B. strataria", "Ennomos alniaria", and "Lycia hirtaria" were protected from Eurasian Jays and Common Chaffinches by their resemblance to the sticks they resided upon. In this experiment, the larvae and twigs were scattered across an area while seven "Garrulus glandarius" were positioned to prey on the larvae. When the larvae were not confused as twigs, it took "G. glandarius" ten seconds to find their prey. When more twigs were present than caterpillars, it took the birds between one and forty minutes to find the larvae. After finding the first caterpillar, "G. glandarius" quickly increased its rate of attack on both the larvae and the twigs. This experiment concluded that these caterpillars' adaptation to their environment does not give them the best possible protection.
Tinbergen added on to de Ruiter’s experiments and found that when caterpillars were more abundant than twigs, birds continued to hunt; when caterpillars seemed rare in comparison to twigs, birds stopped hunting all together. Brower concludes that a bird’s continuous quest for caterpillars after discovering larvae puts surrounding larvae in danger, despite how well these caterpillars blend in with their environment. Brower has speculated that bird behavior is density-dependent as well as dependent upon finding surrounding larvae of the similar phenotypic properties to the one it just consumed. Although past theories have speculated that either Batesian mimicry or crypsis were at play to explain these circumstances, further studies by Skelhorn have proven neither are correct. Rather, this phenomenon is quite different from the former two and is now commonly recognized as masquerade.
Adult.
"B. strataria" demonstrates coincident coloration. A cryptic disruptive pattern on the wings breaks up the outline, while the coloration blends well with the tree bark on which the Oak Beauty rests.

Michel Duguet (born 1961) is a French Scrabble player who won the French World Scrabble Championships five times during the 1980s. His record of five world titles has never been broken, but has been equalled by Christian Pierre during the 1990s. Despite both players being five-time world champions, it was Duguet that was awarded the prize of 'player of the century' () at the World Championship in Paris in 2000.
Duguet only played ten seasons of French Scrabble, also winning the French national championship six times, the World Championship by pairs five times and the French championship by pairs twice. Away from Scrabble, he was the "Des chiffres et des lettres" champion in 1984, a game show based on anagrams and numbers games known as "Countdown" in the UK. After retiring from Scrabble in 1988, he took up bridge and ending up representing the French national team at the European Bridge championships in 2002, as well as winning the "French cup" ("Coupe de France") of bridge in 2004 with his wife Marlène. Duguet has occasionally come out of retirement to play Scrabble, finishing 7th at Vichy in 2006, a tournament which welcomes more than 1200 players each year.
Duguet is also an author and has written six books with Michel Charlemagne, another World Scrabble Champion who turned to card games after being World Scrabble Champion.

Otterburn (Bedford, Virginia)

Otterburn is a Palladian-influenced Greek Revival house near Bedford in Bedford County, Virginia. The house was built in 1828 for Benjamin A. and Sally Camm McDonald, but burned in 1841 and was reconstructed by 1843. At this time the final form of the house was created with the introduction of a loggia, cross-gable roof and Greek Revival detailing. The house was the seat of a estate by 1825, with a mill, sawmill, and dependent structures.
After McDonald's death in 1871 the property passed through several owners until 1950, when the house became the Hines Memorial Pythian Home, an orphanage operated by the Knights of Pythias. A detached dormitory was added at this time. The orphanage ceased operations in the early 1960s, but operated for two years in the late 1960s as the Otterburn Academy, a private school. In later years the property was operated as a rest home for the elderly. The house is presently being restored.

In psychology, privation occurs when a child has no opportunity to form a relationship with a parent figure, or when such relationship is distorted, due to their treatment. It is different to deprivation, which occurs when an established relationship is severed. It is understood that privation can produce social, emotional and intellectual problems for children; however, how inevitable such problems become as a result of privation, and the extent to which the can be reversed, remains an issue of debate among psychologists.
Privation in philosophy.
In philosophy, privation may refer to the absence of a necessary quality in the universe. 
For example, as part of his theodicy, Augustine denied the existence of evil as its own entity; rather, he described evil as a privation, or going wrong, of good, "privatio boni".
Jewish philosopher Maimonides argued that privation is not necessarily a bad thing: it would be trivial to regard the privation of hair - baldness - an evil.

Lewis Cass expedition

The Lewis Cass expedition of 1820 was a survey of the western part of Michigan Territory led by Lewis Cass, governor of the territory. On January 14, 1820, United States Secretary of War John C. Calhoun authorized Cass to lead a party of scientists, soldiers, Canadian voyageurs, and Native Americans into the wilderness of western Michigan Territory. The purpose of the expedition was to:
Members.
The expedition consisted of 42 men as follows:
From Detroit to the Mississippi.
The expedition departed Detroit in four large canoes on May 24, 1820. It took three days to reach Fort Gratiot, located near the entrance to Lake Huron. The commander of the fort, Major Cummings, exchanged five of his sixty soldiers for two from the expedition who had become ill. On June 6 the expedition reached Michilimackinac where they awaited the arrival of additional supplies. On June 13 the party departed Michilimackinac bound for Sault Ste. Marie escorted by a twelve-oared barge carrying a military detachment intended to overawe the native Americans. 
At Sault Ste. Marie, Cass called a council of the Ojibwa to obtain their permission to establish an Indian agency. The Ojibwa, many of whom were loyal to the British, expressed their displeasure with the American proposal. One of their chiefs known as "the count", dressed in the uniform of a British officer, raised a British flag near the expedition's camp. Cass tore down the flag and trampled it under foot, which brought about the submission of the native Americans, who ceded on the St. Mary's River where Fort Brady was constructed two years later. 
The expedition proceeded west along the southern shore of Lake Superior portaging across the Keweenaw Peninsula. A contingent including Cass, Schoolcraft, and Doty made a side trip up the Ontonagon River to see the huge mass of copper known as the copper rock. At the western end of Lake Superior the expedition proceeded up the Saint Louis River to the American Fur Company's post at Fond du Lac. 
Six miles further up the river Cass split his party. Schoolcraft, Doty, and 14 others struck out across country for the American Fur Company's post at Sandy Lake near the Mississippi River, while Cass and the rest of the party continued up the Saint Louis River heading for the same destination. The overland party lost the trail and struggled through swamps and knee-deep mud, yet arrived at Sandy Lake two days ahead of Cass's group. Cass and the scientific staff ascended the Mississippi in search of its source. They went as far as the lake that now bears Cass's name and then returned to the post at Sandy Lake.
Return to Detroit.
Taking 16 Ojibwa with them, the expedition descended the Mississippi, pausing to hunt buffalo along the banks. Near the Falls of Saint Anthony they encountered an encampment of the Fifth Infantry under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Henry Leavenworth. Here the resident Indian agent, Major Lawrence Taliaferro called together the local Sioux for a ceremony of peace with the Ojibwa accompanying the Cass expedition. 
The expedition continued down the Mississippi stopping at Sioux villages to smoke the pipe of peace. On August 5 the party reached Fort Crawford at Prairie du Chien, the westernmost post in Michigan Territory. Schoolcraft made a brief side trip to the lead mines near Dubuque, after which the entire expedition ascended the Wisconsin River to the Fox-Wisconsin partage and descended the Fox River to Green Bay, where they were greeted by a salute from the guns of Fort Howard. At Green Bay Cass dismissed the soldiers and shipped the natural history specimens collected by the scientists to Detroit. He led most of the remaining men down the western shore of Lake Michigan to Chicago. 
Dr. Wolcott and a few companions remained at the Indian agency at Chicago. Governor Cass returned to Detroit on horseback via the Indian trail, while Schoolcraft and Captain Douglass traveled up the eastern shore of Lake Michigan to Michilimackinac where they joined Doty and a couple other members of the expedition who had traveled there directly from Green Bay. This group retraced the expedition's route down Lake Huron to Detroit, arriving there on September 24, 1820, 124 days after their departure.
Results.
The Louis Cass expedition, which cost $6,300, resulted in a series of anonymous articles in the Detroit "Gazette" in the winter of 1820-21, a 419 page book by Henry Schoolcraft, and at least 15 scientific papers. Schoolcraft's book, "Narrative Journal of Travels...from Detroit...to the Sources of the Mississippi River", sold 1,200 copies within a few months of its publication in 1821.

Théophile Raynaud (15 November 1583 – 31 October 1663) was a French Jesuit theologian and writer. 
Raynaud was born at Sospel near Nice. He entered the Society of Jesus on 21 November 1602, then taught grammar and humanities at Avignon, and philosophy and theology at Lyon and for a time at Rome. He died at Lyon.
Works.
In 92 separate works, covering almost the entire field of Catholic, he showed himself an erudite theologian and a writer of great fertility. His style, however, is often prolix and sometimes obscure, whilst in his controversial writings he indulges in satire and invective. 
His collected works, revised by himself shortly before his death, were published under the direction of his confrère, John Bertet, in nineteen volumes (Lyons, 1665). A twentieth volume, entitled "Th. Raynaudi Apopompaeus" (i.e. the scapegoat), containing a number of writings which the author had purposely excluded from the collection, was published by an anonymous editor a few years later (Cracow, 1669); this volume was condemned by the Congregation of the Index.

There are currently 118 IALC accredited schools in 21 countries worldwide: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Ecuador, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Malta, New Zealand, Portugal, Russia, South Africa, Spain, United Kingdom, USA. The 9 languages taught by IALC schools are: Chinese (Mandarin), English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish.
Since their creation in 1983, IALC have been cementing their reputation as an essential business forum for independently-operated language teaching institutions.
The IALC Accreditation.
All IALC language schools are inspected prior to joining the association, then they are inspected as part of the Quality Audit every four year, and continuously monitored. Not only does it insist that all member schools are inspected by relevant national accreditation schemes, it also runs its own inspections as part of a thorough quality assurance process. The IALC Code of Ethics is one of the standards that member language schools have to comply with. The IALC Quality Scheme ensures all standards are met and exceeded.
IALC Workshop.
The Annual IALC Workshop gathers decision makers from the language travel industry: IALC member schools, and educations agents. It is hosted each year by one of IALC's members and is sponsored by IALC schools and by exhibitors working with the language travel industry. It follows IALC's Annual General Meeting and features seminars, two days of one to one business appointments, and three major evening events: the Welcome Reception, the School Party and the Gala Dinner.
The IALC Workshop is known in the language travel industry as an "essential business forum for independently-operated language teaching institutions".
The IALC Workshop is one of the prerequisites for agencies who wish to become official IALC Partner Agents.
IALC Partner agencies.
IALC Partner agencies are established, professional, language and study travel agencies that actively represent and are in good standing with at least 5 IALC schools. They must attend at least one IALC Workshop every four years and comply with the IALC Code of Ethics.

Vandeikya

Vandeikya is a local government area in Nigeria.
Vandeikya Local Government Council is located between latitude 7°5' and 7°15' north of the Equator and Longitude 9° and 9°6' east of Greenwich. It has a landmass of 183,939 square metres (0.7 sq miles) with a population of well over 80,288.
Vandeikya is in the South Eastern part of Benue State and shares boundaries with Obudu and Bekwara in Cross River State to the East, Ushongo to the North and Konshisha LGA to the West. There are twelve administrative council wards.
Vandeikya LGA was carved out of Gboko LGC in 1976. The indigenous community is the Tiv people who speak the Tiv language. The Vandeikya people are a hospitable group and are predominantly Christians with a few traditionalists.
Vandeikya Local Government area is dominated by undulating terrain with much of the area being below 183 m (600 ft) above the sea level. Surface drainage is generally good with almost all the rivers being seasonal, notably river Aya and river Be.
The climate is tropical sub humid with the mean annual rainfall of between 1,200 and 2,000 mm (47" and 79") averaging seven months in the year, while the mean annual temperature is 32.5 °C (90 °F). The wet season is from April to October or November while the dry season is November to March.
Agriculture is the mainstay of the people; with arable land for sheep, goats and cattle rearing. Over 80% of the population are directly engaged in the peasant farming of virtually all major food crops, with concentration on rice, sweet potatoes, cassava, sorghum, citrus, spices, pepper, groundnut and bambara nuts. The LGA is endowed with mineral deposits such as barites, kaoline and iron ores.
Being principally farmers, the major commercial engagements of the people in the area revolve around agricultural products. Presently, there are no major industries in the area; however there are many small scale cottage industries like rice milling, block making and furniture works and others. The settlement pattern is dispersed with thatched round houses.

Cooper's sign

Cooper's sign is a test for meniscal damage in the knee. It involves the patient complaining of joint line pain in the affected knee when turning over in bed at night changing position of their legs. It is thought that the meniscal tear causes pain as the torn fragment is torqued between the femur and tibia, and as it pulls on the joint capsule, pain is felt. This test can differentiate knee pain from arthritic pain which is more common with weightbearing.
If the Cooper's Test is positive, an MRI may be indicated for a definitive diagnosis. A diagnostic ultrasound is an office based test that is less expensive and also useful in diagnosing meniscal tears.
Related tests.
The McMurray's Test is an older test also used to determine meniscal tearing. It involves the rotation of the tibia on the femur in an attempt to cause a "click" to be felt as the meniscal fragment is caught. Described in the late 19th century, it is non-specific as many conditions cause a "click" in the knee.
The Thessaly Test is a test for meniscal damage where the patient stands with their weight on the affected leg, and then flexes his knee to 30 degrees and twists to the right and left. Reproduction of the pain is considered positive for meniscal tearing.

<doc id="18525612" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18525612" title="Silicor Materials">
Silicor Materials

Silicor Materials Inc. is a privately held manufacturer of solar silicon and aluminum by-products. Silicor is headquartered in San Jose, California, and its silicon purification operations are performed by its wholly owned subsidiary, Silicor Materials Canada Inc., in Ontario, Canada. Silicor also has a research and development facility in Berlin, Germany. To date, more than 25 million solar cells have been made with Silicor's solar silicon.
Technology.
Silicor Materials uses its own unique silicon purification process, which it obtained with the acquisition of 6N Silicon, Inc. Silicor Materials also claims to have trade secrets and patents on processes related to silicon purification, crystallization, wafering, and cell processing that enable it to produce cells with efficiencies above 16 percent while using what Silicor Materials claims is lower-cost silicon than used for the more conventional Siemens purification method. Silicor Materials purifies silicon, casts the silicon into ingots, cuts the ingots into bricks using diamond saws, cuts the bricks into wafers using wire saws, and converts the wafers into solar cells through a series of steps to form the photovoltaic junction. Solar cells produced with Silicor Materials' solar silicon are shipped globally to manufacturers who assemble the cells into conventional aluminum-framed, glass-encapsulated solar modules (also known as solar panels) for use in installations for grid-tied electricity.
Technological Benefits.
In contrast to the Siemens Process, which requires a total of four phase changes—solid to liquid, liquid to gas, gas to liquid, liquid to solid—Silicor's silicon only goes through two phase changes: solid to liquid and liquid to solid. This change reduces the manufacturing energy requirements to an estimated total usage of 10 to 25 kWh/kg.
Silicor's method does not require the use or handling of hazardous chemicals such as silane or trichlorosilane gas, which are required in both the Siemens and Fluid Bed silicon purification processes. This contributes to improved worker safety, the avoidance of disposal costs, faster facility permitting and reduced facility construction footprint. Additionally, Silicor's resulting solar silicon has a narrow resistivity range which is achieved through adjusting the relative mix of boron and phosphorus. This property is shown to improve ingot yields.
History.
Founded in 2006, Silicor Materials began commercial solar cell shipments and acquired 6N Silicon, Inc. in 2010. During that same year, the company opened a new cell manufacturing facility in Sunnyvale, California, completed its first >1MW installation, and obtained IEC and UL certification for industry-standard solar modules manufactured using Silicor Materials cells.
Effective February 1, 2012, the company has been renamed "Silicor Materials".

Nungali language

Nungali is an Australian language which is believed to be extinct. It was spoken in the Northern Territory of Australia, around the upper Daly River. Its closest relative is the Jaminjung language.
It is the only Yirram language which has retained the original four-class system in nominals. The four classes are masculine, feminine, neuter and plants, and each of the classes have separate prefixes expressing the absolutive case, locative or ergative case, and the dative case.
The locative case is also productive when it comes to placenames. An example is "Nyimarlanpurruni" referring to the Timber Creek area, which consists of the neuter locative prefix "nyi-", the word for ""river gum"", the plural marker "-purru", and an additional marker of the neuter locative, "-ni".

CinemaScore

CinemaScore is a market research firm based in Las Vegas. It surveys film audiences to rate their viewing experiences with letter grades, reports the results, and forecasts box office receipts based on the data.
Background.
Ed Mintz founded CinemaScore in 1979 after "The Cheap Detective" disappointed him. According to his son, the elder Mintz wished he could have heard beforehand what "real people, not critics" thought of the film. The company conducts surveys to audiences who have seen a film in theaters, asking them to rate the film and specifying what drew them to the film. Its results are published in "Entertainment Weekly". CinemaScore also conducts surveys to determine audience interest in renting films on video, breaking the demographic down by age and sex and passing along information to video companies like Fox Video Corporation.
CinemaScore pollster Dede Gilmore reported the trend in 1993, "Most movies get easily a B-plus. I think people come wanting the entertainment. They have high expectations. They're more lenient with their grades. But as (moviegoers) do it more and more, they get to be stronger critics." In 1993, films that were graded with an A included "Scent of a Woman", "A Few Good Men", and "Falling Down". Films graded with a B included "Sommersby" and "Untamed Heart". A C-grade film for the year was "Body of Evidence".
A website was launched by CinemaScore in 1999, after three years' delay in which the president sought sponsorship from magazines and video companies. Brad Peppard was president of CinemaScore Online from 1999 to 2002. The website included a database of nearly 2,000 feature films and the audiences' reactions to them. Prior to the launch, CinemaScore results had been published in "Las Vegas Review-Journal" and "Reno Gazette-Journal". CinemaScore's expansion to the Internet included a weekly email subscription for cinephiles to keep up with reports of audience reactions.
In 1999, CinemaScore was rating approximately 140 films a year, including 98-99% of major studio releases. For each film, employees polled 400-500 moviegoers in three of CinemaScore's 15 sites, which included the cities Las Vegas, Los Angeles, San Diego, Denver, Milwaukee, St. Louis, Dallas, Atlanta, Tampa, Phoenix, and Coral Springs.
In the summer of 2002, CinemaScore reported that the season had the biggest collective grade since 1995. In the summer of 2000, 25 out of 32 films received either an A or B grade. 26 of the summer of 2001's 30 films got similar grades, while 32 of the summer of 2002's 34 films got similar grades, the latter being the highest ratio in a decade.
Rating.
CinemaScore representatives are present in 25 large cities across North America. Each Friday, representatives in several of the cities give opening-day audiences a small survey card. The card asks for age, gender, a grade for the film between A+ and F, whether they would rent or buy the film on DVD or Blu-ray, and why they chose the film. CinemaScore typically receives about 400 cards per film. The ratings are divided by gender and age groups (under 21, 21-34, 35 and up); film studios and other subscribers receive the data at about 11 pm Pacific Time. Although the detailed data is proprietary the letter grades quickly spread widely throughout the media and the industry, as studio executives brag about successes and mock competitors' failures. Subsequent advertisements for highly ranked films often cite their CinemaScore grades.
An A+ grade from CinemaScore for a film typically predicts a successful box office. From 1982 to August 2011 only 52 films (about two a year) received the top grade, including seven winners of the Academy Award for Best Picture. A+ films include "Titanic", "Tangled", "The King's Speech", "A Few Good Men", "Driving Miss Daisy", and "Toy Story 2". As opening-night audiences are presumably more enthusiastic about a film than ordinary patrons, a C grade from them is –according to the "Los Angeles Times"– "bad news, the equivalent of a failing grade". According to Mintz, "Movies don't rate lower than a C. A C is a failure. And it's so rare that a movie is an F. I mean, if it's an F, it shouldn't even be released." Eight films have earned the F grade, including Steven Soderbergh's 2002 remake of "Solaris" with George Clooney, Brad Pitt's "Killing Them Softly" (2012), and six horror thrillers: William Friedkin's "Bug" (2006) with Ashley Judd, "Wolf Creek" (2005), "Darkness" (2002), "The Box" (2009) with Cameron Diaz, "The Devil Inside" (2012), and "Silent House" (2012).
CinemaScore's forecasts for box-office receipts based on the surveys are, according to the "Times", "surprisingly accurate" as "most of company's picks . . . are in the ballpark", in 2009 correctly predicting the success of "The Hangover" and the failure of "Land of the Lost".

Pocket Venus

Pocket Venus are a Welsh rock band from Conwy in North Wales. The band's sound has been difficult to pigeonhole as they have such a diverse range of sounds, however, many critics have compared the group to classic rock bands such as Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin for the progressive rock dynamics and comparisons of the precise orchestration and song writing techniques of bands like The Verve and Spiritualized were also abundant in reviews. The band formed in 1998 and toured the UK extensively, hailed as one of the best unsigned bands of their time they achieved critical acclaim both in the UK and abroad. Pocket Venus split in 2003 during negotiations with major record labels, the band cited musical and personal differences as the reason for the breakup. In late 2010 Pocket Venus reformed.
History.
Formation (1998 - 2003).
Pocket Venus, from North Wales formed in 1998, an amalgamation of various members of earlier bands, the original line up was Chris Yates, Naldo Algieri, Steve Jones, Chris Bainbridge and Mark Roberts. The line up changed in 1999 when guitarist Chris Bainbridge left transferring rhythm guitar duties to Chris Yates. Keyboardist Dave Robinson joined shortly after but the lineup changed again in 2000 when drummer Mark Roberts left the band to be replaced by Pete Ryan. The band were managed by Neil Crud, who released two singles for them on his Secrets of Sound record label. First release; "Make It Through Your Day" was highly acclaimed and received airplay on BBC Radio One from John Peel and Mark Radcliffe, and also airings on BBC Radio Wales from Adam Walton, who invited the band on his show for a session. The band produced a video for their second release Tell Me Why, which is still available on YouTube and the NME's official website. gigs and an energetic stage performance led to more airplay from radio stations both across the UK and internationally, notably winning "Best International Artist" at the Orange County Music Awards. The lineup changed again in late 2002 with the departure of Steve Jones on lead guitar. Jones's place was taken by Dyfed Roberts formerly of Gwacamoli. The band continued to play live shows until August 2003 when the band split up. The band had become disillusioned and disheartened by the music industry, so in order to save their friendships and personal relationships they went their separate ways.
Post-breakup activities (2003 - 2010).
After the band split Yates and Roberts went on to form Gotti, with Steve Flavell on drums and bass player Mauve. Gotti played locally and also recorded a number of demo tapes. Ryan, Algieri and Robinson stayed away from the music scene for various reasons and concentrated on their family lives and other responsibilities. The band attempted to reform in 2008 but never got past the rehearsal stage.
Reunion (2010 - present).
In December 2010, Yates, Algieri and Robinson were joined by Chris Ryan on lead guitar and John "Hargi" Hargest on drums for a low key gig in North Wales announcing the band's return. Hargi was replaced on drums by Simon Barton early on, since then the band have played a number of gigs and have recently released a new E.P, "Back to Make it Better", tracks include "Back To Make It Better", "Godspeed" and "Life Of Misery". The E.P has received national airplay and has helped the band reach a wider audience.
The band are also supporting various charities including rereleasing their E.P "Tell Me Why" for Help For Heroes, and also playing gigs to support the Oxjam Music Festival. The band have suggested, via their Facebook page, that they intend to begin recording their debut, full length album in 2013.
Live.
Pocket Venus claim they never managed to capture the true essence of the band in their recordings and urged people to see them live instead of relying on the EP's and singles they produced. They played at many of the more infamous London venues including the Garage in Highbury, The Water Rats in St Pancras and The Bull And Gate in Kentish Town. The band played several festivals during their career playing Pigstock in North Wales and also played alongside Reef at the prestigious Wakestock festival. Pocket Venus have also played Manchester's world renowned "In The City" showcase festival.
The band played at Club 147 in Llandudno with Talk To Angels and Danny McNamara of Embrace on Friday 2 September 2011. More recently the band performed an acoustic set with Chris Helme of The Seahorses and supported Ultrasound at the launch of their new album at the Borderline Club, in Soho. The band are set to play at Club 147 in Llandudno again December 2012 supporting Ultrasound once again.

Zaranie Śląskie

Zaranie Śląskie was a Polish quarterly literary magazine devoted to the culture and history of Silesia. It was founded in 1907 by Dr Ernest Farnik and published in Cieszyn.
It focused on the region of Cieszyn Silesia, however since the 1930s gradually left this area of interest and focused more on Upper Silesia. "Zaranie Śląskie" published historical and folkloristic articles, literary works, folk songs etc. Many well-known regional writers and activists contributed to the magazine, e.g. Ludwik Brożek, Emanuel Grim, Andrzej Hławiczka, Paweł Kubisz, Jan Łysek, Antoni Macoszek, Julian Przyboś, Oskar Zawisza and others.
The publishing of the magazine was resumed after World War II. It was published in Katowice in 1945-1948 and later from 1957. At this stage of its history it hadn't too much common with the region of Cieszyn Silesia. "Zaranie Śląskie" ceased to exist in 1992.

Qualifications and Credit Framework

The Qualifications and Credit Framework (QCF) is the national credit transfer system for education qualification in England, Northern Ireland and Wales. The QCF replaces the National Qualifications Framework (NQF) which closed for accreditations at the end of 2010. Students who started qualifications under the NQF will complete them, any student starting a qualification from September 2011 will complete it under the QCF. Scotland has its own system - the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework.
Every unit and qualification in the new framework has a credit value (where one credit represents 10 hours of learning time). There are three different sizes of qualification:
In addition, each qualification has a level of difficulty from Entry level at the bottom to Level 8 at the top.
The title of each qualification within this framework contains details of the size (award/certificate/diploma), level of difficulty (Entry to Level 8) and general content of the qualification.
The QCF is a national framework referenced to the European Qualifications Framework (EQF). The EQF is a meta framework intended as a reference so that qualifications in nation frameworks such as the QCF are understood across member states.
The QCF does not include previous qualifications that are now defunct, such as the GCE Ordinary Level which was replaced by GCSEs in 1988. Officially, defunct qualifications are not part of the QCF and therefore have no level, but are still as valued as their replacement equivalent.

6167th Air Base Group

The 6167th Air Base Group (6167th ABG) is an inactive United States Air Force unit. Its last duty assignment was at K-16 (Seoul Airport), South Korea during the Korean War.
History.
Formed from the 6167th Air Base Unit in October 1950 to operate flare aircraft, psychological operations, and behind-the-lines agent insertions and resupply drops during the war. Its designation served as a cover for its actual special operations activities.
Its 6167th Operations Squadron was augmented by aircrews from the Clark AB, Philippines-based 581st Air Resupply and Communications Wing (581st ARCW), a cover designation for a special operations unit. Aircraft operated were the B-26 Invader, C-46 Commando, and C-47s.
Two SA-16 Albatrosses were sent to K-16 (Seoul Airport) in South Korea by the 581st ARCW to augment B Flight of the 6167th Air Base Group. In addition, four Sikorsky H-19A helicopters were also forward deployed to K-16 in support of the 2157th Air Rescue Squadron (in fact, they were colocated with the 2157th but actually supported B Flight, as did the two SA-16s). 
Combined Command Reconnaissance Activities, Korea (CCRAK) maintained Operational Control of these forces and employed them into North Korea along with B Flight and Special Air Missions detachment aircraft.
The 6167th Operations Squadron operated C-47s and B-26s, equipped for both leaflet drops and psychological warfare voice missions. In 1952-1953, almost all flying operations were nighttime missions and included occasional drops of very young teenaged Korean nationals whose parents were well paid to allow their children to parachute into North Korea. Their assignments were to visually obtain strategic intelligence on production facilities, transportation, troop placement, and other specifics. They were to walk back to the battle lines and, using passwords, pass through to deliver the intelligence gathered to the proper US military authorities.

Biography.
According to Marcus, his parents got divorced shortly after his birth. They sent him to live with his grandmother in the countryside, where he took part in the popular children's dance group "Edelweißchen". At eighteen he went to the US and lived in New York and Miami, and while there experienced international and electronic music. It was here that he formed the idea to combine this music style with aspects of German folk music and Schlager. He has been living in Berlin since 2005. On 6 June 2008 he released his debut album "Electrolore" with Kontor Records, which included guest contributions by Manny Marc and Frauenarzt.
Style.
Alexander Marcus' music is a mixture of modern electronic club music and folk music, which he has named 'Electrolore', a Portmanteau of 'electro' and 'folklore'. He overexaggerates many of the clichés present in German Schlager music, often complementing them with "trashy" objects in his music videos, such as a recurrent plastic globe he nicknamed "Globi". "Spiegel Online" sees him as a typical example of a return to pop-art social criticism. Never breaking out of character, Rennefeld leaves the question of whether the character is a parody unanswered: 2008 Alexander Marcus was on tour as support act for And One.

HSC Manannan

HSC "Manannan" is a wave-piercing high-speed catamaran car ferry built in Tasmania in 1998. After commercial service in Australia and New Zealand, she was chartered to the US Military as USS "Joint Venture" (HSV-X1). Now owned and operated by the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company, she mainly provides a seasonal service between Douglas and Liverpool.
Early history.
"Manannan" is one of six 96-metre (WPC 96) catamarans built by Incat of Tasmania, Australia. She was built as "Incat 050" in 1998. Under the name "Devil Cat", she operated for a short period as a commercial ferry for TT-Line. A spell followed crossing the Cook Strait as "Top Cat". Then she was acquired by the US Navy and converted for military purposes.
United States Navy.
In 2001, she was commissioned as USS "Joint Venture" (HSV-X1), serving for five years with the United States Armed Forces. A flight deck was added to accommodate various helicopters in the US Navy arsenal. "Joint Venture" was rapidly re-configurable and could perform a variety of missions, principal among them the ability to ferry up to 325 combat personnel and 400 tons of cargo up to one way at speeds in excess of .
In 2003, "Joint Venture" was assigned to Operation Enduring Freedom in the Horn of Africa. She operated as a fast transport in support of the Combined Joint Task Force and performing a variety of tasks, such as transporting and supplying troops at high speed over long distances, operating as a mobile command centre, working close inshore, and operating as a helicopter carrier.
At the end of the five year charter, she was handed back to Incat in early 2006. She underwent a refit and was painted in the livery of Express Ferries. Plans for her to enter service as a car and passenger ferry never materialised.
Isle of Man Steam Packet Company.
On 19 May 2008, the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company announced the purchase of the wave-piercing catamaran for £20 million, as the replacement for the fast craft "Viking". Because of its previous use, the company said it had significantly fewer hours of service than a vessel of comparable age and was ideally suited for the planned service. She completed the mile voyage from Hobart to Portsmouth, with most of the materials for her refit, in 27 days.
A £3 million refit, carried out by Burgess Marine in Portsmouth, provided a new aft accommodation module and the "Sky Lounge". The heavy military ramp was replaced with a new stern door and the helideck was removed. Following this, she arrived in Douglas on 11 May 2009. An open day took place at each of the Company's ports and at a renaming ceremony, she was renamed after Manannán mac Lir, the Celtic god of the Irish sea. "Manannan" made her maiden service voyage with the Steam Packet Company on Friday 22 May 2009 on the 07:30 sailing from Douglas to Liverpool.
Service.
At , "Manannan" is the largest vessel of its kind on the Irish Sea. In summer season, she operates daily sailings from Douglas to Liverpool, and weekly/twice weekly sailings to Belfast and Dublin. In the winter she is laid up in Liverpool and goes on reserve until the summer season.

Contax I

The Contax I, or Original Contax, is a 35 mm rangefinder camera made between 1932 and 1936 by Contax. The Contax I had six identifiable variants, but fundamentally identical; every aspect was designed to outperform the Leica. For instance, the removable back was for faster loading and reloading, the bayonet lens mount was designed for rapid lens interchangeability, the long-base rangefinder was for more accurate focusing with large aperture lenses, and the vertical metal shutter not only gave a faster maximum speed but also banished the problem of shutter blinds burning.
History.
In 1932, Zeiss Ikon of Dresden decided to produce a competitor to the Leica II, designed to be superior in every way. The name Contax was chosen after a poll among its employees. Dr. Ing. Heinz Kuppenbender was its chief designer.
Made between 1932 and 1936, the original Contax (later known as Contax I after later models were introduced) was markedly different from the corresponding Leica II. Using a die-cast alloy body it housed a vertically travelling metal focal-plane shutter reminiscent of the one used in Contessa-Nettel cameras, made out of interlocking black-finished brass slats. somewhat like a roll-up garage door 
The interlocking slats were aligned by specially made silk ribbons, which were very strong but subject to wear. The coupled rangefinder had a very long baseline, with its own eyepiece next to that of the viewfinder. 
Other main differences included focusing drive built into the camera body for use with standard lens, removable back, shutter speed knob integral with film wind knob placed at the front of the camera body, and finished in black.
The young lens designer Ludwig Bertele, formerly of Ernemann, was charged with the responsibility of designing the lenses.

Run, Melos!

The story is a reworking of Friedrich Schiller's ballad "Die Bürgschaft", which tells the story of Moerus and Selinuntius (who have lent their names to Dazai's characters as well), originally Damon and Pythias. Schiller's version is based on an ancient Greek legend recorded by the Roman author Gaius Julius Hyginus. 
The most prominent theme of "Run, Melos!" is unwavering friendship. Despite facing hardships, the protagonist Melos does his best to save his friend's life, and in the end his efforts are rewarded.
Story.
Melos is a naïve young shepherd with a sense of equity. The land in which he lives is ruled by Dionys, a tyrant king who because of his distrust of people, has killed many people and even his own family members. When Melos hears about the King's deeds one day, he becomes enraged. He decides to assassinate the King, and so he sneaks into the castle with a knife, but is caught and arrested. Melos pleads with the King to postpone his execution and give him three days so that he can attend his younger sister's wedding. The King agrees, but on one condition: that Melos' friend Selinuntius is left as a hostage, and if Melos does not return in three days, he will be executed instead of Melos.
After the wedding is over Melos hurries back to the city. Along the way he encounters many tribulations, such as a broken bridge due to the overflowing of the river and attacks by bandits. All of these things exhaust him, and he nearly gives up, but then continues to run for the sake of his friend's life.
At sundown Melos finally arrives at the city, just in time to save his friend Selinuntius. He apologizes to Selinuntius for his treachery, and Selinuntius apologizes for ever doubting him. The King is moved by the display and decides to let Melos go with impunity.

USS Washington (1776 row galley)

USS "Washington" was a large row galley, with a rowing crew of 60, that was placed into service under the control of the Continental Congress in 1776. During this age of sail, row galleys were highly maneuverable compared to sailing ships whose movements were dependent on the wind. "Washington"s war record consisted of an attack on several British warships, and, after finding itself on the losing side of the battle, the row galley rowed away, out of danger. There is no further report of her efforts for the Continental Navy.
Authorized by Rhode Island.
In the autumn of 1775, the Rhode Island General Assembly ordered the construction of two row galleys, "Washington" and "Spitfire", and in January 1776 appointed John Grimes commodore of galleys. During the winter and spring of 1776, these galleys operated in Narragansett Bay, protecting the colony's shipping, carrying troops, and covering foraging parties seeking supplies.
The General Assembly voted and resolved that; 
Seeking battle with the British.
In July, the galleys were sent to New York City to join the tiny flotilla George Washington was fitting out on the Hudson River and apparently came under Continental control. 
On the afternoon of 3 August, "Washington" served as "flagship" for Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin Tupper as that officer led an attack on the Royal Navy's warships "Phoenix" and "Rose". As the galleys approached, "Phoenix" opened fire on the American boats to begin an action at grapeshot range which lasted some two hours before the Americans retired to Dobb's Ferry. During the engagement, four Americans were killed, and 14 others were wounded. On the British side, "Phoenix" was hulled twice and suffered substantial damage.
Fate.
There is no record of "Washington" and her sister galleys after the British captured Manhattan Island late in the summer.

Ashley Slater

Ashley Slater is a UK-based trombone player and best known for his work with Norman Cook (aka Fatboy Slim) in the band Freak Power. He was born in Schefferville, Canada in 1961 At the age of about 6 months, Ashley and his parents moved to Hanford, California.
In 1977, he moved to Edinburgh, Scotland on his own, and there joined the regimental band of the 1st battalion the Royal Scots as a bass trombonist. He also got his first taste of minor stardom whilst standing in for the lead singer of Northern Irish R&B band Otis and the Elevators.
In 1983 after leaving the army, he attended the National Centre for Orchestral Studies, after which he joined the anarchic big band collective Loose Tubes. Over the next few years he was the bass and tenor trombonist of choice for the likes of George Russell, Carla Bley, Andrew Poppy, El Sonido de Londres, Billy Jenkins, Django Bates and Andy Sheppard. During this time he also worked as a session musician recording and arranging for The The, Fairground Attraction, Julia Fordham and the Rolling Stones.
After a gig at Ronnie Scott's jazz club in London with Loose Tubes, Slater was approached by Rob Partridge, the then head of the Antilles Label on Island Records. At this time Ashley and a fellow loose tuber, John Eacott had also been singing and writing songs for their funk band project called Microgroove. Their USP was an electric tuba played by Oren Marshall. They released one album called "The Human Groove" in 1988.
In 1993, shortly after Norman Cook, a.k.a. Fatboy Slim, had remixed one of Microgroove's tunes, ("Walkin'") they teamed up to form Freakpower and went on to have a top three hit single in the UK with "Turn On, Tune In, Cop Out". Freakpower released two albums, "Drive Thru Booty" and "More of Everything for Everybody", also on Island records. As Cook's Fatboy career took off, Slater also went his own way and released music through Skint under the alias Dr. Bone. He also contributed vocals to and topline EDP's Sweet Music.
He has also recorded with Dimitri from Paris and Rui da Silva and has contributed vocals to Fatboy Slim's albums, and Krafty Kuts. After a break of about five years from playing the trombone Slater was lured back by Gary Crosby from the Jazz Jamaica All Stars. Since then he has toured with Sam Rivers, Hermeto Pascoal, Roy Nathanson's Jazz Passengers, Hugh Masekela, Dub Pistols and his own band BigLounge. He also recently appeared with Elvis Costello and Debbie Harry at the London Jazz Festival.
In 2011 Ashley formed an Electro-Swing act called Kitten & The Hip, feat Kitten Quinn on lead vocals. The debut single "Dont You Worry" has been signed to Hed Kandi, and is out soon.

Livoniana is a genus of prehistoric lobe-finned fish which lived during the Devonian period (Givetian - Frasnian stages, about 374 - 391 million years ago).
This species is a transitional form between fish and the earliest tetrapods, like Tiktaalik, Ichthyostega and Acanthostega. Before Livoniana there was Elginerpeton and Obruchevichthys.
Four legs developed in water, not on land, to better escape waterliving predatory creatures like Hyneria. There were very lush forests, and particularly swamps, where four limbs became very useful to avoid predators.

315th Air Division

The 315th Air Division (315th AD) is an inactive United States Air Force unit. Its last assignment was with Pacific Air Forces, based at Tachikawa Air Base, Japan. It was inactivated in April 1969.
History.
World War II.
The 315th Bombardment Wing was activated in July 1944 at Peterson Field, Colorado as a command and control organization for four very heavy B-29 Superfortress bombardment groups. Organization trained in Colorado while subordinate groups were trained in Kansas by Second Air Force.
When training was completed moved to Guam in the Mariana Islands of the Central Pacific Area in late March 1945 The 315th was the fifth and last B-29 Wing assigned to XXI Bomber Command. The Groups and Squadrons of the 315th Bomb Wing for the most part, flew the B-29B aircraft. The limited-production B-29B was designed to was to save weight by removing all of the guns and sighting equipment used on other B-29s, except the tail gun. The weight savings allowed the B-29B to fly a little higher and a little further. The B-29B aircraft also had two new radar units installed. One was the AN/APQ-7 Eagle Radar for bombing and navigation and the other was the AN/APG-15 used for aiming the tail gun. These two radar units gave the B-29B a distinctive shape as the APQ-7 antenna appeared as a small wing under the fuselage, between the two bomb bay doors and the APG-15 added a ball shaped antenna to the tail of the aircraft below the tail guns. 
In the Marianas, the Wing provided command and control to the 16th, 331st, 501st 502d Bombardment Groups. The 16th and the 501st were the first to arrive in Mid April; the 331st and 502d arrived in mid-May 1945.
Its groups flew "shakedown" missions against Japanese targets on Moen Island, Truk, and other points in the Carolines and Marianas. The 16th and 501st began combat missions over Japan on 26 June with attacks on the Utsube Oil Refinery in Yokkaichi. The 315th and 502d did not engage in combat until 1 August with attacks on the Mitsubishi Havana Oil Refinery in Kawasaki. For all four groups, oil industry targets in Japan were its primary targets.
The wing flew its last combat missions on 14 August when hostilities ended. Afterwards, the wing's B 29s carried relief supplies to Allied prisoner of war camps in Japan and Manchuria. Due to their late arrival in the theater, the groups demobilized slowly, not returning to the United States until April/May 1946. 
The Wing then moved to Ashiya Army Airbase, Japan at the end of May 1946 to become part of the Fifth Air Force Occupation forces. It was re-designated as the 315th Composite Wing in January 1946 and controlled a mixture of fighter and bomber units performing occupation duty and providing air defense over Japan during the occupation era (1945–1950).
Korean War.
With the outbreak of the Korean War, the division was relieved of occupation duty in January 1951 and reassigned to Far East Air Forces. It was re-designated as the 315th Air Division (Combat Cargo) on 10 January 1951, and took over the resources of the Far East Air Forces Combat Cargo Command (Provisional), which was set up in June 1950 in the immediate aftermath of the North Korean invasion of the south.
It assumed command and control of the following units:
During the Korean War, its components evacuated wounded from Korea, airdropped supplies and personnel, hauled emergency supplies, materiel, replacement troops, mail, rations and ammunition, participated in joint training exercises in Japan, took part in numerous combat missions, and operated regular transport schedules within the Far East area.
Cold War.
Before combat operations ceased in Korea, the division began supporting French forces engaged in a war in Indochina. From May 1953 – July 1954, it provided C-119s to the French, trained French air crews and maintenance personnel, performed additional airlift missions in support of the French, and finally evacuated wounded French troops from Indochina during operation Wounded Warrior.
In July 1954, the 315th resumed normal airlift operations in the Western Pacific Area and participated in training exercises in Japan. It continued peacetime readiness operations throughout the 1950s and early 1960s from its base at Ashiya. In 1962, it established airlift support for the expanding conflict in Southeast Asia. Meantime, the division continued its routine airlift in the Far East, flew humanitarian missions, and participated in training exercises when possible.
The crisis prompted by the North Korean seizure of the USS Pueblo in January 1968, found the 315th supporting an emergency airlift to the Republic of Korea.
The 315th AD was inactivated in April 1969 due to budget reductions. Its operational units (314th, 374th and 463d TAW) were reassigned.

Monocrystalline silicon

Monocrystalline silicon or single-crystal Si, or mono-Si is the base material of the electronic industry. It consists of silicon in which the crystal lattice of the entire solid is continuous, unbroken (with no grain boundaries) to its edges. It can be prepared "intrinsic", i.e. made of exceedingly pure silicon alone, or "doped", containing very small quantities of other elements added to change in a controlled manner its semiconducting properties. Most silicon monocrystals are grown by the Czochralski process, in the shape of cylinders up to 2 m long and 45 cm in diameter (figure on the right), which, cut in thin slices, give the wafers onto which the microcircuits will be fabricated. 
Single-crystal silicon is perhaps the most important technological material of the last decades (the "silicon era"), because its availability at an affordable cost has been essential for the development of the electronic devices on which the present day electronic and informatic revolution is based.
"Monocrystalline" is opposed to "amorphous" silicon, in which the atomic order is limited to short range order only. In between the two extremes there is "polycrystalline silicon", which is made up of small crystals, known as "crystallites".
Mono-Si in electronics.
The monocrystalline form is used in the semiconductor device fabrication since grain boundaries would bring discontinuities and favor imperfections in the microstructure of silicon, such as impurities and crystallographic defects, which can have significant effects on the local electronic properties of the material. On the scale that devices operate on, these imperfections would have a significant impact on the functionality and reliability of the devices. Without the crystalline perfection, it would be virtually impossible to build Very Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) devices (figure at right), in which millions (up to billions, circa 2005) of transistor-based circuits, all of which must reliably be working, are combined into a single chip to get e.g. a microprocessor. Therefore, the electronics industry has invested heavily in facilities to produce large single crystals of silicon.
Mono-Si in solar cells.
Monocrystalline silicon is also used in the manufacturing of high performance solar cells. Since, however, solar cells are less demanding than microelectronics for as concerns structural imperfections, monocrystaline solar grade (Sog-Si) is often used, single crystal is also often replaced by the cheaper polycrystalline or "multicrystalline" silicon. Monocrystalline solar cells can achieve 21% efficiency whereas other types of less expensive cells including thin film and polycrystalline are only capable of achieving around 10% efficiency.
Few solar charger companies use monocrystalline solar panels because of the higher cost to produce the solar cells, although these higher efficiency products are starting to pop up as consumers demand more efficient products.

Lakenheath-Bentwaters incident

The Lakenheath-Bentwaters Incident was a series of radar and visual contacts with Unidentified Flying Objects that took place over airbases in eastern England on the night of 13–14 August 1956, involving both RAF and USAF personnel. The incident has since gained some prominence in the literature of ufology and the popular media.
The final Report of the Condon Committee, which otherwise concluded that UFOs were simple misidentifications of natural phenomena or aircraft, took an unusual position on the case: "In conclusion, although conventional or natural explanations certainly cannot be ruled out, the probability of such seems low in this case and the probability that at least one genuine UFO was involved appears to be fairly high". It has, however, also been argued that the incidents can be explained by false radar returns and misidentification of astronomical phenomena.
The incident.
The commonly cited sequence of events is that recorded in the original Project Blue Book file by the US Air Force, subsequently analysed by the Condon Committee's report and by atmospheric physicist Dr James E. McDonald.
The incident began at the USAF-tenanted RAF Bentwaters, Suffolk, on the evening of 13 August 1956. This was a dry, largely clear night with, observers noted, an unusually large number of shooting stars, associated with the Perseid meteor shower. Radar operators at the base tracked a target, appearing similar to a normal aircraft return, approaching the base from the sea at an apparent speed of several thousand miles per hour. They also tracked a group of targets moving slowly to the north-east which merged into a single very large return (several times the strength of that from a B-36) before moving off the scope to the north, as well as a further rapid target proceeding east-west.
A T-33 trainer from the 512th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, crewed by 1st Lieutenants Charles Metz and Andrew Rowe, was directed to investigate the radar contacts, but saw nothing. No visual sightings of the objects were made from Bentwaters in this period with the exception of a single amber star-like object which was subsequently identified as probably being Mars, then low in the south-east.
At 22:55, a target was detected approaching Bentwaters from the east at a speed estimated around 2000–4000 mph. It faded from the scope as it passed over the base (possibly suggesting anomalous propagation as a source for the target), reappearing to the west. However, as it passed overhead a rapidly moving white light was observed from the ground, while the pilot of a C-47 at 4000 feet over Bentwaters reported that a similar light had passed beneath his aircraft. At this point, Bentwaters alerted the US-tenanted RAF Lakenheath base, 40 miles to the north-west, to look out for the targets. Ground personnel at Lakenheath made visual sightings of several luminous objects, including two which arrived, made a sharp change in course, and appeared to merge before moving off. The angular size of these objects was compared to that of a golf ball at arms length, and they were stated to dwindle to pinpoint size as they moved away, an observation which seemed to rule out a bolide or bright meteor.
The final phase of the incident was described in some detail by T/Sgt Forrest Perkins, who was the Watch Supervisor in the Lakenheath Radar Air Traffic Control centre, and who wrote directly to the Condon Committee in 1968. Perkins claimed that two RAF De Havilland Venom interceptors were scrambled and directed towards a radar target near Lakenheath. The pilot of the first Venom achieved contact, but then found that the target manoeuvred behind him and chased the aircraft for a period of around 10 minutes despite the latter’s taking violent evasive action; Perkins characterised the pilot as "getting worried, excited and also pretty scared". The second Venom was forced to return to its home station due to engine problems; Perkins stated that the target remained on their screens for a short period before leaving on a northerly heading.
Investigation by the Condon Committee.
The Condon Committee included the case in its analysis largely in response to Perkins' letter. Aside from the Blue Book file, it was able to obtain a previous classified teleprinter message, transmitted three days after the incident, from 3910th Air Base Group to Air Defence Command at Ent AFB; the teleprinter message's description of the events, including the 'chase' episode, largely agreed with that of Perkins.
Based on the information available, the Committee's researcher (Thayer) felt that while anomalous propagation was possible, the lack of other targets on radar scopes at the time made it unlikely. Focusing on the later phase of the incident at Lakenheath, he came to the remarkable conclusion that "this is the most puzzling and unusual case in the radar-visual files. The apparently rational, intelligent behavior of the UFO suggests a mechanical device of unknown origin as the most probable explanation of this sighting".
A detailed investigation by noted aviation journalist and researcher Philip J. Klass concluded, however, that the incident could be explained as a combination of false radar returns and misperceptions of meteors from the Perseid stream.
The account of Freddie Wimbledon and a further civilian witness.
No more information emerged on the case until the late 1970s, when an article in the "Daily Express", and a subsequent piece by astronomer Ian Ridpath in the "Sunday Times", produced further witnesses. Flight Lieutenant Freddie Wimbledon wrote to the "Sunday Times" on 19 March 1978 contesting Ridpath's statement that the incident had effectively been explained by Klass.
Wimbledon had been the radar controller on duty at RAF Neatishead at the time of the sightings. While his account of events agreed with that of Perkins in some details, including the description of the aircraft being apparently chased by the object, he stated that it had in fact been his team who directed the two Venoms to the interception and that the US personnel at Lakenheath would have been merely 'listening in'. Wimbledon disagreed with Klass' analysis, remembering the incident as involving a solid radar return tracked from three sets on the ground and one in the intercepting aircraft.
The same 1978 press interest in the case also elicited a letter from a John Killock to the "Daily Express" in which he claimed to have seen, in August 1956, both a single, rapidly traveling white light at Ely, along with a Venom, and subsequently an odd group of amber lights.
Recent research.
Four British Fortean researchers, Dr David Clarke, Andy Roberts, Martin Shough, and Jenny Randles, have since conducted a study that has indicated that the incident, or incidents, were very much more complex than the Condon Report had suggested.
Most significantly, the aircrews originally involved in the incident, F/Os David Chambers and John Brady from the first aircraft and F/Os Ian Fraser-Ker and Ivan Logan from the second, were located and interviewed. The aircrews involved all flew with 23 Squadron from RAF Waterbeach and were scrambled at 02:00 and 02:40 on 14 August – around two hours later than Wimbledon and Perkins claimed the interceptions occurred.
In contrast to the reports given in the original classified teleprinter message and in the accounts of both Wimbledon and Perkins, the aircrews both stated that the radar contacts obtained were unimpressive and that no 'tail-chase', or action on the part of the target, occurred. They also asserted no visual contacts were made. The first pilot, Chambers, commented that "my feeling is that there was nothing there, it was some sort of mistake", while Ivan Logan, the second Venom's navigator, stated that "all we saw was a blip which rather indicated a stationary target". At the time 23 Squadron decided that the radar contact had, if anything, been with a weather balloon.
To add to the contradictory nature of the accounts collected, another Venom crew was traced who had been scrambled much earlier in the evening. F/Os Leslie Arthur and Grahame Scofield were not told of the nature of their target and were forced to return to base after the aircraft's wingtip fuel tanks malfunctioned; Scofield recalled listening in to the radio communications of the intercepting pilots while back at Waterbeach later in the evening. Scofield's account of the overheard radio transmissions agreed, puzzlingly, with those of Wimbledon and Perkins, though he felt able to identify the crews as Chambers / Brady and Fraser-Ker / Logan. The time and path of Scofield's flight was identified as one which could also convincingly explain the sighting of a Venom at Ely by the civilian, Killock, who had claimed to see anomalous lights.
The new research additionally revealed that 23 Squadron's CO, Wing Commander (later Air Commodore) A. N. Davis, had also been diverted to investigate the radar returns while flying a Venom from RAF Coltishall. As the interception would have occurred at the same time as that described by Wimbledon and Perkins, it has been suggested that Davis and another pilot were the two described in their accounts.

Something Happened on the Way to Heaven

"Something Happened on the Way to Heaven" is a single performed by Phil Collins and released in 1990, from the album "...But Seriously". The song reached the #4 spot on the "Billboard" Hot 100 charts that same year. A live performance of the song also appears on the "Serious Hits... Live!" album. The song was written by Phil Collins and Daryl Stuermer and was produced by Phil Collins and Hugh Padgham. It was also included on "...Hits" on which it is the track number eight. The cover art shown here is a still from the 1946 film "A Matter of Life and Death" by Powell and Pressburger. The single's UK release featured a different cover, depicting comedian Tony Hancock. The song was originally written for the movie "War of the Roses".
Lyrics.
The only time the title of the song is used is the second line of the third verse. The song is often identified by the predominant hook of "How many times can I say 'I'm sorry'?".
Music Video.
The Video featured a Dog wandering around the set of the Video, while Collins performed the song with his band.
Deborah Cox version.
In 2003, Canadian singer Deborah Cox recorded a R&B cover of the track, which was included on the Phil Collins tribute compilation "Urban Renewal". A club/house remix was issued as a single, which reached number one on the U.S. "Billboard" Hot Dance Airplay chart in November 2003 and stayed at the top spot until February 2004. The track spent 11 weeks at number one, ten of them consecutively, making it the first single on the chart to accomplish this feat, which she would hold until 2009, when Lady Gaga broke that record with her single "Poker Face", which spent 15 weeks at the top.

Team 5P

Team 5P () is the animation production team, which established in 2002. The first members were composed of Hongsuk KIM(Kee-mong), Sangsik MIN(Sickman), Donghyuk JANG(Seedrock), Sukjo JANG(Devil), Jihyuk JUNG(Guy Hyuk), and Junghoon JI (Back-gun).
They used to draw many kinds of Animations; especially the series of "The Hell of Selfish and Immoral Entertainers(Hangul name; 연예인지옥)", "The Middle-aged Detective Kim Jung Il", "The Banana Girl (unsuitable for under 19-years-old)" are very famous masterpieces.
Private "Kim Chang-who"'s Desertion.
The Story is separated of two stories. One is the story which describes the time "Kim Chang-who" joined a party; He couldn't stand on much reproaches from his superiors - He deserted remaining his diary and ran away stealing a duck from a farm, the other is the story which describes the time after "Kim" deserted his party; but he was captured by his captain "Kim Hong-suk" just before he take a traffic to his home, he was imprisoned with his superiors into the guardhouse.
The Hell of Entertainers.
The flash animation series is the most popular animation of the team. Many kinds of military service problems were dealt in this animation.
Series of "Moonoejoong".
In 2002, Team 5P made the first series of "The Hell of Entertainers" which Heejun Moon (in this series, he is featured as ""Moonoejoong"; literally, A No-brained Bug") who is due to join the 666 party is featuring. In this first series, "Moonoejoong" is scolded by many superiors, including a foolish and fault maker, "Kim Chang-who". One day night, He dreamt of what he sings rock'n roll, when he sings shouting, making most of his fans wild with enthusiasm. At that time, his superior, "Jung Ji-hyuk" wakes him up, and scolded while he was still sleeping. This day, "Moonoejoong" couldn't have any supper because he waste his breakfast into the trash box after "Kim Chang-who" told him about a patty on a Military Hamburger, while he miss twice in a football game; one is his own goal, the other is speaking what "Jung Ji-hyuk" missed a penalty kick. He couldn't have any supper until his sleeping time.
Series of "Stivoong Yoo".
Another entertainer, Steve Yoo (Korean name; Seungjun YOO) featured as ""Stivoong YOO"(No literal meaning but similar to his name)." Steve is a naturalized American to avoid the military duty in South Korea on February, 2002. At first of the series, he told his party supervisor that he was due to join the American Army. However, the supervisor scold and strike him even Stivoong cried that he is about to join the American Army. Likewise "Moonoejoong", he is scolded by his superiors. From joined day on, he is defeated seriously. After a while, "Jung Ji-hyuk" told "Kim Chang-who", "boil my noodle pack." "Kim Chang-who" spit into the pack boiling noodle, "Moonoejoong" found his situation and reported to "Jung Ji-hyuk". Thus, in the evening, "Kim" was beat seriously by "Jung" for the reason.
The next day, in the morning roll call, everybody sing the South Korean national anthem "Aekukga", "Stivoong" murmured without any sound. The supervisor found his state and called him. The supervisor let him sing the anthem, but he couldn't sing. Then everybody kicked him. When everybody prepared a run, but "Stivoong" reports his waist-ache. So everybody punched and kicked him. 
Some days later, imprisoned superior "Choi Hyun-il" returns this party, but Stivoong misunderstood him as a new joined private. But "Kim Chang-who" shouted "Choi" is his superior, then "Choi" beats "Stivoong". In fact, by reason of what Steve is a Christian, virtual character Stivoong wanted to go to church, but refused by his superior. Instead, he went to military temple. He was scolded for praying during the Buddhist ceremony. Moreover, he was kicked by "Choi Hyun-il" because he didn't receive but catch a ball in the kick-ball game while "Moonoejoong" was punched by two superiors because of ball double-touch. Stivoong is beat again by "Jung Ji-hyuk" because of entering into the bathtub ignoring the priority. In the evening roll call, "Stivoong" was punished again by the captain of his party because he didn't pick up a disassembled segment sweeping inside of his K-2 rifle. The next day, he punished seriously because he fired by accident during post-safety checking.
At that time, the party lost an empty cartridge. but it was occurred to obtain as an accessory by "Moonoejoong". "Moonoejoong" hid this cartridge onto the book. He opened a book and pick up a cartridge. However he dropped a cartridge while "Jung Ji-hyuk" was coming in and pick up. Despite "Moonoejoong" shouted that he had found the lost cartridge and he would return, he was punched and kicked by "Jung Ji-hyuk" and "Choi Hyun-il". Some days later, "Kim Chang-who" failed to promote for failure of shooting test.

<doc id="18526090" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18526090" title="Diasec">
Diasec

Diasec is a patented process used for facemounting prints like photographs on acrylic glass. The process was invented by Heinz Sovilla-Brulhart in 1969.
Because of the different light penetration and refraction of acrylic glass compared to normal glass, the colours are more brilliant and the image sharper than compared to standard glass in a picture frame. A Diasec mount is usually of a high gloss finish. Because the print is glued to the acrylic glass, the result is a completely flat mount of the image.
The print is also resistant to ultraviolet (UV) light because of the properties of acrylic glass. There are other processes to achieve similar results, these are in the photographic or art world sometimes also called Diasec prints. Diasec is however a registered trademark.
Process.
The whole process is dedicated to mounting the print without air bubbles or smears. The image is face mounted and bonded to the acrylic glass with a silicone sealant. The silicone sealant, which has a consistency of a gel, acts as a glue between the print and the acrylic glass. 
Normally the print is placed on a carrier at the backside. This is usually dibond, a composite plate of aluminium and plastic. Aluminium or other materials are also possible. If the print has to be backlit, translucent materials are necessary.
Uses.
The Diasec prints are used by some photographers to present their work. Andreas Gursky mounted "99 Cent II Diptychon", the most expensive photograph ever, on acrylic glass, probably with the Diasec process. 
The Diasec process is sometimes used for billboards.
The term Diasec is protected by copyright and the service is only available through authorised suppliers. 
Diasec was the first system that allowed photographs to be bonded directly and permanently to Acrylic sheet.
Diasec panels are backed with Aluminium, reinforcing the rigidity of the finished picture and sealing the artwork from both sides.
The Aluminium back also enables the attachment of sub-frames that allow the artwork to hang on the wall without a traditional picture frame. 
The component ingredients and the process of Diasec are patented and used under Licence. 
Diasec uses a primer and liquid gel, not sheet film adhesive. The biggest advantage of this is that air bubbles and creases in the final product are minimized. You are not limited to adhesive film sheet size and there are fewer complications with large format images.
The Diasec gel is neutral curing and has an inbuilt Ultra violet filter. It contains no plasticizers and is resistant to fungicidal, bacterial agents, and airborne pollutants. After curing the whole airtight panel remains chemically inert and stable. The finished product remains flexible, enabling it to withstand changes in temperature and humidity, which affect works on paper. However, the process is irreversible and if the acrylic glass is damaged there is no way to salvage the print. 
Diasec samples that were made in the 1970s show negligible colour shift, the whites are still pure and there is no evidence of acid erosion visible.
Diasec Patent.
The exclusive use of the diasec patent has expired and the process can now be freely used without royalties. However, the name "Diasec" is a protected trademark held by the Swiss company Alrane Inventing AG. The Dutch company "Diasec Support BV", has started in 2009 to support the Swiss licensor by offering training and machines. Most if not all processes that face-mount photographic images to acrylic plates cannot use the same process as defined in the diasec patent. Only companies licensed by Alrane Inventing AG are legally allowed to call their process "diasec". Moreover special fluids needed for the Diasec process are only available from Alrane Inventing AG to Diasec license holders.
There are several companies that have an expertise in creating diasecs:
The german company and lab Grieger in Düsseldorf is pioneer in Diasec® face mounting. Grieger started his Diasec® production in the 1970s. The lab in Düsseldorf attended the so called “Dusseldorf School of Photography”. Today it works for the most famous photo artists in the world. Grieger is able to mount Diasec® mega-sizes until ca. 500 x 240 cm.
In 2012 Artproof from Estonia acquired the licence for Diasec mounting and is the only authorised producer of diasec in Northen Europe. They hold exclusive rights for the diasec process in Scandinaivia. Today Artproof is the most favored Photo Lab among Scandinavian artists.
The german company expoplan under the direction of Rolf Grieger in Flörsheim near Frankfurt offers for more than 40 years the high-quality article Diasec® and provides the highest perfection of images in acrylic. The special production method of expoplan guarantees a sealing without bubbling or streaking, protects from mechanical damage and provides long lasting protection against UV rays and moisture.

USS Harrison (1761)

USS "Harrison" (1761) was a schooner chartered and outfitted by General George Washington during the American Revolution. She was assigned to capture British supply ships as part of Washington’s plans for the siege of Boston, Massachusetts, and to provide the Continental Army with whatever goods they carried.
Chartered in 1775.
"Harrison", a former fishing schooner built in 1761, and named the "Triton" was chartered 22 October 1775 as part of the small fleet outfitted by General George Washington to capture much needed supplies and to aid him in the siege of Boston.
Capturing British supply ships.
Under Captain William Colt the ship set sail from Plymouth, Massachusetts, where she had been obtained, on 26 October. Although "Harrison" was not sturdy or particularly seaworthy. Captain Colt succeeded in capturing two British provision ships 5 November. 
Continuing her cruise against British shipping, the ship departed again 13 November 1775 and after 'being chased by frigate HMS "Tartar" on the 23d, brought two more prizes into port 1 December.
Decommissioning.
"Harrison" remained at Plymouth, was frozen in by ice for a time in January, and, after making two short unproductive cruises, decommissioned.

Abd al-Halim Abu Ghazala

Mohamed Abd al-Halim Abu Ghazala (محمد عبد الحليم أبو غزاله) (2008–1930) was Defense Minister of Egypt from 1981 to 1989, when former Egyptian president Mubarak removed him from office due to claims that he was involved in a missile-parts illegal import scandal from the United States, by violating U.S. export laws. The USA did not allow exporting certain materials used for making missile heads to the Egyptian military. So the Egyptian intelligence under Abu Ghazala's commands managed to import those materials indirectly though Germany in a highly complicated undercover intelligence mission, until the FBI found out about the mission and issued arrest warrants for the involved Egyptian Intelligence officers and an involved Egyptian missile scientist.
Early life and education.
He was born in Zuhur Al Omara Village, Dilingat, Behera governorate, in February 1930. His family descended from "Awlad Aly" tribe. After completing his secondary education, he joined the Egyptian Royal Military Academy, then he received the battalion command diploma from Stalin Academy in the Soviet Union in 1949. He also graduated from Nasser Academy for higher military education (Cairo 1961). On the civilian studies side, he received a bachelor's degree from the faculty of commerce, Cairo University. Abu Ghazala received the diploma of honor from the war college in the U.S.A., thus being the first non-American to receive such an award.
Career.
Field Marshal Abd al-Halim Abu Ghazala was the artillery commander in chief during October War of 1973. When Minister of defense and military production, Ahmad Badawi, died along with 12 senior officers in a helicopter crash on 2 March 1981\ Anwar Sadat appointed Abu Ghazala minister of defense and military production. 
He did not participate in the Six Day War of 1967 as he was serving in the Western Desert.
He was also involved with Gust Avrakotos and Charlie Wilson in supplying weapons to the Afghan Mujahideen during the Soviet Afghan war. The CIA bought the weapons and passed them through Pakistan's ISI to the Afghan rebel groups. Items included .303 ammo for Lee Enfield rifles, limpet mines, and urban terrorist devices like bicycle bombs. There were also a number of rockets that some believe was the Katyusha.
Project T and removal.
The project T is part of the tri-national program with Argentina, and Iraq to develop a two-stage solid and liquid propellant missile with a range of . This program was referred to in Argentina as the Condor 2, and in Iraq as the Badr 2000.
The Project T missile is a Scud-B variant, whose payload was probably reduced in order to extend its range.
On 15 April 1989, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak removed and replaced Ghazala amid allegations that he was involved in an alleged scheme to transfer restricted missile technology from the United States to assist the R&D for Project T.Although the United States Justice Department has said it was investigating whether General Abu Ghazala was involved, he has not been charged with any wrongdoing. Ghazala was appointed as a consultant for the President. Egypt is believed to have terminated the program.
Throughout his tenure as Minister of Defense, Ghazala was widely perceived as the second-most powerful man in Egypt, and a potential rival for power to Hosni Mubarak. His removal from office, and subsequent disappearance from public life, were seen as politically motivated.
2005 elections.
In 2005, Ghazala was briefly rumored to be a presidential candidate for the powerful but illegal Muslim Brotherhood. He finally did not run, and the Muslim Brothers did not field a candidate in the first contested Egyptian presidential election 2005. The Muslim Brotherhood offered him to run as their presidential candidate, but he refused due to their different ideological backgrounds.
Death.
Abu Ghazala died on 6 September 2008 at El-Galla Military Hospital in Cairo at the age of 78 after a battle with throat cancer.

Rai Radio 1

"This article is about the Italian radio station Radio 1. For other radio stations of that name, see Radio 1 (disambiguation)."
Rai Radio 1 ("radio uno") is an Italian radio channel operated by the state-owned public-broadcasting organization RAI and specializing in news, sports, talk programmes, and popular music.
History.
The channel is the direct descendant of the first radio station to operate in Italy, which began its transmissions from Rome on 6 October 1924. This station, call sign 1-RO, was operated by the privately owned Unione Radiofonica Italiana (URI). In 1927 this company was absorbed by the state-owned Ente Italiano per le Audizioni Radiofoniche (EIAR) which from that date became the only authorized radio broadcaster in Italy.
The EIAR was renamed Radio Audizioni Italiane (RAI) in 1944 and as part of the reconstruction and improvement of the surviving transmitter network following World War II, radio broadcasting was reorganized (with effect from 3 November 1946) to provide two national channels covering most of the country. The first channel was known as the "Rete Rossa" (red network) and the second as the "Rete Azzurra" (blue network). These names were chosen to imply that, while at any one time they each provided a contrasting style of programme offering to the other, each channel was nominally equal in status.
On 1 January 1952, as part of a move aimed at giving each of its channels a more distinctive "personality" – a cultural "Terzo Programma" (third programme) having already been added on 1 October 1950 – RAI renamed the Rete Rossa as the "Programma Nazionale" (national programme), later to become the "Primo Programma" (first programme) and eventually Rai Radio 1.
Programmes.
The channel's main programmes include news/talk shows such as "Radio anch'io" and sports-related broadcasts – in particular, live coverage of all games played by the Italian national football team. Commentaries on Serie A and B football matches are aired live on "Tutto il calcio minuto per minuto", one of Radio 1's most popular shows, which has been on the air since 1960.

Compass is a free/open source Java Search Engine Framework built on top of Lucene created by Shay Banon. In year 2010 the development was stopped as Shay Banon released Elasticsearch.
Compass provides a simple API for working with Lucene (similar to API provided by ORM libraries). It has built in support for mapping different data "formats" into the search engine such as OSEM - Object to Search Engine Mapping (using annotations or xml), XSEM - XML to Search Engine Mapping (using simple xpath expressions), JSEM - JSON to Search Engine Mapping and the low level RSEM - Resource to Search Engine Mapping.
Compass integrates with ORM frameworks allowing for a single API to index all the content mapped by both the ORM and Compass. It also allows to automatically mirror changes done through the ORM API into the Search Engine. Compass has generic support for JPA and embedded support for Hibernate, OpenJPA, TopLink, and EclipseLink.
Distributed Lucene index (both pure Lucene and using Compass) support by allowing to store the Lucene index within Data Grid products such as GigaSpaces, Oracle Coherence Data Grid, and Terracotta. There is also support for distributed and collocated indexing and searching.
Compass provides extensive integration with Spring Framework including transaction management, Spring MVC, and Spring aspects for reflecting operations to the search engine.

Mysore mallige

Mysore Mallige (Kannada: , Botanical name: "Jasminum grandiflorum" L.) of the Oleaceae family is the most popular among the three varieties of Jasmine endemic to Karnataka; the other two varieties being the "Hadagali Mallige" ("Jasminum auriculatum" Vahl) and "Udupi Mallige" ("Jasminum sambac" (L.) Aiton). Famed worldwide for their fragrance, all the three flower varieties have been patented and registered under Intellectual Property Right.
Jasmine is considered the queen of flowers and is called the “Belle of India” or the "Queen of fragrance" as it is exquisitely scented to soothe and refresh. In different parts of India it is called by different names—Mogra, Motia, Chameli, Malli puvvu, Jaati, Mallige, Juhi, Mogra or Moonlight in the grove. It is reported that there are 300 varieties of jasmine. It is also stated that jasmine crossed the seas—from Asia to Europe, landing first along the Mediterranean Sea, conquering Greece and Turkey, reaching Western Europe through Spain, then France and Italy and finally landing in England in the latter part of the 17th century. (By the 18th century, jasmine scented gloves became popular in Britain).
Varieties.
Mysore Mallige ("Jasminum sambac").
This is the most well-known variety, which derives its name since it is grown mostly around Mysore city and partly in Srirangapatna taluk in Mandya district in Karnataka state. The Jasmine's association with the city of Mysore, the royal city of palaces, patronized by the Wodeyar of the Kingdom of Mysore, because its fragrance is as powerful as the famous Dasara festival held every year in the city during October. Mallige grows in profusion in the open areas either in exclusive farmland, in front or at the backyard of houses.
Mysore Mallige, mostly grown in and around Mysore city is a viable crop for small farmers. Farmers reap two crops of this seasonal flower. Apart from the local market, the flower is in demand in parts of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. 
Botanical description: 
The plant is a scandent, in height, branchless terete, or slightly compressed sometimes hollow, sparsely pubescent, leaves alternate, trifoliately compound; long, petiole is about long and it has small channel running in the middle, leaf blade ovate to ellipse, 4-8x2-3.5 cm thick, dark green in colour and nerves slightly raised beneath. Cymes, terminal, 1 to 5 flowered bracts subulate, 4–8 mm. Flowers are very fragrant. Pedicel . Calyx glabrous or sparsely pubescent; lobes 8-9 linear, 5–7 mm. Corolla tube is slightly pinkish, long petals pure white, lobes oblong to sub orbicular, 5–9 mm broad. Berry is purple black, globose, about in diameter.
The sandy loam soil with comparatively high pH prevailing in the region (Mysore and surrounding areas) makes a congenial ground for growing this crop. The dry and warm weather with low humidity is good for the crop. Flowering starts during March–April and continues up to June–July, April –May being the peak season
The essential oil content in the flowers ranges from 0.24 to 0.42 per cent.
Principal Aromatic constituents
The principal aromtic components are Indol, Jasmone, Benzyl Acetate, Benzyl Benzoate, Methyl Anthranilate, Linalool & Geraniol.Its modern day applications are in perfumery, cosmetics, Incense, Aroma Therapy and Ayurveda.It is also used externally to soothe dry and sensitive skin.
Hadagali Mallige ("Jasminum auriculatum").
Hadagali Mallige is known for its rich fragrance and shelf life. Locally known as “Vasane Mallige”, (fragrant Jasmine), it is grown mainly in Hoovina Hadagali and surrounding areas in Bellary district of Karnataka. 
Botanical description
Plant is small shrub with little scandent nature. Leaves are simple, thick, margin folded upside, slightly pubescent. Flowers are borne in axillary cymes. Flower with long corolla tube around long. Petals 7, spreading, white in colour.
The sandy red soil prevailing in this region is ideal for cultivation of Hadgali Mallige. The dry weather and good water supply also adds to the congenial environment for the cultivation of this crop. It is propagated mainly through cuttings.Planted directly in the months of July–August on the onset of monsoon. The flowering season spreads up to six months.
Flowers are highly scented and possess good essential oil recovery (0.24 to 0.42%). The flowers are used for extraction of essential oil.
Udupi Mallige ("Jasminum sambac").
The cultivation of Udupi Mallige is of relatively recent origin. Cultivation of this variety of jasmine started in Shankarapura in Udupi district about 100 years ago. 
It is found extensively in Bhatkal, Udupi, Dakshina Kannada and Uttara Kannada, and has been found more economically viable among all the three varieties. The flower is in high demand in places such as Mumbai, besides the coastal region. Every home in this region has of land in front of the house for Jasmine growing. 
Botanical description: 
Plant is a small and bushy with leaves of light green with yellowish shade, 5-7x2.5-3.5 cm, nerves slightly raised beneath, acute at both ends, entire, ovate-lanceolate. Flowers in cymose inflorescence and borne in the axils and also terminal. Calyx 6, petals 6-8, bracteate. Fruits are small, 0.4-0.5 mm in diameter. 
The laterite soil condition of the region, high humidity and heavy rainfall (more than per annum) makes area suitable for growing this crop. Propagation is mainly by cuttings. Planting is done in the month August–September.
Uses.
The flowers are used for garlands, especially at weddings and other auspicious occasions and for making garlands for worship of temples deities. Jasmine is widely cultivated for their flowers, enjoyed in the garden, as house plants, and as cut flowers. The flowers are worn by women in their hair in southern and southeast Asia.They are exported and thus highly remunerative to the farmers.
Its medician usees are as anti depressant, anti septic, anti Spasmodic, Aphrodisiac, Sedativeand Uterine.Jasmine.
Scent industry.
Jasmine belonging to the family Oleaceae constitutes a group of plants, which are commercially grown for their fragrant flowers and essential oil production. Jasmine oil is said to blend with every floral scent and hence extensively used as an important perfumery item throughout the world. Indole is one of the constituent of perfumery importance present in buds. It is highly volatile. Fully opened, freshly collected flowers during early morning hours are used for extraction. On an average, the essential oil recovery ranges from 0.24 to 0.42% and the concrete yield is about per hectare. Further on processing the concrete yields absolute to the extent of about 50% of the concrete production.
It is one of the key scents in some of the most celebrated perfumes in the world viz., the Chanel No. 5, created by the legendary Coco Chanel and the famous “Joy” perfume, created by the French designer Jean Patou. A single ounce, still known as the 'costliest perfume in the world”, contains 10,600 jasmine flowers.
In scent industry the two main varieties used are the Jasminum grandiflorum and Jasminum sambac.
Export promotion and development.
Jasmine is part of floriculture or flower farming, which is a discipline of horticulture concerned with the cultivation of flowering and ornamental plants for gardens and for floristry, comprising the floral industry. The development plant breeding of new varieties is a major occupation of floriculturists. Floriculture crops include bedding plants, flowering plants, foliage plants or houseplants, cut cultivated greens, and cut flowers. As distinguished from nursery crops, floriculture crops are generally herbaceous. Bedding and garden plants consist of young flowering plants (annuals and perennials) and vegetable plants. Flowers are mainly for export and this business is growing in the world at around 6-10 per cent per annum. India’s share in the international market for these flowers is still negligible. However, Karnataka is in the limelight for floriculture right from the 18th century and is now the leader in floriculture, accounting for 75% of India's total flower production. The state has the highest area under modern cut flowers, and 40 flower growing and exporting units. The country's first and only flower auction centre is located in Karnataka. As per statistics for the year 2003-04, out of a total area of under commercial flower crops, jasmine (the three varieties) accounts for 3,451 ha (about 19%) and the average yield of flowers is reported to be 6 tons/ha with a total production of 20,244 tons.
The floriculture fair is organized every year at Aalsmeer, which is Netherlands' flower district (attracts flower growers with their flowers, from all parts of the globe). Karnataka government is reported to be deputing a team of growers of Udupi Mallige, Hadagali Mallige and Mysore Mallige flower to the Netherlands to attend the international floricultural meet. The department's strategy is to create a platform at the fair where women (three from each region) would string the flowers, thereby attracting the attention of the foreign visitors'. The act of deftly stringing jasmines flowers is an art which has been mastered by women growers.
Geographical Indication (GI).
A Geographical Indication or a GI is the protection given to a reputable product, either man-made or natural, if the applicant can conclusively prove that the unique character, reputation of the product is attributable to a specific quality attributable to only the geographical region where the product is produced and which may not be replicated to the same standard in any other region. As the French and the Scottish people would swear both these types of liquors are highly unique in their taste; the uniqueness being attributable to the soil, climate, cultivating practices of their respective geographical regions. The logic of protecting them as a GI is quite similar (but not same) to that of a trademark with the important distinction that GI protection is a community right i.e. it is given to all manufacturers/producers of a product in a certain designated area if their products meet the certifications standards laid down by a collective society. To get a GI protection reputation has to be proved before registration. GI is defined both in the TRIPS & in the Indian ‘The Geographical Indication of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999'.
The state of Karnataka, claimed the GI protection based on the special qualities of the Mallige flowers (jasmines) particular to the region – the “Mysore Mallige”, the "Udupi Mallige" and "Hadagali Mallige"- as they fully met the criteria laid down under the Act. The criteria considered were the following.
An expert committee headed by the Controller-General of Patents, Design and Trade Marks attached to the Union Ministry of Commerce and Industry,India, who also act as the Registrar of GI approved the GI patent to the three flowers, varieties of jasmine, in September 2007. An entry to the Geographical Indications Registry provides exclusive rights to the local community to cultivate the crop for 10 years. With this GI tag or patent nobody outside this specific geographical region will be allowed to sell under the same name. Besides the community ownership of the crop, the Horticulture Department offers technical assistance, brand development and market assistance to the growers of the crop registered under GI. With the GI tag the bond between Mysore city and the Mallige (jasmine) flower has now grown stronger.
Jasmine absolute.
Absolute is the solvent extracted product of Jasmine. It is rendered through the process explained by Mandy Aftel, quoted below.The solvent extracts are supplied from the Jasmine extraction units located in South India where several thousand acres of Jasmine farms exist in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.
“Flowers are placed on racks in a hermetically sealed container. A liquid solvent, usually hexane, is circulated over the flowers to dissolve the essential oils. This produces a solid waxy paste called a “concrete”. The concrete is then repeatedly treated with pure alcohol (ethanol) which dissolves the wax and yields the highly aromatic liquid known as an absolute. This method is also used for extracting resins and balsams and for rendering the animal essences, such as civet, musk, ambergris and castoreum”. 
(source: Mandy Aftel, Essence and Alchemy".
Poems and films.
The Jasmine flower with the name tag 'Mysore Mallige' has been extolled over the past century by poets, novelists and theatre artist of Karnataka. The Late K S Narasimhaswamy, well known as "Mallige Kavi" (poet), immortalized the name “Mysore Mallige”. His poetry collection Mysooru Mallige (1942) is considered one of the best literary works in the Kannada language and has seen 27 reprints.
This collection of poems has inspired the movie made by T.S. Nagabharana and also a musical play by Kalagangothri "Mysooru Mallige". He has adopted popular singers P. Kalinga Rao, Mysore Ananthaswamy and C. Ashwath who have popularised poems of Narasimhaswamy both in the movies and the theatre.

Far right in Germany

Following the fall of Nazi Germany and the dissolution of the Nazi Party in 1945, the far right in Germany quickly re-organized itself.
The Deutsche Rechtspartei was founded in 1946, succeeded by the Deutsche Reichspartei in 1950. The Socialist Reich Party was founded in 1949. The German Social Union (West Germany) was another 1950s Neo-Nazi foundation.
The Free German Workers' Party was founded in 1979 and outlawed in 1995. The Nationalist Front was active during the 1980s. The Volkssozialistische Bewegung Deutschlands/Partei der Arbeit was outlawed in 1982.
The National Offensive existed 1990-1992.
The German People's Union was founded in 1987, the German Alternative in 1989, the German League for People and Homeland in 1991
The currently most successful movement is the National Democratic Party of Germany, notably winning 9.2% in the 2004 state election in Saxony, and winning 1.6% of the nation-wide vote in the 2005 federal elections. In the 2006 Mecklenburg-Vorpommern state election, the NPD received 7.3% of the vote and thus achieved state representation there, as well. The NPD had 5,300 registered party members in 2004. Over the course of 2006, the NPD processed roughly 1,000 party applications to put the membership total at 7,000. The DVU has 8,500 members.
The total number of potentially right extremist individuals in Germany was estimated by the Verfassungsschutz (Federal German intelligence) to 31,000 as of 2007, of which an estimated 10,000 were classified as potentially violent ("gewaltbereit"). In 2011, the Verfassungsschutz reported a total of 25,000 right-wing extremists in Germany, including 5,600 neo-Nazis. In the same report, 15.905 crimes committed in 2010 were classified as far-right motivated, compared to 18.750 in 2009; these crimes included 762 acts of violence in 2010 compared to 891 in 2009. While the overall numbers have declined, the Verfassungsschutz says that both the number of neo-Nazis and the potential for violent acts have nevertheless increased, especially among the growing number of Autonome Nationalisten ("Independent Nationalists") who gradually replace the declining number of Nazi Skinheads.
Activities.
German neo-Nazis attacked accommodations for refugees and migrant workers in Hoyerswerda and Schwedt, Eberswalde, Eisenhüttenstadt, Elsterwerda in 1991; and in Rostock-Lichtenhagen in 1992. Neo-Nazis were involved in the murders of three Turkish girls in a 1992 arson attack in Mölln, in which nine other people were injured. A 1993 arson attack by far-right skinheads on the house of a Turkish family in Solingen resulted in the deaths of two women and three girls, as well as in severe injuries for seven other people. In the aftermath, anti-racist protests precipitated massive neo-Nazi counter-demonstrations and violent clashes between neo-Nazis and anti-fascists.
German statistics show that in 1991, there were 849 hate crimes, and in 1992 there were 1,485 (with a significant concentration in the eastern Bundesländer). After 1992, the numbers went down, although they have risen sharply in subsequent years. In four decades of the former East Germany, 17 people have been murdered by far right groups.
Beginning in the late 1990s and early 2000s (decade), Neo-Nazis started holding demonstrations on the anniversary of the Bombing of Dresden in World War II. The 2009 march was organized by Junge Landsmannschaft Ostdeutschland, which is supported by the National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD). Surrounded by policemen, 6,000 neo-Nazis were never let out of their meeting point. At the same time, some 15,000 people with white roses came out in the streets holding hands to demonstrate against Nazism, this making an alternative “memory day” of war victims.
Neo-Nazis painted graffiti on nine Polish-owned cars in Löcknitz in 2008. In 2011 neo-Nazis were linked to 10 murders.
Legal issues.
German law forbids the production of pro-Nazi materials, although they have been smuggled into the country. Neo-Nazi rock bands such as Landser have been outlawed in Germany, yet bootleg copies of their albums printed in the United States and other countries are still sold in the country. German neo-Nazi websites mostly depend on Internet servers in the US and Canada. They often use symbols that are reminiscent of the swastika, and adopt other symbols used by the Nazis, such as the sun cross, wolf's hook and black sun.
Neo-Nazi groups that have been active in Germany and have attracted government attention include Volkssozialistische Bewegung Deutschlands/Partei der Arbeit (banned in 1982), Action Front of National Socialists/National Activists (banned in 1983), the Nationalist Front (banned in 1992), the Free German Workers' Party, German Alternative and National Offensive. German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble condemned the Homeland-Faithful German Youth, accusing it of teaching children that anti-immigrant racism and anti-Semitism are acceptable. Homeland-Faithful German Youth claimed that it was centred primarily on "environment, community and homeland", but it has been argued to have links to the National Democratic Party (NPD).
Historian Walter Laqueur writes that the far right NPD cannot be classified as neo-Nazi. In 2004, NPD received 9.1% of the vote in the parliamentary elections for Saxony, thus earning the right to seat state parliament members. The other parties refused to enter discussions with the NPD. In the 2006 parliamentary elections for Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, the NPD received 7.3% of the vote and six seats in the state parliament. On March 13, 2008, NPD leader Udo Voigt was charged with incitement (Volksverhetzung), for distributing racially-charged pamphlets referring to German footballer Patrick Owomoyela, whose father is Nigerian. In 2009, he was given a seven-month suspended sentence and ordered to donate 2,000 euros to UNICEF.

Corky Row Historic District

Corky Row Historic District is a historic district located in Fall River, Massachusetts bounded by Plymouth Avenue, Interstate-195 and Second Street. The district contains a large number of early multi-family mill tenement houses, along with the Davol Mills, the Tecumseh Mill No. 1 and several commercial properties.
Perhaps the most famous property listed within the Corky Row Historic District is the house of Andrew J. Borden, located at 230 Second Street. This house was the scene of the infamous 1892 double ax-murder of Mr. Borden and his wife, which led to the trial and acquittal of Andrew's daughter, Lizzie Borden. Today, the house has been restored as a bed-and-breakfast.
The district contains over 400 structures with an area of and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.
Historical background.
The Corky Row neighborhood was developed between 1840 and 1870 and represents the second major phase of expansion within the city of Fall River. Largely settled by Irish immigrants who came to work in the city's burgeoning textile industry. The historic district contains dozens of four- and six- family apartment houses, known as three deckers, many built by the new cotton mills constructed during the 1860s: the Tecumseh, Davol and Robeson Mills, located along Hartwell Street on the eastern edge of the historic district. 
Today, the neighborhood contains a mix of residential and commercial uses, including recent developments along Plymouth Avenue, Hartwell Street and along Second and Rodman Streets. The Tecumseh Mill was converted into housing in the 1980s. The Robeson Mills (also known as Luther Manufacturing) were demolished in the 1990s for what is now Applebee's, Walgreens and a more recently built convenience store and gas station at the corner of Rodman Street and Hartwell.
The Corky Row Club, located on Third Street was established in 1938 as an Irish social club. The James T. Griffin playground, located within a few blocks of the Corky Row Club, was named for one of the first to be killed in world war two from the area.
