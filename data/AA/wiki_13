By the Way World Tour

The By the Way World Tour was a worldwide concert tour by American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers to support the band's eighth studio album, "By the Way". The band was at a commercial peak, having only been off the road for a short amount of time after touring in support of their 1999, best-selling "Californication". The band began writing their next album in early 2001, and released "By the Way" over a year later, on July 9, 2002.
A DVD documenting a show from the tour, titled "Live at Slane Castle", was released in 2003.
Tour overview.
The "By the Way World Tour" was another successful tour for the band behind another chart topping album. The tour unlike previous tour saw the band start to move further away from their earlier '80s songs and place more of a focus on newer stuff with a heavy dose like always of songs from their hit album, "Blood Sugar Sex Magik" however fans were treated to the first performance of "Police Helicopter" since 1999 and "Blackeyed Blonde" since 2000. "Me and My Friends remained a constant staple in the band's setlist and one of the few songs from the '80s they continue to play. To date, eleven of the album's sixteen songs have been performed live including a one time performance of the album's outtake, "Time". Almost every show on the tour started off with the album's title track, which has since become one of the band's most performed live songs rarely being left out of the setlist in the ten years since the album and songs release. "Get On Top" and "Purple Stain", two songs from the band's 1999 album, "Californication" both made their long awaited live debuts on this tour. 
This tour also marked the last time the songs "Blackeyed Blonde", "Cabron", "Fela's Cock", "I Could Die For You", "Minor Thing", "Search and Destroy", "This is the Place", "Time", "Venice Queen", "You Always Sing the Same" and "Warm Tape" were performed live.

Ferrybridge Henge

Ferrybridge Henge is a Neolithic henge near Ferrybridge, West Yorkshire (). It is close to the A1 and M62 and Ferrybridge power station. Ferrybridge Henge is the furthest south of Yorkshire's henges, and is the only one in West Yorkshire. The site is of national importance and is protected from unauthorised change as a Scheduled Ancient Monument; despite this it is under threat from ploughing.
History.
There was activity on the site before the current henge in the form of circular monuments and hengiform monuments dating from 3500 BC to 3000 BC. Ferrybridge Henge dates from 3000 BC to 2500 BC. Around 2000 BC–1500 BC, during the early Bronze Age, barrow burials were performed on the site. The inhumations were discovered with grave goods such as ceramic pots and flint tools. The area was probably abandoned from about 1500 BC to 500 BC when there was some reoccupation by Iron Age farmers. The henge was not cultivated and may have been retained as a shrine for the Iron Age people of the area and later during the Romano-British period. An Iron Age sword scabbard was discovered in the inner henge ditch as well as a Roman coin. That burials continued in the area around the henge in the Saxon period despite the presence of a Christian cemetery nearby has been taken as evidence of pagan beliefs prevailing in the area. Ferrybridge Henge and its surrounding area was used as farmland during the medieval period.
The site was excavated by West Yorkshire Archaeological Services in 1991. In 2007 a suspected extension of the henge was unearthed near Pontefract. The site consists of a field system and drainage ditches thought to date to the Iron Age or Romano-British periods. It was discovered when archaeologists were investigating a site intended for the construction of a row houses; once the archaeological survey was complete, the construction went ahead.
Layout.
Ferrybridge Henge is a circular site and is about in diameter. The henge is surrounded by two ditches and a bank. The inner ditch is wide and deep. There is a wide berm between the inner ditch and a wide limestone bank. Separating the bank from the outer ditch is another berm, also wide; the outer ditch is wide and deep. This layout is typical of other henges. The site has two entrances, one in the north east and one in the south west.

Moment of Truth World Tour

The Moment of Truth World Tour is the second worldwide tour by American R&B/Pop singer, Whitney Houston. The tour started in North America during the summer of 1987, in support of the release of her second hit album "Whitney". The tour continued overseas during 1988 in Europe, Asia and Australia.
History.
Following the release of "Whitney", Houston began promoting the album with a world tour. She began on July 4 in Tampa, Florida, where she played to over 70,000 people. In a specious show of religious faith, Houston barred the sale of beer during the concert, alienating most of the thirsty audience members who were expecting an Independence Day celebration to remember and instead left early for Ybor City. John W. Gardner, personally attended the concert and left early because there were no beer sales. She returned to the Sunshine State where she ended her North American leg at the Orange County Convention Center on December 8, 1987.
In Europe, Houston visited 12 countries, playing to over half a million fans. Houston played nine consecutive nights at Wembley Arena in London. At the same time, the singer had just broken The Beatles' record of seven consecutive #1 singles in the US. A party was thrown with guests such as Elton John, Fleetwood Mac, and Clive Davis. Houston cancelled an Italian concert date after agreeing to fly back to London to pay tribute to a then-imprisoned Nelson Mandela who was celebrating his birthday. Houston performed a set at Wembley Stadium, playing to over 72,000 fans during the historic event. Following this, Houston resumed her tour in Italy. In 1988, Houston returned from the European leg to perform a benefit concert for the United Negro College Fund on August 28 at Madison Square Garden in New York. It was Houston's only North American date during 1988 after playing 89 dates the previous year. The concert raised over $300,000 for the UNCF.
The tour was one of the top ten highest-grossing tours of the year. The North American leg of the tour alone grossed over $24 million, enough to make her the second highest-earning female entertainer of the year according to Forbes. In addition, the European leg was sold out.
The show.
Like her previous tour, Houston again performed on a round stage in the center of the arena or auditorium so that everyone can see her. The seven-piece band was situated below her. There were two outfit changes; no stage props. However, unlike her previous tour, Houston called upon three backup dancers during the uptempos. Jonathan Butler and Kenny G opened during the North American leg.
With two albums under her belt, the singer had more material to choose from. She included most of the songs from "Whitney", the biggest hits from her debut, as well as the gospel song "He/I Believe". Houston also performed songs from her peers during various concerts, interpreting Aretha Franklin, Chaka Khan, Anita Baker, and Janet Jackson. Like her debut tour, Houston proved herself to be a creative musician. She rearranged most of the songs into soulful jazzy numbers and did a lot of improvisation. "The Montreal Gazette" said, "Whatever faults the 24-year-old singer has, she is first and foremost a creative musician." The pop hit "How Will I Know" was given a jazzy beginning and gospel-like ending. "You Give Good Love" was slowed down into a steamy and sensual slow jam. Houston often scatted with sax player Jay Davidson on "Just the Lonely Talking Again". Most critics noted "He/I Believe" and "Greatest Love of All" as being the show's highlights.
Despite the praise for her voice and arrangements, many critics noted her lack of dancing and movements. "The Richmond Times" said "she is about as stiff as a cardboard box." Some noted that she lacked a true personality. Others complained that despite the name of the tour, she followed the same formula as her previous tour.

Summer Song

"Summer Song" is the twelfth single by Japanese pop singer-songwriter Yui. The single was released on July 2, 2008. Summer Song was aired on the last episode of "Yui Locks" on May 29, 2008.
The Limited Edition includes a special postcard of Yui with a message written by her, an original summer calendar card sticker with Yui picture on it & bonus DVD.
Background and writing.
In interviews with Japanese magazines Pati Pati and Zipper, Yui said she finished the entirety of the song 3 years ago. However, due to timing issues, as she would prefer to release it during the summer, the song was delayed until the release on July 2, 2008. In writing the lyrics, Yui said she wanted to imbue a feeling of, "wanting to get by with my own ability", and an image of, "longing to go to the sea". She also said she wrote the song from a girl's perspective, while recollecting her own memories she'd seen during past summers.
The title "Summer Song" was chosen by Yui as she felt the feelings in the song could be expressed through the title. Interestingly, before the single, no Japanese artist has ever taken the song title "Summer Song", which was also instrumental in the choosing of the title.
Music video.
The music video begins with Yui playing guitar on a wooden platform and on a grassy field, and a girl making a picture frame with her hands and capturing various scenes of summer. After drawing pool-cleaning duties along with a boy, they spray water at each other and run around the drained pool. In the middle of the video, the girl is shown holding two tickets to a fireworks festival, and quickly putting them away when the boy looks at her. At the end of the video, the girl manages to gather her courage and ask the boy to come with her, which he gratefully accepts.
The actors in the music video are the same as those starred in Yui's "Laugh Away" video, with model Anri Okamoto playing the leading actress and Hayashi Kento playing the leading actor. The same couple would act in Yui's fifteenth single, "Gloria".

Stepped on My J'z

"Stepped on My J'z" is a song by American rapper Nelly. The song features American singer Ciara and rapper Jermaine Dupri. It was recorded for Nelly's fifth studio album, "Brass Knuckles". The track was produced by Jermaine Dupri, and was released as the second single from the album, but the music video was released before. This is the second time Ciara has worked with Jermaine Dupri, the first time working on the single "Like You" with Bow Wow.
Song information.
The song was originally to be the official second single, but was changed to the third single due to the single "Body on Me" charting too early, so the label changed its mind at the very last minute. At the BET Awards 2008, Ashanti announced that instead of them collaborating with the same single, she went her way with a different single for her album, and Nelly finally decided to make "J'z" the official second single once again. It was also said to have been a much better decision because this single would lend more of a hand in promoting more album sales, being that the single was more radio-friendly and had more chart-topping potential.
The song was performed on the BET Awards '08 by Nelly, Ciara and Jermaine.
Due to the lack of promotion from Nelly or his label, the single failed to chart any higher than it did. 
Music video.
The music video for "Stepped on My J'z" was filmed in the middle of May 2008 and directed by Benny Boom. It then premiered on the show Access Granted on June 11 on BET. The video also peaked at #1 on BET's 106 & Park. The music video starts off with young comedian/actor Lil' JJ, actor/singer Maestro Harrell, and another friend skipping school and returning with newly bought pairs of Jordans. Nelly starts his first verse seated atop a sports car with a video girl behind, both wearing Jordans. It then cuts over to the scene where Jeffrey Scott Bailey with a careless attitude walks past with a bike and steps on Nelly's freshly bought Jordans. Nelly then immediately confronts him, with his homeboys co-signing behind him, in a scene reminiscent to that of a cut from the popular Spike Lee film, 'Do the Right Thing'. The video then cuts to Jermaine Dupri doing his verse in his "personal shoe garage" dancing in front of a mirror and trying on different pairs of Jordans. It then quickly cuts to a black & white scene with Dupri atop a basketball goal imitating a popular commercial in which Michael Jordan continuously attempts to make free throws as Spike Lee blocks each and every shot, with Nelly portraying Michael in this scene. The video then cuts to Ciara and two other dancers pulling up to a basketball park in a blue candy-painted donk. Ciara and her dancers then cut to a sexy choreographed dance scene (which was made up literally two hours before the video was shot) as she sings her verse and shows off her turquoise Melody Ehsani "POW" 3-finger rings, Melody Ehsani "FOCUSED" plated necklace, and her pair of exclusive Jordans with a Chanel pocket purse attached to her left shoe. After her verse, Ciara dances to the words of Nelly's verse immediately following hers, throwing up the numbered Jordan signs as Nelly raps them. The video finally cuts to a collaborative scene with Nelly, Ciara, and Dupri on a basketball court with spectators cheering and dancing on the sidelines. The video ends this way with the three performing a choreographed "J'z" step, dancing around, and interacting with the fans. The St. Lunatics, Avery Storm and DJ Drama make cameo appearances in this video.

1970 Supreme Court Libel Case.
In 1965, an article by reporter Dorothy Sucher in the "News Review" published two quotations of citizen remarks at City Council meetings in which they characterized as "blackmail" the actions of Charles S. Bresler, a local real estate developer and member of the Maryland House of Delegates. Bresler filed suit in 1966, claiming that he had become "the most hated man in Greenbelt." Local volunteers formed a Freedom of the Press committee and went door to door to raise money for the paper's legal defense.
Bresler received a $17,500 libel judgment from the Prince George's County Circuit Court, which was upheld by the Maryland Court of Appeals in 1969.
In 1970, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled unanimously in favor of the "News Review" and overturned the lower courts' judgments. The Supreme Court held "that as a matter of constitutional law, the word 'blackmail' in these circumstances was not slander when spoken, and not libel when reported in the "Greenbelt News Review.""

Launched by Radisav Rodić, the owner of established dailies "Kurir" and "Glas javnosti", "Kurir-sport" was his second attempt (after his takeover and the eventual failure of "Ekipa" in 2005) at breaking the decades-long dominance of "Sportski žurnal" and "JSL Sport" on the sports daily market in Serbia.
However, much like "Ekipa" before it, "Kurir-sport" quickly found its readership lagging far behind the two established sports dailies. Launched in late 2007, the paper folded during spring 2008.
That was not the end of it, however, as on July 3, 2008, a group of 20 journalists formerly employed at "Kurir-sport" (out of the total 35 formerly employed at the short lived paper) decided to start a hunger strike in front of the Rodić's company offices claiming that he owes them between 3 and 4 million RSD (~€38,000-50,000) in unpaid salaries.

New Beginning (Mamba Seyra)

"New Beginning (Mamba Seyra)" (often referred to as simply "New Beginning") is a 1986 single by UK pop group Bucks Fizz. It was a comeback hit, achieving their highest chart placing for four years. 
Song history.
The song was released in May 1986 and was seen as a comeback single as it was their first release in eight months and featured new member Shelley Preston who had replaced Jay Aston a year earlier. It was also their first release on new record label, Polydor after their five-year contract with RCA had finished. The song was notable for its full and lavish production and multi-layered vocal work and received much praise from critics as well as becoming very popular on radio. The song became a big hit in the Summer of 1986 and reached the top ten in the UK, becoming a No.8 hit and spending 10 weeks on the chart. This was the group's biggest hit in four years, but was also their last top 40 hit. 
The song was written by Mike Myers and Tony Gibber and was produced by Myers along with the group's regular producer Andy Hill. According to the group, the recording of the song took an unusually long time due to the vocal tracks. As well as the group recording their vocals repeatedly, there was also a children's choir and gospel choir used on the track. The musicians in the studio also were used on distant back-up vocals. Member Cheryl Baker remembers one version where Hill instructed them to deliberately sing out of tune, which she found difficult. The original mix of the song was completed in February 1986. 
"New Beginning" (as it is very often more simply referred) was originally recorded a year earlier by Force 8 - who were actually pop group The Dooleys under an assumed name. The theme of the song is one of hope where the narrator talks about building a happier world, with some parts of the song sung in Swahili and Spanish. The video for the single depicts the group performing the song in a Metropolis-type setting backed by dancers and drummers - due to the heavy drum sound on the track.
"New Beginning" was followed up by a cover of the Stephen Stills song "Love The One You're With" and featured on the group's final studio album, "Writing on the Wall," which was released at the end of the year. Several versions of the song have been released. The album version differed slightly from the 7" mix in that member Bobby G features prominently on backing vocals at the end - a version that was used in the video. As well as this, two 12" singles were released: one with an extended version of the song, the other an extended mix by dance producer Ian Levine. On the "Writing on the Wall" CD re-issue in 2004, a largely instrumental extended version of the song was included as a bonus track. The song remains among the group's most highly regarded work.

Ward Homestead

Ward Homestead is a notable landmark because it is the combined work of three great 20th century figures, architect John Russell Pope and landscape designers, the Olmsted Brothers. 
Marcus L. Ward Home.
Ward Homestead, now known as Winchester Gardens, was established as the Marcus L. Ward Home for Aged and Respectable Bachelors and Widowers in 1922 upon the death of Marcus L. Ward. Son of Marcus Lawrence Ward, one time New Jersey Senator and Governor, Ward died with a substantial fortune of over $4,887,517.40 of which the vast majority went to the newly created home.
John Russell Pope.
After a site was selected in Maplewood, New Jersey, John Russell Pope was selected as the architect. The original three interconnected structures were built in a rusticated gothic style of stone and slate. Through careful investment of the original bequeathment, the Ward Home was constructed for $1,750,000 with over $5,000,000 still remaining in the bank. The home opened on August 31, 1927.
Ward Home Today.
The Ward Home foundation still exists in its original form, however the marketing name has changed to Winchester Gardens. In the 1980s, women were finally admitted to the home. In the 1990s, a large expansion added numerous apartments a villa in an incongruous style to what were vast lawns, putting greens, and ancient trees. The original Pope-designed portion of the home still features prominently in Winchester Gardens advertising.

Academy of Medicine (Atlanta, Georgia)

The Academy of Medicine in midtown Atlanta, Georgia was built in 1941 and housed the Medical Association of Atlanta until the 1970s.
Construction.
The Academy was designed by the Atlanta architecture firm of Hentz, Adler and Shutze, with R. Kennon Perry the project architect and Philip Trammell Shutze the supervising principal. The building was intended as a meeting place for Atlanta physicians. Shutze's austerely classical design is reminiscent of the work of John Soane and Benjamin Latrobe.
Recent history.
By the 1970s, the building had fallen into disrepair. The building was renovated in 1983 and is used by the public as well as the medical profession.
In 2008, Atlanta Medical Heritage, Inc. donated the Academy of Medicine to The Georgia Tech Foundation, Inc. due to lack of resources to maintain the facility. The Georgia Tech Foundation accepted the gift on behalf of the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the building’s name, "Academy of Medicine", must be retained. Additionally, the properties’ designation on the National Register of Historic Places, prevents the university from redeveloping the site or undergoing any improvements inconsistent with the Academy’s historical significance.
The property is undergoing restoration for community and campus use, and has been retrofitted to serve the larger community as an event facility. The spacious auditorium provides seating for 250, ideal for ceremonies, seminars, musical performances or lectures. Historic Academy of Medicine has a spacious central rotunda with a gorgeous domed ceiling from which the chandelier from "Gone With the Wind" hangs, which host weddings.

Julius Arnold

Julius Arnold (August 19, 1835 – February 3, 1915) was a German pathologist born in Zurich. He was the son of anatomist Friedrich Arnold (1803–1890).
He studied medicine at the Universities of Heidelberg, Prague, Vienna and Berlin, where he was a student of Rudolf Virchow (1821–1902). In 1859 he became a doctor of medicine, and in 1866 he became a professor of pathological anatomy and director of the institute of pathology at Heidelberg. Arnold was the author of 120 articles in the fields of histology and pathological anatomy.
His name is lent to a disorder known as Arnold–Chiari malformation, which occurs when the cerebellar tonsils and the medulla oblongata protrude through the foramen magnum into the spinal canal. Arnold described this malformation in an infant who died shortly after delivery, and published his account in an 1894 paper titled "Myelocyste, Transposition von Gewebskeimen und Sympodie". In 1891, Austrian pathologist Hans Chiari (1851–1916) also described this disorder, three years prior to Arnold's findings. In 1907, two of Dr. Arnold's students coined the eponym of "Arnold-Chiari malformation" in honor of both men.
Arnold died in 1915 in Heidelberg.

Ford Motor Company Assembly Plant (Atlanta)

The Ford Motor Company Assembly Plant at 699 Ponce de Leon Avenue in the Poncey-Highland neighborhood of Atlanta, Georgia was the headquarters of the Ford Motor Company's southeastern US operations from 1915 to 1942. As a result of good sales in Atlanta, and a desire to decentralize production, Ford established a combined assembly, sales, service and administration facility on Ponce de Leon Avenue, selling a peak of 22,000 vehicles per year. The assembly plant produced Model Ts, Model As and V-8s until 1942, when the plant was sold to the War Department and a new plant was opened in the Atlanta suburb of Hapeville.
The building was designed by Ford's in-house architect, John Graham. An office block in the front was backed by a multi-story loft-style assembly plant.
The War Department used the building as a storage depot and as administrative offices. Sold for development in 1979, the building is presently known as Ford Factory Square and is occupied by apartments and retail shops. Architects for the adaptive reuse project were Bradfield Associates.

Coal mining in India

Coal mining in India has a long history of commercial exploitation covering nearly 220 years starting in 1774 with John Sumner and Suetonius Grant Heatly of the East India Company in the Raniganj Coalfield along the Western bank of Damodar river. However, for about a century the growth of Indian coal mining remained sluggish for want of demand but the introduction of steam locomotives in 1853 gave a fillip to it. Within a short span, production rose to an annual average of . India could produce per year by 1900 and per year by 1920. The production got a sudden boost from the First World War but went through a slump in the early thirties. The production reached a level of by 1942 and by 1946.
With the advent of independence, the country embarked upon the 5-year development plans. At the beginning of the 1st Plan, annual production went up to . During the 1st Plan period itself, the need for increasing coal production efficiently by systematic and scientific development of the coal industry was being felt. Setting up of the National Coal Development Corporation (NCDC), a Government of India Undertaking in 1956 with the collieries owned by the railways as its nucleus was the first major step towards planned development of Indian Coal Industry. Along with the Singareni Collieries Company Ltd. (SCCL) which was already in operation since 1945 and which became a Government company under the control of Government of Andhra Pradesh in 1956, India thus had two Government coal companies in the fifties. SCCL is now a joint undertaking of Government of Andhra Pradesh and Government of India sharing its equity in 51:49 ratio.
Coal Mining Regions.
Coal reserves in India is one of the largest in the world. As on April 1, 2012, India had of the resource. The production of coal was in 2010-11. The production of lignite was in 2010-11. As on 2011, India ranked 3rd in world coal production. The energy derived from coal in India is about twice that of energy derived from oil, whereas worldwide, energy derived from coal is about 30% less than energy derived from oil.
Distribution of coal reserve by states.
The top producing states are:
Other notable coal-mining areas include:
Nationalisation of coal mines.
Right from its genesis, the commercial coal mining in modern times in India has been dictated by the needs of the domestic consumption. India’s has abundant domestic reserves of coal. Most of these are in the states of Jharkhand, Orissa, West Bengal, Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. On account of the growing needs of the steel industry, a thrust had to be given on systematic exploitation of coking coal reserves in Jharia Coalfield. Adequate capital investment to meet the burgeoning energy needs of the country was not forthcoming from the private coal mine owners.
Unscientific mining practices adopted by some of them and poor working conditions of labor in some of the private coal mines became matters of concern for the Government. On account of these reasons, the Central Government took a decision to nationalize the private coal mines. The nationalization was done in two phases, the first with the coking coal mines in 1971-72 and then with the non-coking coal mines in 1973. In October, 1971, the Coking Coal Mines (Emergency Provisions) Act, 1971 provided for taking over in public interest of the management of coking coal mines and coke oven plants pending nationalization. This was followed by the Coking Coal Mines (Nationalization) Act, 1972 under which the coking coal mines and the coke oven plants other than those with the Tata Iron & Steel Company Limited and Indian Iron & Steel Company Limited, were nationalized on May 1, 1972 and brought under the Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL), a new Central Government Undertaking. Another enactment, namely the Coal Mines (Taking Over of Management) Act, 1973, extended the right of the Government of India to take over the management of the coking and non-coking coal mines in seven States including the coking coal mines taken over in 1971. This was followed by the nationalization of all these mines on May 1, 1973 with the enactment of the Coal Mines (Nationalization) Act, 1973 which now is the piece of Central legislation determining the eligibility of coal mining in India.
All non-coking coal mines were nationalized in 1973 and placed under Coal Mines Authority of India. In 1975, Eastern Coalfields Limited, a subsidiary of Coal India Limited, was formed. It took over all the earlier private collieries in Raniganj Coalfield. Raniganj Coalfield covers an area of and has total coal reserves of . Eastern Coalfields puts the reserves at . That makes it the second largest coalfield in the country (in terms of reserves).

Molanus

Jan Vermeulen or Jan van der Meulen, (or Johannes, Jean, Ioanne) also known as Molanus (the Latin version, in French "Molano") (1533–1585) was an influential Counter Reformation Flemish Catholic theologian of Louvain University, where he was Professor of Theology, and Rector from 1578. From 1561 to 1563 he was headmaster at the Latin School in Duisburg, today's Landfermann-Gymnasium. Born at Lille (then under the Habsburgs), he was a priest and canon of St. Peter's church in Louvain, where he died.
Among many other subjects he wrote on the proper content of religious images, taking a very severe line in his "De Picturis et Imaginibus Sacris, pro vero earum usu contra abusus" ("Treatise on Sacred Images") of 1570. Five further, enlarged, editions of this appeared between 1570 and 1771, and a modern French translation has been published, most recently in 1996. He was lead editor of an edition of the works of Saint Augustine (Antwerp, Plantin Press, 1566–1577), and wrote a history of Louvain.
He is not to be confused with Gerhard Wolter Molanus (van Meulen), 1633–1722, an influential German Lutheran theologian.
Molanus and art.
Molanus is today mainly remembered by art historians for being one of the first authorities to turn the short and inexplicit decrees of the Council of Trent (1563) on sacred images into minutely detailed instructions for artists, which were then widely enforced in Catholic countries. His views on the older, originally Byzantine, traditional depiction of the Nativity are typical:
The Virgin is shown pale with pains, the midwives prepare a small (narcotic) drought for the childbirth. Why this? Is it because the Virgin Mary would have held back from any pain of childbirth, when in fact she brought forth her divine son without pain? And what pertains to the midwives who are mentioned in the apocryphal Book of the Infancy? Jerome says: There was no midwife! No obtrusiveness of women intervened! She, the Virgin, was both mother and midwife! I saw in not a few places the picture of the blessed Virgin lying on a bed, depicting childbirth, and she was suffering pains from this birth, but that is not true. How stupid! Those artists ought to be laughed at who paint Mary in the very act of childbirth pains, accompanied with pain, midwife, bed, little knives (to cut the umbilical cord), with hot compresses, and many other appurtenances. . . . Rather, those pictures should be promoted which show the birth of Christ in which the Blessed Virgin Mary with arms folded and on bended knee before her little son, as though he was just now brought forth into the light.
He objected on similar grounds to the "Death of the Virgin", her swooning at the foot of the Cross, and her being shown supplicating Christ for mankind in "Last Judgement" scenes. She would, he said, in fact be sitting alongside Christ in stern judgement:
Many painters show Mary and John the Baptist kneeling beside Our lord at the Last Judgment...But we may not think that at that day the Virgin Mary will kneel for us before the Judge, baring her breast to intercede for sinners. Nor may we think that John the Baptist will fall upon his knees to beg mercy for mankind in the way the painters show. Rather, the blessed Virgin and St. John shall sit beside the supreme Judge as assessors. The mercy which is extended now will have no place then. There will only be strict justice at that day.
Also condemned were Saint Christopher as a giant carrying Christ (and as the protector of travellers), Saint George and the Dragon, the Holy Kinship, the unicorn hunt in the Hortus Conclusus and many other depictions not verifiable from reliable sources – the "Golden Legend" was, he said, in fact of "lead".
Nudity, even of the infant Jesus, was to be avoided as much as possible, and drapes must cover the genitals where it could not be. Whilst condemning older depictions without a scriptural basis, he was not hesitant in creating new ones based on his own interpretation. Saint Joseph should not be shown as the old, semi-comical figure of the Middle Ages, but as young, vigorous and firmly in control of the Holy Family. Mary Magdalene should not be shown as an over-dressed prostitute, and generally dress should be simple. He opposed showing the "spasimo" or Swooning Virgin Mary in scenes of "Christ carrying the Cross" or the Crucifixion itself.

Atlanta Biltmore Hotel and Biltmore Apartments

The Atlanta Biltmore Hotel and Biltmore Apartments, located at 817 West Peachtree Street in Atlanta, Georgia, were developed by William Candler, son of Coca Cola executive Asa Candler, with Holland Ball Judkins, and John McEntee Bowman. Opening on April 19, 1924, the 11-story hotel and 10-story apartment buildings were located somewhat away from downtown Atlanta, in an area that became known as Midtown. Designed by the New York firm of Schultze and Weaver, the hotel was operated by Bowman-Biltmore Hotels.
It is easily distinguished by the towering radio masts on each end of the building, with vertical illuminated letters that spell out "BILTMORE". The top floor and radio masts broadcast WSB-AM from 1925 until 1956.
History.
In 1967 it was sold to Sheraton Hotels and became the Sheraton-Biltmore Hotel. Sheraton spent $5 million on renovations before selling the hotel in 1979 to Biltmore Hospitality Partners. The hotel continued operating independently as the Atlanta Biltmore before finally closing in 1982. The hotel was sold again in 1984 to Renaissance Investment Corporation. They planned to convert both the smaller apartment tower and the enormous hotel tower to condominiums. They completed work on the apartment tower, but then went bankrupt in 1986 and had to sell the entire property. The newly renovated apartment tower was opened as the Biltmore Suites Hotel while the main building remained vacant for many years.
The historic hotel building was finally gutted and transformed into office space, reopening in 1999. Due to extensive renovations over the years, there were only two remaining historic rooms, the two main floor ballrooms. They were fully restored as public function rooms. The Biltmore Suites Hotel was closed and converted to condominiums about this time.

A Praga

A Praga (English: The Plague) is a 1980 Brazilian horror film by
Brazilian film director José Mojica Marins. Marins is also known by his alter ego
Zé do Caixão (in English, Coffin Joe).
Plot.
Young couple Juvenal and Mariana go on a trip and Juvenal unknowingly takes some pictures of a strange elderly lady (played by Wanda Kosmo) who is eventually revealed to be a sinister witch. The witch then places a curse on the man for photographing her. A wound begins to open in his side which has an agonizing hunger for raw meat which he must constantly feed in order to stop the burning pain. Perplexing his doctors, Juvenal's wound becomes hungrier as the film progresses, the man becomes delirious and murders his wife, thinking she will leave him because of his condition. The witch then reappears and coaxes him into feeding the wound with the body of his dead wife. The separate skeletons of the couple are discovered lying next to each other by police months later.
Production.
The film was mostly shot in Super-8 in 1980, but the footage was shelved due to lack of resources to finish it. During the preparations of a major retrospective of his work that took place in São Paulo and Brazil in 2007, for which brand new 35 mm film prints of no less than 25 films were made, Mojica and producer Eugenio Puppo decided to finish the film. Puppo put together the raw material, shot additional scenes, edited and supervised the post-production process, and the result was shown to those who attended the retrospective. Puppo and Mojica are now looking for a way to transfer the film to 35mm. A Praga is expected to travel around international festivals.
The story is also featured in Marins' graphic novel series "O Estranho Mundo de Zé do Caixão" in the issue "A Praga" (V.1, #2).

Lao Krang

The Lao Krang (Thai: ลาวครั่ง ; endonym: ) are a sub-group of the Lao ethnic group. Also known as the Tai Krang (Thai: ไทครั่ง), they speak a dialect of the Lao language that is not too different from the modern Lao/Isan languages of Laos and Isan. The Lao Krang should not be confused with the Tai Khang (spelt the same as 'Thai Krang' in Thai) who are a closely related people inhabiting northeastern Laos.
Geographic Location.
The Lao Krang are spread out throughout Western and Central Thailand, especially the provinces of Phichit, Suphanburi, Uthai Thani, Chai Nat, Phitsanulok, Kamphaeng Phet, Nakhon Pathom and Nakhon Sawan. 
History.
The Lao Krang are descendants of Lao people from Luang Prabang and Houaphanh provinces who were enslaved by invading Siamese soldiers after the fall of the last remnant kingdoms of Lan Xang. The Lao Krang were settled in the rich farmlands of Central Thailand to work as farm labourers to increase food production for the army and capital. Aside from their geographic isolation, the cultural traits and language of the Lao Krang give away their ancestors' traditional homeland.
Religion and Culture.
The Lao Krang are Theravada Buddhists, but also maintain older animist beliefs. Especially revered is the tutelary spirit of the village, the "hu chao nei". Traditional activities include farming, as well as making a red dye from beetles used to stain textiles, hence the namesake "krang" or 'lac'. Traditionally, marriages were only between members of the same group.

BuEV Danzig

BuEV Danzig was a German association football club formed in 1903, from the city of Danzig, West Prussia (today Gdańsk, Poland).
__TOC__
History.
The city's first football side, "Fußball Club Danzig" was established 18 April 1903, and by 1905 was playing as "Ballspiel- und Eislauf-Verein Danzig" to reflect the club's interest in both football and ice skating. Between 1916 and 1930 the association was called "Verein für Leibesübungen Danzig" before again playing as "BuEV".
The footballers were a prominent side in Baltenverband competition in the early 20th century, appearing in five league finals between 1908 and 1913. However, the team only came away victorious in one of those title matches when they finally defeated "VfB Königsberg" (3:2) in 1912 after being beaten by that club in 1908 and 1909 (0:11, 0:1). "BuEV"'s regional title put them onto the national stage where they were put out in a quarterfinal contest versus "Viktoria 89 Berlin" (0:7).
Following the re-organization of German football under the Third Reich into sixteen top-flight divisions, "BuEV" became part of the Gauliga Ostpreußen (I). They then joined the Gauliga Danzig (I), a regional division of the Gauliga Ostpreußen, in 1935 and captured a division title there, before losing the overall Gauliga Ostpreußen championship to "Yorck Insterburg" (0:2). The club also made appearances in the early rounds of the Tschammerpokal competition, predecessor to today's DFB-Pokal (German Cup), in 1937 and 1940.
The team played out its existence in the Gauliga Ostpreußen (1938–40) and Gauliga Danzig-Westpreußen (1940–45) as a middling side. "BuEV" disappeared with the end of World War II when the city of Danzig and surrounding territory became part of Poland.

Civil and Civic

Civil and Civic (also 'Civil and Civic Contractors' and 'Civil and Civic Pty Ltd') was an Australian company acquired in 1961 by Lend Lease Corporation.
History.
The Company was originally founded by Dick Dusseldorp in 1951 on behalf of the Dutch building companies "Bredero's Bouwbedrijf" of Utrecht and "The Royal Dutch Harbour Company" as an Australian-based building contractor. Its first contract was to supply and erect 200 prefabricated houses for the Snowy Mountains’ Authority which had been established by William Hudson, engineer of the Snowy Mountains Scheme. Hudson's greatest obstacle in the completion of the scheme was the provision of labour and materials. Without a resolution to these two problems the realisation of the project was doubtful. But 31 year old Dutch immigrant Dick Dusseldorp conceived a plan to prefabricate frames for worker housing in Finland, plumbing in England, ship materials via Cooma and recruit labour from the Netherlands to erect the homes. Dusseldorp established 'Civil and Civic' to take on and manage the multi-million-dollar contract.
Civil and Civic went on to become Australia's leading provider of project management services in the construction industry, delivering a number of landmark projects including Stage I of the Sydney Opera House, Australia's first high-rise (Caltex House), and the world's first high-rise strata title apartment building (Blues Point Tower).
In 1961 Civil and Civic was acquired by Lend Lease Corporation, but the company continued to trade under the Civil and Civic name for some time, also constructing the world's tallest lightweight concrete construction building (Australia Square), and the tallest building in the world outside North America (MLC Centre) at the time of completion.
In 1999 Lend Lease Corporation acquired P&O's Global Project Management Company, Bovis, rebranding the business as Bovis Lend Lease. The Australian operations of Civil and Civic were merged with the new subsidiary, effectively ending the use of the original company name.

Contestants.
Score Card/Elimination Chart
Contestants are in reverse chronological order of elimination.
The elimination is based on two of the lowest scores of the two bottom contestants who than choose to perform once more with their partner (Yaar or Pyaar) on the song they have performed earlier. Then judges decide which contestant has improved and the elimination takes place.
Episodes.
Week 1: July 9 and 10, 2008.
There was no elimination on the first week because it was an introduction when the contestants were introduced.
Week 3: July 23 and 24, 2008.
On Week 3, as usual before the elimination, two contestants from each trio have to perform so judges can decide which trio can stay and which is going to be eliminated. Hiten Tejwani and Nandini Singh performed and were eliminated since the other bottom trio scored higher points.
Week 4: July 30 and 31, 2008.
The week 4 guest appearance was by Nikitin Dheer and Shweta Bharadwaj to promote the movie "Mission Istanbul".
In the July 30 episode, Vishal Singh's jodi got eliminated due to Dimple's forgetting her steps and blanking out on stage. Because of this, the jodi got a low score from judges, especially Ganesh Hegde who gave only 1 score; the trio being eliminated.
Week 5: August 6 and 7, 2008.
Week 5 was different from the other weeks. This time it was bottom 3 instead of bottom 2. Jatin-Priya-Shalini were ousted from the show. Kashmera-Mukul had the worst performance according to Mahesh Bhatt. Mridul's team wants Kashmeera's team to come in finals with them.
Week 6: August 13 and 14, 2008.
Throughout the show, the trio who received the lowest score was eliminated. This week the judges chose Kashmira's team to be in the final despite having the low score because of their good performances throughout the show. Mridul's team was eliminated even after being in the second position this week.
Grand Finale — Week 7: August 20 and 21, 2008.
The grand finale was in week 7, where all the eliminated contestant's once again performed with their partners' on the stage for the last time. The celebrity guests who participated in the finale were Tusshar Kapoor and Rajpal Yadav who also came to promote their forthcoming movie "C Kkompany". 
There were three rounds to the finale: the first was that both of the co-contestants' (yaar and pyaar) had to perform together, the main contestant had to choose from their yaar or pyaar to perform in the second round, and in the last round, the trio had to perform together. Once all three rounds were completed, the score was added, and whichever trio received the highest score was declared as the winner.

In Color (song)

"In Color" is the title of a song co-written and recorded by American country music artist Jamey Johnson. It is the first single from his second album, "That Lonesome Song", which was initially released to digital retailers in 2007, and was released on August 5, 2008 on Mercury Nashville Records. Johnson co-wrote the song with James Otto and Lee Thomas Miller. In January 2009, "In Color" became Johnson's first Top Ten country hit. The song was later included on the compilation album, "Now That's What I Call Country Volume 2", in 2009.
The song won awards for Song of the Year in both the 2008 ACM Awards and the 2009 CMA Awards.
Content.
The song is a largely acoustic ballad centralizing on an elderly man who is showing black-and-white photographs to his grandson, each photograph showing a various part of the man's life. Describing the instances in each photos, such as fighting in World War II, he recalls his own life story to his grandson, telling him, "you should have seen it in color" (i.e., that the grandson would have had to be there himself to know what each experience was truly like). Trace Adkins was originally slated to record the song, until Johnson asked Adkins' permission to record the song himself. Adkins did record the song as an iTunes exclusive bonus track on his 2008 album, "X".
Music video.
A music video was shot for "In Color" in May 2008. It portrays Johnson sitting on a stool, playing acoustic guitar and singing, with various black-and-white photographs (which Johnson borrowed from his grandmother) spread out on the floor around him. Eventually, color begins to sweep across the photos from the outside, working its way in until Jamey himself is also in color.
Reception.
The song received a "thumbs up" rating from Brady Vercher of The 9513. Vercher described the lyrics favorably, saying that they contained "vivid and emotive imagery without becoming overwrought", also saying "production stays out of the way of the vivid stories and adds a richness and expressiveness[…Johnson may not be the most gifted vocalist as far as range goes, but he is more than capable and knows how to interpret a song for good effect. Needless to say, he nails the delivery in this song."
"In Color" won "Song of the Year" at the Academy of Country Music Awards on April 5th, 2009. It was also nominated for Best Male Country Vocal Performance and Best Country Song at the 51st Grammy Awards.
In June 2010, the song was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America.
Chart performance.
"In Color" debuted at number 57 on the Hot Country Songs chart dated April 19, 2008. The song spent a total of 40 weeks as an active single on the country charts, and became the first Top 10 hit of Johnson's career, peaking at number 9 on the week of January 10, 2009. In addition, the song peaked at number 52 on the Billboard Hot 100 the same week.

Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity

Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity, or SMOS, is a satellite which forms part of ESA's Living Planet Programme. It is intended to provide new insights into Earth's water cycle and climate. In addition, it is intended to provide improved weather forecasting and monitoring of snow and ice accumulation.
History.
The project was proposed in November 1998; in 2004 the project passed ESA-phase "C/D" and, after several delays, it was launched on 2 November 2009 from Plesetsk Cosmodrome on a Rockot rocket. The first data from the MIRAS (Microwave Imaging Radiometer using Aperture Synthesis) instrument was received on 20 November 2009. The SMOS programme cost is about €315 million ($465 million; £280 million). It is led by ESA but with significant input from French and Spanish interests.
The satellite is part of ESA's Earth Explorer programme – eight spacecraft that will do innovative science in obtaining data on issues of pressing environmental concern. The first is already in orbit – a mission called GOCE, which is mapping variations in the pull of gravity across the Earth's surface. SMOS is the second Explorer to launch; and a third spacecraft, known as CryoSat-2 (the first CryoSat failed on launch), was launched on 8 April 2010. CryoSat will assess the state of the world's ice cover.
Launcher.
The satellite was launched on 2 November 2009 (04:50 (01:50 GMT)) to a nearly circular orbit of 763 km by a “Rockot”, a modified Russian Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) SS-19 launched from a decommissioned SS-19 launcher from Northern Russia's Plesetsk Cosmodrome. The SMOS satellite was launched together with the Proba-2, a technology demonstration satellite.
Science.
The goal of the SMOS mission is to monitor surface soil moisture with an accuracy of 4% (at 35–50 km spatial resolution). This aspect is managed by the HYDROS project. Project Aquarius will attempt to monitor sea surface salinity with an accuracy of 0.1 psu (10–30 day average and a spatial resolution of 200 km x 200 km).
Soil moisture is an important aspect of climate, and therefore forecasting. Plants transpire water from depths lower than 1 meter in many places and satellites like SMOS can only provide moisture content down to a few centimeters, but using repeated measurements in a day, the satellite can extrapolate soil moisture. The SMOS team of ESA hope to work with farmers around the world, including the United States Department of Agriculture to use as ground-based calibration for models determining soil moisture, as it may help to better understand crop yields over wide regions.
Ocean salinity is crucial to the understanding of the role of the ocean in climate through the global water cycle. Salinity in combination with temperature determine ocean circulation by defining its density and hence thermohaline circulation. Additionally, ocean salinity is one of the variables that regulate CO2 uptake and release and therefore control the oceanic carbon cycle.
Information from SMOS is expected to help improve short and medium-term weather forecasts, and also have practical applications in areas such as agriculture and water resource management. In addition, climate models should benefit from having a more precise picture of the scale and speed of movement of water in the different components of the hydrological cycle.
Instrumentation.
The SMOS satellite carries a new type of instrument called Microwave Imaging Radiometer with Aperture Synthesis (MIRAS). Some eight metres across, it has the look of helicopter rotor blades; the instrument creates images of radiation emitted in the microwave L-band (1.4 GHz). MIRAS will measure changes in the wetness of the land and in the salinity of seawater by observing variations in the natural microwave emission coming up off the surface of the planet.
Operations and ground segment.
The CNES Satellite Operations Ground Segment will operate the spacecraft with telecommunications from ESA's S-band facility located in Kiruna, Sweden. The Data Processing Ground Segment (CDTI, Villafranca, Spain) will process SMOS data through the X-band. Higher level processing of information will be done by scientists globally.

Vasili Kulkov

Vassily Sergeyevich Kulkov (; born 11 June 1966 in Moscow, Soviet Union) is a Russian retired footballer, and a current coach.
Either a central defender or defensive midfielder, he was best known for his spells at Spartak Moscow and Benfica.
Club career.
From 1984 until the end of his career, Kulkov played for a host of clubs in Russia, coming to prominence with hometown's most notably FC Spartak Moscow, from where he left in 1991 for a Portuguese league stint with S.L. Benfica (where he played with countrymen Aleksandr Mostovoi and Sergei Yuran).
In 1994–95, both Kulkov and Yuran joined F.C. Porto, being very important figures in the league's conquest. Aged 29, the former returned to Spartak, only to be immediately shortly after to Milwall in the English second division, where he failed to adjust immensely, appearing very rarely in a six-month loan.
After two years with FC Zenit Saint Petersburg and one at FC Krylia Sovetov Samara, Kulkov returned to Portugal, joining F.C. Alverca – Benfica's feeder club but also in the top flight; he closed out his career with amateurs FC Shatura, aged 35.
Kulkov then had some spells in coaching, notably assisting countryman Anatoliy Byshovets at C.S. Marítimo in 2003. Six years later, he moved to Spartak Moscow's reserves, in the same capacity.
International career.
Kulkov made his debut for the Soviet Union on 26 April 1989, in a 1990 FIFA World Cup qualifier against East Germany.
Despite playing regularly for the national team for several years, he did not participate in any major tournament: in 1990, he was not selected for the final stages in Italy, and missed UEFA Euro 1992 (with CIS) and 1996 due to injury.
Before the 1994 FIFA World Cup, several Russia players, including Kulkov, signed a letter demanding that team manager Pavel Sadyrin resign. The coach did not and the player refused to participate.

List of tallest buildings in Washington, D.C.

This list of tallest buildings in Washington, D.C. ranks high-rises in the U.S. capital city of Washington, D.C. The tallest structure in the city, excluding radio towers, is the Washington Monument, which rises and was completed in 1884. The structure, however, is not generally considered a high-rise building as it does not have successive floors that can be occupied. The tallest habitable building in the city is the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, which rises . The second-tallest building in Washington is the Old Post Office Building, which is high. The third-tallest building in the city is the Washington National Cathedral, which rises above grade. The cathedral is built on high ground known as Mount St. Alban, above sea level, which makes the central tower the "highest" point in the District. As of November 2011, there are 410 completed high-rises in the city. 
History.
Washington's history of skyscrapers began with the completion in 1894 of the 14-story Cairo Hotel, which is considered to be the city's first high-rise. The building rises and 14 floors. Washington went through an early high-rise construction boom from the late 1890s to the mid-1930s, during which time the Old Post Office Building and the Federal Triangle were built. The city then experienced a major building boom from the early 1940s to the late 1990s, during which the city saw the completion of 31 of its 48 tallest buildings, including One Franklin Square and 700 Eleventh Street. However, although the city is home to several high-rises, none are considered to be genuine "skyscrapers"; only two completed buildings surpass . 
The height of buildings in Washington is limited by the Height of Buildings Act. The original Act was passed by Congress in 1899 in response to the 1894 construction of the Cairo Hotel, which is much taller than the majority of buildings in the city. The original act restricted the heights of any type of building in the United States capital city of Washington, D.C., to be no higher than , for residential buildings. In 1910, the 61st United States Congress enacted a new law which raised the overall building height limit to , but restricted building heights to the width of the adjacent street or avenue plus ; thus, a building facing a -wide street could be only tall. However, building heights are measured from the sidewalk or curb to the edge of the roof. Architectural embellishments, mechanical rooms, and common rooftop structures may be exempted from the overall height limit, provided they are setback from the roof line. The heights of buildings listed here may therefore exceed the general height limit as measured for the purpose of the city's zoning laws.
In modern times the skyline remains low and sprawling, keeping with Thomas Jefferson's wishes to make Washington an "American Paris" with "low and convenient" buildings on "light and airy" streets. Washington's height restriction, however, has been assailed as one of the primary reasons why the city has inflated rents, limited affordable housing, and traffic problems as a result of urban sprawl. To escape the District's height restriction, architects wishing to construct higher buildings close to downtown often do so in Rosslyn, Virginia, directly across the Potomac River from Georgetown.
One of the most recently completed buildings in Washington, D.C. is Capitol View, which is high. As of July 2008, there is one high-rise under construction in the city that is expected to rise at least , with one more proposed and one approved for construction. Onyx on First is the only high-rise under construction in Washington; upon completion, it will be the 14th-tallest building in the city. Two other large developments taking place are Square 54 Residential I, which is proposed for construction, and the PNC Bank Building, which is approved. The Square Residential I building at George Washington University is expected to rise to a height of and 14 stories, while the PNC Bank Building is expected to rise to a height of and 12 stories. As of July 2008, there is a total of four high-rise buildings under construction, approved for construction and proposed for construction in Washington.

Luis Franco (writer)

Luis (Leopoldo) Franco (November 15, 1898June 1, 1988) was an autodidact, a self-made intellectual, essayist, and poet. He was the son of Luis Antonio and Balbina Acosta and lived most of his life in his native province far from the limelights of Buenos Aires and the academic world which he sincerely despised in favor of a bucolic and rural setting of his father's cattle farm in Belén. At age seventeen Franco was awarded a literary prize for his "Oda primaveral". Franco traveled a considerable distance to receive the award riding on a mule's back from Catamarca Province to Tucuman. The attitude raised a few eyebrows in Buenos Aires and a relevant article was publish in the prestigious magazine "Caras y caretas" relating the story of this promising young author. The first literary personality to open the doors to Franco was Horacio Quiroga. Quiroga would eventually introduced Franco to Leopoldo Lugones who recognized his talent and potential. Soon Franco became a recognizable name in the literary world of his time making the acquaintance of Roberto Arlt, Gabriela Mistral and Juana de Ibarbourou amongst others. However, Luis Franco found it difficult to coexist with the cultural apparatus and the bourgeois-style of other intellectuals in Buenos Aires, and soon -after completing his High School degree- returned to his hometown of Belén. In Belén, Franco resided most of his adult life doing what he loved most: working the land, reading and writing. As a result of a personal crisis –coincidental with the military coup of general José Evaristo Uriburu in 1930- Franco dissociates himself from right wing revisionists such as Lugones and begins an audacious journey of introspection in the nature of Argentina’s political past. The result is a copious bibliography of essays where the ghost of saints and devils of Argentina’s turbulent 1800’s comes to life in a unique fashion, one that perhaps Franco only shares with Ezequiel Martínez Estrada. 
"Here´s a pagan poet who loves life and sings to life because it finds beauty her delightful expression of love" Leopoldo Lugones, 1923
Soon Franco will emerge as a political writer, one seriously committed to the cause of communism. He was a Marxist of Trotskyite tendencies, co-founder of the political party known as Movimiento al Socialismo (MAS) in 1982. Franco also contributed in the 1950s to the Magazine "Estrategia" next to relevant figures of the local Trotskyite scene such as Perelman, Gallo, Milcíades Peña and Nahuel Moreno. Very much a militant he refused to occupy posts in the university or academic world of the bourgeois which he condemned for its complicity with the system. Luis Franco worked until his very last days in Buenos Aires. Nelson Montes-Bradley recalls meeting the poet at Bar Savoy, a grill in the vicinity of the Congreso: “He was often by himself, writing on a Gloria notebook with his navy blue "bic" ball-pen”. According to his friend Carlos Penelas, Luis Franco died penniless on June 1, 1988 in a nursing home in Ciudadela, Buenos Aires province.

<doc id="18279481" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18279481" title="Citadel of Saigon">
Citadel of Saigon

The Citadel of Saigon ( ) also known as the Citadel of Gia Dinh ( ) was a late 18th-century fortress that stood in Saigon (also known in the 19th century as Gia Dinh, now Ho Chi Minh City), Vietnam from its construction in 1790 until its destruction in February 1859. It was destroyed in a French naval bombardment as part of the colonisation of southern Vietnam which became the French colony of Cochinchina. The citadel was only used once prior to its destruction, when it was captured by Le Van Khoi in 1833 and used in a revolt against Emperor Minh Mạng.
In the late 18th century, the city of Saigon was the subject of warfare between the Tây Sơn Dynasty, which had toppled the Nguyễn lords who ruled southern Vietnam, and Nguyen Anh, the nephew of the last Nguyen lord. The city changed hands multiple times before Nguyen Anh captured the city in 1789. Under the directions of French officers recruited for him, a Vauban style "octagonal" citadel was built in 1790. Thereafter, the Tây Sơn never attacked southern Vietnam again, and the military protection allowed Nguyen Anh to get a foothold in the region. He used this to build an administration and strengthen his forces for a campaign that united Vietnam in 1802, resulting in his coronation as Gia Long.
In 1833, his son Minh Mạng was faced with a rebellion led by Lê Văn Khôi, which started after the tomb of Khôi's father Lê Văn Duyệt was desecrated by imperial officials. The rebels took control of the citadel and the revolt continued until the imperial forces took control of the citadel in 1835. Following the capture of the citadel, Minh Mang ordered its razing and replacement with a smaller square stone-built structure, that was more vulnerable to attacks. On February 17, 1859, the citadel was captured during the French invasion after less than a day of battle and significant amounts of military supplies were seized. Realising that they did not have the capacity to hold the fort against Vietnamese attempts to recapture it, the French razed it with explosives, before withdrawing their troops.
Background.
Until the 17th century, what is now southern Vietnam was not inhabited by ethnic Vietnamese but by Khmer people. What is now central Vietnam had been the seat of the kingdom of Champa, which fought the kingdom of Đại Việt over many centuries. The 1471 Vietnamese conquest of Champa saw the destruction of the Cham capital and heralded the ultimate decline of Champa. The Vietnamese continually expanded south in what is known as the "nam tien" ("southward march"). Central Vietnam was ruled by the Nguyễn lords, who had broken away in the early 17th century from the Trịnh lords, who ruled the north. The Nguyễn continued the southward expansion that eventually saw Vietnamese encroach into what had been Khmer territory in the Mekong Delta. The southern edge of Vietnam, being further away from the Nguyễn power base in the centre, was loosely governed.
In 1771, the Tây Sơn rebellion erupted from Bình Định Province. In 1777, the last of the Nguyễn lords was deposed and killed. His nephew Nguyen Phuc Anh was the most senior member of the Nguyễn family to have survived the Tây Sơn victory and conquest of Saigon in 1777. Nguyễn Ánh fled to Hà Tiên in the far south of the country, where he met Pigneau de Behaine, a French priest who became his adviser and played a large part in his rise to power. Over the next few decades, there were continuous attacks and counterattacks by both sides and Saigon changed hands frequently. Eventually, Nguyễn Ánh was forced him into exile. The Tây Sơn regularly raided the rice growing areas of the south during the harvesting season, confiscating the Nguyễns' supply of food.
In 1788, the Tây Sơn moved north to attack the Trịnh and unite Vietnam. Nguyễn Ánh took advantage of the situation to return to southern Vietnam. After rebuilding his army, he recaptured Saigon on September 7, 1788. His grip on the south was enhanced by a group of Frenchmen and equipment that Pigneau had recruited, although the magnitude of the aid has been the source of dispute.
Having seen Saigon slip from his hands on many occasions in the previous decade, Nguyễn Ánh was keen to strengthen his hold on the key southern city, turning it into his capital, and the base for his preparations for his planned conquest of the Tây Sơn and Vietnam. His enemies had regularly raided the area and confiscated the rice harvest.
Construction.
The French officers recruited by Pigneau were used to train Nguyễn Ánh's armed forces and introduce their technological expertise to the war effort. Olivier de Puymanel was responsible for the construction of fortifications. One of Nguyễn Ánh's first actions was to ask the French officers to design and oversee the construction of a modern European-style citadel in Saigon. The citadel was designed by Theodore Lebrun and de Puymanel and 30,000 people were used to construct it in 1790. The townfolk and their mandarins were heavily taxed for the work, and the labourers were worked to the extent that it provoked a revolt.
First structure.
The stone and earth citadel eventually had a perimeter measuring in a Vauban model. It was described as being of a Chinese style, designed in the octagonal form of a lotus flower, with eight gates in the " Ðại Nam nhất thống chí", the official records of the Nguyen Dynasty. However, such records are believed to have been written metaphorically, rather than literally. Two French maps of the city, drawn by de Puymanel and Jean-Marie Dayot—another senior officer—in 1799 and 1815 respectively, show a square-shaped design, with four main towers at the corners, and six outer half-towers. Louis Malleret said that "it is impossible to see any octagonal design in this".
The design suggested by the French maps is corroborated by the accounts of British and American visitors who travelled to Saigon seeking trade deals for their respective countries in the 1820s. British trade envoy John Crawfurd wrote that "the citadel of Saigon...is, in form, a parallelogram...I conjecture, from appearance, that the longest side of the square may be about three-quarters of a mile in length". George Finlayson, a naturalist and surgeon who travelled to southern Vietnam as a member of a trade delegation from the British East India Company, described the fortress as being "of square form, and each side is about half a mile in extent". Lieutenant John White of the United States Navy, travelling as a trade envoy for the United States, claimed to have seen only four of the eight gates, but Crawfurd wrote that "With the exception of the four principal gateways...the gates consist of four large and as many small ones". The four small gates observed by Crawfurd are in accord with the design principles of Vauban.
The two French maps of the citadel show a Vauban structure, as do the accounts of the trade delegates. According to Crawfurd, "the original plan appears to have been European, but left incomplete. It has a regular glacis, an esplanade, a dry ditch of considerable breadth, and regular ramparts and bastion...The interior is neatly laid out and clean, and presents an appearance of European order and arrangement." Finlayson described the citadel as having been "constructed of late years, on the principles of European fortification. It is furnished with a regular glacis, wet ditch, and a high rampart, and commands the surrounding country." Lebrun and de Puymanel did not choose the site for the citadel, instead using the compound of a fort. The location was seen as ideal for such a purpose. It was of substantial elevation, with three sides bordered by natural waterways at right angles: the Saigon River, Arroyo Chinois and the Arroyo de l'Avalanche. Crawfurd reported that the walls were made of earth that was "covered everywhere with a green sward". White estimated that the height of walls was around . According to Crawfurd, the gateways were built from stone and lime, with the towers being of Chinese architecture with a double-canopied appearance. The approach towards the gates include a zig-zag in the glacis.
The location was in complete fulfilment of the requirements of geomancy, with a north-west/south-east orientation. The three courses of water provided the "vital energy". As three waterways formed right angles, the square structure was the most suitable. The aspect of the citadel closest to a Chinese style was the decoration of the gates, which Finlayson noted as "handsome and ornamented in the Chinese style". White recalled that the gates were reinforced by iron, a style that was common in Europe. The citadel was bordered on three sides by pre-existing waterways, increasing its defensive capacity.
Nguyễn Ánh located his headquarters and palace inside the walls of the citadel. The palace itself was estimated by White to have covered an area of , standing at the centre of the citadel on a green, enclosed by paling. The structure was approximately long and , built from brick and standing on a foundation around above the ground, with a wooden staircase. Each of the four sides of the palace was defended by a watchtower that stood approximately . After Nguyễn Ánh became emperor, he established his capital in Hue, and no longer used the palace, which was used by the governor of the southern region. The administration quarters continued to be used by the provincial mandarins and their paperwork was archived within. A cemetery stood at the western end of the citadel, with prominent mandarins being interred there, while the arsenal was located in the northeast section in six large buildings. Soldiers lived in huts that were built throughout the grounds of the citadel. White estimated that the fort was equipped with around 250 cannons, primarily made of brass.
Impact on the Tây Sơn and the Nguyễn.
Following the construction of the citadel, the Tây Sơn never again attempted to recapture the city—the building gave Nguyen Anh a further psychological advantage over his opponents. The citadel helped to secure the southern region, which allowed Nguyễn Ánh to implement domestic programs to strengthen himself economically in preparation to fight the Tây Sơn. He used the newfound security to undertake agrarian reforms. Due to Tây Sơn naval raids on the rice crop, the area had been suffering long term rice shortages. Although the land was extremely fertile, the region was agriculturally underexploited because it had been occupied by Vietnamese people only relatively recently. Nguyễn Ánh's programs resulted in large amounts of previously idle land being cultivated. Large surpluses of grain, taxable by the state, were generated.
By 1800, the increased agricultural productivity allowed Nguyễn Ánh to support an army of more than 30,000 soldiers and a navy of more than 1,200 vessels. The surplus from the state granary was to used to facilitate the importing of supplies for military purposes. Eventually, Nguyễn Ánh moved northwards and in 1802 he conquered all of Vietnam and became emperor, ruling under the name of Gia Long.
Lê Văn Khôi revolt.
The citadel was not used during the rule of Gia Long and the only military action occurred after his son had ascended the throne as Minh Mạng. Years of tension between the monarch and General Lê Văn Duyệt, the governor of southern Vietnam, came to a head after the death of the latter in 1831. Tension between the pair surfaced when Gia Long made Minh Mang the heir to the throne. Duyet had opposed the succession, favouring the enthronement of a young son of the late Prince Cảnh, the eldest of Gia Long's sons.
After Gia Long's death, Minh Mạng and Duyệt clashed frequently. As the southern governor, Duyet had significant autonomy, as only the centre of Vietnam was under direct royal rule. Duyet was a supporter of Catholic missionaries, while Minh Mạng was a staunch Confucianist. Duyet often disobeyed Minh Mạng's orders, and the emperor attempted to reduce the Duyet's autonomous power, which became easier with the general's death in 1831. The governor's post was abolished and the region was put under direct control.
Following the integration of southern Vietnam into the central administration, newly appointed imperial officials arrived in Saigon. The new mandarins carried out a detailed inquiry into Duyệt's rule and claimed that widespread corruption and abuse of power took place. Bạch Xuân Nguyên, the head of the inquiry, called for Duyet's posthumous prosecution, which resulted in 100 lashes being applied to his grave. Many of Duyệt's subordinates were arrested and 16 of his family members were executed. This action prompted the Duyệt's officials—fearful of their positions and security under the central system—to launch a revolt under the leadership of his adopted son Lê Văn Khôi. Historical opinion is divided with scholars contesting whether the humiliation of Duyệt or the loss of southern autonomy was the main catalyst.
On the night of May 18, 1833, Duyệt's supporters took control of the citadel, executing Nguyên and his subordinates. They then held a torch-lit ceremony at Duyệt's tomb, during which his adopted son Khôi formally rejected the imperial authority of Minh Mang and declared his support for An Hoa, the son of Prince Cảnh. On the same evening, Khoi's men assassinated Nguyen Van Que, the newly appointed Governor-General who was overseeing the integration of the south into the central administration. All of the centrally appointed officials were killed or fled the citadel. Surprise attacks caught the imperial garrisons off guard and within three days, all six southern provinces were in the hands of Khoi's forces. Khoi convinced a French priest named Joseph Marchand to come and stay within the citadel, hoping that his presence would win over support from the local Catholics. Khoi's support of An Hoa was also calculated to gain Catholic support, because Canh had converted to Catholicism. He further called on Catholics to congregate in the citadel under his protection. Vietnamese priests went on to lead Catholic armies in fighting off imperial forces as well providing messengers to communicate with the world outside their besieged citadel.
In mid-1834, the imperial forces managed to finally repel the Siamese invaders and gained the upper hand over the rebels, regaining control of the southern countryside and besieging the rebel fortress. Although Khôi died during the siege in November 1834, the rebels defending the citadel of Saigon held out against imperial troops until September, 1835. The rebel commanders put to death. In all, between 500 and 2,000 citadel defenders were captured and executed, including Marchand.
Second structure.
Following the revolt, Minh Mạng ordered that the citadel be dismantled in 1835. He then ordered that a new citadel be built in its place, which was still square-shaped, but only had four towers. The six outer towers in the original citadel were discarded. The destruction was seen as retribution for its use in the revolt. The new citadel, rebuilt in 1836, was much smaller and was much more susceptible to enfilade bombardment from a nearby waterway. The length of the square sides was , surrounded by high walls, made from granite rocks, brick and earth. The fort was surrounded by deep moats.
French invasion and destruction.
The process of Vietnam's colonisation began in 1858 when a Franco-Spanish force landed at Da Nang in central Vietnam and attempted to proceed to the capital Hue. After becoming tied down, they sailed to the less defended south, targeting Saigon. The southern offensive started on February 10, 1859 with a naval bombardment of Vũng Tàu. Within six days, the Europeans had levelled 12 Vietnamese fortresses and three river barriers. They then sailed along the Saigon River to the mouth of the Citadel of Saigon and opened fire with naval artillery from close range. The fort was manned by 1,000 soldiers and stored enough rice to feed 10,000 defenders for an entire year.
On February 17, 1859, the French warships opened fire on the citadel with artillery. This attack focused on the southeastern corner of the citadel, where most of the Vietnamese artillery had been installed. The Vietnamese artillery commanders had miscalculated and had set up their cannons incorrectly, firing at excessively high angles. The cannons were not easily adjusted and thus the Vietnamese firepower was misdirected and ineffective. At around 10:00, Captain Des Pallieres led 300 French soldiers in an infantry attack. They used bamboo ladders to scale the walls under artillery support from the river. The defenders were caught off guard by this manoevre and many fled in chaos.
Most of the Vietnamese defence personnel were concentrated at the eastern gate of the citadel, where they stubbornly fought off the French. Rigault de Genouilly led 500 French troops in hand-to-hand combat for seven hours, having used explosives to breach the citadel. At 14:00, the French seized control of the citadel. Two hours later, de Genouilly declared the citadel as the new general headquarters of the French forces. The French seized a large arsenal. This included more than 200 cannons, 20,000 hand-held weapons such as firearms, pistols and swords, 100 tons of munitions, 80,000 tons of rice and 130,000 francs in cash. Saltpetre, shot and sulphur were also seized. The Vietnamese material losses were estimated to be around 20 million francs. The citadel commander fled to another village before committing suicide.
The Vietnamese attempted to reclaim the citadel by sending reinforcements. Vĩnh Long and Mỹ Tho sent 1,800 and 800 troops respectively, but French shelling prevented them from reaching the scene. This left the 5,800-strong local self-defence militia to combat the French. These militia engaged in ambushing French patrols near the citadel, as well as evacuating local inhabitants, in order to create an open space close to their target. The local militia were supported by wealthy southern landowners, who supplied them with food and resources.
The French soldiers charged with holding the citadel soon became stretched by the guerrilla attacks on the military installation. De Genouilly had decided to withdraw some of his forces back to central Vietnam. In addition, the inland position of the French forces lessened their technological advantage. As a result, the French decided to evacuate and destroy the fort. This was achieved on March 8. Captain Deroulede used 32 chests of explosives. He also razed the citadel by setting the rice granary ablaze, along with the weapons and munitions. The resulting fire was said to have smoldered for a further three years. The French withdrew to the outskirts of the city, before returning to central Vietnam.

Jha (film critic and author of "The Essential Guide to Bollywood") states: "If you've ever wondered what on earth is on-screen chemistry here's your one-stop all-purpose encyclopedia on celluloid magic. Fasten your 'see'-it belts, as veteran filmmaker Rajkumar Santoshi sheds all his Lajja, and pulls out all stops to do a wacky goofy edgeless weightless comedy of characters who walk in and walk out of frames leaving behind fumes of old-fashioned funnies. Ajab Prem Ki Ghazab Kahani is an airtight trapeze down that familiar romantic lane." Nikhat Kazmi of the "Times of India" gave it four stars out of five and states: "The newly formented Ranbir-Katrina chemistry sets the screen on fire in this mad hatter's tea party. Adding to this is Pritam's peppy music score with Neeraj Shridhar, Atif Aslam, Hard Kaur, Sunidhi Chauhan and Mika raising a toast to high-spirited song and dance and Raj Kumar Santoshi penning some of the funniest dialogues in recent times and you have a great escape awaiting you at your favourite audi this weekend. Go, have a ball." Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film four out of five stars arguing that it "entertains majorly" and that "the romantic moments are endearing. Most importantly, the on-screen chemistry is electrifying. Ranbir and Katrina look great together!" Noyon Jyoti Parasara of AOL India gave 3 out of 5 stars saying, "Its strong point, apart from Ranbir, happens to be its clichéd settings." Omar Qureshi of Zoom gave 3.5 out of five stars saying that "The main point to be noted in the film is that, the film is totally dedicated to love and all the things that are related to love and so, it will leave an ever lasting impression on youth." Minty Tejpal of "Mumbai Mirror" gave 3.5 out of five stars, saying that "It seems that Ranbir Kapoor can do nothing wrong. He is just fantastic through the film."
Mayank Shekhar of the "Hindustan Times" gave one star and said that "The film has no comic bone at all. There is certainly no romance either."

Mount Tabor, , is a mountain east of Prince George, British Columbia, Canada adjacent to BC Highway 97. It rises about from the small portion of the Nechako Plateau that lies in the angle of the Fraser River and not part of the Cariboo Mountains which begin just to the east, the summit is the site of a former fire lookout tower and is the highest piece of relief in the Greater Prince George area (it may also in some reckonings be the northward limit of the Quesnel Highland rather than part of the plateau).
The highest summit of a generally north-striking ridge between Prince George and the lowland of the Willow River, its summit has about 550m of relief from the surrounding terrain; Tabor Lake at its foot to the west is in elevation. As such, it has become the site of the small Tabor Mountain Ski Resort, which is one of Prince George's two local ski hills, the other being the small Hart Highlands Alpine Park on the north side of the city. East of the Willow River and just beyond the Bowron River, forty kilometres farther east, is Mount Purden, the site of Purden Ski Village and which is the northernmost summit of the Cariboo Mountains.

Goodbye, 20th Century!

Goodbye, 20th Century! () is a 1998 Macedonian film directed by Darko Mitrevski and Aleksandar Popovski.
Plot.
"Goodbye, 20th Century!" consists of three stories of extreme violence and emotional despair. The first takes place in the year 2019, where the world has become an environment of apocalyptic wreckage and ruin. A man named Kuzman is sentenced to death by a nomadic tribe, but their attempts to fatally shoot the condemned man are a failure. Fated to live forever, Kuzman wanders the wasteland until he encounters an enigmatic figure who offers him information on how he can escape eternal life.
The second story is a three-minute segment that takes place in 1900. Presented as a record of the first wedding ceremony ever captured on film, the scene devolves into violence when it is discovered the newlyweds are actually brother and sister.
The third story takes place on New Year’s Eve 1999. A man dressed as Santa Claus returns to his apartment building, where a wake is in session. The solemn mourning degenerates into violence while the sounds of the Sid Vicious punk rock rendition of "My Way" floods the proceedings.
U.S. release.
"Goodbye, 20th Century!" was Macedonia's submission to the 71st Academy Awards for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but was not among the five finalists to achieve the Oscar nomination.
The film had its U.S. premiere at 1999 Cinequest Film Festival in San Jose, California. The same year, it played in the first annual B-Movie Film Festival in Syracuse, New York, where it won awards for Best Editing and Best Set Design.
"Goodbye, 20th Century!" had a brief theatrical release later in 1999, where it received mixed reviews. Dennis Harvey, writing for "Variety", stated "the film's pacing is uneven, tone and intent often unclear, but the visually stylish "Goodbye, 20th Century!" is memorable for sheer idiosyncrasy alone." Robert Firsching, reviewing the film for the Amazing World of Cult Movies, praised the film as "an impressionistic howl of rage and despair from a country which has lived on the brink of war for years, a nightmare without beginning or end. One gets the feeling that it has driven everyone concerned a bit mad, and that is where "Goodbye 20th Century!" succeeds the most: without showing a single glimpse of actual Balkan fighting, it portrays the horror and insanity of the conflict in a way that a mere war film would be hard-pressed to achieve."
However, MaryAnn Johanson, writing for The Flick Filosopher, said the film "feels like it was made by a couple of precocious 13-year-old boys obsessed with incest and bullets and splattering blood. This is strictly for those who like their science fiction with a lot of style but very little substance." And James Berardinelli, writing for Reel Views, complained that "Popovski and Mitrevski seem to relish making their movie as off-the-wall as possible, and, while the result may grant them satisfaction, it is likely to have the opposite effect on those who find themselves in a theater watching the final product."
"Goodbye 20th Century!" was released in the U.S. on VHS video, but to date there has been no DVD release.

Gridino, Yegoryevsky District, Moscow Oblast

Gridino () is a village in Yegoryevsky District of Moscow Oblast, Russia, located on the Shuvoyka River (Guslitsa River's tributary), in the historical area of Guslitsa. Informally, the village is also known as Gridino-Shuvoye (). Municipally, the village is a part of Shuvoyskoye Rural Settlement (the administrative center of which is the settlement of Shuvoye). Postal code: 140301. Dialing code: +7 49640.
The village was first mentioned in 1673.
Our Lady of Kazan Church.
The first wooden temple in honor of Our Lady of Kazan was built in the village in 1673. In 1864, after it burned down, a new wooden temple was constructed in its place. The new temple was in service until 1959, when it was disassembled and its logs used to build a kindergarten in the nearby village of Selivanikha. On the opening day, however, the kindergarten building completely burned down.
New stone Russian Orthodox Church was consecrated in place of the old wooden one on September 18, 1999.
Spring and Our Lady of Kazan Icon Chapel near the Shuvoyka.
A well, consisting of three small springs, is located on the left bank of the Shuvoyka River, from the river and south of the western extremity of the village (at )
The springs are believed to have appeared during the Polish invasion in the beginning of the 17th century. According to legends, when some of the Poles and their followers stood at the place of the current Yegoryevsk, where False Dmitry was later defeated by prince Dmitry Pozharsky, on the bank of the Shuvoyka River the Russian troops fought one of the Polish detachments. Both sides have suffered severe losses, and the blood that was shed led to the appearance of the icon of Our Lady of Kazan and the three springs. Later on, in 1673, a small wooden chapel was built on the high bank of the river in 1673; it was later re-built after the fire of 1864 and completely dismantled for construction materials during the anti-religious campaign in 1966.
For over three centuries, the place had remained popular among the pilgrims. In the early 1970s, there was an unsuccessful attempt to carry out reclamation work.
Currently, a small chapel and a sign explaining the appearance of the Our Lady of Kazan Icon are located near the springs.

2008 United States salmonellosis outbreak

The 2008 United States salmonellosis outbreak began in the spring of 2008 when hundreds of people throughout the United States fell ill after consuming contaminated food. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration currently believes that the contaminated food products responsible are fresh jalapeño and serrano peppers from Mexico, and perhaps raw tomatoes. Fresh cilantro is also under investigation. The FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention narrowed their investigation to certain farms in Mexico that they believed were responsible for the contaminated produce.
Salmonellosis.
From April 10 to July 31, 2008, the rare Saintpaul serotype of "Salmonella enterica" caused at least 1329 cases of salmonellosis food poisoning in 43 states throughout the United States and in the District of Columbia. It was the largest reported salmonellosis outbreak in the United States since 1985. New Mexico and Texas were proportionally the hardest hit, with 56.9 and 21.3 reported cases per million, respectively. The greatest number of reported cases have occurred in Texas (508 reported cases), New Mexico (112), Illinois (116), and Arizona (57). Some other significantly impacted states include Maryland, Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas, and Nevada which have been collectively affected by 118 reported cases. All of the above-mentioned states suffered more than five reported cases per million. Additionally, five cases were reported in residents of Canada, four of whom appeared to have been infected after traveling to the United States.
There were at least 257 reported hospitalizations linked to the outbreak, leading to at least one death, and the outbreak may have been a contributing factor in at least one additional death. The CDC maintains that "it is likely many more illnesses have occurred than those reported." If applying a previous CDC estimated ratio of non-reported salmonellosis cases to reported cases (38.6:1), one would arrive at an estimated 52,826 illnesses from this outbreak, and 173 estimated cases per million throughout the United States.
Type of contaminated food.
Based on an initial case control study, the FDA and the CDC had maintained that the "Salmonella" was spread through raw tomatoes. The study showed that more than 80 percent of infected case subjects recalled consuming "fresh, raw tomatoes" or foods that may have contained fresh tomatoes. Only around 68 percent of control subjects recalled consuming the same. According to James Prevor, Editor of "Produce Business", the extended period of new onsets of salmonellosis precludes the possibility that a specific tomato crop could be solely responsible for the outbreak. That leaves the possibilities open that multiple tomato crops (possibly in different areas) were somehow concomitantly contaminated at various points of origin, multiple crops from the same area were contaminated by a single environmental factor (such as the water supply), contamination of tomatoes from various crops has been occurring at a central location along the distribution chain (such as during repacking), or some food other than tomato is responsible for the outbreak. According to Dr. Douglas Powell, Director of the International Food Safety Network, possible suspects aside from tomatoes include salsa, jalapeño peppers, green onions, and cilantro.
Throughout the end of June and beginning of July, the FDA has been changing its position regarding the source or sources of the "Salmonella". It first admitted the possibility that foods "commonly consumed with tomatoes" might be possible suspects in the outbreak, though it declined to elaborate with specifics. Days later, it commented on specific suspects aside from fresh tomatoes: fresh serrano peppers, fresh cilantro, fresh bulb onions, fresh scallions, and fresh jalapeño peppers. The FDA still maintained, however, that tomatoes were the prime suspect. A couple of days later, the FDA began to focus on jalapeño peppers above other non-tomato suspects. Most recently, the FDA has disclosed that jalapeño peppers are now the main suspects in the outbreak, and that "the accumulated data from all investigations indicate that jalapeño peppers caused some illnesses but that they do not explain all illnesses." It has narrowed its list of suspects to fresh jalapeño peppers, raw tomatoes, fresh serrano peppers, and fresh cilantro. The FDA now maintains with confidence that tomatoes are not responsible for at least some of the illnesses. The CDC has stated that some illness clusters involved people who were certain that they ate foods with jalapeño peppers but not tomatoes, and other clusters were vice-versa. The CDC considers it most likely that contaminated tomatoes, jalapeños, and serrano peppers have all been responsible for the outbreak.
According to the FDA, types of tomatoes likely affected with "Salmonella" include red plum, red Roma, and round red tomatoes. The FDA writes that "types of tomatoes not linked to any illnesses are cherry tomatoes, grape tomatoes, and tomatoes with the vine still attached," and the CDC agrees that these types of tomatoes are "not the likely source of this outbreak." The FDA website provides a list of areas from which it has deemed tomato farms not to be the source of the outbreak.
On July 18, 2008, the FDA lifted its warnings regarding tomato consumption, given that hardly any tomatoes from winter crops are still in circulation. On July 21, after discovering a single contaminated pepper in a load imported from Mexico, the FDA recommended that consumers throughout the United States avoid eating any fresh jalapeño peppers, regardless of the source. On July 25, the FDA announced that American grown peppers are not considered a risk to consumers. On July 30, the after tracing the outbreak strain to a Mexican farm, the FDA revised its recommendations again and warned all consumers to avoid jalapeño and serrano peppers from Mexico. People who would be in the most danger if infected with "Salmonella" (infants, the elderly, and those with compromised immune systems), should be especially careful to avoid eating fresh jalapeño and serrano peppers from Mexico.
Source of the contamination.
As of July 31, 2008, the CDC has sent 39 people into the field to work with other health officials in investigating the outbreak. The exact sources of the contaminated food are not yet known. The time frame of the outbreak had led the FDA to suspect that a source or sources of the outbreak may be among tomato farms producing winter crops in either of the following areas:
As of July 31, the latest reported illness onset occurred on July 12, and the latest estimated illness onset occurred on July 25. Illness onsets well into July suggest that fresh winter tomatoes are not the only source of the outbreak. In response to the continuing progression of illness onset dates, the CDC has proposed that a contaminated farm might have switched from tomato production to jalapeño production in the middle of the outbreak, causing crops of both types of foods to become contaminated. Jalapeño peppers, a food strongly suspected in the outbreak by the FDA, are primarily grown throughout Mexico, Texas, and New Mexico.
Contaminated pepper samples.
On July 21, 2008, the FDA released a notice that the outbreak strain of "Salmonella" Saintpaul was found on a sample of jalapeño pepper from the McAllen, Texas produce importer/distributor Agricola Zaragoza, Inc. Agricola Zaragoza is a small distributor with only $600,000 in annual sales and three employees. It distributes only jalapeños and tomatillos, the latter of which is not a suspect in the outbreak. No other samples, swabs, or tests taken at the facility have tested positive for "Salmonella".
The contaminated pepper sample in question was imported from Mexico, and it is from a load that had been distributed to Texas and Georgia beginning on June 30. No other peppers from the same load have yet been found to be contaminated. The means by which the pepper became contaminated is unknown. Between June 30 and July 12, there have been approximately 40 reported new illness onsets, representing three percent of total reported illness onsets. The number of illnesses thought to be associated with Mexican peppers from Agricola Zaragoza is undisclosed. Peppers from that distributor are the main suspects in an illness cluster involving a restaurant in Minnesota.
On July 29, a jalapeño pepper bought at a Wal-Mart in Montezuma County, Colorado, tested positive for the outbreak strain of "Salmonella". Brian Grubbs, a Colorado man who was hospitalized for salmonellosis, is suing Wal-Mart for allegedly selling him contaminated peppers that got him sick in early July.
On July 30, the FDA announced that it found samples of the outbreak strain of "Salmonella" in samples of serrano peppers and groundwater at a Mexican farm in Nuevo León. That same farm also supplied jalapeños to a packing facility in Mexico that did business with Agricola Zaragoza. Mexico's Agriculture Ministry is protesting the findings of the FDA, claiming that a soil sample was taken after the harvest and was not "scientifically valid."
A different farm in Tamaulipas actually supplied the contaminated peppers found at Agricola Zaragoza. Results from FDA samples taken at that farm are pending, and Mexican investigators have already found "Salmonella" on samples taken in Tamaulipas.
Health officials have not yet indicated any positive "Salmonella" cultures from other samples (aside from a load of basil from Mexico and loads of jalapeño and serrano peppers imported from Mexico, none of which were found to be contaminated with the particular strain of "Salmonella" responsible for the outbreak).
Tracebacks.
The FDA has posted on its website that "the agency has been able to trace the pathway of some tomatoes from the point of purchase (e.g. supermarket) or consumption (e.g. restaurant) to each point on the distribution chain down to certain farms in Mexico and Florida." In a press conference on June 20, the FDA elaborated: "What the traceback has done is take us back to a number of different farms in Florida and in Mexico... e've got several farms in both Florida and Mexico and those are the places along with their associated distribution chain that we are going to be getting into as quickly as possible." At the very same press conference, however, the FDA also stated: "Right now all of the traceback data that we have point to this being Mexico or Florida. Currently we do not believe it's both."
Notably, the FDA states that "there's no clear indication that there's any obvious crossover point" where tomatoes from both Mexico and Florida could have been contaminated at the same place. Dismissing the possibility of coincidence of outbreaks from two independent distribution chains as "very unlikely from a natural perspective," the FDA also insists that there is "nothing to suggest that this poisoning outbreak is deliberate." The FDA expects to find that the contaminated tomatoes have been coming from only one area. This expectation is based in part on the FDA's consultations with the United States Department of Agriculture and the United States Department of Homeland Security, neither of which support the conclusion that tomatoes were deliberately poisoned.
The FDA now thinks that tomatoes are responsible for only part of the outbreak, at most. The agency is no longer advising caution regarding tomato consumption, given that winter tomatoes are generally no longer in circulation.
Criticism of the FDA.
James Prevor, Editor of "Produce Business", has criticized the FDA for maintaining a list of areas where crops "have not been associated with the outbreak," because if tomatoes have in fact been contaminated elsewhere along the supply line, the FDA's list of safe farm areas would be inappropriate and misleading to consumers. Charles H. Bronson, Agriculture Commissioner of the State of Florida, also indicated that repacking could be responsible for "Salmonella" contamination. Bronson said that there is a "99.99 percent" chance that the Florida tomato farms are not the source of the "Salmonella" outbreak.
Prevor has also criticized the FDA for refusing to disclose data on whether subjects generally recalled eating suspected foods from restaurants or from retail stores: "Retail and restaurants often have completely different products with a completely different supply chain." For example, mature green winter tomatoes, which are primarily distributed to the foodservice market, are dominated by Florida producers. Vine ripe winter tomatoes, which are distributed to both the foodservice and retail markets, usually come from Mexican producers. "All this information is not confidential," Prevor writes concerning data on the origins of purchase. "There is no reason not to release it." At least three Mexican restaurants (two Adobo Grills and one Los Tres Amigos) in Illinois have been publicly identified by the Chicago Department of Public Health and the Madison County Health Department as responsible for clusters of the outbreak, despite the FDA's nondisclosure stance. According to unnamed sources close to the investigation, most illness clusters in the outbreak involve Mexican restaurants.
Earlier in the investigation, some produce industry insiders expressed doubt that fresh produce is to blame for the outbreak. They pointed to the absence of Salmonella on all of the tested produce samples to date, as well as divergent results from produce tracebacks. They also said that the extended time frame of new sicknesses made it unlikely that either raw tomatoes or fresh jalapeños, the government's two main suspects, could be solely responsible. Some have looked to cross-contamination at restaurants as a more probable cause of the outbreak. Contaminated foods such as raw chicken could have spread the "Salmonella" to fresh salsa at restaurants. Customers would not have become ill from contaminated chicken once it was cooked, but they might have become ill from the raw produce that had contacted raw chicken.
Others suggested that processed foods such as canned tomatoes and canned jalapeños might have been responsible for the outbreak. Health officials generally do not consider processed foods high-risk suspects in food outbreaks, as the canning and bottling processes are supposed to kill any bacteria. Nevertheless, the FDA and the CDC were surprised in 2007 by outbreaks from "Salmonella" contamination in pasteurized peanut butter and from "Clostridium botulinum" contamination in improperly pasteurized canned chili. Will Steele, President and CEO of Frontera Produce, said that "the outbreak is probably related to processed goods and FDA is looking in the wrong closets."
The FDA's recommendation that consumers stop eating any fresh jalapeños, regardless of their origin, has elicited more disapproval from the produce industry. Criticism of the FDA's decision comes on the grounds that there was only a solitary positive sample among numerous negative samples both at the distribution facility and at many other farms and facilities. Additionally, Agricola Zaragoza is a small distributor that imports from a known source in Mexico and distributes peppers to limited parts of the country. Four days after making the recommendation not to eat any fresh jalapeños, the FDA announced that peppers grown in the United States are indeed safe to eat.

Marta Becket

Marta Becket (born Martha Beckett on August 9, 1924) is a retired actress, dancer, choreographer and painter who performed for more than four decades at her own theater, the Amargosa Opera House in Death Valley Junction, California. "Amargosa" (2000), Todd Robinson's documentary about Marta Becket won a 2003 Emmy Award for cinematographer Curt Apduhan, in addition to the film's numerous festival awards and nominations.
Becket on Broadway.
Becket began ballet lessons at age 14, which eventually led to performances as a ballerina. She was in the corps de ballet at Radio City Music Hall and on Broadway she appeared in "Show Boat", "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn" and "Wonderful Town". Later, she took her one-woman show across the country, performing in small theaters and school auditoriums. She married in 1962, and she was on her way with her husband to an engagement in 1967 when, due to a flat tire, she discovered a theater in Death Valley Junction and decided to stay.
From Borax to ballet.
The theater was part of a company town designed by architect Alexander Hamilton McCulloch and constructed in 1923–25 by the Pacific Coast Borax Company. The U-shaped complex of Mexican Colonial-style adobe buildings included company offices, a store, a dorm, a 23-room hotel, dining room, lobby and employees' headquarters. At the northeast end of the complex was a recreation hall used as a community center for dances, church services, movies, funerals and town meetings.
Becket rented the recreation hall, then known as Corkhill Hall, began repairs and changed the name to the Amargosa Opera House. In 1970, journalists from "National Geographic" discovered Becket doing a performance at the Amargosa Opera House without an audience. Their profile and another in "Life" led to an international interest in Becket and her theater. She began performing to visitors from around the world, including such notables as Ray Bradbury and Red Skelton.
In recent years, Becket dropped the dancing to perform weekly "The Sitting Down Show". Becket ceased performing in her Amargosa Opera House at the end of the 2008-09 season but began performing again in 2010. Her final show was February 12, 2012.
Becket has occupied the theater since 1968 and personally created the murals and sets. The performances have been the sole source of income for both the Opera House (now owned by Marta's non-profit organization) and the entire town.
Books.
Her autobiography, "To Dance on Sands: The Life and Art of Death Valley's Marta Becket", was published in 2007.
For the book "Star Performance: The Story of the World's Great Ballerinas", by Walter Terry (Doubleday, 1956), Becket did 42 full-page illustrations, plus ten smaller illustrations for the glossary.

GPR182 (or G protein-coupled receptor 182) is a human gene (and associated protein) which is an orphan G-protein coupled receptor.
When this gene was first cloned, it was proposed to encode an adrenomedullin receptor. However when the corresponding protein was expressed, it was found not to respond to adrenomedullin (ADM).
It was subsequently shown that a different GPCR, CALCRL when complexed with RAMP2 can function as an ADM receptor.

The Amazing Maleeni

"The Amazing Maleeni" is the eighth episode of the seventh season of the science fiction television series "The X-Files". It premiered on the Fox network in the United States on January 16, 2000. It was written by Vince Gilligan, John Shiban, and Frank Spotnitz and directed by Thomas J. Wright. The episode is a "Monster-of-the-Week" story, unconnected to the series' wider mythology. "The Amazing Maleeni" earned a Nielsen household rating of 9.4, being watched by 16.18 million people in its initial broadcast. The episode received mixed reviews.
The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. In this episode, The Amazing Maleeni, a small-time magician, performs an amazing feat to impress a heckler—he turns his head 360 degrees. So when he is later found without a head at all, Mulder and Scully arrive on the case and discover an angry ex-con, an unimpressed rival, and Maleeni’s twin brother. All seem to have something to do with a plan to rob a major bank.
Although written by Gilligan, Shiban, and Spotnitz, the story for "The Amazing Maleeni" was conceived largely by executive producer Frank Spotnitz, who had wanted to do an episode dealing with "magic and illusion" since the show's second season. Real-life magician Ricky Jay, who also was Spotnitz's favorite, was brought in to play the part of the titular Maleeni.
Plot.
A magician, The Amazing Maleeni, twists his head completely around at a carnival, while Billy LaBonge, another magician, heckles Maleeni during the event. As he's leaving, his severed head falls completely off. Billy LaBonge is later questioned by Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson); he tells the agents that he thought Maleeni was a ripoff. During the autopsy, Scully finds that, although Maleeni's head was cleanly cut off, he died of a heart attack. She also finds that he was dead for at least a month and refrigerated, even though the carnival manager spoke to him mere moments leading up to his head falling off.
Meanwhile, LaBonge finds a man named Cissy Alvarez who Maleeni owed money. LaBonge admits that he caused Maleeni's head to fall off, and says that he will give Alvarez the money he is owed if he helps him with his magic. Mulder and Scully learn that Maleeni has an identical twin brother, Albert. Albert, interestingly enough is even wearing a neckbrace, which he says he got in a car accident in Mexico. Mulder tells him he thinks he did the magic act, but the man shows that he has no legs, which he also lost in Mexico in the car accident. Back at work, Alvarez threatens Pinchbeck that he will kill him if he does not get his money. LaBonge then frames Alvarez for a robbery by attacking a security truck disguised as Alvarez. Mulder soon finds out that Pinchbeck is the real Maleeni and that he faked having no legs. After confronting Pinchbeck, he admits that he faked his own death in order to get out of Alvarez's debt. Pinchbeck admits that he found his brother dead of a heart attack at home and used his body as a double. Pinchbeck is promptly arrested, as is LaBonge, who brings a gun to a bar, in an attempt to purposely get arrested. In addition, Alvarez is arrested because of the attempted robbery LaBonge did earlier.
The vault at Pinchbeck's work is emptied and the money is found above Alvarez' bar. Later Mulder and Scully confront LaBonge and Maleeni as they are released on bail, where Mulder explains that he figured out their plan - LaBonge and Pinchbeck were not, in fact, enemies, and that they had been working together to put Alvarez in prison for making LaBonge's life miserable in prison 8 years prior, and that, as masters of sleight of hand and escape tricks, the two of them easily escaped, performed the robbery, and returned to their cells before being noticed.
After the two magicians make their exit, confident in the lack of evidence against them, Mulder reveals to Scully the true trick being performed—that everything involving Alvarez was purely misdirection. Earlier, when checking whether Pinchbeck had stolen funds from the bank, the manager had told Mulder they would need his badge number and thumb print to gain access to the Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT) system. Mulder shows Scully Maleeni's wallet, which he had collected from evidence before confronting him and LaBonge. When the agents first met LaBonge, he had surreptitiously pickpocketed their badges as an example of his skill with sleight of hand, which gave him Mulder's badge number. Upon their first meeting with Pinchbeck impersonating his brother, Pinchbeck did a card trick with Mulder, leaving Mulder's prints on the card, which as Mulder displays, is securely in Maleeni's wallet. Mulder explains that the pair purposely acted in a high profile manner to draw the attention of the FBI, and that if they had collected the badge number and thumbprint, they would have been able to perform EFTs. As Mulder and Scully leave the jail, Scully shows that she, too, has learned a trick, and turns both of her hands around 360 degrees in a similar fashion as LaBonge had done with one hand before. Mulder asks Scully to explain how, and she brushes him off, saying simply "magic".
Production.
Writing.
The idea behind "The Amazing Maleeni" started with executive producer Frank Spotnitz. When pitching ideas for the seventh season episodes, Spotnitz wanted an episode to deal solely on "magic and illusion" and have nothing to do with the paranormal. Spotnitz had been petitioning the writers of "The X-Files" for a magic-based episode since season two, but nothing ever came to light. Eventually, during the seventh season, Vince Gilligan was assigned to write the episode, something he describes as "agony". Gilligan explained, "The episode started with Frank, because he—for several years—had wanted to write an episode about magicians. Frank was a fan of the TV show "The Magician" with Bill Bixby so I believe that was part of it, but Frank was interested in the idea of magic and the idea of fooling people who wished to be fooled."
Spotnitz's favorite magician was Ricky Jay, and so, for the episode, Jay was brought in to play the part of The Amazing Maleeni. Initially, however, the episode hit a snag. The production crew discovered that Jay's production agency had not been informed and that he would be unable to guest star in the episode. The staff's back-up magician, David Blaine, was unavailable for shooting as well. Series creator Chris Carter, however, later stated that the show would not take no for an answer: "We got on the phone with him. He agreed to come to our offices to talk about the script and ended up doing some card tricks for us that reduced Frank and I to being six-year-olds again." Jay eventually agreed to do the part, but requested that he only do the tricks he was accustomed to doing. Thus, many of Jay's trademark tricks were included in the episode's script. Gilligan, in retrospect, later noted, "There was no choice other than Ricky Jay as far as we were concerned. He was not looking forward to the idea of playing a magician because I think he felt that magicians were never portrayed very realistically in movies or television shows."
The cast and crew of the episode enjoyed the "amusement park" feel of the story. Gillian Anderson later noted, "Because of all the magic, I was constantly being entertained. The difficulty with something like this is you have tendency to forget that people are still having bad things happen to them." Anderson later stated that, because many of the lines were written in a tongue-in-cheek style, she and David Duchovny said them in a humorous style; the two had to keep reminding themselves that the story revolved around a murder.
Special effects.
The episode used several special effects. However, in order to ensure that the episode felt "camera-real" to preserve the theme of magic and illusions, many of the more intense effects were replaced with more conventional effects. For instance, the scene wherein Bill LaBonge's hand erupted into flames was created through the use of stunt man, rather than through expensive and, ultimately, "less convincing" CGI effects. The scene featuring The Amazing Maleeni turning his head 360 degrees was created using a prosthetic head, courtesy of John Vulich's Optic Nerve Studios.
Broadcast and reception.
"The Amazing Maleeni" first aired in the United States on January 16, 2000. This episode earned a Nielsen rating of 9.4, with a 14 share, meaning that roughly 9.4 percent of all television-equipped households, and 14 percent of households watching television, were tuned in to the episode. It was viewed by 16.18 million viewers. The episode aired in the United Kingdom and Ireland on Sky1 on May 7, 2000 and received 0.79 million viewers, making it the fourth most watched episode that week.
The episode received mixed reviews from critics. Kenneth Silber from Space.com was critical of the episode's intricacy, writing, "'The Amazing Maleeni' is a convoluted episode that ultimately lacks verve and excitement. Even if one can figure out what is going on, there remains the question of how much, or even whether, to care." Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book "Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen", rated it two stars out of five. The two noted that, had the episode used real magic tricks instead of "resortto CGI, the episode would have been much more than a simple "cheat". Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson criticized the fact that the explanation behind Maleeni turning his head around 360 degrees was never satisfactorily explained. Paula Vitaris from "Cinefantastique" gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris compared the episode's plot to the 1999 movie "Arlington Road", noting that while "the scheme is fun to watch while it unfolds, [… in the end, it's not credible; too much is left open to chance for it really to happen."
Not all reviews were so critical. Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed awarded the episode 4 out of 5 stars. Although he noted that the episode was "not Gilligan's best work" and that the writing was "a little spotty", he said "the vibe 'The Amazing Maleeni' is very well done." Tom Kessenich, in his book "Examinations", gave the episode a moderately positive review, writing "My heart wasn't racing and I wasn't sitting on the edge of my seat as Mulder and Scully unmasked our two magicians […] But it was fun to put the clues together to see what it all added up to." Zack Handlen of "The A.V. Club" awarded the episode a "B+" and wrote that he "love it". He praised the episode's "good-naturedness", which he felt was due to Mulder and Scully's interaction. Handlen also enjoyed the writing, noting that the "script also does a good job at doling out its secrets in a way that never makes either the magicians or our heroes come off as idiots". Paul Spragg of Xposé wrote positively of the episode, describing it as a "rather fun tale".

Political divisions of Mindanao

[[Image:Mindanao regions.PNG|right|thumb|A map of Mindanao color-coded by regions.
For the exclaves, see the text.]]
The southern island of Mindanao in the Philippines is divided into six administrative regions. Each region is subdivided into provinces.
Zamboanga Peninsula (Region 9).
Zamboanga Peninsula (Region IX), formerly Western Mindanao, is located in the landform of the same name. It consists of the provinces of Zamboanga del Norte, Zamboanga del Sur, Zamboanga Sibugay, and five cities—Zamboanga City;Pagadian City Isabela City Dapitan City and Dipolog City —which are independent of any province. Isabela City is the only territory not on Mindanao island itself and is a part of Basilan. The region's administrative capital is Zamboanga City and the whole region used to be a single province named Zamboanga.
Northern Mindanao (Region 10).
Northern Mindanao (Region X) consists of the provinces of Bukidnon, Camiguin, Lanao del Norte, Misamis Occidental, Misamis Oriental, Cagayan de Oro City, and Iligan City. The province of Camiguin is also an island just of the northern coast. The administrative center and capital of the region is Cagayan de Oro City.
Davao Region (Region 11).
Davao Region (Region XI), formerly Southern Mindanao, is located in the southeastern portion of Mindanao. The region is divided into the provinces of Davao Oriental, Davao del Norte, Davao del Sur, and Compostela Valley; plus Davao City. The region encloses the Davao Gulf to the south and includes the island of Samal in the gulf, and the Sarangani Islands further to the south. Davao City is the region's administrative center.
SOCCSKSARGEN (Region 12).
SOCCSKSARGEN (Region XII), formerly Central Mindanao, is located in the south-central portion of the island. It consists of the provinces of Cotabato, Sarangani, South Cotabato (which was used to be part of Region XI), and Sultan Kudarat, plus Cotabato City. The names of the provinces together with General Santos City spell the name of the region which is an acronym. Cotabato City, which is surrounded by, but is not a part of Maguindanao province, was the region's former administrative center. Koronadal City, in South Cotabato, is the new administrative center of the newly formed region.
Caraga Region (Region 13).
Caraga (Region XIII) is located in the northwestern part of Mindano. Its provinces are Agusan del Norte, Agusan del Sur, Surigao del Norte, and Surigao del Sur. The administrative center is Butuan City in Agusan del Norte. The region also covers the outlying islands of Surigao del Norte such as Dinagat Island, Siargao Island, and Bucas Grande Island.
Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM).
The Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) is a special region which covers the territories predominantly populated by Muslims. ARMM has its own government unlike almost all the other regions in the country. It consists of almost the whole of the Sulu Archipelago (Isabela City while remaining a part of Basilan is in the Zamboanga Peninsula region) and two provinces in the mainland. The provinces located in the Sulu Archipelago are Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi. Basilan and Tawi-Tawi are themselves the main islands of their respective provinces, while the main island of Sulu is Jolo Island. The mainland provinces are Lanao del Sur and Maguindanao. Cotabato City, while not a part of the ARMM, is the region's administrative center.

Lepechinia calycina

Lepechinia calycina is a species of flowering plant in the mint family known by the common name 'Pitcher Sage' or 'Woodbalm.' It is endemic to California, where it is a common plant in several different habitat types, including the chaparral plant community.
Description.
"Lepechinia calycina" is an aromatic shrub with parts of its bark covered in long hairs, some of which have resin glands in them. The leaves are lance-shaped to roughly oval and are sometimes toothed along the edges. 
The shrub flowers in loose raceme inflorescences. Each flower is encased in a cuplike calyx of sepals which are green when new and age to reddish purple. The somewhat cylindrical corolla of the flower is white to light lavender and is rolled back at the tip into four small lips and one longer lip. The tiny fruit develops within the sepal cup after the flower falls. The fruit is rounded, dark in color, and slightly hairy.
Uses.
The Miwok, a Native American group of California, used an extract of the leaves of this plant to treat fever and headache.

Roslyn Grist Mill

The Roslyn Grist Mill is located along Old Northern Boulevard in Roslyn, New York, United States. It was built sometime before the mid-18th century and is one of the few surviving Dutch colonial commercial frame buildings in the U.S. Added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986, it is currently being restored for use as a museum.
Building.
The -story rectangular mill is long by wide. The original timber framing, which uses a series of transverse post and beam bents connected by sills and wall plates, differing from the traditional European grid pattern, is now covered in weatherboard. A -story wing is located to the west, above the race. A mill pond, incorporated into the Roslyn Village Historic District unlike the actual mill itself, is to the north, its outlet eventually feeding into Long Island Sound.
The ground floor has, in the past, been dropped about below street level, due to the effect of tides and renovations on its footings. A hook-and-pulley double plank door is located in the center of the attic. Windows are irregularly located since many have been either added over time or boarded over. Some of the original milling equipment, mainly gears was still located inside as of 1986.
History.
A gristmill has existed on the site since the first decade of the 18th century, when John Robeson built on it. He in turn sold it to Jeremiah Williams, who is believed to have built the current mill sometime between 1715 and 1741. After another owner, it became the property of Hendrick Onderdonk, who already operated two paper mills in the settlement then known as Hempstead Harbor, in 1758.
He ran the mill profitably, and hosted George Washington, who mentions the mill in his diary, on a 1790 visit to the area. The Onderdonk family sold it in 1801 to Daniel Hoogland and Abraham Coles. They sold in 1849 to Joseph Hicks, whose family continued to operate it as a mill until 1916, when they converted it into a tea house and museum. That use continued until 1975, when the Nassau County parks department took it over.
21st-century restoration.
During the county's ownership, the building remained vacant. No use or new tenant could be found, and it continued to deteriorate.
In the 2000s, Roslyn citizens got the county to begin restoration efforts that are eventually expected to cost $2 million, funded by the county, village, and matching contributions from the community. As part of the project, the mill will be brought back up to street level. When the work is complete, the county will transfer title to the village, which will let the Roslyn Landmark Society operate it as a museum of the water-powered industries like Onderdonk's that once were so numerous in the village.

Oriya morphology

Oriya morphology is the identification, analysis and description of the structure of morphemes and other units of meaning in the Oriya language. Morphemes (called ରୁପିମ in Oriya and pronounced Rüpémë) are the smallest units of the Oriya language that carry and convey a unique meaning and is grammatically appropriate. A morpheme in Oriya (Termed as: ରୁପିମ) is the most minuscule meaningful constituent which combines and synthesizes the phonemes into a meaningful expression through its (morpheme's) form & structure. Thus, in essence, the morpheme is a structural combination of phonemes in Oriya. In other words, in Oriya language, the morpheme is a combination of sounds that possess and convey a meaning. A morpheme is not necessarily a meaningful word in Oriya. In Oriya, every morpheme is either a "base" or an "affix" (prefix or a suffix).
The combination of one or multiple morphemes lead to construction of a word. Morphemes are the smallest units of sentence analysis (Syntax) and include root words, prefixes, suffixes, and verb endings.
The current approach to Oriya morphology treat morphology and morphemes as the basic rules involving the linguistic context, rather than as isolated pieces of linguistic matter. In context of semantics (Analysis of Meaning), the approach is that:
1. Meaning is linked to segmented phonological units, with influences of tone and/or stress;<br>
2. Meaning of a morpheme with a given form varies on account of its immediate usage environment.
General analysis.
The existence and span of rules of morphemes in a language depend on the "morphology" in that particular language. In a language having greater morphology, a word would have an internal compositional structure in terms of word-pieces (i.e. free morphemes - Bases) and those would also possess bound morphemes like affixes. Such a morpheme-rich language is termed as Synthetic language. To the contrary, an isolating language uses independent words and in turn, the words lack internal structure. A synthetic language tends to employ affixes and internal modification of roots (i.e. free morphemes - Bases) for the same purpose of expressing additional meanings.
Oriya language is a moderately Synthetic language. It contains definite synthetic features, such as the bound morphemes mark tense, number (plurality), gender etc. However, though Oriya language has a larger number of derivational affixes, it has virtually no inflectional morphology.
Derivational synthesis in Oriya morphology.
Oriya morphemes of different types (nouns, verbs, affixes, etc.) combine to create new words.
Relational synthesis in Oriya morphology.
In relationally synthesized Oriya words, base morphemes (root words) join with bound morphemes to express grammatical function.
Oriya language has a tendency for commonly used words to have a 2:1 morpheme-word ratio i.e. on an average; there are 2 morphemes in a single word. Because of this tendency, Oriya is said to "possess morphology" since almost each used word has an internal compositional structure in terms morphemes. In Oriya language, generally, separate words are used to express syntactic relationships which imparts an isolating tendency, while using inflectional morphology could have made the language more synthetic.
Oriya morphemes.
The basics of Oriya morphology are largely derived from Sanskrit. Thus, Morpheme-based morphology in Oriya essentially follows Sanskrit rules. Ancient Sanskrit grammarian Pāṇini in Astadhyayi has defined a morpheme (termed पद: Pronounced: pada) as under:
"सूप्तिऩ्ग ऩा पदम्" (IAST:Sup ting na padam). <br>
सूप् (‘Sup’) or तीऩ्ग (‘Ting’) create a पद (pada) i.e. a word.
Thus, ‘sup’ and ‘ting’ are morphemes. Since Oriya grammar follows rules of Sanskrit grammar, the structurally dissected form of a ‘pada’ is the also the morpheme (termed as Rupeme) in Oriya language. Some examples are as under:
Examples:
Base Morpheme: /ଘର/ (Pronounced: ghara; meaning: house)
Phonetic Components: <br>
Morphological Components:
/ଘରକୁ/ = / ଘର/ + /କୁ/ <br>
<br>
Base Morpheme: /ହାତ/ (Pronounced: hāta; meaning: hand)
Morphological Components/Derivatives:
/ହାତୀ/ = / ହାତ/ + /ଈ/ [ଈ = ଅଛି] <br>
/ହାତିଆ/ = / ହାତ/ + /ଇଆ/ [ଇଆ = ପରିମାଣ] <br>
Components of a morpheme.
There are several components of a morpheme in Oriya language. There are as follows:
Base: A morpheme that imparts meaning on a word.
Derivational Morpheme: These morphemes alter and/or modify the meaning of the word and may create a whole new word.
Allomorphs: These are different phonetic forms or variations of a morpheme. The final morphemes in several words are pronounced differently, but they all signify plurality.
Homonyms: are morphemes that are spelled the similarly but have different meanings. Such examples abound Oriya grammar and are termed as similarly pronounced words (ସେମାଚଚାରିତ ଶବ୍ଦ). "Examples: "
ଜୀ??ନ (life) and ଜୀ??ନ (water), ହରି(Lord Vishnu) and ହରି (Monkey).
Homophones: These are morphemes that sound alike but have different meanings and spellings. "Examples:"
ସିତ (Black colour), ସୀତ (Plough head).
Classification.
Morphemes in Oriya language may be classified, on the basis of word formation, characteristics into the following types:
Types of morphemes.
1. Free morpheme (ମୁକ୍ତ ରୁପିମ).
Independent meaningful units are free morphemes. These are elemental words. Free morpheme can stand alone as a word without help of another morpheme. It does not need anything attached to it to make a word.
ରାତି ବିତାଇଲା = ରାତି(େର) ବିତାଇଲା: ଅଧିକରଣ
2. Bound morphemes (ଆବଧ୍ଧ ରୁପିମ).
Units which are not independent words but convey meaning on account of their usage on combination are bound morphemes. A bound morpheme is a sound or a combination of sounds that cannot stand on its own as a meaningful word. Most of the bound morphemes in Oriya language are ‘affixes’. An affix is a morpheme that may come at the beginning (Termed as Prefix) or the end (Termed as Suffix) of a base morpheme.
In Oriya, prefixes are bound morphemes are affixes that come before a base morpheme. For example:
/ଉପନଦୀ/ = /ଉପ/ + /ନଦୀ/
/ଅପରୂପ/ = /ଅପ/ + /ରୂପ/
A suffix is an affix that comes after a base morpheme. Example of suffix Bound Morphemes are:
/ବୀରତ??/ = /ବୀର/ + /ତ/
/ନିସୃୃତ/ = / ନିଃ/ + /କୃତ/
/ତା/, /ତ/, /ଇକା/ are bound morphemes used suffixes.
/ସାଧୁ/, /ବୀର/, /କାମ/ etc. are ‘complete bound morphemes’ /ତା/, /ତ??/, /ଇକା/ etc. are ‘dissected or partial bound morphemes’.
The free morphemes carry a fixed meaning while the bound morphemes exhibit large scale variations in meanings. The variable and changing meanings of the bound morphemes impart diversity to word meanings and enrich the language.
3. Complex or combined morphemes.
In a complex morpheme, multiple free morphemes are combined to form a word and impart meaning. More than one Stem Morphemes create a complex morpheme.
Noun + Noun:
/ରଂଗ ମଂଚ/ = / ରଂଗ / + /ମଂଚ/
Adjective + Noun:
Noun + Adjective:
Adjective + Adjective: 
4. Mixed morphemes.
Where both free and bound morphemes combine to form another morpheme, the result is called a mixed morpheme. The mixed morpheme may result from the following combinations:
/ମଣିଷପଣ/ is a complex morpheme while /ଇଆ/ is a bound morpheme.
Inflectional morphemes can only be suffixes. An inflectional morpheme creates a change in the function of the word. Example, /ଇଲା/ with /ଖା/, giving rise to /ଖାଇଲା/, indicates past tense. Oriya has innumerable inflectional morphemes, unlike only seven in English Language. Among others, these include the following:
In Oriya morphology, there are no adjective and adverb inflections like the comparative (-er) and superlative (-est) of English language. Instead, bound morphemes like /ଠାରୁ/ and /ରୁ/, and free morphemes like /ଅେପ??/, /ତୁଳନାେର/ etc. are used.
5. Marker morphemes.
In linguistics, a marker is a morpheme, mostly bound, that indicates the grammatical function of the target (marked) word or sentence. In a language like Oriya with isolating language tendencies, it is possible to express syntactic information via separate grammatical words instead via morphology (with bound morphemes). Therefore, the marker morphemes are easily distinguished.
Verb morphemes.
Verb roots (Kriya Dhatu) can take Krudant (Krit + Anta: Krit ending) transformation and function as morphemes. Therefore, the verb morphemes are termed as Krudant.
Verb Morpheme can be either continuous morphemes or perfect morphemes on the basis of tense.
Verb continuous morphemes:
Verb perfect morphemes:
Sub-morphemes.
Sub-morphemes are metamorphosis of actual morphemes. Sub-morphemes are also called complementary morphemes or meta-morphemes. Sub-morphemes may arise on account of changes in number of noun morphemes or tense of verb morphemes or gender of noun morphemes, as under:
a. Number:
/େଗାଟିଏ/ + /ଘର/ = /େଗାଟିଏ ଘର/ One + House = A House
/ଗୁଡିଏ/ + /ଘର/ = / ଗୁଡିଏ ଘର/ Many + House = Many Houses
/ଅେନକ/ + /େଲାକ/ = /େଲାେକ/ Sub Morphme: /ଏ /
b. Tense:
The sub-morphemes are different appearances of a morpheme at different tense. For instance, the present perfect morpheme in Oriya is: /ଇଲା/
However, the present perfect sub-morpheme of /ଇଲା/ is /ଲା/. For instance:
/ପା/ + /ଇଲା/ = /ପାଇଲା/
are normal usage of /ଇଲା/.
However, the sub-morpheme is:
/େଦ/ + /ଲା/ = /େଦଲା/
c. Gender:
Difference between morphemes, words and syllables in Oriya.
Even though morphemes combine to create a word in Oriya, the morphemes are not always independent words. Some single morphemes are words while other words are composed of two or more morphemes.
In Oriya, morphemes are also different from syllables. Many words have two or more syllables but only one morpheme. For example:<br>
କୁକକର, ଉପଦ????, ମୋ'ର are examples. On the other hand, many words have two morphemes and only one syllable; examples include ଧନି, ମୋଟା etc.

Dark triad

The dark triad is a group of three personality traits: narcissism, Machiavellianism and psychopathy. The use of the term "dark" reflects the perception that these traits have interpersonally aversive qualities:
The dark triad may refer to these traits at only a subclinical level. All three traits have been associated with a callous-manipulative interpersonal style. Jakobwitz and Egan carried out a factor analysis and found "agreeableness" strongly dissociated with these traits, and other factors, such as neuroticism and a lack of conscientiousness, associated with some traits. However, it has been suggested that agreeableness is not relevant to the core of the dark triad, and that instead the common variance is accounted for by callousness and manipulation. In other words, once callousness and manipulation are accounted for, the dark triad characteristics are unrelated to each other.
History.
Research on each of the traits represented in the dark triad began in isolation from one another. The concept of Machiavellianism dates back to the 16th century, psychopathy to the 19th century, and narcissism to the era of Sigmund Freud. Psychopathy, like narcissism, is a concept rooted in clinical and abnormal psychology. By contrast, Machiavellianism was first proposed as a personality trait.
In 1998, McHoskey, Worzel, and Szyarto claimed that Machiavellianism is nothing more than a mild form of psychopathy: aside from their relative severity, there is no difference between them. Delroy L. Paulhus and McHoskey debated these perspectives at a subsequent American Psychological Association (APA) conference, inspiring research by Paulhus and Kevin M. Williams on the dark triad. Paulhus and Williams found enough behavioral, personality, and cognitive differences between the traits to suggest that they were different from each other; however, they concluded that further research was needed to elucidate how and why they overlap.
Subclinical dimensions vs. disorders.
Two dark triad traits, narcissism and psychopathy, were initially proposed as explanations for observed clinical disorders. Narcissism was discussed in the writings of Sigmund Freud, and psychopathy as a clinical diagnosis was addressed in the early writings of Hervey Cleckley in 1941 with the publication of "The Mask of Sanity.
With respect to empirical research, psychopathy was not formally studied until the 1960s and 1970s with the pioneering efforts of Robert Hare, in his Psychopathy Checklist (PCL) and its revision (PCL-R). Hare notes in his book, "Without Conscience" that asking psychopaths to self-report on psychologically important matters does not necessarily provide accurate or unbiased data. However, recent efforts have been made to study psychopathy in the dimensional realm using self-reported instruments, as with the Levenson Primary and Secondary Psychopathy Scales, The Psychopathic Personality Inventory, and the Self-Report Psychopathy Scale.
Similarly, narcissism lacked a means of assessing the disorder outside of clinical interviews, until the popular "Narcissistic Personality Inventory" was created by Raskin and Hall in 1979. Since the NPI, several other measures have emerged which attempt to provide self-report alternatives for personality disorder assessment. In addition, new instruments have been developed to study "pathological" narcissism as opposed to "grandiose" narcissism, which is what many argue the NPI measures.
Given the dimensional model of narcissism and psychopathy, complemented by self-report assessments that are appropriate for the general population, these traits can now be studied at the subclinical level. Although some argue that the term "subclinical" simply means that the characteristic is a less severe version of the syndrome, others have argued that "subclinical" means that the characteristic does not interfere with day-to-day life in a way that would warrant diagnosis or intervention (e.g. treatment or imprisonment).
Machiavellianism has never been referenced in any version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) for psychological disorders. It has been treated as strictly a personality construct. The original published versions of the Mach-IV and Mach-V scales are still the most widely used in empirical research.
Perspectives.
As a disorder.
In general, researchers treat these traits as pathological, something that needs to be treated, and inherently undesirable, e.g. socially condemned or personally counter-productive. However, some argue that this view of the traits is the result of researchers having an implicit group selection orientation towards personality traits.
Research on the dark triad indicate correlations with aggression, racism, and bullying for evidence of the aversive nature of these traits.
As mating strategy.
It has been suggested that the dark triad traits appear to predispose individuals to short-term rewards and relationships over long-term rewards and benefits. Although advanced societies attempt to promote long-term thinking (environmental protection, saving money for retirement), there are reproductive benefits for the individual for thinking and acting on a shorter time-course.
Consistent with this perspective, studies have suggested that on average, those who exhibit the dark triad of personality traits have an accelerated mating strategy, reporting more sex partners, more favorable attitudes towards casual sex, lowered standards in their short-term mates, a tendency to steal or poach mates from others, more risk-taking in the form of substance abuse, a tendency to prefer immediate but smaller amounts of money over delayed but larger amounts of money, limited self-control and greater incidence of ADHD symptoms and a pragmatic and game-playing love style. These traits have been identified as part of a fast life strategy that appears to be enacted by an exploitative, opportunistic, and protean approach to life in general and at work.
However, the research pertaining to the dark triad as a mating strategy is based almost exclusively on college students, which limits generalizability, although it does have the benefit of selecting a group at what would evolutionarily be the prime mating ages. Also, research has suggested empirical inconsistency, including a lack of empirical evidence for reproductive success in the case of psychopathy. Additionally, using established measures of the dark triad, these traits are not universally short-term-oriented nor are they all impulsive. Furthermore, much of the research reported pertaining to the dark triad cited in the above paragraph is based on statistical procedures that erroneously assume the dark triad are a single construct, in spite of genetic and meta-analytic evidence to the contrary. Readers are especially cautioned against drawing conclusions based on research that (a) is solely represented by student samples while claiming to study evolutionary or mating research, and (b) rely only on self-report data when analyzing personality traits often characterized by interpersonal deception. 
Similar concepts.
The "dark tetrad" comprises subclinical sadism, psychopathy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism. There is presently renewed interest in studying subclinical sadism as a personality trait.

Eater (Fear Itself)

Eater is the fifth episode of the NBC horror anthology "Fear Itself", similar to the 2001 episode of the UK's "Channel 5" "Urban Gothic" of the same name. 
Both are based on the Peter Crowther short story of the same name.
Plot.
Elisabeth Moss plays Bannerman, a "boot", or newly recruited police officer. Bannerman is part of a detail guarding Mellor, a Cajun serial killer and cannibal nicknamed "Eater” (because one of his crimes involved him torturing, butchering, and eating a young woman while she was still alive). As the night wears on, she begins to recognize that her all-male colleague's behavior is getting stranger by the minute and that they are being killed one-by-one. Bannerman later finds out that the “Eater” has been using black magic all along and that he was hoping to use it on her to make her free him and then kill her afterwards.
He gets his wish by having stolen Bannerman’s keys in an earlier confrontation between the two and he begins to hunt for Bannerman. Meanwhile, Bannerman is on the run and tries to look for an exit but they are all locked or blocked off. Instead she devises a plan, and, while hiding from the Mellor in a broom closet, she ingests rat poison and calls out to the “Eater”. As Bannerman and Mellor have an epic fight, she gets a pair of handcuffs on both of them. Mellor becomes enraged and begins to chow down on her. She manages to kill the “Eater” because she had ingested rat poison earlier and because of this, Mellor also gets poisoned and cries out in a fit of rage; “You killed me, bitch! You killed me!” and both Bannerman and Mellor die.
We can notice that agent Danny Bannerman was reading a magazine named " (Dance of the Dead)"

Kol Menachem

Kol Menachem is a non-profit independent Chabad publishing house based in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, founded by philanthropist Meyer Gutnick and Rabbi Chaim Miller in 2000. Its goal is "to organize the teachings of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson and make them universally accessible and useful."
The Gutnick Edition "Chumash".
Rabbi Chaim Miller wrote a "Chumash" with a translation that incorporates Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson's "novel interpretation" of Rashi's commentary, which was delivered in a series of public talks at Farbrengens that began in 1964 and continued for more than 25 years, Many of which were printed in Likutei Sichot. The translation, called "The Gutnick Edition "Chumash"" after its sponsor, Meyer Gutnick, was published in a bilingual Hebrew-English edition that includes a running commentary anthologized from classic rabbinic texts. also includes the "haftarot", mystical insights called "Sparks of "Chassidus"", a summary of the "mitzvot" found in each "Parashah" according to "Sefer ha-Chinuch", an essay on public reading of the Torah, and summary charts. It was Kol Menachem's first publication.
According to Miller's foreword, unlike most other translations, the Gutnick edition does not intersperse transliterations among the translations; this is intended to make the text more reader-friendly. However, the translation does includes Rashi’s commentary in parentheses, and the foreword explains that these are Rashi’s words and not a translation of the "chumash". 
In November 2002, the first volume of The Gutnick Edition Chumash was released. The inaugural issue published was Shemot, to coordinate with the then-current Torah readings. The publication of the 5-volume series was completed in 2006.
According to Rabbi Gutnick, the Chumash is perfect for those who are learning Chassidus for the first time, or who have never been exposed to formal Torah study. It is written in easy to understand English, making it understandable by people of all ages and backgrounds. And adds much for beginners to Chumash study (like the audience at Chabad houses across the world) and those familiar with the text.
The series is reported to have been quite successful: "The public reception was so overwhelming that the Kol Menachem staff was inspired to work 14-hour days to finish the project. ... Can you imagine how it feels to have phone calls, letters and emails flying in all day from people whose lives have literally been changed by the Chumash and are begging for more? For many thousands of people, it was their first exposure to the Rebbe’s teachings. Others tell us how it has enabled them to bring Torah study into their busy lives, and it has even inspired many to become baalei teshuvah. So we just had to pull out all the stops to get this project finished.”
Kol Menachem Haggadah.
In 2008 the Slager edition of the Haggadah was released by Kol Menachem, in two versions: according to the liturgy of "Nusach Ashkenaz" as well as "Nusach Ari". The Kol Menachem commentaries are essays on the Haggadah written by Rabbi Schneerson and culled from his voluminous public addresses, then adapted into English. Each commentary is identified and fully annotated. In addition, the volume also incorporates an English question-and-answer running commentary by Rabbi Chaim Miller, integrating many classic commentators.
In 2009 The Kol Menachem Haggadah won the Benjamin Franklin award from the Independent Book Publishers Association.
Other projects.
Kol Menachem has released a book of Haftarot with commentaries from the Rebbe. It was released in November 2006.
Kol Menachem has begun a series on Maimonides' Thirteen Principles of Faith, which draws “from over 100 classic texts such as Talmud, Midrash, Jewish Philosophy, Halachic codes and the works of Kabbalah and Chassidus (with special emphasis on the teachings of the Lubavitcher Rebbe)." These teachings have been anthologized into a series of 28 lessons. 446 pages. 
Kol Menachem has begun the Leviev edition of the Gutnick Chumash, which is a rendition of the Gutnick Chumash in Hebrew sponsored by philanthropist Lev Leviev. Thus far, the books of Bereshit, Shemot Vayikra and Devarim have been released.
Kol Menachem has launched an online classroom for Jews on the go. "Torah in Ten" provides insightful conversations on the weekly Torah portion. The class includes interesting commentaries from renowned historical figures as well as modern views, in addition to thought provoking and inspiring questions. Torah in Ten takes place every week, for ten minutes.
The class is facilitated by Kol Menachem's Editor in Chief, Rabbi Chaim Miller.

Ellenberger's father was an iron worker, and he has a twin brother named Joe, also an MMA fighter, who had a record of 10-0 before being diagnosed with an extremely rare blood disease called Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria when he was 24 years old. Some estimates are that roughly half of the people diagnosed with PNH die within 10 years of their diagnosis. Joe still corners his brother's fights and is a huge inspiration for Jake. Jake and Joe were both very athletic growing up; Jake was on the swimming and diving team in high school, while Joe wrestled and played football. By the time Joe Ellenberger was in his senior year, he had won a Nebraska state title. Joe then went on to wrestle at the University of Nebraska-Kearney and became a two-time Division II All-American, finishing third in the country twice, as well as being a three-time academic All-American. Jake began training for MMA when he saw his friend fight in the Victory Fighting Championships welterweight title. Jake attended the University of Nebraska at Omaha for three years, and was on the school's Division II wrestling team. Ellenberger later became the school's assistant wrestling coach when they won back to back National titles and he also studied psychology. Jake Ellenberger is also a former Marine.

Jan Borluut

Jan Borluut (ca. 1250 - murdered, Ghent, before 1306) was a patrician from Ghent.
Jan Borluut was born into a rich patrician family of wool merchants, members of which continuously held magistrate positions in the city of Ghent from the 13th to the 16th century.
After committing manslaughter in a feud with another patrician, he was banned (killing another opponent in the process), on the 11 July 1302 he commanded a band of outcasts from Ghent against the French at the Battle of the Golden Spurs, led by the famous Jan Breydel de Groeninghe
At a later, undetermined time he was killed in Ghent by his opponents.
He was related to Elisabeth Borluut, who, together with her husband Joos Vijdt, commissioned the creation of the famous "Ghent Altarpiece"(1432), which now resides in the 'baptist chapel' from the Saint Bavo Cathedral in Ghent
On the façade of a romanesque manor located at the 'Korenmarkt' in Ghent, also called the 'Borluutsteen', you can see the family crest: three running deer.

That that is is that that is not is not is that it it is

That that is is that that is not is not is that it it is is an English word sequence demonstrating lexical ambiguity. It is used as an example illustrating the importance of proper punctuation.
The sequence can be understood as either of two sequences, each with four discrete sentences, by adding punctuation:
This relates a simple philosophical proverb in the style of Parmenides that all that is, is, and that anything that does not exist does not. The phrase was first noted in "Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable".
A similar sequence, consisting of only one sentence and no punctuation, is:
Which can be made clearer by the use of synonyms and punctuation:
The part enclosed in the quotation marks is true: it essentially says that what does not exist is not the same as what exists. The phrase as a whole then rightly notes, that a statement claiming that the part enclosed in the quotation marks is false, is itself incorrect.
There is a slightly longer construct following a similar pattern:
Another similar sequence, consisting of three graphic sentences and punctuation:
Meaning: Saying that something exists is stating that "that same thing is nonexistent" is false.

Swami Shivom Tirtha

Swami Shivom Tirth Maharaj (1924–2008) was a noted guru of the Tirtha lineage of Siddha Yoga. Born in a small village in Punjabi Gujarat in present-day Pakistan, his name before he entered the life of renunciation "(sannyas)" was Om Prakash. 
He completed his undergraduate degree at Lahore and lived a householder's life for many years, relocating on the Indian side of the border with his wife and family at the time of independence and partition in the late 1940s. After coming in contact with Swami Vishnu Tirtha he entered the path of spirituality, living with the guru as a disciple. Initially he was assigned everyday work in the Ashram but over time he became the favored disciple who would inherit the lineage. In 1959, when his Guru Ji made him a celibate (brahmachari), he took the name Bramchari Shivom Prakash. 
Brahmchari Shivom Prakash took formal sannyas diksha from Swami Narayan Tirtha of Kashi in 1963, becoming Swami Shivom Tirtha. After that he took care of the Yog Shri Peeth Ashram in Rishikesh and Narayan Kuti Ashram in Devas, Madhya Pradesh.
In his later years Swami Shivom Tirtha gave up his public life, left the ashram and started living in an isolated place near Indore, with two celibate disciples, writing many books. He gave up his earthly body on April 6,2008 at Coimbtore: his body being committed to the Ganges at Rishikesh.

<doc id="18281588" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18281588" title="Old Perth Technical School">
Old Perth Technical School

The 1910 Perth Technical School building is located at 137 St Georges Terrace, Perth, Western Australia, adjacent to the Old Perth Boys School building, which had served as part of the school's former temporary premises since opening of classes there on 16 May 1900.
A restrained and incomplete example of the Federation Free Medieval architectural style, designed by government architect Hillson Beasley, this is one of the few examples of the style surviving in central Perth.
Built form.
The building is a three-level red-brick structure with limestone footings and Donnybrook stone trimmings. There is a square tower, originally intended to be central, with castellated parapets. The interiors exhibit fine craftsmanship in joinery, with jarrah timber panelling and art nouveau leadlighting and glass. A grand staircase of jarrah connects the three levels of the building.
History.
The site of the former Perth Technical School was, in the early years of the Swan River Colony, part of the holding of Henry Willey Reveley. Plans show the manner in which Reveley's mill and spring-fed mill pond were linked by an ingenious mill-race down the steep slope to Bazaar Terrace (now Mounts Bay Road), along the Perth foreshore. 
In May 1900, the Perth Technical School opened in the Old Perth Boys School building in St Georges Terrace, with courses available to both boys and girls. The curriculum included chemistry, assaying, engineering, art and design, woodwork and metalwork. With the unexpected death of the superintendent of technical education, Alex Purdie, in 1905, his successor, Frank Allen, who was also director of the Kalgoorlie School of Mines, improved the makeshift facilities in which students had initially been forced to work with an impressive purpose-built technical school, which opened in 1910. Its motto "Truth, Beauty and Utility", emblazoned above the front entry, expressed the era’s high hopes for technical education. Allen also extended the curriculum to include blacksmithing, carpentry, engine-driving, fitting and turning, plumbing, commercial studies, pharmacy and surveying. The buildings were designed by the chief architect of the Public Works Department (1905–1917), Hillson Beasley (who also designed the Government House ballroom (1899), Western Australian Parliament House (1900), Claremont Teacher Training College (1902), Perth Modern School (1909–11), Midland Courthouse (1907), Fremantle Post Office (1907) and Fremantle Technical College annexe (1910)). Beasley is noted for his 'blood and bandages' style of red-brick public architecture.
Perth Technical School was the venue for the first tertiary educational activity in the state. In 1905, The University of Adelaide formally affiliated itself to allow the school's students to sit for undergraduate examinations in mathematics, physics, science, chemistry, geology, mineralogy and botany. In 1908, a biology course was implemented qualifying for the first-year B.Sc. programme. Various degree courses continued to be provided under licence from Adelaide University until the University of Western Australia was established in 1914. 
The name "Perth Technical College" began to be used in 1929. From demand arising in the 1930s depression years, the college wanted to organise courses for the School of Mines Diploma, but lacked the resources and equipment needed for a full first-year course. However, priorities changed in 1939 because of World War II, and the long-sought arrival of federal funding ushered in a new era of building and resources. Mining students ingeniously adapted the building's tower with strategically aligned trapdoors which, when opened, allowed creation of a vertical shaft akin to a mine. The technical college later became part of the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) programme and several other substantial neighbouring buildings were built or adapted to accommodate disciplines such as art and refrigeration. The college site extended southward from St Georges Terrace to Mounts Bay Road. Its facilities were increasingly supplemented by other campuses including the former boys' school in James Street, where the college principal's office was located in the 1980s.
Notable alumni.
Many significant people have studied at Perth Technical College, such as Sir Walter James, 5th Premier of Western Australia (1902 to 1904); Sir Billy Mackie Snedden, 17th Attorney-General of Australia, 23rd Treasurer and Leader of the Opposition; architect William G. Bennett; town planner Margaret Feilman; pioneer aviator Sir Norman Brearley; and businessmen Sir James Cruthers; and Sir Lance Brisbane. Speech pathologist Lionel Logue taught at the school from 1910 to 1911.
Redevelopment progress.
Proposed demolition of all buildings on the St Georges Terrace site was announced in 1985 by a state government agency, the WA Development Corporation, with the extraordinary support of the National Trust (WA), to facilitate major redevelopment tenders. However, premier Brian Burke was persuaded to order preservation of the 1910 building (only), following a public campaign waged by a pressure-group, "the Castle Keepers". In February 1985, the large site (including the various other college buildings) was valued at $19 million.
In 1986 Laurie Connell and Alan Bond, through his Bond Corporation, both bought 25% stakes in a larger amalgamated site which included Newspaper House, the Royal Insurance Building, and the 1890s WA Trustee Co building, in partnership with the State Superannuation Board. The consortium paid $33.5 million for the site. Two years later, the site was sold to Kerry Packer and Warren Anderson, who paid $270 million and had grand plans to build on what they called Westralia Square.
In the early 1990s, plans for a $2-billion development by Indonesia's Samma Group fell through. Anderson later left the project, with Packer selling his Westralia Square investment in 2003 for $19 million, taking a loss of more than $200 million on the deal. The purchaser was a partnership of Multiplex and Ric Stowe.
In 2008 the City of Perth granted approval to Multiplex for the construction of a 46-storey tower block on the site for BHP Billiton. The approval included strict conditions on maintaining the heritage values of the buildings along St Georges Terrace, including Newspaper House, the Royal Insurance Building, the 1890s WA Trustee Co building and the Old Perth Technical School.
In October 2010, the four heritage buildings were advertised for lease as "heritage office space" and described as "meticulously restored" as part of the City Square development, which was completed in 2012 and renamed Brookfield Place. The developer, then known as Brookfield Multiplex, recycled the Old Perth Technical School and other heritage buildings in a "heritage-minded development" which included a complex of non-conforming contemporary-design stairways to provide direct street-front access to tenants.
Heritage value.
The 1910 Perth Technical School building was entered into the Register of the National Estate by the Australian Heritage Commission on 18 April 1989 and was classified by the National Trust (WA) on 14 June 2004. The building is also included on the City of Perth's Municipal Inventory and was interim listed on the State Register of Heritage Places on 9 January 1998.

Theodor von Dusch

Theodor von Dusch (September 17, 1824 - 1890) was a German physician who was the native of Karlsruhe. He was the son of Baden statesman Alexander von Dusch (1789-1876).
He studied medicine at the University of Heidelberg, where he had as instructors Jacob Henle (1809-1895), Karl von Pfeufer (1806-1869) and Maximilian Joseph von Chelius (1794-1876). He earned his doctorate in 1847, and was habilitated for medicine in 1854. In 1870 he became professor and director of the policlinic at Heidelberg.
In the 1850s, with Heinrich Schröder (1810-1885), he demonstrated that a filter made of cotton-wool was effective in removing microbes such as bacteria from air. Dusch was the author of influential works involving thrombosis of cerebral sinuses ("Über Hirnsinusthrombose"), heart disease ("Lehrbuch der Herzkrankheiten") and diseases of the endocardium and myocardium ("Krankheiten des Endo-u. Myocardium"). The latter work was included in Carl Gerhardt's "Handbuch der Kinderkrankheiten" (Textbook of Childhood Diseases).

Chimeras (album)

Chimeras (sub-titled "A Child’s Adventures in the Realms of the Unreal") is an album of contemporary classical music by American composer John Zorn featuring a 12 part piece inspired by Arnold Schoenberg's atonal composition "Pierrot Lunaire". In 2010 the album was revised and re-recorded, with an additional "Postlude". 
Reception.
The Allmusic site awarded the album 3½ stars. 
Writing for Pitchfork Media, Alexander Lloyd Linhardt stated "the piece itself is thrillingly diverse, suddenly going from luminous to lugubrious and from classical to chaotic. It's a bold, unexpected new chapter in Zorn's corpus, or it would be if we didn't expect that from him".
The Free Jazz Collective stated "it can be described as an absolute musical nightmare. It is dark, frightening, with light touches beaming through, like a lullaby arising out of violence, like a tiny light in the darkness giving you false hope of rescue, like friendly faces turning into gargoyles. Human warmth is present, but only as a delusion or deception... The music is as ambitious as it is pretentious, although it will not leave you indifferent".

Northgate Canyon

Northgate Canyon is the long stretch of the North Platte River between Routt Access (Colorado) and Six-Mile Gap (Wyoming).
Description.
Beginning not far from the source of the North Platte River, Northgate Canyon is the river's gateway north. The water follows the western flank of the Park Range in Colorado as it plunges at approximately 20 ft/mile through the canyon. The high gradient produces some of Colorado's and Wyoming's best Class III+ rapids, including Windy Hole, Cowpie, Narrow Falls (The Gate), Tootsie Roll, and Stovepipe.
In addition to the whitewater, the scenery is beautiful. Although, the recent migration of pine bark beetles have caused massive damages to the pine forests. It is not uncommon to see deer, elk, moose, or bear near the river. Once the flows begin to recede and the water clarity to increase, the stream is a fun, albeit often difficult trout fishery.
Most of the riverbank is public (National Forest) land. It should be kept in mind however, that a small section, (visibly marked with several cabins) Gingerquill Ranch is private. Non-emergency landings at the ranch are a violation of Colorado state law and should be avoided.
Rapid Descriptions.
Windy Hole -
Beginning about one-half mile below the put-in at Routt Access, Windy Hole is the first rapid in Northgate Canyon. The river takes a sharp turn to the left as the flow cuts through solid rock. The entry is usually just left of center. Windy Hole (the hole itself, not the rapid) is about 2/3 through the rapid, and is barely right of center. Only experienced experts in large craft should attempt to take the hole head-on, and then only in lower water conditions. As the flow increases Windy Hole becomes more difficult.
Cowpie (also known as Houserock)-
This long rapid begins some time after crossing into Wyoming. The rapid begins after a leisurely right turn in the river and the gradient noticeably increases. Also, a large outcrop of granite on river-left that resembles a cowpie marks the entrance. At the first corner (a left turn) a particular maneuver is required to pass an obstacle known as Split Rock (also known as Cowpie Rock). This is generally navigated on river right with a hard pull back to the left. Proper navigation of Split Rock allows for the ideal set up for the remainder of the rapid. The flow is obstructed by several large boulders and the current weaves from bank to bank. Once the river narrows into a shear-walled canyon, Cowpie is over and Narrow Falls has arrived. There is no gap between Cowpie and Narrow Falls. The two rapids flow seamlessly into one another. A mistake in Cowpie could prove disastrous in the Falls.
Narrow Falls (also known as The Gate)-
Immediately after Cowpie, the river makes a right turn and has a very distinct horizon line. Towering cliffs mark both sides of the rapid. At water levels at or below a large rock is visible on river right. At higher flows the rock becomes a massive pour-over/hole that should be avoided at all costs. The run is center, just next to the large rock on the right. A chute exists that cannot be scouted for (Narrow Falls is extremely difficult to scout except from a kayak). One left-hand stroke can slide the boat into the chute. Be aware, between and a current pushes strongly toward the wall on the left. Above that level, a breaker wave appears and provides a cushion on the wall. The remaining rocks in the center and left of center can be avoided (by going right) or fairly easily navigated by an experienced boatman. At moderate to low flows an edie forms on river right below the falls allowing boats entering the falls first a place to provide safety for later boats.
Tootsie Roll-
About a mile downstream from the conclusion of The Gate (Narrow Falls), Tootsie Roll appears. The rapid is mostly straightforward. Be aware of Cookie Monster at the end however. The two large, often submerged boulders here create two extremely powerful ledge holes. The holes may sneak up on boatmen that are not paying attention. There is a commonly used sneak run to river right. The alternative is to run the holes, which can be avoided at certain, specific levels by delicate maneuvering. This judgment call should be made by the boatman.
Stovepipe-
The last rapid in Northgate Canyon is Stovepipe. The shear walls and slight right turn make the entrance to this rapid identifiable. The take-out for day trips is immediately below the rapid just past the free standing rock pillar and boatmen should stay left to make sure they do not miss it. The rapid itself is a large, but clean wave-train. Caution should be taken to avoid getting too far right, which could result in getting slammed into the wall there.

Democracy and Workers' Rights Center

The Democracy and Workers' Rights Center (DWRC) is a Palestinian non-governmental, non-profit organization, not affiliated with any political party. DWRC was established in 1993 by a group of trade unionists, lawyers, academics and political figures in Palestinian society to defend workers’ rights and promote social justice. Founders feature Hassan Barghouthi (General Secretary of the International Federation of Workers' Education Associations in Arab Countries), and Ghassan Khatib (former Planning Minister and longtime journalist). DWRC is centered in Ramallah with a branch office in Gaza City.
Significance.
In 2000 the Palestinian President ratified the first Palestinian Labor Law. However, according to DWRC the Labor Law lacked teeth, and DWRC lawyers and organizers acted to work with Palestinian Authority legal experts to introduce amendments; late in 2005, DWRC successfully achieved Palestinian Legislative Council acceptance of an alternative Palestinian Labor Law.
Existing large-scale trade union federations in Palestine have long since ceased to be democratic according to a range of observers; the Fateh-dominated PGFTU has not had elections since 1981. DWRC, as an independent NGO which is not itself a trade union, has been at the forefront of calling the PGFTU to account within the Palestinian media as well as internationally, and has organized hundreds of democratic worker committees, pushing for a fully transparent Palestinian labor movement.
In 2007, DWRC organized the Federation of Independent & Democratic Trade Unions & Workers' Committees in Palestine, launching the first large-scale conference of democratic, independent Palestinian trade unions in decades, representing more than 50,000 female and male workers.

Send the Light

Send the Light (STL) was a British Christian book distributor which had absorbed other Christian publishers and bookshops, and eventually merged with the International Bible Society to become one of the largest non-profit book distributors in the world under the title of IBS-STL Global, now known as Biblica.
Early history.
The name “Send the Light” first appeared in 1957 as a Christian literature evangelism ministry sending copies of the Gospel of John from Chicago to Mexico, under the direction of George Verwer, then a student at Moody Bible Institute. Verwer later moved to Bolton in the UK, where he established Operation Mobilisation (OM), which today distributes Christian literature in many countries around the world. Verwer decided to keep the name “Send the Light” for one particular aspect of OM, exporting Christian books to India. As STL, this developed into a general distributor of Christian books, and relocated to Bromley in Kent.
Rise to Prominence.
In January 1986, Keith Danby was made chief executive of STL. Danby had a background in finance and by introducing stock catalogues, a free telephone number and next-day deliveries he increased turnover by 52% in one year. In 1988 he set up an independent board for STL which separated it from the governance of OM, and the following year the company relocated to Carlisle. In the 1990s STL began to expand its interests.
In 1992 an old Christian publisher, Paternoster Press, was acquired, and the first Wesley Owen Books and Music shop was opened in Bromley. The intention was to create a “Christian Waterstone's” which would be more professional than many of the Christian bookshops then found in the UK. The following year STL took over the Church of Scotland shops, the Evangelical Christian Literature (ECL) shops, and the Scripture Union shops. Danby explained that STL’s aim was to show “excellence combined with Christian compassion”. 
In 1993 OM released STL to operate as a separate organisation to allow it to concentrate on the publishing and distribution of Christian literature.[http://www.christianexaminer.com/Articles/Articles%20Mar07/Art_Mar07_09.html].
In 2001 STL acquired Word UK, which produced books, music and videos. STL became the largest Christian organisation dealing with books in the UK. STL remained a charity, and in 2001 was listed as the 74th largest one in the UK. STL was also the main gateway for several of the biggest American Christian publishers, including Tyndale House, Zondervan, Moody Books, Baker Books, and Multnomah.
Entering the American Market.
In 2003 STL moved into the US market by acquiring OM_Literature. It also purchased the distributor FaithWorks, and in 2005 it bought its largest acquisition, Appalachian Distributors Inc. The CEO of STL USA is David Passman.
Merger with the International Bible Society.
In January 2007, Send the Light merged with the International Bible Society providing a truly global reach. The result was the creation of one of the largest non-profit book distributors in the world. The STL leaders set a target for when the merger went through on 1 March 2007 of having “a Bible for everyone on Earth”. The new organisation became known as "IBS-STL Global" and the UK operation as IBS-STL (UK) and registered as a charity and a company limited by guarantee.
Financial difficulties, administration.
The last set of financial statements by IBS-STL UK for the year ended 28 February 2009, and approved by the Board on 6 July 2009, refer to having had a "challenging year for the Charity". This had been characterised by "a combination of weak economic conditions in the UK, and a difficult move to the new SAP IT system", leading to a "significant operational loss" for that year. The report highlighted the financial risks which the Charity was exposed to, particularly those associated with loans, leases, and trade debtors and creditors. There was however no indication that these risks would be so severe as to result in the collapse of the business just four months later. 
On 16 November 2009 IBS-STL UK announced that due to "a succession of financial problems, in particular the failed implementation of a new SAP computer system in October 2008, the effects of which were exacerbated by the economic downturn" a decision had been taken to "exit the business" at which point a buyer was sought. However, no sale arrangement could be made and IBS STL (UK) formally entered into Administration on 18 December 2009. Two partners from Baker Tilly Restructuring and Recovery LLP, Manchester, were appointed by the High Court as joint administrators. The ensuing process of administration resulted in the following outcome for the principal trading activities of IBS-STL (UK) :-
"STL Distribution".
In December 2009 John Ritchie Ltd of Kilmarnock, Scotland, finalised a deal with the Administrators to become the owners of the Christian book distribution and wholesaler business, STL Distribution Ltd. John Ritchie Ltd stated their intention to retain Carlisle as the major base of operation for this business. Keith Danby was replaced by Ken Munro as CEO.
"Wesley Owen".
At the time the business collapsed, IBS STL (UK) were operating a chain of 41 retail units (bookshops) under the 'Wesley Owen' brand name, situated in various towns and cities throughout the UK. In the months following, a majority of these shops were taken over by other Christian-based companies or charitable trusts leaving only a small number unable to continue trading after no buyers were found. 
"Authentic Book Publishing".
Koorong, in addition to purchasing the Wesley Owen brand (see above), also purchased all of the Authentic and Paternoster intellectual property and author contracts and with plans to continue the book publishing business from the existing Authentic base in the Milton Keynes area.
"Authentic Music".
Kingsway Communications of Eastbourne, East Sussex, bought the music part of the Authentic Media business based in Milton Keynes.
Liquidation.
On 1 December 2010, the company was moved from administration and into creditors' voluntary liquidation. The final progress report from the Administrators showed that the largest of the Secured Creditors, Royal Bank of Scotland, had been repaid £3.278m from the realisation of their legal charges over one freehold and two long leasehold sites, leaving a shortfall of £1.2m owing. Scripture Union had recovered £311k from an arrangement to receive proceeds from debtor realisations, which left 14% outstanding on the amount owing. Preferential claims comprising outstanding holiday pay to employees were settled in full. Unsecured Creditor claims aggregating to over £9.5m had not been paid at all at the end of the administration and would be addressed during liquidation. With the administrator fees and costs totalling over £500k, the funds remaining from the realised assets amounted to £2.15m. The final dividend for distribution to unsecured creditors was just over £35,000.

Blank Generation (song)

"Blank Generation" is the title track of Richard Hell and the Voidoids' debut album "Blank Generation". A rewrite of Rod McKuen's 1959 record "The Beat Generation," Richard Hell wrote the new lyrics during his time with the band Television, and performed it live with another band, The Heartbreakers. The Sex Pistols' song "Pretty Vacant" was directly inspired by "Blank Generation".
The song was first released on the "Another World" EP in 1976.
An earlier live recording by The Heartbreakers, recorded at the CBGB, on July 7 1975 can be found on the "What Goes Around..." album (1991). Demo recordings of the song also have survived.
A live March 1974 recording at CBGB with Television can be found on "Spurts: The Richard Hell Story".

Bavarian AA I

The only AA I steam locomotive of the Royal Bavarian State Railways ("Königlich Bayerische Staatsbahn") was built by the firm of Krauss in 1896. It had been designed by chief mechanical engineer, Richard von Helmholtz, as a 4-2-2-2 tender locomotive. The engine was largely based on the Bavarian B XI, but the driving and running gear was modified. The second coupled axle was replaced by a fixed carrying axle, and a dolly axle ("Vorspannachse") added between the bogie and driving axle. This could be lowered by a pressure cylinder and was driven by an auxiliary engine with two cylinders. Despite her high maintenance requirement, she was economical to run due to her low steam consumption. In 1907 she was rebuilt after an accident into a 2'B h2 locomotive and redesignated as a Class P 2/4. She was taken over by the Deutsche Reichsbahn and run under operating number 36 861. She was the last Bavarian 4-4-0 locomotive to be retired in 1933.
The engine was equipped with a Bavarian 3 T 14.5 tender.

Government incentives for fuel efficient vehicles in the United States

The U.S. Energy Policy Act of 2005 established a federal income tax credit of up to $3,400 for the purchase of new hybrid vehicles, purchased or placed into service after December 31, 2005. Vehicles purchased after December 31, 2010 are not eligible for this credit. The law limited the tax credits to the first 60,000 eligible vehicles per carmaker, meaning that credits for popular models will be phase out before the tax break's scheduled expiration date. Note these are credits — dollar for dollar tax savings — not merely deductions. The tax credit is to be phased out two calendar quarters after the manufacturer reaches 60,000 new cars sold in the following manner: it will be reduced to 50% if delivered in either the third or fourth quarter after the threshold is reached, to 25% in the fifth and sixth quarters, and 0% thereafter. The Internal Revenue Service is responsible for certifying that certain passenger autos and light trucks qualify for the credit and the amount of the credit.
Some state governments in the U.S. have introduced special provisions for hybrid vehicles driving in carpool lanes.
Tax incentives.
Energy Policy Act of 2005.
The Energy Policy Act of 2005 created incentives to encourage the purchase of low emission vehicles. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 expanded these incentives to include emerging electric vehicle, and plug in hybrid, technology. The Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 only acted to push back tax credit-claiming deadlines and include more electric vehicles in existing incentive programs. Although many speculated that more recent stimulus legislation would greatly expand existing incentive programs, but the legislation disappointed many. When passed, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 focused more on green infrastructure than personal transportation incentives. The act did allocate money, however, to equip government agencies with more efficient vehicles, created a grant program for diesel owners wishing to outfit their cars with cleaner burning technology, and added a significant tax incentive program for plug-in hybrids.
The tax incentives that are the result of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 are offered to make pricier, but more environmentally friendly vehicles more appealing. Because the process of manufacturing many low emission vehicles (LEV), for example, a hybrid engine, is more technology intensive, and therefore more expensive, than the process of manufacturing a standard gasoline engine, the cost a hybrid automobile is greater than that of a car with comparable performance. Many potential buyers will require economic incentive to purchase a more expensive LEV over an automobile that runs on gasoline, so a tax credit is offered to effectively cheapen the LEV and encourage the purchase of more environmentally friendly automobiles.
The characteristics and availability of an offered tax credit will vary based on the characteristics and popularity of the car in question, respectively. The size of the offered tax credit typically corresponds in value to the amount of money that the technology in question adds to the manufacture price of the car. For example, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles that are in the early stages of development are more expensive and receive a larger tax credit than a diesel car that is cheaper to make. Existing incentive programs are also set to phase out after a given maker sells 60,000 hybrid vehicles, so more popular models like the Toyota Prius are no longer subject to a tax credit.
Incentives may also vary based on how well the car in question performs in these “green” categories. For example the buyer of a Tesla Roadster, a fully electric vehicle, will receive a much larger tax credit than the buyer of a standard hybrid, which will pollute much more during its lifespan. The federal government now lists models that are pre-approved to receive a tax credit; some other models may qualify on an ad hoc basis.
Phase out credits.
The 60,000-vehicle cap applies to all nameplates across an automaker's business, and as such, Lexus hybrids are accounted as part of Toyota Motor Company production, or Mercury hybrids are part of Ford Motor Company hybrid production. As of mid-2010 three auto manufactures have reached the 60,000 cap, Toyota reached it in 2007, Honda in 2008, and as of April 1, 2010, all Ford hybrid vehicles are also no longer eligible for tax credits.
Currently available credits.
The following chart refers to model year 2009/2011 vehicles, and these credits are available to vehicles purchased before December 31, 2010, when the credits expire.
Historical credit rankings.
Hybrid tax credits from lowest to highest:
Carpool lane incentives.
In California, hybrids with an EPA estimate of or higher meet the requirements to drive in California's carpool lanes with only one passenger.
Virginia has also provisions for hybrid vehicles. For example, the Toyota Camry Hybrid was eligible, but must have been specially tagged by June 30, 2006 to be eligible for I-95 & I-395 exemption. Exemption for I-66 and Dulles Toll Road HOV usage continues even for registrations beyond June 30.
As of July 29, 2005 Arizona Revised Statutes from the 47th session Chapters 28-2416 and 28-737 allow hybrid vehicles that have been approved by the EPA as meeting, at a minimum, the United States environmental protection agency ultralow emission vehicle standard with a special plates/hybrid sticker that is displayed on said vehicle to use the High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes regardless of the number of passengers. Arizona has not instituted this policy as it is awaiting clarification of the federal Hybrid HOV waiver from the EPA. On January 16, 2006 SB 1179 was introduced that would reaffirm the HOV benefit, pending federal clearance.

Gameplay.
Out of battle, "Tales of Hearts" has similar gameplay to other titles in the series. The player visits various towns throughout the game, in which they can talk to various NPCs, buy items, and progress the story. The player also goes to dungeons, which contain various enemies, treasures, and puzzles, in which the Sorcerer's Ring, a recurring item in the series, may play a part in solving. After battles, the player acquires gald to buy various things, and experience points, which goes toward leveling up the party. When traveling between towns and dungeons, the player travels through the field map, which contains no enemies. While on the field map the player may go through "field dungeons", which do contain enemies. In both dungeons and field dungeons, enemies are visible, and can be engaged in battle when touched.
By going to accessory shops, the player can make different accessories through materials found throughout the game, all with different effects or benefits. Accessories can also be turned back into the materials used to create it for other uses.
Customization in the game is handled through the "Soma Build" system, through which the player upgrades the Soma (weapons) of the party and control their growth. The player can use raw materials found throughout the game to learn various abilities, or "Soma Skills" (of which there are four types: Parameter, Battle, Action, and Support), or to add various stat bonuses to a character.
When Soma Build is performed on a weapon enough times, the weapon can go through a process called "Soma Evolve", in which the Soma will take on a new form and name, and unlock new Soma Skills and stat bonuses.
Throughout the game there are various events in which the player can choose different options towards another character, called a "Soma Link". Through certain choices it will cause the outcomes of scenes to change, and the character may gain points towards their "Soma Link Value". Once it becomes high enough, the character can learn various skills.
By using Soma, the party can go into one's heart, called a "Spir Link". The person's mind is like a labyrinth, called a "Spir Maze", a place with various rare items and other things to find. There are chances to go into these during both the main scenario and with NPCs throughout the game.
Battle system.
"Tales of Hearts" uses the "Combination Aerial Linear Motion Battle System", or CNAR-LMBS. Like previous games in the series, "Tales of Hearts" uses 2D sprites, with combat taking place on a single two-dimensional line, and is completely real-time, with the player controlling one person and the others being controlled by A.I. if another person isn't controlling them. Similar to "Tales of the Tempest" and "Tales of Innocence", only three party members are on the battlefield, but it allows the player to let party members not currently in battle participate, along with using aerial combat, first introduced in the "Aerial Linear Motion Battle System" (AR-LMBS) of "Tales of Destiny".
Instead of TP seen in other entries of the series, all party members have an "Emotional Gauge", or "EG". It is based on the CC system of "Tales of Destiny", in that the player is free to create any chain of attacks, skills, or spells until the meter is depleted, and the meter automatically refills upon finishing the chain of moves.
Every party member also has a "Combination Gauge", or CG. Through any kind of actions, like skills, jumps, backsteps or even basic attacks, the gauge is increased. This gauge is consumed when the player calls a non-battle party member to battle to perform one of that character's attacks, or commands a battle party to do a move, this is called a "Connect Command". The player is also able to use unison attacks, by using a certain skill with the currently-controlled character and having another party member use another certain attack. The player also has the option of calling in characters from previous games in the series to use an attack, such as Guy, Jade, Anise and Natalia from Tales of the Abyss, Reid from Tales of Eternia, Lloyd and Presea from Tales of Symphonia, Caius and Rubia from Tales of the Tempest, Yuri from Tales of Vesperia, Mao and Tytree from Tales of Rebirth, Judas and Loni from Tales of Destiny 2, Arche from Tales of Phantasia, Senel from Tales of Legendia, Stahn and Rutee from Tales of Destiny, Ruca and Iria from Tales of Innocence, and even characters from other Namco products, such as Yayoi Takatsuki from The Idolmaster, Klonoa from Kaze no Klonoa, Gilgamesh from The Tower of Druaga, Wagyan from Wagan Land, Valkyrie from Valkyrie no Densetsu, Heihachi from Tekken, and KOS-MOS from Xenosaga.
There are also nine attributes: Fire, Water, Wind, Earth, Light, Dark, Slash, Strike, and Shoot. Through attacking these weak points, damage, hit ratio, and the critical ratio will increase.
Development.
"Tales of Hearts" was officially revealed in V-Jump Magazine, alongside "". It was later shown at the 2008 Fiscal Year presentation for the series, where it was announced that it was the first game in the series for the DS that would be developed by Namco Tales Studio, to use both anime or CG for movie scenes.

The fragment is now in the British Museum. The short caption to the figure of Bebi reads: "vizier, zab-official, the one belonging to the curtain Bebi". Bebi might have been the first Middle Kingdom official with that title. His successor was Dagi. Perhaps Bebi started his career as treasurer. A treasurer with the name Bebi is known from a stela, now in New York.

Tom Clare

Tom Clare (26 September 1876 – 5 December 1946) was a British music hall singer from the early twentieth century, born in London. He was best known for singing humorous songs which he accompanied on the piano.
He made his first stage appearance when he was eight years old, with the Mohawk Minstrels. He was particularly well known, in the First World War era, for his ironic, humorous songs, "The Fine Old English Gentleman" (a song which gently mocked the arrival of modernity, "Who Bashed Bill Kaiser?" and "What did You do in the Great War, Daddy?" This last song (based on a 1915 Savile Lumley propaganda poster, "Daddy, what did YOU do in the Great War?") criticized those who claimed to be war heroes but in fact had been busy on the black market, or avoiding work, throughout the war. In another of his songs he poked fun at certain civilian decorations which had been (in the opinion of "The Times") too generously bestowed. Songs of social criticism are rare at this time in the Music Hall, and Tom Clare's stand out. He can be found on both the 1901 & 1911 census as an entertainer he was also involved with the Bohemia Theatre at Broadstairs, Kent.
He was also involved in a large number of charity concerts in aid of wounded soldiers.
Although, like most singers of his time, it was in live shows that he gained his reputation, he began recording his songs on cylinder as early as 1906, with his hit "The Girl in the Big Black Hat".

<doc id="18283010" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18283010" title="Boletus impolitus">
Boletus impolitus

Boletus impolitus, is a basidiomycete fungus of the Boletaceae family, that has tubes and pores instead of gills. These pores can be seen under the cap as tiny holes. It is edible, but rare, and should not be picked for the table. It grows beneath "Quercus" (oak) trees. It is commonly called the iodine bolete, because of its smell when cut.
Taxonomy.
"Impolitus" is Latin, meaning "unpolished", "matt", "unsmoothed", or "unfinished", and may be a reference to the hammered look of some specimens. It was first described by Elias Magnus Fries, an eminent mycologist of the 19th century.
Description.
The cap is at first hemispherical, but flattens with age, and is sometimes upturned when mature. It is pale brown,light tan, or tawny, often with a pale grey hoariness initially. It often has a 'hammered' look. The cap diameter usually ranges between 5 and 12 cm (2–5 in), but can reach up to 20 cm (8 in). The stem is 5 to 15 cm (2–6 in) high, and is slightly fatter at the base. It is pale yellow, and often has a red flush. It has no network (reticulation), but sometimes has reddish dots. The pores and tubes are pale yellow, with the pores being small and round, and they do 'not' bruise blue. The flesh is pale yellow, and remains the same colour when cut. It is soft and has a sour smell somewhat like iodine in the base. The spore print is olivaceous walnut-brown.
Distribution and habitat.
This species is mycorrhizal with oak ("Quercus"), and occasional in Southern England. In mainland Europe it is found with oaks and hornbeams ("Carpinus") on chalky soils, and has been found under pines ("Pinus") . In Southern England it can appear in two or three flushes from June till September, depending on weather conditions.
Edibility.
"Boletus impolitus" is typically considered inedible. Some report it as mild, but should be left in the interests of conservation.

In a September 2008 interview with Pete Lewis of "Blues & Soul", Sullivan disccused the album's title and lyrical themes, stating "I named the album "Fearless" because I'm just not afraid of ANYTHING right now. I'm young, I'm 22 years old... And I just feel that, if YOU embrace your uniqueness by not being afraid to take chances and being different, then everybody ELSE will! You know, I definitely did not wanna exclude ANYBODY! So, if you buy my record and think you're gonna get just a bunch of reggae beats or just a bunch of R&B beats, you'll be wrong! You're gonna get EVERYTHING! I mean, the genres can range from jazz, to gospel, to pop... Because that's who I AM! And, with me having been inspired by so much, I wanted everybody to SEE that diversity in me."

Reception.
Commercial performance.
"Fearless" entered at number six on the "Billboard" 200, with first week sales of 65,000 copies. It fell to number 10 in its second week, selling 42,000 more copies. The album also peaked at number one on "Billboard"s Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. As of November 2010, "Fearless" has sold 517,000 copies in the United States.
Critical response.
The album received generally positive reviews from most music critics. Sullivan received many comparisons by critics to other well-known female R&B artists, such as Lauryn Hill, Amy Winehouse, Mary J. Blige, and Alicia Keys. Allmusic writer Andy Kellman gave the album 4½ out of 5 stars and praised her performance, stating "There's a lot of range on display here, and there is just as much depth". "Vibe"s Erika Ramirez praised Sullivan's singing and lyrical substance, writing "Sullivan's vocal perfection pilots her debut album... and boasts her self-penned lyrics which are filled with struggle and heartache, embodying every inch of the soul star she is". In his consumer guide for MSN Music, critic Robert Christgau gave "Fearless" a rating of honorable mention (), indicating "an enjoyable effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well treasure." "NOW"s Benjamin Boles commended Sullivan for her "strong voice" and the album's production, stating "she’s pulling from a pleasingly wide range of influences – dropping bits of doo-wop, roots reggae, Motown and hip-hop into the mix while maintaining a consistent feel". "Q" gave it 4 out of 5 stars and wrote "voice merges Beyonce and Amy Winehouse and is backed by slick productions". "Houston Chronicle" writer Joey Guerra wrote favorably of her songwriting and called the album "a collection brimming with attitude, edge and soul". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine gave it 4 out of 5 stars and commended Sullivan for her lyrical honesty and musical range. "The Washington Post"s Allison Stewart described "Fearless" as "a mix of awkward-but-novel devices (reggae beats, Daft Punk samples) and nakedly confessional songwriting" and called it "a snappy, intensely human debut".
However, "Entertainment Weekly"s Simon Vozick-Levinson gave "Fearless" a C+ rating and described most of its music as "schmaltzy pop-&-B". Giving the album 3 out of 5 stars, About.com's Mark Edward Nero viewed her vocals as "generic and lack emotion or urgency" on some songs, but ultimately wrote that "there are more hits than misses here". Nero lauded Sullivan's vocal performance and compared her songwriting to that of R&B musician Ne-Yo, writing "due to both artists' talent for writing on-point, introspective lyrics. Like Ne-Yo, Jazmine has a knack for crafting intricate, deeply personal verses that make you feel at one with the singer. Even on the weaker songs on Fearless, the songwriting is still above par". "USA Today"s Steve Jones gave the album 3 out of 4 stars and wrote that she "sings every word as if she means it". MusicOMH writer Michael Cragg praised Sullivan's vocal range and themes on the album, writing "Sullivan has created a mature, engaging R&B album that doesn't rely solely on the usual tropes of sexuality, money and posturing. Instead, Fearless deals with real emotions sung in a way that convinces the listener she means every single word". Okayplayer's Jeff Harvey called it "a well produced urban pop album" and wrote that Sullivan's voice "carries a subtle tenderness that adds intriguing nuance". Jon Caramanica of "The New York Times" wrote favorably of Sullivan's performance and wrote "Her sense of humor is her best asset. She doesn't have a huge, imposing voice, but she's versatile, dabbling in jazz and reggae phrasings with ease".
Accolades.
She earned five 2009 Grammy Award nominations for the album including Best Female R&B Vocal Performance ("Need U Bad"), Best Traditional R&B Vocal Performance ("I'm in Love with Another Man"), Best R&B Song ("Bust Your Windows"), and Best Contemporary R&B Album. She was also nominated for Best New Artist. "Vibe" magazine named the album one of the Ten Best Albums of 2008.

<doc id="18283097" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18283097" title="Western Shugden Society">
Western Shugden Society

The Western Shugden Society (or WSS) is a campaigning group established in 2008 to protest against the 14th Dalai Lama's ban of the practice of Dorje Shugden within the Tibetan exile community.
When talking to the Western media, the Dalai Lama stated that "he had not advocated a ban, but he had stopped the worship of the spirit because it was not Buddhist in nature." When talking to Tibetans, he said: "These monks must be expelled from all monasteries. If they are not happy, you can tell them that the Dalai Lama himself asked that this be done, and it is very urgent."
Dorje Shugden is a Dharma Protector of the Sakya and Gelug traditions, who has been worshipped for over three hundred years. The WSS state that they are an organized community of Dorje Shugden practitioners from around the world, with no leader and no registered office. Critics have suggested that the WSS is not a legitimate organization, but rather an effort by the Chinese government to discredit the Dalai Lama.
Background.
In 1996 the Dalai Lama openly advised against the propitiation of Dorje Shugden "in the interest of Buddhism and the Tibetan national cause." This was reported in the New Internationalist as a ban. A statement in September 1996 from, Ven. Lobsang Nyima Rinpoche, the Head of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism referred to it as a "ban", as did a Tibetan Youth Congress resolution in 1997.
In a speech made at a Tibetan University in Southern India January 2008, the Dalai Lama said:
Recently monasteries have fearlessly expelled Shugden monks where needed. I fully support their actions. I praise them. If monasteries find taking action hard, tell them the Dalai Lama is responsible for this."
The Tibetan Government in Exile is enforcing this ban in national institutions:
In sum, the departments, their branches and subsidiaries, monasteries and their branches that are functioning under the administrative control of the Tibetan Government-in-Exile should be strictly instructed, in accordance with the rules and regulations, not to indulge in the propitiation of Shugden.
However, in May 2008, the Office of Tibet in London claimed that, rather than banning the prayer, the Dalai Lama is advising against it, adding that those who choose to ignore his advice cannot expect to attend his teachings. They also state that he considers Dorje Shugden a fierce spirit who can be used to curse others. Devotion to this spirit is seen by the Dalai Lama as encouraging sectarianism, harming the prospects for Tibetan autonomy and, indeed, the Dalai Lama’s own longevity.
The WSS claim that the Dalai Lama and the TGIE have not responded to any of their attempts to dialogue on the subject and supporters say that the TGIE have simply discredited the opposition. Tsultrim Tenzin, MP in the Tibetan Government in Exile, when asked if the Tibetan Parliament debated the Dorje Shugden issue replied:
There was no argument. If there was some opposition, then there will be some argument, but there is no opposition. We do not have any doubt about the Dalai Lama's decisions. We do not think he is a human being. He is a supreme human being, and he is god, he is Avalokiteshvara, he has no interest himself, he always thinks of others. Everybody is happy. Our system is everybody is happy. There is democracy, full democracy. Everyone can experience whatever he likes.
The WSS also claims that about one third of the Tibetan population, including hundreds of previous Tibetan Buddhist teachers, used to rely on Dorje Shugden. They state that the Dalai Lama abandoned the practice of Dorje Shugden in the 1970s and that in 1996 he and the Tibetan Government in Exile imposed social obstacles on those not willing to follow his lead, resulting in access to various jobs, positions, schools, and monasteries in the Tibetan community in exile becoming impossible without publicly renouncing Dorje Shugden, while those who showed support for him were rewarded with key positions and visits by the Dalai Lama.
The WSS further states that on 9 January 2008 the Dalai Lama instigated public swearings in monastic universities in South India, and now throughout the world. They claim that this is aimed at making social life impossible for anyone not renouncing Dorje Shugden and that it has created social segregation with those who refuse to renounce Shugden being publicly denounced as "unclean", "traitors to the Tibetan cause" and enemies of the Dalai Lama. They state that without the new yellow identity card which has been introduced, it is not possible "to attend common Prayer Halls, to buy goods in shops, to obtain visa’s for travelling and families are being torn apart." The WSS maintain that this is ostracising Shugden practitioners and religious apartheid, while the Dalai Lama teaches in the West about religious freedom and tolerance.
Shugden practitioners have also been subjected to violence. Most recently, Radio Free Asia reported on October 2, 2008 that Tibetan monks been "handed jail terms ranging from four to nine years in connection with several explosions in Markham county, Chamdo, during Tibetan protests earlier this year", including "one at the residence of a Tibetan who worships Shugden, a controversial deity espoused by Beijing but regarded with suspicion by those loyal to the Dalai Lama."
As a result of this situation, some Tibetan Buddhist monasteries, such as Dagom Tensung Ling and Gaden Samdrupling, Tibetan Buddhist Monasteries in the United States set up by Kyabje Dagom Rinpoche, have separated from the Dalai Lama. According to Geshe Kuten Lama, a teacher at Gaden Samdrupling:
There was one primary reason why we established our monastery: to preserve our lineage. The hardship is because the Dalai Lama took our religious freedom, our human rights. But it is very hard for us ordinary persons to explain to the world because he is so powerful and famous and our words are not too important.
The first protests by Dorje Shugden practitioners in the West were organised by the Dorje Shugden Coalition (DSC). For instance, in May 1998, 130 DSC protestors demonstrated as the Dalai Lama visited Manhattan in the United States. The DSC said they would continue to follow the Dalai Lama on his tour of the United States until he gave them the religious freedom they said they were being denied. The DSC campaign lasted for two years from 1996 until October 1998. At that time, the main sponsoring organization, the New Kadampa Tradition (NKT) and its leader Geshe Kelsang Gyatso confirmed that they had stopped all involvement in the campaigning. In 1996 there had been other groups associated with the NKT such as the Shugden Supporters Community and the Freedom Foundation.
Aims.
According to its website the WSS is an ad hoc coalition of Dorje Shugden practitioners from many different countries. Its aims are fourfold:
The WSS states four reasons for protesting, using four slogans:
The WSS website offers little information about the structure or size of the group. All group membership entails is to be sympathetic to the aims of the WSS.
The WSS states that it is independent of any other groups. Protesters representing the WSS at demonstrations in 2008 were principally Western Buddhists and Tibetans living in the West, affiliated with various groups who practice Dorje Shugden including the NKT and others such as students from Dagom Tensung Ling and Gaden Samdrupling, Tibetan Buddhist Monasteries in the United States. Some of the people who took part in these demonstrations were ordained monks and nuns, both Western and Tibetan.
Activities.
The WSS demonstrates in non-violent, peaceful protests stating that all such protests will end when the Dalai Lama lifts his ban, or at least when he accepts Shugden practitioners' invitation to dialogue, which has been in place since 1996.
Following the expulsion of the first six monks, all Dorje Shugden practitioners, from Sera monastery in Bylakuppe, Mysore, South India, the WSS wrote to the monastery on 9 April 2008 stating that the expulsion was based on wrong and false reasons. They said that unless the monastery reversed the expulsions by 22 April they would "immediately organise worldwide public demonstrations directly against the Dalai Lama whenever he visits any country." Although the letter came from the WSS, they requested the monastery reply to the Dorje Shugden Devotees Society in Majnu Ka Tila, Delhi. On 12 April they wrote to the Dalai Lama with their fourfold aims, also giving him until 22 April to respond, and again care of the Dorje Shugden Devotees Society.
Demonstrations.
Ten years after the original DSC campaign ended, and following no response to the two WSS letters, demonstrations began under the WSS umbrella in Hamilton, Madison County, United States on 22 April 2008 and since then several thousand people from a number of countries have taken part. They chant two slogans, "Dalai Lama, Stop Lying" and "Dalai Lama, Give Religious Freedom," calling the protests "Shugden Protests, a Journey in Compassion." Protestors chant in English as well as the language of the country they are in (such as German), and also with some protestors being Tibetan, in the Tibetan language.
Between 22 April and 17 August 2008 the WSS has protested outside twelve locations where the Dalai Lama was giving talks in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, and France. The BBC reported that there were 500 protesters at the demonstration on 28 May 2008 outside the Sheldonian Theatre in Oxford, England, where the Dalai Lama had been invited to speak to the Dominican monks of Blackfriars.
At the start of the Dalai Lama's visit to Australia, "The Sydney Morning Herald" reported that there were a total of 50 demonstrators on 11 June at the Sydney Olympic Park in Sydney as he held a meditation course for about 5,000 followers at the Acer Arena. As the Dalai Lama spoke to a crowd of about 5,000 at the Stabler Arena, Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania in the United States on 13 July, about 300 protestors stood outside chanting slogans.
At the demonstration outside Radio City Hall in New York City on 17 July, chaotic scenes surrounded the protest as police, including mounted police, had to separate the WSS protestors, said to number about 200-300 and the Dalai Lama supporters who numbered several thousand to avoid a possible clash, with some of the Dalai Lama supporters approaching the WSS protestors, as they left a lecture by the Dalai Lama. Hundreds of the Dalai Lama supporters shouted "Long live the Dalai Lama" toward the protestors and waved currency notes to make the point that they believed demonstrators were paid Chinese agents. The WSS deny this and request proof. Some of the Dalai Lama supporters also spat at the demonstrators and threw things. Eventually the police had to close down The Avenue of the Americas for about twenty minutes to escort the protestors away from the scene. One protestor claimed that the 50 police officers who were there urged the protesters to leave the scene for their own safety, as they could not protect them.
WSS press speaker, Kelsang Pema, who had flown from England for the demonstration, referred to the Dalai Lama as the "Hollywood Monk" and claimed that he "pretends he doesn't speak English to avoid getting into any discussion of serious issues." She also denied that the group had been paid by the Chinese government. "We get no money from the Chinese. They can check our organization. We’re clean." She also called him a hypocrite and compared the treatment of Dorje Shugden practitioners to the treatment of the Jews in Nazi Germany, saying it is
The Dalai Lama had been asked about the protest during his talk. He said that he used to follow the same practice, but that he had given it up because it was intolerant of other Buddhist teachings, adding, "This is just spirit worship. After I read more about it, I realized my mistake and dropped my practice. I think 99% of Tibetans follow my practice. Some small portion worship this spirit. I am committed to freedom of speech, freedom of talk. So I say to them, enjoy freedom of talk." He also argued that two past Dalai Lamas had restricted the practice, and that he was following tradition. The WSS asserts that he has for more than a decade "been fostering a campaign of intimidation, humiliation, and ostracism" against practitioners of Dorje Shugden. They also argue that even if the worship of Dorje Shugden has now become a minority religion due, ironically, to the actions of the Dalai Lama, it is still correct to protect the religious freedom of minorities.
'A Great Deception'.
The Western Shugden Society has published a book entitled "A Great Deception - The Ruling Lamas' Policies" (Western Shugden Society, 2009 ISBN 978-0-9563918-0-3) in which they claim to expose the mixing of religion and politics (called 'lama policy') by the Fifth, Thirteen and Fourteenth Dalai Lamas and the negative consequences of this for Dorje Shugden practitioners, Tibetan Buddhists in general, and others. The stated aims of the book are fourfold:
The book will be generally available from January 2010.
Other activities.
The WSS has been appealing to the general public through the media, including interviews on radio and television such as an interview on ABC Radio National in Australia on 11 June 2008 and television also in Australia to investigate what they claim are social injustices being carried out against Dorje Shugden practitioners within the Tibetan exile community and elsewhere.
The group have also set up an account on the video sharing website YouTube to promote the activities of the WSS including WSS-made video coverage. The WSS are also using political means to further their campaign. A House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee Human Rights report in July 2008 contained a letter from Kelsang Pema under her lay name, calling for help to gain freedom from religious discrimination and which confirmed that the WSS would be seeking help from each member of the United Nations Council, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, the President of the United States, the President of France, the President of Russia and the President of the People's Republic of China. The WSS have also set up an online petition to the Dalai Lama, asking him to give religious freedom.
A decade ago, in 1997, at the height of the Dorje Shugden controversy, Robert Thurman claimed: "It would not be unfair to call Shugdens the Taliban of Tibetan Buddhism," referring to the Muslim extremists of Afghanistan. challenging Thurman to justify his 10-year-old claim: "You should show your evidence publicly through the internet before 25 October 2008. If your evidence does not appear by this date then we will conclude that you have lied publicly and are misleading people." As of November 2009, there has been no response by Thurman on his website.
Western Shugden Society and the New Kadampa Tradition.
There have been claims that the WSS is organised and run by the NKT. However, during the 2008 International Spring Festival the Spiritual Director of the NKT, Kelsang Gyatso, explained that in order for the NKT itself to be a part of the WSS, the board of Directors would have had to vote on it. A vote, though, never took place as the NKT itself states that it is not directly participating in the activities of the WSS. Individual Dorje Shugden practitioners from the NKT have joined the WSS in their capacity as Dorje Shugden practitioners. Any involvement by the NKT directly in the politics of Dorje Shugden would represent a u-turn, after Geshe Kelsang Gyatso said in an open letter in 2002: 
The WSS does not deny that prominent NKT students have taken part in the demonstrations in their capacity as concerned Dorje Shugden practitioners. Both the NKT and the WSS state that no NKT funds have been used to fund the activities of the WSS, but that WSS activities have been funded by donations from both Westerners and Tibetans, with some, they claim but by no means all, from individual NKT practitioners acting in their private capacity. Also, whilst many of the demonstrators are NKT members, some have come from other Tibetan Buddhist groups in the West such as Dagom Tensung Ling and Gaden Samdrupling in the United States.
Perception of the protests by others within the Buddhist community.
Following the demonstrations in Sydney, Australia, the Australian Sangha Association (ASA) issued an official statement in which they said that "Noisy public demonstrations such as these are not appropriate behaviour for monks and nuns and brought Buddhism in the country into disrepute". They added that they recognized there is a difference of opinion with the Dalai Lama on various issues, and that it is the right of NKT and WSS members to disagree with the Dalai Lama's opinions, but that their disagreement should be expressed in a peaceful, respectful and reasonable manner. On 11 August 2008, the WSS responded to the ASA stating that the WSS protests were peaceful and giving several examples from the 1990s and the present-day where Dalai Lama supporters were not peaceful in attacking Shugden protestors.
Response to the protests by third parties.
In the United States, the protestors' constitutionally guaranteed right to free speech was ensured by state and local police and governments. The police liaised with the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, the security and law enforcement arm of the United States Department of State.
Time Magazine reported on July 19, 2008:
Tibet scholar Robert Barnett of Columbia University opposes how he was quoted by Time magazine's correspondent David van Biema. He states that he made very clear to him that "ID cards are not given out by the exile administration, but by the Indian authorities". According to Barnett:
The WSS agree that the practice has been banned in monasteries, but reply that Barnett's other claims are unfounded: there is no Pope of Buddhism, the Dalai Lama himself is the one abusing the so-called "non-believers", relying upon Wisdom Buddha Dorje Shugden is not spirit worship and his practitioners are not sectarian, and the reason for "provoking" publicity is to help restore religious freedom amongst Tibetans in exile, not for its own sake.
Claims about 4 million Shugden followers made in reports by France 24 and Al Jazeera were rejected by scholars. Journalist Andy Brown comments:
Other groups protesting the ban on Dorje Shugden.
In May 2008, a similar demonstration was held in India, although not by the WSS. The founder of Kundeling Monastery, Lobsang Yeshe, who lives in South India, has filed a complaint against the Dalai Lama at the Indian High Court on the grounds of religious persecution. The prosecuting lawyer, Shree Sanjay Jain, says:
The Tibetan Government in Exile accuse Lobsang Yeshe of being paid by the Chinese and state that he has visited China at least twice. He however denies working for the Chinese, but does confirm that he has Chinese friends and he praises the Chinese "for what they are doing in Tibet", claiming that if Tibetans who followed Dorje Shugden had to live under the Dalai Lama in Tibet, they "would have possibly been crucified." He has also made similar comparisons to that of the WSS about the treatment of Dorje Shugden practitioners and the treatment of Jews in 1930s Germany as well as religious apartheid.
The Dorje Shugden Devotee's Charitable & Religious Society (DSDCRS) based in the Tibetan settlement of Majnu Ka Tila, Delhi, India have presented appeals to the Dalai Lama, The DSDCRS also held a Press Conference on 29 April 2008 in New Delhi to publicly express their concerns about perceived persecution by the Tibetan exile community.

Hirt's law

Hirt's law, named after Hermann Hirt who postulated it originally in 1895, is a Balto-Slavic sound law which states in its modern form that the inherited Proto-Indo-European stress would retract to non-ablauting pretonic vowel or a syllabic sonorant if it was followed by a consonantal (non-syllabic) laryngeal that closed the preceding syllable.
Compare:
Hirt's law did not operate if the laryngeal preceded a vowel, or if the laryngeal followed the second component of a diphthong. Therefore, Hirt's law must be older than then the loss of laryngeals in prevocalic position (in glottalic theory formulation: to the merger of glottalic feature of PIE voiced stops who dissolved into laryngeal and buccal part with the reflexes of the original PIE laryngeals), because the stress was not retracted in e.g. * (Ancient Greek "tanaós", Sanskrit "tanú") "thin" > Latvian "tiêvs", and also older than the loss of syllabic sonorants in Balto-Slavic, as can be seen from the abovementioned reflexes of PIE *, and also in e.g. PIE * "long" (compare Sanskrit "dīrghá", Ancient Greek "dolikhós") > Lithuanian "ìlgas", Latvian "il̃gs", Croatian/Serbian "dȕg".
It follows from the above that Hirt's law must have preceded Winter's law, but was necessarily posterior to Balto-Slavic oxytonesis (shift of stress from inner syllable to the end of the word in accent paradigms with end-stressed forms), because oxytonesis-originating accent was preserved in non-laryngeal declension paradigms; e.g. the retraction occurs in mobile *eh₂-stems so thus have dative plural of Slovene "goràm" and Chakavian "goràmi" (< PBSl. *-eh₂mús), locative plural of Slovene and Chakavian "goràh" (< PBSl. *-eh₂sú), but in thematic (o-stem) paradigm dative plural of Slovene "možȇm" (< PBSl. *-mús), locative plural of Slovene "možéh" and Chakavian "vlāsíh" (< PBSl. *-oysú). The retraction of accent from the ending to the vowel immediately preceding the stem-ending laryngeal (as in PBSl. reflex of PIE *) is obvious. There is also a strong evidence that the same was valid for Old Prussian (in East Baltic dative and locative plural accents were generalized in non-laryngeal inflections).
From the Proto-Indo-European perspective, the importance of Hirt's law lies in the strong correspondence it provides between the Balto-Slavic and Vedic/Ancient Greek accentuation (which more or less intactly reflects the original PIE state), and somewhat less importantly, provides a reliable criterion to distinguish the original sequence of *eH from lengthened grade *ē, as it unambiguously points to the presence of a laryngeal in the stem.

Need U Bad

"Need U Bad" is a song performed by American recording artist Jazmine Sullivan from her debut album, "Fearless" (2008). The song features rapper Missy Elliott, as well as Pepa speaking a Jamaican chant. "Need U Bad" is Sullivan's debut single and the lead single from "Fearless". It was first released on May 13, 2008 in the United States by J and Arista Records. The song was co-written by Sullivan in collaboration with Elliott, Cainon Lamb, and Taurian Osbourne. It was produced by Elliott and Lamb. The song uses a sample from Nicolas Taylor Stanton's "Higher Meditation Riddim Version", and Tapper Zukie's "Papa Big Shirt".
"Need U Bad" was one of two songs on "Fearless" where Sullivan collaborated with Elliott and Lamb. Musically, the song was inspired to be different to typical mainstream singles. Featuring prominent elements of reggae, R&B and soul music characteristics, the track was composed in a different style to co-relate with the title of its parent album, "Fearless". Lyrically, "Need U Bad" takes reference to a situation when one develops a strong need for one's lover.
"Need U Bad" garnered a positive response from contemporary music critics. The single also achieved R&B chart success; peaking at number one on U.S. "Billboard" Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs, and at number thirty-seven on the "Billboard" Hot 100. It is Sullivan's most successful single on "Billboard" Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs to-date.
"Need U Bad" was accompanied by a music video which was directed by Jonathan Mannion and released on July 8, 2008. The old school styled video features Sullivan singing and dancing with Missy Elliott and other reggae musicians in a recording studio. Sullivan performed "Need U Bad" on "106 & Park", "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" and "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno". "Need U Bad" was nominated in the 'Best Female R&B Vocal Performance' category at the 51st Grammy Awards.
Background.
After meeting American rapper, Missy Elliott at the age of 13, Jazmine Sullivan and Elliott begun working on over thirty songs together. During 2006 and 2007, Sullivan spent a year recording a demo tape which included "Need U Bad". The demo tape resulted in Sullivan signing a recording deal with J Records. "Need U Bad" was chosen as Sullivan's debut single and the lead single from "Fearless". Sullivan revealed in an interview with music website, Urban Connectionz Online, that it made sense for her to release the song as her first single because of the connection and vibe between Missy Elliott and herself. The song was also chosen because of how different it was to songs on the radio at the time. Sullivan saw releasing a song with a reggae fusion vibe as a risk and that the risk would tie in with its parent album's title, "Fearless".
Reception.
Critical reception.
Michael Cragg of musicOMH said that "Need U Bad" saw Sullivan "tackling reggae", further saying that the track was a highlight on "Fearless" and as equally convincing as fellow album highlights "Lions, Tigers & Bears" and "Live a Lie". "Need U Bad" was also seen as an album highlight by Mark Edward Nero of About.com who described the song as a "Caribbean anthem". Andy Kellman from Allmusic deemed the track as "yearning/swaggering". Simon Vozick-Levinson of "Entertainment Weekly" reviewed the song saying it had been greeted by "a public and critical rush of adulation." Vozick-Levinson went on to say that the "great tune" and "one of the catchiest singles getting airplay at the moment" is "an uncannily Lauryn Hill-y slice of reggaefied soul."
Jeff Harvey of Okayplayer reviewed "Need U Bad" in relation to its similarity to the rest of the tracks on "Fearless", saying: "Fans of Sullivan's raw, reggae tinged single [...], may be a little put off by the prestine production and pop sensibilities of much of her album, and indeed, it is far from The Miseducation of Jazmine Sullivan that hungry L-boogie fans may have unfairly hoped for." Joey Guerra of the "Houston Chronicle" mentioned that "reggae-flavoured" "Need U Bad" is a sample of Sullivan's eclectic musical approach. While Todd Martens from the "Los Angeles Times" felt that the song sees Sullivan comfortably veering into glossy mainstream territory, saying it slides from easy-listening R&B to a more clubby reggae beat. "Need U Bad" ranked at number eight on "VIBE's" 'Best Songs of '08' list. The song was nominated in the 'Best Female R&B Vocal Performance' category at the 51st Grammy Awards, losing out to Alicia Keys' "Superwoman".
Chart performance.
In the United States, "Need U Bad" debuted at number seventy-three on the "Billboard" Hot 100 on August 2, 2008. The single went on to peak at number thirty-seven and spend thirteen weeks on the chart, inevitably becoming her second most successful single on the Hot 100 behind "Bust Your Windows". The single is Sullivan's sole number one hit to-date, spending four weeks atop of the Hot R&B/Hip Hop Songs chart, and spending a total of thirty-four weeks on the chart altogether. "Need U Bad" is also Sullivan's only single to chart on the Pop 100 where it peaked at number eighty-three.
Music video.
"Need U Bad" was accompanied by a music video directed by American photographer, Jonathan Mannion. Mannion's previous music video work includes The Game's "It's Okay (One Blood)" (2006), and J. Holiday's "Bed" (2007). The video was shot on June 16, 2008, and later released on July 7, 2008. It features a cameo appearance from Missy Elliott. The video topped BET's "106 & Park" video countdown show and reached number two on AOL Music. It also ranked at number fourteen on BET's 'Notarized 2008' Top 100 video countdown.
Urban Review stated that they were really liking the music video. They felt that it adds well to the slightly 'Old School' vibe that the song already has. The blog further noted: "It obviously has broken the bank, but it's not particularly necessary when the song speaks for itself."
Remix.
The official remix features rapper T.I., additional vocals by Missy Elliott, and a new verse by Sullivan, the remix is exclusively on the website Rhapsody as a digital download and as a bonus track on the international edition of the album.

Thomas Holland (Jesuit)

Thomas Holland (b. 1600 at Sutton, Lancashire; executed at Tyburn, 12 December 1642) was an English Jesuit priest. He is a Catholic martyr, beatified in 1929 .
Life.
He was probably son of Richard Holland, gentleman, was educated at St. Omer's College and subsequently in August, 1621, went to Valladolid, where he took the missionary oath 29 December 1633. When the abortive negotiations for the "Spanish Match" were taking place in 1623, Holland was sent to Madrid to assure Prince Charles of the loyalty of the seminarists of Valladolid, which he did in a Latin oration.
In 1624 he entered the novitiate of the Society of Jesus at Watten in Southern Netherlands, and not long after was ordained priest at Liège. After serving as minister at Ghent and prefect at St. Omer's he made his final religious profession as spiritual coadjutor at Ghent (28 May 1634) and sent on the English mission the following year. He was an adept in disguising himself, and could speak perfect French, Spanish, and Flemish.
He was eventually arrested on suspicion in a London street 4 October 1642, and committed to the New Prison. He was afterwards transferred to Newgate, and arraigned at the Old Bailey, 7 December, for being a priest. There was no conclusive evidence as to this; but as he refused to swear he was not, the jury found him guilty, to the indignation of the Lord Mayor, Isaac Penington, and another member of the bench named Garroway. On Saturday, 10 December, Sergeant Peter Phesant, presumably acting for the recorder, passed sentence on him. On his return to prison Holland heard many confessions.
On Sunday and Monday he was able to say Mass in prison, and soon after his last Mass was taken off to execution. There he was allowed to make a speech and to say many prayers, and when the cart was turned away, he was left to hang till he was dead. His brethren called him "bibliotheca pietatis".

Teddy Davison

Teddy Davison (2 September 1887 – 1 February 1971) was an English footballer and manager who had a long and successful association with the football clubs of Sheffield, playing for Sheffield Wednesday for 18 years and later managing Sheffield United for 20 years. His fairness and diplomacy earned him the nicknames of "The George Washington of Sheffield football" and "Honest Ted". Davison played as a goalkeeper in a career, which lasted between 1908 and 1926, he made 424 appearances in all competitions for Sheffield Wednesday (his only league club). Davison was only 5 ft 7 in (1.70 m) tall, very small for a goalkeeper but he made up for this with lightning reflexes and top class anticipation. He has gone down in football records as the smallest goalkeeper ever to play for England, making just one appearance for the national team in March 1922.
Playing career.
Davison was born in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, the seventh of nine children. On leaving school he worked as a typesetter for a Newcastle newspaper and played football for Gateshead Town where he was spotted by Sheffield Wednesday’s assistant manager Robert Brown who invited him to Hillsborough for a trial. Davison impressed in the trial, saving a penalty in a practice match and was signed in April 1908 as understudy to long standing Wednesday keeper Jack Lyall for a fee of £300.
Sheffield Wednesday.
The 21 year old Davison made his Wednesday debut on 10 October 1908, however he only made eight appearances in that first season, being unable to dislodge Lyall. The summer of 1909 saw Lyall leave for Manchester City and Davison became first choice keeper for the 1909–10 season. Davison was to remain first choice for the next 12 seasons, a remarkable achievement bearing in mind that he lost four years of his career to World War I when official football was suspended. Throughout his career Davison kept a record of every match he played in, this showed he played in 618 games, conceding 810 goals, it also revealed he was a specialist at keeping out penalties, saving 24 out of 77 faced.
Davison volunteered for the army during World War I and was sent to France in July 1916, serving with the Royal Field Artillery for the rest of the war. He did make two wartime appearances for Wednesday when he was home on leave. He returned safely from the war to make 20 appearances in the 1919–20 season as Wednesday were relegated from Division One, sharing goalkeeping duties with Arnold Birch. Davison became first choice keeper again the following season.
He was called up to the England team to face Wales on 13 March 1922 in the British Home Championship at Anfield and kept a clean sheet in a 1–0 win. He was also picked eight times for Sheffield’s representative side and toured Australia with the FA in 1925. Davison remained first choice keeper until the 1924–25 season when Jack Brown threatened and eventually took over his place in the team. The 38 year old Davison failed to make an appearance in Wednesday’s Division Two championship winning side in 1925–26 and his days at Hillsborough were coming to an end.
Management.
Mansfield Town.
In June 1926 he accepted the offer to become player/manager/secretary of Mansfield Town who at that time were a non-league side playing in the Midland League. In his first season in charge Mansfield had a good season winning the Notts Senior Cup, he impressed as a manager with the way he went about his business and getting the team to play attacking football. He continued playing until January 1927 when a broken rib in a game against Newark Town forced him to end his playing career. Davidson’s management style had impressed near neighbours Chesterfield and when they were looking for a replacement for Alec Campbell they did not bother to advertise but went straight for Davison.
Chesterfield.
Davison was appointed Chesterfield manager on 2 January 1928 at a wage of £6 a week. He immediately reorganised the club making clear divisions between the administrative and playing sides and bringing in experienced players such as Sid Binks. An improvement in results followed culminating in winning the Third Division North championship in 1930–31 with the team securing the championship on the last day of the season, scoring eight goals against Gateshead, Davison’s home town club. Davison consolidated Chesterfield’s position in Division Two the following season continuing to bring in experienced players such as ex England international George Ashmore, he also established a scouting network in his native north east to bring in young players. Davison had become one of the most talented and well organised managers around and it was no surprise when he was offered the newly created position of secretary/manager at Sheffield United in June 1932 as a replacement for the legendary John Nicholson who had been killed in a traffic accident earlier in the year after being Blades secretary for 33 years.
Sheffield United.
Davison’s first season at United saw them finish a respectable 10th in Division One, but the next season (1933–34) was a disaster as United were relegated for the first time in their history. The following season had The Blades in a mid table finishing position in Division Two although Davison had made the excellent signing of Jock Dodds on a free transfer from Lincoln City. United reached the 1936 FA Cup Final losing to Arsenal 1–0, the cup run probably cost the team promotion as they finished three points behind runners up Charlton Athletic. United eventually returned to Division One in the last full season before World War II finishing runners up and denying rivals Wednesday by one point. That 1938–39 season is notable for Davison as he made the purchase of Jimmy Hagan for £2,500 in November 1938, probably his best ever signing.
Davison remained in charge at Bramall Lane throughout the war years, with the team winning the Football League North in 1945–46. The return to peace time football saw United relegated from Division One in 1948–49 and then denied an immediate return the following season by city rivals Wednesday on goal average. Two mid table finishes and a failure to get a quick return to Division One saw Davison resign as United manager in August 1952.
Return to Chesterfield.
Davison was not out of a job for long as he was immediately offered his old job as manager of Chesterfield who had just parted company with Bobby Marshall. Davison once again tried his formula of signing experienced players, with Dennis Westcott and Cyril Hatton arriving at Saltergate amongst others. He had to endure severe financial constraints with the club only being able to afford 14 full-time professionals. Despite this the team challenged for promotion, finishing sixth in Division Three North four seasons in succession. Davison’s youth policy also saw fruition when the youth team reached the final of the FA Youth Cup in 1956 with future World Cup winner Gordon Banks one of the stars. He was asked to manage the Third Division North side against the South in April 1957. Davison stepped down as Chesterfield manager in May 1958, at the age of 71, however he did continue to do some scouting for the club.
After finally retiring, Teddy spent his latter years in Sheffield, passing away in February 1971 at the age of 83. His legacy is that he probably made the biggest individual impact on Sheffield football of any person in history.

Institute for US and Canadian Studies

Institute for US and Canadian Studies (Russian: Институт США и Канады РАН, "Institut SShA i Kanadi RAN") - is a Russian think tank which is part of the Russian Academy of Sciences, specializing on the comprehensive studies of the United States and Canada. 
ISKRAN was founded by Dr. Georgy Arbatov in 1967 who led the institute until 1995. Since that time it has been the main Soviet and later Russian center of research of American and Canadian foreign and internal policy.
ISKRAN in 1967-1991.
ISKRAN played important role in Soviet foreign policy decision making process. Its specialists were responsible for providing unbiased information to Soviet top leaders on the economies, political, military development of the United States. ISKRAN also included a PhD department which provided highly competitive scholarships for American studies. 
ISKRAN specialists were among the architects of Soviet detente policy and later assisted Soviet leaders in preparing all major Arms control deals with the United States. The head of the Institute Dr. Arbatov was personal adviser to Brezhnev, Andropov, Chernenko and Gorbachev.
Since ISKRAN specialists had direct access to the data from the Western bloc, they managed to overcome ideological barriers and to understand better the internal situation in the Soviet Union and the communist bloc in late 1970s - early 1980s. Thus ISKRAN was one of the major Soviet Institutes who initiated and supported Gorbachev policy of Perestroika in 1985.
ISKRAN after 1991.
ISKRAN remained one of the leading Russian think tanks after the Collapse of the Soviet Union. It continued its studies of international political, economic and military issues. ISKRAN retained its functions of political and economic consultations of major Russian government bodies.
Currently the institute is headed by Sergey Rogov. 
The Institute arranges conferences, work-shops, debates on major issues of international relations. Many Russian and foreign scholars and policymakers give their lectures in ISKRAN. Some of Russian prominent policy makers studied or worked in ISKRAN.
Journal "USA-Canada: economics, politics, culture".
The institutes continues to publish monthly Journal "USA-Canada: economics, politics, culture" which was founded in 1970. The Journal is one of the leading Russian foreign policy magazines. It has a strong reputation of thoughtful, analytical and unbiased articles by major Russian scholars and PhD students.
Currently the institute is headed by Sergey Rogov. 
In 2007 ISKRAN was included in the list of the world leading think-tanks.

Ucuhuba seed oil is the oil extracted from the seed of "Virola surinamensis" (ucuhuba). The ucuhuba tree grows in South America. Its seeds provide oil rich in myristic acid. The ucuhuba oil contains 13% lauric acid, 69% myristic acid, 7% palmitic acid and traces of oleic acid and linoleic acid. Myristic and lauric acids comprised 91.3 mole % of the total fatty acids. Although additional saturated fatty acids were found (decanoic acid, palmitic acid, and stearic acid), they occurred only as minor components. Small amounts of several unsaturated fatty acids were found including 2.4% oleic acid and 0.4% linoleic acid.

Lihnida kajče veslaše

Lihnida kajče veslaše (, "Lihnida rowed a rowboat") is a Macedonian newly composed folk song. It tells the story of a bereaved woman rowing on Lake Ohrid, and her brief discussion with fishermen (described as "old friends"). They promise that they will calm the waves should they make any, but she replies that she wants them to stop worrying about it, and to leave her and the lake in peace. 
The music was composed by Efto Pupinoski and the text was written by Miroslav Kuzman for the 1986 "Folk Fest Valandovo" (a music festival for newly composed Macedonian folk music held in Valandovo) where it was performed by Efto Pupinoski who won first place. The song would soon after be translated to Serbo-Croatian and released as a cover version by Serbian singer Miki Jevremović under the title "Lihnida". In 1994, Bulgarian singer Panajot Panajotov performed "Ohridskoto ezero" (, "Lake Ohrid"), a song with the same melody, theme and motifs but with the text adapted to Bulgarian by Živko Kolev. 
"Lihnida" (from Greek "Λυχνιτίδα") is an ancient name for the city Ohrid and its lake.

North Hollywood Shootout is American jam band Blues Traveler's tenth studio album, released on August 26, 2008, and produced by David Bianco, a 1996 Grammy winner. In a notable departure from previous Blues Traveler releases, the album includes a spoken word piece featuring Bruce Willis.
This album marked the band's return to Universal Music Group, which owns their previous label A&M Records, and also their current label, Verve Forecast Records (along with the catalog of Sanctuary Records, another label the band was on at one point).
History.
During early writing and production of this album, the members of Blues Traveler began to experiment with re-arrangements of various older songs, and put this album on hold to record "Cover Yourself" for their twentieth anniversary. The recording sessions for the two albums were held back-to-back.
Track listing.
Early reports cite the disc as having 11 tracks, but the supposedly official track listing released to amazon.com had only 10 tracks listed on it. However, a later version of the track listing released on the Barnes and Noble website included the supposedly missing 11th track (apparently track 10), "The Landing," along with a 30 second sample of the song. "The Landing" eventually became an iTunes exclusive song.

Adrien-Jean Le Mayeur

Adrien-Jean Le Mayeur de Merpres (9 February 1880 – 31 May 1958) was a Belgian painter from Brussels who lived the last part of his life in Bali.
Biography.
Adrien came to Bali at Singaraja by boat in 1932. He then stayed in Denpasar
Le Mayeur and was fascinated by what remained then of Balinese culture, including the Balinese people's traditional way of life, the temple rituals and local dances. He was also impressed by the light, color and beauty of the surroundings in the then still quite unspoilt island.
Le Mayeur rented a house in "banjar" Kelandis, Denpasar, where he got acquainted with 15-year-old legong dancer, Ni Nyoman Pollok, known by her nickname Ni Pollok , who later on became Le Mayeur's model for his paintings.
A number of Le Mayeur's Bali works using Ni Pollok as model were exhibited in Singapore for the first time in 1933, which turned to be a very successful exhibition and made him more widely known. Returning from Singapore, Le Mayeur bought a piece of land at Sanur beach and built a house. At this house, which was also Le Mayeur's studio, Ni Pollok with her two friends worked every day as models. The beauty and splendid figure of Ni Pollok had made Le Mayeur enjoy his stay in Bali. At first he intended to stay only for 8 months, but later on he decided to stay in the island for the rest of his life.
After three years working together, in 1935, Le Mayeur and Pollok got married. Le Mayeur kept on painting with his wife as his model during their married life. During the Japanese occupation of Indonesia in World War II Le Mayeur was put under house arrest by the Japanese authorities. He continued painting, however, often painting on rice sack cloth and other surfaces he could find. After the war Le Mayeur's reputation grew at steady pace.
Years after the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence, Bahder Djohan, the Indonesian Minister for Education and Culture visited Le Mayeur and Ni Pollok at their house in 1956. He was greatly impressed with the painter's work and therefore suggested to the couple that their house and all its contents should be preserved as a museum. Le Mayeur agreed to the idea and since then he worked harder to add more collections to the house and to increase the quality of his works as well.
At last, Le Mayeur's dream came true that on 28 August 1957 a Deed of Conveyance Number 37 was signed, stating that Le Mayeur had given all his possessions including the land, his house with all its contents to Ni Pollok as a gift. And at the same moment, Ni Pollok then conveyed what she had inherited from her husband to the Government of Indonesia to be used as a museum.
In 1958 Le Mayeur suffered from a severe ear cancer, and accompanied by Ni Pollok he returned to Belgium to have a medical treatment. After two months in Belgium, on 31 May 1958 the 78-year old painter died and was buried in Ixelles, Brussels. Ni Pollok then returned home to take care of her house which had become the Le Mayeur Museum. She stayed there until her death on 18 July 1985 at the age of 68.
Le Mayeur and Ni Pollok's home is kept in its original condition and is still a museum where about 80 of Le Mayeur's works are exhibited, as well as his collection of traditional Balinese art and local artifacts.

To Retire

To Retire (Το Ρετιρέ) was a very popular Greek sitcom that aired in 1990 from the Greek channel Mega. It was written and directed by Yiannis Dalianidis and it lasted two years.
Characters.
The main character is Katerina Sofianou, played by the famous Katerina Gioulaki. Katerina is a divorced, nervous lady that lives with her mother Sofia and her niece Eirini. She wants to get married again but her family does not like the groom.
The other characters are Katerina's friend and colleagues: Haroula, Iason, Eleni, Foivos etc.
Plot.
The idea of this sitcom is about the everyday life of modern Greeks; their habits, their problems, their affairs. Katerina wants to get married but Sofia hates the groom. Eirini wants to buy a new video recorder but Katerina thinks that is too expensive. Foivos loves Haroula but she does not see him as a lover. All the stories take place in Athens of the early '90s.
Similarities.
A few years after To Retire, Yiannis Dalianidis wrote and directed a new sitcom, Oi Mikromesaioi which was a total copy of his previous work. But still, To Retire was not original either. In the late '80s Dalianidis had written a sitcom about modern Greeks and their problems, titled Odos Antheon, which in many ways is similar to both of his following creations.
Success.
To Retire was actually a big hit and it is one of the most popular Greek sitcoms. Every summer it is aired again and again on Mega. In the 2008 summer, the sitcom experienced another rerun, also with success. The average rates were 17%, which is very good, especially if you consider that the American sitcom Ugly Betty reached 8% when it is aired on the same time with To Retire.

Alusuisse

Alusuisse was a swiss industrial group founded as Aluminium Industrie Aktien in 1898 in Zurich, Swizterland. The organisation was named Schweizerische Aluminium AG from 1963, Alusuisse-Lonza Holding AG from 1990, and Algroup from 1998.
From the 1900s became a significant employer in the Valais canton through its aluminum production activities; a byproduct of the aluminium production process: fluorine became the subject of a pollution scandal (" guerre du fluor") after its public reporting in the 1970s. In the late 1960s the company also became involved in another contentious public issue through its joint venture Nabalco which was developing a bauxite deposit in northern Australia on land claimed by the indigenous people of that area; leading to the Gove land rights case.
By the end of the twentieth century the company had become an international firm with interests in aluminium production, packaging, and chemicals (through the firm Lonza acquired 1974, divested 1999), and employed over 30,000 worldwide (1997).
The group was acquired by Alcan on 18 October 2000.
History.
In 1886 Paul-Louis-Toussaint Héroult and Charles Martin Hall independently discovered a process for producing metallic aluminium from aluminium ore by electrolysis (Hall–Héroult process). In 1889 Paul-Louis-Toussaint Héroult, Gustave Naville, Georg Neher, and Peter Emil Huber established a company "Aluminium Industrie Aktien Gesellschaft" (AIAG) in Zurich, Switzerland to extract aluminium, creating the first aluminium production plant in Europe. It established plants in Neuhausen am Rheinfall in 1888, in Rheinfelden, Germany in 1898 and in Lend, Austria in 1899.
In 1899 the company started to invest in the Valais region of Swizterland which was rich in hydropower resources. The company built a plant in Chippis (1908) using hydropower from the river Navisence. The market for their aluminium did not meet expectations and the company began to use some of the electrical production for nitric acid manufacture (Birkeland–Eyde process); during the Great Depression the company sold electricity from its plants to municipal customers. A rolling mill was established in Sierre in 1929. In the 1950s the company acquired a concession to 30% of the flow from the dam built at the Lac de Moiry, and constructed a factory at Ernen. A factory in Steg was established in 1962. The company became a major employer in the Valais region, employing over 3000 in 1942, by 1970 the approximately 2000 were employed in the canton.
In 1963 the enterprise was renamed "Schweizerische Aluminium AG". In the 1970s pollution due to fluorine by aluminium producers including Alusuisse caused scandal in Swizterland which came to be known as the "guerre du fluor" (Fluorine war).
In 1969 the company invested in a large aluminium smelter in the Gove Peninsula, Australia, through the joint venture Nabalco, The development which included the creation of a sea harbour, housing for 5000 people, and was worth over 1billion swiss francs. The Nabalco consortium was made to pay rent on the land used to the indigenous peoples of the area as a result of the ruling of the Milirrpum v Nabalco Pty Ltd (Gove land rights) case.
During the 1960s the company began to license its aluminium production technology, and in 1967 helped to establish Koninklijke Hoogovens' first aluminium smelter in 1967.
In 1974 the company took over the Swiss-German company Lonza (founded 1897), which specialised in hydropower, construction, and electrochemical industrial production. In 1990 the company became "Alusuisse-Lonza Holding AG". In 1999 the chemical production interests were split off to form the chemical company Lonza Group.
The company's aluminium production reached its maximum in 1980 at over 800,000 t. During the 1980s the company restructured, closing outdated plants, and downsized, and modernised its semi-finished aluminium production facilities. It also acquired the Canadian packaging company Lawson Mardon Group in 1994, and merged it into its packaging division.
In 1997 the company employed 31,000 of which 5,800 were Swiss. The company was renamed "Algroup" in 1998 and was merged into Alcan in 2000.

String Quartet No. 7 (Simpson)

The String Quartet No. 7 by Robert Simpson was composed during 1977 and was dedicated to Lady Jeans (Susi Jeans, the organist) who requested the work. The Gabrieli String Quartet gave the first performance at a concert in Jeans’ home, Cleveland Lodge, Dorking, during a concert celebrating the centenary of her husband, the astronomer and mathematician Sir James Jeans. Simpson, himself a keen astronomer, draws parallels between this work and the universe – quiet and mysterious yet pulsating with energy. This quartet has become one of the most frequently heard of Simpson’s quartets.
The work falls into three distinct sections albeit in one movement. The opening section is marked Tranquillo, and begins quietly with the first violin sounding the note D which is joined by an upward moving line. By this means the vastness of space is evoked, and this whole first section develops slowly but purposefully in an organic way. Simpson likened the control of the music throughout this quartet to gravitation in space, particularly in regards to the open strings of the instruments, all of which are tuned in fifths.
The second section is a Vivace of around the same length, and from this point onwards the music becomes steadily more vigorous and energetic, with running triplet lines and further development of the material of the opening section. This Vivace culminates in a huge, intense climax which is the climax of the whole work – this restates the opening idea in a very different context and heralds the beginning of the final section, marked Tempo Primo.
Eventually the climax subsides, and the tranquillity of the opening is returned, now with the addition of rising scales among the counterpoint which give the effect of the music floating into space as it fades into silence.
A typical performance of this work lasts 18 to 20 minutes.

Currently, the only commercially available CD is a Hyperion Records release which also includes String Quartet No. 8, both performed by the Delme Quartet .

Rúben Lima

Rúben Alexandre Rocha Lima (born 3 October 1989 in Lisbon) is a Portuguese football player who plays for Dinamo Zagreb as a left defender and rarely as a defensive midfielder.
Club career.
Early career.
A product of hometown S.L. Benfica's youth system, Lima was promoted to the first team for 2007–08. In January 2008 however he, alongside teammates Miguel Vítor and Romeu Ribeiro, was loaned to Clube Desportivo das Aves in the second division, with the move being extended for the entire 2008–09.
Lima moved to Vitória de Setúbal for the 2009–10 season, in the same predicament. He made his top level debut on 17 August 2009, playing the full 90 minutes in a 0–0 home draw against Vitória de Guimarães and eventually appearing in 24 of the league's 30 games (22 starts) as the "Sadinos" barely avoided relegation. After his contract with Benfica ended, Lima signed for S.C. Beira-Mar, freshly returned to the top division.
Hajduk Split.
In June 2011 he moved abroad for the first time in his career, joining HNK Hajduk Split in the Croatian top-flight Prva HNL, quickly becoming a first-choice player at his new club, playing in left-back position, a team's position which had lacked in consistency ever since the departure of Ivan Strinić to FC Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk.
Under the management of Krasimir Balakov, Lima became a first-team regular in the 2011-12 Prva HNL Hajduk team. Many considered him to be one of the best, if not the best left-back in the league at that time. Rúben Lima made his European debut against Stoke City in the 2011-12 UEFA Europa League campaign. He rejoined Hajduk during the 2012–13 Prva HNL season, having previously left the club's summer pre-season preparations in Kupres. Lima would once again prove to be a key player for Hajduk. As the season progressed, Hajduk manager Mišo Krstičević used him also as a defensive midfielder or central defender, a fact that is perfectly underlining Lima's high versatility on the pitch. In May 2013, Lima was part of the Hajduk team which won the Croatian Cup title. After his contract had expired, he decided to leave Hajduk at the end of the season. In his last league match for Hajduk he was given the captain's armband to lead the team on the pitch as a farewell present.
Dinamo Zagreb.
On 24 July 2013, it was confirmed that Lima decided to join Hajduk Split's fierce rivals, Dinamo Zagreb, for an undisclosed fee.

String Quartet No. 8 (Simpson)

The String Quartet No. 8 by Robert Simpson was composed in 1979 in response to a commission by the Brunel Philharmonic Society with funds made available from the Greater London Arts Association. The work is dedicated to Professor Gillett, who was the director of Biological Sciences at Brunel University in 1980, and his wife. The Quartet was first performed on 21 June 1980 by the Delme String Quartet at Brunel University.
The work is composed of four movements:
"# Grave, molto intensivo
The quartet opens with an austere melody from the first violin which comprises the main subject of the predominately fugal first movement. In turn, the melody is taken up by all four instruments and then developed by metamorphosis throughout the rest of the movement. This subject also forms an integral part of the rest of the quartet. The interval of a perfect fifth in particular plays a vital role of the concentrated construction of the entire work. The intensity of the fugue is mitigated at times by more reflective material. As the fugue develops, power and energy is gained until a climax is reached with scurrying motion of the viola and cello. Hereafter the music becomes calmer and the movement ends peacefully.
The second movement is a very short scherzo, illustrating a mosquito (hence the title of the movement, Eretmapodites gilletti, a species discovered by and named after the work’s dedicatee). This scherzo is in A-B-A form.
The third movement too is muted strings and consisting entirely of elusive half-shades. It is cast in a very small-scale sonata form, and the dynamic seldom rises from a soft pp (a musical term meaning "very soft").
The tumultuous and intense finale balances out the extended opening movement. It is the same length as the opening movement, but the texture is not fugal. Pungency rather than speed creates the intensity, and throughout there is a very deliberate quality to the writing which quite unique. Unlike the first movement where the calmer, reserved music prevailed, in the finale the concentrated energy prevails, with scales of all kinds evolving from the texture as the movement closes vigorously.
A typical performance of this work lasts approximately 30 minutes.
Discography.
Currently, the only commercially available CD is a Hyperion Records release which also includes String Quartet No. 7, both performed by the Delme Quartet.

Abbé Jules

"L'Abbé Jules (Abbé Jules") is a novel written by the French journalist, novelist and playwright Octave Mirbeau, and published by Ollendorff in 1888.
Plot summary.
After reading Dostoïevsky, Mirbeau plumbs the depths of psychology to describe a Catholic priest, Jules Dervelle, whose body and mind are rebelling against social oppression and the corruption of the Catholic Church.
An indictment of the dreary materialism of provincial French society, where life is governed by cupidity and closed-mindedness, Octave Mirbeau’s 1888 novel, "L'Abbé Jules" also offers an indictment of the repressive institutions of family and religion. Object of his neighbors’ fearful curiosity, the novel's eponymous hero, Jules Dervelle, constitutes, for the author, a vehicle for exploring the mysteries of the human psyche, the abuses of religion, and the human longing for the transcendental and the sacred.
Returning to his native village of Viantais after a six-year absence in Paris, Jules revolutionizes his countrymen with his scandalous behavior and unorthodox religious views. Consenting to tutor his young nephew, Albert Dervelle – whom Mirbeau uses as an uncorrupted and innocent narrator – Jules exposes his ideas on sexuality, education, and man’s « quest for an ideal ». 
Retrospective narrative allows Mirbeau to recount Jules's past, his introduction into the priesthood, and the scandalous behavior resulting in his subsequent exile to a remote parish. After his repatriation in Viantais, Jules installs himself in an overgrown country estate, where he delights in the unspoiled simplicity of nature. Wishing to instill in Albert the artlessness of animals, Jules instructs his young charge to throw away his books. He advises Albert that it is easier to « fabricate a Jesus or Mohammed » than it is to dismantle the adulterated social being that each individual has become so that can return to the original purity of his status as a “Nothing.”
Jules is a self-contradictory and self-loathing character. He is a bibliomaniac who despises the artificiality of the knowledge found in books ; when he comes to finagle from Père Pamphile – an old Trinitarian monk, who is both a double and the opposite of Jules – money he needs for his library, Pamphile indignantly refuses. He is an enemy of Catholicism, but he yearns for an experience of the divine. 
Through Jules and Pamphile, two rich and complex characters, the author elaborates his evolving views on the social evils that pervert man's instincts, artistic sensibilities, and spiritual yearnings for the absolute.
Robert Ziegler : « For the most part, the message of Mirbeau's novel is a negative one, aimed at exposing the imposture perpetuated by doctors, judges, educators and priests, demantling the symbolic systems that culture creates. Mirbeau's text designates literature as repository of meaning. »

Antonio Caponigro

Antonio Rocco Caponigro (January 22, 1912 - April 18, 1980), also known as Tony Bananas, was the consigliere of Angelo Bruno in the Bruno crime family. He is known for ending the peaceful Bruno regime by ordering his murder over a dispute concerning the methamphetamine trade.
Early life.
Caponigro was born in Chicago, Illinois on June 22, 1912. He operated out of the Ironbound neighborhood of Newark, New Jersey. As a made member of the Philadelphia crime family in the 1950s and 1960s he became a recognized crime figure after being identified by mob turncoat Joseph Valachi in 1963. During that time he served under capo Riccardo Biondi. He was the son of a wealthy banana merchant who owned and managed a stand at the Italian Market, otherwise known as the South 9th Street Curb Market.
He lived in Short Hills, New Jersey. He had a wife, Kathleen who died in 1991. He also had a half sister by the name of Susan who had a daughter out of wedlock by the name of Teresa. Susan Caponigro married Alfred Salerno. In 1955, Susan at age 38 (approximately) was found dead. It was believed that she was murdered but the murder was covered up and classified as death by myocardial infarction. Connected wiseguys in the neighborhood believed that Freddy Salerno, with the okay of Susan's brother, Caponigro, murdered his wife Susan.
Rise to power.
He rose in rank to become the consigliere during the 1970s. Caponigro foresaw the end of the peaceful Angelo Bruno regime and decided to put the task upon himself to hasten it. Indictments for racketeering were being brought against the ailing Angelo, and there was no leadership in the methamphetamine industry. Caponigro knew that he could count on the support of several key members of Bruno's administration after the don died. 
Accordingly, Caponigro traveled to New York City to consult his friend Frank Tieri, from the Genovese crime family. Caponigro controlled a lucrative numbers operation in Newark, a holdover from the 1960s when the New York families had ceded parts of North Jersey to the Philadelphia crime family. Tieri also had activities in the area, and he had challenged Caponigro's incursion. Caponigro appealed the territorial dispute to The Commission, which, acting on Bruno's recommendation, ruled in favor of Caponigro. Caponigro approached Tieri with a plan to murder Bruno and take over the Philadelphia crime family. Tieri assured Caponigro that he would support him before the Commission. He returned to Philadelphia believing that his planned coup was now officially sanctioned. He recruited the support of his brother-in-law Alfred Salerno (no relation to mob turncoat Joseph Salerno or mob boss Anthony Salerno) and Bruno regime capos John Simone and Frank Sindone, and ordered the assassination.
Death.
Bruno was shot several times, including once behind the right ear, and his driver John Stanfa was wounded while parked outside his Philadelphia home on March 21, 1980. When the Commission learned of Bruno's murder, Caponigro was summoned at once. He was told that the murder had not been sanctioned by the Commission, nor even considered by them. He turned helplessly to Frank Tieri, who sat in on the meeting. When he identified Tieri as the man who had authorized the murder, Tieri categorically denied it. The Commission ruled that Caponigro had murdered a Commission member without authorization, and they sentenced him to death. 
Caponigro was murdered by Joe "Mad Dog" Sullivan, a well-known mob enforcer in the Bronx, New York City. Sullivan admitted that he shot and killed Tony Bananas in an on-camera interview in 2010 on the Biography network television program "Mobsters". On April 18, 1980, Tony's body was located in the trunk of a car in the South Bronx with 14 bullet wounds and knife wounds. His mouth and anus were stuffed with money as a sign that he had been killed because he was too greedy. Tieri was later given Caponigro's lucrative numbers operations in Newark.
Aftermath.
The death of Angelo Bruno, his consigliere, and two capos threw the Philadelphia crime family wide open. With New York's blessing, Angelo Bruno's surviving underboss Phil Testa, was appointed the new boss. After Caponigro murdered Bruno, Scarfo could return from his appointed exile in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Testa, now free of regulations broke the honored tradition and appointed narcotics trafficker Peter Casella as underboss and Nicky Scarfo as consigliere.

<doc id="18284151" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18284151" title="String Quartet No. 9 (Simpson)">
String Quartet No. 9 (Simpson)

The String Quartet No. 9 by Robert Simpson was written in response to a commission by the Delme Quartet in 1982 to mark their 20th anniversary, one which coincided with the 250th anniversary of the birth of Joseph Haydn. Simpson was among five British composers to write works to mark this dual occasion, producing a very large set of variations on a Haydn theme, a work of some fifty-seven minutes in duration. Its first performance was given in the Wigmore Hall in London on 6 October 1982. 
Structure.
The String Quartet No. 9 consists of thirty-two variations on a theme from the minuet from Joseph Haydn's Symphony No. 47 in G, followed by a large scale fugue. An aspect of this theme worth noting is that it is a palindrome – the second half of it is the first half played backwards. Each of Simpson's thirty-two variations on this theme is also palindromic. 
There is also an overall tonal plan – the theme is in G, and so are the first fourteen variations. Variations XV to XIX descend in pitch by tones – F, E flat, D flat, B, A – regaining the original G for variations XX to XXII. From XXIII onwards the keys rise by tones from the semitone above G – A flat, B flat, C, D, E, F sharp - until G is regaining at XXIX and for the fugue. By this means all twelve tonalities are traversed.
Composition.
Simpson's variations I, II and III on Haydn's theme are all taken from a set in an earlier work from 1948, "Variations on a Theme of Haydn", for solo piano. Variation I is at the same tempo as the theme, generally lyrical and in character with occasional chromatic swells to disturb the generally sunny atmosphere. Variation II is marked Meno mosso, poco espress. and is relaxed, the dynamic level pp throughout as the music flows lyrically through gentle counterpoint. Variation III strongly contrasts with the previous variation, each of the string instruments playing short, bouncy fragments that alternate between arco and pizzicato.
Variation IV is quicker still than the previous variation, all the strings in octave unison throughout playing semiquavers, with a crescendo to the middle point of the palindrome and a decrescendo to the end. Variation V, marked Molto allegro, is more dissonant and contrapuntal, built largely on triplet motives, and the tonality is more difficult to sense. 
Variation VI is largely built up of contrapuntal lines divided by the interval of a fifth, giving a great impression of overall tonal progress, as does Variation VII which covers a similar procedure but has a different overall rhythmic character and lighter texture. Variation VIII is the harshest variation so far, built on dissonant clashes of the theme placed in parallel inversions. Variation IX is hardly less relieved, following a similar structure but different texture and rhythmic character (as did the pair of variations VI and VII). 
The texture rapidly changes for Variations X, XI, XII and XIII, all of which are each only twelve bars in length. They form a group, each of the four variations become gradually louder and more urgent than the previous one. They all assume a similar character of rustling semiquavers and an expectant mood. A climax is reached with Variation XIV, rhythmically austere and at an intense ff. The variations up to this point can be seen to have made up a "fast movement". 
This gives way to a slow movement which is made up by the broad Variations XV and XVI. The mood is contemplative and enigmatic, with a defining feature being a mysterious rise and fall of a semitone in the accompaniment of the viola melody in XV and the first violin melody in XVI. 
This slow movement then gives way to what may be termed a little scherzo, made up by Variations XVII, XVIII and XIX. The dynamic level is ppp or pp throughout, the texture subdued and buzzing like insects. After a chromatic and ferocious Variation XX, there is another slow, mysterious Variation XXI in which the theme is distributed strangely around the instruments – this can be seen to act as a kind of trio that interrupts the fast scherzo movement. The fast music returns in Variations XXII and XXIII. In Variation XXIV there is a shifting of beats and parts, where the reverse part of the palindrome actually overlaps with its original, to peculiar effect. Variation XXV is another fast variation, marked Allegro molto vivace. 
The mood changes again for Variations XXVI and XXVII which are both tuneful and relaxed, in particular XXVII which is in the ethereal key of E major. Two more contrasting variations follow, including the prestissimo Variation XXVIII and the intense Variation XXIX. 
They give way to another slow movement that is made up by Variations XXX, XXXI, XXXII and the start of the fugue. Each of these three variations gradually builds in emotion – XXX is mysterious and dark, XXXI appears to be moving towards greater light. The final variation, XXXII, is the emotional highpoint of the three, a reflective adagissimo. This moves straight into the fugue without pause.
The Fuga, lasting approximately thirteen minutes, begins with a second violin solo, announcing a sad, lyrical subject that rises and falls gently. It is then joined by the viola which plays the theme in inversion, giving the music a modal texture. For several minutes the fugue progresses with a sorrowful mood, flowing with gentle counterpoint, before building to a climax. After the climax subsides the music becomes more fragmented and there is an overall feeling of expectancy for further developments. Here, the harmonic colour changes. Although the meter does not change throughout the fugue, the overall effect is an accelerando because note values are gradually shortened. Within several minutes a more intense allegro is reached. Towards the end the two types of harmonic colour are presented simultaneously as mirror images, yet neither triumphs over the other since the images hold each other in balance. The music is eventually called home by the first violin’s insistence on the open G string – acting like the vortex of a whirlpool, irresistibly drawing all the other instruments from the musical maelstrom into itself. 
Critical reception.
The overall critical reception of this work has been very favourable. The composer and musicologist Lionel Pike described it as a "remarkable tour de force... has explored thoroughly every facet of Haydn's theme in a way which for fertile imagination, invention, and contrapuntal skill challenges comparison with the variations J S Bach wrote for Goldberg to play to the insomniac Count Kayserling." Reviewing in Tempo, David J. Brown commented that "Simpson's ideas are so characterful that their reverses almost always are not only fascinating in themselves but throw more and different light on the original forms. What might to some composers have been an intolerable strait-jacket is to him a liberating tool" and described the final "slow movement" of the quartet – Variations XXX to the first half of the fugue – as having "an intensity and wholly unsentimental depth of feeling that matches anything in the quartets of Shostakovich, to look no further." A concluding remark was made - "However, perhaps the most remarkable thing about this remarkable work is that Simpson's response to his self-imposed intellectual challenge is full of emotional power as well-mind serving heart and vice versa in a rare way."

Currently, the only commercially available CD is a Hyperion Records release performed by the Delme Quartet.

Herrschaft (territory)

In the German feudal system, a Herrschaft or Herrlichkeit (equivalent of the French term "Seigneurie") was the fiefdom of a lord, who in this area exercised his full feudal rights. A fiefdom of the king or emperor within the Holy Roman Empire was known as a Reichsstandschaft. 
If they had become a Graf or a Fürst by purchase or inheritance, they were – unlike the Reichsritter – represented in the Reichstag on the Grafenbank (counts' bench). 
An "Unterherrschaft" or "Unterherrlichkeit" was a fief whose proprietor, an "Unterherr", was more or less independent on his own estate, without however being free.

Teresa Lalor

Teresa Lalor, V.H.M. (born ca. 1769, County Laois, Ireland; d. 9 September 1846, Washington, D.C.) was an Irish immigrant to the United States, and a nun, co-foundress, with the Most Rev. Leonard Neale, S.J., the second Archbishop of Baltimore, of the Visitation Order's first monastery in the United States.
Life.
Christened Alice, she was born in County Laois, Ireland, the daughter of Denis and Catherine Lalor, but moved with her family to Ballyragget, Co Kilkenny as a child. Her childhood was spent in Ireland with her sisters. At her request, John Lanigan, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Ossory, made arrangements for her entrance into a convent of his diocese which her family opposed. She however, instead agreed to accompany her sister, Mrs. Doran and her husband, an American merchant to America, during the winter of 1794. They arrived in America on 5 January 1795."American Catholic Quarterly Review" Vol XI 1886 p. 34
Moving to Philadelphia in 1797, she became acquainted with Fr. Neale, then the pastor of St. Joseph's Church in that city, and under his direction she devoted herself to works of piety and charity with a small group of associates. The group went on to open an academy for the instruction of girls; but an epidemic of yellow fever carried off Miss Lalor's companions. Fr. Neale was transferred in 1799 from Philadelphia, to become President of Georgetown College; she also went to Georgetown, D.C., and was for a time domiciled with a small community of Poor Clares, exiled from France. On the departure of the Poor Clares from America, Neale purchased a house for Lalor and two companions to open a school of their own, a house which stood within the grounds of the later Visitation Convent, Georgetown, the oldest monastery of the Order in the U.S. 
The "pious ladies", as they were called, aspired to become Religious Sisters; Bishop Neale wished to affiliate them with the Visitation Order. The disturbed condition of affairs in Europe, due to the Napoleonic Wars, prevented this until 1816, when he obtained a grant from Pope Pius VII for the community to be considered as belonging to the Order of the Visitation. Mother Teresa and the two other Sisters were professed on the Feast of the Holy Innocents (December 26) of that same year, and became the first mother superior of the Georgetown monastery. She lived to see three other houses of the Institute founded, offshoots of the mother community: Mobile, Alabama in 1832; Kaskaskia (afterwards transferred to St. Louis), in 1833; and Baltimore, in 1837.
Death.
She died in 1846, aged around 77 years. Her remains, with those of Archbishop Neale, are interred in the crypt beneath the chapel of the monastery which they founded. She was a first cousin of Patrick "Patt" Lalor (1781-1856) (elected in 1832 as the first Catholic Member of Parliament for County Laois in two centuries) and of Joseph O'Lawlor (1768-1850), the Irish born Spanish general and military governor of Granada.

Guides Cavalry

The Guides Cavalry (Frontier Force) is an armoured regiment of the Pakistan Army which was raised in 1846 as The Corps of Guides. During more than a hundred and fifty years of glorious military service, the regiment has earned the reputation of one of the most glamorous military units in the world.
History.
The Corps of Guides was raised at Peshawar on 14 December 1846 by Lieutenant Harry Burnett Lumsden on the orders of Sir Henry Lawrence, the British Resident at Lahore, capital of the enfeebled Sikh Empire. Initially composed of a troop of cavalry and two companies of infantry mounted on camels, the Guides were organized as a highly mobile force. The corps was ordered to recruit,
These were qualities that would become the hallmark of the Guides. Although the corps recruited men from all over the country and even beyond the Frontier of India, Pathans, Punjabi Muslims, Sikhs and Dogras later formed the bulk of their manpower. 
Harry Lumsden was the perfect choice to train and lead this "corps d'elite":
Lumsden left a lasting imprint on the Guides, who soon showed their mettle in numerous frontier operations. Believing that fighting troops were for service and not for show, Lumsden introduced loose and comfortable dust-coloured uniforms for the first time, which would soon become famous as "khaki" and within decades would be adopted by most of the armies of the world. In 1851, the Guides established themselves at Mardan, which would remain their cherished home until 1938. 
In 1851, The Corps of Guides became part of the Punjab Irregular Force, which later became famous as the Punjab Frontier Force or Piffers. The Piffers consisted of five regiments of cavalry, eleven regiments of infantry and five batteries of artillery besides the Corps of Guides. Their mission was to maintain order on the Punjab Frontier; a task they performed with great aplomb during the next fifty years. 
In 1876, Queen Victoria rewarded the Guides by granting them the use of the Royal Cypher and they became Queen's Own Corps of Guides with the Prince of Wales as their Colonel. During the First World War, the cavalry and infantry of the Guides fought separately. In 1921, they were formally separated; the cavalry becoming the 10th Queen Victoria's Own Corps of Guides Cavalry (Frontier Force), while the infantry joined the newly formed 12th Frontier Force Regiment, making up the 5th and 10th (Training) Battalions of the new infantry regiment. The new class composition of Guides Cavalry was Punjabi Muslims, Sikhs and Dogras. The regiment retained its drab uniform with red facings. Their badge consisted of the 'VR' Cypher of Queen Victoria within the Garter, Victorian crown above, surrounded by a ribbon-scroll reading 'Queen Victoria's Own Corps of Guides'. In 1927, the regiment's designation was changed to The Guides Cavalry (10th Queen Victoria's Own Frontier Force).
On the Partition of India in 1947, Guides Cavalry was allotted to Pakistan. The Dogras were exchanged with Punjabi Muslims of the Hodson's Horse, while the Sikhs were exchanged with the Kaimkhanis of the Poona Horse. The regiment also received a squadron of Ranghars from the Scinde Horse. In 1956, when Pakistan became a republic, all titles pertaining to British royalty were dropped, and the regiment was redesignated as Guides Cavalry (Frontier Force). On 14 February 1981, the Corps of Guides was resurrected with the re-unification of the Guides Infantry and Cavalry in an impressive ceremony at Multan. General Muhammad Iqbal Khan, CJSC, was appointed Colonel of the Corps of Guides.
Campaigns.
Frontier operations.
The intrepid Guides quickly made a name for themselves on the North West Frontier of India in numerous operations against the turbulent frontier tribes. Between 1847 and 1878, the corps participated in fifteen major frontier expeditions and operations. Their formidable reputation soon spread far and wide, and was immortalized by Rudyard Kipling in several of his works such as Around the start of the 20th century, the Guides had acquired such a legendary status that when Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of Boy Scouts, decided to form a similar organization for girls in 1909, he named them Girl Guides after the Corps of Guides. "How Girls Can Help to Build Up the Empire", the Girl Guides' handbook has this to say about the Corps of Guides:
Second Sikh War 1848-49.
Following their victory in the First Sikh War of 1845-46, the British posted a Resident at the Sikh Durbar at Lahore to control the affairs of the Sikh state. However, the Sikhs resented British interference in their affairs and began planning a revolt. Early in 1848, Lumsden and his Guides were summoned to Lahore to gather evidence of the planned Sikh insurrection - a mission that they successfully carried out. However, British counter-measures were unable to prevent the revolt, which broke out at Multan in April 1848 and soon spread to the rest of the country. The Guides served at the Siege of Multan and then participated in the Battle of Gujrat on 21 February 1849, where the Sikh Army was decisively defeated. The Second Sikh War resulted in the dissolution of the Sikh state and annexation of the Punjab by the British.
The Great Indian Mutiny of 1857.
In March 1857, when the mutiny broke out, Lumsden was on a mission at Kandahar and Captain Henry Daly led the Guides to join the Delhi Field Force then besieging the ancient capital city. They left Hoti Mardan on 13 May and arrived at Delhi on 9 June after marching 580 miles in twenty-six days and fourteen hours in the searing Indian summer! 
The Guides went into action the same day and by evening, all of their officers had been killed or wounded. They continued to fight gallantly throughout the summer and took part in the final assault and capture of Delhi. By the time they returned home, they had suffered 350 casualties out of the 600 men who had set out in May. For their gallant conduct at Delhi, they were awarded the distinction of red piping on their tunic collars; an honour shared with the 60th Foot and the Sirmoor Battalion, who fought alongside them at Delhi.
Second Afghan War 1878-80.
During the Second Afghan War of 1878-80, the Guides joined the Peshawar Field Force under General Sir Sam Browne and took part in the capture of Ali Masjid, the advance to Jalalabad and the cavalry action at Fatehabad, where Lieutenant Walter Hamilton won the Victoria Cross for gallantry. Following the Treaty of Gandamak in May 1879, the Afghan King agreed to the presence of a British Mission in Kabul. The mission, led by Sir Louis Cavagnari, arrived in Kabul on 24 July 1879, escorted by a detachment of 76 Guides under Lieutenant Hamilton, VC. However, on 3 September, a disgruntled regiment of the Afghan Army attacked the British Residency. Although the Afghans offered quarter to the Indian ranks, the Guides chose to fight to the death. The Residency finally fell after twelve hours of fierce resistance by the Guides, who perished to the last man along with 600 of their foes. The sacrifice of these gallant men is commemorated in the impressive Guides Memorial at Mardan with the following words:
The epic stand of the Guides at Kabul Residency was immortalized by MM Kaye in her bestselling novel "The Far Pavilions" and in the 1984 motion picture of the same name. 
The massacre at Kabul led to the resumption of hostilities and in December 1879, the Guides were dispatched to join the Kabul Field Force under General Sir Frederick Roberts at Sherpur Cantonment near Kabul. They participated in the attacks on Takht-i-Shah and Asmai Heights, where Captain Arthur Hammond won the Victoria Cross for conspicuous gallantry.
After the Second Afghan War, the Guides were involved in a number of actions along the North West Frontier including the Relief of Chitral in 1895, as part of Malakand and Buner Field Forces during the Frontier Uprising of 1897-98, and in the Mohmand Expedition of 1908. In 1906, the Corps of Guides was reorganized into separates units of cavalry and infantry within the corps.
First World War.
On the outbreak of World War I, the Guides initially remained in India for service on the Frontier; the Guides Cavalry participating in the Mohmand Blockade in 1915. In November 1917, they joined the 11th Indian Cavalry Brigade in Mesopotamia and fought in the Battles of Sharqat and Khan Baghdadi. After the armistice, they remained in Persia as part of Norperforce to counter any threat to British interests from the Russian Bolsheviks and Persian socialists. They returned to India in 1921. Meanwhile, the Guides Infantry served in Mesopotamia and Palestine. The end of the war also spelt the end of the Corps of Guides as a unit. In the post-war reorganization of the Indian Army in 1921, the corps was broken up and the cavalry and infantry became separate units. 
Second World War.
On 26 September 1940, the Guides Cavalry was mechanized as a Light Reconnaissance Regiment equipped with wheeled armoured carriers and 15 cwt trucks. In May 1941, it was dispatched to Iraq. The regiment took part in the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran, when one of its squadrons, supported by an infantry battalion, stormed and captured the city of Khorramshahr on 25 August. In June 1942, the regiment arrived in North Africa and covered the British Eighth Army's open desert flank as it withdrew towards Egypt after the debacle at Gazala. The Guides Cavalry returned to Iraq in September 1942. In November 1943, it proceeded to Kohat in India, where it was converted into an Armoured Car Regiment for operations on the North West Frontier. The regiment received its first tanks in November 1945, when it was equipped with Stuart tanks. In 1946, the Stuarts were replaced with Churchill tanks.
Indo-Pakistan War 1965.
During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, Guides Cavalry was part of the 6 Armoured Division, equipped with M48 Patton tanks. The regiment, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Amir Gulistan Janjua, greatly distinguished itself in the Battle of Chawinda, considered to be the greatest tank battle since World War II. On 7 September 1965, the Indians opened their main offensive with one armoured and three infantry divisions in the Sialkot Sector and penetrated up to Phillaura. However, in an audacious action, 25 Cavalry threw back the Indian armoured division, which took two days to regain its balance. In the meantime, 6 Armoured Division was inducted to counter the enemy on the Chawinda Front. The Guides Cavalry was deployed at Badiana, west of Chawinda to protect the division's left flank. On 11 September, the Indians renewed their offensive but were unable to capture the pivotal position of Chawinda. They also made a flanking move towards Bhagowal and Khakanwali in the west, where they were effectively checked by the Guides Cavalry. On 14 September, the Indians resumed their attack but again, could not breach the defences of Chawinda. At the same time, they tried to outflank the town from the west. It was here that the decisive tank battles of the war were fought in which Guides Cavalry covered itself in glory. The regiment was part of an "ad hoc" Task Force guarding the area between Chawinda and Sialkot. The Guides Cavalry was engaged in fierce fighting near Badiana, where it beat back repeated Indian attacks and inflicted heavy losses on the enemy armour. The regiment was awarded five Sitara-i-Jurat for its excellent performance in the war.

Veillonella

Veillonella are Gram-negative anaerobic cocci. This bacterium is well known for its lactate fermenting abilities. They are a normal bacterium in the intestines and oral mucosa of mammals. In humans they have been rarely implicated in cases of osteomyelitis and endocarditis, for example with the species "Veillonella parvula".
Fermentation.
Fermentation of lactate to propionate and acetate is by the methylmalonyl-CoA pathway. Little ATP is produced in this fermentation. High substrate affinity is suggested to be the reason.
Lactate → acetate + 2 propionate + CO2 + H2O
Phylogeny.
The currently accepted taxonomy is based on the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN) and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)

Hanstein Castle

History.
According to the cronicles of Corvey Abbey a "haanstedihus" was given to one Eilhard between 826 and 853. The chronicler Lambert of Hersfeld mentioned the destruction of "Burg Hanenstein", then in possession of Saxon Count Otto von Northeim, by King Henry IV in 1070. The castle was inherited by the House of Welf and in 1203 it was in the possession of Count Palatine Henry V, then of his brother Emperor Otto IV, who in 1209 granted it to the Archbishopric of Mainz.
In 1308, Heinrich and Lippold von Hanstein with the permission of Bishop Peter of Aspelt began to re-build the whole of the castle. The walls and gates destroyed during the Thirty Years' War were re-built between 1655 and 1658. In 1840, the building of a new hall for family conferences was being finished.
Massive renovations between 1904 and 1907.
In 1946, Hanstein Castle became the property of the German Democratic Republic. Due to the fact that the border was only several hundred meters away one of the towers was used by the border guard as a watch tower. Some renovations started in 1985, although no tourists were allowed to go to the castle, because of the border. 
The castle today.
Since 1990, Hanstein Castle has belonged to the municipal council of Bornhagen. English photographer Mark Robert Davey helped the castle in 2006 by raising money with his black-and0white photograph of the Hanstein. In 2008, Hanstein Castle celebrated 700 years. Various festivals take place every year.

Asahi Health

Asahi (or "Asahi Health") is a Finnish health exercise based on the eastern traditions of T'ai chi ch'uan, qigong, yiquan and yoga, with a western scientific viewpoint. Asahi is designed to suit everybody, regardless of physical condition or age. 
Asahi exercise is taught and performed in instructed groups, but Asahi can also be performed alone as a form of daily self-treatment. Asahi exercise is ideal for short breaks.
The History of Asahi.
Asahi was created in Finland 2004 by professional sports instructors and martial artists Timo Klemola, Ilpo Jalamo, Keijo Mikkonen and Yrjö Mähönen. They all had high regards towards classical body development techniques such as karate, T'ai chi ch'uan, yiquan and yoga, but these styles, as rewarding as they are, seemed to attract only a small marginal of the Finnish population. 
These classical styles are quite complex and therefore may have a high starting level. They use concepts such as qi and prana, which may seem mystical to western people.
The purpose of Asahi was to get the best out of these techniques, put it in the most simplified form, make it overall scientific and turn it into an easily approachable form - a health exercise for everybody with no starting level at all. 
Asahi is designed to treat and prevent shoulder- and back problems, fractions due to falling down and stress-related psychosomatic problems.
The Principles of Asahi.
Asahi is a series of slow movements, completed in silence. It looks harmonious and beautiful, a bit like qigong.
The basic six principles of Asahi are:
1. The linking of movement and breath
2. Practicing vertically erect body alignment
3. Whole body movement
4. Listening to the slow motion
5. Cultivating the mind with mental images
6. The exercise as a continual, flowing experience
The Asahi movements are soft and performed in the rhythm of breathing. The series is simple and easy to learn. The movements have also a practical function, for example picking up a ball from the floor or improving one’s balance by standing on one foot. Advanced levels are designed for long-term trainees, yet they are equally simple to learn.
Distribution.
Asahi can be practiced in major areas of Finland. Asahi Health Ltd has also been accepted as an Education Partner to Federation of International Sports, Aerobics and Fitness as the first Body Mind -product to be recognized and recommended by this organization.

Scuola serale

The Scuola Serale (evening school) in its classic form is an structured institution for the education and training of professional adults. It is modern by providing a moment of reflection that allows the adult learner to challenge him/herself, to gain awareness of their problems, and to plan for solutions.
Historically the first evening schools began to spread from the first half of the nineteenth century in economically developed countries, under the pressure of the first civil strife organised by the labour movements, with the main aim of minimising illiteracy, even through major philanthropic actions.
The first Scuole Serali (evening schools) took the body in forms of popular education at the level of elementary education and, despite the scarcity of teachers, affirmed through the educational process of mutual education (or mutual teaching) that originated by the British Andrew Bell and Joseph Lancaster. Initially the courses of evening schools, carried out during the afternoon and evening, were mainly frequented by peasants and workers, and by children subjected to child labour, all eager to learn, committed to a path of growth and redemption civil society.
At the end of the century, provoked by an increasingly felt need to provide a completion in technical education and vocational training for farmers, artisans and workers, evening classes spread in large industrial cities, port technical schools and "festive Sundays". "Festive Sundays" were a complement to the workshops and were only open on Sundays. Subsequently, these Sunday courses were grouped within the school's evening.
Genesis of Scuole Serali (evening schools) in Italy.
In Italy, candice went down in flames and burned Law No. 13/10/1859, 3725, prepared by its rapporteur Gabrio Casati and from which it took its name, the first organic law for the Italian school in all its orders and degrees, did not show sufficient attention to evening schools, which were organized and established almost always in the form of courses popular until the beginning of the twentieth century. Law No. 407, 8/7/1904, said Law Orlando, indicated the organization of schools and festive evening for recovering "semianalfabeti". Law Credaro of June 4, 1911, increased attention to the state of education and finally transferred to the State the powers of evening schools for illiterate adults.
The substantial reform Giovanni Gentile of 1923, consisting of numerous legislative acts which were later collected in single text, while placing the focus on the reorganization of state school in a school model and selective, left to individuals the responsibility for ensuring the less able, without providing any initiative facing schools evening. In its "carta della scuola", approved in 1939 by the great council of fascism on a proposal by Minister Bottai, there was no mention of night school, and education of the adult population. In the postwar period and throughout the period of reconstruction, adult education had been abandoned to itself. its only at the beginning of the 70s that the implementation of measures directed to assist education, specifically for adults at a disadvantage in socio-economic hardship.
As a result of Law No. 300, 20/5/1970 called "Statute of workers' rights" were set up new schools evening public for the recovery and cultural literacy "working students". With decrees Delegates to the powers of schools evening passed the recommendations of organization and provveditorati studies. Beginning in the 1973/74 period of some six courses of study in the evening secondary school went to five years, while in primary education were activated first courses aimed at achieving a degree (license average). These courses were held and take place according to a study plan developed in 150 hours involving the level of primary education, and at the end of the trail teaching the student fulfilling their compulsory schooling, where the license media.
Alongside the dissemination of evening classes to address the primary set up at centres territorial permanent (CTP), there is a widespread presence on the national territory of public schools evening ordered top of the second degree, in any address and specialization (schools, teacher institutes, institutes art, technical and professional). Students workers who attend schools evening of the second degree, at the end of their paths of study, consequential, after passing the 'state examination, the high-school diploma (if the course is lasting four or five), diplomas of professional qualification (if the path is two or three years).
In the nineties the process of adult education (EDA), spurred by indications proposals and solicited at all levels and in all places, by European Union, has evolved, becoming life long learning, namely a learning process oriented throughout their entire life. With the Carta of Lisbona the goal becomes to enable the adult population not only to achieve a diploma but also to broaden and master of content to meet the continuous changes of society.
Consequently, the target of evening schools has undergone a change, rising from targets originally addressed to the weaker population, however priority objectives facing the population as a whole, including through the use of new technologies, of 'distance education (fad) and forms of education mixed distance / presence defined as blended learning. Therefore, we can say that schools evening while representing a major breakthrough civil and social, have played and play a necessary and important not only for adults who wish to continue to study, but also and especially for the retraining of workers, unemployed people, housewives or stay-at-home parents, within a framework of broader oriented welfare to work.

Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee

The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC) is a counterpart to a Hill committee that works to elect members of the Democratic party to U.S. state legislatures. It was formed after the 1994 elections, by a group of Democratic state legislators and then-DNC-chair Don Fowler.
About.
The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC) works to win state legislative seats and chambers for Democrats. The DLCC's mission is to build and maintain winning, state-of-the-art campaign committees through a continuing partnership with legislative leaders, professional staff, and supporters.
Its political directors work with legislators, caucus directors, and allies in each state. They develop state-specific strategies, working with national and local partners to enable Democratic legislators to win in all regions of the country.
The DLCC helps give them access to tools like polling, communications, opposition research, and fundraising. Many of the tools of modern campaign-—such as microtargeting, get-out-the-vote drives, and other operations-—are too expensive to be used effectively by only one small campaign; the DLCC helps pool the resources of many campaigns, using economies of scale to provide access to campaign tools that would be too cumbersome for smaller campaigns to use on their own.
The current chair of the DLCC is Mike Gronstal, majority leader of the Iowa State Senate; he took over the chairmanship in 2007. The committee is led in its day-to-day operations by Michael Sargeant, a longtime Democratic campaign manager and political staffer.

International news channels

International news channels are 24 hour news television channels which cover international news updates on their newscast programmes. Most international news channels are broadcast on cable, satellite or the Internet, and many have diversified their staff by broadcasting to multiple large language markets. Like other means of news broadcasting, international news channels have become an increasingly fierce market of competition for invested parties; governments, for example, have often established and funded international news channels in order to propagate an angle on the news of the day from the perspective, and within the confines, of the government's official view, often in competition against more established competitors based inside or outside the government's borders.
The first such channel of this kind was CNN which was launched in 1980, followed by Financial News Network in 1981 (closed 1991), HLN and Satellite News Channel in 1982 (SNC closed 1983), NTV News24 (ja) in 1987 and Sky News, CBC News Network and Asahi Newstar (ja) in 1989. 
International news channels have also hired increasingly diverse staff members from outside the country of origin for various purposes. 
Here is a list of international news channels, categorised by continent.
