USS California (SP-249)

USS "California" (SP-249) -- later known as USS "Hauoli" (SP-249) – was a yacht acquired by the U.S. Navy during World War I. It was outfitted as an armed patrol craft and, during the first part of its Navy career, patrolled and protected New York waterways. Later, it was assigned to Thomas A. Edison so that he could conduct underwater listening experiments related to antisubmarine warfare. Post-war the yacht was sold to a buyer in Tampa, Florida.
Purchased in New York.
"Hauoli", a steam yacht, was built in 1903 by Robbins Drydock Company, Brooklyn, New York, and purchased by the Navy as "California" in August 1917 from her owner, Clara B. Stocker, of New York City. After fitting out, it commissioned at New York Navy Yard 24 December 1917, Lt. (j.g.) W. Applebye-Robinson, USNRF, commanding. Its name was changed back to the original "Hauoli" 18 February 1918.
World War I service.
"Hauoli" spent the first year of its service as a patrol vessel in New York harbor. It patrolled outside the harbor also, and occasionally carried passengers to and from convoys.
Assigned to Thomas A. Edison.
The yacht was transferred to special duty 28 January 1919, and assigned to the experimental use of Thomas A. Edison for ASW (antisubmarine warfare) studies. Edison installed listening devices in "Hauoli" and carried out tests in and around New York harbor.
Post-war decommissioning.
Before demobilization cut short the experiments with "Hauoli", it was withdrawn from that service and decommissioned 8 October 1919, and later sold to Denton Shore Lumber Co., Tampa, Florida, 7 September 1920.

United States Dance Championships

The annual United States Dance Championships (USDC), previously called the United States Ballroom Championships (USBC) and the United States DanceSport Championships (USDSC), is recognized by the National Dance Council of America (NDCA) and the World Dance & DanceSport Council (WD&DSC) as determining the majority of the United States national professional ballroom dance champions. 
The competition was held annually from 1971 to 1974 in New York City at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. It was held in Washington, DC, in 1975, and then returned to the Waldorf-Astoria in New York City from 1976 to 1981. In 1982, it was held at the Felt Forum at Madison Square Garden, returning to the Waldorf-Astoria in 1983, and was shared by the two venues in 1984. The competition moved to the Miami (Florida) area in 1985. The competition, now held since 2007 in Orlando, Florida, will celebrate its 37th year in 2008 (September 2nd through 6th).
Although the NDCA and WD&DSC recognize the United States Dance Championships as determining the professional United States Champions, the International DanceSport Federation (IDSF), the United States Olympic Committee (USOC), and the Amateur Sports Act of the United States Congress recognize USA Dance, formerly known as the United States Amateur Ballroom Dance Association (USABDA), as the National Governing Body in the United States for DanceSport (i.e., competitive ballroom dancing). USA Dance holds the annual USA Dance National DanceSport Championships where top dance couples are awarded the opportunity to represent the United States at IDSF World Championships.

Artificial psychology

Artificial Psychology is a theoretical discipline proposed by Dan Curtis (b. 1963). The theory states that when the artificial intelligence approaches the level of complexity where the intelligence meets two conditions:
Condition I
Condition II
When both conditions are met, then the possibility exists that the intelligence will reach irrational conclusions based on real or created information. At this point, the criteria is met for intervention which will not necessarily be resolved by simple re-coding of processes due to extraordinarily complex nature of the codebase itself; but rather a discussion with the intelligence in a format which more closely resembles classical (human) psychology.
If the intelligence cannot be reprogrammed by directly inputting new code, but requires the intelligence to reprogram itself through a process of analysis and decision based on information provided by a human, in order for it to overcome behavior which is inconsistent with the machines purpose or ability to function normally, then artificial psychology is by definition, what is required.
The level of complexity that is required before these thresholds are met is currently a subject of extensive debate. The theory of artificial psychology does not address the specifics of what those levels may be, but only that the level is sufficiently complex that the intelligence cannot simply be recoded by a software developer, and therefore dysfunctionality must be addressed through the same processes that humans must go through to address their own dysfunctionalities. Along the same lines, artificial psychology does not address the question of whether or not the intelligence is actually conscience or not.
The current level of artificial intelligence in 2008 does not approach any threshold where any of the theories or principles of artificial psychology may even be tested, and therefore, for the foreseeable future, artificial psychology will remain a theoretical discipline.

Ytterlännäs old church

The Old Church of Ytterlännäs belongs to Ytterlännäs parish in the province of Ångermanland in Northern Sweden. It is located between Nyland and Bollstabruk on the main road no. 333 in Kramfors Municipality. In terms of ecclesiastical divisions, the parish belonged to the Archdiocese of Uppsala in the Middle Ages, but has been part of the Diocese of Härnösand since that was formed in 1647.
The building.
The building dates from the early 13th century, retaining the original walls and the Romanesque outer door with its iron ornament around the keyhole, and a lion's head from c: 800 from the area of Byzantine cultural influence around Constantinople.
From the 14th century there is a marble baptismal font from Gotland, and a crucifix.
In the 15th century a vestry and a 'weapon-house' (porch) were added, the choir was extended to make it as wide as the rest of the church, the roof was raised with vaults of brick, the windows enlarged, the Maria-bell was cast, and there is a candle-holder featuring a cock and a spiral central pillar. In the vaults and on the walls there are well-preserved frescos from the late 15th century, featuring a variety of biblical references and the legends of saints. It also includes an inscription interpreted by the art historian Henrik Cornell in 1918 as spelling "maalede Eghil", "painted by Eghil". This was re-interpreted by Einar Bager in a 1969 publication as simply the incipit of the alphabet; the anonymous painter, who belonged to the Tierp school, is now known as "Alfabetsmästaren", the Alphabet Master.
An altarpiece in the Lübeck style has been displayed in several positions.
The Ytterlännäs Madonna from Haaken Gulleson's Hälsingland workshop features both the coat of arms of the archdiocese, to which the church belonged at the time, and the personal arms (the claw of an eagle) of Archbishop Jakob Ulfsson, and is presumably a donation made on the occasion of his visit in 1507.
From the 17th century there are pews, a wooden floor with broad planks and one panel of a pulpit; the first of the galleries' three sections is dated 1652.
In the 18th century a rare second gallery was added, as well as a new pulpit and a new altarpiece featuring a sculpture of the Last Supper with 1+13 round the table. Under protest the paintings of saints on the wall, the saints images in the ceilings and the other decoration was not touched. In 1773 the separate bell-tower burned down and was replaced by mounting the bells above the church itself, under a broken roof.
In the mid-19th century a larger church was needed to house the growing population, and it was decided to re-use the stones from the old church to build a new: but in an impassioned and rhetorical speech, magistrate Carl Martin Schönmeyer, the owner of the estate Angsta gård, managed to turn the decision in favour of leaving the old church untouched. It was abandoned and the Maria-bell was used at the smaller of two bells in the new church. 
The Ytterlännäs new church was opened in 1854 with Israel Israelsson Näslund (1796-1858) as the vicar. 
In 1937 art historian and newspaper editor Gustaf Näsström made a plea for donations towards a restoration of the church, after which the whitewash was carefully removed a far as was possible; in 1950, to mark the 100th anniversary of the decision not to demolish the old church, the Maria-bell was returned from the new church.
In 1963 architect Lars Holmer carried out detailed measurements and drew elevations from east, west and south, a plan, and sections along the breadth and length.
In 1964 the brother Gösta and Torsten Melin made a documentary film, which was certified by Prof. Henrik Cornell as 'the first colour film made in Sweden about a mediaeval church'; in 1978 they also filmed the extensive renovation which was carried out then; both films are now available on DVD.
In 1995 the Old Church became a 'roadside church' and today it is open seven days a week for seven weeks after mid-summer, with guiding, a coffee house, a mediaeval workshop, music and other activities.

Tookoolito

Tookoolito () (c. 1838 – December 31, 1876) known as "Hannah" among whalers of Cumberland Sound, was an Inuk woman who served as translator and guide to Charles Francis Hall, an Arctic explorer involved in the search for Franklin's lost expedition in the 1860s and 1870s. Her husband, Joseph Ebierbing ():, known as "Joe," worked alongside her as a guide and hunter, and they both accompanied Hall on the United States Polaris Expedition.
Early life and family.
Tookoolito was born at Cape Searle in the Cumberland Sound or Qikiqtaaluk Region, or Baffin Island area. Her brother, Eenoolooapik, traveled in 1839 with whaler William Penny to Aberdeen. Other relatives, Totocatapik and Kur-king, were also renowned as travelers.
In 1852, Tookoolito began learning English from a British whaler, William Barron.
Travels.
Tookoolito, with her husband and children, traveled extensively through the Arctic, and to England and the United States.
England.
In 1853, a whaling captain named John Bowlby (sometimes called Thomas Bowlby), brought her with Ebierbing and an unrelated child, Akulukjuk ("Harlookjoe"), to England. The three Inuit were exhibited in various venues throughout the north of the country, and were eventually brought to London, where they were received by Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle. She and Ebierbing dined with the Queen and Prince Albert. Unlike many less scrupulous showmen, Bowlby returned the group to the Arctic.
First Arctic Expedition: Baffin Island.
In 1860, the explorer Charles Francis Hall met Tookoolito and Ebierbing, hiring them as translator and guide on his first expedition to search for remains of the Franklin expedition. Local inhabitants led him to the remains of the Frobisher expedition instead. Sidney Budington captained the expedition's ship, the "George Henry".
United States.
She and Joe returned with Hall in the fall of 1862, and appeared alongside him at his lectures. Later that year, Hall arranged for them to be exhibited at Barnum's American Museum in New York, where they drew enormous crowds, advertised as "Esquimaux Indians ... from the arctic regions ... the first and only inhabitants of these frozen regions ever brought to" the United States. Not long after, Hall agreed to a second exhibition at Boston's Aquarial Gardens, but when no payment was forthcoming, decided that such shows were not worth the risk to Hannah and Joe's health. Nevertheless, they accompanied him on his East Coast lecture tour throughout the early months of 1863, and possibly as a result, Tookoolito's young son "Butterfly" became ill and died of pneumonia. Inconsolable, Tookoolito became suicidal, but eventually regained her health.
Second Arctic Expedition: King William Island.
Along with Ebierbing, she returned with Hall to the Arctic on his second land expedition from 1864 to 1869. During this expedition, Tookoolito gave birth to a son "King William," who died in infancy; she and Joe then adopted a two-year old Inuit girl whom they called simply "Panik" (the Inuktitut word for "daughter").
Polaris expedition.
She and Joe also accompanied Hall on his final voyage, the voyage of the Polaris (1871–1873). Along with their daughter Panik and the Greenlandic Inuit hunter Hans Hendrik, they were among the party left behind after Hall's death, when the ship abruptly broke loose of the ice and failed to return. This party endured a remarkable six-month drift on a gradually-shrinking icefloe, kept alive only by Joe and Hans's hunting skills; the entire party was rescued by a sealer in April 1873. During the investigation into Hall's death, both Tookoolito and Ebierbing testified, both corroborating Hall's belief that he had been poisoned, but their evidence was discounted. For the main entry, see "Polaris Expedition".
Later life in Groton.
They returned to Groton, Connecticut to a home that whaling captain that Hall and Sidney O. Budington had helped them establish. Joe returned to the Arctic several times to work as a guide, while Tookoolito remained behind, caring for Panik and working as a seamstress. After Panik, whose health had been poor since her experience on the ice floe, died at the age of nine, Hannah fell into declining health. Joe was with her when she died on December 31, 1876; she was buried in the Starr Burying Ground not far from the Budington family plot.
Tookoolito Inlet, located at on the western side of Cornelius Grinnell Bay in Nunavut, and Hannah Island, in the mouth of Bessels Fjord, North Greenland, are named after her.

Denis Prieur (painter)

Denis Prieur is a painter born in Moret-sur-Loing, France, 1957, where he lived in a particularly painting oriented atmosphere. His grandfather Louis Prieur, was a painter. His father, Claude Prieur, a fresco painter, is still active working on French historic monuments.
Biography.
Aged 16, Denis Prieur enters the Ecole Nationale des Beaux-arts de Paris, integrating Pierre Carron and Pierre Faure's workshop. Aged 20, he exposes his work for the first time at la maison des Beaux-arts and meets with Albert Loeb, who will himself expose several of his paintings at his renowned Parisian gallery. The following year, Jean Clair, curator at Centre Georges Pompidou, visits his workshop and buys one of his paintings for the museum's collections.
Several times exposed at la maison des Beaux-arts (1978, 1991), he participates in the Salon de Monaco in 1996 and 1997, and was privileged with an exhibit at the Hôtel de Ville de Paris in 1995. Working with a resolutely classical approach, he declares: "I studied in a workshop where one was taught realism. Only one thing was missing for this school to be real and that was mystery. Indeed mystery does punctuate a man's life and provides it with meaning. I want to celebrate these mysteries in my paintings... For a long time I have been trying to represent the torsion of light on a body or in the ambiance of a painting..."

Myriam Hernández

Miriam Raquel Hernández Navarro (born May 2, 1967 in Ñuñoa, Santiago), popularly known as Myriam Hernández, is a Chilean singer-songwriter and television presenter. She is known throughout Latin America for her romantic ballads.
Biography.
Hernández began her career in the late 80's. Her first track was "Ay Amor." At age 11 she debuted on the program "Generación joven," followed soon after by "La Pandilla," both part of Televisión Nacional de Chile. Based on this she was offered a role in the soap opera "De cara al mañana," where she appeared in five episodes. The following year, as a solo artist, she entered into the "Ranking Juvenil" (Juvenile Ranking) of Canal 13's "Sábados Gigantes" program, hosted by Don Francisco. At 18 she was named Artista Revelación (Best New Artist) by the Chilean press before having even recorded a single album.
In Chile, in December 1988, Hernández released her first album under record label EMI entitled "Myriam Hernández". In Chile the record got her the Disco de Oro, and would later go quadruple platinum in - among other countries - the United States, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, and Panama. Thus began her international career. Two tracks on this album, "Ay Amor" (Oh My Love) and "El Hombre que Yo Amo" (The Man I Love), spent months at the top of music charts in Latin America and the U.S. In February 1989 she was a guest artist and jury member at the Festival de Viña del Mar.
In 1989, the Asociación de Periodistas de Espectáculos de Chile awarded Hernández the APES award for Best Female Performer and her album received the Mejor Producción Discorgráfica (Best Record) award. In July 1989, Billboard's Hot Latin scored her first success with "El Hombre que Yo Amo," and soon after in December her album was among the 10 best selling albums in the Latin world.
In Los Angeles in January 1990 Hernández began recording a second album, produced by Humberto Gatica, and on which collaborated David Foster, Jason Scheff (Chicago Group) and Lucho Gatica as executive producer. Noteworthy songs included "Te Pareces Tanto a Él" (You Look so much like Him), "Tonto" (Fool), "Mío" (Mine), "Peligroso Amor" (Dangerous Love), and "Herida" (Hurt, composed by Myriam Hernández). The album remained on the Billboard charts from May 1990 to July 1991, with "Peligroso Amor" occupying the No. 1 spot for several weeks, followed by "Te Pareces Tanto a Él" and "Herida." This album held the No. 1 spot for Top Latin Albums for a record 18 consecutive weeks. "Peligroso Amor," whose video, produced by Luis de Lllano (Televisa-Mexico), was nominated for "Billboard" magazine's Best Latin Video.
Once again in 1991 Hernández was invited to the Viña del Mar International Song Festival where she received both the Antorcha and Gaviota de Plata awards. In Los Angeles in 1992 she recorded her third album produced by Spaniard Juan Carlos Calderón and mixed by Humberto Gatica. All the songs were written by Juan Carlos Calderón, with the exception of "Mira" (Look), co-written by Myriam and Juan Carlos. The album's hits were "Un Hombre Secreto" (A Secret Man), "Se Me Fue" (Gone), and "Si no Fueras Tú" (If You Weren't You). The album went Gold and Platinum in the U.S., Mexico, Central America, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Chile.

Also in 1992, Hernández began a new project by founding the "School of Vocal Arts" along with her voice instructor, speech therapist Ricardo Álvarez. Among the professional artists to have gone through this School are Beto Cuevas, Lucybell, and Kudai. Her fourth album, released in 1994, was also produced in Los Angeles where she worked again with producer Humberto Gatica. From this album the song "Ese Hombre" (That Man), by Chilean songwriter María Angélica Ramírez, won ASCAP's "Best Pop Ballad" of the year, as well as first place on the Billboard charts. In 1996, artist Paul Anka invited her to collaborate on an album of all-time Spanish hits called "Amigos" (Friends), on which they performed together the song "Tu Cabeza en Mi Hombro" (a Spanglish cover of Put Your Head on My Shoulder). Figures such as Céline Dion, Ricky Martin, Julio Iglesias, and Juan Gabriel also collaborated on that album, which was released by Sony.
In 1998, Hernández released "Todo el Amor" (All the Love), her newest and fifth album. Produced by Humberto Gatica and achieving success in all Spanish-language markets, including once again the United States, where the first single, "Huele a Peligro" (It Smells Like Danger), by Armando Manzanero, quickly climbed to the first spot of Billboard magazine's Hot Latin Tracks. It also included hits such as "Deseo" (I Wish), by Mónica Naranjo, and "La Fuerza del Amor" (The Strength of Love), by Estéfano. The music video for the song "Huele a Peligro" was directed in Chile by director Germán Bobe.
In 1998 Hernández was a guest on the Chilean program "Gigante y Ud.," along with Don Francisco, for two months. In the June 1999 issue of People En Español she was elected one of 25 Latin beauties, together with Ricky Martin and Spanish actor Antonio Banderas.

In February 2001, at the Viña del Mar International Song Festival, she was awarded the Gaviota de Plata and Oro (Silver and Golden Seagull) by the public.
In October 2001 Hernández gave two concerts at Santiago de Chile's Municipal Theater, a recording of which, "El Amor en Concierto" The Love at Concert, was released in Chile where it went Gold and Platinum. Based in Miami since 2000, she decided to make a foray into designer modeling photography for Italian brand Santini Mavardi and also agreed for the first time to associate her name with a commercial brand and act in an ad campaign for Procter & Gamble's "Head & Shoulders."
In 2002, Hernández debuted as host of the Viña del Mar International Song Festival, a competition held every year in Chile and in which she participated until 2006 alongside entertainers Antonio Vodanovic, Ricardo Montaner, and Sergio Lagos. She became the only woman to host for 25 nights with 3 different entertainers. She also was an entertainer on Chilean television programs such as "La Movida del Festival," "Con Mucho Cariño," "Protagonistas de la Música," and "La Noche del Mundial."
In 2004, Hernández released Huellas (Traces), a collection of her greatest hits including three never before-released songs. Armando Manzanero composed a new hit for her, "No te He Robado Nada" (I Took Nothing From You), and Myriam Hernández and her son Jorge Ignacio, then only eight, composed the song "He Vuelto por Ti" (I Have Come Back for You). The album included a new version of the song "Mio" recorded with Argentine group Los Nocheros as well as the song "El Amor de mi Vida" (The Love of my Life) (written by Myriam and Chilean hip-hop band Los Tetas) recorded with that band. Huellas was released across Latin America and went Gold and Platinum. She also released her first DVD. At the end of 2005 she produced her first DVD-CD of a live performance entitled Contigo en Concierto (With You in Concert).
In 2007, Hernández released the covers' album "Enamorándome" (Falling In Love). In February 2010 Myriam sang "Rescátame" in Festival Antofagasta Junto al Mar. This song will be appear in her new album.

<doc id="18402909" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18402909" title="Falling Down (Oasis song)">
Falling Down (Oasis song)

"Falling Down" is a song by English rock band Oasis, featured on their 2008 seventh studio album "Dig Out Your Soul". Written and sung by lead guitarist Noel Gallagher, it was released as the third single from the album and is also the final single released by the band with the digital release occurring a day earlier. 
Music.
The heavily compressed drum-rhythm and sense of disillusioned psychedelia bear a strong resemblance to the Beatles song "Tomorrow Never Knows", being cited as Noel's finest effort so far to emulate the atmosphere of that song.
An excerpt of the B-side song "Those Swollen Hand Blues" appears at the end of "Mucky Fingers", the second track of Oasis' 2005 album "Don't Believe the Truth". 
The lyric: "Catch the wheel that breaks the butterfly" references the quotation: "Who breaks a butterfly upon a wheel?" from Alexander Pope's "Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot".
Reception.
The song debuted at number 10 in the UK Singles Chart with first-week sales of 21,448, but the song only achieved a chart position of number 37 in the UK download chart in the same week, most likely because it was available as a download release before the new album was released. (Upon the release of "Dig Out Your Soul" the previous October, "Falling Down" charted briefly at number 125 on download sales alone). "Falling Down" is the sixth Oasis single to be sung by Noel rather than Liam. It is also the second Oasis song to be used in a TV series (the first being "Half the World Away"). Due to strong download sales of the track, the B-side "Those Swollen Hand Blues" made the UK charts at number 190 on the day "Falling Down" made the top ten.
"Falling Down" posted a subtle improvement from its predecessor, "I'm Outta Time", on the UK Singles Chart, reaching number 10 in its chart entry week. This was something of a return to form for the band, after "I'm Outta Time" charting at number 12 made it the first Oasis single released in the UK to fail to reach the top 10 since "Shakermaker" in 1994. Between the two releases the band had put out 22 singles which made the top 10. However, it still showed a decline in the band's fortunes; from the release of "Whatever" at the end of 1994 until the release of "I'm Outta Time", the band had only had one single which failed to reach the top four in the charts, and that had been 2007's "Lord Don't Slow Me Down", which was only a minor promotional release and a non-album track and also download only.
Other uses.
The song was released as downloadable content for the video game "" on 29 January 2009.
The song was used in the opening sequence for the Production I.G anime "Eden of the East", which first aired on Fuji TV's noitaminA timeslot on 9 April 2009. American and Canadian distributor FUNimation Entertainment announced a license for the series and later announced that they will be able to include the song in their release but only on the first episode. However, only the first episode retains the original opening on Blu-ray. The remaining episodes use the international theme song, "Michael ka Belial", by Saori Hayami.
Alternative versions.
Various alternative versions of the song have been produced: remixes by Marilyn Manson bassist Twiggy Ramirez and producer Dave Sardy – the "It's the Gibb" remix – and electronic band The Prodigy are featured on the CD single and the second digital bundle; the "" remix, by Amorphous Androgynous, is released on the 12" vinyl and second digital bundle versions; and The Chemical Brothers remix previously featured as the B-side to "The Shock of the Lightning". In his tour blog, "Tales from the Middle of Nowhere", Gallagher described the 22-minute "A Monstrous Psychedelic Bubble" remix as "A staggering piece of music. Monumental even."
Music video.
The video depicts a woman (played by actress Natasha O'Keeffe), who is supposed to be part of the Royal Family who enjoys parties, one night stands and drugs.

Spacecraft magnetometer

Spacecraft magnetometers are magnetometers used aboard spacecraft and satellites, mostly for scientific investigations, plus attitude sensing. Magnetometers are among the most widely used scientific instruments in exploratory and observation satellites. These instruments were instrumental in the discovery of the Van Allen radiation belts around Earth by Explorer 1, and have detailed the magnetic fields of the Earth, Moon, Sun, Mars, Venus and other planets. There are ongoing missions using magnetometers, including attempts to define the shape and activity of Saturn's core. 
The first spacecraft-borne magnetometer was placed on the Sputnik 3 spacecraft in 1958 and the most detailed magnetic observations of the Earth have been performed by the Magsat and Ørsted satellites. Magnetometers were taken to the Moon during the later Apollo missions. Many instruments have been used to measure the strength and direction of magnetic field lines around Earth and the solar system. 
Spacecraft magnetometers basically fall into three categories: fluxgate, search-coil and ionized gas magnetometers. The most accurate magnetometer complexes on spacecraft contain two separate instruments, with a helium ionized gas magnetometer used to calibrate the fluxgate instrument for more accurate readings. Many later magnetometers contain small ring-coils oriented at 90° in two dimensions relative to each other forming a triaxial framework for indicating direction of magnetic field.
Magnetometer types.
Magnetometers for non-space use evolved from the 19th to mid-20th centuries, and were first employed in spaceflight by Sputnik 3 in 1958. A main constraint on magnetometers in space is the availability of power and mass. Magnetometers fall into 3 major categories: the fluxgate type, search coil and the ionized vapor magnetometers. The newest type is the Overhauser type based on nuclear magnetic resonance technology.
Fluxgate magnetometers.
Fluxgate magnetometers are used for their electronic simplicity and low weight. There have been several types of fluxgate used in spacecraft, which vary in two regards. Primarily better readings are obtained with three magnetometers, each pointing in a different direction. Some spacecraft have instead achieved this by rotating the craft and taking readings at 120° intervals, but this creates other issues. The other difference is in the configuration, which is simple and circular. 
Magnetometers of this type were equipped on the "Pioneer 0"/Able 1, "Pioneer 1"/Able 2, Ye1.1, Ye1.2, and Ye1.3 missions that failed in 1958 due to launch problems. The Pioneer 1 however did collect data on the Van Allen belts. In 1959 the Soviet "Luna 1"/Ye1.4 carried a three-component magnetometer that passed the moon en route to a heliocentric orbit at a distance of , but the magnetic field could not be accurately assessed. Eventually the USSR managed a lunar impact with "Luna 2", a three component magnetometer, finding no significant magnetic field in close approach to the surface. Explorer 10 had an abbreviated 52 hr mission with two fluxgate magnetometers on board. During 1958 and 1959 failure tended to characterize missions carrying magnetometers: 2 instruments were lost on Able IVB alone. In early 1966 the USSR finally placed Luna 10 in orbit around the moon carrying a magnetometer and was able to confirm the weak nature of the moon's magnetic field. Venera 4, 5, and 6 also carried magnetometers on their trips to Venus, although they were not placed on the landing craft. 
Vector sensors.
The majority of early fluxgate magnetometers on spacecraft were made as vector sensors. However, the magnetometer electronics created harmonics which interfered with readings. Properly designed sensors had feedback electronics to the detector that effectively neutralized the harmonics. Mariner 1 and Mariner 2 carried fluxgate-vector sensor devices. Only Mariner 2 survived launch and as it passed Venus on December 14, 1962 it failed to detect a magnetic field around the planet. This was in part due to the distance of the spacecraft from the planet, noise within the magnetometer, and a very weak Venusian magnetic field. Pioneer 6, launched in 1965, is one of 4 Pioneer satellites circling the sun and relaying information to Earth about solar winds. This spacecraft was equipped with a single vector-fluxgate magnetometer.
Ring core and spherical.
Ring core sensor fluxgate magnetometers began replacing vector sensor magnetometers with the Apollo 16 mission in 1972, where a three axis magnetometer was placed on the moon. These sensors were used on a number of satellites including Magsat, Voyager, Ulysses, Giotto, AMPTE. The Lunar Prospector-1 uses ring-coil made of these alloys extended away from each other and its spacecraft to look for remnant magnetism in the moons 'non-magnetic' surface. Properly configured, the magnetometers are capable of measuring magnetic field differences of 1 nT. These devices, with cores about 1 cm in size, were of lower weight than vector sensors. However, these devices were found to have non-linear output with magnetic fields greater than >5000 nT. Later is was discovered that creating a spherical structure with feedback loops wire transverse to the ring in the sphere could negate this effect. These later magnetometers were called spherical fluxgate or compact spherical core (CSC) magnetometers used in the Ørsted satellite. The metal alloys that form the core of these magnetometers has also improved since Apollo-16 mission with latest using advanced molybdenum-permalloy alloys, producing lower noise with more stable output.
Search-coil magnetometer.
Search-coil magnetometers, also called induction magnetometers, are wound coils around a core of high magnetic permeability. Search coils concentrate magnetic field lines inside the core along with fluctuations. The benefit of these magnetometers is that they measure alternating magnetic field and so can resolve changes in magnetic fields quickly, many times per second. Following Lenz's law, the voltage is proportional to the time derivative of magnetic flux. The voltage will be amplified by the apparent permeability of the core. This apparent permeability (µa) is defined as:
formula_1.
The Pioneer 5 mission finally managed to get a working magnetometer of this type in orbit around the sun showing that magnetic fields existed between Earth and Venus orbits. A single magnetometer was oriented along the plane perpendicular to the spin axis of the spacecraft. Search coil magnetometers have become increasingly more common in Earth observation satellites. A commonly used instrument is the triaxial search-coil magnetometer. Orbiting Geophysical Observatory (OGO missions - OGO-1 to OGO-6) The Vela (satellite) mission used this type as part of a package to determine if nuclear weapons evaluation was being conducted outside earth's atmosphere. In September 1979 a Vela satellite collected evidence of a potential nuclear burst over the South Western Indian Ocean. In 1997 the US created the FAST that was designed to investigate aurora phenomena over the poles. And currently it is investigating magnetic fields at 10 to 30 Earth radii with the THEMIS satellites THEMIS, which stands for "Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms" is an array of five satellites which hope to gather more precise history of how magnetic storms arise and dissipate.
Ionized gas magnetometers.
Heavy metal — scalar.
Certain spacecraft, like Magsat, are equipped with scalar magnetometer. The output of these device, often in out frequency, is proportional to the magnetic field. The Magsat and Grm-A1 had cesium-vapor (cesium-133) sensor heads of dual-cell design, this design left two small dead zones. Explorer 10 (P14) was equipped with a rubidium vapor magnetometer, presumably a scalar magnetometer since the spacecraft also had a fluxgate. The magnetometer was fouled accidentally which caused it to overheat, it worked for a period of time but 52 h into the mission transmission went dead and was not regained. Ranger 1 and 2 carried a rubidium vapor magnetometer, failed to reach lunar orbit.
Helium.
This type of magnetometer depends on the variation in helium absorptivity, when excited, polarized infrared light with an applied magnetic field. A low field vector-helium magnetometer was equipped on the Mariner 4 spacecraft to Mars like the Venus probe a year earlier, no magnetic field was detected. Mariner 5 used a similar device For this experiment a low-field helium magnetometer was used to obtain triaxial measurements of interplanetary and Venusian magnetic fields. Similar in accuracy to the triaxial flux-gated magnetometers this device produced more reliable data.
Other types.
Overhauser magnetometer provides extremely accurate measurements of the strength of the magnetic field. The Orsted (satellite) uses this type of magnetometer to map the magnetic fields over the surface of the earth. 
On the Vanguard 3 mission (1959) a proton processional magnetometer was used to measure geomagnetic fields. The proton source was hexane.
Configurations of magnetometers.
Unlike ground based magnetometers that can be oriented by the user to determine the direction of magnetic field, in space the user is linked by telecommunications to a satellite traveling at 25,000 km per hour. The magnetometers used need to give an accurate reading quickly to be able to deduce magnetic fields. Several strategies can be employed, it is easier to rotate a space craft about its axis than to carry the weight of an additional magnetometer. Other strategy is to increase the size of the rocket, or make the magnetometer lighter and more effective. One of the problems, for example in studying planets with low magnetic fields like Venus, does require more sensitive equipment. The equipment has necessarily needed to evolve for today's modern task. Ironically satellites launched more the 20 years ago still have working magnetometers in places where it would take decades to reach today, at the same time the latest equipment is being used to analyze changes in the Earth here at home.
Uniaxial.
These simple fluxgate magnetometers were used on many missions. On Pioneer 6 and Injun 1 the magnetometers were mounted to a bracket external to the space craft and readings were taken as the spacecraft rotated every 120°. Pioneer 7 and Pioneer 8 are configured similarly. The fluxgate on Explorer 6 was mounted along the spin axis to verify spacecraft tracking magnetic field lines. Search coil magnetometers were used on Pioneer 1, Explorer 6, Pioneer 5, and Deep Space 1.
Diaxial.
A two axis magnetometer was mounted to the ATS-1 (Applications Technology Satellite). One sensor was on a 15 cm boom and the other on the spacecraft's spin axis (Spin stabilized satellite). The sun was used to sense the position of the boom mounted device, and triaxial vector measurements could be calculated. Compared to other boom mounted magnetometers, this configuration had considerable interference. Interestingly with this spacecraft, the sun induce magnetic oscillations and this allowed the continued use of the magnetometer after the sun sensor failed. Explorer 10 had two fluxgate magnetometers but is technically classified as a dual technique since it also had a rubidium vapor magnetometer.
Triaxial.
The Sputnik-3 had a vector fluxgate magnetometer, however because the orientation of the spacecraft could not be determined the direction vector for the magnetic field could not be determined. Three axis magnetometers were used on Luna 1, Luna 2, Pioneer Venus, Mariner 2, Venera 1, Explorer 12, Explorer 14, and Explorer 15. Explorer 33 was 'to be' the first US spacecraft to enter stable orbit around the moon was equipped with the most advanced magnetometer, a boom-mounted triaxial fluxgate (GFSC) magnetometer of the early-vector type. It had a small range but was accurate to a resolution of 0.25 nT. However after a rocket failure it was left in a highly elliptical orbit around Earth that orbited through the electro/magnetic tail. The Pioneer 9 and Explorer 34 used a configuration similar to Explorer 33 to survey the magnetic field within Earth's solar orbit. Explorer 35 was the first of its type to enter stable orbit around the moon, this proved important because with the sensitive triaxial magnetometer on board, it was found the moon effectively had no magnetic field, no radiation belt, and solar winds directly impacted the moon. Lunar Prospector surveyed for surface magnetism around the moon (1998–99), using the triaxial (extended) magnetometers. With Apollo 12 improved magnetometers were placed on the moon as part of the Lunar Module/Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package
(ALSEP). The magnetometer continued to work several months after that return module departed. As part of the Apollo 14 ALSEP, there was a portable magnetometer. 
The first use of the three axis ring-coil magnetometer was on the Apollo 16 moon mission. Subsequently is was used on the Magsat. The MESSENGER mission has triaxial ring-coil magnetometer with a range of +/- 1000 mT and a sensitivity of 0.02 mT, still in progress, the mission is designed to get detailed information about Mercurian magnetosphere. The first use of spherical magnetometer in three axis configuration was on the Orsted (satellite).
Dual technique.
Each type of magnetometer has its own built in 'weakness'. This can result from the design of the magnetometer to the way the magnetometer interacts with the spacecraft, radiation from the sun, resonances, etc. Using completely different design is a way to measure which readings are the result of natural magnetic fields and the sum of magnetic fields altered by spacecraft systems. 
In addition each type has its strengths. The fluxgate type is relatively good at providing data that finds magnetic sources. One of the first Dual technique systems was the abbreviated Explorer 10 mission which used a rubidium vapor and biaxial fluxgate magnetometers. Vector helium is better at tracking magnetic field lines and as a scalar magnetometer. Cassini spacecraft used a Dual Technique Magnetometer. One of these devices is the ring-coil vector fluxgate magnetometer (RCFGM). The other device is a vector/scalar helium magnetometer. The RCFGM is mounted 5.5 m out on an 11 m boom with the helium device at the end.
Explorer 6 (1959) used a search coil magnetometer to measure the gross magnetic field of the Earth and vector fluxgate., however because of induced magnetism is the space craft the fluxgate sensor became saturated and did not send data. Future missions would attempt to place magnetometers further away from the space craft. 
Magsat Earth geological satellite was also Dual Technique. This satellite and Grm-A1 carried a scalar cesium vapor magnetometer and vector fluxgate magnetometers. The Grm-A1 satellite carrier the magnetometer on 4 meter boom. This particular spacecraft was designed to hold in a precised equi-gravitational orbit, while taking measurements. For purposes similar to Magsat, the Ørsted satellite, also used a dual technique system. The Overhauser magnetometer is situated at the end of an 8 meter long boom, in order to minimize disturbances from the satellite's electrical systems. The CSC fluxgate magnetometer is located inside the body and associated with a star tracking device. One of the greater accomplishments of the two missions, the Magsat and Orsted missions happen to capture a period of great magnetic field change, with the potential of a loss of dipole, or pole reversal.
By Mounting.
The simplest magnetometer implementations are mounted directly to their vehicles. However, this places the sensor close to potential interferences such as vehicle currents and ferrous materials. For relatively insensitive work, such as "compasses" (attitude sensing) in Low Earth orbit, this may be sufficient. 
The most sensitive magnetometer instruments are mounted on long booms, deployed away from the craft (e.g., the Voyagers, Cassini). Many contaminant fields then decrease strongly with distance, while background fields appear unchanged. Two magnetometers may be mounted, one only partially down the boom. The vehicle body's fields will then appear different at the two distances, while background fields may or may not change significantly over such scales. Magnetometer booms for vector instruments must be rigid, to prevent additional flexing motions from appearing in the data. 
Some vehicles mount magnetometers on simpler, existing appendages, such as specially-designed solar arrays (e.g., Mars Global Surveyor, Juno. This saves the cost and mass of a separate boom. However, a solar array must have its cells carefully implemented and tested to avoid becoming a contaminating field.

Armant (dog)

Armant (also known as Egyptian Sheepdog) is a medium-sized breed of herding dog.
History.
Armants originate from Egypt and were originally used as guard dogs. It is believed to be a descendant of European dogs, that were introduced by Napoleon's troops, crossed with Briards. They are named after the town of Armant in Egypt. The breed's fearlessness when confronted by predators as well as its loyalty see them put to use in Egypt as guard dogs.
Description.
A typical dog is at the withers and weighs between . It has a large head, small eyes and a deep, broad chest. The ears differ in each dog and there is no standard concerning the ears; they may be erect or drooped. Armants can be of multiple colours, the most common of which are the black, black and tan, gray and gray-yellow variations. Armants are a very agile breed. The breed is very obedient and quite protective of its territory, which it will fearlessly defend.
Temperament.
Armants are good working dogs with a fearless and loyal temperament. They generally respond well to training but require a firm owner to accomplish this. They bond well with other animals and are very good with children.
Health.
The average lifespan of an Armant is 13 years, which is typical for a medium-sized breed. The breed is susceptible to hip dysplasia and osteochondritis dissecans.
Influence.
It is theorised that due to the similarities between the breeds, the Armant played a part in the breeding of the Bearded Collie. The breed has remained in use in Egypt and the dogs are still used as guard dogs and for herding.
Present day.
The present-day Armant primarily originates from France and Holland. The breed is unrecognised by the major kennel clubs, including the American Kennel Club and The Kennel Club, however it is recognised by some smaller associations, such the Continental Kennel Club.

<doc id="18403059" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18403059" title="Stev">
Stev

Stev is a form of Scandinavian folk song consisting of four line lyric stanzas. The English version of the word is stave, meaning the stressed syllable in a metric verse.
Various types.
There are various types of "stev":
"Gamlestev".
Of the gamlestev that have been preserved, most of them are from Setesdal and øvre Telemark . This poetic form is equivalent to the metre of the medieval ballad, and is used over most of Northern Europe:
The metre in most old staves is free, and the rhyming is always on the second and fourth line.
Some gamlestev might be remnants of folk songs that have been split up, and thereby losing completeness.
"Nystev".
In Telemark, nystev have been replaced by rural folksongs, to a great extent.
By contrast, nystev in Setesdal have held much of their ground. Many folksongs are based on the form, which rhymes in pairs:
Origin.
Some researchers have presented theories about "stev" "relating to language and poetry rather than to slowed-down dance": Ivar Mortensson-Egnund (in 1914), Idar Handagard (in 1942), O.M. Sandvik, Eivind Groven (1971), Jon Storm-Mathisen (2002 and 2007) and Jacqueline Pattison Ekgren (1975 and 2007). ("Handagard points out that much Norwegian folk poetry, including "stev", has strong elements of alliterative rhyme and rhythm which he claims shows an unbroken tradition from Old Norse folk poetry. Storm-Mathisen demonstrates in his writing and audio recordings of stanzas from Old Norse eddic "Havamal" sung-recited to "gamlestev" and ballad melodies that there are good arguments for the theory of an unbroken tradition and non-dance origin of "stev".")
"Theories in the last century connecting "nystev" with dance" have been presented by Erik Eggen (in 1928 and 1939), Hallvard Lie (1967), Otto Holzapfel (1993), Ånon Egeland (1998) and Reimund Kvideland (2002). These theories were started by Richard Steffen's claim in 1898 that ""nystev" were originally dance songs, even though he had never seen them danced."
Performers.
A person who can perform a stev, is known as a kveder (or "kvedar"), in Norwegian.
Previously "A good
kvedar had to know knew how to "stevja"", wrote Geirr Lystrup (in 1980). ("To "stevjast" is a social form of
"songkamp" ["song" + "battle"], where the object is to know many stev so one will not be at loss (or become perplexed)."
A kveder from Setesdal, when performing stev, generally sings more slowly, than a kveder from Telemark. One reason for this, may be that Setesdal stev are often more meditative ( or elegiac ), in regard to the stev text.
Notable performances.
In 1945, Aslak Brekke's performance at "liberation of Norway" concert that was held 1945, in the ceremonial hall (the "Aula") at the University of Oslo.
In 1983, a member of Norway's national team of football, Åge Hareide, was honored with a "stev" (performed by another member of the team, Svein Mathisen) related to Hareides receipt of the Norwegian Football Association Gold Watch ( — signifying 25 matches played for Norway's national team). The stev was performed at the banquet in Yugoslavia following a football match of two national teams, and the performer held the head of the lamb that had been eaten at the banquet, while he performed from a tabletop. (The watch was received before the match.)

Goalball at the 2008 Summer Paralympics

Goalball at the 2008 Summer Paralympics was held in the Beijing Institute of Technology Gymnasium from September 7 to September 14. The competition consisted of men's and women's team events, and what had been billed as one of the most open tournaments certainly lived up to expectations.
In the women's gold medal game, the lead changed hands five times, with the USA outlasting China by a score of 6–5, with never more than one goal in it. The winning goal came from Asya Miller with less than a minute to go. 
The gold medal in the men's game was even more dramatic. Lithuania, the current world champions, took advantage of a clutch of penalties in the first half to jump ahead of China by 6 goals to 2 at the half, and looked to be holding on despite a steady comeback. With only 50 seconds on the clock, the Chinese were two goals behind (6–8) but managed to overturn the deficit with three goals in 30 seconds to take the gold 9–8, sending the packed BIT Gymnasium into rapture.
Classfication.
Players are given a classification depending on the type and extent of their disability. Visually impaired athletes in classes B1 through B3 can take part in goalball. Partially sighted players wear blindfolds so that they compete on equal terms with blind players.
Qualification.
There will be 12 men's teams and 8 women's teams taking part in this sport.

JLL Partners

JLL Partners is an American private equity firm focused on leveraged buyout transactions and leveraged recapitalizations of middle-market companies. The firm is headquartered in New York City and was founded in 1987. JLL invests in various industries including food and consumer products, automotive parts, health care, media and telecommunications, commodity and specialty chemicals, building products, transportation, and industrial manufacturing and distribution. The company tends to focus on companies requiring an operational turnaround.
History.
JLL traces its roots back to Gilliam Joseph & Littlejohn, a merchant bank founded in 1987 by William J. Gilliam, Peter A. Joseph and Angus C. Littlejohn Jr. The three founders met in the mid-1980s at the Quadrex Corporation, a small New York brokerage. They initially leased their office space from Bennett S. LeBow, a 1980s corporate raider and fellow Drexel Burnham Lambert client. At Quadrex, Gilliam, the youngest of the three, managed the mergers and acquisitions unit, and the other two reported to him. After a series of successful investments, the three decided to leave Quadrex and set up their own small private equity firm. In 1988, Paul S. Levy, formerly a managing director, at Drexel Burnham Lambert who focused on corporate restructurings and exchange offers, was recruited to join the firm, which was renamed Gilliam Joseph Littlejohn & Levy. Levy helped his new partners secure $150 million of capital for buyout transactions from his former firm, Drexel Burnham Lambert.
JLL experienced an early success with the leveraged buyout of Rexene Corp, a Texas-based chemical company, which made the partners multi-millionaires. Gilliam would eventually set up his own small investment firm Gilliam & Company to focus on investments in chemicals and plastics and would serve as chairman of Rexene. In 1991, Gilliam, faced a similar falling out with the board of Rexene and abruptly resigned.
JLL's investment funds have experienced mixed results. According to data from Private Equity Intelligence, JLL Partners Fund III and V have proven to be top-performing for their respective vintage years, however funds I and IV were slightly below the median for their vintage years and the returns on fund II were in the bottom quartile of 1994 vintage funds.
In 1996, Angus Littlejohn resigned from Joseph Littlejohn & Levy to form a new private investment firm, Littlejohn & Co. The following year, in 1998, Peter Joseph left and joined Palladium Equity Partners, a middle-market private equity firm with a specialization in investments in the U.S. Hispanic market and also in Mexico, Spain, and Brazil, founded the prior year.
In 2002, after a lengthy and difficult fund-raising process, the rechristened "JLL Partners" was able to close a new private equity fund, JLL Partners Fund IV LP., with $750 million of investor commitments, representing a 25% decrease from its previous fund.
Funds raised.
Since its founding, JLL has raised six private equity funds with investor commitments totaling $7.2 billion of investor commitments:

Etoka (; Adyghe: Ят1экъуэ, "Yatheque") is a mountain creek, a tributary of Podkumok River (near Pyatigorsk), in Predgorny District, Stavropol Krai and north of Zolsky District, Kabardino-Balkaria Russia. A village with the same name is located by Etoka.
Water from the river is channeled to feed Lake Tambukan. However this water have led to desalinization of the lake, threatening its balneological properties and disrupting the overal ecology of the area.
The etymology of the name is from the Adyghe language: "Ят1э, clay/mud" + "къуэ, valley"

Agustín Landa Verdugo

Agustín Landa Verdugo (1923 – 3 October 2009) was a Mexican architect and urban planner, born in Mexico City. He studied architecture in the National University of Mexico (now UNAM). In 1945 he established a firm with his brother Enrique, with whom he designed hundreds of public and private buildings during four decades of partnership. The firm's work distinguished itself by its modern language and the efficiency and economy of the solutions it proposed.
The work of Landa Verdugo's firm was influential in many areas of architecture in Mexico, including the design of hospitals and social housing, where its pioneering designs became standards for younger architects.
As an urban planner, Agustin Landa Verdugo was the author of the master plan of a number of new cities and neighborhoods in Mexico, most notably the city of Cancún, which was built in the early 1970s in an uninhabited island in the state of Quintana Roo.
Hospitals.
Some of the earliest major projects by Landa Verdugo were public hospitals for the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) in cities such as Delicias, Chih., and Puebla, Pue., built between 1952 and 1956. The experience gained in these projects would prove valuable when, in 1959, the government requested from his firm the design of a network of fifty-five health facilities in Mexico City.
The Institute for Social Security and Services for State Workers (ISSSTE) assumed the responsibility to provide health services for its members in 1958. For this purpose, it needed hospitals and clinics that would satisfy the large demand. Landa Verdugo thus conceived a large, central hospital with 600 beds, named Hospital 20 de Noviembre, as well as six smaller hospitals and forty-eight clinics, built after two standard models. The hospitals and clinics included, in addition to their medical functions, pharmacies and day-care centers.
According to architecture critic Miquel Adria, the Hospital 20 de Noviembre is one of the "25 most significant buildings from the 20th century in Mexico".
Housing Units.
Soon after his work for the ISSSTE, Landa Verdugo began working on ambitious public housing complexes. The first of such complex was Loma Hermosa, in Mexico City, with 1,648 apartments for bureaucrats. The project, funded by the Inter-American Development Bank and inaugurated in 1964, consists of 76 four-story slabs in a large plot of land surrounded by wide avenues and with no internal circulations for cars. Instead, circulations are pedestrian, and large areas are destined for gardens, schools and commercial spaces.
The buildings in Loma Hermosa are made of traditional masonry and concrete columns integrated into the walls. This proved to be an efficient layout and structure, and it was repeated by the state's housing agencies in many of the social housing complexes built in Mexico City and other parts of the country during the 1960s.
In the later part of his career, Agustín Landa Verdugo began experimenting with different spatial organizations in his housing units. Two projects from the seventies, commissioned by INFONAVIT, are the Ejército Nacional and Pedregal de Carrasco housing units. These projects consist of modules of six by six meters that are organized in patterns that respond to the topography and shape of lots where they were built.
The Ejército Nacional unit, finished in 1974, is of special interest because it was built on an unused plot of land inside a city block. It is one of the first infills in the history of Mexican architecture. This project was part of a strategy by INFONAVIT, the country's main public housing agency, called "Aprovechamiento de terrenos baldíos urbanizados" (Taking advantage of abandoned urban plots).
Urban Planning.
The first major urban planning project by Landa Verdugo was the master plan of Ciudad Sahagún, in the state of Hidalgo. In the early fifties, as the country's economy was rapidly industrialized, new spaces for large factories were required, outside the saturated major cities of the country. President Miguel Alemán thus commissioned Landa Verdugo's firm to conceive a new city, in an agricultural valley to the north-east of Mexico City. The commission included the design of the urban layout as well as housing, commercial spaces and the facilities for two of the factories that would operate in the new city.
Agustin Landa Verdugo's firm then began drawing the plans of the new tourist centers. In the case of Cancún, since there was no town in the site selected, the city was built from scratch. Ixtapa, on the other hand, was built next to the preexisting town of Zihuatanejo. Both projects contemplated areas for hotels, a convention center, luxury housing, golf courses as well as housing and services for the city's permanent population.
In addition to the master plan, Landa Verdugo designed Cancún's first hotel, Hyatt Cancún Caribe, the control tower and hall of the temporary airport that was used during the construction of the city, from 1969 to 1974, and the first houses and camping grounds that were used by the engineers and construction workers that first arrived to work in Cancún.
Landa Verdugo's firm also worked on projects for other tourist cities. From 1974 on, however, these were developed within the government agency that coordinated these projects (FONATUR).
Other Notable Projects.
Other notable projects by architect Agustín Landa Verdugo include the French Parish in Mexico City, for the French Catholic Community, the original facilities of the National Free Textbook Commission (CONALITEG) of the Secretariat of Public Education, and an unbuilt proposal from 1967 to build a new international airport for Mexico City in the town of Zumpango.
Other Assignments.
Agustín Landa Verdugo taught at the National University of Mexico for twenty years, from 1948 to 1968. Together with his brother, he presided over one of the school's architecture workshops (Taller 5). Among their students were noted architects and planners Rodolfo Barragán Schwarz, Javier Solórzano and Imanol Ordorika. The latter two worked in Landa Verdugo's firm as workshop leaders.
In addition to his architecture practice and his work in the university, Landa Verdugo led the Bank of Mexico's housing fund (FOVI) from 1963 to 1964, and participated in the creation of the national tourism fund (FONATUR).
In 1990, Agustín Landa Verdugo received the silver medal in the first Mexican architecture biennale for a convent built in Huixquilucan.

Nursing

Nursing is a profession within the health care sector focused on the care of individuals, families, and communities so they may attain, maintain, or recover optimal health and quality of life.
Nurses may be differentiated from other health care providers by their approach to patient care, training, and scope of practice. Nurses practice in a wide diversity of practice areas with a different scope of practice and level of prescriber authority in each. Many nurses provide care within the ordering scope of physicians, and this traditional role has come to shape the historic public image of nurses as care providers. However, nurses are permitted by most jurisdictions to practice independently in a variety of settings depending on training level. In the postwar period, nurse education has undergone a process of diversification towards advanced and specialized credentials, and many of the traditional regulations and provider roles are changing.
Nurses develop a plan of care, working collaboratively with physicians, therapists, the patient, the patient's family and other team members, that focuses on treating illness to improve quality of life. In the U.S. (and increasingly the United Kingdom), advanced practice nurses, such as clinical nurse specialists and nurse practitioners, diagnose health problems and prescribe medications and other therapies, depending on individual state regulations. Nurses may help coordinate the patient care performed by other members of a health care team such as therapists, medical practitioners and dietitians. Nurses provide care both interdependently, for example, with physicians, and independently as nursing professionals.
The American Nurses Association (ANA) states nursing is the protection, promotion, and optimization of health and abilities, prevention of illness and injury, alleviation of suffering through the diagnosis and treatment of human response, and advocacy in the care of individuals, families, communities, and populations.
History.
Traditional nursing.
Before the foundation of modern nursing, nuns and the military often provided nursing-like services. The Christian churches have been long term patrons of nursing and influential in the development of the ethos of modern nursing. Elsewhere, other nursing traditions developed, such as in Islam.
From its earliest days, and following the edicts of Jesus, Christianity had encouraged its devotees to tend the sick. Priests were often also physicians. According to the historian Geoffrey Blainey, while pagan religions seldom offered help to the infirm, the early Christians were willing to nurse the sick and take food to them - notably during the small pox epidemic of AD 165-180 and the measles outbreak of around AD 250 and that "In nursing the sick and dying, regardless of religion, the Christians won friends and sympathisers". Christian emphasis on practical charity gave rise to the development of systematic nursing and hospitals after the end of the persecution of the early church. Ancient church leaders like St. Benedict of Nursia (480) emphasised medicine as an aid to the provision of hospitality. Ancient Catholic orders like the Dominicans and Carmelites have long lived in religious communities that work for the care of the sick. The religious and military roots of modern nursing remain in evidence today in many countries, for example in the United Kingdom, senior female nurses are known as "sisters". Nurses execute the orders of M.D.s, PAs, and NPs in addition to being responsible for their own practice.
The first nurse was Phoebe, mentioned in Romans 16:1. During the early years of the Christian Church, St. Paul sent a deaconess Phoebe to Rome as the first visiting nurse. She took care of both women and men.
According to Geoffrey Blainey, during the Middle Ages, the Catholic Church in Europe provided many of the services of a welfare state: "It conducted hospitals for the old and orphanages for the young; hospices for the sick of all ages; places for the lepers; and hostels or inns where pilgrims could buy a cheap bed and meal". It supplied food to the population during famine and distributed food to the poor. This welfare system the church funded through collecting taxes on a large scale and possessing large farmlands and estates. Monasteries of this era were diligent in the study of medicine, as were convents.
The Eastern Orthodox Church had established many hospitals in the Mid East, but following the rise of Islam from the 7th century, Arabic medicine developed in this region, where a number of important advances were made and an Islamic tradition of nursing begun. Arab ideas were later influential in Europe. The famous Knights Hospitaller arose as a group of individuals associated with an Amalfitan hospital in Jerusalem, which was built to provide care for poor, sick or injured Christian pilgrims to the Holy Land. Following the capture of the city by Crusaders, the order became a military as well as infirmarian order.
A number of saints and orders like the Franciscans are recalled for tending the sick during the devastating bubonic plagues, but these events exposed the near impotence of the Medieval medicine to explain disease and prompted critical examination.
During the Reformation of the 16th century, Protestant reformers shut down the monasteries and convents, allowing a few to continue in operation hundred municipal hospices. Those nuns who had been serving as nurses were given pensions or told to get married and stay home. Nursing care went to the inexperienced as traditional caretakers, rooted in the Roman Catholic Church, were removed from their positions. These caretakers were scorned as the "consorts of prostitutes and drunks," since many of the hospitalized ill were indigent. The nursing profession suffered a major setback for approximately 200 years, only to be rescued by individuals, not organizations, in the nineteenth century. In Catholic nations and religiously tolerant areas however, the role of the nursing sister continued uninterrupted.
19th century.
The Crimean War was a significant development in nursing history when English nurse Florence Nightingale laid the foundations of professional nursing. Her short books "Notes on Nursing" became popular.
Other important nurses in the development of the profession include: 
Dame Agnes Hunt from Shropshire, was the first "orthopaedic' nurse and was pivotal in the emergence of the orthopaedic hospital called 'The Robert Jones & Agnes Hunt Hospital'in Oswestry, Shropshire.
New Zealand was the first country to regulate nurses nationally, with adoption of the Nurses Registration Act on 12 September 1901.
Nurses have experienced difficulty with the hierarchy in medicine that has resulted in an impression that nurses' primary purpose is to follow the direction of physicians. This tendency is certainly not observed in Nightingale's "Notes on Nursing", where the physicians are mentioned relatively infrequently, and often in critical tones—particularly relating to bedside manner.
In the early 1900s, the autonomous, nursing-controlled, Nightingale era schools came to an end – schools became controlled by hospitals, and formal "book learning" was discouraged. Hospitals and physicians saw women in nursing as a source of free or inexpensive labor. Exploitation was not uncommon by nurse’s employers, physicians and educational providers. Nursing practice was controlled by medicine.
The modern era has seen the development of nursing degrees and nursing has numerous journals to broaden the knowledge base of the profession. Nurses are often in key management roles within health services and hold research posts at universities.
Church sponsored hospitals and nursing.
Catholic women's religious institutes continued to spread their ministry in nursing, with orders like the Little Sisters of the Poor (aged care), Sisters of Mercy, Sisters of St. Mary, St. Francis Health Services, Inc. and Sisters of Charity developing large international hospital and hospice networks that helped shape the hospital and nursing systems of the modern world.
The Protestant churches reentered the health field, especially by setting up orders of women, called deaconesses who dedicated themselves to nursing services.
The modern deaconess movement began in Germany in 1836 when Theodor Fliedner and his wife opened the first deaconess motherhouse in Kaiserswerth on the Rhine. It became a model and within a half century were over 5,000 deaconesses in Europe. The Church of England named its first deaconess in 1862. The North London Deaconess Institution trained deaconesses for other dioceses and some served overseas.
William Passavant in 1849 brought the first four deaconesses to Pittsburgh, in the United States, after visiting Kaiserswerth. They worked at the Pittsburgh Infirmary (now Passavant Hospital).
The American Methodists – the largest Protestant denomination—engaged in large scale missionary activity in Asia and elsewhere in the world, making medical services a priority as early as the 1850s. Methodists in America took note, and began opening their own charitable institutions such as orphanages and old people's homes after 1860. In the 1880s, Methodists began opening hospitals in the United States, which served people of all religious backgrounds beliefs. By 1895 13 hospitals were in operation in major cities. well 
Lutherans in the U.S. in 1884 brought seven sisters from Germany to run the German hospital in Philadelphia. By 1963 the Lutheran Church in America had centers for deaconess work in Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Omaha.
Military nursing.
With British public opinion shocked by Nightingale's revelations about the poor care of soldiers in the Crimean War, activists pushed for reform. In 1860 Queen Victoria ordered a hospital to be built to train Army nurses and surgeons, the Royal Victoria Hospital. The hospital opened in 1863 in Netley and admitted and cared for military patients. Beginning in 1866, nurses were formally appointed to Military General Hospitals. The Army Nursing Service (ANS) oversaw the work of the nurses starting in 1881. These military nurses were sent overseas beginning with the First Boer War (often called Zulu War) from 1879 to 1881. They were also dispatched to serve during the Egyptian Campaign in 1882 and the Sudan War of 1883 to 1884. During the Sudan War members of the Army Nursing Service nursed in hospital ships on the Nile as well as the Citadel in Cairo. Almost 2000 nurses served during the second Boer War, the Anglo-Boer War of 1899 to 1902, alongside nurses who were part of the colonial armies of Australia, Canada and New Zealand. They served in tented field hospitals. 23 Army Nursing sisters from Britain lost their lives from disease outbreaks.
Nursing schools.
The Nightingale model of professional education spread widely in Europe and North America after 1870. Even so, as late as the 1870s, "women working in North American urban hospitals typically were untrained, working class, and accorded lowly status by both the medical profession they supported and society at large". Nursing had the same status in Great Britain and continental Europe before World War I.
Hospital nursing schools in the United States and Canada took the lead in applying Nightingale's model to their training programmers:
World War I.
Britain.
By the beginning of World War I, military nursing still had only a small role for women in Britain; 10,500 nurses enrolled in Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service (QAIMNS) and the Princess Mary's Royal Air Force Nursing Service. These services dated to 1902 and 1918, and enjoyed royal sponsorship. There also were Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD) nurses who had been enrolled by the Red Cross. The ranks that were created for the new nursing services were Matron-in-Chief, Principal Matron, Sister and Staff Nurses. Women joined steadily throughout the War. At the end of 1914, there were 2,223 regular and reserve members of the QAIMNS and when the war ended there were 10,404 trained nurses in the QAIMNS.
Australian nurses served in the war as part of the Australian General Hospital. Australia established two hospitals at Lemnos and Heliopolis Islands to support the Dardanelles campaign at Gallipoli. During the course of the war, Australian nurses were granted their own administration rather than working under medical officers. Their work routinely included administering ether during haemostatic surgery and managing and training male medical assistants (orderlies).
World War II.
In early 1942, sixty-five front line nurses from the General Hospital Division in Singapore were ordered back home aboard two ships. The Japanese sank one ship; the 21 surviving nurses swam ashore but the Japanese captured and shot them at the Banka Island massacre. Sister Vivian Bullwinkel was the only survivor. She became Australia's premier nursing war hero.
United States.
As Campbell (1984) shows, the nursing profession was transformed by World War Two. Army and Navy nursing was highly attractive and a larger proportion of nurses volunteered for service higher than any other occupation in American society.
The public image of the nurses was highly favorable during the war, as the simplified by such Hollywood films as "Cry 'Havoc'" which made the selfless nurses heroes under enemy fire. Some nurses were captured by the Japanese, but in practice they were kept out of harm's way, with the great majority stationed on the home front. However, 77 were stationed in the jungles of the Pacific, where their uniform consisted of "khaki slacks, mud, shirts, mud, field shoes, mud, and fatigues." The medical services were large operations, with over 600,000 men and women, ten enlisted men for every nurse. The nurses were all women and all officers. WACs (enlisted women) were used as hospital orderlies. Nearly all the doctors were men, with women doctors allowed only to examine the WAC.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt hailed the service of nurses in the war effort in his final "Fireside Chat" of January 6, 1945, and urged an induction act to raise the number of nurses in the war service by Congress.
Britain.
During World War II, nurses belonged to Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Service (QAIMNS), as they had during World War I, and as they remain today. (Nurses belonging to the QAIMNS are informally called "QA"s.) Members of the Army Nursing Service served in every overseas British military campaign during World War II, as well as at military hospitals in Britain. At the beginning of World War II, nurses held officer status with equivalent rank, but were not commissioned officers. In 1941, emergency commissions and a rank structure were created, conforming with the structure used in the rest of the British Army. Nurses were given rank badges and were now able to be promoted to ranks from Lieutenant through to Brigadier. Nurses were exposed to all dangers during the War, and some were captured and became prisoners of war.
Germany.
Germany had a very large and well organized nursing service, with three main organizations, one for Catholics, one for Protestants, and the DRK (Red Cross). In 1934 the Nazis set up their own nursing unit, the Brown Nurses, absorbing one of the smaller groups, bringing it up to 40,000 members. It set up kindergartens, hoping to seize control of the minds of the younger Germans, in competition with the other nursing organizations. Civilian psychiatric nurses who were Nazi party members participated in the killings of invalids, although the process was shrouded in euphemisms and denials.
Military nursing was primarily handled by the DRK, which came under partial Nazi control. Front line medical services were provided by male medics and doctors. Red Cross nurses served widely within the military medical services, staffing the hospitals that perforce were close to the front lines and at risk of bombing attacks. Two dozen were awarded the highly prestigious Iron Cross for heroism under fire. They are among the 470,000 German women who served with the military.
Definition.
Although nursing practice varies both through its various specialties and countries, these nursing organizations offer the following definitions:
nursing home in Norway]]
The authority for the practice of nursing is based upon a social contract that delineates professional rights and responsibilities as well as mechanisms for public accountability. In almost all countries, nursing practice is defined and governed by law, and entrance to the profession is regulated at the national or state level.
The aim of the nursing community worldwide is for its professionals to ensure quality care for all, while maintaining their credentials, code of ethics, standards, and competencies, and continuing their education. There are a number of educational paths to becoming a professional nurse, which vary greatly worldwide; all involve extensive study of nursing theory and practice as well as training in clinical skills.
Nurses care for individuals of all ages and cultural backgrounds who are healthy and ill in a holistic manner based on the individual's physical, emotional, psychological, intellectual, social, and spiritual needs. The profession combines physical science, social science, nursing theory, and technology in caring for those individuals.
To work in the nursing profession, all nurses hold one or more credentials depending on their scope of practice and education. A Licensed practical nurse (LPN) (also referred to as a Licensed vocational nurse, Registered practical nurse, Enrolled nurse, and State enrolled nurse) works independently or with a Registered nurse (RN). The most significant differentiation between an LPN and RN is found in the requirements for entry to practice, which determines entitlement for their scope of practice. For example, Canada requires a bachelors degree for the RN and a two-year diploma for the LPN. A Registered nurse (RN) provides scientific, psychological, and technological knowledge in the care of patients and families in many health care settings. Registered nurses may earn additional credentials or degrees.
In the USA, multiple educational paths will qualify a candidate to sit for the licensure examination as a registered nurse. The Associate Degree in Nursing (ADN) is awarded to the nurse who has completed a two-year undergraduate academic degree awarded by community colleges, junior colleges, technical colleges, and bachelor's degree-granting colleges and universities upon completion of a course of study usually lasting two years. The Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) is awarded to the nurse who has earned an American four-year academic degree in the science and principles of nursing, granted by a tertiary education university or similarly accredited school. After completing either the LPN or either RN education programs in the USA, graduates are eligible to sit for the a licensing examination to become a nurse, the passing of which is required for the nursing license.
RNs may also pursue different roles as advanced practice registered nurses.
Nurses may follow their personal and professional interests by working with any group of people, in any setting, at any time. Some nurses follow the traditional role of working in a hospital setting.
Around the world, nurses have been traditionally female. Despite equal opportunity legislation, nursing has continued to be a female-dominated profession. For instance, the male-to-female ratio of nurses is approximately 1:19 in Canada and America. This ratio is represented around the world. Notable exceptions include Francophone Africa, which includes the countries of Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Guinea, Gabon, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Rwanda, Senegal, and Togo, which all have more male than female nurses. In Europe, in countries such as Spain, Portugal, Czechoslovakia, and Italy, over 20% of nurses are male.
Nursing theory and process.
Nursing practice is the actual provision of nursing care. In providing care, nurses implement the nursing care plan using the nursing process. This is based around a specific nursing theory which is selected based on the care setting and population served. In providing nursing care, the nurse uses both nursing theory and best practice derived from nursing research.
In general terms, the nursing process is the method used to assess and diagnose needs, plan outcomes and interventions, implement interventions, and evaluate the outcomes of the care provided. Like other disciplines, the profession has developed different theories derived from sometimes diverse philosophical beliefs and paradigms or worldviews to help nurses direct their activities to accomplish specific goals.
Practice settings.
Nurses practice in a wide range of settings, from hospitals to visiting people in their homes and caring for them in schools to research in pharmaceutical companies. Nurses work in occupational health settings (also called industrial health settings), free-standing clinics and physician offices, nurse-led clinics, long-term care facilities and camps. They also work on cruise ships and in military service. Nurses act as advisers and consultants to the health care and insurance industries. Many nurses also work in the health advocacy and patient advocacy fields at companies such as Health Advocate, Inc. helping in a variety of clinical and administrative issues. Some are attorneys and others work with attorneys as legal nurse consultants, reviewing patient records to assure that adequate care was provided and testifying in court. Nurses can work on a temporary basis, which involves doing shifts without a contract in a variety of settings, sometimes known as "per diem nursing", "agency nursing" or "travel nursing". Nurses work as researchers in laboratories, universities, and research institutions. Nurses have also been delving into the world of informatics, acting as consultants to the creation of computerized charting programs and other software.
Work environment.
Internationally, there is a serious shortage of nurses. One reason for this shortage is due to the work environment in which nurses practice. In a recent review of the empirical human factors and ergonomic literature specific to nursing performance, nurses were found to work in generally poor environmental conditions. De Lucia, Otto, & Palmier (2009) concluded, "the profession of nursing as a whole is overloaded because there is a nursing shortage. Individual nurses are overloaded. They are overloaded by the number of patients they oversee. They are overloaded by the number of tasks they perform. They work under cognitive overload, engaging in multitasking and encountering frequent interruptions. They work under perceptual overload due to medical devices that do not meet perceptual requirements (Morrow et al., 2005), insufficient lighting, illegible handwriting, and poor labeling designs. They work under physical overload due to long work hours and patient handling demands which leads to a high incidence of MSDs. In short, the nursing work system often exceeds the limits and capabilities of human performance. HF/E research should be conducted to determine how these overloads can be reduced and how the limits and capabilities of performance can be accommodated. Ironically, the literature shows that there are studies to determine whether nurses can effectively perform tasks ordinarily performed by physicians. Results indicate that nurses can perform such tasks effectively. Nevertheless, already overloaded nurses should not be given more tasks to perform. When reducing the overload, it should be kept in mind that under loads also can be detrimental to performance (Mack worth, 1948). Both overloads and under loads are important to consider for improving performance." Some countries and states have passed legislation regarding acceptable nurse-to-patient ratios.
Nursing worldwide.
Australia.
Catholic religious institutes were influential in the development of Australian nursing, founding many of Australia's hospitals - the Irish Sisters of Charity were first to arrive in 1838 and established St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney in 1857 as a free hospital for the poor. They and other orders like the Sisters of Mercy, and in aged care the Sisters of the Little Company of Mary and Little Sisters of the Poor founded hospitals, hospices, research institutes and aged care facilities around Australia.
A census in the 1800s found several hundred nurses working in Western Australia during the colonial period of history, this included Aboriginal female servants who cared for the infirm.
The state nursing licensing bodies amalgamated in Australia in 2011 to become a federal body AHPRA (Australian Health Practitioner Registration Authority). Several divisions of nursing license is available and recognized around the country. 
Australia enjoys the luxury of a national curriculum for vocational nurses, trained at TAFE colleges or private RTO. Both Enrolled and Registered Nurses are identified by the department of immigration as an occupational area of need, although registered nurses are always in shorter supply, and this increases in proportion with specialisation.
In 1986 there were a number of rolling industrial actions around the country, culminating when five thousand Victorian nurses went on strike for eighteen days. The hospitals were able to function by hiring casual staff from each other's striking members, but the increased cost forced a decision in the nurses' favour 
European Union.
In the European Union, the profession of nurse is regulated. A profession is said to be regulated when access and exercise is subject to the possession of a specific professional qualification. The regulated professions database contains a list of regulated professions for nurse in the EU member states, EEA countries and Switzerland. This list is covered by the Directive 2005/36/EC .
United Kingdom.
To practice lawfully as a registered nurse in the United Kingdom, the practitioner must hold a current and valid registration with the Nursing and Midwifery Council. The title "Registered Nurse" can only be granted to those holding such registration. This protected title is laid down in the Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Act, 1997.
First-level nurses.
First-level nurses make up the bulk of the registered nurses in the UK. They were previously known by titles such as RGN (registered general nurse), RSCN (registered sick children's nurse), RMN (registered mental nurse) and RNMS (registered nurse (for the) mentally subnormal). The titles used now are similar, including RNA (registered nurse adult), RNC (registered nurse child), RNMH (registered nurse mental health) and RNLD (registered nurse learning disabilities).
Second-level nurse training is no longer provided, however they are still legally able to practice in the United Kingdom as a registered nurse. Many have now either retired or undertaken conversion courses to become first-level nurses. They are entitled to refer to themselves as registered nurses as their registration is on the Nursing & Midwifery Council register of nurses, although most refer to themselves as ENs or SENs.
There is also scope for advanced practice:
Managers.
Many nurses who have worked in clinical settings for a long time choose to leave clinical nursing and join the ranks of the NHS management. This used to be seen as a natural career progression for those who had reached ward management positions, however with the advent of specialist nursing roles (see above), this has become a less attractive option.
Nonetheless, many nurses fill positions in the senior management structure of NHS organizations, some even as board members. Others choose to stay a little closer to their clinical roots by becoming clinical nurse managers or "modern matrons".
Nurse education.
Pre-registration.
In order to become a registered nurse, and work as such in the NHS, one must complete a program recognized by the Nursing and Midwifery Council. Currently, this involves completing a degree or diploma, available from a range of universities offering these courses, in the chosen branch specialty (see below), leading to both an academic award and professional registration as a 1st level registered nurse. Such a course is a 50/50 split of learning in university (i.e. through lectures, essays and examinations) and in practice (i.e. supervised patient care within a hospital or community setting).
These courses are three (occasionally four) years' long. The first year is known as the common foundation program (CFP), and teaches the basic knowledge and skills required of all nurses. The remainder of the program consists of training specific to the student's chosen branch of nursing. These are:
As of 2013, the Nursing and Midwifery Council will require all new nurses qualifying in England to hold a degree qualification.
Midwifery training is similar in length and structure, but is sufficiently different that it is not considered a branch of nursing. There are shortened (18 month) programmes to allow nurses already qualified in the adult branch to hold dual registration as a nurse and a midwife. Shortened courses lasting 2 years also exist for graduates of other disciplines to train as nurses. This is achieved by more intense study and a shortening of the common foundation program.
Student nurses currently receive a bursary from the government to support them during their nurse training. Diploma students in England receive a non-means-tested bursary of around £6000 per year (with additional allowances for mature students or those with dependent children), whereas degree students have their bursary means tested (and so often receive less). Degree students are, however, eligible for a proportion of the government's student loan, unlike diploma students. In Scotland, however, all student nurses regardless of which course they are undertaking, receive the same bursary in line with the English diploma amount. In Wales only the Degree level course is offered and all nursing students therefore receive a non-means-tested bursary.
Before Project 2000, nurse education was the responsibility of hospitals and was not based in universities; hence many nurses who qualified prior to these reforms do not hold an academic award.
Post-registration.
After the point of initial registration, there is an expectation that all qualified nurses will continue to update their skills and knowledge. The Nursing and Midwifery Council insists on a minimum of 35 hours of education every three years, as part of its post registration education and practice (PREP) requirements.
There are also opportunities for many nurses to gain additional clinical skills after qualification. Cannulation, venepuncture, intravenous drug therapy and male catheterization are the most common, although there are many others (such as advanced life support) which some nurses will undertake.
Many nurses who qualified with a diploma choose to upgrade their qualification to a degree by studying part-time. Many nurses prefer this option to gaining a degree initially, as there is often an opportunity to study in a specialist field as a part of this upgrading. Financially, in England, it is also much more lucrative, as diploma students get the full bursary during their initial training, and employers often pay for the degree course as well as the nurse's salary.
In order to become specialist nurses (such as nurse consultants, nurse practitioners etc.) or nurse educators, some nurses undertake further training above bachelors degree level. Masters degrees exist in various healthcare related topics, and some nurses choose to study for PhDs or other higher academic awards. District nurses and health visitors are also considered specialist nurses, and in order to become such they must undertake specialist training (often in the form of a top up degree (see above) or post graduate diploma).
All newly qualifying district nurses and Health Visitors are trained to prescribe from the Nurse Prescribers' Formulary, a list of medications and dressings typically useful to those carrying out these roles. Many of these (and other) nurses will also undertake training in independent and supplementary prescribing, which allows them (as of 1 May 2006) to prescribe almost any drug in the British National Formulary. This has been the cause of a great deal of debate in both medical and nursing circles.
Canada.
History.
Canadian nursing dates all the way back to 1639 in Quebec with the Augustine nuns. These nuns were trying to open up a mission that cared for the spiritual and physical needs of patients. The establishment of this mission created the first nursing apprenticeship training in North America. In the nineteenth century there were some Catholic orders of nursing that were trying to spread their message across Canada. Most nurses were female and only had an occasional consultation with a physician. Towards the end of the nineteenth century hospital care and medical services had been improved and expanded. Much of this was due to Nightingale's influence. In 1874 the first formal nursing training program was started at the General and Marine Hospital in St. Catharines in Ontario.
Education.
All Canadian nurses and prospective nurses are heavily encouraged by the Canadian Nurses Association to continue their education to receive a baccalaureate degree. They believe that this is the best degree to work towards because it results in better patient outcomes. In addition to helping patients, nurses that have a baccalaureate degree will be less likely to make small errors because they have a higher level of education. A baccalaureate degree also gives a nurse a more critical opinion which gives he or she more of an edge in the field. This ultimately saves the hospital money because they deal with less problematic incidents. All Canadian provinces except for the Yukon and Quebec require that all nurses must have a baccalaureate degree. The basic length of time that it takes to obtain a baccalaureate degree is four years. However, Canada does have a condensed program that is two years long.
Nursing specialty certification is available in nineteen practice areas. According to the Canadian Nurses Association some of those specialties are cardiovascular nursing, community health nursing, critical care nursing, emergency nursing, gerontology nursing, medical-surgical nursing, neuroscience nursing, oncology nursing, orthopedic nursing, psychiatric/mental health nursing, and rehabilitation nursing. Each specialty requires its own test and competencies. Many tests are offered online through the Canadian Nurses Association.
Public opinion.
Canadian nurses hold a lot of responsibility in the medical field and are considered vital. According to the Canadian Nurses Association, "They expect RNs to develop and implement multi-faceted plans for managing chronic disease, treating complex health conditions and assisting them in the transition from the hospital to the community. Canadians also look to RNs for health education and for strategies to improve their health. RNs assess the appropriateness of new research and technology for patients and adjust care plans accordingly".
Japan.
History.
Nursing was not an established part of Japan's healthcare system until 1899 with the Midwives Ordinance. From there the Registered Nurse Ordinance came into play in 1915. This established a legal substantiation to registered nurses all over Japan. A new law geared towards nurses was created during World War II. This law was titled the Public Health Nurse, Midwife and Nurse Law and it was established in 1948. It established educational requirements, standards and licensure. There has been a continued effort to improve nursing in Japan. In 1992 the Nursing Human Resource Law was passed. This law created the development of new university programs for nurses. Those programs were designed to raise the education level of the nurses so that they could be better suited for taking care of the public.
Types of nurses.
Japan only recognizes four types of nursing and they are Public Health Nursing, Midwifery, Registered Nursing and Assistant Nursing.
Public health nursing.
This type of nursing is designed to help the public and is also driven by the public's needs. The goals of public health nurses are to monitor the spread of disease, keep vigilant watch for environmental hazards, educate the community on how to care for and treat themselves, and train for community disasters.
Midwifery.
Nurses that are involved with midwifery are independent of any organization. A midwife takes care of a pregnant woman during labour and postpartum. They assist with things like breastfeeding and caring for the child.
Assistant nursing.
Individuals who are assistant nurses follow orders from a registered nurse. They report back to the licensed nurse about a patient's condition. the Assistant nurses are always supervised by a licensed registered nurse.
Nursing education.
In 1952 Japan established the first nursing university in the country. An Associate Degree was the only level of certification for years. Soon people began to want nursing degrees at a higher level of education. Soon the Bachelors Degree in Nursing (BSN) was established. Currently Japan offers doctorate level degrees of nursing in a good number of its universities.
There are three ways that an individual could become a registered nurse in Japan. After obtaining a high school degree the person could go to a nursing university for four years and earn a Bachelor degree, go to a junior nursing college for three years or go to a nursing school for three years. Regardless of where the individual attends school they must take the national exam. Those who attended a nursing university have a bit of an advantage over those who went to a nursing school. They can take the national exam to be a registered nurse, public health nurse or midwife. In the cases of become a midwife or a public health nurse, the student must take a one year course in their desired field after attending a nursing university and passing the national exam to become a registered nurse. The nursing universities are the best route for someone who wants to become a nurse in Japan. They offer a wider range of general education classes and they also allow for a more rigid teaching style of nursing. These nursing universities train their students to be able to make critical and educated decisions when they are out in the field. Physicians are the ones who are teaching the potential nurses because there are not enough available nurses to teach students. This increases the dominance that physicians have over nurses.
Students that attend a nursing college or just a nursing school receive the same degree that one would who graduated from a nursing university, but they do not have the same educational background. The classes offered at nursing colleges and nursing schools are focused on more practical aspects of nursing. These institutions do not offer many general education classes, so students who attend these schools will solely be focusing on their nursing educations while they are in school. Students who attend a nursing college or school do have the opportunity to become a midwife or a public health nurse. They have to go through a training institute for their desired field after graduating from the nursing school or college. Japanese nurses never have to renew their licenses. Once they have passed their exam, they have their license for life.
Nursing in Japan today.
Like the United States, Japan is in need of more nurses. The driving force behind this need this is the fact that country is aging and needs more medical care for its people. The country needs a rapid increase of nurses however things do not seem to be turning around. Some of the reasons that there is a shortage are poor working conditions, an increase in the number of hospital beds, the low social status of nurses, and the cultural idea that married women quit their jobs for family responsibilities. On average, Japanese nurses will make around 280,000 yen a month, which is one of the higher paying jobs. however, physicians make twice the amount that nurses do in a year. Similar to other cultures, the Japanese people view nurses as subservient to physicians. They are considered lesser and oftentimes negative connotations are associated with nurses. According to the American Nurses Association article on Japan, "nursing work has been described using negative terminology such as "hard, dirty, dangerous, low salary, few holidays, minimal chance of marriage and family, and poor image".
Some nurses in Japan are trying to be advocates. They are promoting better nursing education as well as promoting the care of the elderly. There are some organizations that unite Japanese nurses like the Japanese Nursing Association (JNA). The JNA is not to be confused with a union, it is simply a professional organization for the nurses. Members of the JNA lobby politicians and produces publications about nursing. According to the American Nurses Association's article on Japan the JNA, "works toward the improvement in nursing practice through many activities including the development of a policy research group to influence policy development, a code of ethics for nurses, and standards of nursing practice". The JNA also provides certification for specialists in mental health, oncology and community health. JNA is the not the only nursing organization in Japan. There are other subgroups that are typically categorized by the nurses' specialty, like emergency nursing or disaster nursing. One of the older unions that relates to nursing is the Japanese Federation of Medical Workers Union which was created in 1957. It is a union that includes physicians as well as nurses. This organization was involved with the Nursing Human Resource Law.
United States.
The scope of practice of registered nurses is the extent to and limits of which an RN may practice. In the United States, these limits are determined by a set of laws known as the Nurse Practice Act of the state or territory in which an RN is licensed. Each state has its own laws, rules, and regulations governing nursing care. Usually the making of such rules and regulations is delegated to a state board of nursing, which performs day-to-day administration of these rules, qualifies candidates for censurer, licenses nurses and nursing assistants, and makes decisions on nursing issues. It should be noted that in some states the terms "nurse" or "nursing" may only be used in conjunction with the practice of a Registered Nurse (RN) or licensed practical or vocational nurse (LPN/LVN).
The scope of practice for a registered nurse is wider than for an LPN/LVN because of the level and content of education as well as what the Nurse Practice Act says about the respective roles of each.
In the hospital setting, registered nurses are often assigned a role in which they delegate tasks to LPNs and unlicensed assistive personnel.
RNs are not limited to employment as bedside nurses. Registered nurses are employed by physicians, attorneys, insurance companies, governmental agencies, community/public health agencies, private industry, school districts, ambulatory surgery centers, among others. Some registered nurses are independent consultants who work for themselves, while others work for large manufacturers or chemical companies. Research Nurses conduct or assist in the conduct of research or evaluation (outcome and process) in many areas such as biology, psychology, human development, and health care systems. The average salary for a staff RN in the United States in 2007 was over $60,000.
Educational and licensure requirements.
Diploma in Nursing.
The oldest method of nursing education is the hospital-based diploma program, which lasts approximately three years. Students take between 30 and 60 credit hours in anatomy, physiology, microbiology, nutrition, chemistry, and other subjects at a college or university, then move on to intensive nursing classes. Until 1996, most RNs in the US were initially educated in nursing by diploma programs. According to the Health Services Resources Administration's 2000 Survey of Nurses only six percent of nurses who graduated from nursing programs in the United States received their education at a Diploma School of Nursing.
Associate Degree in Nursing.
The most common initial nursing education is a two-year Associate Degree in Nursing (Associate of Applied Science in Nursing, Associate of Science in Nursing, Associate Degree in Nursing), a two-year college degree referred to as an ADN. Some four-year colleges and universities also offer the ADN. Associate degree nursing programs have many prerequisite and co-requisite courses which ultimately stretch out the degree-acquiring process to about 3 years or greater.
Bachelor of Science in Nursing.
The third method is to obtain a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN), a four-year degree that also prepares nurses for graduate-level education. For the first two years in a BSN program, students usually obtain general education requirements and spend the remaining time in nursing courses. The Bachelor of Science in Nursing degrees have many courses which stretches out the degree-acquiring process to over 4 years. Advocates for the ADN and diploma programs state that such programs have an on the job training approach to educating students, while the BSN is an academic degree that emphasizes research and nursing theory. Some states require a specific amount of clinical experience that is the same for both BSN and ADN students. A BSN degree qualifies its holder for administrative, research, consulting and teaching positions that would not usually be available to those with an ADN, but is not necessary for most patient care functions, although some hospitals are beginning to give preference in hiring to BSN prepared nurses as a rule. Nursing schools may be accredited by either the National League for Nursing Accrediting Commission (NLNAC) or the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE).
Graduate nursing opportunities.
Advanced education in nursing is done at the master's and doctoral levels. It prepares the graduate for specialization as an advanced practice registered nurse (APRN) or for advanced roles in leadership, management, or education. Areas of advanced nursing practice include that of a nurse practitioner (NP), a certified nurse midwife (CNM), a certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA), or a clinical nurse specialist (CNS). Nurse practitioners work assessing, diagnosing and treating patients in fields as diverse as family practice, women's health care, emergency nursing, acute/critical care, psychiatry, geriatrics, or pediatrics, while a CNS usually works for a facility to improve patient care, do research, or as a staff educator. The clinical nurse leader (CNL) is an advanced generalist who focuses on the improvement of quality and safety outcomes for patients or patient populations from an administrative and staff management focus. Doctoral programs in nursing prepare the student for work in nursing education, health care administration, clinical research, or advanced clinical practice. Most programs confer the PhD in nursing and Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP).
Licensure examination.
Completion of any one of these three educational routes allows a graduate nurse to take the NCLEX-RN, the test for licensure as a registered nurse, and is accepted by every state as an adequate indicator of minimum competency for a new graduate. However, controversy exists over the appropriate entry-level preparation of RNs. Some professional organizations believe the BSN should be the sole method of RN preparation and ADN graduates should be licensed as "technical nurses" to work under the supervision of BSN graduates. Others feel the on-the-job experiences of diploma and ADN graduates makes up for any deficiency in theoretical preparation. Regardless of this debate, it is highly unlikely that the BSN will become the standard for initial preparation any time soon, because of the nursing shortage, hospital lobbyist, and the lack of faculty to teach BSN students.
Earnings.
Median annual wages of registered nurses were $62,450 in May 2008. The middle 50 percent earned between $51,640 and $76,570. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $43,410, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $92,240. Median annual wages in the industries employing the largest numbers of registered nurses in May 2008 were:
Employment services $68,160; General medical and surgical hospitals $63,880; Offices of physicians $59,210; Home health care services $58,740; Nursing care facilities $57,060.
Many employers offer flexible work schedules, child care, educational benefits, and bonuses. About 21 percent of registered nurses are union members or covered by union contract.
Top 10 Highest Paying Nursing Specialties
The nursing shortage in the United States.
RNs are the largest group of health care workers in the United States, with about 2.7 million employed in 2011. It has been reported that the number of new graduates and foreign-trained nurses is insufficient to meet the demand for registered nurses; this is often referred to as the nursing shortage and is expected to increase for the foreseeable future. There are data to support the idea that the nursing shortage is a voluntary shortage. In other words, nurses are leaving nursing of their own volition. In 2006 it was estimated that approximately 1.8 million nurses chose not to work as a nurse. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 296,900 healthcare jobs were created in 2011. RN’s make up the majority of the healthcare work force, therefore these positions will be filled primarily by nurses. The BLS also states that by 2020, there will be 1.2 million nursing job openings due to an increase in the workforce, and replacements. (Rosseter, 2012).
Causes of the nursing shortage in the United States.
A national survey prepared by the Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals in 2001 found that one in five nurses plans to leave the profession within five years because of unsatisfactory working conditions, including low pay, severe under staffing, high stress, physical demands, mandatory overtime, and irregular hours. The shortage will also be exacerbated by the increasing numbers of baby-boomer aged nurses who are expected to retire, creating more open positions than there are graduates of nursing programs. The faster than average job growth in this field is also a result of improving medical technology that will allow for treatments of many more diseases and health conditions. Nurses will be strong in demand to work with the rapidly growing population of senior citizens in the United States. Approximately 29.8 percent of all nursing jobs are found in hospitals. However, because of administrative cost cutting, increased nurse's workload, and rapid growth of outpatient services, hospital nursing jobs will experience slower than average growth. Employment in home care and nursing homes is expected to grow rapidly. Though more people are living well into their 80s and 90s, many need the kind of long-term care available at a nursing home. Also, because of financial reasons, patients are being released from hospitals sooner and admitted into nursing homes. Many nursing homes have facilities and staff capable of caring for long-term rehabilitation patients, as well as those afflicted with Alzheimer's. Many nurses will also be needed to help staff the growing number of out-patient facilities, such as HMOs, group medical practices, and ambulatory surgery centers. Nursing specialties will be in great demand. There are, in addition, many part-time employment possibilities.
Aggravating the already disparate ratio of qualified nurses to needed nurses is the ever shrinking qualified nursing faculty pool. Levsey, Campbell, and Green voiced their concern about the shortage of nurses, citing Fang, Wilsey-Wisniewski, & Bednash, 2006 who state that over 40,000 qualified nursing applicants were turned away in the 2005-2006 academic year from baccalaureate nursing programs due to a lack of masters and doctoral qualified faculty, and that this number was increased over 9,000 from 32,000 qualified but rejected students from just two years earlier. Several strategies have been offered to mitigate this shortage including; Federal and private support for experienced nurses to enhance their education, incorporating more hybrid/blended nursing courses, and using simulation in lieu of clinical (hospital) training experiences.
Continuing education.
With health care knowledge growing steadily, nurses can stay ahead of the curve through continuing education. Continuing education classes and programs enable nurses to provide the best possible care to patients, advance nursing careers, and keep up with Board of Nursing requirements. The American Nurses Association and the American Nursing Credentialing Center are devoted to ensuring nurses have access to quality continuing education offerings. Continuing education classes are calibrated to provide enhanced learning for all levels of nurses. Many States also regulate Continuing Nursing Education. Nursing licensing boards requiring Continuing Nursing Education (CNE) as a condition for licensure, either initial or renewal, accept courses provided by organizations that are accredited by other state licensing boards, by the American Nursing Credentialing Center (ANCC), or by organizations that have been designated as an approver of continuing nursing education by ANCC. There are some exceptions to this rule including the state of California, Florida and Kentucky. National Healthcare Institute has created a list to assist nurses in determining their CNE credit hours requirements. While this list is not all inclusive, it offers details on how to contact nursing licensing boards directly.
Nursing board certification.
Professional nursing organizations, through their certification boards, have voluntary certification exams to demonstrate clinical competency in their particular specialty. Completion of the prerequisite work experience allows an RN to register for an examination, and passage gives an RN permission to use a professional designation after their name. For example, passage of the American Association of Critical-care Nurses specialty exam allows a nurse to use the initials 'CCRN' after his or her name. Other organizations and societies have similar procedures.
The American Nurses Credentialing Center, the credentialing arm of the American Nurses Association, is the largest nursing credentialing organization and administers more than 30 specialty examinations.
Nursing specialties.
Nursing is the most diverse of all healthcare professions. Nurses practice in a wide range of settings but generally nursing is divided depending on the needs of the person being nursed.
The major populations are:
There are also specialist areas such as cardiac nursing, orthopedic nursing, palliative care, perioperative nursing, obstetrical nursing, oncology nursing, nursing informatics, telenursing.

The Greatest Love World Tour

The Greatest Love World Tour is a concert tour and the first headlining worldwide tour by American recording artist Whitney Houston in support of her multi-platinum debut album, "Whitney Houston". The tour started at the Merriweather Post Pavilion on July 26, 1986 and was a four-month venture. The 1986 arena tour included shows in North America, Europe, Japan and Australia following the success of the singer's debut album.
History.
Houston's debut album was released in early 1985 and she performed at various clubs to promote the album. Following the success of the hit single "You Give Good Love", Houston became the opening act for singers' Luther Vandross and Jeffrey Osborne on their individual 1985 US tours. After the next single, "Saving All My Love For You" became Houston's first #1 in the US, she began headlining her own shows, playing at various American theaters, festivals, and clubs throughout the summer and fall of 1985. With more #1 hits on the way, and Houston's album at the top of the album charts, she would become a household name. She then embarked on her first worldwide tour, the successful "The Greatest Love World Tour". The tour started in North America during the summer of 1986, before heading to Europe, Japan, Australia and back to USA for a final show in Hawaii during the fall.
The show.
The show consisted of Houston on a fringed round stage in the center of the arena/theater with a 9-piece band playing and four backup vocalists behind her. There were no costume changes or background dancers. Brother Gary Garland would replace Jermaine Jackson and Teddy Pendergrass on the duets. Young New Jersey comedienne Sylvia Traymore opened the show and did hilarious impersonations of such stars as Dionne Warwick, Tina Turner, Cher and others.
While on her first global tour, Houston revealed she was a creative musician; rearranging most of the songs during her shows and sometimes deviating from the album's version. In "You Give Good Love", Houston would slow it down and emphazise the soulful elements of the song, treating it like a gospel number while breaking it down with her background singers. During "Saving All My Love", Houston arranged the song into a bluesy jazz number that recalled Billie Holiday. Houston often scatted with sax player Josh Harris during the end of the song. Many critics noted "He/I Believe" and "I Am Changing" as the show's highlights. The former is a song she learned from her mother which joins the gospel songs "He Is" with "I Believe". The latter is a cover of the show Jennifer Holliday's show stopping Dreamgirls song. After opening the show with a tease of the anthemic "Greatest Love of All", Houston closed out the show with a slowed down soulful version of the song.
"Billboard" magazine's Carlo Wolff said the following on his column for her show at Saratoga Performing Arts Center on July 28, 1986.

Houston and John Simmons were friends from their church in New Jersey. While Houston was trying to get a recording contract, she would perform sets as part of her mother's nightclub act in New York. Simmons was her musical director. Houston asked Simmons to put together a band that would back her during her nightclub act and record label showcases. Houston kept most of the band during her touring career, which consisted of the following:

Boidstones Place

Boidstones Place, also called Greenbrakes and Fountain Rock, was built in 1766 by Thomas Boydston near Shepherdstown, West Virginia on land he was granted by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron. In a dispute with Fairfax and Joist Hite over lands he had acquired along the Terrapin Neck on the Potomac River, Boydston lost most of his lands, which were acquired by Abraham Shepherd. The property formed a portion of the Shepherd's holdings along Shepherd Grade, which were primarily devoted breeding race horses. Some of the property was annexed to the adjoining Wild Goose property, owned by R.D. Shepherd, who had a racetrack there. In 1851 R.D. Shepherd gave Boidstones to his nephew and namesake R. D. Shepherd, Jr. who built the main Greek Revival section of the house. The property was sold out of the Shepherd family in 1886, but was returned to the Shepherds in 1916 for use as a summer place. 
The original house at Boidstone Place is, with the Peter Burr House, the oldest framed building in West Virginia. The 1850s Greek Revival wing is also of wood frame construction. Another addition was made in the 1920s, in the Colonial Revival style.
Other structures on the farm include a log cabin (c. 1850), a log cottage (c. 1850s, altered in 1938), a tenant house (c. 1890), a springhouse (1850s), a garage (1920s), the main barn (c. 1850), a machine shed (c. 1910), a spray shed (c. 1920) and a bull shed (c. 1910) as well as a cemetery for slaves, active from c. 1776 to 1865.
A large spring on the property became known as Stillhouse Spring, where Boydston produced whiskey which was shipped down the river from a dock.

Baitun Nur

Baitun Nur (also spelled Baitunnur or Baitun Noor) (Arabic for "House of Light") is a mosque of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community in the Castleridge community of Calgary, Alberta. 
It is known for being the largest mosque in Canada.
It is estimated that there are about 3,000 members of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community in Calgary.
Public opening.
The cornerstone of the mosque was laid in 2005. Construction was completed in 2008 for an estimated cost of C$ 15 million, with roughly C$ 8 million of that coming from local Calgarians.
Baitun Nur had its grand opening to the public on July 5, 2008, with 5000 people in attendance, including dignitaries such as Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Opposition Leader Stéphane Dion, and Calgary Mayor Dave Bronconnier.
The Roman Catholic Bishop of Calgary, Fred Henry, attended as well.
Mirza Masroor Ahmad, the supreme head of the worldwide Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, oversaw the opening.
While members of various faiths were invited, according to Kaufman of the Edmonton Sun, the Sunni Muslim group Islamic Supreme Council of Canada, led by Syed Soharwardy, was not invited, due to its belief that Ahmadiyya Muslims are not "real" Muslims, and did not consider Baitun Nur a “mosque.”
Praise for the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community came from attendees, including Harper, who said "Calgarians, Albertans and Canadians will see the moderate, benevolent face of Islam in this mosque and the people who worship here." 
According to "Embassy" magazine, regarding Harper's remarks, a governing party insider said "It's an important signal the prime minister is sending, not just to militant Islamists abroad, but to their sympathizers here at home, that he's perfectly prepared to ignore them and side with persecuted minorities within the faith."
Structure.
The mosque complex is in size.
A tall steel-capped minaret tower and large steel dome are the most noticeably externally visible features of the mosque.
Around the exterior of the building are written 99 Arabic words, each an attribute of Allah's character as stated in the Qur'an.
In addition to a place of worship in Calgary, the mosque complex includes classrooms, office space, a children's area, a kitchen and a community centre.
In the prayer hall of the mosque hangs a 400-kilogram chandelier that cost $50,000.
Baitun Nur is the seventh Ahmadiyya mosque by Naseer Ahmad who gave consultation to.

<doc id="18403333" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18403333" title="War of the Lombards">
War of the Lombards

The War of the Lombards (1228–1243) was a civil war in the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Kingdom of Cyprus between the "Lombards" (also called the imperialists), the representatives of the Emperor Frederick II, largely from Lombardy, and the native aristocracy, led first by the Ibelins and then by the Montforts. The war was provoked by Frederick's attempt to control the regency for his young son, Conrad II of Jerusalem. Frederick and Conrad represented the Hohenstaufen dynasty.
Origins.
Frederick had been King of Jerusalem—and as such claimed suzerainty over Cyprus—in right of his wife Isabella II until her death in 1228. That year he arrived first in Cyprus, where he antagonised the nobles, and then in Jerusalem, where he stayed until 1229, leaving in humiliating circumstances after having produced an anti-imperialist reaction in the people. In 1231 he sent Riccardo Filangieri as his marshal. His attempt to assert his authority was opposed by John of Ibelin, the Old Lord of Beirut, who had been regent until Frederick's arrival. On John's death in 1236 the war was taken up by his son Balian. In 1239 Philip of Montfort assumed the leadership of the opposition.
Though the ecclesiastical hierarchy and the Knights Templar supported the nobility, the Teutonic Knights and Knights Hospitaller supported Filangieri. In general his rights as regent were recognised but his practical power was denied on the basis of the Assizes and the Haute Cour. His headquarters were in Tyre and he had the allegiance of Bohemond V, Prince of Antioch and Count of Tripoli. He also held the Holy City of Jerusalem itself, which had been negotiated away from the Saracens by Frederick. So long as the Ibelins controlled the opposition, Filangieri could count on the support of their enemies as well. The Italian cities were also divided between the two factions: Pisa supported Filangieri and Genoa the Ibelins. The Ibelins controlled Beirut, Arsuf, and Caesarea as well as the old capital of Acre. In 1231 the citizens of Acre formed a commune with their headquarters at the church of Saint Andrew's in order to unify their opposition to Filangieri. In 1232 John of Ibelin was elected its mayor.
Course.
The first major battle of the war took place at Casal Imbert in May 1232. Filangieri defeated the Ibelins. In June, however, he was so soundly defeated by an inferior force at the Battle of Agridi in Cyprus that his support on the island dwindled to zero within a year.
In 1241 the barons offered the bailliage of Acre to Simon de Montfort, the Earl of Leicester, a cousin of Philip of Montfort, and a relative through marriage to both the Hohenstaufen and the Plantagenets. He never assumed it. In 1242 or 1243 Conrad declared his own majority and on 5 June the absentee monarch's regency was granted by the Haut Court to Alice, widow of Hugh I of Cyprus and daughter of Isabella I of Jerusalem. Alice promptly began ruling as if queen, ignoring Conrad, who was in Italy, and ordering Filangieri arrested. After a long siege, Tyre fell on 12 June. The Ibelins seized its citadel on 7 or 10 July, with the help of Alice, whose forces arrived on 15 June. Only the Ibelins could claim to be the winners of the war.
Primary sources.
The chief primary source for the War is Philip of Novara's "The Wars of Frederick II Against the Ibelins", which is a highly partisan account favouring the Ibelins. Philip was an active participant in and eyewitness of many of the events he describes. In the 1240s he was handsomely rewarded in money and fiefs by Alice. His "Wars" is generally trusted but is contained in a later compilation called "Les gestes des Chiprois", and it is sometimes difficult to determine if a detail was amended by the compiler. His account, written contemporaneously with events, only covers the years 1228–33, 1236, and 1241–42. He wrote the last part of his account between 1242 and 1247, adding interpolations until as late as 1258. It is Philip that gives the name "Longuebars" (Lombards) to the imperialists.
The Venetian baili Marsilio Zorzi, who arrived in Acre shortly before Alice's election as regent, wrote a report of conditions and recent events in the Levant for his masters in Venice. It is preserved in a manuscript of 1246 and in the fourteenth-century "Liber Albus", but is a less precise, though more contemporaneous, account than Philip's.
Richard of San Germano presents a few details with regards to the beginning of Conrad's rule and the end of Frederick's regency that cannot be found elsewhere. According to him, Tommaso of Aquino, Count of Acerra, left for the Holy Land in June 1242 in connexion with Conrad's assumption of power to be the king's representative in the East. He also mentions that Raymond VII of Toulouse met the emperor at Melfi in September 1242 and intervened on behalf of the defeated Filangieri.

Carel Anton Fodor

Carel Anton Fodor or Carolus Antonius Fodor (12 April 1768 – 22 February 1846) was a Dutch pianist, conductor, and the most prominent composer of his generation in the Netherlands, writing in the manner of Joseph Haydn.
He was born in Venlo He accompanied his older brother, Carolus Emanuel, to Paris at the age of thirteen, to complete his musical studies, perhaps visiting Russia, but returning to Amsterdam in 1790. Concertising in Amsterdam and The Hague, he built a solid reputation in Dutch musical circles as a pianistic virtuoso.
In 1798 he married Geertruida Tersteeg. At the death of Bartholomeus Ruloffs in 1801 he was named conductor of the orchestra of Felix Meritis, which he was to lead for twenty-five years. In the following year he was nominated to the position of the orchestra Eruditio Musica. In 1808 Louis Bonaparte appointed him to head the , precursor of the , the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1811 he established, with Johann Wilhelm Wilms and some others the series of Tuesday concerts. He died, aged 77, in Amsterdam.
Anton Fodor published three symphonies (Opp. 5, 12 and 19), eight piano concertos, and a considerable output of chamber music in which the piano plays the leading role, as well as songs on Dutch texts. His opera, "", has been lost.

The Trial (painting)

The Trial (1947) is a painting by the Australian painter Sidney Nolan. 
This painting depicts Ned Kelly's trial, where Kelly is depicted in handcuffs. A judge and several people look at him in the court. The painting is one of a number by Nolan to use enamel paint, usually Ripolin, a commercial paint not intended for art (and nothing to do with true vitreous enamel). 
Nolan painted the picture at "Heide" at Bulleen, Victoria, the home of John Reed and his wife, Sunday.
Sunday Reed may have helped paint the floor of this painting. She supported Nolan while he painted the Kelly series.
This painting is currently in the National Gallery of Australia. The painting was donated by Sunday Reed. Nolan had left the painting among many others at "Heide". Although Nolan once wrote to Sunday Reed to tell her to take what she wanted, he subsequently demanded all his works back. Sunday Reed returned 284 other paintings and drawings to Nolan, but she refused to give up the 27 remaining Kellys, partly because she saw the works as fundamental to the proposed Heide Museum of Modern Art. Eventually, she gave them to the National Gallery of Australia in 1977 and this resolved the dispute.
In 1973, Nolan reproduced "The Trial" on a woven wool tapestry, which was lent to Admiralty House in Kirribilli, the official Sydney residence of the Governor-General of Australia. The tapestry was Sir John Kerr's favourite backdrop when making televised addresses. It is now located at the Federal Court of Australia in Sydney.

Sumner Slichter

Sumner Huber Slichter (1892–1959) was an American economist and the first Lamont University Professor at Harvard University. Slichter was considered by many to be the pre-eminent labor economist of the 1940s and 1950s.
Education.
Slichter was born in Madison, Wisconsin, the son of Charles Sumner Slichter, a mathematician and dean of the graduate school at the University of Wisconsin. He graduated from the University of Wisconsin in 1913 before earning a Ph.D. at the University of Chicago.
Career.
Following stints at Cornell and Princeton, Slichter moved to Harvard in 1930. After Harvard president James Bryant Conant created university professorships, not tied to any particular department, in 1936, Slichter was named the inaugural Lamont University Professor. He remained at Harvard through the end of his career. Slichter received an honorary degree from Harvard in 1942.
A regular lecturer and contributor to magazines such as Harper's, Slichter was arguably the best-known economist in America at the peak of his career. Slichter's textbook, "Modern Economic Society", was a standard introductory economics textbook in America before 1950.
Slichter was named president of the American Economic Association in 1941.
Though critical of substantial portions of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's economic policy, Slichter served as an informal economic adviser to Harry Truman.
Views.
Slichter was skeptical of the New Deal as a means to provide full employment, arguing that a government guarantee of full employment created perverse incentives for employees.
As World War II drew to a close, most economists predicted that with an end to government spending on the war, the economy would collapse again. Slichter correctly predicted that with soldiers coming home seeking a normal life and material pleasures, the economy would grow strongly after the end of the war and that inflation would be a greater cause for concern than depression.
Slichter was the first major economist to recognize that the pool of labor from comparably skilled workers was not unified across the economy but rather segmented by industry, with supply and demand curves varying as a function of the industry's profitability.
Family.
Sumner Slichter was the brother of geophysicist Louis B. Slichter, father of physicist Charles Pence Slichter, and the grandfather of musician Jacob Slichter.

All the Years

All the Years is a song that was recorded by the rock band Chicago, released on the 2008 album Stone of Sisyphus. It was written by Robert Lamm and studio session musician Bruce Gaitsch, the guitarist from the Night & Day Big Band album.
This song is the third track on the 2008 release. It was supposed to be the opening track on the original 1994 release.
Content.
The song talks about the politics of the early nineties, when the album was recorded. It states how the politics haven't really changed from the late sixties, hence the line, "All the years we wasted, all the years we tried." This song was reminiscent of Lamm's earlier songwriting about politics and being outspoken.
Samples.
All The Years features speeches by Martin Luther King Jr. and other activists from that time period playing in the background at various points of the song. It also includes audio of the protesters at the 1968 Democratic Convention shouting, "The Whole World's Watching." This is a gesture to Chicago's debut album, The Chicago Transit Authority, on the tenth track "Prologue, August 29, 1968."

Sailing at the 2008 Summer Paralympics

Eighty athletes representing 25 countries in three keelboat classes - the 2.4mR, the SKUD 18, and the Sonar, took part in sailing in the 2008 Summer Paralympics. Sailing was held in 2 designated areas on the Yellow Sea, Qingdao, Shandong province, from September 8 to September 13.
Competitors had a wide range of physical disabilities including degenerative nerve disease, blindness, missing limbs and polio.
Boats were prepared and launched from the docks of the Qingdao International Sailing Centre, which also included the accessible Qingdao Paralympic Village, a 5-star hotel which previously housed the Olympic Sailing athletes.
Events.
Three sailing events were held. All were mixed events, meaning that men and women could compete together.
International disability classification in sailing is done by a committee, which gives each competitor a number score with lower numbers corresponding to more severe disability. Sailors were classified under the IFDS Functional Classification System 2005 (FCS 2005). To take part in Paralympic sailing, an athlete must have a score of 7 or less. Functional Classification System full details: [http://www.sailing.org/tools/documents/FINALFCS2009-%5B7144%5D.pdf]
The 2-person keelboat (SKUD18) made its official début in the Paralympics. The only Paralympic class keelboat with a spinnaker, emblazoned with the national flag of each country. Of the 11 countries competing in the SKUD event, 7 had female crew.

Yumurí River

The Rio Yumurí is a river in Cuba, which drains into the Straits of Florida in the historic city (and provincial capital) Matanzas. The river begins in the village of Imias and winds its way through 54.2 km, including a steep 220 metre canyon with walls 200 m high.
The Yumurí valley is claimed to be one of the island's most scenic, noted for the biodiversity of its flora and fauna, as well as a variety of archaeological sites. The valley, actually drained by the Yumuri and Bacunayagua rivers, is surrounded by a 150 m high mountain ridge. These elevations provide many vantage points to view the valley. One important site is the Monserrat Hermitage, known for its view of Matanzas. According local legend (in the Spanish Wikipedia entry), the valley's and river's name derives from the death cry (in Spanish) of a native princess.

Latécoère 300

The Latécoère 300 series of aircraft were a group of civil and military flying boats. They were manufactured by French aircraft manufacturer Latécoère in the 1930s. A single Latécoère 300 was built; it was flown for the first time in 1931 and sank the same year. It was rebuilt and flown again in 1932, being named "Croix du Sud" ("Southern Cross"). The 300 was a monoplane of parasol wing construction. It was powered by four engines, each of which produced 650 hp, arranged in two push-pull pairs. The 300 set an international aviation record for seaplanes on 31 December 1933, by flying non-stop between Berre Lake near Marseille and Saint-Louis, Senegal. The aircraft then entered service for Air France, transporting mail across the Atlantic Ocean from Dakar, Senegal to Natal, Brazil. 
It completed 23 missions before being lost at sea on December 7, 1936. The pilot was the famous French aviator Jean Mermoz.
The civilian Laté 301, and military Laté 302 were based on the 300, with some design improvements. A total of three aircraft of each type were built between 1935 and 1936. The first of the 301s was lost, the remaining two were used in South Atlantic service until 1939. In 1939 the last remaining 301 was converted to military service, joining the 302s in patrol duties in West Africa.
Original Laté 302 aircraft had 930-hp engines, bow, beam, and engine nacelle machine gun ports, and a bomb load of . The aircraft supported a crew of four and included sleeping accommodations. Fuel and payload were stored inside the hull. The 302s and converted 301 were in service at the start of World War II, and continued in military service, flying patrols from Dakar until retired due to lack of spare parts, the last aircraft being grounded at the end of 1941.

Gene Wiki

The Gene Wiki is a project that facilitates transferring information on human genes to Wikipedia article with the goal of promoting collaboration and expansion of the articles.
Project goals and scope.
Number of gene articles.
The human genome contains an estimated 20,000–25,000 protein-coding genes. The goal of the Gene Wiki project is to create seed articles for every human gene, that is, every gene whose function has been assigned in the peer-reviewed scientific literature. Approximately half of human genes have assigned function, therefore the total number of articles seeded by the Gene Wiki project would be expected to be in the range of 10,000 - 15,000. To date, approximately 10,271 articles have been created or augmented to include Gene Wiki project content.
Expansion.
Once seed articles have been established, the hope and expectation is that these will be annotated and expanded by editors ranging in experience from the lay audience to students to professionals and academics.
Proteins encoded by genes.
The majority of genes encode proteins hence understanding the function of a gene generally requires understanding of the function of the corresponding protein. In addition to including basic information about the gene, the project therefore also includes information about the protein encoded by the gene.
Gene Wiki generated content.
Stubs for the Gene Wiki project are created by a bot and contain links to the following primary gene/protein databases:

West African Youth League

The West African Youth League was a political organisation founded by I. T. A. Wallace-Johnson in June 1935. The group was a major political force against the colonial government in West Africa, especially in the Gold Coast and Sierra Leone. 
In 1938 the popularity of the League increased in Sierra Leone as Wallace-Johnson returned. The league contested and won the Freetown City Council elections in the same year. At the time Wallace-Johnson claimed that the organisation had a membership of 40 000. Following the Freetown election victory, the British authorities arrested Wallace-Johnson. The league went into disarray after Wallace-Johnson was sent to prison on Sherbro Island in 1939. After attempting to revive the organisation in 1944, Wallace-Johnson took it into the Pan-African Federation set up in Manchester, United Kingdom. He decided to merge it into the National Council of Sierra Leone in 1950.

Hercules Station &amp; Terminal

Hercules Amtrak Station and Ferry Terminal is a planned intermodal infill railway station and ferry terminal in Hercules, California in Western Contra Costa County. It is to be the first direct rail-to-ferry transit hub in the San Francisco Bay Area and will be constructed in between the existing Richmond and Martinez stations. Construction is currently scheduled to begin in 2016, with a planned completion date for the first phase of the project in 2018. 
Overview.
The station site at Hercules Point, adjacent to Bayfront Boulevard in Hercules, is the subject of a redevelopment effort of the city of Hercules as an office, residential TOD or Transit-oriented development, and intermodal transit hub with a corresponding WestCat bus station and Water Transit Authority ferry terminal. The buses would provide feeder service from the surrounding communities of Pinole, Rodeo, El Sobrante, Crockett, Tara Hills, and Richmond.
Rail.
The station will also host a future Amtrak station. The "Capitol Corridor" and some "San Joaquin" trains will stop at Hercules.
Ferry.
The ferry will take approximately 42 minutes to San Francisco. Ridership is projected at 1,022 passengers per day by the year 2025. The route will run between this terminal and the San Francisco Ferry Building where passengers may walk, bike or take Muni to nearby job centers in the city's downtown Financial District.
Transit village.
A bike and pedestrian friendly community will be built up around the hub to connect it to existing housing in the nearby Refugio and Central neighborhoods. It will feature 220 live/work dwellings in addition to 490,000 sq. ft. (45,522m²) of office, retail (including restaurants and cafes), and public space.
Funding.
The money for this project is being coordinated by partnerships and cooperation between the Capitol Corridor Joint Powers Authority, the City of Hercules, and WETA. Funds will be collected from various sources including the Federal Ferryboat Discretionary Fund, Contra Costa County Measure J Sales Tax, Transit Impact Fees, and Farebox Revenue.
Regional relevance.
In the early 2000s the region has experienced unprecedented expansion of public transit systems and this station/terminal will be part of this ongoing trend that has included an 8.7 mile (14.0 km) BART extension to San Francisco International Airport/Millbrae and a new infill station at West Dublin, a new Muni Metro line part of the partially constructed Third Street Light Rail Project, and the expansion of intermodality at the Oakland Airport/Coliseum BART station with an added infill Capitol Corridor station, a new a light rail system in Santa Clara County and the formation of a Water Transit Authority for the San Francisco Bay and it will continue with several Amtrak stations added for commuter service in Union City, Hercules, Benicia, Travis Air Force Base, and Dixon in addition to the already completed Oakland Coliseum/Airport station and ferry terminals in Redwood City, South San Francisco, Treasure Island, Martinez, Antioch, Richmond, and Berkeley.

Herbert H. Rowen

Herbert Harvey Rowen, (born 22 October 1916 in Brooklyn, New York - died 31 March 1999 in Newtown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania), was a noted American historian of Early Modern Europe and "arguably the most important English-speaking historian of the Dutch Republic since John Lothrop Motley."
Early life and education.
The son of Joseph M. Rowen, a teacher, and his wife, Sarah Gordon Rowen, Herbert Rowen was educated entirely in New York City, from his first year in grade school through his doctorate. He earned his [B.S.S.] degree in 1936 at City College of New York. In 1938, he became assistant to the manager of Converters Paper Company in Newark, New Jersey and, two years later, on 28 June 1940, he married Mildred Ringel (died January 1999), with whom he later had three children. Rowen remained with Converters Paper until 1942, when he joined the U.S. Army Signal Corps and spent three years in England and France. 
On his return to New York from military service in 1946, Rowen followed his growing interests in languages and took a position as an editorial research assistant with the "American College Dictionary" at Random House. On completing that job, he thought of going on to graduate work in French, but was advised by a former teacher to use his linguistic skills to study history. Following that advice, he entered Columbia University and completed his M.A. degree in history in 1948 with a thesis on "Annexation of the Congo by Belgium; a parliamentary study". finding this too controversial a subject to carry on to doctoral research, he shifted his area of study to Early Modern Europe and became the first of many graduate students of a new Columbia University faculty member, Garrett Mattingly. Under his tutelage, Rowen completed his doctoral dissertation on "Pomponne and De Witt (1669-1671); a study of French policy on the eve of the Dutch War" and was awarded his Ph.D. at Columbia in 1951.
Academic career.
While still a graduate student in 1950, Brandeis University appointed Rowen an instructor in history. He taught there until 1953, when the University of Iowa appointed him assistant professor. After four years there, Elmira College appointed him associate professor in 1957. While attached to Elmira College, Rowen served as visaiting associate Professor at the University of California, Berkeley in 1959-60, just before the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee appointed him a full professor in 1960. Rowen remained in Milwaukee until 1964, when Rutgers University appointed him professor of history. After having had this wide variety of teaching assignments, Rowen settled down at Rutgers for twenty-three years, remaining on the faculty there until his retirement in 1987.

Bryan Lerg

Bryan Lerg (born January 20, 1986) is an American professional ice hockey Forward who currently plays with the Lake Erie Monsters of the American Hockey League, whilst under contract with the Colorado Avalanche organization of the National Hockey League. Lerg played college hockey with Michigan State University where he helped the Spartans win a national championship in 2007.
Playing career.
Undrafted and much like his cousin Jeff, Lerg was of a small physique as a junior. A solid checker he played a strong, gritty game for his small stature. Opting to play collegiate hockey, in his freshman season with the Michigan State Spartans, Lerg accumulated 15 points (10 goals, 5 assists). By his Sophomore season, he had 38 points (15 goals, 23 assists) and in his junior season was given the honor of alternate captain and scored 36 points (23 goals, 13 assists), leading the Spartans to a national championship, in which he scored 8 game-winning goals to lead the NCAA. He was elected captain of the Spartans by team vote for the 2007-08 season and accumulated 39 points (20 goals, 19 assists) to be named the Spartans Offensive player of the year for a second time.
At the conclusion of his collegiate career, Lerg was signed to a two-year entry level contract with the Edmonton Oilers on April 1, 2008. He immediately made his professional debut at the end of the 2007–08 season with affiliate, the Springfield Falcons of the American Hockey League.
After attending his first Oilers training camp, Lerg was re-assigned to the Falcons to begin the 2008–09 season. Despite injury, Lerg scored 17 points in 42 games with the Falcons while also spending time in the ECHL with the Stockton Thunder. In the following season, Lerg suffered another injury and with a loss of form, struggled to cement his place within the Oilers farm team, scoring 7 points in 36 contests.
Unable to earn another contract with the Oilers, and with a lack of NHL interest, Lerg signed a try-out contract with Swiss team, Genève-Servette HC, of the Nationalliga A. Appearing in just a single game for Genève-Servette in the 2010–11 season, he returned to North America and the AHL, signing a one-year contract with the Wilkes-Barre Scranton Penguins on December 8, 2010. Lerg made an immediate contribution with the Penguins and posted 32 points in 65 games to earn a one-year contract extension on July 13, 2011.
Prior to the 2011–12 season with Wilkes-Barre, Lerg was invited and attended the Pittsburgh Penguins training camp. After he was returned to their affiliate, Lerg produced a team leading and career high 27 goals to finish second on the team with 53 points.
On July 1, 2012, Lerg was signed as a free agent to a one-year, two-way contract with the Colorado Avalanche. With the 2012 NHL lockout in affect, Lerg was directly assigned to American League affiliate, the Lake Erie Monsters, to start the 2012–13 campaign. Shortly after the resumption of the season, he was announced as team captain on October 30, 2012. In the midst of a productive campaign with the Monsters in scoring 9 goals in 28 games, Lerg's season was cut short after he suffered a season-ending torn Anterior cruciate ligament injury which required surgery.
On April 22, 2013, Lerg agreed to a one-year contract extension with the Colorado Avalanche.
Personal information.
He is the cousin of former teammate Jeff Lerg.

Johan Blanch (, ; modern Catalan spelling: "Joan Blanc") was an Occitan troubadour who composed a "canso" for a "joc floral" at the Consistori del Gay Saber. According to the rubric of the fourteenth-century chansonnier that preserves it, he was a Catalan whose poem "won the violet" ("gazaynet la violeta"), top prize. His "canso" is elegant and pleading. 
His dates are entirely unknown, as is the year he won the violet, though Jaume Massó i Torrents hypothesised 1360.

Utricularia steenisii

Utricularia steenisii is a small annual carnivorous plant that belongs to the genus "Utricularia". It is endemic to Sumatra and is only known from higher elevations in Aceh. "U. steenisii" grows as a lithophyte or terrestrial plant among mosses in exposed or shady soils or on rocks at altitudes from to . It was first collected in 1937 by Cornelis Gijsbert Gerrit Jan van Steenis, for whom the species is named. Peter Taylor misidentified a specimen of "U. steenisii" as "U. salwinensis" in 1977, but upon viewing further specimens, he realized the nature of this new species and formally described it in 1986.

Viking (rocket engine)

The Viking rocket engines were members of a series of bipropellant engines for the first and second stages of the Ariane 1 through Ariane 4 commercial launch vehicles, using storable, hypergolic propellants, N2O4/UH 25 (mixture 75% UDMH and 25% Hydrazine.)
The earliest versions, developed in 1973, had a thrust of about 390 kN.
The version used on the Ariane 4 first stage, which clustered four together, had 667 kN thrust each. The second stage of Ariane used a single Viking.
Over 1000 were built, and achieved a high level of reliability from early in the program.
The 144 Ariane 1 to 4 used a total of 958 Viking engines. Only 2 engines have led to a failure. The first failure was due to a crack in the combustion chamber, the second is of human origin: a rag had been left in a pipe during installation. Initially, all the engines were tested before being integrated on a launcher. Beginning in 1998, engineers, confident of the reliability of the engine, authorized the use of untested engines on launchers. Some engines, randomly taken in the workshops of assembly, were tested from time to time. This confidence is very rare in the world of space engines.

Awithlaknakwe

Awithlaknakwe (or Stone Warriors, or Game of the Stone Warriors) is a strategy board game from the Zuni Native American Indians of the American Southwest. The gameboard comprises 168 squares. Two or four may play, with players identified as North, West, South, and East. 
The game was described by Stewart Culin in his book "Games of the North American Indians" (1907). 
Equipment.
The gameboard is a 12×12 square grid with six extra squares centered on each of the four sides, totaling 168 squares. Diagonal lines run through each square (the diagonal lines are called "trails"; the orthogonal lines are called "canyons"). Each player has six "warriors", and a seventh man named "Priest of the Bow". 
The historical board was cut into stone slabs, and pieces were small discs of pottery with tops either plain or having a hole in their centers to differentiate ownership. The Priest of the Bow was distinguished from friendly men by being somewhat larger.
Rules.
Each player starts the game with his six warriors on the six squares nearest to him (or "home rank"). The goal is to bring one's men to the opponent's home rank, while capturing as many enemy pieces as possible. However, the winning conditions of this ancient game are not completely defined (see "Incomplete rules" section below).
Two players.
Players sit at opposite sides of the board; North plays against South.
Four players.
North and West are partners against South and East. Each team has one Priest of the Bow (not two).
Incomplete rules.
The rules described by F. H. Cushing and reported by Culin, and subsequently by Bell and Murray, lack specificity on some points:

Rail transport in Bolivia

The Bolivian rail network has had a peculiar development throughout its history; owing to losses of land, prestige and credit rating due to the failure of the War of the Pacific, railway development came late to Bolivia. The demand for mineral wealth and communication to the inland city of La Paz, encouraged foreign investors, mainly British, to construct railways. However, into this mix came the experience of railway building in adjacent Peru, whereby overbuilding of standard gauge line across the high Andes meant that Peru went bankrupt.
Overview.
Lines were built to furnish the nitrate deposits at Arica, and later at Antofagasta. The rapidly expanding tin and silver mining in Bolivia meant that railway building projects were given a big impetus from the 1920s. Many of the lines remained unfinished until the 1950s. Bolivia had a mixture of lines and gauges, (standard) and (meter gauge) were the norm; as were British-built engines.
The railway lines radiated out from the mines to the coast, and did not reflect the population centres and their need to move. Consequently, it was in the mid-century that lines were built across the high plain to Argentina and into the jungle of eastern Bolivia. The disconnected nature of travel due to the Andes, Lake Titicaca, gauge change, frontiers, and lasting resentment with the neighbours over territory loss, meant that railways in Bolivia were incomplete. Most railways in Argentina are gauge and thus problematic with neighbouring Bolivia. A line was made connecting the two across the Gran Chaco.
Gauges.
All railways in Bolivia are now Metre gauge. The Antofagasta to Uyuni line was originally Two foot six inch gauge railways gauge.
FCAB Line from Antofagasta.
The Ferrocarril de Antofagasta a Bolivia started at the Chilean port of Antofagasta. It proceeded up the front range of the Andes to Ollagüe on the Bolivian border, then across the Bolivian pampas to Uyuni and Oruro. At Oruro the gauge changed to metre gauge for the remainder of the route to La Paz, the capital of Bolivia. A number of branches were added to reach various mining fields. The Collahuasi branch reached 4815 metres (15,795 ft) above sea level, regarded at the time of construction as the highest railway in the world. The total length of gauge lines, including branches and subsidiaries, was .
The history of the railway dates back to 1872 with the grant of a concession by the government of Bolivia to Melbourne Clarke & Co, the territory around Antofagasta being part of Bolivia at this date. The railway was organised as the Antofagasta Nitrate & Railway Company. Construction started in 1873, with the first section opening late in that year, motive power provided by mules. Steam locomotives were introduced in 1876, and by 1879 the railway had extended about 150 km into the interior. War broke out in 1879 between Chile on one side, and Peru and Bolivia on the other. One of the causes of the war was an attempt by the Bolivian government to levy back taxes on the railway. The "War of the Pacific" ended in 1883, and Chile gained the region around Antofagasta as well as part of Peru.
Control of the railway passed to the Company Huanchilaca de Bolivia in 1887, who subsequently floated the railway on the London stock exchange in 1888 as the FCAB. The Huanchilaca company retained the right to operate the railway for a further 15 years. The line reached Oruro in Bolivia, the end of the section, in 1892, and branches continued to be added over subsequent years.
British business interests resumed control of the entire system in 1903. Traffic reached a point where the port of Antofagasta was unable to cope. A new port was opened to the north at Mejillones in 1906. The entire region is a desert, with almost no rainfall. The company constructed a system of pipes and reservoirs to bring water for the railway from the high Andes, eventually becoming responsible for supplying Antofagasta with water as well.
Bolivian government interests supported the construction of a railway between Oruro and the Bolivian capital, La Paz, and this line was opened in stages between 1908 and 1913 This line was constructed to metre gauge, and was leased to the FCAB. The FCAB now had two operating divisions, one using gauge, the other metre gauge. The Chilean gauge track was regauged to one meter in 1926.
Rail link to Peru.
Bolivia built a line to the shores of Lake Titicaca, where travellers could take a steamer, the Inca, across to the rails of Peru. A ferry connects the gauge railway of Peru at Puno with the gauge railway of Bolivia at Guaqui. See also Peru train ferry.
Lines in the south, east.
The first lines in the country were built over the Andes, and then in a north south line down the altiplano from La Paz to Villazon on the Argentine border.
Another line ran from Yacuiba in the SE, again from Argentina, and ran in a northern direction paralleling the first line. Based on a contract with Argentina of 1925, Bolivia achieved an extension to Villazon, connecting with the meter-gauge Central Norte to Buenos Aires. That FC Atocha-Villazon got in 1929 2-8-2s from Borsig and in 1942 2-10-2s from Baldwin.
A line from Brazil enters Bolivia at Puerto Suarzez and connects to this line at Santa Cruz. The line runs to Trinidad in the north center of the country. Spur lines were run to mining districtss and the regional capital of Cochobamba. In the 1950s the last major rail system from Santa Cruz to São Paulo, Brazil, was completed
I am informed 2012 that no railway line ever ran from Santa Cruz de la Sierra to Trinidad in the north by an 80 year old resident in Trinidad and a 46 year old former resident of Trinidad.
Mamore and Madeira Railway.
Another odd railway was a local line in the Amazonian jungle. The Madeira-Mamoré Railroad runs in a loop around the unnavigable section to Guajará-Mirim on the Mamoré River.
Although the idea of river navigation was complicated, in 1869, the North American engineer George Earl Church obtained from the Bolivian government a concession to create and explore a navigation enterprise that linked the Mamoré and Madeira Rivers. However, shortly afterwards, he realized the real difficulty of this undertaking, and the plans were definitively changed to the construction of a railroad. Negotiations advanced and, by 1870, Church received permission from the Brazilian government to build a railroad along the rubber trees of the Madeira River.
However, the increase in uncontrolled extraction of rubber was on the road to provoking an international conflict. The Brazilian workers advanced further and further into the forests in the territory of Bolivia in search of new rubber trees to extract the precious latex, creating conflicts and skirmishes on the frontier towards the end of the 19th century, which required the presence of the army, led by José Plácido de Castro. The recently-proclaimed Brazilian republic drew considerable profit from the wealth of the rubber trade, but the "Acre question" (as the border conflicts caused by rubber extraction became known) preoccupied it.
It was then that a providential and intelligent intervention by the diplomat Barão do Rio Branco and the ambassador Joaquim Francisco de Assis Brasil, in part financed by the "rubber barons", culminated in the signing of the Treaty of Petropolis, signed November 17, 1903 during the government of president Francisco de Paula Rodrigues Alves. This treaty halted the conflict with Bolivia, guaranteeing effective control of the forests of Acre by Brazil.
The treaty, drafted by the Brazilian minister Barão do Rio Branco, gave Brazil the territory of Acre (191,000 km²), in exchange for over 3,000 km² of Brazilian territory between the Abunâ and Madeira rivers, a monetary payment of two million British pounds, paid in two installments, and a pledge of a rail-link between the Bolivian city of Riberalta and the Brazilian city of Porto Velho, which would bypass the rapids on the Madeira.
The rail line was called the Madeira-Mamoré Railway. It was supposed to go as far as Riberalta, on the Rio Beni, above that river's rapids, but had to stop short at Guajará-Mirim. This was actually the third such attempt. In the 1870s, during the rubber boom, the American George Church was defeated twice by the heat, the difficulty of the terrain and appalling loss of life from fever. The contract for the Madeira-Mamoré railway required by the treaty was won by another American, Percival Farquhar. Construction began in August 1907 and was completed on July 15, 1912. The project cost US$33 million. At least 3,600 men died building the 367 km of track Guajaramirin-Station (popular estimates say that each one hundred sleepers cost one human life). The Madeira-Mamoré railway had about a year of full operation before the combination of the collapse of rubber prices, the opening of a railway from Bolivia to the Pacific via Chile and of the Panama Canal rendered it uneconomic. It was kept going until 1972.
Steel lines to the Silver at Potosi.
Rio Mulatos-Potosí line is a train line in Bolivia, containing Cóndor station, the world's second highest railway station (4,786 m).
Abt Racks in the Andes.
Another strange line is the Arica line, built to move tin ore and, because of the grades across the Andes, it used the Abt rack railway system for several kilometers. This increased expense and mechanical difficulty on the engines and caused problems.
Ascending to the Altiplano.
Problems continued at La Paz as it sits in a deep mountain valley. Steam engines found it difficult to make the grade and thus the first to El Alto were electrified early on to give engines enough power.
Maturity and decline.
A revolution in 1953 led by the miners changed government to the left. One thing the new regime did was nationalize the railways. From this the Empressa Ferrocarril Nacional de Bolivia (ENFE) emerged. However, twenty years later, the advent of the Banzer regime in the 1970s starved the railways of cash, failing them just as they were coming into maturity. In the 1970s development aid came to Bolivia, due to Cold War geopolitics from America, and so highways and the military were built up and the railways were neglected. Senac, the Bolivian road agency, was established in 1964 when there were only 3,000 kilometers of roads, and it supervised road construction and maintenance; now there are 42000 km. In the 1980s with the rise in interest rates, debtor nations like Bolivia entered the Latin American debt crisis and began to retrench financing for public works and operations, like railways.
By the late 1980s, Bolivia possessed an extensive but aging rail system that operated over 3,700 kilometers of rail and carried over 535 million tons of freight and 2.4 million passengers a year. The National Railroad Enterprise (Empresa Nacional de Ferrocarriles—Enfe) operated the dilapidated system, which had been subject to World Bank rehabilitation schemes since 1970. Government policies emphasized the continued upgrading of the railroad and plans to join the Atlantic and Pacific coasts by rail. In 1988 the Argentine Railroad Company (Ferrocarriles Argentinos) began work on the Expreso del Sud rail line, which would connect Buenos Aires with La Paz and eventually Matarani, Peru, to form the Liberators of America Corridor (""), the first Atlantic-Pacific railroad in South America. The Bolivian government also contemplated another transoceanic railroad linking Santa Cruz to Cochabamba, thus integrating its Andean and lowland railroads. Presently, passenger trains are very slow in Bolivia and have lost favour to highway buses, called flotas. Mining concentrates still travel by long freight trains. Some of the lines have been sold to American interests.
In the age of cellphones and satellites, basic Bolivian infrastructure has deteriorated, especially the fine railway system in western and central Bolivia whose construction started in 1877. In 1976 diesel engines replaced steam locomotives.
The single track railroad, most of it narrow gauge, has 2 unconnected systems. The Western Network, built much earlier, connects La Paz with Cochabamba and the Chilean ports of Arica and Antofagasta. It also connects with Argentina. In bygone days a railroad journey from La Paz to Buenos Aires was popular and comfortable. The Eastern Network connects the city of Santa Cruz to São Paulo, Brazil. Another line goes from Santa Cruz to Argentina. Many attempts to connect the 2 systems with a link from Cochabamba to Santa Cruz have never succeeded. The same is true of the so-called "inter-oceanic corridor" that would go from the Brazilian Atlantic coast to the Chilean Pacific coast, passing through Bolivia. Currently most Bolivian railroads are in disrepair. In 1964 there were 103 locomotives, but only 34 in 1995. The Bolivian railway system was a state corporation known as ENFE. In 1991, a Japanese study estimated that upgrading the railway system would require US$46 billion over 30 years. Hopes to privatize and capitalize the system were only partially accomplished when in 1995 the Chilean consortium, Cruz Blanca, acquired 50 percent of ENFE. Bolivia sold a majority share in ENFE to the Chilean company Cruz Blanca in 1996, which discontinued most passenger routes — including lines to La Paz — in favor of freight service. Cruz Blanca later sold the western portion of the railway to the Chilean company Luksic Group, and in 2000 sold the eastern portion to the U.S. company Genesee & Wyoming Inc. The ENFE sale was part of a sweeping privatization initiative in the mid-1990s, when at the urging of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund Bolivia sold its government interests in the oil and gas, water, power, railroad and telecommunications sectors, as well as the national airline and pension plan.
By 1999, Bolivia again had 55 operating locomotives with around 2,000 railway cars. The passenger load was 750,000 in 1992 and is still below 1 million per year. Freight also has declined sharply.
Future plans.
The government of Evo Morales has proposed a rail line uniting La Paz, Cochabamba, and Santa Cruz, connecting onwards to Brazil and the Pacific coast.
The department of Cochabamba and the national government are contracting design studies in 2011 for regional trains to run on two routes: Cochabamba-Caluyo-Tarata-Cliza-Punata-Arani and Sipe Sipe-Vinto-Cochabamba-Sacaba-Chiñata. A 180-day study on Sipe Sipe-Chiñata line is being carried out between August 2011 and Februar 2012.
Incidents.
In 2007 thieves had stolen 100 meters of Bolivian track overnight, and the morning freight had insufficient distance to stop.
Photo of the site shows locomotives 1021 and 951 remained upright, but extensive damage ensued.
Locomotives.
Bolivia used engines from a variety of builders: Borsig to Baldwin; Henschel to Hitachi; North British and Vulcan.

Lobular carcinoma in situ

Lobular carcinoma "in situ" (LCIS) is a condition caused by unusual cells in the lobules of the breast.
It is usually not considered cancer, but it can indicate an increased risk of future cancer. Unlike ductal carcinoma "in situ" (DCIS), LCIS is not associated with calcification, and is typically an incidental finding in a biopsy performed for another reason. LCIS only accounts for about 15% of the "in situ" (ductal or lobular) breast cancers.
Genetics.
Cells of LCIS and invasive lobular carcinoma have the same histology, appearing as single detached cells, as both have loss of expression of e-cadherin, the transmembrane protein mediating epithelial cell adhesion. LCIS often have the same genetic alterations (such as loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 16q, the locus for the e-cadherin gene) as the adjacent area of invasive carcinoma.
Morphology.
Like the cells of atypical lobular hyperplasia and invasive lobular carcinoma, the abnormal cells of LCIS consist of small cells with oval or round nuclei and small nucleoli detached from each other. Mucin-containing signet-ring cells are commonly seen. LCIS generally leaves the underlying architecture intact and recognisable as lobules. Estrogen and progesterone receptors are present and HER2/neu overexpression is absent in most cases of LCIS.
Treatment options.
LCIS may be treated with close clinical follow-up and mammographic screening, tamoxifen or related hormone controlling drugs to reduce the risk of developing cancer, or bilateral prophylactic mastectomy. Some surgeons consider bilateral prophylactic mastectomy to be overly aggressive treatment except for certain high-risk cases.
Prognosis.
LCIS (lobular neoplasia is considered pre-cancerous) is an indicator (marker) identifying women with an increased risk of developing invasive breast cancer. This risk extends more than 20 years. Most of the risk relates to subsequent invasive ductal carcinoma rather than to invasive lobular carcinoma.
While older studies have shown that the increased risk is equal for both breasts, a more recent study suggests that the ipsilateral (same side) breast may be at greater risk.

B &amp; O Railroad Potomac River Crossing

The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Crossings at the Potomac River are a set of railroad bridges that span the Potomac River between Maryland Heights, Maryland and Harpers Ferry, West Virginia in the United States.
Description and history.
Two bridges comprise the current crossing. The more recent bridge is a deck plate girder bridge dating to 1930-31 which curves across the river, carrying the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O) main line to Martinsburg, West Virginia. The older bridge is a steel Pratt truss and plate girder bridge dating to 1894, carrying the B&O Valley line toward Winchester, Virginia along the Shenandoah River. A tunnel was built at the same time as the 1894 bridge to carry the tracks through Maryland Heights and to eliminate a sharp curve. The western end of the tunnel was widened in conjunction with the construction of the second bridge to allow the broadest possible curve across the river.
Just downstream of the 1894 bridge, almost at the confluence of the Potomac and Shenandoah Rivers, are the ruins of two previous bridges on the same alignment. The newer of the bridges was a Bollman truss bridge that carried rail and highway traffic from 1870 until 1936, when it was swept away by a flood. The Valley line section of the "Y"-shaped bridge dated to 1851, and was one of the earliest Bollman trusses in existence. The remainder of the bridge was destroyed in the Civil War, to be replaced by temporary structures.
The B&O's first bridge over the Potomac was an covered wood truss, comprising six river spans plus a span over the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. The single-track bridge was designed by Benjamin Henry Latrobe, II and opened in 1837. Latrobe designed a "Y" span for the route to Winchester, which was added to the bridge in 1839. An earlier road bridge, a timber covered bridge, had been built c. 1824, replacing Harper's Ferry, which had operated since 1747.

Izzy Sher

Emil "Izzy" Sher (1912–1999) was a Jewish American sculptor who lived in Berkeley, California.
Childhood.
Sher was born in 1912 or 1913 in Odessa, Russia. His father died when he was 6 and he and his younger sister were placed for a time in an orphanage. After the revolution of 1917, it became difficult to leave the Soviet Union, but Sher’s mother convinced the authorities that the family was not Russian but Polish, and the Shers were allowed to leave in 1926.
Assisted by relatives in the United States the Shers travelled first to Mexico, where they lived for a year and a half. Finally in 1928, they were admitted to the United States under the Mexican quota and a year later, via Cuba and Key West, Florida, they joined family members in Chicago.
World War II.
During the 1930s, Mr. Sher worked at industrial jobs and changed his name from Yitzak to Emil. Friends and family continued to call him Izzy. He became a citizen of the United States in 1941 after a stint as a merchant seaman and was inducted in the army 1942.
As a radio operator in the 1st Infantry division he fought in Tunisia, Sicily, Normandy, Northern France, the Ardennes, the Rhineland, and Central Europe. He was shot three times and received the Silver Star and Purple Heart with two Oak Leaf clusters.
Sculptures.
After the war he moved to New York where he met Edith Marie Thompson, a Chicagoan. Together they moved to Los Angeles and then to Big Sur. They were married in Monterey in 1952 and settled in Berkeley where he studied Philosophy at the University of California.
Until his death in 1999 Sher kept a studio at his house on Virginia Street which he called "The Wire Shop." His backyard was a continually growing menagerie of metal sculpture, "a kind of 
overwhelming garden of junked-up, rusting dreams." This aspect of his production can productively be looked at in the context of other American non-traditional vernacular architecture, such as the Watts Towers in Los Angeles.
Jewish identity.
In addition to his garden, Sher also produced a great number of menorahs which adorn a great many gardens and synagogues in the Bay Area, including the Judah L. Magnus Museum and Congregation Beth Israel, where he attended services.
Sher attended Congregation Beth Israel (Berkeley, California) where he recited the Mourner's Kaddish daily for the victims of the Holocaust. Many of his sculptures deal with Jewish themes and motifs.

Sullivan eventually made his debut with his brother as the Freedom Ryders facing his future tag team partner Emory Hale and another wrestler in Bradenton, Florida. The match lasted up to 20 minutes.
He continued using the Freedom Ryder gimmick during his early career and eventually made his debut in IPW Hardcore for promoter Ron Niemi.

When the title was vacant in November 2000, he lost to Buck Quartermain in a four-way match with Pepe Prado and Scoot Andrews on January 23, 2001. Three months later, he and Buck Quartermain lost their titles to Scoot Andrews who became a triple crown winner with the IPW, FOW and NWA Florida Heavyweight Championships.

During an interpromotional event between IPW Hardcore and NWA Florida held at the Homer W. Hesterly Armory on April 24, 2001, he and Andrews defeated NWA Florida's Pepe Prado and Billy Fives. After the match, they turned ""heel"" upset at the fans who were cheering for the Strong Brothers while they were ""babyfaces"".
Forming Naturally Marvelous, they joined Buck Quartermain and Pepi Prado in the Tampa Clique which would dominate the promotion during the next year. The two eventually defeated the Strong Brothers for the titles in a steel cage match at the supercard "Extreme Intentions" on September 20, 2002. The following month at "No More Games", he and Andrews defeated The Shane Twins (Mike and Todd Shane) to unify the IPW and NWA Florida Tag Team Championship on October 11, 2002. He and Andrews were scheduled to meet the Shane Twins at "Valentine's Massacre" on February 8, 2003. Sullivan was unable to compete due to a family emergency, however, and he was replaced by referee turned wrestler Mikey Tenderfoot and lost the unified titles to the Shane Twins.
He and Andrews became founding members of the Alliance of Defiance with Billy Fives, Rod Steel and later Sullivan's valet Jenni Lee. Defeated Rod Steel to become the number one contender for the NWA Southern Heavyweight Championship, he also won a five-way match between Sedrick Strong, David Babylon, Lex Lovett and Danny Doring on February 28, 2004.

P. Rajagopalachari

Diwan Bahadur Sir Perungavur Rajagopalachari, () KCSI, CIE (18 March 1862 – 1 December 1927), also spelt in contemporary records as Sir P. Rajagopala Achariyar, was an Indian administrator. He was the Diwan (chief minister) of Cochin State from December 1896 to August 1901 and of Travancore from 1906 to 1914.
Early life and career.
Rajagopalachari was born in Madras and educated at Presidency College and Madras Law College. He joined the Judicial Department Indian Civil Service on 3 May 1886 and was appointed deputy collector in December 1887. From 2 May 1890 to December 1896, he served as assistant collector and magistrate in Madras Province.
Diwan of Cochin.
In December 1896, Rajagopalachari was appointed Diwan by Maharaja Rama Varma of Cochin. He served in his capacity from 1896 to 1901. During his tenure as diwan, the Cochin Native Merchants Association was founded. This later became the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry - Cochin. In 1901, the Central Records of the Cochin State were established at Tripunithura. This later evolved into the Kerala State Archives Department.
Diwan of Travancore.
In 1901, he was appointed Registrar of Co-operative Credit Societies in the Madras Presidency and then served as Assistant Collector from March 1902 until 1906, when he was appointed Diwan of Travancore state.
The Sadhu Jana Paripalana Sangham was established in 1907 by social reformer Ayyankali to campaign for education for Dalits. Rajagopalachari was supportive of the movement, and in 1907 the government of Travancore passed an order for the admission of Dalit children in schools. However, the upper-caste landlords who owned most of the schools were obstinate in allowing Dalit children into their schools and openly defied the government order. A major strike erupted. Low caste agragrian workers refused to farm their fields. In 1910, Rajagopalachari and Mitchell, who headed the education department, made the order for admission of Dalit children public, thereby putting an end to the controversy.
Rajagopalachari also brought forth reforms in the administration. Dalits, who were previously excluded from the administration, were made eligible for nomination to the State Assembly. Ayyankali became the first Dalit member to be nominated to the Travancore State Assembly. Rajagopalachari also donated 8acres of land for the construction of an Islamic college by Sheikh Mohammad Hamadani Thangal. 
Rajagopalachari's administration had its own share of controversies. M. A. Shakoor, in his biography of Vakkom Moulavi, calls Rajagopalachari's administration "authoritarian".
Later life and career.
In 1914, Rajagopalachari returned to Madras as Secretary of the Judicial Department, the first Indian to hold the post. 
In 1917, he was appointed to the Council of the Governor of Madras. When the Madras Legislative Council came into being, as per the provisions of the Government of India Act 1919, on 17 December 1920, Rajagopalachari was elected as the first President. It is believed that he was instrumental in formulating the no-confidence motion against the Justice Party Government of the Raja of Panagal. His tenure came to an end in 1923 and he was succeeded by L. D. Samikannu Pillai. In 1923, he was appointed to the Council of India in London, resigning in 1925 due to ill-health and returning to India.
Honours.
Rajagopalachari was appointed Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) in 1909 and Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India (KCSI) in the 1920 New Year Honours.
Legacy.
A bust of Rajagopalachari is present in the hall of the Madras Legislative Council.
Family.
Rajagopalachari had a brother P.Narasimhachari who was a Justice in High Court - Rangoon, Burma (Myanmar). He also had notable grand nephews (his sister's grandchildren) - C.T.Rajagopal, C.T.Venugopal and C.T.Krishnama Chari

MMT began in 1964 as a Summer Stock Theatre at Rockledge Inn atop Mill Mountain. When a fire destroyed the inn in 1976, the company, formed from New York actors, performed at the Grandin Theatre, an old neighborhood movie theatre, until 1983. In that Year, MMT moved into Center in the Square (CITS), the multi-organizational cultural and educational complex.
In January 2009, Mill Mountain Theater’s Board of Directors responsibly faced mounted debt by ceasing productions to focus on reorganizing the Theater’s business operations. All staff members, with the exception of the director of education were laid off. At the same time MMT's landord, Center in the Square, undertook a complete reonvation, moving MMT into temporary space.
During the reinvention process, educational classes continued and enrollement doubled becoming one of the theatre's best sources of income during the reinvention process. Mill Mountain Theatre Conservatory (MMTC) produced a holiday show each year during the reorganization; "Annie, Jr." in 2009, Disney's "My Son Pinocchio, Geppetto's Musical Tale" in December 2010, "The Best Christmas Pageant Ever" in 2011 and 2012. All holiday performances had sold out shows and in 2011 all shows sold out before opening night.
Mill Mountain Theatre is now back in full production. In March 2012, MMT produced "Greater Tuna" on the Waldron Blackbox Stage, its first professional Equity performance since 2009. On April 24, 2013, Mill Mountain Theatre returned to the Trinkle Main Stage in the newly renovated Center in the Square presenting "The Marvelous Wonderettes", marking the beginning of a new era.
Through partnerships with Hollins University and others, MMT is presenting other venues such as "No Shame Theatre”, “Overnight Sensations” and “Big Lick Conspiracy.” In addition MMT has collaborated with other organizations for such as events as “Radical Reels” film series, “Race Across the Sky” film, corporate meetings, “Miss Roanoke Valley”, “Addy’s”, etc.
Mill Mountain Theatre has developed a financially sustainable business model that is innovative, pragmatic, and emphasizes regional and organizational collaboration. The new model acknowledges the organization’s historical importance to the region’s identity and tourism initiatives, while being sensitive to today’s economic realities. The reemerging MMT will be a key cultrual asset for the Roanoke Valley continuing with its history of providing professional theatre and conservatory education to the Roanoke Region.
Mill Mountain Theatre is located at the Center in the Square facility on the Market Square in downtown Roanoke, Virginia, in the United States of America. The theater is named after the nearby Mill Mountain, which is a popular theme for the naming of Roanoke landmarks and organizations, including the Mill Mountain Star, Mill Mountain Zoo, and Mill Mountain Coffee and Tea.

Sugarite Canyon State Park

Sugarite Canyon State Park is a state park of New Mexico, United States, featuring a historic early-20th Century coal-mining camp and natural scenery at the border of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Plains. The park is located on the Colorado–New Mexico state line northeast of Raton, New Mexico.
Setting.
Sugarite Canyon is located east of Raton Pass in a sparsely-populated region of lofty, steep-sided, flat-topped mesas; cone-shaped volcanoes; and old lava flows. Sugarite Canyon State Park, in size, consists of a stream valley flanked by basalt cliffs with Bartlett and Little Horse Mesas to the west and Horse Mesa on the east. Altitudes in the park are from at the park entrance to on top of Little Horse Mesa. The park is about long and wide.
Most of the park is heavily forested with Ponderosa Pine and Gambel Oak forests. Along Sugarite Creek at lower elevations is a riparian forest of willow and cottonwood. Douglas fir, White Fir, and Aspen forests are found at higher elevations on north facing slopes. The flat top of Little Horse Mesa is a grassy meadow. Wildlife species in the park include mule deer, black bear, mountain lion, turkeys, and elk. The two artificial lakes in the park, Lake Maloya (120 acres) and Lake Alice (3 acres), and Sugarite Creek, are stocked with Rainbow, Cutthroat, and Brown Trout. Abundant butterflies, wildflowers, and views down the Sugarite Valley to the Great Plains far below are highlights of the park.

Most summer rain comes in afternoon thunderstorms and most winter precipitation is in the form of snow, which can be heavy, especially at higher elevations. Droughts are not uncommon in the summer.
History.
The name Sugarite derives from either the Comanche and Ute name for a bird found in the Canyon or the Spanish name, Chicarica, for chicory, a plant found here. Sugarite Canyon was used as a water supply for Raton as early as 1891. The lakes continue to be used for that purpose. Coal mining in the canyon began in 1894 and the town of Sugarite was established as a coal-mining town in 1912. Sugarite had a population of nearly one thousand at its peak. The mines began to shut down in 1941 and in 1944 the post office and railroad were shut down. Sugarite Canyon State Park was established in 1985 and now receives about 125,000 visitors per years. The park's land is owned by the city of Raton and leased to the State of New Mexico for 99 years.
Activities.
Visitor Center and ruins of Sugarite. A visitor center is near the park entrance station and an interpretive trail follows and crosses Sugarite Creek through the ruins of the once thriving town and coal mine. An admission fee of $5 per vehicle is charged to enter the park.
Fishing and boating. Lakes Maloya and Alice are popular for trout fishing. Sailboats and boats powered with electric motors are permitted on Lake Maloya. A boat dock permits easy launching.

Little Horse Mesa Trail, a round trip, climbs steeply to the highest point in the park on Little Horse Mesa. The Mesa top is flat and nearly treeless and has excellent views. Horse stables are located near Soda Pocket Campground.

Doctor at Large (TV series)

Doctor at Large is a British television comedy series based on a set of books by Richard Gordon about the misadventures of a group of newly qualified doctors. The series follows directly from its predecessor "Doctor in the House", and was produced by London Weekend Television in 1971.
Writers for the "Doctor at Large" episodes were Bill Oddie, Graeme Garden, John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Bernard McKenna, Geoff Rowley, Andy Baker, Jonathan Lynn and David Yallop, as well as George Layton (under the pseudonym of "Oliver Fry").
Plot.
The plot revolves around newly qualified Doctor Michael Upton as he tries to make a start in his profession. He obtains a series of jobs, including working in otolaryngology and as a general practitioner, before returning to St Swithin's Hospital (where he received his training) as a Junior Registrar. Notable events also include Upton's (and other young doctors) pursuit of women.
Episode list.
Airdates given here are for London Weekend Television. 
Michael Upton, having qualified as a doctor, has an interview for a house officer post at All Saints Hospital, where they seem mainly interested in his prowess as a rugby wing three-quarter – apart from the cross-dressing consultant chairing the interviews. He ends up back at St Swithin’s in ENT outpatients, dealing disastrously with a nosebleed, and a man’s imaginary diseases (John Sharp).
Dr Upton finds a job at the GP practice of a Scottish Dr Nielson (James Hayter), and learns all about coloured medicines. Mike has to help Paul Collier ‘fake’ a test for alcohol, while later evading the advances of the randy receptionist (Patsy Rowlands).
The first of a sequence of five episodes with Arthur Lowe as Dr Maxwell (the ‘major’), and Madeline Smith as his daughter Su, set in a rough area of London. Upton's and Collier’s car has its wheels stolen while they are being interviewed. All the patients think Upton is too young, so Maxwell has to find a way of getting them to accept treatment from him.
Dr Upton is asked by Dr Maxwell to give sex education classes at the local all-girls school and becomes over-popular with the teenage pupils. With Barbara Mitchell as a teacher.
The young doctors obtain an ECG machine to modernise practice at Dr Maxwell’s, although its use on patient Mrs Baxter (Marjorie Rhodes) is not a great success.
Paul Collier has an idea for a new pregnancy service involving toads and tadpoles. Local medical colleague Dr McKendrick (Fulton Mackay) comes to speak to Dr Maxwell about the unconventional methods; if the GMC find out they could all be struck off.
Upton is fancied by Su but gets off with a doctor friend of Dr Stuart Clark, Caroline Cooke (Amanda Reiss) – resulting in a row, illustrated by a comic strip (by Pat Gavin). The major suspects Mike of improper conduct.
Going home to his parents between jobs, Upton carries out a consultation on a train with a woman with varicose veins (Jean Kent), who turns out to be his father’s patient.
Paul and Michael are fighting over junior jobs in the hospital while Bingham is keeping the most interesting cases for himself.
Stuart Clark gets Upton to try for a job at a posh private practice in Harley Street. Problems start when Collier borrows Upton’s suit and Mike finds out his duties include walking Dr Whiteland’s (Fabia Drake) poodles. Ivor Dean appears as Dr Whiteland's butler.
Left to mind the practice Dr Upton has to deal with a government minister (Basil Henson), a hysterical (and he thinks, suicidal) girl (Maureen Lipman) jilted by Dick Stuart Clark, and three toy bears. (Also with Damaris Hayman.)
Dr Upton is suspected in a case of sudden death of Mr Medwin (Arthur Hewlett) whose vicious family (Sylvia Coleridge, Jack May) are after the money. (With Norah Blaney, Jeffrey Segal and John Nettleton).
Upton and Bingham are vying for a surgical house job with a consultant (Frank Middlemass) but celebrations for St Swithin’s winning the hospitals rugby cup and an escapade with a mini cause complications.
While starting a new job in general practice for Dr Griffin (Brian Oulton) – a hypochondriac relation of Dr Paul Collier, Michael has to stay at a suburban hotel run by a Mr Clifford (Timothy Bateson) and his domineering wife, whose guests include the resident joker (Roy Kinnear) and three old ladies (Lucy Griffiths, Ailsa Grahame, Betty Hare). This episode was written by John Cleese, and is the suggested prototype for "Fawlty Towers".
Michael Upton gets involved in psychiatry and has trouble both with patients (David Jason and Noel Coleman), and the Consultant Psychiatrist (Freddie Jones).
Still at the practice of Dr Griffin (Brian Oulton) Upton and Collier have problems with the local white witch (Patricia Routledge) who seems to provide better care to some of their own patients (Mollie Sugden, Larry Noble, Miki Ivenia).
Mrs Askey (Hattie Jacques), a very possessive mother, calls Michael Upton out at all hours to look at her daughter (Moira Foot). Mr Askey (Michael Godfrey) is not amused...
With Dr Griffin in hospital, Collier and Stuart-Clark try to drum up business at the practice and improve its image including cinema ads, Upton tries to recruit a locum to replace Paul. A very well qualified applicant presents herself (Tessa Wyatt as Dr Nicky Barrington). With Christopher Timothy as a Rolls Royce representative.
Things get involved between Dr Barrington and Mike.
Loftus (Ernest Clark) returns to St Swithin’s as Professor of Surgery at the same time as Mike lands a job as SHO on the Dean’s firm. Loftus, appalled at how standards have slipped, discovers the movement of illicit booze, but is suddenly taken ill. As the Dean (Ralph Michael) has got drunk at the England – France rugby match, Upton has to perform the operation on Loftus. With Astley Harvey and Roy Evans as patients, Jean McFarlane as sister, and Arthur English as the head porter.
Fellow doctor Huw Evans (Martin Shaw) and his wife (Ursula Barclay) are expecting. Mike also has to deal with strange patients (Blake Butler and Hugh Walters), and Bingham.
To earn extra money, Upton and Collier become Anatomy demonstrators. Their sessions coincide with a visit by members of the new board of hospital governors. With Colin Cunningham as the Bishop, Brian Stirner and Juliet Kempson.
Mike and Dick go after the new intake of student nurses.
With Joy Stewart as Sister Fowles, Maggie Henderson and Andria Lawrence as nurses and Janina Faye as Paul’s ‘kid sister’.
Drunken celebrations on a train over an inheritance lead Upton, Stuart Clark and Bingham to an overnight stay in the police cells, but Mike and Dick are rescued by Loftus. With Norman Mitchell as a constable and Rupert Davies as the police inspector. It all ends up in front of the hospital board, including Peter Stephens and Harold Bennett.
Back at St Swithin’s, Mike is admitted for mumps and despite the attractions of Nurse Parker (Angela Douglas), is keen to get out. With Mollie Mauran as a nervous patient, James Bree as a boring patient and Desmond Jones as his boring brother.
To revise for his primary fellowship exams Michael stays at a health farm run on strict lines by a Mr Moon (John Le Mesurier) where Dick Stuart-Clark has an easy job as the resident doctor. Fellow inmates include Wanda Ventham, Geoffrey Lumsden, Bill Wallis, David King and Tony Bateman, - all desperate to avoid the strict regime.
Mike goes away for some fishing before his fellowship exam. On his way back to St Swithin’s he offers a hitchhiker a lift, but his car breaks down. Stranded in a country pub, he is forced to do his viva (student doctors are given an oral exam, based on their written thesis, called a Viva, short for Viva Voce - Latin for "by live voice") with Loftus and Professor Sinnot (Clifford Mollison) over the phone, despite the pub noise in the background (Stewart Sherwin, David Webb, Cyril Cross).
A chaotic evening in Casualty results in an encounter with a judge with piles, Justice Holcroft (Lockwood West), and a criminal, Bertram Hoyle (Jack Smethurst) who is allergic to penicillin. Ending up in court, with QC Mortimer Turnbull (William Lucas) defending Upton, luckily Loftus comes to the rescue.
The appointment of a senior house surgeon on the Dean’s firm doesn’t go smoothly when the panel (Upton, Collier and Bingham) are faced with an unexpected candidate. The presence of an American registrar, Rick Harley (Richard Pendrey), sows more confusion. With Nosher Powell (a labourer in Outpatients), Ralph Michael (the Dean), Joan Ingram (his wife), Esta Charkham (the Dean’s daughter), and job applicants John Baddeley as Dr McDougall, and – Tessa Wyatt (Nicky Barrington).
Notes.
The first six episodes, from "Now, Dr. Upton" to "Congratulations, It's A Toad", were recorded in black and white due to the ITV 'Colour Strike'.

So What (Pink song)

"So What" is a song recorded by American recording artist Pink for her fifth studio album, "Funhouse" (2008). The song was written by Pink, Max Martin and Shellback while production was handled by Martin. Selected as the album's debut single, "So What" was first released to mainstream radios on August 25, 2008, through LaFace and Jive Records. The song incorporates musical styles of pop rock while consisting of a martial beat and synth backing. The lyrics are based on her separation from motocross racer Carey Hart, which occurred six months prior to the release.
"So What" received generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics; many praised it for its aggressive and empowering nature while others deemed it childish and bratty. The song was also successful commercially, topping the charts in several countries across Europe and Oceania and peaking within the top five worldwide. In the United States, the song reached number one on the "Billboard" Hot 100, becoming her first number one hit on the chart as a solo artist and her second overall. "So What" also became her highest selling single in the United States, with sales of over four million downloads.
The music video for "So What" was directed by longtime collaborator Dave Meyers. It shows Pink drinking while riding a lawnmower, sawing down a tree, streaking on a red carpet appearance and other activities. The video also features a cameo appearance from Hart. Pink performed "So What" on MTV Europe Music Awards 2008 on November 6, 2008. The song was nominated for several awards, eventually winning the MTV Europe Music Award for the Most Addictive Track.
Background and production.
"So What" was written by Pink, Shellback and Max Martin, drawing influences from the experience. Martin also handled the production and recording, which took place at Maratone Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. Al Clay also recorded the song at the House of Blues Studio - a recording studio in Los Angeles, California. The song was mixed at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia by Serban Ghenea. John Hanes edited the song using ProTools technology with assistance provided by Tim Roberts. The song was finally mastered by Tom Coyne at Sterling Sound in New York City, New York. The song's lyrical content was based on her separation from her husband motocross rider Carey Hart. After reuniting with her husband Carey Hart in January 1, 2009, Pink told Ellen DeGeneres in an interview on her show that she found it "funny" to perform the song when he was in the audience and especially enjoyed the bit where she sang the line "You're a tool".
Composition.
"So What" is an uptempo pop rock song that carries an energetic vibe. The song consists of a powerful charging beat, a singalong chorus, and a synthesizer backing influenced by club music. The song is in the key of A. Lyrically, the song chronicles the protagonist's adventures following her separation from her former lover. Evan Sawdey of "PopMatters" noted that the song has a hint of desperation in the lines "I don’t want you tonight, I’m alright, I'm just fine", implying that she is spending time convincing herself that she’s enjoying the single life.
Release.
"So What" was released as the first single from Pink's fifth studio album "Funhouse" (2008). It was first released on August 11, 2008 via digital download to certain countries including Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. LaFace and Jive Records solicited the song to contemporary hit radio on August 25, 2008. On September 20, 2008, "So What was released as a two-track single to digital retailers in certain countries. The single included a B-side, "Could've Had Everything". A extended play was released across Europe on September 26, 2008, containing "Could've had Everything" and the original and instrumental version of "So What". On October 24 and November 14, 2008, remixes by UK dance music group Bimbo Jones was released to digital retailers across Europe in the form of a radio mix and the regular mix. In the United States, "So What" was released as a CD single, featuring the clean and unedited versions of the song.
Critical reception.
Reed Fischer of "Village Voice" noted it as the "newest entry in the Fantastic Empowerment Anthems genre." Stephen Thomas Erlewine, senior editor of Allmusic, named it one of "Funhouse"'s best tracks, calling it, in conjunction with "Bad Influence", "instantly indelible". Andy Battaglia of "The A.V. Club" expressed a different opinion towards the song, calling it "so blaring and bad as to make "Funhouse" seem like a lost cause from the start." Chris Willman of "Entertainment Weekly" praised "So What" as a great anthem of "bluffing and bravado" while Jon Caramanica of "The New York Times" referred to the song as "perfunctory". Evan Sawdey of "PopMatters" wrote positively about the song, calling it "as big a red herring single as you can find." Jonathan Keefe of "Slant Magazine" called "So What" a moderate effort compared to the songs n the first of "Funhouse". Keefe later referred to it as nothing more than a "schoolyard taunt", linking it to Pink's 2001 single "Get the Party Started" ("Missundaztood", 2001).
Bill Lamb of "About.com" awarded "So What" a four and a half-star rating, praising the song's synth backing and beat and Pink's attitude. Lamb also praised Max Martin for his production work on the song, writing that he "punches up the energy level to 10." Nick Levine of "Digital Spy", in his review of the leaked single, called the song "brash, childish, slightly ridiculous, packed with attitude and sounds like something only Pink could get away with." Levine also called it "terrifically catchy" and praised the chorus as one "that practically begs you to chant along." Following its official release in the United Kingdom, Levine awarded it a five-star rating, calling it one that people will sing along to. Lucy Davies of "BBC" called the song an "aggressively swinging opener" that "slams Pink's cards down on the table setting the defiant, self-deprecating tone of the album." Michael Cragg of "musicOMH" wrote that Pink was at her best when she uses her life experiences to create "smart, energetic pop songs", citing "So What" as one of them.

This song was number 29 on "Rolling Stone"'s list of the 100 Best Songs of 2008. "Time" critic Josh Tyrangiel named this the #2 song of 2008.

Herbert Freudenberger

Herbert J. Freudenberger (1926 – 1999) was a German-born American psychologist. Though Freudenberger had many jobs in his life, including practitioner, editor, theoretician, and author, his most significant contribution is in the understanding and treatment of stress, burnout, and substance abuse. 
Freudenberger was one of the first to describe the symptoms of exhaustion professionally and conduct a comprehensive study on burnout. In 1980, he published a book dealing with burnout, which became a standard reference on the phenomenon. His most prestigious award was the American Psychological Foundation Gold Medal Award for Life Achievement in the Practice of Psychology in 1999.
Early life.
Freudenberger was born on November 26, 1926 in Frankfurt, Germany, to a middle-class Jewish-German family. His father was a cattle dealer, while his mother had three jobs: bookkeeper, housekeeper, and business partner. 
In 1933, Hitler came to power in Germany. After the beating of Freudenberger's grandmother and the death of his grandfather, he fled to the United States, with his parents' approval and false passport in hand. Traveling alone through multiple cities and countries, Freudenberger arrived in New York, where he cared for himself until a relative took him in. Once he had settled in New York, Freudenberger quickly learned English, and graduated from a junior high school with honors. When his parents finally made it to the U.S., Freudenberger went to work as a tool and die maker's apprentice to support them, instead of moving on to high school.
College.
Without a high school diploma and working at the manufacturing plant, Freudenberger began attending night classes at Brooklyn College. In a psychology class, he made the acquaintance of Abraham Maslow, who steered Freudenberger towards a degree in psychology and was his model and mentor. In 1951, Freudenberger received his bachelors degree in psychology from Brooklyn College. He entered New York University's (NYU) clinical psychology program, and earned his masters degree in psychology in 1952, followed by his doctorate in psychology in 1956. While attending NYU, Freudenberger studied alongside Florence Halpern and Bernard Kalinkowitz. During this time, Freudenberger was also a student at the National Psychological Association for Psychoanalysis (NPAP) (as well as NYU) and continued to work at the factory at night. In 1962, he finished his analytic training alongside Theodore Reik at NPAP.
Career.
Freudenberger started his own psychological-psychoanalytic practice in 1958, which became very successful. From 1970 to 1999, Freudenberger was senior faculty member and training analyst at NPAP, while continuing his private practice. In his career, Freudenberer was also an assistant/visiting professor at Great Neck Adult Education Center (1958 to 1960), Queens College, City University of New York (1962 to 1965), Brooklyn College (1955 to 1958), Louisiana State University (1956), New York University (1963 to 1973), and New School for Social Research (1974 to 1988). In the 1970s, Freudenberger decided to help the development of the free clinic movement, which, unusually for the time, treated substance abusers. Freudenberger devoted a large amount of time to these clinics, without pay. As a consultant, he created and supervised training programs for drug abuse treatment at the Archdiocese of New York from 1974 to 1984.
Throughout his career, Freudenberger made scholarly contributions that were recognized in the United States and around the world. In recognition, he was made Fellow of the American Psychological Association in 1972. He also received awards such as the Psychologist of the Year Award from both the American Psychological Association (APA) and the American Society of Psychologists in Private Practice in 1981, the Distinguished Psychologist Award from the APA and their Division of Psychotherapy in 1983, the Presidential Citation from the APA in 1990, and the Carl F. Heiser Special Presidential Award from the (APA) in 1992.
Freudenberger worked for the APA Task Force on Substance Abuse in 1991 and the Board of Professional Affairs from 1975-78. He also worked for the APA on the Council of Representatives; there, he represented the Division of Independent Practice from 1986–89, and the Division of Psychotherapy from 1974–75, and 1982-84. He was president of both the Divisions of Psychotherapy from 1980–81 and of Independent Practice from 1982–83, and also of the New York Society of Clinical Psychologists from 1965–67 and 1978–79, and also a founding board member of the National Academies of Practice in 1981 and a national co-chair of the National Council of Graduate Education in Psychology from 1968-74.
Burnout.
His clinical concept for Burnout (psychology) was originally developed from his work with the free clinics and through therapeutic communities. Freudenberger defines burnout to be a "state of mental and physical exhaustion caused by one's professional life". Along with colleague Gail North, Freudenberger created a list of phases of burnout.
Family and death.
Freudenberger met Arlene Francis Somer in 1961 and they wed shortly after. Together, they had three children: Lisa, Mark, and Lori. Lisa received a doctoral degree in clinical psychology. Mark became a business entrepreneur (specializing in real estate). Lori became an assistant district attorney. Freudenberger treasured his family very much. They traveled a lot together throughout the United States, and also traveled to Canada, Europe, and Israel. Though he grew up in Germany, he never returned. Late in life he was interviewed on video by the Shoah Foundation for its collection of memoirs of Jewish Holocaust survivors. From 1994 to 1999, Freudenberger battled kidney disease along with failing physical health. He continued to work until he died in the New York City Hospital on November 29, 1999.

Chateau Colline

Chateau Colline is an historic eight-unit apartment building on Wilshire Boulevard in the Westwood section of Los Angeles, California. Designed by architect Percy Parke Lewis, Chateau Colline was built in 1935. Its leaded-glass windows, turrets, and climbing vines give it the appearance of a castle. The building also has large wood-burning fireplaces with handcrafted mantels, bakelite intercoms, vaulted ceilings and outside nooks for milk bottles. The "Los Angeles Times" has reported that rumor has it that "Clark Gable and Bette Davis once lived there, holding lavish parties in a second-story apartment."
In 2001, the owner applied for a permit to demolish the building to build a six-story condominium project in its place. With support from the Los Angeles Conservancy, tenants, led by Vidala, organized an effort to declare the building an historic monument in order to prevent its demolition. The owner claimed the rent-controlled building had become a financial drain and needed new plumbing and electrical systems. Los Angeles City Councilman Jack Weiss supported the effort to declare the building a historic landmark, calling it a "unique, vital piece of Holmby Hills and Westwood history." The City Council eventually voted 14 to 0 to declare the building a landmark.
Chateau Colline was recognized as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument (LAHCM #703) by the city Cultural Heritage Commission in 2001, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.

Bolonka

Bolonka () — refers to small breeds of dog of the Bichon type, originally from Russia, developed from the Bichon Frisé and further developed in Germany. They include the Franzuskaya Bolonka (Bolonka Franzuskaya) and the Bolonka Zwetnaya (bunte Schoßhündchen, Tsvetnaya Bolonka). "Franzuskaya" means French, "Zwetnaya" means multicolored, and "Bolonka" translates as "Bolognese" in a number of Slavic languages. This may pose a challenge to the idea that the Bolonka was developed from the Bichon Frisé, suggesting instead that the original dogs brought into Russia may have been French Bolognese.
Appearance.
Bolonka are 24 – 26 cm high at the withers and 2-4 or 5 kg in weight. The Franzuskaya Bolonka is white, and the Bolonka Zwetna may be of various colours.
Recognition.
Although popular in Germany, Bolonka are not recognized as a separate breed by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale. The white version, the "Bolonka Franzuska", was recognised by the VDH (German national kennel club) as a variation of the Bolognese. That fact that Russian Bolonka are not recognised stems from the lack of a national kennel club in Russia, after the fall of communism. Without an active national club, the Fédération Cynologique Internationale will not recognise the Russian dogs; in addition, there have been reports of irregularities in record keeping since in present day Russia "there is no single Kennel Club but a number of smaller clubs who basically do whatever they want."
History.
Through the connection between the Russian and French aristocracy in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, a type dog similar to the Bichon Frisé or Bolognese of today was brought to tsarist Russia. These little white dogs were favorites of the fashionable ladies of the period in both countries. After the Russian Revolution, the breed was isolated from the French dogs. The little dogs began to be taken seriously as a native Russian breed in the 1950s, and grew in popularity. Export of the dogs was strictly regulated. In 1978 a breeding pair of Bolonka franzuska was sent as a diplomatic gift from the Soviet Union into the GDR. From these and a few others, the white Franzuskaya Bolonka began to be developed as a breed in Germany in the 1980s. Eventually it was recognized by the VDF (Verband für das Deutsche Hundewesen) as a variation of the Bolognese. At the same time a coloured version was also being developed, the Bolonka Zwetnaya (bunte Schoßhündchen, Tsvetnaya Bolonka, Deutscher Bolonka). These are not yet recognised although they have active breed clubs in several countries.

Astronomy in Chile

Chile can be considered the astronomy capital of the world. At present (2011), Chile is home to 42% of the world's astronomy infrastructure of telescopes, and by 2018 it will contain 70% of the global infrastructure. In the Atacama desert region in north, the skies are exceptionally clear and dry for more than 300 days a year. These optimal conditions have led the world's scientific community to develop in the Atacama desert the most ambitious astronomical projects in the history of mankind.
Chile welcomes a diverse and active astronomical community that includes Chilean and international professionals and others, such as astronomers, engineers, students, teachers and amateurs.
The first documented testimony of an astronomical measurement done in Chile is the observation of a lunar eclipse by the soldier Pedro Cuadrado Chavino (June 1582). He used a classic Greek method to obtain the latitude of the city of Valdivia based on the eclipse's measurements. In 1849, during the government of Manuel Bulnes, a scientific mission of the U.S. navy run by James M. Gilliss arrived to Chile for observing Venus and Mars to calculate the Earth-Sun distance. The Gilliss mission established the first astronomical observatory in the Cerro Santa Lucia (Santiago). In 1852, the facilities were transferred to Chile and the National Astronomical Observatory was created.
During the second half of the 20th century, the U.S. and European observatories were installed in different locations of the north of the country: La Silla, Cerro Tololo, Las Campanas and later Cerro Paranal, Cerro Pachon and Chajnantor.

Devotion (1946 film)

Devotion is a 1946 American biographical film directed by Curtis Bernhardt and starring Ida Lupino, Paul Henreid, Olivia de Havilland, and Sydney Greenstreet. Based on a story by Theodore Reeves, the film is a highly fictionalized account of the lives of the Brontë sisters. The movie features Montagu Love's last role; he died almost three years before the film's delayed release.
Plot Summary.
The story takes place in the early 1800s, when the Brontë sisters Charlotte and Anne have made the decision to leave their family - their sister Emily, their brother Branwell, their aunt and their vicar father - to take positions as governesses in other families. the two sisters long to break free from their tedious life and get experiences from the outside world, to prepare for their careers as writers. 
They have the intention of giving part of their income from the governess positions to their talented brother Branwell, so that he can go to London and study art, to become a great temperamental painter. 
One night when Bran is getting drunk at a local tavern, a man named Arthur Nicholls, his father's new curate, arrives. The drunk Bran insists that Arthur accompany him to the vicarage. At first Arthur refuses, believing that it is too late in the evening. When he realizes how drunk Bran has become, he accompanies him to see that he gets home safe and sound. 
Emily, who answers the door, mistakes Arthur for one of Bran's drunken friends and treats him with contempt. The next day Bran leaves for London again, and Arthur reappears at the house. He is greeted by the unwelcoming Mr. Brontë, and soon Emily realizes her mistake and she and Arthur become good friends. they go on walks together, and one day Emily shows Arthur a lonely house on a hill, the one that inspired her writing her novel Wuthering Heights. 
Time passes and a disillusioned Bran returns home from London. He blames all his sisters for his failure as a painter. Soon after Charlotte and Anne also return home, and at a ball at the neighboring Thornton house, Arthur is struck by Charlotte's beauty and falls in love with her. When Charlotte realizes that Emily is interested in Arthur, she becomes interested in him as well. Later, a drunken Bran disrupts the dance, and Arthur leaves the dance and takes him home. 
Arthur discovers that Charlotte wants to take Emily with her to Brussels to further their educations. Since he is in love with Charlotte he decides to sponsor the trip. He secretly buys a painting from Bran, and with the money from the sale the sisters are able to go to Europe. Emily hopes that Arthur will ask her to stay behind, but he has fallen in love with Charlotte and will not comply. 
The girls start their education at the school of Monsieur and Madame Heger, located in Brussels. Before long Charlotte admits to Emily that she has received unwelcome attentions while she was a governess and that after she returned home, Arthur kissed her. Emily is heartbroken by the news. That night, Emily dreams about the moors and a threatening black horseman. Not so long after that, Monsieur Heger takes Charlotte privately to an exhibition and kisses her. 
When she returns to the Hegers' house, Emily is already packing, having received a letter from Anne saying that Bran is ill. Both Charlotte and Emily immediately rush back to England, and once they are back, they both start writing their novels. Bran reads them both and then he tells Emily that they are both in love with the same man. Eventually the sisters learn that Arthur bought the painting that financed their trip to Europe, and Emily insists that they should repay him. 
One day Emily can’t find Bran so she goes out in the rain looking for him. She finds him, and shortly after that he collapses and dies. Emily’s book Wuthering Heights and Charlotte's book, Jane Eyre, are both published under male pseudonyms. Despite the fact that Charlotte's sells best, famous author William Makepeace Thackeray believes that Emily's is the greatest of the two. 
Thackeray meets Charlotte and introduces her to London society. She convinces him to take her to the poverty-stricken East End, where Arthur now works. Arthur admits to Charlotte that he loves her, but because Emily loved him, he felt he could not stay in Yorkshire. 
Charlotte gets a message that Emily is taken seriously ill, and she hurries home to Yorkshire. She arrives just in time for her to say goodbye before her sister dies from her illness. After Emily’s demise Arthur returns to woo Charlotte.
Production.
"Devotion" was filmed between November 11, 1942 and mid-February 1943, but was delayed to be screened until April 5, 1946 at the Strand Theater in Manhattan, due to a lawsuit by Olivia de Havilland against Warner Brothers. De Havilland successfully sued her studio to terminate her contract without providing the studio an extra six months to make up for her time on suspension. It proved a landmark case for the industry.
Reception.
Bosley Crowther wrote in the "New York Times": “The Warners have simplified matters to an almost irreducible extreme and have found an explanation for the Brontës in Louisa May Alcott terms. They have visioned sombrous Emily, the author of Wuthering Heights, and Charlotte, the writer of Jane Eyre, as a couple of 'little women" with a gift." Despite an excellent score by Erich Wolfgang Korngold, and production values and an ending that hearkened back to the earlier Wuthering Heights by Warner Brothers’ rival studio, the press generally put ‘’Devotion’’ down as “…a mawkish costume romance, even with identities removed. Presented as the story of the Brontës—and with the secondary characters poorly played — it is a ridiculous tax upon reason and an insult to plain intelligence.”
On February 17, 1947, "Lux Radio Theater" broadcast a 60 minute radio adaptation of the movie starring Jane Wyman, Vincent Price and Virginia Bruce.

Pak Shek Kok (白石角) is a place in Tai Po District in Hong Kong, located between Ma Liu Shui and Tai Po Kau, close to Cheung Shue Tan (樟樹灘) and facing Tolo Harbour (Tai Po Hoi). The Kowloon-Canton Railway, Tolo Highway, Hong Kong Science Park are all situated on the reclamation outside Pak Shek Kok.
Geography.
Pak Shek Kok was the estuary of two creeks from nearby valleys of Cheung Shue Tau. Kok (角) in Cantonese means convex land on the shore and thus was used to describe the land formed by two creeks running in to Tai Po Hoi. Pak Shek (白石) means white rock. It is probably the feature of land but without well documentary.
The estuary was completely covered by reclamation and the mouth of creeks was redirect to a drainage.
Politics.
The proper Pak Shek Kok and surrounding villages are within Tai Po District. As it is close to the border of Sha Tin District. The reclamation off Pak Shek Kok divides. Most of Hong Kong Science Park belongs to Sha Tin and the rest belongs to Tai Po.
Development.
In January 2013, the government issued a proposal to develop Pak Shek Kok (East) for residential use, under Outline Zoning Plan S/PSK/10.

Commutation theorem

In mathematics, a commutation theorem explicitly identifies the commutant of a specific von Neumann algebra acting on a Hilbert space in the presence of a trace. The first such result was proved by F.J. Murray and John von Neumann in the 1930s and applies to the von Neumann algebra generated by a discrete group or by the dynamical system associated with a
measurable transformation preserving a probability measure. Another important application is in the theory of unitary representations of unimodular locally compact groups, where the theory has been applied to the regular representation and other closely related representations. In particular this framework led to an abstract version of the Plancherel theorem for unimodular locally compact groups due to Irving Segal and Forrest Stinespring and an abstract Plancherel theorem for spherical functions associated with a Gelfand pair due to Roger Godement. Their work was put in final form in the 1950s by Jacques Dixmier as part of the theory of Hilbert algebras. It was not until the late 1960s, prompted partly by results in algebraic quantum field theory and quantum statistical mechanics due to the school of Rudolf Haag, that the more general non-tracial Tomita–Takesaki theory was developed, heralding a new era in the theory of von Neumann algebras.
Commutation theorem for finite traces.
Let "H" be a Hilbert space and "M" a von Neumann algebra on "H" with a unit vector Ω such that
The vector Ω is called a "cyclic-separating trace vector". It is called a trace vector because the last condition means that the matrix coefficient corresponding to Ω defines a tracial state on "M". It is called cyclic since Ω generates "H" as a topological "M"-module. It is called separating
because if "a"Ω = 0 for "a" in "M", then "aM"'Ω= (0), and hence "a" = 0.
It follows that the map
for "a" in "M" defines a conjugate-linear isometry of "H" with square the identity "J"2 = "I". The operator "J" is usually called the modular conjugation operator. 
It is immediately verified that "JMJ" and "M" commute on the subspace "M" Ω, so that 
The commutation theorem of Murray and von Neumann states that
One of the easiest ways to see this is to introduce "K", the closure of the real
subspace "M"sa Ω, where "M"sa denotes the self-adjoint elements in "M". It follows that
an orthogonal direct sum for the real part of inner product. This is just the real orthogonal decomposition for the ±1 eigenspaces of "J".
On the other hand for "a" in "M"sa and "b" in "M"'sa, the inner product ("ab"Ω, Ω) is real, because "ab" is self-adjoint. Hence "K" is unaltered if "M" is replaced by "M" '. 
In particular Ω is a trace vector for "M"' and "J" is unaltered if "M" is replaced by "M" '. So the opposite inclusion 
follows by reversing the roles of "M" and "M"'.
Examples.
One of the most important cases of the group–measure space construction is when Γ is the group of integers Z, i.e. the case of a single invertible
measurable transformation "T". Here "T" must preserve the probability measure μ. Semifinite traces are required to handle the case when "T" (or more generally Γ) only preserves an infinite equivalent measure; and the full force of the Tomita–Takesaki theory is required when there is no invariant measure in the equivalence class, even though the equivalence class of the measure is preserved by "T" (or Γ).
Commutation theorem for semifinite traces.
Let "M" be a von Neumann algebra and "M"+ the set of positive operators in "M". By definition, a semifinite trace (or sometimes just trace) on "M" is a functional τ from "M"+ into [0,∞] such that
If in addition τ is non-zero on every non-zero projection, then τ is called a faithful trace.
If τ is a faithul trace on "M", let "H" = "L"2("M", τ) be the Hilbert space completion of the inner product space 
with respect to the inner product 
The von Neumann algebra "M" acts by left multiplication on "H" and can be identified with its image. Let 
for "a" in "M"0. The operator "J" is again called the "modular conjugation operator" and extends to a conjugate-linear isometry of "H" satisfying "J"2 = I. The commutation theorem of Murray and von Neumann 
is again valid in this case. This result can be proved directly by a variety of methods, but follows immediately from the result for finite traces, by repeated use of the following elementary fact:
Hilbert algebras.
The theory of Hilbert algebras was introduced by Godement (under the name "unitary algebras"), Segal and Dixmier to formalize the classical method of defining the trace for trace class operators starting from Hilbert-Schmidt operators. Applications in the representation theory of groups naturally lead to examples of Hilbert algebras. Every von Neumann algebra endowed with a semifinite trace has a canonical "completed" or "full" Hilbert algebra associated with it; and conversely a completed Hilbert algebra of exactly this form can be canonically associated with every Hilbert algebra. The theory of Hilbert algebras can be used to deduce the commutation theorems of Murray and von Neumann; equally well the main results on Hilbert algebras can also be deduced directly from the commutation theorems for traces. The theory of Hilbert algebras was generalised by Takesaki as a tool for proving commutation theorems for semifinite weights in Tomita–Takesaki theory; they can be dispensed with when dealing with states.
Definition.
A Hilbert algebra is an algebra formula_23 with involution "x"→"x"* and an inner product (,) such that
Properties.
Let "H" be the Hilbert space completion of formula_23 with respect to the inner product and let "J" denote the extension of the involution to a conjugate-linear involution of "H". Define a representation λ and an anti-representation ρ of 
formula_23 on itself by left and right multiplication:
These actions extend continuously to actions on "H". In this case the commutation theorem for Hilbert algebras
states that
Moreover if
the von Neumann algebra generated by the operators λ("a"), then
These results were proved independently by and .
The proof relies on the notion of "bounded elements" in the Hilbert space completion "H". 
An element of "x" in "H" is said to be bounded (relative to formula_23) if the map "a" → "xa" of formula_23 into "H" extends to a 
bounded operator on "H", denoted by λ("x"). In this case it is straightforward to prove that:
The commutation theorem follows immediately from the last assertion. In particular
The space of all bounded elements formula_36 forms a Hilbert algebra containing formula_23 as a dense *-subalgebra. It is said to be completed or full because any element in "H" bounded relative to formula_36must actually already lie in formula_36. The functional τ on "M"+ defined by
if "x" =λ(a)*λ(a) and ∞ otherwise, yields a faithful semifinite trace on "M" with

Colegio de la Inmaculada Concepcion

Colegio de la Inmaculada Concepción, better known as CIC, is in Cebu City, Philippines. It is a private Catholic school for boys and girls that began in 1880, making it the first in the Philippines.
Inauguration of Colegio de la Inmaculada Concepción, May 30, 1880.
In the middle of the 19th century, the necessity of founding a charitable institution was felt in the Diocese of Cebu. To this end, a hospital for leprous patients was founded by the Ilmo, Obispo de Cebu, Romualdo Jimeno.
Rev. Fernando de la Canal, C.M. was to be the source and soul of the charitable works of the hospital. Fr. de la Canal arrived in Cebu on November 13, 1869, having been a priest in his home province Burgos, Spain. He was convinced that the young women working in the Casa de Caridad had the necessary vocation to continue indefinitely. To foster this vocation, he thought of giving them a religious habit to wear in place of their lay clothes and to name them “Hermanitas de la Madre de Dios” (Little Sisters of the Mother of God). With the establishment of this religious community on September 8, 1878, came the appointment of a new Superior. This fell, by common consent, upon Apolonia Lasala. Thereupon the new community renewed its desire to consecrate its members to God through the service of the sick poor. The Casa de Caridad was situated on Calle Solidaridad but, in time, this was destroyed and a new wing of the Colegio was constructed in its place.
A few days after the Hermanitas' habit-taking, the Ilmo, Bishop Benito de Madridejos of Cebu visited the new community and, seeing the opportunities for the benefit of the entire diocese, proposed to the Rector of the Seminary, Fr. Farre, and to Fr. de la Canal and companions, the opening of a Colegio for girls, with the Hermanitas in charge. However, there were many obstacles to overcome, such as the lack of land, house and personnel. To generate funds, the Hermanitas resorted to the making of scapulars, from which they were to purchase a little house fronting the seminary. With this, the construction began. Meanwhile, efforts were made to look for the right persons to direct the work. Two came from Manila: Cirila Miranda from Concordia College and Hilaria Salinas from Hospicio de San Jose. Both had obtained their Teacher's Certificates from the Normal School. Arriving in Cebu in February, 1880, they were attracted to the company of the Hermanitas and, on 15 May of the same year, they dressed the holy habit and became part of the small community.
The school year 1880–1881 was fast approaching, and the work of the Colegio was progressing much too slowly. The Hermanitas, therefore, rented a house belonging to Don Antonio Roa, which was in front of the seminary. Two classrooms were prepared on the second floor, a third room served for the free school and thus, simply and without ostentation, classes opened on May 30, 1880, thus inaugurating Colegio de la Inmaculada Concepción.
First years of Colegio de la Inmaculada Concepción.
The “colegio” was a simple one-storey affair situated at Martires Street, fronting the Colegio Seminario de San Carlos. The Administration was entrusted to the community of the Hermanitas de la Madre de Dios. Sr. Hilaria Salinas became the directress of the first group of 63 girls. More like a finishing school, the curriculum was a blend of the academic (elementary and secondary in content) and the cultural (Home Economics and Fine Arts and Music). Spanish was the medium of instruction.
On January 29, 1895, the Visitatrix and Visitor of the Daughters of Charity arrived in Cebu with the first five Sisters. The following day the incorporation of 20 Hermanitas de la Madre de Dios with these five Daughters of Charity took place in a solemn High Mass and Te Deum was sung for thanksgiving. The Sisters were fused with the first community of Spanish Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul, who came to the Philippines to bring the gospel message of Christ. It held the distinction of being the first Catholic school for girls in Cebu that offered special emphasis in religion, Spanish, music and home arts. Since the fusion on January 29, 1895 of the Hermanitas with the Daughters of Charity, the Colegio de la Inmaculada Concepción has always been managed by these Sisters.
The Philippine Revolution broke out in 1898. The Sisters helped the victims of the hostilities. In the account of the "The Revolt in Cebu 1898", Madrileña de la Cerna in her article “Some Sources on Women's Participation in the Revolution in Central and Eastern Visayas” writes:
In the 19th account, on the day of the attack on Good Friday, a bloody skirmish led the Visayan nuns of the Colegio de la Inmaculada Concepción of the Sisters of Charity (Spanish Congregation) to attend the wounded. The narrator described how the nuns personally dragged the wounded to the hospital, held vigil, without a fee, without regard to the color or background of the person as long as their altruistic mission was fulfilled.
With a very brief interruption during the Philippine Revolution in 1898, Inmaculada was soon offering other courses: Clase Preparatoria, Clase Media, Taquigrafia, Mecanografia, Piano, Canto, Pintura, Bordado y Labores. Spanish continued as the official language. When the Americans took over, Inmaculada provided the first public schools of the Visayan region with well-prepared teachers. In 1911, CIC started to offer elementary and secondary courses in English, with government recognition, turning out the first batch of high school graduates in 1923.
The Asociación de las Hijas de Maria (Association of the Children of Mary) was first organized on October 2, 1905 with Colegio de la Inmaculada Concepción as the first CoM Unit. Full-pledged membership was open to the older students or even teachers. The types of membership were Mary's Angels, Junior Aspirants, Senior Aspirants and Full-pledged members. Usually the Sister Servant or Superior was the Directora of the association.
The school publication, "BLUE and WHITE" came into existence on July 15, 1933 through the initiative of the principal, Sr. Constancia Marilao, and Miss Tomasa Gachapin (later Mrs. Jose Yulo) as the first editor.
November 3, 1935 saw the first alumnae reunion with Sor Fernanda Vaño, DC as its first coordinator. Since then the Homecoming Day became traditional.
In the first quarter of the twentieth century, Loring Larraquel Victorino recalled that:
The following alumnae mostly Damas de la Caridad (Ladies of Charity) of Colegio de la Inmaculada Concepción were active in the service to the community. It was even said that these ex-alumnae were instrumental in the founding of “Asilo de la Milagrosa” then located at Lapu-lapu-Logarta Street. They were Doña Esperanza Velez, Doña Mina Escaño, Doña Inday Rallos, Doña Carmen Sotto, Doña Beatriz Jereza, Doña Pilar Vaño Escaño.
In the second and third quarter of the century another group of ex-alumni worked with Fr. Rhaman, SVD for the reconstruction of one wing of Asilo de la Milagrosa.
At the turn of the 4190s, Inmaculada was an impressive three-storey edifice with façade facing Urdaneta Street and wings embracing Martires, La Soladaridad and Lapu-Lapu streets. The curricular offerings through the initiative of Sor Paz San Buenaventura, D.C. were augmented to reach the tertiary level. Three collegiate courses were offered: a one-year Secretarial, a two-year Junior Normal, and Music Teacher's Junior course with government permit. Sor Fernanda Vaño was the first directress of music.
War years.
At the outbreak of World War II on December 8, 1941, the following courses were being offered: Kindergarten, Elementary, Academic Secondary, Secretarial, Junior Normal, Home Economics, Elementary Course in Piano, Junior Course in Piano and Music Teacher's Diploma. Undaunted by the complete loss of its building and equipment during World War II, the school carried on with equal zeal. With a handful of primary children from the neighborhood, the Sisters managed to re-open the elementary department and one-year Secretarial course during the Japanese occupation at ex-judge Juan Singson's house in Jakosalem Street. There, the “Lesser Inmaculada” did what it could until the American liberation forces took the Japanese by surprise on September 12, 1944.
In 1945, the elementary and high school classes were housed temporarily in Quonset huts at Gorordo Avenue. The temporary buildings of bamboo and nipa were donated by the 77th Infantry Division of the U.S. Armed Forces of the Far East (USAFFE). In 1946 the new Colegio de la Inmaculada Concepción, an impressive, two-storey structure, was completed on its present site on Gorordo Avenue. In July of the same year, the two-year Normal and one-year Secretarial courses were resumed.
By 1947, the following courses were recognized: Kindergarten, Elementary, Academic Secondary, Secretarial, Associate in Arts, Elementary Course in Piano, Junior Course in Piano, Music Teacher's Diploma. In the same year other collegiate courses were offered: Liberal Arts, Commerce and Home Economics. In succeeding years, these followed: Bachelor of Music major in Piano and Voice (1953) and Bachelor of Science in Education. A cultural contribution was presented December 1957 with the inauguration of the imposing CIC Auditorium.
Further expansion.
1964 was a significant and historical year for Inmaculada. The Philippine congregation of the Daughters of Charity ceased to be a sub-province of Spain and became independent Province with its own Visitatrix, Sr. Felomena Zulueta, D.C.
With this came the appointment in 1966 of Sr. Paz San Buenaventura as the first Filipino Sister Servant of Colegio de la Inmaculada Concepción.
With the progress of the community, the residents appealed to the Sisters to open a school that could undertake the job of providing their children with a Christian education. The Superior of Colegio de la Inmaculada Concepción, Sr. Paz San Buenaventura, took the initial steps to open a CIC Branch in Mandaue. A permit was obtained, and it formally opened on July 7, 1969. Sr. Imelda Espiritu was by then the new Superior. Classes started with 49 children in kindergarten. Since 1969, the CIC Mandaue City branch gradually developed into a grade school, offering kindergarten, preparatory and primary classes from grades one to four. Grades five and six were opened consecutively in 1979 and 1980. With the opening of the intermediate grades, CIC Mandaue is now a complete elementary school. In school year 1999–2000, CIC Mandaue had its first high school graduation.
Expansion of Inmaculada's services to the community came hand in hand with the academics. In June 1968, the Sta. Luisa Social Action Center was opened to take charge of the material and spiritual needs of poor families living behind the school. Through the efforts of the CIC Alumnae Association, this small building expanded and was called the CIC Sta. Luisa Development Center, a two-storey building which houses the extensive school-community services. Inauguration date of CIC-SLDC was on September 27, 1967, feastday of St. Vincent de Paul, founder of the Daughters of Charity and patron of social work. At present, the center is called St. Louise de Marillac Foundation, Inc.
In 1975, the CIC Alumnae Association was formally registered as a juridical body with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with Mrs. Felisa Yap Chiongbian as president. Since then, it has become Inmaculada's dependable arm and generous sponsor in its school and community projects. Musical presentations have been sponsored, such as the Piano Concert of Reynaldo Reyes in the earlier days of the Sta. Luisa Center, the Concert of Sr. Ester B. Peña, DC, pianist, with the Manila Symphony Orchestra in 1977 and the 1982 September Affair featuring the pianist Joselito S. Pascual. The beneficiary of such concerts has been the CIC-Sta. Luisa Development Center, an on-going project of the CIC Alumnae Association.
To assess the quality of instruction and amount of service to the community, Inmaculada applied for accreditation by the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU) in 1974. Formal accreditation was started in 1975 for the high school department and its Certificate of Accreditation was received on March 14, 1977.
Mother Teresa of Calcutta visited Inmaculada on February 7, 1977.
March 15, 1979 ushered in Inmaculada's Centennial Year Celebration. The week-long activities from March 10 to 16, 1980 were simple and impressive and in keeping with the awareness of the Vincentian Mission permeating the school. The most concrete Vincentian service is the Night High School Department established during the centennial year in 1980 — a most fitting gift to the community for the less-fortunate girls of Cebu.
December 2005–December 2006 saw another year-long thanksgiving and celebration for the gift of 125 years. “CIC-Cebu: 125 Years of Spirited Presence” was the theme.
Colegio de la Inmaculada Concepcion today offers Basic Education (Nursery to Grade 10) with the College Department phased out in 1998. This was to concentrate on the Christian formation of the young clientele. As an institution of learning, CIC has been undergoing accreditation by PAASCU since 1977. The institution also underwent a Congregational Evaluation Visit (CEV) in 1987, the first of its kind in Region 7 and a Congregational Mission Audit (CMA) in 2007.
Cognizant of the special role expected of the Catholic schools, CIC-Cebu takes the responsibility of building up the new breed of Filipinos — disciplined, nourished with positive nationalism, proud of the country's cultural heritage, builders of peace, respectful of the dignity of life and creation and citizens of the Church and of the country for a sustainable future.

Alison's House

"Alison's House" is a drama in three acts by American playwright Susan Glaspell. 
It was first produced at Eva Le Gallienne's Civic Repertory Theatre on 14th Street, New York, on 1 December 1930 where it was given 25 performances in the regular repertory season when, unexpectedly, it was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1931. In May 1931 the production was transferred uptown to the Ritz Theatre where it received indifferent reviews and closed after two weeks.
Inspired by the life and work of the American poet Emily Dickinson, the play is set by Glaspell in her native Iowa. It is 18 years since Alison Stanhope, the country's foremost poet, died. Now the house she lived in must be sold, but it holds secrets. Did Alison sacrifice the man she loved for the sake of her family's reputation? And whom do such sacrifices benefit? The play's struggles are set in 1899, on the cusp of the 20th Century in which very different values will come to prevail.

Goodbye (Mary Hopkin song)

"Goodbye" is a song written by Paul McCartney (but credited to Lennon–McCartney) and performed by Mary Hopkin. It was released on 28 March 1969, and it reached No. 2 in the UK singles chart, prevented from reaching the top position by the Beatles' single "Get Back". In the US, released 7 April 1969, the song reached No. 13 on the singles chart. In the Netherlands the single peaked at No. 1.
Background.
The song was conceived as a follow-up to the success of Hopkin's first single, produced by McCartney, titled "Those Were the Days", which was highlighted on her debut album "Postcard", one of the first records issued by the newly founded Apple Records. In later years, McCartney had little recollection of creating the song, which was written in a great hurry to capitalise on Hopkin's popularity, but he did recall being told by a boat skipper from the Orkney Islands that it was the man's favourite song, which seemed appropriate to McCartney since, "if you think of it from a sailor's point of view, it's very much a leaving-the-port song."
Recording.
To assist Hopkin in learning the song, McCartney recorded a solo demo at his home, 7 Cavendish Road, London, in February 1969. The song was arranged by Richard Hewson, who had also orchestrated "Those Were the Days," and produced, along with its flip side, "Sparrow", by Paul McCartney on 1 March 1969 at Morgan Studios in Willesden. To better match Hopkin's voice, the key was raised from C major to E major. The recording was Apple's first official double-A-side, and the first Apple record to feature a full-fledged picture sleeve.
For the recording, Hopkin sang and performed acoustic guitar, while McCartney played bass guitar, an acoustic guitar introduction and solo, along with lap-slapping percussion and drums. Backing vocals, horns and strings, in Hewson's arrangement, were overdubbed. The session was filmed by Apple's Tony Bramwell for a promotional clip. In the footage, Hopkin can be seen miming to the song inside the studio, combined with shots of her and McCartney, smoking a cigarette and finger-popping, in the control room listening to a playback. (The video can be found on YouTube.)
The flip side "Sparrow" was written by Benny Gallagher and Graham Lyle, a songwriting duo signed to Apple Publishing. The recording took place on 2 March 1969; Hopkin sang and played guitar, McCartney added maracas, a session musician played upright bass, and Hewson arranged a choir part.
Mary Hopkin met her future husband, record producer Tony Visconti, while making foreign-language versions of the song.
The song was one of only two hits to be omitted from the compilation disc "The Songs Lennon and McCartney Gave Away", issued originally in 1971 and re-released in 1979.
Paul McCartney recording.
The song was never officially released by either the Beatles or Paul McCartney, although bootleg recordings exist of McCartney's original demo of the song, recorded for Mary Hopkin. The international online magazine PopMatters has published McCartney's demo along with critical commentary expressing a preference for the composer's version over Hopkin's rendition.

Nationalism studies

Nationalism studies is an interdisciplinary academic field devoted to the study of nationalism and related issues. While nationalism has been the subject of scholarly discussion since at least the late eighteenth century, it is only since the early 1990s that it has received enough attention for a distinct field to emerge.
Authors such as Hans Kohn, Elie Kedourie, John Hutchinson, Ernest Gellner, Karl Deutsch, Walker Connor, Anthony D. Smith, and Benedict Anderson laid the foundation for nationalism studies in the post-war period. In the early 1990s their ideas were enthusiastically taken up by academics, journalists, and others looking to understand and explain the apparent resurgence of nationalism marked by events such as the collapse of the Soviet Union, the genocide in Rwanda, and civil war and ethnic cleansing in the republics of the former Yugoslavia.
History of the field.
The development of the field can be divided into four stages: (I) the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when nationalism first emerged, and most interest in it was philosophical; (II) the period from the First World War until the end of the Second, when nationalism became a subject of formal academic inquiry; (III) the post-war period from 1945 to the late 1980s, when several sociologists and political scientists developed general theories of nationalism in the context of worldwide decolonisation and the 'ethnic revival' in the West; and (IV) the period following the fall of communism in 1989, which lead to a surge of interest in nationalism and the crystallisation of nationalism studies as a field.
Eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
"Up to the First World War," Umut Özkirimli explains, "interest in nationalism was largely ethical and philosophical. The scholars of this period, predominantly historians and social philosophers, were more concerned with the 'merits and defects' of the doctrine than with the origins and spread of national phenomena." The nation-state was seen as a progressive stage in the historical development of human societies, and both liberals and Marxists expected that nationalism would eventually give way to a cosmopolitan world order. In this context, nations and nationalism were taken for granted, and most authors who discussed them were motivated by some political concern. There were no attempts to fashion a general theory of nationalism that was applicable to all cases. Some of the important authors in this period include: Johann Gottfried Herder, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Giuseppe Mazzini, Ernest Renan, and John Stuart Mill.
Nationalism as an academic discipline.
Several universities organize degree and non-degree courses on nationalism. Boston University, University of London (particularly the London School of Economics), Central European University (Hungary), and University of Edinburgh are among the most prominent institutions where the study of nationalism occupies a central place. The Faculty of Humanities of Eötvös Loránd University (Hungary) has recently launched a comprehensive short-term program, dedicated exclusively to the study of nationalism.
Journals.
The first journal devoted to the study of nationalism was the "Canadian Review of Studies in Nationalism", founded at the University of Prince Edward Island by Thomas Spira in 1973. Several similar journals have emerged since then, including the following:

All I Need (Jack Wagner song)

All I Need is a 1984 song by American actor and singer Jack Wagner.
Wagner became known for his role as Frisco Jones on the soap opera "General Hospital" prior to recording the song; he has since had roles on other television programs, such as "The Bold and the Beautiful" and "Melrose Place". "All I Need" was written by Glen Ballard, David Pack and Clif Magness and produced by Ballard and David Pack. The song proved to be Wagner's only Top 40 hit, peaking at number two on the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart in early 1985. It remained at the runner-up position for two weeks, behind Madonna's "Like a Virgin". The single did spend two weeks atop "Billboard"'s adult contemporary chart. The ballad is the title-track to Wagner's 1984 debut album. The song is a romantic plea from Wagner to the one he loves: "All I need / Is just a little more time / To be sure what I feel".
In 2007, the song was covered by Filipino rock band Shamrock for the Filipino romantic comedy movie "My Best Friend's Girlfriend".
In 2009, VH1 ranked "All I Need" No. 71 on its program "100 Greatest One Hit Wonders of the 80s".

<doc id="18404778" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18404778" title="Lob bomb">
Lob bomb

A lob bomb (known officially as an improvised rocket-assisted mortar, improvised rocket-assisted munition, or IRAM) is a rocket-fired improvised explosive device made from a large metal canister (usually a propane gas tank that has been drained of its contents and filled with explosives, scrap metal, and ball bearings), which has been used by insurgents during the Iraq War since late 2007. The weapon is essentially an airborne version of an improvised explosive device. 
Design.
Lob bombs are propelled by 107 mm rockets and launched, several at a time, from the backs of small trucks where they are arranged in rows, sometimes by remote control (using a signal from either a cell phone, cordless phone, command wire, or other form of remote control device). They are typically launched in an arced trajectory, which enables them to be aimed over walls that enclose U.S. bases and other military facilities, in a similar manner to a conventional mortar. The weapon is believed to be highly inaccurate, and unofficial estimates place the range of lob bombs used so far as being between 50 and 150 yards (approx. 45 to 140 m).
History.
According to U.S. military officials, lob bombs are designed to cause "catastrophic damage," and have the ability to kill "scores of soldiers" at once, more than conventional improvised explosive devices. As of July 12, 2008, out of 11 lob bomb attacks on American bases, three U.S. soldiers had been killed and 15 had been wounded, all three deaths occurring in an April 28, 2008 attack on a U.S. base in eastern Baghdad.
So far, the weapon has only been encountered in Baghdad, where it appears to be used by Shiite militias, whose superior ability to conceal forensic evidence about their identity has been acknowledged by the U.S. military. The U.S. military has found that the rockets used to propel the lob bombs have been produced in Iran, Russia, and China. One media report indicates such a munition may have been used by the Taliban to bring down a Chinook helicopter in Afghanistan on August 6, 2011.
Such devices were first described in the international media in July 2008. In July 2008 Major General Jeffery Hammond, the commander of the 4th Infantry Division and commander of U.S. forces in Baghdad, called the lob bomb "the greatest threat right now that we face."
The type of improvised launch system and rocket is not new to warfare. The Provisional Irish Republican Army developed a similar system during the Troubles. It was used in the February 1991 attack on 10 Downing Street, the London office and home of the British prime minister.

Kentucky Fried Cruelty

Kentucky Fried Cruelty is a People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) campaign that began in 2001, and seeks to change KFC's (also known as "Kentucky Fried Chicken") treatment of the chickens that are raised for its restaurants. According to PETA, since the launch of the campaign in 2003, more than 12,000 protests against KFC have occurred. KFC is the fourth fast food restaurant chain targeted by PETA, following campaigns against McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's.
KentuckyFriedCruelty.com.
"KentuckyFriedCruelty.com" was the legal name of Christopher Garnett, a youth outreach worker for PETA, after he changed his name to protest the treatment of chickens by KFC. At the time of his name change, Garnett was the street team coordinator of peta2, PETA's youth division and "the largest youth animal rights group in the world." 
The PETA website showed a copy of KentuckyFriedCruelty.com's drivers license bearing what was his legal name. PETA member Pamela Anderson expressed her support for the name change, as did his parents, although they continued to call him "Chris". Garnett explained in a January 2006 interview:
Pretty much everyone still calls me Chris, some of the people at the office call me Ken or Tuck. But the funny thing about the name change is, regardless of what people call me, every time I go to pay for something, I show someone my ID, I'm able to tell them about how KFC is, you know, cutting the beaks off baby birds and how their workers are slamming chickens in a wall, kicking them like footballs and laughing about it. And people are pretty shocked to hear about this sort of thing. 
Garnett promised his mother he would revert the name change after KFC ceased its "worst abuses" against its chickens; however, following Garnett's official return to his birth name in August 2006, he explained that difficulties encountered when applying for a passport and credit card were the impetus.

There Shall Be No Night

There Shall Be No Night is a three-act play written by American playwright Robert E. Sherwood. The play was presented by the Theatre Guild from April 29 through November 2, 1940, at Broadway's Alvin Theatre (now renamed the Neil Simon Theater). It won the 1941 Pulitzer Prize for Drama.
The play is set in Finland between 1938 and 1940 and concerns a Nobel Prize–winning Finnish scientist (portrayed by Alfred Lunt whose own stepfather was a Finnish-born physician) and his American-born wife (portrayed by Lynn Fontanne), both of whom are reluctant to believe that the Russians will invade their beloved Finland. But with the final advent of Finland's Winter War with the Soviets, their son Erik (Montgomery Clift) joins the Finnish army; and the scientist himself joins its medical corps. John Mason Brown wrote, “No one can complain about the theatre's being an escapist institution when it conducts a class in current events at once as touching, intelligent and compassionate as 'There Shall Be No Night'.”
According to William L. Shirer, Sherwood was inspired to write the play by William Lindsay White's moving Christmas broadcast from the Finnish front during the Winter War. The son of journalist William Allen White, the younger White had been sent there by the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) to report on that war. Sherwood bases his American journalist (portrayed by Richard Whorf) in this play upon W. L. White himself, substantiating this in his preface to the first published edition by Charles Scribner's Sons in 1940.
Title comes from a passage in the Book of Revelation (22:5) which is quoted by Lunt's character in Act 3, Scene 6: "There shall be no night there: They need no lamp nor light of the sun, for the Lord God gives them light..."
Actress Katharine Cornell seventeen years later produced and starred in an NBC television version of the play in 1957 on " The Hallmark Hall of Fame" with Charles Boyer, Bradford Dillman and Ray Walston. This TV version was reset in Hungary in 1956 (changing the names from their original Finnish) in order to reflect current events in the same way that its original had done.

<doc id="18404898" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18404898" title="Jane Collier">
Jane Collier

Jane Collier (1714 – March 1755) was an English novelist most famous for her book "An Essay on the Art of Ingeniously Tormenting" (1753). She also collaborated with Sarah Fielding on her only other surviving work "The Cry" (1754).
During her life, she was able to meet and work with many famous writers of her day. In particular, Samuel Richardson and Henry Fielding both had a particular interest in her intelligence and in her writing ability.
Personal life.
Collier was baptized on the 16th of January 1715 in Wiltshire, the daughter of philosopher and clergyman Reverend Authur Collier, and Margaret Johnson. She had two brothers and one sister. In 1716, their family were forced to move into a less expensive residence in Salisbury to pay debts. It was here that her brother Arthur, named after their father, studied law and educated his sisters, along with her childhood friend Sarah Fielding, in Greek and Latin language and literature; his manner of education was to prepare the girls to become governesses.
In 1732, her father died and Jane (17), along with her sister Margaret (15), were left without anyone to provide for them. In 1748, the sisters moved in with their brother Arthur who was living in the Doctors' Commons. During this time, Arthur "quarrelled" with Henry, and it is possible that a split formed between the siblings. A year after, in 1749, her mother died. Soon after, the living arrangements dissolved, and Margaret became the governess to Henry Fielding's daughters and Jane with Samuel Richardson. Richardson was impressed by Collier's education, and wrote to Lady Bradshaigh that Jane was proof "that women may be trusted with Latin and even Greek, and yet not think themselves above their domestic duties."
Collier never married, possibly because she could not offer a sufficient dowry, or possibly because, like Sarah Fielding, she hoped to establish an independent living through her writing. In 1748, Richardson was using Collier as a go between with Sarah Fielding in order to help the two write. In 1753, she wrote "The Art of Ingeniously Tormenting" with the help of Sarah Fielding and possibly James Harris or Samuel Richardson. Afterwards, it was Richardson who printed the work. Her final book, written with Sarah Fielding, was "The Cry", published in 1754.
She died in 1755, just a year after the publication of "The Cry". The exact date of her death is not known, but her death took place in London before the end of March. After her death, Richardson wrote to Sarah Fielding: "Don't you miss our dear Miss Jenny Collier more and more?-I do." Before she died, she planned a sequel to "The Cry", describing it as "A book called "The Laugh" on the same plan as "The Cry"". Richardson urged Fielding to revise "The Cry" just two years later.
Style.
Collier's "The Art of Ingeniously Tormenting" has been described as the "best-known generic satire written in the eighteenth century by a woman." She is one of the many female 18th-century authors (including Frances Burney, Sarah Fielding, Sarah Scott, and Charlotte Turner Smith) who experimented with "alternative models for relationships, for different ways of regarding others and even for ameliorating society."
As a sign of his favor for Collier's style, satiric humor, and classical learning, Henry Fielding wrote in the beginning of an edition of Horace:
This was one of the last works that Fielding would write because he left that evening on a trip to Lisbon where he died two months later.

List of I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings characters

"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings", the 1969 autobiography about the early years of African-American writer and poet Maya Angelou, features many characters, including Angelou as a child, which she has called "the Maya character". The first in a six-volume series, "Caged Bird" is a coming-of-age story that illustrates how strength of character and a love of literature can help overcome racism and trauma. The book begins when three-year-old Maya and her older brother are sent to Stamps, Arkansas, to live with their grandmother and ends when Maya becomes a mother at the age of 16. In the course of "Caged Bird", Maya transforms from a victim of racism into a self-possessed, dignified young woman capable of responding to prejudice.
"Caged Bird" has been categorized as an autobiography, but Angelou utilizes fiction-writing techniques such as dialogue, thematic development, and characterization. She uses the first-person narrative voice customary with autobiographies, but also includes fiction-like elements, told from the perspective of a child that is "artfully recreated by an adult narrator". She uses two distinct voices, the adult writer and the child who is the focus of the book, whom Angelou calls "the Maya character". Angelou reports that maintaining the distinction between herself and "the Maya character" is "damned difficult", but "very necessary". Scholar Liliane Arensberg suggests that Angelou "retaliates for the tongue-tied child's helpless pain" by using her adult's irony and wit. Angelou recognizes that there are fictional aspects to her books – she tends to "diverge from the conventional notion of autobiography as truth". In a 1998 interview with journalist George Plimpton, Angelou discussed "the sometimes slippery notion of truth in nonfiction" and memoirs, stating, "Sometimes I make a diameter from a composite of three or four people, because the essence in only one person is not sufficiently strong to be written about."
Primary characters.
Marguerite Johnson ("Maya").
The main character, "an unlikely heroine", from whose perspective the story is told. She has been described as "a symbolic character for every black girl growing up in America". The book covers most of her childhood, from the age of three, when she and her older brother Bailey are sent to their grandmother in Stamps, Arkansas, until she was sixteen, when she gives birth to her son Clyde. Through the character of Maya, Angelou uses her own childhood to demonstrate how she was able to survive as a black child in a white-dominated world. Maya is resilient, highly intelligent and loves literature. She goes from feeling shame about her race and appearance to feeling pride, in spite of experiences of racism and trauma. She is raped at the age of eight by her mother's boyfriend and responds by choosing not to speak for five years. She is brought out of her muteness by Mrs. Bertha Flowers, who introduces her to great literature.
Annie Henderson ("Momma").
Maya and Bailey's paternal grandmother, "a church-going, God-fearing woman whose store is the heart of black socializing in Stamps". She is the most important influence in Maya's life. Momma deals with racism by submitting to it without a struggle and by developing "a strategy of obedience", believing that to do any differently would be unsafe. Momma is tall, over six feet, and is very strong physically. She is wise, hard-working, and a good businesswoman. She is undemonstrative in her love for Maya but "uncompromising in that love". As Angelou writes, "A deep-brooding love hung over everything she touched".
Bailey Johnson, Jr..
Maya's brother, Bailey is a year older than she is. He has the most influence on Maya's childhood. "He is bright, clever, and good-spirited". He was often her strongest supporter and ally. Maya measures others by her small-framed brother, who was her hero and "Kingdom Come". Reviewer John McWhorter calls Bailey Maya's "intense little James Baldwin stand-in of a brother". Maya and Bailey have an intense bond, and enjoy their private world of jokes. She is strengthened by his love and support; he is the only one able to comfort her after her rape, and becomes her voice when they return to Stamps. When he witnesses the murder of a black man by a group of white men, he is confused and unable to understand their hatred.
Uncle Willie.
Maya and Bailey's uncle and Annie Henderson's son, he was crippled at the age of three when a babysitter dropped him. He walks with a cane. Early in "Caged Bird", Momma hides him in a bin of potatoes and onions to avoid being detected by the Ku Klux Klan. He helps Momma run her store and shows Maya kindness to the point that she wishes that he could be her father. He is just as strict as Momma, however, beating Maya and Bailey after they disrupt a church service and threatening to burn her on a potbelly stove for not learning her multiplication tables.
Vivian Baxter Johnson ("Mother Dear").
Maya and Bailey's "glamorous if feckless mother". Maya is in awe of her beauty: she is "too beautiful to have children". Vivian captivates both her children with her worldliness and euphoria, especially Bailey. Maya is emotionally separated from her mother. Angelou stated later in her he choked on a hotdog and tripped on a pickle life that she recognized that her mother had abandoned her and her brother, which meant that Vivian was "a terrible parent of young children". Vivian is concerned about providing for her children, but negligent towards them. When Maya becomes pregnant at the end of the book, Vivian accepts Maya and her child; it is the birth of her grandson that causes a connection between mother and daughter.
Bailey Johnson, Sr..
Maya and Bailey's "no-account daddy". He is tall and handsome, with a "smile as slick as brilliantine". He attempts to portray importance, but speaks in a halting manner. He is insensitive towards his children. As Lupton states, "He represents the absent father, the man who is not there for his children, literally and figuratively". Bailey Sr. "has respect for neither morals nor money", but Maya is fascinated by his "ironic pretentiousness". He appears twice in "Caged Bird", when he shows up in Stamps to drive his children to St. Louis, and when Maya visits him for a summer in San Diego.
Mr. Freeman.
Vivian Baxter's boyfriend, he lives with Vivian and her family in St. Louis when Maya and Bailey are sent there to be with their mother. At first, he is a father substitute for Maya, who is hungry to be accepted by a male. He takes advantage of this by raping her, when she is eight years old, and then threatens to kill Bailey if she told anyone about it. Bailey encourages Maya to disclose what has happened, and Mr. Freeman goes to trial. He is found murdered, probably by Maya's uncles. Maya is so devastated and traumatized, she chooses to not speak for five years.
Mrs. Bertha Flowers.
The "aristocrat of Stamps" and the town's "black intellectual", Mrs. Flowers is a "self-supporting, independent, graceful" Black woman. She is the first person to treat Maya as an individual, and teaches her about the relationship between Blacks and the larger society, as well as "the beauty and power of language". She gently nurses Maya out of her mutism by reading to her and by loaning her books that inspire Maya to speak again.
Minor characters.
There are a number of minor characters in "Caged Bird", members of the Black and white community in Stamps that fill out Maya's world and inform her influences and early experiences. Among the most notable are:
Sister Monroe.
A member of the Black church in Stamps. She is not always able to come to services, but when she does, she shouts as loud as possible to make up for her absences. Many humorous church-related anecdotes focus on her and her behavior.
Reverend Thomas.
A "repulsive church official" who visits Stamps four times a year. Maya and Bailey despise him because he is obese and never remembers their names, and because he eats the best chicken pieces at Sunday dinner. One Sunday, Sister Monroe is so inspired by his preaching that she hits him over the head with her purse; his teeth fall out and onto the floor near Maya, which results in Maya and Bailey's uncontrollable laughter and subsequent beating by Uncle Willie.
Mr. McElroy.
Momma's neighbor, and the only black man Maya has seen whose trousers match his jackets. She and Bailey admire him because he does not go to church, which makes him "courageous".
"Powhitetrash" girls.
Three white rural girls who attempt to humiliate and intimidate Momma in front of her store when they taunt and expose themselves to her. Momma reacts by passively humming a spiritual, while Maya, watching from inside the store, weeps with shame and humiliation.
Dentist Lincoln.
A white dentist who refuses to treat Maya's tooth pain, in spite of his debt to Momma, incurred during the Great Depression. He states that he would rather put his "hand in a dog's mouth than in a nigger's". Momma reacts to this with passivity, while Maya is horrified and dreams up an elaborate fantasy about Momma threatening the racist dentist.
Mrs. Viola Cullinan.
Maya's employer when she is ten years old. She insists upon calling her "Mary" or "Margaret". Maya is unable to tolerate this because "whites called black people too many other names", so Maya deliberately tries to get fired. She finally succeeds by breaking Mrs. Cullinan's prized china.
Mr. Donleavy.
A white man, he is the guest speaker at Maya's eighth grade graduation. He puts a pall over the ceremony and crushes the educational dreams of the audience by insinuating that black students are only capable of becoming athletes.
Henry Reed.
The valedictorian of Maya's eighth grade class. He makes up for Mr. Donleavy's discouragement by leading the audience in "Lift Ev'ry Voice and Sing", the "Negro national anthem".
Miss Kirwin.
Maya's teacher at George Washington High School in San Francisco. "A rare educator", she is white but shows no favoritism to her students based upon their race. Angelou states that she is "the only teacher I remembered", and probably the only white person who befriended her.
Baxter Family.
When Maya and Bailey are sent to live with her mother when they are eight and nine, they stay with her family in St. Louis. Grandmother Baxter, Vivian's mother, is a neighborhood precinct leader of German/black descent who has connections with the local police. Tutti, Tom, and Ira are Vivian's brothers; they allegedly murder Mr. Freeman after he rapes Maya.
Dolores.
Bailey Sr.'s girlfriend, who becomes jealous of Maya. After a violent argument, Maya runs away from her father's home and is homeless for a short while.

Indestructible (Disturbed song)

"Indestructible" is a song by American heavy metal band Disturbed. The song is released as the third single from the band's fourth studio album "Indestructible". The single peaked at number-two on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and number-ten on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart. The music video for the song appeared on Disturbed's website on August 20, 2008, and the single was released on September 29, 2008. The song is meant to encourage troops going into battle, and boost their morale. It is also meant to represent Disturbed's success in the music industry.
Interpretation.
"Indestructible" is "an anthem for soldiers", vocalist David Draiman comments. "It's meant to be something that would make them feel invincible, take away their fear, make them strong." According to Draiman, the song also signifies Disturbed's lingering presence and success in the music industry. Draiman comments that the song "kind of symbolizes the fact that we're still fucking here, that we haven't been destroyed, that we withstood the test of time." Guitarist Dan Donegan furthers this point, stating "We feel that we've become indestructible to be able to survive this long in the business, and continuing a success with it." Draiman concludes, "We have been through a lot. No matter what gets thrown at us, as a band, no matter what happens in the musical environment, we're still here, we're still viable, and still standing."
Music video.
A music video went into production in June 2008 with Noble Jones as the director, and was unveiled on August 20, 2008. It features high-concept battle scenes, reminiscent of the films "300" and "10,000 BC", intercut with footage of the band performing the song. The video shows the progression of war throughout history; from basic fighting with spears, to using modern weaponry such as firearms. The video is unique in that it does break tradition from past historical depictions of armed combat that have, until a few years ago, always shown combatants to be exclusively male by featuring a closing scene of an armed female soldier-warrior, presumably American, charging headlong towards the threat to her fellow soldiers, her "brothers-in-arms".

Erastus Brainerd

Erastus Brainerd (25 February 1855 – 25 December 1922) was an American journalist and art museum curator. During the Yukon Gold Rush, he was the publicist who "sold the idea that Seattle was the Gateway to Alaska and the "only" such portal".
Born in Middletown, Connecticut to Norman and Leora (Campbell), Brainerd attended Phillips Exeter Academy and Harvard University, from which he graduated at the age of 19. He served as curator of engravings at the Boston Museum of Arts, then traveled to Europe, where he promoted a tour for "lecturing showman" W. Irving Bishop. He was a social success in Europe, and became a Knight of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, a Knight of the Red Cross of Rome, a Knight Templar, and a Freemason.
Back in America, he wrote editorials for the "New York World", where he also became assistant night editor, then served as associate editor at the "Atlanta Constitution" and "Philadelphia Press". As in Europe, he continued to be a gregarious joiner, becoming a member of the Union League, Penn Club, the Authors Club of New York and the Press Club of New York and numerous others. During his stay in Atlanta he went to Richmond, Virginia to marry Mary Bella Beale, Jefferson Davis's granddaughter, on 31 May 1882. Their first child, Mary Beale, was born the following year but died several months later. They named their second child Mary Beale too when she was born in 1886; Elizabeth came in 1888.
In July 1890, after recovering from three severe bouts of influenza, he headed west to become editor of the "Seattle Press" and the "Press-Times", a role he held until September 1893. He left to focus on the office of State Land Commissioner, to which he had been appointed March 15, 1893. He joined the Rainier Club and organized a local Harvard Club. In 1897, as secretary and executive officer of the newly founded Bureau of Information of the Seattle Chamber of Commerce, he became the most prominent figure in the publicity campaign that established Seattle's preeminence as a mercantile and outfitting center for the miners headed to the Yukon. He also convinced the federal government to open an assay office in Seattle. He briefly and unsuccessfully attempted to make a living as a "mining consultant" before becoming editor of the "Seattle Post-Intelligencer". He was not a great success in that capacity: the "P-I" under his leadership was a definite second to the "Times".
In the 1910s, he led the Anti-Prohibition Association of Washington in its unsuccessful fight to keep alcoholic beverages legal in Washington; Washington "went dry" at the beginning of January 1916. Brainerd died in Tacoma, Washington in 1922.

History.
Mengjin began its life as an ancient ferry crossing for the Yellow River. According to legend, King Wu of Zhou crossed the Yellow River at this location, after forming an alliance (盟/méng/alliance + 津/jīn/ferry crossing) with the other nobles. One theory goes that the original name was actually 盟津 (literally: the ferry crossing of the alliance) rather than 孟津 (盟 and 孟 are both rendered as Meng). According to this theory, it was only in later times that the character 盟 was mistakenly replaced by 孟. The ferry crossing was an important strategic location during times of war.
In , Cao Cao explains that part of his strategy in engaging Dong Zhuo's forces was for Yuan Shao's forces to take control of Mengjin (see: Battle of Xingyang).

<doc id="18405083" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18405083" title="Betfair Pty Limited v Western Australia">
Betfair Pty Limited v Western Australia

Betfair Pty Limited v Western Australia (2008) 234 CLR 418; 244 ALR 32; [2008 HCA 11] determined whether a series of amendments made by the Western Australian government to prohibit the operation of betting exchanges amounted to discriminatory burdens of a protectionist kind.
Background.
The first plaintiff, Betfair Pty Ltd, operated a national betting exchange licensed in Tasmania and operated legally under Tasmanian law. Betfair’s exchange operated similarly to that of typical betting exchanges: Betfair would match the wagers of ‘registered players’ betting on opposing outcomes of sporting events either by telephone or through an online exchange, and then take a commission of the winner’s payout. 
The amended Act placed three restrictions on the plaintiffs. Firstly, under the newly inserted s 27B(1) it would be illegal for Betfair, the first plaintiff (the ‘out-of-state supply’ ), to operate a betting exchange in Western Australia. Secondly, under the newly inserted s 24(1)aa of the Act, it would be illegal for residents of Western Australia, such as Mr. Erceg, the second plaintiff (the ‘in-state demand’ ), to place a wager through a betting exchange. Furthermore, under the newly inserted ss 27C and 27D of the Act, it would be also illegal to publish the race fields of Western Australian races without ministerial approval. 
These new provisions of the Betting Control Act 1954 (WA) effectively prevented Betfair from participating in the Western Australian ‘wagering market’, a market dominated by Western Australian bookmakers and totalisators. Betfair argued that these amendments, namely ss 24(1aa) and 27D were invalid under s 92 of Constitution, as the amendments imposed ‘discriminatory burdens of a protectionist kind’. Section 24(1aa) prevented Betfair from competing for telephone and online gamblers. Betfair was the only betting operator out of 115 which did not receive ministerial approval under Section 27D, and was therefore prevented from publishing the fields of Western Australian races. 
The defendants submitted that these provisions, although discriminatory, were not used for the purpose of protectionism but rather for legitimate non-protectionist purposes. In addition to threatening an industry where Betfair made no contribution, the introduction of a betting exchange, where it was possible to ‘back to lose’, presented a risk that users may attempt to influence the outcome of a race and threaten the integrity of the racing industry.
Decision.
The High Court held unanimously that the Western Australian government did indeed establish discriminatory burdens of a protectionist kind, and declared the amendments invalid under Section 92 of the Constitution of Australia.

Hill was born in Melbourne, Australia. He studied at the University of Melbourne gaining his Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Education (B Ed) and a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) and from there went to London where he gained his Master of Arts (MA) degree from the University of London. 
Hill has worked in both Melbourne and London. In London he worked for the "Times Literary Supplement". Since 1975 Hill has been a full-time writer and is currently Poetry Editor of "The Australian" newspaper.
Hill is married to Rose Bygrave, a member of the "Goanna".
Stage.
He was part of the cast in the first public performance of Kenneth G. Ross's important Australian play "Breaker Morant: A Play in Two Acts", presented by the Melbourne Theatre Company at the Athenaeum Theatre, in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, on 2 February 1978.
Performance works.
Hill has produced performance works for radio, including "Desert Canticles" that premiered on ABC Radio on 5 February 2001. Hill is quoted as saying the piece was inspired by the following:
""Desert Canticles arises out of a marriage, a decade of travelling, and some years writing the literary biography of T.G.H. Strehlow out of Central Australia. I was writing my own poems out of love and the landscape, while trying to fathom Strehlow's great achievement in "Songs of Central Australia". So the notion of translation as a metaphor for relationship - with place, with others, and with songs of different cultures (Hebraic, Buddhist, and Aboriginal) became a natural one upon which to thread a radio work.""

Pollo Del Mar

Pollo Del Mar or Pollo DelMar (aka Paul E. Pratt), alternately known as "The Notorious P.D.M." or "The Glamazon," is a San Francisco-based American drag queen performer, personality, emcee, magazine cover girl, journalist and recording artist. As columnist, blogger and celebrity interviewer, Del Mar contributes to a wide-array of print and online media outlets, both gay and straight. She was the final Miss Trannyshack and is now considered "The Queen of San Francisco Media." To date, Del Mar has released three dance music singles "How Embarrassing" (2012), "Made You Look" (2013) with Billboard charting artist Kwanza Jones and "#WhiteLadyProblems" (2014).
With her celebrity interviews frequently featured on the cover of Northern California’s preeminent LGBT entertainment and lifestyles publication "GLOSS Magazine", her weekly column “The Glamazon Diaries” in "The San Francisco Bay Times" newspaper and ongoing “Promosexual” blog on the alternative weekly San Francisco Bay Guardian website, Del Mar is arguably the Bay Area’s most widely read drag personality. Her work also appears consistently on Gay.com and, less frequently, in California-based publications such as "JustUsBoys" and the Spanish-language "Adelante".
More recently, Del Mar has parlayed celebrity interviews into performances with several of those same acts. She made an uncredited cameo on a 2008 episode of Vh1 celebreality series "The Cho Show", dancing onstage with comedian Margaret Cho at Trannyshack. On Nov. 22, 2008, Del Mar and five other drag performers opened the inaugural YouTube Live Concert event with international recording artist Katy Perry, who performed her chart-topping single "Hot n Cold" for a global audience of millions. On Dec. 6, 2008, she performed with Grammy-winning singer Cyndi Lauper at the Energy 92.7 Anniversary Party. Del Mar appears in two independent feature films, "The Rise and Fall of Jeremy Starr" and "Devious, Inc."
Del Mar made her first drag appearance April 27, 2006 at a fundraiser in San Francisco’s Castro District. That same night she received her first paid booking at The Monster Show with Cookie Dough. In August of that year, she placed first runner-up to winner Mercedez Munro in the 2006 Miss Gay San Francisco Pageant and gained further attention as “Miss October” in the award-winning 2007 "Desperate Divas" calendar and a subsequent series of post cards. Featuring pictures by acclaimed San Francisco photographer Kingmond Young, the projects helped raise more than $25,000 for AIDS Housing Alliance/San Francisco.
Del Mar gained attention for her political efforts in the wake of California passing Prop.8, which would effectively ban gay marriage.
Miss Trannyshack 2007.
On November 17, 2007, at the San Francisco Gift Center, Del Mar was crowned “Miss Trannyshack 2007” in front of the largest audience in the pageant’s 12-year history. Del Mar is in fact the only Miss Trannyshack to ever simultaneously hold the Miss Trannyshack and Miss Trannyshack Star Search titles. Selecting her from the eight contestants was a panel of celebrity judges including comedian Sandra Bernhard, New York City club kid-turned-author James St. James, drag personality and Midnight Mass producer Peaches Christ, KNRG “Energy 92.7 FM” morning show hosts Fernando and Greg in the Morning, the men of Hothouse Videos and “Miss Trannyshack 2004” Anna Conda.
Entering the pageant as the reigning “Miss Trannyshack Star Search 2007,” determined annually since 1998 in contests between Trannyshack newcomers, Del Mar became the only performer to ever hold both of the legendary nightclub’s drag titles.
"GLOSS Magazine", for which she has worked as a celebrity columnist since November 2006, honored her victory by placing Del Mar on the cover of the March 7, 2008 issue. New York City celebrity photographer Bradford Noble and San Francisco-based photojournalist Steven Underhill provided images for the feature.
As of Nov. 18, 2008, with no 2008 pageant scheduled, Del Mar became the longest-reigning Miss Trannyshack in the title's 12-year history.

Dennis Espino

Dennis Espino (born December 20, 1973 in Angeles City, Pampanga, Philippines) is a former Filipino professional basketball player in the Philippine Basketball Association. He was drafted first overall by Sta. Lucia in 1995.
Player Profile.
Espino, a 6-foot-6 banger who loves to play physically, is a cornerstone of the Sta. Lucia franchise. Being a Realtor since his rookie year, he has helped the team win two PBA championships. After playing under the shadows of Jun Limpot for seven years, Dennis Espino became the heart-and-soul of Sta. Lucia when his celebrated teammate was sent to Ginebra via a trade with Marlou Aquino in 2000. The former UAAP MVP showed signs that he is capable of the responsibility after braving the role as the team's go-to-guy. In 2009, after playing 14 years with the team, Sta. Lucia traded him to the Coca-Cola Tigers. In 2011, Powerade Tigers traded him to Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters
He also played for the Philippine Centennial Team in 1998.
Arrest.
Police have arrested former PBA star and national team player Dennis Espino in Arayat, Pampanga. Espino is accused of serious illegal detention and possession of firearms. The charges arrest stemmed from a complaint by his former secretary, Mildred Eiman, who accused the player of locking her up for over a month for her failure to pay a debt amounting to P5,000.
Espino eluded arrest for more than eight months, which according to the police was due to his political connections in Pampanga.
Coaching career.
AFTER a long and controversial absence, former PBA star Dennis Espino said he is happy to be back in a sport that made him a household name.
The top pick overall of the 1995 PBA rookie draft showed up at the D-League games as one of the assistant coaches of expansion team Derulo Accelero, three years since playing his last game in the pro league where he was among its biggest stars for close to two decades.
During that absence, the 6-5 former national team standout from Angeles City became a fugitive of the law and also spent time in jail for a serious illegal detention case filed by a former secretary in a piggery he put up in Mexico, Pampanga.
The 15-year veteran declined to talk about the case that led to his disappearance from the cage scene, but said he was happy to be once again involved in a sport where he first made a name as the star of the multi-titled University of Santo Tomas teams in the nineties.

Yidispolitics Scandal

Yidispolitics is the name given to the continuing public scandal in Colombia, since April 2008, when the ex-politician Yidis Medina admitted to receiving of bribes to vote in favor of the re-election project, which changed the constitution, on allowed Álvaro Uribe Vélez to become president for a second term.
The politicians implicated in Yidispolitics have rejected the accusations. Even the former president of Colombia, Álvaro Uribe Vélez, has been accused of bribery. Velez argued against these accusations saying: ""The national government persuades; but does not push or bribe consciences"" .
On June 25 of 2008, after several days of investigation, the Supreme Court of Colombia found Yidis Medin guilty of bribery and sentenced her to 47 months of house arrest. Included in the same case, the Court claimed that it will send the information to different Judicial bodies that eventually, would have to punish the public servers involved in the scandal. It also asked the Constitutional Court of Colombia to review the constitutional reform that allowed Álvaro Uribe Vélez to stand for his second consecutive presidential election. This case caused Álvaro Uribe Vélez to strongly react against the Supreme Court, and he suggested links between the magistrates of the Court and groups of extreme left-wing and right-wing tendency. He also suggested the passing of a constitutional referendum to legitimate his presidential re-election. The day after Álvaro Uribe Vélez's speech, those involved sued the judges of the Supreme Court.
The politicians involved in this case are currently being investigated. Among them are: Diego Palacio Betancourt Social Welfare Minister, and Sabas Pretelt De La Vega Colombian ambassador in Italy, who was the Interior and Justice Minister during the passing of the re-election project, that eventually changed the constitution. (ver:señalados por Medina)
Background.
Álvaro Uribe Vélez was re-elected as Colombian President for the period of 2006 - 2010, after pushing towards a reform of the Constitution to allow his consecutive re-election. The approbation of the reform was a controversial decision, due to the last minute change of mind of the representatives Yidis Medina and Teodolindo Avendaño; Medina voted in favor of the reform after assuring she was against it, and Avendaño was absent during the approbation. There was a lot of speculation about the controversial reform, until April 2008 when Yidis Medina declared herself guilty of bribe, when she assured to a Colombian magazine "El Espectador" that the government did not fulfill the deal, and that she was about to write a book with all the information about the case with the help of Teodolindo Avendaño.
The scandal.
On April 20, 2008, several days after "El Espectador" interview, TV news show Noticias Uno broadcast a video where ex Congresswoman Yidis Medina admits before Daniel Coronell, the TV news director, to have accepted bribes from President Álvaro Uribe himself and from some of his closest collaborators, including Sabas Pretelt (back then, the Interior & Justice Minister) to change her vote in the First Commission of the Representatives' Chamber in the law project applied by the Government to allow the immediate presidential re-election that would give Uribe a chance to aspire to a second term of office. This video was recorded on August 2004 but the journalist and the then congress woman agreed that it wouldn't be exposed until something unexpected happened to her (she stated to had been death threatened). Medina said that the video could also be exposed in case she didn't receive what was agreed with the Government.
Weeks before the video's broadcasting, Medina had revealed its existence in an interview with "El Espectador" newspaper. Because of this, Coronell stated that Medina had broken the deal and so he told her. She admitted so and the journalist announced its publication.
Both President Uribe and his staff members denied Medina's accusations. Uribe said that he had a meeting with her but never had offered her or any other member of the parliament anything 
for his/her vote. In addition, he accused Medina of having been blackmailing his son Tomás Uribe and other high government employees by phone calls, using a list from cell-phone company Comcel as a proof, with several in-coming phone calls from Medina's number to Tomás Uribe's cell-phone. Though Medina declared it wasn't her phone number, some days later it was proved wrong in an official statement by Medina's attorney. Uribe said Medina was behaving as a criminal and declared: ""Her vote helped, but she shows up now as a failed, unsatisfied lady because she couldn't pull out her extortion"". Besides, he referred to his collaborators Pretelt and Palacio Betancourt as honest people with impeccable behaviour, and accused journalist Daniel Coronell of having covered up the false crime.

History.
Officially sanctioned by the Bureau of International Expositions, twenty-five countries officially participated and a further five were unofficially represented. The theme was colonization, on the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the Congo Free State. 
The fair attracted some twenty million visitors. Belgian architect Joseph Van Neck was the principal architect of the fair and of the Art Deco "Palais des Expositions" (also known as the "Grand Palais"), with its interior concrete parabolic arches, and four heroic bronze statues on piers. 
Among many other contributors, Le Corbusier designed part of the French exhibit; the Belgian modernist architect, Victor Bourgeois, designed the "Grand Palace", the Leopold II Restaurant and the Soprocol Pavilion. The Belgian art exposition prominently displayed the work of contemporary Belgian artists, including Paul Delvaux and René Magritte, boosting their careers. 
The "Palais des Expositions", and at least three other of the 1935 structures, were re-used for Expo '58 which was held at the same site in 1958.

Gorman dogfight

The Gorman UFO dogfight was a widely publicized UFO incident. It occurred on October 1, 1948, in the skies over Fargo, North Dakota, and involved George F. Gorman, a pilot with the North Dakota National Guard. In 1956, USAF Captain Edward J. Ruppelt wrote in his bestselling and influential "The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects" that the Gorman Dogfight was one of three "classic" UFO incidents in 1948 that "proved to Force intelligence specialists that UFO's were real." However, in 1949 the US Air Force labeled the Gorman Dogfight as being caused by a lighted weather balloon.
Background.
Although he was only 25 years old when the incident occurred, George Gorman was a veteran fighter pilot of the Second World War. After the war he became the manager of a construction company; he also served as a second lieutenant in the North Dakota National Guard. On October 1, 1948, he was participating in a cross-country flight with other National Guard pilots; he was flying a P-51 Mustang. His flight arrived over Fargo at approximately 8:30 PM. Although the other pilots decided to land at Fargo's Hector Airport, because of the clear, cloudless conditions, Gorman decided to get in some night-flying time and stayed aloft. Around 9:00 PM he flew over a football stadium where a high-school football game was being held. He noticed a small Piper Cub plane flying some 500 feet below him; otherwise the skies appeared clear.
Shortly after he noticed the Piper Cub, Gorman saw another object to his west. When he looked for the outline of a wing or fuselage he could see none; this contrasted with the Piper Cub, whose outline was clearly visible. The object appeared to be a blinking light. At 9:07 PM Gorman contacted the control tower at Fargo's Hector Airport and asked if it had any air traffic in the area other than his P-51 and the Piper Cub. The tower answered that it did not, and it contacted the Piper Cub pilot, Dr. A.D. Cannon. Cannon and his passenger answered that they could also see a lighted object to the west.
Dogfight.
Gorman told the tower that he was going to pursue the object to determine its identity. He moved his Mustang to full power (350 to 400 MPH), but soon realized that the object was going too fast for him to catch it in a straight run. Instead, he tried cutting the object off by turns. He made a right turn and approached the object head-on at 5,000 feet; the object flew over his plane at a distance of about 500 feet. Gorman described the object as a simple "ball of light" about six to eight inches in diameter. He also noted later that when the object increased its speed, it stopped blinking and grew brighter.
After his near-collision, Gorman lost sight of the object; when he saw it again it appeared to have made a 180-degree turn and was coming at him again. The object then made a sudden vertical climb; Gorman followed the object in his own steep climb. At 14,000 feet his P-51 stalled; the object was still 2,000 feet above him. Gorman made two further attempts to get closer to the object, with no success. It seemed to make another head-on pass, but broke off before coming close to his fighter. By this point the object had moved over the Fargo Airport, in the control tower the air traffic controller, L.D. Jensen, viewed the object through binoculars but could see no form or shape around the light. He was joined by Cannon and his passenger from the Piper Cub; they had landed and walked to the control tower to get a better view of the object. 
Gorman continued to follow the object until he was approximately 25 miles southwest of Fargo. At 14,000 feet he observed the light at 11,000 feet; he then dived on the object at full power. However, the object made a vertical climb. Gorman tried to pursue but watched as the object passed out of visual range. At this point he broke off the chase; it was 9:27 PM. He flew back to Fargo's Hector Airport.
Gorman's account.
On October 23, 1948, Gorman gave a sworn account of the incident to investigators. His statement was often reprinted in future years in numerous books and documentaries about UFOs. The statement read: 
I am convinced that there was definite thought behind its maneuvers. I am further convinced that the object was governed by the laws of inertia because its acceleration was rapid but not immediate and although it was able to turn fairly tight at considerable speed, it still followed a natural curve. When I attempted to turn with the object I blacked out temporarily due to excessive speed. I am in fairly good physical condition and I do not believe that there are many if any pilots who could withstand the turn and speed effected by the object, and remain conscious. The object was not only able to out turn and out speed my aircraft...but was able to attain a far steeper climb and was able to maintain a constant rate of climb far in excess of my aircraft.
Air Force investigation.
Within a few hours, military officers from Project Sign arrived to question Gorman and the other witnesses. Project Sign had been created by the US Air Force in late 1947 to investigate UFO reports. The officers interviewed Gorman, Dr. Cannon and his passenger, and the control tower personnel at Fargo's Airport. The officers also checked Gorman's P-51 Mustang with a geiger counter for radiation. They found that his Mustang was measurably more radioactive than other fighters which had not flown for several days; this was taken as evidence that Gorman had flown close to an "atomic-powered" object. The Air Force investigators also ruled out the possibility of the lighted object being "another aircraft, Canadian Vampire jet fighters, or a weather balloon." Their initial conclusion, writes UFO historian Curtis Peebles, was "that something remarkable had occurred" to Gorman in the skies above Fargo. 
However, further investigation by Project Sign personnel soon revealed flaws in the evidence. A plane flying high in the Earth's atmosphere is less shielded from radiation than one at ground level, thus the geiger-counter readings were considered invalid evidence for stating that the lighted object was atomic-powered. In addition, the Air Weather Service revealed that on October 1 it had released a lighted weather balloon from Fargo at 8:50 PM. By 9 PM the balloon would have been in the area where Gorman and the Piper Cub passengers first saw the lighted object. Project Sign's investigators also believed that the incredible movements of the object were due to Gorman's own maneuvers as he chased the light - the object's maneuvers were an illusion brought about by the movements of Gorman's fighter. The Project Sign personnel also noted that none of the witnesses in the Fargo Airport control tower reported the remarkable maneuvers described by Gorman. The investigators also believed that, as the weather balloon passed out of sight, Gorman had come to believe that the planet Jupiter was the UFO, and had been chasing the planet as he flew south of Fargo before giving up and returning to land. By early 1949 the Gorman case was labeled by Project Sign and its successors - Project Grudge and Project Blue Book - as being caused by a lighted weather balloon.
Aftermath.
The Gorman Dogfight received wide national publicity and helped fuel the wave of UFO reports in the late forties. Although some UFO researchers, such as Dr. James E. McDonald, a physicist at the University of Arizona, and retired US Marine Corps Major Donald Keyhoe, disagreed with the Air Force's conclusions and continued to regard the case as unsolved, other UFO researchers agreed with Project Sign's conclusions in the case. As UFO historian Jerome Clark writes, "unlike some Air Force would-be solutions this one seems plausible" and that, in his opinion, "After the Mantell Incident the Gorman sighting may be the most overrated UFO report in the early history of the phenomenon."

He attended the Signal School at Fort Monmouth from 1923 to 1924 and then became regimental communications officer of 3rd Cavalry at Fort Myer. In 1925 he was promoted to First Lieutenant.
In March 1926, Byers became an instructor in tactics at the United States Military Academy. He was Assistant Master of the Sword and then master of the sword until 1930. He was a Student Officer at the Special Advanced Equitation Course at United States Army Cavalry School from 1930 to 1931 and then served with the 8th Cavalry Regiment at Fort Bliss from 1931 to 1932. After this, Byers returned to West Point as a tactics instructor, and then as Assistant Adjutant from 1932 to 1934.
From 1934 to 1936 Byers attended the Command and General Staff College, where he was finally promoted to Captain on 1 August 1935. On completing the course, he was assigned to the staff of the 2nd Division at Fort Sam Houston. In October 1936, he became Aide-de-Camp to Major General Herbert J. Brees, commander of the VIII Corps area. Byers then joined the 5th Cavalry at Fort Bliss, where he commanded Troop A from 1937 to 1938 and the 1st Squadron from 1938 to 1939.
He married Marie Richards of Columbus, Ohio. They had one son, Clayton Potter Byers, who was born on 23 June 1940.
World War II.
Byers spent for months visiting military schools in England, France, and Germany prior to attending the U.S. Army War College from September 1939 to June 1940. He was promoted to major on 1 July 1940. On graduation he was assigned to the G-1 (Personnel) Division, War Department General Staff at a time when the workload of this division was particularly heavy owing to the vast expansion of the Army. He was promoted to wartime rank Lieutenant Colonel on 11 December 1941 and Colonel on 1 February 1942.
In February 1942, Byers became Chief of Staff of Major General Robert L. Eichelberger's newly reactivated 77th Infantry Division at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. Byers would form a close working relationship with Eichelberger, who had also attended Ohio State where he too had been a member of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity.
Byers, along with a number of other staff members from the 77th Infantry Division, followed Eichelberger when the latter became commander of I Corps in June 1942.
The I Corps headquarters staff moved to Brisbane by air in August 1942, travelling on the same aircraft as former United States Secretary of War Patrick J. Hurley and the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Peter Fraser. The headquarters soon moved to Rockhampton, Queensland, where it supervised the training of American troops in Queensland. Byers was promoted to temporary Brigadier General on 31 October 1942.
Papuan campaign.
When the Battle of Buna-Gona started going badly, General Douglas MacArthur, the Supreme Commander, South West Pacific Area, decided to send I Corps headquarters to the front in Papua. Eichelberger recalled Macarthur's instructions:
In accordance with MacArthur's orders, Eichelberger relieved the 32nd Infantry Division's commander, Major General Edwin F. Harding, replacing him with the division's artillery commander, Brigadier General Albert W. Waldron, on 2 December 1942. In an attack on 5 December, Waldron was shot in the shoulder by a Japanese sniper, and Byers succeeded him as commander of the troops in the field. Byers in turn was wounded on 16 December. He became the third American general to be shot at Buna, Brigadier General Hanford MacNider having been shot earlier in the fighting, none of whom was more than 75 metres from Japanese lines at the time. General Eichelberger assumed command, as he was now the only American general officer present. Waldron and Byers were awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. Byers' citation read:
For his role in the fighting in Papua, Byers also received the Purple Heart and the Silver Star. In turn, Byers recommended Eichelberger for the Medal of Honor but the nomination was disapproved by MacArthur. Byers returned to the front on 17 January 1943 as Chief of Staff of Advance New Guinea Force, now commanded by Eichelberger. The two remained until 26 January, when they returned to Australia.
New Guinea campaign.
I Corps headquarters remained at Rockhampton, Queensland in the training role until March 1944, when it moved to Goodenough Island, where it prepared and staged for Operations RECKLESS and PERSECUTION. For his part in the operation, Byers was awarded the Bronze Star. His citation read:
Byers was awarded an Oak Leaf Cluster to his Silver Star in the Battle of Biak. His citation read:
He was also awarded an Oak Leaf Cluster to his Bronze Star Medal. This citation read:
Lieutenant General Walter Krueger, commander of the Sixth Army offered to make Byers an assistant division commander. When Byers refused the offer, Krueger took this as a personal affront.
In August 1944, Eighth Army headquarters arrived in the New Guinea and Eichelberger became commander of the new army. Once again, Byers followed him as his chief of staff. For his services as Chief of Staff of I Corps, Byers was awarded the Legion of Merit: 
Philippines campaign.

John and Mary (film)

John and Mary is a 1969 American romantic drama film directed by Peter Yates. It stars Dustin Hoffman and Mia Farrow in the title roles, directly on the heels of "Rosemary's Baby" and "Midnight Cowboy", respectively (as well as "Bullitt" for Yates). The screenplay was adapted by John Mortimer from the Mervyn Jones novel. 
It was released theatrically in North America on December 14, 1969. It received an R rating upon its original release, which was later downgraded to a PG rating.
Synopsis.
"John and Mary" begins the morning after John and Mary meet in a bar, during a conversation about Jean-Luc Godard's "Week End", and go home with each other. The story unfolds during the day as they belatedly get to know each other over breakfast, lunch and dinner. Flashbacks of their previous bad relationships are interspersed throughout when something in their conversation brings the thought up. 
Critical reception.
Roger Ebert of the "Chicago Sun-Times" says, ""John and Mary" is supposed to be a contemporary movie, I guess, and yet it's curiously out of touch. John and Mary shadow box uneasily with the American language, trying to sound like all people their age without sounding too much like any particular person." John Thompson of the "Orlando Weekly" calls it "a delectable New Wave–inspired dish for thoughtful viewers tired of the same old menu." Vincent Canby of "The New York Times" concludes, "There is nothing wrong with the idea of John and Mary, just with its execution." 
Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports 3 positive and 5 negative reviews of the film.
