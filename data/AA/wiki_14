Eric Lee-Johnson

Eric Albert Lee-Johnson (1908–1993) was a prominent New Zealand artist and photographer.
Lee-Johnson was born in Suva, Fiji and moved to New Zealand in 1912 with his parents. As a child he showed an unusual gift for drawing and he entered Auckland’s Elam School of Art where he remained from 1923-1926. At 18 he joined newspaper publishers Wilson & Horton’s printing department and within a year was in charge of the studio and working a lithograph artist and illustrator. In 1930 he sailed for London, England. He spent eight years in London, from the age of 21 working as designer and typographer with the large advertising agency S.H. Benson. He studied lithography at Camberwell School of Art and Crafts and attended Charles Porter's life classes at the Central School of Art and Design in London. His work from 1931-36 was influenced by contemporary German typography, graphics and poster design in Europe
In 1938 he accepted a contract from Illott’s Advertising Agency in Wellington and returned to New Zealand. He immediately rejoined the art scene and, in 1939, he was elected a member of the New Zealand Academy of Fine Arts serving a term on the Committee of Management, National Art Gallery. His health broke down and after more than two years in Pukeora sanatorium he left the commercial world and with his wife and son went to live the simple life at Piha and become a full-time painter.
Lee-Johnson lived in various parts of New Zealand from 1942 to 1960 including Coromandel and the Hokianga, and his non-figurative abstract paintings date from this time. In the 1950s a series of his North New Zealand paintings and topographical drawings recording the architecture of some surviving early wooden buildings, set off a whole romantic movement in New Zealand art. In 1956 he became the first New Zealand painter of his generation to have a monograph published on his work. Public awareness of his painting was further increased in 1956 and 1957, when a short documentary film about his work was seen in public theatres throughout the country. Changes in the landscape, pacific images and the inclusion of found objects such as shells and stones were themes running through his work throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Lee-Johnson is represented in all major collections throughout the country, including the national art collection at the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, all public galleries and the Hocken Library and Alexander Turnbull Library. A retrospective exhibition of his paintings and drawings toured New Zealand in 1981-82.
In addition to his painting Eric Lee-Johnson was also a freelance photographer who documented the daily life of New Zealanders from the early 1950s through to the 1970s. His photographs were as widely known as his paintings - including images of Opo the Dolphin, and scenes of New Zealand life. Lee-Johnson had intended his photography to form a picture library the use of which would finance his art. The collection of tens of thousands of negatives and the copyright was purchased by the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa in 1997 - four years after his death.

Treaty of Bruges (1375)

The Treaty of Bruges was a treaty signed in 1375 between France and England in Bruges, present-day Belgium. It led to the "Truce of Bruges", a pause in the "Caroline" phase of the Hundred Years' War.
The conference leading to the treaty was called at the instigation of Pope Gregory XI. France was represented in the negotiations by Philip II, Duke of Burgundy and England by John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster. The truce agreed was initially for one year but was later extended until 1377.

<doc id="18285158" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18285158" title="Testimony in Jewish law">
Testimony in Jewish law

Testimony in Jewish law consists of testimony by eligible witnesses to a Beit Din (court) authorized to render decisions according to "halakhah" (Jewish law). Eligible witnesses must in almost all cases be free men who are not deaf, mentally or morally unsuitable, or too young for Bar Mitzvah; in particular, women are in most cases not eligible. The principles of testimony in halakhah have been applied to Mishpat Ivri (Hebrew jurisprudence).
Criteria for valid testimony.
A valid witness to an event in "halakhah" must have seen the event with his eyes or heard it with his ears. Generally hearsay from another person is inadmissible, except in rare cases such as confirming that a missing husband has died (see Agunah). A Beit Din may accept testimony only from a witness who speaks directly to the judges, not from a written deposition. A witness may not recant his testimony.
Two witnesses.
The Torah says (Deuteronomy 19:15): "One witness shall not arise against a man for any sin or guilt that he may commit; according to two witnesses or according to three witnesses a matter shall stand." Thus, two witnesses provide conclusive proof of reality, but one witness does not. (However, the testimony of one witness can require a defendant to swear to his innocence or else pay the debt alleged against him.)
In monetary law two witnesses may absolutely require someone to pay a debt or absolve them from that obligation. In capital cases two witnesses may testify that a person has committed a crime punishable by the death penalty in Jewish law, and the Sanhedrin may execute the person on their word; however capital punishment is no longer applied.
The testimony of two witnesses is equal in its force to the testimony of three or more witnesses. Thus if two witnesses say an event occurred, and one hundred witnesses say it did not occur, the groups of witnesses are considered to contradict one another, but no more weight is given to the larger group; other evidence is needed to reach a judgment. If one of the witnesses is disqualified, his entire group is disqualified, even if the other witnesses are themselves qualified and could present a valid testimony without his assistance. (Source: Makkot chapter 1.)
In monetary law examination of witnesses is less stringent than in capital law, and testimony is accepted even despite minor contradictions that may exist in the testimony of two separate witnesses. (If one witness says a defendant owes 100, and the other says the sum is 200, the judges accept that both witnesses agree to the existence of a 100 lien, even though only one witness testifies to each individual lien. Similarly, if one witness says a defendant owes 100 based on a loan granted on Monday, and another witness says the debt is 100 based on a loan granted on Thursday, the defendant is considered to owe 100 by the combined testimony of the two witnesses even though they disagree as to the source of the obligation.) In contrast, in capital cases the judges threaten the witnesses by warning of the consequences of perjury (source: Mishnah Sanhedrin chapter 4), and they ask many questions and will invalidate testimony even for minor inconsistencies, even if the contradiction seems substantively irrelevant to the case at hand. The purpose of these stringencies is to prevent the killing of an innocent defendant.
Ceremonial versus evidentiary witnesses.
In some instances two witnesses are required to perform a certain action, such as "kiddushin" (betrothal). If there are not two valid witnesses, the "kiddushin" does not take effect. These are ceremonial witnesses (Hebrew: "eidei kiyum"). Likewise, a shtar requires two witnesses, and in particular a Get (divorce document) requires two witnesses to sign the document or see the delivery.
Witnesses in monetary cases are evidentiary: even if they do not witness a robbery, the robber is still obligated to compensate the owner for damages (although there may be no way to prove this fact). Evidentiary witnesses are known in Hebrew as "eidei beirur".
Invalidation of a pair of witnesses.
A pair of witnesses may be invalidated if:
Powers of a lone witness.
A lone witness cannot give testimony in capital cases. His testimony is useless unless there is a second witness to join him. In monetary cases a lone witness has limited powers. He can require a defendant to take an oath stating that the defendant is in the right, and if the defendant refuses to take the oath he must pay instead. (In most cases, it is at the defendant's discretion whether to swear but, in rare instances, the court may require the defendant to pay without the option of swearing chapter 7.)
In the case of a classical Agunah, a woman whose husband has disappeared and it is not known whether the husband is still alive, a single witness (even a woman or slave, normally invalid as witnesses) may testify that the husband has died, and on that basis the woman may remarry.
Ineligible witnesses.
Testimony of a deaf, mentally incompetent or young person (before Bar Mitzvah) is excluded. Testimony from women is also generally excluded. Anyone who is caught guilty of a sin which demonstrates greed, i.e. who sins in order to acquire money, is also disqualified.
Tractate Sanhedrin lists other categories of witnesses who are disqualified.
The Talmud, in the third chapter of Sanhedrin, delineates the rules governing who may provide written or oral testimony. A valid witness in a Jewish Beit Din must be an adult (see Bar Mitzvah) free man, not a woman or a slave, and not be related to any of the other witnesses or judges. The witness must be an honest person who can be trusted not to lie.
The Mishnah (Sanhedrin 24b) states: "The following people are disqualified: a gambler with dice, a lender who collects interest, a chaser of doves, and a merchant who profits from produce of Shemittah." The Talmud explains that each of these four activities falls within an expanded definition of theft because people who violate Torah laws or social norms in pursuit of money cannot be trusted to tell the truth. 
Additionally, "one who eats in the street is comparable to a dog, and there are those who say that he is disqualified from serving as a witness." (Talmud, Kiddushin 40b)
Reinstatement.
However, anyone who has engaged in these forbidden activities may be reinstated upon undertaking a complete reversal to demonstrate especially honest conduct by renouncing a permitted activity.

Longest tennis match records

This article details longest tennis match records by duration or number of games.
The 1973 introduction of the tiebreak reduced the opportunity for such records to be broken. However, among the Grand Slams, only the US Open uses the tiebreak in the final set; the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon and Olympic tennis instead use the advantage set rules in the final set – in such a set there can be an indefinite number of games until there is a winner. This resulted, for example, in the record-obliterating Isner v. Mahut match at Wimbledon 2010.
Overall.
Men.
The Isner–Mahut match at the 2010 Wimbledon Championships holds the record for the longest tennis match both in time and games played. Only two official ATP matches have lasted longer than 7 hours. Seven matches have lasted longer than 6 hours and 37 matches have lasted longer than 5 hours.

List of doping cases in cycling

The following is an incomplete list of doping cases and recurring accusations of doping in professional cycling, where doping means ""use of physiological substances or abnormal method to obtain an artificial increase of performance"". It is neither a 'list of shame' nor a list of illegality, as the first laws weren't passed until 1965 and their implementation is an ongoing developing process. Thus the list contains doping incidents, those who have tested positive for illegal performance-enhancing drugs, prohibited recreational drugs or have been suspended by a sporting body for failure to submit to mandatory drug testing. It also contains and clarifies cases where subsequent evidence and explanation has shown the parties to be innocent of illegal practice.
In 1963 the Council of Europe gave a definition of doping.
"Doping means to make use of physiological substances in immoderate quantity or abnormal method from healthy people whose only aim is to obtain an artificial increase of the performance during the competition". or ...
"The administration of or use by a competing athlete of any substance foreign to the body or any physiologic substance taken in abnormal quantity or taken by an abnormal route of entry into the body with the sole intention of increasing in an artificial and unfair manner his/her performance in competition. When necessity demands medical treatment with any substance which, because of its nature, dosage, or application is able to boost the athlete's performance in competition in an artificial and unfair manner, this too is regarded as doping.".
__NOTOC__
1800s.
1886.
In 1886 a Welsh cyclist is popularly reputed to have died after drinking a blend of cocaine, caffeine and strychnine, supposedly in the Bordeaux–Paris race. This was included in the 1997 International Olympic Committee study on the "Historical Evolution of Doping Phenomenon", and listed as the presumed first death due to doping during a competition. The report did allow that in this period it was common practice, and not illegal. This is alternatively reported as trimethyl poisoning. However, the main Bordeaux–Paris race did not start until 1891, and the cyclist who supposedly died in 1886, Arthur Linton, actually finished second in 1896 and died a few weeks later, reportedly from a combination of drug induced exhaustion and typhoid fever. Linton was managed by the notorious Choppy Warburton - See 1896 below. The story may be apocryphal.
1896.
Nitroglycerine was used to stimulate the heart after cardiac attacks and was credited with improving riders' breathing. Riders suffered hallucinations from the exhaustion and perhaps the drugs. The American champion Marshall Taylor refused to continue a New York race, saying: "I cannot go on with safety, for there is a man chasing me around the ring with a knife in his hand."
1897.
Warburton was banned from the sport after unproven claims of "massive doping" in the 1896 Bordeaux–Paris. His activities may have contributed to the early deaths of Arthur Linton, Tom Linton and Jimmy Michael.
1930s.
1930.
The acceptance of drug-taking in the Tour de France was so complete by 1930 that the rule book, distributed by Henri Desgrange, reminded riders that drugs would not be provided by the organisers.
1960s.
1962.
The Wiel's-Groene Leeuw affair. At the stage from Luchon to Carcassonne of the 1962 Tour de France, twelve riders fell ill and said 'bad fish' was the cause. Tour doctor Pierre Dumas realized they had all been given the same drug by the same soigneur. Hans Junkermann of Germany had been ill overnight so the start was delayed by 10 minutes, but at the first hill he got off his bike and sat by the roadside, telling onlookers "I ate bad fish at the hotel last night." Eleven other riders abandoned the Tour that day, including the former leader, Willy Schroeders, the 1960 winner Gastone Nencini and a future leader, Karl-Heinz Kunde. Jacques Goddet wrote that he suspected doping but nothing was proven - other than that none of the hotels had served fish the previous night.
1964.
France passed its first anti-doping law in November 1964
1965.
Performance-enhancing drugs became illegal on 1 June 1965. The first riders to be caught were four amateurs, three Spanish (Luis Santamarina, Canet and Usamentiaga) and one Briton (Ken Hill), who were thrown out of the Milk Race when they tested positive for amphetamines after Professor Arnold Beckett first applied sensitive gas chromatographic techniques to monitor drug abuse.
1966.
On 29 July testing began at the Tour de France. Raymond Poulidor was the first rider to be tested in the Tour at the end of a stage to Bordeaux. He said "I was strolling down the corridor in ordinary clothes when I came across two guys who asked if I was a rider. They made me go into a room, I pissed into some bottles and they closed them without sealing them. Then they took my name, my date of birth, without asking for anything to check my identity. I could have been anyone, and they could have done anything they liked with the bottles." Next morning, on the way to the Pyrenees the riders climbed off, began walking and shouting protests.
1970s.
1974.
In 1974, an advance in testing caught 13 prominent riders including Herman van Springel.
1979.
During the 1979 Tour de France, the leader of the mountains classification Giovanni Battaglin tested positive for doping in stage 13. He was penalized by 10 minutes in the general classification, lost the points that he earned in stage 13 and received 10 penalty points in the mountains classification. Battaglin was still able to win the mountains classification.
Frans Van Looy and Gilbert Chaumaz also tested positive for doping during the Tour. After the Tour de France had finished, Joop Zoetemelk was found to have used doping, which he confessed later. Zoetemelk was penalized by 10 minutes in the general classification, but kept his second place.
1980s.
1984.
Systematic blood doping at the 1984 Summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles. The U.S. cycling team's successes were coloured by revelations that riders had blood transfusions before their events, a practice known as blood-doping. The transfusions were to increase red blood cells in riders' blood. That would take more oxygen to their muscles. They received the blood of others with similar blood types. The practice, instigated by national coach Eddie Borysewicz, was not against Olympic rules although Games medical guidelines discouraged it. Borysewicz and a colleague, Ed Burke, set up a clinic in a Los Angeles motel room and four of the seven athletes who had transfusions won medals. The U.S. federation banned blood-doping in January 1985. Borysewicz and Burke were fined a month's pay. Mike Fraysse, a former president of the federation, was demoted from first to third vice-president.
Steve Hegg, won a gold and a silver; Rebecca Twigg, Pat McDonough and Leonard Nitz won silver medals. The others were John Beckman, Mark Whitehead and Brent Emery. They were identified in the subsequent inquiry as having had transfusions. The rest of the team had refused.
1988.
The emergence of EPO - In the late 1980s a recombinant drug created for people suffering from kidney failure became a substance abused by athletes seeking enhanced stamina and performance. The drug is recombinant erythropoietin, known as EPO, which was developed by the Amgen company. Recombinant EPO is a bio-manufactured copy of a hormone normally produced in the kidney and was not detectable by any test at the time.
EPO stimulates the bone marrow in order to increase red blood cell production and thus the body's ability to carry oxygen. A study of 15 Swedish athletes by the Stockholm Institute of Gymnastics and Sports found an improvement of nearly 10 percent in aerobic performance. "Average" red blood cell volume of the population at sea level is about 45% red blood cells. About 5% of the population has less than 40% red blood cell, which is defined as "anemia" and 5% of the population, including many world class athletes, have a natural red blood cells volume of 50%... 1% of the population has 54% red blood cell volume.
The increased thickness of the blood (above 70% red blood cells) increases the risk of blood clotting which can block blood vessels causing a heart attack or stroke, especially in the middle of the night when the heart's rate is lowest. Doctors and blood specialists concluded that the drug could have been implicated in the deaths of as many as 18 European professional bicycle racers between 1987 and 1991. One of them was Johannes Draaijer, a 27-year-old Dutch rider who finished 130th in the 1989 Tour de France, and died from a heart attack in February 1990. Although the autopsy did not specify the cause of death, Draaijer's wife later told the German news magazine "Der Spiegel" that her husband became sick after using EPO.
1990s.
1990.
The PDM Affair, In November 1997, Cyclingnews.com reported about an inquiry that had just been made public in The Netherlands. This inquiry appeared to reveal doping in the PDM cycling team. The doctor of the team from between 1990 and 1991 was Wim Sanders who was the centre of the investigation which was reported to have been initiated when the General Manager of the team, Manfred Krikke, called the FIOD (Fiscal Information and Investigation Service) to investigate the medical business of the team. It was said that Wim Sanders supplied anabolic steroids and EPO to the team and was responsible for the "‘intralipid affair’" of the 1991 Tour de France, when the entire team withdrew due to what was reported at the time as food poisoning. In a 2008 TV documentary; team members and team doctor Wim Sanders explain how the cause was in fact careless storage of Intralipid, a nutritional aid with which the team members had been injected.
According to cyclingnews.com, 1990 was the height of the drug taking in the team and during this year, two riders had to stop with acute heart problems; whether this refers to stopping with professional cycling or performance enhancing drugs is unclear. Team manager Gisbers denied any knowledge of doping in the team.
1991.
PDM. Some teams used sophisticated recovery techniques whereby riders were put on a drip during the night and fed nutrients such as Vitamin B12. This practice was blamed when the entire PDM team went down with a fever on the 10th Stage of the Tour de France. PDM management blamed a virus although only riders were infected. Ten days later a press release stated that the team had used recovery substances which were past their sell-by date.
1996.
The Telekom Affair – In May 2007, several former riders admitted to using banned substances (including EPO) while riding for the team in the mid-1990s, including Erik Zabel, Rolf Aldag, Brian Holm, Bjarne Riis, Bert Dietz, Udo Bölts and Christian Henn including the seasons in which Riis and Jan Ullrich won the Tour de France. Team doctors Andreas Schmid and Lothar Heinrich also confessed to participating and administering banned substances. The latter was Team Telekom's sporting director until 3 May 2007, when he was suspended following allegations published in former team member Jef d'Hont's book.
On 25 May 2007, Riis issued a statement confessing to taking EPO, growth hormone and cortisone for five years, from 1993 to 1998, including during his victory in the 1996 Tour de France. Earlier in the week, five of Riis' former teammates from Team Telekom confessed to having used banned substances during the 1990s when Riis won the Tour. Riis said that he bought and injected the EPO himself, and team coach Walter Godefroot turned a blind eye to the drug use on the team. Riis removed from the official record books of Tour de France, but in July 2008 he is written back into the books along with additional notes about his use of doping.
1998.
The Festina Affair is the events that surround several doping scandals, doping investigations and confessions of riders to doping that occurred during and shortly after the 1998 Tour de France. The affair began when a large haul of doping products was found in a car of the Festina cycling team just before the start of the race, which led to a big-scale police investigation against the Festina Team, this was followed by the re-opening of a separate police investigation case into the TVM team, and a subsequent searching of many teams during the race for possession of illicit doping substances. The affair highlighted systematic doping and suspicion of a widespread network of doping in many teams of the Tour de France, and was characterised by the constant negative publicity of the cases, police searches of hotels, a spate of confessions by retired and current riders to doping, the detainment and arrest of many team personnel, protests by riders in the race, as well as mass withdrawal of several teams from the race.
1999.
1999 Tour de France - In 2005 the French sports daily L'Équipe accused Lance Armstrong of using the performance-enhancing drug EPO during 1999 Tour de France. For years, it had been impossible to detect the drug, called erythropoietin, until UCI began using a urine test for EPO in 2001. According to the newspaper, tests on 1999 urine samples were done to help scientists improve their detection methods. The newspaper said 12 samples had revealed EPO use, including six from Armstrong.
In 2006 a UCI appointed independent lawyer, Emile Vrijman, released a report in 2006 claiming that Lance Armstrong should be cleared of any suspicion surrounding the retrospective testing of the 1999 Tour de France. Vrijman denounced the manner in which the doping laboratory in Châtenay-Malabry carried out its research, claiming that there were too many procedural and chain of custody gaps. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) rejected it, calling it "defamatory" to WADA and its officers and employees, as well as the accredited laboratory involved. In January 2013, Armstrong admitted doping in an interview with Oprah Winfrey
In 2005, French daily 'Le Journal du Dimanche' reported that Spanish rider Manuel Beltrán, Danish Bo Hamburger and Colombian Joaquim Castelblanco were suspected of being among those whose frozen urine samples reportedly tested positive.
2000s.
2001.
2001 Giro d'Italia - The Giro was overshadowed by a series of scandals related to doping. Police raided the hotels of several teams during the race, uncovering a variety of banned substances. Italian Dario Frigo, who was fighting for the race lead at the time, was expelled from the race as a result. The week prior to the raid saw Pascal Hervé and Riccardo Forconi expelled from the race after testing positive for EPO. Italian police carried out anti-drugs raids on a number of hotels in the town of San Remo where the participants of the race were staying. About 200 officers were involved in the raid. Police officers search the rooms of riders from all 20 teams, confiscating medicines. The organizers decided to cancel the 18th stage after second-placed Dario Frigo was sacked by Fassa Bortolo team after illegal drugs were found in his room. Frigo later admitted carrying them as security in case he needed a boost during the final stages of the race. Italian Marco Pantani was banned for six months after an insulin syringe was found in his room. On appeal the ban was lifted.
2003.
Oil for Drugs was an Italian doping case against doctor Carlo Santuccione and a number of accomplices, started in 2003. He was accused of administering prohibited doping products to professional and amateur athletes, to enhance their performance as well as being involved in doping network across Italy.
2006.
2006 Tour de France was marred by doping scandals. Prior to the tour, numerous riders - including the two favourites Jan Ullrich and Ivan Basso - were expelled from the Tour due to their link with the Operación Puerto doping case. After the end of the race, the apparent winner Floyd Landis was found to have failed a drug test after stage 17; Landis contested the result and demanded arbitration. On 20 September 2007 Landis was found guilty and suspended retroactive to 30 January 2007 and stripped of the 2006 Tour de France title making Óscar Pereiro the title holder.
Operación Puerto doping case (meaning "Operation Mountain Pass") is a Spanish doping case against doctor Eufemiano Fuentes and a number of accomplices, started in May 2006. He is accused of administering prohibited doping products to 200 professional athletes, to enhance their performance. Tour de France's favorites Jan Ullrich and Ivan Basso were expelled from the Tour de France before the race started.
2007.
Doping cases.
2007 Tour de France - The event was affected by a series of scandals and speculations related to doping. By the end of the Tour, two cyclists were dismissed for testing positive, the wearer of the yellow jersey, Michael Rasmussen was voluntarily retired by his team for lying about his whereabouts and missing doping tests. A fourth rider was confirmed to having used doping while in a training session prior to the 2007 Tour and a fifth rider tested positive late in the race, with his result being officially announced just after the end of the Tour. Along the way, two teams contesting the competition were asked to withdraw due to positive tests of at least one member.

Akakor

Akakor is the name of a mythological ancient underground city, located somewhere between Brazil, Bolivia and Peru.
It was described by German journalist Karl Brugger, based on interviews with a self-proclaimed Brazilian Indian chieftain Tatunca Nara in his book "The Chronicle of Akakor" (1976). Although Brugger was apparently convinced, the information in it has only one source (Tatunca Nara), who was later exposed by activist and adventurer Rüdiger Nehberg as being Günther Hauck, a German.
Elements of the story from "The Chronicle of Akakor" were used in the film
"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull", where they were conflated with El Dorado, although references are to "Akator".

Saint John the Baptist Elementary School, Pittston

Saint John the Baptist Elementary School was a Catholic school located on William Street in Pittston City, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, United States. It was named after the neighboring church (which was first opened in 1892 by Slovak immigrants). It's pastors were Rev. Andrej Kazincy, Rev. Matthew Jankola, Rev. Andrej Pavco, Rev. John J. Bednarcik (who served from 1929-1961), Rev. Michael J. Krupar (who served until his death on Christmas Day in 1964), Monsignor Joseph Super (who served until 1998), Rev. Andrew Strish (who served until 2005), and finally John Bendick (who led the church until it closed in 2008).
History.
Under the leadership of Reverend Andrej Pavco and Reverend Andrew Jurica, ground was purchased for a school next to their church. Construction on the building stated in 1917. By 1924 the newly built Roman Catholic elementary school saw its first graduating class, which only contained nine kids at the time. Over the decades, the school had seen many teachers, graduating classes, administrators, and priests like Reverends Pavco, Bednarcik, Krupar, Super, and Strish. 
On March 27, 2004, Bishop Joseph Martino announced that Saint John the Baptist School and Saint Mary's School in Avoca would close for good. After a long fight, which even went legal, the doors closed for good on Friday, June 4, 2004. The last reverend for the elementary school was Andrew Strish. He administered the last school mass for the nearly 200 students and faculty. 
"Ninety-five years of Catholic education ends today at Saint John the Baptist," stated the last principal of the school, Robert Kaluzavich, during the ceremony. He concluded his speech with two words: "SJB Proud." 
Four years later, in late June 2008, the diocese closed the doors of the Church too. From December 2009 to March 2010, the Monsignor Joseph A. Super Athletic Center, the Saint John the Baptist Catholic Information Library, the rectory, the church, and a section of the school were demolished.

Heathrow Worldwide Distribution Centre

Heathrow World Distribution Centre (HWDC) is a sorting office for international mail operated by Royal Mail. It is situated in Langley, near Slough, England and opened in 2003.
All mail entering and leaving the United Kingdom is sorted at Heathrow World Distribution Centre under tight aviation security standards, following the closure of all other international mail handling facilities in the UK. Not all mail handled at HWDC arrives by air, as road vehicles that formerly arrived in the UK by ferry at Dover, or container ship at Southampton now extend their trip to HWDC by road, instead of entering the Royal Mail network at (now defunct) offices of exchange situated nearest the ports. Outbound mail will usually leave the country by aircraft from the nearby Heathrow Airport.
Sorting & despatch process.
HWDC is one of the most automated postal centres in Europe, and the site covers 100,000 square metres.
Automated conveyor systems transport trays of mail to automated mail processing equipment and manual or special handling workstations. The conveyors read the bar code labels on the trays and then transport them to the desired destination. When the mail is sorted on the automated mail sortation equipment, the letter destination image is lifted by high speed optical cameras. Both inbound and outbound mail is then automatically sorted into groups.
Mail which is departing by air transport is often conveyed by containers unique to airlines and/or fuselage shapes. Upon arrival, specialised floor conveyors manipulate awkwardly shaped containers to support their manual loading. Frequently used containers are stored on site in a specialised automated storage and retrieval system. The scheduling of container arrival, loading, and dispatch is sequenced with flight arrival and departures.

Bavarian D I

Class D I of the Royal Bavarian State Railways ("Königlich Bayerische Staatsbahn") was a tank locomotive with two coupled axles designed for shunting. As had been specified, these locomotives were simple and robust. They had a double-frame, with water tanks being suspended between the sole bars of the front section. Because the water capacity of 1.74 m3 soon proved too little even for a shunter operating only within the limits of its own station, additional side tanks were added to some engines during the 1880s. The outside Stephenson valve gear moved the valves on top of the horizontal cylinders. The locomotives could be braked using an Exter counterweight brake.
The D I saw shunting duties on small and medium-sized stations, for example in Schwandorf, Straubing or Neumarkt in der Oberpfalz. 13 locomotives were still in service when the Bavarian State Railway transferred to the Deutsche Reichsbahn in 1920. Seven vehicles were allocated numbers in the DRG renumbering plan for steam locomotives, but none were implemented as they were retired in 1923.

Artur Gadowski

Artur Gadowski (born June 1, 1967 in Szydłowiec) is Polish rock musician, vocalist of a hard rock band IRA.
Biography.
Gadowski comes from a musical family. His father played saxophone whereas his mother was a vocal instructor. His life's turning point happened in 1979 when he first heard The Beatles' album titled "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band", which formed his musical style for a long time afterwards.
Beginnings and career with IRA.
In 1985, he established his first amateur music band together with his schoolmates, "Kurcze blade", dissolved after merely a year. Then in 1986 he co-founded another band, "Landrynki dla dziewczynki", in which Gadowski initially played guitar but he later replaced the vocalist of the group who had been called up. The band gave many concerts at that time stirring up an interest, but they did not manage to qualify for the Jarocin Festival. During the band's performance in a club in Radom, Gadowski along with his group were spotted by Kuba Płucisz who was seeking a vocalist for his new music project. Artur Gadowski met Płucisz a few days later and received a proposal from him, accepting it. Meanwhile he continued his education attending a night secondary school. When the members of the group which was being founded were selected, the new band began their first rehearsals in an amphitheatre in Radom.
IRA was officially launched in November 1987. They gave successful performances during various festivals and contests, gaining interest and awards. After one of those concerts, IRA were invited to take part in National Festival of Polish Song in Opole, in which they presented themselves to the public in 1988. Gadowski was granted an award as a vocalist during that festival. The band debuted with their first album in December 1989 and toured all over Poland as well as in former USSR. IRA became the most marvellous rock band in Poland in the first half of the 1990s. Band's albums "Mój dom", "1993 rok" and "IRA Live" assured their rapid success. They performed about 150 concerts all around the country each year as well as opening acts for well-known rock and hard rock bands from abroad, e.g. Aerosmith in 1994. However in the second half of the decade, the band fell into crisis which led to its suspension in 1996.
Solo career.
From this moment on, Gadowski started his solo career. He signed a contract with Bertelsmann Music Group (BMG). The first album was intended to be released in October 1996, but the recorded material did not satisfy the vocalist. In 1997, Gadowski recorded a song "Szczęśliwego Nowego Jorku" ("Happy New York") together with Marek Kościkiewicz of the De Mono. The song promoted a film of the same title and it turned out to be a hit that reached leading places in music charts. Works on Gadowski's first solo album were resumed in 1998 but only one of the records which were found in the album's first version appeared on the CD published on April 20.
Gadowski participated in Opole Festival in the same year, i.e. 1998. Then he performed three songs: "Na kredyt", "Szczęśliwego Nowego Jorku" and a song by Czerwone Gitary titled "Biały krzyż". At that time, he also collaborated with other artists, including Zbigniew Hołdys. On September 30, he performed before the concert of Queen's guitarist, Brian May in Warsaw. He sang a duet with Anna Maria Jopek at another occasion. In February 2000, Gadowski took up composing soundtracks for TVP2 programs. The following month brought his second album "G.A.D.". All of the lyrics were written by Krzysztof Jaryczewski, whereas the very songs were composed by a Swedish producer Mark Tysper. In the same month, Gadowski appeared on stage before Joe Cocker at concerts in Warsaw and Poznań.
He also sang (with Ryszard Rynkowski and Grzegorz Markowski) a song titled "Najlepszy z najlepszych" ("The best of the best") which was the official hymn of the Polish Olympic team in 2000.
Reactivation of the band.
A deteriorating financial situation, however, forced him to go to America with Piotr Sujka and Wojciech Owczarek of "IRA", in order to work on a building site. There they played their old repertoire on days off. They employed a guitarist, Tomasz Ciastko, and started to perform in clubs. After their return to Poland, they reactivated the band, at first as "Artur Gadowski & IRA". Gadowski has recorded albums with the band as well as given plenty of concerts all over Poland since then. In addition, he has appeared as guest performer on the albums of other artists, including Ewelina Flinta and Krzysztof Jaryczewski. The year 2003 brought the 15th anniversary of IRA's existence. On that occasion the whole group gave a jubilee concert in Radom.
Health problems in 2004.
At the end of 2004, Artur Gadowski started to have problems with his voice and was operated on on October 18 because of ineffectiveness of the treatment he had undergone with use of medicines. His goitre was removed, but suddenly some serious and unexpected complications appeared, leaving him unconscious for two days. Eventually he recovered and soon regained his voice as well as his physical strength. He was able to play with his band again in 2006.
After recovery.
Apart from other appearances, he took part in an annual charity concert organized by Anna Dymna on the Main Market Square in Cracow. On October 15 he was guest on a TV show "Weekend z Gwiazdą" ("Weekend with the Star") which was, by way of an exception, broadcast from the Stansted airport near London, UK. On December 15 he appeared on a special concert in Toruń dedicated to a Polish musician, Grzegorz Ciechowski. At the beginning of 2008 Gadowski sang a duet with a vocalist of a debuting band, Nefer. They recorded a song titled "Samotni w sieci" ("The lonely on the net"). Gadowski was the author of lyrics for the song.

The Irish Descendants

The Irish Descendants are a folk group from the Atlantic province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada. All the members, born of Irish emitters, were workers in the Newfoundland fishing industry before forming the band in 1990 out of the remnants of two former Newfoundland bands – The Descendants and Irish Coffee. The group helped to popularise traditional Newfoundland music to a wider Canadian audience in the early 1990s, along with other bands such as Great Big Sea. Their popularity within the province itself led to their selection as the official band of the province's 500th anniversary celebrations, during which they performed for the Queen. Tension within the group caused co-frontman D'Arcy Broderick to leave soon after this period, and their lineup has frequently changed since then, with frontman Con O'Brien being the only constant member. Regular touring and occasional album releases, most recently "Southern Shore" in 2007, have kept the group in the public eye.
History.
In the summer of 1986, Con O’Brien and Ronnie Power of Bay Bulls teamed up with Thomas Battcock of Brigus South to form The Descendants. After Battcock’s departure due to other commitments, Power and O'Brien teamed up with multi-instrumentalist and vocalist D'Arcy Broderick of Bay De Verde and Bassist Larry Martin of Grates Cove to form the new band The Irish Descendants. 
In 1991, the Descendants recorded their first album, "Misty Morning Shore", on independent label Duckworth Records. It caught the attention of Warner Music and they signed the band following up with their major label debut "Look To The Sea" in 1993. The record was successful, and was followed by 1994's "Gypsies and Lovers", which saw the band expanded to include drummer Gerard Broderick and keyboardist Kathy Phippard. The album won the band the Roots & Traditional Album of the Year award at the Juno Awards, as well as the Entertainer of the Year award at the East Coast Music Awards.
Their 1996 album, "Livin' On The Edge", featured a contemporary country sound which caused a rift in the band. At a New Year's Eve show in the group's hometown of St. John's, Broderick and O'Brien engaged in a fight backstage, which culminated in Broderick leaving the group. The official reason cited was "irreconcilable musical differences." His departure occurred just before a tour with Anne Murray, and the band's rush to fill his shoes led them to Eamonn O'Rourke, an Irish fiddler living in New York, who joined the band for a short time. He played with them on 1998's "Rollin' Home"; this proved the group's last album with Ronnie Power and Larry Martin, who departed in 2000, and their last original album for Warner. The label released a final, compilation album entitled "So Far So Good' in 1999.
In 2001, the group resurfaced with a new lineup: O'Brien joined forces with St. John's musician Mike Hanrahan, as well as veteran players Byron Pardy, Kelly Russell and Paul 'Boomer' Stamp (all of whom had played, as guests, on "Rollin' Home"). This new lineup released "Blooming Bright Star" on Koch Records, produced once again by Derek Harrington. The disc featured Great Big Sea guesting on vocals on the track 'Step It Out Mary', as well as covers of songs by Gerry Rafferty and Paul Brady. The group also released a Christmas album, "The Gift", the following year. (The disc was re-released in 2006 on Newfoundland label Avondale Music.) However, Kelly Russell left the band in 2003 due to their extensive touring schedule; Graham Wells, a St. John's musician known for his multi-instrumental capabilities (although especially proficient on the accordion) joined in the same year. Pardy was to follow suit soon; at this time, brothers Glenn and Paul Hiscock (performing fiddle and bass, respectively) of the St. John's band Connemara came into the fold. Guest musician Bob Pike of Shanneyganock played bass on 2004's "Across the Water", released on the Kells Music label; the change in distribution enabled the band's new music to be released in America. The album hit the top of the North American Irish music sales charts. A second compilation followed, entitled "We Are the Irish Descendants". Stamp left the band in 2004.
2007 saw the release of "Southern Shore", produced by Alan Doyle of Great Big Sea, who also co-wrote the track 'Not for the Money Alone' with O'Brien and played on several songs; Great Big Sea also guested on the song 'Downtown Girl.' The album also featured the group's first song recorded without O'Brien, 'No Con Test.' In 2009, the Hiscock brothers took a temporary break from touring, replaced in the lineup by various musicians (and for one tour, Kelly Russell). Later in the year, the pair were replaced permanently by Toronto native Duncan Cameron and Newfoundland musician Robert Kelly. A third compilation, titled "Encore: The Best of the Irish Descendants Volume 2" was also released, this time by Avondale. 2010 marked the group's 20th anniversary, celebrated with a series of shows in western and central Canada, as well as a closing performance at the 34th Newfoundland and Labrador Folk Festival, in St. John's. In addition, another lineup change was evident: Wells departed, and veteran Dave Panting (formerly of Rawlins Cross) joined the band.
The band is noted for its heavy touring schedule. They have played overseas, notably at the International Festival of the Sea in England, although the majority of their work has been in North America, particularly Canada. Upon the celebration of Newfoundland's quincentennial in 1996, the group was selected as one of the official entertainers, and as such performed for the representatives of the monarchy, including Queen Elizabeth II. They continue to play regularly.
Member history.
The members of the Irish Descendants have changed repeatedly over the years, both in number and in name. Founding member Con O'Brien has been the only original member of the group since 2000. The group has occasionally recorded and toured with guest musicians and alumni; most recently, Larry Foley, Patrick Moran, Billy Sutton and Kelly Russell joined the group at various times in 2009.

DZLT-AM

DZLT (1188 kHz Lucena City) is an AM radio station owned and operated by the Radio Corporation of the Philippines. Its studio and transmitter are located in Barangay Ibabang Dupay, Lucena City, Quezon, and it has the distinction of being the oldest radio station in southern Luzon.
History.
DZLT was conceived by Quezon Representative Manuel S. Enverga as a means to provide radio service to the province of Quezon. To fulfill this aim, Enverga founded the Luzon Broadcasting Corporation, taking advantage of a broadcast license issued to Luzonian Colleges (today the Manuel S. Enverga University Foundation) by Congress through Republic Act No. 2354. The station opened on March 23, 1960, with President Carlos P. Garcia, First Lady Leonila Garcia and Senator Gil Puyat being present at the station's opening.
Live news reporting began in 1965. However, the station was ordered shut with the imposition of martial law on September 21, 1972, subsequently re-opening on October 20. Ownership of the station would transfer from the Enverga family to the Radio Corporation of the Philippines, owned by Eduardo Cojuangco.
DZLT's transmitter was knocked down twice by typhoons: the most recent one by Typhoon Xangsane (Milenyo) in 2006.

<doc id="18285782" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18285782" title="Locator map">
Locator map

A locator map, sometimes referred to simply as a "locator", is typically a simple map used in cartography to show the location of a particular geographic area within its larger and presumably more familiar context. Depending on the needs of the cartographer, this type of map can be used on its own or as an inset or addition to a larger map.
Purpose.
Arthur Robinson, an American cartographer influential in thematic cartography, stated that a map not properly designed "will be a cartographic failure." Any map that does not take its audience into account by assuming too much reader knowledge about the map area's context will not fulfill its purpose. Location maps help achieve this purpose by familiarizing the reader with the location of an area they may not have read about previously. A good understanding of the audience's mental map for a particular area is critical for a proper application of location maps. 
Used on their own, location maps do not differ significantly from traditional maps, differing primarily in the fact that solitary locator maps focus the attention on a single location within the map frame, where traditional maps generally seek to portray a multitude of features across the entire frame.
More commonly, location maps appear as insebts or ancillary maps (maps adjacent to or near the primary map) in order to help the audience place the geographic area being mapped properly inside their internal frame of reference.
Common uses.
Education.
As educators seek to teach students increasing levels of geography, maps generated for textbooks must reference the expected geographic knowledge of a particular education level. Location maps achieve this purpose by highlighting more in-depth geography within the context the student is familiar with. 
In the United States, this purpose is reinforced by the standards set by the National Council for Geographic Education, which says that "Mental maps, or cognitive maps, are among our most important geographic tools. Because they exist in our minds, they are the maps we use for thinking and decision-making."
Interactive applications.
Some online applications that allow the user to zoom into an area often include locator maps to assist in navigating the main map or image. For example, Google Maps uses a locator map to orient visitors to its site, included as a toggle button. These locators often feature a movable box that assists the user with navigating the main map.
Other applications using locator software allow people to generate their own location maps by entering some basic information about where they are. This generates a map showing places within a specified radius of that point that meet the user's criteria. Banks, hotels, retail chains, and restaurants are common users of this type of service.
Commerce.
Businesses have a vested interest in letting consumers know where they are located, and frequently use locator maps to help them reach out to potential customers. These maps typically range from a crude schematic map showing nearby crossroads, to more realistic maps that include greater geographic detail and context.
Corporate web sites.
Businesses such as restaurants and retail establishments often have locator maps online to help potential customers find their location. These are sometimes accompanied by driving and parking directions from one or more directions of travel, especially if many of their customers are not from the local area.
Direct marketing.
The widespread distribution of sophisticated Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping techniques has allowed the development of large-scale customized locator maps that can be tailored to individual consumers in direct marketing campaigns. This sophistication allows a variety of customized locator maps to be produced in a relatively short period of time.
Major types of direct marketing locator maps are:

The Tiger and the Horse

The Tiger and the Horse is a three-act play by Robert Bolt, written in 1960. It takes its title from William Blake's "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell": "The tigers of wrath are wiser than the horses of instruction."
The play's story involves Jack Dean, a Professor of Astronomy at a prestigious English university (unnamed, but presumed to be Oxford) who is the primary candidate for the Vice Chancellor-ship after the current Vice Chancellor, Hugo Slate, retires the position. Dean has a wife, Gwendolyn, and two daughters, Stella and Mary. The plot focuses around a petition to ban nuclear weapons (in real life, Bolt's pet political issue), which is introduced by Louis Flax, a strong-willed, opinionated research fellow who is courting Stella. Dean refuses to sign it, even though his wife strongly supports the petition. His unwillingness to commit himself slowly drives his wife insane; she feels herself unloved and unappreciated by her husband, but blames herself for it. Stella becomes pregnant by Louis, and in a subplot a frustrated Stella tries to convince Louis to marry her. At the play's denouement, Gwendolyn destroys a Holbein portrait of the University's founders and pins the petition to it; this convinces her husband to support his wife and sign the petition, even though it will ruin his chances of becoming Vice Chancellor. 
The play's original run coincided with Bolt's "A Man for All Seasons" in 1960. It was more financially successful than "Man", although it received mixed critical reviews. Its original cast featured Michael Redgrave as Dean, daughter Vanessa, in one of her first major stage roles, as Stella, and Alan Dobie as Louis.

Australian cricket team in England and Scotland in 2009

The Australia national cricket team toured Great Britain to play a series of cricket matches during the 2009 English cricket season. The team played five Test matches – one in Wales – seven One Day Internationals and two Twenty20 Internationals against England. The Australians also played four other first-class matches in England, against the England Lions and two county sides. In addition, Australia took part in the 2009 ICC World Twenty20, but were eliminated at the first round after defeats to the West Indies and Sri Lanka.
The series of five Test matches between England and Australia was for The Ashes and, for the first time, a Test match was held in the capital of Wales, Cardiff. Australia was the holder of The Ashes trophy, having won the 2006-07 series 5–0. England won the last series to be held in England in 2005, and subsequently won the 2009 Ashes 2–1. The Twenty20 International series was drawn 0–0 as bad weather meant that neither match produced a result.
Matches.
First class matches.
Tour matches.
Australians v Sussex.
The match was notable for the success of Pepler Sandri, a South African-born fast bowler of Italian ancestry, who took three key wickets on the first day.
Needing 418 in their final innings to win, the Sussex batsmen came within 37 runs of this total before time was called with three wickets remaining. Carl Hopkinson was the highest scorer, achieving 115 runs from 172 deliveries.
Australians v England Lions.
Brett Lee sustained a rib injury during the preparatory match against the England Lions which prevented him from playing any part in the Test series.
The Ashes.
The 2009 Ashes series was held from 8 July to 23 August 2009 at five grounds in England and Wales. The first Test, held at the SWALEC Stadium in Cardiff – itself hosting its first ever Test match – finished in a draw, while the second Test at London's Lord's Cricket Ground resulted in a 115-run victory for England after they had bowled Australia out for 215 in their first innings. Andrew Flintoff, who had announced his impending retirement from Test cricket prior to the Lord's Test, took five wickets in the second innings to secure the victory.
The rain-affected third Test at Edgbaston in Birmingham also finished in a draw, but a batting collapse brought about by immaculate bowling in the fourth Test at Headingley in Leeds meant that England were dismissed for 102 and ended up losing by an innings and 80 runs. That result took the series to a final, deciding Test at The Oval back in London.
England reached 332 all out in their first innings, and then skittled the Australians for 160 on the second day, with Stuart Broad taking five wickets. A total of 373/9 declared, including a maiden Test century from Jonathan Trott, meant that Australia were set a target of 546 runs with two days left to play. All ten wickets came on the fourth day of the match, and despite a knock of 121 for Michael Hussey, Australia's response of 348 meant that they fell 197 runs short and England won the series 2–1.
Limited overs matches.
After the Test series, Australia played one One Day International against Scotland before embarking on a two-match Twenty20 International series and a seven-match One Day International series against England. They won the match against Scotland by 189 runs, but the Twenty20 series against England was drawn 0–0 as both matches were affected by rain and produced no results. The ODI series is scheduled to begin on 4 September 2009.
Scotland v Australia.
Australia began their series of One Day International and Twenty20 International matches with a warm-up match against Scotland. Scotland won the toss, but chose to field, a decision that Australia made them regret with a total of 345 all out off their 50 overs. Opener Shane Watson and middle-order batsman Adam Voges both made half-centuries, but the total was bolstered by David Hussey's 111 runs off 83 balls, an innings that included five sixes. Scotland's Gordon Goudie took five wickets, only the second Scottish player to manage such a feat in One Day Internationals. Scotland responded by posting 51 runs for their first wicket within 10 overs, but they lost another three wickets before reaching their ton. They were eventually bowled out for 156 in 39.3 overs, with Gavin Hamilton top-scoring with 38 off 50 balls, meaning that Australia won by 189 runs.
Twenty20 series.
The Twenty20 International series began on 30 August 2009 at Old Trafford, Manchester. England won the toss and captain Paul Collingwood chose to field first. The Australian first wicket lasted until the sixth over, when Shane Watson was caught by Ravi Bopara off Stuart Broad. David Warner was then trapped LBW by Paul Collingwood for 33 runs in the ninth over, and David Hussey lasted just two balls before being stumped by Matt Prior for a duck, again off Collingwood's bowling. However, Australia added 78 runs for their fourth wicket, Cameron White totalling 55 runs – including three sixes – before being caught by Collingwood off Broad. This left them at 132/4, with 11 balls left, in which Adam Voges scored 11 to take the tourists to 145/4 at the end of their 20 overs. As the England openers came to the crease, Bopara got off strike with the second ball, leaving T20I debutant Joe Denly to face Brett Lee. The Australian bowler pitched the ball short, and Denly managed to get his bat to it, only to top-edge to Nathan Hauritz at short square leg for a debut golden duck. Bopara himself was out with his next ball, the first of the second over, but rain called a halt to proceedings at that point, and England were saved from a looming defeat.
Heavy rain prevented the start of the second T20I, with the umpires inspecting the pitch twice before deciding to abandon the match. Although the majority of the field was suitable for play, a small patch of turf at the Brian Statham End where the bowlers would have made their run-ups remained soft under foot, and the umpires and the captains made the determination that it would have been unsafe for play to commence.
NatWest series.
The England's captain, Andrew Strauss, won the toss and elected to field first. In the first innings Australia scored 260 for 5, Cameron White and Callum Ferguson scored half centuries, the highest score for both. In the second innings Strauss fell soon with only 12 runs, but Ravi Bopara scored 49 runs. In the 9th wicket Ryan Sidebottom and Adil Rashid scored 27 runs in 14 balls, but they need 32 for the victory.
England won the toss, and Andrew Strauss chose to field. Callum Ferguson again scored a half century. Australia closed the innings with 249 for 8. In the second innings England opened with 74 runs in the first wicket (Ravi Bopara 27 and Andrew Strauss 44), but the next 9 wickets only scored 136 runs, and finally England lose the game but 39 runs. Paul Collingwood reached 4,000 runs in ODI (5th Englishman), and scored his 22nd Half century.
Andrew Strauss won the toss for third time in the series, and elected to bat. Strauss scored 63 runs, his 17th half century, England scored 229 for 9. Cameron White scored his first century, and Michael Clarke his 36th half century. Both scored 143 runs in the 3rd wicket (Clarke 52 runs and White 86 runs), Clarke was bowled by Graeme Swann. Finally Australia reached the target with 6 wickets and 9 balls remaining.
Ricky Ponting returned as Australian captain. Strauss won for fourth time the toss, and chose bat. Andrew Strauss opened with 63 runs, his 18th half century. Brett Lee took 5 wickets by 9th time in his career. England scored 220 in 46.3 overs. In the second innings Tim Paine scored his first half century, and Michael Clarke his 37th. Australia reached the target with only 3 wickets, and won the series.
England won the toss, and Strauss elected bat. England open with Strauss (35) and Denly (45), but Eoin Morgan scored 58 runs, making his 6th half century. England finally scored 299. In the Second innings the openers Watson (36) and Paine (16) fell soon in the match (9th and 15th over), but Ricky Ponting scored his highest score vs England 126 runs of 151 balls (27th century), and Michael Clarke scored 52 runs (38th half century). Mitchell Johnson scored a six for the victory with 10 balls remaining.

Münchner Freiheit

The Münchner Freiheit (called "Münchener Freiheit" until 1998) is a square in Munich's Schwabing, near the English Garden. It is a popular tourist attraction, especially during winter when one of Munich's largest Christmas markets takes place.
A station for the Munich U-Bahn is located at the square and named after it (see Münchner Freiheit (Munich U-Bahn)).
A German pop group, Münchener Freiheit, derived their name from the location, and have retained the original spelling.
Origin of the name.
The square was originally known as Feilitzsch Platz. During World War II various resistance movements against the Nazis had risen up at various times to oppose the regime. In 1945 the resistance group Freiheitsaktion Bayern took control of two Munich radio towers and began broadcasting anti-Nazi propaganda. The square was renamed "Münchener Freiheit" (Freedom of Munich) in their honor. The alternative spelling "Münchner Freiheit" was adopted by the city council in 1998 though "Münchener Freiheit" remains popular.

The Dema Glass site emerged as a possible location in October 2004 at a time when the club were already pursuing planning permission to redevelop Wheeldon Mill, the town's former greyhound stadium. Chesterfield Borough Council viewed the site as part of a masterplan to regenerate the A61 corridor, an area to the north of the town centre and including the Chesterfield Canal. Agreement in principle between the club and local authority was struck in February 2005, though progress faced initial delays.
Designs for the proposed new stadium were provided by local architects Ward McHugh Associates who had previously undertaken commissions on the redevelopment of the South Stand at Twickenham and Everton's Goodison Park stadium. 
Planning permission was granted after a public meeting held on 1 July 2008, with the plans forming part of a wider mixed-use development. The land at the site was handed over to the club in February 2009 and, after decontamination, construction officially started on Thursday 23 July 2009, overseen by GB Development Solutions. Separate buildings which formed part of the overall scheme included a Tesco Extra superstore, Tesco petrol station, a KFC, a Enterprise car rental and other office facilities.
The new stadium was handed over to the club in July 2010 and granted its full capacity licence from the Safety Advisory Group after hosting two limited capacity games against Derby County and Barnsley.
Stands and facilities.
The ground's four stands are: The HTM Stand (Main), The Karen Child Stand (South), The Rubicon Print Stand (North) and The Midlands Co-operative Community Stand (East). Unlike Saltergate, Chesterfield's old home, all stands enjoy unrestricted views.
"The 'HTM' Stand (West Stand)"
The Main (West) stand has a curved roof line and a capacity of 3,144 seats with glazed windshields on either side and executive facilities at the rear. The stand includes conference rooms and banqueting rooms, including the Leengate Legends Lounge, and is where the majority of the club's non-footballing revenue is generated. The stand is sponsored by HTM Products (Derbyshire) Ltd.
"The 'Karen Child' Stand (South Stand)"
Located behind the goal on the south side of the Stadium, this stand is regarded as similar to the former Saltergate Kop in being the area where the main atmosphere is created by home supporters. Its capacity is 2,064 seats. The stand is sponsored by supporter Karen Child-Smith who won the National Lottery in 2007. 
"The 'Rubicon Print' Stand (North Stand)"
The North Stand is almost identical to the South stand, the only difference is the North stand has only one disabled gantry while the South stand has two. Away supporters are primarily housed in this stand, where up to 2,088 can be seated. (At the time the ground opened, the North Stand was called the 'Printability Stand').
"The 'Spencers Solicitors' Stand (East Stand)."
Like the Main stand, the East Stand has a curved roof line but with no executive facilities at the rear. It includes a multi-purpose sports and community room, sports injury clinic, meeting rooms, a gym and healthy living resource for all ages, a wave pool for rehabilitation, heritage room, classroom resource centre for local education, a soft play area for youngsters, and a cafeteria. Additional space for away fans may be provided in this stand as demand requires. Its capacity is 3,208 seats. (At the time the ground opened, the East Stand was called the 'Midlands Co-operative Community Stand').
All four stands encompass concourse facilities under the stand, including on-tap beverages and multiple television screens showing the game in progress, and Sky sports channels before and after the game.
The pies served at the stadium have been judged the best pies in English football.
Notable fixtures.
The official Opening Match was a friendly against Derby County on 24 July 2010, during which summer signing Craig Davies scored the first ever goal, in a game that finished in a 5-4 win for Derby. 
The first competitive league fixture (Football League Two) was against Barnet on 7 August 2010. The game finished with a 2-1 victory to Chesterfield. Dwayne Mattis and Jack Lester were the goalscorers.
The highest attendance for all games was 10,089 for the League Two clash against Rotherham United on 18 March 2011. The game finished with a resounding 5-0 victory for Chesterfield.
On 8 February 2011 the stadium hosted its first international game when England Under 19s played Germany Under 19s in a friendly. The game finished with a 1-0 victory for the visiting German side. On 10 September 2012, England Under 21s restarted their 2013 UEFA European Championship qualification campaign with a 1-0 win against Norway at the stadium.

Barangay Kagawad

A Barangay Kagawad, abbreviated as "Kgwd.", also known as a barangay councilor and in Filipino, konsehal ng barangay, is an elected government official who is a member of the "Sangguniang Barangay" (Filipino, "Barangay Council") of a particular "barangay". Barangays are the smallest political units in the Philippines. Formerly officially called "konsehal" ("councilor"), a "barangay kagawad" participates in the governance and activities of the "barangay" together with the other "kagawad"s, the "Punong Barangay' ("Barangay Captain") and the members of the "Sangguniang Kabataan" ("Youth Council"). There are seven "barangay kagawad"s in each "barangay" who are ranked according to the number of votes they had received in an electoral process exercised by registered voters in a particular "barangay".
Term of office.
Like the "Punong Barangay", the Local Government Code of 1991 (Republic Act 7160 as amended) sets the term of office of the "Barangay Kagawad" to three years term, and sets a term limit of three consecutive terms, for a total of nine year.
Functions and responsibilities.
"Barangay Kagawad"s function as the legislature of the "barangay". They create and sponsor resolutions and ordinances. "Barangay Kagawad"s are also expected to assist the "Punong Barangay" in performing his or her functions.
As per the purpose of the revised penal code, the punong barangay, members of sangguniang barangay and members of the lupong tagapamayapa are considered persons in authority within their areas of jurisdiction.

Fort Jones, with its companion, Fort Laughlin were Civil War redoubts, built by the employees of Jones and Laughlin Steel in June and July 1863 for the defense of Pittsburgh from a suspected invasion by Confederate troops. It is named for Benjamin Franklin Jones, a local businessman. Fort Jones occupied the top of a hill in Mount Oliver, Pennsylvania. It was totally destroyed in 1868, and became the site of St. Joseph's Church at 438 Ormsby Street, for which the site was originally purchased. The church is now closed. It was sometimes known as "Fort Jackson", in honor of Brig. General Conrad Feger Jackson, killed in the Battle of Fredericksburg, Virginia, in December 1862.

Tehosekoitin

Tehosekoitin was a Finnish rock band formed in 1991. The band made music with traditional rock 'n roll attitude. Besides pure rock 'n roll, they also made some songs which were more like jazz, blues or tender ballads than actual rock. Tehosekoitin was really popular in Finland. The band toured after a successful decade in Suomi later under the new name Screamin' Stukas in Britain and Europe. They translated all their lyrics into English. The tour wasn't very successful.
Tehosekoitin made their first three recordings "Greatest Hits II", "...ja valtakunnassa kaikki hyvin!!!?" (...and everything's well in the kingdom!!!?) and "T.S. <3 A.L" (a split with Apulanta in vinyl playing Finnish-style punk.
After those recordings Tehosekoitin changed their style into more traditional rock and made their first CD "Rock'n'roll"(1994) as they were starting to have some success in the Lahti region.
Tehosekoitin became known in whole Finland in 1997 with their single "C'mon baby yeah". After that they released "Köyhät syntiset" and the success was guaranteed.
Tehosekoitin released also "Varoittava esimerkki"(1998), "Freak Out"(1999), Rock 'n' Roll Monster Movie Show"(2000), "Rakkauden Gangsterit"(2001) and "Golden Greats"(2002).
In 2002 they published a CD "A lotta rhythm" in English with the name "Screamin' Stukas".
CD-single "Lupaan"(2004) became the last Tehosekoitin recording ever been published and they played their last gig in August 2004. A reunion tour has been announced for 2009.
Nowadays their singer Otto Grundström has also become known as a poet. He also featured as lead vocalist on the single "Rakkaus repii meidät kappaleiksi" By the Finnish punk rock group Pää Kii in 2012.

<doc id="18286082" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18286082" title="Balanced repeated replication">
Balanced repeated replication

Balanced repeated replication is a statistical technique for estimating the sampling variability of a statistic obtained by stratified sampling.
Selection of half-samples.
Simplified version.
Consider first an idealized situation, where each stratum of our sample contains only two units. Then each half-sample will contain exactly one of these, so that the half-samples share the stratification of the full sample. If there are "s" strata, we would ideally take all 2"s" ways of choosing the half-stratum; but if "s" is large, this may be infeasible.
If fewer half-samples must be taken, they are selected so as to be "balanced" (hence the name of the technique). Let "H" be a Hadamard matrix of size "s", and choose one row per half-sample. (It doesn't matter which rows; the important fact is that all the rows of "H" are orthogonal.) Now, for each half-sample, choose which unit to take from each stratum according to the sign of the corresponding entry in "H": that is, for half-sample "h", we choose the first unit from stratum "k" if "Hhk" = −1 and the second unit if "Hhk" = +1. The orthogonality of rows of "H" ensures that our choices are uncorrelated between half-samples.
Realistic version.
Unfortunately, there may not be a Hadamard matrix of size "s". In this case, we choose one of size slightly larger than "s". Now the submatrix of "H" which defines our choices need no longer have exactly orthogonal rows, but if the size of "H" is only slightly larger than "s" the rows will be approximately orthogonal.
The number of units per stratum need not be exactly 2, and typically will not be. In this case, the units in each stratum are divided into two "variance PSUs" (PSU = primary sampling unit) of equal or nearly-equal size. This may be done at random, or in such a way as to make the PSUs as similar as possible. (So, for instance, if stratification was done on the basis of some numerical parameter, the units in each stratum may be sorted in order of this parameter, and alternate ones chosen for the two PSUs.)
If the number of strata is very large, multiple strata may be combined before applying BRR. The resulting groups are known as "variance strata".
BRR formula.
Let "a" be the value of our statistic as calculated from the full sample; let "ai" ("i" = 1...,"n") be the corresponding statistics calculated for the half-samples. ("n" is the number of half-samples.)
Then our estimate for the sampling variance of the statistic is the average of ("ai" − "a")2. This is (at least in the ideal case) an unbiased estimate of the sampling variance.
Fay's method.
Fay's method is a generalization of BRR. Instead of simply taking half-size samples, we use the full sample every time but with unequal weighting: "k" for units outside the half-sample and 2 − "k" for units inside it. (BRR is the case "k" = 0.) The variance estimate is then "V"/(1 − "k")2, where "V" is the estimate given by the BRR formula above.

International Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs

The International Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs (ISSSC) is an organization imagined by Joseph Conrad in his novel "Heart of Darkness" (published 1902), with which he attempted to criticize the colonialist impulse of his historical time, mainly by mocking the Berlin Conference of 1884.
"Heart of Darkness" tells the story of Charles Marlow, an Englishman who took a foreign assignment from a Belgian trading company as a ferry-boat captain in Africa. The novel is widely regarded as both critiquing the imperialist expansion into Africa, whilst also examining the themes of power dynamics and morality. Although Conrad does not give the name of the river, at the time of writing the Congo Free State, the location of the large and important Congo River, was a private colony of Belgium's King Leopold II. In the story, Marlow, employed to transport ivory downriver, mentions the ISSSC as he finds a journal from a certain Kurtz, another ivory trader, whom he secretly needs to find and return to civilization, in a cover-up operation. Marlow, a recurring character and alter ego of Conrad himself, describes that journal as “a beautiful piece of writing” or “vibrating with eloquence”, among others. Marlow would find there a quote by Kurtz in which he stated that whites “must necessarily appear to them in the nature of supernatural beings – we approach them with the might of a deity.” The document is ended with the sentence, handwritten at a later date, “Exterminate all the Brutes!”

Gedania Danzig

KS Gedania Danzig was an ethnically-Polish association football club that was part of German football competition in the inter-war period. It was formed in 1922 in what was at the time the Free City of Danzig (present day Gdańsk, Poland). Banned by the Nazis in 1939, the club re-emerged following the end of World War II and is active today as "Gedania Gdańsk". 
__TOC__
History.
In 1920, following World War I, Danzig and environs were separated from Germany through the Treaty of Versailles, becoming an autonomous city-state under a League of Nations mandate. "Gedania" was founded as a sports club 15 September 1922 out of the gymnastics club "Towarzystwo Gimnastyczne Sokół" (Falcon). Initially the club was to be named "Polonia", however, local authorities opposed the idea, so the name "Gedania", a Latinized version of the name of the city, was used instead. In 1931, the football department of the club was founded and just two years later, in 1933, the club was competing in Germany's Gauliga Ostpreußen, one of sixteen top flight divisions formed in the re-organization of the country's football competition under the Third Reich. The team enjoyed only moderate success, finishing second in what had become the Gauliga Danzig (I), a regional division of the Gauliga Ostpreußen, in 1936–37 and 1937–38, before delivering poor performances in the playoff round of the combined Gauliga Ostpreußen in both seasons.
The ethnically-Polish side was regarded as politically unpalatable to the Nazi regime and was disbanded on 31 August 1939, on the eve of World War II, which began with the German invasion of Poland. The club's sporting equipment was destroyed while trophies, awards and the club chronicle were all stolen or taken away. Some of the team's facilities were used by the German military sports club "LSV Danzig" during the war.
Following the war, the club was re-established as "Gedania Gdańsk", and currently plays in the regional league Gdańsk I. The club also has sections for volleyball and rowing.

The museum was created in 1937 by Jean Baptiste Perrin (awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, 1926) during an international exhibition on "Arts and techniques in modern life". In 1938 the French government decided to convert the facility into a new museum, which now occupies 25,000 square metres within the west wing of the Grand Palais (Palais d'Antin) built for the Exposition Universelle (1900) to designs by architect Albert-Félix-Théophile Thomas. In January 2010 the museum was merged with the Cité des Sciences et de l'Industrie. The new institution is named universcience.
Today the museum contains permanent exhibits for mathematics, physics, astronomy, chemistry, geology, and biology, featuring interactive experiments with commentaries by lecturers. It includes a Zeiss planetarium with 15-metre dome.

Walkin' Blues

"Walkin' Blues" is a blues standard based on the song by Robert Johnson recorded in 1936 and reaching popularity after its reissue on the LP "King of the Delta Blues Singers" in 1961.
The song incorporates the lessons Johnson absorbed from Son House. It takes its first verse and title from one of House's favourite verses. The melody and text structure are those of House's "My Black Mama".
Sources.
Prior to 1930 there were several recorded songs with the title "Walking Blues" which bear no relation to this song. There were songs with the line "Woke up this morning feeling down to my shoes", and innumerable songs with the half-line "I got the blues". Son House combined these to make the couplet
At his 1930 Paramount recording session, House made a test pressing (unissued and lost until 1985) which incorporated the couplet in the usual blues structure structure, i.e. with repeated first line:
The remaining verses were mostly on the woke "up this morning" theme, but one extended the "walking" theme.
In 1941 a field recording of House performing a different "Walking Blues" with his band (Willie Brown, Fiddling Joe Martin and Leroy Williams) was made by Alan Lomax and John Work for the Library of Congress/Fisk University Mississippi Delta Collection. The session made a great impression on Lomax, which he attempted to describe many years later in "The Land Where the Blues Began". No other verse of this song shared the "walking" theme, the melody was different and the verse structure was very different, i.e. with the whole couplet repeated:
A year later, Lomax returned and recorded a solo song from House with the title "Walking Blues" which was different from both previous songs. It consisted of the sequence of verses House later called "Death Letter Blues". House had recorded this sequence at the Paramount session as part of "My Black Mama", the song which best displays the melody, the structure, the guitar figures and the declaiming style that Johnson used on "Walking Blues".
Johnson's song.
Lyrics.
Like House in his 1930 song, Johnson follows a "morning" theme.
The first verse is from Son House. The second may have been local or composed by either singer. It formed the basis of the song by their younger neighbour Muddy Waters published by the Library of Congress as "Country Blues" and by Aristocrat as "I Feel Like Going Home". The third verse was in circulation and had been recorded by Mamie Smith in 1920 in "Fare Thee Honey" in the form
"I’m leavin’ town to wear you off my mind;"
"I’ve been mistreated an’ I don’t mind dyin’."
As a male singer, Johnson could plausibly speak of the dangerous hobo practice of "riding the blinds" defined as ""To cadge a lift by standing on the platform attached to the blind baggage car ... a car that ain't got no door in the end that's next to the engine.""
The fourth verse is extremely common. The final verse, with reference to the widely advertised Elgin watch, was first used on record by Blind Lemon Jefferson in "Change My Luck Blues" in 1928.
Music.
Edward Komara has compared Johnson's "Walkin' Blues" with House's "My Black Mama". Of the guitar accompaniment, he writes:
Komara also notes that Johnson accelerates the tempo ""building a momentum not present in House's original"".
In Elijah Wald's judgement:
Success.
"Walkin' Blues" was not a commercial success when issued into the Black race record market. Of this and other recordings in the style of Son House, Wald comments:
However, these songs were received with great enthusiasm by a small White group of jazz record collectors and critics. Most notably, John Hammond, chose "Walkin' Blues" and "Preachin' Blues" as the records to be played at his 1938 From Spirituals to Swing concert, such was his disappointment that Johnson himself could not appear. (Johnson had died a few months earlier.) The 1961 reissue King of the Delta Blues Singers was marketed to White enthusiasts. According to most sources, John Hammond was involved in the production and the selection of tracks. It included the two House-style songs and a song with House-style guitar figures "Cross Road Blues", and excluded songs in the commercial style of the late 1930s. Notable exclusions were Johnson's one commercial hit Terraplane Blues and songs which he passed on to the main stream of blues recording "Sweet Home Chicago" and "Dust My Broom". This issue led to Johnson's enormous popularity and perceived importance in the history of the Blues. "Walkin' Blues" became a standard covered by several commercially successful artists.
Later recordings.
Artists who have recorded Walking Blues include Cee Lo Green, Muddy Waters, Colin James, Paul Butterfield, Johnny Cash, Hot Tuna, The Grateful Dead, Rory Gallagher, John Kay, R.L. Burnside, Eric Clapton, Hindu Love Gods, Ash Grunwald, Quicksilver Messenger Service, Joe Bonamassa, Peter Green Splinter Group, and Roy Rogers.

Karl Heinrich Bergius (1790–1818), also known as Carl Heinrich Bergius, was a Prussian botanist, naturalist, cavalryman and pharmacist from Küstrin. He is notable for his natural history collecting in southern Africa.
Bergius served as a cavalryman in the Prussian campaign of the Napoleonic Wars, for which he was awarded the Iron Cross. He subsequently studied pharmacy in Berlin where his botanical interests were noted by Martin Lichtenstein at the Berlin Zoological Museum.

2008 Abkhazia bombings

In June and July 2008 a series of bombings took place in Georgia's breakaway republic of Abkhazia, killing 4 and injuring 18 people.
The bombings.
June 18 Sukhumi railway bombings.
On June 18, two bombs exploded within 5 minutes of each other on the railway tracks outside Sukhumi. No one was injured as a result, though the tracks sustained minor damage.
June 29 Gagra bombings.
On June 29, two bombs exploded within 5 minutes of each other in the centre of Gagra, injuring 6. The first explosion happened close to Gagra's market, the second explosion took place near a supermarket. One 38 year old woman received shrapnel wounds to her eye and had to be treated in a Sochi hospital. One other woman had to be taken to Gagra hospital with shrapnel wounds.
June 30 Sukhumi bombings.
On June 30, two bombs exploded within 5 minutes of each other in the centre of Sukhumi, injuring 6. Both explosions happened close to Sukhumi's market. According to Abkhazian law enforcement officers, the explosive devices did not contain shrapnel-generating objects, suggesting that the aim of the explosions was terrorising the population. Four of the six injured had to be taken to the Sukhumi City Clinical Hospital.
July 2 Inguri river border crossing bombing.
On July 2, an unidentified vehicle passed the Georgian interior ministry post and approached Russian peacekeepers' post 301. At approximately 300 meter distance, an object was thrown out of the car which subsequently exploded. The vehicle then turned and drove back unhindered past the Georgian interior ministry post. No one was injured as a result of the explosion.
July 6 Gali bombing.
On July 6, at 10.58 pm, a bomb exploded in a cafe in Gali, killing 4 and injuring 6. The four people killed were Jansukh Muratia, acting chief of the Abkhazian security service's Gali department, Sukhran Gumba, employee of the border department of the Abkhazian security service, Anzor Lagvilava, interpreter of the UN Mission in Georgia in the Gali district and Iveta Toria, local resident. The six injured were taken to hospitals in Gali and Sukhumi.
Aftermath.
In response to the June 29 and 30 bombings, Abkhazia closed its border with Georgia on July 1. Residents of the Gali district who were in Georgia at that moment received three days to return.
Reactions.
Abkhazia.
The Abkhazian side accused Georgia of being behind all 7 bombings. It described the June 18 bombings as a terrorist attack against the Russian Railway Forces in Abkhazia, who had recently started repairing the Sukhumi-Ochamchira section of the Abkhazian railway, to the detriment of Georgia.
The June 29 and 30 bombings were likewise described as terrorist attacks, perpetrated with the aim of destroying the tourism season in Abkhazia. According to Ruslan Kishmaria, special representative of Abkhazian president Sergei Bagapsh to the Gali district:
“I believe the person who ordered these terrorist acts paid well for them and we should look for this person in the security services of Georgia. When Tbilisi pretends to be insulted that the Abkhaz should falsely accuse it, it’s just a game.”
In response to the July 6 Gali bombing, Predident Bagapsh accused Georgia of having chosen the way of state terrorism.
Georgia.
The Georgian side has vehemently denied the Abkhazian accusations, with Defence Minister David Kezerashvili stating that they were "not serious". Official in Tbilisi and Georgian media offered as alternative explanation that the bombings were the result of a power struggle among different criminal groups in Abkhazia. Georgian MP Nika Rurua, a deputy chairman of the parliamentary committee for defense and security, said that the blasts were aimed at “terrorizing the local population” in order to increase anti-Georgian sentiment in the region.
On July 7, the Georgian government released a statement in which it condemned the bombings and said:
“Those acts of violence are in the interests of forces hoping to prolong the presence of illegally deployed Russian military forces in Georgia; of forces resisting demilitarization and peace in the region and of those who want to derail Georgia’s European and Euro-Atlantic aspirations.”
Russian peacekeepers.
In reaction to the July 2 bombing near the Russian peacekeepers' post, Aleksander Diordiev, aide to the commander of the peacekeeping troops, accused the Georgian side, saying:
“The actions of the Georgian secret services are of a provocative nature, which aim at destabilizing the situation in the southern part of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict zone and also at provoking the peacekeepers,”
Independent observers.
In response to the Gagra bombings, Tbilisi based political analyst Paata Zakareishvili stated that she thought it unlikely that they were the result of a struggle between criminal groups. According to Zakareishvili it is plausible that the bombings were aimed to disrupt the tourist season:
"This aim was basically achieved. I think that the tourist season in Abkhazia has been wrecked. I don’t subscribe to the theory that it was some kind of business feud. If one businessman blows up another’s business, his own business also suffers, because the tourist season is the main source of revenue there."
At the same time, Zakareishvili considered the Abkhazian decision to close their border with Georgia unwise, because it would only serve to alienate the Gali district population.
Georgian call for an international police force.
In its statement made on July 7 after the Gali bombing, the Georgian government renewed its call for an international police force in the Gali and Ochamchira districts. This call found support with the United States Department of State, but was immediately rejected by the Abkhazian side.

Midtown Manhattan property owners and businesses created the Grand Central Partnership in the mid-1980s during a period of marked physical and economic deterioration. Once in place, GCP developed a comprehensive plan to specifically revitalize the neighborhood surrounding Grand Central Terminal, which included an ambitious capital improvement program, a privately managed sanitation, maintenance and public safety operation, business assistance initiatives, a broad tourism and visitor services program, and a social services component. Since its founding, GCP has made substantial contributions to the dramatic turnaround of Midtown Manhattan, and, together with the renowned restoration of Grand Central Terminal, GCP's programs are widely credited with playing a major role in transforming the neighborhood into one of the world's preeminent central business districts.
GCP's operations are managed by a board of directors and officers elected by the District Management Association, a voluntary organization made up of property owners, commercial and residential tenants in the district, as well as representatives of elected officials.
The Grand Central Partnership is a not-for-profit corporation funded principally through special assessments collected from commercial property owners located within its defined geographic area. Additional financial support is provided through corporate sponsorship of specific programs and special events and through in-kind services.

Amit Bhatia

Amit Bhatia, (born London, 1979) is a British-Indian businessman. His parents are Arun and Renu Bhatia. He has an older brother called Aneesh and a younger sister Ayesha. He is fluent in Hindi, English and Spanish. In 2004 Bhatia married Vanisha Mittal, the only daughter and second child of billionaire steel tycoon and Chairman and CEO of ArcelorMittal, Lakshmi Mittal, in a ceremony described as "lavish" and "outrageous" said to have cost as much as $78 million.
Early life.
Amit Bhatia was born into a Punjabi Indian family originally from Lahore, in London, United Kingdom. Bhatia was educated in Delhi at Columba's School until 1995, followed by Dulwich College in London, United Kingdom, in 1996, and at the British School in Delhi in 1997. Bhatia graduated from Cornell University in 2001, an Ivy League university located in Ithaca, New York, in the United States where he studied Applied Economics & Management.
Career.
Bhatia began his career briefly working in mergers and acquisitions at both Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch in New York. After that he decided to pursue charitable work in Ecuador before joining Credit Suisse First Boston in London. He then incubated Swordfish Investments, a Mayfair-based private equity fund, and Swordfish Capital Management, an investment management company. Investments included education, media, telecoms and financial services.
In 2007 Bhatia bought a stake in Queens Park Rangers FC, London, an English Premier League club and serves as its Vice-Chairman. In 2012, Bhatia admitted that his father-in-law has considered withdrawing financial support for the club which has recently been relegated from the Premier League. Football commentators and fans have expressed concerns about QPR's owners's stewardship of the club. In 2011, Bhatia resigned from QPR's board in frustration after his family's bid to buy the whole club was unsuccessful, he returned to the board a few months later.
In January 2009 he was appointed to be the Chairman of QPR in the Community Trust. In 2010, Amit set up a grant-awarding charity, called the Global Relief Initiative.
Despite initial denials he would be involved in his billionaire father-in-law's business "I'm not involved in the company and I don't ever plan to be", Bhatia was appointed by his father-in-law to be the Chairman of Hope Construction Materials, the UK’s largest independent supplier of concrete, cement, aggregates and asphalt. The company was launched in January 2013 after the divestment of 200 sites by two of the UK's biggest building materials companies, Tarmac and Lafarge. Hope’s assets include the largest cement works in the UK at Hope Valley in Derbyshire, 172 ready-mix plants, 4 rail heads, 5 major quarries, 7 national offices, a fleet of over 400 vehicles and the company employs over 800 people. The company is already a member of the World's Economic Forum's Community of Global Growth Companies (GGC) which was formed to engage dynamic high-growth companies with the potential to be tomorrow’s industry leaders and to become a driving force of economic and social change.
Charity.
In 2007, Bhatia initiated the Mittal Champions Trust, after being disappointed that Indian athletes did not have enough support to help them win gold at various championships, especially the Olympics. Lakshmi Mittal witnessed India winning one, bronze, medal in the 2000 Summer Olympics, which prompted him and Bhatia set up the charity. It sponsors Indian sportsmen with world-class potential, one of whom, Abhinav Bindra, won a gold medal at the Beijing Olympics just one year later in 2008.
Bhatia took part in a triathlon in the summer of 2009 to raise funds for the QPR in the Community Trust charity, raising over £32,000.
In 2011, Bhatia donated money to the Cornell University Library System to support its café space in the first floor of The John M. Olin Library. The café was renamed that same year to "Amit Bhatia Libe Café;" it had formerly been known as just "Libe Café".
Amit is a member of the William Pitt Group at Chatham House, which is home to the Royal Institute of International Affairs and is a world-leading source of independent analysis, informed debate and influential ideas on how to build a prosperous and secure world for all.
Awards.
Amit Bhatia was selected as the Asian Business Young Entrepreneur of the Year, in March 2013 at the Asian Business Awards. Subsequently he also won the award for the Outstanding Young Executive at the Global Business Excellence Awards.

Lauris Dārziņš

Lauris Dārziņš (born January 28, 1985 in Riga, Soviet Union) is a Latvian ice hockey player who currently plays for Dinamo Riga of Kontinental Hockey League (KHL).
Playing career.
Junior career.
Dārziņš was drafted in the 9th round, 268th overall in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft by the Nashville Predators out of the junior hockey system Finnish team Lukko Rauma. In the 2004–05 season, Dārziņš played in the North American WHL with the then-reigning Memorial Cup champion Kelowna Rockets, alongside fellow Predators prospect and 2003 draft choice Shea Weber. In two seasons with the Rockets, Dārziņš recorded 32 goals and 67 points in 90 games, helping the Rockets win the Ed Chynoweth Cup in 2005, although they failed to repeat as Memorial Cup champions.
Return to Europe.
After completing two seasons with the Rockets, Dārziņš went unsigned the Predators and opted to return to Finland in 2006, signing with Ilves Tampere of the SM-liiga. After just thirteen games, Dārziņš moved to HC Vsetín, then of the Czech Extraliga, where he again played just thirteen games, scoring three goals.
In the summer of 2007, Dārziņš signed on with HC Třinec, but played just one game for the club before latching on with HK Gomel of the Belarusian Extraleague. Dārziņš finally broke through professionally with a strong campaign for the Belarusian side, with seventeen goals and 34 points in 32 games in the 2007–08 campaign, leading the team in goals and points. This strong season garnered him some attention among stronger Eastern European clubs, and on May 27, 2008, he signed on with Russian club HC MVD of the newly re-branded Russian SuperLeague.
Dinamo Riga.
Dārziņš would never play a game for MVD, and eventually landed with the resurrected Dinamo Riga club in his hometown for the team's inaugural campaign. Dārziņš scored just eight goals and seventeen points in 56 games, and the team scored just 132 goals total, but found their way into the playoffs before getting swept in the first round by Dynamo Moscow.
Dārziņš would return to Riga in 2009–10, and enjoyed a breakout season. The winger scored fourteen goals, third-most on the team, and 31 total points in 54 games. Riga returned to the playoffs, upsetting top-seeded SKA Saint Petersburg three games to one, but falling in the second round to MVD four games to one. Dārziņš scored two goals and four points in nine playoff games.
In the spring of 2010, Dārziņš' contract with Riga expired. After being briefly linked with Russian powerhouse club Ak Bars Kazan, Dārziņš revealed that he had been in contact with scouts with the NHL club that drafted him, the Nashville Predators, about a possible return to North American hockey. At the end of the 2009–10 season, Dārziņš was the fourth-leading scorer in Riga's two-year history, with 47 points in 112 games.
Dārziņš ultimately spurned any forays into North America in favor of another season with his hometown club. He was rewarded with his best offensive totals at any level, scoring 21 goals and 23 assists in 45 games for Dinamo, leading the team in goals and points. Dārziņš was named to the 2011 KHL All-Star Game in St. Petersburg as part of Team Yashin and finished 16th in the KHL in scoring. Dinamo returned to the Gagarin Cup playoffs, with Dārziņš scoring ten points in eleven games as Riga upset Dynamo Moscow four games to two in the first round.
On May 3, 2011 Dārziņš joined Ak Bars Kazan on a multi-year contract. In June 2013 he was traded to Traktor Chelyabinsk. In January 2014 Dārziņš returned to Dinamo Riga.
International career.
Dārziņš has been a regular fixture on the Latvian national team at varying levels since 2002. At 17, he made his debut with the national team at the Division I (second tier) IIHF World U18 Championship, scoring two goals and three total points in five games. Dārziņš returned to the U18s the following year, posting one goal and two points in five games. He broke through with the Under-20 team in 2003 and would go on to play in three Division I IIHF World U20 Championships, where he would score 12 goals and 24 points in 15 games over three tournaments.
In 2006, Dārziņš made his debut with the full national team as a 21-year-old in the 2006 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships, which were held in his hometown of Riga. He has not missed the tournament since his debut, scoring nine goals and twelve points in 23 games over four tournaments.
In February 2010, Dārziņš represented Latvia at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, recording one assist in four games. At the 2014 Winter Olympics he was the leading scorer on the Latvian team with four goals and one assist in five games.

Kris Kane (born 5 December 1980 in Glasgow) is a Scottish field hockey player, who was a member of the national squad that finished 8th in the 2003 European Nations Cup in Barcelona. The goalkeeper plays for Western Wildcats, and has won five Scottish National League titles and four Scottish Cups. Kane became player coach of Western Wildcats in 2007
Kris has 49 caps and has 31 under twenty one caps for the Scottish National team.
Kris was a youth player at Rangers F.C. before a broken leg
forced him to abandon football as a career choice. His brother, Barry, was already a hockey
player and Kris took up the sport as a result.
Described by many as having an un-conventional goalkeeping style, Kane was a member of the
National team since 2001 but did not play for the national team between
2006 and 2008 after a public disagreement with then head coach Matthias Ahrens over his selection policies.
Shortly after Ahrens departure from his role as head coach it was announced that Kane had been selected for the Scottish national team once again. Kane works as a Solicitor for the Scottish Procurator Fiscal Office.

Texas Longhorns women's volleyball

Texas maintains a successful women's volleyball program, as witnessed by three National Championships - one AIAW in 1981 and two NCAA in 1988 and 2012, in addition to 25 NCAA tournament appearances out of 28 possible years.
The volleyball program was founded in 1974 and has an overall record of 967-344-14. The program has had seven coaches in its history - in 1974 the team was coached by Pam Lampley, in 1975 by Cheryl Lyman, 1976-1977 by Jody Conradt, 1978-1979 by Linda Lowery, 1980-1996 by Mick Haley, 1997-2000 by Jim Moore, and 2001-present by Jerritt Elliot.
Texas has made the NCAA final four in 1986, 1987, 1988, 1995, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2012. highlighted by NCAA championships in 1988 and 2012 and has finished in the top 25, 25 out of the last 29 years. They have captured the Big 12 title four times, in 1997, 2007, 2008, and 2009.
Year by year results.
1986-1988.
Texas made its first ever NCAA final four in 1986, coming in third place overall and finishing the year with a 29-6 record. In 1987, the team made it back to the final four, once again coming into third place and finishing the season with a 25-10 record.
In 1988, Texas broke through and won the NCAA national championship by sweeping Hawai'i 3-0. Texas became the first team in NCAA history (and, as of 2008, remains one of two schools to do so) to sweep every NCAA tournament opponent 3-0 en route to the winning NCAA championship.
1995.
Texas made it to the championship match, falling to Nebraska 3-1. In 1995, Demetria Sance became the program's first ever player to be named the National Freshman of the Year.
2007-present.
In 2007, Texas captured its second ever Big 12 title, sharing it with Nebraska and finished the conference with a 19-1 record. The 2007 squad finished off the season with a 27-4 record and made it to the NCAA regional finals as the tournament's overall 4th seed. 2007 Big 12 Freshman of the Year Juliann Faucette became the program's second ever AVCA National Freshman of the Year and earned AVCA First Team All-America honors - becoming only the fourth true freshman in 8 years to be named on first team.
In 2008, Texas shared the Big 12 title with Nebraska with an 18-2 record. The team finished 29-4 overall, making it to the NCAA Final Four, where they took a 2-0 lead on Stanford but lost the next three to lose in five games. Junior outside hitter Destinee Hooker was named to the Final Four All-Tournament Team and was also a Honda Sports Award nominee for the top volleyball player in the country. Hooker, junior Ashley Engle and senior Lauren Paolini were also named AVCA First Team All-Americans.
Led by senior Destinee Hooker, the 2009 Texas volleyball team lost just 1 regular season match to Iowa State and was ranked No. 2 in the country all season long. In the 2009 NCAA tournament, the Longhorns defeated Big-12 opponent Nebraska in the regional final, becoming the first team to ever beat Nebraska 3 times in a season. In the Final Four, the team soundly defeated Minnesota, and met No. 1 and undefeated Penn State in the final. 
Texas looked to be on the brink of a huge upset, as they went up 2 sets to 0 against the Lions. However, Penn State stormed back to push the match to a fifth set, which they eventually won, 15-13. Penn State won their third consecutive NCAA title and denied Texas its first NCAA title since 1988. Despite the loss, Destinee Hooker was named the Final Four Most Outstanding Player, as she had 34 kills in the championship match, which is the most kills by a single player in the NCAA final's history. It was also Hooker's career high in a single match, her final match as a collegiate player. Because of the high level of play by both teams throughout the long match, many people believe that it was the best NCAA final in history.
In 2012, Texas once again advanced to the NCAA Final game in which they played Oregon in the National Championship. Texas swept the Ducks, 3-0, and claimed its first National Title in volleyball since 1988, giving the University its 50th overall National Championship, 42 of which are NCAA Championships.

Giorgi Gvazava

Giorgi Gvazava () (April 23, 1869 – January 20, 1941) was a Georgian jurist, writer and politician; one of the founding members of the Georgian National Democratic Party. 
Born in the village of Nokalakevi in western Georgia, then under the Russian Empire, Gvazava’s became involved in politics early in the 1890s when he was among the organizers of the Freedom League (თავისუფლების ლიგა, "t’avisup’lebis liga"), which coordinated Georgian student groups in the universities of the empire. He also published lyrics and wrote for local press. Later, he was a founding member of the Georgian National Democratic Party, more like a group in its early days, in 1906. Centered around various newspapers, the best known of which was "klde" (კლდე; "Rock"), the party held its founding congress in June 1917, in the aftermath of the February Revolution in St. Petersburg. Gvazava was a member of the Georgian National Council and its presidium. After Georgia’s declaration of independence (May 26, 1918), Gvazava was elected to the Constituent Assembly and headed the National Democratic faction there. The 1921 Red Army invasion of Georgia forced Gvazava into exile to Paris where he died in 1941. 
Gvazava authored works on the politics and international relations of Georgia. He also translated into Georgian Sophocles’s "Antigone" (1912), "Prometheus" (1935), Crébillon’s "Rhadamiste et Zénobie" (1929), and Racine’s "Mithridate" (1934). In 1938, together with Anie Marcel-Paon, Gvazava produced a French translation in prose of the medieval Georgian epic "The Knight in the Panther's Skin" ("L'homme à la peau de léopard") by Shota Rustaveli.

History of Loughton

Loughton is a town in the county of Essex in England. The first settlement can be traced back to 2,500 years ago, but the earliest records of the modern-day site of Loughton are from the Anglo-Saxon era of English history, when it was known as "Lukintone". After the Norman conquest it became part of the estate of Waltham Abbey and is mentioned in the Domesday Book as "Lochintuna". It was during the 17th century, however, when Loughton began to grow significantly as a coaching stop on the newly created main route to Cambridge and East Anglia. With good transport links and proximity to both London and also Epping Forest and the countryside, it became a popular location for aristocratic and wealthy Londoners to have a home.
Most of the great houses from the 17th and 18th centuries have disappeared, and much of the modern-day housing in Loughton was built in the Victorian and Edwardian eras, with significant expansion of the town in the 1930s. A major factor in the town's continuing popularity was the advent of the railways in the 1850s and a direct line to central London, so that city-dwellers had easy access for day trips to Epping Forest (the line remains to this day as part of the Central line on the London Underground system). At the time, the Great Eastern Railway Company would not offer workmen's fares to and from Loughton, so development was of a middle-class character. Loughton was a fashionable place for artistic and scientific residents in Victorian and Edwardian times, and a number of prominent residents were also socialists, nonconformists, and social reformers. The north-eastern suburb of Debden is a post-war development intended to ease the chronic housing shortage in London in the 1940s. A large estate of prefabs was built along Oakwood Hill Road with occupation commencing in the summer of 1948.
Loughton today retains much of its semi-suburban character which has meant the town remains predominantly well-off and middle-class. It was given new national prominence when it was featured in the 2002 TV documentary show "Essex Wives".
Prehistory.
Loughton has a very long history of settlement. Standing on a strategic spur of high ground in Epping Forest is Loughton Camp, an Iron Age fort built about 500 BC. Loughton Camp is roughly oval, defended by a single earth rampart enclosing about . At one time, the Camp must have commanded a spectacular view down the Roding valley, but by 1872 it was covered by dense undergrowth and entirely forgotten. In that year it was re-discovered by a Mr B.H. Cowper, and excavations ten years later found Iron Age pottery within the ramparts. Camps like this were probably places of refuge and citadels rather than places to live.
Loughton Camp lies close to Ambresbury Banks, another Iron Age fortification (which is in Epping parish). Though the two forts were once thought to be sequential - Loughton Camp followed by Ambresbury - the current view is that they face each other across a watershed which was an ancient boundary line, later re-used as the boundary between Ongar and Waltham Hundreds. It is now believed that these two forts were in separate - and presumably sometimes hostile - territories, roughly equivalent to the medieval Hundreds of Ongar (Loughton Camp) and Ambresbury (Waltham). The forts may therefore have acted as very visible strategic positions, huge frontier markers, which defined the boundary between two territories.
Roman era.
There was significant Roman settlement along the Roding valley, with a minor road from London to the Roman small town at Dunmow following the course of the river. There was a settlement on the Chigwell side of the river at Little London; excavations indicate that this may have been a relay station (mutatio) where official travellers on state business could change horses and rest for the night. Little London may have been the settlement of Durolitum mentioned in the Antonine Itinerary; the name means 'the fort on the ford', which fits the geography, although the archaeological evidence has not revealed any military buildings. There was also a substantial Roman building on the Loughton side of the Roding, probably a large farmhouse.
Anglo-Saxon era.
In the 5th century, there was some continuation of Roman-style rule for a time, but Anglo-Saxon invaders quickly carved out new territories. One of these was the Kingdom of Essex. In the Loughton area, it is likely that rural life carried on much as it had always done, although the forest may have expanded as the population declined through war and plague. It was in this Saxon period that modern Loughton first began; known as "Lukintune", the place-name is Anglo-Saxon, and means ‘the farm of Luhha'. Settlement was widely scattered; Lukintune was in the area of the later Loughton Hall, and two other hamlets were around Alderton Hall ("Aelwartone" - ‘the farm of Aethelwaru’), and Debden House ("Tippedene" - ‘the valley of Tippa’)
In 1062 Harold Godwinson (later King Harold II), re-founded Waltham Abbey and Edward the Confessor granted various estates to the Abbey, which included Tippedene (Debden) and Alwartune (Alderton Hall, in Loughton). Edward the Confessor's charter of 1062 is the first written evidence of the settlement (Lukinton). The bounds of these estates are given in the charter, but have never been analysed to assess their actual geographical extent. Tippedene means 'the valley of Tippa', but by the 13th century, the original meaning had been forgotten and the estate was by then known as Dupedene, 'deep valley'.
The boundaries of the Tippedene estate survive in an Anglo-Saxon charter. One landscape feature mentioned in the charter is "saeteres burh" - robbers' camp - and this may have been the Anglo-Saxon name for Loughton Camp.
Norman era.
Following the Norman invasion, the Domesday Book, issued in 1087, gives two snapshots of life in the area, first as it was in 1066 under Edward the Confessor, and again in 1086 under William the Conqueror (here it is written as "Lochintuna"). Domesday assessed the taxability of every estate in the land, so is an extremely useful guide to the taxable population and their taxable resources. Loughton was fragmented into eight separate estates. Five were held by Waltham Abbey itself, including one they had annexed from a free man. Other landowners were Robert Gernon, Peter of Valognes (who had displaced a free Anglo-Saxon named Wulfric), and the king himself. There were a total of 88 heads of households across both Chigwell and Loughton. The land must have been well-wooded as it was said to be capable of supporting 1,870 pigs, a notional measure of the size of forest but a very large number all the same. of meadows on the 10 estates of Chigwell and Loughton may well have consisted mainly of land beside the Roding, which was fertile but liable to seasonal flooding. Livestock comprised 28 cattle, 48 sheep, and 48 pigs, as well as 15 goats. There had been a water-mill at Chigwell in 1066, but this had been abandoned by 1086.
Medieval era.
Loughton's growth since Domesday has largely been at the expense of the forest. Expansion towards the Roding was not possible over the marshy meadows, but there were gradual encroachments into the forest to the north and west of the village; it should be remembered that until recently, while the forest trees were themselves a valuable resource, the open spaces and scrub which are a natural part of any forest were simply regarded as 'waste', which ought to be taken into cultivation. Loughton landlords and villagers both saw fit to enclose and build upon forest 'waste', but the trickle of forest destruction threatened to turn into a flood in the 19th century, once royalty had lost interest in protecting the woodland as a hunting reserve, and more particularly after the railway arrived in Loughton in 1856. As the forest disappeared, some Loughton villagers defied landowners to practice their ancient right to lop wood, and the intelligentsia began to express alarm at the loss of such a significant natural resource. A series of court cases, one brought by the Loughton labourer, Thomas Willingale, was needed before Epping Forest was finally saved in 1878 for the enjoyment of everyone.
Loughton's High Road in the Middle Ages ran to Woodford to the south, but to the north, surrounded by Forest, it petered out, with footpaths running down to the Roding from Buckhurst Hill and to Chigwell. However, between 1611–1622, the High Road was extended via what is now Church Hill and Goldings Hill to Epping, and this quickly became the main coaching route from London to East Anglia. However, it remained a difficult route for horse-drawn traffic, because of steep hills, so in 1830-34 the Epping New Road was constructed. As early as 1404 the High Road was mentioned in a court action, when one John Lucteborough was prosecuted for throwing the rubbish from his ditch outside Richard Algor's gate on the King's highway. Richard Algor's house survived in part, concealed by much overbuilding, until 1963 near the junction of Algers Road and High Road. Many of Loughton's other roads are of ancient origin, such as Rectory Lane, Traps Hill, and Smarts Lane.
Loughton Hall has had a fascinating history. Mary Tudor was its owner two months before she became queen in 1553. In 1578 it passed to the Wroth family, who were prominent in public and court life; they held it until 1738. Lady Mary Wroth (1586-c1652) of Loughton Hall was a member of a glittering Jacobean literary circle and her book "Urania" was the first full-length novel to be written by an English woman. The 16th-century house, visited by James I, Anne of Denmark, Ben Jonson and Sir Robert Sidney, the younger brother of Sir Philip Sidney and the father of Mary. Sir Philip died some months before Mary Wroth was born. He therefore never visited Loughton Hall. The original Loughton Hall burnt down in a spectacular fire in 1836, to be replaced by the present building, which the Reverend J. W. Maitland had built in 1878. The Maitland family held the manor for much of the 19th century, and dominated parish life. As major landowners, they were bound up with the controversy over the future of the Forest. In 1944 the house and estate were sold to the London County Council. A London County Council estate was built on the land, which surprisingly was called the Debden estate rather than the Loughton Hall estate, and the house was given over to community use. From 1948 until the early 1950s Loughton Hall was an "Infants School" catering for 5 to 8 year olds.
Agriculture and forestry were the most important local trades until well into the 20th century. There were other industries however, on a small-scale. As the place-names Tile-Kiln Farm and Potters Close testify, there were brick, tile and pottery manufacturing sites in the area from the 15th century onwards. In Loughton, these were located on Goldings Hill, Englands Lane, Nursery Road, between Albion Hill and Warren Hill, and York Hill.
Loughton's High Road was defined for centuries by the two historic inns at either end, the Crown and the King's Head. There were a few shops in between, and a cottage or two, but the bustling shopping centre we see today has only really come about since 1918. 
However, the area was attractive to London merchants and business-people from the 17th century onwards as it provided the advantages both of a country retreat together with proximity to London; Loughton is less than from Charing Cross. But even now, this is not suburbia; the stout fences and high holly hedges of many houses recall a time not so long ago when it was necessary to keep out straying cattle and deer.
Dick Turpin (1705–1739), the notorious highwayman, made his mark in the area during his life of crime. In about 1734, the Widow Shelley, living in a farm on Traps Hill, was supposedly roasted over her own fire by Turpin until she confessed to where her money was hidden. In fact, his last spell of 'going straight' before he became a professional thief appears to have been in Buckhurst Hill, where between 1733-4 he was a butcher. The area was no doubt convenient for deer-poaching, another of his 'trades'. Fear of his ruthless style of burglary led householders in Loughton to build 'Turpin traps', heavy wooden flaps let down over the top of the stairs and jammed in place with a pole against the upstairs ceiling. Some of these survived until the middle of the 19th century.
Although in excess of 50 dwellings over 200 years old remain, most of the grand houses built in the 17th and 18th centuries have gone. These were country retreats for wealthy City merchants and courtiers, but the gradual urbanisation of the area has left few of them intact. Loughton Hall and Alderton Hall in Loughton survive. A second wave of grand Victorian edifices, built by nouveau riche industrialists and magnates, survives in better order. North Haven and Loughton Lodge are examples. Here too, though, there have been losses, such as Brooklyn in Loughton, the home of the influential Gould family, demolished to make way for Loughton Library. These houses required armies of domestic servants, which in turn attracted more people to the area.
Victorian era.
In Wright's "History of Essex" published in 1835, Loughton is described as 'distinguished by its numerous genteel houses and beautiful and picturesque scenery'.
Like other parts of Essex, Loughton also had a strong tradition of nonconformism, and the area is liberally supplied with chapels and meeting halls of varying Protestant traditions. The Baptists founded their chapel in Loughton from 1813. After a brief false start in Chigwell in 1827, Methodism came late to the area, surprising in a district so well trod by John Wesley. A chapel was established in England's Lane in 1873 by Edward Pope, while after a spell in Forest Road, Loughton, a new site was established in 1886, in High Road opposite Traps Hill. The red-brick Gothic-style church by architect Josiah Gunton, erected in 1903, was replaced in 1987 by a strikingly modern building which is quite a Loughton landmark. Congregationalists were active in Chigwell from 1804, and in Loughton shared the Baptist Chapel as a Union Church. 
Before the railways, there were regular stagecoaches from Loughton to London, and the turnpike through Loughton was an important stagecoach route through to Cambridge, Norwich, Newmarket, and other East Anglian towns.
Beyond the High Road, the arrival of the railway in 1856 spurred the town’s development. Loughton's growth was essentially infilling and expansion within an ancient village, but it was a slow process. Very roughly, the west side of the High Road being developed from about 1881 up to the First World War, and the east side largely being built up in the Edwardian and interwar periods.
The railway first came to Loughton in 1856, when the Eastern Counties Railway (later the Great Eastern Railway) opened a branch line via Woodford. This was extended in 1865 to Ongar. The loop line from Leytonstone to Woodford which takes in, inter alia, Hainault, Grange Hill, Chigwell and Roding Valley tube stations, was opened in 1903. After the Second World War, these services were electrified in stages and handed to London Transport's Central Line. Electrification was completed as far as Loughton on 21 November 1948 (including the loop line), with the section to Epping completed on 26 September 1951. After years of decline, the final section of this line, from Epping to Ongar, was closed in 1994. The arrival of the railways was undoubtedly a key factor in the growth of the area, and also provided visitors with a convenient and cheap means of reaching Epping Forest, transforming it into the "East Enders' Playground".
The railways brought a tourist boom to the forest, and Loughton's streets rang to the shouts of Cockneys making their way to the forest. Tea rooms sprang up everywhere to cater for the thirsty trippers, and at weekends hordes of cyclists poured out of London seeking the tranquility and beauty which the forest offered. The tourist invasion was not universally welcomed; the visitors were condemned by some as insanitary, irreligious, and disruptive, and Loughton was long nicknamed 'Lousy Loughton' from the lice and fleas purportedly left behind by East Enders.
The Ragged School Union began organising visits to the Forest by organised parties of poor East End children in 1891. Shortly afterwards, Loughton became the focus for their operations. Trainloads of children - with metal identity tags and locked into carriages - were brought on special trains in their thousands every summer, to be marched up Station Road and Forest Road to the Shaftesbury Retreat. The trains were paid for by Pearson's Fresh Air Fund, a charity promoted by a publishing magnate. The Retreat offered pony rides, funfair side-shows, a sit-down tea and a romp in the forest. Some local residents regarded the trips, which continued into the 1930s as a nuisance, and local streets and parts of the forest were sprayed with disinfectant after the children had passed through!
Twentieth century.
Direct omnibus services linked Loughton to London from 1915. The old No. 10 route from Victoria to Abridge via Loughton survived until 1976 (a modern derivative, paid for by Essex County Council, again numbered 10, linked Loughton and Abridge until 2007), and the No. 20 service from Leyton to Epping survives, though it has terminated in Loughton since 1976 and now only runs from Walthamstow to Debden. The No. 167 route runs from Debden to Ilford.
During the First World War, anti-aircraft positions were located in Epping Forest as part of the wider defences of London, but action was minor compared to the Second World War. There are however residents still alive who recall hearing the Silvertown explosion in 1917, when a TNT factory in the Royal Docks blew up killing 73 people. The sound of the blast could be heard from The Wash to Brighton.
On the very first day of the Blitz, 7 September 1940 ("Black Saturday"), a Hurricane from 303 Squadron crashed onto an air-raid shelter in Roding Road, killing three occupants. The Polish pilot bailed out, and was promptly arrested as he could speak virtually no English. Also killed by "friendly fire" was PC Albert Hinds, blown up outside Loughton Police Station by a shell from an anti-aircraft battery in Nursery Road. Two A.R.P. men nearby died later from their injuries. A memorial plaque placed on the police station in 2005 commemorates all Loughton's civilian war dead; it is one of very few UK civilian war memorials. Even before the Blitz had begun, there was sporadic German bombing; two people were killed in The Drive on 26 July 1940, the first fatalities of the war in the London Civil Defence Region. In a 1941 raid, farms were damaged in Loughton and Debden, while a gun battery at Loughton Hall was hit, killing a soldier. At Staples Road Schools, the white-painted air-raid shelter directions are still clearly visible: CASUALTY ENTRANCE - THROUGH AIRLOCK BY SANDBAGS. Staples Road school had until 2006 the unique distinction of having amongst its alumni both the Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw, and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, Mike Gapes.
There has been much post-war rebuilding and infilling; the church of St. Edmund of Canterbury, in Traps Hill, is an example of modern church architecture, built in 1958 following a disastrous fire in an earlier building. Another notable modern church is Loughton Methodist Church, opened in 1987. The Victorian St Mary's Church has had a foyer and modern hall attached in 2008 and all the pews removed. The police station was rebuilt in 1963/64. There has also been some post-war rebuilding of High Road shops, notably Centric Parade, which dates from 1983, but is effectively a new facade built on to the former London Cooperative Society supermarket, one of the largest in the UK when opened in 1962, with roof-top car park. The M11 motorway linking London to Cambridge passes very close to Loughton; this part of the motorway was opened in 1977. Light industrial units proliferated along the Roding valley between 1975–2000, notably in Langston Road where the Bank of England printing works is located. The printing works were taken over by De La Rue in 2003 when the company won the contract to print and supply UK banknotes. The headquarters of the UK greeting cards company Clinton Cards is also located in Langston Road.
From 1900 to 1933, Loughton was governed by the Loughton Urban District Council. From 1933 to 1974 it was part of the Chigwell Urban District together with Buckhurst Hill and Chigwell. Since 1996, Loughton has had its own town council.

When the German bombs landed in the Drive on 26 July 1940 killing two people, the German air force were not aiming for the drive, their target was Loughton Station and the sidings, indeed the station was damaged probably from the same stick of bombs that landed in the Drive with such sad consequences. A bomb landed at the station damaging part of the track, platform and some seating area. above these seats were the enamel 'Loughton' signs, the sign on the blast side was damaged beyond recognition, but the sign on the leeward side survived with minor damage. this sign was saved by the station master and put into a maintenance cupboard on the station. Later the station master took the sign home as it was going to be scrapped. This information came from the station master's son in 1985.

The Fading

The Fading is an Israeli based melodic death/thrash metal band, founded in 2000 under the name Excessum. The band released two EPs before winning the Wacken Open Air Metal Battle contest, earning them a contract with Wacken Records, where they released their debut album "In Sin We'll Find Salvation" on August 3, 2009.
Band history.
The band started writing materials and playing together in 2000 by vocalist Ilia Badrov and guitarist Boris Aranovich. For several years, the line-up was in constant change while the band was looking for the right musicians for them. Finally Boris recruited his younger brother Arie Aranovich (then only 14 years old). He has joined as the lead guitarist, while Itamar Cohen joined on drums and Maor Bitton on the bass. Boris was replaced by Leon Notik (previously in Arafel) on the guitars after 2002. Some more time passed and Itamar could not continue with the band, and Nadav Luzia took his place for a while. Not after long, Nadav and Maor were both replaced by drummer Shaked Furman and bassist Elad Manor.
In 2005 the band entered the studio with producer Daniel Varfolomeyev (Acropolis) to record their debut EP "Instruction for Self Destruction". By the time the recording and mixing of the EP has finished, Leon was replaced by Jonathan Bar-Ilan (of Dissonant).
In spring 2007, the band entered Jonathan's studio to record the promotional EP "Chaos in Flesh". Produced by Jonathan himself and mixed by Swedish musician and producer Jonas Kjellgren (Scar Symmetry, Carnal Forge) at his own Black Lounge Studio, "Chaos in Flesh" featured 3 crushing new tracks and 2 re-recorded and improved versions of tracks taken from "Instruction for Self Destruction".<br>
After Jonathan finished his job producing the new recording, he left the band. His position was taken by Paul Mitiyanine (Arafel, Deface).
Since then, The Fading have been playing in many venues around Israel with leading Israeli acts like Betzefer, Whorecore, Eternal Gray, etc.
On May 22, 2008, the band participated in the Israeli Wacken Metal Battle competition in which the participating bands competed over a place at the WET stage at the annual Wacken Open Air festival, the biggest heavy metal festival in the world.<br>
The Fading competed against such bands as Acropolis, Breorn, Sexes and Vipress and won.
On August 1, 2008, the band represented Israel at the Wacken Metal Battle competition, competing against other European countries. This is a rare achievement for Israel as the band is the second Israeli band ever to perform at Wacken Open Air after doom/death veterans Orphaned Land in 2006.
On August 2, 2008, at the end of the Wacken festival it was announced that The Fading are the winners of the Wacken Metal Battle competition. The band won an international record deal with Wacken Records, and new instruments from the Metal Battle sponsors, as well as invitations to play more European festivals in the upcoming year.

On November 26, 2010, the band released their first music video for the single "The Sin Collector" off their debut album "In Sin We'll Find Salvation".
In December 2010, the band went on another short European tour, playing mainly UK dates supporting The Rotted and Desecration, and the Bang Your Head Festival in Esch-sur-Alzette, Luxembourg. This followed a 3-date Israeli tour co-headlining with The Rotted in Tel Aviv, Haifa and Jerusalem, and featuring Israeli support bands.
On May 5, 2011, the band played as a supporting act for Misery Index on their one-off show at the Sublime club in Tel Aviv, Israel.

Glen Moffatt

Glen Moffatt is a New Zealand country music singer-songwriter who relocated to Brisbane, Australia, in 2002.
Moffatt was born in Hastings and raised in Napier. He was a newspaper journalist before moving to Auckland at the end of 1991.
New Zealand music historian John Dix wrote of New Zealand music in the 1990s, "It wasn't all alt.rock, hip hop and hard rock in the '90s. Country rock survived with recording acts like the Coalrangers (from the wild West Coast), Glen Moffatt, Ritchie Pickett, the Renderers and the Waltons. The most successful were the Warratahs, signed to Pagan."
Moffatt's 1995 debut album "Somewhere in New Zealand Tonight" was described by "New Zealand Herald" music critic Graham Reid as the "birth of a Kiwi classic". It was a finalist in country album of the year at the 1996 New Zealand recording industry awards. Moffatt was also a finalist in the rising star and songwriter of the year categories.
In 1998 he released follow-up "A Place to Play", of which Reid wrote, "Moffatt has written his name large again and is, after two strong showings, a talent too big to ignore". In 2001, as Glen Moffatt Band, came his final New Zealand album "If That's What You Want".
Moffatt moved to Queensland in 2002, forming a band called Glen Moffatt & the Tallboys, and in 2007 he began working with long-time Brisbane band The Smokin' Crawdads. He sang six tracks on the Smokin' Crawdads album "Straight to the Pool Room", which featured Sydney violinist Ian Cooper and was launched at the 2010 Tamworth country music festival.
SDL Music (Scoop de Loop) released the compilation "Troubadours - NZ Singer/Songwriter Series: Vol 1" in 2009 containing eight songs each from Moffatt, Al Hunter and Red McKelvie.
Moffatt's songs have appeared on albums by Bill Chambers, Ritchie Pickett and Dennis Marsh.

Politics of Loughton

Loughton in Essex, England, was an urban district from 1900-1933, when it became part of Chigwell Urban District until 1974, when Epping Forest was created. Loughton Town Council was established in 1996. The Town Council consists of 22 Councillors representing seven wards, elected for a four-year term.
Loughton is politically diverse and somewhat heterodox. The Urban District Council was not elected under party affiliations, but was largely shared by those of Conservative and Liberal backgrounds; conservatives generally after 1933. In 1981, the LRA was formed to protest against what was said to be a planning decision taken improperly behind closed doors. During the 1980s, the LRA ousted the previous conservative-held seats in Loughton with the exception of the eastern part of the town. Since 2000 the Town Council has largely been dominated by independent Loughton Residents Association Councillors. In the period between 1950 and 2004, the Labour Party predominated in the east of the town, but lost all their District seats there to the BNP in 2004-06.
At district council level, Loughton is represented by two Councillors from each of the 7 wards, one elected in every even year for a four-year term. After the 2008 elections, six of these were from the Loughton Residents Association, four British National Party, three Conservative and one Independent. However, at the 2010 elections, LRA made substantial gains, deposing a Conservative party cabinet member in one ward, one further Conservative, and three candidates from the British National Party, reducing that organisation to a lone member. This achievement was all the more notable in that it was held on the same day as a General Election which gave rise to huge Conservative gains nationally, and the defection in April of an LRA Councillor to the Conservatives. In the 2012 election, when seven district seats were contested, a further two seats were won by the LRA, one gained from the Conservatives and one from the BNP, whose incumbent candidate polled only 94 votes. The composition of district members from Loughton was thus LRA 12, Conservative 1, and independent 1, and the BNP lost all representation in the town.
At county council level, Loughton is split. One division (Central) is entirely within Loughton, the others are combined with wards from neighbouring towns, Buckhurst Hill & Loughton South, Chigwell & Loughton Broadway. Each returns one councillor elected for a four-year term. In the 2013 Essex County Council election, Loughton Central division was won by Dr Chris Pond (Independent Loughton Residents Association), Chigwell & Loughton Broadway division by John Knapman (Conservative), and Buckhurst Hill & Loughton South by Valerie Metcalfe (Conservative). These persons had also been elected in 2009.
Loughton forms part of the Epping Forest parliamentary constituency, which is regarded as a safe Conservative seat.

Keir Graff

Keir Graff (born 1969) is an American novelist and literary editor.
Biography.
Graff was born and raised in Missoula, Montana. He has had four novels published and is also the editor of Booklist Online, a publication of the American Library Association that consists chiefly of book reviews. He currently resides in Chicago.
Career.
Graff moved to Chicago, Illinois in 1996. After quitting his job in 1997 to go on "wife support," he wrote and tried to sell screenplays before finding more success as a freelance writer. In 2001 he accepted a position as editorial assistant at Booklist. In 2005 Graff was named senior editor of the newly created Booklist Online. Other books soon followed under his real name: "My Fellow Americans" (2007), "One Nation Under God" (2008), and "The Price of Liberty" (2010). Graff's first children's book, "The Other Felix", will be published in fall 2011.
Reviews.
Critical response to Graff's novels has been mixed at times but appears to be improving. Reviewing "My Fellow Americans", "Library Journal" wrote that "Graff . . . has a light but sure hand. Jason's harrowing adventures, perfectly paced and leavened by touches of humor, are gripping from start to finish." "Publishers Weekly" disagreed: "While many thoughtful observers have wondered whether the war on terror will cost the U.S. its soul, Graff barely scratches the surface of the challenging ideas his intriguing conceit presents." "Publishers Weekly" was also critical of "One Nation, Under God", calling it "unconvincing fictional effort to paint the extreme religious right as a major threat." The "Chicago Sun-Times", however, noted that " . . . One Nation evokes such paranoid 1970s thrillers as "The Parallax View" and "Six Days of the Condor"." 
Reviews of "The Price of Liberty" were positive, with "Library Journal" calling it "another winner" and "Publishers Weekly" concluding "Graff's cynical take on government waste and corporate greed plays well.". Other review sources offered praise, including "ForeWord" ("Graff's writing keeps the reader anxious for the next scene."), the "Chicago Sun-Times" ("Other contemporary thriller writers resort to the exotic and outlandish to sustain their narrative, but Graff builds suspense around real people in the real world."), Blogcritics.org ("a first-class thriller that sweeps the reader along on a bouncy, jarring ride", and more.
Awards.
Graff was named a finalist for the Society of Midland Authors Fiction Prize in 2011, for his book "The Price of Liberty".

Ladyhawke (musician)

Phillipa Margaret "Pip" Brown (born 13 July 1979), better known by her stage name Ladyhawke, is a New Zealand singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. She took her stage name from Richard Donner's 1985 film "Ladyhawke".
Brown was part of the Wellington-based band Two Lane Blacktop (2001–2003), named for the 1971 road film of the same name. After moving to Australia, she formed the Sydney-based art rock band Teenager in 2004 with Nick Littlemore of Pnau (and later Empire of the Sun). In 2007 she relocated to London.
Her debut album, "Ladyhawke", was released on 22 September 2008 on Modular Recordings and topped the RIANZ Albums Chart. The singles "Paris Is Burning" and "My Delirium" became her best known songs. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2009, Ladyhawke won Breakthrough Artist in both album and single categories. Her second album "Anxiety" was released in May 2012.
Early life.
Phillipa Margaret Brown was born on 13 July 1979 in Masterton, a town in the Wairarapa Region of New Zealand.] She came from a musical family, with her mother being a singer–guitarist and her stepfather, a jazz drummer. During her childhood, various illnesses and allergies kept her in and out of hospital. At age ten she contracted erysipeloid, a disease that is common in seagulls but had not been seen in humans in New Zealand for twenty years. Her allergies to antibiotics, penicillin and antihistamines greatly complicated treatment efforts and almost put her into a coma, and she came close to dying.
Brown has been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. She believes that the large amount of her childhood she spent absorbed in music, be it listening to the radio or to her mother's Beatles and Pretenders albums, was attributable to this syndrome.
While attending Chanel College, she played in several grunge bands. After high school, Brown moved from Masterton to Wellington.
Recording career.
Two Lane Blacktop.
In 2001 in Wellington, Brown formed the band Two Lane Blacktop with some friends, playing lead guitar. She described the group as being "like Iggy and The Stooges meets The Clash". She cites her experience playing the notorious New York City club CBGB with Two Lane Blacktop as being a defining moment. In 2003 Two Lane Blacktop disbanded when their lead singer, Matt Harrop, and drummer, Phil Smiley, both quit the band two days prior to a scheduled tour of Australia with Modey Lemon, after which they were due to play at SXSW in Austin, Texas. Brown then made the impulsive decision to take her flight to Australia anyway, and she relocated to Melbourne.
Teenager.
Some time after Brown's move to Melbourne, Sydney-based musician Nick Littlemore of Pnau (he later formed Empire of the Sun) heard of her relocation and asked her if she was interested in joining an art rock band he had started called Teenager. Brown liked Littlemore's music and, in 2004, decided to join. Brown and Littlemore played together for two years, with Brown relocating to Sydney to be closer to the band, as well as other people she enjoyed playing and writing music with. Teenager's song "Pony" is featured in the 2008 video game "Grand Theft Auto IV".
Teenager issued their debut album, "Thirteen", as well as the related singles "Pony" and "Bound and Gagged", in 2006. "Mess + Noise"s Craig Mathieson described the album as "a pop record, albeit a particularly exotic species that equally suggests creative guile and hints of self-indulgence ... 'Pony' is the closest the album comes to cheap genre holidaying, approximating rock attitude when the organic and desperate growth of 'Bound And Gagged' is so much more impressive". Brown and Littlemore co-wrote "Alone Again" and "West" for Teenager. Soon after the album's appearance Brown left to concentrate on her career as Ladyhawke, she later credited Littlemore:
Solo career.
Still close with Littlemore, Brown decided to leave Teenager to focus on a personal project she had been developing for some time, a persona she had dubbed Ladyhawke. She named herself so after a character played by Michelle Pfeiffer in the 1985 film of the same name because she sees herself as "a sort of pop superwoman creating radio-friendly songs with a single bound". Brown says she started Ladyhawke out of a desire to do her own project where she could completely express herself in any way she wanted. She says: "I wanted to make music that could put a smile on peoples faces and give them a feeling of nostalgia even though they may be hearing my songs for the first time. I love how music evokes memories of a certain time, I wanted to see if I could find a method of songwriting that would evoke those feelings from me on writing the song and then on the individual when listening to it for the first time."
Ladyhawke's eponymous debut album "Ladyhawke" was released on 22 September 2008 by Modular Recordings. The album topped the albums chart in New Zealand one year after its release, in October 2009, and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand for sales in excess of 15,000 copies. In both Australia and the United Kingdom, it reached number sixteen, and was certified gold. Its biggest hit single was "My Delirium", which charted inside the top ten in both New Zealand and Australia.
Ladyhawke appeared for the first time in a Triple J Hottest 100 with two entries in the 2008 countdown; "My Delirium" at number eleven and "Paris Is Burning" at number twenty-six. Pnau's song "Embrace", which features Ladyhawke, was voted in at number twelve. Brown was nominated for an NME Award for Best Solo Artist.
A limited 7-inch version of "Back of the Van"—each one hand painted by Sarah Larnach—was sold on eBay. All proceeds were given to the Parkinsons Society of New Zealand.
In August 2009 it was announced that she would co-headline a North American tour with Ida Maria, starting 10 September in Atlanta and concluding 3 October in Los Angeles. The tour was sponsored by celebrity blogger Perez Hilton.
In April 2011, Ladyhawke stated that she was preparing to release new material in the following months. Her second album was initially scheduled for an October 2011 release, but in September, a spokesperson stated that it was not due to be released until 2012. It was later announced that the album was due for release in March 2012, and that it would be titled "Anxiety". "Anxiety"'s release date was later pushed back to May 2012.
In an interview with Digital Spy, Ladyhawke said "I've made an album I'm really proud of, so I just can't wait to start playing with the band again, and touring and having some fun. I can't wait to get back into it."
"Black White & Blue" was released as "Anxiety"'s lead single on 24 January 2012. The single "Sunday Drive" followed in April, and the album itself was released in late May. In July 2012, a third single, "Blue Eyes", was released.
On 28 March 2013 via her Instagram, she announced she would return to the studio to record her third solo album.
In February 2014, her song "Blue Eyes" is used in a series of new Verizon commercials in the United States. 
Collaborations.
Ladyhawke collaborated with Pnau on "Embrace" from the duo's 2007 self-titled album, one of their best-known songs.
The Charlatans' Tim Burgess said in September 2010 that he is collaborating with Ladyhawke and members of The Horrors and Klaxons on his second solo album. "I've been working with Josh the guitarist from The Horrors and Stefan [Halperin, the drummer from the Klaxons and right now we can only do stuff when our other bands aren't doing things. But when we do get together, it's really explosive and it'll be well worth waiting for. I've also got Ladyhawke singing on it." In December 2011, Burgess revealed that he had collaborated with Ladyhawke on a song entitled "Just One Kiss".
In 2011, Ladyhawke collaborated with New Zealand singer Nik Brinkman, better known as Junica, on the single "Living in My House". Also in 2011, she remixed American singer Alex Winston's song "Sister Wife".
Influences and comparisons.
Brown has a contralto vocal range. Ladyhawke is noted as being influenced by 1980s music. She has been linked to a wave of 1980s-influenced, individualistic, androgynous female musicians in their twenties who emerged in the late 2000s.
Brown also draws inspiration from music of the '90s. "Listening to Nirvana takes me back to being fourteen at the school disco. Bands from the nineties have that effect on me."
Peaches, to whom Ladyhawke's music has been compared, remixed the single "Paris Is Burning", and the two have performed together, with Peaches taking DJ duties. Ladyhawke's music has also been likened to that of Cyndi Lauper, Pat Benatar, Kim Wilde, Annie and New Young Pony Club.
Brown has stated that her five favourite albums of all time are "Hunky Dory" (1971) by David Bowie, "Time" (1981) by ELO and three Fleetwood Mac albums: "Fleetwood Mac" (it is unclear whether she was referring to the 1968 album or the 1975 album), "Rumours" (1977), and "Tango in the Night" (1987).
Other pursuits.
Ladyhawke appeared as herself in the third episode of the British ITV2 sitcom "FM", originally aired 11 March 2009. Also in 2009, Ladyhawke designed Music Inspired Art labels for limited edition bottles of Beck's. Labels were illustrated by Sydney-based artist Sarah Larnach, who lived with Ladyhawke back when she was first getting started on her music career.
Personal life.
Brown dresses in men's and boys' clothing. She likes wearing hoodies, tight jeans and big boots. Her jeans are slung low enough to reveal boys' underwear. She said, "I don't wear women's clothes because I'd feel like a fraud. It's not just that the cut is all wrong on me, I feel much more of an individual in menswear." She feels that "I don't lose any aspect of my femininity by wearing boys' clothes".
Brown is a fan of video games, describing herself as "a big, big gamer".

Coronado Apartments

The Coronado Apartments are an apartment building located on 3751-73 Second Avenue (on the corner of Second and Selden) in Detroit, Michigan. It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1980 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.
History.
The Coronado Apartments were built in 1894 by George D. Nutt, a prominent Detroit builder, and the architectural firm of Mortimer Smith and Son. The building was one of the first apartment buildings in Detroit built for affluent middle class citizens at a time when apartment living was just becoming socially acceptable. The Coronado remained a fashionable address until the 1930s, when declining demand for large apartments, and increased demand for smaller units, led the Coronados owners to divide the formerly spacious apartments in two. No further renovation was done until 1982, when the owners began a restoration and remodeling project.
Architecture.
The Coronado is a four-story Romanesque apartment building built on a high basement. It is constructed of yellow brick and rusticated sandstone with a flat roof and architecturally designed elevations on both the Second and Selden avenues sides. The Second Avenue façade is primarily symmetrical, with three entrances and open loggias on the floors above each. The façade is terminated at the south end by a curved bay window and at the north (Selden) corner by a round turret. The building is divided horizontally, with rusticated sandstone forming the outer walls up through the second story, and yellow brick above. A broad cornice and wide panelled brick frieze, pierced with ventilation holes, tops the building.

Vim script

Vim script is the scripting language built into Vim. Based on the ex editor language of the original vi editor, early versions of Vim added commands for control flow and function definitions. Since version 7, Vim script also supports more advanced data types such as lists and dictionaries and (a simple form of) object-oriented programming. Built-in functions such as map() and filter() allow a basic form of functional programming, but Vim script does not have lambda; Vim script is mostly written in an imperative programming style.
Vim macros can contain a sequence of "normal-mode" commands, but can also invoke ex commands or functions written in Vim script for more complex tasks. Almost all extensions (called plugins or more commonly scripts) of the core Vim functionality are written in Vim script, but plugins can also utilize other interpreted languages like Perl, Python, Lua, or Ruby (if support for them is compiled into the Vim binary).
Vim script files are stored in plain text format and the file name extension is .vim.
Example.
<syntaxhighlight lang="vim">
" This is a simple while loop in Vim script.
let i = 1
while i < 5
endwhile
</syntaxhighlight>
Libraries.
There are libraries for Vim script available on http://www.vim.org/ as Vim plugins.

Nick Hundley

Nicholas John "Nick" Hundley (born September 8, 1983) is an American professional baseball catcher with the San Diego Padres of Major League Baseball.
Early life.
Hundley was born in Corvallis, Oregon to Pam and Tim Hundley. He grew up with his brother, Jake, and they would play catch with their father when he came home from his job as an American football assistant coach with Oregon State. When their father was late, Hundley would pressure his mom to fill in.
As a 12-year-old Hundley played on the Santa Clarita Mudcats. Other Mudcats alumni include Ryan Braun and James Shields. Hundley played baseball for Lake Washington High School and was drafted in the 5th round of the 2002 Major League Baseball draft by the Florida Marlins but opted to attend college instead.
College career.
Hundley played three seasons with the University of Arizona Wildcats and was named by "Baseball America" to the second All-America team in 2005.
Professional career.
Hundley was drafted in 2005 by the San Diego Padres in the second round.
Minor Leagues.
Hundley began 2006 with the Class-A Fort Wayne Wizards and was promoted in July to the High-A Lake Elsinore Storm. He played all of 2007 with the Double-A San Antonio Missions, batting .247 with 20 home runs. He began 2008 with the Triple-A Portland Beavers where he batted .189 through May, but raised his average to .232 before his call-up on July 3. He also threw out 38% of base stealers in his 57 games.
Major Leagues.
2008.
Hundley was called up to the majors for the first time on July 3, 2008, when Michael Barrett suffered a season-ending injury. Hundley moved into the role of primary catcher, backed up by Josh Bard and Luke Carlin. On July 26, 2008, he hit his first career home run against the Pittsburgh Pirates.
2009.
Based on his performance in 60 games in 2008, Hundley went to spring training in 2009 as the Padres starting catcher. During the season he was mentored by back-up Henry Blanco, but he missed approximately 50 games from late June to early August due to a wrist injury.
2010.
In 2010, Hundley shared catching duties with Yorvit Torrealba, appearing in 85 games and batting .249 with 8 homers.
2011.
In 2011, Hundley was the Padres primary catcher, but he lost significant playing time to an oblique injury and elbow surgery. Against the Florida Marlins on August 21, 2011, he hit his fifth triple of the season, tying the Padres single season record for triples by a catcher set by Benito Santiago in 1990. It was also Hundley's fourth triple in his last six games. Hundley finished the season with a .288/.347/.477 batting line and 9 home runs in 281 at-bats, career highs in all categories at the time. Behind the plate, he threw out 36% of runners trying to steal.
2012.
On March 20, 2012, Hundley signed a long term contract with the Padres that would keep him in San Diego through 2014 with a club option for 2015, which is the first year Hundley will be eligible for free agency. After a prolonged slump at the start of the 2012 season, Hundley was optioned to Triple-A Tucson on June 30, and catcher Yasmani Grandal was recalled. At the time, Hundley was hitting only .166 with three home runs, 22 RBIs, and 50 strikeouts in 55 games with San Diego. Hundley batted .190 in 13 games in Triple-A and spent time on the disabled list with a strained hamstring before returning to the Padres on August 9. He played in only three more games before a torn meniscus in his right knee forced him to the disabled list and eventually required surgery, ending his season. Hundley said that he had injured the knee in a game in April when he was trying to recover a pitch in the dirt and got tangled with the umpire. Manager Bud Black believes the injury contributed to Hundley's poor season at the plate. He ended the season with a .157 average in 204 at-bats.
2013.
Hundley opened 2013 as the Padres primary catcher as Grandal was serving a 50-game suspension for using performance-enhancing drugs. Hundley stirred up some controversy in May when he made remarks about Grandal's steroid use in an interview, but the two reportedly settled the issue. Hundley and Grandal briefly shared catching duties until Grandal suffered a season-ending injury on July 6. Hundley returned to the primary catching role and finished the season with a career-high 102 starts behind the plate. He also set career highs in at-bats (373), hits (87), doubles (19), and home runs (13). He put up a .233/.290/.389 batting line and threw out 26% of base stealers.
Personal life.
Hundley's father, Tim, is an assistant football coach and is currently the safeties coach for the UNLV Rebels football team in Las Vegas, Nevada.
Hundley and his wife Amy gave birth to their first child, a daughter, on August 15, 2013.

<doc id="18287344" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18287344" title="Degrowth">
Degrowth

Degrowth (in French: "décroissance", in Spanish: "decrecimiento", in Italian: "decrescita") is a political, economic, and social movement based on ecological economics and anti-consumerist and anti-capitalist ideas. It is also considered an essential economic strategy responding to the limits-to-growth dilemma (see "The Path to Degrowth in Overdeveloped Countries" and Post growth). Degrowth thinkers and activists advocate for the downscaling of production and consumption—the contraction of economies—arguing that overconsumption lies at the root of long term environmental issues and social inequalities. Key to the concept of degrowth is that reducing consumption does not require individual martyring and a decrease in well-being. Rather, 'degrowthists' aim to maximize happiness and well-being through non-consumptive means—sharing work, consuming less, while devoting more time to art, music, family, culture and community.
Background.
The movement arose from concerns over the perceived consequences of the productivism and consumerism associated with industrialist societies (whether capitalist or socialist) including:
Resource depletion.
As economies grow, the need for resources grows accordingly. There is a fixed supply of non-renewable resources, such as petroleum (oil), and these resources will inevitably be depleted. Renewable resources can also be depleted if extracted at unsustainable rates over extended periods. For example, this has occurred with caviar production in the Caspian Sea. There is much concern as to how growing demand for these resources will be met as supplies decrease.
Many organizations and governments look to energy technologies such as biofuels, solar cells, and wind turbines to meet the demand gap after peak oil. Others have argued that none of the alternatives could effectively replace versatility and portability of oil. Authors of the book "Techno-Fix" criticize technological optimists for overlooking the limitations of technology in solving agricultural and social challenges arising from growth. 
Proponents of degrowth argue that decreasing demand is the only way of permanently closing the demand gap. For renewable resources, demand, and therefore production, must also be brought down to levels that prevent depletion and are environmentally healthy. Moving toward a society that is not dependent on oil is seen as essential to avoiding societal collapse when non-renewable resources are depleted. "But degrowth is not just a quantitative question of doing less of the same, it is also and, more fundamentally, about a paradigmatic re-ordering of values, in particular the (re)affirmation of social and ecological values and a (re)politicisation of the economy".
Ecological footprint.
The ecological footprint is a measure of human demand on the Earth's ecosystems. It compares human demand with planet Earth's ecological capacity to regenerate. It represents the amount of biologically productive land and sea area needed to regenerate the resources a human population consumes and to absorb and render harmless the corresponding waste.
According to a 2005 Global Footprint Network report, inhabitants of high-income countries live off of 6.4 global hectares (gHa), while those from low-income countries live off of a single gHa. For example, while each inhabitant of Bangladesh lives off of what they produce from 0.56 gHa, a North American requires 12.5 gHa. Each inhabitant of North America uses 22.3 times as much land as a Bangladeshi. Of the 12.5 hectares used by the North American, 5.5 is located in the United States, and the rest is found in foreign countries. According to the same report, the average number of global hectares per person was 2.1, while current consumption levels have reached 2.7 hectares per person.
In order for the world's population to attain the living standards typical of European countries, the resources of between three and eight planet Earths would be required. In order for world economic equality to be achieved with the current available resources, rich countries would have to reduce their standard of living through degrowth. The eventual reduction of all available resources would lead to a forced reduction in consumption. Controlled reduction of consumption would reduce the trauma of this change. 
Degrowth and sustainable development.
Degrowth thought is in opposition to all forms of productivism (the belief that economic productivity and growth is the purpose of human organization). It is, thus, opposed to the current form of sustainable development. While the concern for sustainability does not contradict degrowth, sustainable development is rooted in mainstream development ideas that aim to increase capitalist growth and consumption. Degrowth therefore sees sustainable development as an oxymoron, as any development based on growth in a finite and environmentally stressed world is seen as inherently unsustainable.
Critics of degrowth argue that a slowing of economic growth would result in increased unemployment and increase poverty. Many who understand the devastating environmental consequences of growth still advocate for economic growth in the South, even if not in the North. But, a slowing of economic growth would fail to deliver the benefits of degrowth—self-sufficiency, material responsibility—and would indeed lead to decreased employment. Rather, degrowth proponents advocate for a complete abandonment of the current (growth) economic system, suggesting that relocalizating and abandoning the global economy in the Global South would allow people of the South to become more self-sufficient and would end the overconsumption and exploitation of Southern resources by the North.
"The rebound effect".
Technologies designed to reduce resource use and improve efficiency are often touted as sustainable or green solutions. However, degrowth warns about these technological advances due to the "rebound effect". This concept is based on observations that when a less resource-exhaustive technology is introduced, behaviour surrounding the use of that technology may change, and consumption of that technology could increase or even offset any potential resource savings. In light of the rebound effect, proponents of degrowth hold that the only effective 'sustainable' solutions must involve a complete rejection of the growth paradigm and a move toward a degrowth paradigm.
Origins of the movement.
The contemporary degrowth movement can trace its roots back to the anti-industrialist trends of the 19th century, developed in Great Britain by John Ruskin, William Morris and the Arts and Crafts Movement (1819–1900), in the United States by Henry David Thoreau (1817–1862), and in Russia by Leo Tolstoy (1828–1911).
The concept of "degrowth" proper appeared during the 1970s, proposed by the Club of Rome think tank and intellectuals such as Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, Jean Baudrillard, André Gorz, Edward Goldsmith and Ivan Illich, whose ideas reflect those of earlier thinkers, such as the economist E. J. Mishan, the industrial historian Tom Rolt, and the radical socialist Tony Turner. The writings of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and J. C. Kumarappa also contain similar philosophies, particularly regarding his support of voluntary simplicity.
More generally, degrowth movements draw on the values of humanism, enlightenment, anthropology and human rights.
The Club of Rome reports.
In 1968, the Club of Rome, a think tank headquartered in Winterthur, Switzerland, asked researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for a report on practical solutions to problems of global concern. The report, called "The Limits to Growth", published in 1972, became the first important study that indicated the ecological perils of the unprecedented economic growth the world was experiencing at the time.
The reports (also known as the Meadows Reports) are not strictly the founding texts of the movement, as they only advise zero growth, and have also been used to support the sustainable development movement. Still, they are considered the first official studies explicitly presenting economic growth as a key reason for the increase in global environmental problems such as pollution, shortage of raw materials, and the destruction of ecosystems. A second report was published in 1974, and together with the first, drew considerable attention to the topic.
Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen's thesis.
The Romanian economist Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen is considered the creator of degrowth, and its main theoretician. In 1971, he published a book called "The Entropy Law and the Economic Process", in which he noted that the neoclassical economic model did not take into account the second law of thermodynamics, by not accounting for the degradation of energy and matter (i.e. increase in entropy). He associated every economic activity with an increase in entropy, whose increase implied the loss of useful resources. When a selection of his articles was translated into French in 1979 under the title "Demain la décroissance" ("tomorrow, degrowth"), it spurred the creation of the movement in France.
Serge Latouche.
Serge Latouche, a professor of economics at the Paris-Sud 11 University, has noted that:
Schumacher and Buddhist economics.
E. F. Schumacher's 1973 book "Small is Beautiful" predates a unified degrowth movement, but nonetheless serves as an important basis for degrowth ideas. In this book he critiques the neo-liberal model of economic development, noting the absurdity of increasing "standard of living", which is based solely on consumption, as the primary goal of economic activity and development. Instead, under what he refers to as Buddhist economics, we should aim to maximize well-being while minimizing consumption.
Ecological and social issues.
In January 1972 Edward Goldsmith and Robert Prescott-Allen—editors of "The Ecologist" journal—published the "Blueprint for Survival", which called for a radical programme of decentralisation and de-industrialisation to prevent what the authors referred to as ""the breakdown of society and the irreversible disruption of the life-support systems on this planet"". Signed by leading scientists of the day, the "Blueprint" went on to inspire the establishment of environmentalist political parties around the world.
Degrowth movement.
'Ecotopia Biketour'.
In summer 2012, the Ecotopia Biketour cycled over 3000 km 'Towards Degrowth', visiting over 43 actions and projects between Barcelona and the International Degrowth Conference in Venice.
Conferences.
The movement has also included conferences in Paris, Barcelona, Montreal and Venice.
Barcelona Conference (2010).
The First International Conference on Economic Degrowth for Ecological Sustainability and Social Equity of Paris (2008) was a discussion about the financial, social, cultural, demographic, environmental crisis caused by the deficiencies of capitalism and an explanation of the main principles of the degrowth. The Second International Conference of Barcelona on the other hand focused on specific ways to implement a degrowth society.
Concrete proposals have been developed for future political actions, including:
In spite of the real willingness of reform and the development of numerous solutions, the conference of Barcelona didn’t have a big influence on the world economic and political system. Many critiques have been made concerning the proposals, mostly about the financial aspects, and this has refrained changes to occur.
Criticisms.
Liberal critique.
Supporters of economic liberalism believe that economic growth brings about the creation of wealth, by increasing employment, improving quality of life, and providing better education and healthcare, in other words, there should be more resources in order to make and improve on more things. From this point of view, degrowth constitutes economic recession and is a destroyer of wealth.
An additional liberal criticism of degrowth is that progress is increasingly linked to knowledge rather than the use of physical resources, and that the progress of technology will solve the world's environmental problems. Free-market environmentalism is a position that argues that most environmental problems are caused by a lack of property rights and the extension of such to include externalities.
Self-regulation of the market.
Supporters of the self-regulation of the market believe that if a particular non-renewable resource becomes scarce, the market will limit its extraction via two mechanisms:
This position argues that allowing market forces to take effect is the most rational way of solving the problem, and consider that these forces are more efficient than centralized decision systems (see economic calculation, dispersed knowledge, tragedy of the commons). Market capitalism can take advantage of the exploitation of energy sources that were not economically viable 10 or 20 years prior, because under new conditions the required economic growth will necessitate their use.
In response to the theories of Georgescu-Roegen, Robert Solow and Joseph Stiglitz noted that capital and labor can substitute for natural resources in production either directly or indirectly, ensuring sustained growth or at least sustainable development.
Creative destruction.
The concept of degrowth is founded on the hypothesis that producing more always implies the consumption of more energy and raw materials, while at the same time decreasing the size of the labor force, which is replaced by machines. This analysis is considered misleading from the point of view that technological progress allows us to produce more with less, as well as provide more services. This is what is known as creative destruction, the process by which the "old" companies from a sector (as well as their costly and polluting technologies) disappear from the market as a result of the innovation in that sector that brings down costs while consuming less energy and raw materials in exchange for increased productivity.
At the same time, this reduction in costs and/or increase in profits increases the ability to save, which simultaneously allows for investment in new advances, which will replace the old technologies.
Marxist critique.
Marxists distinguish between two types of growth: that which is useful to mankind, and that which simply exists to increase profits for companies. Marxists consider that it is the nature and control of production that is the determinant, and not the quantity. They believe that control and a strategy for growth are the pillars that enable social and economic development. According to Jean Zin, while the justification for degrowth is valid, it is not a solution to the problem.
However, other Marxist writers have adopted positions close to the de-growth perspective. For example John Bellamy Foster and Fred Magdoff, in common with David Harvey, Immanuel Wallerstein, Paul Sweezy and others focus on endless capital accumulation as the basic principle and goal of capitalism. This is the source of economic growth and, in the view of these writers, is unsustainable. Foster and Magdoff develop Marx's own concept of the metabolic rift, something he noted in the exhaustion of soils by capitalist systems of food production.
Third world critique.
The concept of degrowth is viewed as contradictory when applied to lesser-developed countries, which require the growth of their economies in order to attain prosperity. In this sense the majority of supporters of degrowth advocate the attainment of a certain, acceptable level of well-being independent of growth. The question of where the balance lies (i.e. how much the developed nations should degrow by, and how much the developing nations should be allowed to grow) remains open.
Technological critique.
Supporters of scientific progress argue that it will solve the problems of energy supply, waste and the reduction of raw materials. This ideology draws inspiration from the Enlightenment to develop an optimistic technologist vision. They point to the reduction in the relation between energy consumption and production (or energy intensity) over the past twenty years. They propose that research into nuclear energy could provide temporary energy alternatives to the oil crisis, while technologies such as nuclear fusion come online.

Rsyslog is an open source software utility used on UNIX and Unix-like computer systems for forwarding log messages in an IP network. It implements the basic syslog protocol, extends it with content-based filtering, rich filtering capabilities, flexible configuration options and adds important features such as using TCP for transport.
Protocol.
Rsyslog uses the quasi-standard BSD syslog protocol, specified in RFC 3164. As the text of RFC 3164 is an informational description and not a standard, various incompatible extensions of it emerged. Rsyslog supports many of these extensions. The format of relayed messages can be customized.
The most important extensions of the original protocol supported by rsyslog are:

The rsyslog project began in 2004, when Rainer Gerhards, the primary author of rsyslog, decided to write a new strong syslog daemon to compete with syslog-ng, because, according to the author, "A new major player will prevent monocultures and provide a rich freedom of choice."
Rainer Gerhards worked on rsyslog inside his own company, Adiscon GmbH.

Global Charity Project

The Global Charity Project (GCP) is a student-run organization at Marymount University dedicated to raising funds for international and domestic sustainable development projects.
Mission.
The Global Charity Project's self-stated mission is to "bring together students of Marymount University to help build a sustainable future for people everywhere. It works to raise money and collect resources for the underprivileged while endeavoring to instill a sense of altruism and charity in the Marymount community. The GCP engages in assistance initiatives both domestically and internationally which focus on capacity building and self-help development."
The group maintains that every person has a personal responsibility to charitable to their neighbor whether they live next door or a thousand miles away.
History.
The Global Charity Project was founded in March 2008. It began with three socially conscious students and became an official university club with widespread student and administration support.
Kahama, Tanzania.
It selected Our Lady, Queen of the Family Girl's Secondary School in Kahama, Tanzania as its first Assistance Initiative for the spring 2008 semester. In four weeks, the GCP raised $3,169.24 to purchase and cultivate a field and garden for the students of the school to address severe food shortages afflicting the area. The original fund-raising goal was $1,600.
Masongbo-loko, Sierra Leone.
In September 2008, the GCP selected its second Assistance Initiative. It raised $4,123.77 throughout the fall semester to construct a well in Masongbo-loko, Sierra Leone. World Hope International, a non-profit based in Alexandria, Virginia, partnered with GCP to carry out the project.
Arlington, Virginia.
The GCP selected the Arlington Youth Philanthropy Initiative as its first Secondary Project, also in fall 2008. The GCP partnered with the Arlington Community Foundation to increase youth philanthropy in Arlington County, Virginia through the creation of a grant-making body of Arlington high school students who will disburse grants to youth-initiated community betterment projects.
El Progreso, Honduras.
In spring 2009, the GCP partnered with ProNino USA, a charitable non-profit dedicated to improving the lives of street children in Northern Honduras, to expand the capacity of the Las Flores detoxification facility and home for young boys in El Progreso, Honduras, while also making improvements to the building’s infrastructure. The home takes in street children who suffer from chronic hunger, lack of education, addiction to drugs, and abuse. It provides the boys with a safe and stable environment where they have a steady supply of food and other basic necessities.
Structure.
The GCP is a chartered student organization at Marymount University. As such, it is required to maintain a constitution as approved by the Marymount University Co-Curricular Council. The Global Charity Project Constitution invests most of the organization's day-to-day decision-making authority in the Executive Council made up a Co-President for Management (CPM), Co-President for Initiatives (CPI), Vice President, Secretary, and Treasurer. These officers are elected at the end of the Spring semester. The members decide by majority vote which Assistance Initiatives or Secondary Projects to engage in for each semester.
Initiatives.
Two types of projects comprise the bulk of the Global Charity Project's work: the semesterly Assistance Initiatives and the Secondary Projects. 
Assistance Initiatives are the main focus of the GCP. The GCP receives project proposals from outside groups or organizations and selects an Assistance Iniatiative to focus on each semester. Assistance Initiatives have two components: fundraising and awareness. Each Assistance Iniaitive has a fundraising goal and the members attempt to meet this by the end of the semester. At the same time, the group launches an education campaign to increase awareness about the problem being addressed by the Assistance Initiative. The Assistance Initiatives can be either domestic or international projects. Assistance Initiatives must meet strict criteria: they must be sustainable development projects, 100% of funds raised must go towards the actual Assistance Initiative, GCP and/or partner organization must be able to evaluate the effectiveness of the Assistance Initiatives, and all organizations with which GCP works must be transparent.
Secondary Projects are less narrow in scope and are not tied to the same strict criteria as Assistance Initiatives. They do not have to be centered on fundraising and can focus on community service, volunteering, or a variety of different issues. These projects can be worked on at the same time as Assistance Initiatives and may go longer than one semester.
Legal status.
The Global Charity Project has 501 (c) (3) status under Marymount University. Donations to the organization are tax exempt.

21 cm K 12 (E)

The 21 cm Kanone 12 in Eisenbahnlafette (21 cm K 12 (E)) was a German railroad gun used in the Second World War.
Design and history.
Krupp continued theoretical research on a replacement for the Paris Gun during the Weimar Republic-era, but it was the Nazi government that finally authorized funding for experiments to solve some of its worst problems. The extremely high velocities used by the Paris Gun to attain the stratospheric heights necessary for extreme range caused enormous wear of the barrel, so much so that the shells had to be made in gradually increasing diameter to suit the rate of wear. Even then barrel life was merely 50 rounds. It is believed that the one Paris Gun destroyed by a premature detonation in the bore was caused by loading one of the serially-numbered shells out of order. Thus Krupp decided to use only 8 grooves in the barrel and to machine matching ribs or splines on the shells to obviate the need for a massive copper driving band to start the shell spinning without shearing off, which had been one of the prime causes of the excessive barrel wear in the earlier weapon. Gas sealing would be handled by a copper band, mounted in the place normally occupied by the driving band, with an asbestos and graphite packing to form the initial seal. Several test barrels, known as the 10.5 cm K 12 M, and shells were made in 1935 and were compared to a conventionally rifled barrel (the 10.5 cm K 12 MKu). The tests proved that Krupp's concept was correct.
The K 12 (E) was mounted on a simple box-girder carriage, which was carried on two subframes which were in turn mounted on double bogies. The barrel was mounted in a ring cradle with a hydropneumatic recoil system. Two more hydropneumatic systems were connected to the subframes, which allowed the entire carriage to recoil some . For transport the gun itself was disconnected from its recoil system and drawn back some to reduce the mounting's overall length and allow it to fit in the normal railroad loading gauge. The barrel's extreme length required external bracing to prevent it from bending under its own weight. Its trunnions were placed as far forward as possible to balance the barrel and minimize the force necessary to elevate it. This placed the breech perilously close to the ground and a hydraulic jacking system was built in each subframe to elevate the mount . However it was impossible to load the weapon in this position and it had to be lowered between every shot.
The K 12 (E) could be fired from any curved section of track, a Vögele turntable, or from its special firing track. This prefabricated T-shaped track was carried on the gun train and deployed by a special crane wagon. Once the front bogies were at the crossover at the top of the T they were then jacked up and turned with the subframe 90° and then lowered onto the crosstroke of the T. The gun was then traversed by an electric motor to the bogies and it was clamped to the track once laid onto the target. It fired HE shells weighing .
The first weapon was completed in 1938 and delivered to the Army Heer in March 1939. It was successful, although the necessity to jack it up and down between shot was not well received by the Heer. Trying rectify this problem Krupp discovered that hydro-pneumatic balancing-presses could work at much greater weights and pressures than previously believed. They redesigned the mounting with the trunnions as far forward as possible and increased the recoil stroke to . The new design was delivered during the summer of 1940 and called the K 12 N (E). The first gun was retrospectively called the K 12 V (E).
They spent the war assigned to Artillerie-Batterie 701 (E) along the Channel coast. The British recovered shell fragments near Chatham, Kent, some from the nearest point on the French coast.

Cinema X

Cinema X was a British film magazine best known for its coverage of sexploitation films. Early issues of the magazine were undated, but it is believed the first issue was published in 1969. The first film to grace the cover of Cinema X was "Loving Feeling" directed by Norman J. Warren. Other films covered in the first issue were I Am Curious Yellow, Curse of the Crimson Altar and Therese and Isabelle, while interviewees in the premiere issue included Norman J Warren, John Trevelyan and Anthony Newley.
Originally 'a Cinemonde publication', the magazine appears to have been envisioned by the company as the British arm of their publishing empire, which already included a similar publication in France (Cinemonde) and in Italy (King Cinemonde). Gerald Kingsland was the magazine's first editor. Very much born of the permissive climate of the late sixties, the first issue's editorial stated: “So far the more adult magazines have reserved a few pages for the X cinema ... blood and sex are only lightly touched on. Cinema X devotes all its time to the world’s X cinema.”
Cinema X was superficially similar to the long running Continental Film Review, which in the late 1960s had begun filling its pages with stills of nude scenes from foreign films. However, Cinema X was far less pretentious and, being mostly in colour, much more glossy. 
Seen today, early issues of the magazine appear somewhat faceless, often consisting merely of an editorial followed by film pictorials with short plot synopses. However, around 1971/1972 the magazine began to develop more of a personality, with such regular features as 'Flash', a column by the film critic Peter Noble (1917-1997) on upcoming films, and articles on mainstream film stars under the heading 'Cine Go Round'. The 'Cineclub 24 Scene' and 'Cinecenta Scene' sections covered films that played at Membership Only Adult Cinemas.
During this period the magazine was published by Top Sellers Ltd, a company that also produced saucy books and posters, many of which were advertised in the magazine. The magazine also began accepting outside advertising; Subdean, the first company of David Sullivan, advertised in the magazine in 1972. And in 1975 the magazine produced its own 'X'-rated cinema advertisement, featuring model Nita Blair and directed by Ray Selfe.
At this point Tony Crawley was credited as managing editor, while contributing editors included William Rostler for articles on American films and Luigi Cozzi for articles on Italian cinema. The mid-seventies version of the magazine drastically reduced its page count from 82 to 31, dropping many of its earlier features. Under Crawley’s editorship the magazine also adopted a more critical stance towards the films reviewed. Crawley’s review of Deadly Weapons - starring Chesty Morgan - abruptly ended with Crawley proclaiming, “I can write no more, I feel ill.” 
Cinema X was initially supportive of home-grown British sex films, particularly those of producer Bachoo Sen, giving over the first issue's cover to "Loving Feeling" and comparing his next film, "Love is a Splendid Illusion", to the works of Radley Metzger and Russ Meyer. A British sex film edition followed (Vol.5, No.1), with Cinema X interviewing the likes of Pete Walker, Derek Ford and Stanley Long. 
By the mid-seventies, though, Cinema X’s love affair with the British sex film had begun to falter. UK censorship meant that British films had to remain softcore while America and most of Europe headed into the hardcore porno chic era. But Cinema X discovered that many British filmmakers were shooting hardcore versions of their films for overseas release, while never publicly admitting to doing so. Annoyed by this hypocrisy, Cinema X eventually took them to task in a review of the film Secrets of a Superstud: “At Cinema X magazine we know which directors have shot porno; we've talked to their stars. But it's little use quoting them, when the directors, producers, above all their distributors, vociferously deny everything. We prefer honesty in our pages.”
Cinema X’s interest in the American porno scene led to a 1975 spin-off magazine called "Cinema Blue", which covered the porno chic era and interviewed many of its leading lights. The magazine was short-lived however, as was an American version of Cinema X entitled "Cinema X International". 
The magazine appears to have ceased publication in the late 1970s/early 1980s.

About the classic Jerry's Nugget playing cards.
These playing cards were supposedly printed in the 70s for the gaming tables, but never saw any 'real action'. They were immediately sold in the gift store thereafter. The classic Jerry's Nugget playing cards were made from top of the line US Playing Card Company card stock, that is not available today, which makes the cards much thicker. The U.S.P.C. also used a chemical finish then, which is also not available today due to environmental reasons.
Jerry's Nugget playing cards were printed in Cincinnati, Ohio, and then were driven to the North Las Vegas casino via trucks where they sat in storage for many years. The highly prized playing card eventually sold out in the summer of 1999. Jerry's Nugget Casino does not have any plans to reprint them either. 
According to Jerry's fans, there is something different about the cards that makes them perfect for different types of moves and flourishes.
Dai Vernon, Larry Jennings, Ed Marlo, Lee Asher, Frank Simon, Chris Kenner, Earl Nelson, Dan Buck, Dave Buck, Wayne Houchin, and many other notable magicians have been seen playing with Jerry's Nugget playing cards. The playing cards are stiff, hold their form, and are easily manipulated. Flourishers have taken a liking to these pasteboards as well.

Lans Bovenberg

Arij Lans Bovenberg (born June 15, 1958) is a Dutch economist, and Professor of Economics at the Tilburg University and Erasmus University, known mainly due to his contribution to the Dutch debate on population ageing, pension reforms and public finances. Lans Bovenberg was awarded the Spinoza Prize in 2003.
Biography.
Bovenberg was born and raised in Oosterbeek in the Netherlands. Between 1976 and 1981 he studied econometrics at the Erasmus University. From 1981 to 1984 he studied at the American University of California, Berkeley. He obtained his PhD in economics there at the end of 1984 for dissertation entitled "Capital Accumulation and Capital Immobility: Q-theory in a Dynamic General Equilibrium Framework".
After graduation he lived in the USA, working at the International Monetary Fund. In 1990 he returned to the Netherlands and after a brief period at the Ministry of Economic Affairs he became a Professor of Economics at the Tilburg University and Erasmus University. Between 1995 and 1998 Bovenberg was deputy director at the Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis. Since April 2004 he has been scientific director of research institute Netspar, which he has founded.
Bovenberg is an independent member of the Dutch government's Social-Economic Council's committee for Social-Economic Policy and Life-Course Policy. In 2003 he won the Spinoza prize, which allowed him to start the Netspar research institute. Also thanks to these activities he was declared to be one of the 100 most influential Dutchmen by HP/De Tijd magazine in 2007. In 2008 Bovenberg got an honorary doctorate by the University of Ghent, Belgium for his scientific contributions.
Work.
The early work of Bovenberg focussed on tax competition in open economies. Later he contributed on optimal taxes and environmental economics. Recently he focusses on population ageing and pension economics. 
Population ageing and pension.
In the area of population ageing and pension Bovenberg advocates more flexible employment contracts, which would allow employees to combine work with care duties and lifelong learning. To keep older workers in the labor force, he suggests to offer them more vacation and shorter working hours. 
He is the architect of the Dutch Life Course Saving Scheme, which allows workers to save parts of their income to finance longer period of leave. 
Labour Participation.
In 2008 Bovenberg was a member of the Commission Labour Participation, led by P. Bakker. The commission advised the Dutch government on how to increase labor force participation in the Netherlands to 80%.
Christian Democratic Appeal.
Bovenberg believes that people have be given incentives to make full use of their capacities and that people also have duties, not only rights. He argues that also disadvantaged social groups should be expected to participate to work. He is often considered to be a Christian Democratic Appeal ideologist, but he himself states that his view (partly) differs from those of the party in some areas. Together with other Dutch economists like Johan Graafland and Eric van Damme, he thinks about the connection between Christian thinking and economics.
Personal.
Lans Bovenberg is married and father of two children. He was originally a member of the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands. When he lived in the United States, he was touched by the faith and the practical living of evangelic Christians. When he returned to the Netherlands he became a Pentecostal.
He is a member of the charismatic Evangelic Church Jefta in Breda, which is a part of the Pentecostal denomination Rafael Nederland. Twice a year he preaches in his church. He plans to study theology and become a part-time preacher around 2013.

<doc id="18287696" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18287696" title="History of the Jews in Livorno">
History of the Jews in Livorno

The history of the Jews in Livorno (Liorne or Liorna in Ladino), Italy has been documented to 1583, as immigrants from the expulsions from Spain and Portugal settled in the city. The Jewish community of Livorno, although the youngest among the historic Jewish communities of Italy, was for some time the foremost because its members achieved political rights and wealth, and contributed to scholarship in the successful port city. 
History.
The first traces of a Jewish settlement are found in documents about 1583. The Medici family, working to promote the growth of the city and of the harbor, recruited many new settlers; and Spanish Marranos also found a refuge there in 1590. In 1591, and again in 1593, Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany issued a charter to assure all persons desiring to settle at Livorno, including Jews, the most extensive rights and privileges. Many Jews were attracted by this promise. The Jewish community of Pisa received the privilege of founding a branch at Livorno with a synagogue and cemetery. In 1597, the Jews of Livorno received autonomous rights as a community, and they built a synagogue in 1603.
Rights and privileges.
The Jewish community had complete jurisdiction in civil cases involving Jews and in some minor criminal cases. In 1593 the duke's administration appointed a special judge to the Jewish court; his sentencing could be appealed only with the permission of the grand duke. As controversies arose regarding the extent of the jurisdiction, the grand duke decreed that severe penalties, such as sentences of death and penal servitude, should be confirmed by the public court. The Livornese community had the right of succession in all Jewish cases where the deceased died without natural or legal heirs. 
When Tuscany was incorporated into the French empire in 1808, the French established their law and abolished the Jewish court, also abrogating the community's right of succession. The Jewish court was revived in 1814, but with limited jurisdiction, confined to questions relating to marital law. In 1822 the French assigned such cases also to the municipal courts; the directors of the Jewish community retained the privilege of giving advisory opinions. Since 1866 and the unification of Italy, the "Codice Civile" and civil marriage have applied to all residents of Livorno as throughout the kingdom of Italy.
When the Jewish community was established (in 1593) the directors were empowered to grant safe-conducts and immunity as regards previous crimes and debts to all Jews who settled at Livorno. The communal directors decided on accepting new settlers by a majority vote of two-thirds. The right of immunity in the case of previous crimes was soon abrogated by the grand duke. In 1786, his administration limited the immunity from debt to debts that had been incurred more than four months previously. This rule continued to 1836. The right of naturalization, however, remained in force until 1859, when the Jews received full citizenship in the unified Italy.
Taxes.
From the beginning, the Jewish community had the right to impose taxes for the purpose of defraying its expenses. This right was confirmed in 1715, 1782, and 1814. In 1829 it was amplified. The community established the following taxes:
Later the community gradually abolished these separate taxes, and raised funds by a single tax, "sussidio obbligatorio", to covering all the needs of the community.
Constitution of 1780.
When the municipality was reorganized in 1780, Jewish house-owners were declared eligible to the municipal general council, though they were excluded from the magistracy. Jews were not elected directly to the council, but one representative was chosen on their behalf by the Grand Duke, from a number of names suggested by the community. The Jewish deputy took part in the municipal government as representative of the interests of Livornese Jewry, with the same privileges and salary as the Christian magistrates. The municipal constitution of 1808 under the French abrogated this privilege; but it was renewed in 1816. It remained in force to 1858, when Jews became eligible for all municipal offices.
Organization.
The administration of the community was entrusted at its foundation in 1593 to a council of five members, designated "capi" or "massari della sinagoga." They had to be prominent, well-to-do merchants; they were elected for one year, and could not immediately be re-elected. Due to irregularities during an election, the Grand Duke decreed in 1637 that the "massari" should be designated by lot by the community of Pisa. In 1642, due to repeated irregularities, new methods were adopted. Five "massari" were appointed from a council of fifty persons who had been chosen from among all merchants and house-owners over twenty-five years of age. In 1667 the community established a council of twelve deputies, who were elected for life, in addition to the "massari". There was furthermore a council of forty "able and capable citizens" in three commissions, from whom the "massari" were chosen. In 1693 a great council of sixty members, having all the rights of a modern parliament, was introduced; of this council twenty members sat in rotation each year, the entire body being convened only on important occasions. By this constitution (i.e. the constitution of 1693) the administrative corporation was divided into two bodies, one legislative and the other executive. It, however, remained in force only a short time. 
In 1715 the Grand Duke appointed three members of the great council as censors for a term of two years. They were empowered to examine the books of the community and to supervise its expenses. On the extinction of the house of Medici by the French, the Duke of Lorraine confirmed the constitution, with slight modifications. It was confirmed again in 1803 under the short-lived kingdom of Etruria. During this period, the Jewish community lived by the principle that all male members were obliged to accept communal offices, and the Grand Duke appointed and paid the salary of a chancellor to aid Jewish administration. 
History since 1808.
When the French imposed rule in 1808, the privileges as well as the constitution of the Jewish community were temporarily abrogated. Livorno had received the consistorial constitution drafted by the Grand Sanhedrin of Paris in 1806, and was made the seat of a consistory for the Mediterranean district. The community appointed two rabbis and three laymen as members of this consistory on Sept. 6, 1810. In 1814, the Grand Duke allowed the old constitution to be revived; he appointed three "massari" for a period of three years and a council of forty for life. In 1861, on the establishment of the kingdom of Italy, the old constitution was entirely abrogated. During the following interregnum, the community was governed by three members. In 1881 the community was finally reorganized, with new statutes in conformity with the principles obtaining in most of the Italian communities.
The Jews of Livorno suffered no persecutions, nor were any restrictions imposed upon them, during the entire time of their residence in the city up till the Fascist period starting in the 1930s. Their industry and ambition as well as their connections with the East contributed to the development of commerce and industry. Thus Livorno grew from a small fishing-village into a rich and powerful commercial center. The Jews dominated part of the commerce. A traveler of the seventeenth century says that the Christians had to keep holiday on the Sabbath on the Jews' account. The community, which consisted mainly of Spanish and Portuguese immigrants, retained its ancient traditions. Down to the nineteenth century, communal business was transacted partly in Portuguese; the Spanish ritual was observed in the synagogue; important hafṭarot were translated into Portuguese; and sermons were delivered in that language. The Jews preserved also the gentility and self-confidence characteristic of them in their Spanish homes. In 1603 they built a synagogue, which was one of the finest architectural monuments of the city.
The community also took interest in the general welfare; they ransomed prisoners who were landed at Livorno. The members provided charity to less fortunate coreligionists in other countries. In 1648 they levied a special tax for the benefit of the Polish Jews. They joined the Alliance Israélite Universelle. At various periods the Jewish community of Livorno numbered 10,000 persons; as late as 1848 it was estimated to number 7,000. As the commerce of the city declined, many emigrated; and by 1904 there were about 3,000 Jews in the city. The community, formerly so wealthy, had become very impoverished because the city lost its status as a free port.
Livorno suffered extensive damage during the Second World War, including severe bomb damage to the synagogue. It was demolished and replaced by a new building in a modern style commissioned in 1958. It opened in 1962.
Relations with other Sephardim.
The rabbinate of Livorno, continually acquiring new learned members from the East, and through its connections with the Sephardim of Amsterdam and London, was widely known for its scholarship. Many of the merchants also devoted themselves to study, taking up medicine, astronomy, philosophy, and the classics.
Through its connection with the East, Livorno was always a center for cabalists, especially at the time of the Shabbethaian controversies; and even in the nineteenth century cabalists and mystics found support and encouragement in the city.
In this and other ways, the Livorno community functioned as a link between the Spanish and Portuguese Jews and the Eastern Sephardi and Mizrahi communities, and as a clearing house of traditions between the two groups. For example, its musical and cantorial tradition, though related to those of other Spanish and Portuguese communities, was influenced by Jewish communities all around the Mediterranean, to whom in turn the Livorno tradition was exported. Many merchants maintained a presence in both Livorno and countries such as Tunisia, and even those who settled permanently in the Ottoman Empire retained their Tuscan or Italian nationality, so as to have the benefit of the Ottoman Capitulations. Thus in Tunisia there was a community of "Juifs Portugais", or "L'Grana" (Livornese), separate from, and regarding itself as superior to, the native Tunisian Jews ("Tuansa"). Smaller communities of the same kind (not exclusively Livornese) existed in other countries, such as Syria, where they were known as "Señores Francos", though they generally were not numerous enough to establish their own synagogues, instead meeting for prayer in each other's houses.
Many Jews also emigrated to Algeria, Egypt, France and Libya in order to capitalise on their nations foreign investment. In some cases, such as the Mendoza and the Mosseri family, whole families moved, thus creating Jewish communities in primarily Islamic states.
Foundations.
Among the many philanthropic foundations the schools, which were once widely famed, were especially noteworthy. Besides the chapels, of which there were a number in addition to the large synagogue (two being named after the rabbis Ergas and Azulai), the following institutions may be mentioned:
All these foundations were obliged to change their statutes and government in conformity with the Italian law for the administration of philanthropic institutions.
Between 1650 and 1657 there was at Livorno a Hebrew printing-press, and in 1703 another was established there; these together issued many prayer-books, especially for the East, in addition to many cabalistic works.

Once in Mexico they engage in a gunfight with Garza's men and it's revealed that Annie's rich and powerful stepfather Buck Baker (Barry Corbin) is Garza's partner and his United Farm Enterprises is the base for the largest methamphetamine operation in Oklahoma. Baker reveals that the local district attorney is corrupt and that he has been giving Annie's mother "goofy juice" to make her appear to have Alzheimer's disease. Rack, with the help of an undercover FBI agent, kills Buck and rescues Annie. Rack, Lonnie, and Skunk turn Manuel and Tito over to the FBI in Oklahoma City and return to Mangum where they are cheered by the local crows at the Thirsty Monkey and berated by Sheriff Landry for disobeying orders but does not arrest them and everyone toasts "whiskey for my men, beer for my horses".

Published by the Wellcome Trust as a free educational resource, each issue is available for free as a print or PDF subscription.
In addition to the print magazine, the website also provides free resources for teachers and online activities for students, including lesson ideas, animations, image galleries and short videos.
Recent issues and topics.
18: Number Crunching (June 2013).
In this issue, we explore how science works and look at how statistics can help us summarise data, see whether our figures are significant and put our findings into context. We explore probability, significance and risk, and look at how statistics and numbers can be misreported and misrepresented.
17: Inside the Brain (January 2013).
Developments in technology and medicine mean that doctors and scientists can examine our brains in more ways and more detail than ever before, all without having to open up the body. In this issue, we explore how imaging research has changed the way we can look inside the human brain.
16: Careers from biology (June 2012).
Decisions about careers can be tricky, especially for students. So, in this issue, we explore where studying biology can lead. Alongside our usual infographic and fast facts, meet 10 people who use biology in their jobs in very different ways.
15: Exercise, Energy and Movement (January 2012).
Movement is a fundamental characteristic of living creatures. In this issue we look at the biological systems that keep us moving and consider some of the psychological, social and ethical aspects of exercise and sport.
14: Food and Diet (June 2011).
Like all living things, humans need energy. In this issue we look at the latest biological and medical research findings to investigate different aspects of diet and nutrition – including appetite, obesity, taste, allergies, metabolic diseases, epigenetics, food policy and behaviour. 
13: The Cell (January 2011).
We all share something amazing in common - that we developed from a single sperm and egg to become complicated, sophisticated organisms made of trillions of cells. But how can cells grow and develop to form such complex creatures? Explore the secrets of animal cells, including development, differentiation and death, in this issue, which is accompanied by a full-colour poster.
12: Addiction (June 2010).
Addiction is a term we all use, but what does it mean? In this issue, explore some of the different ways in which people understand addiction, and how even professionals working in the field can't agree on a single definition. Find out about how being addicted affects your mind, body and everyday life, and join us in imagining how the future of addiction might unfold.
11: Genes, Genomes and Health (January 2010).
In recent years, mind-boggling progress has been made in genome sequencing and understanding the huge amount of data such an activity produces. Our genes play a key part in making us who we are, but how can science help us understand our genetic identity? In this issue, find out how the genetic information we carry in nearly all of our cells can not only give us an insight into our past, but is also beginning to reveal clues about our lives and health in the future.
10: Music, Mind and Medicine (June 2009).
Most of us hear some form of music each day. It is a popular leisure activity and accompanies many of the most significant points of our lives. Even so, music remains one of life's great mysteries. How can it have such a powerful impact? And what exactly is music? Big Picture explores these issues with online activities, audio and video.
9: Health and climate change (January 2009).
The Earth's climate is changing ever faster, and human activities play a role in speeding up this change. But there are consequences. Learn more about how climate change affects our health.
8: How we look (June 2008).
When we see people, we recognise individuals, we make judgements about them, we draw conclusions about their age, their sex, their personality, their mood and their intentions. And, deliberately or not, we send signals to others - through our expressions, the way we dress and the way we modify our bodies.
This issue of 'Big Picture' looks at this remarkable interplay - between the biology that sculpts our form and the culture that interprets, embellishes and adapts this form. It asks what we mean by ‘normal’, what beauty is and how such concepts influence the way we live. It looks at why we take the form we do and considers what we might look like in the future.
7: Drug Development (January 2008).
While providing immense benefits, drugs are not the perfect solution. They only work on a proportion of patients, sometimes they harm us, and we're not very good at taking them as we should. For some diseases, particularly those affecting only developing countries, there are no drugs available or they are too expensive. Drugs seem to be the answer to everything from rheumatism, through birth control, to depression. And yet while agonising over pill-popping, we consume vast amounts of untested complementary remedies.
How has this situation come about? What part do pharmaceuticals play in modern life? And where might we go in the future? These are some of the questions tackled in the 'Big Picture on Drug Development'.
6: Epidemics (September 2007).
One of the reasons that infections are so frightening is the speed with which they can kill. Doctors dealing with human cases of avian flu in the Far East have seen their patients worsen dramatically and die within a day. Add to that the fear of the new and unknown, and emerging infections can seem truly terrifying.
How do we stop new diseases emerging or re-emerging infections getting out of hand?
How does this happen in a world of such global economic imbalance, where countries vary greatly in the resources they can put into fighting disease?
And how do we balance individual rights with the need to protect public health?
5: Evolution (January 2007).
"Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution." When biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky wrote these words in 1973, he was reflecting on the coming together of two strands of thinking: evolutionary change, kick-started by Darwin in the mid-19th century, and genetics, a subject whose origins go back to the same year, with Mendel's studies, but only really got going in the 20th century. Since then, the general principles of Darwinian evolution have been widely accepted. At least, they have been in the scientific community. In wider society, a significant proportion of people remain sceptical.
Why should this be? Why does Darwinian evolution raise controversy when, say, quantum mechanics scarcely registers on the public consciousness? This issue of 'Big Picture' looks at the theory of evolution, the evidence that supports it, unanswered questions and the history of public reaction.
4: Thinking (September 2006).
New techniques have opened up ways of exploring the brain. Functional imaging allows us to watch the brain in action; our understanding of the biochemistry of nerve function has blossomed; and the genetic revolution has allowed us to probe the function of individual genes and proteins. These techniques are shedding light on the very essence of human life - how we feel, think and act. Even the nature of consciousness is beginning to be unravelled.

Abbey River

The Abbey River is a backwater of the River Thames in England, near Chertsey, Surrey in its northern green buffers adjoining mixed-use flood plain. It runs from the point opposite the midpoint of Penton Hook Island to below Chertsey Lock and forms half of the watercourse boundaries of Laleham Burway, a larger, artificial island which contains Laleham Golf Course and a fresh water waterworks.
__NOTOC__
History.
The river, which was also known as Oxley, Oxlake or Oaklake Mill River was cut by the monks of Chertsey Abbey in the eleventh century to supply the mill closest to their monastery/abbey.
Abbey.
This mill was one of several the institution owned in its vast Surrey estates — despite many sales of individual manors and small parcels of land to wealthy institutions, including Oxford and Cambridge Colleges (and Windsor Great Park at its greatest under Henry VIII, covering much of the land from Wokingham and Sandhurst, Berkshire to the River Wey). Underlining this immense wealth and the usefulness of an Abbey Mill for grain, the Valor Ecclesiasticus of 1535 gives the clear annual value (surplus) of the abbey as £659 15s. 8¾d. In 1608 there were two watermills on the river recorded as the Oaklake Mylles. 
Proposed as rival navigation.
In 1809 the millers offered the stream as the Thames navigation channel in concert with City of London Corporation building a weir to protect Chertsey and Shepperton, and other areas downstream, from floods as well as keeping water levels sufficiently deep, but the latter decided to pursue its own shorter route plans, so built Chertsey Weir and Lock. Much of the channel is lightly surrounded by trees and it is at most 980m from the River Thames.
The site of the abbey was bought in 1861 by Mr Bartrop, the secretary to the Surrey Archaeological Society who have their museum at Guildford Museum. Among the appurtenances of the site of the abbey included in its title were the "watermills known as the Oxlake or Okelake mills" and "a small river or brook known as the Abbey River or the Bargewater".

Charles Stewart (zoologist)

Charles Stewart (18 May 1840 – 27 September 1907) was an English zoologist and comparative anatomist. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 4 June 1896, and he was the president of the Linnean Society from 1890 to 1894.
Life.
Stewart was born in Plymouth and studied at St Bartholomew's Hospital, receiving his MRCS in 1862. He was Conservator of the Hunterian Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of England from 1884 to 1900, in succession to William Henry Flower. 
After practising for four years at Plymouth, he was appointed in 1866 curator of the museum at St. Thomas's Hospital, then situated in the Surrey Gardens. 
In 1871, shortly after the removal of the hospital to the Albert Embankment, he was appointed lecturer on comparative anatomy in the medical school, and in 1881 he became lecturer on physiology jointly with Dr. John Harley. 
He was also professor of biology and physiology at the Bedford College for Women from 1882-6. 
He left St. Thomas's Hospital in 1884 on his appointment as conservator of the Hunterian museum at the Royal College of Surgeons in succession to Sir William Henry Flower. 
In 1886, he became Hunterian professor of comparative anatomy and physiology at the college, and gave an annual course of lectures until 1902. 
Stewart fully maintained at the college the Hunterian tradition. Abreast of the current knowledge of anatomy, physiology, and bacteriology, which together make up modern pathology, he was able to utilise to the best advantage the stores of specimens collected by John Hunter. His dissections enabled him to correlate many facts for the first time, and his results were set forth in his lectures. 
In 1885, he lectured on the structure and life history of the hydrozoa ; in 1886 and 1887 on the organs of hearing ; in 1889 and again in 1896 on the integumental system ; in 1890 on phosphorescent organs and colour ; in 1891 on secondary sexual characters ; in 1895 on the endoskeleton ; in 1897 on joints, and on the protection and nourishment of the young ; in 1899 on the alternation of generations. He spoke without notes and drew admirably on the blackboard, illustrating his remarks from the stores of the museum. But unhappily the lectures were neither published nor reported, and only remain in the memories of his auditors or in their scanty notes. His valuable work survives alone in the catalogues of the Hunterian museum.
In spite of ill-health Stewart was active outside the College of Surgeons. 
From 1894 to 1897, he was Fullerian professor of physiology at the Royal Institution, where on two occasions he delivered the ’Friday evening' discourse. 
In 1866, he was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society, and served as its president (1890-4). He also took an active part in founding the Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland, of which he was the original treasurer (1887-1892). 
He also served as secretary of the Royal Microscopical Society from 1879 to 1883. 
He was deeply interested in the welfare of the Marine Biological Association, which was established at Plymouth, his native place. 
He was admitted F.R.S. in 1896, and in 1899 he received the honorary degree of LL.D. from Aberdeen. 
He died in London on 27 September 1907, and was buried at Highgate cemetery. 
Family.
He married in 1867 Emily Browne, and left three sons and two daughters.

World Social Summit

The World Social Summit (WSS) is a yearly international initiative of Fondazione Roma, a private institution that works to support social and economic progress, realized with the collaboration of Censis. 
The Summit's aim is to promote a debate on the numerous issues, such as the environment, demography, immigration, poverty and security, that have an impact on the global social evolution. 
The WSS is focused on the social aspects of the global progress. The summit put together major global experts, such as Nobel Prize laureates, academics, politicians, people from the business community, and representatives of national and international institutions and create a setting where ideas, and possible solutions to global issues, can be exchanged. 
The WSS Organizational structure:
WSS 2008 Edition
The first edition of World Social Summit, called: Fearless: discussion on how to combat global anguish, will focus on global fears, will take place in Rome on between the 24th and the 25th of September 2008. 
This choice was made by taking into due consideration the central position that fear occupies within contemporary societies, not only due to the increase of risks that threaten society (terrorism, crime, environment), but chiefly, the expansion of uncertainty that now distinguishes people's lives, makes fear, real or imagined, an emotion that an increasing segments of the world's population are forced to come to terms with.
The main protagonists of the WSS 2008 Edition are : the sociologists Anthony Giddens and Zygmunt Bauman, the economist Jacques Attali, the economist and Nobel laureate Gary Becker, the psychologist James Hillman, the journalist Bill Emmot, the architect Massimiliano Fuksas, the scientist Edoardo Boncinelli, the writer and journalist Roberto Saviano, the writer Suketu Mehta. 
The 2008 summit is focused on:
A special session of the Summit will be dedicated to metropolitan insecurity. Through a research realised by the Censis for WSS on ten big cities around the world, the summit will analyse the current conditions of urban life and study the solutions that have been implemented to reduce insecurity.

Robert Sutton (martyr)

Robert Sutton (b. at Burton-on-Trent; executed at Stafford, 27 July 1587) was an English Roman Catholic priest. He is a Catholic martyr, beatified in 1987.
Life.
He took the degree of M. A. from Christ Church, Oxford, 9 July 1567, and became Rector of Lutterworth, Leicestershire, in 1571. He was converted to Catholicism by his younger brother William, afterwards a Jesuit. With his younger brother Abraham, who matriculated from Hart Hall in 1576, aged 25, he arrived at Douai, 23 March 1575 (1576). They were both ordained subdeacons at Cambrai in September, deacons in December, and priests in the following February. Having said their first Masses, 7 March, they left for England, 19 March 1577 (1578).
Robert was arrested at Stafford, and condemned for being a Catholic priest. Hanged, drawn and quartered, he was cut down alive. After the lapse of a year Catholics managed to secure one of his quarters, when the thumb and index-finger were found to be intact. Abraham Sutton gave Father John Gerard the thumb, later presented to Stonyhurst College

Quantum Hoops

Quantum Hoops is a 2007 documentary film directed by Rick Greenwald, that follows the California Institute of Technology's basketball team—the Caltech Beavers—in their attempts to end a 21-year losing streak during the final week of the 2006 basketball season.
The documentary premiered on January 26, 2007 at the 2007 Santa Barbara International Film Festival, where it won a Top 10 Audience Choice Award. It first screened in theatres on November 2, 2007 in Pasadena, California, and featured at the 30th Denver Film Festival on November 8.
Background.
As a college in NCAA Division III, the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) does not award athletic scholarships. While known for its high quality of faculty and research, it is small by comparison with other colleges, with just 2,200 total students and fewer than 900 undergraduates (the NCAA generally restricts athletic eligibility to undergraduates). The school has a modest annual athletic budget of $1.1 million. It is therefore at a concerted disadvantage in college sports, being more academically minded than most colleges. Peter Roby, director of Northeastern University's Center for the Study of Sport in Society, said "It is a tribute to their unwillingness to compromise their standards that they have endured for as long as they have". The basketball team was a product of what one writer described as "perhaps the worst college basketball program ever."
The Caltech men's basketball team, the Beavers, compete in the NCAA Division III and the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. Since their previous victory in 1985, the Beavers had not won a conference game in 21 years—a 259-game losing streak (the streak ended at 310 games when the team won a conference game against Occidental on February 22, 2011). The team had not won an NCAA Division III game for 11 years, and had not won any game—league or non-league—for 60 games.
Summary.
"Quantum Hoops" has the tagline "Before they change the world, they need to win ONE game". None of the 5 seniors on the team had any high school basketball experience. However, in 2006 their margins of defeat have been narrowing (from an average of 60 points per game to an average of 29 points per game), and the team hopes the improvements they have made will climax in the shattering of their losing streak with the victory of the season's final conference game. Featuring numerous interviews with ex-players, now mainly scientists and "computer geeks", the movie discusses the history of Caltech sports and attempts to identify the reasons behind the team's poor record. The final 20 minutes of the movie cover their attempt to win against Whittier College. On January 6, 2007, the Beavers broke their losing streak in NCAA Division III play: coached by Roy Dow, they beat Bard College 81-52 to achieve their first victory since 1996. The Caltech Beavers broke their 26-year losing streak in conference play by defeating Occidental College 46-45 on February 22, 2011.
Reception.
In North America, critical reviews of "Quantum Hoops" were broadly positive. On Rottentomatoes.com, it has an 80% approval rating from listed critics. The movie was reviewed by "The New York Times", which called it the "cutest thing", and a movie that "chronicl the handful of ups and many, many downs in the history of a team remembered less for its athletic prowess (or even competence) than for once including the father of modern computational fluid dynamics." "Time" magazine called it "strangely inspiring," and "Sports Illustrated"—although criticising the movie for lacking a "sense of urgency"—said the movie succeeds because "it's hard not to feel for the players".
DVD release.
The Region 1 DVD was released on July 1, 2008. It contained two commentary tracks, one a technical commentary from director Rick Greenwald, and the second featuring Greenwald and head Caltech coach Roy Dow. A short half-hour documentary on the Caltech women's basketball team is also included.
New film.
Disney and Ben Stiller's production company, Red Hour Films, are developing a comedy film based on the events portrayed in "Quantum Hoops". "Moneyball" screenwriter Stan Chervin will write the script and Greenwald will executive-produce the film.

Into the Sun (Candlebox album)

Into the Sun is the fourth studio album by Seattle post-grunge band Candlebox. Released in 2008, it is their first album since 1998's "Happy Pills" and would mark both the band's studio return after a seven-year hiatus as well as their first album with Silent Majority Group. 
Recording and background.
In 2005, Kevin Martin wrote a song entitled "Stand." However, he felt the track didn't suit his current band, Hiwatts, and that it was "just too Candlebox." By the following year, Rhino Records, through Warner Bros., contacted Martin regarding an upcoming Candlebox best-of compilation. Martin and Klett favored the idea and decided the band should tour for its promotion, thus ending their indefinite hiatus. 
After a successful tour, bassist Bardi Martin left the band to continue his education, allowing Adam Kury to take his place. Candlebox wrote new material from November 2006 through January the following year; however, this would all be discarded as it was considered poor. They began writing more material soon after, prompting Martin to introduce "Stand" to his bandmates. While chemistry did not set in immediately during the writing process, Klett noted that old issues between bandmates were able to gradually subside. 
Much like with their debut album, Candlebox performed the new songs live for several months to ensure their quality. Recording for "Into the Sun" began that year and took a mere five weeks. Peter Klett came up with the working title "Play the Movie" which gained some support but was ultimately discarded.
"Into the Sun" features three of the founding four members of Candlebox; only Martin has been replaced by Kury. Tracks 1,3,4,6,7,8,9, and 10 all feature drums by Dave Krusen, who previously joined the band from 1997 to 1999.
Music and lyrics.
Kevin Martin described "Into the Sun" in a 2007 interview:
Touring and promotion.
Candlebox toured extensively in promotion of "Into the Sun" including the Heritage and Freedom Fest in front of a record crowd. On August 9, 2010 the band also kicked off a five-show stint overseas performing for U.S troops at Camp Arifjan in Kuwait and continued on to Iraq.
The song "Stand" was released as a single and found considerable radio play. According to Martin, the song was "inspired by the second elected term of George Bush, and how people didn’t figure out the first time around that he’s a complete and utter buffoon. But more so, it’s about society in general, and the fact that you’ve got to pull your head out of the sand and reclaim this country." 
To provide the album further exposure, the band released five songs, two weeks apart, leading up to the release "Into the Sun". "Surrendering," "Miss You," and "A Kiss Before" were also released as singles.

They fall in love, get married and have a child called Samet. One day Ilyas stops to help some stranded bystanders, but in doing so, he is delayed and ends up getting fired. When Asya goes to his boss and pleads for İlyas to be reinstated, İlyas is enraged and hits her, then leaves her to start an affair with his former casual girlfriend Dilek (Hülya Tuğlu). When İlyas realises his mistake, he goes back only to find that Asya and his child have left the house. Asya and Samet are wandering by the road when they hitchhike on the back of a truck with a kind stranger Cemşit (Ahmet Mekin). After Cemşit realises that Asya has nowhere to go, he takes pity on them and offers them food and shelter while İlyas searches desperately for them. Samet becomes increasingly fond of Cemşit and Asya begins to see that Samet thinks of him as a father. Then one day after many years, İlyas suddenly appears and Asya is left to make a choice between him and Cemşit.
Awards.
The film won the Best Director, Second Best Film and Best Cinematography awards at the 15th Antalya Golden Orange Film Festival. Additionally, Türkan Şoray was awarded the Best Actress award at the Tashkent Film Festival.

85 mm divisional gun D-44

The 85-mm divisional gun D-44 () was a Soviet divisional 85-mm calibre field artillery gun used after World War II. It was designed as the replacement for the 76 mm divisional gun M1942 (ZiS-3). The gun is no longer in front-line service with the Russian Ground Forces, although some 200 of the Chinese Type 56 variant are still in service with the Pakistan Army. Wartime service included use by communist forces during the Vietnam War and by Arab forces during their conflicts with Israel.
Overview.
The design of the D-44 started in 1943 at the design bureau of No.9 factory "Uralmash" and production began in late 1945. Its GRAU code was 52-P-367. The SD-44 was a 1950s variant with an auxiliary propulsion unit and ammunition box for 10 rounds, with 697 issued to the airborne forces (VDV) from 1954. The D-44N was a 1960s variant with an APN 3-7 infra-red illumination device for night combat. China received D-44's during the Korean War and began manufacturing a copy, the Type 56, in the early 1960s. Finally, the Polish Army has equipped some of their D-44 guns with electrical subsystems in the early 1980s and designated them D-44M and D-44MN.
The barrel was developed from that of the T-34-85 tank and was capable of firing 20-25 high explosive (HE), armor piercing, and high explosive antitank (HEAT) projectiles per minute. Subcaliber BR-365P HVAP-T (high velocity armor piercing-tracer) projectiles were capable of penetrating 100mm of armor at 1000 meters at a ninety-degree obliquity, and the BR-367P HVAP-T projectile penetrates 180mm of armor under the same conditions. The O-365K HE round weighed 9.5 kg and packed 741 grams of TNT as its bursting charge, while the BK-2M HEAT-FS (fin stabilized) projectile can penetrate 300mm of armor. The HEAT round for the Type 56 has a maximum range of 970 meters and will penetrate 100mm of armor at an angle of 65 degrees.
The gun uses GAZ-AA tires, and is towed by a 2.5t truck or a Ya-12 tractor with the average speed of 20–25 km/h on surfaced roads, and 11 km/h over open terrain, with a maximum towing speed over asphalt roadway of about 55 km/h. The SD-44's auxiliary propulsion unit M-72 of 14 hp can move the gun at road speeds up to 25 km/h.
The gun uses the OP-2-7 sight with 5.5x magnification for day combat. The sight permits target acquisition at 1500 meters.
Production.
The D-44 was produced from 1945 until 1953. During the years 1948-1950, over two thousand D-44's were produced per year. The D-44 also served as the basis from which the 85 mm antitank gun D-48 was developed and also the RPU-14 multiple rocket launcher uses the D-44's carriage.
Use by other nations.
By the 1950s, the D-44 had been exported for use by Warsaw Pact nations, with the gun remaining in service with the East German National People's Army until the fall of the East Germany. Besides Pakistan and East Germany, other users include(d) Albania, Algeria, Bulgaria, Cambodia, China (Type 56), Cuba, Egypt, Georgia, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Hungary, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Laos, Mali, Morocco, Mozambique, Poland, Romania, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syria, and Vietnam.

Don't Let Them Shoot the Kite

"Don't Let Them Shoot the Kite" () is a 1989 Turkish drama film, co-written, co-produced and directed by Tunç Başaran based on a story by Feride Çiçekoğlu, featuring Nur Sürer as a female political prisoners who befriends the child of a fellow inmate. The film was screened in competition at the 26th Antalya Golden Orange Film Festival, where it won Golden Oranges for Best Film, Best Actress, Best Screenplay and Best Cinematography, the 10th Mediterranean International Film Festival, where it won 2nd Best Film, and the 8th Istanbul International Film Festival, where it won Best Turkish Film.
When a woman is sent to prison for drug smuggling, Barış, her young son, is sent with her, as is the custom in Turkey. Inside this all-women’s penitentiary, Barış (Ozan Bilen) searches for companionship and guidance—and finds them both in the form of Inci Nur Sürer, a political prisoner with whom he forms a very special bond. A beautifully observed, tender story of the growing affection between a woman and a child who is not her own, Tunç Başaran’s film, with a screenplay by Feride Çiçekoğlu based on her novel, builds an effective counterpoint between the prison world, with its discipline, intrigues and threat of violence, and the private space Inci and Barış manage to create for themselves. Voted Best Turkish Film of the Year at the 1989 Istanbul Film Festival.

HMS Oak (1912)

HMS "Oak" was a modified "Acheron"-class destroyer of the Royal Navy. Launched in 1912, she saw extensive service during World War I as a tender to the flagship of the Grand Fleet, and for this purpose she was painted white, instead of the usual warship grey. She was sold in 1921 to be scrapped. Named after the Oak tree (genus "Quercus"), she was only the second ship of the Royal Navy to carry the name, and the first for over 250 years.
Construction.
Sir Alfred Yarrow maintained that it was possible to build strong, seaworthy destroyers with a speed of , and eventually a contract for three such boats was placed with Yarrow & Company of Scotstoun, Glasgow. The ""Firedrake" Specials", "Special I class" or "Yarrow Specials" were a little larger than the rest of the class but carried the same armament. "Firedrake", "Lurcher" and "Oak" were, however, distinctive in appearance and at least 4 knots faster than the rest of their class. They all exceeded their contract speed, "Lurcher" making over . "Oak", the last of the class, was launched on 5 September 1912.
Wartime service.
"Oak" was tender to the flagship of the Grand Fleet throughout the war, including the Battle of Jutland, and had the distinction of having the same commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Douglas Faviell MVO, all her career. Her hull was painted white to distinguish her, and in the course of her duties she often carried the most important visitors. Of note, King George V travelled to Scapa Flow in 1915 for a two-day review of the Grand Fleet, crossing from Thurso. "Oak" also carried Lord Kitchener from Scrabster to Scapa Flow on 5 June 1916 before transferring him to the cruiser "Hampshire", which struck a mine shortly before 19:30 the same day, with the loss of all but 12 crew, including Field Marshal Kitchener.
Surrender of the German High Sea Fleet (1918).
Distinctive in her white paint, "Oak" carried the German Rear-Admiral Hugo Meurer from the cruiser "Königsberg" to surrender on 15 November 1918, to Admiral Sir David Beatty on board his flagship, , in the Firth of Forth.
Under the terms of the Armistice, the German High Seas Fleet went into internment at the Royal Navy's base at Scapa Flow - in Operation ZZ, 60 Allied battleships escorted 11 battleships, 5 battlecruisers, 8 cruisers and 48 destroyers of the High Seas Fleet into captivity. At 11:00 on 20 November 1918 King George V, Queen Mary and the Prince of Wales embarked in "Oak" and, preceded by the destroyer "Verdun", steamed through the fleet, the Royal Standard at "Oak"s mainmast, cheered by every ship.
Disposal.
"Oak" was sold in May 1921 for breaking.

Metaspriggina is a genus of chordate known from only two specimens in the middle Cambrian Burgess shale.
Whilst named after the Ediacaran organism "Spriggina", later work has shown the two to be unrelated. Evidence for cranial structures is present in one of the specimens. Metaspriggina is considered to represent a primitive chordate, possibly transitional between cephalochordates and the earliest vertebrates. It lacked fins and eyes, but had a poorly developed cranium. The largest specimens were in length. It was likely free-swimming but occasionally found on the sea floor.

Helcionellid

The Helcionellids are fossil shells of very small marine mollusks that are preserved as shells. These animals are first found about in the late Nemakit-Daldynian age, which is the earliest part of the Cambrian period. A single species persisted to the Early Ordovician. These fossils are component of the small shelly fossils (SSF) assemblages. 
These are thought to be early molluscs with rather snail-like shells. They may be the ancestors of the modern conchiferans, a group that includes all the well-known modern families – gastropods, cephalopods and bivalves. Shelled molluscs therefore predate the earliest fossil trilobites. They have also been considered to represent direct ancestors to the cephalopods.
Parkhaev (2006, 2007) considers these animals to be crown-group gastropods. Previous to the 2006 classification by Parkhaev, helcionellids were classified within the separate class Helcionelloida or as "Uncertain position (Gastropoda or Monoplacophora)" within "Paleozoic molluscs of uncertain systematic position" according to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda by Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005
2006-2007 taxonomy.
According to the opinion of P. Yu. Parkhaev the order Helcionelliformes is within the subclass Archaeobranchia Parkhaev, 2001 in the class Gastropoda.
Order Helcionelliformes Golikov & Starobogatov, 1975
Description.
Helcionellids have a single shell, in which the peak forms a distinctive curve. Some have horizontal inhalent siphons ("exhaust pipes") on the concave edges of their shells, and there is debate about whether these pointed forwards or backwards. Most Helcionellid fossils that have been collected are only a few millimeters long and rather snail-like. However specimens a few centimeters long have also been found, mainly limpet-like in shape, although some were laterally compressed and others were tall. The smallest specimens may have been juvenile or larval forms of the larger specimens.
These resemble limpets, with the peak of the shell distinctively curved to form a shape identical to the helcionellids known from the SSF assemblages. Since molluscs grow by adding material to the opening of the shell, it appears that the helcionellids of the SSF are juvenile molluscs, which continued to grow into large limpet-like creatures typical of early Cambrian molluscs.
However, the Helcionellids mollusks first appear about in the Early Cambrian of the Asia. In the Nemakit-Daldynian "Purella antiqua" Zone of the Siberia and in its analogue the "Paragloborilus subglobosus–Purella squamulosa" Zone of the Meishucunian Stage of the China.
Helcionellids are thought to be early molluscs with rather snail-like or limpet-like shells, and possibly the ancestors of the modern conchiferans, a group that includes all the well-known modern families – gastropods, cephalopods and bivalves. Shelled molluscs therefore predate the earliest fossil trilobites.
Most Helcionellid fossils are only a few millimeters long but some species were a few centimeters long. Probably, that the some tiny specimens were juveniles of the large species. **** -->

Diaconescu's theorem

In mathematical logic, Diaconescu's theorem, or the Goodman–Myhill theorem, states that the full axiom of choice is sufficient to derive the law of the excluded middle, or restricted forms of it, in constructive set theory. It was discovered in 1975 by Diaconescu and later by Goodman and Myhill. Already in 1967, Errett Bishop posed the Theorem as an exercise (Problem 2 on page 58 in ).
Proof.
For any proposition formula_1, we can build the sets
and
These are sets, using the axiom of specification. In classical set theory this would be equivalent to 
and similarly for formula_5. However, without the law of the excluded middle, these equivalences cannot be proven; in fact the two sets are not even provably finite (in the usual sense of being in bijection with a natural number, though they would be in the Dedekind sense). 
Assuming the axiom of choice, there exists a choice function for the set formula_6; that is, a function formula_7 such that 
By the definition of the two sets, this means that
which implies formula_10
But since formula_11 (by the axiom of extensionality), therefore formula_12, so
Thus formula_14 As this could be done for any proposition, this completes the proof that the axiom of choice implies the law of the excluded middle. 
The proof relies on the use of the full separation axiom. In constructive set theories with only the predicative separation, the form of "P" will be restricted to sentences with bound quantifiers only, giving only a restricted form of the law of the excluded middle. This restricted form is still not acceptable constructively.
In constructive type theory, or in Heyting arithmetic extended with finite types, there is typically no separation at all - subsets of a type are given different treatments. A form of the axiom of choice is a theorem, yet excluded middle is not.

Becks Run

Becks Run is a tributary of the Monongahela River. As an urban stream, it is heavily polluted, receiving combined sewer outflow from Carrick (Pittsburgh) and Mount Oliver, Pennsylvania. There is a waterfall on a tributary, just downstream from a slate dump, near the intersection of Wagner Avenue and Mountain Avenue. There were coal mines along the stream, including Becks Run #2, owned by the estate of James H. Hays, served by an incline and the H.B. Hays and Brothers Coal Railroad. Other mines were operated by Jones & Laughlin, and the Birmingham Coal Company.
It is the namesake of the Pittsburgh and Beck's Run Railroad (1877-1880), which ran from the Smithfield Street Bridge to the Jones and Laughlin Iron Works, and was absorbed by the P&LE Railroad.
A former town, located where Becks Run enters the Monongahela, was also named Becks Run.

Mazzarella

A mazzarella is a stick used to herd cattle (such as oxen), sheep, and horses in northern Italy.
It is carried by a buttero, a cowboy or shepherd in the regions of Maremma, in Tuscany and in the bordering zones of the Northern Latium.
It is derived from the word "mazza", the Italian word for mace. The mace (or mazza) was the primary weapon in Europe between the 12th and 16th Centuries, and the area around Milan in northern Italy was a primary site of manufacture for the Italian mace that was most popular during this period.
Starting around the 15th to 16th Century, the mace became a ceremonial symbol of authority, and has continued to be so at multiple European courts as well as in the U.S. Congress and at many universities.
The mazzarella, therefore, is a derivation that persists in Northern Italy both as a symbol of authority (for the cowboy or shepherd) as well as having an impetus/herding function.

Logic as a Positive Science

Logic as a Positive Science is one of the major works of Italian Marxist philosopher Galvano Della Volpe. It was first published in 1950 as "Logica come Scienza positiva". A second edition appeared in 1956 and according to translator, Jon Rothschild, Della Volpe was reportedly working on a third edition at the time of his death in 1968 which was never completed. The definitive, enlarged edition was published posthumously in 1969 under the slightly different title "Logica Come Scienza Storica" Jon Rothschild translated the book into English for New Left Books (now Verso), and was first published by them as "Logic as a Positive Science" in 1980. 
The book's thesis is that the progress made in philosophy has come out of struggles against apriorist idealism. Della Volpe provides several case studies of such critiques of apriorism including Plato's critique of Parmenides, Aristotle's critique of Plato, Galileo's critique of scholastic science, Kant's critique of Leibniz's rationalism, and the young Marx's critique of Hegelian idealism.
Della Volpe used those case studies in order to defend the thesis that Marxism is a science to the extent that it relies upon a Galilean methodology, not unlike the one that he saw as underlying the natural sciences. For Della Volpe, Capital is the best exemplification of this moral Galileanism in practice, with Marx exploding the apriorist reasonings of the classical economists, which involved reliance upon 'speculative' or 'forced' abstractions that implied the existence of natural and eternal economic laws. Instead, Marx followed a methodology that relied upon determinate abstractions instead. Della Volpe analyzed Marx's methodology as one which followed the pattern of Concrete-Abstract-Concrete (C-A-C), which is the pattern or circle of scientific materialist dialectics (as opposed to Hegelian dialectics which, according to Della Volpe, follows the circle of Abstract-Concrete-Abstract).
In developing this analysis of Marx, Della Volpe advanced an understanding of the logic of scientific verification that was not unlike the one that Karl Popper presented in his "Logic of Scientific Discovery". However, it would seem that Della Volpe did not rely upon Popper in developing his analysis but instead relied on such writers as Galileo, Lord Bacon,
Claude Bernard, John Dewey, and Friedrich Engels. Whereas, Popper was concerned in "The Logic of Scientific Discovery" was concerned with providing solutions to the demarcation problem (i.e. rules for distinguishing science from non-science) and the induction problem, Della Volpe was concerned mainly with demonstrating that the "moral sciences" follow the same logic as the natural or positive sciences, and with showing that Marx had likewise embraced what Della Volpe called a "moral Galileanism."

Selborne Priory

Selborne Priory was a priory of Augustinian canons in Selborne, Hampshire, England.
Foundation.
The priory was founded in 1233 by Peter des Roches, Bishop of Winchester. The bishop initially endowed the priory with lands obtained by gift from James de Acangre, James de Norton, and King Henry III. The canons had the manor of Selborne with all its privileges and the churches of Selborne, Basing and Basingstoke. The foundation was confirmed by Pope Gregory IX in September, 1235
13th to 15th centuries.
The house acquired numerous small endowments over the years, but also various obligations such as the upkeep of the vicarages of the various churches. The original foundation was for fourteen canons but by the mid fifteenth century this number had fallen to just four and the priory was in serious debt.
Dissolution.
On 21 April 1478 the general chapter of the Augustinian Order authorised a visitation by the priors of Breamore and Tortington. And on 2 September 1484 Bishop Waynflete appointed a commission for the annexing of the priory to Magdalen College, Oxford. The evidence given to the commission showed that there were no canons in residence and the buildings were dilapidated. The decree of annexation was pronounced on 11 September 1484 and confirmed in 1485.
Post-Dissolution.
After the suppression a chantry priest was maintained by the college at Selborne, to celebrate masses for the benefactors and founders of both college and priory. The muniments of the priory were transferred to the college and kept in the Founder's Tower. 
Present day.
No visible remains of the buildings can be seen above ground. Archaeological investigations were carried out in the 1960s and 1970s finding the remains of the church, cloister and other buildings. The surviving muniments are one of the most complete sets for any religious house in the country.

Irish Patriot Party

The Irish Patriot Party was the name of a number of different political groupings in Ireland throughout the 18th century. They were primarily supportive of Whig concepts of personal liberty combined with an Irish identity that rejected full independence, but advocated strong self-government within the British Empire. 
Due to the discriminatory penal laws, the Irish Parliament at the time was exclusively Anglican Protestant (episcopalian). Their main achievement was the Constitution of 1782, which gave Ireland legislative independence.
Early Irish Patriots.
In 1689 a short-lived "Patriot Parliament" had sat in Dublin before James II, and briefly obtained "de facto" legislative independence, while ultimately subject to the English monarchy. The parliament's membership mostly consisted of land-owning Roman Catholic Jacobites who lost the ensuing War of the Grand Alliance in 1689–91. 
The name was then used from the 1720s to describe Irish supporters of the British whig party, specifically the Patriot faction within it. Swift's "Drapier's Letters" and earlier works by Molyneaux and Charles Lucas are seen as precursors, deploring the undue control exercised by the British establishment over the Irish political system. In contrast with the 1689 parliament, this movement consisted of middle-class Protestants. The appointed senior political and church officials were usually English-born. 
The "Money Bill dispute" of 1753–56 arose from the refusal of Henry Boyle, an MP and Chancellor of the Exchequer of Ireland, to allow an Irish revenue surplus to be paid over to London. Supported by the Earl of Kildare and Thomas Carter, Boyle was dismissed by the viceroy Dorset, and then appealed to public opinion as a defender of Irish interests. In 1755 the next viceroy arranged a favourable compromise, and Boyle was re-instated and created Earl of Shannon.
It was also used to describe Irish allies of the Patriot Whigs of William Pitt the Elder in the 1750s and 1760s. The philosophy was that their legal and trading benefits, and personal freedoms of being of English origin that derived from the Magna Carta, and more so the Bill of Rights that arose from the 1688 Glorious Revolution, were absent for those living in Ireland. The Dependency Act of 1719 was considered particularly contentious.
Grattan's Patriots.
In the latter half of the 18th century some influential but relatively small grouping of Irish politicians emerged who called themselves the Irish Patriot Party. This was led in its early years by Henry Flood who was succeeded by Henry Grattan, who inspired the party for most of its life.
Limited success.
They came to prominence during the American War of Independence when they pushed for legislative independence for Ireland. With the possible threat of invasion by France in 1778, a large militia had been formed known as the Irish Volunteers. In the absence of the regular garrison, they served largely as a bargaining tool for the Irish patriot politicians in their bid to gain greater powers from London, without having to fire a shot in anger. Similar to the American colonists before 1776, they arranged local "non-importation agreements" in 1779, where the signatories undertook not to buy British goods as a form of Boycott protest. Their aim was complete self-government. 
The young Jonah Barrington recalled the "military ardour which seized all Ireland, when the whole country had entered into resolutions to free itself for ever from English domination. The entire kingdom took up arms, regiments were formed in every quarter, the highest, the lowest, and the middle orders, all entered the ranks of freedom, and every corporation, whether civil or military, pledged life and fortune to attain and establish Irish independence."
"My father had raised and commanded two corps—a dragoon regiment called the Cullenagh Rangers, and the Ballyroan Light Infantry. My elder brother commanded the Kilkenny Horse and the Durrow Light Dragoons. The general enthusiasm caught me, and before I well knew what I was about, I found myself a military martinet and a red-hot patriot. Having been a university man, I was also considered to be, of course, a writer, and was accordingly called on to draw up resolutions for volunteer regiments all over the county."
In April 1782, Grattan argued against compromise and secured autonomy. The Dublin parliament voted him £100,000 in thanks, of which he accepted £50,000. Fearing a similar secession to the one which had just lost them the Thirteen American colonies, the British government agreed to their demands. George Washington had announced, provocatively "Patriots of Ireland, your cause is identical with mine". 
Such was the influence of Grattan that the subsequent eighteen years of greater legislative independence were known as Grattan's Parliament, with the odious Dependency Act of 1719 repealed by the Repeal of Act for Securing Dependence of Ireland Act 1782. The sympathetic Fox-North Coalition government in London agreed that the Irish parliament would legislate exclusively for Ireland. Having support from the Irish parliament and the British government. "Wanting the fullest constitutional agreement on the new status of Ireland, Grattan also sought and obtained a further Declaratory Act from the Parliament of Great Britain that was passed on 22 January 1783, which included this formula:
The only remaining constitutional link between the monarchies of Ireland and Britain was the Crown, represented by the viceroy. Grattan's view was that a beneficial link should be maintained with Britain and compared his policy to Ireland's geographic situation in a neat formula: ""The Channel forbids union; the ocean forbids separation"".
Problems.
The reformist Patriots struggled in the following years to gain anything approaching a majority on social reform issues in the Irish House of Commons, but in 1793 another Catholic Relief Act was passed. In 1789 the reformist element formally established the "Irish Whig Party" but soon lost goodwill in London for its views on the .
French revolution.
The French revolution emphasised the Patriots' divisions. The major reform of the Catholic Relief Act in 1793 allowed Catholics to vote, to practise as lawyers, to act as grand jurors and to enter Trinity College Dublin as students, but this reform had to be pushed along by London, no doubt to Grattan's embarrassment. Opponents of this reform spoke of the need to protect a "Protestant Ascendancy". The 1793 Act was based on the British Roman Catholic Relief Act 1791. 
The growth of the radical United Irish movement from 1791 upstaged Grattan by calling for a complete break with Britain and full emancipation for all religions in a new republic. Given its support for France in the War of the First Coalition, it was outlawed from 1795.
In 1795 the London government sponsored reforms, to head off trouble, by repealing the Hearth tax and funding a Catholic seminary in the form of St Patrick's College, Maynooth. However, earlier in the year it had quickly recalled the new viceroy Lord Fitzwilliam, who had intended to effect further Catholic reliefs and to appoint Grattan to the administration. The sacking of FitzWilliam and the imposition of martial law in March 1797 caused Grattan and his supportive group of MPs to withdraw from parliament in May 1797, and by then the civil unrest caused by the army, the militia, the Orange Order, the Defenders and the United Irishmen had made Ireland ungovernable. 
The unsuccessful 1798 rebellion launched in May 1798 by the republican United Irishmen seriously damaged the Patriot cause. Although most liberal Patriots opposed the rebellion, they became tarnished by association, and support dropped for them in Britain. Some Patriot MPs of the 1780s, such as James Napper Tandy and Lord Edward FitzGerald, had become United Irish leaders in the 1790s. The Rebellion, which had been launched in co-ordination with a French invasion, provoked the British government of William Pitt into pushing through the 1800 Act of Union, merging the parliaments of Ireland and Great Britain into the new "United Kingdom". Naturally the Patriots opposed this in heated debates in 1799 and 1800.
Act of Union and Legacy.
Following the Act of Union in 1800, the Irish Parliament was abolished. A few Irish Patriots took up seats in the new unified British House of Commons in London, under the notional leadership of Grattan. Within a few years they had become almost entirely submerged within the British Whig Party, with whom they were allied, and disappeared from the political landscape. 
Grattan's advocacy of liberal-minded moderate Irish nationalist self-rule with links to Britain had a resonance over the following century. It was taken up by Daniel O'Connell's Repeal Association in the 1830s that intended to repeal the Act of Union; by the Young Ireland movement in the 1840s; and later by the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) that campaigned for a restoration of Home Rule in Ireland. The IPP and its successors dominated the political scene in Ireland for decades until its defeat by the fully secessionist Sinn Féin movement in the 1918 general election.

Carmen up to Data

Carmen up to Data is a musical burlesque with a score written by Meyer Lutz. The piece was a spoof of Bizet's 1875 opera "Carmen". The libretto was written by G. R. Sims and Henry Pettitt.
After a tryout in Liverpool in September 1890, the piece premiered at the Gaiety Theatre, London, on 4 October 1890, produced by George Edwardes. It starred Florence St. John in the title role, Letty Lind as Mercedes, Jenny Dawson as Escamillo, Maria Jones as Michaela, Blanche Massey as Morales, E. J. Lonnen as José and Arthur Williams as Captain Zuniga.
In the December 1890 issue of "Punch magazine", the reviewer wrote, "In calling their burlesque 'Carmen up to Data' possibly the two dear clever boys who wrote it intended some crypto-jocosity of which the hidden meaning is known only to the initiated in these sublime mysteries. Why 'Data'? On the other hand, 'Why not?' However attractive or not as a heading in a bill of the play, the Gaiety 'Carmen' is, on the whole, a merry, bright, and light burlesque-ish piece."
The piece was a success and toured throughout the English-speaking world, reaching Australia by 1892
Background.
Bizet's "Carmen" had first been produced in English in London in 1879 at "Her Majesty's Theatre", starring Selina Dolaro and Durward Lely. An earlier burlesque of "Carmen", called "Carmen: or, Sold for a Song", by Robert Reece, had also been produced at the Folly Theatre in 1879, and several other burlesques followed. Burlesque of opera or classical works was popular in Britain from the 1860s to the 1880s. Other examples at the Gaiety include "The Bohemian G-yurl and the Unapproachable Pole" (1877), "Blue Beard" (1882), "Ariel" (1883, by F. C. Burnand), "Galatea, or Pygmalion Reversed" (1883), "Little Jack Sheppard" (1885), "Monte Cristo Jr" (1886), "Miss Esmeralda" (1887), "Frankenstein, or The Vampire's Victim" (1887), "Mazeppa", "Faust up to Date" (1888), "Ruy Blas and the Blasé Roué" (1888), "Cinder Ellen up too Late" (1891), and "Don Juan" (1892, with lyrics by Adrian Ross). 
John Hollingshead managed the Gaiety Theatre from 1868 to 1886 as a venue for variety, continental operetta, light comedy, and numerous musical burlesques composed or arranged by the theatre's music director, Wilhelm Meyer Lutz. Hollingshead called himself a "licensed dealer in legs, short skirts, French adaptations, Shakespeare, taste and musical glasses." In 1886, Hollingshead ceded the management of the theatre to George Edwardes, whom he had hired in 1885. Edwardes expanded the burlesque format from one act to full-length pieces with original music by Lutz, instead of scores compiled from popular tunes, and choreography by the theatre's dance-master, John D'Auban. Nellie Farren, as the theatre's "principal boy," and Fred Leslie starred at the Gaiety for over 20 years. Leslie wrote many of its pieces under his pseudonym, "A. C. Torr". In the early 1890s, as Burlesque went out of fashion, Edwardes changed the focus of the theatre from musical burlesque to the new genre of Edwardian musical comedy.

12th Cavalry (Frontier Force)

The 12th Cavalry (Frontier Force) is an armoured regiment of Pakistan Army. It was formed in the British Indian army in 1922 by the amalgamation of 22nd Sam Browne's Cavalry (Frontier Force) and 25th Cavalry (Frontier Force).
22nd Sam Browne's Cavalry (Frontier Force).
The 22nd Sam Browne's Cavalry (Frontier Force) was raised in 1849 at Lahore by Lieutenant Samuel J. Browne as the 2nd Punjab Irregular Cavalry. It was one of five regiments of Punjab Cavalry raised to guard the North West Frontier of India, which soon became famous as part of the legendary Punjab Frontier Force or the "Piffers". Over the next decades, the regiment saw extensive service on the Frontier. During the Indian Mutiny of 1857, the regiment was engaged in the Siege of Delhi, Relief of Lucknow, the Battle of Agra and the Campaign in Rohilkhand. In one of the actions, their commandant, Captain Sam Browne was awarded the Victoria Cross. His citation reads:
It was the loss of his arm that caused Browne to invent the famous Sam Browne belt, still in the use of many of today's armies. The original belt is on display in the India Room at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. 
Meanwhile, Captain Dighton Probyn was also awarded the Victoria Cross for gallantry, while serving with the 2nd Punjab Cavalry. His citation reads: 
During the Second Afghan War of 1878-80, the 2nd Punjab Cavalry was with the Kandahar Field Force, and fought at the Battle of Ahmad Khel in April 1880. During the First World War, the regiment served in the Mesopotamia Campaign.
25th Cavalry (Frontier Force).
The 25th Cavalry (Frontier Force) was raised by Captain Robert Fitzgerald as the 5th Punjab Irregular Cavalry at Multan in 1849. During the Indian Mutiny they were part of the besieging army at Delhi and took part in the Relief of Lucknow. One squadron fought at Bareilly, where two of its Indian officers won the Order of British India and nine other ranks received the Indian Order of Merit. The regiment was involved in a number of small actions on the North West Frontier with the Punjab Frontier Force. In March 1860, 150 men under an Indian officer attacked a 3,000 strong lashkar of Mahsuds and Waziris at Tank, killing 300 and dispersing the others. In January 1867, an Indian officer with 27 sowars charged a body of 1,000 tribesmen, killed 150 and captured most of the rest. During the Second Afghan War, the 5th Punjab Cavalry were present at the capture of Charasiah and Frederick Roberts the Commanding General ordered that they and the 9th Lancers should have the honour of escorting him into Kabul. During the attack on the Asmai Heights in December 1879, near Kabul, Captain William John Vousden made repeated charges with a small body of men of the 5th Punjab Cavalry, passing through the ranks of an overwhelming force again and again until the enemy fled. Vousden received a Victoria Cross and his ten surviving men the Indian Order of Merit. During the First World War, it served in German East Africa, followed by service in the Third Afghan War of 1919. 
12th Cavalry (Frontier Force).
After the First World War, the number of Indian cavalry regiments was reduced from thirty-nine to twenty-one. However, instead of disbanding the surplus units, it was decided to amalgamate them in pairs. This resulted in renumbering and renaming of the entire cavalry line. The 22nd Sam Browne's Cavalry (Frontier Force) and 25th Cavalry (Frontier Force) were amalgamated in 1921 to form 12th Cavalry. The uniform of 12th Cavalry was scarlet with blue facings. The badge showed a mounted figure within a circle carrying the title 'Sam Browne's Cavalry XII FF' with a crown above. Its class composition was one squadron each of Punjabi Muslims, Sikhs and Dogras. In 1937, 12th Cavalry became the training regiment of 2nd Indian Cavalry Group at Ferozepur. It was converted into a training centre in 1940 by amalgamating it with 15th Lancers.
On the partition of India in 1947, this training centre was transferred to Pakistan. On 15 January 1955, 12th Cavalry (Frontier Force) was re-raised at Rawalpindi as a Reconnaissance Regiment of Pakistan Armoured Corps. The regiment has a glorious history during the 1965 and 1971 Indo-Pakistani Wars. During the 1965 War, the regiment fought in four different sectors simultaneously when all four squadrons of the regiment operated independently at Chawinda, Bedian, Khem Karan and Sialkot.

Schahan Berberian

Schahan R. Berberian () (January 1, 1891 – October 9, 1956) was an Armenian philosopher, composer, pedagogue, psychologist, aesthetician, public speaker and author.
Biography.
Early years.
Berberian was born in Constantinople (now Istanbul, Turkey). Shortly thereafter, along with his parents Retheos and Zaruhi and his elder brother Onnig, Berberian moved to Geneva, Switzerland to escape the atrocities against the Armenians perpetrated by the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II from 1894 to 1896.
Returning to Constantinople, Berberian enrolled at the Berberian School, which had been founded by his father Reteos Berberian, in Kadıköy, a district on the Asian side of the city. At that time, he started taking private lessons on the violin, but soon quit playing the "insufferable instrument" (allegedly throwing it into the fireplace to burn it). Instead he took up piano lessons although this venture was also rather unsuccessful.
Berberian graduated in 1906. The first job of the fifteen-year-old young man was to teach literature and natural sciences at his alma mater but in 1908, he left for Paris where he studied at the Sorbonne and the Collège de France, taking classes in philosophy and metaphysics with Henri Bergson, psychology with Georges Dumas and sociology with Émile Durkheim, thus receiving a thorough education in the liberal arts and obtaining a diploma to teach philosophy. At the same time he was able to quench his deep love for music by attending concerts and teaching himself composition.
Professional career.
Principal of Berberian School.
In 1911, Berberian was obliged to return to Constantinople to become Principal of the Berberian School, and thus was unable to complete his doctoral thesis (entitled "The Pathological Method in Psychology"). In addition to his duties at the school, he became involved in the cultural life of the Armenian community in the city. During this period, he developed a close friendship with Komitas, spending long hours discussing with him various issues in the field of the arts.
In 1918, Schahan Berberian was selected to become the director of the Central Committee of the Armenian Teachers’ Union and was appointed a member of the Central Educational Council in 1919. He was also instrumental in the foundation—and later became the chairman—of the Armenian Art Center ("Hayardun") in Constantinople. He contributed essays to Armenian newspapers in Constantinople, mostly to "Vosdan" (Den) and in 1922, along with Kegham Kavafian, Vahan Tekeyan, Hagop Oshagan and Gostan Zarian, he founded the monthly, "Partsravank" (Monastery-on-a-Hill), which was devoted to art and literature.
In 1921, he married Telli Sirakian. They had two sons, Ardavazt and Bared. Bared died as a young man at 20 years old in a motocycle accident.
Ardavazt Berberian after living in Jerusalem and Beyruth, moved to Paris with his wife (Paule), where he became a renowned painter and also extremely involved in Armenian culture. He had two sons named Vanik and Schahan, and a daughter named Gariné. 
Ardavazt died in Avignon at the age of 79, in August 2002.
1920s.
In the fall of 1922, the deteriorating political atmosphere in Turkey impelled him to leave for Europe once more and Berberian settled in Dresden, Germany, where he studied Choreography, in addition to pursuing his philosophical and aesthetic interests. In 1924, together with his older brother composer Onnig Berberian, he moved to Cairo, Egypt to relaunch the Berberian School. Strongly supported by Archbishop Torkom Koushagian of Egypt, the school became an intellectual center for the local Armenian community and remained open until 1934 when its shaky finances forced it to close its doors. In Cairo, Berberian and his long-time friend and colleague Hagop Oshagan establish two choral groups to further encourage involvement in the Armenian community: the Union of Armenian Art Lovers (1932–34) and the Berberian School Choir (1924–34).
1930s.
At the invitation of Abp. Koushagian – now the Patriarch of Jerusalem – he and his family along with Hagop Oshagan moved to the Patriarchate of St. James to teach at the Armenian Seminary there. His presence at the Seminary created much excitement and a cultural renaissance in the theological college was soon underway, fostered in part by the Armenian Cultural Union (1940–47) which he and Oshagan founded there.
1940s and 1950s.
After ten years of teaching in Jerusalem, in 1944 Berberian moved to the Catholicosate of Cilicia in Antelias, Lebanon to continue his vocation in education. Once again, he managed to create an atmosphere of educative curiosity and a passion for learning that left an indelible mark on the history of the Seminary.
Most of Berberian's compositions are written for solo voice with piano or vocal ensembles. These have only recently came more widely known thanks in no small part to the efforts of Abp. Torkom Manoogian, the present Patriarch of Jerusalem. According to Manoogian, the songs were "in my possession for some time. When Berberian visited the United States in 1949, he agreed to provide copies of his music, two songs at a time, clearly written and in final form. He did so for a while, but soon stopped. He also sent me new variations of some of the songs. I had in addition three different notebooks, copied from the composer's work by three of his students. It was from these that the rest of the songs were obtained." Fortunately, fifty of Berberian's songs were published in 1983 by St. Vartan Press in New York.
Most of Schahan Berberian's songs share a mystic lucidity and spaciousness, and a simple melodic line with minimal accompaniment – notes hanging in midair. They are fragile and laconic, the textual content always leading the recitative-like musical line.
Other Berberian manuscripts, including the incidental music to Oshagan's "Sasuntsi Tavit" (David of Sassoun) and four scenes from the opera "Anush", are at the Library of the Jerusalem Patriarchate. In addition, his literary output comprises two unpublished volumes: "Komitas vartabed—antsı yev kordzı" (Komitas—His Life and Work," 1936) and "Yergu zhamanagner" (Two Lifetimes, 1943).
While on a summer vacation in Paris, visiting his son Ardavazt, Berberian fell ill and died there on October 9, 1956.

Strawberry Fair (song)

Strawberry Fair is an English folk song (Roud Folk Song Index 173). 
The song was collected by H. Fleetwood Sheppard in Broadstone, Devon, in 1891. The text may have been re-written by Sabine Baring Gould and Fleetwood Sheppard.
Lyrics.
As I was going to Strawberry Fair,
Singing, singing, Butter-cups and Daisies
I met a maiden taking her ware,
Fol-de-dee!
Her eyes were blue and golden her hair,
As she went on to Strawberry Fair,
Ri-fol, Ri-fol, Tol-de-riddle-li-do,
Ri-fol, Ri-fol, Tol-de-riddle-dee.
"Kind Sir, pray pick of my basket!" she said,
Singing, singing, Butter-cups and Daisies
"My cherries ripe, or my roses red,
Fol-de-dee!
My strawberries sweet, I can of them spare,
As I go on to Strawberry Fair."
Ri-fol, Ri-fol, Tol-de-riddle-li-do,
Ri-fol, Ri-fol, Tol-de-riddle-dee.
I want to purchase a generous heart,
Singing, singing, Butter-cups and Daisies
A tongue that neither is nimble or tart.
Tol-de-dee!
An honest mind, but such trifles are rare
I doubt if they're found at Strawberry Fair.
Ri-fol, Ri-fol, Tol-de-riddle-li-do,
Ri-fol, Ri-fol, Tol-de-riddle-dee.
The price I offer, my sweet pretty maid
Singing, singing, Butter-cups and Daisies
A ring of gold on your finger displayed,
Tol-de-dee!
So come- make over to me your ware,
In church today at Strawberry Fair.
Ri-fol, Ri-fol, Tol-de-riddle-li-do,
Ri-fol, Ri-fol, Tol-de-riddle-dee.

St John-at-Hampstead

St John-at-Hampstead is a Church of England parish church dedicated to St John the Evangelist (though the original dedication was only refined from St John to this in 1917 by the Bishop of London) in Church Row, Hampstead, London.
History.
Hampstead was granted to the Benedictine monks of Westminster Abbey by charter in 986 but, though it is unlikely they did not place a church there soon afterwards, the first concrete record of one comes from 1312 (when it was recorded that John de Neuport was its priest) and 1333 (through a mention of a Chapel dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary). On the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the Abbey was replaced by the Bishop of Westminster, with its first and only holder Thomas Thirlby also serving as St John's rector. Thirlby appointed Thomas Chapelyne to be St John's vicar in 1545, but the see was abolished in 1551 by Edward VI, with the manor and benefice of Hampstead being granted to Sir Thomas Wrothe. The church of this era was part in stone and part in timber, and also had a minor wooden tower.
As Hampstead grew in popularity and size as an out-of-town health resort, the small existing church grew less and less adequate and derelict, being finally declared unusable by 1744. A new church was built on designs by Henry Flitcroft and John Sanderson, and dedicated on 8 October 1747 by the Bishop of Llandaff (as commissary of the Diocesan). However, by 1827 this was again too small, though initial plans by Lewis Vulliamy were rejected as too expensive and it took until 1843 for extension plans by Robert Hesketh to be agreed upon. This extended the church 30 ft westwards by means of transepts, adding 524 more seats. In 1853 the church had its first Willis organ built (it was replaced in 1883 and repaired in 1997), with Henry Willis himself employed as the organist, and in 1871 plans were mooted for 'beautifying and improving' the church. These plans originally involved the demolition of the tower, but this was shelved on protests from William Morris, Edward Burne-Jones, Holman Hunt, Ford Madox Brown, Anthony Trollope, George du Maurier, Coventry Patmore, F. T. Palgrave and others, in favour of simple extensions westwards in 1877–78 designed by F.P. Cockerell (though these extensions moved the church's high altar to the geographical west end, rather than the more usual east end).
In 1911–12 the Vestries were improved by Temple Moore, who also added a Morning Chapel, whilst in 1958 the dark Victorian interior scheme was removed and the original lighter, whitewashed scheme reinstated.
Music.
The church has a fine musical tradition stretching back as far as Henry Willis, and under the direction of Martindale Sidwell it developed a national and international reputation as being the centre of excellence for Parish Music, which it maintains today with a fully professional choir as well as a junior choir and regular high-profile concerts.
Organ.
The early records of organs date from the middle of the eighteenth century. The current organ was installed by Henry Willis in 1884. Recent restoration and rebuilding work was undertaken by Harrison and Harrison in 1964, and Bower and Co in 2000. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register. and on the parish website.
Voluntary Rate.
By virtue of the Parochial Church Councils (Powers) Measure 1956, Parochial Church Councils are entitled to levy a voluntary rate and, in 1986, Hampstead Parish Church's PCC decided to supplement their millennium redecoration appeal by this means. The levying of a voluntary rate on businesses and residents alike has now become a regular annual event.
Churchyard.
Famous individuals buried in its churchyard include:
The churchyard contains 8 war graves, comprising 6 servicemen from World War I and 2 from World War II.

Dan Cook

Daniel John "Dan" Cook, Jr. (August 12, 1926 – July 3, 2008) was a sports writer for the "San Antonio Express-News", where he worked for 51 years. He is most notable for popularizing the phrase "the opera ain't over 'til the fat lady sings." Described as a "sports icon", Cook also was a sports anchor at San Antonio television station KENS from 1956 to 2000. For most of these years, the TV station was owned by the "San Antonio Express-News".
Career.
After beginning his sportswriting career at the "Houston Post", Cook worked at the "San Antonio Express-News" from August 14, 1952 until he retired on August 3, 2003. In early 1956, he first made national headlines when, acting on a tip, he confronted a suspect in a Houston robbery and in the process wound up himself arrested and charged with armed robbery. (He would later be exonerated when the suspect confessed to the original crime.) Cook wrote his first sports column for the "San Antonio Express-News" on November 29, 1956. In addition to his newspaper and television duties, he wrote six columns per week, and had two sports telecasts and two radio commentaries daily. He also served as the "Express-News"' executive sports editor from 1960 to 1975.
The phrase.
He first said the phrase "the opera ain't over until the fat lady sings" on a 1978 newscast discussing the NBA playoff series between the San Antonio Spurs and the Washington Bullets. The phrase was then attributed to Bullets coach Dick Motta, who had borrowed it during Washington's successful 1978 title run.
The "Yale Book of Quotations" later concluded that it first appeared in print in 1976, attributed to Texas Tech sports information director Ralph Carpenter, and was a variation on an old Southern saying.
Honors and awards.
On March 1, 1996, Cook was inducted into the San Antonio Sports Hall of Fame for his work as a columnist and a broadcaster.
Personal life.
Cook was born and raised in Houston, Texas. He graduated St. Thomas High School in Houston and attended the University of Houston for two years. He had a wife, Katy, a brother, Frank Cook from Houston, two daughters, Marie Gian of Rockport and Alice Ann Ashton of San Antonio, a son, Danny Cook of San Antonio, and, at the time of his death, three grandchildren.
Death.
Cook died on the night of July 3, 2008, after a long illness.

Frederick Pepys Cockerell

Frederick Pepys Cockerell (March 1833, 87 Eaton Square, London – 4 November 1878, 66 rue François, Paris) was a British architect. He was the second son of Charles Robert Cockerell, also an architect, whose favour for French architecture and sculpture in architecture was a major influence on Frederick.
Life.
He was the second son of Charles Robert Cockerell, and was born at 87 Eaton Square in March 1833. 
In 1845, he was sent to Winchester School, and at the close of 1848 he matriculated at King's College, London, where he is recorded on the books for about five or six terms. 
He first received lessons in perspective drawing from John E. Goodchild, who was his father's clerk and intimate friend. 
During the summer of 1850, Cockerell made a sketching tour in Northern France, and on his return obtained some employment, through Sir M. Digby Wyatt, in connection with the Exhibition building in Hyde Park. 
In 1853, he spent some months studying architecture in Paris, and in 1854 exhibited, for the first time at the Royal Academy (No. 1205 of the catalogue), 'Thanksgiving in St. Paul's after the Victory over the Spanish Fleet, 1718, from Sir Christopher Wren's office window.' 
The figures were put in by W. C. Stanfield, R.A. 
In 1854, he became a pupil of Philip C. Hardwick, R.A., whose office Cockerell left in 1855, in order to visit Paris and the chief cities of Italy. 
On his return home he read a paper, at the Institute of British Architects, on the 'Architectural Accessories of Monumental Sculpture'. 
This paper received the full approbation of Professor Donaldson. 
Cockerell's first independent professional works were executed in 1858-9. 
They consisted of a cemetery chapel and some buildings at Ledbury. 
His earliest success was in raising and making additions to Coleorton Hall, the seat of Sir George Beaumont. 
This was soon followed by the planning and erecting of Down Hall, Essex ; Lythe Hill, Haslemere, Surrey ; and Crawley Court, near Winchester. 
He also erected the Carlisle memorial column at Castle Howard, and another column in Sir R. Bateson Harvey's park at Langley. 
This column is noted for its correctness of dimensions and beauty of design. 
Among his London buildings should be mentioned the Freemasons' Hall, in Great Queen Street. 
He became a member of the Grand Lodge, and was appointed to the high office of grand superintendent of works. 
He also designed the front and entrance to the Gallery of the Society of Painters in Water-Colours, Pall Mall East.
In 1867, Cockerell married Mary Mulock, daughter of Thomas Homan Mulock of Bellair, King's county - the couple had six children. 
Cockerell died suddenly, in Paris, on 4 November 1878, on which day he had been invited to a dinner party at the house of M. Viollet le Duc, the architect. 
His sudden death in Paris in 1878 was followed by a funeral procession followed by the French architects Duc, Lefuel, Hardy, Pelechet, Daumet, and Vaudremer and burial at the Auteuil cemetery, Paris.
Cockerell was a trustee of Sir John Soane's Museum, and a short time before his death was chosen assessor for the Spa buildings belonging to the Scarborough Cliff Bridge Company. 
He exhibited at the Royal Academy twenty-four works between 1854 and 1877, and was elected an associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1860, a fellow on 30 May 1864, and honorary secretary in 1871.
Works.
The following list contains some of the principal buildings erected by him in different parts of the country : 
Cockerell's competition designs for the alterations to the National Gallery were commended and much admired, and that for the Albert Memorial was selected by the judges, but the queen preferred a Gothic design, and that of Sir G. G. Scott was finally accepted. He was equally familiar both with Gothic and classic architecture, as his erected works testify.

She debuted on the International Tennis Federation (ITF) junior tour in 2007, and a year later won the Wimbledon Junior Girls' Championship at the age of 14. As a junior, she also twice reached the final of the girls' singles tournament at the Australian Open, in 2009 and 2010. She won her first professional tournament in November 2008.

Robson has appeared at least once in the main draw of every Grand Slam. She is the first British woman since Samantha Smith at Wimbledon in 1998 to reach the fourth round of a major tournament, having done so at the 2012 US Open and the 2013 Wimbledon Championships. At the 2012 Guangzhou Women's Open, Robson became the first British woman since Jo Durie in 1990 to reach a WTA main-tour final. She was named WTA Newcomer of the Year for 2012.
Early life and junior career.
Robson was born on 21 January 1994 in Melbourne, Australia, the third child of Australian parents Andrew, an oil executive with Royal Dutch Shell, and Kathy Robson, a sports coach and former professional basketball player. Robson and her family moved from Melbourne to Singapore when she was 18 months old, and then to the United Kingdom when she was six.
According to her parents, she began playing tennis "as soon as she could hold a tennis racquet", and after being encouraged by them, she entered a junior tennis academy at age seven. She signed with management company Octagon when she was 10, with Adidas at age 11, and also signed a racquet deal with Wilson Sporting Goods.
After working with several coaches, including the head of the Lawn Tennis Association Carl Maes, she chose coach Martijn Bok in 2007. Bok said later that although Robson "had trouble staying emotionally under control", he "saw right away...a lot of potential in Laura." Robson also began training at the National Tennis Centre, under the guidance of Bok, Maes, and the head of women's tennis at the centre, Nigel Sears, while taking school lessons at home.
Robson's first tournament on the junior ITF tour was in May 2007, where she went from the qualifying draw of the tournament to the quarterfinals. She reached the final of two other tournaments in 2007, and won her first tournament in October. In the first half of 2008, Robson reached the finals of three tournaments, but was also eliminated before the third round in three straight tournaments.
Robson competed in her first junior grand slam at the Wimbledon girls' event, as an unseeded player. As the youngest player in the tournament, she beat first seed Melanie Oudin on her way to the finals, where she defeated third seed Noppawan Lertcheewakarn. Her victory made her the first British player to win the girls' event since Annabel Croft in 1984, and the British media described her as the "new darling" of British tennis, and the "Queen of Wimbledon".
After a brief period on the main tour, Robson returned to junior competition but was knocked out in the second round of a tournament in December. In the same month she played her final junior tournament of 2008, the Orange Bowl, where she had to retire in the third round with a stomach strain. At the end of the year, she was shortlisted for the BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year, but lost out to Paralympic swimmer Eleanor Simmonds.
After recovering from her injury, Robson entered the , where she was seeded fifth. In the semifinals she faced a replay of her Wimbledon final, against top seed Noppawan Lertcheewakarn, whom she beat in straight sets to reach her second Grand Slam junior final. Facing third seed Ksenia Pervak from Russia, Robson was defeated in straight sets. She later attributed her loss to Pervak's greater consistency, and her coach Bok said that "everybody has to be patient". After the tournament, Robson started to train with Gil Reyes, the former trainer of Andre Agassi. She was also named the MCC Young Sportswoman of the Year. She claimed the top ranking of ITF junior tour in April, despite not playing for two months because of shin splints. the 2009 French Open Robson was the top seed in the junior's competition, but was defeated in round two by Sandra Zaniewska. Robson, as the defending champion at 2009 Wimbledon Championships but she fell in the second round to Quirine Lemoine.
Due to her focusing on her Senior career, Robson entered the 2009 US Open unseeded. In the first round she beat Ons Jabeur of Tunisia. She then faced the 7th seed Lauren Embree of the United States and beat her in three sets. She went on to face the 12th seed, Tamaryn Hendler of Belgium, who she defeated in straight sets. Robson then beat Lauren Davis in the quarter–finals. In her semi–final she faced Yana Buchina of Russia. Due to rain delay, both quarter- and semi-finals were played on the same day, therefore the semi–final match followed the quarter–final match. Despite starting strongly, Robson tired, losing the match in three sets.
At the junior singles at the 2010 Australian Open, Robson was unseeded and defeated Belinda Woolcock, Yulia Putintseva, and Cristina Dinu to reach the quarterfinals. In the last eight she easily overcame American Ester Goldfeld to move through to her fourth Junior Grand Slam semi-final where she defeated Kristyna Plíšková of the Czech Republic. She was defeated by Kristyna's twin sister Karolína Plíšková in the final. In the 2010 Wimbledon junior singles she reached the semi-finals, losing to Sachie Ishizu of Japan.
Professional career.

At the US Open, Robson won her three qualifying matches to advance into the main draw. In the first round of the main draw, she was leading when her opponent, Ayumi Morita, retired from the match. She was then beaten by Anabel Medina Garrigues .
2012.
Robson came through three rounds of qualifying at the 2012 Australian Open, beating Melanie Oudin, Anna Floris and Olga Savchuk to advance to the main draw for the first time. She lost to thirteenth seed Jelena Janković in the first round.
Robson was selected for the first time in her career to be a member of the GB Fed Cup Team to play in the Europe/Africa Group 1 match at Eilat, Israel on 1–4 February 2012. In the group stages she played doubles with Heather Watson, defeating pairs from Portugal, Netherlands and Israel in the group stages. Robson and Watson did not need to play the play-off match against Austria as Anne Keothavong and Elena Baltacha won their singles rubbers, and the 2–0 lead qualified the team for a place in the World Group II promotion play-off in April 2012.
Robson lost in the third round of qualifying for the 2012 French Open at Roland Garros. However she got a place in the first round of the main draw as a lucky loser when Silvia Soler Espinosa withdrew, but then lost her first round match to clay-court specialist Anabel Medina Garrigues.

She continued her good form in the quarter final, where she emerged victorious against the world number 41 and number 5 seed Carla Suárez Navarro in three sets. However, her run came to an end when she lost in the semi finals to Barbora Záhlavová-Strýcová in three sets. Robson then received a wild card to enter the main draw of the 2012 Swedish Open but lost her first match against Anabel Medina Garrigues.
She received a late place into the women's singles at the 2012 Olympics due to the withdrawal of Croatian Petra Martić. In her first round match, she beat the world number 22 Lucie Šafářová in straight sets, setting up a second round encounter with Maria Sharapova. She lost to the Russian world number 3 in a tightly contested match. She also competed in the doubles competition with Heather Watson, losing in the first round to the German pairing of Angelique Kerber and Sabine Lisicki. She then received a wildcard entry into the mixed doubles with Andy Murray. They were drawn against Czech pair Lucie Hradecká and Radek Štěpánek in the first round and won in three sets. In the second round the pair beat the Australian duo of Lleyton Hewitt and Samantha Stosur, and reached the final by beating Germans Sabine Lisicki and Christopher Kas, where they were beaten by the Belarusian pair Victoria Azarenka and Max Mirnyi.
Robson had direct entry to the main draw of the 2012 US Open from her WTA ranking, where she defeated Samantha Crawford in the first round. In the second round she defeated former US Open Champion Kim Clijsters in Clijsters' final singles match before her retirement. Robson consequently reached the third round of a Grand Slam tournament for the first time in her career and joined Serena Williams, Lindsay Davenport, Venus Williams, Amélie Mauresmo and Justine Henin as one of the only six people to beat Clijsters at the US Open championships, and the first player to beat her there since 2003. She followed up her performance with her first victory over a top ten player, beating 9th seed Li Na in the third round in three sets. Robson became the first female British tennis player to reach this stage of a Grand Slam tournament since Samantha Smith reached the fourth round of Wimbledon 14 years previously, but she was defeated by defending champion Stosur, ending her best run at a Grand Slam tournament to date.
Robson's next appearance was at the 2012 Guangzhou Open where she beat the then world number 22 Zheng Jie and the number three seed Sorana Cîrstea on the way to her first WTA tour final against Hsieh Su-wei. This was the first WTA singles final for any British woman since Jo Durie in 1990. Robson was eventually defeated having saved five championship points in the second set and despite taking a 3–0 lead in the third set. The result pushed her ranking inside the top 70 for the first time.
Robson qualified for the China Open and reached the second round but she lost to Lourdes Domínguez Lino in straight sets. At the HP Open in Japan, she was seeded 8th, the first time in her career she had been seeded at a WTA Tournament. She reached the quarter-finals before losing to Chang Kai-chen in three sets, but the result ensured that she finished the year with a ranking of 53.
In October, Robson was nominated for the Sports Journalists' Association Sportswoman of the Year. In November, along with Heather Watson, won "Young Sportswoman of the Year" at the "2012 Sunday Times Sportswomen of the Year Awards". Robson was also nominated for WTA "Newcomer of the Year" and "William Hill" "Sportswoman of the Year" in November, winning the former award.
2013.
At the start of the year Robson had reached the top 50 for the first time in her career. She followed this with her first victory at the 2013 Australian Open with a convincing straight sets victory over Melanie Oudin. In the second round she played former Wimbledon champion, and fellow left-hander, Petra Kvitová. Robson came back after losing the first set to beat Kvitová in a three-hour match, to set up a third-round meeting with Sloane Stephens. After stopping for several shoulder treatments, Robson was eventually beaten in two sets. After the Australian Open, Robson played six matches in Fed Cup competition that saw Great Britain earn a World Group II Play-off spot against Argentina.

Robson was seeded 16th at Charleston and reached the second round before losing to Eugenie Bouchard in three sets. At the BNP Paribas Katowice Open Robson was seeded 8th, but lost in the first round to Lourdes Domínguez Lino.
Robson represented Great Britain in the Fed Cup World Group Two play-off against Argentina. After Johanna Konta lost her opening rubber to Paula Ormaechea, Robson easily won her first match over Florencia Molinero. Robson lost her second match against Paula Ormaechea in three sets.
After several first round defeats at the start to the European clay court season, Robson defeated World Number 4 Agnieszka Radwańska in the second round of the 2013 Mutua Madrid Open. She subsequently lost to former World No. 1 Ana Ivanovic in the next round, having led 5–2 in the final set. Robson then made her debut at the Italian Open where she defeated Venus Williams in the first round but subsequently lost to her sister, World No. 1 and eventual champion Serena Williams in the second round. At the French Open Robson suffered a first round defeat to former world number one Caroline Wozniacki in straight sets.
To begin the grass court season, Robson entered the Aegon Classic tournament in Birmingham where she was seeded 7th. Despite the seed, she lost in straight sets to Slovakian, and eventual champion Daniela Hantuchová. She then participated in the 2013 Aegon International tournament (i.e. Eastbourne). In the first round, she faced Yuliya Beygelzimer in which she won in straight sets. In the second round, she lost to Caroline Wozniacki in straight sets for the second time in a row.
In the first round of Wimbledon she was drawn against the number 10 seed Maria Kirilenko, whom she beat in straight sets. She beat World No. 117, Mariana Duque-Marino, in the second round on Centre Court. In the third round, she came from a set down to beat Marina Erakovic to progress to the last 16 where she was beaten by Kaia Kanepi. Her performance pushed her up to 27 in the world, the first Briton in the top 30 since Jo Durie in 1987.
Robson started her US Open Series campaign on 30 July 2013 at the Southern California Open in Carlsbad being drawn against Ayumi Morita, whom she beat having come back from a set down in 2 hours and 40 minutes. Laura moved into the 2nd round faced with the World No. 7 Petra Kvitova from Czech Republic but lost in straight sets putting an end to her Southern California Open.
To start the Canadian Open in Toronto, Robson was due to play Yanina Wickmayer from Belgium on 5 August 2013 in her opening match but had to pull out due to a wrist injury. The same injury also led to her pulling out of the tournament in Cincinnati, however her ranking of number 32 meant that she would be seeded at a Grand Slam tournament for the first time in her career, entering the US Open as the no. 30 seed.
At the US Open, Robson returned after intensive rehab on her wrist injury and began her campaign against Spain's Lourdes Domínguez Lino, whom Robson had lost to twice previously. After winning a scrappy first set, Robson powered through the second at love. In the second round, Robson faced world number 75 Caroline Garcia of France, and won in two tight sets. Robson then fell in straight sets in the next round to Li Na in the same place they had played last year, where Robson had won.
After a break of around three weeks, Robson returned to action at the Guangzhou Open, a tournament in which she was a finalist the previous year. She started strongly, with straight sets wins over qualifier Jovana Jakšić in the first round, and Saisai Zheng of China in the second round. She subsequently lost to another Chinese player in Zheng Jie, despite taking the first set 6–1.
In October 2013, it was announced that Miles Maclagan's coaching partnership with Laura had ended and that she would be taking a couple of weeks out and starting the search for a new coach.
2014.
She started of her 2014 season at the Hobart International where she had to retire in her first round match against Yanina Wickmayer due to a left wrist injury. This injury has continued to affect her, and subsequently at the 2014 Australian Open she lost in straight sets in the first round to Kirsten Flipkens.
Playing style.
Robson plays left-handed, with a two-handed backhand. One of her strengths is her "dominant" serve. She has a strong game from the back of the court and is also noted for having an aggressive forehand return. However, she has been criticised for having "poor lateral movement". She has been praised for showing "extraordinary poise", and having "the attitude and technique required of a leading player". Commentator Simon Reed said that she "has every tool she needs", and former Grand Slam champion Pat Cash called her "a special talent" who "seems to have all the attributes to progress". Current WTA player Ana Ivanovic said that Robson "hits the ball really, really hard", former top British player Samantha Smith said that "she doesn't have any weaknesses at all", and Serena Williams stated that Robson is an "all-around good player". Robson's favourite surface to play on is grass and her favourite shot is her forehand down the line.

Betzet

Betzet () is a moshav in the Western Galilee in northern Israel. It belongs to the Mateh Asher Regional Council. It is part of the Moshavim Movement, and is located next to the cities Shlomi and Nahariya. 
The moshav was founded in 1951 by on land belonging to the Palestinian village Al-Bassa, which was destroyed in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The founders were immigrants to Israel from the Balkan states, especially the former Yugoslavia and Romania. The community is named after the ancient village of Betzet which is estimated to have existed nearby. In 2005, it had a population of about 300.
The area is about 2200 dunams. Most of the residents work in growing bananas, avocadoes and turkeys.
Places of interest nearby.
Tel Betzet ("Tel" means "hill" or "archaeological site") is located south of the village. It has pottery vessels from the Copper Age and the middle Canaanite period. Likewise wine-pressing holes and graves from the Roman and Byzantine imperial eras are preserved.
Betzet Aerodrome, a disused WW II British aerodrome to the west of Betzet. A helipad has been built on the north-western part of the runway by the Israeli Air Force. There are numerous derelict structures from the British era on site; they include AA gun mounts, underground aircraft pens and hangars.
On August 12, 1968, two Syrian MiG-17F aircraft landed in error at Betset. This incident was reported by Mr. Dov Levy- one of the lead founders of the settlement. 
The aerodrome grounds are used today as agricultural land and contain banana, olive and pomegranate groves. The Israeli Air Force uses the helipad occasionally and the local radio control flying model club has its activity on the helipad on weekends.

Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event

The Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event (GOBE or Ordovician radiation) was a diversification of animal life throughout the Ordovician period, just 40 million years after the Cambrian explosion, whereby the distinctive Cambrian fauna fizzled out to be replaced with a Palaeozoic fauna rich in suspension feeder and pelagic animals.
It followed a series of extinction events at the Cambrian-Ordovician boundary, and the resulting fauna went on to dominate the Palaeozoic relatively unchanged.
Marine diversity increased to levels typical of the Palaeozoic, and morphological disparity was similar to today's.
The diversity increase was neither global nor instantaneous; it happened at different times in different places. Consequently, there is unlikely to be a simple or straightforward explanation for the event; the interplay of many geological and ecological factors likely produced the diversification.
Causes.
Possible causes include changes in palaeogeography or tectonic activity, as well as a modified nutrient supply. The dispersed positions of the continents, high level of tectonic/volcanic activity, warm climate, and high CO2 levels would have created a large, nutrient-rich ecospace, favouring diversification. In addition, the changing geography led to a more diverse landscape, with more different and isolated environments; this no doubt facilitated the emergence of bioprovinciality, and speciation by isolation of populations. On the other hand, global cooling has also been offered as a cause of the radiation, and another alternative is that the breakup of an asteroid led to the Earth being consistently pummelled by meteorites.
The above triggers would have been amplified by ecological escalation, whereby any new species would co-evolve with others, creating new niches through niche partitioning, trophic layering, or by providing a new habitat. As with the Cambrian Explosion, it is likely that environmental changes drove the diversification of plankton, which permitted an increase in diversity and abundance of plankton-feeding lifeforms, including suspension feeders on the sea floor, and nektonic organisms in the water column. After the SPICE event about 500 million years ago, the extinction in the ocean would have opened up new niches for photosynthetic plankton, who would absorb CO2 from the atmosphere and release large amount of oxygen. More oxygen and a more diversified photosynthetic plankton as the bottom of the food chain, would have affected the diversity of higher marine organisms and their ecosystems.
Effects.
If the Cambrian Explosion is thought of as producing the modern phyla, the GOBE can be considered as the 'filling out' of these phyla with the modern (and many extinct) classes and lower-level taxa. 
Taxonomic diversity increased manifold; the total number of marine orders doubled, and families tripled. 
In addition to a diversification, the event also marked an increase in the complexity of both organisms and food webs. Taxa begun to have localized ranges, with different faunas at different parts of the globe. Communities in reefs and deeper water begun to take on a character of their own, becoming more clearly distinct from other marine ecosystems. And as ecosystems became more diverse, with more species being squeezed in to the food web, a more complex tangle of ecological interactions resulted, promoting strategies such as ecological tiering.
The global fauna that emerged during the GOBE went on to be remarkably stable until the catastrophic end-Permian extinction and the ensuing Mesozoic Marine Revolution.
The acritarch record (the majority of acritarchs were probably marine algae) displays the Ordovician radiation beautifully; both diversity and disparity peaked in the middle Ordovician. The warm waters and high sea level (this had been rising steadily since the early Cambrian) permitted large numbers of phytoplankton to prosper; the accompanying diversification of the phytoplankton may have caused an accompanying radiation of zooplankton and suspension feeders.
The planktonic realm was invaded as never before, with several invertebrate lineages colonising the open waters and initiating new food chains at the end of the Cambrian into the early Ordovician.

<doc id="18288798" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18288798" title="United States v. American Library Association">
United States v. American Library Association

United States v. American Library Association, 539 U.S. 194 (2003), was a decision in which the United States Supreme Court ruled that the United States Congress has the authority to require public schools and libraries receiving E-Rate discounts to install web filtering software as a condition of receiving federal funding. In a 6-3 ruling the Supreme Court ruled that: 1.) public libraries' use of Internet filtering software does not violate their patrons' First Amendment rights; 2.) The Children's Internet Protection Act is not unconstitutional.
Facts.
The Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA) was passed by Congress in 2000. CIPA required that in order to qualify for federal funding, public libraries had to install Internet filtering software on their computers. The American Library Association, a group of public libraries, library associations, library patrons, and Web site publishers challenged this law. They claimed that it improperly required them to restrict the First Amendment rights of library patrons. The Eastern Pennsylvania District Court ruled in a 3-0 decision that the CIPA did in fact violate patrons' First Amendment rights. The case was then appealed to the United States Supreme Court. The Court, in a decision written by Chief Justice Rehnquist, ruled on whether public libraries' use of Internet filtering software violated patrons' First Amendment rights.
Background of CIPA.
The Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) is a federal law enacted by Congress to address concerns about access to offensive content over the Internet on school and library computers. CIPA imposed certain types of requirements on any school or library that receives funding under the E-rate program, which subsidizes internet technology and connectivity for schools and libraries. In early 2001, the FCC issued rules implementing CIPA.
Conclusion.
In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court reversed the District Court's decision, and upheld the constitutionality of the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA), which requires public libraries receiving federal funds related to Internet access to install filtering devices on computer terminals that block a user's ability to view on-line pornography, as well as other obscenities that may be harmful to children. The Court reversed the judgment of the District Court that this content-based restriction on Internet speech was invalid on its face because available filtering devices "overblock" some constitutionally protected material, and thus do not meet the First Amendment's narrow tailoring requirement. The Supreme Court held that the public forum principles on which the district court relied are "out of place in the context of this case" and that Internet access in public libraries "is neither a 'traditional' nor a 'designated' public forum." A public forum is created when the government makes an affirmative choice to open up an area for use as a public forum. Libraries, however, do not acquire Internet terminals in order to "create a public forum for Web publishers to express themselves, any more than it collects books in order to provide a public forum for the authors of books to speak." The Court explained that the Internet is simply "another method for making information available in a school or library . . . is no more than a technological extension of the book stack." The Chief Justice wrote an opinion for a plurality that also included Justices O'Connor, Scalia, and Thomas. Justices Kennedy and Breyer wrote separate concurrences, and Justices Stevens, Souter, and Ginsburg dissented.
Dissent.
Justice John Paul Stevens dissented submitting that CIPA unlawfully conditioned receipt of government funding on the restriction of First Amendment rights because CIPA denied the libraries any discretion in judging the merits of the blocked websites. 
Justice David Souter (with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joining) dissented submitting that blocking an adult's access to material harmful to minors is a constitutionally-impermissible content-based restriction on the communication of material in the library's control. Justice Souter argued that strict scrutiny ought to have been applied, and that CIPA would fail this test because it was not narrowly tailored enough to achieve the government's compelling interest in protecting minors from accessing obscene images without infringing the fundamental rights of adult library patrons.
Reaction.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said that it was "disappointed" that the Supreme Court held that "Congress can force public libraries to install blocking software on library Internet terminals, but noted that the ruling minimized the law's impact on adults, who can insist that the software be disabled".
"'Although we are disappointed that the Court upheld a law that is unequivocally a form of censorship, there is a silver lining. The Justices essentially rewrote the law to minimize its effect on adult library patrons,' said Chris Hansen, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU, which had challenged the law on behalf of libraries, adult and minor library patrons, and Internet content providers."

Revaz Gabashvili

Revaz Gabashvili () (November 6, 1882 – 1969) was a Georgian politician and writer involved in the independence movement and revolutionary journalism in the early 20th century. 
Gabashvili was born of a noble family in Tiflis (Tbilisi). His mother was a popular writer Ekaterine Gabashvili. He abandoned his studies at the Montefiore Institute in Liège, Belgium, in 1905 to return to Georgia and take part in the revolution against the Russian rule. Briefly fleeing police persecution to Paris, he returned in 1907 and enrolled in the University of St. Petersburg, from where he was excluded on charges of being involved in students’ disorders in 1910. On his return to Georgia, Gabashvili engaged in opposition journalism; he founded and edited the newspaper "klde" (კლდე; "Rock"). A group of Georgians collaborating with "klde" would formed the nucleus around which the Georgian National Democratic Party organized. The party held its founding congress in June 1917, in the aftermath of the 1917 February Revolution in St. Petersburg. After Georgia’s declaration of independence (May 26, 1918), Gabashvili was elected to the Constituent Assembly for the National Democratic Party. The 1921 Red Army invasion of Georgia forced Gabashvili into exile to Paris where he wrote for local press on the politics and society of Georgia and the book "L’apport de la race caucasienne dans la civilisation mondiale" (Paris, 1967). His resonant memoirs რაც მახსოვს ("rats’ maxsovs"; "What I Remember") – published in Munich in 1959 – was highly critical of the Social Democratic leadership whom Gabashvili accused of incompetence and inability to respond Georgians’ national demands.

Summer flounder

The Summer Flounder ("Paralichthys dentatus") is a marine flatfish that is found in the Atlantic Ocean off the East coast of the United States and Canada. It is especially abundant in waters from North Carolina to Massachusetts.
Description.
"Paralichthys dentatus" (Linnaeus, 1766), also called a Fluke, is a member of the large-tooth flounder family Paralichthyidae. There are typically 5 to 14 ocellated (eye-like) spots on the body. Like most members of the left-eye flounders, they can change the color and pattern of their dark side to match the surrounding bottom, and are also capable of rapidly burrowing into muddy or sandy bottoms. The teeth are quite sharp and well developed on both upper and lower jaws. The average Summer flounder reaches sexual maturity at 2 years and weighs 1 to 3 pounds, typically 15 to 20 inches in length, though they may grow as large as 26 pounds and live up to 20 years with females making up the largest and oldest specimens. Adults are highly predatory and considered mostly piscivorous, often lying buried with only their head exposed to ambush prey which includes sand lance, menhaden, atlantic silverside, mummichog killifish, small bluefish, porgies, squid, shrimp, and crabs. While primarily considered a bottom fish, they are rapid swimmers over short distances and can become very aggressive, feeding actively at middepths, even chasing prey to the surface.
Habitat.
The Summer Flounder has a range in the western Atlantic from Nova Scotia to Florida, possibly further south where the Summer Flounder may mix and be confused with its close relative the Southern Flounder ("Paralichthys lethostigma") which lacks the eye-like spots of the Summer flounder. "Paralichthys dentatus" is most common to the coastal and shelf waters off of the northeast U.S. where they are commonly called Fluke. In the spring months fluke leave their winter stay in the deep ocean waters, where spawning occurs, to move into the inshore waters along beaches, inlets, bays, estuaries, canals, and creeks where they will stay until autumn or even early winter.
Commercial fishing, angling, and food quality.
Commercial methods for summer flounder typically include trawling. Recreational fishing is typically done while drifting in a boat or casting from shore using a wide variety of methods which include live or cut baits on a bottom rig, artificial lures, or weighted jigs tipped with strip baits. It is considered an excellent food fish with firm, mild tasting white meat.
Management.
The summer flounder is often considered to be, by far, the most important flounder along the Atlantic coast as it is important to both the commercial fishing industry and very popular for recreational fishing in the northeast United States. In addition to commercial fishing, businesses such as recreational charters, party boats, bait and tackle stores, and any number of businesses associated with boating and angling may depend on a viable summer flounder angling season. Because of this importance there has been much debate and concern over summer flounder populations and government imposed recreational size and creel regulations which currently vary from state to state. Recent debate has centered around whether Summer flounder are on the decline due to overfishing, and this has made the summer flounder an important species of topic in the reauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 2006.

Christopher Robinson (priest)

Christopher Robinson (died 19 August 1598) was an English Catholic priest and martyr, beatified in 1987.
Life.
Robinson was born at Woodside, near Westward, Cumberland. He was admitted to the English College at Reims in 1589, and was ordained priest and sent on the English mission in 1592. Two years later he was a witness of the condemnation and execution of John Boste at Durham, and wrote a graphic account. His labours seem to have been mainly in Cumberland and Westmoreland, though details are unknown.
Eventually he was arrested and imprisoned at Carlisle, by the Anglican Bishop John May. May's successor, Henry Robinson, who may have been a relative, did his best to persuade him to save his life by conforming to the Church of England. Under the anti-Catholic laws passed by Queen Elizabeth, which had outlawed Catholic priests from coming into the realm, he was condemned to death and executed.
He was beatified in 1987 by Pope John Paul II.

Palmer R. Chitester Fund

The Palmer R. Chitester Fund is a defunct libertarian-leaning Pennsylvania nonprofit corporation based in Erie, Pennsylvania. 
The Fund had three main initiatives:
The Palmer R. Chitester Fund was founded by Bob Chitester, using start-up money provided by a number of charitable sources and named in honor of his father. At the time, Bob Chitester was the general manager of two public broadcasters in Erie, Pennsylvania: the PBS channel WQLN-TV and the NPR station WQLN-FM.
History.
The origins of the foundation lay in PBS's broadcast of "The Age of Uncertainty" (1975), a 13-part BBC series produced by liberal economist John Kenneth Galbraith. The chairman of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting was a classical liberal economist, W. Allen Wallis, who had met Chitester in 1975 when he participated in a symposium on "Technology and Society" arranged by Chitester in Erie and learned that Chitester shared his classical liberal economic views. Wallis and Chitester both believed that PBS should produce a classical liberal response to "The Age of Uncertainty". Wallis therefore introduced Chitester to his old friend Milton Friedman in early 1977 (shortly after Friedman won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences). As a result, Chitester produced a 10-part PBS series entitled "Free to Choose", which first aired in early 1980. Friedman also co-authored a book with his wife Rose Friedman to accompany the television series. This book spent 5 weeks at the top of the "New York Times" Non-Fiction Best Sellers List in 1980.
It was in the context of producing the "Free to Choose" series that Chitester first organized Free to Choose Media, which became a part of the Palmer R. Chitester Fund. Free To Choose Media continues to produce media describing classical liberal economic ideas to a mass audience. Chitester and Free To Choose Media produced a documentary detailing the life of Milton Friedman, entitled "The Power of Choice", which aired on PBS in 2007. Another Free To Choose Media production, entitled "The Ultimate Resource" (named after the 1981 book "The Ultimate Resource" by Julian Lincoln Simon) also aired on PBS in 2007. The Ultimate resources has won a number of distinguished awards and continues to run on HDNet.
Beginning in 1999, the Palmer R. Chitester Fund provided funding to ABC News reporter John Stossel for his "Stossel in the Classroom" program.
izzit.org.
The organization currently known as izzit.org was initially called In the Classroom Media. Izzit.org provides teachers with materials on current events and other topics for in-classroom use. Izzit.org has used celebrities (e.g. Drew Carey) in some of its productions.
The Idea Channel no longer markets the documentaries produced by Free To Choose Media. Much of the Palmer R. Chitester Fund archival footage now appears on YouTube.

Edgardo Coghlan

Edgardo Coghlan (b. 1928 – d. September 28, 1995) was a Mexican painter who mostly specialized in watercolors depicting Mexican landscapes and people. His work became very popular during his lifetime, collected by museums, other institutions and Mexican presidents and today can be found in public and private collections in various parts of the world. His work was recognized with several awards.
Life.
Coghlan was born in Los Mochis, Sinaloa in 1928 of Irish and Mexican parents. His artistic interests and abilities became evident when he was a child, painting with watercolors since he did not have much money. As a young man, he moved to Mexico City to complete his formal and artistic studies at the Academia Nacional de Artes Plásticas and in the studio of Spanish painter José Bardasano. He lived secluded, establishing his workshop in a remote town in the State of Mexico where he lived until his death in 1995.
Career.
Coghlan opened his own studio in the 1960s. In 1967 he traveled to Israel and Jordan, sponsored by a group of collectors. When he returned his entire production from the trip was purchased by the International Art Society, over sixty paintings and several pencil drawings. He was a co founder of the Sociedad Mexicana de Acuarelistas (Mexican Society of Watercolorists) to promote the idea that this medium should be considered equal to other forms of painting.
During his career, Coghlin exhibited his work in museums and galleries on various parts of the world, especially in Mexico and the United States. He had over twenty five individual exhibitions in Mexico City in venues such as the Exhibition Hall of the President of the Mexican Republic and INFONAVIT as well as Guadalajara, Mazatlán, Los Angeles, New York. In 2008, the Instituto Sinaloense de Culutra in Sinaloa held a retrospective of his work.
Coghlin’s work can be found in the collections of the Museo de Arte Moderno, the Museo de Arte in Sinaloa, Mitchel Museum in Mount Vernon, Illinois, the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, Alfredo Guati Rojo National Watercolor Museum and various universities as well as in private collections in Mexico, the United States, Canada, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Scotland and Chile. The Toluca Watercolor Museum has forty of his works produced in 1992, valued at at least 100,000 pesos. His work was a favorite among Mexican presidents of the latter 20th century such as Adolfo López Mateos, Gustavo Díaz Ordaz, Luis Echeverría, Miguel de la Madrid and Carlos Salinas de Gortari . 
Coghlan received his first major prize in 1954 from the Círculo de Bellas Artes in Mexico. In 1955 he received first prize for a watercolor at the Salón Annual de la Acuarela, with seven more following in the next seven years. In 1968, his work “El entierro” won the Exposición Solar of the Concurso Nacional at the Palacio de Bellas Artes, as part of the cultural events of the 1968 Summer Olympics. In 1991, the state of Sinaloa awarded him the Premio Sinaloa de Ciencias y Artes. Other honors include the Premio Nacional de la Acuarela.
The artist has also had a number of events and places named after him. The Fundacion Edgardo Coghlan was founded in 1993, headquartered in the State of Mexico. It was created by collectors of Coghlan’s work as well as various admirers. That same year, he helped to found the Toluca Watercolor Museum, with one of the halls named after him. The state of Sinaloa sponsors an annual event called the Salón de la Plástica Edgardo Coghlan in Sinaloa.
Artistry.
Coghlan’s speciality was watercolor although he also did carbon sketches and near the end of his life, oils. With is watercolors, his images were realistic enough to appear as photographs from a distance, with images extending to the very edges of the paper. Elements in his work include landscapes, walking paths, oceans, volcanos and scenes of Mexican people and customs. His later oil works were known for their attention to the effects of light.
