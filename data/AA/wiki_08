Operation Jaque

Operation Jaque () was a Colombian military operation that resulted in the successful rescue of 15 hostages, including former Colombian presidential candidate Íngrid Betancourt. The hostages had been held by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). The operation took place on July 2, 2008, along the Apaporis River in the department of Guaviare.
The other hostages freed were Marc Gonsalves, Thomas Howes, and Keith Stansell, three American military contractors employed by Northrop Grumman and 11 Colombian military and police. Two FARC members were arrested.
The operation's name was derived from the Spanish term for a check in chess.
Operation details.
The intelligence gathering for the operation began long before it was actually carried out; according to one American official, Colombia had managed to place a mole within the FARC itself one year, if not more, before the operation. According to a colonel involved in the operation, Colombia had located the hostages roughly four months before the rescue. Between this time and the actual mission, Colombian forces spotted five of the hostages while they were bathing in the Apaporis river (including the three Americans), leading them to plant motion-sensors and video cameras along the waterway. At one point a FARC guerilla accidentally kicked a device while walking in the jungle to relieve himself; however, the surveillance operation's cover was not blown.
The idea of tricking the FARC into regrouping the hostages was seriously considered in late May, and the following month General Freddy Padilla de Leon brought the rescue plan to his civilian superiors. Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos is said to have agreed quickly to the plan; President Álvaro Uribe, after weighing the possible diplomatic consequences, also approved it.
Santos said the FARC rebels had been tricked into handing over the hostages by soldiers posing as members of a fictitious non-government organisation that supposedly would fly the captives to a camp to meet rebel leader Alfonso Cano; to prepare for the role, they took acting classes for a week and a half. Two soldiers impersonated a cameraman and journalist from pan-Latin American TV station teleSUR, two posed as fellow guerilla fighters, and four troops dressed as aid workers. Several aspects of the mission were apparently designed to mimic previous Venezuelan hostage transfers, including the actual composition of the group and the type and markings of the helicopters used.
According to Betancourt, the hostages were moved early on the morning of July 2 across the river to a landing zone where they were told by their captors that they were going to be moved to a different location. 
Two Mi-17 helicopters came to the landing area in Guaviare, where one, carrying Colombian agents wearing Che Guevara T-shirts, landed to pick up the hostages. In total the helicopter spent 22 minutes on the ground, during which time the hostages were handcuffed and loaded aboard; the pilot and copilot communicated with fellow security personnel in code.
The local FARC commander César and an additional rebel boarded the helicopters along with the hostages. They were persuaded to hand over their pistols and were subdued in the air by Colombian forces. Betancourt later told a press conference she at first had had no idea she was being rescued until she saw her captor naked and blindfolded on the floor of the aircraft. She and the others were told: ""Somos el Ejército Nacional. ¡Ustedes están en libertad!" (We are the national army. You are free)."
In case of failure, Colombia had prepared an armada of 39 helicopters to ferry 2000 troops plus U.S. advisors. They would have been brought within a half-mile of the original landing zone in under 15 minutes.
Alleged foreign involvement.
The United States reportedly provided a transport plane and a medical team for the liberated hostages. According to "Der Spiegel", Colombian authorities had used American spy satellites to track the location of the hostages since the beginning of 2008.
Israeli tracking technology is believed to have been used in the rescue. Some reports also highlighted the role of Global CST, a company owned by former Israeli Brigadier Generals Israel Ziv and Yossi Kuperwasser, which has a US$10 million contract with Colombia to provide security advising and equipment. According to Colombia's "W Radio", the Colombian military denied that Global CST played any direct role in the operation.
Defence Minister Juan Manuel Santos emphasized, at a press conference on July 4, that there was no direct foreign involvement of any kind in the operation. However, he did say that a U.S. surveillance aircraft monitored the situation.
Allegations of payment.
On July 4, 2008, "Radio Suisse Romande" reported that unnamed "reliable sources" had told it the rescue took place after a payment of USD 20 million by the United States. According to "Le Monde", the French Foreign Ministry denied the payment of any ransom by France. 
Frederich Blassel, "Radio Suisse Romande" journalist, told Colombia's "W Radio" that, according to his source, the release was not negotiated directly with FARC but with Gerardo Aguilar, alias César, one of the two guerrillas captured during the operation, who would have received the payment of USD 20 million. According to Blassel, the two rebels could be given new identities by Spain, France, and Switzerland.
The Minister of Defense Juan Manuel Santos, and Vice President Francisco Santos, in response to these claims, denied any payment. "That information is absolutely false. It has no basis. We don't know where it comes from and why its being said". The Minister of Defense also added with a touch of irony that "Actually, it would have been a cheap offer, because we were willing to give up to USD 100 million..." "We would be the first to inform publicly, because it is part of our rewards system policy, and besides, it would speak much worse about the FARC".
According to Colombia's "El Tiempo" and "W Radio", General Fredy Padilla de León, Commander of the Colombian Armed Forces, denied the existence of any payment by the Colombian government. General Padilla argued that if any payment had been made, it would have been better to make it publicly known, to use it as an incentive and to cause confusion within FARC's ranks. William Brownfield, the U.S. ambassador to Colombia, also denied the allegations.
In February 2009 Gerardo Aguilar was extradited to US by the Colombian Supreme Court on charges of narcotrafficking. He was charged with exchanging coca for weapons and supplies and with smuggling 1,000 kg of coca into the US since 2002. His sentimental partner, Nancy Conde Rubio (alias Doris Adriana) had already been extradited under charges of conspiring to aid and giving material support to terrorist organizations, after being captured in an independent operation.
Former French diplomat Noël Saez and Colombian journalist Gonzalo Guillen have also claimed that the Colombian government negotiated the hostage release with César in advance.
Misuse of a Red Cross emblem.
On July 15, 2008, it was reported that according to unpublished photos and video footage viewed by CNN, which the network declined to buy from its source and whose authenticity it could not verify, Colombian military intelligence misused an official International Red Cross emblem during the rescue operation. 
According to CNN, the material in question showed one man wearing a bib with the official symbol for the Red Cross shortly before the rescue operation began. CNN also reported that one frame of a heavily edited official video released by Colombian authorities two days after the operation showed a person who seemed to be the same man, wearing what appeared to be part of a Red Cross bib. 
According to international legal expert Mark Ellis, misuse of the Red Cross emblem would be a breach of the Geneva Conventions and may constitute a war crime, because it could possibly endanger the work of official humanitarian workers in the future.
During a national press conference, Colombian President Uribe had asked former hostage Ingrid Betancourt if she had seen any emblems on the helicopter participating in the rescue mission, which she denied. 
According to CNN, the unpublished video footage showed the presence of a logo with the words "Mision Internacional Humanitaria" (International Humanitarian Mission), consisting of "a stylized red bird made up of wavy red lines above two curved branches of blue leaves", pasted on the sides of the helicopter. The same logo appeared on the web site for a NGO of the same name said to be based in Barcelona, Spain, though CNN was unable to contact or verify the existence of the organization.
An official Red Cross spokesman told CNN that "the International Committee of the Red Cross cannot confirm that its logo and/or the Red Cross emblem were used...the ICRC maintains an ongoing confidential dialogue with the Colombian authorities on a variety of humanitarian issues, including news reports that the Red Cross emblem may have been used in this operation."
CNN's report mentioned that Colombian rebel groups FARC and ELN had themselves misused the Red Cross emblem in earlier incidents.
On July 16, Colombian President Álvaro Uribe announced that an internal investigation had found that one of the officers who participated in the operation had individually decided to make unauthorized use of a Red Cross emblem, claiming that he was nervous and feared the presence of armed guerrillas. President Uribe said that Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos had apologized to the International Red Cross.
After the Colombian government's declarations, Red Cross spokesperson Yves Heller stated in Bogotá, Colombia that "parties to the conflict must respect the Red Cross emblem at all times and under all circumstances." 
In Geneva, Switzerland, Red Cross spokesman Florian Westphal declared that "it was important for us that this clarification was made by the Colombian authorities at the highest level" and said that the international organization accepted the Colombian government's explanation.
Unauthorized use of real NGO information.
On July 16, 2007, Colombian newsweekly Revista Semana published an online article stating that the International Humanitarian Mission NGO didn't exist, arguing that it was created by the Colombian military for the purposes of carrying out the rescue operation, and that its website used information from a real Barcelona-based organization, Global Humanitaria. 
Semana cited a spokesperson for the Justice Department of Catalunya, Spain, who said that International Humanitarian Mission was never part of Catalunya's central register of legal entities. According to Semana's investigation, the official registry number used by the creators of the fake organization's website had been copied from the site for Global Humanitaria. Cinta Pluma, director of Global Humanitaria, denied having any participation in Operation Jaque or in the establishment of the false NGO, adding that they would consult their legal advisors before taking any action regarding the issue. 
On July 17, in an online press release, Global Humanitaria expressed surprise at the unauthorized use of their organization's registry number and website data, stated that they had never participated in any humanitarian procedures involving FARC, that they hoped to meet with Colombian President Álvaro Uribe to clear up the situation, and requested respect for the organization's work and neutrality.
Aftermath.
Immediately after the hostage rescue "El Espectador" commissioned an Ipsos-Napoleon Franco poll, which found that President Uribe's popularity had jumped from 73% to 91%, while 79% (previously 69%) of those polled stated that they would vote for him.
Betancourt, describing operation Jaque, said "I am unaware of a precedent to such a perfect mission. Maybe only the Israelis…their wonderful commandos may be reminiscent of the mission that took place here."
Immediately after the hostage rescue, Colombian military forces cornered the rest of FARC's 1st Front, the unit which had held the hostages captive. Colombian forces have so far elected not to attack the 1st Front, but is instead offering them amnesty if they surrender. 
The FARC commander Cesar, the one captured by the soldiers, was sent to the United States in July 2009, where U.S. federal courts put him on trial for trafficking in cocaine and other narcotics during his time in the FARC. He was convicted on several trafficking charges and is now serving a 27-year sentence in federal prison.
Books about Operation Jaque.
On February 2009 "Operacion Jaque" by Colonel Luis Alberto Villamarin Pulido. This book is complemented with abundant photographic material and reconstructs step by step the process, planning, implementation and outcome of the strategic operation.
In July 2010 the book was published in electronic format (Amazon Kindle). Since then it has become the most read book about the topic in Kindle. It is currently available in its printed edition, Kindle, nook, iPad, iPhone, Android and Blackberry.

Samir Roychoudhury

Samir Roychowdhury (Bengali: সমীর রায়চৌধুরী) (1 November 1933), one of the founding fathers of the Hungry Generation 1961-1965 (also known as Hungryalism or Hungrealism), was born at Panihati, West Bengal, India in a family of artists, sculptors, photographers and musicians. His grandfather Lakshminarayan, doyen of the Sabarna Roy Choudhury clan of Uttarpara, had learned drawing and bromide-paper photography from John Lockwood Kipling, father of Rudyard Kipling, who was Curator at the Lahore Museum (now in Pakistan), and thereafter established the first mobile photography-cum-painting company in India in the mid-1880s. The company was later taken over by Samir's father Ranjit (1909–1991). Samir's mother Amita (1916–1982) was from a progressive family of 19th century renaissance.
Seeds of Hungryalism হাংরি আন্দোলন.
Samir's grandfather, Sri Lakshminarayan Roy Chowdhury established a permanent photography-cum-painting shop at Patna, Bihar in 1886, the city from which Samir, along with his younger brother Malay Roy Choudhury, Shakti Chattopadhyay and Debi Ray, had launched the Hungryalism (হাংরি আন্দোলন) movement in November 1961. Samir's uncle Pramod was Keeper of Paintings and Sculpture at the Patna Museum. Pramod's daughters, Sabitri and Dharitri were accomplished veena players and classical singers. Dharitri was a painter as well. Samir's mother Amita Banerjee came from a family where her father Dr.Kishori Mohan Bandyopadhyay was a fellow researcher and an assistant of Ronald Ross, Nobel prize winner for discovering the causes of malaria. Right from childhood Samir was thus in the company of people who could groom for his later literary achievements.
Krittibas Phase.
Samir studied at City College, Calcutta, where he found as his classmates, Dipak Majumdar, Sunil Gangopadhyay and Ananda Bagchi, who were preparing to start an exclusive poetry magazine, named "Krittibas" (1953). Samir became an active member of the group. Sunil Gangopadhyay's first collection of poems "Eka Ebong Koyekjan" was funded and published by Samir. However, when Dipak Majumdar left "Krittibas", Samir along with Sandipan Chattopadhyay, Ananda Bagchi and Utpalkumar Basu were eased out of the group, although Samir had edited the Phanishwarnath Renu issue of the magazine. Samir left the group and took up a job of marine fisheries expert in a ship which most of the time was in the Arabian Sea, an experience which was later beneficial for Hungryalism inputs. His first poetry collection "Jharnar Pashey Shuye Aachhi" (ঝর্ণার পাশে শুয়ে আছি) (Sleeping Beside An Waterfall) was premised on the blueness of experience of this marine period.
Among the People.
From marine Samir shifted to inland fisheries, which gave him an opportunity to become a part of the poorest boatmen, fishermen and fishnet-knitters families of rural and riverine India. For three decades he travelled extensively in such tribal areas as Chaibasa, Dumka, Daltonganj, Bhagalpur, Muzaffarpur, Darbhanga etc. places. These places were the centres where the Hungryalist poets, writers and painters gathered and engaged in creative happenings which has become a part of Bengali literary folklore. During this period Samir emerged as one of the original thinkers, a school of thought later termed as "Adhunantika" by the famous linguist Dr Prabal Dasgupta. Young writers, poets and artists as well as film makers visited him during his tribal sojourn. Among the visitors were Octavio Paz, Allen Ginsberg, Peter Orlovsky, Gary Snyder, Rajkamal Choudhury, Phanishwarnath Renu, Dharmavir Bharati, Santoshkumar Ghosh, S H Vatsayan Ajneya, Falguni Ray, Basudeb Dasgupta, Subo Acharya, Tridib Mitra, Alo Mitra etc. Shakti Chattopadhyay stayed with him at Chaibasa for more than two years. He is still an important figure before the contemporary younger poets and thinkers ( like Anupam Mukhopadhyay ) .
Creative work.
Creativity ran in the veins, so early in life both Samir and his brother Malay directed many plays including 'Kauwa Babula Bhasm' the script of which was prepared by the noted writer Phanishwar Nath 'Renu'.
Samir has been creative off and on. After his first collection of poems he published "Aamar Vietnam" a collection of poems, though not based on Vietnam, but premised on the sensitivity of a person who lives in a different world and is regularly bombarded by war-news which are shockingly inhuman. Then after a decade his third collection of poems "Janowar" (জানোয়ার) (The Animal) was published written in a different vein. Among the Hungryalists, he is considered to be a master of word formation and language-plasticity. He shifted his base permanently to Calcutta (Kolkata) in the beginning of 1990s and started his own magazine aptly called HAOWA#49 or Unapanchash Vayu in Sanskrit which is a state of unknown mind. He also started Haowa#49 Publications for which his younger brother Malay Roy Choudhury joined as Creative Consultant. HAOWA#49 (হাওয়া # ৪৯) magazine virtually changed the avant garde literary scene. People who were once critical of the Hungry Generation movement (হাংরি আন্দোলন), and even denigrated Hungryalism, started respecting them. Post-graduate thesis have been written on the two bothers, considered to have up-welled fresh mind-waves in an otherwise stagnant creative pool.
Adhunantika controversy.
Samir wrote several treatises on "Adhunantika" aspects of our Indian, especially Bengali society, that have impacted post-colonial mindset, and obviously arts, literature and culture. Critics have claimed that "Adhunantika" is "Postmodern" version of Hungryalism, and that postmodern features Bengali creative writing had emerged way back in 1960s when the Hungry generation movement was launched with freely distributed weekly bulletins which could have been published by any participant of the movement. Samir introduced an Indianised version of postmodernism which was being called, apart from Adhunantika, Uttaradhunika, Uttar-Adhunika, Bitadhunika, Bhashabadal, Atichetana, Adhunikottarvad etc. Hungryalism got a new valuation with these concepts, and the newer generation of poets, writers and thikners got an alternative platform. Samir edited, since 1990, books on Ecofeminism, Postcolonialism, Postmodernism, Complexity, Hybridity and The Other. He edited Postmodern Bengali Poetry (2001) and Postmodern Bengali Short Stories (2002) which included writings from Bangladesh as well as entire India. Earlier only upper-caste writers from West Bengal used to have prime of place in such collections. Samir changed it all; he invited poems and short stories from all strata of, not only West Bengal, but entire India and Bangladesh. A new word Bahirbanga was coined by him for diasporic Bengalis.
Film.
Srijit Mukherji has directed a film in 2011 titled Baaishey Shrabon wherein the role of Hungryalist poet has been portrayed by famous film-director Gautam Ghosh.

Ronald Jones (interdisciplinarian)

Ronald Jones (born July 8, 1952 in the United States) an artist, critic and educator who gained prominence in New York City during the mid-1980s. In the magazine "Contemporary", Brandon Labelle wrote: “Working as an artist, writer, curator, professor, lecturer and critic over the last 20 years, Jones is a self-styled Conceptualist, spanning the worlds of academia and art, opera and garden design, and acting as paternal spearhead of contemporary critical practice. Explorative and provocative, Jones creates work that demands attention that is both perceptual and political.” Labelle positions Jones along the leading edge of a “contemporary critical practice” that is perhaps best described as interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary. 
1980s.
Jones graduated in 1974, with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Montomery, Alabama's Huntingdon College. He completed an MFA degree in sculpture from the University of South Carolina, followed by a Ph.D. in Interdisciplinary Arts at Ohio University where he wrote about a collaboration between Samuel Beckett and Marcel Duchamp. In 1983 he was included in a group exhibition titled "A Likely Story," at Artists space in New York City which was curated by Valerie Smith and included Gretchen Bender, David Cabrera, and Jeff Koons. In 1985 he moved to New York City and two years later had his first solo exhibition at Metro Pictures Gallery. In the New York Times, Roberta Smith wrote: “Mr. Jones's main goal seems to be to thwart the eye with formal incoherence and an overload of written information that the mind must digest before his pieces make sense. But the sense made is never visual. Instead, if one wades through the long illustrated paragraph that constitutes each work's title, learning the artwork or event that each component represents, a kind of odd and often frightening poetic logic accrues.”
Jones is represented by Metro Pictures Gallery where his last of six solo shows was in 1998. 
Jones began his curatorial practice in 1986, when he assembled The Public Art Show with a catalog designed by Louise Lawler and a poster by Barbara Kruger. He went on to organize eleven exhibitions for New York City galleries (Metro Pictures, Lehmann Maupin and Josh Baer) and European and Scandinaviany institutions ("Dark Side of the Moon," Stockholm Cultural Capital of Europe Arkipelag project, 1998 and Magasin 3 Projekt Djurgårdsbrunn, 2003).
In 1987, he began writing criticism for "Arts Magazine" and "Artscribe". Soon after, he began contributing articles, essays and reviews to "Frieze", "Artforum", "Bookforum", "Art in America", "Parkett", "Cabinet", "Zone" and others. Jones wrote numerous catalogs for other artists including Elizabeth Peyton,
Laurie Simmons, David Salle, Terry Winters, Richard Phillips, Carroll Dunham, and Keith Edmier.
In 1989 Jones was invited to join the faculty at the School of Art, Yale University as Critic in Sculpture and ultimately was named Senior Critic.
1990s.
In 1992 Jones served as the spokesman for the National Endowment of the Arts peer-review panel for fellowships in sculpture, which launched one of many high-profile national debates on censorship and First Amendment issues in the arts. Jones later served on a think-tank at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University which considered the future of culture in the United States in light of a diminished National Endowment of the Arts.
In 1993 he had a solo exhibition at the Sonnabend Gallery in New York City. As his work continued to be exhibited internationally (including solo exhibitions in Berlin, Tokyo, Los Angeles, Paris, and Cologne) Jones was commissioned to design garden projects including Pritzker Park in Chicago, the Rethymnon Centre of Contemporary Art in Crete, the Botanical Gardens in Curitiba, Brazil, Caesar’s Cosmic Garden Boras Konstmuseet, Sweden and a garden for the city of Hamburg, Germany among others. 
In 1995, ArtForum magazine's "Best and Worst 1995" article stated that Jones should be "a nominee for a lifetime achievement award for contemporary-art awfulness."
In 1998 he was appointed professor and Chairman of the Visual Arts Department at Columbia University. At Columbia he was the Director of the Digital Media Center and Co-Director of the Interactive Design Lab. While at Columbia he served on the faculty of the MA Colloquia in the Masters Program in Critical Studies, Department of Art History and Archeology and taught in seminars at The Computer Music Department.He continued to serve as a Visiting Professor at Konstfack, University College of Arts, Crafts and Design, in Stockholm, Sweden, which he had done since 1996. He served on the Boards of Artists Space, the Public Art Fund, and Franklin Furnace, all in New York City, the Princeton Sculpture Symposium, and was a Member of the Executive Committee of the Lucent Project, Brooklyn Academy of Music.
In 1999, Jones conceived of, and wrote the libretto for "Falling and Waving," the first computer generated opera produced by the Brooklyn Academy of Music and Arts at Saint Ann's in New York City.
2000s.
In 2001 he was appointed as the first Provost at Art Center College of Design where he guided the design and implementation of a new transdisciplinary curriculum for the College.
In 2002, he earned a Certificate from the Harvard University Graduate School of Education.
Presently Jones is Professor of Interdisciplinary Studies at Konstfack University College of Arts, Crafts and Design in Stockholm, Sweden where he leads The Experience Design Group, with a mission "to persuade, stimulate, inform, envision, entertain, and forecast events, influencing meaning and modifying human behavior.” At Konstfack, Jones also co-directs WIRE, the MA program in curatorial practice and critical writing.
Jones is a Center Director at Konstfack for the Stockholm School of Entrepreneurship (SSES), an interdisciplinary initiative by Karolinska Institutet, the Royal Institute of Technology, the Stockholm School of Economics, the Stockholm University and Konstfack.
Jones is a Guest Professor of Experience Design at NID, the National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad, India. He has also served on the faculty of The Royal Danish Academy of Art, Copenhagen, The School of Visual Arts, New York, and Staatliche Hochschule für Bildende Künste, Städelschule Frankfurt, Germany and as a visiting professor at Bezalel Academy of Art and Design, Israel's national school of art.
With his appointment at Konstfack as Professor of Interdisciplinary Studies, he has been able, along with the faculty of The Experience Design Group, to create a graduate program especially designed to prepare students to become interdisciplinarians, or even transdisciplinarians. “Interdisciplinarity,” says Jones “is by now a stand-alone discipline, as much as the conventional disciplines of art, design or craft.”
Writing, Lectures, Collections.
Jones writes regularly for "Artforum" and has a monthly column for "Frieze".
He has delivered over two hundred lectures to universities, museums, art and design schools, including Harvard University, The Art Institute of Chicago, Yale University, The Whitechapel Art Gallery, London, The Whitney Museum of American Art, The Guggenheim Museum, The Rhode Island School of Design, Parsons School of Design, DIA Center for the Arts, New York City, Royal College of Art, London, Center for Advanced Studies in the Visual Arts at MIT, Carnegie Mellon University, Brown University, Akademie Der Bildenden Künste, Vienna, the Architectural Association School of Architecture, London, among others.
His art is in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Guggenheim Museum, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, and the Moderna Museet, Stockholm, among others.

Oklahoma City Thunder

The Oklahoma City Thunder are an American professional basketball franchise based in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. They play in the Northwest Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA); their home court is at Chesapeake Energy Arena.
The Thunder's NBA Development League affiliate is the Tulsa 66ers, who are owned by the Thunder. The Thunder, along with the Tulsa Shock -- a Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) franchise based in Tulsa, Oklahoma -- are the only teams in the major professional North American sports leagues based in the state of Oklahoma.
Formerly the Seattle SuperSonics, the team relocated in 2008 after a dispute between owner Clay Bennett and lawmakers in Seattle, Washington. The SuperSonics qualified for the NBA Playoffs 22 times, won their division six times, and won the 1979 NBA Championship. In Oklahoma City, the Thunder qualified for their first playoff berth during the 2009–10 season. They followed that success by winning their first division title as the Thunder in the 2010–11 season and their first Western Conference championship as the Thunder in the 2011–12 season, appearing in the NBA Finals for the fourth time in franchise history and first since 1996, when the club was based in Seattle.
Franchise history.
1967–2008: Seattle SuperSonics.
The Thunder's previous incarnation, the Seattle SuperSonics, were formed in 1967. In their 41 years in Seattle, the SuperSonics compiled a 1,745–1,585 (.524) win–loss record in the regular season and 107–110 (.493) in the playoffs. The franchise's titles include three Western Conference championships and one NBA title in 1979.
Relocation to Oklahoma City.
In 2006, the SuperSonics were sold for $350 million to a group of Oklahoma City investors led by Clay Bennett, a move approved by NBA owners the following October. In 2007, Bennett announced that the franchise would move to Oklahoma City as soon as the lease with KeyArena expired.
In June 2008, a lawsuit between the City of Seattle and Bennett regarding Bennett's attempts to break the final two years of the Sonics' lease at KeyArena went to federal court, and nearly a month later the two sides reached an agreement to settle. The terms awarded the city $45 million to get out of the remaining lease at KeyArena, and could provide an additional $30 million payment to Seattle in 2013 if certain conditions are met. The owners agreed to leave the SuperSonics name, logo and colors in Seattle for a possible future NBA franchise; however, the items would remain the property of the Oklahoma City team along with other "assets," including championship banners and trophies. On September 3, 2008, the team name, logo, and colors for the Oklahoma City franchise were revealed to the public. The name "Thunder" was chosen due to Oklahoma being a frequent victim of powerful storms for its location in the Tornado Alley, and Oklahoma City housing the 45th Infantry Division, the Thunderbirds.
2008–2009: Inaugural season in Oklahoma City.
The Thunder participated in the Orlando Pro Summer League featuring their second-year players, potential free agents and rookies. The players wore generic black and white jerseys reading "OKC-NBA" against an outline of a basketball. The Thunder's temporary practice facility was the Sawyer Center at Southern Nazarene University, which had been used by the New Orleans Hornets when they relocated to Oklahoma City after Hurricane Katrina.
The Thunder played several preseason games before the 2008–2009 regular season, but only one of those games was in Oklahoma City. The Thunder made their first appearance in Billings, Montana on October 8, 2008 in an 88–82 preseason loss against the Minnesota Timberwolves. The Thunder played their first Ford Center game on October 14 against the Los Angeles Clippers.
In their regular-season home opener, the Thunder faced (and lost to) the Milwaukee Bucks. Earl Watson scored the first points of the season with a layup. Three nights later on November 2, the Thunder won their first game as a franchise by defeating the Timberwolves, improving their record to 1–3. The team then went on a 10-game losing streak before deciding on November 22 to fire head coach P. J. Carlesimo and assistant Paul Westhead. Assistant coach Scott Brooks then took over on an interim basis. Oklahoma City lost its next four games to tie the dubious franchise losing streak of 14 set in Seattle the previous season. But the team managed to prevent history by winning their next game on the road against the Memphis Grizzlies.
As the season continued, the Thunder began to improve. After starting 3–29, the Thunder finished the regular season 20–30 for the remaining fifty games. Not only were they winning more often, they played much more competitively than in the first part of the season. The team brought their record to 23–59 and improved upon their record of 20–62 from the team's final season in Seattle. The late-season successes of the Thunder contributed to the signing of Scott Brooks as the team's official head coach.
After moving to Oklahoma City from Seattle, the team's operating situation improved markedly. In December 2008, "Forbes Magazine" estimated the team's franchise value at $300 million – a 12% increase from the previous year's $268 million when the club was located in Seattle. "Forbes" also noted an increase in percentage of available tickets sold, from 78% in the team's last year in Seattle to 100% in 2008–09.
2009–2010: The turnaround season.
After an inaugural season filled with many adjustments, the Thunder hoped to improve during their second season in Oklahoma City. Oklahoma City did not make any major moves in the offseason, other than drafting James Harden from Arizona State University with the third overall pick in the NBA Draft. The Thunder selected Rodrigue Beaubois with the 25th pick in the 2009 draft before immediately trading him to the Dallas Mavericks for the 24th pick, C Byron Mullens from Ohio State University. The team then added veterans C Etan Thomas and G Kevin Ollie. The last major change to their roster occurred on December 22, 2009, when the team traded for Eric Maynor from the Utah Jazz. Maynor immediately supplanted Ollie as the backup point guard.
From the outset the young team looked determined and cohesive. The increasing leadership of Kevin Durant, along with the growing experience of the Thunder's younger players (including future All-Star Russell Westbrook, Harden and Serge Ibaka), were encouraging signs that the Thunder were improving. The 2009–10 season included several victories over the NBA's elite teams, including a 28-point blowout over the Eastern Conference champion Orlando Magic and a 16-point blowout of the reigning NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers. Road victories over the San Antonio Spurs, Utah Jazz, Miami Heat, Boston Celtics and Dallas Mavericks greatly enhanced their reputation. Though they hovered around .500 for the first half of the season, they eventually went on a 9-game winning streak that sent them into serious playoff contention. Kevin Durant became the youngest player in league history to win the scoring title, averaging 30.1 points per game while playing in all 82 games.
The Thunder finished 50–32, more than doubling their win total from the previous season. The 50–32 tied with the 2008 Denver Nuggets as the best 8th seed in the modern Playoffs era, at least in terms of record. The Oklahoma City Thunder also had the same record as the Boston Celtics in this season. They finished fourth in the Northwest Division and eighth in the Western Conference playoff standings, and earned a spot in the 2010 NBA Playoffs. On April 22, the team secured their first playoff win in Oklahoma City when they defeated the defending-champion Los Angeles Lakers 101–96. This was also the Thunder's first playoff win at the Ford Center. However, the Thunder tied the series at 2 games each, but the Lakers won the last 2 games in the series to win it 4-2. (One of these games was in Oklahoma City.)
Oklahoma City ranked twelfth in overall attendance in the NBA, and seventh in percentage of available seats occupied (98%, including 28 sellouts in 41 home games). The team's operating situation also continued to improve in 2009–10. "Forbes Magazine" estimated the team's franchise value at $310 million (an increase of $10 million over the prior year) with an estimated operating profit of $12.7 million (the first operating profit in years for the franchise).
2010–2011: Rise to prominence.
Financially, the Thunder organization continued to build on the positive returns experienced from relocating from Seattle to Oklahoma City. In January 2011, "Forbes Magazine" estimated the franchise's worth at $329 million, up 6% from 2009–10 and ranking No. 18 in the NBA. The magazine also estimated the franchise's revenue at $118 million and operating profit at $22.6 million – up 6.3% and 78%, respectively, from the previous year. The Thunder finished the 2010–2011 season with a 55–27 record, a five-win increase from their breakout season the previous year. The team also captured their first division title since moving to Oklahoma City, and seventh in franchise history.
In the wake of a fourth-seed versus fifth-seed match-up against the Denver Nuggets, Kevin Durant scored 41 points in Game 1 to set a new career playoff high. In the final game of the series, he again scored 41 and forward Serge Ibaka nearly tied the record for most blocks in a playoff game (10, set by Mark Eaton, Hakeem Olajuwon and Andrew Bynum) with 9 blocks. With the victory, the Thunder won the series, 4 games to 1, set to face off against the Memphis Grizzlies who achieved an eight-seed upset over the San Antonio Spurs just days before. The Thunder advanced to the Western Conference Finals with a seven-game series triumph over the Grizzlies. Durant was again the star, scoring 39 points in the clinching Game 7, while Russell Westbrook also had a triple-double. Despite hard-fought battles with the eventual NBA champs, the Thunder fell to the Dallas Mavericks 4–1 in the Western Conference Finals. The Thunder had a chance to tie the series in Game 4, but they were unable to hold a 15-point lead with five minutes remaining in the fourth quarter and ended up losing in overtime by the score of 112–105.
2011–2012: Making the Finals.
During the extended lockout, Thunder players (notably Durant, Harden, Ibaka and Thabo Sefolosha) played in exhibitions in the United States and in other countries to stay in shape. When the abbreviated training camp began, OKC started with an intact roster and all players, with the exception of Russell Westbrook, under contract up for the near future. In addition, Kendrick Perkins lost more than 30 pounds during the lockout. The Thunder made their two pre-season appearances, after the lockout, against the Dallas Mavericks, winning both games. They won their first regular-season game against Orlando at home and went on a five-game winning streak. Kevin Durant became the sixth player to score 30 or more points in four consecutive games at the start of a season. In addition, the Thunder was the first to sweep their back-to-back-to-back games, winning a home-and-home series with the Houston Rockets, then routing the San Antonio Spurs. In addition, Thunder players Durant, Westbrook, Harden, Perkins, and Ibaka made it onto the 2012 All-Star ballots. After the Thunder's win over the Utah Jazz on February 11, 2012, Scott Brooks was named the Head Coach of the Western Conference All-Star squad for the 2012 NBA All-Star Game in Orlando, Florida.
In the 2012 NBA Playoffs, the Thunder swept the defending champion Dallas Mavericks in the first round to advance and face off against their first-round foes from 2010, the Los Angeles Lakers. They defeated the Lakers in five games and advanced to play the San Antonio Spurs in the Western Conference Finals. The Thunder lost the first two games against the Spurs but won the next three including a Game 5 road win, to take a commanding 3–2 game lead in the series. In Game 6, the Thunder defeated the Spurs 107–99 and advanced to the 2012 NBA Finals. Durant led the way with 34 points, playing all of regulation time in the game. In the 2012 NBA Finals against the Miami Heat, the Thunder won the first game at home but then lost four in a row and lost the series in five games.
2012–present.
In the 2012 NBA draft, the Thunder selected Baylor University forward Perry Jones III with the 28th overall pick. The Thunder also signed free agents Hasheem Thabeet and Daniel Orton, and signed guards Andy Rautins and DeAndre Liggins, as well as re-signing forward Serge Ibaka to a four-year, $48 million extension. After failing to sign James Harden to an extension that was reportedly worth four years and $52 million, OKC decided to trade Harden rather than having to pay the luxury tax penalty. On October 27, 2012, the Thunder traded Harden along with center Cole Aldrich and forwards Daequan Cook and Lazar Hayward to the Houston Rockets for Kevin Martin, Jeremy Lamb, first-round draft picks from Toronto and Dallas, and one second-round draft pick. Martin took over Harden's sixth-man role for the season. The Thunder finished with a 60–22 regular season, taking both the Northwest division title and top seed of the Western Conference. In the first round of the playoffs, they faced the 8th-seeded Houston Rockets, featuring former team member James Harden. In game 2 of the series, Russell Westbrook was struck by Rockets PG Patrick Beverley, and fell down with an injury and missed the rest of the playoffs after having knee surgery. Without the team's second-leading scorer, the Thunder, who had a 3–0 lead, lost the next two games to bring the series to 3–2. In game 6, the Thunder defeated the Rockets to advance to the second round, facing a rematch of the 2011 second round, with the Memphis Grizzlies. The Thunder lost the series 4–1, losing four straight games after winning Game 1 at home.
In the 2013 NBA draft, the Thunder selected 12th pick Steven Adams, 21st pick Andre Roberson, and 47th pick Grant Jerrett. Kevin Martin's contract expired, soon signing with the Timberwolves. In addition to Oklahoma City's offseason movements, they signed free agent Ryan Gomes.

Home arenas.
"Note: All arenas used before 2008 were part of the defunct Sonics franchise."
Seattle arenas had hosted two NBA All-Star Games; the 1974 game in Seattle Center Coliseum and the 1987 game in the Kingdome, where Sonics forward Tom Chambers grabbed MVP honors.
Chesapeake Energy Arena (2008-present).
Originally opened in 2002, Chesapeake Energy Arena was built without many of the luxury accommodations ultimately planned for it. The arena had been designed to accommodate such luxury "buildouts" should a professional sports franchise locate to the city.
A plan for such build-out improvements began in 2007 in the wake of the acquisition of the Seattle Supersonics by an Oklahoma City-based ownership group the previous October. A city ballot initiative on March 4, 2008 – approved by a 62% to 38% margin – extended a prior one-cent city sales tax for a period of fifteen months in order to fund $101 million in budgeted improvements to the arena, as well as fund a separate $20 million practice facility for a relocated franchise.
Renovation work on Chesapeake Energy Arena was delayed due to a sales tax-receipts shortfall during the 2008–10 economic crisis; eventual tax receipts totaled $103.5 million rather than the projected $121.6 million. The shortfall was accommodated by revising plans for certain features of the arena expansion project, including limiting the size of a new glass entryway and eliminating a practice court planned for above the delivery entrance of the arena. Major construction work on the arena expansion was also delayed from the summer of 2010 to the summer of 2011. Seating capacity of the stadium is 18,203 for professional NBA basketball games.
Similar revisions were made to the plans for the Thunder's separate practice facility, for a total cost savings of approximately $14 million. The Thunder's practice facility completion date was similarly pushed back to approximately March 2011.
Mascots.
"Note: All mascots used before 2008 were part of the defunct Sonics franchise."
Rumble the Bison.
On February 17, 2009, Rumble the Bison was introduced as the new Oklahoma City Thunder mascot during the halftime of a game against the New Orleans Hornets. Rumble was the winner of the 2008–2009 NBA Mascot of the Year.
Fanbase.
During the 2012 NBA Finals, sportswriter Bill Simmons published a piece on the team's fan base in his ESPN-sponsored Web outlet, "Grantland.com", in which he noted the unusual enthusiasm of the city for its team:With the possible exception of Portland, no NBA team means more to its city. This goes beyond having the loudest fans. There's genuine devotion here. These people arrived a good 45 minutes early for last night's Game 1 — and by "these people" I mean "everyone with a ticket" — then clapped their way through pregame warm-ups with such infectious enthusiasm that I remember saying to a friend, "No way these yahoos keep this up for three hours, they're going to burn out." Wrong. You know what burned out? My eardrums. My head is still ringing.
Simmons speculated that the Oklahoma City bombing played a major part in the team's culture, noting that Thunder general manager Sam Presti has every new Thunder player visit the Oklahoma City National Memorial, and encourages all players to look into the stands and consider that many of the team's fans were personally affected by the event. He also noted, however, that the fact that the Thunder is the only team from Oklahoma City (or indeed the state) in one of the nation's four major leagues contributes mightily to the city's devotion.
Thunder fans are also reportedly much more likely to attend major home games than most other NBA fanbases. According to a source in the ticket industry, only 5 percent of tickets to the 2012 NBA conference finals that were listed for sale on secondary market sites such as StubHub were for Thunder home games, and for every ticket listed for a Thunder home game in the 2012 NBA Finals, 10 tickets for Heat home games were listed.

Logo and uniforms.
The Oklahoma City Thunder unveiled their first logo on September 3, 2008, showing a shield with a basketball on it. According to majority owner Clay Bennett, the team's logo takes several of its elements from other Oklahoma sports teams such as the collegiate Sooners and Cowboys. The uniform design was unveiled on September 29, 2008.
An alternate uniform was unveiled on November 8, 2012, featuring only blue and white colors. Unlike their regular uniforms, the wordmarks on the alternate are written vertically.
Television and radio.
Radio.
All Thunder games are broadcast on the Thunder Radio Network, fronted by flagship stations WWLS-FM 98.1 and KWPN AM 640 in Oklahoma City. Matt Pinto is the radio voice of the Thunder.
TV.
For their first two seasons, the Thunder's TV broadcasts were split between Fox Sports Oklahoma (a regional fork of FS Southwest), which broadcast most of the games, and independent station KSBI (channel 52), with around 65 Thunder games airing during the season and more than half of the games available in HD on FS Oklahoma, along with other team-related programming such as pregame shows. Around 15 to 20 regular-season games were broadcast over the air on KSBI, which had a network of rebroadcasters spanning the entire state. All televised games are called by Brian Davis on play-by-play and Grant Long as color commentator. During the 2009–2010 season, KSBI telecast all Thunder games it aired in high definition (KSBI had previously aired in HD the first regular-season game played at the Ford Center – against the Milwaukee Bucks on October 29, 2008 – while all other games during the 2008–2009 season were telecast on KSBI in standard definition). On August 3, 2010, the Thunder signed a new exclusive multi-year agreement with Fox Sports Oklahoma, beginning with the 2010–11 season, ending the team's broadcasts on KSBI. On October 22, 2012, the Thunder announced that Lesley McCaslin will be the new Thunder sideline reporter.

<doc id="18256234" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18256234" title="LGBT rights in Scotland">
LGBT rights in Scotland

Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) rights in Scotland are generally in line with the rest of the United Kingdom, which have evolved extensively over time and are now regarded one of the most progressive in Europe.
Same-sex sexual activity has been legal since 1980 and the age of consent has been equalized since 2001. Same-sex marriage was approved by Scottish Parliament in February 2014 and is currently being reviewed, whilst civil partnerships for same-sex couples have been legal since 2005. Same-sex couples have also been granted joint and step adoption since 2009 and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity have been banned since 2005.
Laws regarding same-sex sexual activity.
In Scotland, there were no statutes making sex between men unlawful between 1424 and 1707, though homosexual acts were punishable. One example is the commission for trial of Gavin Bell.
The United Kingdom Parliament voted to pass the Sexual Offences Act 1967 for the limited decriminalisation of homosexual acts in only England and Wales. Homosexual activities were legalised in Scotland — on the same basis as that which was used for the 1967 Act — by Section 80 of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980. Section 2A, the legislation that prevented the promotion of homosexuality, was repealed in Scotland within the first two years of the existence of the Scottish Parliament by the "Ethical Standards in Public Life etc. (Scotland) Act 2000".
Recognition of same-sex relationships.
Same-sex marriage.
Same-sex marriage in Scotland has been made legal, pending royal assent and coordination with the UK Parliament, secondary legislation, and implementing activities. The law provides that religious organizations and individual celebrants are under no obligation to perform marriage ceremonies for same-sex couples, though religious organizations are permitted to authorize their clergy to do so.
On 25 July 2012, the Scottish Government announced that it would legalise same-sex marriage. The move was announced despite the opposition by the Church of Scotland and the Catholic Church in Scotland. Although Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the move as the "right thing to do", she reassured churches that they would not be forced to perform same-sex marriages. During the consultation phase, ministers received over 19,000 messages from constituents about the issue.
On 27 June 2013, the Scottish Government introduced the Marriage and Civil Partnerships Bill (Scotland) in the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Parliament will vote on whether to enact the Bill into Scots law on 4 February 2014. If passed into law, it is expected that the necessary administrative changes to the civil marriage system in Scotland will take around 12 months to complete.
On 4 February 2014, Scottish Parliament held its final, State 3 vote on a bill to permit same-sex marriages. The bill passed by a vote 108-15. The UK Parliament had already agreed to make necessary amendments to the UK Equality Act 2010 if the Scottish Parliament enacted same-sex marriage legislation, so as to allow certain religious and faith organisations to be exempted from having to conduct, or be involved in same-sex marriage if it contravenes their beliefs, as is also provided in the Scottish bill. The first same-sex weddings are expected to occur in Autumn 2014.
Civil partnerships.
Civil partnerships have been a right of same-sex couples in Scotland to access since 2005, when the UK Parliament passed the Civil Partnership Act 2004. The Act gives same-sex couples most (but not all) of the rights and responsibilities of civil marriage. Civil partners are entitled to the same property rights as married opposite-sex couples, the same exemption as married couples on inheritance tax, social security and pension benefits, and also the ability to get parental responsibility for a partner's children, as well as responsibility for reasonable maintenance of one's partner and their children, tenancy rights, full life insurance recognition, next of kin rights in hospitals, and others. There is a formal process for dissolving partnerships akin to divorce.
The legalisation of same-sex marriage in Scotland has had several notable impacts on legislation relating to Scottish civil partnerships. Though the Scottish Government has yet to decide whether or not to open civil partnerships to mixed sex couples, the Government has elected to introduce:
Adoption and parenting rights.
Effective on 28 September 2009, approved legislation allowed same-sex couples to adopt children in Scotland. At the same time, the Looked After Children (Scotland) Regulations 2009 came into effect, which allows same-sex couples to be considered as foster parents on the same basis as anyone else.
The legal position regarding co-parenting arrangements where a gay man/couple donates sperm to a lesbian couple is complex. Following the changes implemented by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008, lesbian couples who conceive with donated sperm are likely to be treated as both being the parents of their child. If the lesbian couple a man is donating to are civil partners/married, the father’s status will be automatically excluded. If the lesbian couple he is donating to are not civil partners/married, the mothers may be able to choose whether they wish the child’s second parent to be the father or the non-birth mother.
Altruistic surrogacy is legal in the United Kingdom, including Scotland. The law supports gay fathers conceiving through surrogacy in the UK in the same way as it does heterosexual couples and allows for applications to the relevant court, for such parents who wish to be named on their child's birth certificate as the legal parents/guardians of the child.
Discrimination protections.
The passage of the Equality Act 2010 by the Parliament of the United Kingdom directly impacted on Scotland. Since implementation, the Act has covered gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, sex (meaning gender) and sexual orientation among a host of other attributes. The Act outlaws 
discrimination, harassment and victimisation of another person because they belong to a group that the Act protects, are thought to belong to one of those groups or are associated with someone who does.

El Cabrillo

El Cabrillo is a two-story, ten-unit Spanish-style courtyard apartment house located at the southeast corner of Franklin Avenue and Grace Avenue in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. The Spanish Colonial Revival style building was designed by noted architects Arthur and Nina Zwebell and built in 1928 by movie mogul Cecil B. DeMille. It became one of the most fashionable addresses in Hollywood in the late 1920s and 1930s and was more recently used as the home of the main character in the television series "Chuck". It has been designated as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument and listed in the National Register of Historic Places.
Ties to Hollywood film business.
The El Cabrillo apartments have a long association with the movie business. In 2007, the "Hollywood Reporter" described El Cabrillo as a building "steeped in old Hollywood lore," and in 2004, "The New York Times" called the El Cabrillo "a two-story complex that has more fabled than factual stories attached to it, the mark of a true Hollywood star."
The building was built by Cecil B. DeMille in 1928. David Wallace, the author of "Lost Hollywood" (St. Martin's Press, 2001), believes DeMille built El Cabrillo to house New York stage actors whom he brought to Los Angeles when talking pictures arrived. Others claim that DeMille intended it as a gift for his daughter Frances. Whichever version is correct, DeMille was responsible for a building that became one of the most fashionable addresses in Hollywood. The building's notable features include its Spanish-style courtyard and fountain, hand-made tiles, large fireplaces, and high-beamed ceilings. According to "The New York Times", DeMille used set craftsmen to construct "the phantasmagorial sense of architectural detail at El Cabrillo, which includes a central outdoor Moorish fountain, timbered ceilings, Catalina tile work, swashbuckling wrought-iron hardware and scaled-down versions of Citizen Kane-like carved concrete fireplaces in each apartment." David Wallace, who once managed the property, said: "It's like walking into a movie."
Actress Ann Harding leased one of the front apartments in 1928 for $500 per month—a very high rental rate at the time. Other notable residents have included director Lowell Sherman, Perc Westmore, and writer John Willard. Also, the building's Spanish revival courtyard is alleged to have been used as a set in a Rudolph Valentino movie. Located close to DeMille's motion picture studio, El Cabrillo is at the foot of Whitley Heights, where Charles Chaplin and Rudolph Valentino lived in the 1920s.
More recently, transvestite actor Divine lived in the complex in the 1960s, as did Kent Warner, a costumer and noted collector of clothing and props from Hollywood films. After Warner died in 1984, the building's owner cleaned out the basement and inadvertently threw out some of Warner's possessions, including James Dean's boots from "Rebel Without a Cause" and Marlon Brando's leather jacket from "The Wild One".
Architecture.
El Cabrillo was designed by the husband and wife architect team of Arthur and Nina Zwebell. The Zwebells specialized in Spanish or Hollywood mission courtyard architecture. The building was featured in the 1992 book, "Courtyard Housing in Los Angeles", published by Princeton Architectural Press. The book touts the Zwebells as important designers in the courtyard housing movement and describes El Cabrillo as an attempt to duplicate their earlier courtyard work with new materials:"El Cabrillo is not built in wood and stucco, as are virtually all the other Zwebell courts. Instead, a concrete block, nonstandard in size, is used in an apparent attempt to create an adobe block effect. The ten units follow the Zwebell pattern of incorporating two-story living rooms, mezzanines and graceful staircases."
Later years.
In 1932, the building became part of a scandal when it was revealed that Superior Court Judge Guerin's daughter and son-in-law were residing at El Cabrillo apartments rent-free, allegedly as part of an arrangement with the receiver for American Mortgage Company; investigations were made by a grand jury and the bar association, but Judge Guerin denied any knowledge of the arrangement. 
The building was sold in 1940 by Andrew O. Porter to Lillian Blumkin for $50,000. By 1968, the building had been renamed the Patio Gardens. 
As Hollywood deteriorated in the 1970s and 1980s, the neighborhood around El Cabrillo became dangerous. In his book "Lost Hollywood", David Wallace noted: "By the late 1980s, the problem had become so bad that those few residents who remained in once-celebrated buildings like El Cabrillo...would often have to lie on the floor to avoid being hit by bullets flying through their windows."
More recently, as the Hollywood area improved, El Cabrillo was renovated and converted into condominiums under its original name. When the conversion was completed in 2006, units were listed at prices in the $800,000 range.
Use in the television series "Chuck".
In 2007, the building was used as the shooting location for the home of the main character in the pilot of the NBC television series "Chuck". The producers wanted to use "a courtyard apartment location that was reminiscent of old Hollywood/Echo Park," and selected El Cabrillo because it "offered many interesting textures – concrete blocks, wood spindle balconies, private balconies, an impressive interior courtyard turret and a courtyard fountain, and provided an amazing background for our characters to interact ." 
After the series was picked up, the producers concluded it was not feasible to continue shooting on location at El Cabrillo, so the main character's apartment and El Cabrillo's courtyard were recreated, with some design modifications, on a Warner Bros. soundstage.
Historic designation.
The building was designated as a Historic-Cultural Monument (HCM #773) by the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission in 2003. Two years later, in 2005, the building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="18256310" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18256310" title="Horace's Villa">
Horace's Villa

Horace's Villa is a Roman archaeological complex near Licenza, Italy. The identification has been made possible because Horace wrote several poems about the place, and the location of the villa corresponds to the geographical indications in the poetry.
Identification.
It was owing to references to the villa in Horace's writings that humanists attempted to find the site as early as the mid-fifteenth century, but the site in Licenza was not considered as a possible candidate for two hundred years. This changed when an inscription mentioning a temple of the goddess Victory was found in nearby Roccagiovine.
Horace tells in one of his poems (Epistles 1.10) that his villa was next to the sanctuary of the Sabine goddess, Vacuna. Lucas Holstenius (a mid-17th century geographer and a librarian at the Vatican Library) identified the sanctuary with the temple of the goddess Victory mentioned in the inscription, and he showed that the Romans associated the Sabine deity with their goddess Victoria. A confirmation of Holstenius' thesis came in 1757 with the discovery of the massa Mandelana inscription near Cantalupo (Mandela), which helped antiquarians to identify yet another place name mentioned by Horace as being near his Sabine estate.
Description.
The Aniene Valley to the east of Rome is rich with archaeological remains. The Roman villa on the east slope of the Colle Rotondo (980 meters above sea level) in the Lucretili Mountains near the hilltown of Licenza is one of the best preserved and most significant sites. Attributed by most scholars since the 18th century to the Roman poet Horace, this villa dates from the first century B.C. and is located just 30 miles from the center of Rome in a valley near Vicovaro and Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli.
The actual site was identified and a small portion was excavated in the 18th century. Major excavations were undertaken in the early 20th century. Thus far, the main residence of the estate has been identified, covering, in the imperial period, some 40 x 110 meters of built space and gardens. Black and white mosaics (formerly dated to Horace's lifespan, but now known to be from the Flavian dynasty), marble wall revetment and architectonic elements, an elaborate water system, and artistic and utilitarian remains have been found. A selection of the material is on display in the local museum in the town of Licenza.

1975–76 Baltimore Claws season

The 1975-76 American Basketball Association season saw the demise of the Baltimore Claws franchise.
Offseason.
Preseason transactions.
On August 27, 1975 the Memphis Sounds franchise was dismantled and sold to a group of Baltimore businessmen headed by David Cohan. The franchise moved to Baltimore. It was first called the Baltimore Hustlers but the league objected to the name so the team was quickly rechristened as the Baltimore Claws.
On September 19, 1975 the Claws obtained star center Dan Issel from the Kentucky Colonels, the team that won the 1975 ABA Championship.
The Claws also traded guard Rick Mount to the Utah Stars for guards Joe Hamilton and Tim VanBlommesteyn.
The Claws signed Skip Wise, the 6'3" star guard from Clemson University who the prior year became the first freshman ever to be named First Team All-ACC while averaging 18.9 points per game.
Preseason exhibition games.
The Claws played their first game, a preseason exhibition, in Salisbury, Maryland on October 9, 1975 against the Virginia Squires. The Squires won 131-121; attendance was reported at 1,150.
Two days later the Claws lost to the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers 103-82 in Cherry Hill, New Jersey.
On October 17, 1975 the Claws played the Squires again, this time at Knott Arena, Mt. St. Mary's College, Emmitsburg, Maryland. The Squires won 100-88 in front of approximately 500 spectators. http://www.remembertheaba.com/Baltimore-Claws.html
Demise.
The Claws only managed to sign up 300 season ticket holders. The franchise constantly had money problems. On October 16, 1975 ABA Commissioner Dave DeBusschere gave the Claws four days to send $500,000 to the ABA league office as a "performance bond" for team operations. While their players went unpaid, the Claws sent $250,000 of this amount. On October 20, 1975, five days before the start of the 1975-76 regular season, the ABA folded the Baltimore Claws.

Battle of Valtetsi

The Battle of Valtetsi was fought on May 12 (O.S.), 1821 in Valtetsi between the Ottoman army and Greek revolutionaries.
Background.
The Greek War of Independence officially broke out on March 25, 1821. The city of Tripoli in Arcadia, central Peloponnesus, became a prime objective of the Greek revolutionary army.
Only the warlike Maniots were experts in the art of battle. Besides them, klephtes who lived in mountains, as well as the armatoloi, who had for centuries been hired by the local Ottoman authorities initially to guard the mountain passes and later for the general keeping of law and order were able to make a coherent force.
During April 1821, the initially small Greek forces in the area were slowly augmented by men from the nearby villages who declared Kolokotronis as Archistratigos, the man for overall command. 
Immediately, he established armed camps near the villages of Levidi, Piana, Chrysovitsi, Vervena and Valtetsi who were former rebel's dens that now became headquarters for the preparation of the siege of the Ottoman stronghold, taking advantage of the absence of Hursid Pasha (governor of Morea) who was leading an expedition against the apostate Ali Pasha of Janina under the Sublime Porte's special command.
Battle.
On April 24 (O.S.), 1821, the Ottoman forces of Tripolitsa attacked and put to flight the Greeks based in Valtetsi. The Muslims were then reinforced on May 1 (OS) by 4,000 Albanian under Mustafa, the Kehayabey of Hursid Pacha, coming from Argolis.
A couple of weeks later, a combined Turkish and Albanian force of 5,000 men, under the command of Mustafa, was departed to destroy the Greek positions at Valtetsi on May 24, 1821. Its main section, under Rubi bey, was sent directly to assault the Greek camp now defended by 2,300 revolutionaries.
The defensive strategy was to fortify 4 tower houses in the area following the "pyrgospitia" Maniot pattern: Kyriakoulis Mavromichalis as field-commander defended the first tower with 120 men. Ilias Mavromichalis was in charge of the second one with 250 men. Ioannis Mavromichalis with 350 men commanded the third tower and the old septuagenary Mitropetrovas with 80 men stayed in the last one. 
Rubi bey ordered to storm the place, while a small force was to move behind the village itself to cut off the Greeks' expected retreat to the mountain paths. He demanded the rebels to surrender their weapons but, when refused, began his full assault. The Turkish and Albanian forces managed to capture some positions including the water supply but a fierce resistance obliged them to demand for Kehayabey's reinforcements. 
In the mean time, more Greeks, numbering 700 men, under Theodoros Kolokotronis, arrived and attacked the Ottomans on their flanks weakening their operational power. Once again, another contingent under Dimitrios Plapoutas, made a significant entrance in the battle so as to give vital support to the exhausted rebels, balancing the actions.
Against Ottoman expectations, Greeks maintained their positions as the Ottoman cavalry became useless when trying to attack on rocky slopes. All Turkish and Albanian attacks were repelled and finally Rubi bey ordered retreat which turned into a route after the Greeks abandoned their defensive attitude under the fortified positions and violently counterattacked, completely breaking the enemy lines.
According to an old Maniot folk tradition, when watching the "Turkalbanians" in retreat Captain Kyriakoulis is said to have shouted: 
και συ σκυλαρβανίτη; 
τ’ Αργίτικα κορίτσια, 
εδώ το λεν’ Βαλτέτσι». 
"Where are you going you cuckold Bey,
and you Albanian dog ? 
These are neither the villages of Corinth
nor the Argive girls. 
This place is called Trikorfa, 
this place is called Valtetsi." 
The Greeks achieved a decisive victory and captured two cannons and ammunition.
The battle itself lasted for nearly 24 hours. The casualties were also unexpectedly heavy for the Ottoman army: 600 dead compared to the 150 dead rebels.
Aftermath.
The Battle of Valtetsi was the first decisive Greek victory in their struggle for freedom. Its effects were as follows:
Kolokotronis, according to his memoirs, said to his compatriots: "We must render up thanksgivings for this day, which should be kept holy for ever, as the day upon which our Motherland achieved her freedom".

Ranch Road 1

Ranch Road 1 (RR 1) is a Ranch Road located in Gillespie and Blanco counties, in the central region of the U.S. state of Texas. The highway is approximately , and begins at U.S. Route 290 (US 290) in Stonewall, running along the Pedernales River through Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park, the late President Lyndon Johnson's former ranch, and through Lyndon B. Johnson State Park and Historic Site, before terminating at US 290 near Hye. The road, designated in 1963, is the only road in the state that TxDOT has designated as a "Ranch Road". In the earliest days of the state highway system, the route was a part of State Highway 20, and was later part of US 290 before that highway was relocated to the south.
Route description.
Ranch Road 1 begins at US 290 on the west side of Stonewall, as a two-lane, paved road. The highway follows along the south bank of the Pedernales River around the town's north side and intersects RM 1623 on the town's east side. The route continues along the river briefly passing through a narrow southwestern portion of Lyndon B. Johnson National Historic Site before entering Lyndon B Johnson State Park and Historic Site. The route crosses the length of the state park at its northern edge along the riverbank and exits the park before intersecting PR 49, which crosses the river accessing the national historic site. After crossing into Blanco County, the route turns away from the riverbank to the southeast returning to SH 290 west of Hye. Although the road is located in the Texas Hill Country, the road only encounters gentle grades within the channel of the Pedernales River.
Classification.
Ranch Road 1 is classified by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) as a Ranch Road, and is the only highway in the state to be currently categorized as so. The route is not officially part of the state's Farm and Ranch to Market Road System, although it is considered similar to the Farm to Market Road system. RR 1 is signed with a shield similar to a Ranch to Market Road. The highway fits almost perfectly with the Recreational Road classification, but is not considered part of the system.
History.
Ranch Road 1 was designated on December 19, 1963, 27 days after Lyndon Johnson was sworn in as president, from its current western terminus at US 290 near Stonewall to a point west of the county line between Gillespie and Blanco counties. The following year, the road was extended eastward to its present terminus near Hye. The route was originally part of SH 20. In 1935, US 290 was routed over the road, and the SH 20 designation was dropped in the 1939 general redescription of the state highway system. US 290 was rerouted south to its current location sometime between 1941 and 1961.

Multi-Touch Collaboration Wall

The Multi-Touch Collaboration Wall is a large (81 inch width x 48 inch height) monitor invented by Jeff Han that employs multi-touch technology, and is marketed by Han's company,
Perceptive Pixel. Han initially developed the technology for military applications. The wall has received most of its publicity because of its use by news network CNN during its coverage of the 2008 US Presidential election. Usually operated by John King, it is often referred to as CNN's "Magic Wall", though it is now more commonly referred to by on-air personalities as the "Magic Map."
Walls have been sold not only to CNN but to the US Military, as well as other government agencies Han has not named. The wall appeared in a catalog for upscale department store, Neiman Marcus.
Use on CNN.
The screen was purchased by CNN after David Bohrman, who is in charge of CNN's coverage of politics, "fell in love" with the device at a military intelligence show. Its programming is modified by CNN's Josh Braun for specific uses, and CNN recently purchased a second wall.
Its primary use has been during CNN's election coverage. Its first use was during CNN's coverage of the 2008 Democratic and Republican Iowa caucuses in January of that year; CNN has used the wall during its coverage of every successive primary contest in the 2008 primary season. Bohrman originally wanted to delay use of the monitor until the general election, but decided that the technology was "too good to wait". Part of its appeal is its ability to make the numbers and data more accessible to its viewers, and to relay them visually, as many viewers lose interest in merely verbal explanations.
The software allows the user to access, manipulate and project data related to current poll results, and election results of the past and present. For instance, the user could bring up the total delegate counts for Senators Barack Obama (D-IL) and Hillary Clinton (D-NY) during the 2008 US Democratic primary race. He could bring a map of the state that was then having a primary election, collect live vote tallies, or bring up pie charts for vote distribution in each county. He could project how voting in a particular county could affect who won the state. For the national presidential election, it can be used to display a map reflecting recent state-by-state poll results, which are also used to project electoral vote totals for each respective party. Current toss-up states can also be assigned Democratic or Republican status to create hypothetical election scenarios.
Particular attention has been paid to John King's proficiency with the wall, and is described as a "specialist" in using it. He is sometimes referred to as "the map guy," "the wall magician" or the "chairman of the board." Many news stories about the wall dedicate equal focus to King himself.
The "Magic Map" was parodied in the October 23, 2008 episode of "Saturday Night Live Weekend Update Thursday", with Fred Armisen using it to move states around where they don't belong and made Michigan bounce. John King commented later that he could perform that act as well. The "Map" was also parodied on the November 18, 2008 episode of "The Daily Show with Jon Stewart", with a presumably omnipotent King using it to stalk, and eventually imprison, correspondent John Oliver. And a Bud Light "drinkability" commercial spoofs the magic map technology.

Room For Love

Room For Love is a chick lit novel by American author Andrea Meyer. The book was inspired by an article the author wrote for the "New York Post" and brings together two New York City obsessions: love and real estate.
Plot.
Jacquie Stuart has just turned 32 and she wants to do a major rewrite on her life. Her salary at a snarky film magazine barely covers her mortgage, her bratty sister has staked permanent claim to her couch, her best friend is in an obscenely happy marriage, and the only guy who really gets her is gay. Worst of all, she keeps falling for broke, self-involved commitment-phobes. In a moment of brilliance (and financial desperation) Jacquie takes a break from celebrity interviews to pitch a wild idea to an editor at a glossy women’s magazine: What would happen if she answered “Roommate Wanted” ads as a ploy to meet men? She would have intimate access to countless single guys. And as a potential roommate, she could unearth all the insights that usually stay buried on a first date: what books he reads, whether he cleans the bathroom sink, whose picture adorns his nightstand. Why, it’s untapped man market genius! And so it is that Jacquie embarks on a hunt designed to find way more than a place to hang her fabulous wardrobe. After colorful near-misses that bring her into the slums of the East Village, the brownstones of Brooklyn, and the dingier digs of the Upper East Side, Jacquie thinks she's finally found her dream guy and stuns her friends by moving out of her beloved apartment—and into his. Complications ensue that force her to question the shaky foundations of the bed she has made for herself. Jacquie’s been looking for love in other people’s homes all over town, but could the key to her happiness lie under her own roof?

<doc id="18256762" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18256762" title="California Proposition 2 (2008)">
California Proposition 2 (2008)

"For other articles concerning "Proposition 2", see Proposition 2 (disambiguation)"
Proposition 2 was a California ballot proposition in that state's general election on November 4, 2008. It passed with 63% of the votes in favor and 37% against. Submitted to the Secretary of State as the Prevention of Farm Animal Cruelty Act, the initiative's name (as with others such as Proposition 8) was amended to officially be known as the Standards for Confining Farm Animals initiative. The official title of the statute enacted by the proposition is the Prevention of Farm Animal Cruelty Act. 
The proposition adds a chapter to Division 20 of the California Health and Safety Code to prohibit the confinement of certain farm animals in a manner that does not allow them to turn around freely, lie down, stand up, and fully extend their limbs. The measure deals with three types of confinement: veal crates, battery cages, and sow gestation crates.
Having been passed by the voters on November 4, 2008, the key portion of the statute will become operative on January 1, 2015. Farming operations have until that date to implement the new space requirements for their animals, and the statute will prohibit animals in California from being confined in a proscribed manner thereafter.
The California Secretary of State's summary from the Official Voter Information Guide of Proposition 2 is as follows: 
Summary of Legislative Analyst's Estimate of Net State and Local Government Fiscal Impact:
Similar legislation attempted in California and other states.
The Humane Society and other animal protection advocates have been working with the California legislature over the last twenty years to achieve the passage of laws to prohibit cruel treatment of farm animals. They say that the bills for animal protection that they supported have been repeatedly killed in committees where agribusiness has great power.
Health and food safety.
Animals under stress, including the stress of intensive confinement, have compromised immune systems, and thus higher levels of pathogens such as Salmonella in their intestines.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, "Stringent procedures for cleaning and inspecting eggs were implemented in the 1970s and have made salmonellosis caused by external fecal contamination of egg shells extremely rare. However, unlike eggborne salmonellosis of past decades, the current epidemic is due to intact and disinfected grade A eggs. The reason for this is that Salmonella enteritidis silently infects the ovaries of healthy appearing hens and contaminates the eggs before the shells are formed." Supporters of Proposition 2 claim that giving egg-hens more space can prevent this type of outbreak.
Contrarily, previous research suggests that eggs from modern housing systems have superior structural integrity in their shells, allowing for greater resistance to penetration by the Salmonella Enteritidis pathogen and decreasing the risk of egg contamination. On the other hand, the infection of free-range hens in the California study was caused via the "fecal-oral route through contamination of the feed through feces" from rodents that had easy access to these hens. In addition to being more vulnerable to exposure from rodents, free-range hens did not have the same level of manure management as those hens kept in modern housing systems. This is because the hens housed indoors had a manure belt that ran under their enclosures and transported the feces to collection receptacles, common to modern housing systems in California. On the other hand, according to a report by the "Rural Industries Research & Development Corporation", the total number of bacteria on free-range eggs is 15 times greater than that found on eggs from modern housing systems. The Rural Industries report also postulates that the very construction of the indoor housing systems precludes the possibility of poultry and rodents existing closely, thereby potentially decreasing the possibility of cross-infection.
Supporters of Proposition 2 say that increased density of birds in battery cages leads to increased incidence of Salmonella in eggs. They also say that housing battery cages are very difficult to keep clean and are often are infested by large numbers of flies and rats.
However, opponents of Prop 2 say that modern housing effectively separates "feces and other fluids" from eggs, and that Prop 2 would "effectively ban modern housing". The opponents go on to say that "there has not been a reported case of salmonella linked to California eggs in nearly a decade" - but noting that people get salmonella from eggs that are produced outside of California every year [http://www.safecaliforniafood.org/node/29]. Their claim about salmonella cases linked to California eggs is supported by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
An article entitled "The pros and cons of cages" published in the World's Poultry Science Journal in 2001 concludes that cages result in increased hygiene and lower incidence of disease related to feces, but can result in higher rates of metabolic disorders. [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=FF9E2CC0C645A6E7DC9B44A736500C7E.tomcat1?fromPage=online&aid=624576]
A recent undercover investigation of Norco Ranch (a Southern California egg ranch) was completed in August and September 2008. That investigation discovered badly decomposed chicken carcasses in the same cages with hens which were still laying eggs for human consumption. The organization that performed the undercover investigation, Mercy for Animals, released the undercover video to the public whereupon the video and the investigation received wide coverage in the news media. Proponents of Prop 2 imply that close confinement was a major factor in these bird's deaths. However, Prop 2 opponents assert that Norco Ranch was in violation of many California laws already in place.
A 2004 study of California egg farms in the journal "Avian Diseases" finds comparatively low Salmonella prevalence in indoor housing systems, commonly used in California, as compared to cage-free and free-range housing systems. The researchers state that this low Salmonella prevalence in California egg farms reflects the "distinct geographic, climatic, production and management characteristics" of the state's egg farms. 98 percent of egg farms adhere to the California Egg Quality Assurance Plan, which is a pathogen reduction program for Salmonella in California.
The study states, "The highest prevalence in the free-range birds kept on the dirt floors." The California study notes that "feral cats, rodents, skunks, opossums, wild birds, and other wildlife" were seen near the free-range hens’ feeding areas, and that rodents "were considered to be the biological vectors and amplifiers" of salmonella on the egg farm in the study. A 2003 study from the "Journal of Applied Microbiology" and a study published in the journal "Applied and Environmental Microbiology" support the conclusion that wild animals are a significant and dangerous vector for salmonella.
Supporters of Prop 2 note that furnished cages for egg-laying hens have already been developed in Europe, which allow birds to move freely and display natural behaviors. The waste material in these systems is far less concentrated than with battery cages, and the animals are healthier and calmer with a stronger natural immunity to disease.
Opponents of Prop 2 note that a process called "traceback" is conducted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and helps to maintain a safe food supply. The FDA's guidance to its staff for conducting tracebacks has sections entitled "Farm Investigations" and "Egg Processor/Packer Investigations," which contain detailed protocols explaining who goes on the farm, how the investigation is carried out, biosecurity procedures and other important steps to ensure that should an outbreak from eggs occur, the traceback would successfully reveal the original source. These opponents to Prop 2 say that California already has adequate and exemplary disease control techniques.
Bird flu.
According to the United States Animal Health Association, hens housed in cage-free and free-range housing systems have substantially higher risk of exposure to Avian Influenza, Exotic Newcastle Disease, Salmonella, and other diseases from wildlife species of birds, because they have access to the outdoors. However, Dr. Kennedy Shortridge, credited with the discovery of the first bird flu virus in Asia, warns that the outbreak of bird flu in China was a result of that country's conversion from small, backyard poultry farms towards larger, crowded industrialized farms over the last twenty years. He strongly recommends that we "dramatically" change modern farming practices. According to Dr. Shortridge, domesticated poultry on industrial farms are the source of the bird flu virus, not outdoor migratory birds.
Economic effects.
In July 2008 the University of California, Davis conducted a study through their University of California Agricultural Issues Center (AIC). The study concluded that "the best evidence from a variety of sources suggests that (non-organic) non-cage systems incur costs of production that are at least 20 percent higher than the common cage housing systems". This is due to higher feed costs, higher hen laying mortality, higher direct housing costs, and higher labor costs. The study also estimated that almost the entire California egg industry would relocate to other states during the 5-year adjustment period. The study does not analyze implications for animal welfare. By demonstrating that most egg producers would leave the state, the report estimates that the initiative would not affect how eggs are produced, only where eggs are produced.
A study done by Don Bell of the University of California, Riverside estimated that eliminating battery cages for egg-laying hens will result in increased production costs of less than one cent per egg, and a recent economic study co-authored by former California finance director Tim Gage predicted, "Under Prop 2, consumers purchasing conventional eggs will likely see no change in price; consumers preferring California grown eggs could see around a penny per egg increase in cost; while those preferring cage-free eggs will see a drop in cost with a new California provider."
According to a May 2008 study by Promar International and commissioned by opponents to Prop. 2, 95% of the California $648 million egg industry and accompanying economic output would be lost by 2015, including equally significant loss of the three and half thousand jobs the egg industry employs. The study also stated that egg production costs would increase by 76%.
Animal welfare.
Opponents of Proposition 2 claim that California's current regulations ensure sanitary and healthy conditions for egg-laying hens in the care of law-abiding organizations. Proponents of Prop 2 say the best housing environments for farm animals must take into consideration freedom of movement and expression of normal behaviors. The American Veterinary Medical Association supports greater attention to the behavioral needs of farm animals, but has expressed concern that Proposition 2 is not sufficiently comprehensive to ensure that increases in behavioral freedom don't translate into increased risks of injury and disease (i.e., a typical welfare tradeoff). Furthermore, although Proposition 2 offers hens additional space, it doesn't address other behavioral needs such as nesting, foraging, and dust bathing.
A Canadian study completed in 2008 concluded that conventional battery cages could easily be converted into furnished colony cage systems, and asserted that perches increased hen welfare. It went on to say that hens in battery cages did not have significantly higher levels of stress measured by the hormones in blood and fecal matter. The study qualified that finding by stating: "It is possible, however, that these measures may not be sensitive enough to detect the differences in housing conditions. It is also possible that the space allocated to each bird in the conventional cages [i.e., the battery cages in this study may have affected the results as battery cage birds received nearly double the floor space of a commercial bird." The study also concluded that hens in the enriched cages lost feathers because of "wear on furnishings rather than feather pecking."
Egg farmers assert that the egg production methods that the industry has developed are meant to ensure that fundamental components of sound animal care are provided to egg-laying hens: optimal feed, light, air, water, space and sanitation for egg-laying hens. Animal welfare advocates assert that, in order to maximize profits, hens in factory farms are treated like units of production rather than as living beings. The instinctual needs of each hen are denied, and most spend their entire lives indoors in filthy, cramped conditions in immense dark warehouses. Most hens never feel the sun, never walk on grass, and many are never able to turn around without hitting cage bars or another hen.
Approximately 95% of California's egg farmers are part of the UEP certification program, in which, farmers assert, they must place top priority on health, safety, and comfort of their hens and submit to independent United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) audits. Animal welfare advocates, however, assert that UEP certification deceives shoppers by conveying a false message of humane animal care. They say that UEP certification permits routine cruel and inhumane factory farm practices such as intensive confinement in restrictive, barren cages such that the hens cannot perform many of their natural behaviors such as perching, nesting, foraging or even fully stretching their wings.
Assertions by proponents.
Prop 2's supporters say it is a modest measure that ends the cruel and inhumane confinement of specified animals on factory farms, requiring their living spaces to be big enough for them to turn around, lie down, and fully extend their legs and/or wings. The initiative does not require that they be kept outside of cages or live outdoors. Supporters of proposition 2 say that smaller, local, family farms will have an increased competitive edge over larger factory farms. They say that the agribusiness industry maximizes their own profits by compromising on animal welfare and human health.
Assertions by opponents.
Prop 2's opponents say that "Proposition 2 is a risky, dangerous and costly measure banning almost all modern egg production in California." They further claim that Proposition 2 jeopardizes food safety and public health, wipes out Californians’ access to locally grown, fresh eggs, and harms consumers by driving up prices at grocery stores and restaurants and creates a dependency on eggs shipped from other states and Mexico.

Legal actions involving Prop 2 opponents.
The American Egg Board (an egg industry funded promotional group) has been barred by a U.S. District Court Judge from using $3 million allocated to it by the USDA until after the 2008 November election. This ruling came after a lawsuit by supporters of Prop 2 claiming the USDA improperly set aside the $3 million in federal funds into the Egg Board's coffers to oppose Prop 2. The lawsuit asserted that the Egg Board's planned use of the money would be an illegal political use of public funds.
United Egg Producers, the U.S. egg industry's national trade association leading the fight against Prop 2, is currently under a criminal investigation by the United States Justice Department for price-fixing and intentionally driving up the cost of eggs.
Campaign donations.
A total of $10.6 million was donated to the Yes on 2 campaign, and a total of $8.9 million was donated to the No on 2 campaign.
Field Poll Results.
According to a Field Poll released on 7/22/2008, after hearing a description of Prop 2, 63% of likely California voters polled said they would vote "yes", 24% said "no", and 13% were undecided.
Prop 2 opponents disparaged that poll by noting that few respondents (16 per cent) had been aware of the issue. They also claimed that polling was skewed by the measure's original title, The California Prevention of Farm Animal Cruelty Act, which was later changed by the attorney general's office to Standards for Confining Farm Animals. 
However, results of a more recent poll were quite similar to the first. A 9/25/2008 SurveyUSA poll of likely California voters who have either decided or are leaning towards voting a certain way on Prop 2 gave the following results: "72% Yes, 10% No, 17% still not certain. Support for the proposition is strong among all demographic groups and in all regions of the state."
A Field Poll released on 10/31/2008 shows that "there has been very little change in voters' initial support for Prop 2." This latest Field Poll found that 60% of likely California voters polled said they would vote "yes", 27% said "no", and 13% were undecided.
Election results.
More Californians voted for Prop 2 (more than 8 million) than for any other initiative in state history.
The graph on the right shows 12 counties as having a majority that voted NO on Prop 2 (out of California's 58 counties). The graph was created before the final vote totals were certified. In reality, only 11 counties had a majority that voted NO. Sutter County voted YES by a margin of 50.2% to 49.8%.
The 11 counties in which a majority voted NO are agricultural and/or sparsely populated areas. But several significant agricultural counties, like Ventura and Kern Counties, voted YES.
Companion bill, AB 1437.
Proposition 2, itself, does not prohibit out-of-state eggs produced in extreme-confinement conditions from being sold in California. After Proposition 2 passed, California egg farmers were concerned that they would be at a disadvantage when competing against out-of-state egg producers who could underprice them by continuing to practice inhumane treatment of hens. The California egg farmers and animal advocates made common cause to get the legislature to pass a bill to require out-of-state eggs to meet the same requirements that Proposition 2 implemented for in-state eggs. Accordingly, Assemblyman Jared Huffman authored AB 1437 The bill passed the legislature and was signed into law by Governor Schwarzenegger on July 6, 2010.
Proposition 2 and AB 1437 will both take effect on the same day: January 1, 2015. Thus, the combination of the two laws will prohibit eggs produced in extreme-confinement conditions from being sold in California, no matter where they were produced.

Papal election, 1241

The papal election from September 21 to October 25, 1241 elected Cardinal Goffredo da Castiglione as Pope Celestine IV. The election took place during the first of many protracted "sede vacantes" of the Middle Ages, and like many of them was characterized by disputes between popes and the Holy Roman Emperor. Specifically, the election took place during a lull in the war between Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor against the Lombard League and the deceased pontiff, Pope Gregory IX, with Italy divided between pro-Papal and pro-Imperial factions known as the Guelphs and Ghibellines.
During the "sede vacante", Frederick II surrounded Rome with his armies, blocking the arrival of some cardinal electors known to be hostile to his interests. Unable to reach a consensus, the cardinals were locked in the Septizodium by the Roman civic officials, eventually settling on one of their oldest and feeblest members. The conditions within the building are believed to have contributed to the death of one of the "papabile" and even the death of Celestine IV soon after the election. Following Celestine IV's death, the war on the peninsula resumed and the cardinals dispersed for over a year and a half before coming together in Anagni to elect Pope Innocent IV.
The forced sequestration of the cardinals during the election was historically significant, and—along with other papal elections of the 13th century—contributed to the development of the papal conclave.
Context.
The papacy of Pope Gregory IX (1227–1241) and the kingship of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor took place at a time when centuries-old disputes between the popes and emperors were coming to a head. Frederick II had dedicated troops, but not his own leadership, to the failed Fifth Crusade, to the dismay of the church; following his marriage to Yolande of Jerusalem, he took up the Sixth Crusade but later abandoned it and returned to Italy, for a variety of political, economic, and military reasons. This served as a pretext for his excommunication by Gregory IX, and thinly veiled skirmishes between supporters of the pope and emperor (Guelphs and Ghibellines, respectively) throughout the Italian peninsula, particularly in Lombardy. Before his death, Gregory IX had called for a synod to denounce Frederick II, and the emperor had gone to great lengths to disrupt the gathering, including through the kidnapping of prelates and cardinals.
The conclave took place under the threat of the pall of the surrounding army of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor (before he pulled back to Apulia), who had been at odds with Celestine IV, and prevented two cardinals from reaching the election. Frederick II's retreat was meant to show that the Emperor "had made war with Gregory IX, and not with the Church".
The election took place in the Septizodium (the "Sette Sole"), where the cardinals were confined by Senator Matteo Rosso Orsini. The conditions of the election were reported to have been stressful, with the urine of Orsini's guards on the rooftop leaking into the election chamber along with the rain. The actual forced confinement to the Septizodium took place only for the last two weeks of the conclave. It is even alleged that the citizens of Rome, angered by rumors that a non-Cardinal would be elected, threatened to dig up the corpse of Pope Gregory IX and place it in the Septizodium with the cardinals. A different account states that Orsini himself threatened to have the corpse exhumed and displayed publicly in full papal regalia.
Proceedings.
The main factions of cardinals were composed of the Gregorians (Rinaldo Conti de Segni, Sinibaldo Fieschi, and Riccardo Annibaldi, who supported the election of Romano Bonaventura), who wished to continue Gregory IX's hostility towards the Holy Roman Emperor, and the "Moderates of the Opposition" (including Giovanni Colonna, Robert Somercotes, and Rainiero Capocci, who supported Castiglione), who advised submission. Frederick II objected to the election of Bonaventura due to his "persecution" of the University of Paris while legate to France, his alleged debauching of Queen Blanche of Castile, and his role in the dispute between Gregory IX and the emperor.
Unable to reach a two-thirds majority, the cardinals requested that Frederick II release the two cardinals whom he held captive. However, when summoned, Giacomo da Pecorara proceeded to excommunicate the emperor; Oddone di Monferrato was allowed to join the election leaving hostages in his place and promising to return to the emperor's custody unless he himself was elected pope. Frederick II himself urged the cardinals to make a quick choice:
The heat and shortage of food are likely to have contributed to the death of Somercotes, although the other members of the pro-Imperial faction alleged that he had been poisoned. Fieschi's health also deteriorated severely, apparently causing the future pope to inch closer to death. The remainder of the cardinals were not allowed to leave the Septizodium for the funeral, nor were physicians or servants allowed to enter the building (where a sizable amount of excrement had begun to build up). Bonaventura would also die soon after the election.
Castiglione's advanced age and deteriorating health are likely to have contributed both to his initiative status as "papabile" and his ultimate election, making him an ideal compromise candidate, "stop-gap", or "provisional Pope". More critical sources describe Celestine IV as a "feeble, ignorant, old fanatic" who was "destitute of any other qualification". One commentator suggested that the cardinals "escaped by electing a dying man". Still others refer to him as "Orsini's candidate".
Aftermath.
Celestine IV died just 17 days after his election, dying even before he had been enthroned. It is likely that the cause of death was dysentery, contracted in the Septizodium. It is speculated that had Celestine IV lived longer he "would in all likelihood have proven friendly to the emperor".
Many of the cardinals, apparently not wishing to be locked in the Septizodium for another ordeal, fled across central Italy, before there was even time to bury the deceased pontiff. Colonna, however, was seized by the Roman populace and imprisoned due to his Ghibelline leanings. Oddone, as he had vowed, returned to the custody of the emperor.
When confronted by a group of begging friars bearing a message from the Archbishop of York and Bishop of Lincoln, Frederick II reportedly said: "Who is hindering the welfare of the Church? Not I; but the stubborn pride and greediness of Romans. Who can wonder if I withstand the English and Roman Churches, which excommunicate me Oddone had done from England, defame me, and are always pouring forth money to do me wrong?" Soon after the conclave, the hostilities between the Guelphs and Ghibellines resumed around the Italian peninsula, on both land and sea. Although Frederick II was now free to crush the Lombards without a pope to oppose him, he soon diverted much of his cavalry and infantry north of the Alps where the Tartars had begun to seriously threaten his lands.
Thus began the longest "sede vacante" in the history of the Roman Catholic Church since the period between Pope Agatho and Pope Leo II (681-682). It took a year and a half before the cardinals were successful in reconvening in Anagni (Frederick II was in possession of Rome) and electing a successor to Celestine IV (due in no small part to Frederick II's continuing to keep da Pecorara and Oddone as hostages: choosing Cardinal Fieschi as Pope Innocent IV in 1243. Innocent IV breathed new life into the conflict against Frederick II, and after the emperor's death in 1250, excommunicated his son and heir, Conrad IV of Germany. Imperial influence in papal elections persisted until the papal election, 1268–1271, after which the Imperial party (then composed mostly of older cardinals) was all but extinguished within the College of Cardinals.
Accounts.
One contemporary account of mixed reliability is that of British chronicler Matthew Paris (c. 1200-1259), who claims that both his compatriot, Robert Somercotes, and Celestine IV died of poisoning; his works are more prized for their accounts of the Hohenstaufen struggles. Paris was a friend of Somercotes (who presided over the "audientia litterarum contradictarum") in Rome and further claimed that Somercotes would have soon been elected pope himself had he survived. Both of these pieces of speculation have continued in later English literature; e.g. "the Italians were too hard for the honest Englishman, being made away by poison at the Holy Conclave, 1241".
Cardinal electors.
According to different accounts, the College of Cardinals on the death of Gregory IX numbered between 12 and 14 cardinals.
According to Gregorovius and Kington-Oliphant, the cardinal electors numbered only 10. At the time of Gregory IX's death, the cardinal electors who took part in the election were already present in Rome and the two cardinals held prisoner by Frederick II were already captive in Naples. The two cardinals had been apprehended at sea aboard captured Genoese galleys, while traveling not to the election but to a general council that Gregory IX had called to denounce Frederick II for Easter 1241 (also captured by Frederick II were three legates and several archbishops and bishops).
Legacy.
By virtue of the cardinals being locked in, the election is sometimes referred to as the "first conclave" (even the "first formal papal Conclave"), although the formal procedures of the conclave would not be developed until the papal election, 1268–1271, and were first implemented in the papal conclave, January 1276. In fact, the practice of forced seclusion of the cardinal electors can perhaps even be traced back to the papal election, 1216, where the people of Perugia locked in the cardinals after the death of Pope Innocent III.
Both the 1216 and 1241 elections were important milestones in the development of the tradition of the conclave, but to refer to them as "conclaves" "per se" is a touch anachronistic, as they were not referred to as such contemporaneously. However, as Baumgartner notes, "although the procedure of voting in a locked room did not become standard for papal elections for three more decades, it was the first conclave, since the word comes from the phrase "cum clave", 'with a key'."

<doc id="18256873" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18256873" title="Familialism">
Familialism

Familialism is an ideology that promotes the family of the Western tradition as an institution. Familialism views the nuclear family of one father, one mother, and their child or children as the central and primary social unit of human ordering and the principal unit of a functioning society and civilization. Accordingly, this unit is also the basis of a multi-generational extended family, which is embedded in socially as well as genetically inter-related communities, nations, etc., and ultimately in the whole human family past, present and future.
Familialism advocates Western "family values" and usually opposes other social forms and models that are chosen as alternatives (i.e. single-parent, polygamy, LGBT parenting, etc.). A typical trait of familialism is the insistence that "normality" resides in the patriarchal nuclear family.
Familialism is usually considered conservative or reactionary by its critics who argue that it is limited, outmoded and unproductive in modern Western society. As a social construct imposed on non-Western cultures, it has been criticized as being destructive. Its prevalence in psychoanalysis has been criticized, and its antagonistic relationship with LGBT culture has been noted.
Historical and Philosophical background.
Ancient political familialism.
"Family as a model for the state" as an idea in political philosophy originated in the Socratic-Platonic principle of macrocosm/microcosm, which identifies recurrent patterns at larger and smaller scales of the cosmos, including the social world. In particular, monarchists have argued that the state mirrors the patriarchal family, with the subjects obeying the king as children obey their father, which in turn helps to justify monarchical or aristocratic rule.
Plutarch (46-120 CE) records a laconic saying of the Dorians attributed to Lycurgus (8th century BCE). Asked why he did not establish a democracy in Lacedaemon (Sparta), Lycurgus responded, "Begin, friend, and set it up in your family". Plutarch claims that Spartan government resembled the family in its form.
Aristotle (384-322 BCE) argued that the schema of authority and subordination exists in the whole of nature. He gave examples such as man and animal (domestic), man and wife, slaves and children. Further, he claimed that it is found in any animal, as the relationship he believed to exist between soul and body, of "which the former is by nature the ruling and the later subject factor". Aristotle further asserted that "the government of a household is a monarchy since every house is governed by a single ruler". Later, he said that husbands exercise a republican government over their wives and monarchical government over their children, and that they exhibit political office over slaves and royal office over the family in general.
Arius Didymus (1st century CE), cited centuries later by Stobaeus, wrote that "A primary kind of association ("politeia") is the legal union of a man and woman for begetting children and for sharing life". From the collection of households a village is formed and from villages a city, "So just as the household yields for the city the seeds of its formation, thus it yields the constitution ("politeia")". Further, Didymus claims that "Connected with the house is a pattern of monarchy, of aristocracy and of democracy. The relationship of parents to children is monarchic, of husbands to wives aristocratic, of children to one another democratic".
Modern political familialism.
Some modern thinkers, such as Louis de Bonald, have written as if the family were a miniature state. In his analysis of the family relationships of father, mother and child, Bonald related these to the functions of a state: the father is the power, the mother is the minister and the child as subject. As the father is "active and strong" and the child is "passive or weak", the mother is the "median term between the two extremes of this continuous proportion". Like many apologists for political familialism, De Bonald justified his analysis on biblical authority:
Bonald also sees divorce as the first stage of disorder in the state, insisting that the "deconstitution" of the family brings about the deconstitution of state, with The Kyklos not far behind.
Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn also connects family and monarchy:
George Lakoff has more recently claimed that the left-right distinction in politics reflects a different ideals of the family; for right-wing, the ideal is a patriarchal family based upon absolutist morality; for left-wing, the ideal is an unconditionally loving family. As a result, Lakoff argues, both sides find each other's views not only immoral, but incomprehensible, since they appear to violate each sides' deeply held beliefs about personal morality in the sphere of the family.
Criticism.
Criticism in practice.
Familialism has been challenged as historically and sociologically inadequate to describe the complexity of actual family relations. In modern American society in which the male head of the household can no longer be guaranteed a wage suitable to support a family, 1950s-style familialism has criticized as counterproductive to family formation and fertility.
Imposition of Western-style familialism on other cultures has been disruptive to traditional non-nuclear family forms such as matrilineality.
Criticism from the LGBT community.
LGBT communities tend to accept and support the diversity of intimate human associations, partially as a result of their historically ostracized status from nuclear family structures. From its inception in the late 1960s, the gay rights movement has asserted every individual's right to create and define their own relationships and family in the way most conducive to the safety, happiness, and self-actualization of each individual.
For example, the glossary of LGBT terms of Family Pride Canada, a Canadian organization advocating for family equality for LGBT parents, defines familialism as:
Criticism in psychoanalysis.
Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, in their now-classic 1972 book "Anti-Oedipus", argued that psychiatry and psychoanalysis, since their incept, have been affected by an incurable familialism, which is their ordinary bed and board. Psychoanalysis has never escaped from this, having remained captive to an unrepentant familialism.
Michel Foucault wrote that through familialism psychoanalysis completed and perfected what the psychiatry of 19th century insane asylums had set out to do and that it enforced the power structures of bourgeois society and its values: Family-Children (paternal authority), Fault-Punishment (immediate justice), Madness-Disorder (social and moral order). Deleuze and Guattari added that "the familialism inherent in psychoanalysis doesn't so much destroy classical psychiatry as shine forth as the latter's crowning achievement," and that since the 19th century, the study of mental illnesses and madness has remained the prisoner of the familial postulate and its correlates.
Through familialism, and the psychoanalysis based on it, guilt is inscribed upon the family's smallest member, the child, and parental authority is absolved.
According to Deleuze and Guattari, among the psychiatrists only Karl Jaspers and Ronald Laing, have escaped familialism. This was not the case of the culturalist psychoanalysts, which, despite their conflict with orthodox psychoanalysts, had a "stubborn maintenance of a familialist perspective," still speaking "the same language of a familialized social realm."
Criticism in Marxism.
In The Communist Manifesto of 1848 Karl Marx describes how the bourgeois or monogamous two-parent family has as its foundation capital and private gain. Marx also pointed out that this family existed only in its full form among the bourgeoisie or upper classes, and was nearly absent among the exploited proletariat or working class. He felt that the vanishment of capital would also result in the vanishment of the monogamous marriage, and the exploitation of the working class. He explains how family ties among the proletarians are divided by the capitalist system, and their children are used simply as instruments of labour. This is partly due to child labour laws being less strict at the time in Western society. In Marx’s view, the bourgeois husband sees his wife as an instrument of labour, and therefore to be exploited, as instruments of production (or labour) exist under capitalism for this purpose.
Frederick Engels, in The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State, published in 1884, was also extremely critical of the monogamous two parent family and viewed it as one of many institutions for the division of labour in capitalist society. In his chapter “The Monogamous Family”, Engels traces monogamous marriage back to the Greeks, who viewed the practice’s sole aim as making “the man supreme in the family, and to propagate, as the future heirs to his wealth, children indisputably his own”. He felt that the monogamous marriage made explicit the subjugation of one sex by the other throughout history, and that the first division of labour “is that between man and woman for the propagation of children”. Engels views the monogamous two-parent family as a microcosm of society, stating “It is the cellular form of civilized society, in which the nature of the oppositions and contradictions fully active in that society can be already studied”.
Engels pointed out disparities between the legal recognition of a marriage, and the reality of it. A legal marriage is entered into freely by both partners, and the law states both partners must have common ground in rights and duties. There are other factors that the bureaucratic legal system cannot take into account however, since it is “not the law’s business”. These may include differences in the class position of both parties and pressure on them from outside to bear children.
For Engels, the obligation of the husband in the traditional two-parent familial structure is to earn a living and support his family. This gives him a position of supremacy. This role is given without a particular need for special legal titles or privileges. Within the family, he represents the bourgeois, and the wife represents the proletariat. Engels, on the other hand, equates the position of the wife in marriage with one of exploitation and prostitution, as she sells her body “once and for all into slavery”.
More recent criticism from a Marxist Perspective comes from Lisa Healy in her 2009 essay Capitalism and the Transforming Family Unit: A Marxist Analysis. Her essay examines the single-parent family, defining it as one parent, often a woman, living with one or more usually unmarried children. The stigmatization of lone parents is tied to their low rate of participation in the workforce, and a pattern of dependency on welfare. This results in less significant contributions to the capitalist system on their part. This stigmatization is reinforced by the state, such as through insufficient welfare payments. This exposes capitalist interests that are inherent to their society and which favour two-parent families.

Michael Ynoa

Michael Ynoa (born September 24, 1991) is a Dominican pitcher who is commonly known as "Michael Inoa." Ynoa is signed with the Oakland Athletics for the amount of 4.25 million dollars, setting a new record for the A's organization after lefty pitcher Mark Mulder was signed for 3.2 million in 1998. Ynoa was named the "Number One" and the "crown jewel" in the "Best Latino Prospects of 2008. " Ynoa is said to be the most impressive Latin American player prospect since Félix Hernández in 2002.
He is 22 years of age, he is 6 feet 7 inches, and weighs 210 lbs (pounds), and two Major League Baseball teams (Cincinnati Reds, Texas Rangers) "reportedly offered Ynoa about $5 million." It was reported that Ynoa signed with Oakland after a deal fell through with the New York Yankees. The Yankees reportedly broke off talks with Ynoa after agent Adam Katz sought to renegotiate a handshake agreement with the club. 
After pitching nine innings in the Arizona League, Ynoa underwent Tommy John surgery.
Ynoa's contract was selected on November 20, 2012 and was added to the 40-man roster.
Spelling of name.
"Michel Ynoa" is the original spelling of Michael's name. His first name was anglicized to "Michael" after he signed with the Oakland Athletics in July 2008. Although Michael's last name is more commonly spelled with an "I", as of February 2009, he will be using the original spelling "Ynoa." "According to A's director of player development Keith Lieppman, noa will start going by the original spelling of his last name, 'Ynoa.' Somewhere along the line, there was a mixup on the spelling, and the pitcher's name made its way into the public forum with an 'I.'"

Kyriakoulis Mavromichalis (military commander)

Kyriakoulis Mavromichalis ( was a Greek revolutionary who fought in the Greek War of Independence. 
He was born in Limeni in the Mani Peninsula, the son of Pierros Pierrakos with Katerina Koutsogrigorakos and was the baby brother of Petrobey. He died fighting in Splantza in 1822. 
When the Greek War of Independence broke out he organised a band of young Maniots into a fighting force. Kyriakoulis fought at Kalamata, Methoni, Koroni and was present at the Siege of Tripolitsa operation as commander-in-charge of the Valtetsi headquarters in the incipient revolutionary army. 
He successfully defended the camp, twice, in the Battle of Valtetsi, leading a far inferior force to strengthen their positions, allowing new reinforcements to succeed in repelling the Turkish attack. 
With the war against Ali Pasha over, the Souliotes - who had sided with the Albanian against the Ottomans - were in mortal danger because of Hursid Pasha's constant attacks and siege. To deal with this, an inexpert commander Alexandros Mavrokordatos, who was not a soldier but a politician and future statesman, chose Kyriakoulis to command an expedition to bring relief and reinforcements.
On his way to Kiafa, his expeditionary force met action with a Turkish vanguard near the seaside village Mourtos, completely defeating their foes and taking a large number of prisoners. His decision to take his captives to imprisonment in the Peloponnesus rather than to massacre them, as was then common, showed his military ethics, but at the same time weakened his already small regiment composed by 500 Maniots plus some Philhellenes, mostly former Bonapartist French soldiers and young romantic Italian revolutionaries. 
In his effort against a stronger and much more compact force under Omer Vryonis, but with the overall leadership of an excellent skillful commander like Hursid, who was an expert against guerrilla warfare, his band was at last defeated at an engagemnet in Splantza. The Maniots showed the same Thermopylae spirit as their Spartan ancestors fighting up to the last man. Kyriakoulis was killed on July 4, 1822 and was buried with honours in Mesolonghi. 
Maniot tradition and folk songs, show how his younger brother's death strongly hurt the brave Petrobey's soul:
"κι εσφούγγιζε τα μάτια του μ΄ ένα χρυσό μαντήλι." 
"Σα με ρωτάς Κυριάκαινα και θέλεις για να μάθης;" 
"Aπόψε μου ΄ρθαν γράμματα από το Μεσολόγγι" 
"και στάζουνε τα μάτια μου και τρέχουν μαύρα δάκρυα.""
""Petrobey was lying in the highlands of Petrovouni" ("Stone Mountain")
"wiping his eyes with a golden kerchief."
"What's happening to you Bey, that you're so sad and black tears fall from your eyes?"
"Since you're asking Kyriakaina (Kyriakoulis' wife) and you want to know..." 
"Tonight I got news from Mesolonghi ... Kyriakoulis was killed, the main captain."
"This is why my eyes are full with black tears.""
He was the grandfather of Kyriakoulis Petrou Mavromichalis, the politician and later Prime Minister but above all, for the Peloponnesians in general and for the Maniots in particular he became the icon of the sacrifice made in behalf of the freedom of Greece.

The Split of Life

The Split of Life is a series of over 80 mural size oil paintings by Nabil Kanso. The paintings span a period from 1974 to 1994, and deal with contemporary and historical issues of war and violence.
Development and description.
The subject of war in Kanso’s work began during 1972-74 in New York when he did a series of paintings and drawings on the Vietnam War. After a brief pause, he started in 1975 the Lebanon war series evoked by the civil war that broke out in his native land. The intersection of the two series reflecting similarity in composition, scale, style and theme provided the framework for a larger series whose underlying theme formed the basis of "the Split of Life" series in encompassing several other series dealing with war. 
"The Split of Life series" delineates two periods: 1974-85 and 1986-94. The works of the first period are characterized by the use of warm colors dominated by red, orange, yellow and black, and the depiction of compositions in which masses of figures occupy the entire surface plane. Among the series in the period are the Vietnam, Lebanon, One-Minute on (Hiroshima and Nagasaki) and Time Suspended in Space on (South Africa) series. The works of the 1986-94 period depict compositions that divide the canvas in 2 or more sections depicting figures painted in dark blue and black within an enclosure of red and orange surrounded by a white space. Everywhere in the painting there is the dynamics of transformation, rather than static forms of distribution and knowledge.
Analysis and interpretations.
In examining the works in the Split of Life series, some studies point to compositional and thematic aspects in conjunction with a set of distinctive concepts, in particular, the human subject, the Gods, the luminous sky, and the concealing self-concealing earth. 
- The human figures appear as the flesh of humanity, always compelled by the law of regeneration, offering itself willingly to the torments of domination and submission. Human suffering and torment seem to have always existed. They bear the pain and continue to remain in this dreadful state dictated by a delinquent social reality. In the split of Life, they exist in a new and different reality created by the artist imagination on big canvases in which they make their case as condemned beings. Their presence disturbs and troubles us. We find ourselves immersed in their world whose reality becomes our own reality.
- The Gods appear immortal but not eternal; each Holy Family presides only over one epoch in the history of men with the Gods. The powers (beyond Good and Evil) into which “Necessity is analyzed have no history; they crush humanity within the eternal circle of helpless reflection and unconscious desire.”
- The picture surface occludes the sky, the empty space of the horizon that makes possible light, darkness, and their relations, the horizon as a boundary between sky and earth. the composition covers that space and all its cognitive illusions The explosions of wars wreaking destruction and devastation inflamed and obfuscated the blue sky with dark forms erupting from earth burning fires. The violent scenes disturbs the chromatic gamut of chiaroscuro, light and shadow through which the victims emerge from the canvases with a common sigh of an open injury sustained by social reality. The pictorial layout extends to the edges of the canvases as light or dark with no space. Light emanates from the figures and use the, so light, therefore, is ultimately a force Light, space, sky closely relate to forms of redemption through irony, acceptance of mortality, the story of people, light against darkness. 
- The earth absorbs the forces that conceal, and conceal themselves in, everything that comes to light. The earth cannot appear by itself; it needs of painting, of the choice of the painter, even as it consumes them. Kanso explores the terror that surrounds the act of choice of self-choice, of painting. The paintings bring out the earthly nightmares that have concealed the serenity of paradise and peace, and transmit a new calling for an awakening.
In discussing artistic tendencies, it is remarked that Kanso breaks with the pictorial traditions of both the East and the West. He gives us instead the Middle, "the chasm of necessity that yawns at the heart of human contingency and universal contingency." 
The gap in the middle provided the ground for a total redefinition of painting in a style in which Kanso departed from the pictorial conventions of both the East and West. He presents a view of the world and its forms in terms of its multiplicity and interrelatedness. A world in which the political boundaries are not arbitrarily drawn by the superpowers. In the words of Edward Said "The more one is able to leave one’s cultural home the more one is able to judge it, and the whole world as well, with the spiritual detachment and generosity necessary for true vision. The more easily too, does one assess oneself and alien cultures with the same combination of intimacy and distance." 
The question of cultural multiplicity as opposed to cultural dislocation comes into play. Orientalism is a form of cultural dislocation because it imposed a western culture on the “orient” in such a way that what is reflected back by the Orient is not the Oriental culture but instead a colonized culture. Cultural multiplicity on the other hand is maintaining one’s own cultural identity and presenting it with other cultures. It is noted that “Nabil Kanso is the first Middle Eastern artist to surface outside, if not against the framework of colonialism.” He presents a view of the world through the boundary situations of death, love, suffering, and guilt. The organization of these boundary situation, a critic points out,constitutes his poetics, which is "predicated on a profound human kingship with the West and an amazed expectant detachment from it. From this circle he derives his extraordinary power of expression."
Exhibitions.
Between 1983 and 1993, a wide range of paintings from various phases of "The Split of Life" series were exhibited a various art centers in Argentina BrazilMexico, Panama, Korea,Kuwait, Sweden, Switzerland and Venezuela, 
The exhibitions were the subject of articles, essays, poems, conferences, and peace projects. In Venezuela, installations were featured as part of the Second Ibero-American Symposium held in Caracas in 1987, the International Encounter for Peace in Mérida in 1988. 
The paintings displayed in different exhibitions were viewed as reflecting a sense of "over-all-ness, of one painting running into another." It is remarked that the magnitude of the paintings place the viewer in the midst of a violent cage. Their synchrony and diachronic cross a still point in which the show is no longer a total of several pieces, but only one painting. in which standing in the central space surrounded by Kanso’s 12-foot-high paintings is as close as you get to being in the middle of a fire. "The painted holocaust surrounding us," a reviewer wrote "entrapped us in cage of feeling". "In encountering these paintings", a critic remarked, "it would be impossible to escape. The scenes draw the viewer in witnessing the violent events." The horrors appear to burst out of the canvases bringing the viewer face to face with scenes reflecting a continuum of war and violence occurring in our time and space.
1984-85 series.
In 1985, Kanso exhibited a series of seven paintings that covered the walls of the gallery at Nexus Contemporary Art Center reflecting in the opinion of one reviewer “a monumental display of neo-expressionist horrors of war.” "The horrors of war in Lebanon" an art critic wrote "have fueled the fires that burn in these very effective paintings," “In the face of horror,” remarked one critic, “there are only two courses: to circumscribe, create a bar, an absolute demarcation, to be “at one” with the confluence and to refuse to overcome it- or to obsess to the point of no return, to create a canvas the size and shape of the original, a one-to-one mapping of the real upon itself, which uses the body of the artist “in a transitive sense” across it. And that is what is occurring in these paintings.” A reviewer thought of the expressions as “a tapestry of souls, struggling, reaching for one another… painted jazz rhythms of naked spirits climbing an interminable Jacob’s ladder in a metaphorical conflagration which repulses and sucks us all in. 
In examining the series of seven paintings executed in 1984-85, art critics point to a variety of themes, in particular, power, death, and sexuality, and the poetics, which organize the themes within the paintings. The interrelatedness of these themes and the composed symbols associated with them provide a framework that lend crucial meaning to the paintings. Doorways, empty centers, and ladders exist in all these paintings. In critical opinion, they carry with them a message of a change or a shift in the modes of power from a system, which controls through repression and reduction, connected to the law of the sovereign, to a positive system which aims to promote and execute life and whose connection is to the social body.

The group had a somewhat unusual appearance, due to the difference in height between Iwai and Takai. Takai was the taller one of the two, with a height of about 5' 4" (about 162 cm), while Iwai barely reached 4' 11" (about 150 cm), so the height difference was quite remarkable. 
Ushiroyubi Sasaregumi debuted on television on 30 September 1985. Throughout their short-lived career, the group released six singles, three albums, a concert video, and two photo books (in addition to the "Kimengumi" soundtrack albums).

1995 bombing of the French Consulate in Perth, Western Australia

On 17 June 1995, the French Consulate in West Perth, Western Australia was firebombed and destroyed.
It is claimed to be the only act in the History of Western Australia regarded as politically motivated terrorism. It is also the most recent such act on Australian soil, although it is postdated by the 1999 occupation of the Greek Consulate-General in Sydney by supporters of the Kurdistan Workers Party in protest at the arrest of Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan, which is not regarded as a terrorist act; and by the 2004 Australian embassy bombing in Jakarta, Indonesia.
Details.
Around 4:40am Saturday morning, 17 June 1995, neighbours called emergency services to report hearing explosions at the French consulate. The consulate was located in West Perth, in a converted single-storey Federation-style house, about 90 years old with brick walls and a largely timber interior. Fire services responded within four minutes and the fire took one hour to completely extinguish. The building was destroyed, and there were no injuries. The site was investigated by detectives from the arson squad, with damage estimated at A$300,000 by fire services.
Some suspected the firebombing was linked to France's decision to resume nuclear testing on Mururoa Atoll in the Pacific Ocean, announced by President Jacques Chirac on Tuesday that week. Police chief superintendent Fred Zagami said police had taken "pro-active security steps in regard to the French consulate" on Wednesday, and nearly 100 people attended a peaceful demonstration outside the consulate on Friday. Honorary French consul Dr Robert Pearce, a plastic surgeon whose consulting rooms and patient records were housed in the consulate, told the media he believed the fire was a protest against nuclear testing.
"We have to accept that in a democracy Australians have as much right as people in other parts of the world to demonstrate, but they shouldn't demonstrate by damaging or destroying other people's life. And this to me is an attack, a personal attack, as much as an attack on something that represents another sovereign state." - Honorary French consul Robert Pearce, 17 June 1995.
The French embassy in Canberra described the fire as "a series of criminal explosions" and "an unjustifiable criminal act which could have had tragic consequences". Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating said "if it is proved that this action is a violent protest against the resumption of French nuclear testing in the South Pacific, it must be condemned for the extreme form it has taken", and intentional destruction of property was "not part of the Australian way of life and must be rejected on every occasion." Bob McMullan, Australia's Acting Foreign Minister, advised the media to show restraint and discourage "copy-cat incidents". Western Australia's Premier, Richard Court, said the fire was "an act of terrorism which we don't accept in this country".
Later that day, a group named the Pacific Popular Front claimed responsibility for the fire. Sergeant Chris Ferris, the WA Police media liaison officer, said that a male telephoned all newspapers and television stations in Perth and SBS in Sydney and read them a message. SBS reporter Jane Willcox said the caller told them, "The Pacific Popular Front is claiming responsibility for fire-bombing the French embassy . It was an attack on their belligerence." Sergeant Ferris said the police force had not previously heard of the Pacific Popular Front.
Arrests.
On 4 July 1995, 20-year-old Bosco Boscovich and 21-year-old Maya Catts were arrested and charged with causing "damage by fire", after allegedly starting the fire with two Molotov cocktails. Police traced one of the phone calls made to reporters to a house in Victoria Park. Police said the two friends acted alone, unconnected to the anti-nuclear movement, and the Pacific Popular Front did not exist.
Boscovich, a Zimbabwean-born Australian citizen and Curtin University student formerly known as Michael Joseph Keenan, pleaded guilty on 21 July 1995 to arson, and was sentenced on 28 August 1995 to three years jail with eligibility for parole. The fire was started when two Molotov cocktails, made using glass wine bottles, cloth and $1.25 worth of petrol, were thrown through two of the building's windows. Judge Antoinette Kennedy said Boscovich wanted to make the French aware of opposition to their nuclear testing, but he did not expect to cause so much damage, estimated at $256,000.
Catts, an unemployed dual Australian-Israeli citizen, pleaded guilty to wilful and unlawful damage on 3 November 1995. On 1 December 1995, she was sentenced to 12 months, which was doubled on appeal on 20 March 1996 to two years jail.

<doc id="18257569" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18257569" title="Laurinburg Institute">
Laurinburg Institute

Laurinburg Institute is a historic African American preparatory school in Laurinburg, North Carolina. The school was founded in 1904 by Emmanuel Monty and Tinny McDuffie at the request of Booker T. Washington.
The school is particularly noted for its output of highly accomplished alumni as well as a rich basketball tradition, having produced several All-Americans. Its most notable basketball alumni include Sam Jones, NBA Hall of Famer with the Boston Celtics, and Charlie Scott, an All-American at UNC and NBA All-Star.
Despite its storied history, Laurinburg may be caught up in a relatively new effort to rein in so-called “basketball academies,” which are typically new private schools tied to a church or municipal basketball league that try to lure students with big hopes of becoming a star and earning a lucrative NBA contract.
The schools have picked up since 2006 when the NBA implemented new draft eligibility rules that require players to be at least 19 years old and one year removed from high school graduation. Since college experience is not needed, students may attend these institutions, throughout and after high school, to focus more on their basketball skills than academics.
That same year the NCAA began routinely reviewing prep schools for academic irregularities, including reviewing the transcripts of prep school student-athletes seeking to play at NCAA-member institutions. (By virtue of meeting state requirements, public schools do not receive the same scrutiny.) The irregularities found in students’ transcripts at schools sanctioned as “not cleared” include dramatic academic improvement over a short period of time and the taking of sequential courses at the same time. In Laurinburg’s case, the NCAA, after two on-site visits, raised concerns about the curriculum and quality control, among other issues.
McDuffie says he’s tried and failed to learn from the NCAA what precisely is wrong with his school and how he can fix it. “I gave up communicating with them last fall,” he says.
NCAA spokeswoman Jennifer Royer says the NCAA does not disclose to the public the findings of its investigations, and she declined to comment specifically on the Laurinburg Institute, other than to confirm that the institute’s appeal was denied.
Royer says to be cleared Laurinburg must “offer courses that meet minimum NCAA eligibility requirements,” and the association has staff who work with schools to help them meet NCAA requirements. This is the first time Laurinburg has not been cleared, and it is among more than 60 institutions whose courses are discredited by the NCAA.
Such NCAA policies have long been controversial. Joe Nathan, director of the Center for School Change at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minn., says the NCAA has issued sweeping rulings without much transparency or explanation.
“They’re like the great school board in the sky,” says Nathan, who led a movement in the late 1990s to get the NCAA to change its policies claiming that courses offered by private or parochial schools were not college prep-level and not worthy of NCAA sanction. “We’ve documented situations where National Merit scholars were not allowed to play in college because of alleged academic deficiencies.”
The most recent round of NCAA probes has prompted at least one lawsuit. Star forward Michael Glover, for instance, was “not cleared” by the NCAA when in 2007 he left a private prep school found lacking by the NCAA to play at Seton Hall University. He sued, claiming that the NCAA never specified why it deemed his senior year transcript at American Christian Academy in Aston, Pa., unacceptable. His suit was dismissed, and Glover now plays at the College of Eastern Utah.
American Christian Academy was one target of the NCAA in its probe of “basketball academies.” Another institution “not cleared” by the NCAA, Lutheran Christian Academy in Philadelphia, did not have its own school building or formal classrooms but operated from a community center, The Washington Post reported.
Some “basketball academies” are dangerous frauds, says Robert Hughes, an 81-year-old retired coach who compiled a record 1,333 wins in 47 years at I.M. Terrell and Dunbar high schools in Fort Worth, Texas. Hughes says some schools do little to educate players while drawing talent away from more traditional sports programs.
If the children leave the private academies later for mainstream schools, “we have to re-educate them, even on how to play basketball,” says Hughes. “They are taught the ‘me-and-I’ style of play that isn’t team play but let’s them think they are already stars,” he says.

History.
ASFAN has won the Niger League Championship (today's Niger Premier League) only twice: in 1971 and 1975.
The club has reached the Coupe Nationale of Niger final only once: defeating Liberté FC 3-1 on 3 August 1995. From this win they qualified for the 1996 Coupe de l'Union des fédérations de football ouest-africaines (UFOA Cup). Reaching the final on 8 December 1996, ASFAN defeated East End Lions from Freetown, Sierra Leone, making them the only Nigerien football club to have won an international competition.
In 2009 they played in the Niger Premier League. They have entered the top national league every year since 2001, when they were one of fourteen clubs to boycott the championship over the relegation of Zumunta AC. In 2004 the championship was canceled.
Notable former players include Mâazou Ouwo, transferred in January 2008 to Sporting Lokeren in Belgium, who in 2009 moved to CSKA Moscow. ASFAN reportedly received 327 million FCFA for 2008 transfer fees.
In late 2008, they were chosen to compete in the 2009 African Confederation Cup in place of AS Police, who won both the Cup and League in 2008. As no system was previously in place, FENIFOOT chose 2008 League runners up ASFAN over Akokana Arlit, 2008 Cup finalists.

Originally occupying a single house with an adjacent chapel, the community engaged in extensive fundraising to extend the monastic buildings, and engaged with local contractors to construct an ecologically sensitive building. The house and chapel are now joined, and further extensions have provided community work rooms, additional cells, and facilities for caring for elderly members of the community. Amongst other eco-friendly features, the monastery generates its own solar electricity, harvests rainwater through a water management system, and engages in extensive market gardening and sustainable land husbandry.
Spiritual life.
The monks and nuns of the Order lead lives balanced in prayer, work, and recreation. They rise at 3.30am, pray a four-fold daily office, celebrate a daily mass, and engage in individual and community works; their day ends with compline (night prayer) at 7.00pm. Professed sisters and brothers take a four-fold vow; this consists of the customary three-fold monastic vow of poverty, chastity, and obedience, plus a fourth vow of commitment to daily prayer "in the spirit of our Blessed Mother Saint Julian".

Nishmat

Nishmat (נִשְׁמַת or "Nishmat Kol Chai", "The breath of every living thing") is a Jewish prayer that is recited following the Song of the Sea during Pesukei D'Zimrah but before Yishtabach on Shabbat and Yom Tov. It is also recited during the Passover seder in some traditions. The recitation of this prayer is not required by halakha in Judaism, but nevertheless, is prized by halakhic authorities because the concepts covered in this prayer are basic to Halakha.
Nishmat and Yishtabach are in some ways considered to be one long prayer, abridged just to Yishtabach on weekdays when there is no time to recite the entire prayer.
In this prayer, the word "Nishmat" (the combining form of "Nishmah" נִשְׁמָה "breath") that begins the prayer is related to the word "neshama" (נְשָׁמָה "soul"), suggesting that the soul is part of the breath of all life. The theme of the prayer is the uniqueness of God.
Some halakha can be derived from the prayer Nishmat. The commandment "Do not lie idly by the blood of your neighbor" requires a person to rescue another s/he sees is in danger. But from Nishmat, it can be seen that one who is not physically present where the danger is taking place is exempt from performing any rescue action. Some examples of this include the obligation to rescue a person from a burning building in one's own location, but an exemption from the obligation to donate an organ when doing so can save a life (though doing so is still permitted).
Origin.
Nishmat is considered one of the masterpieces of Jewish liturgy. It is seen as a journey of self-discovery, describing God as a source of prayer.
The composition date of this prayer is believed to have be from the Amoraic era or earlier. In the Talmud (Bavli Pesahim 118a), Rabbi Yochanan bar Nafcha (180-279 CE), states that this prayer should be recited during the Passover Seder after Hallel. This has been current practice at least since the Geonic period (c. 800-1000 CE). While this is the earliest known reference to the prayer, there are opinions that it may be older.
Nishmat became a standard part of the liturgy by the time of Saadia Gaon. The earliest mention of it as part of the Sabbath morning service is in Seder Rav Amram written by Rav Amram Gaon in the ninth century CE. In Mishneh Torah, Maimonides (12th century CE) states that it was recited on the Sabbath in Sephardic practice. It's use on Sabbath morning was controversial in Europe during the early medieval period. Several Ashkenazic rabbinic works explicitly defended its use, including Mahzor Vitry and Kol Bo.
The exact author of the prayer is not known. Some scholars have suggested that it was authored by a man named "Yitzchak" (יצחק, Isaac) with a wife named "Rivka" (רבקה, Rebecca) based on the acrostic arrangement of the verses, but others have dismissed this idea.
Some scholars have suggested that the author's name may have been "Shimon" (שמעון, Simon) from an acrostic within the prayer, and have considered this could be Shimon ben Shetach or perhaps even (according to some Messianic Christians ideas) Apostle Peter, whose Hebrew name was Shimon, which would place the date of authorship at around 100 BCE.

Reihan Salam

Reihan Morshed Salam (; born December 29, 1979) is a conservative American political commentator, columnist and author and a senior fellow at the R Street Institute. He is a columnist for Reuters and lead writer of "The Agenda" blog at "National Review", as well as a policy adviser at e21 and a contributing editor at "National Affairs". He has also appeared on a number of radio and television shows, including NPR's "Morning Edition, Talk of the Nation, All Things Considered", "Tell Me More", HBO's "Real Time with Bill Maher", NBC Universal's "The Chris Matthews Show", WNYC's "The Brian Lehrer Show", BBC's "Newsnight", ABC's "This Week", CNN's "Fareed Zakaria GPS", Comedy Central's "The Colbert Report", and American Public Media's "Marketplace". Salam is also a frequent guest on the weekend political talk show "Up with Chris Hayes" on MSNBC and on the CNN show "Erin Burnett OutFront".
Early life.
Salam was born in Brooklyn. His parents are Bangladeshi-born immigrants who arrived in New York in 1976; his father is an
accountant and his mother is a dietician. Salam attended Stuyvesant High School and Cornell University before transferring to Harvard University, where he was a member of the Signet Society. He graduated from Harvard in 2001 with a degree in Social Studies.
Salam's parents worked in the World Trade Center in the 1980s. Salam has written, "Some of my fondest memories of growing up involve visiting them at work, and watching the 4th of July fireworks display from my dad’s office window." Those memories later fed into his personal horror at the September 11th attacks.
Grand New Party.
He co-authored "Grand New Party: How Republicans Can Win the Working Class and Save the American Dream" with Ross Douthat. The book grew from an influential cover story for "The Weekly Standard", which called for a reinvention of Republican domestic policy.
The Republican party, Salam and Douthat argued, had become "out of touch with its own base," and its Bush-era, big-government policies were "an evolutionary dead end." Salam and Douthat instead advocated "tak the 'big-government conservatism' vision" of Bush and giving it "coherence and sustainability" by vigorously serving the interests of the less affluent voters who had become the party's base. The platform would include "an economic policy that places the two-parent family--the institution best capable of providing cultural stability and economic security--at the heart of the GOP agenda."
Political views and style.
Salam is a conservative. He has written that he intends to "pump ideas into the bloodstream of American conservatism."
I write in the hope and expectation that people read people with whom they disagree to challenge their settled views. Suffice it to say, this isn’t generally the case, but I’m happy to continue behaving as though it is, as it is true of enough people to justify the effort. 
He strongly supported the Iraq war but has since called it a disaster of "world-historical proportions." He claims to advocate policies that strengthen traditional family structure and has supported gay marriage. He has described as "brilliant" such figures as Canadian Marxist philosopher Gerald Cohen and Reagan adviser and neoclassical economist Martin Feldstein.
Among other things, Salam has taken a strong interest in congestion pricing and the encouragement of denser living arrangements, the promotion of natural gas and nuclear power, reform of the U.S. tax code, and the fostering of a more competitive and diverse marketplace of educational providers. He also supports illegal drug decriminalization in the U.S.

Rolls-Royce V8 engine

In the history of Rolls-Royce automobiles, only two distinct series of V8 engines have been produced. The first powered the 1905 "V-8" model and was made in very small numbers. The second was developed in the 1950s and was known internally as the "L Series" of engines. The L Series V8, in highly developed form, continues to power Bentley automobiles into the 21st century.
1905 V-8.
Three 1905 Rolls-Royce V-8 automobiles were manufactured using the company’s first V-8 engine design but only one example was sold, a car using the two seat “Legalimit” body. This proved unreliable and was later taken back by the factory and scrapped. The other two were used for factory transport or display purposes. Rolls ordered three more chassis for delivery in 1906 but there is no evidence these were ever made. No example of a 1905 V-8 car or engine is known to survive.
Although the 1905 V-8 cannot be judged a success, lessons learned from the engine were used in subsequent Rolls-Royce engine designs.
L Series V8.
Having used straight six, straight eight and V-12 engines in the interim period, the need for another new engine was recognised in the early 1950s. Development of a totally new V8 engine began in 1952, bearing no relation to the 1905 version apart from its V8 configuration. Rolls-Royce purchased Bentley in 1931 and the new engine was intended for use in both Rolls-Royce and Bentley automobiles. The result was a series of V8 engines known internally as the "L410", the name relating to its bore size of 4.10 inches, in accordance with the company practice.
Despite some attempts at changing the naming convention, the engine has kept both the 4.10 inch bore and the name L410 throughout its life, with the exception of the odd prototype. Developments of the L410 continued in production to power Rolls-Royces and Bentleys until the adoption of BMW V12 power by Rolls-Royce after the BMW purchase of the rights to use the Rolls-Royce brand (for automobiles) in 1998.
The L410 engine is still use by Bentley well into the 21st century, where it remains under continuous development. The Bentley brand and all former Rolls Royce and Bentley automotive manufacturing assets have been owned by Volkswagen AG since 1998.
"For further detail of the L Series V8 engines developed since the 1950s for use in Rolls-Royce (to 1998) and Bentley (ongoing) automobiles, see Rolls-Royce - Bentley L Series V8 engine"
N Series V8.
Around 1987, the requirement for a more modern, downsized V8 engine was identified. Engine designers Derek Jackson and Geoff Attwood performed the majority of work under Les Maddock and Colin Weston, the first result of which was the N80, a 4-valve, double overhead camshaft, 5.0 litre V8. This successfully ran first stage 1000 hours testing straight off the drawing board without incident.
Subsequently, the marketing brief foresaw the requirement for a higher capacity version and the N81, 6.0 litre version, was designed.
The project was stopped around 1991 with further development of the L410 engine that enabled emissions requirements to be met using a pre-catalyst assembly at substantially lower investment.

<doc id="18258176" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18258176" title="Center for Feeling Therapy">
Center for Feeling Therapy

The Center for Feeling Therapy was an abusive psychotherapy group which was referred to as a cult by various sources. It was founded in 1971 in Los Angeles. 
The Center was founded by former members of Arthur Janov's Primal Institute who were dissatisfied with what they felt were shortcomings in primal therapy. The Center started as an offshoot of primal therapy, but quickly abandoned primal therapy and subsequently went through many theoretical shifts, including an emphasis on dream analysis. At its peak it had 350 resident patients and 2,000 members including various branches.
Over time, the Center became cult-like and extremely abusive to its members. The abuse consisted of physical assault, sexual humiliation, verbal assault, financial abuse, excessive demands for ritual, inadequate rest, and enforced physical labor. The enforced physical labor was so severe that some members were permanently injured by it.
After nine years, the members rebelled against the center, leading to its closure in 1980. Some of the former members later sued the founding therapists in what was the largest psychology malpractice suit in California. They were represented by Paul Morantz, who specialized in suing cults.
The Center for Feeling Therapy was discussed in "Therapy Gone Mad" by Carol Lynn Mithers, a book based on interviews of 48 former patients of The Center for Feeling Therapy who shared diaries, notes and audiotapes with her. Another book on the subject is, "Insane Therapy, Portrait of a Psychotherapy Cult" by Marybeth Ayella.
Founding.
The Center for Feeling Therapy was founded in 1971 by two defectors from primal therapy, Joe Hart and Richard "Riggs" Corriere, who had been in the therapist training program at Janov's Primal Institute, along with seven other people, two of whom had been certified as primal therapists. Corriere had contributed to a scientific study reprinted in Janov's second book.
According to Mithers,
According to Mithers description of the founding therapists' initial mind set,
The Center for Feeling Therapy initially followed Janov's method described in "The Primal Scream" by having the patient isolate him or herself for 24 hours prior to the initial three week intensive therapy. Joe and Riggs also extended primal theory using their own ideas.
"Going Sane", the book published a few years later describing their "Feeling Therapy", was given very favorable reviews by some, notably:
Abandonment of primal therapy.
Shortly thereafter, the therapists at the Center for Feeling Therapy had a "major ideological shift... Arthur Janov's theory...of childhood trauma was abandoned." This shift was caused by the realization that patients who had defected with them from Janov's institute "had been "faking" their primals." Indeed, one of the Center for Feeling therapists, Jerry Binder, claimed that "a lot of what had been said was a lie" for his testimonial in Janov's book. As a result, Joe and Riggs came to believe that primals as Janov described them "didn't even exist" and that Janov's cure was "a cruel hoax." Soon after, the Center for Feeling therapists replaced Janov's formulation with their own ideas emphasizing "present-life feelings." Riggs instituted groups in which there would be "no primaling or trips to the past." Soon after, the "break with Janov was triumphantly complete."
But the "biggest change was in the practice of Feeling Therapy itself... started getting wild... Every group, there was something new." Many of the original patients who'd come for Primal Therapy started drifting away: "[They started finding the new program a bit much. They'd come to the Center Feeling Therapy looking...to exorcise the pain of the past. They were "not" looking to have their lives examined...One by one, they began to drift away."
Development of ideas.
Over time, the Center for Feeling Therapy went through numerous drastic changes in its basic ideas. The Center started with primal therapy as its main therapeutic approach, then abandoned primal therapy in favor of an emphasis on "present-life" feelings, then abandoned that in favor of other ideas. These drastic shifts of theoretical approach were common throughout the life of the Center.
After abandoning primal therapy, the therapists developed a dream hypothesis, which formed the basis of their second book, "The Dream Makers." According to the dream hypothesis, one of the major goals of therapy was to have lucid, clear dreams which were devoid of fictitious elements and which could guide a person through his life. It was claimed that the senior therapists all had such dreams, and that the patients could learn to have them too. To that end, the patients were given exercises to improve their dreams; they were also given charts, graphs, workbooks, and so on, to track the progress of their dreams.
Thereafter, the therapists abandoned the dream hypothesis and replaced it with yet another concept, called "Psychological Fitness." The concept of Psychological Fitness was claimed to help the patients succeed in life and make a lot of money. The patients were encouraged to wear very expensive clothing, to appear professional, to start business ventures, and to work very long hours. The patients were told that they would "teach the world to excel."
Organization of the Center.
The Center for Feeling Therapy was a commune, in which the patients lived together in a group of buildings.
The therapy was organized as a hierarchy of groups, with the highest group ("Group One") having the most successful patients, as determined by the senior therapists, and the lowest group ("Tombstone Group") having the least successful patients. Patients could be promoted to higher groups, or demoted to lower ones, based on how thoroughly they had carried out the assignments or commands given to them by their therapists.
Life at the Center.
Life at the center was rigorous and abusive.
Patients were often belittled, demeaned, insulted, or humiliated. Patients were frequently called names, such as "weak," "crazy," "fat," "loser," and so on. Patients were often subjected to insults from the entire group, since the therapists often required the other patients to gather together and collectively insult anyone whom the therapist deemed to be out of favor.
Patients were given frequent therapy assignments by their therapists which they had to complete, or they would risk being abused and demoted to lower groups. The assignments often involved activities which were demeaning or absurd. For example, one woman who was judged to be overweight was assigned to act like a cow and to make "grazing" motions on the carpet.
Patients were often physically assaulted by their therapists. The assault was part of a practice called "sluggo" in which the therapists would break the patients' defenses by hitting them. Patients were often struck repeatedly during therapy sessions, which sometimes led to bruising and bleeding.
Patients had their lives controlled by their therapists in the minutest detail. The patients were told what to wear, what to do, which job to hold, whom to have sex with and how often, whom to date, whom to marry, whether to have children or not, how much they could weigh (for women), and, most importantly, whether or not they could leave. Almost all patients who expressed a desire to leave were informed by their therapists that they were still far too disordered mentally to succeed in the outside world. 
For some patients, life at the Center involved very long hours of grueling physical labor for very little pay. The physical labor was so severe, that some of the patients endured permanent physical damage from the excessive labor coupled with inadequate rest.
After the ideals of "Psychological Fitness" came to the fore, patients were not only abused, but often subjected to monetary fines for lack of performance, or for insufficient work.
In a nine-year span, none of the 350 resident members had a single child even though most of the women were young. Women who did get pregnant were told to get abortions. One woman who got pregnant in her 40s was told she "was not ready" to be a parent, and was pressured to get an abortion with the promise that she had time to get pregnant again.
Patients at the Center were isolated from the outside world and were expected to socialize and work only with other Center patients.
Rebellion and closure.
After nine years, the patients rebelled and the center in Los Angeles (along with its satellites in Boston, Honolulu, Munich and San Francisco) was shut down in November 1980 and the therapists were subsequently (1986–1987) banned from practicing in California as a result of lawsuits initiated about five years earlier by the patients against the therapists, accusing them of rape and other forms of mistreatment. The victims and some observers of the case were shocked and dismayed that criminal charges were not brought against the therapists, and the victims never received the apology they had hoped for from the founders. A lawsuit involving as many as 55 former patients that charged the Center with fraud, brainwashing, and physical and emotional abuse was settled on favorable terms in January 1986.

Mike Renzi

Mike Renzi (born Michael E. Renzi on April 28, 1946) is an American pianist, arranger, and musical director. He is best known for his collaborations with some of the legends of pop-jazz singing, notably Peggy Lee, Lena Horne, Mel Tormé, Cleo Laine, Blossom Dearie, and Jack Jones. In 2010, Stephen Holden of the "New York Times" noted Renzi's "gorgeous long-lined runs" and his "extraordinary grace as a pianistic arranger whose accompaniments have a panoramic orchestral sweep." Renzi is also a seven-time Daytime Emmy-winning composer of soundtrack music for such TV shows as "Sesame Street" and "All My Children".
Early years.
Born in Providence, Rhode Island, Renzi began studying classical piano at the age of eight. In his early teens he taught himself accordion and played in his uncle's band at weddings and other local functions; he also took private classes with Julius Chaloff, the renowned Boston-born classical pianist. He played his first jazz piano job in a band with Art Pelosi, a tenor saxophonist and club owner based in Providence. In 1962, at the age of sixteen, Renzi became pianist for the house trio at Kings & Queens, a jazz club in North Providence. Through 1967, Renzi accompanied a long line of renowned artists there, including Coleman Hawkins, Roy Eldridge, Buck Clayton, Ernestine Anderson, Etta Jones, and the married vocal duo of Jackie Paris and Anne Marie Moss. His 1963 engagement with tenor saxophonist Ben Webster – which Renzi played in his junior year of high school – was recorded privately and later released as a bootleg album.
In a 2010 interview, Renzi recalled having no particular musical goals at the time: "I was so young I didn't even think about it." But while backing the singer Carol Sloane at Kings & Queens, he realized he had a flair for accompaniment. "She was calling tunes and I thought to myself, I can really do this. This is easy. The keys don't bother me, I can make instant arrangements. And I knew I could play some jazz."
Renzi went on to study piano at the Boston Conservatory and composition at the Berklee College of Music. Meanwhile he led the resident trio at Allary's, a jazz club in downtown Providence; Renzi held that position from 1968 through 1976.
In 1972 he had become the musical director of "The Sonya Hamlin Show", an afternoon talk show on Boston's WBZ-TV. One of Hamlin's frequent guests was the jazz and cabaret singer Sylvia Syms. That year, when Syms co-hosted a week of Hamlin's shows, the notoriously demanding vocalist was so impressed by Renzi's playing and knowledge of songs that she invited him to accompany her in a concert at New York's Town Hall. Broadway composer Cy Coleman came backstage and urged Renzi to move to New York, offering help and connections. In September 1976, Renzi relocated to Manhattan.
Move to New York.
Once there, he found a job playing piano at the Carnegie Tavern, a bar-restaurant that featured jazz. For the rest of the ‘70s Renzi commuted between New York and the New England area. He continued his work with Hamlin on her show "Sunday Open House", while accompanying Syms at the Copley Plaza Hotel's Merry-Go-Round Bar and other clubs. In 1979 he played on the soundtrack of the Woody Allen film "Manhattan"; he also made his Carnegie Hall debut when he accompanied singer Jackie Cain (of the pop-jazz duo Jackie & Roy) in a Kool Jazz Festival gala concert in tribute to Hoagy Carmichael. Renzi was hired by Mel Tormé, whom he accompanied at a Carnegie Hall concert and in an engagement at Marty's, a New York supper club. The Marty's shows yielded a double LP, "Mel Tormé and Friends: Recorded at Marty's", New York. In 1981, he became pianist in the orchestra that accompanied Lena Horne in her one-woman Broadway concert, "". Renzi would accompany Horne off and on until her last public appearance in 2000. 
His work with Tormé and Horne helped cement his reputation as "a constantly in-demand accompanist for discriminating singers," as John S. Wilson of the "New York Times" called him. During "The Lady and Her Music", Renzi began a collaboration with Maureen McGovern; he also continued his work with Sylvia Syms, who hired him as musical director for "This Time the Ladies", a tribute to female songwriters and singers, presented in the 1982 Kool Jazz Festival. Renzi returned to Broadway in 1983 as the pianist and conductor of "Peg", Peggy Lee's one-woman autobiographical show, which closed within a week. Renzi continued to work with Lee, appearing with her in Japan, on a televised 1984 concert in Atlantic City ("The Quintessential Peggy Lee"), at the Valley Forge Music Fair, and in five engagements at The Ballroom, a New York City cabaret. Their partnership yielded three albums, and lasted until June 23, 1995, when Lee made her penultimate concert appearance, at Carnegie Hall. When a still-obscure Diana Krall heard Renzi's recording with Lee of the song "Remind Me," she called him and asked if he would coach her; over a period of several months he instructed her on harmony.
All through the ‘80s and ‘90s, Renzi accompanied and conducted for a staggering array of singers; frequently he teamed with bassist Jay Leonhart and drummer Grady Tate. He served as musical director for the actress and cabaret singer Dixie Carter in six of her engagements at New York's Café Carlyle; Renzi also accompanied Carter in her segment of "In Performance at the White House: Cabaret", telecast in 1994 on PBS. He performed on several other occasions at the White House, including a performance of Carter's cabaret act for the Clintons and another by Peggy Lee in the presence of President François Mitterrand of France. 
Renzi rejoined Mel Tormé in 1995 and continued working with him until the singer's last recording session, for the Concord Jazz label in 1996. (Tormé suffered a stroke before that album project, a tribute to Ella Fitzgerald, was completed; his final tracks with Renzi remain unissued.) Renzi has served as musical director for several gala tribute shows at Carnegie Hall, including salutes to Frank Sinatra (1995), Ella Fitzgerald (1996), Marilyn and Alan Bergman (1997), Nat King Cole (1997), Alan Jay Lerner (2000), and Peggy Lee (2003). He performed the same role in an 80th-birthday tribute to Lena Horne at New York's Avery Fisher Hall (1997).
Solo piano work.
Renzi has made relatively few appearances as a jazz instrumentalist. In 1986, he played on a 1986 album by saxophonist Gerry Mulligan, "Soft Lights and Sweet Music". A 1987 concert at Brown University in Providence was issued by Stash Records as the LP "The Mike Renzi Quartet". In 1988, Renzi played at the 80th-birthday Carnegie Hall concert of jazz violinist Stephane Grappelli. In 1992 he led his own trio at the Chestnut Room of the Tavern on the Green in New York.
Television and film.
Renzi has worked as a session pianist on the soundtracks of numerous films, including "Broadway Danny Rose", "Everybody Says I Love You", "Biloxi Blues", "Gremlins", and "The Bird Cage". In 1986 he became musical director for the TV soap opera "As the World Turns"; in 1990 he switched to another soap opera, "Loving". In 1997 he began a long stint as a musical director for "All My Children"; he also appeared on camera in the role of a nightclub pianist. His work on "All My Children" earned him three Daytime Emmy Awards (and two additional nominations) for Outstanding Achievement in Musical Direction and Composition for a Drama Series. He did session work for "Ryan's Hope", also on ABC.
Also in 1997, he began a highly successful twelve-year stint as musical director for the "Sesame Street" TV series and for a number of "Sesame Street" specials. As composer of most of the music and pianist on all the soundtrack recording sessions, Renzi won four Daytime Emmys and was nominated for seven more (as well as one Primetime Emmy for the special "".
Recent work.
Since leaving "Sesame Street" in 2009, Renzi has resumed accompanying on a steadier basis; singers with whom he has collaborated include Jack Jones, Liza Minnelli, Mary Wilson, Jane Harvey, Brian Stokes Mitchell, Regis Philbin, Shawnn Monteiro, Judy Carmichael and Nicolas King. He has continued his long-standing work as arranger for the Palm Beach Pops.

Kannagi no Tori

Overview.
Kannagi no Tori is a typical BL visual novel in which the player's actions govern specific plotlines and endings. One of the qualities in this game that makes it unique is that you can play the main character of the game as either seme or uke. It also contains a unique ending for every one of its characters, both bad and good. To reach specific endings for some characters, another character's ending must be reached beforehand.
Introduction.
There is a place called "Kanagiyama" (Rough God's Mountain) and in there, there are people called "Kannaginotori". Their job is to separate the soul from the body and take them to the dead's world. But one day, a Kannaginotori called Ikaru was summoned by the "Jouan no Kan".
"After one month, on June 1; collect the soul of this boy that will die. His name is Ryū Watanuki."
A Kannagitori who cannot collect souls has no meaning to live. If he cannot, he will disappear from the world.
Refusing an order is impossible.
Ikaru, who went down to the human world, met a boy named Watanuki Ryuu.
Ryuu, a boy who avoids human; and his kind uncle..
And the story begins...

Around 1873, he on the Leon County Commission.
Raney served on the Democratic Executive Committee in 1876, a time the democratic Party was seeking to regain control of Florida from the Republican Party and reverse the effects of Reconstruction. He was inatrumental in the legal maneuvering behind George F. Drew's successful effort to become Governor and the discommodation of the Republican Party. Governor Drew rewarded his efforts by appointing him State Attorney General. 
As Florida Attorney General, he was the counsel for the State's internal improve ment fund. The fund was embroiled in lawsuits concerning land grants to the railroads and canal builders, defaulted bonds, and failed ventures. The State of Florida was bankrupt. Raney was one of the state's negotiators involved in the 1881 sale of of public land to real estate magnate Hamilton Disston to relieve the debt. Raney left office when William D.

<doc id="18258554" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18258554" title="Fisheries observer">
Fisheries observer

A fisheries observer is an independent specialist who serves on board commercial fishing vessels, or in fish processing plants and other platforms, and is employed by a fisheries observer program, either directly by a government agency or by a third party contractor. Observers spend anywhere from 1 day to 3 months out at sea before returning to be “debriefed”. A debriefing consists of reviewing any unusual occurrences or observations, violations observed, and any safety problems or other hardships they endured during the trip. These data are then integrated into the regional agency’s database used to monitor fish quotas.
Observers are usually the only independent data collection source for some types of at-sea information, such as bycatch, catch composition, and gear configuration data. Independent data collection in this context refers to data that is not potentially biased by the fishermen. Creel surveys, trip reports, and other data obtained directly from fishermen can have some dependent bias associated with it. Fisheries-dependent information is critical for the responsible management and conservation of living marine resources, and many worldwide marine resource management regimes utilize fisheries observers for the collection of this data.
The integrity of a fisheries observer program is a function of the conduct, morale, and performance of its employees. Moreover, the stature and stability of a program has direct bearing on the quality of its data products and on the level of confidence that scientists, managers, and policy makers are able to ascribe to the use of this data.
Fisheries observer program.
Hiring Requirements.
A fisheries observer program is responsible for providing the training and support necessary for deploying observers on board fishing vessels in order to collect the fisheries-dependent information essential to achieving the management objectives of the programme. Generally, fisheries observers are required to have an educational background in the biological sciences and a proven ability to handle life at sea. Specific programs have additional or less requirements. Also required is an independent attitude, an ability to get along with people in tight quarters and strong personal integrity. "Hang Loose" and "Stand By" are the general mottos for observers because conditions, boats and circumstances often change at the last minute.
Objectives.
Fisheries observer programmes vary according to the management objective. The three main objectives are
The International Fisheries Observer and Monitoring Conference develops, promotes and enhances effective fishery monitoring programs to ensure sustainable resource management throughout the world’s oceans. Their mission is to improve fishery monitoring and observing programs worldwide through sharing practices and development of data collection and analysis. Since many observing entities are contracted, this conference allows dialog between agencies and between those that rely upon the data collected by observers.
http://www.apo-observers.org/programs gives a list of observer programs around the world.
NOAA National Observer Program (United States).
Mission.
The mission of the National Observer Program is to provide a support system for observers ensuring that they are fully supported. The policies must reflect the diverse needs of regional observer programs while enhancing data quality and achieving consistency in key areas of national importance. Observers are fully assisted by the National Observer Program. All gear is provided to observers for safety and sampling. Travel mileage, hotels, and expenses are paid while traveling to and from docks. Observers are also supported by extremely strict repercussions against any fisherman impeding or endangering them at the docks or while at sea.
Data Usage.
Scientific data are the foundation of fisheries management. To manage fisheries, data are needed not only for species targeted by a fishery, but for all species in the ecosystem. Observers are the only source of independent data collection for some types of at-sea information. Bycatch, catch composition, and gear configuration cannot be seen otherwise. This data are used to support the National Marine Fisheries Service in their effort for conservation and management activities. These include: Bycatch Reduction, Stock Assessment, Protected Species, Gear Research, and Fisheries Regulations.
Fisheries inspection programmes, conducted by officials with enforcement powers are not to be considered observer programmes. Though observers may be tasked to register compliance with fisheries regulations, observers do not have enforcement powers and are not to be considered enforcement agents.
In the United States, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration oversees the Domestic Observer program.

Big Bamboo Lounge

The Big Bamboo Lounge was a bar in Kissimmee, Florida known as a popular after work hangout for players, coaches, and fans of the Houston Astros during spring training in nearby Osceola County Stadium and year round for employees of the Walt Disney World Resort. It was located at 4849 W. Irlo Bronson Highway, Kissimmee, FL 34746. It was known simply as "The Boo" by regulars. The front of the bar was decorated with a World War II era ambulance and spotting tower which were maintained by customer and employee volunteers.
The bar opened in 1977 when Bruce Muir, a former World War II fighter pilot, bought the former home of a doctor and modeled the bar after those he had experienced in the South Pacific. The walls were decorated with Disney employee name tags and business cards from visitors. In keeping with the theme of the South Pacific of the 30's bartenders wore Hawaiian shirts and featured swing music. The Big Bamboo was closed in 2004 due to hurricane damage. In December 2005, a fire destroyed the building, believed by officials to be started by vagrants trying to keep warm. The bar remains closed.
In 2003, Astro's broadcaster Larry Dierker was so enamored with the bar that he built a replica at the Astros Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas.

1994–95 Manchester United F.C. season

The 1994–95 season was Manchester United's third season in the Premier League, and their 20th consecutive season in the top division of English football. It was their first season since 1988–89 to end without a major trophy.
United acquired David May from Blackburn Rovers early on in the season. They then bought Andy Cole from Newcastle United in January for a British record fee of £7 million (£6 million cash with £1 million-rated Keith Gillespie in part-exchange). That month, Eric Cantona was involved in an incident away to Crystal Palace. As a result of racial abuse received from a fan, Cantona broke free of kitman Norman Davies' grasp as he was escorting him from the pitch after being sent off, and launched a kung-fu style kick at the fan. Cantona was banned from football for eight months and fined £20,000 by his club and a further £10,000 by the Football Association.
United lost the Premier League title on the last day when, despite Blackburn Rovers losing to Liverpool, United could only manage a draw away to West Ham United. The misery continued when Manchester United went on to lose to Everton in the 1995 FA Cup Final.
After the season was over, United controversially sold Paul Ince to Internazionale and Mark Hughes to Chelsea, while Andrei Kanchelskis was placed on the transfer list, eventually agreeing a deal with Everton (which was delayed by contract wrangling). Meanwhile, Eric Cantona was strongly linked with a £4 million move to join Paul Ince at Internazionale.

Events of the season.
Pre season.
United's only major signing of the close season was David May, the 24-year-old Blackburn Rovers defender signed for a fee of £1.4million with a view to becoming an eventual successor to the ageing Steve Bruce in the centre of defence, as well as being capable of playing at right-back. Alex Ferguson also added to the reserve ranks with a £100,000 move to 18-year-old Bradford City striker Graeme Tomlinson.
"Captain Marvel" Bryan Robson had left at the end of the 1993–94 season after 13 years at United to become player-manager of Middlesbrough. Clayton Blackmore, another of United's longest-serving players, also called time on more than a decade at Old Trafford, having missed the whole 1993–94 season through injuries, to join Robson on Teesside.
Goalkeeper Les Sealey was given a free transfer, having kept goal for United in two 18-month spells since December 1989, as was fellow veteran Mike Phelan, who had given five years of service in midfield. Just after the start of the season, defender Neil Whitworth and striker Colin McKee also headed out of the Old Trafford exit door, signing for Kilmarnock in the Scottish Premier Division.
August.
United's season began on 14 August 1994 at Wembley Stadium, where they took on Blackburn Rovers in the FA Charity Shield. They won 2–0 with a penalty from Eric Cantona and another goal from Paul Ince. Their league campaign began six days later at Old Trafford, where they took on Queen's Park Rangers and triumphed 2–0. A 1–1 draw at newly promoted Nottingham Forest followed, before a 1–0 win at Tottenham Hotspur and finally a 3–0 home win over Wimbledon, which saw United end the month in second place after four games with only Newcastle United ahead of them.
September.
September saw United's league challenge continue, and they also began their challenges in the League Cup and the Champions League. On 24 September they fell to their first defeat of the season, falling to a shock 3–2 defeat at a struggling Ipswich Town side. On the scoresheet for United in that game was 19-year-old striker Paul Scholes, who had found the net twice three days earlier on his competitive debut in the League Cup second round first leg at Vale Park, where they beat Port Vale 2–1. Their Champions League quest started on a high note as they beat IFK Gothenburg of Sweden 4–2 at Old Trafford in their first group game, though they were held to a goalless draw in Istanbul by Galatasaray (who had knocked them out in the second knockout round the previous season) in the next European clash.
October.
October was another mixed month for United, who began with a 1–0 home win over a crumbling Everton side, before being beaten 1–0 at Sheffield Wednesday in their next game. They then achieved a 1–0 home win over West Ham United, followed four days later by a 2–2 home draw with Spanish giants FC Barcelona in the third Champions League group match at Old Trafford. They then travelled to Ewood Park for a league clash with fellow title chasers Blackburn Rovers, winning the game 4–2 with two goals from influential winger Andrei Kanchelskis, to move ahead of Kenny Dalglish's side in the title race, but still leaving themselves seven points behind leaders Newcastle United and five points adrift of second placed Nottingham Forest.
They were then eliminated from the League Cup by a 2–0 third round defeat at Newcastle United, but gained their revenge on the Tynesiders in the league three days later with a 2–0 win at Old Trafford, meaning that they had cut Newcastle's lead further by the end of the month.
November.
November brought more erratic performances for United. The month began with a 4–0 demolition at Barcelona in the Champions League. They did bounce back in the league four days later with a 2–1 win at Aston Villa just days before the dismissal of former United manager Ron Atkinson as the Villa manager. Then came a superb 5–0 home win over Manchester City in the Manchester derby at Old Trafford, in which Andrei Kanchelskis scored a hat-trick, to cut Newcastle's lead of the Premier League to a mere two points. They also achieved a 3–0 home win over struggling Crystal Palace in the next game, which was overshadowed by a back injury to goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel, ruling him out of action for the next 10 league games, during which his place between the sticks was taken by Gary Walsh with the young Kevin Pilkington on standby.
United suffered perhaps their most humiliating defeat of the whole season on 23 November, when they travelled to Gothenburg for the fifth of their sixth Champions League games and came away on the receiving end of a 3–1 defeat, in which Paul Ince was sent off. The result left them needing a miracle to reach the quarter finals; progression only being possible if Gothenburg managed to beat Barcelona in their final group game as well as United beating Galatasaray at Old Trafford in theirs.
The month ended in a goalless draw with Arsenal at Highbury, in which Mark Hughes was sent off and Paul Ince was stretchered off after injuring his ankle blocking a shot from Arsenal's John Jensen.
December.
A 4–0 home win over Galatasary, with first goals for United from young midfielders David Beckham and Simon Davies, was not enough to prevent them from bowing out of the Champions League at the group stage, but at least it freed them up to concentrate on their domestic season.
December brought some more strong performances from United on the league scene, as they defeated Norwich City, Queen's Park Rangers and Chelsea. However, they suffered their first home defeat in nine months on 17 December when they lost 2–1 at home to Nottingham Forest – when a victory would have sent them to the top of the table. They blew another chance to go top on 28 December when they were held to a 1–1 draw at home by second-from-bottom Leicester City. They finished the year with a 2–2 draw at Southampton, in which 19-year-old midfielder Nicky Butt scored his first senior goal.
January.
1995 began with a 2–0 home win over Coventry City, followed six days later by the beginning of their FA Cup quest, which began at Bramall Lane where they beat Sheffield United 2–0 in the third round and Nicky Butt found himself on the scoresheet again. 
After a failed bid to sign Nottingham Forest's Stan Collymore, United broke the national transfer record on 10 January 1995 in a £7million deal to sign 23-year-old striker Andy Cole from Newcastle United. Cole, who was the Premier League's top scorer in 1993–94 with 34 goals and had already managed a further nine in 1994–95, cost United £6million in cash, with £1million-rated winger Keith Gillespie moving in the opposite direction. Five days later, the two sides met at St James' Park in the league, but neither player turned out for their new side in the game which ended in a 1–1 draw. United had gone ahead with an early goal from Mark Hughes, who suffered a knee injury in the process and was ruled out until the following month, before Newcastle equalised with a goal from Paul Kitson – the man taking Cole's place in the Newcastle attack.
On 22 January, United hosted Blackburn Rovers – still top of the table – at Old Trafford in the league. An Eric Cantona goal won them the game 1–0 to cut Blackburn's lead to two points.
25 January 1995 saw one of the most controversial events in the history of Manchester United football club. In the 48th minute of a 1–1 league draw with struggling Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park, Eric Cantona was sent off for kicking out at Palace defender Richard Shaw, and then faced verbal abuse from the Palace fans. He reacted to the taunts of one Palace fan, 21-year-old Matthew Simmons, by launching a kung-fu kick at him and trading blows with his hands. Within 48 hours, the club had fined Cantona £20,000 and suspended him from the first team for the rest of the season. The Football Association soon extended the ban to eight months (up to and including 30 September 1995) and fined him a further £10,000. Cantona later admitted common assault at Croydon Magistrates Court and received a 14-day prison sentence, though he was bailed pending an appeal against it. On appeal, this was reduced to a 120-hour community service order.
Three days after the Cantona incident, United kept their FA Cup quest going with a 5–2 home win over Wrexham in the fourth round.
February.
Andy Cole's first United goal came on 4 February 1995, the only goal in a 1–0 home win over Aston Villa in the league. At this stage, United were two points behind Blackburn, and the title race was now looking like a two-horse race with United nine points ahead of third placed Newcastle United. Their opponents, who had so very nearly beaten them to the league title two seasons earlier, were now 14th. The second Manchester derby of the season, at Maine Road, was United's next game, which they won comfortably by a 3–0 scoreline to take a brief lead at the top of the table. Then they defeated Leeds United 5–1 in the FA Cup fifth round, before winning 2–0 at Carrow Road against a Norwich City side who had chased them for the title two seasons earlier but were now sinking down the league table after early promise for the second season in a row. However, the month ended on a sour note with a 1–0 defeat at Everton – United's first since their 2–1 defeat at home to Nottingham Forest before Christmas. A landslide victory in that game would have put United top on goal difference.
March.
4 March 1995 saw United set two notable new records in the Premier League. Their 9–0 home win over Ipswich Town was the biggest victory margin and saw them score the highest number of goals in any game in the league's three-season history. Andy Cole's five goals were the most scored by any player in a Premier League game. The result meant that United were still three points behind leaders Blackburn, but had a greater goal difference. They did briefly regain the lead of the league three days later with a Steve Bruce goal giving them a 1–0 win at Wimbledon, There was more success in their next game as they beat Queen's Park Rangers (player-managed by former United midfielder Ray Wilkins) 2–0 in the FA Cup quarter final at Old Trafford. Then came a goalless draw at home to Tottenham Hotspur in the league – the first time United had failed to score at Old Trafford in the league all season. Their title hopes were hit by an even bigger blow four days later when they were beaten 2–0 by Liverpool at Anfield – their first defeat to Liverpool for three years. They were now six points behind leaders Blackburn. The next game saw United keep their title hopes alive with a comfortable 3–0 home win over Arsenal.
April.
April began with more disappointment for the Reds, who were held to a goalless draw at home by Leeds United. With six games left to play, they were now five points behind leaders Blackburn, who had a game in hand.
United's opponents in the FA Cup semi final were Crystal Palace, who held them to a 2–2 draw in extra time at Villa Park. With bad blood between fans of the two clubs still boiling over the Cantona incident more than two months earlier, a more serious cloud hung over the replay (also at Villa Park) as a Palace fan had been killed in fighting between fans of the two clubs outside a Walsall public house just before the game. During the first half, Roy Keane suffered ankle injury due to a rash tackle by Palace's Darren Pitcher, and resisted Ferguson's offer to substitute him at half time, when he needed stitches. Just into the second half, Keane's injury was aggravated by another Palace tackle, this time from Gareth Southgate. He reacted by stamping on Southgate and earned himself a red card. Keane was then attacked by Palace's Darren Patterson, who was also sent off. It seemed likely that Keane would miss the rest of the season and the FA Cup final (which United reached by winning the semi final replay 2–0) but ultimately he was back in action for the final, having already served his three-match ban for bringing the game into disrepute.
After the drama of the FA Cup semi final, United resumed league action and travelled to Filbert Street where they took on an already relegated Leicester side who had held them to a 1–1 draw at Old Trafford less than four months earlier. They won this game 4–0 to remain in contention for the title, though they were still six points behind Blackburn with five games remaining. However, they were held to a 0–0 draw at Old Trafford by Chelsea two days later, though due to Blackburn losing their game they were now just five points behind the leaders. But time was running out, with both sides just having four games to go.
May.
After a two-week break, United returned to action on 1 May, when they faced Coventry City at Highfield Road. The midlanders were now managed by former United manager Ron Atkinson. They won 3–2 to ensure that the home side's survival remained far from certain, but more importantly they ensured that their challenge for the title remained very much alive. Blackburn had slipped up in their last two games, meaning that United had cut their lead to five points – and had a game in hand. In the next game six days later, David May scored the only goal of a 1–0 home win over Sheffield Wednesday to cut United's deficit behind his old club to two points with two games to go. This meant that a victory over Southampton at Old Trafford on 10 May would keep United in the title race right up to the very last game. United went down 1–0 in the fifth minute as the Saints scored through Simon Charlton, only for Andy Cole to equalise in the 21st minute. However, United were still being held to a 1–1 score well into the second half, and the championship celebrations were just minutes away from beginning in Blackburn. Then came an 80th minute goal by Denis Irwin which won the game 2–1 for United and kept their title bid alive. The last game of the season, on 14 May, saw United travel to Upton Park for a clash with a West Ham United side who had just secured their safety. Blackburn, in contrast, had to travel to Anfield for a clash with Kenny Dalglish's old club Liverpool; their game undoubtedly appeared much harder on paper as Liverpool had finished fourth in the league and won the League Cup. However, the Hammers shocked United by going ahead in the 31st minute through Michael Hughes. Brian McClair did equalise in the 52nd minute, and as the game wore on United fought against the clock to score a winner, but West Ham remained resillient and after two late blunders by Andy Cole, the game ended 1–1 and United lost the title, which went to Blackburn in spite of their 2–1 defeat at Liverpool.
The FA Cup final on 20 May 1995 saw United beaten 1–0 by Everton at Wembley, with Paul Rideout scoring the only goal of the game, to leave them without a major trophy for the first time in six years.

Cathedral of the Holy Trinity (Quebec)

The Cathedral of the Holy Trinity () is the cathedral of the Diocese of Quebec, and home to two parishes: the Parish of Quebec and la Paroisse de Tous les Saints. The Diocese of Quebec was founded in 1793 and its first bishop, Dr. Jacob Mountain, gave his early attention to the erection of a cathedral. The completed building was consecrated on August 28, 1804. It was the first Anglican cathedral to be built outside of the British Isles.
Designed in the neoclassic Palladian style, the Cathedral was modeled after the St Martin-in-the-Fields Church in Trafalgar Square, London, and the Marylebone Chapel (now known as St. Peter, Vere St.). King George III paid for the construction of the Cathedral and provided a folio Bible, communion silverware and large prayer books to be used for worship.
The bell-tower is home to 8 bells, founded by Whitechapel in 1830, and are the oldest change-ringing peal in Canada. Due to deterioration, they were brought down in 2006, sent to Whitechapel in London for retuning, and reinstalled in April 2007.

Trevor Jacob Martin was born on June 12, 2009 to Amanda Martin and Jake Martin. His mother and stepfather told everyone that the baby "Jacob" had died as a way to keep him away from David Hayward, believed to be his biological father at the time. 
"Jacob" was then illegally adopted by Liza Colby, who passed the baby boy off as her own biological son, whom she named Stuart. 
Liza Colby and Amanda's husband Jake Martin came up with a plan to make everyone in Pine Valley believe that Stuart is her biological son - she doesn't know that Stuart is another child, not the son of Amanda and David. Amanda names him Trevor after her late father. To keep their son safe, Trevor was hidden with Taylor Thompson, who pretended that Trevor is her niece Tracy. 
Amanda and Jake hatched a plan to adopt the baby as their own. Opal and her granddaughter Kathy discovered the baby, and Opal helped Jake, Amanda, Tad and Taylor "discover" the baby abandoned at the church so Jake and Amanda can "adopt" him. Opal didn't show up and he was discovered and taken by Randi Hubbard. 
David learned that his son was alive and wanted to put Amanda and Jake in jail, but then decided to blackmail Amanda into moving in with him and their child. Amanda and the baby move in together with David. David doesn't want Amanda's husband to have anything to do with "their" child. 
David finds out he is not Trevor's father on November 30, 2009, and he doesn't tell Jake because he wants Amanda and Trevor to himself. To cover up the secret, he tells Amanda that he is dying from a rare blood disease. He manages to gain Amanda's sympathy.
Trevor and his mother move in with his father, Jake, on December 23, 2009. On January 13, 2010, Trevor is tested for the same blood disease as David when Amanda finds information that indicates the disease is hereditary. Luckily, the results are negative. Amanda begins to question Trevor's paternity, and has a test run to determine if David or JR Chandler is the father. She later confides to Jake that she thinks he might be Trevor's father. The paternity test comes in and Trevor is proven to be Jake's son, not David's.

Digital Interface for Video and Audio

The Digital Interface for Video and Audio (DIVA or DiiVA) was a proposal for a bi-directional audio/video interface for transmitting both compressed and uncompressed digital streams. 
It was developed by Synerchip Company, Limited, based in Guangzhou and Sunnyvale, California.
DIVA supports a downstream data rate (from source to display) of 13.5 Gbit/s which is capable of deep color at resolutions higher than 1080p. 
DIVA also supports a 2.25 Gbit/s bi-directional communication data channel that can carry multiple sub-channels (audio, control, compressed video, etc.). This gives DIVA a raw bi-directional data rate of 18 Gbit/s or a usable bi-directional data rate of 14.4 Gbit/s (because of 8b/10b encoding). DIVA was demonstrated at the China Digital Living Forum & Showcase 2008 using a single CAT6A cable. The DIVA Promoters Group was formed by Changhong, Haier, Hisense, Konka, Panda, Skyworth, SVA, TCL Corporation and Synerchip. 
In February 2008, the DIVA Promoters Group hoped to finish the specs for DIVA by the end of 2008 and have DIVA chips released in 2009 or 2010.

GNSS road pricing

GNSS road pricing or GNSS tolling is the charging of road users using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) sensors inside vehicles. Advocates argue that road pricing using GNSS permits a number of policies such as tolling by distance on urban roads and can be used for many other applications in parking, insurance and vehicle emissions. Critics argue that GNSS could lead to an invasion of people’s privacy.
History.
Even though GNSS and electronic toll collection have been around for decades, the idea of using satellites for road tolling is quite recent. The first successful demonstration of GNSS Road Pricing systems was given in 1994 during the ETC field trials on the A555 motorway between Bonn and Cologne (Germany). In 1998, the European Union published a report which proposed the use of GNSS to charge vehicles by distance. Germany introduced the first the GNSS road pricing system for truck tolling in 2005. In 2007, the Netherlands legislated the implementation of GNSS road pricing by 2011, and nationwide by 2016. However the project was declared controversial and subsequently put on indefinite hold due to the Dutch government collapse on February 20, 2010.
How it works.
Although the architecture of individual systems may vary, all GNSS road pricing systems share key common elements in how they work. In a typical road pricing system, in-vehicle sensors record time and position data. The vehicle data is processed into trip data, which is then matched to a set pricing scheme to produce a bill. Most systems process trip data at a back office, though some systems are designed with all the processing taking place inside the vehicle itself.
Applications.
Congestion pricing.
Some cities that have already implemented congestion pricing are looking at ways to expand and improve their systems. Proponents of GNSS road pricing claim it can be used to charge vehicles for how much they travel within a cordoned area as opposed to a flat entry fee, thus avoiding "sharp pricing edges."
Time distance place (TDP) road pricing.
GNSS road pricing enables road pricing policies based on time, distance and place (TDP). TDP road pricing is very much based on the road pricing principles outlined by William Vickrey. In such a system, vehicles are charged based on when, where, and how much they drive. Some transportation experts see TDP road pricing as a fairer, more effective means of charging road users and managing travel demand.

Luis Alandy

Adrian Louis Alandy (born February 7, 1980 in Manila, Philippines), better known as Luis Alandy is a Filipino actor and model. Alandy started his career as a model. He first appeared in a print magazine and was soon discovered to do acting. He landed his first acting role in the popular TV series "Pangako sa 'yo" (2000) as David.
Biography.
Alandy completed an intensive course in computer at AMA Computer College-East Rizal (Philippines). He then studied psychology at San Sebastian College, but dropped out in his third year to try his luck in show business. "I love the hardships of acting," Luis said when asked what attracted him to becoming an actor.
Luis Alandy started out as a GMA7 Talent but when he realized that his career wasn’t going anywhere, he left his home network and transferred to ABS-CBN. This proved to be a good move on his part because he has since then appeared in several soap operas and started to become a household name and a recognizable matinee idol.
As with most stars, his star shone less brightly with the advent of reality TV searches for new artists. He became less visible in showbiz and that led him to venture into showing a bit more skin. His initial salvo was in theater. He, together with other male sexy stars, appeared in the controversial stage musical. All About Men where he bared his body for the audience.
After this exposure, he has become less self-conscious and more daring, for instance showing more skin in a pictorial, playing gay roles on screen, etc. This guy has surely progressed from the wholesome matinee idol to a hunky sex symbol. I’m sure Luis Alandy has a lot more to offer. Let’s just wait and see what he’s going to do next.
He has appeared in several TV series in the Philippines, including "Sana'y wala ng wakas" (2003), "Vietnam Rose" (2005) and "Gulong ng palad" (2005) to name a few. He has recently starred in a number of box-office movies like Pacquiao: The Movie (2006) and Barcelona (2006).
Alandy buffed up his body for Bench underwear fashion shows, and for the musical revue "Penis Talks" (2004). He's also a member of the all-male macho group Barako Boys. 
He confessed that in his eight years in show- business, he experienced being at the bottom of the wheel. He remembered contemplating if he will land TV or movie projects because of competition becoming stiffer with the emergence of newer actors.
He was a member of the all-male macho group Barako Boys (with the award-winning actor Jay Manalo, Christian Vasquez, Carlo Maceda, Reggie Curley, and Paolo Paraiso). The group has released a musical album.
He had switched from ABS-CBN to GMA Network. He appeared in his two primetime shows of GMA. Dyesebel is considered as Alandy's biggest break.
After Dyesebel, Alandy starred in primetime show Luna Mystika. After Luna mystika, he starred in the action thriller Sine Novela: Ngayon At Kailanman where he plays the most villainous role ever.

Morawanocetus

Morawanocetus is a genus of extinct primitive baleen whale from the family Aetiocetidae that existed during the Chattian epoch of the late Oligocene period.
Its fossils have been found in the North Pacific.
"Morawanocetus" was named by Barnes et al. in 1995, who described the species, "M. yabukii". Three new species, dating from 17 to 19 million years ago, were unearthed between 2000 and 2005 in a road-widening project in California. These three new specimens of "Morawanocetus", a genus thought to have gone extinct some five million years earlier, were discovered next to a fourth specimen, still under preparation, which clearly has archaeocete dentition.
"Morawanocetus" was divergent, with wide crania, elaborate cheek, tooth crowns, and short necks. The first fossils of "Morawanocetus" were found in the Chattian-aged Morawan Formation of Upper Oligocene Hokkaido. The more recent findings are the first "Morawanocetus" fossils found in California, a genus more commonly known to Japan.
"Morawanocetus" is a sister taxa to: "Aetiocetus", "Ashorocetus", "Chonecetus", and "Willungacetus".

<doc id="18259331" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18259331" title="Merkle's Boner">
Merkle's Boner

Merkle's Boner refers to the notorious baserunning mistake committed by rookie Fred Merkle of the New York Giants in a game against the Chicago Cubs in 1908. Merkle's failure to advance to second base on what should have been a game-winning hit led instead to a forceout at second and a tied game. The Cubs later won the makeup game, which proved decisive as they beat the Giants by one game to win the National League pennant in 1908. It has been described as "the most controversial game in baseball history."
Situation.
The NL pennant race of 1908 was a three-team fight among the teams that dominated the league in the first decade of the modern era: the Pittsburgh Pirates (pennant winners in 1901, 1902 and 1903), the Giants (winners in 1904 and 1905), and the Cubs (winners in 1906 and 1907). The teams were clustered close together in the standings all year, with Pittsburgh never more than 2.5 games up or 5 back, the Giants never more than 4.5 up or 6.5 back, and the Cubs never more than 4 games up or 6 games back. When play began on September 23, 1908, the Cubs and Giants were tied for first place (although the Giants had six more games to play, with an 87–50 record as opposed to the Cubs' 90–53), and the Pirates were 1.5 games back with an 88–54 record.
Merkle was 19 years old in 1908, the youngest player in the National League. He played in only 38 games all year, 11 of which were at first base as the backup for regular Giants first baseman Fred Tenney. On the morning of September 23, Tenney woke up with a case of lumbago, and Giants manager John McGraw penciled Merkle in at first base. It was the first big-league game Merkle had ever started.
Game.
Future Hall-of-Famer Christy Mathewson started for the Giants; Jack Pfiester started for the Cubs. As was customary at the time, the game had only two umpires: Bob Emslie on the basepaths and Hank O'Day behind the plate.
The Giants were the home team. Mathewson and Pfiester both pitched shutouts through four innings. In the fifth, Cubs shortstop Joe Tinker hit the ball into the outfield, and when right fielder Mike Donlin could not stop it from going past him deep into the cavernous outfield of the Polo Grounds, Tinker circled the bases for an inside-the-park home run that gave Chicago a 1–0 lead. It was the first homer hit off of Mathewson since a homer by Tinker on July 17. The Giants tied the score in the sixth when Buck Herzog singled, advanced to second on an error, advanced to third on a sacrifice by Roger Bresnahan and scored on a single by Donlin. The game was still tied 1–1 when the Giants came to bat in the bottom of the ninth.
Boner.
Pfiester remained on the mound for Chicago. Cy Seymour led off with a groundout to second. Art Devlin singled, putting the winning run on first base with one out. Moose McCormick grounded sharply to second, but Devlin's aggressive slide prevented a double play and allowed McCormick to reach first base safely on a fielder's choice. With two outs and McCormick on first, Fred Merkle came up to bat. Merkle, who only had 47 plate appearances in the entire 1908 season, singled down the right-field line. McCormick, the potential winning run, advanced to third base.
Shortstop Al Bridwell came up to bat next with two outs and runners on the corners. Bridwell swung at the first pitch from Pfiester, a fastball, and drilled an apparent single into center field. McCormick ran home from third, and the game appeared to be over, a 2–1 Giants victory. Giants fans poured out of the stands and mobbed the field; fans sitting behind home plate customarily crossed the field to exit the ballpark via the outfield in this era. Merkle, advancing from first base, saw the fans swarming onto the playing field. He turned back to the dugout without ever touching second. Official rule 4.09 states that "A run is not scored if the runner advances to home base during a play in which the third out is made ... by any runner being forced out". However, in 1908, it was the usual practice of defensive teams to not appeal to an umpire for enforcement of this force-out rule on walkoff hits.
Cubs second baseman Johnny Evers saw an opportunity to have the rule enforced. He shouted to center fielder Solly Hofman, who, amid the chaos caused by thousands of celebrating Giants fans, retrieved the ball and threw it to Evers. According to one account, Joe McGinnity, a Giants pitcher who was coaching first base that day, intercepted the ball and threw it away into the crowd of fans. Evers retrieved the ball—or found a different ball—and touched second base. Umpires Emslie and O'Day hurriedly consulted and O'Day, who saw the play from home plate, ruled that Merkle had not touched second base, and on that basis Emslie ruled him out on a force and O'Day ruled that the run did not score.
The play was immediately controversial. Newspapers told different stories of who had gotten the ball to Evers and how. Christy Mathewson, however, who was coaching first base for the Giants, acknowledged in an affidavit that Merkle never made it to second. One newspaper claimed that Cub players physically restrained Merkle from advancing to second. Retelling the story in 1944, Evers insisted that after McGinnity (who was not playing in the game) had thrown the ball away, Cubs pitcher Rube Kroh (who also was not in the game) retrieved it from a fan and threw it to shortstop Tinker, who threw it to Evers. (By rule, after a fan or a player who was not in the game touched the ball, it should have been ruled dead.) A contemporary account from the "Chicago Tribune" supports this version. However, eight years prior to that, Evers claimed to have gotten the ball directly from Hofman. Five years after the play, Merkle admitted that he had left the field without touching second, but only after umpire Emslie assured them that they had won the game. In 1914 O'Day said that Evers' tag was irrelevant: he had called the third out after McGinnity interfered with the throw from center field. Future Hall of Fame umpire Bill Klem said Merkle's Boner was "the rottenest decision in the history of baseball"; Klem believed that the force rule was meant to apply to infield hits, not balls hit to the outfield.
Replayed game.
Unable to quickly clear the field of fans, O'Day ruled the game over on account of darkness. The game ended a 1–1 tie. National League president Harry Pulliam upheld the ruling. On October 2, Pulliam rejected the Giants' appeal of O'Day's ruling and the Cubs' call for a forfeit victory and again upheld the umpires, declaring the force play on Merkle valid and the game a tie. The Cubs-Giants-Pirates pennant race continued to the final days. The Giants were forced to end the season by playing ten games in seven days due to rainouts. After Merkle's boner, the Giants won 10 of their last 15 games to finish 98–55. The Cubs won eight of their last ten after the Merkle game to also finish 98–55. The Pirates, who beat the Dodgers 2–1 on September 23 to gain a half-game on their rivals, won nine of their last ten to force a makeup game with the Cubs on October 4. The Cubs beat the Pirates 5–2, leaving themselves tied with the Giants, and with the Pirates a half-game back of both teams at 98–56, they were thus eliminated.
On October 6 the National League Board of Directors agreed with its umpires and with Hank Pulliam, making a final ruling that Merkle had failed to touch second base and that the force rule was correctly applied. This left the Cubs and Giants tied at 98–55 and required a makeup game in order to decide the National League pennant. In order to decide the pennant (and a spot in the World Series), the teams had to replay the tie game on October 8. Mathewson, scheduled to start the game, said "I'm not fit to pitch today. I'm dog tired." The crowd was estimated at 40,000, the biggest in baseball history at that time. Pfiester pitched for the Cubs again in the rematch, but was removed from the game in the first inning after hitting Tenney, walking Herzog (who was promptly picked off), giving up an RBI double to Donlin, and walking Seymour. Future Hall of Famer Mordecai "Three Finger" Brown entered the game in relief and got out of the jam with only one run allowed. In the Cubs half of the third inning, Tinker led off with a triple and scored on a single by Johnny Kling. Evers walked, Frank Schulte followed with an RBI double, and Frank Chance followed with a two-run double. From there Chicago cruised to a 4–2 victory, becoming champions of the National League for the third straight year.
Aftermath.
The Cubs went on to win the 1908 World Series, beating the Detroit Tigers four games to one. Over a century later, it remains the last championship in franchise history. The Pirates won the 1909 World Series, also against Cobb's Tigers. The Giants then returned to the World Series for three straight years, 1911–1913, only to lose each year—to the first of Connie Mack's two Philadelphia Athletics dynasties in and , and to the Boston Red Sox in . John McGraw's club would not win another championship until , when they defeated the emerging New York Yankees, featuring Babe Ruth, two consecutive years in the Yankees' first World Series appearances.
The "New York Times" game story for September 23, 1908 blamed the loss on "censurable stupidity on the part of player Merkle". For the rest of his life he would live with the nickname of "Bonehead". Merkle replaced Tenney as the full-time Giants first baseman in 1910 and was a regular for the Giants, Dodgers and Cubs for another ten years. He played in five World Series, all for the losing team. Bitter over the events of the Merkle's Boner game, Merkle avoided baseball after his playing career finally ended in 1926. When he finally appeared at a Giants old-timers' game in 1950, he got a loud ovation from the fans.
Merkle's Bar & Grill, a popular Wrigleyville bar just one block south of Wrigley Field in Chicago, is named after Fred Merkle, and features his image prominently in the bar's logo and interior. The bar's website recounts the story of Merkle's infamous baserunning gaffe, and its e-mail list is titled "The Bonehead".
On July 1, 2013, a minor-league game between the Lansing Lugnuts and Great Lakes Loons featured a very similar play, in which an apparent game-winning single for the Lugnuts was nullified when the runner at first joined the celebration instead of advancing to second. The Lugnuts lost in extra innings.

El Legado (DarkSun album)

El Legado (en: "The Legacy") is the debut album by power metal band DarkSun, released in 2004. In the middle of 2003, DarkSun went to Germany to record what would become their debut album. It was recorded in the VPS Studios, produced by Ingo Cjavkoski (better known as Rage's producer), and mixed at House of Music Studios by Achim Köhler (mixer who had worked for bands like Primal Fear and Sinner).
"El Legado" was released in July 2004, receiving very good reviews, and stating that "El Legado", was "one of the best Spanish metal albums of the year [...] from an excellent band". DarkSun toured Spain for a whole year to support the album, and had "tickets-sold-out" posters in most the venues. The critics and live-reviews about this new band were incredibly good. In the middle of the tour, drummer Daniel Cabal left the band. The rest of the members had to cancel some concerts before introducing Cabal's replacement, drummer Rafael Yugueros who was at that time known for his work on power metal band Darna, on their first and second album and left after the band's breakup on 2004. When the tour ended DarkSun entered the studios once again to record their new album.

Governor's School of Texas

The Governor's School of Texas, formerly the Texas Honors Leadership Program (THLP), is a summer program for academically talented high school students from Texas, who have completed their sophomore or junior years. The program is a member of the National Conference of Governor's Schools. 100 students are selected each year and scholars, who are nominated by their senior counselors, are invited to serve as junior counselors for the following year. Held at Lamar University in Beaumont, Texas, the School is an intensive three-week residential program. The program’s curriculum is designed to develop skills in creativity, problem-solving, leadership, negotiation and conflict resolution, higher-level thinking, research and study skills and ethical decision-making. As an incentive to foster creativity, the program includes no grades or academic credit.
After classes conclude each afternoon, scholars participate in artistic and athletic activities, including drama, dance, instrumental ensemble, tennis, cross country, strength training, basketball, football, volleyball and cricket.
History.
The Texas Education Agency (TEA) established the Office of Gifted and Talented Education in 1976 and developed the first state plan for Gifted Education in 1981 and funded the Texas Governor's Honors Program. From 1986 until 1988, the program was held at the University of Texas at Austin, and in 1989, the program was not held. The Texas Commissioner of Education Dr. Tom Kirby asked Dr. Sisk at Lamar University to plan and develop a Governor’s Honors Program, and from 1990–1999 the Texas Governor’s Honors Program was held at Lamar. Funding from the Texas Education Agency was withdrawn for 2000–2002; however, Lamar University decided to continue the program by seeking funding from private foundations and individual donors to support the program; and the program was renamed the Texas Honors Leadership Program. In 2008, once again under funding by the TEA, the program reemerged as the Texas Governor's School. As of 2010, there are 4 Governor's School programs in the state of Texas.
Lamar University.
The Texas Governor's School for Leadership Development at Lamar University in Beaumont is a free three week residential program with focus on leadership in the Humanities, Language Arts, Mathematics, Fine Arts, and Science.

In 2003, another Governor's school, focusing on science and technology, The Texas Governor's School in Mathematics and Science, was established at the University of North Texas in Denton. A 3-week program, the School focuses on enriching and developing a student's abilities in science and technology as well as exploring the impacts of these fields on past, present, and future societies including ethics, history, and the arts.
Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi.
In 2009, the Texas Higher Education Commission awarded a 3-year grant to Texas A&M University in Corpus Christi to establish a 3-week residential summer program for 100 gifted and talented high school students who are interested in teaching the subjects of science and math. The Governor's Academy for Teaching Excellence (GATE) will commence on July 12.

On December 19, 2005, at midnight, the station signed on as 100.5 The Rock and officially began broadcasting on January 2, 2006 at 10:05 a.m. 
On August 14, 2008, the licensee proposes to amend the licence by changing the frequency from 100.5 MHz (channel 263LP) to 98.5 MHz (channel 253B). That application was denied on December 5, 2008.
On July 14, 2011, 101056012 Saskatchewan Ltd. received CRTC approval to change CJJC-FM's frequency from 100.5 MHz (channel 263LP) to 98.5 MHz (channel 253B). The licensee also proposed to change the authorized contours by relocating its transmitter and increasing the effective radiated power (ERP) from 44.8 to 50,000 watts (non-directional antenna with an effective height of antenna above average terrain of 118 metres). This power increase would result in a change of CJJC-FM's status from a low-power unprotected station to a class B station.
In late 2011 or early 2012, CJJC-FM moved from 100.5 FM to 98.5 FM.

Wellington Town Hall

The Wellington Town Hall is a concert hall and part of the municipal complex in Wellington, New Zealand. The foundation stone for the building was laid in 1901 and construction began the following year. It was officially opened on 7 December 1904. 
The Town Hall was originally fronted (on the Cuba Street side) with a Roman styled portico and a 150 foot clock tower. A clock was not installed in the tower until 1922, when John Blundell, owner of "The Evening Post" newspaper, donated one. In 1934 the tower was removed as a precaution following the 1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake, and the main portico, pediment, balustrade, parapet and bold cornice were also removed. The building was earthquake strengthened in 1943 following an earthquake the previous year. During the strengthening the Corinthian capitals on the exterior were replaced with Tuscan detailing.
The Town Hall may have been a low maintenance priority of councils over the years. By 1973 during a concert (Kenny Rogers and the First Edition) their sound levels caused dust to begin to drift down over the stage. When their music hit a crescendo during the chorus of one piece (may have been "Something's Burning"), the stage ceiling collapsed on them, dropping pigeon bodies, empty and dead eggs, nesting material and plaster rubble and dust all over the stage and the bands' equipment. The concert did continue, with black-dressed stage hands creeping around the stage sweeping up detritus, removing carcasses, and dusting the amplifiers, speaker cases, keyboards, and anything else covered with plaster dust. Shortly after, Wellington's public began to call for an improved concert venue.
In 1980 the Michael Fowler Centre was built immediately in front of the Town Hall's main entrance in anticipation of the older building's demolition. However the New Zealand Historic Places Trust persuaded the City Council to retain the Town Hall. In 1989 plans were unveiled to create Civic Square between the town hall and the old city library. As part of this, the Town Hall underwent full refurbishment from 1991 to 1992. During this process the concert chamber was demolished and replaced with reception rooms. 
The main auditorium has been rated one of the best in the world for acoustic quality. It has hosted numerous live performances (including The Beatles & The Rolling Stones) as well as fashion shows, debutante balls, political rallies and degree conferrals. 
Although the council offices have spread beyond the Town Hall since 1904, the building still houses the offices of the Mayor and city councillors of Wellington City.

Japan Christian Junior College

Japan Christian Junior College was one of only two Nazarene schools of higher learning in Japan, the other being Japan Nazarene Theological Seminary (located in the same building as Meguro Church of the Nazarene in Meguro Ward, Tokyo). Japan Christian Junior College grew to have a student enrollment of nearly 600 by the mid-1990s, with a faculty of nearly 40 part-time and full-time teachers and professors. However, within a decade, student enrollment had dropped significantly, forcing college administration to make drastic changes. 
In 2006, Japan Christian Junior College received full accreditation and Government Recognition from the Ministry of Education for its two areas of study — English and Christianity — with all diplomas and degrees retroactively regarded as equivalents to an American Associate's of Arts degree.
After an announcement by the Board of Regents, with the support of the General Church of the Nazarene, in the spring of 2006, Japan Christian Junior College closed its doors and ceased operations on March 31, 2009. Reasons cited concerned a lack of students (attributed to the falling birth rate in Japan), loss of revenue, and departure of American teachers. All college properties were sold off to housing development companies.

Coast Guard Day

Coast Guard Day is held every August 4 to commemorate the founding of the United States Coast Guard as the Revenue Marine on 4 August, 1790, by then Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton. On that date, Congress, guided by Hamilton, authorized the building of a fleet of the first ten Revenue Service cutters, whose responsibility would be enforcement of the first tariff laws enacted by Congress under the Constitution. 
The Coast Guard received its present name through an act of Congress signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson on 28 January 1915 that merged the Revenue Cutter Service with the U.S. Life-Saving Service, and provided the nation with a single maritime service dedicated to saving life at sea and enforcing the nation's maritime laws. 
The Coast Guard began to maintain the country's maritime aids to navigation, including operating the nation's lighthouses, when President Franklin Roosevelt announced plans to transfer of the U.S. Lighthouse Service to the Coast Guard in May 1939. Congress approved the plan effective 1 July, 1939. On 16 July 1946, Congress permanently transferred the Department of Commerce Bureau of Marine Inspection and Navigation to the Coast Guard, thereby placing merchant marine licensing and merchant vessel safety under Coast Guard regulation. 
After 177 years in the Treasury Department, the Coast Guard was transferred to the newly formed Department of Transportation effective 1 April 1967. As a result of the events of 11 September 2001, the Coast Guard was transferred to the new Department of Homeland Security effective 1 March 2002.
Coast Guard Day is primarily an internal activity for active duty and reserve Coast Guardsmen, civilian employees, retirees, auxiliarists, and dependents, but it does have a significant share of interest outside the service. Coast Guard units throughout the United States usually plan picnics and informal sport competitions together with family and friends on Coast Guard Day. In addition to celebrating their own day every year, Coast Guard members also participate as equal partners in Armed Forces Day activities. Grand Haven, Michigan, also known by act of Congress as Coast Guard City, USA, annually sponsors the Coast Guard Festival the week of August 4.

. Dr. Matthew Pothen Thekaekara (1914–1974) was a scientist and author of many books and papers relating to spectrophotometry and the solar constant besides works on theology.
He was instrumental in publishing some of the earliest AM0 spectra, which is a model spectrum of the sun in space. The historic 1973 Thekaekara spectrum was the basis for ASTM E490 (American Society for Testing and Materials Standard Solar Constant and Zero Air Mass Solar Spectral Irradiance Table) from 1974 to 2000, when it was replaced by the most recent AM0 upgrade, in ASTM E490-00. 
Recent publications such as a 2007 paper authored by fellow Malayali scientist P. Shahmugan made extensive reference to the Thekaekara spectrum. In 2008 a paper by authors from NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and UC Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics also made extensive application of the Thekaekara spectrum.

Black Dianetics

Black Dianetics is a form of Dianetics, as discussed by its creator, L. Ron Hubbard.
Hubbard claimed that Dianetics is a method of achieving set goals using one's mind. According to the Church of Scientology, Dianetics can be used to change and improve one's life. Claims from Scientologists support the idea that Dianetics is a positive concept that can be used to improve an individual's life. However, Hubbard also referred to something he called "Black Dianetics", for which the goals may be mean-spirited, cruel, or exploitative. That is, Black Dianetics employs the methods of Hubbard's ideas for selfish, vindictive, and destructive reasons.
Hubbard warns against the use of Black Dianetics in his 1982 book "Dianetics and Scientology Technical Dictionary" (ISBN 0884040372). It is also mentioned in Hubbard's famous Philadelphia Doctorate Course lectures, as well in other material.

This is a complete list of ice hockey players who were drafted in the National Hockey League by the Chicago Blackhawks franchise. It includes every player who was drafted, regardless of whether they played for the team.
The NHL Entry Draft is held each June, allowing teams to select players who have turned 18 years old by September 15 in the year the draft is held. The draft order is determined by the previous season's order of finish, with non-playoff teams drafting first, followed by the teams that made the playoffs, with the specific order determined by the number of points earned by each team. The NHL holds a weighted lottery for the 14 non-playoff teams, allowing the winner to move up a maximum of four positions in the entry draft. The team with the fewest points has the best chance of winning the lottery, with each successive team given a lower chance of moving up in the draft. Between 1986 and 1994, the NHL also held a Supplemental Draft for players in American colleges.

Rokeach Value Survey

The Rokeach Value Survey (RVS) is a classification system of values. Developed by social psychologist Milton Rokeach, the system consists of two sets of values, 18 individual value items in each. One set is called "terminal values" the other "instrumental values".
Beliefs, Attitudes and Values.
RVS is based on a 1968 volume ("Beliefs, Attitudes, and Values") which presented the philosophical basis for the association of fundamental values with beliefs and attitudes. His value system was instrumentalised into the Rokeach Value Survey in his 1973 book "The Nature of Human Values".
Terminal Values.
Terminal Values refer to desirable end-states of existence. These are the goals that a person would like to achieve during his or her lifetime. These values vary among different groups of people in different cultures. 
The terminal values in RVS are: 
Instrumental Values.
Instrumental Values refer to preferable modes of behavior. These are preferable modes of behavior, or means of achieving the terminal values. 
The Instrumental Values are: 
Survey info.
The task for participants in the survey is to arrange the 18 terminal values, followed by the 18 instrumental values, into an order "of importance to YOU, as guiding principles in YOUR life" (Rokeach, 1973, p. 27). 
The Rokeach Value Survey has been extensively used in empirical work by psychologists, sociologists and marketers. There have been a number of attempts to reduce the 18 instrumental values and 18 terminal values into a set of underlying factors (see for example Feather and Peay, 1975; Johnston, 1995) but without consistent success.

William T. Poague

William Thomas Poague (December 20, 1835 – September 8, 1914) was a Confederate States Army officer serving in the Artillery during the American Civil War. He later served as Treasurer of Virginia Military Institute.
Early life.
Born in Rockbridge County, Virginia to John Barclay and Elizabeth Stuart Paxton Poague, Poague attended and graduated from Washington College where he was a member of the Virginia Beta Chapter of Phi Kappa Psi. Poague was practicing law in St. Joseph, Missouri when the Civil War began.
Civil War.
Poague returned to Virginia, and entered the Confederate Army as a second lieutenant in the famous Rockbridge Virginia Artillery. Poague was promoted to be that unit's captain by April 1862. With the battery, Poague fought at the battles of First Manassas, Romney, Kernstown, McDowell, and later with the Army of Northern Virginia in the Seven Days Battles, the Battle of Cedar Mountain, Second Manassas, the Battle of Harper's Ferry, Antietam, and Fredericksburg. Poague was promoted to major on March 2, 1863. He served as an executive officer to David G. McIntosh at the Battle of Chancellorsville, then was given his own battalion upon the formation of the Third Corps.
Poague commanded the battalion at Gettysburg, the Battle of Mine Run, Bristoe Station, the Wilderness, the Spotsylvania, the North Anna, and Cold Harbor. Poague's best service to the Confederacy probably occurred at the Wilderness. Poague's battalion was able to hold off Winfield S. Hancock's II Corps on the morning of the second day, firing over the heads of wounded Confederates, long enough for Lt. Gen. James Longstreet to arrive and "save the day." Lt. Gen. A.P. Hill turned to Poague, firing double charges, because things were so desperate that it could not be even delayed to allow wounded Confederates to get out of the way. Hill himself helped man Poague's guns. He was wounded twice at the Battle of Cold Harbor. Poague later took part in the defense of Petersburg, finally surrendering at the Battle of Appomattox Court House.
Post War career, death and legacy.
After the War, Poague worked as a farmer, teacher, and lawyer. He represented Rockbridge County in the Virginia House of Delegates. He served Washington College, later Washington and Lee University as a Trustee from 1865 to 1885. He served as the treasurer of the Virginia Military Institute under superintendents Francis H. Smith and Battle of New Market hero Scott Shipp from 1884 until his death on September 8, 1914. He also served as Secretary of the Board of Visitors for VMI. He wrote a set of memoirs entitled "Gunner With Stonewall." Poague's papers are collected at VMI. Poague is buried at Stonewall Jackson Cemetery in Lexington, Virginia.

<doc id="18259752" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18259752" title="Maldit-comiat">
Maldit-comiat

A maldit (, also spelled "maudit"; , modern spelling "maleit", "curse") was a genre of Catalan and Occitan literature practised by the later troubadours. It was a song complaining about a lady's behaviour and character. A related genre, the comiat (, ; "dismissal"), was a song renouncing a lover. The maldit and the comiat were often connected as a maldit-comiat (or "comiat-maldit") and they could be used to attack and renounce a figure other than a lady or a lover, like a commanding officer (when combined, in a way, with the "sirventes"). The "maldit-comiat" is especially associated with the Catalan troubadours. Martí de Riquer describes "un autèntic maldit-comiat" as a song where a poet leaves a mistress to whom he has long been fruitlessly devoted, and explains her failings which have led him to depart. 
The earliest "comiat" is probably a fragmentary work by Uc Catola, of the first generation of troubadours.
"Maldits" in Catalonia.
The most famous "maldit" is probably poem XLII of Ausiàs March. It is a virulent attack on several named women. The poem is only explicitly named as a "maldit" in one minor manuscript, but since the term could refer, at its most general, to any poem "cursing" another, the term is accepted by modern scholars as accurate. Other Catalan authors who wrote "maldits", so identified in the manuscripts or by later scholars, include Pau de Bellviure, Pere de Queralt, Simon Pastor, Jordi de Sant Jordi, Joan Basset (two), Guillem de Masdovelles (three), Johan Berenguer de Masdovelles (ten), and Pere Johan de Masdovelles (two). Francesc Ferrer in "Lo conhort" quotes from six other authors, works which may have been "maldits". It was evidently a popular genre in the second quarter of the fifteenth century. 
All of the above poets do not name their lovers and do not include a "comiat" in their poems. On the basis of this, March has been argued to be creating a new form, politically motivated and less encumbered by the ethics of courtly love. The composers of traditional "maldits" often refer to their women by "senhals" (code names) like "Na Maliciosa" (Lady Malicious) and "Na Mondina" (Worldly Lady). Simon Pastor, however, wrote a "maldit" against an unnamed man. The "Leys d'amor", the guiding treatise of the Consistori de Tolosa and the Consistori de Barcelona, condemned the "maldig especial" (regarded as usually a type of "sirventes"), which attacked a specific individual ("alquna certa persona": some certain person).
"Comiats" in Catalonia.
Bernart de Palaol wrote a "comiat" that has often been misidentified as a "maldit" or "comiat-maldit", when in fact it contains no invective. Guillem de Masdovelles, besides his three "maldits", wrote one "comiat", perhaps his most famous piece. He takes leave, not of his lover, but of the military service of Guerau Alamany de Cervelló, the governor of Catalonia ("governador de moltes gens e pobles", governor of many peoples and towns) at the time (1394–1405). From the same family, Johan Berenguer wrote a "comiat" often mis-characterised as a "comiat-maldit". Another Catalan poet of the "comiat" was Blai Saselles.
Seven characteristics of a "maldit".
Robert Archer suggests (p. 73) the following seven (four typical, three common) characteristics of a "maldit" based on his analysis of surviving examples:
Archer does not interpret March's famous poem LXII as a "maldit-comiat", though he admits it is a "maldit" in the general sense. One reason for this is that March was not the lover of the woman he is attacking.

Muhamad Salih Dilan

Dilan (in Kurdish: محه‌مه‌د ساڵح دیلان) is regarded as one of the most influential Kurdish Poets and one of the greatest maqam singers of his time. He was one of the few early poets that brought a revolution in Kurdish poetry and literature in the 20th century.
Biography.
Dilan was born in Goizha, a neighborhood in Slemani. His family's origins were from Qala Chuwalan, along with the Kurdish Principality of Baban, they settled in Sulaimaniyah in 1784. His father, Ahmed Dilan was a poetry enthusiast and a maqam specialist, apart from Kurdish he was fluent in Persian and Arabic, he played a key role in his son's love for poetry and maqam. Dilan went to Xalidiye Primary School, before completing secondary school, his father became ill; family responsibilities fell on his shoulder and he had no choice but to leave school and work. He was offered a job at the local tobacco company as a Clerk.
The poet.
The first poem Dilan wrote was in 1948, at a festival, he recited the poem to the famous Kurdish nationalist poet Faiq Bekas.
According to Dilan himself, Bekas refused to believe he was the writer which most likely was due to the poem having such depth in meaning and strict lyricality.
Newroz.
In 1948, Dilan and his brother, Qadir Dilan, a musician, met with Piramerd in a Mewlewi street, the ageing philosopher took out his cigarette packet and wrote the Newroz poem on it before handing it over to them, he then asked if they could write a melody for the poem and if Dilan himself could sing it when Newroz arrives. It didn't take long before Qadir Dilan wrote the timeless Newroz melody with Dilan being the first artist to sing it on March 21, 1948. Today all over the cities of Kurdistan the song is played when Newroz arrives.
In prison.
From 1947 to 1966 Dilan was arrested, tortured and imprisoned for 13 years for his involvement in Kurdish independence movements and at times for his art, many of his poems were written while he was in prison in 1963 for writing "Rez" (In Kurdish: ڕه‌ز, In English: Vineyard), he served one year in prison.
There he recalls various events, Omar Kayyam's famous poem about the wind braking his glass of wine and the blaming of God by the poet, the other event being Plato's supposed hiding in the wine vessels before his writings occurred, then Dilan compares them with the burning of the villages and the vineyards in the early 1960s by the Iraqi government. The poem is a comparison between three events yet the only connection between them is grape, Kayyam drinking the wine, Plato thinking inside the wine vessel and the vineyards burning in Kurdistan, the poem's deep meaning and contrast shows why it's considered a masterpiece of Kurdish poetry.
Diwan of Dilan.
Dilan's colleague Abdulla Agreen took on the task of collecting his poems and publishing a Diwan under the name "Diwani Dilan". The book was published in 1987.
Death.
On 28 September 1990, Dilan died at the age of 63 and was buried at the Seywan cemetery in his hometown.

Combinatorial biology

In biotechnology, combinatorial biology is the creation of a large number of compounds (usually proteins or peptides) through technologies such as phage display. Similar to combinatorial chemistry, compounds are produced by biosynthesis rather than organic chemistry. This process was developed independently by Richard A. Houghten and H. Mario Geysen in the 1980s. Combinatorial biology allows the generation and selection of the large number of ligands for high-throughput screening.
These large numbers of peptides are generated and screened by physically linking a gene encoding a protein and a copy of this protein. This could involve the protein being fused to the M13 minor coat protein pIII, with the gene encoding this protein being held within the phage particle. Large libraries of phages with different proteins on their surfaces can then be screened through automated selection and amplification for a protein that binds tightly to a particular target.

M.O.V.I.E. is a video game written by Dusko Dimitrijevic for the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC and was published by Imagine Software in 1986.
Plot.
M.O.V.I.E is set in New York in the 1930s. The player takes the role of Jack Marlow, a private investigator who must enter the headquarters of mob boss Bugs Malloy in order to retrieve an audiotape. In order to help him complete this task, Marlow needs the help of a girl called Tanya. Unfortunately, she has an identical twin called Vanya who is allied to Malloy and who will deliberately lead him into trouble.
Gameplay.
The game is an arcade adventure which uses an isometric display to portray the action. Movement is achieved by rotating the main character and moving him forward, similar to that of "Knightlore" and other early examples of the genre. The player can also access a panel of icons which allow Marlow to carry out certain actions such as dropping and taking items, shooting his firearm, punching, throwing an item or talking. The latter is performed using speech-bubbles in which the player can type out words and phrases using the keyboard.
Many consider the 2011 Rockstar game "L.A. Noire" to be heavily influenced by "M.O.V.I.E."

Marin Local Music

Marin Local Music is a social network for people who support live, local music in Marin County, California. Other online social networks such as Facebook or MySpace seek to create virtual, global communities with technology. MLM starts with a very real community and simply uses technology to organize, inform and promote its members and activities. By maintaining a single focus on music in a small geographical area, it is possible to include every possible facet of the community and get the most complete coverage. The technology not only makes information easily accessible, it also enables each of the individual members to contribute on their own. This keeps the information fresh, relevant, and personal to keep things interesting.
Marin Local Music promotes local bands, publicizes local merchants, and produces events in Marin County, California. Marin Local Music has been involved with "Stop the Spray", "Home Away from Homelessness", "Search for the Cause Gala" and many other events. 
History.
MLM is created by everyone in the network, but the network itself was created by Shelley and Dave Champine.
Shelley has been producing, managing, and promoting live entertainment for over 20 years. Her degree in theatre with emphasis in stage management and direction formed the foundation of her career. Upon moving to San Francisco, she joined Beach Blanket Babylon and worked in numerous production roles for nearly 11 years. For several years while raising two wonderful kids, she took side projects in corporate event planning and theatrical production. With kids came a move to the suburbs, but she never lost her desire to get out and dance! After continuous frustration scouring newspapers and trying to convince her friends that there really was nightlife in Marin, she decided to apply her considerable organizational skills to this very real problem. With the encouragement of numerous musicians and venues, Shelley started La Vida Local Events to promote live events. What better way to promote events than to provide the most comprehensive list of everything to do with music in Marin?
This is where Dave gets involved. While Dave also has a degree in Theatre, his career is in technology. He has been designing, building, maintaining and marketing networks and software for nearly 20 years. His experience includes building the e-mail network for Charles Schwab and directing software product development for systems used by millions of users worldwide. Dave also founded his own company and has been general manager for multiple software product lines - the opportunity to work together with his wife and bring together their combined skills for such an obvious need was too good to ignore.
Marin Local Music has only been up and running since June 2008, but the response has been overwhelming. Already there are hundreds of entries for bands, venues, and resources in every corner of Marin and over 110 live music events going on every week! The website is bursting with information and there are new visitors and users signing up to add information every day. Sign up if you haven't already and you too can support local music by posting pictures, commenting on events, bands, and venues and helping to get people off the couch and on the dance floor.
Technology.
The website itself is built using Drupal, a powerful, open-source content management system. This provides a very flexible, scalable way to present information and allows other members of the music community to contribute content.

When the U.S. entered World War I in April,1917, she was seized and converted to a troop transport. Originally commissioned as USS "Hamburg" (ID-3013), the ship was renamed "Powhatan" on 5 September 1917, During World War I, she carried 15,274 troops to France and after the war she returned 11,803 servicemen to the United States.

The SS Hamburg was originally intended to be named "Bavaria", being renamed only a month prior to launching. On completion, SS Hamburg served the Hamburg-Far East (until 1904 when Hapag and NDL no longer combined on the mail route), Hamburg-New York and Genoa-New York runs for the Hamburg America Line. The ship was also twice used by Kaiser Wilhelm II as his state yacht for foreign visits, during which time the ship was painted white overall.
