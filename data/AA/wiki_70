Ioane Shavteli

Ioane Shavteli () was a Georgian poet of the late 12th and early 13th centuries credited to have written the encomiastic poem traditionally, and unsuitably, known as "Abdulmesiani" (აბდულმესიანი), i.e., "Slave of the Messiah" (from Arabic عبد المسيح, Abdul Masīh). 
A reference to Shavteli and his work is made in a postscript of Shota Rustaveli’s "The Knight in the Panther's Skin" (ვეფხისტყაოსანი), which is the source of the poem's incongruous title. Shavteli's ode is, in fact, a eulogy to the two greatest monarchs of medieval Georgia, David "the Builder" (r. 1089-1125) and the poet's contemporary Queen Tamar (r. 1184-1213). Little is known about the author’s biography himself. "Shavteli" seems to be a territorial epithet, meaning "of/from Shavsheti" (modern Şavşat, Turkey). Shavteli's style includes a strong patristic discourse and his language is to a considerable extent artificial and archaically bookish. Possibly a cleric, he is reported by the medieval chronicles to have been a famous poet and philosopher and to have accompanied Tamar in several of her travels and military campaigns. 
Shavteli's panegyric focuses on praising the Christian virtues of David and Tamar, without naming either however. The references to Tamar are coded by praise of her beauty, her love of "doing good by stealth", also praised in similar phrases by the queen's chronicler as well as by the two contemporary poets - Rustaveli and Chakhrukhadze. David can be recognized by allusions to his biblical namesake (from whom the Georgian dynasty of Bagrationi claimed descent) as well as by interweaving words and phrases from the king’s own religious lyrics, "the Hymns of Penitence" (გალობანი სინანულისანი).

Johnnie Allan

Johnnie Allan, real name John Allen Guillot, is a pioneer of the swamp pop musical genre.
Born March 10, 1938, in Rayne, Louisiana, Allan, a Cajun, grew up in a musical family, and at age six obtained his first guitar. By age thirteen he was playing with Walter Mouton and the Scott Playboys, a traditional Cajun music band. About two years later he switched to Lawrence Walker and the Wandering Aces, another traditional Cajun band. 
In 1956 he saw Elvis Presley perform live on the Louisiana Hayride music program, and shortly afterwards Allan began to play rock and roll music. In 1958 he left Walker to form the Krazy Kats, and in doing so helped to pioneer what became known as swamp pop music.
That same year he recorded "Lonely Days, Lonely Nights" for the Jin label of Ville Platte, Louisiana, and the song became a swamp pop classic. 
He later recorded for Mercury Records and the Viking label of Crowley, Louisiana, among others.
He returned to the Jin label in the early 1970s and went on to record many notable swamp pop tunes, including his versions of Chuck Berry's "Promised Land" and Merle Haggard's "Somewhere on Skid Row."
A perennial favorite of swamp pop fans globally, Allan has performed in Europe well over a dozen times. He is author of two music-related books, "Memories: A Pictorial History of South Louisiana Music" (1988) and "Born to Be a Loser" (1992, with Bernice Larson Webb), a biography of swamp pop musician Jimmy Donley.
A retired educator, he lives in Lafayette, Louisiana.

Harry Grey

Herschel Goldberg, better known as Harry Grey (November 2, 1901 – October 1980), was an American writer. His first book, "The Hoods" (1952), was the model for the film, "Once Upon a Time in America" by Sergio Leone, where his part was played by Robert De Niro. This was one of the few autobiographies of real gangsters. It is believed that the real name of the author was Goldberg and that his memoir, partially factual, partially subconsciously altered, and partially fictional, was written when Goldberg was incarcerated in the Sing-Sing prison. 
After "The Hoods", Grey published two more books, "Call Me Duke" (1955) and "Portrait of a Mobster" (1958), also based on his experience as a gangster, but these have had much less success.
A "Golden Palm Star", part of the Palm Springs Walk of Stars, was dedicated to Grey in 1999.
Biography.
Grey's real name was Herschel Goldberg. Born in Odessa, Russia (now Ukraine) in 1901, son of Israel and Celia Goldberg, emigrated to the United States in 1905 and dropped out of schooling in the seventh grade. He was the brother of Hyman Goldberg, a syndicated columnist and food critic for the "New York Post" and author of several books including "Our Man in the Kitchen", a compilation of recipes from his column as "Prudence Penny".
In 1912, Goldberg's father became seriously ill and had to be taken to hospital for an operation. During his stay in hospital, Celia began cooking meals for men in the neighborhood who were saving money to bring their families to America from Europe. When Israel came out of hospital he found that Celia had a flourishing business and Israel started a restaurant. All the children, including Harry and Hyman, helped out.
In 1932, Grey married Mildred Becker, a college graduate and had three children, Beverle, Harvey, and Simeon. After being hospitalized by an accident in his fifties, Harry decided to write about life in the twenties and thirties and the syndicates that controlled businesses in New York. To protect himself and his family he changed the family name to Grey.
Grey died in October 1980, shortly before filming of "Once Upon a Time in America" began.
In December 1999, Harry's son Simeon sponsored a star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars for his father under the name of Harry "Noodles" Grey. Biographical details are attached to this star. Palm Springs Walk of Stars dedication

Marie Elisabeth of Valois

Marie Elisabeth of France (27 October 1572 – 9 April 1578) was the only child of Charles IX of France and Elisabeth of Austria. Her maternal grandparents were Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor and Maria of Spain, her paternal grandparents were Henry II of France and Catherine de' Medici. Her godmother was Elizabeth I of England. Her father had times of madness, so her grandmother Catherine served as regent. The Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre occurred only two months before Marie Elisabeth's birth. When Marie Elisabeth was less than two years of age her father, King Charles IX died and her uncle became Henry III of France. Her mother then returned to Vienna after Maximilian II repaid her dowry, leaving Marie Elisabeth on 25 November 1575, never to see her again.
Marie Elisabeth was raised at the court and later in Paris, where she died on 2 April 1578, apparently of frail health, at the age of six.

Union Mills (Fall River, Massachusetts)

Union Mills is a historic textile mill complex located on Pleasant Street in Fall River, Massachusetts.
The Union Mills company was incorporated in 1859, and was the first large steam-powered mill built in the city, having installed Corliss steam engines. The buildings are constructed from local Fall River granite. The company's first president was S. Angier Chace, and David Anthony was the first treasurer. It was the first mill corporation established in the city on the basis of general subscriptions.
In 1865, Mill No. 2 was constructed. In 1876 the original gable roofs of both mills were removed and replaced with flat roofs, thereby adding additional floor space. A third mill was later constructed adjacent to Mill No. 2, but was demolished in the 1960s for the construction of Interstate 195. Production of textiles ceased in 1929. 
In 1968 the site was photographed by Jack E. Boucher of the Historic American Buildings Survey, along with the adjacent Durfee Mills, as part of the New England Textile Mill Survey II, led by Robert M. Vogel of the Smithsonian Institution. The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.
Over the years, the Union Mills have been occupied by numerous small businesses, including Nate Lions Appliance Warehouse for many years before its move to the nearby Durfee Mills. Both mills have been completely restored and are now the location of Prima CARE Medical Center.

<doc id="18464225" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18464225" title="HMS Glengyle">
HMS Glengyle

HMS "Glengyle" was a Landing Ship, Infantry (Large) of the Royal Navy. This ship saw service in the Second World War, carrying Commonwealth and other Allied troops in amphibious operations. "Glengyle" was able to make good speed on long ocean voyages to operational areas and then, by means of the many landing craft carried aboard, land assault infantry, vehicles, and stores on contested shores.
Design and conversion.
"Glengyle" was built by Caledon Shipbuilding & Engineering Company, Dundee, for the Glen Line. In 1938, whilst "Glengyle" and her sisters, "Glenearn", "Glenroy", and "Breconshire" were being built, the Inter-Service Training and Development Centre determined that they would be ideal for infantry landing ships. This class of four fast passenger-carrying cargo ships (“cargo-liners”) then under construction were intended for the Far Eastern trade route. The Admiralty acquired "Glengyle" shortly after her launch, and she was converted into a fast supply ship. During April and June 1940, she underwent further conversion into an Infantry Landing Ship capable of transporting an embarked force of up to 34 officers and 663 other ranks and carrying 12 LCAs on Welin-McLachan davits and 1 LCM stored in chocks on deck and launched by 30-ton derricks. She was accepted into service on 10 September and, on 31 January 1941, "Glengyle" sailed around Africa to the Mediterranean, where she became part of Layforce.
Service history.
"Glengyle" was part of the Bardia raid on 19–20 April 1941, and later that month was involved in the evacuation of Greece. She evacuated some 4,500 troops from Raphto and, in May, carried another 3,000 to Crete. Later in May, she and the SS "Cameronia" evacuated 6,000 Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders as part of the evacuation of Crete. On 8 June, "Glengyle" was operating with the cruisers HMS "Phoebe", HMAS "Perth" and HMS "Calcutta" at the start of the Syria-Lebanon Campaign. By January 1942, she was part of the Malta Convoys, carrying supplies from Alexandria, before returning to Britain in April for preparations for the Dieppe Raid. To keep secret the presence of an Infantry Landing Ship, "Glengyle" was disguised as a tanker, and was present at the operation on 19 August, transporting The Essex Scottish Regiment to White Beach.
She returned to the Mediterranean in November, where she was used to transport US troops for the Operation Torch landings, and was also involved in the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943, during which Admiral Philip Vian briefly commanded a squadron aboard her. After transporting troops to Salerno in September, "Glengyle" sailed to Bombay, but was then recalled to participate in Operation Shingle, the landings at Anzio. After this had been completed, she was refitted at Liverpool, where her LCA capacity was increased to 24 by the fitting of luffing davits and inboard cradles for the additional craft. Room was found to berth an additional LCM on deck and a new 50 ton derrick was installed. "Glengyle"'s next voyage following refit was transporting the 5th Airborne Division to Bombay. She was at Trincomalee in August, and in company with the Union-Castle Line's "Llanstephan Castle", she transported 3 Commando Brigade to Hong Kong, arriving shortly after the end of the War.
Post-war.
"Glengyle" was transferred to the Australian Naval Board in October, landing a garrison at Singapore, as well as repatriating Australian troops from South-East Asia. She transported a garrison to Kure in January 1946, before returning home with liberated British prisoners of war from Manila. "Glengyle" was returned to the Glen Line on 17 July, and after being refitted for a return to merchant service at Vickers-Armstrongs, re-entered service on 3 March 1948. She was transferred to the Blue Funnel Line in October 1970 and was renamed "Deucalion", but by June 1971 she had been broken up at Kaohsiung.

Sagamore Mills No. 1 and No. 3

Sagamore Mills No. 1 and No. 3 are two historic textile mills on Ace Street in Fall River, Massachusetts.
The Sagamore Mills company was established in 1872 with Louis L. Barnard as the first president. The original Mill No.1 was constructed in 1872 from red brick, and completed in July 1873.
The company failed in 1879, and was soon reorganized as the Sagamore Manufacturing Company. Mill No. 2 was added on nearby North Main Street in 1882.
On April 24, 1884 Mill No. 1, was destroyed by fire, and was not rebuilt until 1888.
In 1908 Mill No. 3 was built from native Fall River granite hauled by rail from a quarry in nearby Assonet. It is one of the few mills located "below the hill" in Fall River that were constructed of granite rather than red brick, which was typically less expensive due to transport costs of the granite from the quarries located in the eastern part of the city.
Mill No. 3 is one of the largest single mills constructed in the city. It was later occupied by Trina Manufacturing, Inc.
Mills No. 1 and 3 were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, with a separate listing for Mill No. 2

The North Main Street mill was later occupied by Joan Fabrics (later known as Main Street Textiles) until 2001, when it opened a huge new plant in the city's industrial park. (This plant closed a few years later). 
The site was added to the National Historic Register in 1983, and has recently been restored.

The aim of World Standards Day is to raise awareness among regulators, industry and consumers as to the importance of standardization to the global economy.
14 October was specifically chosen to mark the date, in 1946, when delegates from 25 countries first gathered in London and decided to create an international organization focused on facilitating standardization. Even though ISO was formed one year later, it wasn't until 1970 that the first World Standards Day was celebrated. 
Around the globe, various activities are chosen by national bodies to commemorate the date. The United States will be holding a U.S. Celebration of World Standards Day on 3 October. The Standards Council of Canada (SCC), Canada's national accreditation body, celebrates World Standards Day together with the international community by observing the day near the dates of the international observance. In 2012 SCC celebrated World Standards Day on Friday, October 12.

Maria Pauer

Maria Pauer (October 1734/36 – 1750 in Salzburg), was an alleged Austrian witch. She was the last person to be executed for witchcraft in Austria. 
Maria Pauer was a maid in the St. Catherine suburb in Salzburg. In January 1749, she had run an errand for her employer to another house, and afterwards, the house was tormented by poltergeist phenomena. This led to her arrest. The conditions in prison made her apathetic and weak. She was interrogated with 527 questions in two months. Anna Maria Zötlin and Liesel Gusterer were also arrested and executed in 1749. Torture was used, and in September 1750, she confessed her guilt. She was sentenced to death and decapitated and burned on October 6, 1750.

Rigby High School

Rigby High School is a four-year public secondary school in Rigby, Idaho, part of the Jefferson County Joint School District #251. The approximate enrollment is 900 students in grades 9 to 12, from Rigby and surrounding communities. The school colors are maroon, white, and gold, and the mascot is a Trojan.
History.
Rigby High School was established in 1912, with the first graduation in 1916. The school was originally located near Rigby City Park. The mascot was originally a Red Devil, and the school colors were red and white. It wasn't until the early 1950s, when a high school located in the smaller, neighboring town of Menan burnt down and its students came to Rigby, that the school was given the mascot of the Trojans. In the sixties and seventies the high school was replaced with a new building, which is now Rigby Junior High. Also in the 1960s, Rigby High School gained more students from the smaller high school of Roberts. Rigby High has resided in its current building, just west of the city limits, since 1988 and a new high school started construction beginning of 2011 and will be finished sometime in 2013. The new building is located immediately to the east of the current high school building where the upper four grades (9–12) will move into the new one and the current high school building will house grades (6–8). As of 2014, the school principal is Yvonne Thurber.
The elevation of the RHS campus is above sea level.
Athletics.
Rigby competes in athletics in IHSAA Class 4A, the second-highest classification in the state. It is a member of the High Country Conference (4A). Rigby is known locally for having an award winning Track and Field team. It also has an extended history of successful basketball teams.
Notable graduates.
The inventor of the television, Philo Farnsworth, got his idea while attending the school, and graduated from Rigby High School (not in the current building), as did Vardis Fisher, the author. Other notable graduates include NFL Hall of Famer Larry Wilson (class of 1956) and pioneer of oceanography, Claude E. Zobell.

Ferdinand Schaal

Ferdinand Friedrich Schaal (7 February 1889 — 9 October 1962) was a German career military officer and panzer commander in World War II. He commanded the 10th Panzer Division in the 1939 Invasion of Poland and directed the successful Siege of Calais in 1940. Later, he became involved in the unsuccessful July 20 plot against Adolf Hitler and the implementation of Operation Walküre that was to follow. For this, he was imprisoned until the end of the war.
Early life and World War I.
Ferdinand was born on 7 February 1889 in Brunswick, Lower Saxony.
In 1908, at the age of 19, Schaal joined the military as an officer in a regiment of dragoons. After World War I, he became a captain of cavalry in the Reichswehr.
World War 2.
In April 1939, as part of the lead-up to the invasion of Poland, Schaal was tapped to lead the new 10th Panzer Division. He continued to command that unit through the invasions of Poland, France, and the USSR. On 16 March 1942, as the 10th Panzer Division returned to France from its bloody tour of the Eastern Front, Schaal was given the command of LVI Panzer Corps, which was also stationed in the Soviet Union. He served in that capacity until 1 August 1943, when he became Wehrmacht commander in the military district of Bohemia and Moravia.
Operation Walküre.
His role in Operation Walküre was to involve subduing the Nazi party and establishing military control over Bohemia and Moravia. On the evening of 20 July 1944, Schaal waited for clarification on how to proceed from General Friedrich Fromm, a co-conspirator in Berlin. None came, however, as the assassination attempt had failed and Fromm had decided to betray the other plotters. Schaal was arrested the next day on the orders of Heinrich Himmler and imprisoned. Unlike many of his compatriots in the German resistance, Schaal avoided execution and survived the war.

Willie Ferguson

William Copeland Ferguson was a Scottish footballer and manager best known for his time at Chelsea and Dumfries side Queen of the South. His position was usually as a left winger.
Early years.
A native of Muirkirk, he was still a child when his family moved to Kirkconnel. It was there with local side Kello Rovers that he started in football.
Queen of the South (1st spell).
Willie Ferguson first joined fledgling Queen of the South in nearby Dumfries during season 1921-22, their third season after formation. Ferguson was the fourth of the players at the club in its first three seasons who would go on build successful careers in England's top division. The others were Dave Halliday, Ian Dickson and Hughie Gallacher. Ferguson failed to complete the season at Queens as his talents attracted big name attention.
Chelsea.
Ferguson signed for London club Chelsea. Between then and his departure in 1933 he made 294 first team appearances scoring 11 goals.
The club were relegated in 1923-24 and in four of the next five seasons were to narrowly miss out on promotion, finishing 5th, 3rd, 4th and 3rd. They finally reached the First Division again in 1929-30, where they were to remain for the next 32 years.
To capitalise on the 1930 promotion, the club spent £25,000 ($49,000) on three big-name players; Scots Hughie Gallacher, Alex Jackson and Alec Cheyne. Gallacher in particular was one of the biggest talents of his era, known for his goalscoring and for having captained Newcastle to a championship in 1926-27. Gallacher and Jackson had also been members of the Wembley Wizards team, the Scotland team which beat England 5-1 at Wembley in 1928. Gallacher was Chelsea's top scorer in each of his four seasons, scoring 81 goals in total, but his time in west London was filled by long suspensions for indiscipline. Though the team sometimes clicked, such as in a 6-2 win over Manchester United and a 5-0 win over Sunderland trophies remained elusive through the 30s. Some felt money was too often spent on inappropriate players, especially forwards, while the defence remained neglected. 
The FA Cup was to be the closest the club came to silverware. In 1932, the team secured impressive wins over Liverpool and Sheffield Wednesday, and were drawn against Newcastle United in the semi-finals. Tommy Lang inspired Newcastle to a 2-0 lead, before Gallacher pulled one back for Chelsea. The Blues laid siege to the United goal in the second half, but were unable to make a breakthrough and the Geordies went on to lift the trophy.
St Bernards.
Ferguson returned to Scotland mid season and played 17 games in the second part of 1932-33 with St Bernards F.C.
Queen of the South (2nd spell).
Ferguson re-joined Queen of the South as the club's notable signing in the Summer of 1933 ahead of the club's debut season in Scottish Football's top division. They had been promoted as runners up to Hibernian the season before. Willie's brother Pearson Ferguson played five games for Queens between January and April of the previous season. The two never played in the same Queens team together.
As a player Ferguson was part of two landmark events in the history of Queen of the South:-
Other players at the club during this time included Willie Savage, Willie Culbert, Joe Tulip and Irish international Laurie Cumming.
After combining playing with coaching the reserve side in the last year and earning much praise Ferguson took over from George McLachlan as Queens manager in 1937. Ferguson gave Jackie Oakes his first team debut shortly after taking over. Ferguson's most notable result as manager was at Ibrox Park, the first time when Queens condemned Rangers to a league defeat (Queens had condemned Rangers to a Scottish Cup defeat the season before at Palmerston Park). Phil Watson in 1938 was another player signed by Ferguson.
A popular figure at the club it was a surprise when he announced his resignation in the Summer of 1938. Ferguson wanted to focus on his confectionary and tobacconist business recently acquired from ex Queens goalkeeper George Woods. All of Ferguson's time at Queens was spent in Scotland's top division (excluding war time interruption Queens spent only one season out of the top division between 1933 and 1959).
He was succeeded as manager on 2 July 1938 by Jimmy McKinnell Sr, the day on which Ferguson's contracted was terminated after his resignation.
Later years.
Willie Ferguson owned the tobacconist shop on Great King St in Dumfries opposite the G.P.O. His son Chris ran the business until the early 1990s.

Sanford Spinning Co.

Sanford Spinning Company is an historic mill complex located on Globe Mills Avenue in Fall River, Massachusetts. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983, along with the adjacent Globe Yarn Mills #3.
History.
The Globe Yarn Company was founded in 1881 by William H. Jennings and Arnold B. Sanford. Mill No. 1 was built soon after on Globe Street. Mill No. 2 was added in 1885, just downhill of the first mill. In 1887, Mill No. 3 was built on Globe Mills Avenue. It is 354 feet long by 100 feet wide. The two Globe Street mills were added to the National Register of Historic Places under a separate listing, as Globe Yarn Mills.
In 1891, the Sanford Spinning Company was established on Globe Mills Avenue by Arnold B. Sanford and Arthur H. Mason for the production of fine cotton yarns. Mill No. 1 is built of brick, and is three stories, measuring 374 feet long by 100 feet with. It initially contained about 37,300 mule spindles. The company also built a dye house to the north of the main mill, measuring 150 feet by 68 feet with 2-1/2 stories. 
In 1899, the mill, along with the nearby Globe Yarn Mills became part of the New England Cotton Yarns Company, a conglomerate of spinning mills based in New Bedford, with plants in Taunton and North Dighton as well. In 1917, the Sanford Mill was sold to the Passaic Cotton Mills, of New Jersey. It was subsequently sold to American Cotton Fabric Corporation in 1923. The following year, the mill was acquired by Firestone Tire & Rubber Company and operated as Firestone Cotton Mills, for the production of tire yarns. 
In 1920, Firestone also built a second, new two story mill to the west of the former Globe Yarn Mill No. 3, which it had also acquired. The property is and is now part of Duro Industries. Former Firestone Mill No. 3, along with the original Sanford dye house have since demolished for the construction of the new Kuss Middle School.

Dilectissima Nobis

Dilectissima Nobis, "On Oppression of the Church of Spain", is an encyclical issued by Pope Pius XI on June 3, 1933, in which he decried persecution of the Church in Spain, citing the expropriation of all Church buildings, episcopal residences, parish houses, seminaries and monasteries. He protested "serious offenses committed against the Divine Majesty, with the numerous violations of His sacrosanct rights and with so many transgressions of His laws, We have sent to heaven fervent prayers asking God to pardon the offenses against Him".
History.
The Republican government which came to power in Spain in 1931 was strongly anti-Catholic, secularising education, prohibiting religious education in the schools, and expelling the Jesuits from the country. The Spanish Constitution of 1931 was marked by the deprivation of the rights of Catholics. By law, the Church's properties became the property of the state, and the Church had to pay the state rent and taxes in order to continue its use of these properties. In the pope's words: "Thus the Catholic Church is compelled to pay taxes on what was violently wrenched from her". The encyclical also denounced the fact that religious vestments, liturgical instruments, statues, pictures, vases, gems and similar objects necessary for worship were expropriated as well. It condemned the expropriation of all private Catholic schools from religious orders in order to reopen them as secular schools.
Pope Pius XI, whose church faced similar persecutions in the USSR and Mexico, called on Spanish Catholics to defend themselves against the persecution with all legal means. He had previously condemned similar destructive forces in the encyclical "Quas Primas" in 1925.
The encyclical pointed to greed as a motivation for the theft of the Church's artistic treasures and indicated that the government showed no regard for the dignity of country's faithful and their attachment to these religious works of art.
Although the government was heavily criticised, the Pope noted: "Universally known is the fact that the Catholic Church is never bound to one form of government more than to another, provided the Divine rights of God and of Christian consciences are safe". The encyclical called the acts of the Spanish government an "offence not only to Religion and the Church, but also to those declared principles of civil liberty on which the new Spanish regime declares it bases itself".

USS May (SP-164)

USS "May" (SP-164) was a yacht purchased by the United States Navy during World War I. She was outfitted with two guns and two machine guns, and was assigned to patrol the Atlantic Ocean coast and Caribbean and to protect Allied ships from German submarines. After over two years of patrol work, she ran aground off Cape Engano on the Dominican Republic and had to be abandoned.
A Scottish-built yacht.
"May" — a steam yacht built in 1891 by Ailsa Shipbuilding Co., Troon, Scotland — was purchased by the Navy from J. R. De Lamar on 11 August 1917; and commissioned on 7 October 1917.

Italo-Ethiopian Treaty of 1928

The Italo-Ethiopian Treaty of 1928, also known as the Italo–Ethiopian Treaty of Friendship and Arbitration, was a treaty signed between the Kingdom of Italy ("Regno d'Italia") and the Ethiopian Empire (Abyssinia) on 2 August 1928. 
"Nigiste Negest" Zewditu I ruled Ethiopia at the time of this treaty. But it was 36-year-old "Ras" Tafari Makonnen who represented the government of Ethiopia. Tafari, while still in his minority, was heir apparent and Regent Plenipotentiary. 
Within two months, on 7 October 1928, "Ras" Tafari would be proclaimed "Negus". A little over two years later, on 2 November 1930, Zewditu had died and Tafari was proclaimed "Nəgusä Nägäst" Haile Selassie I.
Background.
In 1926, Italy and Britain attempted a joint commercial penetration of Ethiopia. By bringing pressure jointly upon "Ras" Tafari, the Italians planned to exploit a railway and the British hoped to construct a mighty water works for irrigating the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. While Tafari yielded momentarily, he subsequently made a protest to the League of Nations so potent that British public opinion turned against the water works scheme and it was cancelled. This left the Italians in the lurch.
Rather than give up his own plans, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini enlisted the aid of King Victor Emmanuel's cousin, the Duke of Abruzzi. In 1928, with pomp and panoply, the Duke and a suite of Royal proportions crossed the Mediterranean, sailed down the eastern coast of Africa, and then struck inland to Ethiopia and its remote capital, Addis Ababa. The Duke thawed the suspicious Tafari's reservations by giving him a large Isotta-Fraschini limousine, a luxurious Italian product which at that time sold in the United States for some $18,000 ($242,400 in 2013 dollars) along with many other gifts.
Details.
The treaty declared a 20-year friendship between the two nations, access to the sea for Ethiopia, a road for Italy, and an agreement to settle future disagreements through the League of Nations. Specifically, the treaty:
Aftermath.
Both sides were at cross purposes when they approached the Italo-Ethiopian Treaty of 1928. Mussolini wanted the treaty to be a vehicle that allowed Italy to penetrate Ethiopia economically. He never intended to approach the League of Nations for arbitration. Meanwhile, "Ras" Tafari wanted arbitration but never intended to allow the Italian road from the sea to be built. He considered the road from Asseb a natural invasion route.

Norman G. Baker

Norman G. Baker (November 27, 1882September 10, 1958) was an early American radio broadcaster, entrepreneur and inventor who secured fame as well as state and federal prison terms by promoting a supposed cure for cancer in the 1930s. He operated radio stations KTNT in Muscatine, Iowa and the border blaster XENT in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas. Baker was also the inventor of the Tangley calliaphone (an air blown musical instrument similar to a calliope).
Early life.
Baker was born to a wealthy family in the small Mississippi river town of Muscatine, Iowa. He was the tenth child and last child of locally prominent parents. His father, John Baker, had reportedly patented 126 inventions, and his mother, Frances Mary (née Anshulz), was a writer before she married. 
Career.
As inventor.
Although Baker is usually described as having begun his career as a vaudeville performer, he showed early promise as an inventor and a machinist.
Norman Baker invented and, through his Tangley Company, successfully manufactured and sold the Tangley Air Calliope or calliaphone, a variation of the then-common steam organ. This mobile, stentorian contrivance was much in demand for fairgrounds and circuses. Baker also formed numerous local businesses under the Tangley or Baker name. By 1904, Baker became intrigued by travelling shows presenting "mentalists" and other vaudeville performers to the public. He set up his own troupe and, as "Charles Welch," travelled the country with it. A persona of the show, regardless of her actual identity, remained the "mind-reader Pearl Tangley."
First radio station.
In 1924, convinced of the potential of the burgeoning field of radio broadcasting, Baker asked the town of Muscatine to permit a station that would make the town famous across the Midwest. In operation by November 1925, the station received the call sign KTNT, chosen for its explosive connotations but explained as "Know The Naked Truth." It broadcast with 500 watts on 256.3 meters or 1170 kc/s. It used the calliaphone for a sign-on signal, and Baker put his skills as a veteran carnival barker to exquisite use as a radio promoter and announcer. Baker immediately began agitating vociferously against an alleged "cartel" of broadcasters aimed at independent stations. This was before the broadcast spectrum was regulated, and the many new stations interfered frequently. By 1925, Baker was president of American Broadcasters Association, a short-lived lobbying group (to 1927) against "monopolists." In particular, Baker railed against AT&T, which then (thru Western Electric) had a de facto monopoly on radio station transmitters.
Throughout his career, Baker was involved in almost continuous litigation of various kinds, often libel suits against his detractors real or imagined. The lawsuits deterred opponents and ensured a high media profile. He used his station to launch blistering attacks on innumerable commercial, media, and political groups, both locally and nationwide.
Along with various Tangley stores and a drawing school, Baker also published "TNT" magazine and later was the president of the Progressive Publishing Co., publisher of the daily "Midwest Free Press". It was meant to undercut other newspapers which Baker asserted were part of the conspiracy against him. Baker also operated a traveling campaign bus equipped with a calliope, and he was in demand as a speaker for populist causes in the region. For example, he denounced mandated cattle TB tests, water fluoridation, vaccinations and also aluminum cookware, which he claimed caused half of all cancers.
In 1932, Baker organized the short-lived "United Farm Federation of America" and appointed permanent himself honorary member and chairman, drawing a salary, which caused a lawsuit. However, the outfit showed up in important-sounding lobbying to Washington.
First hospital.
Having learned of an alleged cancer cure by Dr. Charles Ozias of Kansas City, and asserting its efficacy despite the expeditious deaths of all five of his test subjects, Baker brought the convicted medical swindler Harry Hoxsey to Muscatine and with him began promoting his own "cure." By April 1930, Norman Baker was operating the Baker Institute in Muscatine, and advertising the clinic on the air. The (very expensive) cure for cancer, and other diseases as requested, consisted of injections of a mix of common substances including corn silk, watermelon seeds, clover, water and carbolic acid. Simultaneously, KTNT denounced licensed doctors as "educated fools" and "cutters" incapable of helping patients. He said MD stood for "More Dough." At that time, the "Journal of the American Medical Association" (known as "JAMA") published an editorial accusing Baker of quackery. Baker denounced the AMA as the "Amateur Meat-cutters Association." The AMA's main antiquackist, Dr. Morris Fishbein, stated that, "Baker has even claimed that the AMA offered him one million dollars for his cancer cure with the intent of forcing it from the market so that patients might be compelled to resort to surgery." In turn, Baker attacked Dr. Fishbein for being Jewish and sued "JAMA" for libel and defamation.
In 1930, Baker reported that three men attacked and fired on the hospital, but police could find no evidence except that Hoxsey, Baker’s associate, had fired all shots. In May 1930, the state of Iowa filed for an injunction against Baker, Hoxsey, and three others, for practicing medicine without a license. In Muscatine, Baker conducted huge Woodstock-live outside gathering with open-air "curing" of patients. These events drew tens of thousands, who were also urged to buy various Baker or Tangley products.
Iowa’s trial of Baker et al. began in September 1930 and gained nationwide attention. Simultaneously, Baker was called before the Federal Radio Commission in Washington, D.C., to defend KTNT's license. Baker and Hoxsey turned on each other over the division of the profits from the hospital, and filed several lawsuits against each other. Reportedly, the institute brought in as much as $100,000 a month, spirited away in suitcases under cover of night, but most went to Baker. Hoxsey was already a nationally known quack, traveling from state to state as the law pursued him.
In 1931, the Iowa Supreme Court sustained the injunction against Baker and his practice. Also, the FRC issued a damning report about KTNT, and after a court battle, the station was finally de-licensed in June 1931. Among cited reasons were venomous, obscene broadcasts against the public interest. Baker returned from Mexican exile in 1937 to serve one day in the Muscatine County jail and pay a $50 contempt of court fine that was appealed unsuccessfully to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Politics.
Norman Baker ran for governor of Iowa on the Farmer-Labor ticket in 1932. He received only a few hundred votes, but the campaign kept him in the news and gave him yet another mouthpiece for his rants against local power structures. Baker’s platform, to the extent it had coherence, followed tenets of prairie populism of the time – i.e., asserted that the common people were being exploited by monopolistic conspiracies in various guises. However, Baker also crusaded against local newspapers and other radio stations that reported on his activities.
In spring 1936, Baker returned to run for the Republican senatorial nomination, and received a few thousand votes.
Second radio station.
In 1933, having been run out of Iowa, Baker obtained Mexican permission to operate XENT-AM in Nuevo Laredo on the Rio Grande. This station was a so-called "border blaster" operating nightly on 1410 Kc/s with a power variously reported at from 50 to 150 kilowatts, and outside the reach of the new U.S. Federal Communications Commission. This reportedly made XENT the most, or second-most, powerful station in North America. The station’s chief objective was to promote Baker’s alleged cancer cure. A Baker hospital operated in Nuevo Laredo, drawing the renewed ire of the AMA and local doctors.
Nightly, XENT broadcast an eclectic mix of decidedly low brow entertainment. While most of this was music in the hillbilly style, a Baker tirade was usually included. Baker's targets were numerous and included anti-semitic and anti-Catholic rants. He was also said to broadcast live while having sex with his mistresses.
Second hospital.
In 1937, in the spa and resort town of Eureka Springs, Arkansas, Baker found a city down on its luck. He bought a resort, the Crescent Hotel, which has previously been a haven for the rich but had fallen into disrepair due to the Depression. Baker converted the hotel into a hospital and treated thousands of desperate patients with his injections. The giant resort hospital opened in November. Reportedly, Baker accumulated hundreds of thousands of dollars which he kept in various safe deposits known only to him and his new accomplice, Thelma Yount. Postal inspectors claimed that the hospital cleared about $500,000 in one year.
Among several libel suits, in 1938, Baker sued RKO for $1.1 million after the March of Times newsreel had portrayed him as a quack.
Federal case and conviction.
A first federal case against Baker in 1937 failed because the Appellate Court did not accept the prosecutorial argument that transporting recordings abroad to broadcast to the United States was breach of the Brinkley Act, a provision included in the Communications Act of 1934.
As Arkansas was unable to close down the Baker Hospital (which had revitalized Eureka Springs's economy), the federal government brought charges against Norman Baker with seven counts of mail fraud. The case, opened in September 1939, was complicated by the fact that Baker had no formal post in the business, exercising control through proxies. However, despite appeals all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, Baker was sentence to four years of jail and $4,000 restitution. In January 1940, the court found Baker’s cure a "pure hoax" and "utterly false" and jailed him pending appeals. Baker served his sentence at the United States Penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas, from May 1941 to July 1944. In January that year, the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals denied him early release.
While Baker and his associate, R.A. Bellows served time at Leavenworth, Bellows sued his fellow inmate for breach of contract, as he said Baker had not paid him the $75,000 of profits to which he was entitled. Bellows (described by the tax court as an "ignorant country barber" until Baker hired him) died shortly thereafter while still incarcerated.
Dispute with Alamo Broadcasting.
During Baker’s emprisonment, XENT went silent and the Crescent Hotel closed. Thelma Yount, appointed head of XENT in Baker’s absence, sold an option for its equipment to the Alamo Broadcasting Co. of Texas, then owned by Elliott Roosevelt, the son of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and his second wife Ruth Josephine. The Roosevelts could not obtain U.S. gear due to the wartime freeze on such uses. However, in April 1944, Alamo applied for and quickly received a highly unusual permission from the FCC to upgrade its KABC station in San Antonio from 250 W to 50 KW (10KW night), using the XENT station’s relocated transmitters and masts. This vastly increased the value of Alamo and Ruth Roosevelt’s Texas State Network.
Mexico had an export ban on radio gear, but it could be overridden in certain circumstances, which turned out to include Alamo’s payment of $35,000 to the Mexican Minister of Communications. On October 31, 1944, Alamo bought XENT for $100,000. However, in February, Norman Baker, intervened with the President of Mexico and was able to partially stop the transaction. In March 1945, XENT was trucked to San Antonio except for the generators and masts. Despite Baker’s injunction, he said: "as the result of well known tricks, artifices and devices common to the Mexican border, said trucks did move across the bridge approximately 30 minutes before" the papers arrived.
Baker filed complaint against Alamo with the FCC in late 1945. Baker asserted that the Roosevelts had engineered the transaction behind his back, and had, through direct access to President Roosevelt, secured the FCC’s permit therefore. Baker and Yount had a falling out, each accusing the other of fraud. The case received some attention due to the newspaper columns of Westbrook Pegler, a fierce enemy of the Roosevelts; Pegler asserted that the FCC had been influenced to make Ruth Roosevelt wealthy at Baker’s expense. The FCC denied Baker’s claim in April 1947. The FCC asserted that Baker had initially approved the transaction, having been told that Alamo could secure a federal pardon for him, which Baker later discovered not to be forthcoming.
Later years and death.
In 1946, Norman Baker attempted to return to "healing" by establishing a research foundation in Muscatine for the purpose, but the state of Iowa refused permission “in the public interest.”
Baker retired in ostentatious comfort to Miami, Florida, where he died on September 10, 1958, of cirrhosis. At the time of his death, he was living aboard a large yacht that was once owned by railroad developer Jay Gould. Baker is buried in Greenwood Cemetery in Muscatine next to his sister.
In his heyday, Baker was known for wearing white suits, purple shirts, and lavender ties, as well as driving an orchid-colored car. (Others (Fowler) have the suits lavender, the shirts orchid, and the ties and vehicles purple; there is agreement that variations of purple were Baker’s trademark. When he bought the Victorian and Neo-Classical Crescent Hotel, he desecrated its interior with these colors). Baker was described as very handsome, with wavy white hair and "hypnotic" eyes; he was said to have been on the greatest showmen that ever lived. Later accounts focus on his physical decay and girth. He was also reported to always have one or more submachine guns within his reach (while not in jail).
Baker published two books about himself and his "crusade for humanity." He had a hagiography written about himself in 1934: "Doctors, Dynamiters, and Gunmen", by Alvin Winston – "the most important book ever written."
Legacy.
Norman Baker was not the only unlicensed "radio doctor" of his era, but is remembered by the medical profession as one of the most ruthless quacks in American history. As with Harry Hoxsey, he always had defenders who believed in his stories about the conspiracies of mainstream medicine to suppress his "cure. He was quoted as saying that if he had his station back, "reap one million dollars out of the suckers in the state."
Baker’s radio case ran parallel to that of Dr. John R. Brinkley’s Kansas broadcaster KFKB, known popularly as the "goat-gland station." Brinkley (and Hoxsey) also moved to Mexico to evade the law. As such, while quacks have always existed, the case is of continuing interest as an early example of the almost unregulated use of new mass-communications technologies.
The Baker cases with the FCC further was an early illustration of the delicate interplay of censorship and regulation, and of the early controversies of international radio spectrum allocations. Because medicine falls under U.S. regulatory oversight, but religion does not, scholars hold that the "radio doctor" phenomenon, when throttled, gave rise to the phenomenon of religious broadcasting; as well, Baker's broadcasting can be seen as a precursor to modern "shock-jock" radio.

Canoe Lake is a lake located in Algonquin Provincial Park in Nipissing District, Ontario, Canada. Canoe Lake is a major access point for many canoeists entering Algonquin Park as well as being home to many cottages.
At km 14.1 of Highway 60 is the short road that leads to the Canoe Lake Access Point for canoe trippers and visitors. The Access Point consists of a large parking area, a Ministry office to obtain tripping permits for the park interior and the regionally well-known Portage Store. The "P-store" as it is often colloquially known, is a well stocked outfitters and canoe equipment rental operation that includes one of the few commercial restaurants available in Algonquin Park. They serve a variety of meals and offer an ice cream counter as well. A gift shop is attached offering souvenirs, t-shirts and other items for sale.
Canoe Lake is also home to the two Taylor-Statten summer camps Camp Ahmek and Camp Wapomeo, located on the eastern shore and a small island group approximately halfway up the lake from the Highway 60 access road.
Influential Canadian artist Tom Thomson disappeared during a canoeing trip on Canoe Lake on July 8, 1917 and his body was discovered in the lake eight days later.

Islington Tunnel

The Islington Tunnel carries the Regent's Canal Arm of the Grand Union Canal for underneath the Angel area of Islington, in London. The two other tunnels on the Regent's Canal are Eyre's tunnel and Maida Hill Tunnel.
History.
Islington Tunnel opened in 1818 and was built by the engineer James Morgan.
The Regent's Canal was authorised by Act of Parliament on 13 July 1812, and a month later James Morgan, who had previously produced plans and sections to support the application, was appointed as Engineer, Architect and Land Surveyor for the scheme. At the time, Morgan had little civil engineering experience, and the company decided to hold a competition for the design of the locks and tunnels, with the entries to be assessed by William Jessop and two other engineers. Although entries hoping to win the 50-guinea (£52.50) were submitted, none were accepted, and in December Morgan became responsible for the whole project.
The company were persistently short of money, as they had only succeeded in raising £254,100 of the estimated cost of £400,000, and as work progressed, it became obvious that more would be needed. The first section from Paddington Basin to Camden was opened in 12 August 1816, and some work had been done on the tunnel, but work stopped, as there was no more money. Another Act of Parliament increased the capital to £600,000, but the company had no success in raising any more. However, a chance meeting between the former chairman, Charles Munro, and the long-winded Committee for the Society for the relieving of the Manufacturing Poor resulted in discussions about government loans funding the project and providing employment for the poor. The Exchequer Bill Loan Commission was set up under the powers of the Poor Employment Act of 1817, with commissioners given powers to award loans to public projects which would provide employment for those without work. The engineer Thomas Telford surveyed the unfinished canal and tunnel on behalf of the Commissioners, and an initial loan of £200,000 was promised, providing that the canal company could raise £100,000 in match funding. This they succeeded in doing, and work resumed in December 1817. The canal opened in its entirety on 1 August 1820.
The tunnelling contract was given to Daniel Pritchard, who had previous experience building tunnels for the Grand Union Canal at Husbands Bosworth and Crick. The first was built between 1811 and 1813, and was long, while the second was built between 1812 and 1814, and was long. They had been completed despite encountering difficult geology along their routes. With the completion of the Islington Tunnel and the nearby Maida Hill Tunnel, he went on to be a specialist tunnelling contractor, completing the Strood Tunnel on the Thames and Medway Canal and the second Harecastle Tunnel on the Trent and Mersey Canal.
As there is no towpath, barges originally had to be legged through the tunnel. In 1826 it was upgraded with a steam tug attached to a continuous chain on the canal bed which would heave barges through. This system remained for over one hundred years until the 1930s, when it was replaced with a diesel engine, which is today no longer in use.
Route.
Owing to the lack of a towpath it is not possible to walk through the tunnel. Walkers wishing to follow the course of the canal can do so above ground by following a trail of waymarkers which have been set into the pavement, connecting the two entrances of the tunnel. From the eastern portal heading towards the west, the trail runs up Duncan Street, then left down Upper Street to the crossing near Angel Underground Station, across Upper Street and up Liverpool Road, turning left into Chapel Market. At the end of Chapel Market it turns right into Penton Street, and finally left into Maygood Street. At the end over Maygood Street it passes through a small residential area, before ultimately ending in Muriel Street, from where the towpath may be accessed.

Moore matrix

In linear algebra, a Moore matrix, introduced by , is a matrix defined over a finite field. When it is a square matrix its determinant is called a Moore determinant (this is unrelated to the Moore determinant of a quaternionic Hermitian matrix). The Moore matrix has successive powers of the Frobenius automorphism applied to the first column, so it is an "m" × "n" matrix
or
for all indices "i" and "j". (Some authors use the transpose of the above matrix.)
The Moore determinant of a square Moore matrix (so "m" = "n") can be expressed as:
where c runs over a complete set of direction vectors, made specific by having the last non-zero entry equal to 1, i.e.
In particular the Moore determinant vanishes if and only if the elements in the left hand column are linearly dependent over the finite field of order "q". So it is analogous to the Wronskian of several functions.
Dickson used the Moore determinant in finding the modular invariants of the general linear group over a finite field.

Deroplatys desiccata

Deroplatys desiccata, known by the common names Giant Dead Leaf Mantis and (less-frequently) Malaysian Dead Leaf Mantis, is a species of praying mantis from Southeast Asia.
Description.
"D. desiccata" takes its common name from its resemblance to dead, leafy vegetation including having a flattened, greatly extended thorax and "intricate leaf patterns" on its wings. This insect varies in color from mottled brown through "pale orangey brown" to a very dark brown that is almost black.
This creature's camouflage is aided by its movements as well as its appearance. When disturbed, it rocks gently as if caught in the breeze. When threatened, it typically falls to the ground and lies motionless. It can also react with a threatening display consisting of "black underwings splayed out, with large eyespots, frightening away unsuspecting predators."
As its common name indicates, "D. desiccata" is larger than other species of Dead Leaf Mantis. Females grow to 75-80mm long. Displaying the sexual dimorphism typical of mantises, males grow only 65-70mm long and are substantially smaller and lighter than females. Females’ prothorax shields end in a sharp pointed curve on each side while the males have a rounder shape. According to one source, males tend to be more "yellowish" than the darker females.
Diet.
Like most mantises, this species has little or no food preferences as long as the prey is the right size, but one source does observe that they "especially love flying insects like moths." 
Range.
"D. desiccata" inhabits scrubland and forests in Borneo, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Sumatra.
In Captivity.
D. desiccata is one of many mantids that can be kept as pets. In captivity, the diet of nymphs often consists of flightless fruit flies, pinhead crickets, and other small insects. Adults are fed crickets, moths, flies, flour worms, and other large insects. In order to survive outside the tropics, D. desiccata requires high levels of heat and humidity similar to that of its native habitat in Southeast Asia, between 75° - 90°F (24° - 32°C), and more than 75% humidity. Males go through 8 molts while females go through 9.

Dobbies Garden Centres

Dobbies Garden Centres is a British chain of garden centres, now owned by Tesco. 
The business was founded in 1865 by James Dobbie, who created a seeds business named Dobbie & Co. After being awarded the Royal Warrant for Gardeners and Nurserymen to the Royal Household, the company expanded into a seed catalogue business, where it built up a customer base of 50,000 over the following century. 
In 1969 the company expanded out of its Scottish base into England, and was floated on AIM in 1987. Up until 1984 Dobbies continued to operate principally as a seed merchant. It was then bought out by David Barnes, managing director of Waterers. Between 1984 and 1989 Dobbies opened five new garden centres in Scotland. 
The company was floated on the Stock Exchange in 1997 and this led to Dobbies expanding their garden centre operations further South into England. In 2008, after a much-publicised court battle with Sir Tom Hunter's West Coast Capital, the owner of competitor Wyevale, the company was fully acquired by Tesco.
Dobbies now operates 32 garden centres and restaurants in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland as well as several large tourist attractions including Plantasia, near Coventry.
On 10 May 2009, Dobbies announced it had made £1 million sales of its Grow Your Own range in that year to date. Grow Your Own allows many of Dobbies’ 10 million-strong customer base to grow salad, vegetables and fruits from home with more than 100,000 tomato plants sold in the last two months alone. For the year to early 2009, turnover was £97 million.
In 2010, Dobbies opened their first outlet in Northern Ireland, and the store, near Lisburn, opened in September 2010.

<doc id="18464982" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18464982" title="Rial (surname)">
Rial (surname)

Rial is a surname, family name, or last name (i.e., apellido in Spanish). The surname "Rial" is a very old family name and people with that last name can be found in small numbers in several countries of the western world that use the English language (e.g., Scotland, Canada, The United States) and found in significant numbers in Spanish and Portuguese speaking countries, namely, Spain, several Caribbean countries, and in several North and South American countries. The surname "Rial" is correctly pronounced in modern English like the English words "dial" and "vial" with the accent-stress placed on the first vowel of the diphthong "ia" (i.e., the letter "i"). The surname is correctly pronounced in modern Spanish like the Spanish words "dial" and "vial" where the accent-stress is placed on the final vowel of the diphthong (i.e., the letter "a") which proceeds the final consonant (i.e., the Spanish letter "ele").
Strong speculation indicates that the surname Rial as described here had its origin in the Celtic region of the Iberian Peninsula during the Roman occupation of Spain which occurred from about 140 BCE until about 400 CE. This Celtic region which is now called Galicia is located in the northwestern territory of European Spain and it was formerly named Gallaecia by the Roman occupiers. Galicia is one of the four Autonomous Regions in Spain and Spanish Celtic roots extend beyond Galicia into the western end of The Asturias (one of the four Autonomous Regions) and also into northeastern Portugal.  
The Rias of Galicia.
In the northwestern coastal regions of the Iberian Peninsula which face the Atlantic Ocean on the west and northwest and the Sea of Cantábrica on the north are many deep, navigable channels called "rias". A Ria (ría in Spanish) is an estuary, often with deep water that provides access to the high seas from inland areas on the coasts of The Asturias, Galicia, and Portugal. These ria regions have been used or occupied for many centuries and from these rias, sailors and fishermen can enter the Atlantic coastal waters. The locations of all the rias on the Iberian Peninsula can be seen on a modern map of Spain and Portugal.
Derivation of the surname "Rial" in Galicia.
The coastal regions of Galicia have always been used by seafaring people and those regions provide great quantities of seafood for the country and for export. From ancient times, the people who worked or went to sea from these rias were called "the people of the ria" or "the ria people", and eventually those people were designated by the single word "rial" which evolved into the permanent family surname of Rial. Thus, the "Rial's" were people who always worked in or were associated with rias. In Galicia, there were and still are several versions of the use of the word ria as applied to the "ria people". One is "los de la ría" (Spanish for the people of the ria) or "os da ria" (Galician for the people of the ria). Another common use of the surname Rial is "O Rial" (meaning "The Rial" in Galician) which is used to designate the place of the Rial parish or Rial clan. From the foregoing, it is strongly believed that the surname Rial has a Celtic origin that came into existence in the Celtic Region of Galicia.
General distribution of the surname "Rial" in the Western World.
Near the Atlantic coastal area of Galicia between Galicia's capitol of Santiago de Compostela in the north to its southern border with Portugal can be found at least three villages named "Rial" on current maps (ref. 3, op cit) and at least one village named O Rial. Also, the surname Rial can be found of the official list of recognized Galician surnames at Xenealoxia. The distribution of the Rial surname (apellido) in Galicia and in other parts of Spain can also be further found in Xenealoxia (op cit) under "Rial" which indicated approximately 1360 "Rial's" listed in Galicia out of approximately 3850 "Rial's" listed for all of Spain.
Today, the greatest concentration of people with the surname Rial in Spain is found in Galicia in or near the city of Pontevedra which is very near the Ria de Vigo. In 2007, approximately 700 people with the surname Rial could be found in the telephone listings in the white pages of Pontevedra, Galicia. Today, large numbers of former Galicians and their families can be found near the Rio de la Plata region of Argentina and Uruguay with smaller numbers in Puerto Rico, Cuba, Mexico, and Brazil, and very few in the countries of Great Britain, The United States, and Canada. There are so many Galician-related people living in the Rio Plata region that ethnic European people are often referred to as Gallegos (meaning Galicians in Spanish), whether their roots are Galician or not.
Rial in the United States of America.
The United States was an uncommon destination for early emigrants from Galicia because most Galician emigrants emigrated to regions where the Galician or Spanish languages and cultures were well established, such as the Rio Plata region of Argentina. 
The surname Rial is uncommon in the United States.

828 Naval Air Squadron

828 Naval Air Squadron was a Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm carrier based squadron formed in September 1940 as a torpedo spotter reconnaissance squadron. It operated in a number of the theatres of the Second World War, carrying out a number of attacks on enemy targets including the "Tirpitz" in Norway.
History.
Malta and the Mediterranean.
The squadron was initially equipped with Fairey Albacores on its formation at RNAS Lee-on-Solent, and then moved to Scotland to operate anti-submarine patrols with RAF Coastal Command. They embarked aboard in July 1941 and carried out an attack on Kirkenes, Norway. Five of the squadron's aircraft were lost in the attack. The squadron was then regrouped and sailed to Gibraltar in August aboard . They were then transported to Hal Far, Malta aboard HMS "Ark Royal". From there the squadron attacked enemy shipping attempting to transport supplies to the Axis forces in Libya. In March 1942 they and 830 Naval Air Squadron formed the Naval Air Squadron Malta, which went on to attack enemy warships and convoys operating in the Mediterranean. Re-supply problems, partially alleviated by the Malta Convoys led to the number of operational aircraft being reduced to just two. In December 1942 the remnants of 826 and 830 squadrons were absorbed.
828 and 821 Naval Air Squadrons attacked shipping in May 1943, and provided flare illumination for naval bombardments of Pantellaria. In July, from Hal Far on Malta, 828 squadron's Albacores (torpedo spotter reconnaissance) supported the Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky). 828 then moved to Monastir in Tunisia, where they disbanded in September 1943. Together 828 and 830 squadrons had sunk 30 enemy ships and damaged another 50.
"Tirpitz" and the Far East.
828 Squadron was re-formed as a torpedo bomber reconnaissance squadron in March 1944. Equipped with 12 Barracuda IIs they joined the 2nd Naval Torpedo Bomber Reconnaissance Wing and joined the Home Fleet aboard in August that year. They briefly transferred to in August 1944 and carried out attacks on the German battleship "Tirpitz" as part of Operation Goodwood. They were briefly at RNAS Hatston, before re-boarding HMS "Implacable" and carrying out attacks on enemy shipping off the Norwegian coast in October. 828 Squadron was re-equipped with 21 Avenger Is and IIs in January 1945, and then joined HMS "Trumpeter". They were back aboard HMS "Implacable" by March 1945, and sailed with her to Ceylon, subsequently disembarking at Trincomalee in April 1945. 828 Squadron then joined the 8th Carrier Air Group and carried out attacks on Truk and the Japanese mainland. After the Japanese surrender the squadron returned to Nowra on 25 August 1945, and remained there until May 1946.

<doc id="18465116" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18465116" title="Houdoe">
Houdoe

Houdoe (pronounce: howdo) is a Brabantic greeting which originated in the Dutch province North Brabant and is widely used there, but has spread to Limburg, the south of Gelderland and even to parts of Belgium. It is a misunderstanding that it has been derived from the English language short sentence "How do you do?". Houdoe has been derived from the Brabantic sentence "Houd oe eige goed." This sentence can be translated to "Take care of yourself", which is often shortened to "Take care". Thus "Houdoe" is the Dutch equivalent of "Take care" and as such is used in the same manner, i.e. given when saying goodbye to someone to wish them well.
In parts of North Brabant people don't pronounce the H, there people say "oudoe" instead of "houdoe". This phenomenon is called H deletion and is most prevalent in the western part of North Brabant.
There are a few theories that claim an alternative origin of the word "houdoe". The first one being that the word comes from the French word "adieu". A lot of French words, from the time that the Netherlands were ruled by France, have remained in the Brabantic dialect, thus it is possible that the French word A-Dieu has bastardized over time to form the greeting (h)oudoe. The other possible theory that explains the origins of the word houdoe is that it is a remnant of time of the Spanish Netherlands. In this case it would be the Spanish greeting "adíos" that might have transformed to (h)oudoe.
The word "houdoe" also bears resemblance to the Swedish greeting to say goodbye: "hej då" (pronounced: hee doh).
There are a few (mostly local) variations to "houdoe", like "hoedoe" and "haje", but "houdoe" is the prominently used one. In Antwerp the full term "oudoe go" (from "hou je goed") is frequently used, often followed by "en tot ziens" (from "en tot weerziens", which roughly means "and until I see you again").
In 2005 the newspapers Brabants Dagblad, Eindhovens Dagblad and BN/De Stem organized an election for the most beautiful Brabantic word, which was won by the word Houdoe.

Al-Ramadin

Al-Ramadin () is a Palestinian village located 24 kilometers southwest of Hebron and includes the smaller village of 'Arab al-Fureijat to the southeast. The village is part the Hebron Governorate in the southern West Bank. According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, the two villages had a combined population of 3,853 in 2007. The principal families are al-Sho'ur, al-Zagharna, al-Fureijat, al-Daraghmeh, al-Raghmat, al-Mlihat and al—Masamra. 
Al-Ramadin and 'Arab al-Fureijat were established by Bedouins who fled their traditional homeland in the vicinity of Beersheba in the Negev for the suburbs of ad-Dhahiriya. The name "al-Ramadin" derives from "Ramadan," the patriarch of the main Bedouin tribe that founded the modern village after the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. A nine-member village council was appointed by the Palestinian Authority to administer al-Ramadin and Arab al-Fureijat in 1997. 
There are three active mosques in al-Ramadin, as well as three historic Christian edifices including the al-Fadi Monastery and al-Asela Church. The primary health care facilities for the village are designated by the Ministry of Health as level 2.

Louis-Adolphe Paquet

Louis-Adolphe Paquet (; also Pâquet; August 4, 1859–February 4, 1942) was an influential French-Canadian theologian from the late 19th early 20th century, and a major North American proponent and actor in the rebirth of Neo-Scholasticism. Although nowhere as politically influential as his uncle Benjamin Pâquet had been, he was well respected and his opinion helped shape the doctrines and policies of the Canadian church in the early 20th century.
Biography.
Joseph-Louis-Adolphe Paquet was born on August 4, 1859 to a farmer couple, Adolphe Pâquet and Éléonore Demers, on the family domain in Saint-Nicolas, on the southern shore of the Saint Lawrence River opposite Quebec City. He was their eldest son, though not their eldest child, which was his sister Joséphine. Adolphe Pâquet would later be mayor of the municipality in the 1870s and 1880s. Louis-Adolphe came from an influential family: two of his uncles, Benjamin and Louis-Honoré Pâquet, were notable churchmen, and one of his cousins, Étienne-Théodore, would later be elected to the provincial legislature.
Paquet studied in nearby Saint-Louis-de-Lotbinière, then at the Séminaire de Québec before continuing his theological studies at the Pontifical Urbaniana University (then the University of the Propaganda), where he presented his D.D. thesis before Pope Leo XIII in June 1883. He had been ordained earlier that year, on March 24. Upon his return, he became a teacher of theology at Université Laval, an appointment he would keep until his death in 1942, one of the longest careers in the department. He would also along the course of his career, be dean of the Faculty of Theology (1904–1938) and Director of the Quebec Seminary (1902). He was made apostolic protonotary in 1902 and member of the Royal Society of Canada in 1903.
Encouraged by the pope to promote Neo-Scholasticism in Canada, he became one of the foremost proponents of the new philosophy, writing extensively on it and founding in 1930 the Académie canadienne Saint-Thomas d'Aquin, a philosophical organization devoted to the study of Saint Thomas Aquinas' writings. A prolific writer, he published in a number of venues from episcopal publications to newspapers, when he was not outright part of the direction board. As official interpreter of Papal pronouncements on questions interesting French Canada, he became very influential, pronouncing opinions on issues such as the Manitoba Schools Question (his first public intervention) and Ontario's Regulation 17. His 1902 speech, "La Vocation de la race française en Amérique" ("The Vocation of the French Race in America"), shaped French-Canadian nationalism around a missionary office for decades. Although the idea was already present in the writings of others, it was this speech that memorably crystallized it as a formal ideology and would be later cited as the text to refer to on the issue. In the same decade, he was an envoy of Louis-Nazaire Bégin to Rome, in 1906, where he would be an important element in the latter's rise to cardinalate. In 1909, he was charged with rewriting the "schemata" (decree proposals) resulting from the first Plenary Council of the Canadian Church.
Paquet's "Le Droit public de l'Église" codified a lot of the French-Canadian catholic doctrine of the time, to the point that one commenter, Dominican Ceslas-Marie Forest, the dean of Université de Montréal's faculty of philosophy, described it as "Sacro-saint", "untouchable", "integrist" and "reactionary"; amongst other things, it was the source of the major arguments against mandatory public education (which Paquet characterized as a Freemason plot). In 1907, he was amongst the founders of "L'Action Catholique", a catholic newspaper that would reach its highest points under Maurice Duplessis. In its page, he would notably condemn Bolshevism, characterizing it as little more than anarchism. Although he voiced strong opinions (but in fact mostly echoed the prevalent conservative views of the French-Canadian clergy and elites of his time), Paquet had—unlike his uncle Benjamin—fairly little direct involvement in the religious politics of the period, a state that might have changed had the plan to counteract the Irish Catholic influence in Rome succeeded. The idea was to install him permanently in Rome with the Jesuits and have him named consultant to a few congregations, where he could acquire episcopal prestige. It is not known why that plan was never acted upon.
Paquet's philosophy was characterised by some of the strictest ultramontane principles of the times (hence Forest's description of his "Droit"). He was one of the most vocal and noticeable opponent of women's voting rights in the 20s and 30s, and is even credited by some as a major agent of the strong social conservatism that would remain prevalent until the 50s; his influence nonetheless declined as public interest moved away from the religious to the social aspect of socio-religious issue, and his writing is considered of little interest in modern theological or social discussions beyond historic or historiographic considerations. A large collection of his papers, primarily from his career at Laval, are part of the Quebec Seminary archives. The Pâquet family domain is the major element of a local historic district, the Saint-Nicolas Heritage Site, as well as a historic monument.

Deroplatys lobata

Deroplatys lobata, common name Malaysian Dead Leaf Mantis or Dead Leaf Mantis, is a species of praying mantis that inhabits Thailand, Java, Borneo, Indonesia, Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula. 
Habitat.
"Deroplatys lobata" live on the ground around dead leaves and bushes in damp areas, tropical rainforests. 
Description.
This mantis mimics dead leaves. Females are about 65 to 70mm in length and males are about 45mm in length. 1st instar nymphs are up to 15mm in length and 2nd instar nymphs are about 21mm in length when their abdomens are expanded. Their coloring ranges from dark gray to light mottled gray. They also possess a broad prothorax that looks ripped and crumpled like a leaf. Females have a wider shaped shield than males as early as the 4th instar stage. Males have a slender body shape and a diamond shape shield.
Sexual Dimorphism.
Due to the sexual dimorphism typical of mantises, the male is much smaller. Adult females are about 65mm to 70mm in length while adult males are about 45mm in length. 3rd instar nymphs cannot be sexed by counting the segments on the bottom of the abdomen because unlike most praying mantises 8 segments are visible in all of the 3rd instar nymphs and this is also true when they are in the 1st, 2nd instar stage and their leaf shapes look just about the same at those stages. 4th instar nymph and up their leaf shapes look different from each other and get more different from each other with each molt. 6 segments are seen on females while 8 segments are seen on males at the 4th instar and up. 
In Captivity.
"Deroplatys lobata" are commonly kept in captivity. Three other species in the genus "Deroplatys" are kept in captivity, "Deroplatys desiccata", "Deroplatys truncata" and "Deroplatys trigonodera". 
Behavior.
Nymphs are skittish but at the 1st instar they are calm and do not seem to be able to move fast (run) like most praying mantises can and do. At the 2nd instar they start to get more skittish. Nymphs are known to play dead. If startled sometimes nymphs will jump up into the air and fall face up or down to the ground with their legs pulled in. Adults and nymphs are known to do a threat pose when startled. "Deroplatys lobata" are aggressive toward each other and they will sometimes eat each other so they should not be kept together in captivity if there is not a lot of room. Younger nymphs are not very aggressive toward each other so can be kept together and there will rarely be any cannibalism if they are fed enough. From the 1st instar to adult they often threaten each other by doing a threat pose and striking and missing to scare off the other mantis if it is approaching or doing anything threatening. After laying the ootheca the female sits on her ootheca to defend it. 
Care.
These mantids need a very humid environment. Misting them heavily directly onto the mantis every evening works well. To keep the humidity up substrate like moist sphagnum moss can be added but is not needed. "Deroplatys lobata" do well when the temperature is not below 75 degrees fahrenheit to 95 degrees fahrenheit. Sudden changes in temperature may kill the mantis. If kept warmer praying mantises will grow faster and live a shorter life but if kept cooler then they grow slower and live a longer life. When kept warmer it speeds up their metabolism and when kept cooler it slows down their metabolism and this is true for all praying mantises. To molt "Deroplatys lobata" need a rough superior support, like a piece of rough bark or a rough stick (not a slippery stick because the nymph cannot get a good grip and will fall while molting) at a diagonal angle or attached to the top of the container so that the nymph will hang upside down which is needed to molt. Their cage should be well ventilated with twigs for the mantis to perch on. They don't require much room as they are not active predators, but they do need room to molt. A good sized container for "Deroplatys lobata" in width and height is usually 3x the length of the mantis, but for young nymphs (1st to 2nd instar nymphs) a 16oz container is good. During molting, it is vital that you do not disturb them. Also, make sure that the humidity is at a safe level because too much humidity can hinder the insect from drying out correctly and it might end up with bent legs and crippled arms. 
Feeding.
They will eat just about anything that is the right size. Start feeding the nymphs 1 or 2 days after hatching. 1st instar nymphs get up to 15mm long when their abdomens are expanded so they can tackle and eat large prey. 1st instar nymphs can eat "Drosophila melanogaster" fruit flies and "Drosophila hydei" fruit flies and House Flies but they could eat things much larger like baby roaches and baby crickets and not too large moths, et cetera, but Blue Bottle Flies are a bit too large. As they get larger, feed them the right sized prey items. At the 1st instar the nymphs are very easy to hand feed unlike most praying mantises.
Breeding.
Mating this large species is not easy. They usually get too stressed up when kept in a small cage, and if the temperature is too low, then they ignore each other completely. Mate the female as early as 4 weeks after molting to adult. Mate the male as early as 2 weeks. Females molt 8 times and males molt 6 times to become adult. About 3-4 weeks after mating, the female will make her first ootheca. This species can lay around 4-6 oothecae with a period of 4-6 weeks in between each ootheca. After 6 weeks of incubation at 30 C (86 F) and 70-80% humidity. Normal oothecae usually hatch out about 50 large nymphs and "Deroplatys lobata" Oothecae are usually about 35 to 40mm in length.

José María Rivarola Matto

Jose Maria Rivarola Matto was born in Asunción, Paraguay, 18 December 1917, son of Octaviano Rivarola Bogarín and Victoriana Matto.
He died in Asunción, Paraguay on 13 September 1998.
First steps.
Dramatist, narrator, essayist and journalist, he was an occasional collaborator of diverse Paraguayan magazines and journals.
Childhood and youth.
He spent his childhood at the San José High School of Asunción during the time of lessons, and spent in his parents' country houses and manufactures located in Rosario, San Pedro Department, during the holidays.
The house of the Rivarola Matto family was located at the Wilson Street (Eligio Ayala Street nowadays) near Antequera, in front of the San Roque's Church square. He used to go there the times that he sneaked out from the barracks so he could sleep comfortably and then subtly get in again at the morning. Because of that prank he was sent at his 16 years old to the Chaco during the war against Bolivia as a private.
He survived the war after a year of dysentery and malaria, curing himself chewing leaves of cocaine introduced by the Bolivian prisoners. But his survival wasn't just to his courage, fortitude or luck, but to his writing skills. His comrades tried to not expose too much to this guy that wrote for them passionate love letters to their girlfriends.
He studied laws, obtained the title of lawyer, but never exercising that profession.
He was exiled to the Argentina during the civil war between 1946 and 1947. In Posadas he acquired a ship that he used to carry packages up the river to the now inexistent Salto del Guairá, and traveled back in boats to Rosario. Being in Posadas, in 1950, he writes "Follaje en los ojos", a novel about the confined of Alto Paraná. This novel was published in 1952 at Buenos Aires, Argentina.
He returned to Asunción in 1950, during the dictatorship, and was arrested countless times for freely exposing his ideas in every journal that wanted to publish them. He was also distributor of the Argentine journal Clarín in Asunción, a journal from where could be obtained objective information about the local political situation.
Career.
An outstanding figure of our literature, also was notable in philosophy. He was dramatist, narrator, essayist and journalist.
He begins as a play writer in 1952 with the play "El Sectario" about the aberration of the faith in the human spirit. Follows that one three highly awarded plays: "El fin de Chipí González", "La Cabra y la Flor" and "Encrucijada del Espíritu Santo". The first one is about the problem of the freedom, the second one is about the beauty and the justice, and the third one is about the drama if the Jesuit utopia.
In 1930 is published a compilation of articles published in journals entitled "Belle Epoque and other works" with a strong humorist accent. He also wrote other short stories in 1958 such as "Degradation", that receives a mention in the 5th Short Stories Contest of the "La Tribuna" journal in spite that it wasn't accord with the contest rules. As a story it was too long, as a novel it was too short, and the subject was very strong for that times.
In his "History of the Paraguayan Literature", Hugo Rodríguez-Alcalá writes about the dramatic work of this author: "Rivarola Matto knows how to create the characters and the ambient, and combines skillfully the serious and the hilarious. He's maybe the only outstanding Paraguayan writer with a fine sense of humor. His art is more effective in the presentation of the dramatic conflicts than on its conclusion".
Work.
In narrative is author of a novel, "Follaje en los ojos", from 1952, in which he shows the anguished life in the herbal manufactures of the Alto Paraná Department. Also has a collection of stories entitled "Mi pariente el cocotero", from 1974.
In his play production the most outstanding are: "El fin de Chipí González", comedy first performed in 1956, published in 1965 and adapted for radio-theater in Montevideo, distributed in discs for all América; "La Cabra y la Flor", awarded in 1965 in the Theater Contest of Radio Cáritas; "La encrucijada del Espíritu Santo" in 1972, awarded again for the Radio Cáritas. He also published in 1983 an anthology that joins three of his plays: "El fin de Chipí González", "La Cabra y la Flor" and "Su Señoría Tiene Miedo", that makes a strong critic to the Judicial State and only could be represented many years after the fall of the dictatorship of the General Alfredo Stroessner.
He published essays such as: "Hipótesis física del tiempo" (1987), "Reflexión sobre la violencia" (1987), "La no existencia física del tiempo" (1994) and an interesting and imaginative series of reflections given to know in the book "Belle Epoque and other works".
In his theatrical work exist a fundamental precedent in the Paraguayan contemporary theater: Encrucijada del Espíritu Santo (The Crossroads of the Holy Spirit), edited in 1972. Its the first dramatic close-up to the Jesuit missions. The main character is José, a young priest that appears old at the end of the story, expressing the continuous turns of the argument.
The author stated that it was a great synthesis deployed in the 17th and 18th Century in the Jesuit misions, although he didn't gave more details about the time lapse. The narrative is lineal, starting from the evangelization of the natives to the banishment of the order in 1767, and the main consequence of that: the voluntary return of the natives to the wild because of the greed of the Paulists or Bandeirantes and the abandon of the Spanish colonial government.
This work is actually a flashback. Starts with a bard describing the resumed story, finishing with "Here is the answer", demonstrating that the play tries to answer questions that came from the possible historical interest of the viewer. Another aspect of the play is that concedes a notable human character to the priests, accentuated for the fall of José motivated by the love and sexual attraction to the native that he baptized as María, and to fight spiritual power with political power.
His family.
He married with María Emilia Mernes Recalde, and had 6 kids with her. Miguel Angel, José, Raúl, Oscar, Manuel and Carmen Lidia.

Joe Tulip

Joe Tulip was an English footballer best known for his time at Dumfries club Queen of the South.
Early years.
The left-winger from Mickley in Northumberland joined Queens from Crawcrook Albion in 1933. The previous season Tulip had a brief spell at Blackburn Rovers.
Queen of the South.
Joe Tulip was one of the first Englishmen to play in the Scottish League. His discovery was quite unique as he was spied by a Dumfries policeman on holiday in the north of England who then recommended him to the Queens directors. He was snapped up and made his debut on 11 November 1933 against Rangers at Palmerston. This was Queens first season in Scotland's top division following promotion the previous season with Hibs.
As a player Joe Tulip was part of two landmark events in the history of Queen of the South:-
After scoring the only goal against Celtic at Celtic Park on December 23, 1933 the billboards for the Glasgow evening press ran with the headline, "Tulip tiptoes through the shamrocks". The result gave Queens a double victory that season over Celtic as they did also against Hibs and Hearts.
Among the others at Queens at the same time as Tulip were fellow players Willie Savage, Willie Culbert, Willie Ferguson and Irish international Laurie Cumming. The managers he played under included George McLachlan and Ferguson as McLachlan's successor.
Joe Tulip made 129 appearances scoring 43 goals, some from the penalty spot. All of Tulip's time at Queens was spent in the top division (excluding war time interruption Queens spent every season in the top division following their promotion until 1959 except one).
Later years.
Joe Tulip died in 1979
he began his career with Prudhoe West End in the Prudhoe and District League, in 1930 West End faced Corbridge United who's centre half was Alan Brown then only 15 years old later with Huddersfield, Burnley, Notts County and Sunderland and Sheffield Wednesday manager.

White Stag Leadership Development Program

The White Stag Leadership Development Program is a California-based non-profit that sponsors leadership development activities for youth 11-18. The teen youth staff of the program develop and produce several week-long leadership summer camps every year to several hundred youth from around the world. The outdoors program relies on hands-on learning methods to develop leadership competencies in youth.
Founded on the Monterey Peninsula, California, in 1958 by Dr. Béla H. Bánáthy, it traces its history to the 1933 World Jamboree in Gödöllő, Hungary, which took as its emblem the white stag of Hungarian mythology. Four boys who did not know each other attended the Jamboree and met in the 1950s to lead the White Stag program. Founder Béla H. Bánáthy, a junior officer in the Hungarian Army during World War II, served on the National Council of the Hungarian Scout Association and became the voluntary national director for youth leadership development. At the end of the war, he narrowly escaped Soviet capture and likely execution. After considerable personal trials he arrived in June 1951 in Monterey, California to teach at the Army Language School.
Bánáthy became the Monterey Bay Area Council Training Chairman and developed an experimental program to train Scouts in leadership skills. He collaborated with research psychologist Paul Hood, who was leader of Task NCO (Non-Commissioned Officer), a research project by the U.S. Army that sought to identify the essential leadership skills of non-commissioned leaders. As part of his Master's thesis, Bánáthy identified eleven specific leadership competencies that he taught in the program's summer camp. His efforts rapidly gained the attention of the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America. They conducted extensive research that validated Bánáthy's leadership model and developed its own version for nationwide use. They introduced the leadership competencies during the 1970s into both the adult Wood Badge program and youth-focused National Youth Leadership Training. These two programs had originally focused primarily on teaching Scoutcraft skills and the Patrol Method. The change to teaching leadership was a marked cultural shift for how both adults and youth were trained in the skills of Scouting.
The White Stag leadership competencies remained a key part of both training programs from 1974 through 2003. The program, which observed its 50th anniversary in 2008, has served over 21,000 youth since its inception.
Youth ready to learn.
In his master's thesis, Bánáthy established his reasoning for focusing on developing leadership skills in youth rather than adults. He wrote that adults in leadership development experiences often have "deeply and rigidly established patterns which are difficult to change." He felt leadership development needs to start early in life, when an opportunity exists to give individuals long-term exposure to leadership behavior. Bánáthy formulated the White Stag program to address the needs of youth from 11 to 17 years of age. He did this when defining leadership as a learnable skill was still in its infancy.
Youth need leadership development.
A number of researchers have identified needs of youth for specific kinds of formative experiences. In one study, Ferber, Pittman, and Marshall described five developmental priorities for youth. These were "learning" (developing positive basic and applied academic attitudes, skills, and behaviors), "thriving" (developing physically healthy attitudes, skills, and behaviors), "connecting" (developing positive social attitudes, skills, and behaviors), "working" (developing positive vocational attitudes, skills, and behaviors), and "leading" (developing positive civic attitudes, skills, and behaviors).
Educators report that successful programs utilize "positive and sustained relations with a caring adult, mentoring in life skills and opportunities to use newly learned skills." Other studies have identified areas that help youth acquire the attitudes, skills, and knowledge required to be effective in society. These areas are strong relationships with adults; training in mediation, conflict resolution, team dynamics, and project management; new roles and responsibilities based on experiences and resources that provide opportunity for growth, teamwork and peer networking; and opportunities to practice communication, negotiation, and refusal skills.
Youth-led program.
The White Stag Leadership Development Program's methods address all of the areas the studies identified. Mentored and coached by adults, the youth staff develop, plan and implement the week-long summer camp programs. They develop skills in research, writing, planning, and evaluation. Using the outdoors, they practice learning activities, games, and outdoor skills required to live in a camping environment. They learn to get along with and other counsel youth from different backgrounds. They study eleven specific skills of leadership and practice presenting them to one another before summer camp, when they present these learning sessions to the participants. The youth, led and mentored by adults, work together with other youth they have never met, forming new relationships and learning to connect and cooperate. They learn basic group membership skills required in work life, like communication and planning, and plan and implement their leadership skills in their home community. They learn and practice problem-solving and counseling skills, how groups form and grow, and planning skills. They learn and rehearse various kinds of communications skills, how to represent their group—both with and without the group's input—and how to work effectively with others.
Program phases and levels.
Based on Béla Bánáthy's original work, the program is still organized into three phases, each consisting of a candidate, youth staff, and an adult staff level. This structure allows youth to develop their leadership skills over several years through gradually more intense and more advanced levels of instruction. Each level is tailored to the needs of youth at specific ages and maturity levels.
The youth staff develop each summer camp's program during the preceding nine months in a series of leadership development training and planning events. They are ultimately responsible for the entire leadership program's content.
Program Aims.
The program has four primary aims that are closely aligned with the aims of the Boy Scouts of America with the addition of leadership development. The program focuses on "character development", which it defines as encouraging people to do what is right, no matter what, and to serve themselves and others. Its second aim is "personal fitness", and in its programs it encourages individuals to accept physical and mental challenges, to surpass their own expectations, expand their knowledge, skills and abilities, and strive for continuous personal improvement. Their third aim is "citizenship training", in which it helps individuals to develop a positive attitude, influence those around them, join in and shape their community. The paramount aim however is "leadership development", in which it inspires individuals to engage life as an ongoing adventure, to challenge themselves, and to lead others to pursue excellence.
Camp locations.
In central California, the non-profit White Stag Leadership Development Academy sponsors a Learning for Life group, a Venturing crew, and a Boy Scout troop in the Monterey Bay Area Council and the San Francisco Bay Area Council. These youth plan and put on a program each summer in Central California. In 2009 they offered for the first time two camps, one at Camp Tamarancho in Marin County in Northern California, and the second at Camp Lindblad in the Santa Cruz Mountains. They have continued to offer two weeks of summer camp and in 2012 based the program at a site in the Santa Lucia Range near Arroyo Seco. Youth staff participants are registered as members of the Boy Scouts or Venturing programs in the Silicon Valley Monterey Bay Council and the Alameda Council.
Both programs adhere to the Youth Protection Standards of the Boy Scouts of America, including background checks of all adult leaders. The Monterey-based program has drawn participants from overseas, including France, China, Martinique, and Taiwan.
Leadership competencies.
In his research for his master's thesis, Bánáthy identified 80 characteristics of leadership. He condensed these into eleven specific leadership competencies which he then proposed be taught in a systematic process using six developmental levels tailored to the various needs of youth as they mature. The White Stag leadership competencies are organized into three groups. The competencies are taught based on the members' and the overall group's readiness and maturity.
Four-stage learning approach.
The group writes down both general goals and very specific, measurable objectives each year that describe leadership in behavioral terms. When engaging learners in leadership development learning activities, the youth staff implement a four-phase approach called "Manager of Learning".
The first step requires the participant to practice the skill without preparation. The simulation is made as real and practical as possible within the limitations of the training environment. Both the participant and the instructor gain through this "Guided Discovery" an assessment of the learner's current knowledge, skills, attitudes relevant to the learning task.
The second step is a "Teach/Learn" session where the instructor begins to present information based on what the participants don't already know. This is usually prefixed with a written statement describing in behavioral terms the objectives that the participant will complete during the session. The instructor may utilize more advanced members to help less skilled members. The instructor often tries to elicit information from the participants' experience by asking questions.
Once the Teach/Learn is complete, the third step allows participants an opportunity in an "Application" to practice their newly acquired skills. This may or may not be an experience like the Guided Discovery.
The final step is an "Evaluation" discussion, during which the participants not only self-assess whether they achieved the stated learning objectives, but to give feedback to the instructor about their success in presenting the information.
Developing group members.
The first three competencies are essential to forming the group's ability to organize itself and become ready for action.
"Getting and Giving Information" teaches participants about different types of communication and how communication helps establish the group. They learn how to get, store, and retrieve information. Individuals practice communicating to both help get the job done and keep the group together.
"Understanding Group Needs and Characteristics" helps individuals build group morale and unity. They learn about values, norms, needs, and characteristics.
"Knowing and Understanding Group Resources" helps learners to use resources to improve group togetherness, to learn about different kinds of resources, and how as a leader can use the diversity of group members' skills and abilities to help the group succeed. They learn about how resources affect getting the job done and keeping the group together.
Growing group capability.
The second group of leadership competencies help the group to develop and implement a plan.
"Controlling the Group" helps individuals to learn how their behavior affects others. Individuals learn the difference between external control of the group and personal control of their own behavior. They learn that controlling the group is something that everyone in the group contributes to. They learn about different techniques to influence group success. They gain skills in balancing the group's versus the individual's needs.
"Counseling" helps individuals to define key counseling ideas, learn simple counseling methods, and identify when simple counseling is appropriate.
"Setting the Example" helps participants identify what it means to set a good example, why setting an example is important, and describe ways a leader can set a good example.
"Planning" provides learners a chance to learn about problem-solving and its importance to a leader. They learn problem-solving and planning methods and how planning contributes to accomplishing the task and to group success.
"Evaluation" enables the learner to use evaluation improve group focus and get the job done. They learn to balance getting the job done and helping the group, and learn to continually assess their level of success.
Accomplish the task.
The last group of leadership competencies helps individuals to grow the organization.
"Sharing Leadership" helps participants learn that leadership is something that is shared by all group members depending on the situation and group member's abilities. They learn about what kinds of things affect the leader and the group, and what style of leadership is appropriate. They learn to select a style of leadership based on the job and the group situation.
"Representing the Group" is a way for participants to learn about how groups communicate and how to represent one group to another. They learn how to accurately represent their group to another.
"Manager of Learning" is a four-step technique for instructing others. Participants learn how to develop effective learning techniques. for effectively communicating information; emphasize the learner in the learning process.
Program values.
One of the most important is "outdoor learning". Program leaders believe that the outdoors environment provides a context for learning that is physically demanding and entirely different from that experienced every day at home and in school. The outdoors stimulates new ways of thinking and approaching both task- and group-related problems. As participants learn they can exceed what they perceive to be their physical limits, they find their mental capacity also grows. White Stag uses the physical environment to tire the individual and open their minds to new ways of thinking. The program does nothing indoors that can be done outdoors, and encourages physical fitness through outdoor activities. Using the outdoors avoids the negative association of a standard classroom environment.
In addition, the program utilizes outdoor camping skills to provide opportunities to practice leadership skills. One of the very first challenges a leader-in-training faces is to plan how to set up of their camp and cook their meals. They learn how to analyze the task, how to plan the task and organize the group, how to use all of the groups' resources, how to implement their plan, and how to evaluate and correct.
The program teaches participants to cultivate an "evaluation attitude", or a predisposition to continually seek improvement. Growth as a leader is dependent on his ability to assess his current skill level and to accept the necessity for change. The leader can only attain his goals if he continuously works to analyze his movement towards achieving his goals and objectives.
Differentiating White Stag from any other leadership program for youth is its "spirit and traditions", including campfires, ceremonies, skits, yells, cheers, and emblems, all of which give it a distinctive character. The symbolism of the White Stag is described in a story telling the White Stag legend. The legend borrows from the Fourth World Jamboree held in Hungary, which in turn was inspired by Hungarian mythology of the white stag. The White Stag Legend is used to inspire in the participants a desire for reflection, continuous self-improvement, and pursuit of higher aims and goals. Other traditions include woggles, waist ropes, staves, berets, and patrol names.
The spirit and tradition activities are used to communicate a specific vision and values that include characteristics of servant leadership, compassion, enthusiasm, kindness, and selflessness.
White Stag uses the "patrol method" to effectively include all members. Baden-Powell wrote "he Patrol System is the one essential feature in which Scout training differs from that of all other organizations, and where the System is properly applied, it is absolutely bound to bring success. It cannot help itself! The formation of the boys into Patrols of from six to eight and training them as separate units each under its own responsible leader is the key to a good Troop."
One of the most important values is a focus on "hands-on learning". The program emphasizes use of experiential learning activities in the context of outdoor education. These help participants retain what they learn about leadership generally and the eleven leadership competencies specifically. For example, participant teams can be challenged to build foot bridges, complete a hike, build a Tyrolean Traverse, cook a meal, or other practical challenges.
Always seeking to engage individuals both physically and mentally, the program uses the "hurdle method". The hurdle method teaches individuals how to nimbly respond situation for which they have not specifically prepared themselves. The manager of learning prepared and present unexpected tasks or challenges to the leader and the group which they must organize themselves to find a solution or to complete a task. The hurdle method is closely linked to hands-on learning.
The program believes leadership can be taught using a "direct approach", not by osmosis or example alone. In early leadership development programs, learning about leadership was not specifically defined with qualified objectives. Learning about leadership was a by-product of other learning activities. The White Stag Method challenges these "indirect" methods and focuses the participant's experience using a "direct approach." The White Stag program defines leadership behaviors in specific terms as eleven leadership competencies.
Youth spend too much time learning what their teachers think is important, irrelevant from what the youth may already know. The "manager of learning" value allows the youth to learn and practice his skills in situations simulating real life. The Manager of Learning methodology first exposes the learner to a situation to help both the learner and the leader assess his current state of knowledge. This causes the learner to internalize a need to improve his knowledge or skills. This is followed by a period of teaching or exposure during which the participant improves from their base-line knowledge. The participant then gets a chance to apply what he has learned, and lastly, evaluates his performance improvement.
The program believes that learning never stops and embraces this as the "infinity principle". According to Bánáthy, leadership behavior cannot be developed "during a few weeks, not even during several months," but must be ongoing.
It takes months for individuals to gain proficiency in leadership skills. "The White Stag continues to leap on—upward and forward—in a never-ending journey that leads the joyous followers to the promised land. For us who wear the badge of the White Stag, the White Stag journey symbolizes the idea of becoming the best we can." The program borrowed words from Baden-Powell's Jamboree farewell, "Forward, Upward, Onward," to define leadership:
Individuals are taught to believe that difficult situations are opportunities for growth that must be overcome. Thus, leadership development cannot take place during a single training course. It is a continuous sequence of sequential, structured learning and experience-building opportunities. The program subscribes to the belief that when an individual embraces the infinite challenge to change, he is engaged in the never-ending process of becoming a leader. "The infinity principle of growth in leadership is what the White Stag symbolizes in this leadership development process."
Avoiding stereotypes and labeling based on personal dress, the program uses polo shirts, t-shirts, and other articles of clothing like neckerchiefs as "uniforms". Participants uniforms display the White Stag logo, which is a visible reminder of the program's founding vision articulated by Baden-Powell at the conclusion of the 1933 World Jamboree. The uniform reminds the individual wearing it of their commitment to the program's values. It instills self-esteem in the person and pride in the program. It eliminates class and socio-economic distinctions. Wearing a uniform improves member's behavior and lessens the impact on a person's personal wardrobe.
Financial support.
The White Stag program is implemented by two 501(c)3 non-profits. The White Stag Leadership Development Academy is located on the Monterey Peninsula and the White Stag Association is located in the San Francisco East Bay. Both are financially self-supporting. The programs are administered and managed by part-time adult volunteers. All participants, including youth and adult staff, pay fees to participate. Fees for participants attending the week-long summer camp are US$275–$325 in 2012. Adult and youth staff pay about US$400 in fees over the course of a year of staff development.
Awards and recognition.
Since 1960, the program has recognized one or two youth and adults each year by presenting them with a "Silver Stag" award. The device, a miniature solid sterling silver stag on a chain or medallion, recognizes the individual's outstanding "contributions and qualities of leadership, spirit and service to the program." One youth staff member from each phase is selected as the outstanding youth staff member. Each graduating participant received a neckerchief unique to each phase that is to be worn only at White Stag functions. Participants may also be recognized with other awards that vary from year to year.
Symbolism and mythology.
The program uses symbolism and mythology to communicate an ethic of always striving for self-improvement and personal achievement. It tells a version of a legend honoring Hunor and Magyar, who led their people in pursuit a mythical White Stag, following it over impassible trails to a new home. Through this story and other ceremonies, the program challenges individuals to continually strive "onward and upward" and "overcome challenges, continuously evaluate, focus on learning, and always strive to improve".
History.
White Stag traces its direct roots to 1933 and Gödöllö, Hungary, and the Fourth World Scout Jamboree which three of its founders attended.
Origins in Hungary.
At the 1933 World Scout Jamboree, a 14 year old Scout named Bela Bánáthy was kneeling by his campfire when three uniformed men rode up on horseback: Count Paul Teleki, the Chief Scout of Hungary and the Chief of Staff for the jamboree; General Kisbarnaki Ferenc Farkas, a general staff officer of the Royal Hungarian Army; and Baden-Powell, the British hero of the Boer War and Chief Scout of the World. The men introduced themselves to the Scout and inspected his camp. They complimented him on a job well done and rode on. Meeting the Chief Scout of Hungary and Boer War hero Robert Baden-Powell left a deep impression on Bánáthy. He decided he would become a military officer instead of a minister.
Bánáthy briefly met fellow Hungarian Boy Scout Joseph Szentkiralyi. Hungarian Sea Scouter Paul Ferenc Sujan's camp was visited by Baden-Powell, who asked to taste some of his soup. American Maury Tripp attended the Jamboree from Saratoga, California. These four Scouts would later play instrumental roles in forming the White Stag program on the Monterey Peninsula. At the conclusion of the Jamboree, Baden-Powell gave a farewell speech in which he challenged the Scouts present to pursue the ideals represented by the White Stag.
This challenge and the myth of the White Stag it cites grew to become a source of inspiration to Bánáthy. During World War II, Bánáthy was a junior officer in the Royal Hungarian Army. After being seriously wounded during combat in Russia, through the connections he made at the World Jamboree, he was invited by General Farkas to join the faculty of the Hungarian Royal Academy. While there he served on the National Council of the Hungarian Scout Association and became the voluntary national director for youth leadership development. Barely escaping Soviet capture and likely execution at the end of World War II, Bánáthy arrived after considerable personal trials in June 1951 at Monterey, California to teach at the Army Language School, where he became reacquainted with Joe Szentkiralyi, who he had met at the Fourth World Jamboree.
Joseph Szentkiralyi had also barely survived World War II. He and his family had previously come to the United States in 1939, where Szentkiralyi worked in New York City. At the start of World War II, they were deported back to Hungary. Because he spoke English, Szentkiralyi was assigned to watch over the crew members of the first American B-17 bomber to crash land in Hungary. When the crew told him sensitive information, he was ordered to reveal the information to his superiors. Citing the Geneva Convention, he refused. The authorities prepared to court-martial him, and Szentkiralyi fled. During a time of frequent Allied aerial bombing raids, he hid where he figured no one would look for him: in the upper floors of apartment buildings. During one bombing raid a bomb crashed through and landed on the floor above him. Fortunately it did not explode. Szentkiralyi and his family later narrowly survived the Siege of Budapest.
After the war ended, Szentkiralyi found work for the American Embassy in Budapest as a translator. However, this put him in a vulnerable position as the Communists hardened their grip on power. Because he had lived in the United States and spoke English, he knew he would fall under suspicion. People he knew began to disappear, including a friend who worked at the U.S. Embassy. Within a few days he found a note on his desk that read, "You are next." With American assistance, he immediately fled Hungary for Switzerland. He and his family returned to New York City for a few months, and Szentkiralyi applied for a position as a Hungarian instructor at the Army Language School. He was hired in the summer of 1948 and founded their Hungarian Department.
Starting in 1951, almost 25 years afterward, four Scouts who had attended the 1933 Fourth World Jamboree were brought back together on the Monterey Peninsula. Joseph Szentkiralyi (which he later Anglicized as St. Clair) renewed his acquaintance with Bánáthy when he hired him. In 1956, they were joined by Hungarian Paul Ferenc Sujan. In Monterey, through their Scouting contacts, they met F. Maurice Tripp.
Growth on the Monterey Peninsula.
Bánáthy had developed a passion for the idea of leadership development in boys when serving in the Hungarian Army. In Monterey, he became Chairman of the Leadership Training Committee of the Monterey Bay Area Council. He sought and received support for his concept of a leadership camp for boys with the Council Executive and Executive Board.
Bánáthy informally recruited one patrol of boys, including his own sons, and took them to summer camp in 1957 to test his idea. John Chiorini, a 17-year-old Eagle Scout, was working on the waterfront. "Béla came through camp with a patrol of six or seven boys and commandeered me to teach a class on camp craft. He said he was trying out some new ideas with this patrol," Chiorini reported "Béla listened intently as I presented and then he came up after and gave me some tips on teaching. He was a mentor to me from that point on."
During the summer of 1958, Bánáthy recruited two patrols of boys to take part. Chiorini was recruited to serve as senior patrol leader. There wasn't much discussion of leadership competencies to start. Bánáthy seemed to have an internal sense of direction which not everyone understood. Chiorini said, "White Stag was all about creating an environment in which youth led youth. At the time, Scouting was not necessarily a boy-led program. I remember it was very clear in Béla’s mind what a boy-led Scouting program looked like. There was no question about who was in charge in White Stag. The boys were." Fran Peterson, a local Scouter who served on the National Engineering Service for the Boy Scouts of America, along with St. Clair, Sujan, and Tripp, helped Bánáthy develop the White Stag program. Some of them remained active with it into the 1970s.
Borrowing on his experience at the 1933 World Jamboree, Bánáthy based the program symbol and its spirit and traditions on the white stag symbol found in the patch for the Fourth World Scout Jamboree, which was in turn based on Hungarian mythology. On June 8, 1959, at an adult staff meeting attended by Béla Bánáthy, Jack Stone, Bill White, Paul Holbrook, Ralph Herring, Fran Petersen, and Staff Advisor Bill Lidderdale, they "officially adopted "White Stag" as the name for junior leaders training events." "Lord Baden-Powell was my personal idol and I long felt a commitment to give back to Scouting what I had received," Bánáthy said.
During August 1959, the first full-scale program was put on. Bánáthy served as Scoutmaster, Fran Petersen was Assistant Scoutmaster, along with eight other adult staff and 13 youth staff. The training troop consisted of 39 trainees from 24 troops. In the first two years of the program, emphasis was placed on training patrol leaders. Bánáthy said, "I saw in these principles an opportunity to develop the White Stag program for my three Boy Scout sons as well as show my gratitude to this country and Scouting."
During the same year, Bánáthy continued his research on leadership and learned that the U.S. Army's Human Resources Research Office (HumRRO) at the Presidio of Monterey was conducting research into the leadership characteristics of non-commissioned officers. Bánáthy contacted research psychologist Paul Hood, Task Leader of Task NCO (Non-commissioned Officer), and began a fruitful collaboration. A HumRRO publication titled, "A Guide for the Infantry Squad Leader–What the Beginning Squad Leader Should Know About Human Relations" articulated a core set of leadership competencies. Bánáthy found Hood's research enumerated characteristics of leadership that strongly validated his vision and direction. With Hood's active encouragement, he decided to incorporate these leadership skills into White Stag.
In 1960, the adult staff announced that they would expand the program to offer an additional phase of leadership development for boys 14–17 years old, to train "junior trainers and impart leadership skills." This phase was christened "Troop Leadership Development".
National Council takes notice.
During 1962–63, Bánáthy focused his research and formalized it as his Master's Thesis at San Jose State University. The Monterey Bay Area Council published an abbreviated version of it titled "A Design for Leadership Development in Scouting." Responding to widespread interest, Dr. Tripp gave a talk in 1963 at the Fifty-third Annual Meeting of the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America on "Development of Leadership in Boy Leaders of Boys". In August 1963, a patrol of Scouts from the San Mateo County Council and a few boys from the Circle Ten Council in Dallas attended White Stag summer camp at the Pico Blanco Scout Reservation. The program was observed and evaluated by Ken Wells (national director of Research) and John Larson (staff researcher). Wells had a long history with Wood Badge, beginning as a participant in the second United States Wood Badge course in 1948. They were impressed by what they saw and experienced.
At the end of the August 1964 summer camp, Béla Bánáthy and Fran Peterson announced that White Stag would begin in 1965 to offer a third phase of leadership development for boys age 11–13, called "Patrol Member Development." This was a revolutionary step, for it made it possible for all boys 11–17 years old to learn leadership skills appropriate to their maturity, capabilities, and needs, and as they grew to re-cycle through the program in another phase and acquire increased skills.
World Scouting publishes paper.
In 1969, the World Organization of the Scout Movement published a paper by Béla Bánáthy titled "Leadership Development: World Scouting Reference Paper No. 1". It described the results of the Boy Scouts of America's research and testing and was presented at the World Scoutings Conference in Helsinki. He advocated leadership development by design in Scouting based on the leadership competencies of White Stag. Bánáthy was appointed to the Interamerican Scout Committee and guided their national training teams at three Interamerican Train the Trainer events in Mexico, Costa Rica, and Venezuela.
Adapted for use in U.S. Wood Badge.
In January 1967, John Larson began work with Bánáthy and Bob Perin to write a new Wood Badge staff guide focusing on leadership. Two of the project members, Ken Wells and Bob Perin, had participated in the second United States Wood Badge course in 1948. Despite their long experience in Wood Badge, they saw the benefit of adding leadership skills development to Wood Badge. William "Green Bar" Hillcourt, Scoutmaster of the first U.S. Wood Badge course in 1948, felt very strongly that the traditional teaching of Scoutcraft skills should be retained. Hillcourt had recently formally retired, but his opinion still held considerable weight. Nonetheless, Chief Scout Joseph Brunton approved the changes.
The National Boy Scouts of America began to test the revised Wood Badge program utilizing the White Stag leadership competencies later that year. In May 1967, staff from councils who were invited to attend the initial course met at Philmont to plan the program, and on June 17, 1967, the first experimental Wood Badge course was offered at Philmont. One month later, the Circle Ten Council in Dallas presented its first new Wood Badge course. In September 1967, six councils were approved to pilot-test the new Wood Badge program in 1968: Monterey Bay Area Council, Piedmont Council, Middle Tennessee, Del-Mar-Va, and Hiawatha (formerly Onondago) and Circle Ten Council.
Among these was an experimental Wood Badge course in Monterey in 1968. Bánáthy was Course Director, Joe St. Clair served as Scoutmaster, and Fran Petersen was senior patrol leader. John Larson, National Director of Education, was also present. In a unique application not since reproduced, all attendees were asked to bring their entire troop to a single week of summer camp, allowing the Wood Badge staff who also attended to use the summer camp as an application for Wood Badge.
Modified for use in junior leader training.
Pilot-testing and experimentation continued for three more years, and an experimental junior leader training program was begun in 1969. This later became Troop Leader Development, containing modified versions of the leadership competencies which were included in the final "Troop Leadership Development Staff Guide", written by John W. Larson, which credited White Stag with its origins:
Recent history.
The White Stag program continued to present the Monterey Bay Area Council's official junior leader training program through the early 1970s, and again from 1994 to 2004. In 1975, Bill Roberts, the Phase III Director, invited the first Explorer girls age 14–18 to take part in the program and adult women to serve on adult staff, becoming the first coeducational leadership development program in the Boy Scouts of America. When Bánáthy learned of girls' new role in the program, he said it was long overdue. Committed to training youth of all ages in a manner reflecting the real world, where both sexes must work together, the next year White Stag invited girls age 11–13 to participate as well. The program was evaluated by a staff member of from the Western Region of the Boy Scouts of America in 1978. He wrote:
At the same time, the Monterey Bay Area Council decided to replace the White Stag program with the nationally mandated adaptation of White Stag, the Troop Leader Development program. The adult volunteer leaders of White Stag founded the White Stag Association in 1982, which continued to sponsor the program. It moved the camp to Santa Cruz and rented Skylark Ranch Resident Camp from the Girl Scouts of Santa Clara County for two years. In subsequent years, the Association moved the summer program to San Mateo County Council's Camp Cutter in the Santa Cruz Mountains, and later, at different times, to Marin Council's Camp Marin-Sierra and Yosemite Council's Camp Mensinger in the California Sierra Nevada. They largely stopped attracting youth from the Monterey Bay Area as well.
In 1993, the Monterey Bay Area Council's Junior Leader Training Chairman Steve Cardinalli offered to run the Council's junior leader training program using the White Stag methods. This proposal was readily accepted by the Council Executive. White Stag adult alumni of the now San Francisco Bay Area-based program who lived in the Monterey Peninsula area recruited a youth staff who planned and presented the White Stag program at Camp Pico Blanco in 1994. This Monterey-based program continued to present the council's junior leader training program until 2005, when a new Council Executive decided once again to adopt the current National Youth Leadership Training (NYLT) program. The adult leadership of the Monterey White Stag group incorporated in 2005 as the non-profit White Stag Leadership Development Academy, Inc. to support the program. They moved their summer camp program to Camp Cutter and later to Camp Lindblad in the Santa Cruz Mountains.
During 2004, White Stag Program Director Steve Cardinalli and former Director John Connelly founded a comparable program for the Girl Scouts of California's Central Coast. The program is based on the tenets of White Stag. It was held at Cutter Scout Reservation for two years. The Girl Scouts then assumed leadership of the program and renamed it Artemis Leadership Training Adventure (ALTA), after the Greek goddess who protects young girls, animals, and the natural environment. They have continued to run Camp Artemis as a resident camp for girls 11–17 each summer in the Santa Cruz mountains.
Both the Northern and Central California White Stag organizations continue to develop and present summer camps for youth by youth, led by a corps of volunteer adults. The program observed its 50th anniversary in 2008. Participation in the Monterey-based group has continued to increase each year, to 258 in 2010, up from 70 in 2006. They currently run two week-long summer camps. The Northern California-based group has attracted between 40 and 55 campers for each of the past three years. Since its inception, the two White Stag programs have operated continuously for more than 50 years entirely on a voluntary basis, with an estimated 21,000 youth having attended its camps.
Other programs using the White Stag name.
In 1967, Rex Hatch returned to the Crossroads of America Council after attending a pilot test of the JLT program at Philmont. He founded in 1972 a junior leader training program, previously known as Silver Bars, which was initially based on the White Stag program's principles. It was later modified to follow the National Youth Leadership Training Course syllabus. The Hoosier Trails Council in Bloomington, Indiana produced a "National Youth Leadership Training" program based on the national syllabus that was nicknamed "White Stag NYLT" until 2011. On the east coast, the Narragansett Council in Rhode Island nicknamed their national NYLT program as "White Stag NYLT" until 2011.
These programs are produced by the local councils. They present the standardized, nationally mandated National Youth Leadership Training program. The non-profit White Stag Academy in Monterey, California sponsors Venture Crew 122, which develops and produces a summer camp program independent of the Boy Scout of America's nationally mandated junior leaders training program.

When Manuel Ortiz Guerrero listened the guarania India for the first time interpreted by José Asunción Flores, he manifested his admiration for the piece, but questioned the lyric saying that it didn't had the same transcendence of the song, and offered to compose a better lyric. Flores conversed it with Rigoberto Fontao Meza, and he agreed supposing that his friend wouldn't allow the change, but Flores changed the lyric with the one from Manuel Ortiz Guerrero, and it became the version of India known nowadays, declared in 1944 by law of the Executive State as "Official Paraguayan Music" along with "Campamento Cerro León" and "Cerro Corá".
"Fontao Meza never forgot that attitude of mine. He took those hard feelings to his grave.“ says Flores in his memories.

Concern (business)

A concern (, Cyrillic: Концерн) is a type of business group common in Europe, particularly in Germany. It results from the merger of several legally independent companies into a single economic entity under unified management. These associated companies are called "Group" companies.
A Group consists of a parent company and one or more subsidiaries. One particular form of the way a Group is organized is the Holding Organization.
Outside of professionals, the term "Group", also mistakenly "within the meaning of large companies" – regardless of its corporate structure – is understood.
The Group concept is one of anti-trust relevance: the so-called "Group" privilege, the privilege of the consolidated Group companies involved, means that in itself, prohibition included practices did not violate German or European Commission (EC) anti-trust law. On the other hand, the group concept in Banking Act in the formation of borrower unit and particularly of the large credit limits of paramount importance.
The legal Group – term.
The German Stock Corporation Act defines the Group as follows: "If one dominant and one or more dependent companies under the unified leadership of the ruling company together, they form a Group and the individual companies are affiliated companies" (Section 18).
The key essence of the Group is the summary of legally independent companies under a single management. The single line is a vague legal concept, in which the legislators are aware of a specific waived. After the prevailing opinion is the single line if a company other company actually controlled. After the position of Group companies the law further differentiates between flat groups and hierarchical groups.
Flat Group.
Characteristic of equal Atomic Group is the equal status of the Group. There is, in this case, no dominant companies, but the governing bodies are in a mutual adjustment contract. This may take the form of an advisory board or a human interdependence of the management of participating companies.
Hierarchical Group.
In practice more often is the form of a hierarchical Group. Here the companies are dependent under the direction of a single dominant company. A dependence of the subordinate enterprises occurs when the dominant companies to directly or indirectly exert a dominant influence, although this power must not be exercised, but it is sufficient if only the opportunity to do so.
There are three other forms of hierarchical groups, each with varying degree of integration:
Integrating Group.
Integration is the most intense form of the Group. It occurs when a corporation to another domestic 'Aktiengesellschaft' (AG) is taken. The integrated company maintains its independence at the outside, but internally acts as an operating division. Requirement is a majority-owned by at least 95%. In economic terms, the inclusion of a merger, or merger very close.
Contractual Group.
A contractor will be consolidated by a controlling agreement Sid Section 291 founded. A controlling agreement entitles the dominant company, the chairman of the dependent company with regard to the management of the company to issue. This deposit law is comprehensive and is thus detrimental for instructions, unless they contradict the consolidated interest or constitutes a threat to the existence dependent companies dare. Precondition for the conclusion of the contract is a three-quarter majority in the General Assembly of both companies. The comprehensive legal remittance companies obtained the legal ruling the full management of the business dependent society.
Proper Group.
If neither control nor a contract inclusion, we speak under the following conditions of a proper group: There is a dependency ratio meaning of Section 17, the dependent company is a corporation (AG, Inc, Ltd., a corresponding application of section 17 on partnerships is already there because of the prevailing principle of unanimous decision-making on basic business management measures hardly possible) and the dominant company has the possibility to influence the dependent companies. Basis for the influence of the dominant company in principle constitutes a majority stake, which means the capital and / or majority. This influence may however not be used, the dependent society to a negative business for them to comply unless the disadvantages are balanced. This disadvantage, however, is compensatory in practice both the nature and the extent to difficult.
Business Group forms.
Another distinctive feature of the different structure groups. There are many types of these weird and small business group that form.
Vertical Group.
As a Group called vertical corporations, the upstream and downstream stages of the actual value and power generation include a broad spectrum of the service providing cover themselves and not by outside companies. Example would be a corporate group European Coal and Steel Community, both coal and iron ore and steel degrades produced and possibly also marketed.
However, this Group now form part outdated – it is in modern economic often seen as uneconomical. Materials for processing, supply parts to produce is no longer itself, but buys them in changing suppliers about the best prices. Example of this form of production, "Lean Production" would be companies in the automotive industry, such as Volkswagen Group.
Conglomerate.
"(inorganic groups)"
The conglomerate consists of enterprises in different areas. The individual companies have limited business relationships with each other. As multi-national corporations are also those groups designated locations in several states.
Criticism of corporations.
The result of the merger often emerging political power of (wholesale) companies has been criticised for their formation. The critics can be divided into three groups:
Since the emergence of New Social Movements, corporations have also become the focus of movements such as the Environmental movement and the Anti-globalization movement (see Black Book brand companies).

Parc du Mugel

The Parc du Mugel is a municipal park and botanical garden in the town of La Ciotat, in the French department of Bouches-du-Rhône, on the Mediterranean coast of France between Marseille and Toulon. It is listed among the Notable Gardens of France by the French Ministry of Culture.
History.
In 1805 the park was divided into three properties, which were joined in 1870. In 1923 the land was purchased by Marseille coal merchant Louis Fouquet, who created the tropical garden. In 1941 the one of the buildings on the site was converted into a youth hostel. Among other notable guests was Dr S. Goldschlager and his wife Sala, refugees from Nazi Europe. In 1947 the house and park was bought by the Bonzo family, who sold thirteen hectares in 1952 to the town of La Ciotat. The town eventually bought the entire property, and, in 1982, the park was opened to the public.
The site.
The park, twelve hectares in size, is located on the edge of the calanque of La Ciotat, a rocky inlet of the Mediterranean, and has a small beach on the calanque. It is at the foot of a massive rock, Le Bec d'Aigle (Eng: The Eagle's Beak), 155 meters high, which shelters the site from the wind, while the Mediterranean warms it in the winter, and keeps the temperature down in the summer. 
The Bec d'Aigle is composed of an unusual agglomorate called "Poudingue" ("Pudding"), which is believed to be the remnant of a former continent, the pyreneo-sardo-corse land mass, which once occupied the Mediterranean. The park is watered by several small reservoirs, which capture the rain running off the rock.
The Tropical Garden.
The tropical garden contains thirty different species of palm trees, as well as mimosa, bougainvillia, bamboo, banana, and other tropical plants. It also features a garden of aromatic plants. A garden of lavander is planted just below the main house.
The Provençal Nature Preserve.
The nature preserve covers the steep hillside between the tropical garden and the Bec D'Aigle. It is composed of native liege oak trees, and the traditional brush landscape, locally called garrigue.

Future Islands

Future Islands are a synthpop band based in Baltimore, Maryland, signed to 4AD. The band is composed of Gerrit Welmers (keyboards and programming), William Cashion (bass, acoustic and electric guitars), and Samuel T. Herring (words and vocals). Future Islands formed in January 2006 in Greenville, North Carolina.
History.
The band met and formed while studying art at East Carolina University in Greenville. Their first band was Art Lord & the Self-Portraits, which included Samuel T. Herring, William Cashion, Gerrit Welmers, Adam Beeby, and Kymia Nawabi. That band lasted from February 2003 until Fall of 2005. In 2006, Cashion, Herring, and Welmers formed Future Islands with Erick Murillo, who played an electronic drum kit.
Future Islands released "Little Advances" in April 2006 and a self-released split CD with Welmers' solo project Moss of Aura in January 2007. They recorded their debut album "Wave Like Home" with Chester Gwazda at Backdoor Skateshop in Greenville, NC later that year.

Swaran Lata

Swaran Lata (, ) was a Pakistani film actress. She started her career in the film industry in British India and later moved to Pakistan. She was described as a 'Tragedy Queen' because of her emotional, tragic roles, her presence on screen and her moving dialogue delivery. She worked in Bollywood and in Pakistani cinema.
Early life.
Swaran Lata was born into a Siyal Jatt Sikh family in Rawalpindi, British India on December 20, 1924. She did her Senior Cambridge from Delhi and then joined the Academy of Music and Arts, Lucknow. In early 1940s, her family moved to Bombay.

Career.
An exceptional and wondrous story about how she entered the realm of acting trails Swaran. Her parents died when she was very young and she lived most of her adolescent life with her elder brother, whom she recalls "very strict". However, it is the story of how she got discovered that Swaran tells with great passion: ""I was a student at college in Lucknow, India. When I was traveling from Delhi to Lucknow, a few directors saw me. They approached me to act in films but I was not interested at first. One of them then went to my elder brother with the offer, and to my utmost surprise he agreed"".
Swaran Lata started her career as a stage actress. Her first film was "Awaaz" released in 1942. Swaran and Nazir migrated to Pakistan at the time of the Partition of India in 1947. They left everything they had behind in Bombay and shifted to Lahore. The duo had to start from scratch and were part of the early Pakistani film industry.
Swaran Lata was heroine of Pakistan's first ever silver jubilee film "Pherey". The film was a Punjabi film but she was an Urdu speaker who was trained in Lucknow, the home of Urdu "littérateurs".

Immortal Six Hundred

In 1864, the Confederate Army imprisoned 50 Union Army officers as human shields against federal artillery in the city of Charleston, South Carolina, in an attempt to stop Union artillery from firing upon civilians in the city. In retaliation, United States Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton ordered six hundred captured Confederate officers to be taken to Morris Island, South Carolina, at the entrance to Charleston Harbor and used as human shields for forty-five days in an attempt to silence the Confederate gunners manning Fort Sumter. These men became known in the South as the Immortal Six Hundred.
At one point General Foster planned an exchange of the six hundred, but it was stopped by General Grant who had previously terminated all prisoner of war exchanges due to the history of Confederate mistreatment of captured US colored troops and wrote, "In no circumstances will he be allowed to make exchanges of prisoners of war ."
Three of the six hundred died from subsistence on starvation rations issued as retaliation for the conditions found by the Union at the Confederate prisons in Andersonville, Georgia, and Salisbury, North Carolina.
Upon an outbreak of yellow fever in Charleston, the Union officers were removed from the city limits. In response the Union Army transferred the Immortal Six Hundred to Fort Pulaski outside of Savannah.
There they were crowded into the fort’s cold, damp casemates. For 42 days, a "retaliation ration" of ten ounces of moldy cornmeal and half a pint of soured onion pickles was the only food issued to the prisoners. The starving men were reduced to supplementing their rations with the occasional rat or stray cat. Thirteen men died there of diseases such as dysentery and scurvy.
At Fort Pulaski, the prisoners organized "The Relief Association of Fort Pulaski for Aid and Relief of the Sick and Less Fortunate Prisoners" on December 13, 1864. Col. Abram Fulkerson of the 63rd Tennessee Infantry Regiment was elected president. Out of their sparse funds, the prisoners collected and expended eleven dollars, according to a report filed by Fulkerson on December 28, 1864.
Five later died at Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. The remaining prisoners were returned to Fort Delaware on March 12, 1865, where another twenty-five died.
A notable escape effort was led by Captain Henry Dickinson of the 2nd Virginia Cavalry. On the prisoner's journey to Fort Delaware, Dickinson organized a group of thirteen officers, including Colonel Paul F. DeGournay of the 12th Battalion, Louisiana Artillery and Colonel George Woolfolk, to try to escape from the gunboat. However, the effort failed when the captain of the ship noticed one of the 13 men was missing, leading the prisoners to the brig below the deck of the ship.
The prisoners became known throughout the South for their refusal to take the Oath of Allegiance under adverse circumstances. Southerners have long lauded their refusal as honorable and principled.

Iniquis Afflictisque

Iniquis Afflictisque ("On the Persecution of the Church in Mexico") is an encyclical of Pope Pius XI promulgated on November 18, 1926, to denounce the persecution of the Catholic Church in Mexico. It was one of three encyclicals concerning Mexico, including "Acerba Animi" (1932) and "Firmissimam Constantiamque" (1937). The Mexican government at the time was engaging in violently anticlerical persecution of the Church and the Pope harshly criticised the government for its abuses. 
The Pope criticized the state's interference in matters of worship, outlawing of religious orders and the expropriation of Church property. He noted that, "Priests are ... deprived of all civil and political rights. They are thus placed in the same class with criminals and the insane."

Childhelp

Childhelp (formerly Childhelp USA) is a national non-profit organization dedicated to helping victims of child abuse and neglect and at-risk children through advocacy, prevention, treatment and community outreach. Founded in 1959 by Sara O'Meara and Yvonne Fedderson, Childhelp is one of the largest non-profit child abuse prevention and treatment agencies in the nation. It operates facilities in seven states around the U.S. and the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline, 1-800-4-A-CHILD (1-800-422-4453), that services the entire United States, its territories and Canada.
The organization offers a wide variety of services, not only to abused and neglected children, but to treatment professionals, educators, parents, foster care families the community and law enforcement professionals. Through various community outreach efforts, Childhelp has tried to increase awareness about child abuse. As part of those effort in 2000, Childhelp established the National Day of Hope. It is observed every year on the first Wednesday of April during National Child Abuse Prevention Month. In 2009, the organization celebrated its 50th anniversary. Childhelp relies upon private donations to expand its operations and services across the nation.
According to a 2007 report by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, almost five children die every day to child abuse and neglect and millions more reports are made every year of abuse.
Founders.
Sara O'Meara (then Sara Buckner) and Yvonne Lime Fedderson, then Yvonne Lime, first met in 1958 on the set of the ABC situation comedy, "The Adventures of Ozzie & Harriet". The two played the part of Ricky Nelson's girlfriend and quickly became friends.
While on a government-sponsored goodwill tour to support the troops in Tokyo the pair founded Childhelp in 1959 when they opened International Orphans to support 11 Japanese-American children found wandering the streets, unable to get into any orphanages because of their mixed heritage. Within three weeks the number of children increased to 100.
Over the years the pair would work together to grow Childhelp into one of the largest child abuse prevention and treatment non-profit organizations and operate today as Chairman and CEO (Sara) and President (Yvonne). Their efforts have won them more than 100 awards and honors. The most recent award in June 2008, was the 2008 Most Dynamic Woman Award from Clarins USA.

Book and Lifetime movie.
In 2003 Sara O'Meara and Yvonne Fedderson published the book "Silence Broken: Moving From a Loss of Innocence to a World of Healing and Love". The book, based upon a true story, chronicles how Sara and Yvonne began their work with children and follows the story of the organization from the founders, associates and victims. The founders chronicle their participation in such well-known events as Operation Babylift. One little boy treated at the Childhelp Merv Griffin Village in Beaumont, California is the focus of the title. After witnessing his parents murder his sister, the little boy became totally silent and traveled through 15 different foster homes before finally ending up at the Village. The book details the Childhelp staff's attempt to get the boy to speak. After days, the man in charge of the Village's animal therapy program took the little boy to the barn and told him that "Chocolate," a pony, was now his responsibility. Everyday, the little boy ran to the barn to take care of Chocolate. On the fifth day, he put his arms around the pony and said, "I love you." Once his silence had been broken, the boy rapidly began to heal.
In 2005, the book was developed into a Lifetime Network movie. "For the Love of a Child" regularly airs on the Lifetime Network and is an accurate representative of the book. Actress Peri Gilpin plays Sara O'Meara and actress Teri Polo plays Yvonne Fedderson. The film won two Young Artist Awards in 2007; Best Performance in a TV Movie, Miniseries or Special (Comedy or Drama) - Supporting Young Actor, Jake D. Smith; and Best Performance in a TV Movie, Miniseries or Special (Comedy or Drama) - Supporting Young Actress, Emily Hirst.
History.
Childhelp has enjoyed a rich history that has spanned internationally over 50 years and impacted the lives of millions of children. The organization first took roots in Japan in 1959 under the name of International Orphans to help the unwanted children of American soldiers and Japanese women. In 1976 the organization changed names to Children's Village USA then later to Childhelp USA before finally settling on Childhelp. Today it is one of the largest child abuse prevention non-profit organizations.
Japanese Orphanages.
In 1959 Sara and Yvonne traveled to Tokyo, Japan on a goodwill tour for the American troops stationed there after a large typhoon hit the region. While on the streets they encountered a group of children cold and frightened, huddled together. After learning the children had no parents and were born from American troops during the Korean War, the two actresses took the children to their hotel room for the night and sought out an orphanage the next day.
The following day they learned the children were turned away from all the orphanages because of their mixed heritage. They were told of a woman, Kin Horuchi, living in a one-room hut that kept several Japanese-American children.
Kin agreed to care for the 11 additional children and the ladies promised to send money to help the children. They thought the problem was settled, but word of what they were doing spread rapidly through the city. They had suddenly become surrogate mothers to a brood of 100 Japanese-American children that were left on the doorstep of the hut, which now needed to become an orphanage.
Returning to California, the actresses began to raise funds among friends and their families, as well as the film community to care for the children. From that beginning grew International Orphans Incorporated, an organization that eventually built four orphanages, caring for thousands of abandoned Japanese-American children.
Operation Babylift.
In April 1975, American troops and Vietnamese refugees evacuated Vietnam in mass numbers before and during the fall of Saigon. Operation Babylift was the name given to the mass evacuation of children from South Vietnam to the United States and other countries (including, for example, Australia, France and Canada) at the end of the Vietnam War. The first flight crashed after the locks of the rear loading ramp failed, killing 138 people, among them 78 children. By the final American flight out of South Vietnam, over 2,000 infants and children had been evacuated.
Sara and Yvonne helped arrange Operation Babylift in America and saw thousands of children to adoption agencies. At the time Childhelp was named International Orphans.
National Bus Tour.
In April 2009, Childhelp launched a bus tour that traveled to several major cities around the U.S. The "End Child Abuse Now" Tour was designed to bring about awareness to child abuse and neglect. The 40 foot bus was decorated with the Childhelp colors and graphics.
The tour’s goal was to create a grassroots groundswell of support through joining Childhelp’s national membership group. Through this group, members will be updated on legislation, tips, facts, stats and ways to get involved in their communities to end child abuse.
On April 2, the tour was officially launched on the sets of The Today Show and Nancy Grace.
Services.
Childhelp offers a variety of services to the children that enter its facilities, professionals in therapy and the community. Over the years the organization has broadened its facilities, incorporated previously established programs and helped bring them to a national audience and educated the public.
National Hotline.
In 1982, Childhelp started the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline, 1-800-4-A-CHILD (1-800-422-4453). The hotline, staffed 24 hours a day, 365 days a year by professional crisis counselors has received over two million calls since its inception. The hotline receives calls from children at risk for abuse, parents or guardians looking for crisis intervention and concerned individuals who may suspect abuse is occurring in their neighborhood. The hotline also provides information and referrals to thousands of emergency, social service and support resources under complete confidentiality and anonymity.
The hotline receives absolutely no government funding and is supported by the generous donations of the community, organizations and foundations.
Advocacy Centers.
Childhelp operates five advocacy centers in the U.S. that minimize the trauma to an abused child through condensing the investigative process by housing professionals in law enforcement, child protective services, medicine, mental health and prosecution all under one roof. The child friendly facilities provide an environment far more comfortable than an emergency room or police station for the children.
Treatment.
Childhelp offers treatment to victims of child abuse through several different methods.
The first is at two residential treatment centers known as Villages. Both villages, located in rural communities in California and Virginia provide specialized, comprehensive treatment programs for court-referred, severally abused, neglected and at-risk children. A staff of therapists, teachers, social workers and medical professionals work at the villages to provide the children with the best possible care. A combination of psychotherapy, education, art, music, animal-assisted, spiritual and recreation therapies are used. Children typically live at a Childhelp village between three months and two years.
Childhelp also operates community-based group homes in both California and Virginia. Children often will transition from one of the residential treatment villages to the smaller group homes. The group homes provide an intensive level of supervision and therapeutic services in order to prepare children for the transition to non-institutional care in foster homes, adoptive homes or the home of their family or relatives.
Lastly, Childhelp provides long and short-term foster care in California, Michigan and Tennessee. The organization is licensed to recruit, screen, train and certify foster care parents, and provides ongoing support to both foster parents and the children in their care.
Professional training.
Childhelp offers a variety of training opportunities to professionals in Arizona, California, Georgia and Virginia. The organization offers a range of seminars and workshops geared to child welfare case workers, medical personnel, fire professionals and the law enforcement community throughout the year. In addition, training is offered to foster families and caretakers of abused and neglected children, including babysitters. Childhelp also provides Good Touch/Bad Touch training to educators in Georgia.
Good Touch/Bad Touch.
Good Touch/Bad Touch is a curriculum that helps children in school, Kindergarten through 6th grade, recognize and report the signs of sexual abuse. Authored in 1983 by Pam Church, the curriculum has undergone 11 different revisions to keep it current, meets strict educational criteria and has been used by over 6000 educators. The program, operating in 42 states nationwide was acquired by Childhelp in 2005.
Childhelp Crystal Darkness.
Childhelp acquired ownership of the Crystal Darkness Campaign in May 2008. Childhelp Crystal Darkness is a 30-minute documentary regarding the dangers and addictiveness of methamphetamines. Dr. Jerry Jones at Arkansas Children's Hospital believes there is a link between meth use and child abuse.
Community outreach.
Community outreach is important to the organization to obtain new volunteers, donors and to spread the message about child abuse. Childhelp obtains a variety of public awareness including distributing brochures and other printed materials, media appearances and stories and public service announcements. Childhelp has produced a 30-second PSA available to both radio and television networks to air. The organization also holds numerous charity events year-long that draw in public donations and create strong community awareness.
In 2000, Childhelp founded the Childhelp National Day of Hope. Held in Washington, D.C. on the first Wednesday of April (Child Abuse Prevention Month) every year, the event regularly draws the support and participation of numerous members of the United States Congress.
Advocacy Ambassadors.
Over several decades and with the help of Sara O’Meara and Yvonne Fedderson’s history as Hollywood actresses, Childhelp has drawn numerous celebrities and everyday volunteers to support the organization's cause, promote it in the media, attend special fund raising events, and give up their time and talents for a noteworthy cause. Notable active celebrity ambassadors include Kathie Lee Gifford, Casper Van Dien and Catherine Oxenberg, Jane Seymour and Mary Costa.
In 2008, Sara and Yvonne were guests of Kathie Lee's on the "Today Show" to speak about the epidemic of child abuse.
In 2007, Jane Seymour sponsored an Art Pillow contest as part of the Jane Seymour Collection. Children ages 7–14 were challenged to create the design to appear on the pillow, which was revealed in April 2007 in connection with Child Abuse Prevention Month.

Betrayed by Rita Hayworth

Betrayed by Rita Hayworth (Spanish, "La traición de Rita Hayworth") is a 1968 novel by the Argentine novelist Manuel Puig. It was Puig's first novel.
Literary critic Jean Franco writes that the book "was a revelation when it appeared, exploding once and for all the simplistic notions of American cultural imperialism." The book features what would become Puig's customary interests in mass culture, particularly Hollywood film. As Franco observes, "Set in a small provincial town in Buenos Aires province, the novel traces the intense affective relationship between Toto and his mother and friends, a relationship in which Hollywood films such as "Blood and Sand" and "The Great Waltz" provide somewhat bizarre models for an affective life which is not satisfied either by religion or the state."
With Puig's subsequent novel, "Boquitas pintadas" of 1969, the book was a key text in the transition from Boom to post-Boom in Latin American fiction.

First emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly

The first emergency special session of the United Nations General Assembly was convened on 1 November and ended on 10 November 1956 resolving the Suez Crisis by creating the United Nations Emergency Force to provide an international presence between the belligerents in the canal zone. The emergency special session was convened due to the failure of the Security Council to resolve the instability at the Suez Canal, invoking "Uniting for Peace" resolution which transferred the issue from the Security Council to the General Assembly. On the fourth day of the session the Canadian representative, Lester B. Pearson, introduced the concept of a UN police force. The creation of the United Nations Emergency Force (the first peacekeeping force) was approved by the General Assembly with 57 supports and zero opposes. The vote had 19 countries abstaining, including the United Kingdom, France, Egypt, the Soviet Union and several Eastern European countries.
Background.
The issue developed after years of attacks by Israel and Egypt against each other. Egypt abrogated the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, began restricting Israeli shipping, and in 1955 turned to Czechoslovakia to purchase weapons. In July 1956 the United States withdrew financial assistance for Egypt's Aswan Dam project, leading Egypt to nationalize the Suez Canal Company. In September, the Security Council convened to consider "the situation created by the unilateral action of the Egyptian government in bringing to an end the system of international operation of the Suez Canal" and "actions against Egypt by some Powers, particularly France and the United Kingdom, which constitute a danger to international peace and security and are serious violations of the Charter of the United Nations".
In October the Security Council passed Resolution 118 calling on the sovereignty of Egypt to be respected and the operation of the Suez Canal to be insulated from the politics of any country. However, Israel invaded Egypt shortly after. An American draft resolution calling on Israel to withdraw from Egypt to behind armistice lines was vetoed by France and the United Kingdom who joined Israeli forces in the invasion. Security Council Resolution 119 passed on October 31 admitted its failure to maintain international peace and security invoking the 1950 "Uniting for Peace" resolution triggering an emergency special session of the General Assembly.
Emergency special session.
On the first day of the special session the General Assembly adopted the American resolution calling for Israel to immediately withdraw its forces from Egypt to behind armistice lines. The measure passed with 64 supports, 5 opposes, and 6 absents — the United Kingdom, France, Israel, Australia, and New Zealand all opposed. Canada abstained, citing a lack of a role for the UN in the peace settlement, which would make the ceasefire only temporary.
At the time the Canadian Minister of External Affairs, Lester B. Pearson was in discussion with the Secretary-General regarding an idea for a UN police force. On 4 November, the Canadian minister introduced the proposal for such a force and a resolution supporting the concept was adopted. The resolution passed with 57 supports and zero opposes, though there were 19 absents including the United Kingdom, France, Egypt, the Soviet Union and several Eastern European countries. On the same day, the Chief of staff at the UN Truce Supervision Organization, E. L. M. Burns, was appointed to head the new force as its Chief of Command. He was authorized to recruit members observer nations of the UNTSO and to pursue further recruitment from other member states, except for permanent members of the Security Council.
On 6 November, the Secretary-General presented a preliminary report to the General Assembly defining the concept and scope of the UNEF and establishing guiding principles. The next day the report was adopted, without any amendments, by a vote count of 64 supports, zero opposes, and 12 absent, including Egypt, Israel, South Africa, the Soviet Union and several Eastern European countries. Both the United Kingdom and France voted in favour because the plan included an international force in the Suez Canal, which they stated was their intention the entire time. The Soviet Union abstained believing it was counter to the Charter of the UN but did not object in order to prevent further aggression against Egypt. An Advisory Committee to implement the plan was formed, consisting of representatives from Brazil, Canada, Sri Lanka, Colombia, India, Norway, and Pakistan, with the Secretary-General as chairman.
The emergency special session ended on 10 November 1956 with the creation of a new UN police force (peacekeepers) to separate the two sides.

Aaron Harris (drummer)

Aaron Harris (born November 11, 1977) is an American drummer, best known for his career with Los Angeles, California-based post-metal band Isis. He was with the band from its inception in 1997 to its dissolution in 2010. Since Isis' demise, Harris has become increasingly involved in his career as a Producer/ Mixer. In addition to recording and mixing the debut from his new band Palms, Harris has also worked on records for ISIS, Pelican, Zozobra, Carthasy, Mental Architects, Crone, Jakob, The Jezabels, Mothra, and more. He has also done remixes Puscifer and The Jezabels. He also works as drum tech for Danny Carey of Tool, and Abe Cunningham of the Deftones. Harris has also toured mixing live sound for Pelican, Jakob, Melvins, and The Jezabels.
His early experience in drumming came from his father, who is also a drummer. Harris would play along to Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Emerson, Lake & Palmer and The Police, and has reached his current level of proficiency without any lessons or formal training. He has, however, received some tuition with the tabla, from Aloke Dutta, at the recommendation of Tool's Danny Carey. Melvins and Neurosis are also direct influences on his and Isis' sound. He cites Bill Bruford as an influence on his later material, having been introduced to his work through Danny Carey.
Harris' first band was in a band named Loga, which he joined whilst in high school. He was given a cassette of Melvins by the band members and asked to emulate the style of their drummer, Dale Crover. His material, he says, “changed life [... it really shaped me into a whole new drummer.”
In October 2006 Harris began endorsing Paiste cymbals. In 2009, Harris also signed an endorsement deal with Sonor drums. He is also sponsored by Evans Drumheads and Vater. Harris is also endorsed by Vater drumsticks, and Heil microphones.
Since Isis' split in 2010, Harris has moved towards the technical side of music; this shift has encompassed stints as a drum tech for Tool and Deftones, as well as production, recording and mixing credits for a number of musical projects. Alongside former Isis members Jeff Caxide and Bryant Clifford Meyer, he announced in May 2011 that he has plans to form a new band.
In April 2012 it was announced that Harris had joined Chino Moreno of Deftones, along with former bandmates Jeff Caxide and Clifford Meyer, in a side project by the name of Palms. Their first album was originally slated for release in 2012 on Ipecac Records, but is now expected to be released in early 2013.
Outside music, Harris is a keen cyclist, and before the formation of Isis, used to race.

The majority of Arévalo's professional career has been restricted to playing on the Futures (ITF) circuit, with a further 22 appearances for the El Salvador Davis Cup team; he also encountered modest success in the juniors, reaching a peak of No. 10 in 2004. However, in 2008, aided by the Salvadoran Tennis Federation ("Federación Salvadoreña de Tenis"), he was awarded an invitation to the 2008 Beijing Olympics tennis tournament. The Tripartite Commission, which issued the invitation, is composed of representatives from International Olympic Committee (IOC), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and the International Tennis Federation (ITF), and it is standard practice to award such invitations (of which there were two for the men's singles tennis event) to countries with small Olympic teams. Arévalo was the first player from El Salvador to represent the country, in a tennis competition, at the Olympics. Arévalo defeated Lee Hyung-taik in three sets, in the first round, before being beaten by Swiss World No. 1 Roger Federer in the second.

Oliver Pocher

Oliver Pocher (born 18 February 1978 in Hanover, West Germany) is a German actor, stand-up comedian and television host.
Biography.
Early life and professional training.
Pocher is the son of Gerhard and Jutta Pocher and grew up in Hanover. His parents are Jehovah's Witnesses and he too was raised as one. In 2007, Pocher stated that, unlike his parents, he had no contact with the organization anymore as he claimed "not to have agreed with their rules“.
The general predication that Pocher attended a Waldorf school was denied by his management. Pocher successfully completed his training as an insurance broker at Signal Iduna Bauspar AG.
During the time of his apprenticeship he had some part-time jobs at various radio stations and as a DJ in clubs and during family celebrations. He also appeared in the comedian group Holla-Bolla and as an entertainer at Birte Karalus, a German chat show. After his apprenticeship he worked for the Swiss life insurance "Schweizerlebensversicherung und Rental AG" (today: SwissLife) and the "HDI Lebensversicherung AG" (HDI life insurance).
Career.
Pocher's first television appearance was on 28 October 1998 at the afternoon chat show of Bärbel Schäfer. Pocher was given 5 minutes to make the audience laugh.
On 29 September 1999 he presented the show "Chart Surfer Trash Top 100", "Was geht ab", "Planet Viva" and finally 2002 his own show "Alles Pocher, ... oder was?".
Between January 2003 to 14 April 2006 he presents the show "Rent a Pocher" on ProSieben.
In 2006 he recorded the single "Schwarz und Weiss," a song dedicated to the 2006 world cup. A music video was made, featuring Oliver as several pressbox speakers, as well as him performing the song in front of fans dressed in Team Germany attire.
From October 2007 to April 2009, Pocher joined established late night host Harald Schmidt's show on the Das Erste television channel, with the show being called "Schmidt und Pocher".
In 2008 his third single "Bringt ihn heim“ (engl.: bring him home) was released. It is a song for the European Football Championship of 2008. The original version is Baschi's number one hit (Switzerland) “Bring en hei“ He acted as a co-trainer of the European Team during the DEL All Star Game in 2009. 
Pocher's contract was not renewed after April 2009, so he was hired by Sat.1 instead to present his own late night show, "Die Oliver Pocher Show". The show's ratings were always below the station's average and even slipping over the course of the run until it was cancelled in March 2011.
Criticism and scandals.
Oliver Pocher is widely criticised for his jokes at the expense of others. After he recommended plastic surgery to a woman of the audience of the "Wetten, dass..?" ("Wanna Bet..?") episode on the 22nd of January in 2005, he was sued for damages of 25,000 Euros. Although he apologized to her on the phone and repeated this apology in public during one of his shows, he was not able to solve this conflict out of court. On the 11th of January Pocher was sentenced by the district court of Hanover to pay a fine of 6000 euros. The judge in charge called Pocher’s statement (“You look quite old for your age”) a “very insulting comment”. The public insulting continued in January 2008 during the TV show "Johannes B. Kerner" when Pocher once again made fun of this woman’s appearance and mocked the verdict. As a result another suit was filed against the entertainer. The victim’s lawyer explained that the woman was insulted and that the topic is repeatedly brought up by people whom she meets during her work. Pocher did not comment on this. Statements as those made by Pocher could be legal in the future, as the Council of Europe is advising to decriminalize insults.
Pocher caused a scandal in July in 2005 during the ZDF (German broadcasting station) – show "Gottschalk & Friends" when he first insulted Mariah Carey and later accidentally spat water onto her. For this action he has been harshly criticised by some newspapers and by the broadcast station in charge. Gottschalk himself kept calm and commented upon the incident: "Of course I do not want to have jokes at the expense of others during my show and I do not want corpses to be carried away from the battlefield afterwards. If you invite Pocher to your show, however, you should expect a different atmosphere than with, for example, Alfred Biolek."
When Pocher mocked the personal life of singer Sarah Connor and her reality show, Connor sued Pocher. While the exact outcome of the lawsuit is not known, Pocher did apologize to Connor.
In January 2009, during the TV show “Schmidt & Pocher“, Pocher spoofed the Hitler assassin Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, who is portrayed by Tom Cruise in “Operation Walküre“. He had to face negative feedback for this and thereafter the broadcasting commission examined this incident.

Legal case management

The terms Legal case management (LCM) or matter management refer to a subset of law practice management and cover a range of approaches and technologies used by law firms and courts to leverage knowledge and methodologies for managing the life cycle of a case or matter more effectively. Generally, the terms refer to the sophisticated information management and workflow practices that are tailored to meet the legal field's specific needs and requirements. 
As attorneys and law firms compete for clients they are routinely challenged to deliver services at lower costs with greater efficiency, thus firms develop practice-specific processes and utilize contemporary technologies to assist in meeting such challenges. Law practice management processes and technologies include case and matter management, time and billing, litigation support, research, communication and collaboration, data mining and modeling, and data security, storage, and archive accessibility.
Case management software.
Legal case or matter management software has two primary functions: it helps to better use, manage, consolidate, share, and protect information, and it tracks and shapes the business process. Because the most useful forms of such software can integrate data from multiple systems, departments, users, and business entities, its use can increase a firm's business advantage. 
Case or matter management systems having the capacity to push and pull data over the Internet, whether within the software itself or within an integrated software framework or environment became an industry standard with the advent of the Lexis and Westlaw legal research platforms.
Case management software is marketed to specific segments of the legal marketplace, with some products designed for small firms and others for large multinational firms, and a few claim to be scalable to all. Cost-containment and competition concerns facing small-to-mid-size firms that cannot afford a full-time IT staff often drive custom solutions incorporating multiple integrated products. 
In-house legal departments.
In-house legal teams (in the public and private sectors) have their own needs: generally these require less emphasis on billing and accounts (since clients tend to be internal), and even more on traceability, real-time integration and configurability. The need to improve productivity of the team and reduce costs to taxpayers, or the business, is often a key driver. Some in-house teams have reduced their external legal bills by using case management software to increase their capacity and bring case work in-house.
Case management in the U.S. federal courts.
As electronic court systems continue to increase their online presence, many now require case filings to be accomplished electronically. Many legal software vendors' products include the ability to take advantage of such electronic filing by pulling data from the case management product and pushing it into court filing systems.
e-Discovery systems.
In litigation, the discovery process often results in enormous amounts of information that must be managed, and with the revision of the U.S. Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in 2006 to include electronic means of discovery came a new subset of case management systems that incorporated those changes, often dubbed 'electronic evidence' or 'e-discovery' management systems. Since the new rules took effect, e-Discovery firms as outside service vendors have flourished.
Case management and the regulation of mediation in Australia.
The term case management is also used to refer to systems in which court or tribunal officials assume closer administrative control over the litigation process than is traditionally associated with common law litigation. The Assisted Dispute Resolution program was introduced into the Federal Court in 1990 after a number of cases failed to reach resolutions having several directional hearings. In those cases the parties were not able to isolate the issues requiring determination. With the new program, judges can refer the parties to a court registrar for mediation. The following section was introduced into the Federal Court of Australia Act in 1991:
In Australia, mediation as an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) method is designed to avoid resorting to formal court-based adjudication and is now also being applied to criminal matters. Traditional theories of criminal justice view the matter as one between the offender and the state.
It is not necessary to have the parties consent to the mediation process and a judge can direct the mediation. In this sense, case management is designed to identify and define issues in dispute and to reduce delays, costs and unnecessary pre-trial activities.

1933 Sanriku earthquake

The was a major earthquake whose associated tsunami caused widespread damage to towns on the Sanriku coast of the Tōhoku region of Honshū, Japan on March 2, 1933.
History.
The epicenter of the 1933 Sanriku earthquake was located offshore, 
east of the city of Kamaishi, Iwate. The initial shock occurred at 0231 AM local time on March 3, 1933 (1731 GMT March 2, 1933). The earthquake measured 8.4 on the moment magnitude scale and was in approximately the same location as the 1896 Meiji-Sanriku earthquake. The epicenter occurred far enough away from the town that the earthquake itself did little damage to buildings. Approximately three hours after the main shock was a magnitude 6.8 aftershock, followed by 76 more aftershocks (with a magnitude of 5.0 or greater) over a period of six months.
This earthquake was an intraplate earthquake in the Pacific Plate. The focal mechanism of this earthquake showed that it was a normal faulting earthquake.
Damage.
Although the earthquake did little damage, the associated tsunami, which was recorded to reach the height of at Ōfunato, Iwate, caused extensive damage, destroyed many homes and caused numerous casualties The tsunami destroyed over 7,000 homes along the northern Japanese coastline, of which over 4,885 were washed away. The tsunami was also recorded in Hawaii with a height of , and which also resulted in slight damage. The death toll came to 1522 people confirmed dead, 1542 missing, and 12,053 injured. Hardest hit was the town of Tarō, Iwate (now part of Miyako city), with 98% of its houses destroyed and 42% of its population killed.

Derlingau

The Derlingau was an early medieval county ("Gau") of the Duchy of Saxony.
Geography.
The Derlingau approximately consisted of the area between the river Oker in the west and the Lappwald forest in the east. It was bordered by (from the north, clockwise): Bardengau, Gau Osterwald, Nordthüringgau, Harzgau, Salzgau, Hastfalagau, Gau Flutwide, Gau Gretinge. The most important town was Evessen, and later Brunswick. The Derlingau belonged to the diocese of the Bishop of Halberstadt. 
History.
Little is known about the history of the county. The Brunones were its most powerful family in the 10th and 11th centuries; when the Brunones became extinct, their properties were inherited by Lothair of Supplinburg, who became duke of Saxony and later Holy Roman Emperor. From Lothair, Duke Henry the Lion and his descendants, the dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg, inherited these properties. After the disintegration of the Duchy of Saxony in the early 13th century, the Derlingau thus became a core part of the new Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg, together with several adjacent counties. 
The northern border of the Derlingau later developed into part of the border between the principalities of Wolfenbüttel and Lüneburg. The eastern and southern border of the Derlingau continues to exist to this day as the border between Lower Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt.
The known counts in the Derlingau include:

Agriculture in Guinea

In Guinea in western Africa, only 2.6% of the country's arable land area is cultivated, yet agriculture accounts for 24% of the total GDP and employs 84% of the economically active population.
In 1999, the main subsistence crops were manioc, 812,000 tons; rice, 750,000 tons; sweet potatoes, 135,000 tons; yams, 89,000 tons; and corn, 89,000 tons. The economy of Guinea also depends on cash crops such as sugarcane, citrus fruits, bananas, pineapples, peanuts, palm kernels, coffee, and coconuts. In 1999, an estimated 429,000 tons of plantains, 220,000 tons of sugarcane, 215,000 tons of citrus fruits, 150,000 tons of bananas, 174,000 tons of peanuts, 52,000 tons of palm kernels, and 18,000 tons of coconuts were produced. Coffee production in Guinea has fluctuated over time due to illegal coffee smuggling that affected the industry before the country's reforms in the early 1980s. In 1999 production of coffee beans was estimated at 21,000 tons, compared to 14,000 tons on average annually from 1979 to 1981. 
Attempts at price fixation affected agriculture in Guinea in the 1970s and 1980s since the independence. The French has reduced their influence in plantations and the removal of the French tariff had affected production in the 1970s at a time when drought was prevalent. During the 1970s and early 1980s, food production declined and agricultural exports fell markedly. In 1984, a year when drought seriously affected Guinea, 186,000 tons of cereal had to be imported to prevent starvation. However, since 1985, free market policies have advocated the decentralisation of state owned plantations and government owned agricultural produce towards localized private smallholders. There are as many as 500,000 operating in Guinea by the late 1990s which reportedly yielded twice as much as the agricultural output than state owned agriculture did in 1970s, even without financial assistance.

National Federation of Advanced Information Services

National Federation of Advanced Information Services (NFAIS) is a United States non-profit institutional membership organization of content and technology providers, specifically those that support the authoritative information needs and activities of professionals across a spectrum of scholarly disciplines and fields of research. The organization provides analysis, news alerts and educational services to its more than sixty members. The NFAIS headquarters are in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Formation and growth.
In 1957, the former Soviet Union launched the world’s first spacecraft, Sputnik. This event generated a wave of intense competition in science and technology in the industrialized nations, but one of the rationales offered publicly to Western politicians at the time was that the Soviets had leapt ahead in the space race because they had a more unified and orderly approach to the organization and dissemination of scientific knowledge. Even more importantly, it was believed that science and technology had won World War II and that science and technology would maintain the peace. Therefore, one specific area of attention was enhanced dissemination of the scientific literature to maximize awareness of research and investigation already undertaken. At this time, such activities were documented through the scientific journal and through abstracting and indexing services. In 1958, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower directed the National Science Foundation to ensure the provision of indexing, abstracting, translation, and other information retrieval services as a way of ensuring a constant flow of consistently high-quality information to those working in scientific research facilities.
As the United States mobilized to create a new information infrastructure for the promotion of scientific innovation, G. Miles Conrad, Director of Biological Abstracts (now BIOSIS, part of the Thomson Reuters corporation), called an urgent meeting of fourteen leading not-for-profit and government scientific abstracting and indexing (A&I) services. Such services play a major role in managing the flow of scientific and scholarly communication and have done so since 1665 with the launch of Journal des Scavans. The attending representatives agreed to a model for information dissemination that drew upon the strengths of both scholarly associations of scientists and researchers and government agencies. By working collaboratively, their efforts would support national scientific initiatives as well as promote the international advancement of science. In 1958, convinced of the value of mutual interaction and the interchange of ideas and expertise, a new organization–the National Federation of Science Abstracting and Indexing Services (NFSAIS)–was formed. The organization in its earliest years provided reliable statistical information on journal publication activities, on overlap of information services, cost data, and the status of scientific information dissemination in other countries.
The Federation expanded its scope in 1972 to encompass information producers outside of the scientific and technology sector and dropped "science" from its name, becoming the National Federation of Abstracting and Indexing Services. Eligibility for membership was widened in 1981 to include the private for-profit sector. The Federation expanded its scope further into the information community in 1982 and changed its name to National Federation of Abstracting and Information Services. Reflecting the advancement of technology and the emergence of the Internet, as well as the changing nature of how research information is collected and archived, the name of the organization became the National Federation of Advanced Information Services in 2007. The most current listing of the membership may be found at: http://www.nfais.org/members/list_of_members.cfm
Activities and awards.
NFAIS, as an organization, continues its contribution to the information community by:
Its most prestigious award is the Miles Conrad Lecture given annually to “…an outstanding person on a suitable topic in the field of abstracting and indexing, but above the level of any individual service.” The first lecture was given in 1968 by Robert W. Cairns, Chairman of the Committee on Scientific and Technical Communication of the National Academy of Sciences-National Academy of Engineering. The series has continued unbroken since that time to honor those who have made significant contributions to information science and who have been supporters of NFAIS. A full list of the Miles Conrad Lecture recipients is available.
In 1983, NFAIS created the title of Honorary Fellow to recognize those who have made significant contributions to NFAIS and no longer work for a member organization. This honorary designation has been awarded every year since then. A full list of those so honored by NFAIS may be found at:

Agriculture in Niger

Agriculture is the primary economic activity of a majority of Niger's 13 million citizens.
The agricultural economy is based largely upon internal markets, subsistence agriculture, and the export of raw commodities: food stuffs and cattle to neighbors. Niger, a landlocked Sub-Sahara African nation, and over the past two decades has consistently been ranked near or at the bottom of worldwide indexes of the Human development index, GDP, and per capita income. Economic activity centres on subsistence agriculture, animal husbandry, re-export trade, and export of uranium. The 50% devaluationi love 1d. in January 1994 boosted exports of livestock, cowpeas, onions, and the products of Niger's small cotton industry. Exports of cattle to neighboring Nigeria, as well as Groundnuts and their oil remain the primary non-mineral exports.
Overall economy.
Niger's economy is based largely on subsistence crops, livestock, and some of the world's largest uranium deposits. Drought cycles, desertification, a 3.4% population growth rate and the drop in world demand for uranium have undercut an already marginal economy. Traditional subsistence farming, herding, small trading, and informal markets dominate an economy that generates few formal sector jobs. Between 1988 and 1995 28% to 30% of the total economy of Niger was in the unregulated Informal sector, including small and even large scale rural and urban production, transport and services. Current GDP per capita is very low by world standards, in part explained through the involvement of a majority of the population in very small scale agriculture, which generates little monetary exchange.
Geography.
A majority of Niger's population rural residents engaged in crop tending are clustered in the south centre and south west of the nation, in those areas (the Sahel) which can expect to receive between 300mm to 600mm of rainfall annually. A small area in the southern tip of the nation, surrounding Gaya can expect to receive 700mm to 900mm or rainfall. Northern areas which support crops, such as the southern portions of the Aïr Massif and the Kaouar oasis rely upon oases and a slight increase in rainfall due to mountain effects. Large portions of the northwest and far east of the nation, while within the Sahara desert, see just enough seasonal rainfall to support semi-nomadic animal husbandry. The populations of these areas, mostly Tuareg, Wodaabe - Fula, and Toubou, practise Transhumance: traveling south to pasture and sell animals in the dry season, north into the Sahara in the brief rainy season, while maintaining settled communities along these routes.
Agriculture production.
Niger's agricultural and livestock sectors are the mainstay of all but 18% of the population. Fourteen percent of Niger's GDP is generated by livestock production (camels, goats, sheep and cattle), said to support 29% of the population. Thus 53% of the population is actively involved in crop production. The 15% of Niger's land that is arable is found mainly along its southern border with Nigeria.
Pearl millet, sorghum, and cassava are Niger's principal rain-fed subsistence crops. Irrigated rice for internal consumption, while expensive, has, since the devaluation of the CFA franc, sold for below the price of imported rice, encouraging additional production. Cowpeas and onions are grown for commercial export, as are small quantities of garlic, peppers, potatoes, and wheat.
Drought and environmental degradation.
Rainfall varies and when insufficient, Niger has difficulty feeding its population and must rely on grain purchases and food aid to meet food requirements. Rains, as in much of the Sahel, have been marked by annual variability. This has been especially true in the 20th century, with the most severe drought on record beginning in the late 1960s and lasting, with one break, well into the 1980s. The long term effect of this, especially to pastoralist populations remains in the 21st century, with those communities which rely upon cattle, sheep, and camels husbandry losing entire herds more than once during this period. Recent rains remain variable. For instance, the rains in 2000 were not good, those in 2001 were plentiful and well distributed.
Food shortfalls have also been caused by other factors. Market prices driven up by drought and a plague of desert locust in 2005–2006 caused a major food crisis in parts of the nation.
Shortage of good farmland has led to a number of innovations to farm marginal, often laterite soils and soil degraded by overfarming, wind, desertification, and drought. Women in particular are often given poor plots of land (in inherited sections known as ""Gamana"") to garden, and have developed specific crops for poor soil and water conditions. These typically include ocra and malahiya. External organisations have tried introducing alternative crops, such as the fruit of the Ziziphus mauritania tree (""Indian Jujube"", marketed by ICRISAT under the name of ""Pomme du Sahel"" or Sahel Apple) and the leaves and seeds of the Moringa oleifera. Farmers use specialty water conservation techniques, "water microcatchments" or planting pits known as "zai holes", planting of crops among certain trees, planting in raised beds, drip irrigation, and usage of water collected in the natural stone bottomed low areas common in the south east of the nation. This approach has been termed the Bioreclamation of Degraded Lands. 
Market effects.
While Nigerien farmers are often dependent on the agricultural market for portions of their production and consumption, much of Nigerien farming is subsistence agriculture outside the marketplace. The 2006 Human Development Index ranked Niger sixth from worst in the world, with a HDI of 0.370: 174 of 179 nations.
Groundnuts, and to a lesser degree Cotton, introduced by former colonial power France in the 1930s and 1950s respectively, account for most of the world market for Nigerien industrial agriculture. Prior to the mass exploitation of uranium in the early 1970s, groundnut oil was the largest Nigerien export by worth.
External trade and investment in agriculture.
Of Niger's exports, foreign exchange earnings from livestock, although difficult to quantify, are second only to those from uranium. Actual exports far exceed official statistics, which often fail to detect large herds of animals informally crossing into Nigeria. Some hides and skins are exported and some are transformed into handicrafts. Hausa areas in the south center of the nation are especially known for their leather industries. Zinder and Maradi are two foci of leatherwork and trade.

Needles Ferry

The Needles Ferry is a cable ferry across Lower Arrow Lake in British Columbia, Canada. It is situated south of Nakusp and links Needles and Fauquier.
Operation.
The ferry operates under contract to the British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and is free of tolls. It travels back and forth every thirty minutes, from the first departure at 5am until the last departure at 10pm, with a crossing time of about five minutes. The ferry has capacity for 30 vehicles and 144 passengers. 
The ferry is diesel powered and pulls using a winding drum on a pair of cables, plastic coated to prevent wear, which are suspended in the lake. The crossing is about in length.
History.
A ferry has been in operation from Needles since 1913. Early farmers built the first ferry using Ford Model T parts. A small community in Needles, which pre-dated the ferry, was an area of fruit trees and scrub farming. Farmers provided fruit and vegetables to the mines of the Lardeau district (between Upper Arrow Lake and the head of Kootenay Lake). Canadian Pacific Railway lake steamers connected the farms to Arrowhead and Robson. The valley was flooded in the late 1960s by the construction of the Hugh Keenleyside Dam at Castlegar in the 1960s, leading people to abandon the town, after being expropriated from the lakeshore by Hydro. The ferry landing and a small cemetery are all that remain. 
Fauquier is the "centre" of the area that includes Edgewood and Burton with a few houses, gas station and grocery store.

Tsultrim Allione

Tsultrim Allione is an author and teacher who has studied in the Tibetan Buddhist lineage. She was born in 1947 in Maine under the name Joan Rousmanière Ewing. She first travelled to India and Nepal in 1967, returned in 1969 and in 1970 she became one of the first American women to be ordained as a Tibetan nun. She was given her vows by the Karmapa, from the Karma Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism, who gave her the name Karma Tsultrim Chodron. Allione gave back her monastic vows four years later and married. She has given birth to four children, one of whom died from sudden infant death syndrome. Tsultrim Allione continued her studies and Buddhist practice, which led to the 1984 publication of her book "Women of Wisdom", a collection of the namtar of six Tibetan Buddhist yogini as Machig Labdrön (founder of the Chöd practice), Ayu Khadro Dorje Paldron (1839–1953), Nangsa Obum, Jomo Menmo (1248–1283), Machig Ongjo and Drenchen Rema. This is the work she's most well known for and it has since been translated from English into several foreign languages and expanded in a revised 2nd edition. In 1993, with her husband, David Petit, Tsultrim Allione founded Tara Mandala, a retreat center in southern Colorado, in the United States. As well as offering retreats at Tara Mandala, Allione regularly teaches in the United States and in Europe.
In 2008 Tsultrim Allione's book "Feeding Your Demons" was published, an approach based on the Chöd lineage of Machig Labdrön that Allione has practiced since 1973. Allione opens chapter five of the book by quoting Carl Jung as saying "One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light but by making the darkness conscious."
Mark Epstein has described her work as "a book that Carl Jung could only have dreamed of writing."
Allione claims that the "process of feeding our demons is a method for bringing our shadow into consciousness and accessing the treasures it holds rather than repressing it."
Recognition as emanation.
In Tibetan Buddhism it is believed that once beings such as Machig Labdrön attain enlightenment, they are no longer subject to the limitation of one body and may emanate into many different dimensions and forms. An emanation continues the work of the original incarnation. In May and June 2007 Tsultrim Allione led a pilgrimage to Nepal and Tibet which included a visit to Sangri Khangmar (Sangri County) where Machig Labdrön lived from the age of 37 to 99. At the site, she was recognized as an emanation of Machig Labdrön by the resident Lama, Karma Dorje Rinpoche, the 7th incarnation of the brother of Mikyö Dorje, the 8th Karmapa. Lama Karma Nyitön Kunkhyab Chökyi Dorje offered Allione a self-arisen golden crystal phurba (ceremonial dagger), the only remaining tsa tsa made from the ashes of Machig's body (a mixture of clay and ash imprinted with an image of Machig dancing), texts of Machig's teachings, a hat with symbolic meaning designed by Machig, and various other treasures. Allione was also independently recognised as Machig's emanation in Nepal by Lama Tsering Wangdu Rinpoche, holder of the lineage of Dampa Sangye (who had worked with Machig Labdrön to establish the Chod practice in Tibet in the 11th Century). Commenting on the recognition as Machig Labdrön, Tsultrim Allione said she thought the purpose wasto make this new phase of collecting Machig's lineage more empowered. Recognition allows more energy to flow, and Machig's blessings can manifest more fully. It's a kind of mirroring from the outside validating our heartfelt intention to reinvigorate and spread Machig's lineage in the West. It also felt very natural. We will keep doing what we have been doing already, but the recognition creates an auspicious interdependence for the teachings. 
Teachers.
Tsultrim Allione has studied under a number of Nyingma and Kagyu teachers. Besides the 16th Karmapa (her root Lama) Allione's teachers have been: Sapchu Rinpoche, Abu Rinpoche, Kalu Rinpoche, Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche, Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche and Adzom Rinpoche.

Patio Lanterns

"Patio Lanterns" is a song by Kim Mitchell that was first released as a single in June 1986 and later appeared in the 1986 album "Shakin' Like a Human Being". An acoustic recording of the song was released as a single in 1995 and also included in the album "Greatest Hits" released the same year.
By 1996, the song had been broadcast on Canadian radio stations more than 100,000 times. "Patio Lanterns", "Alana Loves Me", "Easy To Tame" and other songs from Mitchell's repertoire have been credited for his increasing exposure in 1980s and 1990s Top 40 AM radio in Canada.
The song was reviewed by "Billboard" in the 21 June 1986 issue, and was described as "contorted imagery presented in a Jackson Browne soundalike manner". In 2008, Lynn Peppas of the Welland Tribune stated that "Patio Lanterns" and other Mitchell songs ("Go for Soda", "All We Are", and "Rock 'n' Roll Duty") are "timeless summer rock anthems".
The song debuted on Billboard's album rock tracks on 26 July 1986 at position 50. It peaked at position 36 for two weeks, and remained on the Billboard album rock tracks chart for six weeks. For the week ending 14 August 1986, the song had reached #20 on "The Record" charts in Canada.
In the article "Across the Great Divide", author Barry Grant states that Canadian rock and roll differentiates itself from American rock and roll by its use of ironic subversiveness applied to the pop culture American genre. Jeannette Sloniowski and Joan Nicks state that Patio Lanterns fit that model, one of the few songs by popular Canadian rock musicians to do so.
The music video created for the song has been described as "a lighthearted piece". It includes concert footage commingled with "conceptual sequences centering on a summer patio party". It was directed by Stephen Reynolds, produced by Allan Weinrib, and edited by Chris Cooper.
The song has been included in various compilations, including "", "BBQ Rock", "Greatest Hits: Fill Your Head with Rock", "Now! 1980's", and "Canada 24: Rock Your Cottage Weekend ".

Samuel Amory was one of the founding partners of the law firm of Travers Smith.
London-born Amory married Ann Heathcote, the daughter of the well-known and highly successful industrialist John Heathcote (born 1783), known for inventing lace-making machinery in Nottingham.
Amory qualified as a lawyer in London in 1810, and went into partnership with John Coles, which lasted until 1839 when John became ill, and he was paid out his capital in installments. A short partnership with Isaac Sewell and Samuel Moores lasted only for 11 years.
Samuel and Ann had two children, John (born 1829) and Ann (born 18xx). John, who took the surname Heathcote-Amory, became a very eminent landowner in Somerset and the owner of a rather splendid estate known as Knighthayes. He was later knighted. 
Ann married John Travers, a member of the most famous produce family in the City of London, which remained a client of her father's legal practice for over 50 years. Following marriage into the Smith family, Joseph Travers Smith joined Amory's practice in 1851, later becoming the senior partner and giving his name to the firm, which is still practicing today.

Mikal Peder Olaus Sylten (1873 – 1964) was a Norwegian writer.
Originally a typographer, from 1916 he published a periodical, "Nationalt Tidsskrift". It was staunchly anti-semitic, and Sylten took up the swastika as a symbol in 1917, three years before Adolf Hitler chose to do so. He also published a pamphlet called "Hvem er hvem i jødeverdenen", "Who's Who in the Jewish World", in 1925. In it, Sylten catalogued Jews or presumed Jews in Norway. New editions followed in 1932, 1938 and 1941.
Because of his interest in Jewish affairs, Sylten was used as a consultant for the national socialist authorities during the German occupation of Norway. He also enrolled in Nasjonal Samling, at that time the only legal party, on 1 March 1942. However, he was described as an "outsider" and was never directly active in the party. He had some contact with other anti-Semitic publishers, such as Alf Amble who ran the periodical "Vår kamp".
As part of the legal purge in Norway after World War II, Sylten was sentenced to fifteen months of forced labour. In addition, his periodical was stopped. He emigrated to Sweden in 1964, and died the same year.

City Road Lock

City Road Lock is a lock on the Regent's Canal, in the London Borough of Islington, England. It is located a short distance to the east of Islington Tunnel, and immediately to the west of City Road Basin.
History.
The Grand Junction Canal reached Paddington Basin in 1801, and various suggestions to link it to the River Thames further to the east were made. Plans for the Regents Canal, from Paddington to Limehouse were eventually agreed, and an Act of Parliament to authorise construction was obtained on 13 July 1812. The canal opened as far as Camden Town in 1816, but a ridge of higher ground lay between this point and City Road Lock, through which a tunnel had to be driven. Work started on the tunnel, but the company had insufficient funds to continue and work stopped. Charles Munro, the chairman of the canal company prior to 1816 succeeded in brokering a deal with the Exchequer Bill Loan Commissioners, who loaned £200,000 to help completion of the canal. Work resumed in December 1817, and the canal opened on 1 August 1820. One of the main events of the opening ceremony was the arrival of boats from Manchester, which passed through the lock to reach City Road Basin immediately to the east, discharged their cargoes, and set off again to return to the north.
The lock was well-used, since City Road Basin proved to be much more convenient for goods reaching London than Paddington Basin, and made a huge contribution to the prosperity of the company. Firms moved there from Paddington, including the carriers Pickfords, and it became a distribution centre into central London. The area around the lock became congested, because of the time it took for boats to pass through the adjacent tunnel, but this was partially relieved in 1830, when a towing boat was installed, which wound its way along a chain attached to the bottom of the canal.

Howard Staunton Memorial Tournament

The Howard Staunton Memorial Tournament was an annual chess tournament held between 2003 and 2009 in honour of the English chess player Howard Staunton (1810-1874).
History.
Staunton Memorial tournaments had previously been held in 1946 (Groningen, Mikhail Botvinnik won) and in 1951 (Cheltenham - Lemington Spa - Birmingham, Svetozar Gligorić won). The latter commemorated the one hundred years that had passed since the London 1851 chess tournament, a landmark event in Staunton's life. 
The first edition of the modern series was played in 2003 at Simpson's-in-the-Strand, London, England to mark its 175th birthday; subsequent editions were also held there. Simpson's-in-the-Strand is a restaurant which Staunton regularly visited in the 19th century to play and discuss chess (it was then a coffee house known as "The Divan" or "Simpson's Divan"). In 1851, it was the venue of the famous "Immortal Game", played between Adolf Anderssen and Lionel Kieseritzky. 
The first three editions of the tournament were played as a four-player double round-robin. The fourth and fifth edition saw an expansion to twelve participants, contesting a single round robin. The 2008 tournament was the strongest to be held in London since 1986.
Implementing a further change in 2009, the organizers split the event into two groups, the main attraction being a double round "Scheveningen" format and the other, a single round "all-play-all" won by Jan Timman of the Netherlands, ahead of Viktor Korchnoi, among others.
Funding for the tournament ceased in 2009 and so 2010's event comprised only a celebratory Dinner and pro-am exhibition game held to raise funds for Anatoly Karpov's FIDE Presidential campaign. Garry Kasparov and Nigel Short were just two of the guests who participated in the event.
Winners.
Below is the list of winners of the Memorial tournament. The names of winners who have taken the trophy on tie-break are shown in bold typeface.

In its later editions, the tournament also doubled as a "UK versus Netherlands" match, although the UK team sometimes comprised a mix of home players and overseas guests. The Netherlands won the matches of 2006, 2007 and 2008, while The UK won the match held in 2009.

Photo-Dember

In semiconductor physics, the photo-Dember effect (named after its discoverer Harry Dember ) consists in the formation of a charge dipole in the vicinity of a semiconductor surface after ultra-fast photo-generation of charge carriers. The dipole forms owing to the difference of mobilities (or diffusion constants) for holes and electrons which combined with the break of symmetry provided by the surface lead to an effective charge separation in the direction perpendicular to the surface. In an isolated sample, where the macroscopic flow of an electric current is prohibited, the fast carriers (often the electrons) are slowed down and the slow carriers (often the holes) are accelerated by an electric field, called the Dember field.
One of the main applications of photo-Dember effect is the generation of terahertz (THz) radiation pulses for terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. This effect is present in most semiconductors but it is particularly strong in narrow-gap semiconductors (mainly arsenides and antimonides) such as InAs and InSb owing to their high electron mobility. The photo-Dember terahertz emission should not be confused with the surface field emission, which occurs if the surface energy bands of a semiconductor fall between its valence and conduction bands, which produces a phenomenon known as Fermi level pinning, causing, at its time, band bending and consequently the formation of a depletion or accumulation layer close to the surface which contributes to the acceleration of charge carriers. These two effects can contribute constructively or destructively for the dipole formation depending on the direction of the band-bending.

<doc id="18466387" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18466387" title="Life of Christ">
Life of Christ

The Life of Christ as a narrative cycle in Christian art comprises a number of different subjects, which were often grouped in series or cycles of works in a variety of media, narrating the life of Jesus on earth, as distinguished from the many other subjects in art showing the eternal life of Christ, such as Christ in Majesty, and also many types of portrait or devotional subjects without a narrative element. Most of the subjects forming the narrative cycles have also been the subjects of individual works, though with greatly varying frequency.
The most common subjects were grouped around the birth and childhood of Jesus, and the Passion of Christ, leading to his Crucifixion and Resurrection. Many cycles covered only one of these groups, and others combined the Life of the Virgin with that of Jesus. Subjects showing the life of Jesus during his active life as a teacher, before the days of the Passion, were relatively few in medieval art, for a number of reasons. From the Renaissance, and in Protestant art, the number of subjects increased considerably, but cycles in painting became rarer, though they remained common in prints and especially book illustrations.
Most common scenes.
The main scenes found in art during the Middle Ages are:
Birth and childhood sequence.
These scenes also could form part of cycles of the "Life of the Virgin":
Choice of scenes.
After the Early Christian period, the selection of scenes to illustrate was led by the occasions celebrated as Feasts of the Church, and those mentioned in the Nicene Creed, both of which were given prominence by the devotional writers on whose works many cycles appear to be based. Of these, the "Vita Christi" ("Life of Christ") by Ludolph of Saxony and the "Meditations on the Life of Christ" by the Pseudo-Bonaventura were two of the most popular from the 14th century onwards. Another influence, especially in smaller churches, was liturgical drama, and no doubt also those scenes which lent themselves to a readily identifiable image tended to be preferred. The miracles of Christ did not score well on any of these counts. In Byzantine art written names or titles were commonly included in the background of scenes in art; this was much less often done in the Early Medieval West, probably not least because few laymen would have been able to read them and understand the Latin. The difficulties this could cause are shown in the 12 small narrative scenes from the Gospel of Luke in the 6th century St. Augustine Gospels; about a century after the book was created captions were added to these images by a monk, which may already misidentify one scene. However, some miracles commonly used as paradigms for Christian doctrines were represented, especially the "Wedding at Cana" and "Raising of Lazarus", which were both easy to recognise as images. Paintings in hospitals were more likely to show scenes of the miraculous cures. An exception is St Mark's Basilica in Venice where a 12th-century cycle of mosaics originally had 29 scenes of the miracles (now 27), probably derived from a Greek gospel book. Devotional practices such as the Stations of the Cross also influenced selection. 
The scenes originating in the apocryphal Gospels that remain a feature of the depiction of "Life of the Virgin" have fewer equivalents in the "Life of Christ", although some minor details, like the boys climbing trees in the "Entry to Jerusalem", are tolerated. The Harrowing of Hell was not an episode witnessed or mentioned by any of the Four Evangelists but was approved by the Church, and the Lamentation of Christ, though not specifically described in the Gospels, was thought to be implied by the accounts there of the episodes before and after. Vernacular art was less policed by the clergy, and works such as some medieval tiles from Tring can show fanciful apocryphal legends that either never appeared in church art, or were destroyed at some later date.
By the Gothic period the selection of scenes was at its most standardized. Emile Mâle's famous study of 13th century French cathedral art analyses many cycles, and discusses the lack of emphasis on the "public life is dismissed in four scenes, the Baptism, the Marriage at Cana, the Temptation and the Transfiguration, which moreover it is rare to find all together".
Cycles.
Early Christian art contains a number of narrative scenes collected on sarcophagi and in paintings in the Catacombs of Rome. Miracles are very often shown, but the Crucifixion is absent until the 5th century, when it originated in Palestine, soon followed by the Nativity in much the form still seen in Orthodox icons today. The "Adoration of the Magi" and the "Baptism" are both often found earlier, but the choice of scenes is very variable.
The only Late Antique monumental cycles to have survived are in mosaic: Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome has a cycle from 432–430 on the birth and infancy of Christ together with other scenes from the "Life of the Virgin", the dedicatee of the church. Sant'Appollinare Nuovo in Ravenna has cycles on opposite walls of the "Works" and "Passion" of Christ from the early 6th century. The "Passion" is notable for still not containing, among its thirteen scenes, a Crucifixion, and the "Works" contains eight miracles in its thirteen scenes. Neither of these features was to be typical of later art, but they are comparable to features of cycles in smaller objects of the period such as carved caskets and a gold pendant medallion of the late 6th century.
For the rest of the Early Medieval period illuminated manuscripts contain the only painted scenes to have survived in quantity, though many scenes have survived from the applied arts, especially ivories, and some in cast bronze. The period of Christ's "Works" still seems relatively prominent compared to the High Middle Ages. Although this was the period when the Gospel book was the main type of manuscript to receive lavish illumination in this period, the emphasis was on depicting Evangelist portraits, and relatively few contained narrative cycles; these are in fact more common in psalters and other types of book, especially from the Romanesque period. Where there were cycles of illustrations in illuminated manuscripts, these were normally collected together at the start of the book, or of the Gospels, rather than appearing throughout the text at the relevant places, something hardly found in Western manuscripts at all, and slow to develop in printed bibles. In the East this was more common; the 6th century Byzantine Sinope Gospels has an unframed miniature at the bottom of every surviving page, and this style of illustrating the Gospels continued to be found in later Greek Gospel books, compelling the artist to devote more pictures to the "Works". Scenes with miracles were more often found in cycles of the "life of Saint Peter" and other apostles, from late antique sarcophagi to the Raphael Cartoons.
In painting, the "Life" was often shown on one side of a church, paired with Old Testament scenes on the other, the latter usually chosen for pre-figuring the New Testament scene according to the theory of typology. Such schemes were later called the Poor Man's Bible (and in book form the Biblia Pauperum) by art historians, and were very common, though most have now vanished. After stained-glass became important in Gothic art, this medium was also used, usually with a small medallion for each scene, requiring a very compressed composition. The frescos on the walls of the Sistine Chapel showing the Lives of Christ and Moses are an unusual variant. From the 15th century prints had first scenes, then whole cycles, which were also one of the most common subjects for blockbooks. Albrecht Dürer produced a total of three print cycles of the "Passion of Christ": large (7 scenes before 1500, with a further 5 in 1510) and small (36 scenes in 1510) cycles in woodcut, and one in engraving (16 scenes, 1507–12). These were distributed all over Europe, and often used as patterns by less ambitious painters. Hans Memling's "Scenes from the Passion of Christ" and "Advent and Triumph of Christ" are examples of a large number of scenes, in these case over twenty, shown in a single bird's eye view image of Jerusalem; another is illustrated here.
In Protestant areas production of paintings of the "Life" stopped very soon after the Reformation, but prints and book illustrations were acceptable, as free from the suspicion of idolatry. Nonetheless, there were surprisingly few cycles of the "Life". Lucas Cranach the Elder made a famous propaganda set of the "Passion of Christ and Antichrist" (1521), where 13 matched pairs of woodcuts contrasted a scene from the "Life" with an anti-Catholic scene. But otherwise scenes from the Old Testament and parables were more often seen.
Parables.
Of the thirty or so parables of Jesus in the canonical Gospels, four were shown in medieval art almost to the exclusion of the others, but not normally mixed in with the narrative scenes of the "Life". These were: the Wise and Foolish Virgins, Dives and Lazarus, the Prodigal Son and the Good Samaritan. The Labourers in the Vineyard also appear in Early Medieval works.
From the Renaissance the numbers shown widened slightly, and the three main scenes of the Prodigal Son – the high living, herding the pigs, and the return – became the clear favourites. Albrecht Dürer made a famous engraving of the Prodigal Son amongst the pigs (1496), a popular subject in the Northern Renaissance, and Rembrandt depicted the story several times, although in at least one of his works, "The Prodigal Son in the Tavern", a portrait of himself "as" the Son, revelling with his wife, is like many artists' depictions, a way of dignifying a genre tavern scene. His late "Return of the Prodigal Son" (1662, Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg) is one of his most popular works.

Nielsen cooperated with the short-lived National Socialist Workers' Party of Norway (Norges Nasjonalsosialistiske Arbeiderparti), and was as such critical to the rivalling national socialist party Nasjonal Samling. With Nasjonal Samling seizing power in Norway in the autumn of 1940, during the German occupation of Norway, "Fronten" eventually ceased to exist. Nielsen continued as an Anti-Masonry consultant for the Sicherheitsdienst.

Helicon Home Colony

Helicon Home Colony was an experimental community formed by author Upton Sinclair in Englewood, New Jersey, United States, with proceeds from his novel "The Jungle". Established in 1906, it burned down in 1907 and was disbanded.
In a 1906 article in "The Independent", Sinclair outlined a plan for a home colony located within one-hour of New York City. Following the model proposed by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Sinclair sought "authors, artists, and musicians, editors and teachers and professional men" who wanted to avoid the drudgeries of domestic life. A farm community would be established that would generate its own meat, milk and produce. Food would be served in a communal kitchen and children raised in separate nurseries. The community would be run by a board of directors. While Sinclair insisted that the project was not a Socialist one, he did think that those interested in participating "would have to be in sympathy with the spirit of socialism". Sinclair planned for about 100 houses on a lot, and would get proposals for architects and business experts to create a business plan for the endeavor.
In a letter published in "The New York Times" on July 16, 1906, Sinclair outlined his plan and announced a public meeting to be held the following evening at the Berkeley Lyceum on 44th Street. Employed individuals would join a cooperative and build homes of their own design that would not have kitchens or space for children. The community would use machinery to increase efficiency and "solve the problem of the management of servants". The community would be run by a democratically-elected board and would own enough land to produce as much of its own food as possible. Children would be cared for separately and overseen by a Board of Women Directors elected by their mothers. Lecture halls, reading rooms and other common facilities would be provided.
"The Times" published an editorial the next day, supportive of the meeting and noting the difficulties of raising a family in the city. However, the editors raised concerns that the funds needed to purchase land in proximity to New York City would require substantial outlays beyond the means of most. The editorial questioned the practicability of raising children on a communal basis, noting that "There would be more fun in that spectacle -- for outsiders -- than in the traditional barrel of monkeys."
Some 300 people attend the public meeting on July 17. Sinclair led the two-hour meeting and spoke for three-quarters of the session. It was agreed that women who paid the $10 initiation fee would be eligible to vote. Sinclair stated that he had offers of suitable land in the New York City area at $10 to $50 per acre, refuting claims made in the editorial in "The Times" that appropriate land would cost as much as $3,000 to $40,000 an acre. Gaylord Wilshire was named temporary treasurer, and Sinclair announced that commitments of $50,000 had already been made. Sinclair reviewed the responses he had received to a questionnaire he had distributed nationwide, receiving 44 responses, including one from a meat packer in Brooklyn. In addition to details on the types and manner of food to be served in the proposed colony, respondents indicated that they preferred to be close to New York City, preferably in New Jersey.

Southern Mississippi to the Top

"Southern Miss To The Top" is the official fight song of the University of Southern Mississippi. It was penned in 1955 by Robert Hays, the assistant director of "The Pride of Mississippi Marching Band".
It is performed by the Pride of Mississippi Marching Band after every Southern Mississippi touchdown or field goal, and is an instrumental aspect of any Southern Mississippi athletic or academic event.
History and usage.
Originally titled "Southern To The Top", the fight song was written as a closer for the first act of "Hey Daze", a three-act musical based on student life at then Mississippi Southern College. The song has retained its popularity so long, that it has been echoed at athletic contests for over 40 years. The song was eventually renamed "Southern Miss To The Top" to reflect the universities popular nickname known as "Southern Miss".
Lyrics:
Southern Mississippi to the top! To the top!
So lift your voices high,
Show them the reason why,
that Southern spirit never will stop.
FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!
Southern Mississippi all the way,
Banners high,
And we will fight! Fight! Fight! To victory
Hear our battle cry!
GO EAGLES!
GO EAGLES!

Ilkley Grammar School

Ilkley Grammar School (IGS) is a co-educational secondary school in Ilkley, West Yorkshire, England, that specialises in humanities and sciences. In 2011 it gained academy status. 
History.
Early years.
The earliest record of a school in Ilkley dates from 1575, with an examination of the religious beliefs of one Constantine Harrison, schoolmaster, by the church. An endowment of £100 was made by George Marshall in 1601 to fund the salary of a schoolmaster - at the time, one William Lobley. Payments to Lobley were fitful, and the executors of Marshall's estate had to go to law to rectify the situation; the date of settlement of the issues - 1607 - is now taken as the date of origination of the school.
On 2 January 1635, a group of townspeople signed an undertaking to erect a dedicated schoolhouse, and records indicate that by April 1637 such a thing had been built. The building, in Church Street, still exists and is now a listed building, converted into a shop.
A further endowment of £200 was made by Reginald Heber in 1697 - £100 to the school and the same to the parish. However there were complaints over the next 150 years that the proceeds of the endowments were being diverted by successive vicars of Ilkley to other ends, and that the school was underfunded. Its curriculum, according to a report by the Brougham Commission in 1829, was free tuition in reading English, and the teaching of writing and accounts for a small fee. An 1860 report was more scathing; it alleged that few of the children at the school at that time could write or perform elementary sums; the school building and the admission policy were criticised, and the report concluded that the endowments' requirement for free access to all of the town's children "has done much to hinder the establishment of a good school, either for the poor, or the trading middle class, both of whom are greatly in need of one". The school closed down a short time after this report. Proposals by charity commissioners to restart the school as a fee-paying entity were resisted by the town, and came to nothing.
Fee-paying school.
After the passing of the Elementary Education Act 1870, Ilkley elected to avoid the formation of a school board (which would be entitled to levy rates on the population for the provision of schooling facilities) and instead launched a successful voluntary subscription for the erection of new school buildings, opened in July 1872, and known as the All Saints National Schools.
In the same period, under power given in the Endowed Schools Act 1869 to revise the terms and beneficiaries of endowments, a plan was drawn up by an assistant commissioner under the act to divert a number of endowments for the poor of the parish to fund a new school. The plan, for a school for circa 60 boys, paying fees of from £4 to £10 (or up to £40 for boarding), received assent in June 1872. The fruition of the plans was slow; the site of the current school was purchased in 1881 for £2420, and by 1890 a proposed design for a building estimated to cost £6500 had been drawn up. Building commenced in 1892; a headmaster - Frederick Swann, head of Chemistry and Physics at the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle, was appointed in April 1893, and the first boys were admitted in December of the same year.
Grammar school.
In September 1939, girls were admitted. Some time after the 1944 Education Act it was established as a county-maintained voluntary controlled secondary school, but retained grammar school status. It was administered by West Riding County Council from Yeadon.
Comprehensive.
In 1970 it became a comprehensive school for ages 13–18. From April 1974 it was administered by the City of Bradford.
Expansion.
A number of extensions of the school have subsequently been made. As early as 1898, new classrooms and a gymnasium were constructed. Further classrooms were erected in the 1960s; and a major new building programme added 35 new teaching rooms in 2003.
In the summer of 2010 there are plans to redesign and extend the 6th form centre. There has been a grant put forward and plans drawn up, that include an external 'pod' for students to study in. 
The 'pod' was completed in the summer of 2010 with the main structure consisting of three old shipping containers. It doubles as both sixth form area and classroom to teach about renewable energy with the power coming from a wind turbine and solar panels. However the plan to move the pod to the new school site has been abandoned due to the cancellation of the Building Schools for the Future program.
Further minor expansion was also completed in the summer of 2011 with the addition of two new English classrooms in the form of a 'portacabin' this was intended to ease overcrowding as the school intake is expected to continue to increase in the coming years.

Òrrius

Òrrius is a municipality in Catalonia, in the Maresme zone of Spain. The municipality is delimited by La Roca del Vallès to the North, Vilassar de Dalt to the South East, Argentona to the south, and Cabrils to the southwest.
History.
Cited for the first time as "vila de Orreos" in documents from 974. This name, that has is origin in Latin, means "Barns". It formed part of the lands of the Lords of Burriac until in 1357 King Peter IV of Aragon conceded jurisdiction of the area to the Lords of Roca del Vallés.
Main sights.
The village is centred around the church of Sant Andreu (Saint Andrew), built in the 16th century in the late Gothic style. It is on the Latin cross plan, and has back to back chapels that were added later. There is also a small Romanesque hermitage. The bell tower is of later construction, being added to the church in 1826. In 1981 treasure, in the form of coins from the time of Berenguer Ramón II, was found within the church.
Also within the Municipality is the church of Sant Bartomeu de Cabanyes, first recorded in 1191.
Events.
Òrrius celebrates its fiesta mayor on 30 November, the Feast of Saint Andrew. During this fiesta "peixos" are eaten; a small cake, typical to the village, in the form of a fish. There is also the "Festa de la Plantada del Maig", celebrated on the second Saturday of May, where a tall tree that has been carried around the village by the villagers is planted in the town square.
Economy.
Traditionally, the principal economic activity is agriculture. Nevertheless, the proximity of the village to Mataró means that since the 1970s the village has become home to many residents of that town. For this reason, many inhabitants work outside the village.
There is little industrial activity, though there is a small granite quarry that continues to be exploited.

Endeka Kozanis

Endeka Kozanis is a traditional Greek dance, mostly danced at the region of Kozani. According to one point of view, it is a dance that was being danced at the weddings ("nyfiatikos" as said in Greek). 
Some others say (which does not conflict with the first opinion above) that the dance took its name from the fact that when the Turks were established at the geographical terrain of Greece, the Greeks had to return to their homes not after eleven o'clock in the night. Of course, they spent even their last minute outside and used to return at exactly eleven o'clock, usually dancing this dance. That's why the dance is named Endeka; "endeka" means eleven in Greek.
The dance is played in 11-meter.

Pribislav of Serbia

Pribislav of Serbia (, ) was Prince of the Serbs for a year, in 891–892, before being deposed by his cousin Petar.
He was the eldest son of Mutimir (r. 851–891) of the Vlastimir Dynasty, who ruled during the expanding and Christianization of Serbia.
Life.
His father had with his brothers Strojimir and Gojnik, defeated the Bulgar Army sent by "Tsar" Boris I of Bulgaria and led by his son Vladimir. Vladimir was captured together with 12 boyars. Boris I and Mutimir agreed on peace (and perhaps an alliance), and Mutimir sent his sons Pribislav and Stefan beyond the border to escort the prisoners, where they exchanged items as a sign of peace, Boris himself gave them "rich gifts", while he was given "two slaves, two falcons, two dogs, and eighty furs".
In the 880s, Mutimir seized the throne, exiling his younger brothers and Klonimir, Strojimir's son to the Bulgar Khanate; the court of Boris I. This was most likely due to treachery. Petar, the son of Gojnik, was kept at the Serbian court of Mutimir for political reasons, but he soon fled to Branimir of Croatia.
Mutimir died in 890 or 891, leaving the throne to his eldest son, Pribislav. Pribislav only ruled for a year when Petar returned in 892, defeating him in battle and seizing the throne, Pribislav fled to Croatia with his brothers Bran and Stefan. Bran later returned and led an unsuccessful rebellion against Petar in 894. Bran was defeated, captured and blinded (blinding was a Byzantine tradition that meant to disqualify a person to take the throne)
The "Pribislav" mentioned in the "codex aquileiensis", might refer to Pribislav.
His only son, Zaharija, had the goals to one day rule Serbia, but remained in Constantinople for a long period before successfully seizing the throne with Byzantine aid, ruling Serbia 920–924.

Maryland Route 94

Maryland Route 94 (MD 94) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland. Known as Woodbine Road, the state highway runs from the Montgomery–Howard county line at the Patuxent River north to Old Frederick Road near Lisbon. MD 94 originally extended into southern Carroll County in addition to connecting the western Howard County communities of Lisbon and Florence. The state highway was constructed from Lisbon to Woodbine in the late 1910s. MD 94 was constructed from Lisbon south through Florence and from Woodbine north to the village of Daniel south of MD 26 in the late 1920s and early 1930s. The state highway was extended south and removed from the state highway system north of Lisbon in 1956. MD 94 was relocated when its interchange with Interstate 70 (I-70) and U.S. Route 40 (US 40) was built in the mid-1970s. The state highway has two roundabouts, one of which was the first modern roundabout in Maryland.
Route description.
MD 94 begins at the Howard–Montgomery county line at a bridge over the Patuxent River. The highway continues south into Montgomery County as county-maintained Annapolis Rock Road, which intersects MD 108 (Damascus Road) east of Damascus. MD 94 passes through Patuxent River State Park as it ascends out of the narrow river valley and passes to the west of a steep hill named Annapolis Rock. The state highway crosses Cabin Branch and passes through the hamlet of Florence, where the highway intersects Florence Road; Florence Road leads east to the historic homes Cherry Grove and Hobson's Choice. MD 94 continues north through farmland to the village of Lisbon, where the highway meets MD 144 at a roundabout. The state highway meets I-70 and US 40 (Baltimore National Pike) at a diamond interchange before reaching its northern terminus at the Lisbon North Roundabout, where Woodbine Road meets Old Frederick Road. Woodbine Road continues north as a county highway to the village of Woodbine on the Patapsco River on the Howard–Carroll county line.
History.
The first section of MD 94 was built as a wide concrete road from Lisbon to Woodbine in 1916. A concrete arch bridge across the Patapsco River at Woodbine was completed in 1917; a macadam road was constructed north into Carroll County by 1921. Another section of MD 94 was constructed as a concrete road from Lisbon south to Florence in 1926 and 1927. The macadam road in Carroll County was extended north to the hamlet of Day in 1928. MD 94 in Carroll County was extended north in two sections from Day to the village of Daniel starting shortly after 1930; this macadam road was completed to near Buckhorn Road a short distance south of MD 26 in Winfield by 1933. The concrete road through Florence was extended to just north of Cabin Creek in 1933.
In 1956, MD 94's present termini were established. The state highway was extended from south of Florence to the Patuxent River; the highway was also transferred to county maintenance from Old Frederick Road north to Daniel. MD 94 was relocated to form a four-way intersection with MD 144 when its interchange with I-70 was constructed in 1974. The state highway previously had a short concurrency with MD 144 in Lisbon between the road south to Florence and the highway north to Woodbine; the old alignment remains south of I-70 as Madison Street and north of the Interstate as Old Woodbine Road. The first modern roundabout constructed in Maryland was completed at the intersection of MD 94 and MD 144 in 1993. The roundabout with Old Frederick Road at the state highway's northern terminus was built in 1998.

20th meridian west

The meridian 20° west of Greenwich is a line of longitude that extends from the North Pole across the Arctic Ocean, Greenland, Iceland, the Atlantic Ocean, the Southern Ocean, and Antarctica to the South Pole. In some geographic schema, it is used as the line of longitude which best delineates the historical separation between the Old World of Eurasia and Africa and the New World of the Americas.
The 20th meridian west forms a great circle with the 160th meridian east.
In Antarctica, the meridian defines the border between the British Antarctic Territory and Queen Maud Land. Between the 5th parallel north and the 60th parallel south it forms the eastern boundary of the Latin American Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone.

Patch Products

Patch Products is a national manufacturer and marketer of family entertainment products, specializing in games, children's puzzles, toys, activities and teaching tools.
History.
Brothers Fran and Bryce Patch opened a commercial printing company in 1971, producing games and related items for other companies. They printed "Trivial Pursuit" game boards and "Cabbage Patch Kids" sticker books among other things. Then in 1985, the brothers decided it was time to start their own toy and game company, and Patch Products was founded.
The company started with a line of "PuzzlePatch" tray puzzles for preschoolers, which are still in production. The company 
celebrated the milestone of making its 100 millionth puzzle in 2008. Through the years, organizations such as the American Toy Institute, Great American Toy Contest, National Association for Gifted Children, Nick Jr. magazine and Toy Tips have recognized the puzzles for their role in helping education children.
In 1992, the company obtained the license for "TriBond", its first board game. "TriBond" later was inducted into Games Magazine's Hall of Fame. Patch followed the success of "TriBond" with two other board games, "Blurt!" and "MadGab". The popularity of the three games turned Patch Products into a key player in the board game market. The company sold the brand rights to the three games to Mattel in 2004 so it could focus on developing new games.
Patch Products acquired Smethport Specialty Co., the maker of "Lauri Toys" and specialty products, in 2008. This added educational items to Patch's lineup, including Tall-Stacker pegging and crepe rubber puzzles, along with the iconic "Wooly Willy" magnetic personality.
In 2012, Patch Products was honored with a Wisconsin Family Business of the Year Award. The Work Hard—Play Hard Award was given to Patch to recognize the company's emphasis on family fun time and its programs to promote that togetherness.
2013 has been a big year for Patch Products, with becoming the exclusive distributor of the popular "Perplexus" 3D maze game to independent toy and gift stores. They also became the new manufacturer and distributor of the well-known "The Game of Things..." Patch also debuted its new collectible soft doll line "Planet Sock Monkey" which adds attitude and style to the classic sock monkey. Each doll features a fun name, bold personality and eye-catching clothing and accessories.
Today the small printing company has grown into a national manufacturer of family entertainment products with a full line of board games, card and dice games, children's puzzles, activities, educational tools and collegiate sports balls.
Award-winning games.
Through the years, games produced by Patch Products have won awards from Oppenheim Toy Portfolio, Dr. Toy, The National Parenting Center, iParenting Media Awards, Parents' Choice and Toy Tips. Award-winning games include:
Party Games
"What's Yours Like?"

Travers Smith

Travers Smith LLP is a corporate law firm headquartered in London, United Kingdom, and a member of the "Silver Circle" of leading UK law firms. It has around 220 lawyers and operates in 14 specialist practice areas. It was voted UK Law Firm of the Year in 2007 and 2012. 
History.
The firm was originally founded by Samuel Amory, who qualified in 1810. Samuel's daughter, Ann, married John Travers, a member of a well-known produce family in the City of London which was a long-standing client of the practice. Their grandson, Joseph Travers Smith, joined the firm in 1851 and became its senior partner. One of the firm’s partners drafted the constitution for the London Stock Exchange in 1801.
Historian Charles Sharman described Joseph Travers Smith as the solicitor to “the Westminster Bank and to numerous old families from Royalty downwards”. The firm was joined by Stephen Braithwaite in 1873, when the practice became known as Travers Smith Braithwaite, a name it retained until 2004 when it was shortened to Travers Smith.
Following the Second World War, the firm grew steadily through organic expansion. Since the 1990s the firm has not followed the strategy of mergers and overseas expansion adopted by most of its UK-based peers, and has remained London-centric (aside from opening a small Paris office). Travers Smith was courted by Latham & Watkins for merger however, the famously independent firm declined being absorbed by another firm.
Travers Smith opened an office in Berlin, Germany in 2001; the office was closed in January 2007, with all of its lawyers moving to Salans.
Travers Smith converted to a limited liability partnership in July 2008.

The Ox-Bow Incident (novel)

The Ox-Bow Incident is a 1940 western novel by Walter Van Tilburg Clark, in which two drifters are drawn into a lynch mob to find and hang three men presumed to be rustlers and the killers of a local man.
Clifton Fadiman, writing an introduction to the Readers Club edition, called it a "mature, unpitying examination of what causes men to love violence and to transgress justice," and "the best novel of its year." In 1943, the novel was adapted into an Academy Award-nominated movie of the same name, directed by William A. Wellman and starring Henry Fonda and Harry Morgan.
"The Ox-Bow Incident" is Clark's first published novel.
Story.
"The Ox-Bow Incident" takes place in 1885, and the story is told in the first-person perspective by Art Croft. It begins with two riders, Art Croft and Gil Carter, riding into the town of Bridger's Wells. They go into Canby's Saloon and find the atmosphere is tense, partly due to recent incidents of cattle rustling.
Gil has a propensity for fighting. During a poker game, Gil's unusually good luck causes a fight between Gil, a local rancher named Farnley, and Art. While Art takes Gil outside to clear his head, a young man named Greene comes into town bringing news that a local named Kinkaid has been murdered and a large number of cattle have been stolen from Drew, the largest cattle rancher in Bridger's Wells. 
The townspeople begin to form a lynch mob. Two local men, Osgood and Davies, attempt to deter them. Art is sent with a boy named Joyce, clerk in Mr. Davis's store, to bring Judge Tyler. When Tyler questions Greene, it turns out that Greene had not even seen Kinkaid. 
Tyler is almost able to defuse the situation, until the arrival of cold-hearted former Confederate soldier Tetley, his son Gerald, and Amigo, one of Tetley's hired hands. Amigo explains that he almost ran into the rustlers, but was able to avoid being seen. As the mob of 28 men sets out, Judge Tyler warns Tetley that the men must be brought back alive to stand trial. But Tetley wants to make his son manly by murdering one of the men, as he believes his son to be too "feminine" in his eyes. 
On their journey, the riders encounter a stagecoach. They try to stop it, but the stagecoach guard assumes that it is a stickup and shoots, accidentally wounding Art in the left shoulder. In the coach are Rose Mapen, Gil's old girlfriend, who was run out of town earlier, and her new husband, Swanson. 
After tending to Art's wounded shoulder, the mob finds three men sleeping on the ground around a campfire, and cattle bearing Drew's brand. Tetley interrogates the men: a young, well-spoken man named Donald Martin; an old, raving man named Alva Hardwick; and a Mexican named Juan Martinez who claims to be unable to understand English. Martin says that he purchased the cattle from Drew, but that he received no bill of sale as the transaction occurred out on the range. Drew was to send the bill of sale to Martin at a later date. No one believes Martin, and the mob decides that the three men are to hang. It is clear to Martin and Davies that they had already made up their minds, no matter what was said.
The hanging is postponed until dawn. Martin, as his last wish, writes a private letter to his wife. Martin asks Davies to deliver it. Davies is vehemently opposed to the lynching and is the only one in the crowd that Martin trusts. Davies reads the letter, and, hoping to save Martin's life, tries to have the others read the letter. When Martin learns of this, he becomes angry at Davies for the breach of his privacy and revealing his most intimate last thoughts intended only for his wife. Taking advantage of the distraction caused by the argument between Martin and Davies, the Mexican, Juan Martinez, tries to escape. He is shot in the leg. The riders then discover that Juan is able to speak "American." During his escape he used a pistol engraved with Kinkaid's name. This confirms the decision to lynch the three men. 
With Davies still trying to avert the lynching, a vote is taken on whether the men should be hanged or taken back to face justice in the town. Of the group, only five are opposed to the hanging, Tetley's son Gerald among them. When sunrise approaches, the condemned men are placed upon their horses with nooses around their necks. Tetley orders three people to tend to the horses, one of them his son Gerald. When the command is given, Gerald Tetley balks and the horse simply walks out from under Martin, leaving him to slowly strangle. Farnley shoots Martin as he hangs. In anger, Tetley pistol whips his son to the ground.
After the lynching, the riders head back toward town, where they meet Sheriff Risley, Judge Tyler, Drew, and, much to their surprise, Lawrence Kinkaid, who it turns out is very much alive. Drew confirms that he'd sold the cattle to Martin, who was not a rustler. The infuriated judge declares he will have the entire mob—most of the men of the town—up on charges for murder. 
However, after silently staring down each member of the lynch mob one at a time, Sheriff Risley declares that he will pretend he saw nobody and knows nothing. "It'll have to be this way," he says to the protesting judge. Sheriff Risley then takes ten men with him to form a posse, who will go after the real rustlers. 
Once back in town, Tetley returns to his house and locks out his son. His son, horrified by his own participation in the lynching, his own weakness in being unable to stand up to his father, and shamed, goes into the barn and hangs himself. When Tetley hears of his son's death, Tetley takes his own life as well, by falling on his cavalry sword.
Later, Davies confesses to Art that he feels he is responsible for the deaths of three innocent men. Because of the shame and guilt that plague him, Davies feels he is unable to face Martin’s widow, so he asks Drew to deliver the letter to her, as well as a ring Martin bade Davies to deliver. The novel ends with Gil saying "I'll be glad to get out of here." Art says "Yeh."

Dalua.
Dalua is a character in the play. Although the play uses characters and settings from Celtic mythology, the character of Dalua was the invention of Macleod. He is a brooding and fateful presence, known alternatively as the Amadan-Dhu, the Dark One, the Faery Fool. He claims to be even more ancient than the gods. It is through his movements and gestures that he affects the feelings and desires of the other characters and thus drives the fatal, hubristic pursuit of the Faery princess Etain by the mortal king Eochaidh; later, at the end of the work, he steps in and touches the king, who consequently dies.

Tradition says that St.Patrick, on his way to Croagh Patrick, visited Raheens. Also it is noted that Islandeady would have belonged to the 'Patrician lands of Connacht'. The date given by historians to St.Patrick's missionary work in Islandeady is 440 A.D., where he preached on the shores of a lake in the peaceful little parish. Today the modern village lies within the townlands of Rinnaseer and Cloonan.
Geography.
Islandeady boasts many kinds of land, fertile plains, bog, marsh, moor land, mountain rock and stony soil. Lakes and rivers are abound in number and variety. The main lakes are Bilberry and Lough Lannagh, but there are many lesser known ones too.

Canoe diving

Canoe diving, or the sport of scuba diving from a canoe, is a relatively new territory for paddlers. It involves utilizing a canoe to transport scuba divers and their equipment to offshore diving locations which are beyond practical swimming distances.
Though strikingly similar to kayak diving in which divers use a sit-on-top kayak instead of a canoe, canoe diving allows divers to traverse greater distances at considerably faster speeds. Canoes can hold substantially more weight than a kayak, and they have more room for gear. They also offer paddlers a better view of the area around them.
Due to various economic constraints, canoe diving has recently gained popularity along the Gold Coast of Florida where many dive sites are less than three kilometers from shore. It is appealing to many individuals because it is relatively inexpensive and very adventurous. Traditionally, a charter service is used to access offshore dive sites which can be very costly. While some may enjoy the luxury and safety of a hired charter boat, captain, and crew, others seek the challenge and thrill of navigating a canoe loaded with cumbersome scuba equipment on the open ocean.
Canoe diving is best suited for calm seas and fair weather. Large waves, rough water, and strong winds make canoe diving unfavorable at best and extremely dangerous at worst.
Typically, the canoe is launched from a beach or jetty as close as conveniently possible to the intended scuba diving location. Scuba equipment is assembled ready for diving before it is loaded into the canoe. The divers then carefully enter the canoe, and paddle to the dive site. Navigation to the dive site may be facilitated by use of a hand-held global positioning system (GPS), or more traditional coastal navigation methods. Upon reaching the dive site, the divers put on their masks, fins, and weight belts, fill their buoyancy compensators (BC) with air and unload their scuba equipment into the water. Then each diver enters the water to put on their scuba equipment. Once both divers are ready, they descend and proceed with their dive. The canoe may be tethered to the divers via their surface marker buoy system if they are drift diving, or it may be anchored or fastened to a mooring buoy if one is available at the dive site.
After the dive, the divers must enter the canoe without capsizing it. Small items of equipment will usually be placed into the canoe while the diver is still in the water, but the scuba set will either be passed up to a person already in the canoe, or loaded after the diver is back on board.
Safety.
Safety equipment required depends on the jurisdiction. 
Florida, USA
The following is a summary of regulations found in Chapters 327 and 328 of Florida Statutes which pertain specifically to canoe diving [http://myfwc.com/RULESANDREGS/Rules_Boat.htm#equip]:

Igala Kingdom

The Igala Kingdom, also known as the Kingdom of Idah, was a pre-colonial West African state of what is now Nigeria. The kingdom was founded by the Igala, a people living north of the Igbo, with its capital at Idah. It was heavily influenced by the Yoruba, Bini and Jukun kingdoms.
Ata.
The first ""Ata"", the title given to the ruler of the kingdom, was Ebule- Jonu, a woman; she was succeeded by her brother Agana- Poje, the father of Idoko. Idoko would later succeed him as Ata, and had two children Atiyele and Ayegba om'Idoko (Ayegba son of Idoko), Atiyele the first son of Idoko migrated eastward of the kingdom to establish Ankpa kingdom while Ayegba the second son of Idoko succeeded his father as Ata'Gala. He led a war against the Jukun, which resulted in victory. Idakwo Micheal was appointed as the new Ata in December 2012.
The ata-ship of Igala rotated among four branches of the royal clan. Igala kingdom was founded by Abutu- Eje in the 7th century. The kingdom was ruled by nine high officials called the Igala Mela who are custodians of the sacred Earth shrine.
History.
The kingdom of Igala survived well into the 19th century, becoming a British protectorate in 1901.

United States House of Representatives elections in Florida, 2008

The 2008 congressional elections in Florida were held on November 4, 2008 to determine who will represent the state of Florida in the United States House of Representatives. Representatives are elected for two-year terms; those elected will serve in the 111th Congress from January 4, 2009 until January 3, 2011. The election coincides with the 2008 U.S. presidential election. 
Florida has twenty-five seats in the House, apportioned according to the 2000 United States Census. Its delegation to the 110th Congress of 2007-2009 consisted of sixteen Republicans and nine Democrats. In 2008, Districts 8 and 24 changed party from Republican to Democratic, and District 16 changed party from Democratic to Republican. Florida's delegation to the 111th Congress therefore consists of fifteen Republicans and ten Democrats, a net increase of one Democrat. CQ Politics had forecasted districts 8, 13, 15, 16, 18, 21, 22, 24 and 25 to be at some risk for the incumbent party.
The Primary election was held August 26, 2008, with a registration deadline of July 28, 2008. The General election was held November 4, 2008, with a registration deadline of October 6, 2008. Early voting begins 15 days before an election and ends on the second day before an election. In 2008, early voting ran from October 20 through November 2.
Overview.
All of the vote totals were copied from the Secretary of State of Florida's Website
Congressional districts.
District 1.
Republican incumbent Jeff Miller has held this seat since winning a special election in 2001. He was challenged by Democrat Jim Bryan (campaign website), a Vietnam War veteran. CQ Politics forecasted the race as 'Safe Republican'.
Results.
Incumbent Jeff Miller retained his seat with about 70 percent of the vote.
District 2.
Democratic incumbent Allen Boyd has held this seat since 1997. Other contestants in this race included Republican challenger Mark Mulligan and write-in candidate Robert Ortiz. CQ Politics forecasted the race as 'Safe Democrat'.
Results.
Allen Boyd was reelected with slightly under 62 percent of the vote.
District 3.
Democratic incumbent Corrine Brown has held this seat since 1993 and ran unopposed in this election.
District 4.
Republican incumbent Ander Crenshaw has held this seat since 2001. He was challenged by Democrat Jay McGovern, an Iraq War veteran. CQ Politics forecasts the race as 'Safe Republican'.
Results.
Republican Ander Crenshaw was reelected with around 65 percent of the votes.
District 5.
Republican incumbent Ginny Brown-Waite (campaign website), who has held this seat since 2003, was again challenged by Democrat John Russell (campaign website), who received 40% against Brown-Waite in the 2006 election. CQ Politics forecasted the race as 'Safe Republican'. (CPVI=R+5)
Brown-Waite attracted a serious primary challenger in this sprawling Nature Coast district. As of November, Jim King had already begun a media campaign attacking Brown-Waite from the right and appealing to the conservative Christians who exert a serious influence in the local Republican Party. While King was a longshot to unseat Brown-Waite, a lengthy and divisive primary campaign of this sort risks draining the incumbent's campaign resources, splintering her support, and causing her to take up more conservative stances that would appeal less to moderate voters in the general election. 
Russell is a businessman, acute care nurse practitioner and local activist. He hoped to capitalize on Brown-Waite's difficult primary, her modest fundraising, and the recent demographic changes in this high-growth area. 
Results.
Ginny Brown-Waite retained her seat. She received around 61 percent of the vote, improving her showing against Russell in the 2006 election by slightly over 1 percentage point.
District 6.
Republican incumbent Cliff Stearns has held this seat since 1989. He faced Democratic challenger Tim Cunha (campaign website). CQ Politics forecasts the race as 'Safe Republican'.
Results.
Incumbent Cliff Stearns was reelected with just under 61 percent of the votes.
District 7.
Republican incumbent John Mica, representing the district since 1993, faced Democratic challenger, Faye Armitage (campaign website). CQ Politics forecasted the race as 'Safe Republican'.
Results.
Incumbent John Mica held his seat, gaining 62 percent of the votes.
District 8.
Democratic nominee Alan Grayson (campaign website) challenged Republican incumbent Ric Keller, who had held the seat since 2001. (campaign website). On October 21, 2008, CQ Politics switched its outlook on the race from "No Clear Favorite" to "Leans Democratic," citing the fact that there are now more registered Democrats that Republicans in Keller's district. George W. Bush won the district in 2004 with 55% of the vote (CPVI=R+3).
In 2006, Keller, author of the "Cheeseburger Bill", was reelected by less than expected to Orlando businessman Charlie Stuart, who polled 46%. After the November 2006 election, Keller announced that he would break his 2000 pledge to serve only four terms. Todd Long (campaign website), an Orlando attorney and radio talkshow host, then announced he would challenge Keller in the Republican primary, promising to make an issue of the broken term-limits pledge. Greg Lewis and retired Marine Corps officer Bob Hering also announced they would challenge Keller in the primary, but they did not meet the qualifying requirements. 
Grayson, an attorney who prosecutes war profiteers, had run unsuccessfully in the 2006 Democratic primary. In the 2008 primary, he faced Charlie Stuart (campaign website), who had lost to Keller by six percentage points in 2006; Mike Smith (campaign website), a former state prosecutor and current trial lawyer with Morgan and Morgan; Corbett Kroeler (campaign website), an environmental activist; Quoc Ba Van (campaign website), local weight-lifting champion and recent Emory Law School graduate.
Results.
Alan Grayson defeated incumbent Ric Keller, receiving 52 percent of the vote. This was one of two pickups for the Democratic Party in Florida, along with District 24.
District 9.
Republican freshman incumbent Gus Michael Bilirakis faced several opponents in this race. Challengers included Democrat Bill Mitchell, independents Richard Emmons and John Kalimnios, and write-in candidate Andrew Pasayan. CQ Politics forecasted the race as 'Safe Republican'.
Results.
Incumbent Gus Michael Bilirakis retained his seat, receiving around 62 percent of the votes.
District 10.
Republican incumbent Bill Young, who has represented this district since 1971 and is currently the longest-serving Republican in the House, faced Dunedin Mayor Democrat Bob Hackworth and write in candidate Don Callahan. Bob Hackworth won the Democratic primary on August 26, 2008 with 46% of the vote, defeating Samm Simpson and Max Linn. CQ Politics forecasted the race as 'Safe Republican'.
Results.
Bill Young was reelected, receiving around 61 percent of the votes.
District 11.
Freshman Democratic congresswoman Kathy Castor faced Republican challenger Eddie Adams, Jr.. CQ Politics forecasted the race as 'Safe Democrat'.
Results.
Kathy Castor easily retained her seat with nearly 72 percent of the votes.
District 12.
Republican incumbent Adam Putnam, who has held this seat since 2001, was challenged by Democrat and retired U.S. Navy Master Chief Petty Officer Doug Tudor. CQ Politics forecasted the race as 'Safe Republican'.
Results.
Adam Putnam was reelected, receiving 57.5 percent of the vote.
District 13.
Freshman Republican incumbent Vern Buchanan (campaign website) was again challenged by Democratic banker Christine Jennings (campaign website). Former Democratic Congressional candidate Jan Schneider also filed, running as an Independent. This was expected to be a competitive race in 2008, though Buchanan was far ahead of Jennings in fundraising. CQ Politics forecasted the race as 'Leans Republican'. George W. Bush won 56% of the district's vote in 2004 (CPVI=R+4).
Buchanan was certified as having won in 2006 by a 369-vote margin over Jennings, but Jennings challenged the election in court. Although Buchanan was seated by the House, the House has made no final decision on the matter. In mid-July 2007, Jennings announced she would run again in 2008. 
Results.
Vern Buchanan was reelected to a second term. In contrast to the 2006 election, Buchanan won by a convincing margin, receiving 55.5 percent of the vote.
District 14.
Republican incumbent Connie Mack, holder of this seat since 2005, was challenged by Democrat Robert Neeld (campaign website), Independent Jeff George (campaign website) and Republican State Senator Burt Saunders (who ran as an Independent). CQ Politics forecasted the race as 'Safe Republican'.
Results.
Connie Mack was returned to Congress for a third term, receiving over 59 percent of the votes.
District 15.
Seven-term Republican incumbent Dave Weldon had easily won re-election contests for a decade, but is retiring in 2008, leaving this Florida's only open House seat. Republican nominee State Senator Bill Posey, who was endorsed by Weldon and the Florida Republican Party, faced Democratic nominee physician Steve Blythe (campaign website). Independent candidates Frank Zilaitis and Trevor Lowing also ran for the seat. Libertarian Jeffrey Bouffard, a computer engineer and army veteran, also filed to run, but did not qualify for the ballot. CQ Politics forecasted the race as 'Republican Favored'. George W. Bush won 57% of the vote here in 2004 (CPVI=R+4).
Results.
Bill Posey won the open seat with 53 percent of the vote. As a result, this seat remained under Republican control for the 111th Congress.
District 16.
Republican nominee Tom Rooney faced Democratic incumbent Tim Mahoney. 
This is normally a solidly Republican district, so consensus was that Mahoney's 50% to 48% win in 2006 could be attributed to the Mark Foley scandal. The Republican nominee Joe Negron's 2006 campaign was harmed by the fact that Foley's name remained on the ballot even though he was not a candidate, as his withdrawal from the race came too late to replace him on the ballot under Florida law. George W. Bush won this district by a 10-point margin in 2004 (CPVI=R+2). 
Attorney Rooney won the Republican primary election against State Rep. Gayle Harrell and Palm Beach Gardens City Councilman Hal Valeche. 
On October 12, 2008, it was revealed that Mahoney had an affair with a staffer, and had paid her $121,000 in a settlement to stave off a potential lawsuit. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called for an ethics inquiry. Two days later, CQ Politics changed their forecast on the race from "No Clear Favorite" to "Leans Republican".
Results.
Republican Tom Rooney, with 60 percent of the votes, defeated incumbent Congressman Tim Mahoney. This was the only district in Florida to switch from Democratic to Republican control in 2008.
District 17.
Democratic three-term incumbent Kendrick Meek ran unopposed in this heavily Democratic district (CPVI=D+35).
District 18.
Republican incumbent Ileana Ros-Lehtinen has held this seat since 1989; however, her district has been increasingly trending Democratic in recent elections. The district contains many Miami suburbs and the entire Florida Keys. Founder and CEO of LanguageSpeak and Chair of the Women's Enterprise National Council's Leadership Forum Annette Taddeo was the Democratic nominee and was able to raise a significant sum of money. Nonetheless, polls throughout the campaign showed Ros-Lehtinen in the lead. CQ Politics forecasted the race as 'Republican Favored'.
Results.
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen defeated challenger Taddeo, receiving nearly 58 percent of the vote.
District 19.
Democratic incumbent Robert Wexler, representing this district since 1997, faced Republican Edward J. Lynch and fellow Democrat Ben Graber, who chose to run as an independent candidate rather than compete against Wexler in the Democratic primary. Wexler had run opposed in the previous two elections. CQ Politics forecasted the race as 'Safe Democrat'.
Results.
Wexler retained his seat, receiving around 66 percent of the vote.
District 20.
Democratic incumbent Debbie Wasserman Schultz (campaign website) has held this seat since 2005. Challengers Margaret Hostetter, who ran against Wasserman Schultz as a Republican in 2004 but chose to run as an independent in 2008, and Socialist write-in candidate Marc Luzietti (campaign website) were not expected to be serious threats to Wasserman Schultz. CQ Politics forecasted the race as 'Safe Democrat'.
Results.
As expected, Debbie Wasserman Schultz easily won reelection, receiving over 77 percent of the vote.
District 21.
Republican incumbent Lincoln Diaz-Balart (campaign website) had faced little more than token opposition since taking office in 1993. This year, however, the race was expected to be much tougher for Diaz-Balart, as the Democratic nominee, former Hialeah Mayor Raul L. Martinez (campaign website), is very well known in the area and could be a formidable challenger. CQ Politics forecasted the race as 'Leans Republican'. Rothenberg rated it as 'Pure Toss-Up.' Cook rated it as 'Republican Toss-Up'. Bush won 57% of the vote here in 2004 (CPVI=R+6).
On May 22, 2008, Diaz-Balart did not attend a debate hosted by the South Florida AFL-CIO with Martinez due to scheduling and venue issues. 
A July 7 poll conducted by a noted Democratic polster, Sergio Bendixen, showed Diaz-Balart ahead of Martinez by a four point margin, 41 to 37 percent, with 22 percent undecided. David Hill, the Diaz-Balart brothers' pollster, said Lincoln's internal polling shows the congressman with a 12-point lead over Martinez and a "double-digit advantage over his opponent in virtually every significant segment of the electorate."
On August 1, 2008, a leading Washington analyst, Rothenberg Political Report, reported that they see a "possible re-election trouble for Lincoln Diaz-Balart". According to an August 14, 2008 "Time" article, Lincoln Diaz-Balart faces a competitive race. It also said that "Democratic voter registration in Miami-Dade County, as in other places, is up, and Republican registration is down."
On August 25, 2008, Lincoln Diaz-Balart agreed to debate Martinez, at a Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce event at noon on October 8.
In a SurveyUSA poll sponsored by Roll Call conducted in August 2008, Martinez led Diaz-Balart (48% to 46%) among likely voters. According to the poll, Diaz-Balart enjoyed 70% support from Cuban-Americans in the district. The poll's demographics (which were chosen by the pollster in 2008) are different from those of the district (based on the US census of 2000.) 51% of those questioned were Hispanic (34% of respondents were Cuban and 17% were non-Cuban). The percentage of Hispanics in the district is higher at 69.7%. Later polls, however, showed Diaz-Balart back in the lead.
Results.
Despite predictions of a close election, Lincoln Diaz-Balart won reelection by a fairly comfortable margin, receiving just under 58 percent of the vote.
District 22.
First-term Democratic incumbent Ron Klein was challenged by former army officer and Iraq War veteran Allen West. Michael Prysner, an Iraq War veteran, peace activist, and college student, ran as a write-in candidate on the Party for Socialism and Liberation ticket. CQ Politics forecasted the race as 'Democrat Favored'.
Republicans suffered a setback when popular former Boca Raton Mayor Steven Abrams announced he would not run. West and former navy pilot Mark Flagg announced they would run. Neurosurgeon Robert Brodner and 2006 Connecticut U.S. senatorial candidate Alan Schlesinger were also potential candidates. This Fort Lauderdale area district barely went to John Kerry in 2004 (CPVI=D+4). 
Results.
Ron Klein successfully defended his seat, receiving slightly less than 55 percent of the vote.
District 23.
Democratic incumbent Alcee Hastings, who has held this seat since 1993, faced Republican Marion Dennis Thorpe Jr. in this heavily Democratic district. CQ Politics forecasted the race as 'Safe Democrat'.
Results.
Alcee Hastings easily retained his seat with over 82 percent of the vote.
District 24.
Three-term Republican incumbent Tom Feeney (campaign website) faced Democrat nominee and former State Representative Suzanne Kosmas (campaign website) and independent Gaurav Bhola. On October 21, 2008, CQ Politics switched its outlook on the race from "No Clear Favorite" to "Leans Democratic."
The district includes the Orlando suburbs as well as the Space Coast of Florida. In 2006, Feeney was re-elected by 58% to 42%. Although Feeney reportedly drew the district for himself while serving as speaker of the state house, the district is actually somewhat marginal on paper (CPVI=R+3). Bush took 55 percent of the vote in this district in 2004.
Results.
Suzanne Kosmas ousted incumbent Tom Feeney, receiving around 57 percent of the vote. This district was one of two in Florida to switch from Republican to Democratic control in 2008, along with District 8.
District 25.
Republican three-term incumbent Mario Diaz-Balart faced Miami-Dade County Democratic Party chairman Joe Garcia (campaign website), a former executive director of the Cuban American National Foundation (CANF). CQ Politics forecasted the race as 'Leans Republican'. The Rothenberg Political Report as 'Toss-Up/Tilt Republican'. The Cook Political Report as 'Republican Toss Up'. Bush won 56% of the vote here in 2004 (CPVI=R+4).
Garcia announced on February 7, 2008, his candidacy for the U.S. House of Representatives in Florida's 25th congressional district. 
In March 2008, the Garcia's campaign announced that noted political strategist Joe Trippi, the campaign manager for 2004 presidential candidate and former Vermont governor Howard Dean, was joining the campaign team as Senior Media Adviser.
In April 2008, Garcia held a controversial fundraiser with Representative Charles B. Rangel, who has met repeatedly with Fidel Castro and pushed legislation that would allow U.S. citizens to travel to Cuba and allow American firms to do business there. Garcia said he "has serious disagreements with Rangel on Cuba. But having a relationship with the chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee would help him bring federal money back to the district." Diaz-Balart claimed Garcia had a radical left-wing agenda including supporting higher taxes on working families and appeasing the nation's enemies.
An August 14, 2008 "Time" article labeled the race as competitive, pointing out that "Democratic voter registration in Miami-Dade County, as in other places, is up, and Republican registration is down". 
According to many commentators, Garcia is Mario Diaz-Balart's most formidable political opponent ever because of the amount of money that he has raised and the national media attention that he has generated Nonetheless, the Rothenberg Political Report and CQ Politics rated the seat as "Toss-up/Tilt Republican," the Cook Political Report rated the district as "Likely Republican," and the Crystal Ball has rated the district as "Safe Republican" 
A poll of the race, that was conducted June 6 to 22, by noted Democratic pollster, Sergio Bendixen, showed Diaz-Balart ahead of Garcia 44 percent to 39 percent, with 17 percent undecided.
As of August 6, 2008, Garcia has raised $1,001,313 with $789,667 cash on hand for the 2007-2008 cycle. Mario Diaz-Balart, the five year incumbent, has raised $1,188,193 and has $1,029,556 cash on hand during the same cycle.

Arthell Kelly Hall is a hall which is located on the campus of the University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. It currently houses the Department of the Administration of Justice.
Originally the Wesley Foundation, the building has seen recent renovations to move the department into the building. The renovations and the subsequent lab design were made possible by a $2 million grant from the Department of Justice. The department used these funds to establish a fully functional forensics lab that competes against many labs in the country while simultaneously being more advanced than Mississippi's own state funded crime lab.

Jurgis Bielinis

Jurgis Bielinis (March 16, 1846 in Purviškiai, near Biržai – January 18, 1918 in Katinai, near Panevėžys) was one of the main organizers of illegal book-smuggling (knygnešiai) at the time of the Lithuanian press ban. He was also a publicist and contributor to Lithuanian newspapers "Aušra" and "Varpas". Bielinis used pseudonyms Bieliakas, Jakulis, and is informally referred to as King of Knygnešiai. It is estimated, that during 31 years when he was active, Bielinis and his organizations illegally brought about half of all Lithuanian books from the East Prussia (Lithuania Minor) into the Lithuanian mainland during the entire press ban (1864–1904). 
Biography.
Bielinis graduated from a primary school in Riga in 1872. Since 1873 Bielinis was involved in the book-smuggling activities and cooperated with Motiejus Valančius. Since 1890 he was actively sought by the authorities of the Russian Empire. Bielinis could not come home and had to hide. He escaped at least five times after being captured by gendarmes, despite a large monetary reward promised for his capture. This encouraged him to organize the book distribution even better. Bielinis became an ultimate professional book smuggler and the main organizer of the Lithuanian book distribution in northern Lithuania. He founded Garšviai knygnešiai society, the largest book smuggling organization at the time. Bielinis developed a newspaper subscription system and was delivering newspapers and magazines to the subscribers. His organization also delivered forbidden Latvian books to Latvia. For his active participation in underground books smuggling, Bielinis was nicknamed as "knygnešių karalius" (The King of the Book Carriers). 
Bielinis also published his own newspaper "Baltasis erelis" (for this purpose brought a printing press form Martynas Jankus) and wrote several brochures on the history of Lithuania. He was among the first who spoke openly about Independent Lithuania. Bielinis died walking by foot to attend the Vilnius Conference. Jurgis Bielinis birthday is celebrated in Lithuania as the Day of Knygnešys. He is buried in Suostas' churchyard.

Lancero

Lancero ("English: Lancer") is a military course and a denomination within the Colombian Army. The course takes place at the School of Lanceros of Colombia in Tolemaida, Department of Tolima in Colombia.
Overview.
The Colombian Army has been in a military conflict with rebel guerrillas for the last four decades. This has led the Colombian Government and its military forces to develop different training courses specifically aimed to the training of both soldiers and officers for this kind of warfare. The term Lancero was chosen as a way to honor a specific unit of fighters (Lanceros) that helped the army of Simón Bolívar in his conflict for the independence of Colombia. This unit showed special bravery and strength during the Vargas Swamp Battle.
History of the Course.
The course was created as a result of the reform that took place inside the National Army of Colombia organization during the early 60s as a way to specialize and refocus the national army towards an irregular conflict with armed peasants in the mountains of Colombia. Inexperienced and with little knowledge of guerrilla warfare the Colombian Army sent its own officers to Fort Benning in Georgia, USA so they could take the Ranger Course that takes place there and as a way to apply their acquired knowledge in Colombia's specific situation.
The techniques learned in the American course were modified and taught to Sergeants, lieutenants, Ensigns, Corporals and some enlisted and ranking officers of the Naval Infantry. This techniques were later spread across all the Colombian military components.
In 1959 the army created companies of Lanceros. These newly created companies were more agile and flexible thus, leading to more successful operations. They were added as supportive personnel for units where the enemy was even more aggressive and active.
In 1966 an outbreak of dispersed bandits called for the creation of even sharper and faster units. This year the Colombian Army's military command put into effect a more extensive training program to combat the rebels; this program would later become a single course called ""Contraguerrillas""
Since this time the Lancero course has focused on the training of Soldiers, Army officers and even Police officers for the needs of a country with an enemy that hides among the civilian population. After more than forty years the course has gained some notoriety among military personnel around the globe largely due to its focusing on guerrilla warfare and not on regular military warfare. 
The Lancero and Lanza concept.
The term Lancero which can be translated as lancer has subsequently led to the use of the term Lanza (Lance) as a way to refer to a fellow soldier. In fact the course has emphasized on the importance of cooperative work between two soldiers as a way to accomplish goals (one being the Lanza or spear and the other one being the lancero or lance carrier). Thus, the terms Lanza and Lancero are both colloquial and honoring ways to call a fellow soldier or an officer.

Royal Convent of La Encarnación

The Royal Monastery of the Incarnation or Real Monasterio de la Encarnación is a convent of the order of Recolet Augustines located in Madrid, Spain. The institution mainly interned women from noble families, and was founded by the Queen Margaret of Austria, wife of Philip III, and thus was well endowed with wealth. Although it belongs to an enclosed religious order, the building is open to the public under the administration of the Patrimonio Nacional.
History.
The impulse for the founding of the monastery by Queen Margaret, and sometimes the nuns are called "las Margaritas", was to celebrate her husband's expulsion of the Moriscos, resident Moors. The queen had the prioress of the monastery of discalced nuns of San Agustín in Valladolid, Mother Mariana de San José, accompanied by Francisca de San Ambrosio (sister of the marquesa de Pozas), Catalina de la Encarnación, and Isabel de la Cruz. First lodged in the Convent of Santa Isabel while they awaited the completion, they received donations from the king and queen, including jewels, to finance the monastery. The monastery was built adjacent to the then extant Real Alcázar, and had a passageway to allow the royals direct access. The monastery was inaugurated in the 2nd of July 1616, a few years after the queen had died.
The architect and friar Alberto de la Madre de Dios designed and built the monastery between 1611-1616. The facade has a sobriety recalling the style of Juan de Herrera. The monastery, now partly a museum, has a wealth of works of art and relics including tubes with the blood of St. Januarius and of St. Pantaleon.
During the reign of Charles IV of Spain, his prime minister, Manuel Godoy, would attend daily mass here, walking from his nearby Palace of Floridablanca. When Joseph Bonaparte entered Madrid as king, a hanged cat was found on the monastery gate with the writing: "Si no lías pronto el hato",/ "te verás como este gato." ("If you don't leave this town soon/ you'll end up like this cat"). In the 19th century, the composer Lorenzo Román Nielfa was professor of music here. The monastery was open to the public in 1965.
The interior of the church was redecorated in the 18th century, including frescoes in the ceiling of the main chapel by Francisco Bayeu. In the center of the retablor of the main altar is an "Annunciation" by Vincenzo Carducci. The tabernacle was completed by Ventura Rodríguez. The small statues of the Doctors of the Church and the bas-relief of the Savior are by Isidro Carnicero.

Chebychev–Grübler–Kutzbach criterion

The Chebychev–Grübler–Kutzbach criterion determines the degree of freedom of a kinematic chain, that is, a coupling of rigid bodies by means of mechanical constraints. These devices are also called linkages.
The Kutzbach criterion is also called the "mobility formula", because it computes the number of parameters that define the configuration of a linkage from the number of links and joints and the degree of freedom at each joint.
Interesting and useful linkages have been designed that violate the mobility formula by using special geometric features and dimensions to provide more mobility than would by predicted by this formula. These devices are called overconstrained mechanisms.
Mobility formula.
The mobility formula counts the number of parameters that define the positions of a set of rigid bodies and then reduces this number by the constraints that are imposed by joints connecting these bodies.
A system of "n" rigid bodies moving in space has "6n" degrees of freedom measured relative to a fixed frame. This frame is included in the count of bodies, so that mobility is independent of the choice of the link that will form the fixed frame. Then the degree-of-freedom of this system is M=6(N-1), where N=n+1 is the number of moving bodies plus the fixed body.
Joints that connect bodies in this system remove degrees of freedom and reduce mobility. Specifically, hinges and sliders each impose five constraints and therefore remove five degrees of freedom. It is convenient to define the number of constraints "c" that a joint imposes in terms of the joint's freedom "f", where "c=6-f". In the case of a hinge or slider, which are one degree of freedom joints, have "f=1" and therefore "c=6-1=5".
The result is that the mobility of a system formed from "n" moving links and "j" joints each with freedom "fi", "i=1, ..., j," is given by
Recall that "N" includes the fixed link.
There are two important special cases: (i) a simple open chain, and (ii) a simple closed chain. A single open chain consists of "n" moving links connected end to end by "j" joints, with one end connected to a ground link. Thus, in this case "N=j+1" and the mobility of the chain is
For a simple closed chain, "n" moving links are connected end-to-end by "n+1" joints such that the two ends are connected to the ground link forming a loop. In this case, we have "N=j" and the mobility of the chain is
An example of a simple open chain is a serial robot manipulator. These robotic systems are constructed from a series of links connected by six one degree-of-freedom revolute or prismatic joints, so the system has six degrees of freedom.
An example of a simple closed chain is the RSSR spatial four-bar linkage. The sum of the freedom of these joints is eight, so the mobility of the linkage is two, where one of the degrees of freedom is the rotation of the coupler around the line joining the two S joints.
Planar and spherical movement.
It is common practice to design the linkage system so that the movement of all of the bodies are constrained to lie on parallel planes, to form what is known as a "planar linkage". It is also possible to construct the linkage system so that all of the bodies move on concentric spheres, forming a "spherical linkage". In both cases, the degrees of freedom of the links in each system is now three rather than six, and the constraints imposed by joints are now "c=3-f".
In this case, the mobility formula is given by
and the special cases become
An example of a planar simple closed chain is the planar four-bar linkage, which is a four-bar loop with four one degree-of-freedom joints and therefore has mobility M=1.

Handley Page HP.14

The Handley Page HP.14, also designated Handley Page R/200 was a prototype British naval reconnaissance aircraft of the First World War, capable of operating from the decks of the Royal Navy's aircraft carriers or as a floatplane. Only three were built, the Parnall Panther being preferred.
Design and development.
The R/200 was designed in 1917 to meet an Admiralty requirement for a two-seat reconnaissance-fighter capable of operating either as a floatplane or from the Royal Navy's new aircraft carriers, the flush deck "HMS Argus" and the part converted cruiser "HMS Furious". The R/200 was a small single-bay biplane powered by a 200 hp (149 kW) geared Hispano-Suiza 8 V-8 engine with a frontal radiator. Handley Page received an order for six prototypes in summer 1917.
The first two prototypes, fitted with floats were flown in December 1917, with the third prototype, fitted with a wheeled undercarriage flying in February 1918. Test results were poorer than the competing Parnall Panther, and as Handley Page was concentrating on production and development of the O/400 and V/1500 heavy bombers, the remaining three prototypes, together with a prospective production order for 20 aircraft were cancelled in March 1918.

Eugen Rosshirt

Johann Eugen Rosshirt (November 11, 1795 – July 13, 1872) was a German obstetrician and gynecologist who was a native of Oberscheinfeld.
He studied medicine at the University of Würzburg, where he earned his doctorate in 1818. Afterwards, he was an instructor of midwifery and prosector-surgery at Bamberg, and in 1833 succeeded Michael Jäger (1795–1838) as director of the obstetrics hospital at the University of Erlangen. He would remain at Erlangen until his retirement in 1868.
Rosshirt is remembered for his efforts in trying to establish women's healthcare as a separate and specialized area of study at Erlangen. Under Rosshirt's direction, a new building located near the university hospital was used as a women's clinic (1854). A growing number of births and students, as well as the initiation of gynecological practices led to creation in 1878, during Karl Schroeder's tenure, of the first "modern" gynecological hospital at Erlangen.
