Eudorcas

Eudorcas is a genus of antelope; the species are commonly called gazelles. "Eudorcas" was originally considered a subgenus of the genus "Gazella" but has since been elevated to generic status. The four species within the genus "Eudorcas" are:
Social structure and behavior.
The social structure of gazelles consists of several types of groups. Male gazelles are territorial throughout their adult lives, though not usually before two to three years of age. During the nonterritorial periods, males usually spend their time in bachelor groups or as part of a mixed herd. Likewise, females will form migratory female groups that travel through the males' territories. As the female groups pass through, the territorial males will try to herd them to prevent them from leaving. Adult males with adjoining territories will engage in combat several times a day, fighting with their horns to establish dominance and the boundaries of their territories. In this way, the accepted boundaries of the territory can change on a daily basis. If a lone male, a bachelor group, or in some cases even an adolescent male fawn of a female gazelle should be passing through a territorial male's region, the male will chase the offender out of his territory. Interestingly, this territoriality does not extend to males of other species.
The territory of a Thomson's gazelle and several other types of ungulates may overlap with no problem whatsoever. Occasionally, a Thomson's gazelle and a zebra or other ungulate will even appear to enjoy one another's company with great sociability. A noticeable behavior of Thomson's gazelles is their bounding leap, known as stotting or pronking, used to startle predators and display strength. Female Thomson's gazelles give birth to single fawns after a five- to six-month gestation period. They are unusual among ungulates in that they can give birth twice yearly, rather than just once. The fawn spends the first few months hiding in the grasses, with the mother coming to feed it daily. When the fawn can take care of itself, it joins the herd. Half of all the fawns born will be lost to predators before reaching adulthood.

Manchester Pride

Manchester Pride is an annual gay pride festival and parade held each summer in the city of Manchester, England. It is one of the longest running in the country and attracts thousands of visitors to the city's gay village, Canal Street, each year. The festival's events that take place within the Village require a paid-for Pride wristband for entry, while other events, such as the parade, can be watched by any spectator.
The current ten day festival includes a "Pride Fringe" with a series of arts, music and cultural events all over the city as well as community events including poetry readings, quizzes and film showings, culminating in "The Big Weekend", a 72-hour party during the August bank holiday weekend in Canal Street and the surrounding area, with a parade through the streets of Manchester.
History.
Currently there is some confusion over the date of the first LGBT August Bank Holiday fundraiser. In 2011 a colour photograph was published on the Manchester Pride website. This shows a jumble sale on Canal Street and Solway House on Aytoun Street can be seen in the background. Research done by the Facebook group Facts About Manchester Pride found that this building no longer existed by August 1990; it had been demolished to make way for the tram system and court extension. So the colour photo seems to show an event from a date earlier than the middle of that year. Ironically this colour photo was published by Manchester Pride as part of its supposed 21st birthday.
In 1989 the Northwest Campaign for Lesbian & Gay Equality organised Manchester's first documented "Celebration of Gay and Lesbian Diversity". Love Rights consisted of a music festival (performers included Jimmy Somerville and Yazz who performed her #2 UK chart hit of the same name "Stand Up (for your Love Rights)") at the Free Trade Hall and a political march starting at All Saints Park culminating in a rally with stalls in Albert Square. At the time the main focus of the gay rights movement was opposing Section 28.
So all we can say for definite at present is that, at some time in the second half of the 1980s, the event began as a jumble sale outside the Rembrandt Hotel. It was not a Pride event in those days. This is confirmed by a booklet that the Village Charity published for its annual general meeting in 1994, which states: "many volunteers of the charity get upset when the press call our weekend the 'Northern Pride'. It's not and never has been." The purpose was solely to raise money for HIV and AIDS causes and in particular for the ward at Monsall Hospital where people received treatment. In 1991 the event was expanded to include a full programme of activities from Friday to Monday and it was christened "the Carnival of Fun Weekend". The jumble sale moved into Sackville Park. On the Monday night there was a substantial fireworks display that was funded by the North West Development Agency and it was announced that good-luck telegrams had been received from Diana Princess of Wales and other high-profile people.
Over the following years, the event grew and was known as Mardi Gras. It developed with support from the VBA (Village Business Association). According to a report in The Pink Paper just after the 1996 Mardi Gras, the Village Charity hoped to top the £77,000 raised with a further £50,000 from donations included in ticket sales to the Sunday Freedom GALA at the G-Mex centre. Total: £127,000. Entry tickets and fences were first introduced during the council-run event in 1999, but despite a large income, there was no money for charity that year. As a result, the event reverted to community control in 2000, 2001 and 2002. From 2000 to 2001 the event was called Gayfest and was organised and managed by a committee of volunteers led by local businesswoman Julia Grant. During this time the Gayfest team bid for, and won, the right to host Europride in 2003.
In 2002 the event reverted to the name MardiGras and was organised by a committee of the Village Business Association. During these three years, no entry fee was charged, yet money was still raised for charity: Gayfest 2000 collected £105,716.77, Gayfest 2001 collected £87,666.63, and Mardi Gras 2002 collected £65,007. In 2003, about 37,000 people paid for tickets for EuroPride which was hosted that year by Manchester. This can be gleaned from the fact that Operation Fundraiser sold the £10 tickets and gathered £388,946 from tickets and bucket collections, with a final figure of £127,690 for good causes.
At the closing ceremony in 2003, it was announced that the event would be now be known as "Manchester Pride" (the manchesterpride.com domain name was registered by the web designers on behalf of Pride in April 2003) and in 2007 it became a Charity in its own right (charity number 1117848). One reason for this change was because in 2006 Customs and Excise had tried to charge back VAT for several years. This happened because, in their view, Manchester Pride was no longer a charity fundraiser. Increasing commercialisation meant that a dwindling percentage of the income reached a final good cause. By 2010 just over 11% of Manchester Pride's total income was reaching a good cause in the end. 
The event has had a turbulent history due to disputes between Manchester City Council, police, the community itself and local gay businesses and charities. As a result its name has changed a number of times. Arguments often centre around how it is run and how funds are raised. Since Europride 2003, the event has been organised by a Pride committee, in conjunction with Marketing Manchester, the Lesbian and Gay Foundation, and George House Trust. The area is once again cordoned off and gated, and wristbands must be bought to gain entry to the "compound". Some of the performers over the past 7 years include The Gossip, Kelis, The Human League, Samantha Fox and Dana International, as well as popular LGBT performers like Claire Mooney, Heather Peace and Valentino King, a Drag King.
Festival.
During the August bank holiday weekend of Manchester Pride, the city's gay village becomes a gated area; attendees are told that they must pay for a wristband in order to gain access to the village, however this is not true. The gated system and entry fee have been in place since 2003, however, the candlelight vigil held in Sackville Park each Pride does not require a wristband for entry. Additionally, the parade, starting on Deansgate, is free for anyone to watch and does not take place within the gated zone.
In 2013 it came to light that wristbands were never required to enter the gated area. In the words of a Manchester City Council representative "The closure orders do not restrict any pedestrian wishing to exercise their right of way to cross through the site and the event organisers are instructed to facilitate such movement as requested."
Criticisms have arisen over the closed nature of the event, with those against the policy describing it as a "prison". Pride organisers have rebutted the accusation, saying it increases safety and, by purchasing a ticket to enter, this gives Manchester Pride an increased income that will be donated to charities. Additionally, though the wristband offers access to the village and its arena, where music performances are held, certain bars and clubs within the vicinity charge their own entry fees. Manchester Pride noted the issue, stating, "we ask that bars do not charge an entrance fee during the Big Weekend; however this is something we cannot enforce".
Totals for charity.
2013: £34,000 (pay event)
2012: £52,000 (pay event) = 3.7% of funds raised

Select Bus Service

Select Bus Service (SBS), marked on the buses as +selectbusservice, is a brand used by MTA Regional Bus Operations for bus rapid transit service in New York City. SBS began service in 2008 in order to improve speed and reliability along multiple long, busy limited-stop corridors. The first route to run under the SBS branding was the Bx12 along Fordham Road and the Pelham Parkway. There are currently six SBS routes along five corridors, with an additional route scheduled to begin service in spring 2014.
History.
In conjunction with the New York City Department of Transportation, the MTA identified five corridors for implementation of bus rapid transit, one in each of the five boroughs, in late 2004: the Fordham Road/Pelham Parkway corridor in the Bronx, First and Second Avenues in Manhattan, Merrick Boulevard in Queens, Nostrand Avenue in Brooklyn, and Hylan Boulevard in Staten Island. Four bus priority corridors were also identified for implementation or expansion (three in Manhattan, one in the Bronx): Madison Avenue (expansion), Fifth Avenue, 34th Street, and Webster Avenue. The Merrick Boulevard corridor was eventually scrapped because of community opposition related to loss of parking.
The Select Bus Service program was unveiled to the public on March 25, 2008. At the time of the announcement, the MTA and the mayor had stated that implementation on other corridors was contingent on the passage of congestion pricing, which ultimately did not make it for a vote in the legislature.
The first Select Bus Service corridor, on the Bx12, was placed into service on June 29, 2008. The next line, the M15, saw Select Service begun on October 10, 2010 after the delivery of new low-floor buses. The M34/M34A line was started on November 13, 2011. Initially, a 34th Street busway was planned that would require eliminating 34th Street as a through street, but it was dropped in favor of the standard SBS model. The B44 bus route, the fifth Select Bus Service corridor in the city, was implemented on November 17, 2013 pending the arrival of new fare machines. The S79 Hylan Boulevard/Richmond Avenue route, initially slated to be converted to SBS in 2013, has been moved up to September 2, 2012; the local equivalents of the S79 route are the S78 and S59 buses. A sixth corridor, the second for the Bronx, began service on the Bx41 Webster Avenue route on June 30, 2013; this route was the first "Phase II" SBS route to begin service (the existing corridors plus the B44 comprise Phase I). Another Select Bus Service route on Webster Avenue, which will be extended to run between LaGuardia Airport and Fordham Plaza alongside the local Bx41 route, is proposed for later implemention. A seventh corridor, and the third for Manhattan, is also planned for the conversion of the M60 route; local service will be provided by other routes in the corridor. Originally, implementation of the M60 SBS was planned for the later half of 2013, but was pushed to April 2014 due to community opposition to loss of parking on 125 Street in mid-2013. An eighth Select Bus Service route is planned for 2014; this new SBS corridor is to be determined.
All five current SBS corridors are enforced by cameras restricting non-buses in these lanes on weekdays where the bus lane is curbside, with the bus lanes marked by red paint. Where the bus lane is an offset lane (that is, one lane away from the curb), non-bus traffic is restricted at all times except for emergencies.
Routes.
Currently, SBS operates on the Bx12, M15, M34 / M34A, S79, Bx41, and B44 routes, although listings have been released by the MTA for the M60. The "stations" for all are listed below.
Bx12.
This was the first Select Bus Service line placed into service on June 29, 2008 which replaced limited stop service with SBS on this line.
M15.
The M15-SBS began operating on October 10, 2010 which replaced limited stop service with SBS on this line. "Because of Second Avenue Subway construction on the Upper East Side, the southbound 96th Street and 86th Street stations are located at 100th Street and 89th Street, respectively. Southbound transfers from the M15 SBS require walking south to the corresponding streets and vice versa."
M34 and M34A.
The M34 and M34A Select Bus Service began on November 13, 2011. These are two SBS services, the M34 34th Street Crosstown and the former M16 route, which was renamed the M34A. The stops are listed below from west to east.
This service used non-articulated Orion 7 hybrid-electric buses between November 2011 and early April 2013, when they were replaced by the articulated buses found on the majority of the other SBS routes. 
S79.
The S79 SBS route began on September 2, 2012. While the routing was left mostly intact, the S79 had all local service eliminated (local service will continue to be available on the S59 route along Richmond Avenue and the S78 route along Hylan Boulevard), and the route was straightened through New Springville to bypass the Yukon Bus Depot. This route uses rigid Orion 7 hybrid-electric buses, and does not have off-board fare collection.
Northbound is towards Brooklyn and southbound is towards Staten Island.
Bx41.
The Bx41 Select Bus Service line started on June 30, 2013. The stops are nearly identical to the Limited service it replaced. They are listed from south to north. Both Bx41 Select Bus Service and Bx41 are both based out of Kingsbridge Bus Depot.
B44.
The B44 SBS route began on November 17, 2013 which replaced limited stop service with SBS. Initially planned for the end of 2011, then later the summer of 2012, the start date was pushed to November 2013 as the buses for the service did not arrive until early 2013. Unlike other SBS routes, this service involved a significant change in route, and approximately 20 current Limited stops were eliminated. Stops are listed from south to north. The elimination of Avenue L from select service, located adjacent to a school, proved to be especially controversial with local elected representatives and community members starting a Petition and calling for its restoration. On February 11 2014, just under three months since its launch, the MTA conceded to community pressure and announced the addition of Avenue L and Gates Avenue to the SBS route beginning in April 2014. This Bus is based out of Flatbush Bus Depot.
Notes
Future routes.
M60 (begins Spring 2014).
Service on the M60 Select Bus Service route is set to begin in April 2014. The confirmed stops are listed below, west to east. Stops at the eastern end of the route, within LaGuardia Airport, are marked "Airport Stop". Connections to other routes are listed with future route adjustments scheduled to be implemented prior to M60 SBS implementation. Service was to begin in mid- to late-2013, but the start date for the route have been pushed to April 2014 due to community pressure, citing loss of available parking spaces along 125th Street in Manhattan.
Vehicle branding.
Buses in Select Bus Service service have a wrap that identifies them as operating in this particular service. All SBS buses display +Select Bus Service+ in the destination sign. Bus stops where +SelectBusService buses stop are also identifiable with the SBS branding on the glass, and machines for MetroCard and coin payment in or near the shelters (except for the S79 SBS, which does not employ off-board fare collection). In addition, all buses on the SBS services have three doors for easier boarding and alighting with the exception of the S79.
The blue lights on both sides of the destination sign, used to help designate SBS buses, were removed from service in January 18, 2013. The flashing blue lights used on the Select Bus Service were controversial and violated the New York State Vehicle and Traffic Law (Article 9, Section 375 (41)). NYS Law states "The use of blue lights on vehicles shall be restricted for use only by a volunteer firefighter" and "may be affixed to a police vehicle and fire vehicle, provided that such blue light or lights shall be displayed on a police vehicle and fire vehicle for rear projection only.". MTA Select Bus Service used flashing blue forward projecting lights which violated the New York State VTL. One bus has been retrofitted with a multicolor sign as a test for future SBS signage; while the VTL prohibits flashing blue lights, there is no restriction on what color a solid destination sign may be.
Fare and payment.
The fare for SBS is the same as on all New York City Transit local and limited-stop buses, $2.50, payable with a MetroCard or coins. Boarding procedures for the S79 SBS are the same as those on regular local and limited-stop buses. On all other SBS services, unlike other bus lines in New York City, fare collection for SBS works via a proof-of-payment system. Customers must pay their fare before boarding the bus at pay stations located in bus shelters at the designated stops (for customers using UniTicket, the UniTicket is valid for boarding). Once fare payment is made, one must board the bus at that stop within one hour. Boarding can be done via the any of the three doors (The first door on S79 SBS vehicles). New York City Transit fare inspectors and NYPD police officers randomly check for proof of payment receipts, with those unable to produce one subject to a $100 summons.
In addition, proof-of-payment receipts are only valid for the route that stops at the station at which one boards (i.e., an M34/M34A SBS receipt cannot be used on the M15 SBS). When transferring from one SBS route to another, one must obtain a second receipt from that route's fare payment machines.

Jacques Bizard Bridge

Jacques Bizard Bridge is a bridge that crosses the Rivière des Prairies and connects L'Île Bizard to Montreal Island. Except for a cable ferry that connects Île Bizard with Laval-sur-le-Lac, it is the only access to Île Bizard, which had a population of 13,861 as of the 2001 census. It carries three lanes of Jacques Bizard Boulevard, including one reversible lane. As of 2008, it is being widened to accommodate a bicycle path. The ferry, which crosses the north branch of the Rivière des Prairies, operates only seasonally between April and November.
The bridge was named after Jacques Bizard, who was seigneur of Île Bonaventure, which was later renamed after him as well. The current span was built in 1966 and replaced an old bridge that was built in 1893.

Heider FC was a German association football club from the city of Heide, Schleswig-Holstein.
__TOC__
History.
The team was established in 1905 as a separate football side out of "Männer-Turnverein 1860 Heide". In 1914, they merged with "Fußball-Club Holstein Heide" to play as "Heider Sportvereinigung" before taking on the name "Verein für Leibesübungen 05 Heide" in 1919. "VfL" was reunited with parent side "MTV" in the 1930s and played as "Verein für Leibesübungen 1860 Heide" until sometime in the 40s when the club resumed its traditional identity as "MTV 1860 Heide".
In its brief existence as an independent club, "FC" made a single appearance in the end round of the regional Norddeutscher (North German) championship, advancing to the quarterfinals where they were put out 0:5 by "Holstein Kiel". Playing as "VfL", the team made single season appearances on the senior local circuit, the Bezirksliga Schleswig-Holstein, in 1924–25 and 1927–28, but did not distinguish itself.

South Korean presidential election, March 1960

Presidential elections were held in South Korea on 15 March 1960. Shortly after winning reelection to a third term in 1956, Rhee had the legislature pass a constitutional amendment exempting the incumbent president—himself—from the three-term limit. He then immediately announced his candidacy for a fourth term.
After the death of Democratic Party opponent Cho Pyong-ok, Rhee was left as the only candidate, and was re-elected unopposed. Voter turnout was 97.0%. With the lack of a meaningful contest in the presidential race, popular focus shifted to the vice-presidential contest where Rhee's Liberal Party candidate Lee Ki-bung competed against Chang Myon. The elections were heavily rigged in Lee's favor, and widespread allegations of corruption and manipulation of the results sparked protests which spiralled into the April Revolution, causing the annulment of the election, the resignation and exile of Rhee, and the collapse of the First Republic.
Results.
Popular hopes of unseating Rhee were frustrated by the death of his opponent Cho Pyong-ok several weeks before the election, leaving Rhee to be elected without opposition.
Vice-presidential elections.
With no competition for Rhee in the presidential elections of 1960 after the death of his opponent, the simultaneous vice-presidential elections became the main focus of attention. Opposition to Rhee was concentrated around the incumbent Democratic Party candidate, Chang Myon, who had been elected in 1956. Official results after the election showed a large victory for the Liberal candidate, Lee Ki Poong, with a margin of almost 80% to Chang's 17.5%, entirely against popular expectations, and it was obvious that the results had been extensively manipulated: Han goes so far as to say that "the election results were completely fabricated by police headquarters and the ministry of internal affairs".
The Democratic Party rejected the result and on the same day, protests began in Masan against the fabrication of the election results. The discovery of the mutilated body of a sixteen-year-old boy who had participated in these protests in early April caused a wave of further protest, and Rhee's obdurate attitude led to the intensification of unrest into the April Revolution, though Rhee forced Lee to withdraw from active politics. The results of the elections were nullified after the Revolution's triumph later in the year, though Chang himself resigned on April 23.

Gau Eastern Hanover

Gau Eastern Hanover was a regional district of the NSDAP established in 1925 in the north eastern part of the Prussian Province of Hanover, comprising the governorates of Stade and Lunenburg in their then boundaries. Initially the gau was a mere regional Nazi party subsection, but with the growing subjection of all public administration to Nazi party influence after the Machtergreifung, the Gau usurped from 1933 to 1935 more and more the functions of the Provincial government and its superordinate Free State of Prussia. However after the German constituent states were de facto abolished in 1935, the Gaue replaced them in their responsibilities. Gau East Hannover - like all Nazi party structures - was dismantled after Nazi Germany's defeat in 1945. In 1946 the Control Commission for Germany - British Element (CCG/BE) reconstituted the Province of Hanover as the State of Hanover and later the same year it merged with three smaller neighbouring reconstituted German states to form the new state of Lower Saxony within the British Zone of Occupation. The municipality of Amt Neuhaus was allocated to Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.

Los Angeles Board of Trade Building

Board of Trade Building is a historic building in Downtown Los Angeles that was opened in 1929. Located at the northwest corner of Main Street and Seventh Street, the building was designed by Claud Beelman and Alexander Curlett in the Beaux Arts style with Classical Revival influence. The building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2008 and is one of more than ten Claud Beelman buildings included in the National Register.
Upon completion, the building had of space and fourteen stores on the ground floor, with the remainder of the building utilized for offices. The building was the headquarters for the new California Stock Exchange starting in January 1930. The exchange's trading floor, located on the building's second floor, was patterned after the New York Stock Exchange, measured 89 by and was designed to accommodate 300 brokers. The exchange also included six trading posts with price indicators for 384 issues, a clearing-house, visitors' gallery, smoking-room for members, private offices for executives, committee rooms and locker rooms. The first trade recorded on the exchange in January 1930 involved 100 shares of "Bolsa Chica Oil 'A'."
The Board of Trade Building was the first on the Pacific Coast to be built with automated elevators that stopped automatically on the floors where buttons were pressed, and without the need for an operator in the elevator car.
In 1945, the Board of Trade Building was purchased for $1,250,000 by a syndicate represented by Gray Phelps & Co.
Like many of the old buildings in downtown Los Angeles, the building has been converted into live/work lofts.

Toyota Cresta

The Toyota Cresta was a rear wheel drive 4-door hardtop sedan built by Toyota and launched in 1980 that shared a chassis with the Mark II/Cressida, sold at Toyopet Store dealerships only in Japan. The goal of the Cresta was a higher level of luxury in comparison to the Mark II, and the Chaser was the performance oriented version of the Mark II, but sold at different dealerships. Often available with two-tone paint and more interior convenience options, with the result ending up being more similar to the Cressida sold in export markets. The Cresta was produced for five generations, and production eventually ceased in 2000, when it was merged with the Chaser to form the short lived Verossa, a sporty luxury car.
X50-X60 series (1980-1984).
The first Cresta was introduced April 1980 and was available exclusively at the renamed Toyota Vista Store (formerly Toyota Auto Store) sales channels across Japan, joining the recently introduced Chaser. The Cresta was positioned as a high-level luxury sedan just below the established, traditional luxury sedan, the Crown. The sales goal of the Cresta was to provide buyers with a luxury sedan, but not incur tax consequences for exceeding dimension regulations, the vehicle was limited to an engine size at 2000cc as well as dimensions under long, wide, and high. The Cresta was introduced with halogen headlights to provide a modern European appearance, and was available with a full range of luxury amenities and conveniences. The SOHC 2.0 L M-EU engine was used with an automatic transmission only, which was shared with the Crown, as well as the 2.0L 1G-EU straight six engine, also used in the Crown. Trim levels used names meant to suggest luxury overtones, such as Super Lucent, Super Touring, Super Deluxe, Super Custom, and Custom, names that were similarly used on the Crown. Upper level trim levels used two-tone paint schemes to further the Cresta's elevated status towards a younger demographic. The Nissan competitor was the Laurel.
This new luxury approach was well received with buyers. In August 1983, Toyota chairman Eiji Toyoda initiated the F1 project ("Flagship" and "No. 1 vehicle"; alternatively called the "Circle-F" project), a clandestine effort aimed at producing a world-class luxury sedan for international markets. This led to the creation of an all new, full size luxury sedan designed for export markets and was called the Lexus LS.
X70 series (1984-1988).
The X70 series was introduced March 8, 1984, with styling cues shared with the platform sharing Mark II, with the Cresta continuing to offer a hardtop bodystyle, while the Mark II remained a sedan. The X70 series continued to enjoy the popularity enjoyed by the first generation Cresta. Power side view mirrors were now installed western style at the leading edge of the front doors instead of on the front fenders above the front wheels to provide a more modern appearance, and retracted electrically for confined parking spaces. The 2.0 litre diesel engine used in the first generation was upgraded to one with 2.4 litres displacement. Styling upgrades were introduced in 1985, with a twin turbo 1G-GTEU introduced October 1985, with trim level designation GT Twin Turbo. As a result of the twin turbo introduction, the M-TEU engine was no longer offered. Foglights imbedded in the front bumper were made standard equipment, with a minor styling upgrade August 1986.
In 1986, the Cresta saw a new competitor from Honda called the Legend.
X80 series (1988-1992).
The third generation was introduced March 8, 1988. with a transition away from straight edges previously used by Toyota products of the period. The top-of-the-line model, called the Super Lucent G included a supercharger equipped 1G-GZE engine. The 1JZ-GE and 1JZ-GTE were shared with the Chaser. Special anniversary trim levels were introduced May 1990, with a body refresh introduced later that year.
X90 series (1992-1996).
The X90 Cresta debuted in 1992 with significant styling and mechanical changes over the X80. The car increased in size and gained some new trim levels similar to its sister cars, the Mark II and Chaser. Engines were carried over from the past generation albeit without the 7M or supercharged 1G I6's. Toyota also changed the front grille and taillight design in 1994. Under Japanese exterior dimension regulations, this series was no longer regarded as a "compact car".
The X90 Cresta was offered in 4 primary trim levels throughout its run (the SC, Suffire, Super Lucent and Tourer), each with their own options and even more specific trim categorizations. All cars shared common longitudinal layout architecture as well as certain options standard, like automatic climate control and side-impact bars, not mention driver-side airbags in 1995. The base trim level SC had very little in terms of options; it was powered by either a petrol or diesel engine mated to a 4-speed automatic. The next level Suffire had the same options available (or lack thereof) as the SC plus an optional 5-speed manual.
The Super Lucent however was a much different story: this trim offered 3 different straight 6 engines from 2.0L-3.0L mated to an electronically controlled 4-speed automatic with options like a moon roof or a factory LSD. Further differentiating Super Lucent models was the G package, which featured ABS, 15" wheels, cruise control and a leather interior. Permanent 4WD was offered as an option in 1993.
The Tourer trim levels all featured a 2.5L 1JZ straight 6, but with a few differences. The Tourer S had a naturally aspirated engine and only a 4-speed automatic whereas the Tourer V's came with a pair of turbochargers and the option of a 5-speed manual. All Tourers had front- and rear-stabilizer bars but only the Tourer V's came with traction control, ABS and an LSD standard. Tourer V's were very popular amongst enthusiasts and drifters due to their stiff chassis and power-to-weight ratio.
X100 series (1996-2001).
In 1996 the X100 series was released.

HMS Garland (1807)

HMS "Garland" was a 22-gun Royal Navy "Laurel"-class post ship. She was built by Richard Chapman at Bideford and launched on 5 May 1807. She saw action in the War of 1812 and was sold in 1817.
Career.
She was commissioned in March 1807 under Captain Header Whittier. On 11 November 1807 she sailed to the West Indies. She served under a number of captains there, including Rowland Bevan (1808), Thomas Thrush (1 May - August 1809), William Charlton (died 7 August 1810), William Henry Shirreff (18 November 1809 - 1811), Thomas Graves, and Thomas Huskisson (May 1811 to June 1812). Captain Richard Plummer Davies received promotion to Post-captain on 19 June 1812 and then took command of "Garland".
Prize taking.
On 28 July 1812, "Garland" recaptured the "Hassan", which was sailing to Havannah with a cargo of sundries. Five days later, "Garland" captured the "Superb", which was sailing to Boston in ballast. That same day, 2 August, "Garland" captured the "Dal", which was sailing to Newhaven with rum and sugar, and the "Madisonia", sailing to Alexandria with sugar
and hides.
On 13 September 1812 "Garland"s boats captured the American privateer "Poor Sailor". "Poor Sailor" was armed with one long 6-pounder gun and had a crew of 15 men. Then on 4 December "Garland" captured the brig "San Pedro", which was sailing from New Orleans to St. Domingo. 
Mediterranean.
In 1814 "Garland" was off the north coast of Spain, still under Davies. In 1815, following Napoleon's escape from Elba, the Admiralty sent "Garland" and "Undaunted" to the Adriatic, under the orders of Captain Charles Austen, brother of the novelist Jane Austen, in . Austen's mission was to co-operate with the Austrians and to intercept some Neapolitan warships. "Phoenix" and "Garland" watched two large frigates at Brindisi, while "Undaunted" cruised northwards along the coast. After the surrender of Naples, following the military convention of Casalanza, Austen persuaded the captains of the two Neapolitan frigates to switch their allegiance to the restored monarch, Ferdinand IV of Naples.
Next, "Phoenix", , "Garland" and sailed to the Greek Archipelago to look for a French squadron comprising the frigate "Junon", the 32-gun corvette "Victorieuse", two brigs and two schooners. The British objective was to prevent the French squadron capturing merchant vessels traversing the area and to suppress piracy. However, it turned out that the French had left the area; shortly afterwards peace was restored.
Fate.
In 1816 "Garland" was out of commission at Deptford. "Garland" was finally sold on 9 May 1817 to a Mr Hill for £1,500.

Marcello Mastrilli

Marcello Francesco Mastrilli (1603 – October 17, 1637) was an Italian Jesuit missionary who was martyred in Japan on Mount Unzen during the Tokugawa Shogunate, which had banned Christianity in 1614. After sailing for Japan out to find and possibly reconvert the notorious apostate Christavao Ferreira, who went to Japan and renounced his faith there, he was arrested as soon as he got off his ship. After three days of torture in the pit of Nagasaki, he was beheaded. A painting of his death, "Martyrdom of Saint Marcello Mastrilli" (1664), was made by Antonio Maria Vassallo.
Susceptible to visions, he was particularly influenced by visitations by the Jesuit missionary St. Francis Xavier, who appeared to him twice in 1633, and foretold him his martyrdom. St. Frances Xavier is credited with twice miraculously restoring Mastrilli's health (even if only to incite him to do missionary work in Japan), and since the account reportedly spread quickly through Italy, the "novena of grace," in honor of St. Francis Xavier, was established. Mastrilli's initiative is supposedly to thank for the presence of a silver casket in the Basilica of Bom Jesus in Old Goa, which houses relics of the body of St. Francis Xavier.

Nicholas Troy Sheley (born July 31, 1979) is an American ex-convict accused of eight murders across four towns in Illinois and Missouri. He was arrested on July 1, 2008 in Granite City, Illinois. A $25,000 reward was offered for information leading to his arrest. Federal authorities charged him with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.
Sheley, of Rock Falls, Illinois, had been arrested frequently since adolescence for crimes ranging from marijuana possession to domestic battery.
The day of his arrest, Sheley was seen at a St. Louis Cardinals game, where he asked to use a tailgater's cell phone. Sheley also requested that the man delete the phone numbers. However, police were able to trace the call back to a drug house in the Kirkwood area. This, coupled with statements from witnesses, led directly to Sheley's arrest.
Nicholas Sheley was convicted of the 1st Degree Murder of 65 year old Ronald Randall in Knox County, Illinois on September 29, 2011. His trial for the June 2008 murder of 93 year old Russell Reed began in Whiteside County, Illinois on October 22, 2012.

Guerau III de Cabrera

Guerau III de Cabrera (died 1160/1161), also called Guiraut (or Giraut) de Cabreira, was a Catalan nobleman and Occitan troubadour. He was the viscount of Àger and Cabrera from 1145. 
Guerau is today most famous for his "ensenhamen", a long didactic poem written for his jongleur, Cabra. Cabra's name, which means goat and is related to the name of his master's viscounty (Cabrera), probably indicates that he was Guerau's herald, since heralds often took the names of the arms of their lords. Guerau's arms bore a goat. 
The "ensenhamen" is divided into 216 lines. The rhyme scheme is of two four-syllable rhyming lines followed by an octosyllabic line ending in "-on", repeated. The entire poem is basically a disorderly and wordy catalogue the things (names, songs, and stories) which Cabra ought to know in his capacity as public entertainer, but which in fact he does not know. The eruditeness of the work is impressive, giving evidence of Guerau's learning, the writings he would have had access to in twelfth-century Catalonia, and the typical repertoire of a contemporary jongleur. 
The "ensenhamen" begins with twenty-four lines of criticism concerning what Cabra does not do. He is accused of "mal saps viular / e pietz chantar": poor knowledge of how to play the viol and worse still of singing. He cannot finish with a proper "Breton cadence" ("tempradura de breton"). Guerau goes on: 
Finally, Guerau lists the various genres and types of song which Cabra does not have in his repertoire: "sirventesc", "balaresc", "estribot", "retroencha", and "contenson". It is clear that by Guerau's time, Occitan lyric poetry had already witnessed a proliferation of genres. To the historian of culture, these twenty-four lines are an important source for the qualifications of a good jongleur.

A Puro Dolor

"A Puro Dolor" is a song recorded by Puerto Rican band Son by Four. It was written by Omar Alfanno and released as the first single of the second studio album of the band in 2000. Two versions of the track were produced for the album; one as a salsa and the other as a ballad. The ballad version was arranged by Alejandro Jaén. 
The song reached number-one on "Billboard" Top Latin Songs chart, and became the longest running chart topper of its history, spending 20 weeks at the top; this record was broken five years later by Colombian singer-songwriter Shakira with "La Tortura" which spent 25 weeks at number-one. "A Puro Dolor" also reached the "Billboard" 100; this led to the recording of an English-language version of the track "Purest of Pain", which was also charted in the United States.
The composition also met with critical acclaim receiving the Lo Nuestro Award, the Billboard Music Award and a Latin Grammy Award nomination. In 2009, "A Puro Dolor" was named the best-performing Latin single of the 2000s decade in the United States. Two music videos were made for the ballad and the English versions. The record was covered by Mexican group Dinora y la Juventud and Brazilian boy band KLB both of which received radio airplay. 
Background.
In 1998, Son by Four released their first album, "Prepárense". The success of the singles "Nada" and "No Hay Razón", distributed in Puerto Rico by the independent label RJO, captured the attention of the Sony Music CEO Oscar Llord, who made an agreement with RJO to re-release the album and start the recording sessions of the next album. The first single taken from the following album was "A Puro Dolor", written and arranged by Panamanian record producer Omar Alfanno, with a ballad version arranged by Alejandro Jaén. Alfanno, well known for his work with salsa recording singers Marc Anthony, Víctor Manuelle, Jerry Rivera and Gilberto Santa Rosa was in charge of the album production. Alfanno declared that he wrote the song in ten minutes, and that after the success of the track, he analyzed the composition, since he did not understand how "A Puro Dolor" became that popular. He named it "the Cinderella of all his songs."
Critical reception.
The song was released in the United States and Puerto Rico in February 2000. It became very successful with the ballad and tropical/salsa versions setting an airplay record for a Latin single with 23.4 million impressions in those countries. The reaction to the song was intense, and Son by Four was asked to record an English-language version of the track. This version, titled "Purest of Pain", was serviced to English-speaking radio stations in May 2000. The success of the song took by surprise the leader of the band, Ángel López, who told "Billboard" magazine: "When they told us we were going to be signed by Columbia for the single, we flipped." A ranchera version was also recorded for the Regional Mexican audience. About the song, López also declared that "has something everybody can relate to. We're adults, we've been all through that . The way the song reaches out to people is outstanding." In his album review for AllMusic, Evan C. Gutierrez declared that "A Puro Dolor" set "an impossibly high standard for the rest of the playlist." 
Son by Four received seven "Billboard" Latin Music Award nominations in 2001 for "Hot Latin Track of the Year", "Pop Track of the Year" and "Tropical/Salsa Track of the Year" ("A Puro Dolor"); "Tropical/Salsa Album of the Year, New Artist" and "Tropical/Salsa Album of the Year, Group" ("Son by Four"); and "Billboard Latin 50 Artist of the Year" and "Hot Latin Track Artist of the Year". With further nominations for Alfanno as "Songwriter of the Year" and Jaén for "Producer of the Year". Son by Four won all the awards, and Alfanno won the award for the writing of the song.
At the Lo Nuestro Awards of 2001, the group earned six awards; among them "Pop Song of the Year" and "Tropical Song of the Year". Alfanno also received a Latin Grammy Award nomination for the Best Tropical Song, which it lost to "El Niágara en Bicicleta" by Juan Luis Guerra. "A Puro Dolor" was given three "Billboard" Music Award in 2000 for Latin Track of the Year, Latin Pop Track of the Year, and Tropical/Salsa Track of the Year. At the 2001 ASCAP Latin Music Awards, Alfanno was awarded "Song of the Year" and "Pop/Balada Song of the Year" for his composition of the song and was named Songwriter of the Year.
Promotion.
To promote the single, Son by Four opened a Ricky Martin live performance in the Madison Square Garden in New York City. They also did a concert with the R&B trio Destiny's Child, and were presented in the 1st Latin Grammy Awards along with the boy band N'Sync, performing the medley "A Puro Dolor"/"Purest of Pain" with "This I Promise You"/"Yo Te Voy a Amar". The song was featured in the Mexican telenovela "Frente al Espejo", broadcast by Televisa. In 2000, due to the success of the track in the American market, they were asked to perform on "The Tonight Show" hosted by Jay Leno. The salsa version of the song was included on their greatest hits album "Salsa Hits" (2001) and "Lo Esencial" (2008) and on the compilation album "Salsahits 2001" (2000).
Two music videos were made for the song; the first one for the ballad version, and the other for the English version. The ballad version was directed by Felipe Niño. In the video, the group is shown performing the song along with an orchestra behind them. It is filmed on a stage where shows López singing his verses, while the others members of the group, follow up with the chorus. At the end of the video the people of the orchestra starts to applaud when the group ends to sing. In the English version of the video, the plot is completely different. The video starts in a cloudy afternoon after a storm, where the group is situated in a white room. It shows López singing in a ladder when it later starts to fill with water. At the last part of the video, it shows Son by Four singing out of the house after the storm has ended.
Chart performance.
"A Puro Dolor" reached the top spot of the "Billboard" Top Latin Songs, Latin Pop Songs and Tropical/Salsa charts with the song spending 20 weeks at number-one on the former chart. This chart run led the song to be named the best-performing Latin single of the 2000s decade. In the aforementioned chart only three songs have had similar week runs at the top: "Me Enamora" by Juanes and "Te Quiero" by Flex, with 20 weeks each, and "La Tortura" by Shakira featuring Alejandro Sanz with 25 non-consecutive weeks at the top. "Purest of Pain", the English version of the track, peaked at number twenty-six in the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart and ranked 61 at the "Billboard" Year-End Hot 100 singles of 2000. This exposure led to the parent album to receive a Gold certification in Argentina, Mexico, and the United States. "A Puro Dolor" ranked 1st at the Hot Latin Songs 25th Anniversary chart. "Purest of Pain" was also a modest success in Europe where it peaked at number seven and eighteen in the Flanders and Wallonia regions of Belgium and number three in the Netherlands.

Other recordings.
In 2000, Mexican group Dinora y la Juventud performed a cover "A Puro Dolor" in cumbia music. Their version peaked at number forty-six on the Hot Latin Songs chart and number fifteen on the "Billboard" Regional Mexican Songs chart. The success of their cover led to the group receiving a Lo Nuestro Award for New Regional Mexican Artist of the Year. A music video for the song was filmed for the group.
Piska, a Brazilian producer and composer, wrote the lyrics for a cover version of the song, which was recorded by the boy band KLB, and released in their homonymous debut album under the title "A Dor Desse Amor". It was later released as a single, and became the group's first single to play in radio stations in the country. The cover became a hit; it was the tenth most-played song in Brazilian radios in 2000.
In 2009, Son by Four recorded a new version of the track for their studio album "Abba Nuestro" which did not have López's involvement as he left the band in 2003. López himself recorded a new version of the track on his studio album "Historias de Amor" (2010) which features a cover of Alfanno's other compositions which was produced by Alfanno. He also recorded it as a duet with fellow Puerto Rican singer Ana Isabelle on her studio album "Mi Sueño" (2010).

Historic bridges of the Atlanta area

There were several historic bridges around the metro Atlanta, Georgia area, for which many of its current-day roads are named. Many of them originated as ferries, dating back to the 1820s and 1830s, and carrying travelers across the Chattahoochee River and several other smaller rivers. Several were also covered bridges, a very few of which remain as historic sites.
Abbott's Bridge.
Crossed the Chattahoochee River near present day Johns Creek and Duluth
Brown's Bridge.
Brown's Bridge was a covered bridge located between Cumming and Gainesville, over the Chattahoochee River. It was carried downstream but intact in 1946, by a major flood on February 7. Divers have reported it still intact under 120 feet or 36.5 meters of Lake Lanier, which filled the river a few years later. [http://wwwb.dot.ga.gov/specialsubjects/specialinterest/covered/graveyd/index.shtml]
Browns Bridge Road (part of Georgia 369) still exists east of Georgia 9 at Coal Mountain. Just upstream of the original bridge location, a modern bridge carries the road over the lake. To see more information on the modern Browns Bridge, click Browns Bridge
A different Brown Bridge (not Browns) was located near Covington.
Cheshire Bridge.
One of the most well known in the area crossed the south fork of Peachtree Creek to connect Hezekiah Cheshire's home in what is now the Virginia-Highland neighborhood to his sons' farms on the other side of the creek.
Concord Covered Bridge.
The Concord Covered Bridge is still located on Covered Bridge Road (past Concord Road) west of Smyrna, and is part of the county historic district named for it. It still carries cars over Nickajack Creek, but is one lane at a time. The Silver Comet Trail also runs over the creek on a former railroad trestle very nearby. The East-West Connector, completed in 1997, was designed to protect the area by not connecting to Concord Road, thereby reducing potential traffic counts on the bridge.
Grimes Bridge.
Located over Vickery Creek (Big Creek) in Roswell, just north of the Chattahoochee River. Since July 2008, Grimes Bridge Road is closed until 2009 to replace the bridge.[http://www.roswellgov.com/index.php/m/articles/id/392]
Haynes Bridge.
Located near Alpharetta.
Holcomb Bridge.
The Holcomb Bridge was over the Chattahoochee River, on what is now the edge of the city of Johns Creek. Holcomb Bridge Road carries Georgia 140, becoming Crossville Road (Georgia 92, as 140 turns north onto Alpharetta Highway to Houze Road) near downtown Roswell in the northwest, and Jimmy Carter Boulevard upon crossing Peachtree Industrial Boulevard near downtown Norcross in the southeast. Because it is so heavily traveled and densely developed as an arterial road, it is probably the most well-known "bridge" road in the area, along with Cheshire Bridge Road. There is also Old Holcomb Bridge Road, a previous alignment of part of the road northwest of the interchange with Georgia 400, since that freeway was built in the late 1960s.
Howell Bridge.
Unlike Howell Mills and Howell Ferry, located near exurban Canton.
Hudson Bridge.
Located near Stockbridge.
Jones Bridge.
Formerly Jones Ferry.
Jones Bridge spanned the Chattahoochee River from 1904-1922 falling into disrepair in the 1930s. Half of the bridge was "stolen" in 1940, neighbors didn't know the workers cutting the bridge were not authorized to do so until it was too late.
Keith's Bridge.
Located near Gainesville, Keith's Bridge was a covered bridge over the Chestatee River. Burned in the late 1940s, it is also now submerged under Lake Lanier. Keith Bridge Road still exists today.
Kimball Bridge.
Located near Alpharetta.
Medlock Bridge.
Located near Duluth.
Settles Bridge.
Located in Suwanee, and is now a unit of the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area.
Sope Creek covered bridge.
Carrying Paper Mill Road over Sope Creek next to the Marietta Paper Mill, it was burned by arsonists in 1967.
State Bridge.
State Bridge was located between Johns Creek and Duluth, over the Chattahoochee River and the Fulton/Gwinnett (originally Milton/Gwinnett) county line. It still carries Georgia 141 (State Bridge Road / Pleasant Hill Road) over the river, very near State Bridge Crossing Elementary School on the Fulton side.
Webb Bridge.
Located in Alpharetta.

Gau East Prussia

Gau East Prussia was formed in 1933 in Nazi Germany initially as a district within the Free State of Prussia. In 1935, Germany's constituent states were dissolved and the gaus replaced the states and their responsibilities.
In 1939, East Prussia expanded following the annexation of the Klaipėda Region from Lithuania and the occupation of Poland, while a sliver of territory from the gau was transferred to Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia.
After Germany's attack on the USSR, the Belarusian city of Hrodna () also became part of the gau.
After the war, the territory of the former gau became part of the RSFSR enclave of Kaliningrad in the Soviet Union, major sections were given to Poland, and the area of the Klaipėda Region was returned to the Lithuanian SSR and Hrodna - to the Belarusian SSR within the Soviet Union.

Hendrick Dubbels

Hendrick Dubbels or Hendrick Jacobsz. Dubbels and variants (1621–1707) was a Dutch Golden Age painter of marine subjects and winter landscapes, who spent much of his career working in the studios of other marine artists. 
Dubbels was born and lived his entire life in Amsterdam. He was the son of a diamond-cutter, and baptised in the Oude Kerk on May 2, 1621. He married in 1651 and again in 1656, when he described himself as a "painter", but he is described as a "shopkeeper" in 1663 and 1665, when he was made bankrupt. He had been a "winkelier" or haberdasher-draper, "selling caps, bonnets and stockings". This was presumably an unsuccessful attempt to escape from the highly competitive Amsterdam art world. His earliest dated work is a drawing from 1641, with a dated painting from 1643. His marine style was initially based on that of Jan Porcellis, then that of Simon de Vlieger in whose studio he worked c. 1650-3, bringing him into contact with Jan van de Cappelle. 
The 1650s were the period of his best work, including his winter landscapes, which were strongly influenced by those of Jan van de Cappelle, as were his tranquil marine scenes. He then worked for Willem van de Velde the Elder and his son Willem II until they left for London after the rampjaar ("Year of Disasters") of 1672. In the late 1650s or early 1660s he trained Ludolf Bakhuizen, the leading Dutch marine painter of the last decades of the century, for whom he later worked. Abraham Storck was another influence on his later work, which declined sharply in quality from the 1680s. In his last years he painted inferior replicas of his own earlier works and those of others. He was buried in the Nieuwe Zuids chapel on October 20, 1707 - a recent archival discovery, before which he was often said, following Bredius, to have died, or at least vanished from view, in the late 1670s. 
There are works in the National Gallery (right) and National Maritime Museum in London, the Louvre and many other collections.

Harpacochampsa is a poorly known Early Miocene crocodilian from the Bullock Creek lagerstatte of the Northern Territory. The current specimen consists of a partial skull and fragments of a slender snout reminiscent of that of a false gharial. It is tentatively placed within Mekosuchinae, though some experts disagree with this, as "H. camfieldensis" would be the only known mekosuchine with a long, thin snout. Its long snout demonstrates that it was a piscivore in life.

Prosecution association

A prosecution association was an organization of citizens, typically in the same community, who paid dues to cover one another's costs of privately prosecuting offenders should a crime be committed against them. 
These were particularly popular in places and times when there was no public police force (the first public police force in Britain was established in 1829) and when citizens were allowed to prosecute offenders directly rather than relying on public prosecutors. The prosecution associations sometimes also provided crime insurance to their members, and would go after offenders in an effort to obtain restitution.

Crime insurance

Crime insurance is insurance to manage the loss exposures resulting from criminal acts such as robbery, burglary and other forms of theft. It is also called "fidelity insurance". Many businesses purchase crime insurance that allows them to file claims for employee theft or other offenses with the potential to cause financial ruin.
Because crime insurance loss exposures can vary significantly among policyholders and require special underwriting skills, insurers prefer to insure certain types of crime insurance loss under separate Commercial Crime Insurance forms. These forms allow organizations to cover crime losses that are not insured under other insurance policies.
Briefly described, commercial crime insurance covers money, securities and other property against a variety of criminal acts, such as employee theft, robbery, forgery, extortion and computer fraud. Many insurers use Insurance Service Office's (ISO's) commercial crime forms.
The ISO Commercial Crime Coverage form includes these eight insuring agreements:
Some organizations buy crime insurance instead of a surety bond. 
Anarcho-capitalists favor the use of crime insurance by individuals as well, to cover losses due to murder, rape, and other violent crimes in addition to property crimes; this type of crime insurance is termed aggression insurance.

The Dart Center's mission is to improve the quality of journalism on traumatic events, while also raising awareness in newsrooms of the impact such coverage has on the journalists telling the stories.
The Dart Center has conducted seminars, training and support programs for journalists covering the attacks of September 11, 2001, Hurricane Katrina, the Boxing Day tsunami, the Troubles in Northern Ireland, the Iraq War and the Virginia Tech shootings, among other events. The Dart Center's director is the American journalist Bruce Shapiro.
History and programs.
The Dart Center for Journalism and Trauma was founded at the University of Washington in 1999 to nurture innovation in ethical reporting on victims of violence and tragedy. Among its founders were Roger Simpson, a professor of communication at UW and the Center's director until 2006, and Frank Ochberg, a psychiatrist and authority on post traumatic stress disorder. It was named for its principal funder, the Dart Foundation. The Dart Center re-located to Columbia University in the spring of 2009.
Among the Dart Center's programs are the annual Dart Center Awards for Excellence in Reporting on Trauma (given annually since 1994) and the fellowship program, called after one of its founders Frank Ochberg which is aimed at mid career journalists who want to deepen their knowledge of emotional trauma and improve coverage of violence, conflict and tragedy, among whom six to ten journalists are selected every year to attend an intensive weeklong seminar program, including discussions with journalist colleagues, and the annual conference of the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies. As of November 2008, 80 journalists — from 19 states and seven nations — had been selected for Dart Center Ochberg Fellowship.
The Dart Center has also encouraged and led research on the psychological impact of reporting traumatic events on journalists, and encouraged the development of training and support programs at leading news organizations. Its affiliate Dart Centre in Europe has developed programs for the BBC and other news organizations. Dart Centre Australasia works actively with journalists in Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Cambodia and elsewhere in the region.

Aryandes

Aryandes was the Persian satrap of Egypt in the late sixth century BCE. He was first appointed in c. 525 BCE by Cambyses, the Persian conqueror of Egypt. In 521 BCE, Aryandes probably dealt with a rebellion led by a local dynast named Petubastis. By 510, Aryandes fell foul of the reigning Persian monarch, Darius I, and was executed.

Svendborg Friary

Svendborg Friary was a Franciscan friary in Svendborg, on the island of Funen, in the present Region of Southern Denmark, and was one of the earliest Franciscan foundations in Denmark. Like almost all Danish religious houses it was dissolved during the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century.
History.
The first Franciscan establishment in Svendborg was the chapel built in 1236. This building was destroyed when the town of Svendborg was burned to the ground by King Abel of Denmark in 1247 after a short siege. Another friary was built in about 1288 as the result of a gift of land for a chapel for the Franciscans from Herr Astrad Frakke, Herr Niels Bille (the brother of Bishop Johannes Bille), Herr Niels Beger and several other local nobles. Count Gert of Holstein and his son also made gifts of properties to support the Franciscan friars in Svendborg. In 1268 Lady Gro Gunnarsdatter Vint, the extremely wealthy widow of Esbjørn Vognsen, gave away her considerable fortune to abbeys, priories and friaries throughout Denmark when she joined the Poor Clares in Roskilde. The "brothers' [friars'] chapel at Svendborg" is specifically mentioned in the list of her beneficiaries.
The Gothic church was completed in 1361 and was dedicated to Saint Catherine. Svendborg was burned by the Hanseatic Fleet in 1389, after which the friary was rebuilt yet again. During the 15th century it expanded considerably, and the buildings were extended several times. 
The main friary precinct of this period consisted of a rectangular enclosure containing a church, dormitory, refectory, and servants' quarters, as well as a cloister surrounding a central garden. The buildings were constructed from red brick, the most common building material at the time. 
The friary had a close connection with St. George's Chapel and Hospital just outside Svendborg, the last remaining medieval leper hospital in Denmark.
One of the most controversial times for the friary was in 1500 when Queen Christina, who was at that point in direct control of Svendborg, gave the whole of Bysen Street ("Bysenstræde") to the Franciscans to use as accommodation for the town's poor and sick in their care. The mayor and the town council strongly disapproved of this action, which caused a severe rift between the town and the friary.
Dissolution.
During the short civil war known as the Count's Feud (Danish:Grevens Fejde), Svenborg made the mistake of siding with Count Christoffer acting for Christian II. When Christian III's troops took Svenborg and the rest of Fynen in 1534, they pillaged the town and its churches. With the Lutherans now firmly in control of the town and country, the priory was permanently closed, though by the end of 1530 it had been abandoned by the Franciscans. The last guardian of the priory, Hans Gaas, quickly accepted the Lutheran Ordinances and became the first Lutheran pastor of Our Lady's Church (Danish:Vor Frue Kirke) in Svendborg. The priory was taken over by the town. The friars went to other Franciscan houses outside Denmark or returned to secular life.
The friary church became a parish church for the people of Svendborg. East wing was demolished shortly after the Reformation. The west wing of the priory was converted into a Latin school which operated until 1740. The buildings where the Latin School had been located were torn down in 1875. In 1586 the north wing of the friary was turned into a hospital founded by Lady Helvig Hardenberg. The old hospital was torn down in 1870.
After dissolution.
By 1828 the former friary church had fallen into serious disrepair and the town council decided to demolish it. The buildings were blown up, the ground levelled and the site in the town centre redeveloped with houses and shops: some buildings used parts of the old friary walls as foundations. The churchyard containing thousands of common and noble graves was cleared and the most recently buried bodies transferred to a cemetery a few streets away. The altarpiece however was preserved and is now located in Thurø Church.
Recent excavations by Svendborg Museum have revealed that the later friary complex was much larger than was previously thought, and contained many structures in addtition to the old rectangular layout.

St. Paul's Hospital (Saskatoon)

St. Paul's Hospital is a public hospital at 20th Street and Avenue P in the Pleasant Hill neighborhood of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. St. Paul's works with the Saskatoon Health Region in an interdependent partnership. The hospital is owned by the Saskatchewan Catholic Health Corporation and was founded by the Grey Nuns.
St. Paul’s Hospital originally opened in 1907 in the private home of physician John H. C. Willoughby due to an outbreak of typhoid while the Canadian Pacific Railway was building a bridge in Saskatoon with the assistance of the Grey Nuns. The current hospital opened in 1913. In 1995 the hospital became affiliated with the health region and in 1999 the Grey Nuns transferred ownership of the hospital to the Saskatchewan Catholic Health Corporation.

The Tale of the Priest and of His Workman Balda (film)

The Tale of the Priest and of His Workman Balda is an extant Soviet animation feature film by Mikhail Tsekhanovsky based on the eponymous fairy tale in verse by Alexander Pushkin. The only surviving episode (4 mins) is called "Bazar (Marketplace)" ([http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0817882/]).
A screenplay for the film was written in the 1930s by the director Mikhail Tsekhanovskiy. Work began in 1933. In the same year, the director contacted the young composer Dimitri Shostakovich and asked him to write music to accompany the film. Shostakovich wrote some music for the film in 1933-34 but never completed the score because of the 1936 denunciation of his work in the form of the "Pravda" article "Muddle Instead of Music". Partially because the film now had no score, work on it was stopped and it was never completed. Other reasons included production difficulties and a general lack of organization at the studio. Although the film was nearly finished, it was put into storage at the Lenfilm archives, where almost all of it was lost in a fire during the Second World War. [http://theatre.perm.ru/premier/balda.shtml The 6-minute scene of the market from the tale is all that survives and it stands alone as a classic of Russian animated films. [http://animator.ru/db/?p=show_film&fid=6310] 
Music.
After Shostakovich died, his widow arranged to have the score completed by one of Shostakovich's students, Vadim Bibergan. The world premiere recording of the 50-minute work was made by the Russian Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Thomas Sanderling and released in 2006, a century after Shostakovich's birth. [http://www.arkivmusic.com/classical/album.jsp?album_id=139082]
The score was published in 2005, in volume 126 of DSCH Publishers' "New Collected Works of Dmitri Shostakovich". [http://www.devinci.fr/chostakovitch/BILINGUE/150.htm] This publication contains text in Russian and English.

H3 receptor antagonist

An H3-receptor antagonist is a classification of drugs used to block the action of histamine at the H3 receptor. Unlike the H1 and H2 receptors which have primarily peripheral actions, but cause sedation if they are blocked in the brain, H3 receptors are primarily found in the brain and are inhibitory autoreceptors located on histaminergic nerve terminals, which modulate the release of histamine. Histamine release in the brain triggers secondary release of excitatory neurotransmitters such as glutamate and acetylcholine via stimulation of H1 receptors in the cerebral cortex. Consequently unlike the H1 antagonist antihistamines which are sedating, H3 antagonists have stimulant and nootropic effects, and are being researched as potential drugs for the treatment of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.
Examples of selective H3 antagonists include clobenpropit, ABT-239, ciproxifan, Conessine, and A-349,821.

Klein Lengden

Klein Lengden is a village in the Gleichen in the Göttingen district of Lower Saxony, Germany, about eight to ten kilometers south-east of Göttingen. According to the 2010 census, it has about 1363 inhabitants. The village lies in the Garte valley, south of the forested hills of Lengderburg (384 meters a.s.l.) with its Lengdener Burg (castle) and Westerberg (340 meters a.s.l.) and is otherwise surrounded by farm fields. The nearest neighboring villages are Gross Lengden to the east and Diemarden to the west-south-west, each of which is about two kilometers distant.
Just outside of the village, on L569, the road to Benniehausen, is the Historische Spinnerei Gartetal (historical spinning works of the Garte Valley). In the late 16th century, a flour mill was erected on the site. In the middle of the following century, a paper mill was added. The Industrial Revolution led to the conversion to a spinnery for flannel and woolen yarn.
History.
The earliest known record of the town was as "Lengithi" or "Lengidi" in A.D. 822 in the Fulda monastery's "Codex Eberhardi".
During most of the years in which the Garte Valley Railway operated, Klein Lengden was one of the stations, closing in 1957, two years before the disbandenment of the line, which ran between Göttingen and Duderstadt.

Irina Baronova

Irina Mikhailovna Baronova FRAD (; March 13, 1919 – June 28, 2008) was a Russian ballerina and actress who was one of the Baby Ballerinas of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, discovered by George Balanchine in Paris in the 1930s. She created roles in Léonide Massine's "Le Beau Danube" (1924), "Jeux d'enfants" (1932), and "Les Présages" (1933); and in Bronislava Nijinska's "Les Cent Baisers" (1935).
Biography.
Baronova was born in Saint Petersburg (then known as Petrograd) in 1919, the daughter of a lieutenant in the Imperial Navy, Mikhail Baronov, and his wife Lidia (née Vishniakova). When she was less than two years old, her family moved to Romania. Ballet lessons with a local teacher convinced Baronova's mother that her daughter was exceptionally talented, so the family moved to Paris in 1928 to provide Irina with professional training, where she was taught by Olga Preobrajenska. She also studied with fellow ballerina Mathilde Kschessinska. Baronova made her debut aged 11 at the Paris Opera in 1930.
The crucial point in Baronova's career came in 1932, just a few months short of her thirteenth birthday. She, along with two other girls, Tamara Toumanova, 12, and Tatiana Riabouchinska, 14, were hired by George Balanchine to become ballerinas in the newly formed Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. Their extreme youth and technical perfection won them fame around the world and the writer Arnold Haskell dubbed the trio of Baronova, Toumanova and Riabouchinska the "Baby Ballerinas".
Baronova's first principal role was Odette in "Swan Lake", partnered by Anton Dolin, which she performed at just 14 years old. At age 17 she eloped with an older Russian, German (Jerry or Gerry) Sevastianov. They had a church wedding in Sydney, Australia, two years later, when she was on tour. She joined the Ballet Theatre in the USA, under the patronage of Sol Hurok. Her marriage to Sevastianov ended in divorce, and in Britain in 1946 she met the agent Cecil Tennant, who asked her to marry him if she would give up ballet. Aged only 27, she agreed, and retired.
Between 1940 and 1951, Baronova appeared in several films, including Ealing Studios "Train of Events" (1949) and worked as ballet mistress for the 1980 film "Nijinsky".
Baronova and Tennant had three children, Victoria, Irina and Robert. Through Victoria, she became the mother-in-law of Steve Martin. In 1967, Cecil Tennant was killed in a car accident, and Baronova moved to Switzerland. Later, she resumed her relationship with her first husband, Jerry Sevastianov, who died in 1974. She returned to teaching master classes in the United States and United Kingdom in 1976. Margot Fonteyn asked her to conduct a training course for teachers. In 1986 she staged Fokine's "Les Sylphides" for The Australian Ballet. In 1992 she returned to Russia to help the Mariinsky Theatre with an archival project. In 1996 she received a Vaslav Nijinsky Medal from Poland and an honorary doctorate from the North Carolina School of the Arts.
Baronova's daughter Irina moved to Byron Bay, New South Wales, Australia, and, after visiting her in 2000, Baronova decided to settle there as well. Baronova appeared in the 2005 documentary "Ballets Russes". In the same year she published her autobiography, "Irina: Ballet, Life and Love", which she wrote in longhand despite having lost much of her sight.
Baronova was a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Dance (FRAD) and its vice-president; she was also a patron of the Australian Ballet School.
Only five weeks before her death, she spoke at a symposium in Adelaide, South Australia, on the Ballets Russes tours of Australia. She died in Byron Bay on June 28, 2008, aged 89.

Gifu Bus

Branch offices.
Gifu Bus operates 11 offices in the area, three of which are located within the city of Gifu. The other locations within Gifu Prefecture include Yamagata, Mino, Seki, Gujō, Kakamigahara and Ginan. The final location is in neighboring Aichi Prefecture's Nishiharu.
Drivers' nameplates indicate the branch to which they belong, so some nameplates indicate branch offices that have been closed, moved or merged and are not included in the list above.
Fares.
Gifu Bus' local routes are divided into regions and fares vary based on the distance traveled between the boarding and unboarding locations. The base fare is 200 yen, though reduced fares are available for children and the elderly. Riders can take a numbered ticket when boarding the bus, with their fare indicated on a board at the front of the bus as they get off.
Until March 31, 2007, riders were able to use prepaid fare cards to pay for their fare. These cards were available in various denominations and offered riders a bonus of 5–15%, depending on the denomination purchased. These prepaid cards were replaced by the "Ayuca" smart cards, which first went on sale on December 1, 2006. Like the prepaid cards, these smart cards replaced cash and gave bonuses to riders when they recharged their cards. Both systems were used simultaneously for four months until the prepaid cards were stopped.
Vehicles.
The majority of the buses in use were made by Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation, because those were the buses used by Nagoya Railroad when the routes began. However, the buses run by Gifu were models made by either Isuzu or Nissan Diesel, so there is some variety among bus types. Additionally, some buses were purchased from Kawasaki Heavy Industries many years ago; these buses have been refurbished and are still in use.
In 2005, Gifu Bus began using non-step buses from Hino Motors to accommodate the aging population of the area. The company also uses hybrid buses made by Mitsubishi that were first used in Expo 2005 in neighboring Aichi Prefecture; most of these buses are operated by the Yanagase Branch Office. Hino Motors provided the hybrid buses used exclusively on the Shinai Loop Line.
The sightseeing and highway buses generally use Mitsubishi buses, but there are also a few made by Mercedes-Benz. Some of the larger model buses were built by the Belgian company Van Hool.
Routes.
The company's bus routes are listed below, separated by the branch office which manages them. (Note: Not all branch offices run bus lines.)
HIndicates highway lines
Designations.
Each route listed above (other than the Gifu City Loop Line, the Yana Bus, the Community Bus, the School bus as Ōno Kitakō and Kagashima Ōhashi Line, and the Highway Lines) are designated with both a letter and a two-digit number. All routes run through Meitetsu Gifu Station along eight main trunks, so each line is divided into one of eight groups. The numbering indicates how far from Meitetsu Gifu Station the final destination is (e.g. a bus numbered "80" would travel further than a bus numbered "50"). The eight letters and their respective areas are listed below.
Late night routes.
Three of the routes have a few buses that run beyond normal operating hours, allowing commuters and other people to catch a late bus home. The charge for these buses is twice the normal fare and they do not run on Saturdays, Sundays or holidays.
School routes.
Gifu Bus operates shuttle buses to two local universities—Asahi University and Gifu University. The route to Asahi University is jointly operated by the Gifu, Gifu West and Kakigase branch offices. The Gifu University route is part of the Kenchō Gidai Line and is run by the Kakigase Branch Office.

George L. Engel

George Libman Engel (December 10, 1913 – November 26, 1999) was an American psychiatrist. He spent most of his career at the University of Rochester Medical Center in Rochester, New York. He is best known his formulation of the biopsychosocial model, a general theory of illness and healing.
Early life.
Engel was born in New York City in 1913. He completed his undergraduate degree in chemistry from Dartmouth College in 1934. In the same year, he entered Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland to study medicine. He received his medical degree in 1938.
Academic career.
After completing his medical degree, Engel began an internship at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. There physicians such as Eli Moschowitz and Lawrence Kubie were incorporating psychosomatics into the clinical service. At the time, Engel was skeptical of psychoanalysis and psychosomatic medicine. He was committed to purely physical explanations of disease processes.
Engel began a Research Fellowship in Medicine at Harvard Medical School and also Graduate Assistant in Medicine at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital (now Brigham and Women's Hospital) in 1941. He came under the supervision of physician Soma Weiss, who at this time was becoming interested in psychosomatics. At this time, he first met with psychiatrist John Romano. Romano had arrived in Boston several years before Engel. With the encouragement from Weiss, Engel and Romano collaborated on a study of delusional patients. In 1942, Romano became chairman of the psychiatry department at the University of Cincinnati. Romano invited Engel to join the faculty at Cincinnati and Engel accepted the invitation. At this point Engel "converted" to the psychosomatic school.
University of Rochester.
Romano was given the opportunity to establish an entirely new psychiatry department at the School of Medicine and Dentistry of the University of Rochester Medical Center in 1946. Engel joined Romano in Rochester. He had dual appointments in psychiatry and medicine departments. He was responsible for establishing a medical psychiatric liaison service staffed largely by internists. He became deeply involved in the incorporation of psychiatric training in the medical school curriculum, and also began his own training in psychoanalysis.
Engel began collaboration with Franz Reichsman on the Monica project, a study which extended from Monica's infancy to adulthood, in 1953. By the mid-1950s, he was considered as one of the major figures in psychosomatic studies. He was prominent in the American Psychosomatic Society. He also edited its journal, "Psychosomatic medicine" and began publishing numerous books and articles on the relation of emotion and disease and on the incorporation of these ideas into medical training and clinical practice. Under his direction, the program at the university became a leading center in the development of psychosomatic theory and training. His ideas came to be termed as the biopsychosocial model.
The fundamental assumption of the biopsychosocial model is that health and illness are consequences of the interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors. This concept is particularly important in health psychology. This model was theorised by Engel at Rochester and putatively discussed in a 1977 article in the journal "Science".
Later years.
In his later years, Engel never lost his sense of humor and his generosity. He was admired by his students and physicians who worked with him. He died suddenly of heart failure in 1999.
Awards and honors.
Engel received many awards and honors from the American College of Physicians and the American Psychiatric Association for his work.

Early life.
Rama Varma was born on August 13, 1968 and is a member of the Royal Family of Travancore, although he does not care for this to be emphasised. His ancestors include Swati Tirunal and Raja Ravi Varma.
Varma harboured an early interest in becoming a veterinary surgeon but a chance opportunity to sing changed his path. He began learning music in 1982 with the encouragement and financial support of his great-grandmother. He was taught by Vechoor Harihara Subramania Iyer, Trivandrum R.Venkataraman and K. S. Narayanaswamy before becoming a disciple of Mangalampalli Balamuralikrishna.
Music career.
Rama Varma gave his maiden public performance in 1990 and released his first CD at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London. He has taken influences from other forms of music and has performed in India and also in countries such as Dubai, France, Germany, Kuwait, The Netherlands, the UK and the US. Among his notable venues have been Zuiderpershuis in Belgium, the Royal Tropen Institute in Amsterdam and the Korzo Theatre in The Hague. He was invited to perform at the Rashtrapathi Bhavan by the then President of India, A. P. J. Abdul Kalam.
Varma is regarded as an expert on the compositions of both Swathi Thirunal and Balamuralikrishna. He frequently gives lecture demonstrations in South Indian Classical Music particularly on Balamuralikrishna's compositions and regularly contributes articles about Indian music to newspapers such as "The Hindu".
Varma is a fan of Indian singers Kishan Kishore and K. L. Saigal, as well as of world music stars such as Jade Eru, Fairouz and Googoosh. He spends up to 16 hours a day practicing, studying, experimenting with and listening to music.
Music festivals.
Varma organises Swathi Sangeethotsavam, a festival commemorating Swati Thirunal that is held annually at Kuthira Malika in Thiruvananthapuram.
The Navarathri Mandapam Concerts held every year in connection with the Navarathri Festival at Trivandrum are also organised by Varma. In 2006, he picked veteran Parasala Ponnammal to perform there, breaking a 300-year old tradition of not allowing women inside the Mandapam.

Districts of Colombia

The Districts in Colombia are cities that have a feature that highlights them, such as its location and trade, history or tourism. Arguably, the districts are special municipalities.
The first districts were Bogotá, Barranquilla, Cartagena and Santa Marta, which were created by the original version of the Constitution of 1991. However the Act 02 changed the Constitution and included as districts Cúcuta, Popayán, Tunja, Buenaventura, Turbo and Tumaco.
Significantly, it was not until 1954 when it created the first district was called Special District of Bogotá until 1991 when it takes its current name during this year and increase the numbers of districts in Colombia to 4 with the three major cities of northern Colombia: Barranquilla, Cartagena and Santa Marta, until July 2007 that increased to 10 with 3 cities and 3 seaports: capitals were: Cúcuta, Popayán and Tunja, the port were Turbo Antioquia and Uraba in the Pacific port: Buenaventura and Tumaco.

Wesley Church, Perth

Wesley Church is at 75 William Street at its intersection with Hay Street in Perth, Western Australia. It is one of the oldest church buildings and one of few remaining 19th-century colonial buildings in the City of Perth.
Built form.
Wesley Church is built of load-bearing brick laid in Flemish bond in the Victorian academic gothic style and features a landmark spire, steeply pitched roofs, parapeted gables, label (hood) moulds and wall buttressing. The church has a strong verticality of form emphasised by tall lancet windows with plate tracery to the east facade. Angle buttresses divide the nave wall into five bays and the major windows have stucco label moulds above them. The bricks of the building, fired at uncertain temperatures in wood-burning kilns, show a range of mellow tones and, laid in Flemish bond, create a chequerboard effect on the walls, which provides a decorative element to the walls of the building. The spire is 35 metres high with a weathercock on top; it is surrounded by four smaller spires at its base which are capped by metal finials. The north-east tower replicates these smaller spires above the gable. The roof structure is of hand-sawn timber and the roof covering was originally shingles, but at some point the Church was re-roofed in clay tiles.
History.
The first Methodists arrived in the Swan River Colony on 3 February 1830 aboard the Tranby, to found a small religious community six kilometres (four miles) upstream along the Swan River from the newly established town of Perth (approximately on the site of the current suburb of Maylands). The group was led by Joseph Hardey and John Wall Hardey, and included a surgeon, preacher, bricklayer, blacksmith, shoemaker, surveyor, hatter, midshipman and several farmers. 
The site for the church was purchased from James Inkpen (the first recorded Methodist to arrive in the colony, having arrived in December 1829) at a cost of ₤400. The new church was the third Methodist place of worship to be built in the forty years in which the denomination had been established in the colony. The original church was subsequently used as a caretaker's cottage; the second was used for Sunday School, then an armoury and then a store. George Shenton (another prominent Methodist, the first Mayor of Perth, and a Member of the Western Australian Legislative Council) had earlier suggested that the name of the church be Wesley Church, and promised £1,000 to establish the building fund, with Joseph Hardey contributing a further ₤500.
Wesley Church was designed by Richard Roach Jewell, an architect, circuit steward, clerk of colonial works and church member. Jewell was responsible for the design of a number of other prominent Perth buildings, including the Cloisters (1858), the Pensioner Barracks (1863), and extensions and alterations to Government House (1864) and Perth Town Hall (1870). Jewell designed Wesley Church in the fashionable Gothic revival style, a style which he successfully adapted in his other buildings. Jewell's plan for Wesley Church, comprising the nave, chancel and bell tower with a tall and elegant spire, was accepted with one alteration - the relocation of the bell tower from the north-east side to the south-east side.
The foundation stone was laid on 25 October 1867 by Governor John Stephen Hampton. The church was opened on Sunday 10 April 1870 with services by Reverend William Lowe (who married Joseph Hardey's daughter Mary Jane), Rev. W. Traylen and Rev. T.C. Laurence. The total cost of the building was about ₤3,000 - a considerable sum for a church membership of 138 (with a quarterly income of a little over ₤66). The original bricks were made from local clay pits and the floor is made of jarrah. The church bell, originally hanging in the southern tower, came from the sailing ship Tranby, which brought the original members of the congregation to the colony.
In June 1875 the first church organ in the colony was installed at Wesley Church, a Bishop and Son instrument of two manuals and pedal with 15 speaking stops.
In 1880 a clergy vestry, choir vestry and organ loft were added to the Church at a cost of ₤385. In 1896 further alterations and additions were made, including the construction of the north-east tower (which buried the original foundation stone), the side galleries, the ceiling to the nave and the south-west porch. These alterations were undertaken by Talbot Hobbs (a prominent Perth-based architect) at a cost of ₤1,150. 
The Meckering earthquake of October 1968 caused structural damage to the church's steeple. A decision was made to demolish the steeple but, when approximately 30 ft was removed, the remainder of the structure appeared secure and so a copper cone was placed on top to replace the damaged section. The bell was also removed from the tower as it was considered that the structure was too weak to support its weight. The bell was then mounted on display outside on the Hay Street side of the church.
In 1974 redevelopment occurred on the north-west and south-west sides of the church site with the construction of the Wesley Arcade and Tower, which opened in May 1976. During these developments a small chapel was constructed at the north-west corner of the church. Wesley Church continued to be used as an active centre of worship and in 1997 the Methodist congregation joined the Uniting Church of Australia. In 1985 the Church launched a Restoration Fund through the National Trust of Australia (WA) to restore the external brick walls, gables, parapets and high part of the tower brickwork. Restoration works were finally completed in mid 1987.
Current uses.
The church is currently the home of the Wesley Congregation known as Wesley Mission Perth, a part of the Uniting Church in Australia.
Heritage value.
The Wesley Church was entered into the Register of the National Estate by the Australian Heritage Commission on 23 March 1985 and classified by the National Trust of Australia (WA) on 11 June 1973. On 23 May 1995 it was placed on the permanent State Heritage Register.

Gau Southern Hanover-Brunswick

Gau Southern Hanover–Brunswick (German: Gau Südhannover–Braunschweig) was a regional district established in 1933 in Nazi Germany. Initially the gau was a territorial component of both the Free State of Prussia and the Free State of Brunswick from 1933 to 1935. However after the German constituent states were abolished in 1935, the gaus replaced them in their responsibilities. Gau Southern Hanover-Brunswick was dismantled after Germany's defeat in 1945. The territory after the war became part of Lower Saxony in West Germany.

Torslanda Airport

Torslanda Airport — (Swedish: "Torslanda Flygplats" or "Torslanda Flygfält") served the city of Gothenburg, Sweden, as its main airport from 1923 to 1977, when the Gothenburg-Landvetter Airport was opened. The airport closed soon afterwards.
In 1969, an air traffic control tower was built on an adjacent hilltop as replacement for an older tower built in 1938.
Incidents.
The airport had been the site of a mishap on 23 December 1967 when a Douglas DC-6B operated by Sterling Airways carrying 55 passengers en route from Stockholm landed 3000 feet beyond the landing threshold. 
In a notable 1972 incident, a flight also from Torlsanda en route to Stockholm was hijacked and diverted to Bulltofta airport outside the Swedish city of Malmö. Nine Croatians imprisoned nearby were traded for 500.000 SEK before flying to Madrid, Spain, before being captured by police.
Use after the closure.
The 1969 control tower remains (as of 2010) as one of the last artifacts of the airport. Most of the old airport was demolished in 1997, when the former runway paving were mainly removed.
Until 1995, Volvo housed its collection of historic vehicles in "The "Blue Hangar" ("Den Blå Hangaren"). Now they are located in the Volvo Museum, a few kilometres away.
In recent years, the original land from the Torslanda Airport has quickly redeveloped into a residential area known as Amhult, eventually to become a garden village with 900 new homes, a commercial centre, preschool and school.
The former runways have partially been used for car testing by Volvo, for driver training and race car testing, and for model aircraft, until the runways were removed.
An area is still used for storing ship containers. A golf course has been built over parts of the former runways. The road no 155 to Öckerö went a detour around the north-south runways. Around 1997 the road was rebuilt to go straight across the former runway.
Amhult.
The name Amhult was popularised by William Edelman in 2001, when he was requested to build a futuristic population centre. The architect, Mikael Jansson, made a sketch of the centre but his sketch was never realized due to major measurement failures.
The construction headman, Frans Bergentall, claims that Mikael Janssons sketches were stolen from Simon Nestorovski, an investigation were started late in 2003, but no evidence was found. The case closed early in 2010.

Jóhannes Geir Jónsson

Jóhannes Geir Jónsson (born 24. June 1927, d. 29. June 2003) was an Icelandic painter. 
He was born and raised in Skagafjörður in northern Iceland. His father was a local schoolmaster; his much younger mother died from child labour when he was 9 years old. As a child Jóhannes demonstrated a talent for drawing and painting. When the time came, he eventually persuaded his father to allow him to pursue his artistic interests rather than the academic career pre-planned for him. 
He studied art in Reykjavík and subsequently in Copenhagen in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Although he earned high remarks from his respected tutors, he initially had trouble making a living from his art after his homecoming, working mainly as an illustrator for advertisement agencies. He had trouble "finding his own style", and became depressive, which proved to be a blessing in disguise: Rather than painting the "classic" landscapes deriative of contemporary Icelandic artists, he began painting dark images from his youth in northern Iceland, seemingly haunted by the early loss of his mother and the strict (though caring) upbringing by his widowed father. 
Around 1965 the local art community started taking more notice of this little known young artist and his "dark, depressive" paintings. Art critics heaped praise on his works; this was quintessentially Icelandic art, but under obvious influence from the works of Edvard Munch or even Goya. Over the next few years he became one of the best known, best selling, and most respected painters in Iceland.
Success also spelled the end of his "depressive era". Instead he turned his attention to painting Icelandic landscapes, but now with his unique unmistakable style - characterized with bright shining colours depicting (or amplifying) the beauty of a sometimes dull landscape. 
In the late 1970s, being an established successful artist, Jóhannes could divide some attention to one of his lifelong interests - The Viking Sagas - and incorporate them into his art. For the rest of his life, he made hundreds of illustrations based on the Sagas, ranging all the way from grand oil paintings to small pencil sketches. 
Despite his failing health, Jóhannes kept on working until his dying day. He was one of the most prolific Icelandic artists of his generation, and his works decorate the walls of many public buildings as well as private homes in Iceland.

Star Wars Pez

A Star Wars Pez is a Pez candy dispenser themed after the "Star Wars" movies, and is one of the company's most prominent merchandising deals. Twenty types have been released on the market from 1997 to 2005, among the many collectibles spawned by the franchise.
The extreme interest of popular culture in all things "Star Wars" has spawned a scholarly interest in the "materializing fantasy media" such as these PEZ dispensers. It has also led to several museums to feature such Stars Wars memorabilia in their exhibits and/or gift shops, as well as media attention on this fairly odd phenomena.
In museum exhibits and gift shops.
In recent years, several museums around the United States have featured Star Wars Pez in their exhibits and/or gift shops. These products are displayed and exhibited because they are classic Americana. Despite the dispensers' "popularity and cult status," the manufacturer's original factory in Austria does not give tours or sell fancifully-shaped memorabilia. Only in January 2012, this group of dispensers became prominently displayed at the company's new North American headquarters in Orange, Connecticut: one travelogue wrote, "The company has been making the cartoonish plastic heads for 60 years now, representing everything from Star Wars to U.S. presidents to the Geico chameleon."
The Clayton Historical Museum, in Clayton, California opened a new exhibit on the history of candy manufacture in January 2012 that featured these confectionary dispensers.
Pez with "Star Wars" characters have been featured prominently in the Star Wars Museum in Maryland. The "Star Wars" Pez dispensers are pictured on a fan website, which describes them as "some Candy Heads from 1980".
The Pacific Science Center sold Pez at a popular exhibit about "Star Wars".
These branded dispensers are among the "top sellers" at the gift shop at the Burlingame Museum of PEZ Memorabilia, outside San Francisco. This museum also displays "a whole lot of "Star Wars" Pez," in Plexiglas displays. This "unofficial shrine" to the collectibles is unaffiliated with Pez Candy, Inc., and the manufacturer sued the Burlingam museum in 2009 for copyright infringement. There was a notorious, giant Pez sculpture of C-3PO and Chewbacca locked in a slash fiction kiss. As of early 2012, this museum remains open. The sales manager at a major San Francisco hotel recommends that tourists visit the museum, noting "you have to check out the Star Wars section."
Another Pez museum in Easton, Pennsylvania also has featured prominently their obligatory "Star Wars" memorabilia, ("Of course, we had to include the Star Wars Pez Dispensers"), including an oversize Darth Vader figurine. As of early 2012, this museum appears to have closed to the public.
Other influences.
Carrie Fisher's "Princess Leia Pez dispenser" is one of the noted "merchandising horrors" that "clearly left a mark -- a scar really" on the actress.
These candy dispensers are featured prominently in the 2010 Emmy Award-winning fan film, "Star Wars Uncut".
"Star Wars" Pez has a gateway drug-like effect for some young collectors. One fan of Pez dispensers started her huge hoarde with "Star Wars" figurines at the age of three. Another fan calls Pez dispensers generally "a 'gateway drug' to hardcore collecting". "Pezheads" shopping for new dispensers frequently place "Star Wars" first on their shopping lists.

Four Pez were released in 1999 "in advance of the May 19 premier of """:

Bulltofta Airport

Bulltofta Airport was, from 1923 to 1972, the main airport serving the city of Malmö, Sweden, until it was replaced by Sturup Airport. The former airport area, in the district of Kirseberg, has been converted into, in part, a major park, in part a commercial area. 
The route Malmö-Copenhagen, started in 1924, was the world's shortest. During the 1930s Bulltofta came to be an important European airport, with connections to England, France and the Netherlands. However, the runways were not paved until 1952.
During World War II, the airfield served as the base for the F 10 fighter wing, whose main task was to intercept German and Allied aircraft violating Swedish airspace. Because of the close distance between Malmö and the German coast, Sweden's declared neutrality, and an agreement between the American Bomber Command and the Swedish government, many heavily damaged Allied bomber aircraft came to land at Bulltofta (instead of trying to make the longer trip back to their own airfields in England); these forced landings occurred mostly during the Spring and Summer of 1944.

Antonio Cortis

Antonio Cortis (12 August 1891 — 2 April 1952) was a Spanish tenor with an outstanding voice. He was acclaimed by audiences on both sides of the Atlantic for his exciting performances of Italian operatic works, especially those by Giuseppe Verdi, Giacomo Puccini and the verismo composers.
Career.
Cortis was born at sea but his birthplace is often given as Valencia, in which city he spent his infancy. (His name was originally Antonio Monton Corts but he changed it for theatrical purposes.) He studied music at the Royal Conservatory in Madrid and sang in a children's choir. In 1909, he and his widowed mother moved from Madrid to Barcelona, where he attended the local conservatory.
He made his stage debut in 1912 at the Liceo in Barcelona as a comprimario singer, but he gradually worked his way up to major roles at a variety of opera houses in Spain and South America, including the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires. On the South American tour of 1917, the young tenor was befriended by the Metropolitan Opera star Enrico Caruso, who encouraged him to pursue his singing career in New York City. Cortis declined Caruso's offer of help due to personal reasons but he would henceforth model his singing technique on Caruso's great example.
His international career began in earnest with successful appearances in Naples and, more importantly, at Rome's Teatro Costanzi in 1920, where he signed a three-year contract. He proceeded to sing in Stockholm, Milan, Latin America and Berlin and, most famously, with the esteemed company at the Chicago Civic Opera from 1924 to 1932. His debut at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, occurred in 1931, as Calaf in Puccini's "Turandot". He appeared often on the Italian opera-house circuit during the early 1930s but success at Milan's La Scala, with its entrenched roster of popular Italian-born tenors, eluded him.
Cortis came to be regarded as one of the best inter-war interpreters of verismo opera. He was particularly praised for his performances of Calaf and of Dick Johnson in Puccini's "La fanciulla del West", while he sang with remarkable ease the strenuous music composed for the tenor voice by Umberto Giordano and Pietro Mascagni. Cortis also undertook Verdi roles, such as the Duke in "Rigoletto", which he delivered with impressive skill and style.
He chose to spend the final phase of his career in Spain as the Great Depression deeply affected the economies of America and other parts of the world. Although his voice was still in good condition, he withdrew from the operatic stage in the mid-1930s. His decision to retire was influenced by the onset of the Spanish Civil War. He composed some vocal works during this period and founded a school for singers in Valencia in 1940. After World War II, he came out of retirement to appear occasionally in Spanish operas and other works. His health deteriorated in the early 1950s and he died at the age of 60 in Valencia.
Recordings and assessment.
Cortis made a number of top-quality recordings of operatic arias and songs in 1925-1930, mainly for HMV but also for the Victor label. They consist of pieces by Gounod, Meyerbeer, Massenet, Donizetti, Verdi, Puccini, Giordano and Mascagni, and by Spanish composers such as Gaztambide, Vives and Serrano. (These recordings are now available on CD reissues, most notably those produced by the Pearl and Preiser companies.)
For a public performer, Cortis possessed a comparatively reserved personality. This natural reticence may have prevented him from making the most of career opportunities when they presented themselves. Nevertheless, music critics consider his potent, dark-coloured voice to be one of the finest lyric-dramatic tenor instruments ever captured on disc. No mere 'belter', he sang with imagination and sound musicianship as well as thrilling tone.

Maginardo

Maginardo (fl. 1006–1032), called Aretino, was an Italian architect active in the Diocese of Arezzo during the episcopates of Elempert (986–1010), William (1010–1013), Adalbert (1014–1023), and Tedald (1023–1036), who called him "arte architectonica optime erudito" (Latin for "the most erudite in the architectural art"). 
Maginardo's career began in 1006–9, when he participated in the reconstruction of the eighth-century cathedral at Arezzo dedicated to Stephen the Protomartyr and the Virgin Mary. Maginardo's second great project was the addition of a chapel dedicated to Saint Donatus to the side of the cathedral. This building was finished in 1032 and dedicated on 12 November 1032. 
In 1019 or 1026 Maginardo was sent to Ravenna by his bishop (probably Tedald) to study the Byzantine architecture of its monuments. He probably produced sketches of these monuments, but if so they do not survive. The result of his studies was a confluence of pre-romanesque styles: Aretine, Byzantine, and Lombard. This resulted in Maginardo's greatest work: the renovation of the old cathedral on the Pionta, a hill at the centre of Arezzo. This work lies in ruins today, since Cosimo I de' Medici ordered its destruction during his sack of 1561.

Praha Masarykovo nádraží

Praha Masarykovo nádraží (Prague Masaryk railway station) is a terminal railway station located in the New Town area of Prague, near Republic Square (Náměstí Republiky). 
It was the first railway station in the city to serve steam trains, and the second oldest railway station in Prague, Czech Republic (the first is Praha-Dejvice, formerly Bruska on the Lány Horse-drawn Railway). The station was designed by Antonín Jüngling and came into service in 1845.
Nowadays the station only serves regional and suburban trains, due to the larger Praha hlavní nádraží not having enough capacity. In 2010 it served 48,838 trains and 9.6 million passengers. The station is currently being reconstructed, and will become the terminus of the planned railway connection with Ruzyně International Airport.
Names.
Since it opened in 1845, Masaryk Railway Station has had the following names:
For much of its existence, the station has been named after the founder of Czechoslovakia, Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk.

Porkchop Cash

Bobby Cash (born October 22, 1947) is a semi-retired American professional wrestler. He competed primarily in promotions operated by the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). He also had shorter stints in the Continental Wrestling Association and Georgia Championship Wrestling.
1970s.
NWA Hollywood Wrestling.
Cash made his wrestling debut in 1973, competing for the National Wrestling Alliance affiliated Championship Wrestling from Florida. He wrestled both as a singles competitor and in tag team matches with partner Frank Hester. The following year, he began wrestling for Los Angeles, California-based territory known as NWA Hollywood Wrestling. He soon won the NWA Americas Heavyweight Championship by defeating John Tolos on March 22, 1974. After holding the belt for over two months, he dropped it to Black Gordman. In a rematch two weeks later, Cash regained the belt. Less than a month later, Ernie Ladd beat Cash to win the championship.
After losing the title, Cash formed a tag team with Manny Soto. Together, they defeated Black Gordman and Goliath to win the NWA Americas Tag Team Championship on July 24. The following month, Cash and Soto dropped the belts to the team of Angel Blanco and Dr. Wagner. Cash was involved in a feud with Butcher Brannigan, and he teamed with Victor Rivera to regain the NWA Americas Tag Team Championship on September 14 by defeating Brannigan and Man Mountain Mike. They held the belts until a loss to Otto Von Heller and Kurt Von Hess October 12. The following year, Cash teamed with S.D. Jones to win the belts for a third time. They won the belts from Jerry Brown and Buddy Roberts, collectively known as the Hollywood Blonds, but dropped the belts back to the Blonds the following month. Cash's final reign came in 1976, when he and Frank Monte defeated the team of Roddy Piper and Crusher Verdu for the belts. The reign was brief, however, as Cash and Monte soon dropped the belts to The Scorpions.
Southeastern United States.
In 1976, Cash left California to compete in the Southeastern United States. Cash's first stop was Georgia, where he wrestled for Georgia Championship Wrestling. While there, he won the NWA Georgia Tag Team Championship by teaming with Tom Jones to defeat Jimmy and Johnny Valiant. The following month, Cash and Jones lost the title to Gene and Ole Anderson. Cash also wrestled for Tennessee-based NWA Mid-America. He teamed with Gorgeous George, Jr. to win the Mid-America version of the NWA Southern Tag Team Championship in February 1977.
In Louisiana, Cash became a two-time holder of the Tri-State version of the NWA United States Tag Team Championship. His first reign was with Mike George, as the team defeated The Medics (Billy Garrett and Jim Starr) on August 16, 1977. They held the belts for only a week, however, as they lost them in a rematch. Cash regained the belts in August 1977 from The Medics, this time with Dr. X as his partner. The team split up in September, however, and Cash and Dr. X faced each other for control of the title. Cash took Ray Candy as his partner, and Dr. X teamed with Ciclón Negro. Negro and Dr. X won the match, bringing Cash's title reign to an end.
1980s.
NWA Tri-State.
Cash returned to Louisiana in 1981, although NWA Tri-State had been purchased by new owners. Cash regained the tag team title, which had since been renamed the NWA Tri-State Tag Team Championship, by teaming with Doug Somers to defeat Eric Embry and Chief Frank Hill. Once again, Cash's title reign ended because of a split from his partner, as Cash and Somers went their separate ways later that year.
The following year saw Cash join Jim Crockett, Jr.'s Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling. Once again, he enjoyed success as a tag team competitor. Joining up with Jay Youngblood, he won the NWA Mid-Atlantic Tag Team Championship in March 1982. After dropping the belts to Don Kernodle and Pvt. Jim Nelson, Cash formed a team with Iceman King Parsons to regain the title. In August, however, Cash once again lost the championship to Kernodle and Nelson.
Continental Wrestling Association.
After leaving the Mid-Atlantic territory, Porkchop Cash then joined Jerry Jarrett's Continental Wrestling Association based in Memphis, Tennessee. Cash soon formed a tag team with Troy Graham (who wrestled as "Dream Machine") known as The Bruise Brothers. Wrestling as heels, they held the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship twice. The Bruise Brothers were in the First Family stable of Jimmy Hart. Their main rivals were The Sheepherders, as tag team from New Zealand. They beat Dutch Mantel and Koko B. Ware for their first title on October 3, 1983. They also had a series matches with The Rock 'n' Roll Express, trading the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship with them. A notable moment in the feud came after their match on November 7, 1983. Cash and Graham lost the match and the belts and responded by attacking the referee, Paul Morton (father of Ricky Morton of The Rock 'n' Roll Express). The Bruise Brothers avenged their loss one week later by regaining the championship. On November 29, 1983, The Bruise Brothers dropped the belts to The Fabulous Ones. Tension built within Hart's stable, and The Bruise Brothers faced stablemates The Grapplers (Len Denton and Tony Anthony) in a "losers no longer managed by Jimmy Hart" match on December 26. The Grapplers won, leaving Cash and Graham without a manager. Shortly thereafter, Cash replaced Graham with Maddog Boyd. Cash and Boyd initiated a feud with Eddie Gilbert by stealing a portrait of Gilbert that he had been showing off every week and offering to award to the winner of a draw.
Southeastern Championship Wrestling.
Cash next moved to Ron Fuller's Southeastern Championship Wrestling, which operated throughout Alabama and the eastern half of Tennessee. He won his first singles title since 1974 when he defeated Boris Zhukov for the NWA Alabama Heavyweight Championship in September 1984. He held the title for two months before dropping it to Lord Humongous (portrayed by Jeff Van Kamp). He also won the NWA Southeastern Heavyweight Championship with a victory over Jimmy Golden in January 1985. Two months later, he lost the belt to Boomer Lynch.
Central States Wrestling.
After leaving Fuller's territory, Cash appeared next in Central States Wrestling in early 1987. He formed a team with Ken Timbs and challenged champions Rick McCord and Bart Batten for the NWA Central States Tag Team Championship. Cash and Timbs appeared to win the title on April 3, 1987, but the title was declared vacant because Cash used a foreign object to get the victory. In a rematch on April 10, Cash and Timbs defeated McCord and Batten again to win the championship officially. Timbs eventually left the promotion, and the titles were vacated once again.
Cash also briefly held the NWA Central States Heavyweight Championship after defeating Rufus R. Jones, but he lost the belt in a rematch one week later. He then returned to tag team competition, joining up with Ric McCord to win the NWA Central States Tag Team Championship once again. They defeated the Batten Twins (Brad and Bart) for the belts on November 9, 1987 but lost the title to the Montana Cowboys (Mike Stone and Rick Patterson) on November 26. While working for NWA Central States, Cash also worked as a manager, calling himself "The Boss" Porkchop Cash while assisting wrestlers Russell Sapp and "Krusher" Karl Kovac.
Universal Championship Wrestling.
Not long after his stint in the Central States area, Cash remained close to the area working for Bert Prentice's Universal Championship Wrestling out of Wichita, KS. He would enter the territory to begin a feud with his former Central States tag-team partner Ric McCord over McCord's recently won North American Heavyweight title. Porkchop would also feud with Rufus R. Jones and his nephew Boogaloo Jones, sometimes teaming up with fellow heel, and Dusty Rhodes lookalike Randy Rhodes. Porkchop would win the North American Championship from Ric McCord in November 1990, later losing it back to McCord a few weeks later.
Semi-retirement.
Several years later, Porkchop Cash came out of retirement to do a special three-way tag match with the Rock and Roll Express and the Midnight Express. His tag team partner was former rival Koko B. Ware, and the pair formed the PYT Express.
On January 21, 2005, Cash defeated The Psycho to win the NWA Mississippi Cruiserwight Championship. He held the belt for over a year before dropping it to Brother Love (not to be confused with the character portrayed by World Wrestling Entertainment's Bruce Prichard). Porkchop Cash is now semi-retired but still wrestles on occasional independent shows.
Legacy.
Floyd Womack of the National Football League's Seattle Seahawks received the nickname "Pork Chop Womack" from his mother because she thought that her son looked like Porkchop Cash.

Ali Michael

Alexandra Nicole Michael (born May 15, 1990, in Colleyville, Texas), known professionally as Ali Michael, is an American fashion model. She has attracted international attention as a fashion model for her unusually low weight.
Early life.
Ali Michael grew up in Colleyville, Texas, and attended Grapevine High School, until she withdrew with a semester left to focus on her modeling career. Her career began after winning the Fashion!Dallas/Kim Dawson Model Search contest in 2005 at age 15.
Career.
In 2006, Michael signed with DNA Models and appeared in an Italian Elle (magazine) editorial. In February 2007, she made her runway debut on the fall New York runway, where she opened for 3.1 Phillip Lim and Alice Roi. She walked the fall Marc by Marc Jacobs show in London, as well as the fall Lanvin show in Paris in March. Throughout the rest of 2007, she made appearances in magazines such as W (magazine), French Revue de Modes, Harper's Bazaar, and Teen Vogue. In October, she walked the runway in Paris for Chanel, Christian Dior, Karl Lagerfeld, and Lanvin (clothing). 
In February 2008, she was sent home from Paris fashion week after being told that "her legs were too plump". Michael had gained five pounds after struggling with an eating disorder that caused her to weigh 106 lbs at 5'9". She was then the center of the article "Wasn't Skinny Supposed to Be Out of Fashion?" in "The Wall Street Journal" on February 28, 2008. 
In May 2008, she appeared on the "Today Show" and talked about the pressure to be thin as a model, and the alarming increase over the years to be skinnier. She stated that she "hadn't had period in over a year" and had a wake-up call when, on a plane, she "ran [her fingers through hair, and when [she took hand away there was a dry brittle clump of hair in [her hand". Michael began to see a Nutritionist to deal with her weight and eating issues, including Bulimia nervosa. "I've had a lot of girls come up to me in the mall to say 'Thank you,' and that makes me feel good," Michael said in the February 2009 issue of Teen Vogue in regards to her interview on the Today Show about her weight loss. She also said that she was not alone in her weight struggles, and that many other young (and old) models starve themselves.
After her early departure from Paris after just one show, she returned strong in September 2008 for spring Fashion Weeks in London, Milan and Paris. She graced the catwalks of Lacoste, ADAM, Matthew Williamson, Marc Jacobs, Max Azria, 3.1 Phillip Lim, Doo.Ri, Paul Smith, Luella, Louise Goldin, Aquascutum, House of Holland, Burberry Prorsum, Iceberg, Fendi, Bruno Pieters, Christian Dior, Balenciaga, Sonia Rykiel, Karl Lagerfeld, Akris, Celine and John Galliano. In addition to her strong comeback, Ali continued her contract with SportMax and began a new fragrance contract with Lanvin's Jeanne Lanvin. She also became the face of the new Anna Sui's campaign, Lord and Taylor, Gianfranco Ferre, and Coach, Inc..
In February 2009, she skipped Fashion Week in New York, London, Milan, and Paris, but returned in September for spring Fashion Weeks in New York, London, and Paris, walking for 3.1 Phillip Lim, Burberry, Sonia Rykiel, Emanuel Ungaro, and Yohji Yamamoto. 
In 2010 she was photographed for the spring issue of Lula Magazine, and appeared in an Italian Elle editorial.
In 2012, Michael appeared in an Elle editorial, photographed by Bruno Staub.
Personal life.
Michael lives in New York and enjoys riding horses and listening to the bands Radiohead and Modest Mouse.
She is now with IMG Models www.imgmodels.com

Denying History

Denying History: Who Says the Holocaust Never Happened and Why Do They Say It? is a 2002 book by Michael Shermer and Alex Grobman about Holocaust denial.
Reviews.
Publishers Weekly gave the book a positive review explaining, "Keeping their focus on larger questions about historical rigor and public memory, Shermer (a professor of the history of science at Occidental College and publisher of Skeptic magazine) and Grobman ("Rekindling the Flame") look closely at the methods employed by deniers and those used by legitimate historians. "Holocaust denial," they argue, "is not just a Jewish issue. It is an attack on all history and the way we transmit the past to the future." Drawing on a wide array of evidence and interviews they conducted with famous deniers (including David Irving) and text from their Web sites and literature, the authors explore the difference between legitimate historical revisionism and pseudohistorical denial."
Additionally, CNN wrote ". . . Shermer and Grobman do more than just refute ridiculous allegations. They also use the example of Holocaust denial literature to examine free speech issues, the psychology of right-wing extremists, and the role of biases in historical research." They further "reveal that Holocaust Denial is not skepticism, and that the revisionists are not being genuinely skeptical. Honest skepticism involves an inquisitive attitude which, as far as is humanly possible, is not marred by political or ethnic prejudices. Skepticism also involves a willingness to follow the evidence wherever it leads, rather than ignoring that which does not fit preconceived desires."

Holder Peak

Holder Peak () is the higher (northern) peak on a rock outcrop on the Ingrid Christensen Coast of Princess Elizabeth Land, Antarctica, about east of Mount Caroline Mikkelsen. It is about high.
The peak was plotted by Norwegian cartographers from air photographs taken by the Lars Christensen Expedition (1936–37) and with Young Peak called "Tvillingfjel" (Twin Mountains). It was fixed by triangulation from an astrofixed baseline by an Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions (ANARE) party from Davis Station led by Australian William (Bill) Young in 1963. It was named by the Antarctic Names Committee of Australia after Australian James Holder, a weather observer at Davis Station in 1963, and a member of the ANARE field party.

Higher Education Quality Council of Ontario

The Higher Education Quality Council of Ontario (HEQCO) is an independent advisory agency funded by the Ontario Ministry of Training, Colleges, and Universities (TCU) to provide recommendations for improving quality, accessibility, inter-institutional transfer, system planning, and effectiveness in higher education in Ontario. In 2005, the provincial government established the Council through the Higher Education Quality Council of Ontario Act and appointed Frank Iacobucci as its Chair.
Background.
In 2005, Bob Rae released a comprehensive review of postsecondary education entitled "Ontario: A leader in learning" or more commonly known as the Rae Report or Rae Review. The report included a recommendation to change the structure of higher education in Ontario by adding an independent and objective "Council on Higher Education" to monitor the dynamic changes of post-secondary institutions in order to provide advice to government on the overall system. The provincial government acted on this recommendation and created an independent advisory agency to provide assessment and advice to improve higher education in Ontario. In 2005, the provincial government established the Council through the Higher Education Quality Council of Ontario Act as part of the provincial government's "Reaching Higher" six-year plan for higher education. In January 2007, the Council announced the appointment of James Downey as its first president. During its first year of operation ending in March 2007, the Ministry of Training, Colleges, and Universities approved a budget of $1.1 million for operations and $700,000 for purchasing initial assets. The Council's 2011 operating budget is $5 million. Dr. Harvey P. Weingarten became President and CEO of the Higher Education Quality Council of Ontario on July 1, 2010. 
Research.
The Higher Education Quality Council of Ontario employs a multifaceted research approach with a view to developing meaningful policy recommendations and publishing reports and other publications that inform the postsecondary education community in Ontario, Canada and around the world. To date, more than 100 research papers and reports have been produced, with approximately 40 additional papers in development. The Council's research publications are available on their website at www.heqco.ca under the "Research" heading.
Hosted events.
The Council regularly hosts workshops, conferences and other events to advance its broad research agenda. These events offer researchers from across the sector valuable opportunities to share knowledge, develop new approaches and support the ongoing improvement of Ontario’s postsecondary education system. HEQCO has organized 13 events to date, with more planned in the coming year. Information on upcoming HEQCO events can be found at www.heqco.ca in the "Events" section.

The Great Moment (1944 film)

The Great Moment is a 1944 biographical film written and directed by Preston Sturges. Based on the book "Triumph Over Pain" (1940) by René Fülöp-Miller, it tells the story of Dr. William Thomas Green Morton, a 19th-century Boston dentist who discovered the use of ether for general anesthesia. The film stars Joel McCrea and Betty Field, and features Harry Carey, William Demarest, Franklin Pangborn and Porter Hall.
The movie was filmed in 1942 but not released for over two years, and the released version differed from what Preston Sturges had wished, although he publicly accepted the film as his own. Paramount Pictures disliked the film Sturges had made, and pulled it from his control, re-titled and re-edited it, in the process making it (especially in the early segment) more confusing for the audience to understand. The studio's released version was marketed in a way that made it appear to be one of Sturges' comedies. The film was not well received by the critics or the public, and marked the end of a sustained run of success for Sturges, who had already left Paramount by the time the film was released.
Although rarely seen today, the film is worth viewing for its flashback structure – comparable in some ways to "Citizen Kane", which was influenced by the earlier film "The Power and the Glory", for which Sturges wrote the screenplay – and for its irreverent and subtly satirical tone, unusual for a time when most Hollywood biopics were over-inflated and sentimental. In 2003 a medical-dental historian in a lengthy analysis of the movie and its history -- which cited its flashback structure, timeless subject, injections of humor, and "un-Pasteur-like" treatment of its protagonist, while adhering reasonably well to the historical record -- concluded that "The Great Moment may now be due for a general reevaluation by movie historians and critics who, like most folks, have never felt much affection for dentists past and present."
Plot.
The titles and credits open with a scene (in 1846) of a triumphant street procession and a jubilant crowd hailing William Morton (Joel McCrea) with signs such as "Pain is no more," followed by a long, written prologue pointing out, in part, that "before ether there was nothing."
Next, an old Eben Frost (William Demarest) is seen heading through the snow to the farmhouse of Morton's aging widow Lizzie (Betty Field). On the way he stops at a pawn shop and redeems a medal once awarded to Morton inscribed: "To the benefactor of mankind."
At the Morton home, Lizzie reminisces to Frost about her late husband and their life together, although the nature of Morton's achievement is vague.
In the brief first flashback (which takes place several years after his discovery, though this is not at all clear), Morton mortgages his farm to pay for a trip to Washington, D.C. to meet President Franklin Pierce (Porter Hall). The president declares his intention to ratify a large monetary sum awarded to Morton by a grateful Congress, but says Morton should first legitimize his claim in court by filing a patent infringement suit against some army or navy doctor. The newspapers loudly denounce Morton's greed, the court declares his discovery unpatentable, and Morton runs amok in a shop which is capitalizing on his discovery with no credit or royalties to him.
The scene shifts back to the farmhouse and the aging Lizzie, who relates the details of the broken Morton's recent death and their life together before, during, and immediately after Morton's discovery.
The second flashback, which makes up most of the story, follows Morton and Lizzie's courtship, early married years, and his tribulations as a dentist with patients who fear the pain of dental operations. Morton consults his former professor Charles T. Jackson (Julius Tannen), who cantankerously suggests cooling the gums and roots with topical application of chloric ether. Morton ignorantly purchases a bottle of sulphuric ether and passes out when it evaporates in the living room of his home.
Morton's former partner Horace Wells later comes by, telling of his discovery that nitrous oxide (laughing gas, which in those days was used at carnival attractions) could serve as an inhalable general anesthetic. He asks Morton's assistance at a planned tooth extraction at Harvard Medical School before the class of prominent surgeon John Collins Warren (Harry Carey). The demonstration fails (or appears to) when the patient cries out. Wells remains convinced of nitrous oxide's efficacy, but soon swears it off when his next patient almost fails to revive from an overdose.
Morton, thinking back to his passing out from inadvertently inhaling sulphuric ether vapor, wonders whether this instead could serve as an inhalable general anesthetic. He tries the gas on patient Frost, who goes berserk. Morton consults Jackson, who explains that the ether must be of the highly rectified type. The next trial with Frost succeeds. Morton, who is camouflaging the smell of the sulphuric ether and calling it "Letheon," is soon raking in a fortune with his painless dentistry. However, Jackson and Wells now accuse Morton of having stolen their respective ideas.
Morton begins thinking about the possible use of his "Letheon" in general surgery. He approaches surgeon Warren, who is highly skeptical but agrees to a demonstration at Massachusetts General Hospital. The operation (on October 16, 1846), the excising of a neck tumor before doctors and students in the operating theater, proceeds painlessly. Warren now schedules a public demonstration for a more serious operation -- a leg amputation.
On the scheduled day, representatives of the state Medical Society, jealous of the success of this upstart dentist, demand that, in accordance with established medical ethics, Morton first reveal the chemical composition of his "Letheon." Morton refuses to do so until his pending patent is granted, but says that in the meantime he will let all hospitals and charitable institutions (though not his rival dentists) use his compound free of charge. The Medical Society's men declare this unacceptable, so surgeon Warren says he has no alternative but to perform the scheduled amputation without anesthesia.
As the bewildered Morton wanders through the hospital corridors, he comes across the girl whose leg is to amputated, being prayed over by a priest. Taking pity on her, he marches into the operating theater to reveal his secret to surgeon Warren -- and to the world.
Cast.
Cast notes:
Production.
The saga of "The Great Moment" – which during various stages of its development was called "Immortal Secret," "Great Without Glory," "Morton the Magnificent" and "Triumph Over Pain" – begins in 1939, with a screenplay for Paramount Pictures about the life of W.T.G. Morton, written by Preston Sturges, Irwin Shaw, Les River, Charles Brackett and Waldo Twitchell. The film was to be directed by Henry Hathaway, produced by Arthur Hornblow Jr. and William LeBaron, with Gary Cooper and Walter Brennan to star as Morton and Eben Frost. 
When Cooper left Paramount, production was delayed, although there may have been other reasons as well. It's unlikely that any footage was actually shot at that time, but Paramount did go so far as to check with historians and dental organizations to confirm the screenplay's depiction of Morton, finding that opinion was divided on his character and on his claim to have discovered the first practical anesthesia. In fact, when Rene Fulop-Miller's book "Triumph over Pain" was published in 1940, it caused a storm of controversy, as many disputed its claims regarding Morton. It is now recognized that Dr. Crawford Long's use of ether predated Dr. Morton's use, although Morton is credited for widely publicizing the technique.
Paramount executives were losing interest in the project, but Sturges had become entralled by it, seeing an opportunity to combine the themes of sacrifice, triumph and tragedy with elements of madcap, satire and the fickleness of fate and luck. Sturges' commercial and critical success was such that the studio executives, though sceptical of the Morton movie, were willing to indulge him and let him direct it if at the same time he would keep turning out the kind of films which were proven hits.
Paramount bought the rights to an MGM short film "Life of William Morton, Discoverer of Anesthesia", which is not credited in the released film as a source. Sturges then revised the 1939 screenplay with Ernst Laemmle, whose work was uncredited. At that time, Walter Huston was being considered to play the lead.
The film went into production on 8 April 1942 and wrapped on 5 June, on budget and a day under schedule. (In the sequence of Sturges' films, that's after the filming of "The Palm Beach Story" but before its release, and before both "The Miracle of Morgan's Creek" and "Hail the Conquering Hero" began shooting.) Joel McCrea, who had just starred in "The Palm Beach Story" played Morton – McCrea told Sturges that he only got good roles when Gary Cooper wasn't available – and William Demarest, that stalwart of Sturges' "stock company" played Eben Frost, giving a "gem of a performance" in one of his "strongest and most important roles".
Sturges explained his unusual choice of having his two flashbacks in reverse chronological order (the first flashback telling, however briefly, of episodes in Morton's life post-discovery and post-sacrifice, then the second, much longer flashback telling of his life up to and including his discovery and sacrifice) as follows: "Unfortunately, I was not around in 1846 to direct Dr. Morton's life. [...] Since director-biographer with integrity cannot change the chronology of events, he can only change the order of their presentation. Dr. Morton's life, as lived, was a very bad piece of dramatic construction. He had a few months of exictement ending in triumph and twenty years of disillusionment, boredom, and increasing bitterness."
Sturges' edits.
In the process of adapting and shooting the script, Sturges himself made a few interesting changes. An earlier version had young student Morton and his fiancée Lizzie engaging in ether frolics at a party (not uncommon in that era, though Fülöp-Miller's book does not say that Morton himself ever did so). Sturges decided it would be more appropriate to have Morton introduced cold to ether as a dentist.
More significant was the change Sturges decided to make at the very end. In a previous script, as Morton enters the operating theater to reveal the secret of his anesthetic to Dr. Warren and the world, there was to be dialogue between them (hesitation ellipses in original):
Morton: "Professor Warren, it's called ... sulphuric ether ... highly rectified."
Prof. Warren: (Stupified) "You mean plain C2H5OC2H5?"
Morton: (He lifts his arms helplessly) "I don't know ... I guess so."
Warren: (Seizing his hands) "Oh, my boy ... my boy."
Sturges decided to eliminate this dialogue, since although it made a point which Sturges indeed wished to make, it did it too well.
The Morton story particularly intrigued Sturges because it contrasted with recent highly successful medical biopics by Warner Bros.: "The Story of Louis Pasteur" (1936) and "Dr. Ehrlich's Magic Bullet" (1940). Sturges wished to eschew (in his words) the "traditional smugness" of the "hand-in-the-bosom-prematurely-turned-to-marble form of biography," the "Pasteur manner, where every character knows his place in History."
Morton as presented is an un-Pasteur. He has no delusions of scientific genius or pre-determined destiny. Not only is Morton's great discovery aided by serendipity (as can often happen in the lives of geniuses, too); it is abetted in large measure by his scientific ignorance, an ignorance which also afforded Sturges the chance to inject some madcap humor (as when Morton's first test patient goes berserk). However, Sturges decided simply to eliminate the original dialogue with Prof. Warren when Morton marches (to the sound of trumpets) into the operating theater, since by emphasizing yet again Morton's scientific limitations this would detract from the power of the climactic sacrifice he was making.
Studio edits.
Paramount did not immediately release the film, because they disliked the non-sequential arrangement of the scenes, the tone of some of the acting, and the prologue.
The film was taken away from Sturges by executive producer Buddy G. DeSylva, who never quite trusted him and resented the control Sturges had over his projects, and found the Morton story unsuitable for mainstream audiences.
Sturges had shot the prologue as a voice-over to open the film:
One of the most charming characteristics of Homo sapiens, the wise guy on your right, is the consistency with which he has stoned, crucified, hanged, flayed, boiled in oil and otherwise rid himself of those who consecrated their lives to further his comfort and well-being, so that all his strength and cunning might be preserved for the erection of ever larger monuments, memorial shafts, triumphal arches, pyramids and obelisks to the eternal glory of generals on horseback, tyrants, usurpers, dictators, politicians, and other heroes who led him, from the rear, to dismemberment and death. This is the story of the Boston dentist who gave you ether-before whom in all time surgery was agony, since whom science has control of pain. It should be almost unnecessary then to tell you that this man, whose contribution to human mercy is unparalleled in the history of the world, was ridiculed, reviled, burned in effigy and eventually driven to despair and death by the beneficiaries of his revelation. Paramount Pictures, Incorporated, has the honor of bringing you, at long last, the true story of an American of supreme achievement – W.T.G. Morton of Boston, Massachusetts, in a motion picture called "Triumph Over Pain".
This prologue was deemed by the studio to be inopportune during World War Two. The film as released now opens with this prologue, in titles rather than voice-over, written by Sturges when it was clear that no satisfactory revision to the original prologue was feasible:It does not seem to be generally understood that before ether there was nothing. The patient was strapped down...that is all. This is the story of W. T. G. Morton of Boston, Mass., before whom in all time surgery was agony, since whom science has control of pain. Of all things in nature great men alone reverse the laws of perspective and grow smaller as one approaches them. Dwarfed by the magnitude of his revelation, reviled, hated by his fellow men, forgotten before he was remembered, Morton seems very small indeed until the incandescent moment he ruined himself for a servant girl and gained immortality.
The film was heavily re-cut, to the point that some of the narrative became almost incomprehensible.
Eliminated from the re-cut version was a brief sequence which preceded even the framing story with Frost and widow Lizzie. This initial sequence shifted back and forth between a scene of child in a contemporary hospital (early 1940s) being wheeled into the operating room and being assured by his parents that the operation will not hurt and a scene of a broken and impoverished Morton in the previous century pawning his medals.
The first flashback sequence was cut particularly heavily by the studio, since it was not only chronologically "subsequent" to the second flashback, but also was almost totally devoid of humor. The most significant segment eliminated from the first flashback was Morton's confession to Lizzie on the evening after his sacrifice, which would have appeared very early in the sequence. It reads in part (hesitation ellipses in original):
Morton: "oday at the hospital ... the Medical Society wouldn't let them use the Letheon ... unless they knew what it was so ... they asked me what it was."
Mrs Morton: (Staccato and smiling, on the verge of hysteria) "But you didn't just tell them ..." (She twists her hands) "... I mean you weren't such a fool as to tell them the most valuable secret in the world, JUST FOR THE ASKING?"
Morton: (Miserably) "But Lizzie they were going to take her leg off without it ... without anything!" (He seems on the verge of hysteria himself) "They were just going to strap her down and hack it off!"
Mrs. Morton: (Vehemently) "Whose leg?"
Morton: (With a trace of exasperation) "I don't know ... some servant girl!"
The studio was concerned that revealing the nature of Morton's sacrifice so early in the movie would lessen the dramatic impact of that sacrifice at the climax. The downside of the elimination of this scene was, however, that the audience was all the less aware of how the remaining events in the first flashback sequence, especially as further whittled down by the studio, related to the story. (The reference in the prologue to Morton's having "ruined himself for a servant girl" is left hanging and would seem to point to, if anything, some illicit affair.)
The second flashback (which forms the great majority of the film) was left comparably intact, for it was the traditional linear narrative with which the Hollywood film industry was most comfortable. Particularly, the humorous and slapstick episodes, which Paramount felt that audiences expected from a Sturges film, were preserved -- so much so that Sturges suspected the film was being "cut for comedy." The title was changed over Sturges' strong objections -- unclear is whether the "great moment" refers to the first ether operation or Morton's sacrifice at the climax. (Because of the re-editing, the film is listed with various runtimes of 80, 83, 87, and 90 minutes, and some of the actors listed in official cast lists may not actually appear in the film.) At some point in this process, Sturges' contract with Paramount ran out, and he left the studio (although he came back to do some unpaid re-shooting and re-editing of "Hail the Conquering Hero") Sturges later wrote about his departure "I guess Paramount was glad to be rid of me eventually, as no one there ever understood a word I said."
"The Great Moment" premiered in Los Angeles on 24 August 1944, more than two years after filming had wrapped, and went into general release on 6 September of that year. The film was not well-received, either by the critics or at the box office, becoming the only film directed by Sturges for Paramount not to turn a profit. Sturges' reputation never quite recovered from its failure, and his post-Paramount career is the record of a sad decline.
"The Great Moment" was released on video in the U.S. on 11 November 1990 and re-released on 30 June 1993. It was released on Laserdisc on 26 October 1994.

Frank Cepollina

Frank J. "Cepi" Cepollina was born in 1936 in Castro Valley, California is an American engineer and inventor. He was officially inducted to the National Inventors Hall of Fame for his pioneering concept of in-orbit satellite servicing in May 2003. His organizational leadership style has been compared to that of Al Davis of the National Football League's Oakland Raiders.
Life and education.
A Northern California native, Cepollina attended the University of Santa Clara and earned a B.S. in mechanical engineering in 1959. Before joining NASA in 1963, he worked for four years for the Aerojet General Corporation and the Defense Intelligence Agency. When he was 27 years old, he signed on with NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center where he helped developing several spacecraft. He also led the development of the Explorer Platform, which enabled the exchange of scientific payloads in orbit. 
Since his early career, he specialized in designing satellites and spacecraft, and looked for engineering solutions that would make satellites more robust. The problems he dealt with were the difficulties spacecraft industry was facing in the late 1960s. His list of accomplishments includes innovative techniques for servicing satellites, designing new tools and interfaces for astronauts, and leading the historic 1993 repair mission for the Hubble Space Telescope.
Cepollina is a researcher even in his everyday life; it is noted that when he is not busy looking for ways to improve Hubble's eye on the universe, he can be found at home tinkering with model O gauge railroads. "I've found great satisfaction in this hobby for more than 40 years," he says. "And it's a nice escape from the daily grind. "
Cepollina is currently the manager of NASA's Hubble Space Telescope Development Project at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. He and his wife, Ann raised their 4 children in Annandale, Virginia. Cepollina has eight grandchildren (one deceased) located in the Northern Virginia area, as well as on the West Coast.
Cepollina as an inventor.
It is important to note the dissatisfaction and the problems in the early days of space exploration in order to understand better the improvements made by Cepollina. The amount of engineering and effort required to do work in space were surprising for the engineers in the early days of the manned space program. For instance, the astronauts Eugene Cernan and Thomas Stafford who were launched into space aboard Gemini 9 on June 3, 1966 had to deal with unimagined difficulties as soon as Cernan began a space walk. The plan called for Cernan to take some photographs and enjoy weightlessness for a few minutes before working his way to the rear of the capsule. From the moment he emerged from the capsule, everything Cernan did was much harder than what he expected. He said his space suit felt like a suit of armor, and that every weightless movement triggered an equal, opposite reaction. He found himself repeatedly flying out to the end of the umbilical cord connecting him to the Gemini capsule and then rebounding in an unexpected direction. Medics on the ground were alarmed when his heart rate increased to 155 beats a minute. He perspired enough to fog his helmet visor, and sweat pooled in his eyes . He ripped an insulating layer in the back of his suit, and he instantly felt the fierce, bare sunshine; he returned to Earth with painful burns.
Cepollina marks that "the experiences of NASA's first space walkers pioneered a lot of the technologies we use today." First of all, these initial attempts made clear the need for a change in space-suit design. The Gemini 9 astronauts wore suits inflated to 14 pounds per square inch because that's about normal pressure on earth. NASA cut the level to 4 PSI, reducing the feeling of working inside an overinflated balloon. Furthermore, a new training was developed for moving about in space: practice sessions underwater since moving in a liquid resembles the effects of weightlessness. However, the main challenge was conquering the exhaustion that Cernan had encountered. Cepollina states that their solution was to come up with power tools they could use to limit fatigue, and in order to reduce fatigue, an engineer in Cepollina's team, Paul Richard came up with a pistol-grip device that looks like a battery-powered hand drill on steroids.
In-orbit servicing
In his article "In-Orbit Servicing", Cepollina states that in the late 1960s, as inflation and constrained budgets limited the space program, NASA determined three ways of reducing costs: standardized spacecraft components; use of the same spacecraft to do several missions; and use of the Shuttle to extend or renew the useful life of the spacecraft by replacing subsystems and instruments in the orbit. 
Why in-orbit servicing? Earth Observing System (EOS), which is a program of NASA comprising a series of artificial satellite missions and scientific instruments in Earth orbit, asked Grumman Aerospace, General Electric and TRW Systems to define the most cost effective mode for using the space shuttle. The companies identified four different methods of “renewing” the defective spacecraft:
When the costs of these four methods were compared, in-orbit servicing was found to be the lowest. 
What are the changes that comes with in-orbit servicing? On the other hand, such an approach called for a totally different spacecraft design. In this new concept, each subsystem occupied its own separate drawer or removable module in the spacecraft. For example, all the components having to do with supplying power (the power unit of the space craft) would make up one module so that if something wrong happened with the power unit, that part of the spacecraft was easily taken out and renewed.
In-orbit serviced satellites.
From his early days with NASA, Cepollina has worked on engineering solutions for satellites and spacecraft. In the late 1960s, satellite failure was becoming a significant problem, and engineers at NASA, including Cepollina, began working on a new type of Multimission Modular Craft. As described by Cepollina, these crafts would have swappable parts and could potentially be fixed easily by space-walking astronauts.
Solar Maximum Mission satellite.
The first modular craft to fly was the Solar Maximum Mission satellite, launched in 1980 to conduct astronomical observations of the sun. When it began to fail several months into orbit, Cepollina was asked to lead the repair mission, begun in 1984. The mission the first of its kind was a success; the modular craft concept proved effective. Cepollina was lauded for his leadership on the project and was subsequently named Satellite Servicing Project Manager.
Hubble Space Telescope.
After the Solar Maximum Mission Satellite, as the Satellite Servicing Project Manager, Cepollina was faced with an enormous challenge: repairing the Hubble Space Telescope. The mission he undertook has widely been cited as the most difficult on-orbit repair mission ever attempted. Having worked on the development of its modular design, as well as its command and control subsystem, Cepollina knew the Hubble well. However, few could have anticipated that the Hubble, launched in 1990 and orbiting 375 miles above the Earth, would have such a simple but crucial problem: a flawed mirror. NASA officials were appalled and embarrassed to discover that the contractor responsible had a miscalculation that made the telescope incapable of coming to a sharp focus. 
This unexpected problem was too serious to fix by simply swapping out a defective module, so Cepollina became project manager of a hurriedly assembled team charged with repairing the telescope. "The first Hubble repair mission took us to the next level of servicing", he said. His team designed new optical elements that could correct the Hubble's flawed vision yet also fit in with the modular instrument design philosophy. Cepollina's leading additional successful repair and improvement missions for Hubble followed in 1997, 1999 and 2002. These additional missions enhanced the satellite to implement technologies which were not available at the time of Hubble's initial deployment, including better cameras, more efficient solar arrays, and a more powerful processor for data transfer.
Inventions applied in other fields.
Not only has Cepollina's work benefited the advancement of space technology, but it has also led to improvements in several other industries including a much more accurate method to detect breast cancer that uses technology originally developed for Hubble's charge coupled device (CCD). Other improvements are smaller and faster microchips created with highly sophisticated Hubble-type optics, and manufacturing applications employing an intelligent, programmable, hand-held power tool.
Cepollina as a team leader.
In addition to being a successful inventor, Cepollina is also a team leader. His work with the Hubble highlights his character as a leader. He is currently the manager of NASA's Satellite Servicing Capabilities Office at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Among his numerous awards, Cepollina received the NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal for the Hubble Space Telescope First Servicing Mission.
In his presentation “The Hubble Experience”, he mentions that the success of the Hubble repair mission was due to the harmony among the partners of the project. Johnson Space Center, Kennedy Space Center, Marshall Space Flight Center, Glenn Research Facility, Langley Research Center, Jet Propulsion Laboratory of NASA all worked together and shared responsibilities in order to repair Hubble. As the team leader, Cepollina was responsible for keeping the individual groups in accord, and he managed to do so.
Awards.
In 1985, Cepollina received a NASA Exceptional Achievement Award for leading the Solar Max Repair Mission. For his outstanding leadership of the Hubble Space Telescope First Servicing Mission, which corrected Hubble's vision, he was awarded a NASA Outstanding Leadership Medal, as well as the prestigious 1994 National Space Club Eagle Manned Mission Success Award. In April 1995, he received the University of Santa Clara Distinguished Engineering Alumni Award and was inducted into Tau Beta Pi Engineering Honor Society as an Eminent Engineer. In October 1997, Mr. Cepollina was presented with the James J. Kerley Award, the top NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center Award for innovation and exceptional contributions to NASA’s technology transfer and commercialization efforts. 
In 1997, Mr. Cepollina was named a finalist for the "Design News" Engineer of the Year Award. In April 1998, he received the distinguished Federal Laboratory Consortium Award for Excellence in Technology Transfer. In February 2000, he was awarded Goddard Space Flight Center's highest honor for mission success, the Robert C. Baumann Memorial Award. In 1999, he and his team received the "Aviation Week & Space Technology" Laurels Award for Outstanding Achievement. In 2000, the President of the United States conferred upon Mr. Cepollina the rank of Meritorious Executive in Senior Executive Service for his sustained, superior accomplishments in managing NASA programs. He and the entire Hubble Space Telescope Team won the prestigious 2001 Space Foundation Space Achievement Award. In 2003, he was inducted to the National Inventor's Hall of Fame for satellite servicing techniques.

Havana Harbor

Havana Harbor is the port of Havana, the capital of Cuba, and it is the main port in Cuba (not including Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, a territory on lease by the United States). Most vessels coming to the island make port in Havana. Other port cities in Cuba include Cienfuegos, Matanzas, Manzanillo and Santiago de Cuba.
The harbour was created from the natural Havana Bay which is entered through a narrow inlet and which divides into three main harbors: Marimelena, Guanabacoa, and Atarés.
History.
It was fortified by the Spaniards in the sixteenth century who in 1553 transferred the governor's residence to Havana from Santiago de Cuba on the eastern end of the island, thus making Havana the de facto capital. The importance of these fortifications was early recognized as English, French, and Dutch sea marauders attacked the city in the 16th century. Later fortifications included the Fortaleza de San Carlos de la Cabaña, known as La Cabaña or Fort of Saint Charles, built in the 18th-century on the elevated eastern side of the harbor entrance as the largest fortress complex in the Americas. The fort rises above the 200-foot (60 m) hilltop, beside Morro Castle. Castillo de la Real Fuerza and San Salvador de la Punta Fortress, both constructed in sixteenth century, sit on the western side of the harbor in Old Havana.
The Battle of Havana was a two-month siege of the harbor defenses by the British in 1762.
USS "Maine".
The sinking of the U.S. battleship "Maine" in Havana Harbor in 1898 was the immediate cause of the Spanish-American War.
In January 1898 the USS "Maine", the largest vessel to come out of an American shipyard, was dispatched to Cuba to protect US interests there. At the time more than 8,000 US citizens resided in the country, and their safety could not be assured in the state of affairs at that time. On February 15, 1898 the "Maine" exploded and sank in the harbor . It became a major rallying call for the Spanish-American War, and it caused the US to finally intercede on Cuba's behalf. In 1910 the wreck was removed from the harbor as it was posing a hazard to navigation. It was sunk in deep water in the Gulf of Mexico with proper military ceremonies.
"La Coubre".
On March 4, 1960, the harbor was the scene of a deadly explosion when the French freighter "La Coubre", carrying 76 tons of Belgian munitions, was being unloaded. The cause of the blast, which killed an estimated 100 people, is often attributed to the CIA who wished to overthrow the new government of Fidel Castro.
Facilities.
Ensenada de Marimelena.
The town or Regla on Ensenada de Marimelena is a commercial and industrial suburb with the Galainela shipyard, ENA drydock, until recently operated as a joint venture with Curacao CDM, and the Navy's shipyard at Casablanca. Other docks include the Havana Container Terminal (TCH), the Ñico Lopez oil refinery, formerly a Shell refinery; and flour and wheat mills and aviation fuel depots.
Ensenada de Guanabacoa.
Least developed of the harbor arms.
Ensenada de Atarés.
The harbor in Old Havana offers cruise ship terminals, shipping and vessel repair services operated by Asticar.
Envionmental conditions.
As a harbor almost completely surrounded by shipping and industrial activities, the waters of the bay suffer from environmental stress. This in turn affects the water quality of the Caribbean Sea into which it flows. Water entering the bay as river flows or effluent from industrial processes has a residence in the harbor of 8 days, on average. It receives approximately 48,000 m3 of waste water per day, which carries about 4,800 kg of nitrogen and 1,200 kg of phosphorus, which results in elevated concentrations of nutrients. Havana Bay is strongly affected by sewage dumping, and it also receives suspended solids, hydrocarbons, heavy metals and pollutants from agriculture, industry and port activities. The leading sources of pollution in the bay have been identified as the Luyano River which contains organic material, nutrients, sewage, solid waste, the Regla oil refinery, fish hatcheries, and port activities. The high concentration of hydrocarbons, heavy metals and other pollutants is of concern as the harbor is an important fishing port.

Arithmetic combinatorics

In mathematics, arithmetic combinatorics arose out of the interplay between number theory, combinatorics, ergodic theory and harmonic analysis. It is about combinatorial estimates associated with arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). Additive combinatorics is the special case when only the operations of addition and subtraction are involved.
For example: if "A" is a set of "N" integers, how large or small can the sumset
the difference set
and the product set
be, and how are the sizes of these sets related? (Not to be confused: the terms difference set and product set can have other meanings.)
The sets being studied may also be subsets of algebraic structures other than the integers, for example, groups, rings and fields.
Arithmetic combinatorics is explained in Green's review of "Additive Combinatorics" by Tao and Vu.

Joseph Anton von Maffei

Joseph Anton von Maffei (4 September 1790 – 1 September 1870) was a German industrialist. Together with Joseph von Baader (1763–1835) and Baron Theodor Freiherr von Cramer-Klett (1817–1884), Maffei was one of the three most important railway pioneers in Bavaria.
Early life.
Joseph Anton Maffei was born in Munich, the son of an Italian tradesman from Verona. The Palazzo Maffei still stands today on the Piazza delle Erbe. His father came to Munich in order to run a tobacco wholesale business, that Joseph Anton Maffei continued. In 1835 Maffei was one of the founding shareholders of the Bavarian Mortgage and Discount Bank ("Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechselbank").
Railway Pioneer.
In 1836 Maffei founded the locomotive firm of J. A. Maffei in the English Garden in Munich. His desire was to make Bavaria competitive in the field of industrial engines. From small beginnings, a locomotive factory of world renown arose. Maffei, amongst others, also championed the construction of the railway line from Munich to Augsburg and supported Johann Ulrich Himbsel in building the private railway from Munich to Starnberg. In 1864 the 500th locomotive was delivered.
Other Achievements.
In 1851 Maffei supplied the first steamer, the "Maximilian", for boat services on Lake Starnberg. By 1926 there were 44 steamships.
Maffei was also a city councillor ("Magistratsrat") in Munich and busied himself e.g. with the construction of the famous hotel, the Bayerischer Hof.
Maffei's Legacy.
Joseph Anton Ritter von Maffei died on 1 September 1870. His grave may still be found today at the Old Southern Cemetery (Alter Südfriedhof) in Munich.
The locomotive works he founded survived him by some 60 years, but in 1930 J. A. Maffei went bankrupt and was amalgamated with the firm of Krauss in 1930 to form Krauss-Maffei.
Today, Villa Maffei in Feldafing (on Lake Starnberg) houses a museum and exhibitions.
Origin of the Maffei family.
The surname von Maffei or Maffei is a patronymic name derived from the personal name Matthäus (German). In ancient times the Maffei family settled in Verona from Germany.

Energy Technology Perspectives

Energy Technology Perspectives is a publication on energy technology published by the International Energy Agency’s (IEA). It demonstrates how technologies can help achieve the objective of limiting the global temperature rise to 2°C and enhancing energy security. 
G8 leaders invited the International Energy Agency to contribute to the Gleneagles G8 Plan of Action on Climate Change, Clean Energy and Sustainable Development in 2005. They asked the IEA to advise on alternative scenarios and strategies for a “clean, clever, competitive energy future”. The results of this initiative included the Energy Technology Perspectives, first published in 2006.
Energy Technology Perspectives (ETP) gives a long-term outlook on the global energy system. The main results are presented up to the year 2050. For the 2012 edition the analysis was extended to include scenarios up to 2075. ETP models the global energy system under different scenarios for around 500 technology options.
Aimed at policy makers, energy experts, business leaders and investors the book's purpose is to serve as a guide for decision makers on energy trends when setting policy and business objectives concerning energy technology.
The book is accompanied by an online component which includes data visualisations, downloadable data and figures complements.
Information on the modelling methodology, assumptions and results are also presented online.
ETP 2014.
Energy Technology Perspectives 2014 (ETP 2014) is set to be published in May 2014.
The publication will focus on electricity’s potential to increase energy efficiency and reduce emissions in the long-term. Limiting the long-term global temperature increase to 2 degrees remains a central objective of the work. 
The book, subtitled “Harnessing Electricity’s Potential” explains that electricity is key to sustainable energy systems for the future and focuses on what this means for generation, distribution and end-use consumption. 
ETP 2014 explores the possibility of “pushing the limits” in six key areas:
• Decarbonising energy supply: is solar the answer to a cleaner energy future? 
• What role will natural gas play: flexibility vs. base load? 
• Electrified transport: how quickly and far can we go? 
• Can energy storage become a game changer? 
• What is the best way to finance low-carbon sources for electricity generation? 
• How can India prepare for population growth driven energy demand increases?

School Psychological Examiner

Role of Psychological Examiners in schools.
School Psychological Examiners are assessors licensed by a State Department of Education to work with students from pre-kindergarten to twelfth grade in public schools, interviewing, observing, and administering and interpreting standardized testing instruments that measure cognitive and academic abilities, or describe behavior, personality characteristics, attitude or aptitude, in order to determine eligibility for special education services, placement, or conduct re-evaluation, or occupational guidance and planning. 
The work of the School Psychological Examiners is both, qualitative and quantitative in nature. They prepare psychoeducational evaluation reports based on test results and interpretation. Integrated with case history, the evaluation reports should present an accurate and clear profile of a student’s level of functioning or disability, strengths and weaknesses, compare test results with the standards of the evaluation instruments, analyze potential test biases, and develop appropriate recommendations to help direct educational interventions and services in a most inclusive and least restrictive environment. Evaluation reports are framed by laws and regulations applicable to testing and assessment in special education, and must follow school district policies and the codes of ethics applicable to education, special education, and psychological assessment.
School Psychological Examiners also provide psychoeducational interventions such as consultation services, collaboration in behavior management planning and monitoring, and devising social skills training programs in public schools.
Unless additionally trained and licensed, School Psychological Examiners do not offer or provide psychotherapy or clinical diagnostic/treatment services, which are attributions of licensed psychiatrists and clinical psychologists, as provided by law and professional regulations.
Qualifications.
School Psychological Examiners are highly trained and experienced educators who hold a master’s or higher degree in education or school counseling and at least one endorsement in special education. In addition to school district policies, School Psychological Examiners are bound by professional regulations, as well as by the ethical codes of testing and measurement. Other designations for School Psychological Examiners include ‘Educational Examiners’ or ‘Psychoeducational Examiners.’ Designation of this specialty varies among different school districts. 
'Psychometrist,’ from the term psychometrics, is an occupational designation not inclusive of the broader faculties of School Psychological Examiners. Psychometrists deal exclusively with quantitative test administration, do not require coursework beyond the bachelor's level, or licensure by a state department of education. Training of psychometrists is primarily done on-the-job, and their services are valuable in mental health community agencies, assessment and institutional research, or test-producing companies, etc., rather than in K-12 schools.
Graduate Training and Licensure of School Psychological Examiners.
Typical training includes coursework beyond the Master of Education, Master of Science in Education, or Master of Arts in Teaching degrees. Currently, School Psychological Examiners complete the courses required by their state department of education rather than by a prescribed self-contained program of studies. The coursework is equivalent to an entire Specialist or Doctoral Degree; unfortunately just a handful of institutions of higher education offer this kind of self-standing graduate program. Graduate courses, of psychological nature include:
Licensure as School Psychological Examiner demands experience in a special education or school counseling setting, satisfactory completion of the required graduate coursework and practicum, plus a passing score on the 'Praxis II Special Education: Knowledge-Based Core Principles'. Graduate school recommendation and verification of experience by the employing school district complete the requirements. In addition to the practicum, on-the-job mentoring supervision for at least two school years, sometimes four years, allows the transition from initial licensure to standard professional licensure. An annual professional development plan and ongoing performance-based evaluation ensure 'High Quality' professionalism as required by the No Child Left Behind law and related regulations.
School Psychological Examiners’ Competencies.
Additionally, high quality School Psychological Examiners exhibit proficiency-level knowledge on: 
Evaluation standards.
Evaluation standards provide guidelines for designing, implementing, assessing, and reporting the psychoeducational evaluation reported by school psychological examiners. The evaluation is informed by professional codes of ethics:

N73 road (Ireland)

The N73 road is a national secondary road in Ireland. It is made up entirely of single carriageway with few overtaking opportunities and only a small amount of hard shoulder. 
Route.
It runs roughly east-west from its junction with the M8 motorway, bypassing Mitchelstown to the north via the Mitchelstown relief road, which opened in July 2006. The route then travels through Kildorrery, a small village and then on towards Mallow merging with the N72. There are no major improvements proposed for this route in the foreseeable future and only minor improvements have been made to date. The route is entirely in County Cork. The N73 is 32 km long. On 25 May, 2009, a Mitchelstown bypass (section of the single carriageway N8 road) was redesignated the N73 when the Mitchelstown-Fermoy section of the M8 motorway opened to traffic.

Frederick Small

Frederick L. Small (d. January 15, 1918) was the convicted murderer of his wife, Florence Aileen Curry Small, in New Hampshire. Mr. and Mrs. Small took out a joint life insurance policy of $20,000 USD on March 16, 1916 from the John Hancock Company of Boston. The policy was written that the other spouse would collect if one spouse died. Mr. Small was 49 and Mrs. Small was 37 years old. One premium of $1,107.60 was paid before the incident.
Her body was found in the ruins of her burnt Ossipee Lake two-story cottage on September 28, 1916. Mr. Small had been at the cottage that evening, but was traveling back to Boston when the body was found. Mrs. Small's skull was crushed and also had a cord wrapped around her neck. She had also been shot, and there was evidence she had been chloroformed. The body would have been destroyed by the fire except for the fact that the fire had compromised the floor of the cottage. The body was found floating in the flooded basement.
At first the alibi of being in Boston was a good one, until investigators discovered an alarm clock, spark plug, fire screen, clock spring and some hairpins to make a timed arson device. Mr. Small was known to be a tinkerer who enjoyed mechanical projects.
Mr. Small offered a $1,000 reward for information leading to the murderer after he was taken into custody.
Mr. Small was employed as a stock broker in Boston. He was married three times.
In 1909 Small sued Arthur Soden, who was the president/part owner of the baseball team, Boston Beaneaters of the National League, for $500,000 USD. Small claimed that Soden had alienated the affections of Small's second wife. At the time the damage amount of the lawsuit was the largest in United States history, the equivalent of almost 12 million today's US dollars. Soden was ordered to pay Small a judgment of $10,000.
Aftermath of the crime.
The State of New Hampshire executed Small by hanging on January 15, 1918.
Mrs. Small is currently buried in the Grant Hill Cemetery in Center Ossipee. Through the efforts of the Ossipee Historical Society and citizens of Ossipee, Florence Small was given proper ceremony on the 91st anniversary of her death, and her site is now identified with a marker.

Snake-witch stone

The Snake-witch ("Ormhäxan"), Snake-charmer ("Ormtjuserskan") or Smiss stone ("Smisstenen") is a picture stone found at Smiss, När parish, Gotland, Sweden. Discovered in a cemetery, it measures in height and depicts a figure holding a snake in each hand. Above the figure there are three interlaced creatures (forming a triskelion pattern) that have been identified as a boar, an eagle, and a wolf. The stone has been dated to 400–600 AD.
Although many scholars call it the "Snake-witch", what the stone depicts—an accurate interpretation of the figures—and whether it derives from Celtic art or Norse art remain debated.
Parallels, interpretations, and speculation.
The figure on the stone was first described by Sune Lindquist in 1955. He tried unsuccessfully to find connections with accounts in Old Icelandic sources, and he also compared the stone with the Snake Goddess from Crete. Lindquist found connections with the late Celtic Gundestrup cauldron, although he appears to have overlooked that the cauldron also shows a figure holding a snake.
Arrhenius and Holmquist (1960) also found a connection with late Celtic art suggesting that the stone depicted Daniel in the lions' den and compared it with a depiction on a purse lid from Sutton Hoo, although the stone in question does not show creatures with legs. Arwidsson (1963) also attributed the stone to late Celtic art and compared it with the figure holding a snake on the Gundestrup cauldron. In a later publication Arrhenius (1994) considered the figure not to be a witch but a male magician and she dated it to the Vendel era. Hauk (1983), who is a specialist on bracteates, suggested that the stone depicts Odin in the fetch of a woman, while Görman (1983) has proposed that the stone depicts the Celtic god Cernunnos.
It also has been connected to a nearby stone relief on a door jamb at the church of Väte on Gotland which shows a woman who suckles two dragons, but this was made five centuries later than the picture stone.
Snake symbolism.
Snakes were popular as a motif on later picture stones which show snake pits, used as a painful means of execution; this form of punishment also is known through Norse sagas. Snakes are considered to have had an important symbolism during the passage from paganism to Germanic Christianity. They were frequently combined with images of deer, crustaceans, or supernatural beasts. The purpose may have been to protect the stones and to deter people who might destroy them.

Oryzomys antillarum

Oryzomys antillarum, also known as the Jamaican rice rat, is an extinct rodent of Jamaica. A member of the genus "Oryzomys" within the family Cricetidae, it is similar to "O. couesi" of mainland Central America, from where it may have dispersed to its island during the last glacial period. "O. antillarum" is common in subfossil cave faunas and is also known from three specimens collected live in the 19th century. Some historical records of Jamaican rats may pertain to it. The species probably became extinct late in the 19th century, perhaps due to the introduction of the small Asian mongoose, competition with introduced rodents such as the brown rat, and habitat destruction.
"Oryzomys antillarum" was a medium-sized rat, similar in most respects to "Oryzomys couesi". The head and body length was 120 to 132 mm (4.7 to 5.2 in) and the skull was about 30 mm (1.2 in) long. The upperparts were reddish and graded into the yellowish underparts. The tail was about as long as the head and body, sparsely haired, and darker above than below. The species differed from "O. couesi" in having longer nasal bones, shorter incisive foramina (perforations of the front part of the palate), and more robust zygomatic arches (cheekbones).
Taxonomy.
In his 1877 monograph on North American rodents, Elliott Coues mentioned two specimens of "Oryzomys" from Jamaica in the collections of the United States National Museum (USNM). According to Coues, the specimens were similar to the marsh rice rat ("Oryzomys palustris") of the United States, but different in color. Although he wrote that they probably represented a separate form, he refrained from giving a scientific name to them because of the possibility that the form had already received a name he did not know of. The species was first formally described by Oldfield Thomas in 1898 based on a specimen that had been in the British Museum of Natural History since 1845. He recognized it as a separate species of "Oryzomys", "Oryzomys antillarum", but wrote that it was related to the mainland Central American "O. couesi". Thomas suspected that the species was already extinct on Jamaica, but that it or a similar rice rat could still be found in the unexplored interior of Cuba or Hispaniola.
Revising North American "Oryzomys" in 1918, Edward Alphonso Goldman retained "O. antillarum" as a separate species, but conceded that it was so similar to mainland "O. couesi" that it may have been introduced on Jamaica. In 1920, Harold Anthony reported that remains of "O. antillarum" were common in coastal caves, suggesting that the species had previously been an important part of the diet of the barn owl ("Tyto alba"). In 1942, Glover Morrill Allen doubted that it was even a distinct species and in his 1962 Ph.D. thesis, Clayton Ray, who examined numerous cave specimens, agreed and retained it as only a "weakly differentiated subspecies" of "Oryzomys palustris" (which by then included "O. couesi" and other Mexican and Central American forms), "Oryzomys palustris antillarum". Philip Hershkovitz came to the same conclusion in a 1966 paper. After "O. couesi" of Mexico and Central America was again classified as a species distinct from the marsh rice rat ("O. palustris") of the United States, the Jamaican form came to be regarded as a subspecies of the former, "Oryzomys couesi antillarum".
In a 1993 review, Gary Morgan reinstated the animal as a distinct species closely related to "O. couesi", citing an unpublished paper by Humphrey, Setzer, and himself. Guy Musser and Michael Carleton, writing for the 2005 third edition of "Mammal Species of the World", continued to classify the Jamaican form as part of "O. couesi", but did not reference Morgan. However, in a 2006 review of the contents of "Oryzomys", Marcelo Weksler and colleagues listed "O. antillarum" as a separate species, citing Morgan, and in a 2009 paper on western Mexican "Oryzomys" Carleton and Joaquín Arroyo-Cabrales did the same.
According to the classification by Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, "Oryzomys antillarum" is one of eight species in the genus "Oryzomys", which occurs from the eastern United States ("O. palustris") into northwestern South America ("O. gorgasi"). "O. antillarum" is further part of the "O. couesi" section, which is centered around the widespread Central American "O. couesi" and also includes various other species with more limited and peripheral distributions. Many aspects of the systematics of the "O. couesi" section remain unclear and it is likely that the current classification underestimates the true diversity of the group. "Oryzomys" previously included many other species, which were progressively removed in various studies culminating in the 2006 paper by Weksler and colleagues, which excluded more than forty species from the genus. All are classified in the tribe Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), a diverse assemblage of American rodents of over a hundred species, and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of family Cricetidae, along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents.
Description.
"Oryzomys antillarum" was a medium-sized rodent, about as large as "O. couesi". According to Thomas's description, the upperparts were reddish, slightly brighter on the rump and more grayish on the head. The color of the upperparts graded into that of the underparts, which were yellowish. The hairs of the underparts were grayish at the bases. The small ears were black on the outer and yellow on the inner side and the upper surfaces of the hands and feet were whitish. The tail was nearly naked and was light brownish above and lighter below. Goldman wrote that the specimens in the USNM were rather more reddish, but their color may have been altered because they had been preserved in alcohol. Coues had described these as rusty brown above and washed with the same color below. Andrew Arata compared the USNM specimens with examples of the reddish Florida subspecies of the marsh rice rat, "Oryzomys palustris natator", for Ray and found that they were more reddish than even the most strongly colored animals from Florida.
The skull was generally similar to that of "Oryzomys couesi", as were the teeth. It was robust and bore well-developed supraorbital ridges (located above the eyes) on the braincase. The interparietal bone, part of the roof of the braincase, was small and narrow. The bony palate extended beyond the third molars. The nasal bones extended further back than the premaxillaries, whereas these bones are usually about coterminous in "O. couesi". On average, the incisive foramina, which perforate the front part of the palate, were shorter than in "O. couesi". The zygomatic arch (cheekbone) appears to have been better developed in "O. antillarum".
In the three modern and numerous cave specimens, condylobasal length (a measure of skull length) varies from 28.9 to 31.2 mm (1.14 to 1.23 in) (one modern and two cave specimens only), length of the bony palate from 13.0 to 17.8 mm (0.51 to 0.70 in), width of the interorbital region (located between the eyes) from 4.78 to 6.33 mm (0.188 to 0.249 in), length of the incisive foramina from 5.1 to 6.6 mm (0.20 to 0.26 in), crown length of the upper molars from 4.36 to 5.20 mm (0.172 to 0.205 in), and crown length of the lower molars from 4.80 to 5.39 mm (0.189 to 0.212 in).
History.
Origin and subfossil records.
The oldest well-dated record of "Oryzomys antillarum" is at Drum Cave in the Jacksons Bay Caves system, where it was found in a stratum radiocarbon dated to between 10,250 and 11,260 years before present according to a 2002 study. It is present in several other undated sites that predate the human colonization of the island, around 1,400 years before present. However, a site (Wallingford Roadside Cave) from the last interglacial, the Eemian, contains only the hystricognath rodents "Clidomys" and "Geocapromys browni" and lacks "Oryzomys". The presence of the rice rat on Jamaica before the arrival of humans disproves the hypothesis that it was introduced; instead, it must have reached the island by overwater dispersal through a rafting event, probably less than 125,000 years ago. During the last glacial period, low sea levels would have exposed much land between Jamaica and Central America, substantially decreasing the distance needed for the ancestor of "O. antillarum" to arrive on the island and probably influencing sea currents so that rafts of vegetation from Central America would be more likely to reach Jamaica. Species of "Oryzomys" are semiaquatic and closely associated with water, which may help to explain the occurrence of the genus on Jamaica. The rice rat has been found in many superficial, late Holocene cave deposits, some of which have been radiocarbon dated to within the last 1,100 years. Its remains also occur in some Amerindian archeological sites. From its common and widespread occurrence in caves, Ray suggested that the rice rat occurred in many different habitats before European contact. "O. antillarum" was the only sigmodontine rodent on any of the Greater Antilles, where the rodent fauna otherwise consists solely of hystricognaths and introduced rodents.
Historical records.
Although there are some early historical records of the rats of Jamaica, very little is to be found in them regarding "Oryzomys antillarum", perhaps because the species declined rapidly following the European colonization of the island and because early authors failed to distinguish it from introduced rodents (the black rat, "Rattus rattus"; brown rat, "Rattus norvegicus"; and house mouse, "Mus musculus"). Patrick Browne, in the 1756 "Civil and Natural History of Jamaica", described a "House and Cane-Rat", a "Mouse", and a large "Water-Rat", which he said had been introduced to the island and become very common there.
In his "History of Jamaica" (1774), Edward Long recognized four Jamaican rats: Browne's "Water-Rat", termed the "Charles-price rat", which Long regarded as identical with the European water vole ("Arvicola"); the "black house-rat", said to have been brought from England; and two he said were indigenous. The larger of those was a grayish "cane-rat" and the smaller was a reddish "field-rat" as large as the English mole (the European mole, "Talpa europaea"). Ray considered that the last may simply have been the house mouse, since the size of an English mole would be too small for "Oryzomys".
In "A Naturalist's Sojourn in Jamaica" (1851), Philip Henry Gosse listed the black and brown rat and the house mouse, as well as the "Cane-piece Rat", which he described as "Mus saccharivorus" and regarded as probably identical with Browne's "Water-Rat" and Long's "Charles-price Rat". He also mentioned the two species Long had listed as indigenous. Thomas and Ray both asserted that this "Cane-piece Rat" was most likely a brown rat, as judged from its measurements. Gosse wrote that an early explorer, Anthony Robinson, had described and pictured this species in an unpublished manuscript, on the basis of a specimen 20 in (50 cm) long, half of which consisted of the tail. Ray was unable to examine Robinson's manuscript, but suggested that Robinson's rat could not have been the brown rat, because that species did not reach the Americas until about 1800, and may instead have been "O. antillarum".
Gosse had collected the British Museum specimen of "Oryzomys antillarum" in 1845, but may not have separated it from introduced rats found with it. Coues noted that the two USNM specimens he examined were received after he had written the preceding part of his monograph; later, Thomas and others wrote that these specimens were obtained around 1877, but Ray asserted that they were taken before 1874. No specimens have been collected since.
Extinction.
"Oryzomys antillarum" probably became extinct about the 1870s and is currently listed as such by the IUCN Red List. Its disappearance is usually attributed to the small Asian mongoose ("Herpestes javanicus"), which was introduced to Jamaica in 1872, and sometimes also to introduced "Rattus" species. Ray, on the other hand, argued that the significance of the mongoose had been overrated. Instead, he suggested that "Oryzomys antillarum" may have been affected by the massive environmental changes that occurred on the island after the British takeover in 1655. In that period, the bulk of the island came to be used for cultivation, so that the native habitat of "Oryzomys" was destroyed. Thus, "Oryzomys" was reduced to competition with introduced rats in man-made habitats, to which the latter are well adapted. Perhaps, Ray wrote, the black rat may not have been able to extirpate "Oryzomys", but the brown rat, a later and more assertive invader, brought it to extinction. Cats and dogs preying on "Oryzomys" may also have contributed to its demise.

El Condor Pasa (horse)

El Condor Pasa (Japanese : エルコンドルパサー, March 17, 1995 - July 16, 2002) was an American-bred, Japanese-trained Thoroughbred racehorse. In 1998 he won the NHK Mile Cup and the Japan Cup. In the following year he was campaigned in Europe where he won the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud and the Prix Foy before finishing second in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. He was retired to stud but died after three seasons following unsuccessful colic surgery. El Condor Pasa has been described as the best Japanese racehorse of the 20th century.
Background.
El Condor Pasa was a dark bay horse with a large white star bred in Kentucky by his Japanese owner Takashi Watanabe. His sire, Kingmambo was a highly successful breeding stallion. His progeny included the British Classic winners Light Shift, Russian Rhythm, King's Best, Henrythenavigator, Virginia Waters and Rule of Law as well as major winners in Japan, France (Divine Proportions) and the United States (Lemon Drop Kid). Watanabe sent the horse into training with Yoshi Ninomiya, who operated a small stable with only ten horses.
Racing career.
El Condor Pasa won his only race as a two-year-old in 1997. In the following year he won his first four races culminating in a win in the Group One NHK Mile Cup at Tokyo Racecourse on 17 May. After a summer break he returned in October and was tried beyond a mile for the first time when finishing second to Silence Suzuka in the Mainichi Okan. Despite losing his unbeaten record he started 5/1 third favourite for the Japan Cup over one and a half miles on 29 November. Ridden by Masayoshi Ebina, he took the lead in the straight and won by two and a half lengths from the mare Air Groove and the favourite Special Week. His win was enthusiastically received by the crowd of 146,879 and his trainer described the winner as "a hero... he has a huge heart".
In 1999 El Condor Pasa was sent to France where he was trained with the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe as his objective. On his first European outing he finished second to Croco Rouge in the Prix d'Ispahan at Longchamp Racecourse in May. Two months later he faced opponents from France, Germany and Britain in the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud. Ebina sent the colt into the lead in the straight and he drew clear to win by two and a half lengths from Tiger Hill and Dream Well, with Sagamix and Borgia among those unplaced. On his final trial for the Arc he defeated Borgia and Croco Rouge in the Prix Foy at Longchamp in September. On 3 October, El Condor Pasa started the 18/5 second favourite for the Arc behind Montjeu, the three-year-old winner of both the Prix du Jockey Club and Irish Derby. El Condor Pasa led from the start and broke clear of the field in the straight to establish a three length advantage. Montjeu emerged as his only challenger, and although El Condor Pasa rallied when the French colt drew alongside him he was overtaken in the last hundred metres and beaten by half a length. The first two were six lengths clear of the third placed Croco Rouge.
Assessment and honours.
El Condor Pasa was named Japanese Champion Three-year-old Colt for 1998. Despite never running in Japan during the following year, El Condor Pasa's performances in France led to his being voted the 1999 Japanese Champion Older Horse and Japanese Horse of the Year.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated El Condor Pasa the best racehorse trained in Japan in the 20th century.
Stud record.
El Condor Pasa was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at the Shadai Stallion Station in Hokkaido. In July 2002 the horse became gravely ill with horse colic. El Condor Pasa underwent surgery but died at 9.10 p.m. on 16 July.
His three crops of foals contained several major winners including Vermilion (Japan Cup Dirt, February Stakes), Song of Wind (Kikuka Shō) and Alondite (Japan Cup Dirt).

Vygantas

Vygantas (baptized Alexander; ; died June 28, 1392) was Duke of Kernavė. He was one of the sons of Algirdas, Grand Duke of Lithuania (1345–1377), and his second wife Uliana Alexandrovna of Tver.
In 1385 Vygantas supported his older brother Jogaila by signing the Union of Krewo. In 1386 he was baptized as "Alexander" and married with Hedwig, daughter of Władysław Opolczyk, in 1390. Polish nobles expected that Władysław would grant Vygantas the Dobrzyń Land, contested territory between Poland and the Teutonic Knights, as his dowry. Vygantas received Kuyavia from Jogaila instead. In 1388 he supported Poland in an armed conflict with the Teutonic Knights. He also supported Jogaila in the Lithuanian Civil War (1389–1392) against Vytautas the Great. Vygantas was considered as a replacement for unpopular Skirgaila as Grand Duke of Lithuania. However, he soon died. The rumors had it that he was poisoned – either by Vytautas or Skirgaila. He is buried in Vilnius Cathedral together with his brother Karigaila, who died in the civil war in 1390.
Vygantas should not be confused with his brother Andrei of Polotsk, who is sometimes referred to as Wigunt-Andrei following confused 15th-century chronicles of Jan Długosz. Kazimierz Stadnicki in his work "Bracia Władysława-Jagiełły Olgierdowicza" (published in 1867) suggested that Vygantas and his elder brother Theodore were the same person, but this theory was rejected.

Immortality (novel)

Immortality () is a novel in eight parts, written by Milan Kundera in 1988 in Czech. First published 1990 in French. English edition 345 p., translation by Peter Kussi. This novel springs from a casual gesture of a woman, seemingly to her swimming instructor. Immortality is the last of a trilogy that includes "The Book Of Laughter And Forgetting", and "The Unbearable Lightness Of Being."
Plot.
Divided into seven parts, Immortality centers on Agnes, her sister Laura and her husband Paul. Part One: the Face establishes these characters. Part Two: Immortality depicts Goethe's frauth relationship with Bettina, a young woman who aspires to create a place for herself in the pantheon of history by controlling Goethe's legacy after his death. Part Three: Agnes and Laura fight, while focusing on the deteriorating state of Laura's relationship with Bernard Bertrand. Part Four: Homo Sentamentalis chronicles Goethe's afterlife and postmortem friendship with Ernest Hemingway. Part Five: Chance sees Agnes' death, and intersects these fictional events with Kundera's seemingly autobiographical account of a conversation with Professor Avenarius. Part Six: the Dial introduces a new character, Rubens, who had an affair with Agnes years prior to the onset of the main events in the plot. Part Seven: the Celebration concludes the novel in the same health club where Kundera first observed the inspirational wave gesture.

L'Aigle (meteorite)

L'Aigle is a L6 meteorite fallen in 1803 in Lower Normandy, France.
History.
In the early afternoon of 26 April 1803 a meteorite shower of more than 3000 fragments fell upon the town of L'Aigle in Normandy (France). Upon hearing of this event the French Academy of Sciences sent the young scientist Jean-Baptiste Biot to investigate that spectacular fall of stones. After painstaking work in the field he reported two kinds of evidence pointing to an extraterrestrial origin for the stones:
Biot's passionate paper describing how these stones must undoubtedly be of extraterrestrial origin effectively gave birth to the science of meteoritics.
The L'Aigle event was a real milestone in the understanding of meteorites and their origins because at that time the mere existence of meteorites was harshly debated, if they were recognised their origin was controversial, with most commentators agreeing with Aristotle that they were terrestrial, and witnessed meteorite falls were treated with great skepticism. The meteorite has since been stored along with Angers, another meteorite that struck France 19 years later, in a room at the Muséum d’histoire naturelle d’Angers, a French natural history museum.
Composition and classification.
It is a L6 type ordinary chondrite.

Orcustus

Orcustus is a Norwegian black metal band formed in 2002.
History.
Orcustus is a black metal band formed in Bergen, Norway, in early 2002 by Taipan, Dirge Rep, Infernus and Tormentor. Their moniker, meaning "the inner circle of Hell where Lucifer resides on his throne", was suggested by Dirge Rep and the band got approval to use it from the name's rightful owner, Bård "Faust" Eithun, who published an underground fanzine with the same name in the early 1990s.
Summer 2002 saw the band beginning to rehearse three tracks which eventually became the "Demo 2002". These tracks were already written by Taipan for his former band Abattoir during the years 1998-2000. The demo was recorded in the autumn of 2002 and released early in 2003. The demo was quickly sold out, and garnered praise from well-known figures in the black metal scene, such as Fenriz of Darkthrone. This release led to a deal with the American label Southern Lord Recordings and later that year two tracks from the demo were released as the World Dirtnap 7” EP. Work for their debut album then began.
Teloch entered the band in 2004 and contributed with the track "Grin of Deceit" to the 2005 Wrathrash 7” EP. The title track hailed from the Abattoir days. A track called "I Satans virke" was also recorded in that session for a split 7” EP with the Norwegian band Daudur due for release on Worship Him Records in 2009. Teloch’s involvement with Orcustus came to an end in 2006.
After five years in the making, recording the Orcustus full-length album commenced in spring 2007. Recording and mixing were completed in June 2008. By this time inner and outer adversity had taken its toll and the decision was made to end the band. However, in the last week of 2008, Dirge Rep and Taipan decided to pick up the pieces in order to resurrect Orcustus.

Mustafa Topchubashov

Dr. Mustafa Agha bey oglu Topchubashov (Azeri: "Mustafa Topçubaşov"; 5 August 1895, Yerevan – 23 November 1981, Baku), Ph.D., was an Azerbaijani surgeon, Hero of Socialist Labor, Stalin Prize winner, and recipient of the Order of Lenin.
Early life.
Mustafa Topchubashov was born in Erivan (now Yerevan) to Agha bey and Fatma khanim Topchubashov, wealthy landowners of the Erivan Governorate (then the Russian Empire, now in Armenia). After completing his primary and secondary education in his hometown, young Topchubashov left for Kiev in 1916 to study medicine at the Saint Vladimir University. Despite the outbreak of World War I and the subsequent Russian Civil War, he managed to obtain a degree and having suffered hunger and numerous arrests in the politically unstable Ukraine, came to Baku (then capital of the short-lived Azerbaijan Democratic Republic) in 1919 to work as an assistant at the Department of Surgery of the Azerbaijan State University. Beginning in 1922, Topchubashov worked in Nakhchivan, where he performed the first professional medical surgery both in his career and in the history of this city.
Career.
After spending six months in Germany, Topchubashov returned to Baku in 1927 and started working at the Azerbaijan Medical University. In 1930 he defended his Ph.D. thesis and was promoted to Head of Department of Surgery at the same university, where he worked for the next 45 years. During the World War II he was in charge of the hospitals for evacuees in Azerbaijan. From 1950 on, he was Chairman of the Azerbaijan Committee for World Protection (local branch of the World Peace Council). He was one of the founders of the National Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan whose Vice-President he was in 1951–1957 and from 1969 until his death. In 1951, Topchubashov became a corresponding member of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. He was elected active member of the Academy of Medical Sciences of the USSR in 1960.
In 1953–1955 and in 1967–1971 Topchubashov was Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan SSR. In 1943 he received the Stalin Prize, the highest ranking award in the state. He was awarded with the Order of Lenin thrice.
Personal life.
In 1923 he married young painter Reyhan Akhundova (1905–1970), a Guba-native. They had three children: son Ibrahim (1924–1970) and twin daughters Zemfira and Elmira (born 1927). Topchubashov's son, daughter Zemfira and grandson Jeyhun pursued careers in medicine as well.
Mustafa Topchubashov died in 1981 in Baku. His name was given to a street in Baku, a ferryboat, and the Institute of Experimental Surgery, of which Topchubashov was head in 1945–1948. Azerbaijan Medical University students with high academic standing can be eligible for the Topchubashov Scholarship. Azerbaijani medics performing outstanding research in their field are awarded with the Medal of Topchubashov.

International Society for Design and Development in Education

The International Society for Design and Development in Education (ISDDE) was formed in 2005 with the goal of improving educational design around the world. Educational design has been a secondary concern in a number of settings and there has been very little direct attention focused on design principles and design processes in educational design.
Society goals.
The society has a number of goals, including:
Governance.
The society governance is outlined in its constitution. In brief, the society is run by an Executive of at least 12 members. Within the Executive, there are three officers with particular duties (such as appointing local chairs of the annual conference, organizing the prize process, etc.)
ISDDE Journal.
Starting in 2008, the society developed an open access Electronic journal, called the Educational Designer.
Prizes for Excellence in Design for Education, the "Eddies".
Starting in 2008, ISDDE supports a 10,000 USD prize for excellence in educational design, known as the "Eddies". The prize alternates across years between rewarding particular designs and rewarding lifetime contributions to educational design.

Bắc Lệ ambush

The Bac Le ambush (, Vietnamese: "trận Bắc Lệ" or "trận cầu Quan Âm") was a clash during the Tonkin Campaign in June 1884 between Chinese troops of the Guangxi Army and a French column sent to occupy Lang Son and other towns near the Chinese border. The French claimed that their troops had been ambushed by the Chinese. The incident led to the Sino-French War (August 1884–April 1885).
Background.
In late 1883 France and China began to fight an undeclared war in Tonkin. In December 1883, in the Son Tay Campaign, the French defeated the Black Flag Army and captured the town of Son Tay. In March 1884, in the Bac Ninh campaign, they defeated China's Guangxi Army and captured the strategically important town of Bac Ninh on the Mandarin Road.
The defeat at Bac Ninh, coming close on the heels of the fall of Son Tay, strengthened the hand of the moderate element in the Chinese government and temporarily discredited the extremist 'Purist' party led by Zhang Zhidong, which was agitating for a full-scale war against France. Further French successes in the spring of 1884, including the capture of Hung Hoa and Thai Nguyen, convinced the Empress Dowager Cixi that China should come to terms, and an accord was reached between France and China in May. The negotiations took place in Tianjin (Tientsin). Li Hongzhang, the leader of the Chinese moderates, represented China; and Captain François-Ernest Fournier, commander of the French cruiser "Volta", represented France. The Tientsin Accord, concluded on 11 May 1884, provided for a Chinese troop withdrawal from Tonkin in return for a comprehensive treaty that would settle details of trade and commerce between France and China and provide for the demarcation of its disputed border with Vietnam. 
Fournier was not a professional diplomat, and the Tientsin Accord contained several loose ends. Crucially, it failed to explicitly state a deadline for the Chinese troop withdrawal from Tonkin. The French asserted that the troop withdrawal was to take place immediately, while the Chinese argued that the withdrawal was contingent upon the conclusion of the comprehensive treaty. In fact, the Chinese stance was an ex post facto rationalisation, designed to justify their unwillingness or inability to put the terms of the accord into effect. The accord was extremely unpopular in China, and provoked an immediate backlash. The war party called for Li Hongzhang's impeachment, and his political opponents intrigued to have orders sent to the Chinese troops in Tonkin to hold their positions.
Li Hongzhang hinted to the French that there might be difficulties in enforcing the accord, but nothing specific was said. The French assumed that the Chinese troops would leave Tonkin as agreed, and made preparations for occupying Lang Son and other cities up to the Chinese border.
The approach march.
In early June 1884 a French column under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Alphonse Dugenne advanced to occupy the border towns of Lang Son, Cao Bang and That Khe. Dugenne's column consisted of a battalion of marine infantry ("chef de bataillon" Reygasse), an artillery battery (Captain Jourdy), a newly recruited company of Tonkinese riflemen, and a small force of "chasseurs d'Afrique" (Captain Laperrine). Reygasse's "marsouins" were veteran soldiers, who had served under the command of Commandant Henri Rivière at the Capture of Nam Dinh (March 1883), but the Tonkinese riflemen had only been recruited several days earlier, and were of negligible military value. The column needed to take food and rations for 45 days, and the combatants (450 Frenchmen and 350 Tonkinese) were accompanied by 1,000 Vietnamese porters, 240 French mule drivers and 200 mules. As the French were advancing through unknown country, Captain Jean-François-Alphonse Lecomte of the topographical service rode with the column to map the route. Lecomte, who served with distinction on General Louis Brière de l'Isle's staff throughout the Sino-French War, would later write a detailed account of the ambush, "Le guet-apens de Bac-Lé" (Paris, 1890). 
The column formed at Phu Lang Thuong, the most advanced French post on the Mandarin Road, on 11 June. It set off for Lang Son on 12 June, reaching Phu Xuyen on 13 June, Kep on 14 June and Cau Son on 15 June. The march, under a sweltering summer sun, was gruelling, and on 15 June Dugenne sent Jourdy's battery back to Phu Lang Thuong. At the same time he was reinforced by a company of "zéphyrs" from "chef de bataillon" Servière's 2nd African Light Infantry Battalion. 
Recent heavy rain had swollen the Song Thuong river, and the French were unable to use the ford at Cau Son. The column therefore remained at Cau Son for three days while its engineers bridged the Song Thuong, and only resumed its march on 19 June. For the next three days the column pressed on to the northeast, marching parallel to the course of the Thuong river and camping in the open country between Cau Son and the small town of Bac Le. The French now became aware that their march was being observed. Single shots were heard in the distance at regular intervals, and on one occasion French cavalry scouts came under fire. It was not clear whether the attackers were Vietnamese bandits or Chinese soldiers. On the morning of 22 June the French column reached Bac Le. Continuing their march in the afternoon, the French descended once more into the Song Thuong valley and rejoined the river. Dugenne's intention was to cross the Song Thuong and continue up the Mandarin Road to Thanh Moy and Lang Son. The river was still swollen, and on the evening of 22 June Dugenne scouted its southern bank for a suitable ford. Chinese soldiers were visible on the other side of the river, and Laperrine's troopers covered them with their carbines while a French NCO tested the depth of the river. Neither side opened fire. Believing that he was dealing with stragglers from the Guangxi Army who would not oppose his passage, Dugenne gave orders for a crossing of the Song Thuong the following morning.
In fact Dugenne was facing a force of 3,100 regular Chinese soldiers of the Guangxi Army under the command of Wan Zhongxuan (萬重暄). This force consisted of eight battalions under the command of Huang Yuxian (黃玉賢) and one battalion under the command of Wang Hongshun (王洪順). A further 1,500 Chinese troops under the command of Pan Dingxin (潘鼎新) were camped close by. Most of the Chinese troops were armed with modern rapid-firing Remington rifles. Both commanders were aware of the provisions of the Tientsin Accord, but as a result of the political intrigues aimed at Li Hongzhang they had received no instructions to withdraw from Tonkin. They had instead been ordered by the commander of the Guangxi Army (a yung-ying regional army), Wang Debang (王德榜), to hold their positions. Wang Debang had experience serving with General Zuo Zongtang.
The ambush.
By then an interesting situation had developed at the French advance posts. At 9 a.m. three Chinese envoys came forward with a written message for Dugenne from the Chinese commanders. Lecomte let them through, and an interview took place. Although Dugenne's Vietnamese interpreters were unable to grasp some of the subtleties in the Chinese message, they were able to establish that the French were facing regular troops of the Guangxi Army and that the Chinese commanders were aware of their obligations under the Tientsin Accord. The Chinese generals explained that they had received no orders to withdraw, and were consequently obliged to remain in their positions until further notice. They requested Dugenne to send a heliograph message back to Hanoi to seek instructions. 
In view of the diplomatic significance of the confrontation, Dugenne should have reported the presence of the Chinese force to Hanoi and asked for further instructions. Instead, he informed the Chinese at 3 p.m. that he would continue his march up the Mandarin Road in one hour's time. According to Captain Lecomte (normally a reliable source), Dugenne believed that the Chinese would let him pass, and his intention was merely to get his column away from the swollen Song Thuong River and to find a secure camping ground for the night. 
At 4 p.m. Dugenne resumed his advance. Aware of the potential for a misunderstanding, he gave strict instructions that nobody was to open fire except on his order. For several minutes the French column marched unmolested along a jungle path towards a group of Chinese forts on the cliffs of Nui Dong Nai. Seeing the path opening into a clearing, Dugenne ordered Laperrine's cavalry to replace an inexperienced section of Tonkinese riflemen at the front of the column. As the French cavalry spurred their horses forward to move to the front of the column, Chinese infantry in the Nui Dong Nai forts suddenly opened fire on them. Seconds later, Chinese infantry shadowing the march of the French column opened fire on both its flanks. It is not clear whether the Chinese were alarmed by the sudden movement of the French cavalry or (as the French believed) they mistook the horsemen for a party of senior officers and deliberately fired on this tempting target. 
The marine infantry of the French vanguard deployed as best they could and replied to the Chinese fire. Dugenne, who was leading the column's main body, ordered a bugler to sound for a ceasefire, but the bugle call had no effect. The Chinese were sounding their own trumpets to bring more of their own men into action, and as it became clear that the battle could not be stopped Dugenne planned his defence. He formed his men into a square, enclosing his vulnerable baggage train, and ordered them to dig trenches. During the late afternoon of 23 March the French successfully repelled repeated Chinese attacks, and were even able to counterattack with some effect. However, the Chinese brought up fresh troops during the night, and occupied positions on the heights of Nui Dong Nai from which they could fire down on the French square. 
On the morning of June 24, the Chinese worked their way around the sides of the French square in an attempt to cut the column's line of retreat to the Song Thuong. Dugenne made several local counterattacks to take some air around his positions, but it soon became obvious that, with no artillery support, the French would be encircled and annihilated if they remained where they were. At 11 a.m. Dugenne issued orders for a withdrawal to the Song Thuong. 
Although the column suffered heavy casualties from rifle fire during the withdrawal and was forced to abandon its baggage train, Dugenne successfully fought his way out of the threatened encirclement and extricated his small force. Captain Laperrine, the commander of Dugenne's small cavalry contingent, dismounted his troopers so that wounded men could be loaded onto the cavalry horses. The successful evacuation of the wounded was due in no small measure to the coolness with which Laperrine and his "chasseurs d'Afrique" covered the retreat.
Falling back by echelons, the French recrossed the Song Thuong under fire and regrouped on its southern bank. In the afternoon of 24 June the column retreated to Bac Le, followed at a respectful distance by the victorious Chinese, and occupied a defensive position on a high plateau.
The relief expedition.
Dugenne had heliographed news of the battle back to Hanoi during the night of 23 June, and General Millot, the French commander-in-chief, immediately despatched General François de Négrier and Lieutenant-Colonel Letellier to Dugenne's assistance with a substantial relief column assembled from the garrisons of Hanoi and Bac Ninh. He also ordered the 2nd Brigade of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps to concentrate at Phu Lang Thuong. De Négrier left Hanoi on 24 June with two Turco battalions, two companies of the 143rd Line Battalion and two 80-millimetre artillery batteries. Travelling upriver aboard a flotilla of steamboats to Phu Lang Thuong and thereafter marching light, de Négrier's relief column reached Cau Son on the evening of 25 June.
De Négrier joined Dugenne's column near Bac Le on the morning of 27 June and made preparations for an immediate counterattack to throw the Chinese back across the Song Thuong. The French scouted the Chinese positions during the afternoon, and de Négrier issued orders for an attack the following morning. However, on the evening of 27 June he received a heliograph message from Millot, ordering him to return to Hanoi at once. The French premier Jules Ferry had decided to lodge a diplomatic protest and demand an explanation from the Chinese government. De Négrier complied with this unwelcome order. During the night of 28 June, under cover of a heavy thunderstorm, he and Dugenne withdrew their respective commands from the Bac Le plateau unnoticed by the Chinese. On the afternoon of 29 June the French reached Cau Son, where the wounded from the Bac Le battle were evacuated back to Phu Lang Thuong by junk. At Phu Lang Thuong the wounded were transferred to the gunboat "Éclair", which ferried them rapidly back to Hanoi. In early July the exhausted men of Dugenne's column returned to Hanoi. De Négrier remained at Phu Lang Thuong with the 2nd Brigade, pressing Millot in vain for orders to attack the Chinese.
Casualties.
French casualties in the Bac Le Ambush were 22 dead and 70 wounded. Chinese casualties were markedly higher, approximately 300 dead and wounded in total.
Millot's order of the day.
On July 1, 1884, General Millot issued the following order of the day to the men of Dugenne's column. Significantly, he blamed the engagement near Bac Le on the bad faith of the Chinese and described it as an ambush. Henceforth, the battle became, in French eyes, the 'Bac Le ambush'.
Partis en petit nombre pour occuper, conformément aux ordres du Gouvernement et suivant les conventions de Tien-Tsin, les places frontières du Tonkin et de la Chine, vous avez étés attaqués dans les gorges de Lang-Son par un ennemi déloyal qui s’était préparé pour vous attaquer dans un guet-apens. Mais grâce à votre énergie, vous avez déjoué toutes ses ruses, vous avez combattu avec succès à une contre dix et vous avez fait respecter le drapeau et l’honneur de nos armes. Quelques baggages abandonnés par les coolies sont restés au pouvoir de l’ennemi. Je le proclame bien haut : vous valez les soldats de la première République. Si vous n’avez pas vaincu, vous avez rassuré la France par votre courage, votre constance et votre héroïsme. Honneur à vous, soldats, la République vous remercie et inscrira un glorieux fait d’armes dans ses annales.
Significance.
When news of the 'Bac Le ambush' reached Paris, there was fury at what was perceived as blatant Chinese treachery. Ferry’s government demanded an apology, an indemnity, and the immediate implementation of the terms of the Tientsin Accord. The Chinese government agreed to negotiate, but refused to apologise or pay an indemnity. The mood in France was against compromise, and although negotiations continued throughout July, Admiral Amédée Courbet was ordered to take his Far East Squadron to Fuzhou (Foochow). The negotiations broke down in mid-August and on 23 August 1884, at the Battle of Fuzhou, Courbet annihilated China's Fujian Fleet, inaugurating the nine-month Sino-French War. The defeat of the French forces also resulted in the unsuccessful French attempt to attack and take Taiwan, where the Chinese Huai Army under Liu Mingchuan defeated the French at the Keelung Campaign and Battle of Tamsui.

Petriana

Petriana (with the alternative Roman name of Uxelodunum and the modern name of Stanwix Fort) was a Roman fort. It was the largest fort on Hadrian's Wall, and is now buried beneath the village of Stanwix, Cumbria, England.
Roman name.
The fort was called Petrianis in the Notitia Dignitatum, but on the Ravenna Cosmography it is called Uxellodamo, whilst on the Rudge Cup and the Amiens Skillet it is called Uxelodum and Uxelodunum, respectively. The name Petrianis comes from the cohort that was stationed there. Uxelodunum, which appears to be a latinisation of a Celtic toponym, is thought to mean "High Fort".
It is thus likely that the name Petriana was a scribal error which confused the fort's name and the occupying unit, and that the fort's true name was Uxelodunum.
Description.
The fort is about eight miles west of the fort of Castlesteads (Camboglanna) and five and a half miles east of Burgh by Sands (Aballava). It stands on a natural platform above the River Eden. The fort measures about north to south by east to west, covering approximately , much larger than the other wall forts. The fort is adjacent to the Wall, which passes along its north side. Apparently the fort was intended to guard the Eden bridgehead and watch the important western route to and from Scotland.
The fort is now covered with buildings in the modern village of Stanwix.
Garrison.
Because of the large size of the fort, it is thought to have housed a cavalry regiment, one thousand strong. This was almost certainly the Ala Petriana, the sole regiment of this size on the Wall. This was a distinguished auxiliary regiment, whose soldiers had been made Roman citizens for valour on the field of battle. It seems that the fort was given the name of its garrison, thus supplanting the earlier name of Uxelodunum.
Excavations.
Excavations were made in 1932-4, and the ditch for the south rampart was traced, as well as the Wall, which formed the north face of the fort. Barrack-like buildings were also found within the outline of the fort. In 1939 a large granary, lying east to west, was found in extending the local school-yard. In 1940 the south-west angle tower was found as well as the south and east walls.
In 1934 various objects were found which appeared to have been washed down into the river from the fort. These included brooches, mountings for cavalrymen’s uniforms and harness.
The Vallum has been traced to a point just short of the south-east angle of the fort.

Conrad Heighton Leigh

Conrad Heighton Leigh (born 1883) was an English artist, illustrator and member of Brighton Arts Club.
Life and work.
Conrad Leigh was born in Brighton, Sussex on 27 May 1883. His father was Thomas Leigh M.R.C.P.S., L.R.C.P. a surgeon. He attended Rostellan House School, Brighton and the Old Brighton Grammar School before studying at the Brighton school of art (much later merged into Brighton University) under William H. Bond (1861–1918) He went on to study at the Slade School of Art in London and the Académie Julian in Paris. He is particularly well known for his sporting and military subjects, many of which were used as illustrations for books, periodicals and popular postcards in the early half of the 20th century. His work featured regularly in the Strand Magazine, The Daily Mirror, Wide World and Windsor.
During the first decade of the 20th century Conrad Leigh was commissioned to paint a panel for the luncheon room at the Hall of the Carpenters' Company in London Wall, a livery company of the City of London. The hall was completely burnt out during an air raid of 10 May 1941, when a gas main in London wall ignited, however most of the pictures survived. In 1915 Leigh was commissioned by the wallpaper manufacturers John Gilkes and Sons to provide designs for their wallpaper range and additionally designed their celebrated promotion poster in 1920 which has been reproduced and is retailed by many modern print and poster stores. The original period 1920 printing is highly sought after and exchanges hands for hundreds of pounds sterling. A further celebrated poster was designed by Leigh for the Brighton Carnival (24 June to 1 July c.1920s, actual year is unknown), again this poster has been recently reproduced and retailed in print and poster stores. Conrad Leigh worked at 68 Grand Parade, Brighton, now the site of the Brighton University The Faculty of Arts and Architecture. The date and place of his death is unknown.

Power-Plate

Power Plate is a brand of vibrating platform used as exercise equipment. It consists of a vibrating base, which may vibrate up and down approximately (1/16") 25 to 50 times per second.
Usage.
The machine is large enough to accommodate a person in deep squat. Traditional exercises such as squats and push-ups are done on the vibrating base. People typically do a series of exercises for 30 seconds to one minute each on the machine, with rests of a similar duration.
Claims.
Makers claim that using the Power-Plate for 10 minutes is equivalent to 60 minutes of conventional exercise. In order to develop strength, power, muscle tone, and definition, conventional exercises are conducted putting tension on the muscles while standing on the Power-Plate.
The brand has self promoted the machine by highly publicizing its use by celebrities, such as Madonna, Jonathan Ross, Donatella Versace, Claudia Schiffer, and Natalie Imbruglia.
Stevie Nicks has said that the Power Plate machine is a central part of her exercise regimen.
History.
The muscle-activation technique through vibration was initially studied by Russian scientist Vladimir Nazarov; it found application in the Russian space program helping to prevent astronauts' muscles and bones wasting in space. A commercial version of the machine was marketed by Guus van der Meer and others since 1999 under the name Power Plate. The Power Plate accelerates mainly in a vertical direction in an almost perfect sine wave.

Bologna Museum of Modern Art

The Bologna Museum of Modern Art (MAMbo, or "Museo d’Arte Moderna di Bologna") is a purpose-designed centre of modern and experimental art, located in the centre of Bologna, Italy.
History.
Now an independent entity, the Bologna Museum of Modern Art was originally one of the three museums that came under the aegis of the Bologna Gallery of Modern Art, founded in 1925; the other two being the Modern Art Gallery at Villa delle Rose and the Morandi Museum in the city's main square, Piazza Maggiore.
Independence.
The Bologna Museum of Modern Art came into existence as a separate entity in the 1990s, when the Modern Art Gallery's collections had grown so large by acquisition and bequest that new premises needed to be found for its contemporary art collection and exhibitions. Lorenzo Sassoli de Bianchi, currently President of Italy's leading health food company, Valsoia, and of the country's Advertisers' Association, Utenti Pubblicità Associati - UPA, was invited to become its first President in 1995 on the strength of his reputation as an art collector, innovator and organiser. Sassoli de Bianchi was reappointed President for a further 5 years in 2009.
New role and mission.
Sassoli de Bianchi formulated a bold programme that has repositioned the museum with a precise cultural role not just in Bologna but in Italy. The project brought the museum purpose-designed new premises within the shell of an extensive former industrial bakery in Bologna's city centre and a new corporate identity and name, or rather acronym, as MAMbo. Above all, however, it tightened the museum’s focus from contemporary art in general to experimental art in particular - a focus rare in Italy, yet rooted in Bologna's artistic and university heritage. 
Supporting this focus on experimental art, Sassoli de Bianchi brought the young art critic and museum manager Gianfranco Maraniello; into the project in 2005, appointing him Director. 
The museum simultaneously gained a new mission, not just as a permanent exhibition and exhibition space, but as an experimental, informational and social hub for young contemporary artists, providing a regional, national and international context, the latter through the International Contemporary Art Network.
Reopening.
The new premises opened on 5 May 2007 and in their first year hosted a range of exhibitions, installations, performances, musical events, films and multimedia experiences which quickly established MAMbo's reputation as a leading experimental museum in Italy and one of Europe's foremost creative centres of contemporary art. MAMbo is a leading partner in the Didart art teaching project supported by the EU Culture Programme.

Jerusalem bulldozer attack

The Jerusalem bulldozer attack occurred on July 2, 2008, when an Arab resident of east Jerusalem identified as Hussam Taysir Duwait (also referred to as Hussam Duwiyat, Hossam Dawyyat, or erroneously as Jabr Duwait), attacked several cars on Jaffa Road in Jerusalem using a front-end loader (erroneously referred to as a bulldozer in the media), killing three people and wounding at least thirty other pedestrians, before being shot to death. Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said that an inquiry indicated the attacker had been acting alone. A motive for the attack could not immediately be determined, but police at the scene referred to the incident as a terrorist attack. Three copycat attacks have occurred since then.
This attack was the second incident in 2008 in which an Israeli Arab committed a violent act in west Jerusalem while carrying an Israeli ID Card (allowing for freedom of movement and travel throughout Israel), the first being the Mercaz HaRav massacre in early March 2008. On 7 April 2009, Duwait's house was demolished as a declared deterrent against future attacks, the first such demolition since 2005.
The attack.
Preliminary investigations suggest the Caterpillar 966 front-end loader was taken from a nearby construction site on Jaffa Road. The perpetrator then drove the vehicle against traffic, before hitting an Egged public bus near the city's old Central Bus Station. The impact flipped the bus onto its side, hitting nearby vehicles and pedestrians. The perpetrator, Hussam Taysir Duwait, was also heard yelling "Allahu Akbar" during the attack. After a traffic policewoman had shot the driver, the vehicle came to a halt but then started again and crushed another car, killing another person.
At the point when the vehicle had stopped for the first time, three men had climbed up to the cabin: A 20-year old off-duty soldier from Jerusalem, Moshe Plesser, who had recently enlisted at the Israel Defense Forces, an unnamed policeman, and Oron Ben Shimon, an armed civilian and manager of a regional security firm. According to Oron, while he was struggling with the driver inside the cabin, trying to get his feet off the accelerator and take over the wheel, he shouted at the soldier to shoot the driver. The soldier then grabbed Oron's handgun and killed Duwait with three shots to the head at point blank range. After the vehicle had immediately come to a halt again, motorcycle policeman Eli Mizrahi climbed the cabin and fired two more shots.
Haaretz quotes the soldier as saying that "I got closer to the bulldozer, the whole time looking for my weapon to shoot him." Coincidentally, the soldier is the brother-in-law of Captain David Shapira, the paratrooper officer who shot and killed the perpetrator in the Mercaz HaRav massacre.
The moments during which the perpetrator was shot and killed have been filmed from at least two different angles, which accounts for the greater level of directly available descriptive detail in comparison to the original attack which is documented only through eyewitnesses on the scene as well as images that were taken mostly after the incident itself.
One witness is quoted as saying that Duwait was armed and 'shooting at a police officer'.
The perpetrator.
Duwait, a 32-year-old father of two from the East Jerusalem neighbourhood of Sur Baher, was carrying an Israeli identity card, and was hired by a local construction firm for the Jerusalem Light Rail.
Three Palestinian organizations took responsibility for the attack: the Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, the Galilee Freedom Battalion (), and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Despite the Palestinian claims of responsibility, Israeli police chief Dudi Cohen said the attacker appeared to be acting alone and that "it looks as if it was a spontaneous act." Some two hours after the attack, a Hamas spokesman said that the attack is "a natural response to Israeli aggression." Nevertheless, he stressed that Hamas did not know who was behind the attack.
Shimon Kokos, the lawyer of the perpetrator's family, said that Hussam "had not belonged to any militant organization and may have acted out of temporary insanity" and that, "had not been killed during his rampage, it is doubtful whether he would have been judged fit to stand trial." "My son never spoke of plans to carry out such an attack, if he had I would have tried to prevent it," Duwait's father, Tayseer told The Media Line as police officers were about to question him.
A Jewish ex-girlfriend of Duwait, commented that "he really didn't hate Jews. The fact is that he was with me. It's insanity, but the motivation was not nationalist" and also that his bad temper may have been related to his "a lot of drugs." Other people have gone on the record as well alleging regular drug abuse by Duwait, one neighbour saying that he was "a drug addict [... He'd shoot up all the time. [...] He was really just a junkie."
Aftermath.
Israeli Border Guard officers ordered the Duwait family to remove the mourning tent they erected in the neighborhood for their son. A Border Guard patrol passing through the area identified the construction of the tent and ordered the family to remove it. The family then disassembled the tent without any noted resistance. Two days after the attack, defense minister Ehud Barak ordered the demolition of Duwait's and Alaa Abu Dhein's (perpetrator of the Mercaz HaRav massacre) houses, as a stated deterrent against future attacks. Following the supreme court rejection of appeals by Duwait's family, his home was razed on 7 April 2009, the first such demolition since a military commission recommended against such action in 2005. During the demolition, police shot dead a Palestinian motorist who ran over and injured three police officers.
Bulldozer attack of July 22.
On July 22, another east Jerusalem Arab resident, Ghassan Abu Tir, rammed his bulldozer (this time it was a smaller backhoe loader) into cars and a bus on King David street in Jerusalem. He wounded 24 people, including one whose leg was partially severed. He was subsequently killed by a fusillade of gunfire from a Border Policeman and an armed pedestrian. The attack was seen as a copycat act of to the July 2 attack, causing fears of repeated copycat acts in an emerging new terrorist tactic. The attack happened just down the road from the hotel where Democratic Presidential nominee Barack Obama was due to stay as part of a multi-country visit.
BMW attack.
On September 22, 2008, Qassem Mughrabi, a resident of East Jerusalem, drove a black BMW into a group of off-duty soldiers standing on a Jerusalem street injuring 19. Mughrabi was subsequently shot dead by one of the soldiers. Police spokesmen asserted the event was a terrorist attack, not an accident.
5 March 2009 attack.
Two police officers were lightly wounded in Jerusalem when an Arab bulldozer driver overturned their police car and rammed it into a bus, before being fatally shot by police and an armed taxi driver. The attack occurred around 1 P.M. near the Malha shopping mall, on Menachem Begin Boulevard in southern Jerusalem. Police said that a copy of the Koran had been found in the bulldozer after the attack, and that the driver had not been carrying any identification. Israel Police and local residents later identified the man as Marei Radaydeh, a West Bank construction worker in his mid-20s who lived with his family in the east Jerusalem neighborhood of Beit Hanina. Radaydeh was married and had a daughter. Hamas praised the attack, calling it a "natural response" to Israel's demolition of Palestinian homes in Arab East Jerusalem and to Israel's military operations in the Gaza Strip.

Postnationalism

Postnationalism describes the process or trend by which nation states and national identities lose their importance relative to supranational and global entities. Although postnationalism is not strictly the antonym of nationalism, the two terms and their associated assumptions are antithetic.
There are several factors that contribute to aspects of postnationalism, including economic, political, and cultural elements.
Increasing globalization of "economic" factors, such as the expansion of international trade with raw materials, manufactured goods, and services, and the importance of multinational corporations and internationalization of financial markets, have shifted emphasis from national economies to global ones. At the same time, political power is partially transferred from national authorities to supernational entities, such as the United Nations, the European Union, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), or NATO. In addition, media and entertainment industries are becoming increasingly global and facilitate the formation of trends and opinions on a supranational scale. Migration of individuals or groups between countries contributes to the formation of postnational identities and beliefs, even though attachment to citizenship and national identities often remains important.
Postnationalism and human rights.
In the scholarly literature, postnationalism is linked to the expansion of international human rights law and norms. International human rights norms are reflected in a growing stress on the rights of individuals in terms of their "personhood," not just their citizenship. International human rights law does not recognize the right of entry to any state by non-citizens, but demands that individuals should be judged increasingly on universal criteria not particularistic criteria (such as blood descent in ethnicity, or favoring a particular sex). This has impacted citizenship and immigration law, especially in western countries. Germany, for example, has felt pressure to, and has diluted (if not eradicated), citizenship based on ethnic descent, which had caused German-born Turks, for example, to be excluded from German citizenship. Scholars identified with this argument include Yasemin Soysal, David Jacobson, and Saskia Sassen.
In the European Union.
The European integration has created a system of supranational entities and is often discussed in relationship to the concept of postnationalism.
In the media.
Catherine Frost, professor of political science at McMaster University, argues that while the internet and online social relations forge social and political bonds across national borders, they do not have "the commitment or cohesiveness needed to underpin a demanding new mode of social and political relations".
In sports.
Postnational trends have been evident in professional sports. Simon Kuper called the 2008 European soccer championship (UEFA Euro 2008) "the first postnational" European Championship. He argues that during the tournament both for players and fans sportsmanship and enjoyment of the event were more important than national rivalries or even winning.

Malaysia–Vietnam border

Malaysia and Vietnam are two South-east Asian countries with maritime boundaries which meet in the Gulf of Thailand and South China Sea. The two countries have overlapping claims over the continental shelf in the Gulf of Thailand. Both countries have, however, come to an agreement to jointly exploit the natural resources in the disputed area pending resolution of the dispute over sovereignty.
In the South China Sea, Malaysia and Vietnam are involved in the multi-national claims over some of the Spratly Islands and adjacent waters.
The border and disputes.
Gulf of Thailand.
Both Malaysia and Vietnam have overlapping claims over the seabed in the Gulf of Thailand. There is currently no boundary agreement between the two countries.
The continental shelf claim limit of the two countries do not coincide because of the different maritime baselines each country uses to calculate the equidistant line. This has resulted in an area of overlapping claims. The Vietnamese continental shelf limit was proclaimed in 1971 by the then South Vietnamese government and was the equidistant line between the Malaysian and Vietnamese mainlands without taking into account offshore islands. Malaysia's claim is made through a territorial sea and continental shelf map published by its Mapping and Survey Department in 1979 showing the boundary, drawn as the equidistant line between Malaysia's Redang Island and the Vietnamese shore, ignoring islands off its coast.
The eastern terminus of any future Malaysia–Vietnam border seems to have been established at northern terminus of the 1969 Indonesia-Malaysia continental shelf border at a point designated as Point 20, with the coordinates 6° 05.8' N 105° 49.2' E. Point 20 is the equidistant point from the baselines of Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam. Although not determined by any tripartite agreement, bilateral agreements governing the Indonesia-Malaysia and Indonesia-Vietnam maritime borders as well as the agreement to establish the Malaysia-Vietnam joint development Defined Area (see below) virtually set Point 20 as the common tripoint for the three countries.
The western terminus of the Malaysia–Vietnam border, which should also be the common tripoint for Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, has not been determined as the borders between the three countries are subject to dispute. The determination of the tripoint would require the disputes involving the Malaysia-Thailand and Malaysia–Vietnam borders to be settled.
Interestingly, Thailand and Vietnam has agreed to a continental shelf boundary, with "Point C" as the eastern terminus of their common continental shelf border. This point (with coordinates 07° 48' 00" N, 103° 02' 30" E) coincides with Point 43 in the 1979 map produced by Malaysia's Mapping and Survey Department depicting the country's territorial sea and continental shelf claims. In Malaysia's perspective, Point 43/Point C would be the common tripoint for Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, and thus the westernmost terminus of the Malaysia-Vietnam common border. Thailand and Vietnam do not recognise this position as they does not recognise Malaysia's continental shelf boundary asserted in the 1979 map.
Both countries signed a memorandum of understanding on 5 June 1992 to allow joint exploitation of natural resources in the area of overlapping claims, which the agreement called the Defined Area. The western portion of the overlapping claim area is also claimed by Thailand and is currently included in the Malaysia-Thailand joint development area. The Defined Area established under the 1992 MOU does not include this area. In 1999, all three countries agreed in principle to jointly develop this area using joint development principles.
South China Sea.
Malaysia and Vietnam both have overlapping claims in the South China Sea involving the continental shelf as well as the islands of the Spratly group. Both Malaysia and Vietnam are two of several countries asserting claims over the islands and waters of the area. Because of the uncertainty, no maritime border agreement exists for the area.
Malaysian claim.
Malaysia claims a portion of the South China Sea together with 11 islands and other marine features in the Spratly group on the basis that they are within its continental shelf. Brunei, China, the Philippines and Vietnam also have overlapping claims over the entire or a portion of the area claimed by Malaysia.
Malaysia currently occupies one island - Swallow Reef or Pulau Layang-Layang - five reefs and one shoal. It also claims two marine features currently occupied by Vietnam, namely Amboyna Cay and Barque Canada Reef. Amboyna Cay is also claimed by the Philippines. Malaysia claims Commodore Reef which is occupied by the Philippines and Royal Charlotte Reef which is currently not occupied.
All the features claimed by Malaysia are also claimed by Vietnam and China (as well as Taiwan). Five features currently occupied by Malaysia are claimed by the Philippines and one is claimed by Brunei.
Vietnamese claim.
Vietnam claims the entire Spratly Islands group based on historic grounds, and as such, claims all 11 islands and other marine features occupied as well as claimed by Malaysia. It currently has possession of six islands, 17 reefs and three banks and of these, one island and a reef - Amboyna Cay and Barque Canada Reef/Lizzie Weber Reef - are claimed by Malaysia.
Other features claimed by Vietnam are currently occupied by China, the Philippines and Taiwan.
For details of the Spratly Islands dispute, see the Spratly Islands page.
Extended continental shelf claims.
Pursuant to Article 76 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, Malaysia and Vietnam on 6 May 2009 jointly submitted to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf a notification of the two countries' extended continental shelf claims. The "defined area" claimed in the joint submission covered a stretch of the South China Sea which lay in between the 200 nautical mile limit of the two countries. The area in question includes part of the Spratly Islands and its adjacent waters.
The joint submission stated that the area was already subject to overlapping claims, including by both the submitting countries. The submission did not define the extended continental shelf claim of each country but merely defined the area which both countries were jointly claiming. Nevertheless, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak said the two countries had reached a broad understanding as to the apportionment of the defined area. 
China, which is one of the claimants of the Spratly Islands and its adjacent waters, lodged a note with the UN Secretary-General on 7 May 2009 objecting to the extended continental shelf submission. The basis for the objection was that the area claimed was under Chinese sovereignty. Premier Wen Jiabao later said all countries with territorial claims in the South China Sea should strictly follow the Declaration on the Code of Conduct on the South China Sea.
Vietnam responded to China's note the following day, stating in a note that it had legal rights to claim the area defined in the joint submission. It also disputed China's claim over the area. Malaysia also responded with a note asserting its legal right to claim the area and stating that it recognised the overlapping claims by various countries over the area. During a state visit to China in June, Malaysian prime minister Najib Abdul Razak said China and Malaysia had reached an understanding and agreed to continue negotiations over all territorial disputes.
Another objection to the Malaysia-Vietnam joint submission was received from the Philippines on 4 August 2009. The note said the defined area was subject to a claim by the Philippines as well as subject to territorial disputes over "some of the islands in the area including North Borneo." In its reply on 18 August 2009, Vietnam stated its legal right to lodge the submission and reasserted its "indisputable sovereignty" over the Spratly and Paracel Islands. Malaysia's reply on 21 August 2009 also stated its legal right to lodge the submission and said there was an earlier invitation to the Philippines to join the joint submission which was ultimately rejected. Malaysia also rejected the Philippines' assertion of sovereignty claims over North Borneo, pointing to the separate judgement of Judge Ad Hoc Franck in the Sipadan and Ligitan Case of the International Court of Justice.
Presentation of the submission was made to the Commission on 27 August 2009 during its 24th session. The commission decided to defer any consideration on the submission to a future date.
Joint development area.
The overlapping claim area of the continental shelf was designated as a joint development area by the two countries where all fossil fuel resources in the area is shared between Malaysia and Vietnam. The joint development area was created through the "Memorandum of Understanding between Malaysia and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam for the Exploration and Exploitation of Petroleum in a Defined Area of the Continental Shelf involving the Two Countries" on 5 June 1992.
The defined area, which is also known as Block PM-3 CAA (Commercial Arrangement Area), is about 1,350 km square. Oil production began in 1997 from the Bunga Kekwa field.

Deborah Bonham

Deborah Bonham (born 7 February 1962) is an English rock and blues vocalist and the sister of John Bonham, the late drummer for the band Led Zeppelin. Born in Redditch, Worcestershire, England, she lived with her father in The Old Hyde farm, Cutnall Green, Worcestershire (the location where John Bonham's fantasy sequence was filmed for "The Song Remains the Same)." While living there, she started playing and recording music with her nephew Jason Bonham who has played drums on her two most recent studio releases.
Life and career.
When Led Zeppelin was formed in 1968, Deborah was six years old. While living on the family's Old Hyde estate, Deborah and John's son Jason started playing and recording their own songs. At the age of 17, at Robert Plant's house in a nearby village, she recorded her first demos. With some encouragement and advice from mentor Plant, Bonham sent out the songs anonymously and soon landed her first record deal with the major European label Carerre Records in 1985, for whom she recorded the critically acclaimed album "For You and the Moon". The album reached the top 5 in the "NME" chart, was DJ Simon Bates record of the week on BBC Radio 1 and sold well in Europe, being voted "Record of the Year" by Musik Mart magazine, in Germany.
A period of recording for the Japanese Sam Corporation followed, with press and radio promotion including interviews for music publication "Burrn!" and J-Wave FM Radio. After this, English label RPM records released the CD single, "Perfect World" in 1995. Bonham spent 1996 organising a new band, together with new songs for an album and playing a series of shows such as headlining the Belfast Festival and a sell out show at the Bottom Line, in Shepherd's Bush. The beginning of 1997 saw the first of many trips to the United States. She performed live on Los Angeles's Rockline syndicated radio show to three million listeners throughout North America. This was followed by a special appearance with Jason Bonham and his band at the Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles. Her band also opened for Jason Bonham Band's shows in Los Angeles House of Blues with guests Slash and Terry Reid, and subsequent other House of Blues appearances. Bonham also played at festivals including Glastonbury and Fairport's Cropredy Convention.
In 2004, she recorded her second album on the Track label and toured in support of it. Neither of these first two albums were released in the United States. In June 2008, her third album "Duchess" was issued on ATCO by Rhino Records and released in the United States.

Sport in Lebanon

Because of Lebanon's unique geography, both summer and winter sports thrive in the country. In fact, during autumn and spring it is sometimes possible to engage in both activities on the same day; for example, skiing in the morning and swimming in the afternoon.
In 1959, Beirut hosted the third Mediterranean Games. Lebanon hosted the Asian Cup in 2000 and the Pan-Arab Games in 1957 and again in 1997. In December 2011, Lebanon gained acceptance to host the 13th Pan-Arab Games in 2015. Although the Asian Winter Games were under consideration to be held in Lebanon in 2009, they ultimately did not take place. However, Lebanon did host Les Jeux de la Francophonie in 2009.

The plan was to make the Beirut Formula One the only in-city Grand Prix outside Monaco. The plans never saw fruition. However, Lebanon entered the world of international motor sport in 2004 with the formation of the Lebanese A1 Grand Prix team that included driver Basil Shaaban, making Lebanon the first Arab nation to participate in the World Cup of Motorsport.
Athletics.
Jogging.
Jogging is a popular sport, especially in the capital along the Corniche Beirut, in the Horsh Beirut and the Shoreline Walk in Beirut Central District. Outside Beirut, jogging is practiced at the Marina Joseph Khoury in Dbayeh and along the corniches of Tripoli, Tyre and Sidon.

The Church of England parish church of Saint James the Great was a dependent chapelry of the parish of Cropredy until 1851. St. James' was originally Norman, built in about AD 1100. The arcade between the nave and north aisle survives from this date, as does the south doorway. Slightly later a chapel was added at the east end of the north aisle, linked by Early English Gothic arches to both the aisle and the chancel. There is also a squint from the chapel to the chancel. The bell tower was added in the 14th century, and the chancel was extended eastwards in either the 14th or the 15th century. The south porch is a late Mediaeval Perpendicular Gothic addition, and the ironwork on the south door was added in 1640.
In 1856 the Bishop of Oxford, Samuel Wilberforce, expressed dissatisfaction with the condition of the church building. In 1860 the Gothic Revival architect William White heavily restored the building, including renewal of the foundations. White almost completely rebuilt the north aisle, and so altered the chancel that its original date may not be determined with certainty.
The bell tower has three bells. Two were cast by a member or members of the Newcombe family of bell-founders: the second bell in 1609 and the treble in 1611. At that time the Newcombes had foundries at Bedford and Leicester. The tenor bell was cast in 1756 and Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry recast it in 1910. For technical reasons the bells are currently unringable. The church has also an early clock of an unusual design. The date of its manufacture is unknown, but its style suggests that it dates from the 17th century.
St. James' parish is now part of the Benefice of Shire's Edge along with those of Cropredy, Great Bourton, Mollington and Wardington.
Methodist.
A Primitive Methodist congregation developed in Claydon from 1835 and built a chapel in 1846. By 1969 it no longer had its own minister and was served by visiting clergy in the Banbury Methodist Circuit. The chapel has since closed and has been converted into a garage for the house next door.
Economic and social history.
The clockmakers Samuel Knibb (1625–70), Joseph Knibb (1640–1711) and John Knibb (1650–1722) were born at Claydon. Joseph and John were brothers and Samuel was a cousin. Samuel traded in Newport Pagnell from about 1655 to 1663, when he moved to London and went into a partnership making instruments as well as clocks. Joseph traded in Oxford from about 1663, but when Samuel died in 1670 Joseph moved to London and took over his business. John joined Joseph in Oxford in about 1664, took over their Oxford business when Joseph moved to London in 1670 and was Mayor of Oxford in 1697 and 1710. On 26 September 2010 the Oxfordshire Blue Plaques Board unveiled a blue plaque at Claydon to Samuel, Joseph and John Knibb.
Historic houses in Claydon include Manor Farm built in 1720 and Claydon House built in 1852. In 1867 the vicar, Rev. G.W. Palmer, bought Claydon House to be the vicarage and had it altered by the architect Edwin Dolby. In 1958 Claydon House was sold and returned to being a private house.
Between 1753 and 1763 Claydon had three public houses. By 1781 this had fallen to two, and from 1841 the number of pubs in the village fluctuated between one and two until the latter part of the 20th century. The New Inn had closed by 1969 and the Sunrising Inn closed January 1990.
Construction of the Oxford Canal began north of Coventry in 1769. In May 1776 it reached Fenny Compton in Warwickshire, northwest of Claydon. and by November 1777 the canal had been extended to Cropredy in Oxfordshire, passing through Claydon parish by skirting the north and east sides of the hill on which Claydon stands. On the east side of the hill the canal's engineer Samuel Simcock built Claydon Locks, a flight of five locks that begins the canal's southward descent from its 11-mile long summit pound. Between them the five locks achieve a total rise ("i.e." change in water level) of .
An open field system of farming prevailed in the parish until 1776 when an Act of Parliament enclosed the common lands of the parish.
In 1852 the Great Western Railway extended its Oxford and Rugby Railway through the western edge of Claydon parish to a new railway station at . In 1872–73 the East and West Junction Railway built a line from its Fenny Compton West railway station to through glebe land in the north of Claydon parish. Claydon's nearest station was to the south at , until British Railways closed it in 1956.
Claydon and Clattercote School Board was established in 1875 and opened Claydon village school in 1877. The school closed in 1948.
In 1932 the hamlet of Clattercote, south of Claydon, was added to the civil parish to form the present parish of Claydon with Clattercote.

Jimmy Thompson (actor)

James Edward ""Jimmy"" Thompson (30 October 1925 – 21 April 2005) was an English actor, writer and director.
He was born in Halifax, West Riding of Yorkshire and educated at St. Peter’s School in York. As a young man he began his career in repertory theatre in Yorkshire and he toured with a theatrical company headed by Jean Forbes-Robertson.
After his national service, he moved to London, and his early appearances on the West End stage were in intimate revue.
In 1956, he became known for his impersonation of the American pianist and entertainer, Liberace, in the revue, For Amusement Only, at the Apollo Theatre. Thompson was called in the 1959 libel action brought by the pianist against the Daily Mirror, and was himself subsequently sued by Liberace. Thompson settled out of court, making a donation to an actors’ charity.
In 1959, he and his wife, Nina, co-authored a musical comedy, "The Quiz Kid", which was presented at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith. In 1964, he starred in Monsieur Blaise at the Royal Court and Phoenix theatres, a play adapted by his wife from the Claude Magnier farce. In 1974, Thompson starred in "The Englishman Amused" at the Young Vic, a production which again he co-wrote with his wife. In 1992, he was once more in revue, appearing at the Whitehall Theatre in "Spread a Little Happiness", the Vivian Ellis musical.
In the 1960s, Thompson appeared regularly in the BBC television programme, Pinky and Perky, created by Jan and Vlasta Dalibor. In 1967, he starred in the title role in the first BBC2 play in colour, Lieutenant Tenant. Other television appearances included "The Benny Hill Show" (1970) and George and Mildred (1978).
His film appearances included "Carry On Regardless" (1961), "Carry On Cruising" (1962) and "Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines" (1965).
His directorial credits included directing Simon Ward in Perchance to Dream, Patrick Cargill in Don’t Misunderstand Me, Mollie Sugden in My Giddy Aunt, Windsor Davies in My Wife Whatsername, Peggy Mount in Blithe Spirit, and the original production of Jeeves Takes Charge with Edward Duke.
After the death of his wife in 1999, he retired to York where he died in 2005.

<doc id="18244767" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18244767" title="Circlotron">
Circlotron

Circlotron valve amplifier is a type of power amplifier utilizing symmetrical cathode-coupled bridge layout of the output stage. Original circlotrons of 1950s used output transformers to couple relatively high output impedance of vacuum tubes to low-impedance loudspeakers. Circlotron architecture, easily scalable, was eventually adapted to operate without output transformers, and present-day commercially produced circlotron models are of output transformerless (OTL) type.
History.
"Circlotron" name emerged as a trademark of Electro-Voice. A U.S. patent for a circlotron "High Fidelity Audio Amplifier" was filed by Alpha Wiggins of Electro-Voice on March 1, 1954 and granted March 28, 1958. However, other inventors filed the same concept earlier:
All these patents called for a transformer-coupled, fully balanced design; commercial transformerless amplifiers were not feasible at this time due to high costs of power supply capacitors required for an OTL design (at least thousands of microfarads at 200 volts or better). In 1950s and 1960s circlotrons were produced by Electro-Voice (8 models, 15 to 100 watts per channel), Finnish Voima and Philips. These inspired other local manufacturers, such as Carad. All these models employed output transformers and beam tetrode or pentode tubes (for increased efficiency). Similar amateur designs were published in the USSR.
The concept was resurrected in its transformerless form in early 1980s by Ralph Karsten, founder of Atma-Sphere which remains the principal contemporary manufacturer of circlotrons. Other OTL circlotrons were made by Tenor Audio, Joule Electra and Einstein.
Basic transformerless schematic.
The electrical bridge of a circlotron is formed by a matched pair of triodes (V1, V2) and two floating power supplies ('B batteries'), B1+ and B2+. Grids of each triode are driven in opposite phases with a balanced, symmetrical input signal; differential current flows through the loudspeaker load and a simple, relatively high impedance, resistor network that ties floating supplies to the ground. Tubes are usually fixed biased with an external negative power supply ('C battery'); each side normally has independent bias adjustment to compensate for minor tube mismatch.
Output impedance "Z" of a transformerless circlotron where each stage is a single triode with plate impedance of "Rp" and voltage gain of "μ" is defined by the formula
The tubes best fitting the circlotron concept are triodes designed for use in power supplies as series regulators: 6080/6AS7, 6C33C, 6C19P. An amplifier with one 6AS7 dual triode per channel ("Rp" = 270 ohms, "μ" = 2) will have a "Z" of about 67 ohms—sufficient to drive most headphones. Driving loudspeakers requires paralleling output tubes, and in practice, V1 and V2 are not single triodes, but massive banks of paralleled triodes. Simple OTL amplifiers, for example Atma-Sphere M-60, employ 8 double triodes of 6AS7 type per channel; each continuously dissipates an average of 30 watts. Without feedback, this arrangement results in an output impedance of 6–8 ohms. It can be further lowered by applying global negative feedback or paralleling more output tubes. On the extreme end, Atma-Sphere MA-2 amplifier uses 20 6AS7 tubes per channel, with a continuous power consumption of 600 watts per channel (800 watts at maximum rated output of 220 watts, or a 27% maximum efficiency).
Benefits and drawbacks.
Perceived fidelity (quality) of audio reproduction is a hardly quantifiable, subjective measure that should be left to each individual listener's taste. Apart from audio fidelity, circlotron OTL have certain benefits versus asymmetrical OTLs (i.e. Futterman amplifier) and conventional, transformer-coupled amplifiers:
These benefits are at the cost of high power consumption and concomitant heat generation: minimal stereo power amplifier (Atma-Sphere S-30) continuously dissipates 400 watts, while practical low-impedance stereo setups approach 1 kilowatt, the power of a small electric heater.
Circlotrons, unlike minimalistic single-ended amplifiers, need to employ quite complex balanced input and driver stages delivering at least 100V peak-to-peak voltage "and" able to drive relatively high capacitance loads (due to the number of paralleled power triodes and associated long wiring). The first requirement is typically solved with a long-tailed cascode stage (2 or 3 double triodes), the second - with two cathode followers inserted between the driver stage and the power stage. Both need a bipolar power supply, independent of the power stage power supplies, with power established before the power stage supply starts.

Dawkins vs. Gould

Dawkins vs. Gould: Survival of the Fittest is a book by philosopher of biology Kim Sterelny about the differing views of biologists Richard Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould. When first published in 2001 it became an international bestseller. A new edition was published in 2007 to include Gould's "The Structure of Evolutionary Theory" finished shortly before his death in 2002, and more recent works by Dawkins. The synopsis below is from the 2007 publication.
Synopsis.
Part I—Battle Joined.
In the introductory chapter the author points out that there have been many conflicts in biology. Still, few have been as public or as polemical as the one between Dawkins and Gould. Dawkins sees evolution as a competition between gene lineages, where organisms are vehicles for those genes. Gould, a paleontologist in the tradition of George Gaylord Simpson, has a different perspective. For example, he sees chance as very important, and views organisms as being more important than genes. Their broader world views also differ, for instance they have very different beliefs about the relationship between religion and science.
Part II—Dawkins' World.
This begins with a discussion on genes and gene lineages (chapter 2). Dawkins' view on the nature of evolution, as outlined in "The Selfish Gene", has genes as the units of selection, both in the first replicators and in more complex organisms, where alliances of genes are formed (and sometimes broken). He then discusses in chapter 3, Dawkins' view of heritability, with genes as difference makers that satisfy replicator principles and have phenotypic power, increasing the likelihood of phenotypic expression, depending on environmental context. In chapter 4, he discusses aspects of genomes and genetic replication, using various examples. He notes that in a story about magpie aggression, "Dawkins' story will be about genes and vehicles", whereas Gould and others will describe it in terms of phenotypic fitness. (p. 39) He discusses ways in which genes "lever their way into the next generation", including genes that are loners, or 'Outlaws', and which promote their own replication at the expense of other genes in their organism's genome. He then discusses the role of extended phenotypes, in which genotypes that influence their environment further increase the likelihood of replication (chapter 4). Chapter 5 explores selfish genes and the selection within the animal kingdom of cooperation as opposed to altruism, levels of selection, and the evolution of evolvability itself. Sterelny notes that on the issue of high-level selection, "Dawkins and Gould are less sharp than they once were." (p. 65)
In chapter 6, Sterelny notes that "despite the heat of some recent rhetoric, the same is true of the role of selection in generating evolutionary change", (p. 67) and naive adaptationism. "Everyone accepts that many characteristics of organisms are not the direct result of selection", as in the example of redness of blood, which is a by-product of its oxygen-carrying properties. (p. 70) Numerous general truths are uncontroversial "though their application to particular cases may be. Nor is there disagreement between Gould and Dawkins on core cases", such as echolocation in bats, which "everyone agrees is an adaptation". (p. 71) They do however differ on the relative role of selection and variation. For example, they have different emphases on development. Developmental constraints are fundamental to Gould's approach. Dawkins gives this less weight, and has been more interested in enhanced possibilities open to lineages as a result of developmental revolutions. For example, the evolution of segmentation increases variation possibilities. He discusses this in "Climbing Mount Improbable", and "returns to similar themes at the end of "The Ancestor's Tale": major transitions in evolution are developmental transitions, transitions that make new variants possible, and hence new adaptive complexes possible". (pp. 77–78)
"Gould, on the other hand, is inclined to bet that the array of possibilities open to a lineage is tightly restricted, often to minor variants of its current state." (p. 78) Gould sees morphological stability as "probably explained by constraints on the supply of variation to selection". (p. 78) But whereas in his earlier work Gould considered variation supply as a brake on evolutionary change, in "The Structure of Evolutionary Theory" he carefully notes that it can also enhance possibilities for change. "So while both Dawkins and Gould recognise the central role of developmental biology in an explanation of evolutionary change, they make different bets as to what the role will be. Gould but not Dawkins thinks that one of these roles is as a brake", damping down change possibilities. (p. 78) Another difference is Dawkins conception of evolutionary biology's central problem as the explanation of adaptive complexity, whereas Gould has largely focused on the existence of large-scale patterns in the history of life that are not explained by natural selection. "A further disagreement concerns the existence and importance of these patterns", (p. 79) which leads on to Part III.
Part III—The View from Harvard.
In discussing Gould's perspective, Sterelny begins with two fundamental distinctions that Gould saw between his viewpoint and that of the Dawkins camp. Firstly, Gould thought that gene selectionists misrepresent the role of genes in microevolution, ascribing a causal role in evolution, rather than by-product record of evolutionary change. Moreover, evolutionary biologists have often neglected non-selective possibilities when formulating hypotheses about microevolutionary change. For example, contemporary sex differences in human males and females need not be adaptations, but could be evolutionary vestiges of a greater sexual dimorphism in ancestral species.
But Gould's main target is 'extrapolationism', concerning the relationship between evolutionary processes occurring within species and those of large-scale life histories. In this view, the evolution of species lineages is an aggregate of events at the local population scale, with major changes being the additive result of minor changes over successive generations. While not disputing the relevance of this, Gould argued that it is not the whole truth. "Indeed, it is not much of an exaggeration to say that Gould's professional life has been one long campaign against the idea that this history of life is nothing but the long, long accumulation of local events." (p. 86) Sterelny offers four highlights to illustrate this.
Firstly, punctuated equilibrium, in which new species arise by a split in a parental species, followed by geologically rapid speciation of one or both of the fragments. A period of stasis then occurs until the species either becomes extinct or splits again. Gould argued that punctuated equilibrium challenges the gradual change expected by extrapolationists. In the case of Hominid evolution, there is the evolutionary trend of marked increase in brain size. To Gould, this trend was the result of species sorting, in which species with relatively larger brains were more likely to appear, or to survive.
Secondly, in his Natural History writings, Gould often argued that the history of life was profoundly affected by mass extinctions caused by environmental catastrophes such as an asteroid impact causing the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, which wiped out pterosaurs, large marine reptiles and non-avian dinosaurs 66 million years ago. Such a mass extinction would be sudden at not just the larger geological time-scale, but also the more ephemeral ecological one. "The properties that are visible to selection and evolution in local populations—the extent to which an organism is suited to life here and now" become irrelevant to survival prospects in mass extinction times. "Survival or extinction in mass extinction episodes determines the large-scale shape of the tree of life". Massive culling of synapsids at the end of the Permian "gave the dinosaurs their chance. The death of the dinosaurs opened the door for the radiation of mammals." (p. 89)
Thirdly, in "Wonderful Life", Gould describes the Burgess Shale fauna, which is known in detail due to fortuitous preservation of both hard and soft tissue around 505 million years ago. Gould argues that the Burgess Shale fauna demonstrate both diversity of species and disparity of body plans. He accepts that diversity has probably increased over the last few million years, but argues that disparity of animal life peaked early in evolutionary history, with very little disparity generated since the Cambrian, and profound conservatism in surviving lineages. For example, despite diversity in beetle species their body plans follow the same general pattern. He argues that survival has been contingent, and that if the tape of life was replayed from the earliest Cambrian, with small alterations in the initial conditions, a different set of survivors may have evolved.
Fourth, in "", "Gould argues that evolutionary trends are not the scaled-up consequences of competitive interactions among organisms." (p. 90) For example, morphological changes in horses are not the cumulative result of the competitive success of horses better adapted to grazing. "Rather, Gould argues that this trend is really a change in the spread of variation within the horse lineage", which used to be species rich with a wide range of lifestyles and sizes. "But only a very few species survived, and those few happen to be largish horses. The average horse is larger now only because almost all horse species went extinct, and the few survivors happened to be somewhat atypical", and there is no evolutionary 'trend' towards increased size. (p. 91) Similarly with complexity. While complexity has increased over time, it is misleading to see this simply as a trend towards increased complexity, from simple organisms such as bacteria to complex organisms such as us. Rather, the distance from the least to the most complex living organism has increased. "The real phenomenon to be explained is this increase in variation rather than an upward trend in average complexity. There is, Gould argues, no such trend." (p. 92)
Sterelny notes two issues arising from consideration of Gould's case against extrapolationism. "Are the patterns in life's history that he claims to detect real? And do these patterns really show the existence of evolutionary mechanisms other than those operating at the scale of local populations?" (p. 92)
Sterelny then outlines in chapter 8 Gould and Eldredge's punctuated equilibrium hypothesis. They argued that the appearance of stability in species evolution is not a mere effect of the gappiness and imperfection of the fossil record. Rather, it is the result of discontinuous tempos of change in the process of speciation and the deployment of species in geological time.
Sterelny notes that this hypothesis has been misunderstood in two important ways. First, in some early discussions of the idea, the contrast between geological and ecological time was blurred, with Gould and Eldredge interpreted as claiming that species originate more or less overnight in a single step. However, Gould and Eldredge were referring to geological time, in which speciation taking 50,000 years would seem instantaneous relative to a species existence over millions of years. A second misunderstanding relates to further evolutionary change following speciation. They are not claiming that there is no generational change at all. "Lineages do change. But the change between generations does not accumulate. Instead, over time, the species wobbles about its phenotypic mean. Jonathan Weiner's The Beak of the Finch describes this very process." (p. 96) Sterelny notes that despite the fact that the fossil record represents, for several reasons, a biased sample, "the consensus seems to be shifting Gould's way: the punctuated equilibrium pattern is common, perhaps even predominant". Yet even if stasis is common "why suppose that this is bad news for the extrapolationist orthodoxy?" (p. 97) He notes that "the problem is not stasis but speciation. How can events in a local population generate a new species?" (p. 98) In discussing this issue, he notes "any solution to the speciation problem will take us beyond events in local populations observable on human timescales", and "it is likely that whatever explains the occasional transformation of a population into a species will rely on large-scale but rare climatic, biological, geographic or geological events; events which isolate populations until local change is entrenched". (p. 99) He notes that speciation is not just the accumulation of events in a local population, but dependent on the population's embeddedness into a larger whole. "There is a break with a strong version of extrapolationism, but it is not a radical break. Dawkins could, should, and probably would accept it; in "The Ancestor's Tale", he has an inclusive view of speciation mechanisms." (p. 100) Thus, while "Gould somewhat overstates the adherence of orthodoxy to strict extrapolationism", punctuated equilibrium is more important than some of the more "ungenerous treatment" that has been meted out. (pp. 100–101)
In chapter 9, Sterelny discusses mass extinction, and notes Gould's hypothesis that mass extinctions are more frequent, rapid, intense and different in their effects than has been supposed. (p. 108) Moreover, Gould argues that during such extinctions, there are evolutionary principles that would enable the prediction of winners and losers. "The game has rules. But they are different rules from those of normal times ... Species survival is not random, but the properties on which survival depends are not adaptations to the danger mass extinction threatens. If a meteor impact caused a nuclear winter, then the ability to lie dormant would have improved your chances. But dormancy is not an adaptation to the danger of meteor impacts." (p. 110) Similarly, "species with broad geographical ranges, species with broad habitat tolerances, species whose lifecycle does not tie them too closely to a particular type of community all would have had a better chance of making it", (p. 110) and this amounts to species selection. However as Gould concedes, there are no well-worked-out case studies. "In short, Gould's case for the importance of mass extinction depends on the view that there is a qualitative difference between mass extinction and background extinction, and that major groups have disappeared that would otherwise have survived". (p. 113) A plausible but difficult to prove claim, as is the claim that mass extinction regimes are species selection regimes.
In chapter 10, Sterelny discusses the fossil evidence of Cambrian fauna, and how this provides the basis for Gould's challenge to gradualistic orthodoxy. About 543 million years ago, at the base of the Cambrian, the Ediacaran fauna, characterised by small shelly fossils, fossilised tracks, and burrows, apparently disappeared. From available evidence, diversity of fauna was very limited at the beginning of the Cambrian Period. "By the middle of the Cambrian, about 520 million years ago, animal life was rich and diverse", (p. 116) as demonstrated by the Maotianshan Shales fossils, in Chengjiang, China, which "are as spectacular as the Burgess Shale fauna, and significantly older." (p. 116) "Thus the fossil record seems to show that most of the major animal groups appeared simultaneously. In the 'Cambrian explosion', we find segmented worms, velvet worms, starfish and their allies, molluscs (bivalves, snails, squid and their relatives), sponges, brachiopods and other shelled animals appearing all at once, with their basic organisation, organ systems and sensory mechanisms already operational." (p. 116) "This explosive evolutionary radiation of the Cambrian seems to be unique. Plants seem to have arisen somewhat more gradually ... nor was there a similar radiation when animals invaded the land ... the colonisation of the land saw no new ways of making an animal." (p. 117) Despite adaptations, the basic body plans remain recognisable. One possibility is that the 'Cambrian explosion' is "an illusion generated by the failure of earlier Precambrian fossils to survive to our times," (p. 117) that there is a long history of hidden evolution preceding the appearance of multi-celled animals in the fossil record. "This remains a live option. There are fossil embryos of animals from China dating to about 570 million years ago", (p. 120) and there are many animal lineages for which there is no fossil record, possibly due to being small and soft-bodied, so leaving no detectable traces. Certainly Precambrian animal life is evidenced by the Ediacaran fossils, but the relationship between fauna from these two periods remains unclear. Gould was inclined to support the view that the Ediacaran fauna became wholly extinct prior to the Cambrian, thus were not Cambrian ancestors, "hence their existence does not extend the timeframe of animal evolution into the Precambrian". (p. 120)
However, the development of methods of calibrating rates of change in DNA sequences has given the ability to estimate the last common ancestor of various lineages. It also allows the obtaining of molecular clock dates for lineages without a fossil record, which shows that zero-fossil phyla are also ancient. Such information comes with important caveats in relation to methodology, including the underlying assumptions of each method. "However, even the youngest dates from molecular clocks place the origins of the deepest branches in the tree of animal life—where the sponges and jellyfish branch off from the other early animals—over 600 million years ago, and so quite deep in the Precambrian." (p. 125) Gould accepted this, but noted that this does not negate the Cambrian Explosion. Molecular clocks date origins, while fossils date geographical spread and morphology. Molecular clock data cannot decide between gradual morphological change and rapid evolutionary bursts after initial species divergence. "Moreover, Gould argues that the fossil record supports the model in which the lineage splits much earlier than the distinctive morphologies evolve. For that explains why we find no Precambrian proto-arthropod fossils. In short, the 'hidden history' hypothesis remains an open option, but so does Gould's guess that the Cambrian explosion was genuinely explosive rather than an illusion generated by incomplete preservation." (pp. 125–126)
Of relevance to the explosive radiation hypothesis are the findings from the Cambrian sites: the Burgess (~505 myr), the Chengjiang (~522 myr), and the Sirius Passet formation in Greenland, which is dated at about 518 million years Before Present. Sterelny describes the distinction between disparity and diversity, and then explores Gould's claim that since the Cambrian, diversity has increased, but disparity has decreased. Since the Cambrian, not just species within phyla, but whole phyla themselves have become extinct. The major subdivisions of animal life are phyla, each of which is a distinctive way of building an animal. Gould's claim is that "the Cambrian phylum count was larger, maybe much larger, than the contemporary count. No new phyla have appeared, and many have gone. That count, in turn, is a reasonable measure of disparity. So Cambrian disparity was considerably larger than current disparity. The history of animal life is not a history of gradually increasing differentiation. It is a history of exuberant initial proliferation followed by much loss; perhaps sudden loss." (p. 129) Gould doubted that selection played much role in either the early burst of disparity, the post-Cambrian conservativeness of evolution, or the roster of loss and survival.
To Gould, there is a conservative pattern of history indicated by a reduction in disparity as measured by both the lack of new body plans and the lack of any major modifications of old ones. Given that evolution in general has not ceased in the past 500 million years, this poses a number of questions. However, Dawkins and more so his former student Mark Ridley think Gould's basic claim about history's pattern is incorrect. Central to Ridley's approach is cladistics, in which the purpose of biological systematics is to discover and represent genealogical relationships between species. Biological classifications are thus evolutionary genealogies, where only monophyletic groups (e.g. genera, families, orders, classes, phyla) are recognised and named. To cladists, similarity and dissimilarity are not objective features of the living world; they are products of human perceptions. Thus, whereas some morphological and physiological differences are more salient to us, and more striking or surprising, this is a fact about us, not the history of life. Conversely, genealogical reconstructions—who is related to whom—are objective facts independent of the observer's perception. Sterelny discusses how both cladists and Dawkins think that Gould overestimates Cambrian disparity, and he notes that while the distinction between disparity and diversity is very plausible, in the absence of a good account of the nature of disparity, and objective measures, "the existence of Gould's puzzling pattern remains conjectural". (p. 141)
Finally, in chapter 11, Sterelny discusses the "evolutionary escalator", or the tendency over time for life on earth to show a progressive increase both in complexity and adaptivity. While Gould does not outright reject this, he thinks it is a misleading way to think about the history of life. As above, with the example of horses, Gould argues that there has been no directional trend, but rather, a massive extinction in the horse lineage, with the surviving remnants happening to be largish grazers. So the appearance of a trend is generated by a reduction in heterogeneity. "A trend which is hostage to one switch between life and death is no trend at all." (p. 146) At the scale of complexity, the same applies. "What we think of as a progressive increase in complexity is a change in the difference between the least and the most complex organism. It is a change in the spread of complexity." (p. 146) Life starts in the simplest form that the constraints of chemistry and physics will allow, with bacteria probably close to that limit. "So life starts at the minimum level of complexity. Since even now nearly everything that is alive is a bacterium, for the most part life has stayed that way." (p. 146) But occasionally life builds a lineage that becomes more complex over time. There are no global evolutionary mechanisms that either prevent more complex organisms evolving from simpler ones, or that make it more likely to occur. Complexity tends to drift up because the point of life's origin is close to the physical lower bound. Such complex creatures are relatively less than bacteria, which still dominate life, but the difference between the simplest and most complex organisms tends to become greater over time. So the increased range is wholly undirected. Displayed as a frequency distribution curve or histogram, the shape would be skewed to the right (i.e. positively skewed), with the mode near the left. Over time, the range would increase as average complexity drifts upwards. But the mode would remain at left, with the curve spreading to the right, because there is a wall imposed by the laws of the physical sciences to the left, but not to the right.
To Gould, this upward drift in complexity is not the same as directional progress. 'Replaying the tape' of life's history would not guarantee the same outcomes, especially as mass extinction events make history utterly unpredictable. Conversely, Dawkins and Simon Conway Morris think that the course of evolutionary history is more predictable than does Gould. They argue that "convergent evolution is such a ubiquitous feature of evolution that the broad outline of evolution is highly predictable. Evolutionary pathways are constrained by both opportunity and possibility. There are not many ways of building working organisms, and so we can predict that evolution will move along this small set of pathways. Many of the most distinctive features of living systems have evolved more than once. Some of them (like eyes) have evolved many times." (p. 149) Also, Dawkins thinks that evolution is progressive, not in an anthropocentric sense, but because over time life is becoming better adapted, although not in every aspect, as when local conditions change and organisms must move or readapt. "There is no reason to suppose that there is any arrow of overall improvement here." (p. 150)
However, Dawkins thinks that relationships between organisms and their enemies, such as predator-prey, or parasite-host relationships, are locked into a permanent arms race, and such lineages generate progressive change. "Both predator and prey will become absolutely more efficient in hunting and avoiding hunters, though their relative success with respect to one another may not change at all over time." (p. 151) Thus progress is real though partial and intermittent. "Partial because it is generated only when selective regimes are both directional and stable: selecting for the same kind of phenotypic change over long periods, as in arms races ... intermittent because every arms race will ultimately be disrupted by large-scale environmental changes." (p. 151) However, while they were in progress, each lineage was objectively improving.
To Sterelny, Gould overstates his case, and "there is more to the history of life's complexity than a gradual increase in variance". (p. 151) He cites the 1995 work "The Major Transitions in Evolution" by John Maynard Smith and Eörs Szathmáry, in which life's history involves a series of major transitions and hence inherent directionality, with each transition facilitating possibilities for the evolution of more complex organisms. Dawkins pursues a similar, though less detailed, argument* in discussing the evolution of evolvability, in which a series of 'watershed events' make new life forms possible. These watersheds in evolvability comprise the evolution of sex, of multi-celled life together with a life cycle that takes large organisms through a single-celled reproduction stage, and the evolution of a modular mode of the development and construction of bodies. "Segmentation, for Dawkins, is a special case of modularity; of building a creature out of relatively discrete chunks. For once a chunk has been invented by evolution, it can be modified or redeployed without stuffing up the rest of the organism." (p. 152)
While Gould too is interested in evolvability, the crucial difference between Gould's view, and that of Maynard Smith, Szathmary and Dawkins, is in how they see the spread of complexity. To Gould, complexity drifts upward, having a lower boundary or wall to the left, "but no upper bound, and these features of complexity are fixed by biochemistry, not the course of evolutionary history". (p. 153) Maynard Smith and Szathmary consider that evolutionary history has had upper bounds, or walls to the right. For example, until eukaryotic life evolved, there was an upper bound of complexity set by the intrinsic limits on the size and structural complexity of prokaryotes, and for "perhaps 2 billion years, bacterial evolution was confined between these two limits." (p. 153) Similarly, until a series of evolutionary innovations facilitated the evolution of multi-celled organisms, eukaryotic complexity was set by the limits on a single eukaryotic cell. "Maynard Smith and Szathmary argue that social existence, too, has evolutionary preconditions. Until these are met, a wall remains to the right." (p. 153) Whereas to Gould, there are unchanging boundaries set by physics and chemistry, Maynard Smith, Szathmary and Dawkins view evolution as irreversibly transforming these boundaries. "The eukaryotic cell, sexual reproduction and cellular differentiation all change the nature of evolutionary possibility. These possibilities have changed over time in a direction that increases the maximum attainable complexity. In short, over time the rules of evolution change." (pp. 153–154) So evolvability has changed, with developmental mechanisms determining the variation available to selection. Gould claims that bacteria dominate every age, including this one.* They are the world's most numerous organisms, have the most disparate metabolic pathways, and may constitute most of the world's biomass. "All this is true and important", with Dawkins making similar observations.* "But it is not the whole truth. We live in an age in which many biological structures are now possible that were once not possible. That too is true, and important." (p. 153)
Part IV—The State of Play.
In Chapter 12, Sterelny notes that "Dawkins and his allies really do have a different conception of evolution from that embraced by Eldredge, Lewontin and other collaborators of Gould", but that this does not explain the undercurrent of hostility generated in the debate, as illustrated by a series of exchanges in the "New York Review of Books". But the issues pertain mostly to matters internal to evolutionary theory, and apart from banal psychological explanations pertaining to human reaction to public criticism, Sterelny thinks that at core is their different attitudes to science itself. To Dawkins, science is not just a light in the dark, but "by far our best, and perhaps our only, light." (p. 158) While not infallible, the natural sciences are society's one great engine for producing objective knowledge about the world, not just one knowledge system among many, and certainly not a socially constructed reflection of contemporary dominant ideology. Dawkins accepts that science cannot say what we should accept and reject, "but does not think of values as a special kind of fact that can be studied non-scientifically", notwithstanding that values are a kind of fact that anthropologists can and do study. "Least of all does he think religion has any special authority on values." (p. 158)
Gould's perspective is more ambiguous, in which some important questions are outside the scope of science, falling into the domain of religion. "On this issue, Dawkins' views are simple. He is an atheist. Theisms of all varieties are just bad ideas about how the world works, and science can prove that those ideas are bad. What is worse, as he sees it, these bad ideas have mostly had socially unfortunate consequences." (pp. 158–159) In contrast, Gould thought theism is irrelevant to religion. "He interprets religion as a system of moral belief. Its essential feature is that it makes moral claims on how we ought to live. In Gould's view, science is irrelevant to moral claims. Science and religion are concerned with independent domains." (p. 159) Sterelny considers Gould's views on religion "doubly strange". (p. 159) First, various religions make innumerable factual claims about the history of the world and how it works, and those claims are often the basis of moral injunctions. Second, Gould's conception of ethics seems strange. "Does he think that there are genuine ethical truths? Is there genuine moral knowledge?" (p. 159) Recent ethical thinking has two approaches to this question, with perhaps the main contemporary argument being the 'expressivist' view that moral claims express the speaker's attitude towards some act or individual. In this view "when, for instance, I call someone a scumbag, I do not describe a particular moral property of that person. Rather, I express my distaste for that person and their doings." (pp. 159–160) The main alternative is 'naturalism', in which moral claims are based on facts, albeit complex, about human welfare. Gould seems to deny both options. "If 'expressivism' is right, there is no independent domain of moral knowledge to which religion contributes", with moral utterances reflecting not objective features of the world, but attitudes and opinions of the speakers. Conversely, "if naturalism is right, science is central to morality. For it discovers conditions under which we prosper." (p. 159)
Gould thinks that there are important domains of human understanding where science has no role, and moreover he is skeptical about science's role within its 'proper' domain. Nevertheless, he rejects extreme versions of postmodern relativism. Evolution is an objective fact, containing objective facts, and those facts are not just aspects of a Western creation myth reflecting the dominant ideology, or an element of the current paleontological paradigm. "So "to some extent" Gould shares with Dawkins the view that science delivers objective knowledge about the world as it is." (p. 161) But while science reflects objective evidence and is not a mere socio-cultural construction "Gould argues that science is very deeply influenced by the cultural and social matrix in which it develops", (p. 161) with many of his writings illustrating the influence of social context on science, and its ultimate sensitivity to evidence. These writings "began as reflections on natural history; they ended as reflections on the history of natural history". (p. 161) Gould's Time's Arrow, Time's Cycle (first published in 1987) "locates the development of our conception of deep history in its cultural and intellectual context without any suggestion that that cultural context perverted the development of geology", whereas "in Wonderful Life, Gould argued that the Burgess Shale fauna were misunderstood because they were interpreted through the ideology of their discoverer". (p. 162) The Mismeasure of Man is Gould's most famous work on the themes of socio-cultural interests leading to bad science, pseudo-science, racist and sexist science, where "a particular ideological context led to a warped and distorted appreciation of the evidence on human difference". (p. 162)
Thus, "one sharp contrast between Dawkins and Gould is on the application of science in general, and evolutionary biology in particular, to our species". (p. 162) Yet paradoxically, Dawkins' most systematic writings on human evolution explore the differences between human evolution and that of most other organisms, in which humans pass on their values through ideas and skills which Dawkins calls memes. To Dawkins, ideas are often like pathogens or parasites, replicating throughout human populations, sometimes quite virulently, with evangelical religion being a salient example. Doubts about the reliability and accuracy of idea replication suggest Dawkins' own view of cultural evolution may not work. But his general approach has gained some popularity, as illustrated by works which explore the interaction between cultural and biological evolution, such as Peter Richerson and Robert Boyd's "Not By Genes Alone". as well as Eytan Avital and Eva Jablonka's" Animal Traditions". "So though Dawkins approaches human behaviour using different tools to those of standard sociobiologists and evolutionary psychologists, he is fully committed to the idea that we can understand ourselves only in an evolutionary framework." (pp. 164–165) This contrasts with Gould. While "Of course" he accepts that humans are an evolved species, "Everything that Gould does not like in contemporary evolutionary thinking comes together in human sociobiology and its descendant, evolutionary psychology. The result has been a twenty-year campaign of savage polemic against evolutionary theories of human behaviour. Gould "hates" sociobiology". And "It is true that some evolutionary psychology does seem simple-minded," such as Randy Thornhill's "unconvincing" attempt to argue that a tendency towards rape is an evolutionary adaptation. (p. 165) However, contemporary evolutionary psychologists, and especially biological anthropologists, have accepted the need for caution in testing adaptationist hypotheses. (p. 165) However, even the most disciplined sociobiological approaches reflect different approaches to evolution to that exemplified by Gould. They "tend not to emphasise the importance of development and history in imposing constraints on adaptation, the problems in translating microevolutionary change into species-level change, the role of contingency and mass extinction in reshaping evolving lineages, or the importance of paleobiology to evolutionary biology", (p. 166) which likely played a part in Gould's hostility. But Sterelny suspects more most of all, Gould thought "these ideas are dangerous and ill-motivated as well as wrong. They smack of hubris, of science moving beyond its proper domain, and incautiously at that". Conversely, to Dawkins, knowledge of evolutionary underpinnings to human behaviour is potentially liberating, and "might even help us to escape the poisoned chalice of religion". (p. 166)
Finally, in chapter 13, Sterelny summarises the fundamental contrasts between the views of Dawkins and Gould. In Dawkins' argument, selection acts on lineages of replicators, which are mostly but not exclusively genes. Ideas and skills are the replicators in animals capable of social learning, and "the earliest replicators were certainly not genes". (p. 167) Genetic competition occurs through vehicle-building alliances, with selection dependent on repeatable influences on those vehicles. Other genetic replication strategies include Outlaws, the prospects of which are enhanced at the expense of vehicle adaptiveness. And extended phenotype genes advantageously enhance their environment. The vehicles of Dawkins replicators need not be individuals, but can also be groups, although animal cooperation is not sufficient to claim group selection. Evolution's central explanatory imperative is the existence of complex adaptation, which can only be explained by natural selection. This complex adaptation evolves gradually, with occasional replication errors resulting in large but survivable phenotypic change. Humans are unusual species in that they are vehicles for memes as well as genes, although humans are not exempt from evolutionary biological explanations. Extrapolationism is a sound working theory, with most evolutionary patterns the result of microevolutionary change over vast geological time. Major animal lineages are the result of ordinary speciation processes, although possibility-expanding changes may result in some form of lineage-level selection.
In contrast, Gould sees selection as usually acting on organisms in a local population, although in theory and practice, it can occur at many levels, with change at one level often affecting future options at other levels. Selection can occur at the group level, with some species lineages having characteristics which make extinction less likely, or speciation more likely. And while rare, selection can occur on genes within an organism. While selection is important, and requires understanding, it is just one of many factors explaining microevolutionary events and macroevolutionary patterns. Further, complex adaptations are but one phenomenon explanations in evolutionary biology. Extrapolationism is not a good theory, with large-scale patterns in the history of life not explainable by extrapolating from measurable events in local populations. Evolutionary biology needs a theory of variation, explaining the effect of variation supply on change potentiality. While humans are evolved animals, attempts to explain human behaviour using techniques from evolutionary biology have largely failed, "vitiated by one-sided understanding of evolutionary biology. They have often been biologically naive." (p. 170)
Sterelny notes that these debates remain alive and developing, with no final abjudication possible as yet. "But we can say something about how the argument has developed." (p. 170) He claims that "the idea that gene-selectionist views of evolution are tacitly dependent on reductionism and genetic determinism is a mistake. Dawkins and the other gene selectionists do not think that nothing happens in evolution but changes in gene frequency." (p. 170) They do not deny the significance of the organism or phenotype, which they see as vehicles of selection, or 'survival machines', which interact with other survival machines and with the environment in ways replication of the genes whose vehicles they are. But there are other replication-enhancing strategies apart from organism construction. Extended phenotypes, as exemplified by parasitic species, are common and important, with probably all parasitic gene pools including "genes whose adaptive effects are on host organisms." (p. 171) And "the outlaw count is unknown, but it is growing all the time", and may transpire to be more common than thought.
Sterelny notes that "gene selectionism is not determinism. No gene selectionist thinks that there is typically a simple relationship between carrying a particular gene and having a particular phenotype". While they exist, such as the sickle-cell haemoglobin gene, they are the exception not the rule. Gene-selectionist ideas are compatible with context dependence of gene action, but they do assume some reasonable regular relationship between a specific gene in an organism's genotype, and some aspect of the organism's phenotypic expression. They assume that within gene lineages, the effect on their vehicles will be fairly similar. "So while gene selectionists are not genetic determinists, they are making a bet on developmental biology. When revitalised to reoccurring features of context, gene action will turn out to be fairly systematic. There is no reason to suppose that this hunch is false, but it is not known to be true." (p. 172)
Developmental biology is relevant to this debate in another important way: "The role of selection in evolution. Gould is betting that when the facts of developmental biology are in, it will turn out that the evolutionary possibilities of most lineages are highly constrained", with some characteristics "frozen" into their respective lineages. "They are developmentally entrenched. That is, these basic organisational features are connected in development to most aspects of the organism's phenotype, and that makes them hard to change." (p. 172) And "since variation in these frozen-in features is unlikely, selection is not likely to be important in explaining their persistence", (p. 173) and Gould thinks 'frozen accidents' are important in explanations of evolutionary patterns found in the fossil record. Conversely, Dawkins thinks that over time, selection can alter the range of a lineage's evolutionary possibilities. "So he thinks both that selection has a larger range of variation with which to work, and that when patterns do exist over long periods ... selection will have played a stabilising role." (p. 173) The integration of evolution and development "is the hottest of hot topics in contemporary evolutionary theory, and this issue is still most certainly open". In discussing the effects of mutations, Sterelny's "best current guess is that developmental biology probably does generate biases in the variation that is available to selection, and hence that evolutionary trajectories will often depend both on selection and these biases in supply" (173), vindicating Gould's view that developmental biology is crucial to explaining evolutionary patterns. (p. 174)
"But it is harder to see how to resolve some of Gould's other claims about the large-scale history of life. Despite the plausibility of the distinction between disparity and diversity, we are not close to constructing a good account of disparity and its measurement". (p. 174) Further, convergent evolution belies the unpredictability that Gould supposes. However, "most examples of convergence are not independent of evolutionary experiments. For they concern lineages with an enormous amount of shared history, and hence shared developmental potential", as in "the standard example of streamlining in marine reptiles, sharks, pelagic bony fish like the tuna, and dolphins". (p. 175) Further, "the scale is not large enough. The fact that eyes have often evolved does not show that had, say, the earliest chordates succumbed to a bit of bad luck (and become extinct), then vertebrate-like organisms wold have evolved again." (p. 175) Moreover, Gould's main concern is not with adaptive complexes, which are the source of the above, oft-cited examples, "but with body plans—basic ways of assembling organisms." Sterelny thinks that "we have to score Gould's contingency claims as: 'Don't know; and at this stage don't know how to find out'". (p. 175)
Gould seems right that mass extinctions played a role in shaping evolutionary history, and "is probably right that extinction works by different rules in mass extinction regimes". (p. 176) Some ideas are difficult to assess, such as whether mass extinctions filter out the features of species or of individuals comprising species. It is also difficult to tell how fundamental is the disagreement between Gould and Dawkins on this. But Sterelny's bet is that Gould may be right in thinking that survival or extinction in mass extinction depends on species properties. "However, it has proved hard to find really clear, empirically well-founded examples to back up this hunch." (p. 176) It was once thought that sexual reproduction was maintained by species selection, which Sterelny outlines. He notes however that "this idea has recently fallen on hard times", with new individual-based ideas being developed. Further, species-level maintenance of sexual reproduction "has a problem: sex does not always promote evolvability", breaking up as well as creating advantageous gene combinations. (p. 177)
"So it has been hard to find really convincing examples of species-level properties that are built by species-level selection. The problem is to find: (i) traits that are aspects of species, not the organisms making up the species; (ii) traits that are relevant to extinction and survival; and (iii) traits that are transmitted to daughter species, granddaughter species and so forth". And "transmission to daughter species is especially problematic". (p. 177) In the end, Sterelny states his own views are much closer to Dawkins than to Gould's, especially regarding microevolution—change within local populations. "But macroevolution is not just microevolution scaled up. Gould's paleontological perspective offers real insights into mass extinction and its consequences, and, perhaps, the nature of species and speciation". And Gould is right to expand the explanatory agenda of evolutionary biology to include large-scale patterns in life's history. "So, Dawkins is right about evolution on local scales, but maybe Gould is right about the relationship between events on a local scale, and those on the vast scale of paleontological time." (p. 178)
Suggested Reading.
The Suggested Reading section for each chapter is an extension of the chapter, aimed at pointing the reader in the direction of material that may assist their understanding of the issues under discussion.
This section of Sterelny's book contains, chapter by chapter, a comprehensive list of recommended reading, covering all of the main publications by Dawkins, Gould, and their respective proponents, along with many lesser known publications by them, with accompanying commentary on either the authors, the publications, or both. Also, the readability of the various publications, and the relevance of the publications to the issues under discussion, as well as the relationship of the publications to each other, such as authors responding to each other through their publications, or supporting the stance of other authors, etc. He also tries to further clarify some points in the process.
Notes.
a. Sterelny cites the Milankovich cycles as one such isolating mechanism.
b. Italics in the quoted text.
c. Chiefly in his Natural History essays, which were published in the collected volumes of his popular science books.
d. In drawing on Viruses of the Mind, from Dawkins' book A Devil's Chaplain, Sterelny contrasts evangelical religions with non-evangelical ones such as Judaism, which he describes as "mostly a family affair", in which the religious views are primarily inherited socially from parents. (p. 164)
e. There are no Wikipedia articles specifically dealing with Richerson, Boyd, or their works. But their approach is captured in the article on Dual inheritance theory, which cites their works, including the book cited by Sterelny.

Jesus Trail

The Jesus Trail is a hiking and pilgrimage route in the Galilee region of Israel that traces the route Jesus may have walked, connecting many sites from his life and ministry. The main part of the trail begins in Nazareth and passes through Tzippori, Cana (Kafr Kanna), the Horns of Hattin, Mount Arbel Cliffs, the Sea of Galilee, Capernaum, Tabgha, and the Mount of Beatitudes. An alternate return route passes by Tiberias, the Jordan River, Mount Tabor, and Mount Precipice.
History.
The trail was founded in 2007 by two hiking enthusiasts, Maoz Inon, a Jewish Israeli entrepreneur who has established hostels and guesthouses in Israel, and David Landis, a Christian American hiking specialist. The actual marking of the trail took place in 2008. It is currently managed and promoted largely by the work of volunteers, and is a non-profit project.
The trail is public and free for anyone who wants to hike and camp along its course. The Jesus Trail is marked with a blaze of three stripes painted on rocks along the way (white, orange, and white). When portions of the Jesus Trail combine with other trails (such as the Israel National Trail), an additional orange circle is added to the previous trail marker. All marking of the trail was completed by the public Israel Trails Committee (ITC) which works in conjunction with the Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel (SPNI). Trail maintenance and cleaning up has been a combined effort of international, national, and local organizations including JNF-KKL (The Jewish National Fund), the Fauzi Azar Inn in Nazareth, village schools, and international volunteers.
The biblical reference for the Jesus Trail is based on a verse from the New Testament Gospel of Matthew wherein at the start of Jesus' public ministry he is described as moving from his home-town of Nazareth, located in the hills of the Galilee, down to Capernaum which was a lakeside fishing village on the Sea of Galilee, where Jesus is described as gathering his first disciples. The account is also related in the two other synoptic gospels of Mark and Luke. The reference in the Gospel of Matthew reads: "Leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum which was by the lake." (Matthew 4:13).
According to the Gospels, Capernaum became the home base for Jesus' ministry: "And getting into a boat he crossed over and came to his own city to Capernaum." (Matthew 9:1); also: "And when he returned to Capernaum after some days, it was reported that he was at home." (Mark 2:1).
On the official Jesus Trail Homepage Maoz Inon and David Landis explain the Jesus Trail philosophy: "We hope that travelers of diverse religious and ethnic backgrounds will gain a new understanding of the life of Jesus through the people and land that shaped his historical context along the Jesus Trail. Today, encounters on the trail still serve as opportunities to extend and receive hospitality with diverse groups of people. Modern travelers can practice living simply and traveling light, gaining wisdom from the spirit of Jesus’ words from Mark 6:8-9: "Take nothing for the journey except a staff—no bread, no bag, no money in your belts. Wear sandals but not an extra tunic."
The Jesus Trail was designed in the tradition of pilgrimage hiking trails around the world, such as the "Camino de Santiago de Compostela" (the Way of Saint James) in northern Spain and the Saint Paul Trail in Turkey. The medieval practice of religious pilgrimage has seen a resurgence in recent years, with almost 200,000 hikers per year on the "Camino de Santiago" in the first decade of the 21st century.
Target group.
The trail is geared for Christians who seek a pilgrimage route that allows for a more personal experience of the Galilee and sites from the life of Jesus, but integrates historical sites from different eras, sites sacred to other religions, nature sites, breathtaking panoramas and hiking for those who seek a physical challenge. The Gospel Trail is a similar hiking path that opened in November 2011 to attract Christian tourism to Israel, which accounts for two-thirds of all incoming tourism.
Sections of the trail.
The geography and distances involved naturally allow the Jesus Trail to be walked as a series of day-hikes for a total of four days, with each day's hike being between 13 to 19 km (8 to 12 mi) in length.

Chess World Cup 2005

The Chess World Cup 2005 served as a qualification tournament for the FIDE World Chess Championship 2007. It was held as a 128-player tournament, between 27 November and 17 December 2005, in Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia.
Top ten players qualified for the candidates matches of the World Chess Championship 2007. One of them (Étienne Bacrot) has qualified for the candidates matches via rating, freeing the place for the eleventh player at the World Cup (Vladimir Malakhov).
The World Cup was won by Levon Aronian.
Background.
The 2005 World Cup was part of the cycle for the FIDE World Chess Championship 2007. Three of the players at the World Cup, Levon Aronian, Alexander Grischuk and Boris Gelfand, went on to qualify for the World Championship, which was held as an eight-player double round-robun event, with Gelfand finishing third.
Four top finishers of the FIDE World Chess Championship 2005 (Veselin Topalov, Viswanathan Anand, Peter Svidler and Alexander Morozevich) were already invited to the World Championship 2007 and thus exempt from the World Cup.
Playing conditions.
The tournament was in the style of the FIDE World Chess Championships between 1998 and 2004: each round consisted of a two game match, followed by tie breaks at faster time controls if required.

Eugénie de Beauharnais

Eugénie Hortense Auguste Napoléone, known as Eugénie de Beauharnais, princess of Leuchtenberg (22 December 1808, Milan – 1 September 1847, Freudenstadt) was a Franco-German princess. She was the second daughter of Eugène de Beauharnais and Princess Augusta of Bavaria, and a member of the house of Beauharnais. In 1826 she married Constantine, Prince of Hohenzollern-Hechingen.
Life.
Early years.
Born and raised as a Catholic, Eugénie grew up in the Palais Leuchtenberg on Ludwigstraße in Munich and frequently spent the summer months with her parents at Schloss Eugensberg, a castle built by her father on Lake Constance (at what is now Salenstein). The family's behaviour was princely in every aspect - the French envoy Coulomb wrote in 1822: "Prince Eugène de Beauharnais lives in greater luxury than [Napoleon's] court". Their palace in Munich had been built by the famous Bavarian architect Leo von Klenze for over 2 million guilders. Besides Munich and Schloss Eugensberg, the family had manors at Eichstätt and Ismaning. On her father's death in 1824, Eugénie inherited Schloss Eugensberg.
Marriage.
On 22 May 1826 Eugénie married the Catholic Hereditary Prince Constantine of Hohenzollern-Hechingen in Eichstätt. Eugénie brought Hofkavalier Gustav von Billing (born in Leuchtenberg) to Hechingen as her financial advisor - he managed her large dowry on her mother's behalf and quickly won Constantine's trust as an advisor. From 1833 on, Eugénie and her husband lived at Schloss Lindich near Hechingen, the residence city of the House of Hohenzollern-Hechingen, though they also spent much of the summer months at Schloss Eugensberg, thus keeping in contact with her aunt Hortense and her cousin Louis Napoleon, who later became Napoleon III.
Life in Hechingen.
Eugénie had a great lust for life and even hunted deer with her husband in 1831. The couple took many trips to Munich, to Schloss Eugensburg by lake Constance, to the summer residence of the kings of Bavaria at Tegernsee and in 1833 a Grand Tour to Italy, which lasted nearly 18 months and went as far as Sicily.
Eugénie then sold Schloss Eugensberg for 32,000 guilders to Heinrich von Kiesow of Augsburg. The proceeds of that sale financed her rebuilding of Villa Eugenia in Hechingen, where the couple took up residence in 1834. At the southern edge of the Villa's park, she acquired the Gasthaus "Zur Silberburg" and in 1844 rebuilt it as another villa, to house visiting noble relations. The surrounding gardens were also bought up and redesigned as an English landscape, now known as the "Fürstengarten".
Some of the couple's famous guests at Hechingen included her cousin Napoleon III, Hector Berlioz and Franz Liszt. The Hofkapelle had a good choir and from 1843 the Villa hosted Sunday concerts by members of the Museumsgesellschaft (museum society) and the Musikvereins (music society).
Liebevoll remained childless and sought comfort in increasing piety, setting up an old-people's home in Hechingen and (in 1839) a major "Kinderbewahranstalt" for the town (the building which housed the latter contains a bust of her and is now the Amtsgericht). The latter was set up for those children whose parents "were often hindered by business or domestic difficulties, at home or in the fields, from bringing up their small children".
For ten years she attended her father-in-law Frederick, mortally ill from war injuries, who died in 1838 at Schloss Lindich. Every Maundy Thursday, Eugénie and her husband washed the feet of twelve old and needy local people and then invited them to an "Apostelmahl" or Last Supper in the Billardhäuschen in the Fürstengarten, at which (after a grace) a stockfish with sauerkraut was passed round.
Eugénie became ill with tuberculosis and in winter 1846 moved into the so-called Hofküche directly behind the Villa Eugenia, since it could be better heated. Her doctors gave her odd treatments, including the inhalation of fumes from cow dung and the burning of moxa sticks on her chest. Due to the risk of spreading the disease, she could only see her husband rarely, and even then only at a distance. In summer 1847 she set off to seek a cure at the Badenweiler spa, but on the return journey she died at the Hotel Post in Freudenstadt on 1 September 1847. She was buried in the vault before the high altar of the Stiftskirche in Hechingen. On her mother's request, her heart was placed in an urn in the chapel of the Palais Leuchtenberg in Munich; since 1952 it has been housed in a niche beside the choir steps on the right side of the Stiftskirche. In her will she left her fortune of 273,000 guilders to charity.

Karmia

Karmia () is a kibbutz in southern Israel. Located between Ashkelon and the Gaza Strip, it falls under the jurisdiction of Hof Ashkelon Regional Council. In 2006 it had a population of 464.
The kibbutz was established on 20 May 1950 by a Nahal gar'in of Hashomer Hatzair members from France and Tunisia who had been trained in Beit Zera. It was established around a school which had been built by the British authorities for the Arab village of Hiribya, which was depopulated during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Its name is derived from the Hebrew for vineyard (, "Kerem"), which were common in the area.
In 1972 a blanket factory was established in the kibbutz.
The kibbutz absorbed 54 families from Elei Sinai and Nisanit, which were evacuated as part of the disengagement plan. Since 2006 it has been repeatedly hit by Qassam rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, including one that landed on its football pitch, and another Qassam rocket that landed inside a house and injured 3 people severely in 2005.

Concerto for solo piano

A concerto for solo piano is a piece for solo piano in one or more movements.
History.
Although various "concert" pieces have been written across history (such as Liszt's "Trois études de concert" and "Grand solo de concert"), concertos for solo piano are very rare. The first (and still best known) example comes from Johann Sebastian Bach, whose "Italian Concerto", BWV 971, was published in 1735. Even though it was written for two-manual harpsichord, it is regularly played on the piano and considered the first example of a concerto fitted to solo keyboard.
Schumann's Piano Sonata No. 3 (1835), Op. 14, was labelled by Tobias Haslinger as a "Concerto without orchestra".
The French composer Charles-Valentin Alkan wrote in 1857 his set of Op. 39 études, of which nos. 8–10 were labelled as a concerto for solo piano. It includes markings such as "Tutti", "Solo" and "Piano", as well as instrumental directions such as "quasi-trombe" and "quasi-celli".
The Spanish composer Joaquín Turina wrote in 1935 his "Concerto Without Orchestra" (Spanish: Concierto sin orquesta), Op. 88.
Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji's "Concerto da suonare da me solo e senza orchestra, per divertirmi" (1946) is clearly inspired by Alkan; for instance, the third movement of the work is titled "Scherzo diabolico"—a reference to Alkan's Étude Op. 39 No. 3. In addition to that, the first movement of the work contains various programmatic indications. These, however, are controversial, since they effectively refer to an imaginary orchestra. However, it has also been argued that the orchestra is represented in the work by means of bitonal relationships.
The piano concertos nos. 4 and 6 of Michael Finnissy are pieces for solo piano.
John White has described his Piano Sonata No. 152 as a concerto for solo piano.

Louis Caput

Louis Caput (Saint-Maur-des-Fosses, 23 January 1923, died Paris, 1 January 1985) was a French professional racing cyclist and then team manager. He won Paris–Tours in 1948, and two stages of the Tour de France. He was national champion in 1946.
Career.
Caput rode as a professional from 1942 to 1957. René de Latour said:
He rode the Tour de France nine times between 1947 and 1956, failing to finish six times but coming 45th in 1951, 54th in 1955 and 56th in 1956. He won stages in 1949 and 1955. He came third in the Tour of Flanders of 1950.
Retirement.
Caput stopped racing in 1957 and went into the real estate business in Vincennes, an eastern suburb of Paris. In 1966 he became directeur sportif of a new team, Kamomé-Dilecta, sponsored by a maker of Japanese washing machines and a French bicycle company that had last had a team in the 1930s. The team soon ran into trouble and riders were no longer paid. "We were paid "à la musette", which means only if we won. Kamomé was in financial difficulties," said one of the riders, Raymond Lebreton.
The French businessman, Jean de Gribaldy, took over sponsorship the following year with Frimatic, another maker of washing machines, as main backer. Caput went with him to run the team but, said, Lebreton, his organisation was chaotic. "The de Gribaldy team was badly organised. We were told we were to ride raced only a few hours before they started. It was a bazaar, and I wanted to leave." Caput ran the team from 1968 to 1969. The following year Antonin Magne retired from running the Mercier team, which had lost BP as secondary sponsor.
Fagor, a Spanish maker of refrigerators and other household goods, took over. An incidental effect of Caput's arrival as manager is that Raymond Poulidor and the other riders were allowed zips at the necks of their jerseys, something Magne had always thought unhealthy.
Death and memorial.
Louis Caput died on the first day of 1985. A cycling event is organised annually in his honour.

Colours and badge.
Yellow is the traditional UE Santa Coloma color. Manly of the home kits alternate yellow and black. Until 2013 the badge was representing Santa Coloma's pre-romanical church tower and the most traditional team icon, the squirrel.
Nowadays still representing the Santa Coloma's squirrel and the colours of the Andorran nation with the motto's country "Virtus Unita Fortior".
Support.
The club's nickname, as seen from the crest, is "Esquirols" (Squirrels) due to the number of the animals that live around the town of Santa Coloma. There is a long-standing tradition for a number of fans to wear squirrel costumes at the club's last home game of each season.
Club rivalries.
"El Derbi Colomenc".
The local rival of UE Santa Coloma is actually his neighbour's hometown football team FC Santa Coloma. The rivalry between this two teams has increased since the 2009/10 season when those teams were competing for winning the Premier Andorran League.
Current squad.

Dyson Mallinson

Sir Dyson Mallinson (Prospect House, Linthwaite, Yorkshire, 30 March 1852- July 1929, Bournemouth, Hampshire) was a 19th-century industrialist from Huddersfield, England, and the "father bountiful" of Elmfield College (Booth 1990:39)
He was the son of George Mallinson of Hoyle House, Linthwaite, whose father had founded the firm of George Mallinson & Sons, woollen manufacturers. Dyson was apprenticed with Joshua Whiteley & Co., of Huddersfield, cotton spinners, but removed to Liverpool some time prior to 1880, where he traded as a cotton broker.
He was knighted on 4 June 1921 for public services, and was a governor of the Leys School, Cambridge. He resided at Birkdale, Lancashire, and died in July 1929. He lost his money in the 1920s crash (Booth p. 39).
Earby Local History Society has documents relating to a case in the High Court, Chancery Division, between Rev Joel Mallinson (brother of Sir Dyson Mallinson, the bankrupted owner of Victoria Mills) and the executors of Thomas Riley (Dyson Mallinson had a mortgage on the mill with Thomas Riley) - Dated 1891.
Mr. Dyson Mallinson, who belonged to a highly respected Huddersfield family, succeeded to the proprietorship of the Victoria Mill and Old Shed on the removal of the Bracewell family to America.
Family life.
On May 13, 1880, Mallinson married Elizabeth Annie Bracewell, the eldest daughter of the "Old Master" Christopher Bracewell, amid scenes of unparalleled public interest in Earby Wesleyan Chapel, Skipton. The Wesleyan Chapel was crowded, as it was also the first marriage which had taken place in the sanctuary. The workpeople and their families, to the number of 700, were entertained on the following Saturday, tea being served in the Victoria Institute and the Baptist and Wesleyan schools. A gala was afterwards held in the Cricket Field, and a party of gymnastic entertainers provided a thrilling display. Refreshments on a lavish scale were provided, and the village Brass Band played for dancing. At the close of the day the Band paid a visit to Green End House, and played for the enjoyment of the guests.
Within four years, 1885–1889, the Mallinson era in Earby drew to its close, and it was a gloomy experience for the village community. Bad trade, poor work, low wages, and constant unrest breaking out in spontaneous strikes, were the outstanding features of that period. For a short time Mr. Mallinson, with his wife and two children, resided at Heather View, Green End.
In 1900Jan31 he married again, in St. Anne's, Aigburth, to HELENA JANE KELLEY daughter of John Kelley. She was born 1867 in Heckmondwike. There is some suggestion that this may have been a bigamous marriage, as although his first wife had 'taken to the bottle', she was not quite dead. (He signed himself at the wedding ceremony as "Bachelor", not "Widower".)
Children of his first marriage were:
Children of his second marriage were:

Théodolinde de Beauharnais

Théodolinde de Beauharnais, Princess of Leuchtenberg (13 April 1814 – 1 April 1857), Countess of Württemberg by marriage, was a Franco-German princess. She was a granddaughter of Joséphine de Beauharnais, Napoleon's first wife.
Biography.
The fifth of the seven children of Eugène de Beauharnais (1781–1824), Duke of Leuchtenberg, and his wife, Princess Augusta of Bavaria (1788–1851), Théodolinde was born in Mantua, Italy, and presumably named for Theudelinda, a 6th-century queen of the Lombards. She had two brothers (Auguste and Maximilian) and three surviving sisters (Joséphine, Eugénie, and Amélie). Joséphine de Beauharnais, the first wife of Napoléon Bonaparte and former Empress of France, was her paternal grandmother. The latter, however, died about six weeks after Théodolinde's birth.
Through her marriage to Friedrich Wilhelm Alexander Ferdinand, Count of Württemberg, Théodolinde became Countess ("Gräfin") of Württemberg, but died before her husband was created Duke of Urach. She died after a short illness on the morning of 1 April 1857 in Stuttgart, Germany, and was buried in the family vault at Ludwigsburg, with her heart buried at the Hauskapelle of the palace in Munich.
She was the subject of an 1840 portrait by Friedrich Dürck.
Marriage and issue.
On 8 February 1841, at the age of 26, she was married in Munich to Wilhelm, Count of Württemberg (afterwards Duke of Urach), whose father, Wilhelm Friedrich of Württemberg, was a younger brother of Friedrich II, the last Duke of Würtemberg, whom Napoleon later (1806) elevated to the status of King of Württemberg, as Friedrich I. He was also a cousin of Princess Catharina of Württemberg (1783–1835), who became the second wife of Jérôme Bonaparte, Napoleon's youngest brother, in 1807.
Four daughters were born from this marriage:
Her husband's second marriage to Princess Florestine of Monaco produced his heir, the future Wilhelm Karl, Duke of Urach.

Zvartnots Cathedral

Zvartnots Cathedral (; meaning "celestial angels") is a 7th-century centrally planned aisled tetraconch type Armenian cathedral built by the order of Catholicos Nerses the Builder from 643-652. Now in ruins, it is located at the edge of the city of Etchmiadzin in Armavir Province of Armenia.
History.
Zvartnots was built at a time when much of Armenia was under Byzantine control or influence and during the early invasions of Armenia by the Muslim Arabs. Construction of the cathedral began in 643 under the guidance of Catholicos Nerses III (nicknamed "Shinogh" or "the Builder"). Dedicated to St. Gregory, it was located the place, where a meeting between King Trdat III and Gregory the Illuminator was supposed to have taken place. According to the medieval Armenian historian Movses Kaghankatvatsi, the cathedral was consecrated in 652. From 653 to 659, Nerses was in Tayk and the construction of the cathedral continued under Anastas Akoratsi. Following the Arab occupation of Dvin and the intensifying wars between the Byzantine and Arab armies on the former's eastern borders, Nerses transferred the patriarchal palace of the Catholicos from Dvin to Zvartnots. 
Zvartnots remained standing until the end of the 10th century, but historical sources are silent as to the cause of its collapse. A close copy of the cathedral was erected at Ani out by Trdat the Architect under the reign of Gagik I Bagratuni during the final decade of the 10th century. The contemporary Armenian historian Stepanos Taronetsi referred to Zvartnots when describing the church that Gagik I had inaugurated as "a large structure at Vałaršapat , dedicated to the same saint that had fallen into ruins."
Excavations.
The ruins of Zvartnots remained buried until its remains were uncovered at the start of the 20th century. The site was excavated between 1901 and 1907 under the direction of vardapet Khachik Dadyan, uncovering the foundations of the cathedral as well as the remains of the Catholicos palace and a winery. The excavations furthermore revealed that Zvartnots stood on the remnants of structures that dated back to reign of the Urartian king Rusa II.
Structure.
Most scholars accept the 1905 reconstruction by Toros Toramanian, who worked on the original excavations, and proposed that the building had three floors. 
Some scholars, as Stepan Mnatsakanyan and most notably A. Kuzentsov, however, reject his reconstruction and have offered alternative plans. Kuzentsov, for example, contended that Toramanian's plan was "constructionally illogical" and insisted that the technical expertise at the time did not correspond to the bold design that the architect had conceived. 
The interior of the mosaic-decorated church had the shape of a Greek cross or tetraconch, with an aisle encircling this area, while the exterior was a 32-sided polygon which appeared circular from a distance. 
Some sources claim that the Zvartnots cathedral is depicted upon Mount Ararat in a relief in Sainte-Chapelle in Paris. However, this is not very likely as the fresco was painted more than 300 years after destruction of the church.
Together with churches in Echmiadzin, Zvartnots was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 2000.
A drawing of the cathedral was depicted on the first issue of 100 AMD banknotes and its model can be seen in Yerevan History Museum.
Modern Incarnations.
The "Holy Trinity Armenian Church" in the Malatia-Sebastia district of Yerevan is modeled by architect Baghdasar Arzoumanian after Zvartnots and was completed in 2003.

The children of Palhavã (Portuguese "Meninos de Palhavã") were three male natural sons of King John V of Portugal (1706–1750), which were recognised by the monarch in a document issued in 1742, which was published only after the death of the king, in 1752.
The expression comes from the fact these three children had lived in the palace of the Marquis of Louriçal, in the Palhavã area, in those times outside Lisbon. Today, this building is within the city limits and it is occupied by the Spanish Embassy.
The children had a remarkable education in the Santa Cruz Monastery, in Coimbra. Their master was Friar Gaspar da Encarnação, who educated them as religious men according to the late King's wishes. 
The three children of Palhavã were:
In spite that they were King Joseph I's half brothers, Anthony and Joseph were exiled to Buçaco in 1760 due to a conflict with the Marquis of Pombal, the all-mighty prime minister. They were allowed to return to the Court only after the king's death, in 1777.

Kanakalata

Kanakalata (by Pallikabi Nanda Kishore Bal), is a novel published in 1925 about social realism. A substantial part of this novel was actually published in serialized form in Utkal Sahitya in 1913 and was widely acclaimed by the readers.
Plot.
The plot of the novel centres round two pairs of lovers: Dhananjay and Kanakalata whose love-at-first-sight culminates in marriage after overcoming the hurdle of dowry dispute, Rajendra and a child-widow named Uma whose passion and love for each other remain unfulfilled with Uma's death and Rajendra renouncing the world and turning into a sanyasi. The plot is in fact an indictment of the evils of dowry system in rural aristocratic society and the predicament of the child-widows who were condemned into a life of anguish and suffering.
The novelist's zeal for social reforms is clearly evident in the language and plot-structure of the novel. The novel also portrays a realistic image of the typical landscape and lifestyle of rural Orissa in the early decades of the twentieth century.

Chinese Baptist Convention

The Chinese Baptist Convention (Abbr: CBC; ) is a cooperative association of Baptist churches in Taiwan and the territories administered by the Republic of China.
History.
Background.
Similar to the Baptist Convention of Hong Kong and the Macau Baptist Convention, the CBC traces its origins from the original missionaries sent by the Triennial Convention to China. The Revd. John William Shuck and his wife, Henrietta Shuck, established their work in Portuguese ruled Macau in 1835 whereas Dr. and Mrs. William Dean began work at the same time among Chaozhou speaking Chinese in Bangkok, Thailand.
The work was relocated to Hong Kong in 1842 where both the Shucks and the Deans worked with the Cantonese and Chaozhou speaking Chinese respectively. They were joined by other missionaries, including Issachar Jacox Roberts, who began mission work in Canton (present day Guangzhou) in 1844, becoming one of the first Western missionary to work outside the relative safety of the protected European factories and the Deans relocated their mission headquarters to Swatow (present day Shantou) in 1860.
By 1949, the American Southern Baptist Mission in China had 220 missionaries working in 392 congregations, 410 outreach points, serving a total of 123,000 Baptist Christians. The bulk of the work was located in the provinces of Kwangtung, Kwangsi, Kiangsu, Honan, Ahnwei, and Shantung and it included institutions like hospitals, schools, and colleges in Pingtu, Longkow, Kweilin, Yangchow, K'aifeng, and a few other cities and towns. By 1951, most foreign missionaries were expelled from mainland China with the establishment of the Three-Self Patriotic Movement.
Work in Taiwan.
In October 1936, a resolution was passed during the centenary celebrations of the Baptist mission in China to engage in the extension of work to the frontier regions, which then included Taiwan which was a part of Japan. With the retrocession of Taiwan to China following the surrender of Japan in 1945, plans were made to expand the mission to Taiwan. A visit was made by a Shanghai missionary, Lila Florence Watson, in February 1948.
In 1948, the National Baptist Convention of China was established in Shanghai and Yang Mei Chai (楊美齋) was sent to Taiwan to establish a frontier mission in June of the same year. Yang was also appointed the head of the Taiwan district of the national convention. Bertha Smith of the American Southern Baptist Mission in Shantung arrived in Taiwan on October 19, 1948 and the first church was inaugurated on December 26 of the same year.
Local ministry.
In the 1950s, the CBC saw an influx of missionaries and refugees from the mainland. This led to the rapid growth of the church particularly in the Mandarin language ministry with significant support from the Southern Baptist Convention in the United States. The first Taiwanese Hokkien service was conducted in at the Amoy Street Baptist Church (廈門街浸信會). In February 1957, the first Taiwanese congregation was established as the Mu Yi Church (慕義堂).
Work among the Hakkas began in 1958 in Miaoli and further work was planted in Pingtung. Work began with the aboriginal peoples of Taiwan as early as 1951 in Liouguei, Kaohsiung with the establishment of the Liouguei Baptist Church (六龜浸信會). Work in languages apart from Mandarin was however generally slow due to the lack of standard materials and work among the aboriginal people was not significant until the first Ami pastor graduated from the Taiwan Baptist Theological Seminary in 1982.
Later developments.
From the period of 1948 to 1954, a total of 11 churches and 22 outreach points had been established by Baptist missionaries and workers. On July 5, 1954, the Taiwan Baptist Association (台灣浸信會聯) was established. It was later renamed the Chinese Baptist Church, Taiwan Province Convention and the Chinese Baptist Church, Taiwan Convention before assuming its current name in 1972.
Similar to Baptist churches elsewhere, churches affiliated with the CBC are autonomous and self-governed and the CBC doesn't exercise any executive authority. The CBC's role is primarily in the coordination of work among the associated churches and the management of inter-church institutions.
Taiwan Baptist Theological Seminary.
The seminary was established in 1952 for the training of national workers. Until recently the seminary had faced problems from the authorities as it was an unrecognized institution and had faced accusations of awarding fraudulent academic degrees in the past. In 2005, the Legislative Yuan passed a resolution to provide for the framework of recognition of religious academic institutions and seminaries allowing the seminary to initiate the procedure of gaining full recognition from the authorities.
Affiliations.
The CBC is a member of the Baptist World Alliance and the Asia Pacific Baptist Federation.

<doc id="18245288" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18245288" title="Evolutionary logic">
Evolutionary logic

Evolutionary Logic is the idea that logical rules can be reduced to biology. 
It is a theory of rationality in which rational and logical rules emerged for pragmatic reasons, and are therefore not special laws. 
The formal systems of logic have ordinarily been studied independently, but (continual) progress in evolutionary theory suggests that biology and logic could be intimately interrelated. 
Evolutionary Logic suggests that the principles of reasoning are neither fixed, absolute, independent, nor elemental. Instead it is the evolutionary dynamic that is elemental.
William S. Cooper argues in the book "The Evolution of Reason" that logical rules are derived directly from evolutionary principles. 
Logical rules are derived directly from evolutionary principles, and therefore, have no metaphysical status of their own.
Modularity theory of mind.
The Modularity theory of mind is the notion that a mind, at least in part, may be composed of separate innate structures which have established evolutionarily-developed functional purposes. 
Individuals including Noam Chomsky, Steven Pinker, Leda Cosmides, John Tooby, and David Buss, believed that all brain functions were founded on specific modules – there would be modules for language, for mating, religion, etc., and so logic.
As archaeologist Steven Mithen writes in "The Prehistory of Mind" (1996), there is evidence that our ancestors began with a generic intelligence, such as we find in apes.
Others have suggested that ancestors developed three major specialized modules: one for naive physics; one for manufacture of instruments; and one for culture and the politics of coexistence.

Laurel Martyn

Laurel Martyn (born Laurel Gill, 23 July 1916 – 16 October 2013) was an Australian ballerina. 
In 1933 she left Australia for England and studied with Phyllis Bedells. In 1934 she won a choreographic scholarship from the Association of Operatic Dancing (later the Royal Academy of Dance) for "Exile", her first composition. In 1935 she became the second Australian to win the Adeline Genée Gold Medal. Martyn joined the Vic-Wells Ballet (later Sadler's Wells) in December 1935, the first Australian woman to be accepted into the company. By 1938, she was a soloist. That same year, she returned to Australia and became a dance teacher. She joined Edouard Borovansky's eponymous ballet corps in 1940 and remained until her marriage to Lloyd Lawton in 1945. 
Works.
After leaving the Borovansky Ballet in 1945, Martyn began creating her own dance works. These included "The Sentimental Bloke Who Couldn't Be a Man" in 1952 and "Mathinna" in 1954. These works were inspired by Australian themes. "The Sentimental Bloke" used Australian literature for inspiration and "Mathinna", concerning an Aboriginal girl adopted into white society, explored the political, social and racial implications of relationships between Aborigines and colonial settlers.
Later years.
She also was instrumental in forming the Young Dancers' Theatre, for which she choreographed several works in the 1980s, and the Classical Dance Teachers Australia Inc, which provided in-service training for dance teachers.

Battle of Đồng Hới

The Battle of Đồng Hới was a clash between United States Navy warships and three North Vietnamese air force MiG-17F fighter bombers, several torpedo boats and shore batteries on April 19, 1972 during the Vietnam War. This was the first time US warships faced an air raid since the end of World War II.
The Battle for Đồng Hới Gulf in fact involved fierce fire fights between Navy ships attempting to stop North Vietnamese troops and supplies transiting the coast highway in North Vietnam from reaching the battle front in Quảng Trị Province. The air raid described here marked the end of daylight raids by the Navy. Within a few weeks, however, all North Vietnamese resistance at Đồng Hới was suppressed.
Battle.
The U.S. warships involved were the 7th Fleet flagship, guided missile cruiser , the guided missile frigate , and destroyers and .
The American warships were shelling North Vietnamese coastal targets around Đồng Hới, Quảng Bình Province, North Central Coast region when attacked by North Vietnamese aircraft. This was the first MiG attack on U.S. naval forces in the Gulf of Tonkin. The battle site is in the Gulf of Tonkin, near the DMZ along the 17th parallel, the provisional borderline of the Republic of Vietnam and Democratic Republic of Vietnam.
One of the MiG-17F's, flown by NVAF pilot Le Xuan Di, scored a direct hit on "Higbee" with a BETAB-250 (250 kg/551 lb) bomb, after failing to hit his target twice on two previous attack runs. The MiG was then shot down by a "Terrier" surface-to-air missile fired from "Sterrett". The explosion destroyed "Higbee"'s aft 5-inch gun mount and wounded sailors, according to DesRonNine staff present at the battle, in the gun mount's upper handling room. The gun mount itself was empty, the 12 man crew having been evacuated following a "hang fire" (a round stuck in one of the barrels). "Oklahoma City" received minor damage from shrapnel resulting from shore fire. Two of several North Vietnamese torpedo boats were sunk by gunfire when they engaged the U.S. ships as they escorted the "Higbee" from the area. However, the North Vietnamese claimed that all of their aircraft had returned safely to base after the sortie, and that the North Vietnamese navy had not involved in any engagement until August 27.
Aftermath.
After their bombing run, the North Vietnamese pilots retreated back to their air base. If there 
were any remaining torpedo boats, they withdrew as well. The U.S. warships would engage several more MiG-17s over the next few days, shooting down at least three more enemy aircraft, they also continued shelling North Vietnamese ground targets and rescuing downed aviators.
