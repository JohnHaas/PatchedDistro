Waterford Kettering High School

Waterford Kettering High School (WKHS) is one of two public high schools in the Waterford School District. As of September 2009, 1,660 students were enrolled in the school.
Campus.
The football stadium, Jim Larkin Stadium, has grass and has stands for approximately 1500 fans. Each of the school's two gymnasiums hold stands that can seat over 900 for basketball and volleyball games. 
The Performing Arts Center, completed in 2004, includes band, choir, and orchestra suites with full sound systems, projector screens, and acoustic design fully implemented in their ceilings and walls.
Internet Suspension Case.
In 2001, the school suspended Joshua Mahaffey for postings critical of fellow students made on a private website. In "Mahaffey v. Aldrich", a federal judge overruled the suspension in 2002. The 143-day suspension stemmed from Mr. Mahaffrey's posting of a "people I wish would die list." The list named fellow students, but no faculty or staff of the school.
Extracurricular activities.
Athletics.
Waterford Kettering fields teams in baseball, basketball, bowling, cheerleading, cross country, football, golf, hockey, lacrosse, skiing, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track, volleyball, diving, and wrestling.

Charles Town Mining, Manufacturing, and Improvement Company Building

The Charles Town Mining, Manufacturing, and Improvement Company Building in Ranson, Jefferson County, West Virginia is a Romanesque Revival building that now serves as Ranson's City Hall. It was built for the Charles Town Mining, Manufacturing and Improvement Company (CMM&I) in 1891 as its headquarters. The CMM&I sought to develop industry in the area that in 1910 became the City of Ranson. The company was formed in 1890 by Roger Preston Chew, Frank Beck, Forrest W. Brown, T.C. Green, W.F. Lippitt, A.W. McDonald and B. C. Washington, with Chew as president. Using of land purchased from the Ranson family, a planned community was laid out by D.G. Howell, a Washington, D.C. landscape architect and civil engineer. In 1891 the 3½ story headquarters was built, designed by J.C. Holmes. 
By 1893 the CMM&I was facing hard times, possibly as a result of the Panic of 1893, and the headquarters was sold to the Board of Education of Charles Town, and served as Charles Town High School from 1893 to 1912. The school was sometimes known as the "Keyhole School" after its distinctive entrance, and as the Wright Denny School. In 1917 the Board of Education sold the school to former mayor Gerard D. Moore, and upon his death the property went to H.C. Getzendanner for $4500. Part of the building was used as a confectionary and the north half became the Ranson Post Office. In 1936 the City of Ranson bought the building for $3000 as its City Hall, although apartments occupied the upper floors until the 1970s.

Charlie Hillard

Charlie Hillard (March 22, 1938 – April 16, 1996) was an American aerobatics pilot, and the first American to win the world aerobatics title.
Hillard formed the Red Devils aerobatic team in 1971 with fellow pilots Gene Soucy and Tom Poberezny. In 1979 the three re-formed as the Eagles Aerobatic Team, which they would fly as for more than 25 years, setting the record for the longest-running aerobatic team with the same members in the world.
In 1996 he was killed at the Sun 'n Fun fly-in in Lakeland, Florida, when the Hawker Sea Fury he was flying overturned after landing in a crosswind.
Early life.
Charlie R. Hillard was born March 22, 1938 in Fort Worth, Texas. At the age of 16, he secretly began taking flying lessons, having saved enough money working at his father's car dealership. He would purchase his first airplane, a Piper Cub a few years later, while attending Georgia Tech.
In 1958, at the age of 20, Hillard joined the US skydiving team, and became the first person in the US to pass a baton in freefall. The same year, he began flying aerobatics at airshows. In 1967, he won the National Aerobatic Championship, In 1970 he competed in the Spinks Akromaster, and aircraft of his own design, and in 1972, won the World Aerobatics Championship, the first American ever to do so.
Eagles Aerobatic Team.
Hillard formed the Red Devils Aerobatic Team in 1971, with fellow pilots Gene Soucy and Tom Poberezny. The Red Devils flew the Pitts Special aircraft, and were a popular draw at airshows around the country. In 1979, aircraft designer Frank Christensen invited the team to test fly a new aerobatic aircraft he had designed: the Christen Eagle. The Devils were so impressed that they switched their team aircraft to the Eagle, and renamed the Red Devils to the Eagles Aerobatic Team, with Charlie Hillard as the lead pilot. The Eagles Aerobatic Team would fly together for more than 25 years, and 1000 performances, setting a record for the longest-running aerobatic team with the same members.
During this time, Hillard also flew as a pilot for Hollywood, in the movies and "Cloud Dancer", as well as the TV movie "Skyward".
Later career and death.
In 1995, the Eagles team disbanded. Hillard began to fly solo performances in a Hawker Sea Fury. It was in this aircraft that he was killed on April 16, 1996, when the aircraft flipped over upon landing, following an aerobatic performance at the Sun 'n Fun fly-in in Lakeland Florida. He had over 15,000 hours of flight time at the time of his death. Hillard's Sea Fury was rebuilt and is owned by Joe Thibodeau of Denver, who entered the aircraft as race #21. His 1931 Great Lakes 2T1E has been restored in 2011 and attends airshows. Hillards' Pitts and Christen Biplanes are on display at the EAA AirVenture Museum in Oshkosh, Wisconsin.

One Last Dance (Spooks)

"One Last Dance" is the third episode in the first series of the British television series "Spooks". It first aired on BBC One in the United Kingdom on 27 June 2002. It was written by Simon Mirren, and directed by Rob Bailey. In the episode, Kurdish rebels raid a Turkish Consulate while Zoe Reynolds (Keeley Hawes) is performing a routine bugging operation there. The raid is later revealed to be a distraction by a rogue faction group. The episode's plot is based on the Iranian Embassy Siege in 1980. After the original broadcast, it was seen by over 7 million viewers in the UK.
Plot.
The episode begins with Tessa (Jenny Agutter) being followed by Johnny Marks (Christopher Fulford), a former asset and lover of Tessa who was thought to have been killed in a car bomb in Northern Ireland. Marks then visits his group, who are running Kurdish rebels. Zoe goes to the Turkish Consulate on a routine bugging operation, by posing as a date for a Turkish travel agent. During the operation, Marks's men and the rebels seize the consulate; Zoe is able to warn Section D of the threat, and the team are called in, including Tom (Matthew Macfadyen), who is to celebrate his birthday with Ellie (Esther Hall). The rebels strap the Turkish Consul with explosives on a balcony, and demand the release of their imprisoned paramilitaries from the Turkish government in exchange for the hostages.
While Tom plays negotiator, Tessa recognises Marks from CCTV and comes forward to Harry (Peter Firth). There, he learns that Marks once followed Harry to a secret bank containing the identities of every MI5 and MI6 officer, and is using the consulate raid as a distraction to break into the bank. Furthermore, Tara Welks, the daughter of bank owner Roger Welks (Jeremy Bulloch), is kidnapped. While Malcolm (Hugh Simon) and Colin (Rory MacGregor) create a fake news report detailing the release of the paramilitaries to the rebels, the Consul gets an asthma attack. The rebel leader, Leyla Bakhuri (Katie Jones) agrees to release Zoe in exchange for an inhaler. During the exchange, a team led by Danny (David Oyelowo) break into the vault and engage in a firefight with Marks's men; the gunfire alerts the rebel, who shoots Tom in the abdomen, wounding him, before the rebel is killed by a sniper. Tara is found, but Marks disappears. In the meantime, armed Police enter the Consulate and arrest the rebels.
Marks reappears in Tessa's house, and learns that during their time together, Tessa became pregnant with his child, until the baby died from a miscarriage. They then receive a phone call from Harry, who asks Marks to meet with him at the street below; Marks, who claims to have never broken his word, promises not to release the identities if MI5 don't stop him. Before leaving, it is revealed that it was his brother who died in the car bomb. At the end of the episode, Tessa finds that Marks has left the disc with the identities behind.
Production.
The storyline to "One Last Dance" was somewhat based on the Iranian Embassy Siege, which took place in London on May 1980. Writer Simon Mirren noted the episode was hard to write, since he had to add two main storylines and tie them together - the Consulate siege and the bank robbery. Mirren was concerned that adding too much dialogue explaining certain aspects of the storyline would make the episode "silly". In the original pitch of the consulate siege, the terrorists were to abseil down from the roof, but was changed in favour of a ground assault. The police officer in the Consulate, Steven Burrows, was originally written to conceal a gun, and feeling guilty about never using it, but was cut.
Katie Jones was cast as Leyla, one of the episode's primary antagonists; Jones was cast because the producers were impressed by her performance, and the accent she used during the audition. Some of the opening scenes were to involve the rebels speaking Kurdish, but out of the cast members who play the rebels, Karzan Krekar was the only one who could speak it; Krekar taught the other members how to speak their lines in Kurdish. There was some concern that too much Kurdish was spoken in the scenes, which the producers feared would draw away the audience; some of the dialogue was cut down for filming. Furthermore, some of the additional scenes with Kurdish being spoken was actually improvised. An actual news anchor from "London Today" was cast for the news reports in the background; the producers used an actual anchor to make the report more believable.
The episode was filmed after the following episode, "Traitor's Gate". Filming took two weeks to complete. The methods of Marks following Tessa in the beginning of the episode was suggested by an ex-MI5 officer, who was a source for the series. Director Rob Bailey taught Keeley Hawes how to lockpick a door for Zoe's operation. Parts of the episode was filmed where Matthew Macfadyen wore sunglasses. The reasoning is that Macfadyen burst a blood vessel on one of his eyes, and the sunglasses were used to hide it; they would be used again for episode 5, "The Rose Bed Memoirs". The Turkish Consulate were filmed in two separate locations; the interior was mainly filmed in a local council building, while the exterior was filmed in a building in Roehampton. Three camera crews were used on the exterior shots.
Three hours of filming was dedicated on the top floor of New Zealand House with Macfadyen, Firth and Jeremy Bulloch. However, they filmed the scene at the top of the building, where heavy wind took place; the actors on set had to raise their voices in order for the sound unit to hear them. This is the first episode in which David Oyelowo used a gun. All guns used in the episode are real, but decommissioned from service. In order to maintain gun safety, at least two weapons experts were on hand to train the actors during rehearsal. The moment where the rebel is killed by the sniper was meant to include blood splatter for realism, but was cut because the producers thought it would be too violent.
Reception.
The episode was originally broadcast on BBC One, during the 9 pm to 10 pm time slot on Monday, 27 May 2002. After its original broadcast, the episode received unofficial overnight viewing figures of 7 million, and was the best performer in prime-time. However, ratings were down over two million from the series premiere, due to competition from "The Kumars at No. 42" on BBC Two and film premieres on Channel 5. According to the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board, the episode received final viewing figures of 7.3 million, placing "Spooks" the eighth most seen programme on BBC One, and the eighteenth most seen programme overall during the week the episode was broadcast. On 28 May 2002, one day after the episode was broadcast, Gareth McLean of "The Guardian" just said of the previous night's episode, "so good it makes you want to be a spy."

Brick Man

Brick Man was an Antony Gormley sculpture proposed for the city of Leeds, West Yorkshire, England.
A male human figure standing over 100 feet (30 m) high, it would have stood on a triangle of land bounded by railway lines in the Holbeck area of the city, greeting travellers arriving at Leeds railway station. It would have cost £600,000 and been the largest sculpture in the UK at the time.
The sculpture was one of twenty designs produced in response to a competition to find an artwork for the site, but the proposal was ultimately rejected by Leeds City Council in 1988. Conservative councillor Richard Hughes-Rowlands said at the time: "If Mr Gormley is talking about it ["Brick Man"] going somewhere else, my eyes won't exactly be weeping tears." 
Gormley has blamed "lack of nerve" for the rejection of his idea, adding: "I think of it still as my best attempt to allude to the collective body." The idea of an iconic landmark sculpture of the human form later saw the light of day in Gormley's Angel of the North.
A maquette for the sculpture can be seen in Leeds City Art Gallery.

Nathan Sassaman (b. 1963 or 1964) is a retired United States Army officer and the author of the 2008 book "Warrior King" (with Joe Layden) about his experiences in the Iraq War.
Raised in Portland, Oregon, Sassaman was an A student and the son of a Methodist minister who earned appointments to both West Point and the Air Force Academy, and was also recruited by Princeton. Choosing to attend the U.S. Military Academy, he captained and played quarterback on Army's football team in the 1984 season, in which he helped the team achieve one of its best recent records, exceeding all expectations with a 8-3-1 record. In a heralded victory in the annual Army-Navy Game, Sassaman ran for 154 yards and two touchdowns, and later led Army to a rare post-season appearance with a win over Michigan State in the Cherry Bowl. And reportedly, for much of that '84 season, Sassaman played with three cracked ribs. 
Long after his 1985 graduation from West Point, he served in Iraq as commander of the Fourth Infantry Division's 1-8 Battalion in 2003-2004 as a lieutenant colonel. He was awarded a Bronze Star for valor, which he earned for his actions when his patrol came under attack in August 2003. In this engagement, Sassaman had defied heavy machine-gun and R.P.G. fire to drag one of his wounded soldiers from his vehicle. Then he chased down the Iraqi insurgents and killed them. At that time, age 40, Sassaman was considered to be "the most impressive American field commander in Iraq." 
An incident in which some of his troops forced two Iraqi civilian detainees to jump into the Tigris River, one of whom allegedly drowned, led to a reprimand that effectively ended his career. He retired in 2005. 
He is married to Marilyn Sassaman and they have two children, Nathan and Nicole. They live in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Nathan is currently working as Quarterbacks Coach for Widener University.

Somatic evolution in cancer

Somatic evolution is the accumulation of mutations in the cells of a body during a lifetime, and the effects of those mutations on the fitness of those cells. Somatic evolution is important in the process of aging as well as the development of some diseases, including cancer.
Natural selection in cancer.
Cells in pre-malignant and malignant neoplasms (tumors) evolve by natural selection. This accounts for how cancer develops from normal tissue and why it has been difficult to cure. There are three necessary and sufficient conditions for natural selection, all of which are met in a neoplasm:
Cells in neoplasms compete for resources, such as oxygen and glucose, as well as space. Thus, a cell that acquires a mutation that increases its fitness will generate more daughter cells than competitor cells that lack that mutation. In this way, a population of mutant cells, called a clone, can expand in the neoplasm. Clonal expansion is the signature of natural selection in cancer.
Cancer therapies act as a form of artificial selection, killing sensitive cancer cells, but leaving behind resistant cells. Often the tumor will regrow from those resistant cells, the patient will relapse, and the therapy that had been previously used will no longer kill the cancer cells. This selection for resistance is similar to the repeatedly spraying crops with a pesticide and selecting for resistant pests until the pesticide is no longer effective.
Evolution in complex biological systems.
Modern descriptions of biological evolution will typically elaborate on major contributing factors to evolution such as the formation of local micro-environments, mutational robustness, molecular degeneracy, and cryptic genetic variation. Many of these contributing factors in evolution have been isolated and described for cancer.
Multilevel selection.
Cancer is a classic example of what evolutionary biologists call multilevel selection: at the level of the organism, cancer is usually fatal so there is selection for genes and the organization of tissues that suppress cancer. At the level of the cell, there is selection for increased cell proliferation and survival, such that a mutant cell that acquires one of the hallmarks of cancer (see below), will have a competitive advantage over cells that have not acquired the hallmark. Thus, at the level of the cell there is selection for cancer.
History.
Pre-Nowell & Cairns.
The earliest ideas about neoplastic evolution come from Boveri who proposed that tumors originated in chromosomal abnormalities passed on to daughter cells. In the decades that followed, cancer was recognized as having a clonal origin associated with chromosomal aberrations.
Early mathematical modeling of cancer, by Armitage and Doll, set the stage for the future development of the somatic evolutionary theory of cancer. Armitage and Doll explained the cancer incidence data, as a function of age, as a process of the sequential accumulation of somatic mutations (or other rate limiting steps).
Advances in cytogenetics facilitated discovery of chromosome abnormalities in neoplasms, including the Philadelphia chromosome in chronic myelogenous leukemia and translocations in acute myeloblastic leukemia. Sequences of karyotypes replacing one another in a tumor were observed as it progressed. Researchers hypothesized that cancer evolves in a sequence of chromosomal mutations and selection and that therapy may further select clones.
Knudson, Cairns, and Nowell.
In 1971, Knudson published the 2-hit hypothesis for mutation and cancer based on statistical analysis of inherited and sporadic cases of retinoblastoma. He postulated that retinoblastoma developed as a consequence of two mutations; one of which could be inherited or somatic followed by a second somatic mutation. Cytogenetic studies localized the region to the long arm of chromosome 13, and molecular genetic studies demonstrated that tumorigenesis was associated with chromosomal mechanisms, such as mitotic recombination or non-disjunction, that could lead to homozygosity of the mutation. The retinoblastoma gene was the first tumor suppressor gene to be cloned in 1986.
Cairns hypothesized a different, but complementary, mechanism of tumor suppression in 1975 based on tissue architecture to protect against selection of variant somatic cells with increased fitness in proliferating epithelial populations, such as the intestine and other epithelial organs. He postulated that this could be accomplished by restricting the number of stem cells for example at the base of intestinal crypts and restraining the opportunities for competition between cells by shedding differentiated intestinal cells into the gut. The essential predictions of this model have been confirmed although mutations in some tumor suppressor genes, including CDKN2A (p16), predispose to clonal expansions that encompass large numbers of crypts in some conditions such as Barrett’s esophagus. He also postulated an immortal DNA strand that is discussed at Immortal DNA strand hypothesis.
Nowell synthesized the evolutionary view of cancer in 1976 as a process of genetic instability and natural selection. Most of the alterations that occur are deleterious for the cell, and those clones will tend to go extinct, but occasional selectively advantageous mutations arise that lead to clonal expansions. This theory predicts a unique genetic composition in each neoplasm due to the random process of mutations, genetic polymorphisms in the human population, and differences in the selection pressures of the neoplasm’s microenvironment. Interventions are predicted to have varying results in different patients. What is more important, the theory predicts the emergence of resistant clones under the selective pressures of therapy. Since 1976, researchers have identified clonal expansions and genetic heterogeneity 
within many different types of neoplasms.
Somatic evolution in progression.
Genetic heterogeneity in neoplasms.
There are multiple levels of genetic heterogeneity associated with cancer, including single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), sequence mutations, Microsatellite shifts and instability, Loss of heterozygosity (LOH), Copy number variation (detected both by Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH), and array CGH,) and karyotypic variations including chromosome structural aberrations and aneuploidy. Studies of this issue have focused mainly at the gene mutation level, as copy number variation, LOH and specific chromosomal translocations are explained in the context of gene mutation. It is thus necessary to integrate multiple levels of genetic variation in the context of complex system and multilevel selection.
System instability is a major contributing factor for genetic heterogeneity. For the majority of cancers, genome instability is reflected in a large frequency of mutations in the whole genome DNA sequence (not just the protein coding regions that are only 1.5% of the genome). In whole genome sequencing of different types of cancers, large numbers of mutations were found in two breast cancers (about 20,000 point mutations), 25 melanomas (9,000 to 333,000 point mutations) and a lung cancer (50,000 point mutations and 54,000 small additions and deletions). Genome instability is also referred to as an enabling characteristic for achieving endpoints of cancer evolution.
Many of the somatic evolutionary studies have traditionally been focused on clonal expansion, as recurrent types of changes can be traced to illustrate the evolutionary path based on available methods. Recent studies from both direct DNA sequencing and karyotype analysis illustrate the importance of the high level of heterogeneity in somatic evolution. For the formation of solid tumors, there is an involvement of multiple cycles of clonal and non-clonal expansion. Even at the typical clonal expansion phase, there are significant levels of heterogeneity within the cell population, however, most are under-detected when mixed populations of cells are used for molecular analysis. In solid tumors, a majority of gene mutations are not recurrent types, and neither are the karyotypes. These analyses offer an explanation for the findings that there are no common mutations shared by most cancers.
Somatic evolution by epigenetics.
The state of a cell may be changed epigenetically, in addition to genetic alterations. The best-understood epigenetic alterations in tumors are the silencing or expression of genes by changes in the methylation of CG pairs of nucleotides in the promoter regions of the genes. These methylation patterns are copied to the new chromosomes when cells replicate their genomes and so methylation alterations are heritable and subject to natural selection. Methylation changes are thought to occur more frequently than mutations in the DNA, and so may account for many of the changes during neoplastic progression (the process by which normal tissue becomes cancerous), in particular in the early stages. For instance, when loss of expression of the DNA repair protein MGMT occurs in a colon cancer, it is caused by a mutation only about 4% of the time, while in most cases the loss is due to methylation of its promoter region. Similarly, when loss of expression of the DNA repair protein PMS2 occurs in colon cancer, it is caused by a mutation about 5% of the time, while in most cases loss of expression is due to methylation of the promoter of its pairing partner MLH1 (PMS2 is unstable in the absence of MLH1). Epigenetic changes in progression interact with genetic changes. For example, epigenetic silencing of genes responsible for the repair of mispairs or damages in the DNA (e.g. MLH1 or MSH2) results in an increase of genetic mutations.
Deficiency of DNA repair proteins PMS2, MLH1, MSH2, MSH3, MSH6 or BRCA2 can cause up to 100-fold increases in mutation frequency Epigenetic deficiencies in DNA repair gene protein expression have been found in many cancers, though not all deficiencies have been evaluated in all cancers. Epigeneticically deficient DNA repair proteins include BRCA1, WRN, MGMT, MLH1, MSH2, ERCC1, PMS2, XPF, P53, PCNA and OGG1, and these are found to be deficient at frequencies of 13% to 100% in different cancers (Also see DNA repair epigenetics in cancer.)
In addition to well studied epigenetic promoter methylation, more recently there have been substantial findings of epigenetic alterations in cancer due to changes in histone and chromatin architecture and alterations in the expression of microRNAs (microRNAs either cause degradation of messenger RNAs or block their translation) For instance, hypomethylation of the promoter for microRNA miR-155 increases expression of miR-155, and this increased miR-155 targets DNA repair genes MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6, causing each of them to have reduced expression.
Clonal expansions.
One common feature of neoplastic progression is the expansion of a clone with a genetic or epigenetic alteration. This may be a matter of chance, but is more likely due to the expanding clone having a competitive advantage (either a reproductive or survival advantage) over other cells in the tissue. Since clones often have many genetic and epigenetic alterations in their genomes, it is often not clear which of those alterations cause a reproductive or survival advantage and which other alterations are simply hitchhikers or passenger mutations (see Glossary below) on the clonal expansion.
Clonal expansions are most often associated with the loss of the p53 (TP53) or p16 (CDKN2A/INK4a) tumor suppressor genes. In lung cancer, a clone with a p53 mutation was observed to have spread over the surface of one entire lung and into the other lung. In bladder cancer, clones with loss of p16 were observed to have spread over the entire surface of the bladder.
Likewise, large expansions of clones with loss of p16 have been observed in the oral cavity and in Barrett's esophagus.
Clonal expansions associated with inactivation of p53 have also appear in skin, Barrett's esophagus, brain, and kidney.
Further clonal expansions have been observed in the stomach, bladder, colon, lung, hematopoietic (blood) cells, and prostate.
These clonal expansions are important for at least two reasons. First, they generate a large target population of mutant cells and so increase the probability that the multiple mutations necessary to cause cancer will be acquired within that clone. Second, in at least one case, the size of the clone with loss of p53 has been associated with an increased risk of a pre-malignant tumor becoming cancerous. It is thought that the process of developing cancer involves successive waves of clonal expansions within the tumor.
Field defects.
The term “field cancerization” was first used in 1953 to describe an area or “field” of epithelium that has been preconditioned by (at that time) largely unknown processes so as to predispose it towards development of cancer. Since then, the terms “field cancerization” and “field defect” have been used to describe pre-malignant tissue in which new cancers are likely to arise. Field defects, for example, have been identified in most of the major areas subject to tumorigenesis in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Cancers of the GI tract that are shown to be due, to some extent, to field defects include head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), oropharyngeal/laryngeal cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma and esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma, gastric cancer, bile duct cancer, pancreatic cancer, small intestine cancer and colon cancer.
In the colon, a field defect probably arises by natural selection of a mutant or epigenetically altered cell among the stem cells at the base of one of the intestinal crypts on the inside surface of the colon. A mutant or epigenetically altered stem cell, if it has a selective advantage, could replace the other nearby stem cells by natural selection. This can cause a patch of abnormal tissue, or field defect. The figure in this section includes a photo of a freshly resected and lengthwise-opened segment of the colon that may represent a large field defect in which there is a colon cancer and four polyps. The four polyps, in addition to the cancer, may represent sub-clones with proliferative advantages.
The sequence of events giving rise to this possible field defect are indicated below the photo. The schematic diagram shows a large area in yellow indicating a large patch of mutant or epigenetically altered cells that formed by clonal expansion of an initial cell based on a selective advantage. Within this first large patch, a second such mutation or epigenetic alteration may have occurred so that a given stem cell acquired an additional selective advantage compared to the other stem cells within the patch, and this altered stem cell expanded clonally forming a secondary patch, or sub-clone, within the original patch. This is indicated in the diagram by four smaller patches of different colors within the large yellow original area. Within these new patches (sub-clones), the process may have been repeated multiple times, indicated by the still smaller patches within the four secondary patches (with still different colors in the diagram) which clonally expanded, until a stem cell arose that generated either small polyps (which may be benign neoplasms) or else a malignant neoplasm (cancer). These neoplasms are also indicated, in the diagram below the photo, by 4 small tan circles (polyps) and a larger red area (cancer). The cancer in the photo occurred in the cecal area of the colon, where the colon joins the small intestine (labeled) and where the appendix occurs (labeled). The fat in the photo is external to the outer wall of the colon. In the segment of colon shown here, the colon was cut open lengthwise to expose the inner surface of the colon and to display the cancer and polyps occurring within the inner epithelial lining of the colon.
Phylogenetic analyses.
Phylogenetics may be applied to cells in tumors to reveal the evolutionary relationships between cells, just as it is used to reveal evolutionary relationships between organisms and species. Shibata, Tavare and colleagues have exploited this to estimate the time between the initiation of a tumor and its detection in the clinic. Louhelainen "et al." have used parsimony to reconstruct the relationships between biopsy samples based on loss of heterozygosity. Phylogenetic trees should not be confused with oncogenetic trees, which represent the common sequences of genetic events during neoplastic progression and do not represent the relationships of common ancestry that are essential to a phylogeny. For an up-to-date review in this field, see Bast 2012 
Adaptive landscapes.
An adaptive landscape is a hypothetical topological landscape upon which evolution is envisioned to take place. It is similar to Wright's fitness landscape in which the location of each point represents the genotype of an organism and the altitude represents the fitness of that organism in the current environment. However, unlike Wright's rigid landscape, the adaptive landscape is pliable. It readily changes shape with changes in population densities and survival/reproductive strategies used within and among the various species.
Wright’s shifting balance theory of evolution combines genetic drift (random sampling error in the transmission of genes) and natural selection to explain how multiple peaks on a fitness landscape could be occupied or how a population can achieve a higher peak on this landscape. This theory, based on the assumption of density-dependent selection as the principle forms of selection, results in a fitness landscape that is relatively rigid. A rigid landscape is one that does not change in response to even large changes in the position and composition of strategies along the landscape.
In contrast to the fitness landscape, the adaptive landscape is constructed assuming that both density and frequency-dependent selection is involved (selection is frequency-dependant when the fitness of a species depends not only on that species strategy but also on the strategy of all other species). As such, the shape of the adaptive landscape can change drastically in response to even small changes in strategies and densities.
The flexibility of adaptive landscapes provide several ways for natural selection to cross valleys and occupy multiple peaks without having to make large changes in their strategies. Within the context of differential or difference equation models for population dynamics, an adaptive landscape may actually be constructed using a Fitness Generating Function. If a given species is able to evolve, it will, over time, "climb" the adaptive landscape toward a fitness peak through gradual changes in its mean phenotype according to a strategy dynamic that involves the slope of the adaptive landscape. Because the adaptive landscape is not rigid and can change shape during the evolutionary process, it is possible that a species may be driven to maximum, minimum, or saddle point on the adaptive landscape. A population at a global maximum on the adaptive landscape corresponds an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) and will become dominant, driving all others toward extinction. Populations at a minimum or saddle point are not resistant to invasion, so that the introduction of a slightly different mutant strain may continue the evolutionary process toward unoccupied local maxima.
The adaptive landscape provides a useful tool for studying somatic evolution as it can describe the process of how a mutant cell evolves from a small tumor to an invasive cancer. Understanding this process in terms of the adaptive landscape may lead to the control of cancer through external manipulation of the shape of the landscape.
"The Hallmarks of Cancer" as evolutionary adaptations in a neoplasm.
In their landmark paper, "The Hallmarks of Cancer", Hanahan and Weinberg suggest that cancer can be described by a small number of underlying principles, despite the complexities of the disease. The authors describe how tumor progression proceeds via a process analogous to Darwinian evolution, where each genetic change confers a growth advantage to the cell. These genetic changes can be grouped into six "hallmarks", which drive a population of normal cells to become a cancer. The six hallmarks are: 
Genetic instability is defined as an "enabling characteristic" that facilitates the acquisition of other mutations due to defects in DNA repair.
The hallmark "self-sufficiency in growth signals" describes the observation that tumor cells produce many of their own growth signals and thereby no longer rely on proliferation signals from the micro-environment. Normal cells are maintained in a nondividing state by antigrowth signals, which cancer cells learn to evade through genetic changes producing "insensitivity to antigrowth signals". A normal cell initiates programmed cell death (apoptosis) in response to signals such as DNA damage, oncogene overexpression, and survival factor insufficiency, but a cancer cell learns to "evade apoptosis", leading to the accumulation of aberrant cells. Most mammalian cells can replicate a limited number of times due to progressive shortening of telomeres; virtually all malignant cancer cells gain an ability to maintain their telomeres, conferring "limitless replicative potential". As cells cannot survive at distances of more than 100 μm from a blood supply, cancer cells must initiate the formation of new blood vessels to support their growth via the process of "sustained angiogenesis". During the development of most cancers, primary tumor cells acquire the ability to undergo "invasion and metastasis" whereby they migrate into the surrounding tissue and travel to distant sites in the body, forming secondary tumors.
The pathways that cells take toward becoming malignant cancers are variable, and the order in which the hallmarks are acquired can vary from tumor to tumor. The early genetic events in tumorigenesis are difficult to measure clinically, but can be simulated according to known biology. Macroscopic tumors are now beginning to be described in terms of their underlying genetic changes, providing additional data to refine the framework described in The Hallmarks of Cancer.
Clonal evolution and cancer stem cells.
Monoclonal theory of cancer origin.
The theory about the monoclonal origin of cancer states that in general neoplasms arise from a single cell of origin. While it is possible that certain carcinogens may mutate more than one cell at once, the tumor mass usually represents progeny of a single cell, or very few cells. A series of mutations is required in the process of carcinogenesis for a cell to transition from being normal to pre-malignant and then to a cancer cell. The mutated genes usually belong to classes of caretaker, gatekeeper, landscaper or several other genes. Mutation ultimately leads to acquisition of the six hallmarks of cancer.
Cancer stem cells.
The first malignant cell, that gives rise to the tumor, is often labeled a cancer stem cell.
The cancer stem-cell hypothesis relies on the fact that a lot of tumors are heterogeneous – the cells in the tumor vary by phenotype and functions. Current research shows that in many cancers there is apparent hierarchy among cells. in general, there is a small population of cells in the tumor – about 0.2%–1% – that exhibits stem cell-like properties. These cells have the ability to give rise to a variety of cells in tumor tissue, self-renew indefinitely, and upon transfer can form new tumors. According to the hypothesis, cancer stem cells are the only cells capable of tumorigenesis – initiation of a new tumor. Cancer stem cell hypothesis might explain such phenomena as metastasis and remission.
The monoclonal model of cancer and the cancer stem-cell model are not mutually exclusive. Cancer stem cell arises by clonal evolution as a result of selection for the cell with the highest fitness in the neoplasm. This way, the heterogeneous nature of neoplasm can be explained by two processes – clonal evolution, or the hierarchical differentiation of cells, regulated by cancer stem cells. All cancers arise as a result of somatic evolution, but only some of them fit the cancer stem cell hypothesis. The evolutionary processes do not cease when a population of cancer stem cells arises in a tumor. Cancer treatment drugs pose a strong selective force on all types of cells in tumors, including cancer stem cells, which would be forced to evolve resistance to the treatment. It is interesting to note that cancer stem cells do not always have to have the highest resistance among the cells in the tumor to survive chemotherapy and re-emerge afterwards. The surviving cells might be in a special microenvironment, which protects them from adverse effects of treatment.
It is currently unclear as to whether cancer stem cells arise from adult stem cell transformation, a maturation arrest of progenitor cells, or as a result of dedifferentiation of mature cells.
Somatic evolution in therapeutic resistance.
Therapeutic resistance has been observed in virtually every form of therapy, from the beginning of cancer therapy. In most cases, therapies appear to select for mutations in the genes or pathways targeted by the drug.
Resistance to methotrexate.
Some of the first evidence for a genetic basis of acquired therapeutic resistance came from studies of methotrexate. Methotrexate inhibits the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene. However, methotrexate therapy appears to select for cells with extra copies (amplification) of DHFR, which are resistant to methotrexate. This was seen in both cell culture and samples from tumors in patients that had been treated with methotrexate.
Resistance to 5-fluorouracil.
A common cytotoxic chemotherapy used in a variety of cancers, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), targets the TYMS pathway and resistance can evolve through the evolution of extra copies of TYMS, thereby diluting the drug's effect.
Resistance to BCR-ABL targeting drugs.
In the case of Gleevec (Imatinib), which targets the BCR-ABL fusion gene in chronic myeloid leukemia, resistance often develops through a mutation that changes the shape of the binding site of the drug. Sequential application of drugs can lead to the sequential evolution of resistance mutations to each drug in turn.
Gleevec is not as selective as was originally thought. It turns out that it targets other tyrosine kinase genes and can be used to control gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) that are driven by mutations in c-KIT. However, patients with GIST sometimes relapse with additional mutations in c-KIT that make the cancer cells resistant to Gleevec.
Resistance to EGFR targeting drugs.
Gefitinib(Iressa) and Erlotinib (Tarceva) are epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors used for non-small cell lung cancer patients whose tumors have somatic mutations in EGFR. However, most patients' tumors eventually become resistant to these drugs. Two major mechanisms of acquired resistance have been discovered in patients who have developed clinical resistance to Gefitinib or Erlotinib: point mutations in the EGFR gene targeted by the drugs, and amplification of MET, another receptor tyrosine kinase, which can bypass EGFR to activate downstream signaling in the cell. In an initial study, 22% of tumors with acquired resistance to Gefitinib or Erlotinib had MET amplification. To address these issues, clinical trials are currently assessing irreversible EGFR inhibitors (which inihibit growth even in cell lines with mutations in EGFR), the combination of EGFR and MET kinase inhibitors, and Hsp90 inihibitors (EGFR and MET both require Hsp90 proteins to fold properly). In addition, taking repeated tumor biopsies from patients as they develop resistance to these drugs would help to understand the tumor dynamics.
Resistance to selective estrogen receptor modulator drugs.
Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) are a commonly used adjuvant therapy in estrogen-receptor positive (ERα+) breast cancer and a preventive treatment for women at high risk of the disease. There are several possible mechanisms of SERM resistance, though the relative clinical importance of each is debated. These include:
Resistance to anti-androgen therapy.
Most prostate cancers derive from cells that are stimulated to proliferate by androgens. Most prostate cancer therapies are therefore based on removing or blocking androgens. Mutations in the androgen receptor (AR) have been observed in anti-androgen resistant prostate cancer that makes the AR hypersensitive to the low levels of androgens that remain after therapy. Likewise, extra copies of the AR gene (amplification) have been observed in anti-androgen resistant prostate cancer. These additional copies of the gene are thought to make the cell hypersensitive to low levels of androgens and so allow them to proliferate under anti-androgen therapy.
Resistance to radiotherapy.
Resistance to radiotherapy is also commonly observed. However, to date, comparisons of malignant tissue before and after radiotherapy have not been done to identify genetic and epigenetic changes selected by exposure to radiation. In gliomas, a form of brain cancer, radiation therapy appears to select for stem cells, though it is unclear if the tumor returns to the pre-therapy proportion of cancer stem cells after therapy or if radiotherapy selects for an alteration that keeps the glioma cells in the stem cell state.
Harnessing evolution in therapeutics.
Cancer drugs and therapies commonly used today are evolutionary inert and represent a strong selection force, which leads to drug resistance. A possible way to avoid that is to use a treatment agent that would co-evolve alongside with cancer cells.
Anoxic bacteria.
Anoxic bacteria could be used as competitors or predators in hypoxic environments within tumors. Scientists have been interested in the idea of using anoxic bacteria for over 150 years, but until recently there has been little progress in that field. According to Jain and Forbes, several requirements have to be met by the cells to qualify as efficient anticancer bacterium: 
1.The bacterium cannot be toxic to the host
2.Its population should be restricted to the tumor mass
3.It should be able to disperse evenly throughout the neoplasm
4.At the end of the treatment bacterium should be easily eliminated from the host
5.It should not be causing severe immune response
6.It should be able to cause tumor cells death through competition for nutrients. 
In the process of the treatment, cancer cells are most likely to evolve some form of resistance to the bacterial treatment. However, being a living organism, bacteria would coevolve with tumor cells, potentially eliminating the possibility of resistance.
Possible limitations.
Since bacteria prefer an anoxic environment, they are not efficient at eliminating cells on the periphery of the tumor, where oxygen supply is efficient. A combination of bacterial treatment with chemical drugs will increase chances of destroying the tumor.
Oncolytic viruses.
Oncolytic viruses are engineered to infect cancerous cells. Limitations of that method include immune response to the virus and the possibility of the virus evolving into a pathogen.
Natural selection.
By manipulating the tumor environment we can create favorable conditions for the cells with least resistance to chemotherapy drugs to become more fit and outcompete the rest of the population. The chemotherapy, administered directly after, should wipe out the predominant tumor cells.

SkyHook JHL-40

The SkyHook JHL-40 is a hybrid airship/helicopter currently in development. On July 9, 2008, Boeing announced that it had teamed up with SkyHook International, a Canadian company, to develop this aircraft.
According to company spokespeople, the aircraft will combine the best features of a blimp and a helicopter, and will be capable of carrying a 40 ton load up to without refueling. At long, it will classify as the largest helicopter in the world, and will be capable of flying up to without a load. The craft will use helium to provide enough lift to carry its own weight, and will use four helicopter rotors to lift the load and to propel the aircraft. By using both helium and helicopter rotors, the aircraft can avoid having to jettison helium after unloading.
In comparison, the CH-47 Chinook helicopter can carry a load the same distance, but can only lift a maximum of 10 tons.
SkyHook claims that the aircraft will provide environmental benefits over traditional methods of delivering heavy loads, as it will require less fuel than a helicopter and will not require building big roads for construction equipment.
The JHL-40, or Jess Heavy Lifter, is named after Pete Jess, the President and Chief operating officer of SkyHook International, the company that owns the patent for the aircraft.
The planned aircraft has yet to be certified by Transport Canada and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. Currently the aircraft's overall performance and layout have been established. The next major program milestone will be Detailed Design in 2011, which centers on the design, analysis and specification of all hardware, software and related aircraft and ground support systems interfaces. Boeing is designing and will fabricate a production SkyHook HLV prototype at its Rotorcraft Systems facility in Ridley Park, Pennsylvania. The new aircraft will enter commercial service after it is certified by Transport Canada and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. The first SkyHook HLV aircraft was scheduled to fly in 2014, on September 13, 2010 however, Financial Times Deutschland revealed that development was halted until an infusion of 100 million dollar in public funding would be available.

Gare de Strasbourg

Gare de Strasbourg is the main railway station in the commune of Strasbourg, in Bas-Rhin, France. It is the eastern terminus of the Paris–Strasbourg railway. The current core building, an example of historicist architecture of the Wilhelminian period, replaced a previous station inaugurated in 1852, later turned into a covered market and ultimately demolished.
Previous history.
Strasbourg's first railway station was inaugurated on 19 September 1841 with the opening of the Strasbourg–Basel railway. It was situated far from the city center, in the district of Koenigshoffen. On 11 July 1846, it was moved to the city center; a new building was designed (as a terminus station) by the French architect Jean-André Weyer (1805–??) and inaugurated on 18 July 1852 by Président Bonaparte. After the German annexation of Alsace following the Franco-Prussian War and as part of the general rebuilding of the town after the Siege of Strasbourg, the construction of a larger station (not a terminus station) was decided and began in 1878. Weyer's station became Strasbourg's central market hall in 1884. It was demolished in 1974.
Building.
The historical building of Strasbourg's current railway station was built between 1878 and 1883 by the German architect Johann Eduard Jacobsthal (1839–1902). In 1900, Hermann Eggert, architect of the imperial palace Palais du Rhin, added a special waiting section and staircase for the German emperor, Wilhelm II, now known as the "Salon de l'empereur", with stained glass windows by the manufacturers Ott Frères. The historical building was classified as a Monument historique (type "inscrit") on 28 December 1984. Prior to the opening of the high speed train line LGV Est, the station was refurbished by architect Jean-Marie Duthilleul (born 1952) in 2006–2007 and its size and capacity largely increased by the addition of a huge glass roof entirely covering the historical façade. The modernization of the station was bestowed a Brunel Award in 2008. 
The main hall is adorned by two larger than life statues of female allegorical figures representing Industry and Agriculture. They are the work of Otto Geyer. Geyer also sculpted the figured reliefs adorning the historical façade, both of which bear his signature.
The main hall also used to display two frescos by Hermann Knackfuss, painted in 1885, one depicting William I's visit of the fortress "Fort Kronprinz" in Hausbergen (now "Fort Foch", Niederhausbergen), belonging to the fortified belt around Strasbourg, on 3 May 1877 and the other one, as a historical parallel, depicting in Frederick I's arrival in Haguenau in 1164. The two works of art, called "Im alten Reich" and "Im neuen Reich" ("In the old Empire" and "In the new Empire") were removed at some point in the 20th century and are lost.
Services.
The station is the main station in Strasbourg and one of the main stations in France with 75,000 passengers a day in 2012.
Local transport connections.
The station also serves lines A, C and D of the Strasbourg tramway. The lines A and D stop in the underground station beneath the actual building, that was inaugurated on 25 November 1994 together with the line A. Line C (opened in 2010) stops overground, on "Place de la gare".
The following buses of the CTS stop at the railway station: Line 2, Line 10 and Bus à haut niveau de service G (from 30 November 2013)

Academics.
Baxter enrolled at Dalhousie University in 1887. Her primary courses of study were mathematics and mathematical physics. Despite the relative lack of female scholars in these areas, Baxter received her bachelor's degree in 1891. She received multiple awards at graduation, including the Sir William Young Medal for highest standing in mathematics and mathematical physics.
Baxter completed her master's degree at Dalhousie in 1892.
From 1892 to 1894, Baxter held a fellowship at Cornell University in New York. On the completion of her thesis, "On Abelian integrals, a resume of Neumann’s ‘Abelsche Integrele’ with comments and applications," she became the second Canadian woman and the fourth woman on the North American continent to receive a Ph.D. in mathematics.
Non-Academic Life.
Agnes Sime Baxter was born on March 18, 1870 in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The Baxter family had immigrated to Canada from Scotland. Her father, Robert Baxter, was manager of the Halifax Gas Light Company, having managed a Scottish electric light company before moving to Nova Scotia.
Agnes Baxter married Dr. Albert Ross Hill on August 20, 1896. The marriage produced two daughters. Mrs. Ross Hill chose not to teach at the institutions where her husband was a professor, although Albert credited her with assisting him in his work.
Agnes Ross Hill died on March 9, 1917 in Columbia, Missouri after protracted illness.

Frank Cobden

Frank Carroll Cobden (14 October 1849 – 7 December 1932) was an English cricketer who played for Cambridge University and the MCC. In the University Match of 1870 he famously took a hat-trick comprising the last three Oxford University batsmen when Oxford required only three more runs to win. Thus Cambridge University won by two runs a match which they had seemed certain to lose. This feat led to the 1870 match becoming known as "Cobden's Match".
Early life and education.
Born 14 October 1849, Marylebone, London, Cobden was educated at Brighton College and Harrow before entering Trinity College, Cambridge in 1869. He transferred to Downing College in 1871. In later life he was a Justice of the Peace for Radnorshire.
Cricket career.
His first-class career lasted only from 1870 to 1872, for he played no more at first-class level after leaving Cambridge. As well as the university, he also appeared for MCC. He was a right-arm roundarm fast bowler and a right-handed batsman. In 22 matches he took 65 wickets at an average of 17.20, with best innings figures of 6/35. He took five or more wickets in an innings four times and ten or more wickets in a match once. He made 471 runs at an average of 14.27. He passed fifty only once, when he scored 73 not out. According to "Wisden" he was a "free and powerful hitter".
His brother, H.S. Cobden, also played first-class cricket.
The 1870 University Match.
The match, scheduled for three days, was finished in two. Cambridge scored 147 in their first innings. Oxford made 175 in reply, with Cobden taking 4/41. Cambridge slumped to 40/5 in their second innings, only 12 runs ahead, with C.K. Francis doing most of the damage. W. Yardley then came in to join J.W. Dale, and they added 116 for the sixth wicket. Yardley made exactly 100, the first hundred ever made in the fixture. Dale scored 67. Cambridge finished with 206, with Francis taking 7/102.
Oxford needed 179 to win. Cobden took the wicket of W.H. Hadow for a duck and Oxford were 0/1. However they recovered and reached 153/3 at one point, needing only another 26, thanks to 69 from C.J. Ottaway and 44 from A.T. Fortescue. Though wickets then began to fall, they progressed to 175/6, and their victory seemed assured. At that point E.E. Ward dismissed Francis. Ward had taken six of the seven wickets to fall. He finished with the fine figures of 6/29 from 32 four ball overs.
When Cobden began what proved to be the final over, the score was still 175/7, with four runs needed to win. From the first ball, F.H. Hill played a shot which seemed sure to reach the boundary and thus to win the match. However it was brilliantly fielded and the batsmen could only run one. Hill then had to watch the tail-enders try to cope with Cobden in poor light. S.E. Butler was caught off the second ball of the over and T.H. Belcher was bowled by the third. With four ball overs at that time, Cobden had one ball left. If the batsman, W.A. Stewart, could survive it, then Hill would face the next over and would probably see Oxford home. But Cobden made no mistake and Stewart was bowled. Cobden finished with figures of 4/35, and 8/76 in the match.
Cobden died 7 December 1932, Capel Curig, Caernarvonshire, Wales.

Juan Francisco Amancio González y Escobar

Juan Francisco Amancio González y Escobar was a Roman Catholic priest responsible for the spiritual colonization of the Christians in Chaco.
Childhood and Youth.
Juan Francisco Amancio González y Escobar was son of Captain Francisco González Durán and Josefa Antonia de Escobar y Gutiérrez.
He made his religious studies in Asunción, obtaining the Bachelor degree. He was self-taught in his intellectual formation, which made him deserving the position of Ecclesiastic Prosecutor and Examiner Synodical.
He had great knowledge of Roman and Canonical Law, he was also an eloquent orator and of adventurer temperament.
Career.
Father Amancio González, priest of Emboscada, was founder of the Melodía Mission, located in the colony Nueva Burdeos in times of Carlos Antonio López, later called Villa Occidental and nowadays Villa Hayes, capital of the Boquerón department, in the Paraguayan Chaco.
The name Melodía was chosen in homage of the governor Pedro Melo of Portugal, with the purpose of gaining his support in the consolidation of the evangelical project to subdue the natives of the region.
Amancio González was priest in Emboscada since he was ordered in 1761. During the twenty-five years of ministry he suffered along with the citizens, the constant siege of the natives of Chaco, who made that territory hostile, killing, stealing and taking Colonials prisoner.
He wrote in his diaries that the guards near the colonial establishments were insufficient because they lack the necessary resources to stop the attacks.
He thought that it was urgent to establish a population stable enough where he could reach to the natives and conquer with the Faith. He wanted to live among them, gain their trust and integrate them to the civilization.
The previously mentioned mission was established in 1786, thanks to the help of some benefactors and the resources of the priest, who suffered great loss of his patrimony.
The Town Council of Asunción found convenient the establishment of the Mission in the other side of the river, in the part north of the Confuso River. In spite of having recommended it, the help of the government was poor, limiting to the remission of 25 horses as official contribution to the project to convert the natives.
The surviving of the village and the provision of food was very important so the natives would not go back to their tribes or unite with other nations; nevertheless, the propositions of the governor for this effect did not obtained the Viceroy’s authorization.
Father González left Emboscada with two canoes filled with tools and supplies, twenty men and the constant company of Father Hermenegildo Rosas. Near Peñón he entered the Confuso River and in a place near the hills, he determined where to establish a small fort. In the highest hill he set a cross, symbol of his spiritual commitment.
This, apparently unimportant fact, meant the mark of territorial rights of Paraguay and later would serve the lawyer Benjamín Aceval to defend and ensure the rights over the land of Hayes.
Once the state was settled, the governors finally sent six soldiers to the fortress Peñón and cannon with four gunpowder charges and shrapnel, also a hundred bullets. Unfortunately for the Missioner, the soldiers arrived without provisions of food, and proceeded to consume the little reserve of food they had in the fortress.
The same happened every time the Governor made an official visit; he always arrived with his entire committee and made use of all the resources of the place, including horses and food. The priest could find the positive side of this “official visits”.
On December 1788, he received some hope when was informed of the royal approval that congratulated his labor. The joy was short-lived, because the economic support was never present.
The interaction with the natives was marked by intense suspicions and distrust that gradually was diminishing.
In spite of the friendly treatment, with the passing years, the natives Tobas and Machicuis became bold and proceed to steal horses and cattle, attacking the population constantly.
When the first states of white people settled near the fort, the natives Lenguas, Tobas, Machicuis, Pitilagas and Enimagas, attracted by the possibility of getting meat, stealing cows and horses, became even more usual.
Father Amamcio never ceased to try to accomplish better and friendly interactions with the natives, although without stopping to referring to them as liars, traitors and greedy. About him, Monsignor Agustín Blujaki, said that in spite the difficulties he had to endure, instead of being diminished his goodness, it only grew more every day.
Cattle was sent to Melodía from the nearby states of Emboscada and from other farer regions, but the permanent lack of security, due to the inefficiency of the troops the government assigned to the place to defend it from the natives, compromised the future of the mission.
“The constant stealing that is experienced here every day, every week, every month, and every moment. There is not a thing that remains save. Everything is stolen, the tools, the knives, the ribbons, the supplies. The only thing that has yet to be stolen is my inkpot” These were the terms in which he expressed his disillusion after he grew older and tired.
The unruly natives settled small family groups around the place with the only purpose of maintaining watch over the cattle ranches and watering places, from which they could steal the animals easily. They seemed unstoppable in their eagerness to commit robbery.
In between the regular administration tasks, Father Amancio received the annoying and constant pressure of the Governor to help the official commissions that were sent to explore the Chacho towards the Coast of Pilcomayo River, for which purpose he was required to give men, horses and cattle.
The fights among some tribes and the inopportune alliance of the Governor with the natives Payaguá, to which he entrust the coast of Chaco, lead to slaughters that made unbearable the life in the village.
Last years.
Twenty years after the river was crossed for the first time, the old and disappointed priest decided to renounce his position. He went back to Emboscada and died soon after.
Homage.
On August, 1904, the priest Fidel Maíz proposed to raise a monument in homage of Amancio González.
The Town Council of Emboscada agreed and raised in the Church’s square a wall with an effigy on bronze that prays: “In memory of Priest Amancio González y Escobar, illustrious missioner, great Paraguayan. Forever father of Emboscada”.
A renowned artery of neighborhood Vista Alegre, in Asunción was named after him.

Key (engineering)

In mechanical engineering, a key is a machine element used to connect a rotating machine element to a shaft. The key prevents relative rotation between the two parts and enables torque transmission.A key is used for temporary fastening. For a key to function, the shaft and rotating machine element must have a keyway, also known as a keyseat, which is a slot or pocket the key fits in. The whole system is called a keyed joint. A keyed joint still allows relative axial movement between the parts.
Commonly keyed components include gears, pulleys, and couplings.
Types.
There are three main types of keys: "Sunk", "Saddle", and "Tangent", "Round", and "Spline" keys.
Sunk key.
Types of sunk keys: "Rectangular", "Square", "Parallel sunk", "Gib-head", "Feather", and "Woodruff".
Parallel keys.
Parallel keys are the most widely used. They have a square or rectangular cross-section. Square keys are used for smaller shafts and rectangular faced keys are used for shaft diameters over or when the wall thickness of the mating hub is an issue. Set screws often accompany parallel keys to lock the mating parts into place. The keyway is a longitudinal slot in both the shaft and mating part.
Woodruff keys.
Woodruff keys are semicircular shaped, such that, when installed, leave a protruding tab. The keyway in the shaft is a semi-circular pocket, the mating part, a longitudinal slot. They are used to improve the concentricity of the shaft and the mating part, which is critical for high speed operation. The main advantage of the Woodruff key is that it eliminates milling a keyway near shaft shoulders, which already have stress concentrations.
Common applications include machine tools, automotive applications, snowblowers and marine propellers.
This type of key was developed by W.N. Woodruff of Connecticut. In 1888, he was awarded the John Scott Medal by the Franklin Institute for his invention.
Tapered keys.
The tapered key is tapered only on the side that engages the hub. The keyway in the hub has a taper that matches that of the tapered key. Some taper keys have a "gib", or tab, for easier removal during disassembly. The purpose of the taper is to secure the key itself, as well as, to firmly engage the shaft to the hub without the need for a set screw. The problem with taper keys is that they can cause the center of the shaft rotation to be slightly off of the mating part.
It is different from a tapered shaft lock in that tapered keys have a matching taper on the keyway, while tapered shaft locks do not.
Others.
A "Scotch key" or "Dutch key" also provides a keyway not by milling but by drilling axially into the part and the shaft, so that a round key can be used. If the key is tapered, it is referred to as a "Dutch pin" and is driven in, and generally cut off flush with the end of the shaft.
A Hirth joint is similar to a Spline joint but with the teeth on the butt of the shaft instead of on the surface.
Keyseating.
"Keyseating" is the creation of the slots in the mating items. Keyseating can be done on a variety of different machines including a keyseater, a vertical slotting machine, a broacher, either a vertical or horizontal mill, or with a chisel and file.
Broaching.
Broaching primarily used to cut square cornered internal keyways. The specific broach, bushing and guide are used for each given keyway cross-section, which makes this process more expensive than most of the alternatives. However, it can produce the most accurate keyway out of all the processes. There are three main steps in broaching a keyway: First, the workpiece is set on the arbor press and the bushing is placed in the opening of the workpiece. Next, the broach is inserted and pushed through, cutting the keyway. Finally, shims are placed between the bushing and the broach to achieve the correct depth necessary for the key.
Keyseater.
"Keyseaters", also known as "keyseating machines" and "keyway cutters", are specialized machines designed to cut keyways. They are very similar to vertical shapers; the difference is that the cutting tool on a keyseater enters the workpiece from the bottom and cuts on the down-stroke, while the tool on a shaper enters the workpiece from the top and cuts downward. Another difference is a keyseater has a guiding system above the workpiece to minimize deflection, which results in a closer tolerance cut. The process starts by clamping the workpiece to the table with a fixture or vise. The workpiece is properly located and then the reciprocating arm is started. Some models have a stationary table so the cutter is fed horizontally into the workpiece, while others have a movable table that feeds the workpiece into a fixed cutter. These machines can cut other straight sided features other than keyways (see the picture). They can also produce blind slots, which are slots that do not extend through the whole workpiece.
Milling.
Parallel, tapered, and Woodruff keyways can be produced on a milling machine. End mills or slotting cutters are used for parallel and tapered keyways, while a Woodruff cutter is used for Woodruff keyways.
For internal keyways that are not too long, the keyways can be milled if a radius is acceptable.
Chiseling.
One of the earliest forms of keyseating was done by chiseling. The keyway is roughed out using a chisel and then filed to size; the key is tried frequently to avoid over filing. This technique is long, tedious, and rarely used anymore.
Keyed joints.
Two parallel keys can be used either 90° or 120° apart from each other if the shaft connection needs to be more robust.
Improperly machined keyways that had cutter deflection or drifting occur, may not be strong enough for the required application.

Yaron Ezrahi

Yaron Ezrahi, born in 1940 in Tel-Aviv, is an Israeli political theorist and an Emeritus professor at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. 
He is also a senior Fellow Emeritus at the Israel Democracy Institute in Jerusalem.
Ezrahi is known for his work on the relations between modern science and the rise of the modern liberal democratic state and the political uses of scientific knowledge and authority. His latest work focuses on the deterioration of the Enlightenment version of the partnership between science, technology and democracy and the changing parameters of postmodern imaginaries and performances of the democratic order. His books have been translated into German and Chinese.
Theories and Works.
In Ezrahi’s publications between 1971 and 1990, he established the impact of the scientific revolution on the rise of the instrumental concept of politics in the modern democratic state and on its commitments to the transparency and accountability of power, the ideological neutrality of the state, deliberative public discourse and the rationality of public policy. Ezrahi has shown that despite such commitments, the political uses of scientific authorities and experts as political resources have often eclipsed the application of relevant bodies of knowledge in public policy. Ezrahi has backed up his claims by the analysis of the controversy over the relations between IQ group scores and genetics, the political uses of science indicators, the analysis of the latent selective process induced by civil epistemology and the political contexts of scientific advice. 
Professor Ezrahi's works since the early 1990s has concentrated on the changing interaction between science and politics in Post-Enlightenment or postmodern democracies. They include two articles on the impact of Einstein’s physics on democratic culture and the ironic implications of his esoteric theories on his commitment to participatory democracy; Ezrahi's entry in the International Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences; and his work on the relations between modes of reasoning and the politics of authority in the modern state. Ezrahi contributed articles on liberty and republicanism to the Harvard volume on the classical tradition. Ezrahi has investigated the impact of the shifty political imagination of the political order on the rise, decline and transformation of democracy. This research has evolved into a revisionist theory of democracy which combines the institutionalization of hegemonic imaginaries of order with their enactment or performance by political actors and the latent processes of naturalizing fictions into realities. This work has been consolidated in Ezrahi's latest book "Imagined Democracies: Necessary Political Fictions".
Most recently, Ezrahi collaborated with his wife, Professor Ruth HaCohen, in a book examining the voices of the individual and the voice of the many in the encounter between music and politics. He currently works on a comparative study of the respective roles of violence, political theatricality and the authority of science in legitimating political power.
Works on Israeli Politics and Public Policy.
Professor Ezrahi has been one of the leading academic interpreters of Israel’s politics and civic culture in the Israeli and international media. His prize winning book "Rubber Bullets, Power and Conscience in Modern Israel" examines the ways Zionism by increasingly promoting tribal values has come to devalue liberal democratic ideals of individual happiness and self–realization. The book provides a candid critical examination of the implications of the mounting tensions between nationalism and liberalism for Israeli attitudes towards military violence, political rhetoric, education and culture.
Ezrahi has published with his assistants at the Israeli Democracy Institute also policy oriented works in Hebrew on the need to reform the Israeli television, a book on the problem of cross ownership in the Israeli media and with Professor Kremnitzer a book on Israel’s Path towards a Constitutional Democracy.
Public Service.
As one of the leading authorities on Israeli politics and democracy Yaron Ezrahi has been appearing regularly as an analyst on the Israeli and the international media. He has written columns for the Israeli Daily Haaretz, The New York Times, and other magazines, and has been frequently interviewed by international newspapers and magazines such as Haaretz, the New York Times, Foreign Affairs, CNN, the BBC, 60 Minutes, Al Hayat, etc.
As a doctoral student Ezrahi served as an adviser on science policy at the White House in 1970, the OECD (1969-1970) and upon returning from his studies to The National Academy of Science in Israel (1973-1983). Ezrahi served also as a senior Fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute (1993-2003). In this capacity he cofounded The Seventh Eye, Israel’s reputable magazine for press criticism charged with guarding professional journalistic standards. As a Senior Fellow at the IDI, Ezrahi joined a small committee of scholars headed by the former chief justice Meir Shamgar which wrote the most elaborate and recent draft of a constitution for Israel. Ezrahi has been also a sharp critic of Israel’s foreign and defense policies. He has relentlessly warned against the corrosive effects of a lasting occupation on the Israeli democracy, legal system, political culture and civic education.
Family.
Yaron Ezrahi’s father Yariv was a leading musician, music teacher and critic. He studied music in Vienna, graduated and later directed the first conservatory of Israel in Tel-Aviv. His mother Hanna Diesenhaus was a curator and librarian in the early years of the Tel-Aviv Museum. His sister, Ofra, married to the noted archeologist and former director of the shrine of the Book Magen Broshi, was the director of a conservatory of music in Jerusalem. His grandfather Mordechai Ezrahi-Krichewsky was a Hebrew intellectual, pioneering head of the teachers association and coauthor of the first Hebrew curriculum in pre-state Israel. Yaron Ezrahi was married to Sidra Dekoven and is the father of their three children Talya, Ariel and Tehila. Since 2002 he is married to Ruth HaCohen (Pinczower), a professor of Musicology at the Hebrew University.
Education.
He graduated from Tichon Hadash high school in Tel-Aviv in 1958, completed army service in 1960, graduated in political science and philosophy at the Hebrew University in 1964, received his master degree in political science at the Hebrew University in 1966 and PhD in political science at Harvard University in 1972. Ezrahi studied at Harvard with professors Judith Shklar, Don K. Price, Michael Walzer, Louis Hertz, Everett Mendelsohn, Gerald Holton, Nelson Goodman and Karl Deutsch.

Wilmer Ruperti

Wilmer Ruperti (born December 7, 1959) is a Venezuelan-born shipping business magnate. Since 2003, he has captured a major share of the market in physically exporting oil from Venezuela to the rest of Latin America, and has become one of Venezuela’s wealthiest persons. 
"Lloyd's List International" described Ruperti in 2004 as a man who transformed himself from a shipping master into a leading player in Venezuela’s billion-dollar oil business, and that “everything Wilmer Ruperti touches appears to turn to gold”.
Career.
Ruperti’s career began in 1987 as a tanker master for Venezuelan oil company, Maraven, S.A., an industry affiliate of Venezuela’s state-owned oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA). He later studied shipping in Plymouth, England, before returning to Caracas, Venezuela, to set up his own small shipbroking firm.
PDVSA strike.
Ruperti's big break in the shipping business came in late 2002 when he shipped gasoline to Venezuelan ports, using tankers chartered from Russia, during the Venezuelan general strike of 2002–2003, which featured a strike by thousands of employees at PDVSA. 
The strike by PDVSA staff, which was designed to overthrow Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez, severely reduced oil production and exports, and cut domestic fuel supplies, before it failed. As a result of his successful shipping arrangements, Ruperti was able to consolidate his business relationship with PDVSA and the government. Although his business acumen earned him the disdain of the PDVSA employees who went on strike and were later dismissed, Chávez decorated Ruperti with the Star of Carabobo, a Venezuelan medallion usually awarded to military officers for distinguished service.
Shipping Company.
Ruperti’s ship-owning company, Suramericana de Transportes de Petróleo, owns a fleet of oil tankers and other vessels, and his ship management business is called Global Ship Management. Ruperti has become deeply involved in Chávez’s policy of shipping discounted oil to Argentina and numerous countries in the Caribbean. The Venezuelan business news portal Descifrado.com reported in June 2006 that Ruperti was setting up a maritime investment fund, and was planning to raise $500m for the construction of eight new oil tankers.
Recent business expansion.
Ruperti has recently moved into other areas of business. He owns a private television channel in Venezuela called Canal i, formerly called Puma TV.
Personal life.
In December 2006, "The Wall Street Journal" profiled Ruperti, who is of Italian ancestry, and quoted him as saying that he supported Chávez because he is “the only person who has identified himself with the poor”. The article also described Ruperti’s lifestyle, noting that he has two South Korean bodyguards, moves about Caracas in a bullet-proof BMW, owns a private jet, and in 2005 sponsored a charity concert held in Caracas by Luciano Pavarotti. Ruperti is a keen golfer and has set up a youth golf school in Caracas. 
At an unreported date, Ruperti bought two gold-plated Napoleonic-era pistols which were once owned by Simón Bolívar, the Venezuelan-born Latin American 19th Century independence hero, at an auction in New York, for $1.6m. It was later reported that he planned to donate the pistols to the Venezuelan government, but Ruperti denied this in his "Wall Street Journal" interview, saying he would leave them to his children. However, Venezuelan President, Hugo Chávez Frías confirmed that he received the pistols in national TV on July 2011. In said video, President Chávez states clearly that Ruperti "donated" the pistols.

Childhood and Youth.
He was born in Asunción, on November 12, 1933 in the time of the Chaco War. He was the son of Octaviano Rivarola Bogarín and his wife, Victorina Matto. He was member of a family of former settlers of Paraguay, very attached to the traditions of the country, which he loved immensely.
First Steps.

Point Clark Lighthouse

Point Clark Lighthouse is located on Point Clark. The lighthouse warns sailors of the shoal off the Lake Huron coast. The lighthouse is tall, made of limestone brought from Inverhuron by barge. Construction of the lighthouse started in 1857. There are 114 steps from the bottom to the lantern room. The 12 sided cast iron lantern was first lit on April 1, 1859 and is from the base of the tower. The Point Clark lighthouse was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1966, the first Ontario lighthouse to be so designated. The lighthouse was built by John Brown in the well-known series of the six Imperial Towers. To help build the lighthouse, several French builders were used. The light was first automated in 1924, but as a result of the poor quality of the light the original second-order fresnel lens was reinstalled. In 1963 the fresnel lens was automated. Its light characteristic is a single white flash every ten seconds, emitted at a focal plane height of .
The lighthouse is owned by Parks Canada. The lightkeeper's house is now a museum operated by the Township of Huron-Kinloss and tourists can tour the lightkeeper's home and the lighthouse from mid June to Labour Day.

Sandra Hutchens

Sandra Hutchens is the current Sheriff-Coroner of Orange County, California. She was appointed to the position on June 10, 2008, replacing acting sheriff Jack Anderson, who had led the department since the January 14, 2008 resignation of former sheriff Mike Carona. Prior to her appointment, she was retired from the position of division chief within the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. In the June 2010 California Primary Election, she won a majority of the votes and is currently serving her first full term as Sheriff.
Personal.
Hutchens was raised in Long Beach, California where she graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School. Shortly after graduating from high school she was hired as a secretary for the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department. She graduated from the Academy in 1978. 
She is a graduate of the University of La Verne with a degree in Public Administration and the FBI Academy.
Hutchens' husband Larry is a retired assistant police chief for the Los Angeles Unified School District. They have a dog named Tucker. In her spare time, Hutchens enjoys traveling, cooking, reading, and writing.
Controversies.
In her first year as Sheriff of Orange County, Sheriff Hutchens has made numerous changes to the Orange County Sheriff ’s Department , many of which have proven controversial.
Concealed Weapons Permits.
During the first few months after her appointment as Sheriff-Coroner, her department sent letters to many concealed weapon permit holders, indicating their intention to revoke those permits. The form letters, sent to over six hundred permit holders, read "The Department has determined that your identified risk does not meet the good cause threshold as required under the new CCW policy based upon the information you provided. As a result of this determination, the Department's present intention is to revoke your CCW license." Hutchens states that her reason for the revocation was that she believed "the prior administration stretched good cause" and issued concealed carry permits to political supporters and donors. Many counties in California, especially rural counties such as nearby San Bernardino County, consider a desire for personal protection to be sufficient good cause. However, the Orange County Grand Jury has come out in favor of the sheriff, issuing a report strongly condemning the Board of Supervisors for interfering with the responsibilities of the sheriff's department and determining that Hutchens' policy is legal.
Staff Terminations.
Seven former top officials at the Orange County Sheriff's Department filed wrongful termination claims against the county, alleging Sheriff Sandra Hutchens lied when she said they were laid off for budgetary reasons. The two former assistant sheriffs and five captains, including ex-Assistant Sheriffs Jack Anderson and John Davis, allege that Hutchens really laid them off because she disliked their job performance. A performance-based termination would mean that officers should have been given hearings they were entitled to under the state's 'Peace Officers' Bill of Rights,' according to the claims. Hutchens said she chose to lay off the top administrators to keep investigator positions, and that the layoffs saved the department $2.2 million as part of a $28 million plan to pare the agency's budget. But in the claims, the former employees allege their terminations did not save the county any money, and that Hutchens' command staff is now larger than before the series of layoffs.
Ballot Statements.
Hutchens was challenged in court in an effort to force her to remove false claims that she cut her command staff by 47%. Hutchens settled the dispute out of court, agreeing to remove the misstatement from her ballot statement. This 47% of command staff is a popular topic in that it was described by Orange County Board of Supervisor Bill Campbell as a "Bait and Switch" and her actions to remove this 47% of command staff and later expand her staff have resulted in a multi-million dollar lawsuit against the county.
Campaign.
At a candidates’ forum sponsored by Orange County Young Republicans, Hutchens repeatedly invoked the law for some of her unpopular policies, like not granting gun permits to people who aren’t facing a specific threat, or releasing some inmates early. “If you want more guns and CCWs (concealed weapon permits), then you should vote for one of my opponents,” Hutchens stated. She also took the opportunity to stress that the department has reclaimed its integrity and provided good service.

The Atlas of Pern

The Atlas of Pern by Karen Wynn Fonstad is an authorized companion book to the science fiction Dragonriders of Pern series by Anne McCaffrey. It was completed in 1984 based on the first seven Pern novels and collaboration with McCaffrey.
The Atlas is a large-format book comprising regional maps, chronologies for the seven published novels, local maps and drawings of "Hall, Hold, and Weyr", thematic maps on a world scale, and notes. The Notes are page references to the canon, a list of reference works, and an index of place names.
McCaffrey wrote in her "Welcome" that she had received in November 1983 "the first of Karen's renditions of my Pern, which rendered clearly what had been partially obscured by a myopic mind's eye: this "is" Pern! ... all lifted from the depths of my imagination and captured by Karen's draftsmanship and geographical expertise ...".
Fonstad had earned a Master's degree in Geography, specializing in cartography, from the University of Oklahoma, and worked as Director of Cartographic Services at the University of Wisconsin–Oshkosh before "retirement" to raising children and writing atlases of fictional worlds. Pern was her second, following "The Atlas of Middle-earth" (Houghton-Mifflin, 1981) based on the fantasy fiction of J. R. R. Tolkien. Her acknowledgments for "The Atlas of Pern" include "my husband, Todd, associate professor of geography", the UW Oshkosh Department of Geography, several UWO faculty members.

Pau de Bellviure

Pau de Bellviure () was a Catalan poet of the fourteenth and/or fifteenth centuries. To the Catalan and Spanish writers of the Renaissance he was a model of courtly love who had attained "gran fama" (great fame). Pere Torroella lists him among the "doctors" of poetry. According to Ausiàs March, his love for his lady turned him mad and he broke his neck and died, a martyr to love. 
"Pau de Bellviure" may be a surname, in which case his given name is unknown. In some manuscripts he is called Benviure, the name of a famous lineage. The castle of Benviure was later absorbed by Eramprunyà, an estate of the March family. In his "Prohemio a carta", the Marqués de Santillana begins survey of the history of Catalan verse with Guilhem de Berguedan and "Pao de Benbibre". There is mention of a Paül, son of Pere de Benviure, secretary to John I of Aragon, who died in 1417 without descendents, but this is probably not the poet. According to Guerau de Maçanet, Pau was a member of the noble Rocabertí or Cabrera families. 
Only one complete poem, "Dompna gentil, vos m'enculpats a tort", survives despite Pau's subsequent fame. It is a discreet "maldit" in which he attacks his lady for her infidelity. A fragment, "Per fembre fo Salamo enganat", of a lost poem by Pau is preserved in the "Conhort" of Francesc Ferrer. In this fragment Pau lists the names of famous men who were the victims of woman's lies: Solomon, David, Samson, Adam, Aristotle, Virgil, John the Baptist, and Hippocrates. In both his extent pieces, Pau comes across as misogynistic, but his light-hearted treatment of the subject and his use of irony assured his popularity. It is unknown whether he really died of love or it is a legend that merely arose from his reference to "la mort qui.m corre" (death that chases me) in "Dompna gentil".

Gunkholing

Gunkholing is a boating term referring to a type of cruising in shallow or shoal water, meandering from place to place, spending the nights in coves. The term refers to the gunk, or mud, typical of the creeks, coves, marshes, sloughs, and rivers that are referred to as gunkholes. While not necessary, gunkholers typically seek out the serenity of isolated anchorages over the crowds of marinas and popular bays, and a minimal draft is preferred, since gunkholers tend to go as far up and into the gunkholes as possible, seeking ever more inaccessible destinations.
Not all boating locales make for good gunkholing. The many inlets, bays, and rivers in places like the San Juan Islands and the Inside Passage can make for ideal gunkholes, as opposed to the relatively inaccessible coastlines of Southern California and Baja. Other locales well-suited to gunkholing include the Intracoastal Waterway, the New York State Canal System, the Chesapeake Bay, the Great Lakes and the many canals and rivers of Ontario.
Although comparatively little is written in English on gunkholing outside of North America, there has long been considerable interest in many regions around the world. The Caribbean and Central American coasts are famous for gunkholing opportunities and have been portrayed in a great deal of literature, including Ernest Hemingway's "Islands in the Stream." The sparsely populated coastline of southern Chile, with its thousands of remote islands and numerous channels, fjords, and coves, is an area that is seeing increasing gunkholing activity, particularly by sea-kayakers.

Prior to its publication in 1971, no work of wine literature contained high quality, wine-specific cartography. Some single-subject wine literature contained simple line-drawn maps, but not detailed, colour cartography with precise boundaries, and no book attempting to cover the world of wine had maps for every country. It was therefore not possible to open a bottle, open a book, and see precisely where the wine came from. This sense of place for wine is taken for granted today, but in 1971 it was revolutionary, and Johnson’s timing was impeccable.
Until the World War II, wine was the preserve of the upper classes in western Europe, and virtually non-existent in the U.S. due to Prohibition, but servicemen returning home from the European theatre brought with them the newly acquired habit of wine drinking. With the emergence of mass tourism in the 1950s and the greater spending power of the 1960s, a whole new generation visited France, Italy and Spain, bringing back the continental culture of wine.
America's taste for wine also began to develop in the early 1960s. The majority of these new wine drinkers were young, well-traveled, and relatively affluent and, as the Baby Boom generation came of age, so the ranks of wine drinkers increased. Never before, and never since, have there been so many new wine consumers without any knowledge of the wines they were encountering, and in 1971 "The World Atlas of Wine" was uniquely placed to satisfy that demand. With mass tourism on the increase throughout the 1970s, the demand for "The World Atlas of Wine" continued to grow, as there was no real competition until 1988, when "The Sotheby's World Wine Encyclopedia" (now "The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia") was published.
The Institut National des Appellations d'Origine, a French governmental organisation that avoids comment on commercial ventures, was moved to describe "The World Atlas of Wine" upon publication as "a major landmark in the literature of wine".
iPad Edition.
The seventh edition was simultaneously released as hardcover print book and ebook for the iPad using Apple's iBooks Author format (referred to as 'Made for iBooks' in iBooks). In December 2013 it was announced that the ebook was a finalist for a Digital Book Award. The ebook was also featured in the Best of 2013 promotion in iBooks.

<doc id="18399250" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18399250" title="Land Ordinance of 1784">
Land Ordinance of 1784

The Ordinance of 1784 (enacted April 23, 1784) called for the land in the recently created United States of America west of the Appalachian Mountains, north of the Ohio River and east of the Mississippi River to be divided into separate states.
It was adopted by the United States Congress under the Articles of Confederation.
Thomas Jefferson was the principal author. His original draft of the ordinance contained five important articles:
At the time slavery prevailed throughout much more than half the lands of Europe. Following an impulse from his own mind, Jefferson designed the ordinance to establish from end to end of the whole country a north and south line, at which the westward extension of slavery should be stayed by an impassable bound. On exactly the ninth anniversary of the fight at Concord and Lexington, Richard Dobbs Spaight of North Carolina, seconded by Jacob Read of South Carolina, moved to strike out the fifth article concerning the restriction on the expansion of slavery. Seven States and only seven were needed to carry the affirmative. Let Jefferson, who did not refrain from describing Spaight as "a young fool", relate what followed. "The clause was lost by a single vote only. Ten states were present. The four eastern states, New York, and Pennsylvania, were for the clause, Jersey would have been for it, but there were but two members, one of whom was sick in his chambers. South Carolina, Maryland and Virginia voted against it. North Carolina was divided as would have been Virginia, had not one of its delegates been sick in bed." The absent Virginian was Monroe, who for himself has left no evidence of such an intention. For North Carolina the vote of Spaight was neutralized by Williamson. Six States against three, sixteen men against seven strove to stop the spread of slavery. Jefferson denounced this outcome all his life. George Wythe and himself, as commissioners to codify the laws of Virginia, had provided for gradual emancipation. When, in 1785, the legislature refused to consider the proposal, Jefferson wrote: "We must hope that an overruling Providence is preparing the deliverance of these our suffering brethren." In 1786, narrating the loss of the clause against slavery in the ordinance of 1784, he said: "The voice of a single individual would have prevented this abominable crime; heaven will not always be silent; the friends to the rights of human nature will in the end prevail."
To the friends who visited him in the last period of his life, he delighted to renew these aspirations of his earlier years. In a letter written just 45 days before his death, he refers to the ordinance of 1784, saying: "My sentiments have been forty years before the public: although I shall not live to see them consummated, they will not die with me; but, living or dying, they will ever be in my most fervent prayer."
The ordinance passed without the 5th clause despite Jefferson's wishes, and was in force for 3 years. The ordinance was further augmented with the Land Ordinance of 1785, and superseded by the Northwest Ordinance of 1787.

Chilean national plebiscite, 1988

The 1988 Chilean national plebiscite was a national referendum held on 5 October 1988 to determine whether de facto leader Augusto Pinochet should extend his rule for another eight years. The "No" side won with 55.99% of the vote, ending Pinochet's 16½ years in power.
Background.
Army General Augusto Pinochet took power on 11 September 1973, for mandate of the Christian Democrats (Chilean), in a coup d'état which deposed the democratically-elected Socialist President Salvador Allende. Allende killed himself as the presidential palace was being bombarded. A military junta — led by Pinochet, Air Force General Gustavo Leigh, Navy Admiral José Toribio Merino, and Carabinero Chief General César Mendoza — was sworn in the same evening. The following day, the four drafted an official document suspending the 1925 constitution and Congress and establishing the Junta as the country's supreme authority. Pinochet was designated as its first President, and the four verbally agreed to rotate the office. Shortly after, the Junta established an advisory committee, which Pinochet was successful in staffing with Army officers loyal to himself. One of their first recommendations was to discard the idea of a rotating Presidency, arguing it would create too many administrative problems and lead to confusion. In March 1974, six months after the Junta’s establishment, Pinochet verbally attacked the Christian Democratic Party and stated that there was no set timetable for the return to civilian rule. On 18 December 1974 Pinochet was declared Supreme Leader of the nation. After that date, the junta functioned strictly as a legislative body until the return to democracy in 1990.
On 24 September 1973, a commission was set up by the junta to draw up a blueprint for a new constitution. By 5 October 1978, the commission had finished its work. During the next two years, the proposal was studied by the Council of State presided by former president Jorge Alessandri, and in July 1980 it submitted a Constitution draft to Pinochet and the Junta. A constitutional referendum, regarded as "highly irregular" and forthrightly "fraudulent" by some observers, took place on 11 September 1980, in which the new constitution was approved by 67% of voters. The Constitution, which took effect on 11 March 1981, established a "transition period," where Pinochet would continue to exercise the executive power and the Junta the legislative power, for the next eight years. Before that period ended, a candidate for President was to be proposed by the Commanders in Chief of the Armed Forces and Carabinero Chief General for the following period of eight years. The candidate was to be ratified by voters in a national plebiscite. On 30 August 1988 Pinochet was declared to be the candidate.
Plebiscite.
The plebiscite —as detailed in the 1980 Constitution approved on 21 October 1980— consisted of two choices:
Results.
Source: Tribunal Calificador de Elecciones.
Aftermath.
Following his defeat at the polls, Pinochet and opposition forces agreed to revise the 1980 Constitution. The 54 proposed amendments were approved by 94% of voters in a referendum on 30 July 1989. Presidential and parliamentary elections took place as scheduled on 14 December 1989. The opposition candidate—Christian Democrat Patricio Aylwin—won the election with 55% of the vote and took office on 11 March 1990. The newly elected Congress was sworn in that same day.
Popular culture.
The 2012 film "No" presented a fictionalized account of the "No" television campaign. To date, it is the only Chilean film to have been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

Montgomery Motorcycles

Montgomery Motorcycles was a pioneering British motorcycle manufacturer. Originally based in Bury St Edmunds the founder William Montgomery was an innovator and is credited with the invention of the sidecar. Following the first war manufacturing moved to Coventry. Like Brough, Montgomery made use of the best proprietary components from other specialist companies and concentrated on the production of frames and forks in-house - and Montgomery supplied a number of frames and its own sprung fork to George Brough. In an advert from the time Montgomery claimed "These Montgomery machines are for the men who prefer a distinctive mount in appearance and performance. That extra degree of soundness – those little touches which distinguish the 'super' machine from the mere motorcycle, come naturally to the Montgomery and at a price that is amazingly low."
History.
The first bike from Montgomery Motorcycles was a flat twin produced in 1913 with a Morton and Weaver engine. The First World War halted production, which did not resume until 1922 in Coventry Montgomery continued to experiment with sidecar design and actually competed himself in the 1923 Isle of Man TT sidecar race. The entire Montgomery works was destroyed by fire in 1925 but were able to eventually recover and by 1930 were a leading producer of quality two-stroke and four-stroke motorcycles. The top of the range was the Greyhound, finished in a special grey enamel paint. The Second World War brought an end to all production and Montgomery ceased trading in 1939.

<doc id="18399473" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18399473" title="Radio Pretoria">
Radio Pretoria

Radio Pretoria is a community-based radio station in Pretoria, South Africa, whose programmes are aimed at Afrikaners. It broadcasts 24 hours a day in stereo on 104.2 FM in the greater Pretoria area. Various other transmitters (with their own frequencies) in South Africa broadcast the station's content further afield, while the station is also available on Sentech's digital satellite platform.
History.
Radio Pretoria was founded in 1993 by the "Afrikaner Kultuurbond" (en: Afrikaner Cultural Union), led by Afrikaans reverend Mossie van den Berg. It was immediately controversial, as the South African government saw Radio Pretoria as a thinly disguised mouthpiece for the Conservative Party. The station management obtained a one-day broadcasting licence for 10 hours from the government, on condition that the programming is aimed at promoting the Bible Society of South Africa's "Bibliathon '94". Thus, on 18 September 1993, Radio Pretoria started broadcasting, after being officially opened by General Constant Viljoen, who later founded the Freedom Front Plus.
When the government found out that Radio Pretoria did not comply with the above-mentioned conditions, the Minister of Home Affairs rejected its application for another temporary broadcasting licence and, only three days after the first broadcast, the station was ordered close down. However, broadcasting continued illegally. On 21 September 1993, a barbed wire fence was constructed around the studio premises, while right-wing supporters guarded the site with firearms, to prevent the authorities from shutting down Radio Pretoria.
Over the next few months, the station was in a constant battle with authorities over licensing issues, while its staff continued broadcasting with or without permission. Occasionally, right-wing groups were still called upon over the airwaves to patrol the premises, as the police threatened to disable the station's equipment.
Alongside with few other radio stations like Bush Radio (Cape Town), Radio Pretoria took lead in changing the South African radio broadcast landscape to claim stake for community broadcasters. At the time, the state-controlled broadcaster, South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC), had a monopoly in broadcasting.
As of 2012, Radio Pretoria is still broadcasting and serving its community via numerous regional transmitters, satellite and Internet. Today Radio Pretoria is well established and utilises - as ever since its onset - top class voice artists and a host of reputable journalists to provide quality up to date content.
Transmitters.
Radio Pretoria operates 14 transmitters in towns in Gauteng, Limpopo, Free State, Mpumalanga, North West and KwaZulu-Natal.
On the farm Kleinfontein just east of Pretoria there is a 100m mast transmitting on 104.2mhz.

World Chess Championship 1951

The 1951 World Chess Championship was played between Mikhail Botvinnik and David Bronstein in Moscow from March 15 to May 11, 1951. Botvinnik retained his title.
1948 Interzonal tournament.
An interzonal tournament was held at Saltsjöbaden in Stockholm, Sweden, in July and August 1948. The top eight finishers qualified for the Candidates tournament.
The four players tied for sixth place were to have played off for three spots in the Candidates tournament, but Bondarevsky had to withdraw due to illness, so the other three qualified automatically.
1950 Candidates tournament.
The 1950 Candidates tournament was held in Budapest, Hungary in April and May 1950. The players who finished second through fifth in the 1948 championship tournament (Smyslov, Keres, Reshevsky, and Euwe) were seeded directly into the tournament, along with Reuben Fine, who had been invited to the 1948 tournament but had to withdraw for health reasons. Reshevsky, Euwe, and Fine all declined to take part. The remaining two (Smyslov and Keres) were joined by the top eight finishers from the Interzonal.
The co-winners then played a 12-game rematch in Moscow in July and August 1950. In the event of another tie, the first decisive game would determine Botvinnik's challenger for the title.
Bronstein thus earned the right to challenge the reigning champion.
1951 Championship match.
The match was played as best of 24 games. If it ended 12-12, Botvinnik, the holder, would retain the Championship.

Ehlers–Geren–Sachs theorem

The Ehlers–Geren–Sachs theorem, published in 1968 by Jürgen Ehlers, P. Geren and Rainer Sachs, shows that if, in a given universe, all freely falling observers measure the cosmic background radiation to have exactly the same properties in all directions (that is, they measure the background radiation to be isotropic), then that universe is an isotropic and homogeneous FLRW spacetime. 
Using the fact that, as measured from Earth, the cosmic microwave background is indeed highly isotropic—the temperature characterizing this thermal radiation varies only by tenth of thousandth of a kelvin with the direction of observations—and making the Copernican assumption that Earth does not occupy a privileged cosmic position, this constitutes the strongest available evidence for our own universe's homogeneity and isotropy, and hence for the foundation of current standard cosmological models. Strictly speaking, this conclusion has a potential flaw. While the Ehlers–Geren–Sachs theorem concerns only exactly isotropic measurements, it is known that the background radiation does have minute irregularities. This was addressed by a generalization published in 1995 by W. R. Stoeger, Roy Maartens and George Ellis, which shows that an analogous result holds for observers who measure a nearly isotropic background radiation, and can justly infer to live in a nearly FLRW universe.

Shift-invariant system

Shift invariant system is the discrete equivalent of the time-invariant system; defined such that if y(n) is the response of the system to x(n), then y(n-k) is the response of the system to x(n-k).
Applications.
Because digital systems need not be causal, some operations can be implemented in the digital domain that cannot be implemented using discrete analog components. Digital filters that require finite numbers of future values can be implemented while the analog counterparts cannot.

Sardarapat, Armenia

Sardarapat (), is a major village in the Armavir province of Armenia. The settlement was originally known as Sardarapat until 1935 when it was renamed Hoktember (October). In 1967, the village of Norapat was absorbed by Hoktember. However, the original name of the village was restored in 2009.
The name "Sardarapat" is derived from the major Persian fortress of Sardari Berd, built around 1810 by the last Persian Qajar governor of the Erivan Khanate; Sardar Hosein Qoli Khan Qajar, with British technical assistance using stones taken from the ruins of ancient Armavir. Many of the stones are still bearing traces of cuneiform inscriptions.
The town was set as administrative centre for the Sardarapat district and summer residence of the Khan of Erivan. The Sardar's fortress was taken by the Russians under General Paskevich in 1828, despite stout defense by Sardar Hasan Khan.
Currently, almost no trace of the fortress is left.
In 1935, Sardarapat was renamed Hoktember, Armenian for October, in the honour of the October Revolution of 1917.
The Sardarapat Memorial commemorating the Battle of Sardarapat is located in the nearby village of Araks.

SV Lohhof

SV Lohhof is a German association football club from the Lohhof district of Unterschleißheim, Bavaria, north of Munich. The footballers are part of a sports club that includes departments for athletics, badminton, gymnastics, martial arts, swimming, table tennis, tennis, volleyball, as well as fitness and rehabilitation programs.
__TOC__
History.
Established sometime in 1930 as "Sportverein Lohhof", the football team first came to notice in the early 1990s with an advance to the Amateuroberliga Bayern. After four seasons in tier IV play, "SV" won its way to the Regionalliga Süd (III) after a second place finish and successful promotion playoff in 1994. They took part in group play for the national amateur championship, but were quickly eliminated. An unsuccessful Regionalliga campaign followed and the team was sent back down. In 1999, "Lohhof" took the Oberliga Bayern (IV) championship to return to third division play for the 1999–2000 season.
The club then suffered through disastrous string of reverses; the finished last in the Regionalliga in 1999–2000, 18th of 20 in the Oberliga Bayern in 2000–01, and last in the Landesliga Bayern-Süd (V) in 2001–02. Their slide continued downward through the Bezirksoberliga Oberbayern (VI) and then withdrawing to the Kreisklasse München-3 (IX) in 2003. They won the division title there in 2006 to advance to the Kreisliga Oberbayern, München-1 (VIII) where they finished 12th in 2007–08 and only through a 4–2 win in the final relegation match did the "SVL" archive to stay in the Kreisliga for another season. The club's result in the league improved after that to the point where it won the Kreisliga in 2013 and earned promotion to the Bezirksliga.

Kleinfontein

Kleinfontein (Afrikaans for "Small Fountain") is a new settlement near Pretoria, South Africa that was founded by Afrikaners in 1992 as a "cultural village". It has only recently been developed and has a limited economy. It was founded by descendants of the original Voortrekkers or Boers who seek self-determination in an autonomous Volkstaat. The criteria to live in Kleinfontein are based on cultural, language, traditional and religious beliefs and are people who associate themselves with the Voortrekker history, the Blood River Covenant and other "historical facts relating to our struggle for independence for the Afrikaner people".
, it was one of South Africa's few remaining whites-only settlements. The settlement has been recognised as a cultural community by the Gauteng Legislature. 
History.
The land which would become Kleinfontein came to the attention of Afrikaner activists in 1988 during a celebration of the 150th anniversary of the Great Trek on a farm east of Pretoria. The farm drew their notice as a location of the Bittereinders and site of the Battle of Diamond Hill, as well as holding a historic Boer War cemetery and memorial. When the farm was put up for sale in 1992, a group of 50 Afrikaners purchased the property, and began to recruit shareholders to develop it.
In 1994, sufficient shareholders were recruited to service the loan and Kleinfontein could begin to provide services. The first two permanent houses were completed in 1996, and the first two families became permanent residents of Kleinfontein. In the ensuing years, Radio Pretoria erected its broadcasting tower on Kleinfontein, sports fields were built, a homegrown school was established and a savings and credit cooperative had emerged. A community hall, care center and retirement homes followed as well as a shopping center with an ATM. The entrance to the town displays a bust of Henrik Verwoerd, the "father of apartheid"; the community obtained the bust from a neighbouring town which no longer wanted it.
, the population of Kleinfontein is about 900 Afrikaners during the day, of which about 650 are residents and about 400 are shareholders. Kleinfontein's area has grown from the original 500 hectares to the current 860 hectares, and stretches just off the N4 highway beyond the Boschkop road.
As of November 2013, the Gauteng legislature recognized Kleinfontein as a cultural community. The City of Pretoria still refused to declare it a separate development or a formal township, although there is an ongoing process for Kleinfontein to become a separate recognized entity within the City of Pretoria. Following the legislature's investigation into Kleinfontein, there were 450 shareholders and 1,000 residents, living in around 300 homes. Article 185 of the South African Constitution allows citizens of a similar cultural, linguistic, or religious group to associate with each other.
Criticism.
Keinfontein has been criticised for its policy of barring all Jews, Catholics, non-Afrikaans speakers, and blacks from settling in the community. Protests were held in May 2013 when the community denied the application of a black man to buy a home in the community. The community has also been criticized by the South African government for engaging in practices that once led to a "divided South Africa." Residents of the community defend their practice by saying that they are defending their own separate cultural identity.
Some residents of the community have also objected to the "restricted" nature of the community which prevents them from selling their home to the buyer of their choice.
Geography.
The town is located roughly half-way between Pretoria and Bronkhorstspruit. It lies just south of the N4, just west of the R515, a few kilometers south of Rayton, on the Magaliesberg mountain range at the historical terrain where the Battle of Diamond Hill () took place during the Second Boer War.

<doc id="18399846" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18399846" title="Emmaus Nicopolis">
Emmaus Nicopolis

Emmaus Nicopolis (lit. City of Victory) was the Roman name for a city associated with the Emmaus of the New Testament, where Jesus is said to have appeared after his death and resurrection. In the modern age, the site was the location of the Palestinian Arab village of Imwas, near the Latrun junction, between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, before its depopulation in 1967. Emmaus Nicopolis was the name of the city from the 3rd century CE until the conquest of Palestine by the forces of the Rashidun Caliphate in 639. The site today is located in Israel inside Canada Park.
Location.
Emmaus Nicopolis appears on Roman geographical maps. The Peutinger Table situates it about west of Jerusalem, while the Ptolemy map shows it at a distance of from the city. This location is confirmed by ancient sources and translations of the Gospel of Luke (e. g. Codex Sinaiticus), which give the distance between biblical Emmaus and Jerusalem as 160 stadia. The geographical position of Emmaus is described in the Jerusalem Talmud, Tractate Sheviit 9.2:
From Bet Horon to the Sea is one domain. Yet is it one domain without regions? Rabbi Johanan said, ‘Still there is Mountain, Lowland, and Valley. From Bet Horon to Emmaus it is Mountain, from Emmaus to Lydda Lowland, from Lydda to the Sea Valley. Then there should be four stated? They are adjacent’.
Etymology.
In Hebrew, Emmaus was known as "Hammat" or "Hamta", which means "hot spring." Emmaus is mentioned by this name in Midrash Zutta for Song of Songs 6,8 and Midrash Rabba for Lamentations 1,45. The name was hellenized during the 2nd century BCE and appears in Jewish and Greek texts in many variations: Ammaus, Ammaum, Emmaus, Emmaum, Maus, Amus, etc.: Άμμαούμ, Άμμαούς, Έμμαούμ, Έμμαούς, אמאוס, אמאום, עמאוס, עמאום, עמוס, מאום, אמהום
Religious significance.
Emmaus is mentioned in the Gospel of Luke as the village where Jesus appeared to his disciples after his crucifixtion and resurrection:
That very day two of them were going to a village (one hundred and) sixty stadia away from Jerusalem called Emmaus, and they were speaking about all the things that had occurred. And it happened that while they were speaking and debating, Jesus himself drew near and walked with them, but their eyes were prevented from recognizing him … As they approached the village to which they were going, he gave the impression that he was going on further. But they urged him, ‘Stay with us, for it is nearly evening and the day is declining.’ So he went in to stay with them. And it happened that, while he was with them at table, he took bread, said the blessing, broke it, and gave it to them. With that their eyes were opened and they recognized him.
History.
Due to its strategic position, Emmaus played an important administrative, military and economic role in history. The first mention of Emmaus occurs in the 1st book of Maccabees, chapters 3-4, in the context of Judas the Maccabee’s wars against the Greeks (2nd century BCE).
During the Hasmonean period, Emmaus became a regional administrative centre (toparchy) in the Ayalon Valley. Josephus Flavius mentions Emmaus in his writings several times. He speaks about the destruction of Emmaus by the Romans in the year 4 B. C.
After the defeat of the Bar-Kochba’s revolt in the first half of the 2nd century CE, Romans and Samaritans settled in Emmaus. In the early 3rd century CE, a Christian scholar and writer born in Jerusalem, Julius Africanus, lived in Emmaus. According to Eusebius of Caesarea, St. Jerome, Philip of Side and others, Africanus led a delegation of local residents to the Roman emperor Elagabalus, obtaining for Emmaus the status of a city (polis) and the name of "Nicopolis," which it bore during the late Roman period and throughout the Byzantine period. As St. Eusebius writes, 
Emmaus, whence was Cleopas who is mentioned by the Evangelist Luke. Today it is Nicopolis, a famous city of Palestine. 
During the Byzantine period Emmaus-Nicopolis became a big city and a bishopric. A large church complex was erected on the spot of the apparition of the risen Christ, which served as a place of pilgrimage, and whose ruins still exist today. After the Muslim conquest in the 7th century, Emmaus went back to being called "Amwas" or "Imwas", but lost its importance as a regional centre.
During the Crusader period, the Christian presence resumed at Emmaus, and the Byzantine church was restored. However, the memory of the apparition of the risen Jesus at Emmaus also started to be celebrated in three other places in the Holy Land: Motza ( ca. 4 m./6 km. west of Jerusalem), Qubeibe (ca. 7 m./12 km northwest of Jerusalem) Abu Ghosh (ca. 7 miles/12 km west of Jerusalem).
The Arab village of Amwas was identified once again as the biblical Emmaus and the Roman-Byzantine Nicopolis by scholars in the 19th century, including Edward Robinson(1838–1852), M.-V. Guérin (1868), Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau (1874), and J.-B. Guillemot (1880–1887). In addition, a local saint named Blessed Mariam of Jesus Crucified, a nun of the Carmelite monastery of Bethlehem, had a revelation in 1878 in which Jesus indicated Amwas was the Gospel’s Emmaus. Thanks to this revelation, the holy place of Emmaus was acquired by the Carmelite monastery from the Muslims, excavations were carried out, and the flow of pilgrims to Emmaus-Nicopolis resumed.
Following the 1948 partition of Palestine to form the state of Israel, the village of Amwas fell within the West Bank territory under Jordanian control. However it was conquered by Israeli forces during the Six Day War of 1967, and its mixed Muslim and Christian Arab leaved, and the area became part of Canada Park.
Identification with the Gospel site.
Most manuscripts of the Gospel of Luke which came down to us indicate the distance of 60 stadia (ca. 7 m./12 km) between Jerusalem and Emmaus. However, there are several manuscripts which state the distance as 160 stadia (19 m./30 km). These include the uncial manuscripts א (Codex Sinaiticus), Θ, Ν, Κ, Π, 079 and cursive (minuscule) manuscripts 157, 265, 1079, 1604, 1219, 1223, as well as ancient translations into Latin (some manuscripts of the Vetus Latina, high-quality manuscripts of the Vulgate ), in Aramaic, Georgian and Armenian languages. The version of 60 stadia has been adopted for the printed editions of the Gospel of Luke since the 16th century. The main argument against the version of 160 stadia claims that it is impossible to walk such a distance in one day. In keeping with the principle of Lectio difficilior, lectio verior, the most difficult version is presumed to be genuine, since ancient copyists of the Bible were inclined to change the text in order to facilitate understanding, but not vice versa. One should also note that it is possible to walk from Jerusalem to Emmaus-Nicopolis and back in one day.
The ancient Jewish sources (1 Maccabees, Josephus Flavius, Talmud and Midrash) mention only one village called Emmaus in the area of Jerusalem: Emmaus of Ajalon Valley. For example, in the “Jewish War” (4, 8, 1) Josephus Flavius mentions that Vespasian placed the 5th Macedonian Legion in Emmaus. This has been confirmed by archaeologists who have discovered inscribed tombstones of the Legion’s soldiers in the area of Emmaus-Nicopolis. (The village of Motza, located 30 stadia (ca. 4 miles) away from Jerusalem, is mentioned in medieval Greek manuscripts of the “Jewish war” of Josephus Flavius (7,6,6) under the name of Ammaus, apparently as a result of copyists’ mistake).
The ancient Christian tradition of the Church fathers, as well as pilgrims to the Holy Land during the Roman-Byzantine period, unanimously recognized Nicopolis as the Emmaus in the Gospel of Luke. (Origen (presumably), Eusebius of Caesarea, St. Jerome, Hesychius of Jerusalem, Theophanes the Confessor, Sozomen, Theodosius, etc.

Carroll Thompson

Carroll Thompson (born 1960, Letchworth, Hertfordshire, England) is an English Lovers rock singer, best known for her work in the 1980s.
Biography.
Thompson sang in school and church choirs as a girl, but initially studied for a career in pharmacy. In the mid-1970s, she began working as a backing singer at several recording studios after auditioning for Frank Farian's Sugar Cane group. Eventually, Thompson embarked on a solo career, with early successes in the shape of Lovers rock singles "I'm So Sorry" (produced by the now London-based Leonard Chin) and "Simply In Love", which both topped the reggae chart in 1981, the same year seeing the release of her debut album. She won two GLR Reggae Awards in 1982, for Best Female Performer and Best Song (for "Hopelessly In Love"). In 1983, she won further awards, again winning Best Female Performer at the GLR awards. She also recorded duets with Sugar Minott ("Make It With You") and Trevor Walters ("Love Won't Let Us Wait"), as well as continuing with regular solo reggae chart hits.
Thompson opted to join the Sheffield-based jazz-funk aggregation Floy Joy in 1984 where she featured on one album and scored two minor hits with the soul ballad "Until You Come Back to Me" (#91 UK pop) and "Operator" (#86 UK pop).
Following Floy Joy, her releases dwindled reviving in 1990 when she provided lead vocals on a version of Diana Ross's "I'm Still Waiting", recorded with Aswad and Courtney Pine, which was a minor UK Singles Chart hit. She also enjoyed minor chart hits that year with Movement 98's "Joy & Heartbreak" and "Sunrise". In 1992, her "Let the Music Play" was included on the soundtrack to the film "The Crying Game", and in 1993, she worked with Neil "Mad Profesor" Fraser on the album "The Other Side Of Love". Carroll is married to Radio 5 Live presenter Dotun Adebayo.
Thompson has worked as session singer with Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder, Natalie Cole, Pet Shop Boys, Robbie Williams, Boy George, Maxi Priest, Sting, Billy Ocean, Chaka Khan, Aswad and M People. She is also the co-founder (with Adebayo) of Colourtelly, Britain's first black interest internet TV station.

Chalk line

A chalk line or chalk box is a tool for marking long, straight lines on relatively flat surfaces, much farther than is practical by hand or with a straightedge.
It is an important tool in construction and carpentry, the working of timber in a rough and unplaned state, as it does not require the timber to have a straight or squared edge formed onto it beforehand.
Use.
A chalk line draws straight lines by the action of a taut nylon or similar string that has been previously impregnated or coated with a loose dye, usually chalk. The string is then laid across the surface to be marked and pulled tight. Next, the string is then plucked or snapped sharply, causing the string to strike the surface, which then transfers its chalk to the surface along that straight line where it struck.
Chalk lines are typically used to mark relatively flat surfaces. However, as long as the line is taut and the two ends of the chalk line are in nearly the same plane, the chalk line will mark all points that the string touches on or near that plane once snapped. The objects to be marked do not need to be continuous along the line. Chalk lines can also be used across irregular surfaces and surfaces with holes in them, for example on an unfinished stud wall. 
The primary problems associated with improper maintenance of a chalk line are string breakage due to excessive tension on the line, and degradation of the line associated with moisture contamination. 
Chalk lines and plumb-bobs are often sold as a single tool.
History.
Chalk lines have been in use since ancient Egypt, and used continuously by builders in various cultures since. 
Continuing development of this simple but effective tool focuses on the coloration for the chalk or marking compound, as well as the outer case and method of handling.
Ink lines.
In East Asia, an ink line is used in preference to a chalk line. This is a silken cord, stored on a combined reel and inkpot called a "sumitsubo". Alongside the line reel is a cavity filled with ink-soaked cotton fibres, which the line is drawn through as it is unreeled. These sumitsubo are highly decorated and much-prized by their owners. As with many such tools, they're often made by their users while apprentices.
On the completion of a major building, such as a temple, a large celebration or topping-out ceremony is held. As part of this event, a set of symbolic carpenter's tools are freshly made and presented to the new building. A "sumitsubo" is a traditional tool included with them.

Ozone House

Ozone House, based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization funded by the United Way that works to "meet the needs of runaway, homeless, and high-risk youth and their families." Ozone House addresses these objectives through a variety of services and venues, including a 24-hour youth crisis hotline, emergency youth shelter, transitional living programs, a drop-in center, and street outreach. It is a state-licensed Child Caring Institution and a Substance Abuse Prevention provider. Ozone Houses offers support throughout the state of Michigan, but is focused more directly in the surrounding Washtenaw County area. The organization takes its name from the Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen song, "Lost in the Ozone" owing to its roots as a drug-counseling program. Historically, it is among the first-generation alternative service providers that emerged in the 1960s dealing with runaways and the needs of at-risk youth.
History.
The organization began in 1969 in Ann Arbor in response to the growing number of runaway youth migrating to "hip" towns following the Summer of Love of 1967. During this time, Ann Arbor was among the top 20 cities in the U.S. with a high influx of runaways. Many came to experience the counter culture of the '70s but would later find themselves stranded. Graduates and students of the University of Michigan, local businesses, organizations, and community residents united in support of Ozone House in order to handle the increasing number of street-dwelling and panhandling runaways. Most traditional agencies and police departments did not believe the stories of runaways: tales of harrowing physical, sexual, and psychological abuse. As a "counter culture" organization, Ozone House adopted a collectivist system to make its organizational decisions.
Ozone House was part of four main agencies in the Community Center Coordinating Council (referred to as C4) that provided services to youth who did not qualify for human resources services at the time or who did not feel comfortable engaging those established human resource organizations. Originally housed together with these other services, Ozone House relocated several times since its founding. However, unlike the other C4 agencies, Ozone House is the only one that remains autonomous and active to this day.
Response to youth runaway needs.
While initially providing drug-counseling to runaway youth, the organization expanded its services in the early 1970s to provide safe, temporary housing ("crash pads") for youth, many of whom found themselves in Ann Arbor with no means of returning home. Many staff at Ozone House were college "dropouts" who recognized the need to establish trust between their clients, and in keeping with the times and lack of funds, provided physical spaces that were "non-institutional" and casual.
As the runaway crisis drew larger legal attention, issues arose concerning underage runaways and their parents. One of its earliest approaches was a three-tiered system for housing youth summarized as ""crashing, fostering," and "moling";" Each targeted a specific situation and age of the youth. "Crashing" involved youths over age 17 who did not need parental consent and could be housed by listed individuals or families in the area. "Fostering" was used in conjunction with Catholic Social Services of Michigan in order to circumvent state-licensing issues and arrangeded for youth to live in state-licensed foster homes. Many of these new foster homes offered alternatives to traditional "foster parents" by accepting young homosexuals, the "streetwise" and sexually active. If such a foster home was available, the system utilized parental consent and asked for a voluntary small financial contribution to assist with the child's living expenses. The situation was unique because it allowed the youth to initiate hir services, rather than the parents or the state. The final strategy, "moling," recognized situations in which "a young person cannot get parental permission for Foster Care, the young person refuses to contact his/her parents, is an institutional runaway, or in other special circumstances." This third system allowed an underage youth to be sheltered regardless of the legal policies at the time. Counselors would ask a series of questions to determine if moling was the last (and most appropriate) option and if the actions could be justified pending legal action. "Moling" was recognized as a risky alternative requiring caution and staff were adamant that they be used solely for crisis situations rather than casual escapes from a youth's personal or familial problems. Staff viewed the third option as maintaining solidarity with the radical political changes in youth advocacy.
While helping to lead national advocacy to expand youth legal rights, Ozone House became the second agency of its kind to receive federal funding to address the growing needs of youth. This led to expanded services, such a free counseling, family intervention, and individual youth advocacy.
Changes.
By the mid-1970s, Ozone House began recognizing that the problems youth faced were rapidly changing. Among these were rising incidence rates of child abuse, substance abuse problems within families, poverty, and parental imprisonment. Likewise, runaways who left home to explore counter culture on their own were becoming replaced by youth who had been thrown out of their homes ("throwaways") and youth who had aged out of the foster care system and found themselves with nowhere to go.
To address these needs, Ozone began changing its structure, including phasing out its collectivist decision-making system with a more traditional board of directors. The collective system was officially dropped in 1995. Professional, degreed staff were hired to ensure their ability to handle the social, demographic, and federal aspects of youth advocacy and assistance. Ozone House also began an aggressive grant-writing campaign, acknowledging that competing for federal funding was becoming a reality for non-profits like themselves. Federal funding would also establish them as a legitimate service organization in the community and allow them to try "diversified models of delivering services to youth."
Ozone House staff and directors acknowledged that police and legal institutions were more comfortable and accepting with their approach toward at-risk youth. A Board of Director's meeting in 1974 noted that "House can't drift back underground after developing legitimacy in the community."
In 1984, Ozone House expanded its services by adding "Miller House," a transitional living program. There homeless youth could receive free room and board while attending school, working, and developing independent-living skills. Services continue to be added in the present day.
Services.
Ozone House offers several services to address the needs of youth and families through its main site in Ann Arbor and the Drop-In Center in Ypsilanti.
Main Site:
Ypsilanti Site:
Ozone House is composed of a Board of Directors as well as administrative, clinical, residential, and part-time staff and volunteers.
Partnerships, affiliations, and funding.
Ozone House is partnered with various community organizations, including the University of Michigan School of Nursing Nurse Managed Centers, Family Support Network, and Communities Empowering Youth. 
The organization's various funders include the Washtenaw United Way, the Arcus Foundation Gay & Lesbian Fund, the City of Ann Arbor, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, and the Salvation Army of Washtenaw County.
Awards and recognition.
Ozone House was awarded the "Best Managed Nonprofit in Southeastern Michigan" by Crain's Detroit Business in 2002. Other awards and recognition include "Exemplary Agency for use of Best Practices" by a Michigan State University study, "Best Practices in Transitional and Independent Living Services" by the National Resource Center in 2002, and three-time honors by the Nonprofit Enterprises at Work (NEW) Center for Nonprofit Management Excellence.
The University of Michigan's Bentley Historical Library established and maintains finding aids for Ozone House records. It was created by the Michigan Historical Collections staff.

Andrés Barbero

Andrés Barbero (1877 in Asunción – 1951 in Buenos Aires) was a Paraguayan scientist and botanist.
Childhood and studies.
Juan Barbero and Carolina Crosa, immigrants from Piamonte, reached Paraguay when the Paraguayan War had just finished. They married in Asunción in 1871 and had five children, the third of which was Andrés José Camilo.
Juan Barbero, severe and peninsular diligent, dedicated to the construction and recovery of the destroyed houses during the war. He gained an important fortune, becoming a solid landowner of urban and rural ranches. In 1910, he acquired a valuable house in España Avenue and extended as far as the railroad, present day Gondra Street.
Andrés Barbero was born in Asunción on July 28, 1877. He finished his pharmacy studies in 1898 and, in 1903, his medicine studies, being among the first people who received their medical diploma in Paraguay.
His wealthy position allowed him to dedicate himself completely to teaching, beginning with the National School and later in the same Medicine University, in the subjects of physical medicine, physiology and histology.
Investigation and philanthropic work.
He investigated a lot in company with other scientists like Emilio Hassler and Guillermo Tell Bertoni, and also the Paraguayan Teodoro Rojas. With them he founded the Scientific Society in Paraguay. His attachment to the botanic took him to the Natural History Museum, being able later to become the editor of Paraguay’s Scientific Magazine.
He financially supplied places where the organizations created by him worked: la Cruz Roja, the Cancer Institute, the Scientific Society, a children Hospital and an ophthalmologic centre.
He built a three story building in the corner of España Avenue and Mompox, to be the site of his scientific institutions that grouped there, with the help of the Barbero Foundation. The Natural Science Museum was also installed there, now, the Andres Barbero’s Museum and Library.
From the 1940s on: Other institutions were created: Paraguay’s Ethnographic Society, Paraguay’s Indian Society, the Paraguayan Institute of Historical Investigation, from the one later was created the Paraguayan Academy of History and Guarani Culture Society.
In 1941 he won the decoration of the Merit National Order as Great Official
Public life.
Andrés Barbero inherited from his father the inclination to work and the virtue of jealous goods administrator.
Death and legacy.
Barbero, single and with no offspring, died on February 14, 1951. The Paraguayan Government decreed a national mourning the day of his death.
The Barbero sisters donated all his goods to the La Piedad Foundation, created in honor to him. This respectable institution allows keeping in force the different associations that gather men that search the improvement of the social and cultural conditions of the citizenship, in time of paying homage to the humanitarian and solidarity of its creator.
In Asunción, there is a modest monument that evokes Dr. Barbero’s figure in Artigas Avenue and Brasil Street.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1981, and currently serves as historic house museum operated by the Bourne Historical Society.
Originally built around 1802 by Josephus Keene, the house was significantly expanded and renovated in the Greek Revival style in the 1830s by Briggs, who married Keene's granddaughter Thirza. He was later instrumental in the creation of the town of Bourne from Sandwich in 1884, serving as one of the new town's selectmen. Later he would serve on the school and library commissions, and chairman of the Barnstable County Commission.
He was a friend of U.S. President Grover Cleveland, who sometimes vacationed in the area . The shop of a local blacksmith who shod Cleveland's horses has been moved to the house property as well. The interior of the house has an 1890 ceiling mural painted by local artist Charles Raleigh.
After his death, it passed to Mercy Briggs McDermott and her husband William. They later sold it to the school district. In the 1970s the town worked to restore it, and in 1998 moved the blacksmith shop to the grounds.

Chianan Irrigation

Chianan Irrigation (; kana: かなんたいしゅう; rōmaji: Kanan Taishuu), also known as the Kanan Irrigation System, was built for promoting the agricultural productions of Chianan Plain of Taiwan. The name "chia-nan" was derived from two place names among its surrounding area called Chiayi and Tainan. Although it includes some assistant facilities, such as the Wushantou Reservoir, the term "Chianan Canal", in a narrow sense, would only means the canals of this system.
The main designer of the Chianan Canal is Yoichi Hatta, a civil engineer of the Japanese colonial government. Its main streams pass through today's Tainan, Chiayi and Yunlin, formerly parts of Tainan Prefecture. The architectural work of canal was launched in 1920 and completed in 1930, during Japanese rule. Chianan Canal improved the planting area of rice from 5000 to 150,000 hectares, and made the rice crops in its irrigated area can harvest three times annually.

British Rail Class 380

The Class 380 "Desiro" is a type of electric multiple-unit train that operates on the national railway network in Scotland.
The Siemens "Desiro UK" family also includes units of 185, 350, 360, 444 and 450.
Description.
The trains operate ScotRail services in the Ayrshire and Inverclyde region of Scotland and had originally been intended for the cancelled Glasgow Airport Rail Link. The construction was awarded to Siemens and announced by Transport Scotland on 11 July 2008.
A total of 38 sets were ordered, comprising 22 three-car and 16 four-car units. Stations along the Ayrshire Coast Line and Inverclyde Line underwent platform extension works to allow the use of the longer trains. The trains were specified to have full access for disabled people and to have streamlined end corridor connections. On the unveiling of the first completed vehicle, it was announced that the fleet would be divided into two sub-groups, with the 3-car units Class 380/0 and the 4-car as Class 380/1.
In September 2010, commissioning of the fleet was suspended by ScotRail due to technical issues with the trains. The reliability issues and extended commissioning period resulted in an initially reduced service on parts of the ScotRail network, including the newly re-opened Airdrie-Bathgate line.
The fleet is based at Glasgow Shields Road TMD. Introduction of the fleet resulted in the cascading of the Class 334 "Juniper" and fleet which previously operated the Ayrshire Coast Line and Inverclyde Line. The North Berwick Line operations was a Class 322 fleet replacement. The Class 334 "Juniper" stock were cascaded onto the North Clyde Line to , the Class 318s were cascaded onto the Argyle Line, and cascaded onto the Wakefield Line with Northern Rail.
Operations.
The fleet was introduced into public service on 8 December 2010 with 380111 operated the 16:26 from to , followed on 9 December 2010 by 380102 and 380001 which worked the 15:30 to Ayr service.
North Berwick Line has been using the route since June 2011.
From 21 November 2012, the Class 380 are also seen operating the Paisley Canal Line. Electrification of the section of line from Corkerhill to Paisley Canal, to a plan devised by a ScotRail and Network Rail alliance, began in July 2012 and was completed in November 2012. The electrification works were undertaken during night time and weekend possessions, resulting in the route closing after 8pm on Monday to Thursday evenings, all day on Saturdays, and for an eight-day period in October, with work starting on 29 September 2012 and intending to be completed by 8 November 2012. Class 314 and Class 380 "Desiro" electric multiple units supplemented the existing Class 156 "Super Sprinter" diesel multiple units from energisation of the wires in November 2012. From the timetable change in December 2012, the Class 156 "Super Sprinter" were moved to other routes.

Frederick S. Humphries

Frederick Stephen Humphries (born December 26, 1935 in Apalachicola, Florida) is an American academic administrator and chemistry professor. He has been a Regent Professor at the Florida A&M University College of Law since 2003. Dr. Humphries is President Emeritus of Tennessee State University (1974 to 1985), and is President Emeritus of Florida A&M University (1985 to 2001). He served as President and CEO of the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education from 2001 to 2003. Florida A&M University conferred the President Emeritus title upon Dr. Humphries on Friday, December 11, 2009.
Under his leadership Florida A&M University would grow from an enrollment of 5,100 in 1985 to 9,876 in 1993. By the 1998-1999 school year, enrollment had reached 11,828 students and by 2001 Florida A&M had an enrollment of 12,316.
He has a bachelor's degree in physical chemistry from Florida A&M University where he graduated Magna Cum Laude in 1957. He received a Ph.D. in physical chemistry from the University of Pittsburgh in 1964 where he was the first African American to receive a Ph.D in this discipline from the University.
Early life.
Dr. Frederick S. Humphries is truly a native Floridian. He was born in Apalachicola, Florida, on December 26, 1935, to Thornton Humphries and Minnie Henry, and received his early education there. He was a product of the Holy Family Catholic School and the small, all-black Wallace M. Quinn High School in Apalachicola. He was one of only nine graduates in the class of 1953. Yet, he now contends that because of the quality and dedication of teachers, the small size of his school and the lack of sophisticated equipment did not handicap him. In an interview with Mike Radigan, Humphries remarked in Capital Outlook (May 9, 1985): "The greatest science teacher I had in high school was Mr. Charlie Watson. He taught me all my math and science courses. He was a very smart man and he cared about his students." Continuing his praise of Watson, Humphries said: "When he realized your abilities, he pushed you to the limit. When I left Wallace Quinn High School, I didn't know how well-prepared I was." Perhaps this early experience with his mathematics and science teacher instilled in him the concept of "excellence with caring" which became his motto upon becoming FAMU's eighth president. That Humphries was well-prepared for the tasks that faced him was verified, in part, by his outstanding record at FAMU when he earned the bachelor of science degree magna cum laude in chemistry in 1957. In addition to his honors in chemistry, he was a distinguished military science graduate in 1957 and was reported to be the first black officer to be commissioned into the Army Security Agency (Army Intelligence Branch). After serving in the Army for two years, he entered the University of Pittsburgh in 1959 as a teaching assistant in chemistry, became a graduate research fellow the next year, and earned his Ph.D. degree in physical chemistry in 1964.
Presidency at Tennessee State University, 1974-1985.
The outstanding accomplishments of Humphries on the national level led the Tennessee Board of Regents to name him as President of Tennessee State University (TSU) in 1974, a position he held until being appointed to lead his alma mater in 1985. While at TSU he demonstrated highly effective administration skills which resulted in improved and expanded academic programs, upgraded faculty, increased enrollment and quality of students, and expanded scholarships and support activities. However, he will likely be remembered most for his bold and tenacious fight for the rights of an historically black university which was located in the same area with an historically white university when he insisted on the predominance of TSU over the University of Tennessee at Nashville (UTN). This ultimately led to the merger of TSU and UTN, with TSU becoming the surviving institution, heralded as one of the fairest and most important desegregation decisions of the 20th century. The posture and eloquence of Humphries in court is largely held as being responsible for this decision along with the brilliant presentation of attorney Avon Williams and the efforts of the Tennesseans for Justice in Higher Education. Humphries did not initiate the court battle over merger of the two universities, but he inherited it upon becoming president of TSU in 1974. In 1968, after the University of Tennessee had announced plans to build a multimillion-dollar facility for its night school extension center in Nashville, a young black woman named Rita Sanders charged that such action would perpetuate segregation at TSU and continue the dual system of public higher education in the state. The controversy which ended up in U.S. District Court before Judge Frank Gray in 1968 was known as Sanders v. Ellington, et al. (April 5, 1977). Subsequent plaintiff was Rita Sanders Girer (after marriage) versus the governor of Tennessee who happened to be in office.
As president of TSU, Humphries was catapulted into a leading role in the drama. When Governor Blanton asked his reaction to merger, Humphries informed the governor that "he and his colleagues were agreeable to merger-under the Board of Regents, not the University of Tennessee trustees." Humphries and his colleagues contended, and so did Judge Gray, that "the existence and expansion of predominantly white UTN alongside the traditionally black TSU have fostered competition for white students and have thus impeded the dismantling of the dual system." The state was ordered by Judge Gray to merge the two schools into a single institution under the State Board of Regents by July 1, 1980. As a result of Judge Gray's ruling, plans were developed and implemented to merge UTN under TSU, making this the first time that a traditionally white university had been placed under the administration of a traditionally black university. In demanding a unitary system, the judge stated: "It is the purpose of this order to achieve a unitary system and not achieve a merger of existing systems of higher education in Tennessee." Humphries said of this settlement: "If TSU had been a white institution, this never would have happened. UT would not have been invited in here to set up a separate institution. But now that the judge has ordered a merger, I think it is important for this traditionally black university to have the full opportunity to develop into a major university serving the entire community."
Between 1980 and 1985, Humphries and his staff gave leadership to the merged TSU and provided for UTN and began serving an increasingly larger portion of the Nashville community. As a result of the astuteness and courage demonstrated in continuous conflict over desegregation at TSU, Humphries achieved a national reputation as a dedicated and brilliant fighter for the cause of the continued existence of HBCUs and opportunities for minorities. It was the knowledge of his leadership in Tennessee which made him seem to many alumni and supporters a desirable candidate for the presidency of FAMU, which had also experienced severe battles to avoid merger or subordination of FAMU to FSU. As Humphries progressed up the leadership ladder and proved himself as a national fighter for HBCUs and for enhanced opportunities for minorities in higher education, he was increasingly invited to membership on boards, commissions, committees and other influential groups at the state, regional and national levels. With a stern focus on improved education for minorities, he served as External Evaluator of Title III Programs; Minority Representative in Graduate Schools Special Academy of Science; as a member of the Planning Committee of the United Negro College Fund Pre-Medical Program, Fisk University; as a member of the Special Committee on Minority Participation in Graduate and Professional Education; and Chairman of the State Board of Education Advisory Committee on the Education of Blacks in Florida. While Humphries recognized the importance of diversity in the overall educational process, he never missed an opportunity to encourage and motivate minorities in higher education.
The Florida A&M University Years, 1985 - 2001.
Dr. Humphries effectively served Florida A&M University as its eighth President from June 1, 1985 to December 31, 2001. He was originally expected to depart June 30, 2001. For sixteen years he brought to FAMU a high quality of academic leadership which was progressive, exciting, enriching, outstanding, and intellectually rewarding. Under his motto of "Excellence with Caring", he worked harmoniously with administrators, faculty, students, alumni, the corporate world, and other supporters of FAMU to establish a challenging and competitive educational environment. As a result, under the Humphries administration, FAMU continuously improved its image and gained increasing recognition on the state, national, and international levels.
As a dedicated alumnus of FAMU, one of President Humphries' major goals was to increase student enrollment at all levels with high-achieving, quality students. Over his sixteen-year tenure, the enrollment at FAMU more than doubled from 5,101 in 1985, to 12,257 in 2000, with an average SAT score of 1028, and an average ACT score of 20. During the same period, FAMU attracted 657 National Achievement Scholars and surpassed such universities as Harvard, Yale and Stanford to lead the nation in numbers of National Achievement Scholars in 1992, 1995, and 1997, tying with Harvard in 2000. The focus on high-achieving students led to a tenfold increase in science and engineering students, with a corresponding increase at the master's degree level. Doctoral degree programs increased from one in 1985 to ten in 2000.
Along with the increases in the quantity and quality of FAMU students, the faculty was significantly upgraded, and academic programs were expanded and diversified. In addition to conducting effective classroom teaching and research, the Faculty was inspired and motivated to increase external funding from both the public and private sectors. The Division of Sponsored Research witnessed an increase in contracts and grants from $8.5 million in 1985 to $46 million in 2000. From the private sector, the FAMU Foundation, Incorporated showed a fund balance of only $6.2 million in 1986, but by 2000, the fund balance had reached $62.5 million. The FAMU Industry Cluster (comprising 152 major corporations) and the Life-Gets-Better Scholarship program, sponsored by select members of the Cluster are firm indications of corporate America's respect for FAMU's educational leadership and graduates of its academic programs. From 1989 to 2000 FAMU provided 873 Life-Gets-Better Scholarships to outstanding minority students majoring in such disciplines as Engineering, Physical, Life, Natural, and Computer Sciences and Pre-Law. In an effort to provide the appropriate facilities for educational programs and activities to flourish, President Humphries worked assiduously with his administrators, faculty, and staff to lead one of the most successful building programs in the history of the University. During his tenure, there were 51 facilities planned, designed, constructed, renovated or acquired between 1985 and 2000 at a grand total of $256,922,556. In 1985, FAMU's operating budget was only $59,940,563, but by 2000, it had grown to $249,951,788, an increase of 416 percent.
Under the Humphries administration, FAMU was elevated to a position where its future appears extremely bright. Being selected as "College of the Year" by the TIME/Princeton Review in 1997, and being recognized in the State University System as a Comprehensive/Doctoral University in 1999 are only two of the many reasons that FAMU entered the 21st century with confidence and optimism. With a broadened institutional mission which emphasizing graduate studies and international affairs, the University can now offer additional masters and doctoral degree programs, and focus on a global perspective in many of its programs. Distance learning has become a major focus as FAMU expands its services and academic influence throughout the state and nation and on the international scenes. In a document entitled Ten Years at the Helm (FAMU: 1995) President Humphries wrote: "I sincerely believe that FAMU is destined to become one of the greatest land-grant universities in the United States, serving a diverse educational population of quality students, of highly competent and dedicated faculty members, and of astute administrators with visions for continued academic growth and excellence at the University."
Upon appointing Humphries as the eighth president of FAMU, the BOR challenged him to improve faculty morale and upgrade the faculty; effect sounder fiscal policies; increase student enrollment at all levels with quality students; expand, upgrade, and diversify academic programs; and increase extramural funding from both the public and private sectors. The BOR emphasized that successful and progressive leadership at FAMU demanded that the president respond effectively on a continuous basis to the charges that it delineated for him.
When the charges delineated by the BOR are examined from a purely objective point of view, it appears that Humphries was the best qualified leader for FAMU. His experiences as a professor of chemistry at FAMU where he was active in political and community affairs; his effective leadership with the Thirteen-College Curriculum Program which emphasized innovative teaching methodologies and relevant course content for minority students; his leadership with Institute for Services to Education, Inc., which coordinated federal and private grants for a consortium of historically black colleges and universities; and his eleven years as president of Tennessee State University, which was similar to FAMU, gave him a variety and quality of experience that neither of the other candidates had. His outstanding qualifications, his immense popularity with the alumni and supporters of FAMU, and his expressed love and devotion to the University gave him an ideal combination of qualities to begin his presidency.
His love for FAMU was demonstrated in 1964 when, upon receiving his doctorate, he rejected other attractive offers to return to FAMU as an assistant professor of chemistry. For nearly four years he taught effectively at his alma mater and became totally involved in the academic, political and social life of the University. In addition to being an outstanding teacher, in 1965-66 Humphries was also an active and influential member of the FAMU Chapter of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP). In the late 1960s FAMU was literally fighting for its life as a separate and autonomous university. Each legislative session would bring serious efforts by legislators to merge FAMU and FSU, presumably as a cost-cutting measure. Then State Senator Bob Graham of Miami and other urban senators from the central and southern sections of Florida were among the strongest proponents of merger. When a report from the Southern Regional Educational Board (SREB) was submitted to the faculty in 1968 by Dr. Lionel Newsome, a former professor at Southern University, it appeared to support the legislative concept of merger. Dr. Gore called a meeting of the Faculty Senate to discuss ways and means to counteract the merger emphasis. In the aftermath of that meeting, the FAMU Chapter of the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), with Dr. Howard E. Lewis serving as president, called a meeting to voice its objection to any consideration of merger.
As an outcome of that meeting, the members drew up a resolution stipulating that FAMU must remain a separate and autonomous university within the State University System. A decision was also made at that meeting to seek the endorsement of this resolution at the statewide meeting of the Florida AAUP. Because of the politically and racially volatile climate at the time, it was difficult to find professors who were willing to fight openly for the cause. Dr. Howard E. Lewis and Dr. Leedell W. Neyland, a past president of FAMU's Chapter of AAUP, persuaded Dr. Frederick S. Humphries and Dr. Ralph W. Turner to present and fight for the passage of the resolution at the statewide AAUP meeting in Gainesville. According to Dr. Turner, "Humphries made a very emotional and forceful presentation which had even the most conservative members listening attentively." After the presentation Humphries and Turner were pleasantly surprised to see that the group voted almost unanimously for the resolution. This endorsement, which placed professors on the statewide level in support of FAMU's autonomy, also had a significant effect on the selected legislators. Shortly thereafter, Senator Graham reversed his position on merger and became an advocate for a separate and autonomous FAMU. This early display of courage contributed to the perception of Humphries' as an aggressive leader who would fight for the survival and growth of FAMU, his alma mater.
Because of Humphries' potential for academic leadership, President Gore selected him to coordinate a select group of FAMU faculty members who participated in a consortium known as the Thirteen College Curriculum Program (TCCP) meeting at the Pine Manor Junior College in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, during the summer of 1967. His efficient and highly astute management of the TCCP project demonstrated to FAMU and to others that he was destined to become an outstanding leader in higher education. Under his leadership, FAMU was named as one of the model projects among the colleges and universities which made up TCCP. In 1968, Humphries joined the staff of the Institute for Services to Education, Incorporated (ISE) in Washington, D. C., an umbrella agency which coordinated a variety of educational programs for minority and disadvantaged students at the college level. Between 1968 and 1974, he held the following directorships while providing leadership for ISE: Summer Conferences, Innovative Institutional Research Consortium, Knoxville College Study of Science Capability of Black Colleges, Interdisciplinary Programs, and two Universities Graduate Programs in Humanities. While holding most of these directorships, Humphries became the Vice President of ISE from 1970 to 1974, and was deeply involved in developing innovative and creative educational materials and procedures designed to improve the educational levels of minorities in higher education. These years of leadership in developmental education for minorities caused him to become a national advocate of good teaching and academic advisement as essentials for the educational growth and development of students. Under Humphries' leadership, the TCCP, one of the most comprehensive and successful programs in higher education for disadvantaged students, grew from 13 to 40 in historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) and from 1,250 to over 20,000 students. The programs he directed led to the establishment of institutional research offices, computer-assisted instruction (long before it was fashionable), interdisciplinary courses, and advanced management practices at many of these HBCUs. He also pioneered special consortial arrangements with major universities such as the University of Massachusetts, University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie-Mellon University, American University and others to permit junior faculty members and graduates to study for the doctorate.
Outside the arena of formal education, Humphries' influence was felt in both the public and private sectors. Over the years he held and, in some cases still holds, significant leadership positions on boards, commissions, and committees designed to uplift various segments of our society. These include: Chairman, Board of Directors of the National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges; Member of the Board of Trustees, University of Pittsburgh; Member of the Board of Directors of Wal-Mart, Inc.; Member of the Board of Directors of Brinker International; Member of the Board of Directors of the Oak Ridge Associates Universities; Member of the National Study Panel on Big Science, National Academy of Science; United States Department of Agriculture Task Force on 1890 Land-Grant Institutions; the Division of National Science Foundation; the Board of Directors, Barnett Bank in Tallahassee; the. Board of Directors, National Merit Scholarship Corporation; the Apalachicola Bay Resources Planning and Management Committee; and many others.
Awards and honors.
His impressive list of awards and honors include: the Drum Major for Justice Award in Education by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference; President's Award for Excellence in Higher Education by 100 Black Men in America, Inc.; Leadership Grant by the Prudential Life Insurance Company of America Foundation; Certificate of Appreciation by the Governor of Tennessee; Certificate of Appreciation by the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Human Development Services; and many others. Among Humphries' most memorable awards are the Distinguished Alumnus Award presented by the faculty of the College of Arts and Sciences of the University of Pittsburgh in 1986; the United Bicentennial Medal of Distinction by the University of Pittsburgh on its 200th anniversary; and the Thurgood Marshall Educational Achievement Award by Johnson Publishing Company for the most outstanding contributions to education. In 1998, the Orlando Sentinel named him "Floridian of the Year," the first black person to be honored with this award.
As an academic leader and astute administrator, Humphries has consistently shared his gifts and talents with others through publications, consultantships, and the evaluation of the accreditation process for universities and colleges. Through more than fifteen articles, dozens of scholarly speeches, and numerous evaluative and consultative services to educational institutions, he has significantly influenced educational development throughout America. A strong proponent of the land-grant idea in education for minorities, Humphries shared his ideas with the nation in the lead article, "1890 Land-Grant Institutions: Their Struggle for Survival and Equality," published in the Spring 1991 issue of Agricultural History. Also, his article on "Black Colleges -- A National Resource for the Training of Minority Scientific and Engineering Manpower," which was presented to the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1978, became a guideline for the implementation of science and engineering emphasis at FAMU. Humphries speaks passionately for the worth of HBCUs whether he is before the U. S. Congress or in an inner-city church in Miami or Tampa. While President, Humphries retained active membership in professional organizations, even though his demanding administrative duties and responsibilities make classroom teaching and research almost impossible. He is a member of the American Association of Higher Education, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Chemical Society, and the American Association of Minority Research Universities. On the civic and community fronts he holds membership in the NAACP and serves on the Board of Directors of the YMCA, the Tallahassee Urban League, and many others.
Personal Life and Mrs. Humphries.
Dr. Humphries is a member of the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, and the Sigma Pi Phi fraternity. Throughout his professional and administrative life he was supported by his devoted wife, Antoinette McTurner Humphries, a native of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She obtained a B. S. degree in sociology and political science from Tennessee State University, which added a special dimension to the many social action projects which she zealously sponsored and supported. Mrs. Humphries filled the role of first lady at FAMU with grace and dignity. In addition to hosting annual celebrations at graduation exercises, the Industry Cluster, and various educational and political groups that visit the campus, Mrs. Humphries participated in many community activities. Annually, she sponsored a Christmas Toys for Tots Drive; hosted local elementary schools in tours of the President's residence and the campus; hosted teas with Miss FAMU and court; hosted Bar-B-Que for student athletes; and provided scholarships for third-year theater majors at the "Toni" Awards program. She further promoted the fine arts at Rickards High School through the Friends of Rickards program with an annual art showing. She also held membership in The Links, Incorporated, The Girlfriends [http://thegfinc.org/noprotection.html], and the Delta Sigma Theta sorority.
Although she involved herself with the economic and social development of many students, her primary emphasis was on nurturing her own three children and steering them toward success. She passed away on March 16, 2006, at the age of 64.
Children.
Frederick Stephen Humphries Jr., the eldest of the three children, graduated from Morehouse College in political science and subsequently earned the J. D. degree from Temple University. He is employed as the Chief Lobbyist & Vice President for US Government Affairs for Microsoft. He is married to the former Kim Sheftall of Macon, Georgia, and they have two children, Arielle and Frederick III (Trey).
Robin Tanya Humphries graduated from Fisk University with a B. S. degree in chemistry. She is employed as Vice President, Business Development for Prism International. She has two children, Brian Alexander and Kirsten.
Laurence Anthony Humphries received his B. S. degree from Morehouse College and earned an MBA from Clark Atlanta University. He is employed as a Senior Analyst at Chevron Africa & Latin America Exploration & Production Co. He has two children, Laurence II and Dylan Gabrielle.
During his sixteen years at FAMU, Dr. Frederick Stephen Humphries provided quality leadership at the helm of an academic ship of higher education called Florida A&M University. He carefully steered it through the treacherous waters of political changes, budget cuts, and internal and external distractions to the calmer waters of academic and intellectual pursuits for both faculty and students. An academic leader who is sometimes accused of micromanagement, he encouraged and energized the various FAMU constituencies to work diligently toward achieving national acclaim for FAMU.

Eco Reserva Mbatoví

The Eco-reserva Mbatoví is a protected area and nature reserve located in the Paraguarí Department, Paraguay, in the middle of the Cordillera de los Altos, between Paraguarí and Piribebuy, in the Central Litoral. The area was preserved by its owners to protect the biological diversity of this natural area. It was the first Environmental Service business to be registered in the General Direction of Public Registries of Paraguay.
History.
In 1999, Jacinto Santa María and Marta González Ayala, both nature lovers, started the search for a natural space for a weekend retreat. They found a place in the middle of the Cordillera de los Altos, near Paraguay, with a beautiful view of the hills and the valley of Pirayu.
They bought the property and decided to keep it conserved as a nature reserve, and to share it with the public. In 2003, Mbatovi was registered as a protected area in the General Direction of Public Registries as the first Environmental Service of Paraguay. The Eco Reserva Mbatovi opened to the public in January 2006. It is designated a special adventure park by the National Tourist Interest (the National Tourism Secretary of Paraguay).
Landscape.
The value of the reserve rests mainly in its beauty, accessibility and diversity of ecosystems available to study in a small area. There is an excellent panoramic view: It is possible to see the Cerro Santo Tomas, el Cerro Hu and the Cerro Pero to the south, and towards the east, the Valley of Pirayu and the Cerro Mbatovi.
Native species.
The area has unpolluted streams with various dams, where you can find Chachi, a very rare species of fern in danger of extinction, as well as many different types of plants such as maiden's hair, lichens, cactus and wild orchids, Small natural caves make the environment extremely peaceful.
On the side of the streams are deep forests with mature trees and much natural regeneration. There are more than a hundred native species present.
There are many local bird species as well as a variety of reptiles and mammals such as the agouti paca, acutí sayju, aguara'í, tapití and different species of armadillos.
Activities.
The eco reserva offers highly qualified instructors and guides and a secure environment for the study of nature.
Mbatoví also offers activities for management groups, designed to influence in the attitudes and values of the participants, using a lively focus. The objective of these activities is to develop focused competences related to emotional intelligence, change capacity, group work and leadership.
Location.
Access to the Reserva is in the km number 72 of the Paraguari-Piribebuy road, on top of the mountains, 10 km away from the center of Paraguarí.
The Reserva is open on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.

ONEOK Field

ONEOK Field ( ) is a baseball park in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Located in the historic Greenwood district adjacent to downtown Tulsa, it is the home of the Tulsa Drillers of the AA Texas League.
The stadium is named for ONEOK (pronounced "wun-oak"), a natural gas utility.
Construction.
The Drillers, who then played at Drillers Stadium on the Tulsa County Fairgrounds, began looking for a replacement ballpark in about 1998; at one point they signed a non-binding letter of intent to move to the Tulsa suburb of Jenks, before efforts by then-Tulsa mayor Kathy Taylor and others led to the Drillers deciding to proceed with a downtown stadium. The Drillers announced the move on June 26, 2008. The future of the stadium was for a time threatened by the financial collapse of its largest donor, SemGroup. However, groundbreaking for the new ballpark went forward on December 19, 2008. On January 12, 2009, ONEOK, Inc. and the Oneok Foundation announced that they would pay $5 million USD to obtain the 20-year naming rights for the new baseball park.
The Drillers played their first game in the new ballpark on Thursday, April 8, 2010, losing 7-0 to the Corpus Christi Hooks before a crowd of 8,665 (more than 800 over official capacity). The first pitch at the stadium was thrown by country music star, Tim McGraw.
Features.
ONEOK Field was designed by architect firm Populous (formerly HOK Sport Venue Event) of Kansas City, Missouri and constructed by Manhattan Construction Company. The stadium has an official capacity of 7,833, but is capable of holding up to 9,000 for special events. (On May 7, 2010, the stadium had a reported record attendance of 9,417 for a Bedlam Series game between the University of Oklahoma Sooners and the Oklahoma State University Cowboys.) It has 23 suites and a playing field recessed about 13 feet below street level. With a construction cost of $39.2 million, the project also included the purchase of adjacent land for complementary development, for a total project budget of $60 million.
The new ballpark was intended to be more directly connected to its urban surroundings than was the old stadium at the fairgrounds, and also to have many of the same kinds of luxury amenities available in a major-league ballpark, both for fans and for the players and coaches.

<doc id="18400089" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18400089" title="Relationship between Friedrich Nietzsche and Max Stirner">
Relationship between Friedrich Nietzsche and Max Stirner

The ideas of 19th-century German philosophers Max Stirner and Friedrich Nietzsche have often been compared, and many authors have discussed apparent similarities in their writings, sometimes raising the question of influence. In Germany, during the early years of Nietzsche's emergence as a well-known figure, the only thinker discussed in connection with his ideas more often than Stirner was Schopenhauer. It is certain that Nietzsche read about Stirner's book "The Ego and Its Own" ("Der Einzige und sein Eigentum", 1845), which was mentioned in Lange's "History of Materialism" (1866) and Eduard von Hartmann's "Philosophy of the Unconscious" (1869), both of which young Nietzsche knew very well. However, there is no irrefutable indication that he actually read it, as no mention of Stirner is known to exist anywhere in Nietzsche's publications, papers or correspondence.
And yet as soon as Nietzsche's work began to reach a wider audience the question of whether or not he owed a debt of influence to Stirner was raised. As early as 1891 (while Nietzsche was still alive, though incapacitated by mental illness) Eduard von Hartmann went so far as to suggest that he had plagiarized Stirner. By the turn of the century the belief that Nietzsche had been influenced by Stirner was so widespread that it became something of a commonplace, at least in Germany, prompting one observer to note in 1907 "Stirner's influence in modern Germany has assumed astonishing proportions, and moves in general parallel with that of Nietzsche. The two thinkers are regarded as exponents of essentially the same philosophy."
Nevertheless, from the very beginning of what was characterized as "great debate" regarding Stirner's possible influence on Nietzsche — positive or negative — serious problems with the idea were noted. By the middle of the 20th century, if Stirner was mentioned at all in works on Nietzsche, the idea of influence was often dismissed outright or abandoned as unanswerable.
But the idea that Nietzsche was influenced in some way by Stirner continues to attract a significant minority, perhaps because it seems necessary to explain in some reasonable fashion the often-noted (though arguably superficial) similarities in their writings. In any case, the most significant problems with the theory of possible Stirner influence on Nietzsche are not limited to the difficulty in establishing whether the one man knew of or read the other. They also consist in establishing precisely how and why Stirner in particular might have been a meaningful influence on a man as widely read as Nietzsche.
Period suggestions of influence and possible links to Stirner.
The origin of the debate surrounding whether or not Nietzsche had read Stirner's work – and if so, whether he had been influenced by him – seems to lie in apparent similarities between the ideas of the two men as expressed in their writing. These similarities were recognized early and led many, for a variety of reasons, to attempt to determine the precise nature of any possible relationship.
Eduard von Hartmann's book "The Philosophy of the Unconscious" had been attacked by Nietzsche in the second of his "Untimely Meditations". In 1891 Hartmann claimed that Nietzsche must have been aware of Stirner because Stirner was treated in the very book by him which Nietzsche subjected to criticism. As mentioned, Hartmann accused Nietzsche of having plagiarized Stirner. Nietzsche is also known to have read Lange's "History of Materialism", where Stirner's book "The Ego and Its Own" is referred to briefly as "the most extreme, that we have knowledge of". Lange goes on to refer to the "ill fame" of Stirner's book. Nietzsche knew these works by Hartmann and Lange very well.
Paul Lauterbach also appears to have played a role in the origin of the association of the two thinkers. Lauterbach was a close friend of Heinrich Köselitz ("Peter Gast," who was for many years a kind of private secretary for Nietzsche). Lauterbach came to know Nietzsche's work through Köselitz, and was among the philosopher's earliest admirers. He also worked hard to revive Stirner. According to one view this was a part of his project to present Nietzsche as "the great successor, developer and creative transformer" of Stirner. He edited and wrote an introduction to the 1893 Reclam Edition of Stirner with this in mind. Discussing the book in a letter to Köselitz, he wrote "My introduction has only that one objective, to protect innocent people against it book and to mystify and paralyze the malevolent, substantially with the assistance of Nietzsche." This introduction appeared in all Reclam editions of "The Ego and Its Own" from 1893 to 1924.
Franz Overbeck, who was one of Nietzsche's closest friends, went through the records of the Basle university library and was able to confirm what Nietzsche's erstwhile favourite student Adolf Baumgartner had claimed: that once he had borrowed Stirner's book (on the 14th of July 1874), according to Baumgartner "on Nietzsche's warmest recommendations". Albert Levy independently confirmed that Baumgartner made the claim, and that he (Baumgartner) had borrowed the book. Franz Overbeck's wife Ida reported that during the period from 1880 to 1883 Nietzsche lived with the couple at several points, and that he mentioned Stirner directly. She describes a discussion she had with Nietzsche in which he mentioned Klinger and Stirner as follows:
"Ach," he said, "I was very disappointed in Klinger. He was a philistine, I feel no affinity with him; but Stirner, yes, with him!" And a solemn expression passed over his face. While I was watching his features intently, his expression changed again, and he made something like a gesture of dismissal or defense: "Now I've told you, and I did not want to mention it at all. Forget it. They will be talking about plagiarism, but you will not do that, I know."
Resa von Schirnhofer reports that in 1897 she visited Nietzsche's sister in Weimar:
Frau Elisabeth wanted to hear some things about my meetings and conversations with Nietzsche and asked me, among other things, whether he had discussed with me Stirner and his book "The Individual and His Property". After a little reflection, I answered that I did not remember him ever having mentioned this name. She seemed very satisfied with this answer and, reformulating the question, she insisted: whether I could state with certainty from memory that he had "not" named him. I felt like a criminal under interrogation by a prosecuting attorney and said I could only state that this name occurred neither in my notebook, nor in my memory as having been named by Nietzsche. She, however, came back to this question several times and always received the same answer. But this did not answer the key question as to whether Nietzsche knew Stirner, because not mentioning him to me is not the same thing as his not knowing him. But that Frau Elisabeth asked me this question is very explainable, since R. Schellwien and Henri Lichtenberger had, in their studies of Max Stirner, drawn a few parallels with Nietzsche's theories.
Schirnhofer goes on to make specific mention of a public controversy at this time:
Henri Lichtenberger - if I am not mistaken - visited the Nietzsche Archives shortly before I did and the question of whether Nietzsche had known Stirner's book must have been discussed intensely. Lichtenberger's book on Nietzsche, which appeared soon afterwards, states about this:
"It is certain that despite his claims to complete originality he submitted, consciously or not, to the influence of his contemporaries, and that his thinking, once stripped of its paradoxical and aggressive style, is often much less new than it seems on first encounter. Uncompromising individualism, the cult of the self, hostility to the state, protest against the dogma of equality and against the cult of humanity are found stamped almost as strongly as in Nietzsche, in an author quite forgotten, Max Stirner, whose main work The Individual and His Property (1845) is, from this point of view, very interesting to compare with Nietzsche's writings."
However, Ida Overbeck, who knew Nietzsche very well, suggests that the relationship between Nietzsche's work and Stirner's should not be viewed as simple plagiarism. Her view was rather that Nietzsche owed a debt to Stirner for introducing new ideas that were significant to Nietzsche in his own work:
That Nietzsche and Stirner seem to us so diametrically different, and actually are, is obvious! But we are not thereby doing justice to Nietzsche and are not giving him the attention and respect he wishes and may demand. Nietzsche paid innermost attention to Stirner. He neither proceeded from him nor stayed with him. It was the simplest sense of reality that moved my husband to note that Nietzsche had known Stirner. Stirner represents a very specific element in Nietzsche, though a small one if you wish, but for Nietzsche great and significant because of the scantiness of this element which he happened to be pursuing.
Circumstantial evidence.
Claims of influence might have been ignored were it not for the apparent similarities in the writing of the two men which were frequently noted. In addition to similarities, and reports by Nietzsche's close friend that he felt an affinity for Stirner, there exist three other circumstantial details which perhaps deserve mention.
The first is that Richard Wagner, who is well known as an early influence on Nietzsche, might have been familiar with Stirner's ideas. August Röckel was known to have introduced Wagner to Mikhail Bakunin, the Russian anarchist, and all three men were involved in the Dresden insurrection in May 1849. Wagner met with Bakunin several times during this period. Wagner is also known to have read the work of the anarchist Proudhon. Stirner was often closely associated with anarchist thought. Several authors have suggested that Wagner knew of Stirner's work, and some have suggested that Stirner influenced him.
The second involves Hans von Bülow, Cosima Wagner's first husband, who was a great champion and interpreter of Wagner's music. Nietzsche apparently first met him in the early 1870s when Nietzsche was frequently a guest of the Wagners and was introduced to members of their circle. Bülow visited Basel on March 27 of 1872, where he and Nietzsche held long conversations. In June of that year Nietzsche dedicated to von Bülow his new musical composition "Manfred-Meditation" and sent him a copy of the score. Von Bülow replied on July 24 with strong criticism of the piece. Nietzsche appears to have accepted this criticism with grace. In any case he did not break off all contact with von Bülow as we know that Nietzsche sent him a complimentary copy of the first part of "Zarathustra" in late summer or early fall of 1883. Nietzsche also sent von Bülow a copy of "Beyond Good and Evil" when the printing was finished in the late summer of 1886. He also wrote to Bülow as late as the 4th of January 1889, during his mental illness. Hans von Bülow is known to have been a great admirer of Max Stirner, and is reported to have known him personally. In April 1892 Bülow closed his final performance with the Berlin Philharmonic with a speech "exalting" the ideas of Stirner. Together with John Henry Mackay, Stirner's biographer, he placed a memorial plaque at Stirner's last residence in Berlin.
The third is the fact that from the 1st to the 17th of October 1865 Nietzsche visited the house of his friend Hermann Mushacke in Berlin. Hermann's father was one Eduard Mushacke, who in the 1840s had been a "good friend" of Stirner's. Nietzsche apparently got on well with Eduard Mushacke. Writing to his mother from Leipzig a few days later, on the 22nd of October he reported, "The life in Berlin was exceptionally pleasant and enjoyable. The old Mushacke is the most lovable man I ever met. We are on first name terms." One study links this newly discovered biographical detail with an "initial crisis" Nietzsche experienced in 1865, as a result of exposure to Stirner's ideas, leading to his study of Schopenhauer.
Association of the two thinkers by anarchists.
During the 19th century, Nietzsche was frequently associated with anarchist movements, in spite of the fact that in his writings he expressed a negative view of anarchists. This may be the result of a popular association during this period between his ideas and those of Stirner, whose work proved influential among individualist anarchists. The two men were frequently compared by French "literary anarchists" and anarchist interpretations of Nietzschean ideas appear to have been influential in the United States as well. Superficial similarities in the expressed ideas of the two men again seem to have played a key role in this association. "Partly because of his egoistic nihilism, and partly because of his neologistic, aphoristic style, Stirner's name came to be associated with Nietzsche's, as both writers were appropriated by anarchists and other radical thinkers at the turn of the century." This association sometimes exasperated anarchist thinkers, who often viewed Nietzsche's work as derivative.
Jean Grave, a French anarchist active in the 1890s, confronted by the growing numbers of anarchists who associated themselves with Nietzsche and Stirner expressed contempt for this trend, "without a doubt, well before the bourgeois litteratures had discovered Nietzsche and Stirner, several anarchists had found that the 'Individual' had only to consider his own 'self,' his own comfort, and his own development." He went on to question the commitment of those writers who fashionably called themselves anarchists because they could recite by heart a few passages of Nietzsche or Stirner.
This association was also common among anarchists (or "individualist anarchists") in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th century. In the introduction to Benjamin R. Tucker's edition of the first English translation of Stirner's "The Ego and Its Own" the question arises again. Here, J.L. Walker notes "Nietzsche has been much spoken of as a disciple of Stirner". He goes on to explicitly state, "In style Stirner's work offers the greatest possible contrast to the puerile, padded phraseology of Nietzsche's "Zarathustra" and its false imagery. Who ever imagined such an unnatural conjuncture as an eagle "toting" a serpent in friendship?" However Tucker himself had sought to promote Nietzsche's ideas as supporting anarchism. One researcher notes "Indeed, translations of Nietzsche's writings in the United States very likely appeared first in "Liberty", the anarchist journal edited by Benjamin Tucker." He adds "Tucker preferred the strategy of exploiting his writings, but proceeding with due caution: 'Nietzsche says splendid things, – often, indeed, Anarchist things, – but he is no Anarchist. It is of the Anarchists, then, to intellectually exploit this would-be exploiter. He may be utilized profitably, but not prophetably.'"
Arguments against influence.
Many who have suggested that Stirner had no influence upon Nietzsche simply dismiss the idea without any real discussion. This was the approach taken by Alois Riehl, who, like many later writers, showed his contempt for Stirner by refusing to mention him by name. In 1897 he wrote, "It shows a still greater lack of ability to differentiate between minds, if one puts together Nietzsche with the involuntary parodist of Fichte, with the author of the book 'The Ego and Its Own' — this, however, is the same as putting together writings of a nearly unparalleled power of language and fatal strength of genius with a literary curiosity." When writers do bother to offer support for their refutation of the idea, the fact that no definite mention of Stirner exists in Nietzsche's published and unpublished writing is the basic argument against influence.
Albert Levy: The absence of any references to Stirner was noted by Albert Levy as early as 1904, in his study "Stirner and Nietzsche". This argument against influence has proven quite durable; many of the brief remarks on the debate about Stirner's possible influence on Nietzsche to be found in academic publications mention this fact and little else. However, one researcher (who incidentally feels that Nietzsche was most likely "not" influenced by Stirner) notes: "It is not possible to prove that someone has not read a certain book (which was available). Nonreading, unlike reading, is always a question of probability." 
Levy also dealt very briefly with the fact that Nietzsche must have been aware of Stirner through the works of Hartmann and Lange (discussed above). In the case of Hartmann he speculated that the context and nature of the mention of Stirner in Hartmann's "The Philosophy of the Unconscious" would not have led Nietzsche to consider Stirner's work sympathetically, and goes on to add that in any case, Hartmann's claims do not prove direct influence. As for the mention of Stirner in Lange, Levy suggests that because Stirner's ideas are compared in this work with Schopenhauer's, it follows that Nietzsche must have seen Stirner's work as somehow related to the philosophy of Schopenhauer. Hence Levy proposes that if Stirner had any influence upon Nietzsche it would have come to little more than additional impetus to remain a disciple of Schopenhauer. Along these lines he concludes that the report of the Overbecks alleging Nietzsche's affinity for Stirner arose from a misunderstanding on Nietzsche's part about the relationship between Stirner and Schopenhauer resulting from Lange's faulty interpretation.
Levy then proceeds to compare the seemingly similar ideas of the two thinkers, suggesting the similarities are superficial. According to Levy's interpretation, for example, Stirner wants to free the self from all bonds and laws, while Nietzsche preaches the duty of originality and sincerity; Stirner is a realist, while Nietzsche is a "humanist" who sees only barbarism beyond the frontiers of ancient Greece; Stirner has a critical mind, while Nietzsche is an artist; Stirner seeks continuous improvement (for him the advent of Christianity and the French Revolution are significant milestones) while Nietzsche admires ancient Greece, sees Christianity as decadent and wants a "Renaissance"; Stirner is a "democrat", while Nietzsche is an aristocrat whose ideal state is "Platonic"; Stirner wants to liberate the self from any hierarchy, while Nietzsche reserves a privileged aristocracy of originality, freedom and selfishness; While Stirner wants to empower the spirit of opposition, Nietzsche wants to impose harsh discipline to create a beautiful race.
Oscar Ewald: Levy was not alone. Though the details of the differences noted in the expressed ideas of the two men varied, there were others who pointed them out. In a review of the state of philosophical discussion in Germany published in 1907, Oscar Ewald suggested:
Little as one may contest the importance of Stirner, who was an energetic rather than a profound thinker, still one has good cause to be cautious in comparing him to Nietzsche. Individualism is Stirner's last word, but not Nietzsche's. Nietzsche's philosophy as a whole is not egocentric. He finds the ego spun into the world, into the great complex play, which man must fashion and live from in its innermost centre, without clinging to any singular reality, not even to the reality of his own person, for the wealth of being would thus be lessened.
Georg Simmel: Georg Simmel also felt that any apparent similarities were superficial.
Here we grasp the distance between Nietzsche and Max Stirner, which cannot be bridged despite superficial indications of the sort that made Nietzsche appear to ally with the sophists. As did the sophists, Stirner holds that all objective standards and values are imaginary and inessential, ghostly shadows confronting subjective reality. Stirner would find it meaningless to claim that the ego referred to anything beyond itself or that it should be graded according to a scale of values. He represents the renaissance of sophism, whereas Nietzsche writes: "We find abominable any decadent spirit who says: 'Everything only to me!' 
Rudolf Steiner: Not all who argued against influence claimed that the similarities to be found in the works of the two men were superficial. Rudolf Steiner met Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche when he was working on the famous Weimar Edition of Goethe's works then in preparation under commission from the Archduchess Sophie of Saxony. She subsequently asked him to arrange the Nietzsche library, and even admitted him to her ailing brother's presence. He spent several weeks in the Nietzsche Archives in Naumberg fulfilling Förster-Nietzsche's request. He also edited and wrote introductions to the works of Jean Paul Richter and Schopenhauer. Further, he was acquainted with Eduard von Hartmann, and dedicated a book to him. Steiner's "Friedrich Nietzsche, Fighter for Freedom", was first published in 1895. In it Steiner suggests:
One cannot speak of Nietzsche's development without being reminded of that freest thinker who was brought forth by mankind of the new age, namely, Max Stirner. It is a sad truth that this thinker, who fulfills in the most complete sense what Nietzsche requires of the superman, is known and respected by only a few. Already in the forties of the nineteenth century, he expressed Nietzsche's world conception. Of course he did not do this in such comfortable heart tones as did Nietzsche, but even more in crystal clear thoughts, beside which Nietzsche's aphorisms often appear like mere stammering.
What path might Nietzsche not have taken if, instead of Schopenhauer, his teacher had been Max Stirner! In Nietzsche's writing no influence of Stirner whatsoever is to be found. By his own effort, Nietzsche had to work his way out of German idealism to a Stirner-like world conceptIon.
Like Nietzsche, Stirner is of the opinion that the motivating forces of human life can be looked for only in the single, real personality. He rejects all powers that wish to form and determine the individual personality from outside. He traces the course of world history and discovers the fundamental error of mankind to be that it does not place before itself the care and culture of the individual personality, but other impersonal goals and purposes instead. He sees the true liberation of mankind in that men refuse to grant to all such goals a higher reality, but merely use these goals as a means of their self-cultivation. The free human being determines his own purposes. He possesses his ideals, he does not allow himself to be possessed by them. The human being who does not rule over his ideals as a free personality, stands under the same influence as the insane person who suffers from fixed ideas. It is all the same for Stirner if a human being imagines himself to be “Emperor of China” or if a comfortable bourgeois imagines it is his destiny to be a good Christian, a faithful Protestant, or a virtuous human being, and so on, or is caught and held captive in orthodoxy, virtuousness, etc.
One need read only a few sentences from Stirner's book, Der Einzige und sein Eigentum, The Individual and his very Own, to see how his conception is related to that of Nietzsche.
Steiner goes on to quote several passages from Stirner discussing the "unique one". He explicitly relates this concept of Stirner's with Nietzsche's idea of the "superman".
This person dependent only upon himself, this possessor of creativity out of himself alone, is Nietzsche's superman.
These Stirner thoughts would have been the suitable vessel into which Nietzsche could have poured his rich life of feeling; instead, he looked to Schopenhauer's world of concepts for the ladder upon which he could climb to his own world of thought.
Steiner's view appears to be that the similarities between the two writers are significant and substantial, but he accounts for this with the suggestion that Nietzsche arrived at a "Stirner-like world conception" on his own. Steiner makes no mention of any of the arguments then current suggesting the possibility or likelihood that Nietzsche was familiar with Stirner's work. Variations of this attempt to account for the seeming similarity in the writings of Stirner and Nietzsche through a theory of independent parallel development can be found in discussions of Stirner as a "precursor" of Nietzsche.
John Glassford: Glassford believes that there is "staggering similarity" between some of the two men's ideas. While he seems to believe that it is likely that Nietzsche read Stirner, he stops short of asserting any certain influence or plagiarism.
Stylistically speaking, Stirner uses hyperbole and metaphor in much the same way as Nietzsche, although most would agree that Nietzsche's technique is the more successful. Compare, for example, Stirner's image of the state - "the state turns against me with all the force of its lion-paws and eagle-claws: for it is the King of beasts, it is lion and eagle" (1995, 226) - with Nietzsche's description of the state in Thus Spoke Zarathustra - the "State is the name of the coldest of all cold monsters" (I "On the New Idol"). Even allowing for the vagaries of translation, it is clear that Stirner's prose is more repetitive and pedestrian than Nietzsche's, and very often, as in the example just given, Stirner's metaphors just don't work.
More important, and with regard to content, Nietzsche, like Stirner, denies God (GS 125; Stirner 1996, 6-7), he rejects the traditional boundaries available to moral agents (BGE 1-2; Stirner 1995, 282), he undercuts the more plausible conceptions of truth (BGE Preface; Stirner 1995, 312), and he glorifies the use of power to settle disputes between competing interests (BGE 6, 186, 197; Stirner 1995, 175). Perhaps even more remarkable is Stirner's apparent anticipation of a sacred Nietzschean cow, namely, the critique of the modern account of freedom in which autonomy and obligation are reconciled through some mode or other of self-imposed duty. Rather, Stirner like Nietzsche, appeals to a different conception with a persistent call to authenticity, whatever the costs (1995, xxii, 177, 149; Nietzsche, ZI "On the Gift-Giving Virtue" 3). Finally, Stirner and Nietzsche shared an obsession with the role of language and its potentially tyrannizing effects (Stirner 1995, 312-15; Nietzsche, TI "Skirmishes").
There is also a staggering similarity between Stirner and Nietzsche's political demonology. Can it be mere coincidence that Stirner, like Nietzsche, loathed the state, nationalism, liberalism, socialism, and communism? Nietzsche called all of these modern isms "little attacks of stupidity," and Stirner rather typically said of one of these ideologies, "That the communist sees in you the man, the brother, is only the Sunday side of communism" (Nietzsche, BGE 251; Stirner 1995, 110). According to Stirner and Nietzsche, then, these ideas are all based upon a latent secularized version of Christian ethics.
After reviewing the controversy as regards possible plagiarism he suggests: "Unless new documents emerge, we will probably never be able to establish with complete certainty whether Nietzsche plagiarized from Stirner. The circumstantial evidence provided by the published writings is strong, but only if one glosses over the many differences in the published writings as well. [...] Nevertheless, I know of no other example of two philosophers whose works bear such a strong similarity, but where no debt of acknowledgement took place". Following Löwith, he concludes by offering the idea that Nietzsche most likely arrived at ideas similar to Stirner's because of the "inevitable logic of post-Hegelian philosophy".
Thomas H. Brobjer: Brobjer, unlike Glassford, does not see any "staggering similarity" between the two men. He does accept some of the general similarities mentioned by Glassford in his article, but he feels that claims of plagiarism, and even of influence are inappropriate. He proposes a 'new' possible solution: Nietzsche knew of Stirner through secondary works. Though Brobjer is apparently a very careful scholar, he claims "the only known secondary source that Nietzsche read Stirner has been F. A. Lange's "Geschichte des Materialismus"". He then announces that Nietzsche definitely read works of Hartmann where Stirner is mentioned at length as though he is the first to have published this "discovery". While the fact that Nietzsche must have read at least one of Hartmann's works in which Stirner was discussed is very old news, Brobjer does add at least one new secondary source discussing Stirner that Nietzsche could have read.
Arguments for influence.
Anselm Ruest: Anselm Ruest reviewed the Nietzsche controversy in his 1906 biography of Stirner and came to the conclusion "that Nietzsche had read Stirner, but withheld mention of him in his writings because he feared that while it was 'a positive philosophy which yearned for life', it was apt to be 'misused by many readers as a justification for petty crimes and cowardly misdeeds.'"
Paul Carus wrote the following in 1914 about their relationship: 
Gilles Deleuze: Gilles Deleuze suggests that Stirner was a critically important "negative" influence on Nietzsche. From this perspective Stirner's egoism was answered by Nietzsche's self-overcoming and "the theory of the higher man".

Packman &amp; Poppe Motorcycles

Packman & Poppe (P&P) was a British motorcycle manufacturer. Founded by Erling Poppe (who later went on to design Sunbeam motorcycles) and Gilmour Packman the first motorcycle was produced in 1922 with a 250 cc two-stroke engine. This was followed by a 976 cc side-valve machine with a JAP V-twin engine in 1923 and the Silent Three using a 350 cc Barr and Stroud sleeve-valve engine. Packman & Poppe entered three machines into 1925 TT. Sadly Packman was injured in an argument with a salesman and died. In the same year the Packman & Poppe factory was destroyed by a fire and in 1926 sold to John Wooler, who kept up production until the Depression, in 1930.

Mark Wheat

Mark Wheat is an English disc jockey working at the Minnesota Public Radio station KCMP where he provides one of the outlet's unique voices because of his accent. Wheat grew up in the small town of Clenchwarton, near King's Lynn, Norfolk, England, where he dreamed of becoming a radio host while listening to British DJ John Peel. His first radio break came when offered the chance to guest on the briefly incandescent Big Joe Wilson show on CXR Hospital Radio where he riffed with luminaries of the 80’s radio scene such as Karl ‘The Teaman’ Warkus, KY’s Doodie Watson Jones and the Fruit Poets — Fringer Turner and Chucky C Farren. The interweaving of soulful talk and thoughtful music which was such a hallmark of the show, would prove a useful addition to Mark’s kitbag when he later moved to the United States and picked up his radio career.
Before settling in Minnesota, Wheat lived in St Louis, Missouri; North Carolina; and Hoboken, New Jersey.
While living in the area of New York City, Wheat became interested in the WFMU radio station in New Jersey, and spent some time there. He eventually moved to the Twin Cities region of Minnesota where he became heavily involved in the local music scene and did radio shows on KFAI and the short-lived Zone 105 (now known as Love 105). During the mid to late 1990s, he hosted "Local Sound Department" on KFAI, and also worked at Zone where he did a show named "Across the Pond" which focused on what was happening back in the United Kingdom.
In 1998, he was hired to work at the University of Minnesota's music station, 770 Radio K (KUOM), which is one of the most popular college radio stations in the country. Wheat spent six years at the station, acting as program coach, DJ, and host of the weekend show "The Music Lover's Club". He became so identified with Radio K that he was inadvertently labeled in the local press as head of the station. However, Wheat was just part of a small full-time staff that oversees students who do much of the work at the station. As his time there came to an end, Wheat expressed confidence in the ability of the students to continue the station's mission.
Wheat made a significant move in 2005, leaving 770 AM for a new station that was being started by Minnesota Public Radio. KCMP 89.3 FM is an "eclectic" music station, playing a wide variety of different music. In fact, KUOM has a somewhat similar format, so some have expressed concern that the launch of KCMP could affect Radio K negatively. However, many music and media critics had described the Twin Cities music radio landscape as desolate up until this time, and many listeners in the area had decided to turn their radios off in favor of Internet radio streams or iPods and other portable devices. In an interview made shortly after the station's launch, Wheat expressed hope that those former radio listeners might be drawn back to the medium, and therefore might discover (or rediscover) Radio K and KFAI.
Wheat has related a number of different personal stories in between playing songs on the radio. One unusual occurrence happened when he was living in St. Louis, Missouri. Some of his friends convinced The Minutemen to come and make a personal performance on his birthday. He has also mentioned that many people—even in his home country—mistake his accent for Australian. This is somewhat to be expected, though, since he has now spent decades in the United States.
Several awards have been granted to Mark Wheat in recognition of his talents. Most recently, he won the "City Pages" readers' poll for "Best AM Radio Personality" in the 2004 Best of the Twin Cities awards.
The Fall, a punk rock group from Manchester, is his all-time favorite musical group. He's also a fan of Manchester United football club. He attended the University of Leeds while members of The Gang of Four were seniors and during the time The Mekons formed. David Gedge of The Wedding Present was also entered the university at the same time, although Wheat didn't meet him until an interview years later.
On Sept. 6, 2012, Wheat became a naturalized U.S. citizen; he is now a dual citizen of Great Britain and the United States.

Khaling

The word "Khaling" is one of the most beautiful,meaningful and realistic of names ever given to a place. Why??? "Kha" in Dzongkha (Nationallanguage)means bird, and "ling" means valley. This is the most enchanting, haunting and lush green fertile valley of the Himalayan Kingdom - Bhutan. Quite naturally, it is blessed with innumerable variety of birds and their songs. A recent survey (casual, of course,) revealed that there are more than 35 varieties of colourful birds with mesmerising tunes. Their enchanting melodious notes reverberate this heavenly valley. 
Khaling is wellknown all over Bhutan because of another reason. One of the oldest of educational institutions in this peaceful "land of Thunder Dragon" (Bhutan) is situated here in this green valley of Khaling. The school is known as "Jigme Sherubling Higher Secondary School" which was established in the year 1978.
Population (latest census)5646 .
Khaling is a name of group of people from Manipur, India and also from Solukhumbu, Nepal.

Karl Jessen

Vice Admiral Karl Petrovich Jessen (; 30 June 1852 – 30 November 1918) was an admiral in the Imperial Russian Navy during the Russo-Japanese War.
Biography.
Jessen was of Baltic German descent, born in Livonia, where his father was a doctor of veterinary medicine. He graduated from the Sea Cadets in 1875 and was commissioned as a lieutenant on 18 July 1879. He graduated from the school of mine warfare in 1881, and for naval artillery in 1884. He was assigned as mine warfare officer on several vessels, and was briefly assigned as a military attache to Germany. In 1890, he was given command of the destroyer "Adler" with the Russian Black Sea Fleet.
Between 1891 and 1893, Jessen was executive officer on the protected cruiser , assigned to the Russian Baltic Fleet and the Far East. From 1894 to 1895 he was commander aboard the steamship "Neva". From 1895 to 1896 he commanded the cruiser . In 1897, Jessen was promoted captain, 1st rank. From 1898 to 1905 he assumed command of the cruiser , which was assigned to the Russian Pacific Fleet.
On 1 January 1904, Jessen was promoted to the rank of rear admiral. With the start of the Russo-Japanese War on 8 February, he was appointed deputy commander of Port Arthur and used the battleship as his flagship. However, on 10 March Vice Admiral Makarov reassigned Jessen to command the cruiser squadron based at Vladivostok, and he transferred his flag to the armored cruiser . This cruiser squadron conducted commerce raiding and other offensive operations while the remainder of the Russian Pacific Fleet remained bottled in Port Arthur by a Japanese blockade. 
Jessen’s operations threatened Japanese shipping and supply lines, and resulted in the Imperial Japanese Navy appointing Admiral Kamimura Hikonojo to command the IJN 2nd Fleet to track down and destroy his squadron. Jessen evaded the Japanese on several occasions, sinking a number of vessels in the Sea of Japan. From 12 June he was briefly replaced by Vice Admiral Petr Bezobrazov. 
On August 14, 1904, during the Battle off Ulsan, he fought an inconclusive engagement against the Japanese fleet under Admiral Kamimura. During the engagement, "Gromoboï" was badly damaged, with 94 crewmen killed and 182 wounded and "Rurik" forced to scuttle, with 204 crewman killed and 305 wounded. In recognition of his efforts in the battle, he was awarded the Order of St. George (fourth grade). 
On 9 November 1904 Jessen was appointed commander of the 1st Squadron of the Pacific Fleet. However, with the fall of Port Arthur to the Japanese, he played on further offensive role, and concentrated on coastal defense of the region around Vladivostok with his much depleted forces. In November 1905 he led the remaining Russian ships back to Baltic Sea, where they arrived in April 1906. After his return to Petrograd, he was reprimanded and faced a court marshal, accepting a promotion to the rank of vice admiral and an honorable discharge from the navy in 1908.
In 1912, he became owner of the Myulgrabenskoy shipyard near Riga. In 1913, his firm received a contract to build nine new destroyers as part of the program to rebuild the Russian Baltic Fleet. 
Karl Petrovich Jessen died in 1918 in Petrograd.

He is the chairman of the Karnatak Lingayat Education Society, Belgaum which runs over 220 educational institutions in Karnataka and 30 other institutions in other part of the world. 
As chairman of the K.L.E. Society since 1984, he has contributed significantly to the society’s emergence as a premier education provider. The K.L.E. Society has 204 institutions under its fold with a student community in excess of 70,229 and a workforce of over 8,226. The society offers education, in nearly every stream of learning. Under his chairmanship over 166 institutions have been newly created. A unique aspect of this growth has been the focus to make an education impact in rural areas in fields such as Pharmacy, Nursing, Education Management Studies, Computer Applications, Engineering etc. In keeping with his vision of ensuring that the KLE has a global presence, Prabhakar Kore has been the moving spirit behind the establishment of international schools at Delhi and Bangalore.
Kore has been responsible for getting University status for the society’s Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Belgaum and Institute of Dental Sciences Belgaum as ‘KLE University’, Belgaum. Further, he has ushered in an era of collaborations in health sciences by entering into MoUs with universities of Illinois, Chicago, and Sunderland (UK). Yet another remarkable achievement of his has been the establishment of a sophisticated 1000-bed KLE Hospital and M.R.C., with investment exceeding Rs.110 crores. Apart from providing useful teaching material to students of medical science, KLE 820-bed charitable hospital, Belgaum is serving as a lifeline of the poor and downtrodden people of the region. Thus, he has made Belgaum the hub of Education and Health care. For this outstanding and selfless contribution of a great sacrifice, the K.L.E.Society named this great monument of national pride after him as KLES Prabhakar Kore Hospital and M.R.C., Belgaum. 
Kore is ... legendary architect of a resurgent KLE that has grown from 38 in 1984 into an organization of global excellence of 216 institutions; progressive leader whose missionary zeal & firm commitment have pioneered the KLE march in health sciences education and research; compassionate soul who has brought state-of-the-art health care services to the door-step of the people; world citizen who has ensured cross-cultural integration through international academic collaborations; messiah who has become a local-lore by providing urban infrastructure in the rural areas to harness the local talent; rare visionary who has redefined & redesigned the KLE for the 21st century; accomplished educationist who has led the KLE relentlessly along the path envisioned by the ‘Saptarishis.’

Fidel Maíz

Father Fidel Maíz (March 8, 1828 in Arroyos y Esteros, Cordillera Department) was a priest in Paraguay. He is considered one of the best speakers of his time. He also had a great writing ability, brilliant and rich, he had a great participation in the important moments of the history of his country. The figure of Maiz crosses six decades of national history.
Childhood and Youth.
Francisco Fidel Maíz was born from a legal and religious wedding between Juan Jose Maiz and Prudencia Acuña
Francisco Fidel Maíz, had 10 brothers, from which only were left 2 at the end of Paraguayan War. Fidel Maiz learned the first letters in the school of his town, Arroyos y Esteros, later on he moved to the capital city of Asunción, so as to enter the institute of the Argentine master José Joaquin Palacios.
He was lucky to coincide with the opening of the education, which followed the death of the dictator José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia, which was known to have been a dictator who closed all the educational institutions of our country. He continued his studies at the Academia Literaria, under the supervision of the master Marco Antonio Maiz, his uncle.
First Steps.
His oldest brother was also a priest and was ordained a priest before him, and was in charge of the church of Lambaré and Valenzuela. Francisco Fidel Maiz, once ordained priest, was in charge of the church of Arroyos y Esteros, since 1856
In 1859 he leaves this responsibility due to a request of the President of the Republic, Carlos Antonio López, to take over the position of the first dean of the Councilor Seminar. In the Seminar, he teaches Moral Theology and Canonry. One of the most interesting characteristic of his personality is that, unlike many of his contemporary and others after him, he did not need to leave the country to reach a good intellectual formation as well as a very high level culture.
Even in the solitude of the time, and with scarce cultural activities, Fidel Maiz had access to the principal thinkers of the time, some of them even opposite to the catholic, which gave strength to his thoughts. When Don Carlos Antonio López died, and once his son Francisco Solano López took over the presidency, the difficulties of Father Maiz and the new president began, because he had kept a very distant position, or at least not openly in favor to his designation.
So, also with the Obispo Palacios, Father Fidel Maiz, was sent to jail during four years, until a little before the Battle of Curupayty. Until then, Maiz had been a friend of Solano Lopez, but he did not reduce the repression of the opponents to the Father Maiz. After the Great WAR, and for a while he was a prisoner in Brazil, at 42, the father Maiz had a lot to do and to say.
The father Fidel Maiz arrived to our country on December 5, 1870, after months of prison in Brazil. That same day, after getting off the boat and settling down, he went to the National Governor's house to greet the President of the Republic, Cirilo Antonio Rivarola. Maiz asked if from the new government, there were going to be any inconveniences to practice the priesthood, and the president Rivarola answered that yes, it was very important the participation of all Paraguayans in the re construction of the country.
So, after having arrived to Asunicion, father Fidel Maiz began working to re direct his life. He still had something else to do, the interview with the father Fideliz Maria de Avola, who had the title of Foreign Vicary, responsible for the church of Paraguay. This priest denied dealing with Maiz, putting as an excuse the order of the Delegate of Brazil and declared him suspended in his priesthood functions.
Trajectory.
Maíz received the communication on December 26: You are forbidden to make any sacrament as a priest. The next day, Maiz answered this prohibition with a very strong letter, and practically declared himself rebellious. When most of the churches were closed to Maiz, the presbytery Blas Duarte appeared, he was the priest of San Roque, who offered him to go with him to the pulpit in the mass of homage to the patron of Paraguay, San Blas.
Maiz doubted and after nine years of silence as a priest in the capital of the Republic, his voice sounded. The bishop Moreno, in the moment of this consecration, was very ill.
Like the rest of the members of the national cleric, Moreno was strongly opposite to a foreigner ruling the Paraguayan church, in fact, the article three of the new national constitution established that the chief of the church must be a native Paraguayan. Because of this, father Moreno chose a successor, through a document, to the father Maiz, until Rome spoke about it again.
On May 30, 1874, the bishop Moreno died; two days after Maiz sent the document to the minister of Cult, and six months later arrives to the bishop's office the notice of official acceptance of the document and the naming of him. When he returns from Rome, Maiz received the responsibility to direct the house of the Encarnación. He remained there for some time, but with the possibility that his acts were badly interpreted, he requested his moving to his home town of Arroyos y Esteros. There he begins a long way during which he worked for his community creating among other things, a school for children of the zone.
He kept correspondence with some of the most important intellectuals of this time, such as Juan E O`Leary, and Ignacio A.Pane.
He was a great friend of Juan Sinforiano Bogarín, who went with him in his first tour around the country as a chief of the Paraguayan Church.
In his writings, Maiz begins clearing his name as a Paraguayan citizen, and was compromised in a deathly war and did not doubt to defend his country. With a lot of tact, he takes care of remembering the beginning of the war, when he was a prisoner, so he did not have a chance to have any relation in the political, diplomatic, or military decisions adopted at that time by the Paraguayan Government.
"Torched by the situation of my country, and being the orders of my legitimate superior, I assumed the soldier's attitude without hurting my condition of priest, that with such a ministry, does not forget his natural condition of citizen.", he says in some of his writings. After putting emphasis in the extraordinary circumstances of a deathly war that forced them to take grave decisions, father Fidel Maiz rejects the responsibility of having had anything to do with the bloodshed, and requests a cleaning of his name and the canonic inability.
The letter is dated November 9, 1870. A little after this, the Empire put at the disposal of a group of prisoners, a transport to come back, and among them there was a priest.
Style.
Francisco Fidel Maiz, was different from all his contemporary and others who came after him, he did not need to go out of the country to reach an intellectual formation as well as a high culture. Even in his solitude during the dictatorship of Dr Gaspar Rodriguez de Francia, with the scarce development of cultural activities, he had access to the main thinkers of his time, intellectuals, some of them confronting the Catholic Church, which gave strength to his thoughts.
Close to the most relevant people of his time, he was a controversial priest and politician.
Works.
His book "Etapas de mi vida", where he tells the stories when the bullets were heard when Francisco Solano López took over the presidency, and he could not suppressed an exclamation "why are they sounding so many bells".

Engelbert Schücking

Engelbert Schücking (born 1926, in English-language works often cited as E. L. Schucking) is a physics professor at New York University in New York City. His research interests are theoretical astrophysics, general relativity and cosmology.
Biography.
Engelbert Schücking was born on May 23, 1926, in Hörde, Germany. He manifested an interest in astronomy at a very early age, and by the age of fourteen, he was actively engaged in counting sunspots. He then studied mathematics and physics at the University of Münster, and later at Goettingen. His professors included such luminaries as Werner Heisenberg, Richard Becker and Pohl.
He started working in the field of general relativity with the great German physicist Pascual Jordan in Hamburg, in 1952, and he earned his PhD there in 1955. It is with P.Jordan that he found the locus of his life's work, namely the geometric aspects of general relativity and Einstein's field equations. 
He moved to the US in 1961, where he became Research associate, first at Syracuse, then at Cornell. He moved to the University of Texas at Austin in 1962, where he became Professor of Physics. There, he started a group working on general relativity, comprising such first rate physicists as Roger Penrose, Roy Kerr, Ray Sachs and Jürgen Ehlers. In 1967, he was appointed as Professor of Physics at New York University, where he had many students, including some twenty successful PhD candidates. Some of these students went on to become famous specialists in the field of general relativity: Eli Honig, Richard Greene, C.V.Vishveshwara, to name but a few.
He published numerous papers and co-authored many books about gravitation, cosmology, black holes...
A misnomer.
Despite its title, the book: "On Einstein's Path: Essays in Honor of E.L. Schucking (Springer)" is in fact a collection of essays on various advanced aspects of general relativity and cosmology. Although written "in honor" of Englebert Schücking, these essays have very little to do with Schücking himself. Only the Preface (written by Alex Harvey), and the first(written by Schücking) and last essays contain some historical material related to this physicist, from which the current article was inspired. Therefore, it is not recommended for anyone with less than a PhD in general relativity and related subjects.

Nielsen transformation

In mathematics, especially in the area of abstract algebra known as combinatorial group theory, Nielsen transformations, named after Jakob Nielsen, are certain automorphisms of a free group which are a non-commutative analogue of row reduction and one of the main tools used in studying free groups, . They were introduced in to prove that every subgroup of a free group is free (the Nielsen–Schreier theorem), but are now used in a variety of mathematics, including computational group theory, k-theory, and knot theory. The textbook devotes all of chapter 3 to Nielsen transformations.
Definitions.
One of the simplest definitions of a Nielsen transformation is an automorphism of a free group, but this was not their original definition. The following gives a more constructive definition.
A Nielsen transformation on a finitely generated free group with ordered basis [ "x"1, …, "x""n" ] can be factored into elementary Nielsen transformations of the following sorts:
These transformations are the analogues of the elementary row operations. Transformations of the first two kinds are analogous to row swaps, and cyclic row permutations. Transformations of the third kind correspond to scaling a row by an invertible scalar. Transformations of the fourth kind correspond to row additions.
Transformations of the first two types suffice to permute the generators in any order, so the third type may be applied to any of the generators, and the fourth type to any pair of generators.
When dealing with groups that are not free, one instead applies these transformations to finite ordered subsets of a group. In this situation,
compositions of the elementary transformations are called regular. If one allows removing elements of the subset that are the identity element, then the transformation is called singular.
The image under a Nielsen transformation (elementary or not, regular or not) of a generating set of a group "G" is also a generating set of "G". Two generating sets are called Nielsen equivalent if there is a Nielsen transformation taking one to the other. If the generating sets have the same size, then it suffices to consider compositions of regular, elementary Nielsen transformations.
Examples.
The dihedral group of order 10 has two Nielsen equivalence classes of generating sets of size 2. Letting "x" be an element of order 2, and "y" being an element of order 5, the two classes of generating sets are represented by [ "x", "y" ] and [ "x", "yy" ], and each class has 15 distinct elements. A very important generating set of a dihedral group is the generating set from its presentation as a Coxeter group. Such a generating set for a dihedral group of order 10 consists of any pair of elements of order 2, such as [ "x", "xy" ]. This generating set is equivalent to [ "x", "y" ] via the complicated:
Unlike [ "x", "y" ] and [ "x", "yy" ], the generating sets [ "x", "y", 1 ] and [ "x", "yy", 1 ] are equivalent. A transforming sequence using more convenient elementary transformations (all swaps, all inverses, all products) is:
Applications.
Nielsen–Schreier theorem.
In , a straightforward combinatorial proof is given that finitely generated subgroups of free groups are free. A generating set is called Nielsen reduced if there is not too much cancellation in products. The paper shows that every finite generating set of a subgroup of a free group is (singularly) Nielsen equivalent to a Nielsen reduced generating set, and that a Nielsen reduced generating set is a free basis for the subgroup, so the subgroup is free. This proof is given in some detail in .
Automorphism groups.
In , it is shown that the automorphism defined by the elementary Nielsen transformations generate the full automorphism group of a finitely generated free group. Nielsen, and later Neumann used these ideas to give finite presentations of the automorphism groups of free groups. This is also described in the textbook .
For a given generating set of a finite group (not necessarily free), not every automorphism is given by a Nielsen transformation, but for every automorphism, there is a generating set where the automorphism is given by a Nielsen transformation, .
Word problem.
A particularly simple case of the word problem for groups and the isomorphism problem for groups asks if a finitely presented group is the trivial group. This is known to be intractable in general, even though there is a finite sequence of elementary Tietze transformations taking the presentation to the trivial presentation if and only if the group is trivial. A special case is that of "balanced presentations", those finite presentations with equal numbers of generators and relators. For these groups, there is a conjecture that the required transformations are quite a bit simpler (in particular, do not involve adding or removing relators). If one allows taking the set of relators to any Nielsen equivalent set, and one allows conjugating the relators, then one gets an equivalence relation on ordered subsets of a relators of a finitely presented group. The Andrews–Curtis conjecture is that the relators of any balanced presentation of the trivial group are equivalent to a set of trivial relators, stating that each generator is the identity element.
In the textbook , an application of Nielsen transformations is given to solve the generalized word problem for free groups, also known as the membership problem for subgroups given by finite generating sets in free groups.
Isomorphism problem.
A particularly important special case of the isomorphism problem for groups concerns the fundamental groups of three-dimensional knots, which can be solved using Nielsen transformations and a method of Alexander .
Product replacement algorithm.
In computational group theory, it is important to generate random elements of a finite group. Popular methods of doing this apply markov chain methods to generate random generating sets of the group. The "product replacement algorithm" simply uses randomly chosen Nielsen transformations in order to take a random walk on the graph of generating sets of the group. The algorithm is well studied, and survey is given in . One version of the algorithm, called "shake", is:
The generating set used during the course of this algorithm can be proved to vary uniformly over all Nielsen equivalent generating sets. However, this algorithm has a number of statistical and theoretical problems. For instance, there can be more than one Nielsen equivalence class of generators. Also, the elements of generating sets need be uniformly distributed (for instance, elements of the Frattini subgroup can never occur in a generating set of minimal size, but more subtle problems occur too).
Most of these problems are quickly remedied in the following modification called "rattle", :
K-theory.
To understand Nielsen equivalence of non-minimal generating sets, module theoretic investigations have been useful, as in . Continuing in these lines, a K-theoretic formulation of the obstruction to Nielsen equivalence was described in and . These show an important connection between the Whitehead group of the group ring and the Nielsen equivalence classes of generators.

Tea in the United Kingdom

Since the 18th century the United Kingdom has been one of the largest per capita tea consumers in the world, with each citizen consuming on average 1.9 kg per year. The popularity of tea occasioned the furtive export of slips, a small shoot for planting or twig for grafting to tea plants, from China to British India and its commercial culture there, beginning in 1840; British interests controlled tea production in the subcontinent. Tea, which was an upper-class drink in Europe, became the infusion of every class in Great Britain in the course of the 18th century and has remained so.
In Britain, the drinking of tea is so varied that it is quite hard to generalise, but usually it is served with milk and sometimes with lemon. Strong tea can be served with milk and occasionally one or two teaspoons of sugar in a mug, and is commonly referred to as "builder's tea". The expression "cream tea" does not refer to cream mixed into the beverage but to a meal in which tea is taken along with scones and clotted cream, and usually strawberry jam as well. (This tradition originated from Devon and Cornwall.) 
Much of the time in the United Kingdom, tea drinking is not the delicate, refined cultural expression that some might imagine: a cup (or commonly a mug) of tea is something drunk often, with the most serious drinkers drinking four or more cups of tea before leaving the house for work. It is not uncommon for up to 10 cups of tea to be drunk each day.
History.
Before it became Britain's number one drink, China tea was introduced in the coffeehouses of London shortly before the Stuart Restoration (1660); about that time Thomas Garraway, a coffeehouse owner in London, had to explain the new beverage in pamphlet and an advertisement in "Mercurius Politicus" for 30 September 1658 offered "That Excellent, and by all Physicians approved, "China" drink, called by the "Chinese", "Tcha", by other nations "Tay alias Tee", ...sold at the Sultaness-head, ye "Cophee-house" in Sweetings-Rents, by the Royal Exchange, "London"". In London "Coffee, chocolate and a kind of drink called "tee"" were "sold in almost every street in 1659", according to Thomas Rugge's "Diurnall". Tea was mainly consumed by the fashionably rich: Samuel Pepys, curious for every novelty, tasted the new drink in 1660: September "I did send for a cup of tee, (a China drink) of which I had never had drunk before". Two pounds, two ounces were formally presented to Charles II by the British East India Company that same year. The tea had been imported to Portugal from its possessions in Asia as well as through the trade merchants maintained with China and Japan. In 1662 Charles II's Portuguese queen, Catherine of Braganza, introduced the act of drinking tea, which quickly spread throughout court and country and to the English bourgeoisie. The British East India company, which had been supplied with tea at the Dutch factory of Batavia imported it directly from China from 1669. In 1672, a servant of Baron Herbert in London sent his instructions for tea making, and warming the delicate cups, to Shropshire;"The directions for the tea are: a quart of spring water just boiled, to which put a spoonful of tea, and sweeten to the palate with candy sugar. As soon as the tea and sugar are in, the steam must be kept in as much as may be, and let it lie half or quarter of an hour in the heat of the fire but not boil. The little cups must be held over the steam before the liquid be put in."
Between 1720 and 1750 the imports of tea to Britain through the British East India Company more than quadrupled. Fernand Braudel queried, "is it true to say the new drink replaced gin in England?" By 1766, exports from Canton stood at 6 million pounds on British boats, compared with 4.5 on Dutch ships, 2.4 on Swedish, 2.1 on French. Veritable "tea fleets" grew up. Tea was particularly interesting to the Atlantic world not only because it was easy to cultivate but also because of how easy it was to prepare and its ability to revive the spirits and cure mild colds: "Home, and there find my wife making of tea", Pepys recorded under 28 June 1667, "a drink which Mr. Pelling the Pottecary tells her is good for her colds and defluxions".
The earliest English equipages for making tea date to the 1660s. Small porcelain tea bowls were used by the fashionable; they were occasionally shipped with the tea itself. Tea-drinking spurred the search for a European imitation of Chinese porcelain, first successfully produced in England at the Chelsea porcelain manufactory, established around 1743-45 and quickly imitated.
Between 1872 and 1884 the supply of tea to the British Empire increased with the expansion of the railway to the east. The demand however was not proportional, which caused the prices to rise. Nevertheless, from 1884 onward due to new innovation in tea preparation the price of tea dropped and remained relatively low throughout the first half of the 20th century. Soon afterwards London became the centre of the international tea trade. With high tea imports also came a large increase in the demand for porcelain. The demand for tea cups, pots and dishes increased to go along with this popular new drink. Now, people in Britain drink tea multiple times a day. As the years passed it became a drink less associated with high society as people of all classes drink tea today which can be enjoyed in many different flavours and ways.
British style tea.
Even very slightly formal events can be a cause for cups and saucers to be used instead of mugs. A typical semi-formal British tea ritual might run as follows (the host performing all actions unless noted):
Whether to put milk into the cup before or after the tea is, and has been since at least the late 20th century, a matter of some debate with claims that adding milk at the different times alters the flavour of the tea. The heating of milk above 75 degrees Celsius (adding milk after the tea is poured, not before) does cause denaturation of the lactalbumin and lactoglobulin. This may affect the flavour. In addition to considerations of flavour, the order of these steps is thought to have been, historically, an indication of class. Only those wealthy enough to afford good quality porcelain would be confident of its being able to cope with being exposed to boiling water unadulterated with milk.
There is also a proper manner in which to drink tea when using a cup and saucer. If one is seated at a table, the proper manner to drink tea is to raise the teacup only, placing it back into the saucer in between sips. When standing or sitting in a chair without a table, one holds the tea saucer with the off hand and the tea cup in the dominant hand. When not in use, the tea cup is placed back in the tea saucer and held in one's lap or at waist height. In either event, the tea cup should never be held or waved in the air. Fingers should be curled inwards, no finger should extend away from the handle of the cup.
Drinking tea from the saucer (poured from the cup in order to cool it) was not uncommon at one time but is now almost universally considered a breach of etiquette.
Tea as a meal.
"Tea" is not only the name of the beverage, but of a late afternoon light meal at four o'clock, irrespective of the beverage consumed. Anna Russell, Duchess of Bedford is credited with the creation of the meal circa 1800. She thought of the idea to ward off hunger between luncheon and dinner, which was served later and later. The tradition continues to this day.
There used to be a tradition of tea rooms in the UK which provided the traditional fare of cream and jam on scones, a combination commonly known as "cream tea". However, these establishments have declined in popularity since World War II. In Devon and Cornwall particularly, cream teas are a speciality. A.B.C. tea shops and Lyons Corner Houses were a successful chain of such establishments. In Yorkshire the company Bettys and Taylors of Harrogate, run their own Tearooms. Bettys Café Tearooms, established in 1919, is now classed as a British Institution. In America it is a common misconception that "cream tea" refers to tea served with cream (as opposed to milk). This is certainly not the case. It simply means that tea is served with a scone with clotted cream and jam.
Industrial Revolution.
Some scholars suggest that tea played a role in British Industrial Revolution. Afternoon tea possibly became a way to increase the number of hours labourers could work in factories (e.g. trolley service); the stimulants in the tea, accompanied by sugary snacks (such as cream horns) would give workers energy to finish out the day's work. Further, tea helped alleviate some of the consequences of the urbanization that accompanied the industrial revolution: drinking tea required boiling one's water, thereby killing water-borne diseases like dysentery, cholera, and typhoid.
Tea cards.
In the United Kingdom, and to a certain extent, Canada, a number of varieties of loose tea sold in packets from the 1940s to the 1980s contained tea cards. These were illustrated cards roughly the same size as cigarette cards and intended to be collected by children. Perhaps the best known were Typhoo tea and Brooke Bond (manufacturer of PG Tips), the latter of whom also provided albums for collectors to keep their cards in. Some renowned artists were commissioned to illustrate the cards including Charles Tunnicliffe. Many of these card collections are now valuable collectors' items.
A related phenomenon arose in the early 1990s when PG Tips released a series of tea-based Pogs, with pictures of cups of tea and chimpanzees on them. Tetley's tea released competing pogs but never matched the popularity of the PG Tips variety.
Tea today.
In 2003, "DataMonitor" reported that regular tea drinking in the United Kingdom was on the decline. There was a 10.25 percent decline in the purchase of normal teabags in Britain between 1997 and 2002. Sales of ground coffee also fell during the same period. Britons were instead drinking health-oriented beverages like fruit and/or tisanes, consumption of which increased 50 percent from 1997 to 2002. A further, unexpected, statistic is that the sales of decaffeinated tea and coffee fell even faster during this period than the sale of the more common varieties. In 2011, espresso sales were higher than tea sales.

Transcode (software)

Transcode is a free audio/video transcoder with a command-line interface for Unix-like operating systems. It uses FFmpeg's libavcodec library, and supports numerous formats (such as DV, MPEG-2, MPEG-4 Part 2, H.264, PVN
as well as all the formats supported by libavcodec). It also includes a variety of pre/post filters for denoising, deinterlacing, smoothing, sharpening, etc. As for container formats, transcode was designed around AVI, and support for output to more modern container formats is still limited. For example, current versions of transcode do not support multiplexing into the popular MP4 container format; external tools must be used instead. Besides the main transcoding tool (the transcode executable itself), the package also contains a number of tools (avimerge, avisplit, tccat, tcextract etc.) for (de)multiplexing, concatenation, and other similar operations on multimedia files and streams.
Transcode was first released in 2001. It was developed for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. There is no version for Microsoft Windows, and the developers have no plans to create one.

Deutscher Fernsehfunk

Deutscher Fernsehfunk (DFF), known from 1972 to 1990 as Fernsehen der DDR (DDR-FS), was the state television broadcaster in East Germany.
History.
Foundation.
Radio was the dominant medium in the former Eastern bloc, with television being considered low on the priority list when compiling Five-Year Plans during the industrialisation of the 1950s. In Germany, the situation was different as East and West Germany were in competition over available frequencies for broadcasts and for viewers across the Iron Curtain. The West German Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk (NWDR) had made early plans to begin television broadcasts in its area, which originally included West Berlin. The first western test broadcasts were made in 1950.
The GDR authorities therefore also made an early start with television and began construction of a television centre in Adlershof on 11 June 1950. The GDR television service began experimental test broadcasts on 20 December 1951. The NWDR announced plans to begin a regular television service from Hamburg starting with Christmas 1952. This spurred the East German authorities into further action.
A relay transmitter in the centre of East Berlin was built in February 1952 and connected to Adlershof on 3 June. On 16 November, the first television sets were made available to the public at 3500 East German marks each.
Regular public programming, although still described as testing, began on 21 December 1952 - Joseph Stalin's birthday - with two hours a day of programmes. Continuity announcer Margit Schaumäker welcomed viewers at 20:00 and introduced the station's logo - the Brandenburg Gate. Speeches by senior figures in the television organisation followed, then the first edition of the East German national news programme, "Aktuelle Kamera", presented by Herbert Köfer.
Party policy in East Germany was to censor the "mass media". As television had a limited audience, it was not classed as a mass medium and therefore "Aktuelle Kamera" was, at first, uncensored and even critical. This situation changed after the television service reported accurately on the uprising in East Germany on 17 June 1953. The director was removed and news was then sourced from official outlets.
Growth.
Once television was established, the transmitter network grew quickly.
Technology and TV studios also extended quickly. In the summer of 1953, "Studio I" was opened at Adlershof. In 1955 the first mobile transmission unit and a third broadcasting studio were added to the system.
On 2 January 1956 the "official test program" of the television centre in Berlin ended, and on 3 January the national "Deutscher Fernsehfunk" ("German Television Broadcasting" - DFF) began transmitting.
The new television service was deliberately not called "GDR Television", as the intention was to provide an all-German service, as was the case with the west. However, the geography of Germany prevented this - despite placing high-power transmitters in border areas, the GDR could not penetrate the entirety of West Germany. West German broadcasts (particularly ARD) easily reached most of East Germany except for the extreme south-east (most notably Dresden, the area being in a deep valley, leading to its old East German nickname of "Tal der Ahnungslosen", or "Valley of the Clueless") and the extreme north-east (around Rügen, Greifswald, Neubrandenburg and beyond).
By the end of 1958, there were over 300,000 television sets in the GDR.
News and political programming on DFF was usually scheduled not to clash with similar programming on Western channels (as most viewers would probably have preferred the western programmes). For example, the main news program, "Aktuelle Kamera", was scheduled at 19:30, between ZDF's "heute" at 19:00 and ARD's "Tagesschau" at 20:00. However, popular entertainment programming (such as "Ein Kessel Buntes") was scheduled to clash with Western news or current affairs programmes in the hope of discouraging viewers from watching the Western programmes. Other popular items (such as films) were scheduled before or after propaganda programmes like "Der schwarze Kanal" in the hope that viewers tuning in early to catch the film would see the programme.
From 7 October 1958, DFF introduced morning programmes - repeats of the previous night's programming for shift workers, broadcast under the title "Wir wiederholen für Spätarbeiter" ("We repeat for late workers").
DFF/DDR-FS produced a number of educational programmes for use in schools, including programmes on chemistry, history, local history and geography, literature, physics, civics, and Russian. Also produced was "ESP": "Einführung in die sozialistische Produktion" ("An introduction to Socialist production") and an English-learners course, "English for You". Many of these programmes are archived and are available from the DRA in Babelsberg.
The Berlin Wall.
After the construction of the Berlin Wall in August 1961, the GDR began a programme to attempt to prevent its citizens from watching broadcasts from the western ARD. The GDR had its diplomatic hands tied: jamming the broadcasts with any degree of effectiveness would also interfere with reception within West Germany (breaching treaties and inviting retaliation). Instead, the Free German Youth, "Freie Deutsche Jugend" (FDJ), the official youth movement in the GDR, started the campaign ""Blitz contra Natosender"" - "Strike against NATO's stations" - to encourage young people to remove or damage aerials pointing at the west. The term "Republikfluchtigen" (defection by television) was sometimes used to describe the widespread practice of viewing "Westfernsehen" (Western TV). Nevertheless, people continued to watch ARD broadcasts, leading to Der schwarze Kanal.
Colour and DFF2.
Colour television was introduced on 3 October 1969 on the new channel DFF2, which commenced broadcasting the same day, ready for the celebrations for the 20th anniversary of the founding of the GDR on 7 October. DFF chose the French SÉCAM colour standard, common in the Eastern Bloc, while West Germany had settled on the PAL standard. Mutual reception in black and white remained possible as the basic television standard was the same and remained that way. However, colour sets were not widely available in the East and when they could be obtained, many people altered television sets to be dual standard and allow reception in colour of West German programming. Later East German manufacturers made dual standard sets.
The introduction of DFF2 marked an increase in the hours of broadcasting overall.
On 11 February 1972, the DFF was renamed, dropping the pretense of being an all-German service and becoming "Fernsehen der DDR" - "GDR Television" or DDR-FS. The previous name survived in episodes of "The Sandman", which were repeated quite often.
Since DFF2/DDR-F2 only broadcast in the evening for most of its lifespan, special transmissions could easily be made in the afternoon for special events.
1980 Olympic Games.
The hosting of the 1980 Summer Olympics by Moscow was a source of pride for the Eastern Bloc. However, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 had caused outrage in the west, leading to a boycott of the games by 64 western-aligned nations.
DDR-FS therefore wished to present colour pictures of the games to West Germany, which was part of the boycott, and a programme of experimental transmissions in PAL was instituted (while dual standard sets were the norm in the East in order to watch Western programmes, the Western population had little inclination to buy dual standard sets to watch Eastern programmes). However, little came of these experiments. By 1985 there were 6,078,500 licensed televisions, or 36.5 for every 100 persons.
Gorizont: satellite television.
In 1988, the USSR-built Gorizont satellite was launched, providing television programming to much of Europe and northern Africa, and even eastern parts of the Americas. The programmes of all the Eastern European socialist republics, including DDR-F1, were broadcast on the satellite.
Collapse of the GDR.
In 1989, the GDR made an attempt to bring its young people closer to the state and distract them from the media of the West. A new young-person's programme, "Elf 99" (1199 being the postal code of the Adlershof studios) was created as part of this plan.
However, the plan was not successful as the GDR itself began to dissolve under economic and popular political pressure brought about by the reforms in Moscow under Mikhail Gorbachev.
At first, DDR-FS stuck to the party line and barely reported the mass protests in the country. However, after Erich Honecker was removed from office on 18 October 1989 and the rule of the SED began to break down, DDR-FS reformed their programmes to remove propaganda and to report news freely. The main propaganda programme, "Der schwarze Kanal" (The Black Channel) - which ran West German TV news items with an explanatory commentary informing viewers of the "real" stories and meanings behind the pictures and generally criticising Western media (Particularly ARD and ZDF) - stopped on 30 October 1989.
By the time the borders opened on 9 November, the main news programme on DDR2 was being produced without censorship or interference, and so it covered the events in full. In recognition of its reliable coverage, the programme was re-broadcast on the West German channel 3sat. DDR-FS joined the 3sat consortium in February 1990. DDR-FS became almost completely separate from the state apparatus, starting a number of new programme strands, including a free and open debate programme on Thursdays, complete with critical phone-in contributions from viewers. At first this had to be handled very carefully, as the Stasi - the state secret police - were still operating and had an office in the studios.
In February 1990, the Volkskammer passed a media resolution defining DDR-FS as a politically independent public broadcasting system. A law passed by the Volkskammer in September 1990 made this a legal requirement. On 4 March 1990, emphasising the change and reflecting the forthcoming reunification, "DDR1" and "DDR2" were renamed back to "DFF1" and "DFF2".
Reunification.
Upon reunification on 3 October 1990, the DFF ceased to be the state broadcaster of the former GDR. Because the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany reserves broadcasting as a matter for the German states "(Länder)", the Federal Government was not permitted to continue to run a broadcasting service. Article 36 of the Unification Treaty (Einigungsvertrag) between the two German states (signed on 31 August 1990) required that DFF was to be dissolved by 31 December 1991 and that the former West German television broadcasting system be extended to replace it.
On 15 December 1990, the ARD's Das Erste channel took over the frequencies of DFF1. Das Erste had regional opt-outs during the first part of the evening, but the former GDR did not have ARD broadcasters to fill these spaces. Therefore, DFF continued to provide programmes until 31 December 1991 in these slots:
Successors.
The dissolution of DFF and its replacement by "Länder"-based ARD broadcasters remained controversial throughout the process. 
Employees of the DFF were worried about job prospects in the new broadcasters and also had a loyalty to the DFF. Viewers, accustomed to the DFF's programming, were concerned at the loss of favourite shows and the choice most viewers had between West and East channels. The new Länder considered keeping a form of DFF running as the equivalent to the ARD members' "third programme" in other regions. However, political opinion was against centralisation and in favour of the new devolved system brought in from the west.
Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia agreed to pool their broadcasts into Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR), an ARD member broadcaster based in Leipzig. Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Brandenburg, and Berlin considered pooling their broadcasts into "Nordostdeutschen Rundfunkanstalt" - Northeast German Broadcasting (NORA). Another alternative was for Brandenburg and Berlin to consolidate and for Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to have its own broadcaster.
No agreement could be reached between the three "Länder"; Mecklenburg therefore joined the existing Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR), while the existing Sender Freies Berlin (SFB) expanded to the whole of the city and a new broadcaster, Ostdeutscher Rundfunk Brandenburg (ORB) was launched for Brandenburg. 
DFF finally ended on 31 December 1991. The new organisations began transmissions the next day, on 1 January 1992. On 1 May 2003, SFB and ORB merged to form Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg (RBB).
Programmes.
The Monday evening feature film (usually an entertainment movie from the 1930s/40s) was one of the more popular items on DFF.
"Sandmännchen".
On 8 October 1958, DFF imported "Sandmännchen" (the little Sandman) from radio. Both East and West television ran versions of this idea: an animated film that told a children's story and then and sent them to bed before the programmes for adults began at 19:00. With several generations of children growing up with the Sandman, it has remained a popular childhood memory.
The West version was discontinued by the ARD upon reunification; however, stations in the former GDR continued to play clips from the East's Sandman every night, and RBB still continues the practice as does KIKA. The character plays an important background role in the popular 2003 tragicomedy film "Good Bye Lenin!", symbolising the feelings of loss of the main character played by Daniel Brühl.
Technical information.
Broadcast system.
When television broadcasting started, the GDR chose to use the Western European B/G transmission system rather than the Eastern European D/K system, in order to keep transmissions compatible with West Germany. Of course, this made East German television incompatible with the other Eastern Bloc countries, although the D/K system was used prior to 1957.
Irregular channels.
Although DFF decided to revert to Western Europe's standard, the first broadcasts used a set of seven VHF channels some of which were not in line with any other system at the time.
Eventually (around 1960), the channels standard to Western Europe were adopted.
In what may have been attempt to frustrate reception (in some areas) of ARD some early TV sets manufactured in the GDR only tuned the seven channels used by DFF (rather than the full set of 11 VHF channels). Later (following the launch of the second network) UHF tuners were added but early versions only covered the lower part of the band.
Colour.
However, when colour television was introduced, the SÉCAM system was chosen rather than the West German PAL. The incompatibilities between the two colour systems are small, allowing for pictures to be watched in monochrome on non-compatible sets. (Most sets in the GDR were monochrome anyway.) Many East Germans had PAL modules fitted to allow colour reception of West German programmes; the official sale of dual standard sets in East Germany started in December 1977. The same applied in West Germany. There were experimental PAL broadcasts most notably during the 1980 Moscow Olympics (which got little coverage on West German television due to the boycott).
With reunification, it was decided to switch to the PAL colour system. The system was changed between the end of DFF programmes on 14 December 1990 and the opening of ARD programmes on 15 December. The transmission authorities made the (correct) assumption that most East Germans had either dual standard or monochrome sets; those who did not could purchase decoders.
Technical innovations.
DDR-FS was the first television broadcaster in Germany to introduce the Betacam magnetic recording system. Betacam was later adopted by all German broadcasters and is still in use by ARD and ZDF.
In 1983 DDR-FS also pioneered the use of Steadicam equipment for live reporting.
Finance.
Broadcasting in the GDR was financed by a compulsory licence fee. An annual fee of 10.50 Ostmarks was charged for a joint television and radio licence. A separate radio or car radio licence cost between 0.50 and 2 Ostmarks. (At one time, there was a slightly lower rate for viewers not equipped with the UHF aerials necessary to receive the second channel, however, this arrangement was seen as impractical and abandoned)
In addition, broadcasting was heavily subsidised by the state. For example, in 1982, the GDR realized revenues of 115.4 million Ostmarks through licence fees, while the amount budgeted in 1983 for the television service alone was 222 million Ostmarks.
Advertising.
Advertising - in the form of "commercial" magazine programmes - had appeared on GDR television from 1959. However, in a command economy, there was little or no competition between brands, so advertising was limited to informing viewers what products were available. By 1975, the advertising magazines gave up the pretence of being western-style commercial programmes and converted to being "shoppers guides", listing availability and prices of goods.
With the end of the Communist system, spot advertising was introduced to DFF in order to better cover the system's cost. The French advertising agency "Information et Publicité" was engaged to produce and sell commercials and airtime on the DFF networks.
Archives.
The archives of the GDR radio and television stations are administered by "German Broadcasting Archive" (Deutsches Rundfunkarchiv - DRA) at Babelsberg in Potsdam.

M.A. Mendes de Leon

Maurice Arthur Mendes de Leon (4 July 1856, Bruges - 16 December 1924, Amsterdam) was a Dutch physician, considered one of the founding fathers of gynaecology in the Netherlands, partly because of his surgical skills, but also due to his study into the interaction between gynaecological and psychological problems.
Mendes de Leon was the son of Isaac Mendes de Leon (1808–1856) and Annely F. Phillips. He grew up in his mothers country, England, until the age of ten, after which the family moved to Amsterdam. He studied medicines at the University of Amsterdam and in 1881 obtained a PhD at the University of Heidelberg. In 1882 he married his distant relative Anna Mathilde Teixeira de Mattos (1862–1937).
He promoted gynaecology in the Netherlands as a separate speciality, partly because of the new surgical possibilities following the discoveries of anaesthesia and antisepsis and in 1889 he started a private gynaecological clinic at the Sarphatistraat in Amsterdam. In his clinic he devoted himself to the surgery of ovarian tumours, uterus myomatosus and genital prolapse, but also to the diagnosis and treatment of supposed inflammations of the cervix and endometrium as cause of psychological disorders. In this he followed the opinions of contemporary English gynaecologists. As he was not aware of physiological histology, he nearly always found signs of inflammation. He treated this with curettage and drastic caustics, sometimes after using a dilation knife (hysterotome) for the cervix. At the turn of the twentieth century Dutch gynaecologists such as Treub and Nijhoff began to cast doubt on such theories of "reflex neurosis", but Mendes de Leon persisted in his views.

Plot summary.
Page Clarke is a 40-year-old-happily married woman who lives with her 44-year-old husband, Brad Clarke, her 15-year-old daughter, Allyson and 7-year-old son Andrew. One night Brad goes on an unexpected business trip to Cleveland and Allyson reports she is going to have dinner with her friend Chloe and Chloe's father, Trygve Thorensen. Instead Allyson goes out with Chloe and two older boys named Jamie Applegate and Phillip Chapman. While crossing the Golden Gate Bridge the teenagers collide with supposed senator's wife Laura Hutchinson. Phillip is killed; Jamie survives with only a small cut; Chloe suffers leg damage, a broken pelvis and a shattered hip; and Allyson has severe head trauma. 
Both girls are rushed to the hospital, while Trygve and Page arrive before the surgeries. Page is unable to reach Brad until after the surgery has begun, and Brad is outraged that she did not consult him beforehand. She informs him that Allyson would have died at six'o'clock if the surgery had not been performed. One hour later, Brad arrives at the hospital and leaves for their house without Page. Later, Page confronts him as to why he is home early from his "trip" and he confesses that he has been cheating on her. Soon afterwards Brad disappears several times. Eventually Page's mother, Maribelle, and sister Alexis arrive in San Francisco and laze about the house while Allison remains in the hospital.
One night after dinner, Page rages at her mother, demanding why she pretends that she did not know that her father molested her and her sister when they were children. Soon she forces Brad to move out and sends her mother and sister back to New York. By then she and Trygve had confessed their feelings toward each other. For four months, Allyson remains in a coma and Andrew, who has attempted to run away, is taken to see his sister. Soon Trygve and his children Nick, Bjorn and Chloe go to a lake for the weekend, and Allyson awakens from her coma. When Page goes to join them at the lake, she confesses to Trygve that she is pregnant with his child, and they begin to plan their wedding.

Auguste Bravard

(Pierre Joseph) Auguste Bravard (18 June 1803 – 28 March 1861) was a French mining engineer turned palaeontologist. He hunted fossils in the Vaucluse, Allier and his native Puy de Dôme. 
Biography.
Bravard emigrated to Argentina in the winter of 1852-53 and was a long-term resident in Buenos Aires. He unearthed and studied mammalian fossils, some of which, like the skull of "Mesotherium", were sent back to the Muséum d'histoire naturelle, Paris. Pleistocene mammal fossils purchased from Bravard are also in the Museum of Natural History, South Kensington, London, transferred from the British Museum, which had purchased them from Bravard in 1854. Bravard, who became director of the natural history museum in Paraná, upheld geological theories contrary to those of Charles Darwin.
From Buenos Aires, he explored in Bahía Blanca, resulting in his "Mapa geológico y topográfico de los alrededores de Bahía Blanca, Buenos Aires" (1857). He also explored the Paraná basin and the pampas.
Periodically Bravard lithographed his letters and distributed them to geologists in Europe.
After his unexpected death in the Mendoza earthquake of 1861, his remarkable collection of fossils disappeared. At the turn of the twentieth century, an auction of unclaimed crates by the Buenos Aires customs office revealed the collection, which was handed over to the Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales, Buenos Aires.
At Issoire, he is commemorated in the rue August Bravard.

Agustín Goiburú

Agustín Goiburú was a politician from Paraguay. He was the leader of the movement MOPOCO (Popular Colorado Movement) that represented the strongest opposition to the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner. He was murdered during the Condor Operative in 1977. He was a doctor, specialized in orthopedic surgery in Brazil. When he returned to the country, he worked in the Social Prevention Institute and in the Police Policlinic “Rigoberto Caballero”.
Beginning of the dictatorship.
Besides his work in the field of medicine, he had a long militancy in the Colorado Party, political movement that supported the government of the general Alfredo Stroessner who had assumed as president in 1954. The constants denunciation of Human Rights violation Goiburú made against the government of Stroessner led him to be a part of the group of Colorado Leaders that in 1959 was forced to leave the country in exile. Goiburú took refuge in the Uruguayan embassy, along with the artist Teodoro S. Mongelós and other activists that together would conform in the exile, the dissident movement MOPOCO.
He first moved to Santa Ana, and later on, in the Argentine border city, Posadas. There, he continued working as a doctor. During the years he lived there, he denounced to the press that in the Paraná River, the river that divides Paraguay from Argentina, rotting corpses floated, with signs of torture on their bodies. They were the bodies of the members of the uprising movement called “14 de Mayo” that had been thrown of plains that flew over the border. The Interior Minister, Edgar L. Ynsfrán and the Chief of Police, Ramón Duarte Vera were accused of planning that massive repression.
The failed kidnapping.
In 1962, Goiburú tried to expose the Paraguayan situation to the international community by planning the kidnapping of the government plane TAM (Military Air Transportation) that landed in Encarnación, the Paraguayan city that was next to Posadas, divided by the Paraná River. His objective was to land the plane in Punta del Este, Uruguay, where it would took place the meeting of the Latin-Americans chancellors. However, the government became aware of Goiburú’s plans and decided to capture him in an operative that Goiburú managed to escape from almost miraculously.
On November 24, 1969, he was kidnapped for the first time. He was fishing in the Paraná River with his eleven – years old son Rolando, and a few construction workers, when he was interrupt by a military boat with naval Paraguayans officers. His boat was towed to the coast, along with his son Rolando who returned to Posadas. The construction workers remained in jail for over a year and Goiburú was immediately sent to Asunción on a military plane.
He remained missing for several months when, in fact, he was in an Army’s basement in the Capital. After his wife denounced his disappearance, he was moved to different police stations across the Capital. Finally, he remained in the police station nº7th where, on December 3, 1970, he managed to escape, once again, spectacularly, one year and nine days after he was captured. He took refuge in the Chilean embassy, with the protection of the socialist Chilean government of Popular Unity, and even traveled to Santiago de Chile, but shortly, he was once again in Posadas, right next to Paraguay.
The plan of assassination.
Convinced that the only way Stroessner would leave the government was through violence, in 1974, Goiburú gathered a group of activist of the MOPOCO and a few Paraguayans students from the University of La Plata to plan the assassination of the dictator. The plan was to load with explosives a van that would be parked in a street that was a part of the itinerary of Stroessner, near the railroad station. The operative failed several times because of various motives and finally was found out by the police thanks to a navy officer called Evasio Benítez that had been contacted by one of the involved to buy some explosives.
Public enemy.
Since the moment Stroessner learned that Goiburú had planned his assassination, he became the public enemy number one of the regime. He also became the symbol of the Paraguayan exile and was the only person capable to gather a great number of people to resist the government’s repression. He was always spied and since 1975, a secret cooperation agreement, in which the military governments of the region could exchange prisoners and information, called The Condor Operative begun to function.
Kidnapping.
When Goiburú realized that he was being followed and spied, he realized it was no longer safe to live in Posadas and decided to move to Paraná (Entre Ríos), a city that was many kilometers away of the Paraguayan border. Nevertheless, on February 9, 1977, an operative in which Paraguay and Argentina joined forces, managed to kidnap him. His body never was found in spite the efforts of his family. In the year 2006, the Interamerican Court of Justice condemned the State of Paraguay for the murder of Agustín Goiburú and its poor attempts to investigate the truth of his death.

The Geroch group is an infinite-dimensional symmetry group of axisymmetric, stationary vacuum spacetimes that are solutions of Einstein's equations of general relativity. It is generated by two non-commuting subgroups: the Matzner–Misner group (after Richard Alfred Matzner and Charles W. Misner) of linear combinations (with constant coefficients) of the two Killing vector fields associated with the spacetime's axisymmetry and stationarity, and the Ehlers group.

Bomber's Moon

"Bomber's Moon" is a 1943 American wartime propaganda film, produced by 20th Century Fox, based on an unpublished magazine serial "Bomber's Moon" by Leonard Lee.
Plot.
Captain Jeff Dakin (George Montgomery) is shot down over Germany on a bombing raid as he sees his brother, Danny (Richard Graham) serving on the same aircraft, shot dead as he parachutes out of the stricken aircraft. Imprisoned in a camp, Dakin conspires with Alexandra "Alec" Zorich (Annabella), a beautiful Russian doctor, and a Czech resistance leader, Captain Paul Husnik (Kent Taylor) to mount an escape. They escape during an air raid and make their way towards safety, but the Czech is not who he seems.
Husnik is really Gestapo officer Paul van Brock who wants to get Alec to lead him to the leaders of the Czech underground movement. Killing the underground leader, van Brock summons the Gestapo but Dakin overpowers him and together with Alec, is on the run. Reaching Holland, Dakin learns that his bomber is now repaired with the Nazis planning a mysterious flight to England. Disguised as a German soldier, Dakin finds out his brother's killer, Maj. Von Streicher (Martin Kosleck), is to pilot the aircraft, on a mission to kill Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Stealing a German aircraft, Dakin exacts some revenge by shooting down Von Streicher. Landing in England, he is reunited with Alec who has made her way there.
Production.
Although a low-budget production, entirely filmed at the 20th Century Fox studio lot, a total of six directors worked on the film. Shortly after completing "Bomber's Moon", George Montgomery enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Corps and did not appear in another film until the 1946 20th Century Fox production "Three Little Girls in Blue". French actress Annabella also filmed "Tonight We Raid Calais" (1943) and "13 Rue Madeleine" (1947).
Reception.
Strictly a "B" film, "Bomber's Moon" was not well received. The contemporary review in "The New York Times" succinctly summed it up as "shoddy" and "... second-rate Hollywood."

Bible translations into Catalan

The first complete Catalan Bible translation was produced by the Catholic Church, between 1287 and 1290. It was entrusted to Jaume de Montjuich by Alfonso II of Aragon. Remains of this version can be found in Paris ("Bibliothèque Nationale"). Also, in the same French library, we can find another translation into Catalan, which Jaume II of Aragon received on November 23, 1319.
In the early fifteenth century appeared another whole Bible translation by Bonifaci Ferrer. In 1490 a psalter by Joan Roís de Corella came to light in Venice. The Valencian Bible by Bonifaci Ferrer was printed in 1478 before any Bible was printed in English or Spanish.
In 1832 a Catalan exiled in London, Josep Melcior Prat i Colom, sponsored by the British and Foreign Bible Society, translated the New Testament ("Lo Nou Testament de nostre Senyor Jesu-Christ"), which was published afterwards in Barcelona (1836) and Madrid (1888).

Cliff Pritchard

Cliff Pritchard (1881–1954) was a Welsh international centre who played club rugby for Newport RFC and Pontypool RFC. Pritchard was capped on five occasions and scored two tries for his country. He is best known as one of the Welsh squad that beat the 1905 touring All Blacks.
International career.
Pritchard was first capped for his country in a winning game against Scotland in 1904; he was paired with seasoned international Rhys Gabe as a replacement for Gwyn Nicholls. His debut was reported in the "South Wales Evening Post" as "Once Pritchard got over early nervousness, he settled down to tackle well"
Pritchard was not the first choice for the game against New Zealand in 1905, as Pritchard was a forward player and the role he was required to fill in at the edge of the scrum, for this particular game, required speed and vision. He was known by the Welsh as the 'extra back' as his role required him to play up close to the scrum in defence, but also as an additional prong of attack. On the day of the match against the All Blacks, Pritchard proved he had taken his role seriously and executed his position as a roving player to neautralise the New Zelender loose head during scrum play with great skill. Pritchard was also part of the game's only try when he managed to collect a low pass from Dicky Owen, he drew the New Zealand centre Bob Deans and passed to Gabe, who in turn passed to the try scorer Teddy Morgan.

2001 Kunlun earthquake

The 2001 Kunlun earthquake also known as the 2001 Kokoxili earthquake, occurred on 14 November 2001 at 09:26 UTC (17:26 local time), with an epicenter near Kokoxili, close to the border between Qinghai and Xinjiang in a remote mountainous region. With a magnitude of 7.8 Mw it was the most powerful earthquake in China for 5 decades. No casualties were reported, presumably due to the very low population density and the lack of high-rise buildings. This earthquake was associated with the longest surface rupture ever recorded on land, ~450 km.
Earthquake damage.
Due to the remoteness of the region, most reports of damage came from areas hundreds of kilometers from the epicenter. The nearest population centre, the city of Golmud, reported severe shaking but no buildings collapsed. Some damage was reported at the construction site for the Qingzang railway(Qinghai-Tibet railway) and along the Qinghai-Tibet highway.
Tectonic setting.
The Kunlun fault is one of the major sinistral strike-slip structures that accommodate the eastward motion of the Tibetan plateau relative to the Eurasian plate. This motion is caused by the lateral spreading of the zone of thickened crust associated with the collision between the Indian and Eurasian plates.
Earthquake characteristics.
The earthquake rupture began on a relatively small strike-slip fault segment at the western end of the Kunlun fault in the region of the mountain Buka Daban Feng. The rupture propagated to the east via an extensional stepover before following the main strand of the Kunlun fault. The region of co-seismic deformation (i.e. that occurred during the earthquake) is unusually large, with significant faulting being observed up to 60 km from the main rupture trace. This deformation occurs in two swathes, ca. 20 and 60 km from the main fault trace. Pre-existing lineaments and geomorphological features suggest that this earthquake-triggered displacement occurred on existing faults.
An analysis of the propagation speed indicates that the rupture propagated at a normal velocity along the original segment, but increased in velocity to above the S-wave velocity after the jump across the extensional stepover and continued at that speed until propagation stopped. This makes the Kunlun earthquake the best documented example of a supershear earthquake. It has been suggested that the unusually wide zone of co-seismic deformation is a direct result of the supershear rupture propagation.

<doc id="18400490" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18400490" title="Indian tea culture">
Indian tea culture

India produces and consumes more tea than any other country in the world, except for China, including the famous Assam tea and Darjeeling tea. According to the Planning Commission Deputy Chairman, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, there are plans to officially recognise tea as the “National Drink” in 2013. 
According to the ASSOCHAM report released in December, 2011, India, as the world’s largest consumer of tea uses nearly 30 per cent of the global output. India is also the second largest producer of tea. Despite the production, India is also the largest exporter of tea after China.
The cultivation and brewing of tea in India has a long history of applications in traditional systems of medicine and for consumption. The practice of Ayurveda has resulted in a long standing tradition of tisanes, (an infusion - as of dried herbs – used as a beverage or for medicinal effects). Traditional Indian kitchens have long utilised the medicinal benefits offered by various plants and spices such as basil (Tulsi), cardamom (Elaichi), pepper (Kali Mirch), liquorice (Mulethi), mint (Pudina), etc., and traditionally, tisanes made with these plant leaves and/or spices have been in use for centuries for maladies ranging from the serious to the trifling. Tea also serves as a delivery vehicle for these traditional tisanes. The taste of chai (sweet and milky) helps disguise the stronger and more bitter flavours of some of the medicinal additives, while other, more pleasant flavours such as cardamom and ginger add a pleasing flavour and aroma to the tea along with health benefits.
The consumption of tea in India was first clearly documented in the Ramayana (750-500 BC). For the next thousand years, documentation of tea in India was lost in history. Records re-emerge during the first century AD, with stories of the Buddhist monks Bodhidharma and Gan Lu, and their involvement with tea. Research shows that tea is indigenous to eastern and northern India, and was cultivated and consumed there for thousands of years. Commercial production of tea in India did not begin until the arrival of the British East India Company, at which point large tracts of land were converted for mass tea production.
Today, India is one of the largest tea producers in the world, with over 70% of the tea being consumed within India itself. A number of renowned teas, such as Darjeeling, also grow exclusively in India. The Indian tea industry has grown to own many global tea brands, and has evolved to one of the most technologically equipped tea industries in the world. Tea production, certification, exportation, and all other facets of the tea trade in India is controlled by the Tea Board of India.
Ancient India.
Tea cultivation in India has somewhat ambiguous origins. Though the extent of the popularity of tea in Ancient India is unknown, it is known that the tea plant was a wild plant in India that was indeed brewed by local inhabitants of different regions. But there is no substantial documentation of the history of tea drinking in the Indian subcontinent for the pre-colonial period. One can only speculate that tea leaves were widely used in Ancient India since the plant is native to some parts of India. The Singpho tribe and the Khamti tribe, inhabitants of the regions where the Camellia Sinensis plant grew native, have been consuming tea since the 12th century. It is also possible that tea may have been used under another name. Frederick R. Dannaway, in the essay “Tea As Soma”, argues that tea was perhaps better known as “Soma” in Indian mythology. The tea plant is native to East and South Asia but the origins and history of tea are not precise. Many of the origin myths for tea are found in Chinese mythology, and the first verifiable records for tea consumption also point towards China. For details see History of Tea in China.
Dutch exploration.
The next recorded reference to tea in India after the 12th century dates to 1598, when a Dutch traveler, Jan Huyghen van Linschoten, noted in a book that the leaves of the Assam tea plant were used by Indians as a vegetable, eaten with garlic and oil, and as a drink.
The same year, another reference to tea in India was recorded, by a different group of Dutch explorers.
Early British surveys.
In an 1877 pamphlet written by Samuel Baildon, and published by W. Newman and Co. of Calcutta, Baildon wrote, "...various merchants in Calcutta were discussing the chance of imported China seeds thriving in Assam, when a native from the province present, seeing some tea said, 'We have the plant growing wild in our jungles.'" It is then documented that the Assamese nobleman, Maniram Dutta Barua, (also known as Maniram Dewan) showed British surveyors existing fields used for tea cultivation and wild tea plants growing in the Assamese jungle.
East India Company.
In the early 1820s, the British East India Company began large-scale production of tea in Assam, India, of a tea variety traditionally brewed by the Singpho tribe. In 1826, the British East India Company took over the region from the Ahom kings through the Yandaboo Treaty. In 1837, the first English tea garden was established at Chabua in Upper Assam; in 1840, the Assam Tea Company began the commercial production of tea in the region, run by indentured servitude of the local inhabitants. Beginning in the 1850s, the tea industry rapidly expanded, consuming vast tracts of land for tea plantations. By the start of the 20th century, Assam became the leading tea producing region in the world.
But despite the discovery of the indigenous Camellia Sinensis plant, the tea industry in India began with 42,000 seedlings germinated from a consignment of 80,000 seeds procured from China – 2000 were planted in the hill districts of South India, and 20,000 each in the hill districts in Kumaon in North India and Upper Assam on the north east frontier. It was only later that the indigenous plants were used.
Today, the Chinese strain produces Darjeeling tea and the indigenous Assamese variety produces the remainder of the tea produced in India. 
Writing in "The Cambridge World History of Food" , Weisburger & Comer write:
The tea cultivation begun there in the nineteenth century by the British, however, has accelerated to the point that today India is listed as the world's leading producer, its 715, 000 tons well ahead of China's 540, 000 tons, and of course, the teas of Assam, Ceylon (from the island nation known as Sri Lanka), and Darjeeling are world famous. However, because Indians average half a cup daily on per capita basis, fully 70 percent of India's immense crop is consumed locally.
Modern tea production in India.
India was the top producer of tea for nearly a century, but recently China has overtaken India as the top tea producer due to increased land availability. Indian tea companies have acquired a number of iconic foreign tea enterprises including British brands Tetley and Typhoo. India is also the world's largest tea-drinking nation. However, the per capita consumption of tea in India remains a modest 750 grams per person every year due to the large population base and high poverty levels. From Rs 19,500 crore in 2011, the total turnover of the Indian tea industry is expected to be Rs 33,000 crore by 2015 according to the ASSOCHAM report of 2011. The same report pegs 90 per cent of all Indian households as regular tea drinkers. The reasons stated are “tea is cheap, affordable, and addictive.” And yet, the annual per capita tea consumption in India was only 0.52 kg per person in 2009.
"The Cambridge World History of Food" , writes:
In general, even though India leads the world in tea technology, the methods employed to harvest the crop vary with the type of tea and terrain. Fine-leaf tea is hand plucked, and hand shears are used on mountain slopes and in other areas where tractor-mounted machines cannot go. A skilled worker using hand shears can harvest between 60 to 100 kg of tea per day, whereas machines cut between 1,000 and 2, 000 kg. The latter, however, are usually applied to low grade teas that often go into teabags. The tea "fluff" and waste from processing is used to produce caffeine for soft drinks and medicine.
Consumption of tea in India.
Tea is made both at home and outside. Outside the home, tea is most commonly and easily found at the ubiquitous tea stalls that dot just about every street in India. The tea stall has become a part of the urban landscape and a cultural institution, even celebrated as in the recent art exhibition titled “Chai Wallah and other stories” by the artist Vijay Gille. “Chai Wallah” is the Hindi title accorded to the man who runs the tea stall. “Chai-Pani” literally meaning, tea and water, on the other hand have become the preferred phrase to refer to the petty corruption that is rampant in India.
According to the historian Ville Melgén, the taste for tea was developed in India through a dedicated punch in the face of the producers of tea once tea production in India gained momentum. Initially, free samples of tea were offered from horse-drawn carts belonging to various companies. As early as 1907, Brooke Bond, an English tea company started experimenting with a fleet of horse-drawn vans for distributing teas. The British tradition of taking tea with a little milk and sugar was introduced along with the samples. 
Unlike the British cup of tea, tea in India is not served in a set where the leaves are steeped separately. Typically, tea in India is consumed with both milk and sugar but the tea leaves are not prepared separately by being steeped. Instead, the tea leaves are boiled along with additions and then boiled again after the addition of milk and sugar. Sometimes the tea leaves themselves are used as flavouring. In many parts of the country, the most special tea is one where the tea leaves are boiled solely in milk. 
There are many other popular variations depending on regional and cultural affiliations. By and large, tea drinkers in India drink milk tea. There are many other popular variations depending on regional and cultural affiliations. The now well known Masala Chai, Kadak Chai (typically a feature of the mountain community of North India, this is a very strongly brewed tea, almost to the point of bitterness), Malai Mar Ke Chai (where a generous dollop of full fat cream is spooned into the cup of tea) are some of the more popular variations.

Sarah Powell

Sarah Gerau Powell (1922–1941) was an influential French poet of Jewish origin. Famous in large part for the impact she had on the early writing career of philosopher and novelist Simone de Beauvoir, Powell was killed in the Dachau concentration camp in 1941 following the Fall of France. Her life is best chronicled in English language texts today by J.J. Douglas.
Notable works.
Sarah Powell's best known work was "The Dwarf Boy Chronicles", which upon publication in early 1939 provoked much interest in Paris. The focus of interest in this poetry collection was held in the intellectual elite Left Bank area of Paris. Powell was a frequent visitor to such literary salons as Les Deux Magots and Le Flore, both of which lie on the Boulevard St. Germain and were regular haunts for Beauvoir and Sartre. 
Powell was acknowledged by the École Normale Supérieure (where she studied literature and philosophy) for her epic poem 'Rebecca the Clown', which was likely influenced by her college supervisor Rebecca Forde, with whom she later fell out. Beauvoir was also teaching in the Saint Germain-des-Pres district at this time. 
Marriage and Death.
Powell met Lawrence Powell in January 1940, upon having visited London to promote her poetry collection. Lawrence Powell translated her work into English and she lived with him in his Kensington home in West London for several months before their marriage in April 1940. He was exempt from war duties as he was classified mentally unstable for combat, leading to them both moving back to Paris by May 1940. The timing was to prove fatal, with the German troops invading France and the Low Countries only weeks later. In the mass exodus from Paris, Sarah was captured by German troops when heading south towards the safe haven of Bordeaux. Lawrence was captured also, but his non-Jewish features were to ultimately save him. In the obituary he would later write for his wife, he stated that: ""A love that obeyed no boundaries was what brought us together, but simply a Jewish face was what tore us apart."" 
Sarah Powell was executed in the Dachau concentration camp in 1941 (the exact date is unknown). Her name can be found today on the wall of Holocaust victims in the Jewish Museum of Paris, Le Marais district. Another name to be found alongside hers is that of Natalie Costanza, her friend and collaborator, who accompanied Sarah on the exodus from Paris. Costanza's Jewish background also worked against her. Lawrence Powell would later pen a poem, "I don't get it", about the women's deaths.

Save Bernd

Save Bernd is a humor website. The premise of the site is that the website's webmaster Chris Krohm, will eat Bernd, a pet rabbit, unless he receives €1,000,000 in donations to care for it.
Save Bernd!
The website was created in July 2004 in German language as "Rettet Bernd!" and the first link to it was posted on the supporters' messageboard of a German soccer club. An English version of this website was then released in early August 2004. 
The website claimed that the owner found Bernd underneath a banana box next to a bottle bank. The webmaster also stated that, unless he received €1,000,000 in Euros to pay for its care, he would eat the rabbit. The money could be either donated directly, or through purchasing "Save Bernd" merchandise. 
The webmaster never attempted to remain anonymous. The main URL on the webmaster's website stated a mobile phone number as well as details of the webmaster's bank account with Lloyds TSB, UK.
Krohm also stated that 80% of the donations will be given to charity.
The website had its own merchandise webshop and a sponsoring link to earn € 3,500 monthly through a sperm bank.
The original deadline for receiving the money was December 31, 2004. When the deadline passed, it was extended to March 27, 2005, claiming that it was due to the extensive pressure from the public. Krohm claims that the final balance on donations and merchandise was € 71,466. A donation list was published by Krohm, too.
Public response & legitimacy.
The website received media attention especially throughout Europe as well as in Australia i.e. Bernd also featured on Mondo Thingo. 
The Austrian Press Agency was first by publishing reports about "Rettet Bernd!" on July 28, 2004 and several radio stations and newspapers reported about it. The German TV channel RTL Television broadcast an interview with Krohm in August 2008.
The webmaster decided to release an English version of the webpage as he received several requests from English speaking internet users. 
The Irish radio station FM 104 aired a telephone interview with Krohm on August 30, 2008 in its The Strawberry Alarm Clock and the number of the website's hits rose quickly to around 2 million page loads by November 2004.
The website caused an upset with many animal rights activists but the webmaster stated that Bernd would be given to a professional butcher in order to avoid any problems with animal welfare organizations. RSPCA however did contact Lloyds TSB in order to determine if it could refuse payments but Lloyds declined to comment due to the customer's confidentiality.
The public prosecutor's office of Vienna confirmed that Krohm's planned action was within the law. 
There were attempts by a group to do a protest march just before the end of the original deadline in December 2004 as well as threats of a German, militant group. 
There has also been questions about whether or not the site was legitimate. Krohm, when asked in radio interviews, claimed that the site was completely serious and he would eat the rabbit and that he actually did receive a number of recipes. The site today claims that "Bernd is gone", but not that he was eaten. Small letters at the bottom of the page make it clear that "It's a joke", although there is no such message in the German version.
The idea of "Save Bernd!" was copied a number of times by other webmasters in winter 2008 and spring 2009 sometimes even showing the picture of Bernd.

Poseur

Poseur (or poser) is a pejorative term, often used in the punk, heavy metal, hip hop, and goth subcultures, or the skateboarding and surfing communities, to describe a person who copies the dress, speech, and/or mannerisms of a group or subculture, generally for attaining acceptability within the group or for popularity among various other groups, yet who is deemed not to share or understand the values or philosophy of the subculture.
While this perceived inauthenticity is viewed with scorn and contempt by members of the subculture, the definition of the term and to whom it should be applied is subjective. While the term is most associated with the 1970s- and 1980s-era punk and hardcore subculture, English use of the term originates in the late 19th century.
Etymology and definitions.
The English term poseur is a loanword from French, in which it is used figuratively since the mid-19th century with the same meaning as in English to refer to people who "affect an attitude or pose". "Etymonline", an online etymology dictionary, argues that since the "word is Eng.poser in Fr.[French garb", the term itself could thus "be considered an affectation".
Dictionary.com says the word refers to "a person who habitually pretends to be something he is not". The "Merriam-Webster" dictionary notes that the term was also used to refer to a "person who pretends to be what he or she is not" or an "insincere person". The "Encarta" dictionary states that the term is used to describe a "pretentious person" or "somebody who tries to impress others by behaving in an affected way". "The Cambridge Dictionary" defines a "poseur" as "someone who pretends to be something they are not, or to have qualities that they do not have".
Use within contemporary subcultures.
Punk subculture.
Music journalist Dave Rimmer wrote that the first punks in London used "terms in which they expressed their disdain for hangers-on and those whose post-hip credentials didn’t quite make it came straight out of the authenticity movements: 'Poseurs' was the favorite epithet." Ross Buncle argues that eventually the Australian punk scene "opened the door to a host of poseurs, who were less interested in the music than in UK-punk fancy dress and being seen to be hip". He praises the gigs where there "were no punk-identikit poseurs" in the audience.
In a review of The Clash film "Rude Boy", a critic argued that this "film was another sign of how The Clash had sold out – a messy, vain work of punk poseurs". US music journalist Lester Bangs praised punk pioneer Richard Hell for writing the "strongest, truest rock & roll I have heard in ages" without being an "arty poseur" of the "age of artifice". Another critic argues that by the late 1970s, "punk rock had already, at this early date, shown signs of devolving into pure pose, black leather jacket and short hair required". "Please Kill Me" includes interviews with punks in New York and Detroit who "rip their English counterparts as a bunch of sissified poseurs".
The term "poseur" was used in several late-1970s punk songs, including the X-Ray Spex song "I Am a Poseur", which included the lyrics "I am a poseur and I don't care/I like to make people stare/Exhibition is the name."
Another song using the term was the Television Personalities song "Part-Time Punks". The Television Personalities' song "was a reaction to the macho posturing of the English punk scene". The lyrics argue that, "while Television Personalities were not themselves punks in the orthodox sense, neither was anyone else". The song "declared that either everyone who wanted to be a punk was one or that everyone was a poseur (or both)", and it argues that "the concept of [...] punk rock authenticity, of Joe Strummer, was a fiction".
An article in "Drowned in Sound" argues that 1980s-era "hardcore is the true spirit of punk" because "all the poseurs and fashionistas fucked off to the next trend of skinny pink ties with New Romantic haircuts, singing wimpy lyrics". It argued that the hardcore scene consisted only of people "completely dedicated to the DIY ethics"; punk "[lifers without the ambition to one day settle into the study-work-family-house-retirement-death scenario".
The Oi band Combat 84 has a song entitled "Poseur" which describes a person changing from a punk to a skinhead, and then into a Mod and a Ted. The lyrics include the lines "Poseur poseur standing there/
You change your style every year."
1990s–2000s.
Dave Rimmer writes that with the revival of punk ideals of stripped-down music in the early 1990s, with "Cobain, and lots of kids like him, rock & roll ... threw down a dare: Can you be pure enough, day after day, year after year, to prove your authenticity, to live up to the music live with being a poseur, a phony, a sellout?"
Refused's Dennis Lyxzén and Bad Religion's Brett Gurewitz used the term to refer to early 2000s-era pop punk fans as "kids – more specifically the new wave of punk poseurs who came to the music via bands like Good Charlotte". They argue that these young listeners want "not to have to think and they would rather use music as escapism [,] and too many bands seem willing to comply".
One writer argued that the Los Angeles punk scene was changed by the invasion of "antagonistic suburban poseurs", which bred "rising violence [...] and led to a general breakdown of the hardcore scene". A writer for "The Gauntlet" praised the US Bombs' politically oriented albums as "a boulder of truth and authenticity in a sea of slick poseur sewage", and called them "real punk rockers" at "a time where the genre is littered with dumb songs about cars, girls and bong hits".
Daniel S. Traber argues that attaining authenticity in the punk identity can be difficult; as the punk scene changed and re-invented itself, "got called a poseur". One music writer argues that the punk scene produced "...true believers who spent long days fighting the man on streets of the big city [and living in squats who always wanted to make punk rock less a cultural movement than some kind of meritocracy: "You have to prove you're good enough to listen to our music, man."
Joe Keithley, the singer for D.O.A. said in an interview that: "For every person sporting an anarchy symbol without understanding it there’s an older punk who thinks they’re a poseur." The interviewer, Liisa Ladouceur, argued that when a group or scene's "followers grow in number, the original devotees abandon it, [...] because it is now attracting too many poseurs—people the core group does not want to be associated with".
The early 1980s hardcore punk band MDC penned a song entitled "Poseur Punk", which excoriated pretenders who copied the punk look without adopting its values. As part of MDC's 25th anniversary tour in the 2000s, frontman "Dictor's targets remain largely the same: warmongering politicians, money-grubbing punk poseurs (including Rancid, whose Tim Armstrong once worked as an M.D.C. roadie), and of course, cops". NOFX's album "The War on Errorism" includes the song "Decom-poseur", part of the album's overall "critique of punk rock's 21st century incarnation of itself". In an interview, NOFX's lead singer Mike Burkett (aka "Fat Mike") "lashes out" at "an entire population of bands he deems guilty of bastardizing a once socially feared and critically infallible genre" of punk, asking "hen did punk rock become so safe?"
Heavy metal subculture.
Jeffrey Arnett argues that the heavy metal subculture classifies members two categories: "acceptance as an authentic metalhead or rejection as a fake, a poseur". In a 1993 profile of heavy metal fans' "subculture of alienation", the author notes that the scene classified some members as poseurs, that is, heavy metal performers or fans who pretended to be part of the subculture but who were deemed to lack authenticity and sincerity.
In the heavy metal subculture, some critics use the term to describe bands that are seen as excessively commercial, such as MTV-friendly glam metal groups in which hair, make-up, and fancy outfits are more important than the music. Another metal subgenre, nu metal is seen as controversial amongst fans of other metal genres, and the genres detractors have labeled nu metal derogatory terms such as "mallcore", "whinecore", "grunge for the zeros" and "sports-rock". 
Gregory Heaney of Allmusic has described the genre as "one of metal's more unfortunate pushes into the mainstream." Jonathan Davis, the frontman of the pioneering nu metal band Korn, was in an interview and said 
Ron Quintana wrote that when Metallica was trying to find a place in the LA metal scene in the early 1980s, it was difficult for the band to "play their music and win over a crowd in a land where poseurs ruled and anything fast and heavy was ignored".
David Rocher described Damian Montgomery, frontman of Ritual Carnage, as "an authentic, no-frills, poseur-bashing, nun-devouring kind of gentleman, an enthusiastic metalhead truly in love with the lifestyle he preaches... and unquestionably practises". In 2002, Josh Wood argued that the "credibility of heavy metal" in North America is being destroyed by the genre's demotion to "horror movie soundtracks, wrestling events and, worst of all, the so-called 'Mall Core' groups like Slipknot and Korn", which makes the "true devotee’s path to metaldom [... perilous and fraught with poseurs."
In an article on Axl Rose, entitled "Ex–‘White-Boy Poseur'", Rose admitted that he has had "time to reflect on heavy-metal posturing" of the last few decades: "We thought we were so badass [...] Then N.W.A came out rapping about this world where you walk out of your house and you get shot. It was just so clear what stupid little white-boy poseurs we were."
The entire genre of Black Metal was founded on the anti-poseur stance, with some band members so eager to assert they were not poseurs (usually spelled 'posers' within that genre) that they participated in church burnings in the 1990s . The first wave of black metal emerged in Europe in the early and mid-1980s, led by Britain's Venom, Denmark's Mercyful Fate, Switzerland's Hellhammer and Celtic Frost, and Sweden's Bathory. Some bands in the Scandinavian black metal scene became associated with considerable violence in the early 1990s, with Norwegian bands Mayhem, Emperor, Hades Almighty and Burzum all linked to church burnings.
Goth subculture.
Nancy Kilpatrick's "Goth Bible: A Compendium for the Darkly Inclined" defines "poseur" for the goth scene as follows:"goth wannabes, usually young kids going through a goth phase who do not hold to goth sensibilities but want to be part of the goth crowd...". Kilpatrick dismisses poseur goths as "Batbabies" whose clothing is bought at store Hot Topic with their parents' money. The goth website Goth.net has a section on poseurs which states that "No matter who you are, you're going to be a poseur at some point. No one is born knowing all the intimate details of any subculture and until you finally bring your posing ass into the fold, you're never going to learn. Just make sure that if you really are interested, you do your research and you ask questions. That's where the poseurs get sorted from the chaff." 
A Goth music reviewer made a reference to the "teen poseur-Goth crowd that enjoys the tiny genre known as symphonic metal." In the goth subculture, the pejorative term "mall Goth" is sometimes used to describe poseurs.
Hip hop subculture.
In the hip hop scene, authenticity or "street cred" is important. Larry Nager of "The Cincinnati Enquirer" wrote that rapper 50 Cent has "earned the right to use the trappings of gangsta rap – the macho posturing, the guns, the drugs, the big cars and magnums of champagne. He's not a poseur pretending to be a gangsta; he's the real thing."
A "This Are Music" review of white rapper Rob Aston criticizes his "fake-gangsta posturing", calling him "a poseur faux-thug cross-bred with a junk punk" who glorifies "guns, bling, cars, bitches, and heroin" to the point that he seems like a parody. A 2004 article on BlackAmericaWeb claims that Russell Tyrone Jones, better known as rapper Ol' Dirty Bastard, was not "a rough dude from the ’hood" as his official record company biographies claimed. After Jones's death from drugs, the rapper's father claimed that "his late son was a hip-hop poseur, contrary to what music trade magazines published in New York" wrote. Jones' father argued that the "story about him being raised in the Fort Greene projects on welfare until he was a child of 13 was a total lie”; instead, he said "their son grew up in a reasonably stable two-parent, two-income home in Brooklyn".
The article also refers to another "hip-hop poseur from a decade ago", Lichelle “Boss” Laws. While her record company promoted her as "the most gangsta of girl gangstas", posing her "with automatic weapons" and publicizing claims about prison time and an upbringing on the "hard-knock streets of Detroit", Laws' parents claim that they put her "through private school and enrolled in college in suburban Detroit".
As hip hop has gained a more mainstream popularity, it has spread to new audiences, including well-to-do "white hip-hop kids with gangsta aspirations—dubbed the 'Prep-School Gangsters'" by journalist Nancy Jo Sales. Sales claims that these hip hop fans "wore "Polo and Hilfiger gear trendy among East Coast hip-hop acts" and rode downtown to black neighborhoods in chauffeured limos to experience the ghetto life. Then, "to guard against being labeled poseurs, the prep schoolers started to steal the gear that their parents could readily afford". This trend was highlighted in The Offspring song "Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)".
A 2008," Utne Reader" article describes the rise of "Hipster Rap", which "consists of the most recent crop of MCs and DJs who flout conventional hip-hop fashions, eschewing baggy clothes and gold chains for tight jeans, big sunglasses, the occasional keffiyeh, and other trappings of the hipster lifestyle". The article says this "hipster rap" has been criticized by the hip hop website Unkut and rapper Mazzi, who call the mainstream rappers "poseurs" or "fags for copping the metrosexual appearances of hipster fashion". "Prefix Mag" writer Ethan Stanislawski argues that there "have been a slew of angry retorts to the rise of hipster rap", which he says can be summed up as "white kids want the funky otherness of hip-hop [...] without all the scary black people".
Other music cultures.
Authenticity is also deemed to be important in the House, UK Garage, and grunge styles of music.
Other genres and subcultures.
Mark Paytress writes that in 1977, Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger called singer/songwriter Patti Smith a "poseur of the worst kind, intellectual bullshit, trying to be a street girl". A music writer for "The Telegraph" called Bob Dylan an "actor and a rock 'n' roll poseur to rival David Bowie and Mick Jagger at their most flamboyant".
The skateboarding subculture attempts to differentiate between authentic skaters and pretenders. A "New York Times" article on the 2007 skateboarding scene notes that "some first-time skaters drawn into the sport by catchy choruses or candy-colored sneakers are dismissed as poseurs" who are "walking around with a skateboard as an accessory, holding it in a way we call ‘the mall grab['.]" In the 1988 video game "Skate or Die!", "Poseur Pete" is humorously the name of the challenger for beginner-level players.
A "LA City Beat" magazine writer argues that "dance music had its "Spinal Tap" moment some time around the year 2000", arguing that "the prospect of fame, groupies, and easy money by playing other people's records on two turntables brought out the worst poseurs since hair metal ruled the Sunset Strip. Every dork with spiky locks and a mommy-bought record bag was a self-proclaimed turntable terror." A "Slate" magazine article argues that while the independent music scene "can embrace some fascinating hermetic weirdos such as Joanna Newsom or Panda Bear, it's also prone to producing fine-arts-grad poseurs such as The Decemberists and poor-little-rich-boy-or-girl singer songwriters".
The term "drugstore cowboy" denotes people who dress up like cowboys or cowgirls but who are not involved in associated cowboy activities such as herding cattle, putting horseshoes on horses, fixing fences and working on ranches.
Shortly before midnight July 8, 1994 at the Franklin Street Bar & Grill in Monterey, California, computer pioneer Gary Kildall suffered a blunt force head trauma which led to his death a few days later. In one version, he was attacked by one or more rough looking bikers. Because wearing his Harley-Davidson vest and likely under the heavy influence of alcohol, he looked and perhaps acted too much like an Outlaw motorcycle club poseur of Hells Angels while attending the biker bar, irritating the initiated. Kildall had no memory of the event afterwards.
One surfing commentator decries the presence of poseur surfers, who he describes as younger men who stick to longboarding because out of "laziness, ignorance, or fear of trying something they’re not good at, they stick to their longboards." The commentator states that "...these lazy pieces of shit are content with just “gliding” because it’s the easy way out... It’s the pussy way out. It’s weak. It’s pathetic. It tells me that this person lacks ambition, lacks a broader perspective, because instead of striving to make progress in a sport that this person supposedly loves, they’re content with a lower level of achievement."

Banana (band)

Banana (Serbian Cyrillic: Банана) were a former Yugoslav pop rock band.
Band history.
Banana was formed in 1985 in Belgrade. They released their debut album "Ponoćni pasaži" ("Midnight Sections") in 1986 in the following lineup: Aleksandra Toković (daughter of the famous composer Dragan Toković, vocals), Dragan Lončar (guitar), Boban Šaranović (bass guitar), Srđan Cincar (keyboards) and Igor Borojević (drums). The album was pop rock-oriented and featured the guitarist Duda Bezuha, Bajaga i Instruktori keyboardist Saša Lokner and former Zamba vocalist and bass guitarist Bogdan Dragović as guest musicians. In the summer of 1987, the band performed in Czechoslovakia, and at the beginning of 1988, they released their second album "Banana"‚ produced by keyboardist Đorđe Petrović. Aleksandra Toković wrote seven songs which marked the band's shift towards power pop. Soon after, Banana disbanded.

Naturhistorieselskabet

Naturhistorieselskabet - the Society for Natural History - was a private society that was the only institution to offer education in natural history in Denmark in the late 18th century. The spirit of the Age of Enlightenment and an escalating agricultural crisis, led the king and the Danish elite to call foreign experts on economy, including botany and silviculture, to the country. The autonomous University of Copenhagen, on the other hand, was reluctant to employ foreign experts in little-established disciplines. Naturhistorieselskabet was formed in 1788 in order to ensure education in botany, zoology and mineralogy based on private funds. For example, Martin Vahl lectured in botany. After the appointment in 1795 of a professor in geology and in 1797 one in botany, the society gradually lost its importance. It was soon abolished and its collections donated to the state (much later united with the university collections).

Chelating resin

Chelating resins also known as specific exchangers or chelating sorbents are a subgroup of ion exchange resins. 
Chelating resins were developed to obtain higher selectivities of at least one particular counter-ion species. The interaction of a functional group (ligand) of chelating resin and metal (in form of cation or oxoanion) is selective with respect to the nature of the metal. The theory behind the choice of functional group is explained as such: An ion that forms strong complexes with, or is precipitated by, a certain reagent should thus be preferred by a resin into which this reagent has been incorporated. 
However, in the case of chelating resins counter ions are bound to resin by coordinate covalent bond or by its combination with electrostatic interactions. While the case of ion exchange, electrostatic force between oppositely charged functional group and ion in solution plays the main role. 
Chelating resins have the same bead form and polymer matrix as usual ion exchangers. They are mainly based on crosslinked polystyrene. 
Typical functional groups of chelating resins are:

Sir Charles Abney-Hastings, 2nd Baronet

Sir Charles Abney Hastings, 2nd Baronet (1 October 1792 – 30 July 1858) of Willesley Hall, Derbyshire was both High Sheriff of Derbyshire and an MP for Leicester from 1826 to 1831.
Biography.
Abney-Hastings was the elder son of General Sir Charles Hastings, 1st Baronet, by the daughter and heir of Thomas Abney Esq. He was born in 1792, probably in Willesley and succeeded his father in 1823, assuming the additional name of Abney after his maternal grandfather. It was a condition of an Abney ancestor that whoever received the manors took up the surname Abney. Sir Charles was High Sheriff of Derbyshire in 1825 and was MP for Leicester from 1826 to 1831.
Charles' brother, Frank Abney Hastings, who might have inherited the title or fathered an heir, died a hero in 1828 at Zante. 
Hastings died on 30 July 1858, aged 66. By a deed of settlement executed about 1846 the Blackfordby and Packington estates of Sir Charles passed to Henry Rawdon-Hastings, 4th Marquess of Hastings. Willesley Hall and its estate were left to Lady Edith Maud Rawdon-Hastings, later Countess of Loudoun, the Marquess's eldest sister and wife of Charles Frederick Clifton Esq. 
Charles Frederick Clifton and his wife assumed by Act of Parliament in 1859 the surname and arms of Abney-Hastings. This was required by the conditions of Charles Abney Hastings' will. His will required that this name change should be done by "sanction of Queen, Lords and Commons namely by an Act of Parliament".

Adtranz C-100

The C-100 is an automated people mover rolling stock first developed by Westinghouse Transportation Systems (later AEG-Westinghouse, AEG Transportation, Adtranz, and now owned by Bombardier Transportation). It is the predecessor of the Bombardier CX-100, which is found at many airports today. The newer CX-100 is capable of using most of the existing infrastructure of the C-100, making an easy upgrade. Because of this, the C-100 is no longer produced by Bombardier Transportation.
The C-100 first made its debut in 1971 when Tampa International Airport first opened. The fleet initially consisted of eight vehicles, however, as the airport expanded, the fleet was later increased in size.
While the C-100 has been retired at most airports (being replaced by the CX-100) where they were used, many C-100 vehicles remain in service at Orlando International Airport. The Miami-Dade Metromover, an urban downtown people mover in Miami, Florida, still uses a fleet of 29 C-100s. The Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport Automated People Mover formerly used a large fleet of C-100 vehicles until they were retired in 2002 and replaced by brand new CX-100 vehicles.

William Mode Spackman (May 20, 1905-August 3, 1990) was an American writer. He was born in Coatesville, Pennsylvania, the son of George Harvey Spackman and Alice Pennock Mode. A graduate of the Friends School of Wilmington, Delaware and in 1927 Princeton University (B.A.; later also an M.A.), he was also a Rhodes Scholar at Balliol College, Oxford. In 1929, he married Mary Ann Matthews (1902–1978); they had three children: Peter (1930–1995), Ann (1932–1961), and Harriet (born 1934). Spackman was awarded a Rockefeller Fellowship to study public opinion at Columbia University. Spackman also taught classics briefly at New York University and worked in radio.
Spackman's literary success came relatively late in life. He wrote about romance from a realistic rather than a romantic perspective. Highly praised by critics like John Leonard, John Updike, and Stanley Elkin, he has been called a "Fabergé of novelists" and his works have been called "delicate comedies." The characters in his novels are school friends, their associations, often in New York City, and the women with whom they spent time. 
He was the author of:
He was also the author of a collection of essays entitled "On the Decay of Humanism."

Orofaciodigital syndrome 1

Orofaciodigital syndrome 1 (OFD1), also called Papillon-League and Psaume syndrome, is an X-linked congenital disorder characterized by malformations of the face, oral cavity, and digits with polycystic kidney disease and variable involvement of the central nervous system.
Cause and Genetics.
Orofaciodigital syndrome type 1 is caused by mutations in the OFD1 gene. OFD1 localizes to both centrosomes and basal bodies within the human genetic cellular structure. This suggests that this syndrome may fall into a broad category of ciliary diseases. The ciliary organelles are present in many cellular types throughout the human body. The cilia defects adversely affect numerous critical developmental signaling pathways essential to cellular development.
Other types include:
Relation to other rare genetic disorders.
Recent findings in genetic research have suggested that a large number of genetic disorders, both genetic syndromes and genetic diseases, that were not previously identified in the medical literature as related, may be, in fact, highly related in the genetypical root cause of the widely varying, phenotypically-observed disorders. Thus, orofaciodigital syndrome is a ciliopathy. Other known ciliopathies include primary ciliary dyskinesia, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, polycystic kidney disease and polycystic liver disease, nephronophthisis, Alstrom syndrome, Meckel-Gruber syndrome and some forms of retinal degeneration.

<doc id="18400732" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18400732" title="Authoritarian literature">
Authoritarian literature

Authoritarian literature is a term used by John Gardner to designate the body of literature written by persons living under an authoritarian governmental regime. Literary works produced in these regimes share common characteristics that make the designation useful. Authoritarian regimes revere their leaders, who historically were typically referred to as kings, along with advisors to the king. These leaders were considered innately better than ordinary people. The authoritarian leader, and his approved circle, if not directly writing about a subject themselves, were the only ones who could designate, approve, and sanction writers as acceptable authorities. Government authorities also financially supported writers under a patronage system. The writers in such a system therefore must necessarily be careful to ensure the composition of their work met (or would meet) the approval of authorities. Failure to comply risked official warnings, loss of governmental sanction, and sometimes even imprisonment or loss of life.
Fiction produced under authoritarian regimes tends to be didactic. Subject matter can vary in terms of plot, but the didactic point of the work is almost always to illustrate what authorities would consider the proper comportment of individuals within the authoritarian society. This didactic point is conveyed to readers in order to idealize the existing social structure and thus, hopefully, perpetuate it. Authoritarian fiction is considered to be demonstrative in purpose rather than explorative. The author's narrative voice is also usually authoritarian in order to impart something known by the author that is presumably not known by the reader. Since most people don't enjoy and resist being spoken to as an inferior, the more successful (or popular) authors of such literature are the ones who best disguise, or sugarcoat, their didactic purpose. One common way to achieve such indirectness is through the use of the form allegory.
Examples.
Good examples of authoritarian literature include "Beowulf", "Pilgrim's Progress", and in English literature we see vestiges as late as Charles Dickens. While didacticism forms a significant component of Shaw's, Orwell's and C. S. Lewis' fiction as well, their works can not strictly be considered as authoritarian literature because they were not writing at the whim of political leaders. Dickens was not writing for the British government either, but he used the same forms of his predecessors, who did write for the court, particularly in his earlier novels, such as "A Tale of Two Cities" and "David Copperfield", where we most easily observe a certain preachiness. Dickens constructed his plots for the sake of demonstration rather than the purpose of exploration. However, Charles Dickens is a transitional figure, and in his later novels, such as "Great Expectations", we can "feel the two impulses warring in the writer's mind".
Contemporary Works.
Authoritarian literature is, of course, not a purely historical phenomenon. It persists as the dominant form of everyday literature of Middle Eastern countries (Turkey, Israel, Lebanon, and arguably Palestine and Iran's literature excepted), and, until recently, Chinese literature. To understand the nature of authoritarian literature's purpose is to better understand the reason for the forms in which we see literature currently being produced in these countries. 
The antithesis to Authoritarian literature is Anti-Authoritarian literature. Practitioners of this genre in the aforementioned countries are routinely subjected to harsh sanctions, and many choose to go into exile in order to write freely. Still other writers suffer censorship and imprisonment at their government's hands (e.g. Sunallah Ibrahim and Abdul Rahman Munif). Authoritarian literature authors, however, who write works of fiction that support or praise governments, as expected, often see promotion to positions of authority within their respective country's governing cultural body.

Cartographer (album)

Cartographer, the second album from E.S. Posthumus, was supposed to release sometime in 2006 but was later released in early 2007. The delay from the original release date can only so far be attributed to the Vonlichten brothers' ill-concern with deadlines, although it is rumored the delay in release was due to the addition of Sans to the group of musicians, an addition much heralded by Helmut Vonlichten
Upon the album's release on the CDBaby website, it came accompanied with the following album description:
"In 1929, the ancient map "Piri Reis" was discovered in Istanbul. The map is extraordinary because it depicts bays and islands on the Antarctic coast which have been concealed under ice for at least 6,000 years. What civilization was capable of such exploration that long ago?
On "Cartographer", we imagine that these explorers were from the tiny island of Numa in the Southern Indian Ocean. As advanced seafarers, they navigated every corner of the Earth. We have created a language unique to them and tell stories through song that describe their creation, discoveries and ultimate demise.
This is a 2 CD collection with Vocal and Remix versions of every song. The Remix CD also contains 2 bonus tracks."
The vocal tracks are sung by Luna Sans, while the remix versions replace her vocals with instrumental solos and choir melodies, much in the style of Posthumus's first album, "Unearthed".
As of 17 January 2008, a new section was added to the official website of E.S. Posthumus with the focus being on the new album.

Drinking establishment

A drinking establishment is a business whose primary function is the serving of alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises. Some establishments may also serve food, or have entertainment, but their main purpose is to serve alcoholic beverages. There are different types of drinking establishment ranging from seedy bars or nightclubs, sometimes termed "dive bars", to 5,000 seat beer halls. 
Bar.
Types of bars range from seedy bars or nightclubs, sometimes termed "dive bars", to elegant places of entertainment for the elite. Many bars have a happy hour to encourage off-peak patronage. Bars that fill to capacity sometimes implement a cover charge during their peak hours. Such bars often feature entertainment, which may be a live band or a popular disc jockey. Bars provide stools or chairs that are placed at tables or counters for their patrons. Some bars have entertainment on a stage, such as a live band, comedians, go-go dancers, or strippers.
The term "bar" is derived from the specialized counter on which drinks are served. The "back bar" is a set of shelves of glasses and bottles behind that counter. In some establishments, the back bar is elaborately decorated with woodwork, etched glass, mirrors, and lights.
Pub.
A public house, informally known as a "pub", is an establishment licensed to serve alcoholic drinks for consumption on the premises in countries and regions of British influence. Although the terms are increasingly used to refer to the same thing, there is a definite difference between pubs, bars, inns, taverns and lounges where alcohol is served commercially. A pub that offers lodging may be called an inn or (more recently) hotel in the United Kingdom. Today, many pubs in the UK, Canada and Australia with the word "inn" or "hotel" in their names no longer offer accommodation, and in some cases have never done so. Some pubs bear the name of "hotel" because they are in countries where stringent anti-drinking laws were once in force. In Scotland until 1976, only hotels could serve alcohol on Sundays. In Wales, an 1881 Act applied the same law until 1961 when local polls could lift such a ban in a district and in 1996 the last ban was lifted in Dwyfor. The need for such polls was removed by the Welsh Assembly in 2003.
There are approximately 53,500 public houses in the United Kingdom. In many places, especially in villages, a pub can be the focal point of the community, so there is concern that more pubs are closing down than new ones opening.
The history of pubs can be traced back to Roman taverns, through the Anglo-Saxon alehouse, to the development of the modern generally prevailing tied house system.
Tavern.
A tavern or pot-house is, loosely, a place of business where people gather to drink alcoholic beverages and, more than likely, also be served food, though not licensed to put up guests. The word derives from the Latin "taberna" and the Greek "ταβέρνα"/taverna, whose original meaning was a shed or workshop. The distinction of a tavern from an inn, bar or pub varies by location, in some places being identical and in others being distinguished by traditions or by legal license. In Renaissance England, a tavern was distinguished from a public ale house by dint of being run as a private enterprise, where drinkers were "guests" rather than members of the public.
Brewpub.
A brewpub is a pub or restaurant that brews beer on the premises. Some brewpubs, such as those in Germany, have been brewing traditionally on the premises for hundreds of years. Others, such as the Les 3 Brasseurs chain in France, and the various chains in North America, are modern restaurants.
Beer hall.
A beer hall () is a large pub that specializes in beer. Bavaria's capital Munich is the city most associated with beer halls; almost every brewery in Munich operates a beer hall. The largest beer hall was the 5,000-seat Mathäser near the München Hauptbahnhof (Munich central train station) which has since been converted into a film theatre.
Izakaya.
An "" is a type of Japanese drinking establishment which also serves food to accompany the drinks. The food is usually more substantial than that offered in other types of drinking establishments in Japan such as bars or snack bars.
Speakeasy.
A speakeasy, also called a blind pig or blind tiger, is an establishment that illegally sells alcoholic beverages. Such establishments came into prominence in the United States during the period known as Prohibition (1920–1933, longer in some states). During this time, the sale, manufacture, and transportation (bootlegging) of alcoholic beverages was illegal throughout the United States.

Eva Carrière

Eva Carrière (born Marthe Béraud), also known as Eva C was a prominent spiritualist and psychic medium in the early 20th century. She was born in 1886 in France.
Biography.
Béraud was the daughter of a French officer and was the fiancée of General Elie Noël's son, Maurice, who died in the Congo from tropical disease in 1904 before the marriage could take place. Béraud was living with General Noël and his wife at Villa Carmen in Algiers and claimed her mediumship ability had developed after the death of her fiancée. 
In 1905 she held a series of séances at Villa Carmen and sitters were invited. In these séances she claimed to materialize a spirit called Bien Boa a 300 year old Brahmin Hindu, however, photographs taken of Boa looked like the figure was made from a large cardboard cutout. In other sittings Charles Richet reported that Boa was breathing, had moved around the room and had touched him, a photograph taken revealed Boa to be a man dressed up in a cloak, helmet and beard.
A newspaper article in 1906 had revealed that an Arab coachman known as Areski who had previously worked at the villa had been hired to play the part of Bien Boa and that the entire thing was a hoax. Areski wrote that he made his appearance into the room by a trapdoor. Béraud had also admitted to being involved with the hoax.
In 1909 Béraud changed her name to Eva Carrière (Eva C) and began a new career as a medium to hide the fraud of her past.
Investigations.
Carrière's psychic performances were investigated by Arthur Conan Doyle, author of the Sherlock Holmes mystery series. He believed that her performances were genuine and that she was not engaged in any deception. Another psychic investigator of the time, Harry Houdini, observed one of her séances and asserted that they were fraudulent. Houdini was never convinced by Carrière and likened her performance to a magician's trick, the Hindu needle trick.
The psychical researcher Gustav Geley investigated Carrière and wrote she was a genuine medium but never-published photographs were discovered after Geley's death which revealed fraudulent activity from the medium's companion, Juliette Bisson, such as wires seen running from Carrière's head supporting fake ectoplasm. Another researcher Albert von Schrenck-Notzing also investigated Carrière and believed the ectoplasm she produced was genuine. The psychiatrist Mathilde Ludendorff wrote that the experiments of Schrenck-Notzing were unscientific and that he had been duped by tricks of Carrière. In the Schrenck-Notzing mediumship sessions with Carrière the scientific controls were scarce and there was evidence that she had freed her hands in the séance room.
Carrière has been described as "perverse and neurotic". She was well known for running around the séance room naked indulging in sexual activities with her audience. Her companion Juliette Bisson (1861–1956) would, during the course of the séance sittings with Schrenck-Notzing, introduce her finger into Eva's vagina to ensure no "ectoplasm" had been loaded there beforehand to fool the investigators, and she would also strip nude at the end of a séance and demanded another full-on gynecological exam.
It has been noted that the mediumship sessions of Carrière with Schrenck-Notzing were pornographic. The photographs that were taken during the séances show Carrière in the nude emerging from her cabinet and others revealing fake ectoplasm strings hanging from her breasts. Another photograph taken revealed ectoplasm in the shape of a deflated, and disembodied penis. Juliette Bisson and Carrière were in a sexual relationship together, and they both worked in collaboration with each other to fake the ectoplasm and eroticize their male audience.
Harry Price wrote the photographs of her ectoplasm taken with Schrenck-Notzing look artificial and two-dimensional made from cardboard and newspaper portraits and that there were no scientific controls as both her hands were free. In 1920 Carrière was investigated by the Society for Psychical Research in London. An analysis of her ectoplasm revealed it to be made of chewed paper. She was also investigated in 1922 and the result of the tests were negative.
Donald West wrote that the fake ectoplasm of Carrière was made of cut-out paper faces from newspapers and magazines on which fold marks could sometimes be seen from the photographs. A photograph of Carrière taken from the back of the ectoplasm face revealed it to be made from a magazine cut out with the letters "Le Miro". The two-dimensional face had been clipped from the French magazine Le Miroir. Back issues of the magazine also matched some of Carrière's ectoplasm faces. In 1913 Miss Barkley in an article in the newspaper "Neue Wiener Tagblatt" had exposed the fraud of Carrière: 
Miss Eva prepared the heads before every séance, and endeavoured to make them unrecognizable. A clean-shaven face was decorated with a beard. Grey hairs became black curls, a broad forehead was made into a narrow one. But, in spite of all her endeavours, she could not obliterate certain characteristic lines.
Cut out faces that she used included Woodrow Wilson, King Ferdinand of Bulgaria, French president Raymond Poincaré and the actress Mona Delza.
In 1954, the SPR member Rudolf Lambert published a report revealing details about a case of fraud that was covered up by many early members of the Institute Metapsychique International (IMI). Lambert who had studied Gustav Geley's files on Eva Carrière discovered photographs depicting fraudulent ectoplasm taken by her companion Juliette Bisson. Various "materializations" were artificially attached to Eva's hair by wires. The discovery was never published by Geley. Eugene Osty (the director of the institute) and members Jean Meyer, Albert von Schrenck-Notzing and Charles Richet all knew about the fraudulent photographs but were firm believers in mediumship phenomena so demanded the scandal be kept secret.

Eyam Hall

Eyam Hall is a Jacobean style manor house in Eyam in Derbyshire which is run by the National Trust.
History.
The Wright family were landowners in Eyam although the family was based in Longstone. William Wright gave his land in Eyam to his second son Thomas who is credited with building the hall. John Wright who was Thomas's son sold his fathers house in Unthank and based his branch of the family in Eyam.

It has been in the Wright family for nine generations (in 2013) and its last use was as a wedding venue. The house is still owned by descendants of the original owners and it is the first house that has been leased rather than given to the National Trust. The historic house is situated in picturesque part of Derbyshire and is an unspoilt example of a gritstone Jacobean manor house. The National Trust opened the hall and garden to the public in March 2013.

Genocide (comics)

Genocide is a fictional character owned by DC Comics, and created by writer Gail Simone for the "Wonder Woman" comic book.
Fictional character biography.
At some point in the future, Ares steals the dead body of Wonder Woman. He comes back through time and manipulates Dr. Barbara Minerva, the power behind the Secret Society of Super Villains, and Dr. T. O. Morrow to gather a team of scientists to collect soil samples from various regions of Earth where acts of genocide took place over the past 100 years. (1908–2008) The scientists, with the magical help of Felix Faust, use the soil to further empower the corpse of Wonder Woman with the evil energy of death and destruction. The result is the creation of the sadistic monster Genocide, brought to life through a combination of science and magic. T.O. Morrow believed Genocide was too unstable to be let loose, and pleaded with Minerva to terminate the project. Further validating his point, Genocide even attacked her fellow team member Phobia, nearly killing her. Despite this, Morrow's words of caution were completely ignored.
Dr. Minerva initially set Genocide loose at a shopping mall in downtown Washington D.C. to draw the Justice League's attention. The Department of Metahuman Affairs dispatched a team of agents, which included Agent Diana Prince to investigate the disturbance. After changing into her super powered alter ego, Genocide beat Wonder Woman near to the point of death and stole her Lasso of Truth. After having the lasso surgically grafted into her body by the new Crime Doctor, Genocide was sent to the home base of the D.M.A. to retrieve the captive Doctor Psycho. She slaughtered nearly everyone there before being attacked by the Justice League. Genocide quickly defeated Green Lantern, Firestorm, and Red Tornado. However, once Wonder Woman returned to the battle with reinforcements and was close to being overwhelmed, Genocide tapped into a facet of Wonder Woman's lasso that allowed her to create an explosion of negative psychic energy. The blast destroyed the Department of Metahuman Affairs building and killed the majority of persons left in its wake. The resulting after-effect overwhelmed the few survivor's emotions and rationality, causing them to react negatively. Before leaving, Genocide kidnapped Wonder Woman's friend Etta Candy. Genocide tortured her, ultimately leaving Etta in a comatose state for Wonder Woman to later find.
Athena reveals to Diana the truth behind Genocide and that the creature will be used by Ares as an instrument to destroy the Gods and heroes unless Diana can stop her. Upon learning this, Diana attacked Genocide with renewed vigor, ripping the surgically implanted lasso from Genocide's body and leaving her to drown in the ocean. When Diana went to retrieve the body she discovers that Genocide had disappeared. Ares arranged for one of the sons of Poseidon to bring him her body so that he can heal her wounds. He then transferred Genocide's soul into a clay figure of a demon child and placed it in the care of a rogue Amazon warrior named Alkyone who is determined to destroy Diana.
When Alkyone becomes the new Queen of Themyscira, she magically causes the spirit of Genocide to enter herself and three other Amazon allies. Their present status is unknown, as Wonder Woman slammed the titan Cottus on top of them, causing the stone monument they stood upon to crumble to the sea. The either unconscious or dead bodies of several of the Genocide-possessed Amazons were dragged to the shore by other non-possessed Amazons.
Genocide locations.
The known soil samples Genocide was created with were taken from:
Powers and abilities.
The full extent of Genocide's abilities has yet to be revealed. Genocide has superhuman strength, durability and speed. She also has the ability to teleport. Genocide can project anger, fear, and despair to weaken her enemies. Being a magical construct, she is nearly indestructible and can heal any damage her body receives. Because Genocide bears the body of the future Wonder Woman, she can tap into the Lasso of Truth to create a large explosion of negative psychic energy. The explosion can not only destroy nearby solid material and people, but also leaves survivors with a backlash of such negative emotion that they do not think or act rationally. She has effortlessly defeated the Justice League of America and nearly killed Wonder Woman herself.

Unit-point atomism

According to some twentieth-century philosophers, unit-point atomism was the philosophy of the Pythagoreans, a conscious repudiation of Parmenides and the Eleatics. It stated that atoms were infinitesimally small ("point") yet possessed corporeality. It was a predecessor of Democritean atomism. Most recent students of presocratic philosophy, such as Kurt von Fritz, Walter Burkert, Gregory Vlastos, Jonathan Barnes, and Daniel W. Graham have rejected that any form of atomism can be applied to the early Pythagoreans (before Ecphantus of Syracuse). 
Unit-point atomism was invoked in order to make sense of a statement ascribed to Zeno of Elea in Plato's "Parmenides": "these writings of mine were meant to protect the arguments of Parmenides against those who make fun of him. . . My answer is addressed to the partisans of the many. . ." The anti-Parmenidean pluralists were supposedly unit-point atomists whose philosophy was essentially a reaction against the Eleatics. This hypothesis, however, to explain Zeno's paradoxes, has been thoroughly discredited.
