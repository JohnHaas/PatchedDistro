WOMI made its debut at 7:00pm Monday, February 7, 1938, becoming the seventh radio station in the state of Kentucky, with a live celebratory broadcast from the Hotel Owensboro. The station began with 250 watts of daytime power and 100 watts at night at 1500 kilocycles. Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer publisher Lawrence Hager formed Owensboro Broadcasting Company as owner and operator of the station. A modern two story art deco building had been constructed on Frederica Street, just south of Byers Avenue, to house the new broadcast operation. 
Lyell Ludwig was hired as WOMI's first general manager but Hager replaced Ludwig in 1939 with the newspaper's city editor Hugh Potter. Potter's wife, Cliffordean, became the station's program director and the couple moved into the station's second floor apartment where they remained until their retirement in 1972.
On March 29, 1941, WOMI moved to 1490 kilocycles as part of the North American Broadcast Treaty which reallocated frequencies for some 1,300 AM stations.
WOMI had no network affiliation until it joined the Mutual Broadcasting System in 1944 just in time for the network's coverage of the D-Day Normandy invasion of World War II. WOMI stayed with Mutual until 1959 when the station became a CBS affiliate.
WOMI had primarily been a full service station during the Potter years of 1939 to 1972.
The station experimented with various formats following the departure of the Potters. The station's post-Potter banner years were the mid to late 1970's when a well-executed Top 40 format drew big audience numbers for the station. WOMI joined NBC's "TalkNet" in 1985 and soon found its niche as the city's News-Talk outlet.

Cecil Clavering

John Cecil Clavering OBE (17 April 1910 – 6 October 2001) was an English architect, best known for his work designing Odeon Cinemas as part of Harry Weedon's architectural practice in the 1930s, and his later work as the architect of the Public Record Office in Kew, London.
Life.
Clavering was born and educated in Sunderland, the son of a schoolmaster. At the age of seventeen he was articled to a firm of architects in South Shields while studying architecture at Armstrong College, Newcastle, where he was introduced to the work of Le Corbusier, Willem Marinus Dudok, Erich Mendelsohn and Berthold Lubetkin. With a travelling scholarship he visited the major architecture centres of Italy, Austria and Germany in 1929 and 1930.
Clavering's work at the time included the draughtsmanship or design of several cinemas in South Shields and Newcastle upon Tyne.
Clavering was unhappy with the classical detailing that was required for the cinemas, however - feeling that such ostentatious decoration was inappropriate in poor areas and also presented practical problems when reproduced in terracotta or faience - and concluded that "the answer appeared to be the new architecture advocated by Le Corbusier and the Germans".
Clavering's opportunity came when Harry Weedon was commissioned to redesign the interior of a cinema being built in Warley for Oscar Deutsch, owner of the expanding Odeon Cinemas chain. Weedon's practice at the time numbered only six architects, none of whom except Weedon himself had any experience of cinema design, so Clavering was recruited to complete the job. He next worked on the Odeon, Kingstanding, then examples in Sutton Coldfield, Colwyn Bay and Scarborough, "one masterpiece after the other" considered "the finest expressions of the Odeon circuit style". Later in 1935 however Clavering stunned Weedon by resigning to take up a job with the Office of Works. Weedon approached Clavering's former tutor who recommended Robert Bullivant as Clavering's replacement.

George M. Todd

George M. Todd (unknown – October 21, 1864) was a Confederate guerrilla leader during the American Civil War who served under William C. Quantrill. A participant in numerous raids, including the Lawrence Massacre in 1863, he was ultimately killed at the Second Battle of Independence in 1864.
Todd had worked as a bridge mason before the war, and served with the Missouri State Guard before joining Quantrill in 1862. He rose to become one of Quantrill's principal lieutenants, and participated in various raids of his own as well as with Quantrill. During the First Battle of Independence on August 11, 1862, Todd served under Quantrill in a two-pronged attack on the city led by Col. John T. Hughes. During the fighting, Todd liberated several prisoners in the city jail, one of whom was the city marshal, James Knowles, who had been imprisoned for the killing of a rowdy citizen. Knowles and a Union captain named Thomas (whom Todd had captured at this same time) were summarily executed by Todd and his men, who wanted revenge for previous attacks made by those two on their command.
On August 21, 1863, Todd participated in Quantrill's raid on Lawrence.
Todd and his men participated in the Centralia Massacre, on September 27, 1864. Following the initial massacre of unarmed soldiers on a train, the guerrillas overran a relief force of inexperienced mounted infantry carrying single shot rifles, killing nearly all of them as well.
Todd was killed during the first day's fighting at the Second Battle of Independence, on October 21, 1864, by Lt. Col. George H. Hoyt of the Fifteenth Kansas as Major General Sterling Price's Confederate forces pushed the Army of the Border through the town. Todd was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in Independence, where his grave is a local historical attraction.

Siege of Jerusalem (1244)

The 1244 Siege of Jerusalem took place during the Sixth Crusade, when the Khwarezm conquered the city on July 15, 1244. As context, Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor led the Sixth Crusade to the Holy Land in 1228, and claimed the kingship of Jerusalem by right of his wife, Queen Yolande of Jerusalem, who had inherited the title of 'Queen of Jerusalem' from her mother, Maria of Montferrat, the wife of John of Brienne. 
The size of Frederick II's army and his reputation within the Islamic world was sufficient to regain Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Nazareth and a number of neighbouring castles without violence. These were recovered by treaty with the Ayyubid Sultan Al-Kamil. However, Jerusalem did not remain for long in Christian hands, as there was not enough territory around it in Christian hands to make it defensible. 
The Ayyubids invited the Khwarazmian clans to reconquer the city. In the siege and subsequent fall of the city on July 15, 1244 the Khwarezmians completely razed Jerusalem, leaving it in ruins and useless to both Christians and Muslims. The Seventh Crusade under Louis IX of France was motivated by this massacre, but it accomplished little except to replace the Ayyubids and Khwarazmians with the more powerful Mamluks as the Crusaders' main opponents in 1250.

The ending of "The Big Sleep" segues into the opening credits of "Micmacs", shot in the old style in black and white with extended production credits.
Bazil hears gunfire and cars outside, opens the door of his shop, and is hit in the head by a stray bullet. A surgical team discusses whether or not to remove the bullet from his brain. Removing the bullet will risk damaging his brain further, while leaving it in will leave Bazil mostly healthy with the risk of dying suddenly at any moment. The head surgeon flips a coin and decides not to remove the bullet. Bazil returns to his job to find that he has been replaced. As he leaves, his replacement gives him a shell casing that she found from the bullet that had struck him. Bazil becomes homeless and lives on the streets of Paris for two months, before being "adopted" by a man named Slammer (Jean-Pierre Marielle). Slammer brings Bazil to a cave carved in a trash dump, where a group of scavengers live. Bazil meets several new friends: Elastic Girl (Julie Ferrier) is a contortionist, Mama Chow (Yolande Moreau) is a cook and leader of the crew, Remington (Omar Sy) is a former ethnographer who speaks in old-fashioned cliches, Buster (Dominique Pinon) is a human cannonball, Tiny Pete (Michel Crémadès) is an artist who designs moving sculptures from scavenged trash, Slammer is a former convict and guillotine survivor, and Calculator (Marie–Julie Baup) is a young woman who measures and calculates things with a glance. While scavenging for trash, Bazil discovers two office buildings and factories on opposite sides of a street. One is the arms manufacturer who built the land mine that killed Bazil's father, and the other is the manufacturer who made the bullet that lodged in Bazil's brain. Bazil decides to go inside, flips a coin, and chooses one of the offices. He asks to speak with the CEO, Nicolas Thibault De Fenouillet, but is immediately thrown out of the building. He crosses the street and manages to hear a speech by the other CEO, François Marconi.
Bazil follows Marconi home and hangs a microphone down his chimney. He hears a phone conversation arranging a meeting between Marconi and associates of Omar Boulounga, an African dictator seeking arms for an upcoming violent conflict. Mama Chow's crew decides to help Bazil exact revenge on the two arms dealers. They first incapacitate Boulounga's men by planting drugs on them in an airport. Remington, claiming to be Boulounga's right hand man, meets with De Fennouillet and proposes the same deal which was offered to Marconi. Later, Remington calls each of Marconi and De Fennouillet and angrily cancels the deal. He tells Marconi that he will be dealing with De Fennouillet, and tells De Fennouillet that he will be dealing with Marconi. The two CEOs are furious and declare war on each other. Bazil and his friends break into Marconi's house and steal and replace his luxury cars, and steal De Fennouillet's collection of body-part relics from historical persons. They steal and destroy a truck full of bombs from Marconi's plant. Marconi assumes that De Fennouillet is responsible, and arranges to sabotage a machine causing a massive explosion in De Fennouillet's factory. Next, Elastic Girl breaks into Marconi's apartment searching for blackmail material while Bazil waits and listens on the roof. Marconi arrives unexpectedly, and Elastic Girl is forced to hide for hours in the refrigerator. De Fennouillet sends an armed team to attack Marconi, but Boulounga's men arrive first and take him hostage. Boulounga's men are about to execute Marconi when they are shot by De Fennouillet's men.
Marconi and De Fennouillet discuss and learn that they have been pitted against each other by Bazil. They capture Bazil on the roof, and take him away in their car. Elastic Girl comes out of her hiding place, and calls in the rest of the crew to rescue Bazil. After a car chase through Paris, Bazil is saved and Marconi and De Fennouillet are captured. The two CEOs are bound and hooded, and they hear a long plane flight followed by a ride in a car. When they are allowed to see again, they are in the middle of the desert. In a scene inspired by Sergio Leone's "Once Upon a Time in the West", De Fennouillet is sitting on Marconi's shoulders with a live grenade in his mouth, while Marconi stands on a live land mine. A small crowd wearing veils sit watching them holding photographs of landmine victims. The men beg for mercy and confess to their roles in supplying arms to the IRA, ETA, and Darfur combatants.
Marconi and De Fennouillet fall and discover that the grenade and mine are not armed. The small audience is revealed to be Bazil and his friends in disguise, who have been recording the event with a video camera. In a flashback inspired by Brian De Palma's "Mission Impossible", we see that Bazil and his friends simulated the entire plane flight with various sound effects, and the desert setting is simply a clearing in a Paris suburb. Bazil and Calculator upload their video to YouTube, and Marconi and De Fennouillet are publicly disgraced. The film ends with a dialogue by Remington how Bazil and the Elastic Girl get together.
Production.
Development.
Jean-Pierre Jeunet originally wrote the character of Bazil for Jamel Debbouze, but Debbouze left the project after three weeks, citing artistic and financial disagreements. The role was later given to Dany Boon.
Jeunet toured arms manufacturing plants in Belgium for research when developing the film. Some dialogue was taken directly from interviews from arms dealers. The sabotaged machine in De Fenouillet's factory was modeled exactly after an actual machine in a plant which Jeunet visited.
Filming.
The film shot in several locations in and around Paris including the exterior of the Musee D'Orsay and the Crimée bridge on the Canal de l'Ourcq, where the Marcel Carné's 1946 film "Gates of the Night" was shot. Jeunet also filmed in several train stations, including Gare de Lyon, Gare Saint-Lazare, and the Charles De Gaulle airport train station.
Effects.
Though the film contains no obvious special effects sequences, digital color manipulation is used throughout, and specific digital manipulations were used on about 350 shots. These manipulations often involved removing people and objects in backgrounds of scenes shot on Paris streets. The closeup of Dany Boon's face during Marconi's speech was out of focus when shot, but his performance was so good that Jeunet decided to digitally focus the face rather than reshooting. De Fenouillet's first appearance in his office was constructed entirely in post production from footage filmed for a different scene. Bazil, Buster, and Slammer were digitally removed from the frame, and De Fenouillet was given dialogue whose audio would synchronize exactly with the original lines filmed.
The character of Elastic Girl performs several contortions on screen which were not digital effects. Julie Ferrier, who played the character, is fairly flexible and did some of the movement herself. The difficult contortions were performed by Julia Gunthel, also known as Zlata. Jeunet and cinematographer Tetsuo Nagata had discovered Gunthel doing an erotic show in Germany.
Tiny Pete's moving sculptures were designed and built by sculptor Gilbert Peyre.
The film contains five appearances of the film's poster, usually hidden in quick shots.
Use of "The Big Sleep".
The film opens with the final sequence of "The Big Sleep", with the original score by Max Steiner. Steiner's score is used throughout the film, but Jeunet also required original music. The music which appears is by Raphaël Beau, an unknown school teacher with no prior professional recording or scoring experience. Beau composed music cues for various scenes. Jeunet loved his music but moved the songs to different scenes in the final version of the film.
Planned scene.
Jeunet also decided to reference his earlier film "Amélie" in the shot when Bazil first lowers his microphone into a chimney. The planned scene would show Amelie and Nino in a small apartment with several crying children. "Amélie" star Audrey Tautou was shooting "Coco Before Chanel", and was unavailable to shoot the scene. The shot was replaced by an homage to Jeunet's "Delicatessen". In the final scene, Dominique Pinon sits with a woman and plays a musical saw.
Reception.
According to Box Office Mojo, "Micmacs" grossed $16,331,174 in the worldwide box office.

WQNU

WQNU (103.1 FM, "New Country Q103.1") is a radio station broadcasting a country music format. Licensed to Lyndon, Kentucky, USA, the station serves the Louisville, Kentucky, area. The station is currently owned by Summit Media LLC.
History.
The station, formerly known as WSTM (for St. Matthews, its former city of license), was assigned the call letters WNUU on 1978-08-28. On 1980-01-01, the station changed its callsign to WRKA. For much of the 1980s, the station had an adult contemporary music format and at one time featured Glenn Beck as their morning drive host. In the late '80's the station adopted an oldies format. 
On July 18th, 2008, at 2:30 pm after playing The Beatles' "Hello, Goodbye" and a message from the station's program director going into a commercial break, the station aired a clip show of moments of the station themed to " American Pie " by Don McLean that ended on the lyric "Something touched me deep inside/The day the music died.", followed by one last jingle. After about a minute of static the station introduced their "new" format as "News/Talk 103.1 WRKA" complete with fake reports before having a fake breaking news report of radio antennas in Kentucky being hacked leading into the introduction of Q Country 103.1 at 3 pm, launching with Kid Rock's "All Summer Long". The same day, they changed callsigns to the current WQNU. The former WRKA callsign is now used on a sister station in the Louisville market.

WRVG-LP

WRVG-LP (93.7 FM) is an American low-power FM radio station licensed to serve the community of Georgetown, Kentucky. The station is currently owned by Georgetown College.
Programming.
Current shows include "Daybreak" with Syd Mosko (M-F 8-12), "After Noon" with Daniel M. Chick (M-F 12-4), and "The Close" with Meredith Scalos (MWF 7-11, T/TH 4-8). Former shows of note are "The Kitchen Sink" with Tori Shover, "Urban Gorilla Mix Radio Show", "Georgetown Focus Show", "The Wrap" with Daniel M. Chick and Rachel K. Hall, and "The Sports Weekend," as well as former flagship show "The Big Picture" with Jordan Rowe.
History.
WRVG was preceded by an AM station called WGTC. Lane Wells, the first faculty advisor of WRVG, served as the student Station Manager of WGTC during the 1958-1959 school year. During that time, the WGTC studio was located on the first floor of Giddings Hall. Later, when Wells returned as a professor, the station was relocated to the attic of Giddings. When the school applied for the license for the new FM station, they wanted to keep the WGTC call letters; but they were already in use by a commercial station. So instead, they chose the call letters WRVG, for the Radio Voice of Georgetown.
WRVG, Georgetown College's campus radio station, came from humble beginnings. The weak 40 watt station was located in the Religious Education building where the current Ensor Learning Resource Center now stands. The faint signal did not discourage devoted broadcasting students and many of them would stay in the radio station all day. The students wished for a more powerful station that would allow more opportunities for Georgetown College and its students in the broadcasting world.
WRVG came on air for the first time on Tuesday, November 19, 1963, at 4PM, and stayed on air for two hours. Three days later, JFK was assassinated. Lane Wells remembered, "I was putting in an air monitor...a Heathkit I bought, built and installed atop the control room rack cabinet. I cried."
WRVG was only the fourth educational FM station to come on the air in the state of Kentucky. The station's first console held the Gates Radio Company consolette. Lane Wells built the platform console in the College's shop the summer of 1963. He installed the two turntables atop the platform, wired it with various mics, recorders, etc.
President Robert Mills budgeted Wells $10,000 from a Shell Oil Company grant to build WRVG.
The first transmitter was a hand-me-down 10-watter from Depauw University. Wells recalled, "I'll never forget riding up to Greencastle, Indiana from Georgetown's air field. The owner-operator, Bob Johnson of WAXU WGOR, downtown, and I flew up in Bob's light plane to see it. We had to sweep snow off of its wings...I prayed."
Bob Johnson was instrumental in helping to get WRVG on the air. The first student Station Manager, Rick Leigh, drove up to Depauw and brought it home...it weighed "tons" in comparison to today's transmitters..
In 1997, Dr. William Gillespie, professor, and then advisor for the campus station, contacted a broadcasting engineer to see if it would be possible to increase the station's signal strength. The engineer researched the question and found, to everyone's surprise, that the station's signal could be increased to 50,000 watts, making it an FM superstation in central Kentucky. The College considered the opportunity and decided to increase the station's signal strength. A tower was built on the limestone rich land on East Campus near the baseball field, and plans were developed to expand the station's programming to a professional, 24/7 broadcast operation.
The powerful new station, 89.9 WRVG-FM, had one of the clearest signals in the southern part of the United States, as there were no other stations in the region sharing that frequency. And since the station would be on the air continuously, a full-time staff was needed who would be able to support the programming schedule when students would be away for summer break and over holidays. A professional staff of twenty was hired, including programming director Tom Martin, a respected national radio broadcaster, on-air hosts Jerry Gerard and Laura Shine, well-known music gurus in the radio world, Jon Bowne of JB's Home Cookin', and newscaster Susan Marshall, now morning anchor on National Public Radio. Dr. Gillespie was the station's general manager.
To ensure a solid and diverse, 24 hour a day, seven days a week, programming schedule, WRVG launched the World Radio Network and sought programs produced by other college radio stations and by public radio stations around the country. Stations were given the opportunity to send to World Radio their best programs and, in return, take whatever shows they wanted in the programming pool for their broadcast schedules. Over 220 stations participated, allowing public radio programs from the World Radio service to be broadcast by stations all over the country, while providing WRVG with exciting programs to fill out its lineup. Georgetown College's WRVG radio programming and its World Radio programming service became a hit locally and nationally.
WRVG offered so much to a wide audience. The station, with its programming motto, "Free the Music!" played mostly jazz and blues, and produced a number of extremely popular news and information programs, including an award-winning poetry program. ACE magazine readers voted WRVG as the best radio station and JB's Home Cookin as the best DJ in Lexington, and because of Georgetown's convenient location on the crossroads of I-64 and I-75, bands from all over would stop by the station to play live in WRVG's performance studio.
In 2003, with a significant downturn in the national economy, the College was compelled to sell the 50,000 watt station. Even though the station was an asset, administrators and trustees believed that selling the station would be more beneficial for the College in the long term. WRVG-FM was sold for $2.7 million, and the World Radio programming service was discontinued. The 89.9 frequency in Lexington, and the tower on the College's east campus, is now in use by the K-LOVE radio network. Still the memory of a great radio station, WRVG- the Radio Voice of Georgetown, survives. WRVG bumper stickers can still be seen occasionally while driving around Lexington.
In 2004, Dr. Jason Phillips came to Georgetown College and took over the role of WRVG's faculty advisor. It was under his direction that a new low-powered station was created. He oversaw the construction of a new tower and antenna on top of the Cralle Student Center. Dr. Phillip's experience and knowledge of how to run a radio station was crucial, since the FCC's deadline for the re-launch of the new WRVG was May 2005. The station was able to keep the WRVG call letters but moved to frequency 93.7 FM.
Dr. Phillips also began teaching a new class entitled Introduction to Broadcasting, which allowed students the chance to have hands-on experience working in radio. This class also allowed the station to train underclassman who would eventually go on to become full staff members at the station. During the 2007-2008 school year, the studio was completely refurbished. This was made possible in part by the donation of equipment from a Georgetown College alumni. WRVG's expansion includes more live, local content created by students and the introduction of new media such as the internet. Live streaming began officially at 7 PM on October 2, 2008. This technology allows the station to obtain a greater audience that terrestrial radio cannot reach.
During the 2008-2009 school year, WRVG continued to make improvements. Some of the highlights of the year included the broadcast of George H.W. Bush's visit to the campus and naming ceremony of the recreation center. WRVG also covered the 2008 election, reporting on events at the national, state and local level. The coverage featured a political panel, state by state presidential returns and results of local Georgetown races with live reports from the courthouse. This was the first time since the rebirth of the station that WRVG covered an election. WRVG also had a special Derby Show that covered the current odds on horses and included special reports including a montage of previous Derby calls. Other regularly scheduled shows included: The Big Picture with Jordan Rowe, GC on the Air with Chris Young and GC Songbook with Elizabeth Cleary.
The year also saw the creation of WRVG Productions: the video production unit of WRVG. The first production was shot during the Spring of 2009. It was a five-part original web series titled "The Freshmen" and was written and produced by WRVG advisor Jason Phillips. The web series debuted in the Fall of 2009. This venture is a part of WRVG.s goals to expand into new media forms.
The station not only benefits students who are directly involved with the station, but it also serves the College community as a whole by providing necessary news, as well as information that is crucial for the day to day operations of the school. The radio station is also a way in which alumni and parents can keep in contact with the college.

Jakob Twinger von Königshofen

Jacob Königshofen (more properly Jakob Twinger von Königshofen) (1346 – 27 December 1420) was a German chronicler.
Life.
Jacob was born at Königshofen, a village near Strasburg, in Alsace, but only a few details of his life are known. He became a priest in 1382, and for a time he held the parish of Drusenheim. In 1394 he became notary Apostolic and in 1395 a canon of St. Thomas at Strasburg, where he was placed in charge of the archives and kept the stock-books and registers.
Early in life he had devoted himself to historical studies, and a Latin "Chronicle" is extant, written by him before he came a priest (edited by Louis Duchesne in "Mitteilungen der Gesellschaft für die Erhaltung der geschichtlichen Denkm ler im Elsass", second series, IV). This work only contains extracts from different authors, and is in consequence a mere collection of historical matter.
His principal work is the "Chronik". He began it in 1382; he twice revised it, and brought it down to the year 1415. One of the first universal histories in German prose, it includes also a territorial history of Alsace and a local history of Strasbourg. Recognizing the needs of his time, he wrote it for the Klugen, that is, cultivated, lay men, "who read such things as eagerly as learned parsons". His narrative is therefore popular, and enlivened by legends, jokes, and details concerning the lives of the people. He possessed a good knowledge and availed himself freely of the sources of medieval prose and poetry (particularly Ekkehard, but also Eusebius, Bede, Hermannus Contractus, Martinus Polonus, and others).
In politics he was an adherent of Louis the Bavarian, an imperialist and German nationalist. Influenced by the Alsatian chronicler Closener, he has himself been in many cases the authority for later historians. The last chapter of the "Chronik" contains an alphabetical list of historical events with dates, forms thus a kind of compendium of history, and was often copied separately. The "Chronik" was printed as early as 1474, and later at Strasbourg in 1698. A scholarly edition is that of Hegel in "Chroniken der deutschen Städte", VIII-IX (Leipzig, 1870-1). Jacob died at Strasbourg, in his seventies.
In addition we possess a Latin-German glossary by Königshofen, which may, however, in its essential details be traced to Closener.

Lactate dehydrogenase elevating virus

Lactate dehydrogenase elevating virus, or LDV for short, belongs to part of the arteriviridae family and the nidovirales order. Also included in the nidovirales order are the coronaviridae. The arteriviridae infect macrophages in animals and cause a variety of diseases. LDV specifically causes lifelong persistent viremia in mice, but doesn’t really harm the host and only slightly harms the immune system. The main clinical sign is an increased level of the plasma enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). LDV has a remarkably narrow cell type specificity, meaning nothing homologous with LDV in mice has been found in another species.
Discovery.
LDV was discovered in 1960 by Dr. Vernon Riley and his colleagues while they were working with plasma enzymes in tumor-bearing mice. They found that many types of transplantable tumors caused a five to tenfold increase in the plasma lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity within three days of the transplantation. This occurred even before the tumors were obvious clinically. In further investigations they found that cell-free plasma from tumor-bearing mice was sufficient to cause this increase, which indicated that the agent was small and further investigation showed that it was a virus.
Transmission.
Because the virus causes persistent viremia, virus in the bloodstream, it can be spread by blood-sucking ectoparasites. This is the theory for spread of virus in feral or wild mice which have been found to be infected in Europe, America, and Australia. Another method of transmission is from the mother to her fetus during pregnancy; however, this mode is much less likely in a chronically infected mother mouse. The mother can also spread the virus to her young through her milk. Studies with male mice have shown that they seldom transmit the virus, however, when an infected male fathers a litter with an uninfected female there are more females in the litter than would be expected and none of them are infected. However, this is controversial; some believe that it can be spread thought sexual contact. Other modes include fighting and cannibalism.
Structure.
LDV has a genome that consists of single stranded positive sense RNA that is 14.1kb long. The genome is dominated by two large open reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1ab; these code for two polyproteins, PP1a and PP1ab. These polyproteins are thought to be cleaved into 12 products. The virus contains a nucleocapsid that is spherical with a diameter of 35 ± 4 nm. This is then enclosed in an envelope to create a smooth surface. The envelope consists of two proteins, VP2 and VP3. VP2 has a molecular weight of 18,000, and VP3 is a heterogeneous glycoprotein of molecular weight 15,000. The envelope is extremely labile and tends to slough off; this characteristic is indicated by its extreme sensitivity to detergent treatment. The virus has a density of 1.13g/mL and the nucleocapsid has a density of 1.17g/mL in a sucrose density gradient. LDV has been shown to mature by budding through the intracytoplasmic membrane. The virions have four structural proteins which include a nucleocapsid protein, a non-glycosylated envelope protein, a major envelope glycoprotein, and a minor envelope glycoprotein.
Pathogenesis.
As mentioned before, LDV has a very high specificity. Studies have shown that LDV is not only host specific, but cell specific as well. The first cells it was shown to replicate in were primary mouse embryo cell cultures, but these cultures had to be freshly explanted. After about seven days the cells lost their ability to support LDV even though they could support other viruses. When other mouse tissues were tested it was found that peritoneal macrophages consistently yielded the highest virus titers. Further studies have shown that in the first twenty-four hours after infection of a macrophage there is very rapid virus replication; this rate gradually falls off to a very low level but continues as long as the macrophage continues to divide. The viremia arises because LDV lyses the cell after replication. The virus is most commonly found in the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and skin. The main effect of the virus on the host cell is to increase the activity of certain plasma enzymes; this increase in activity is not directly related to the level of viral infectivity, but does depend on the balance between rate of entry and rate of clearance and evidence leans more heavily towards the rate of clearance. In the plasma, LDH consists of five isoenzymes and LDV generally only has an effect on LDH A4. Another effect only occurs in the C58 and AKR type mice and involves destruction of lower motor neurons producing age-dependent polioencephalomyelitis. Other effects of the virus include a temporary fall in the total white blood cell count that lasts for twenty-four hours after infection.

Talking Cricket

The Talking Cricket () is a fictional character who appears in Carlo Collodi's 1883 book "The Adventures of Pinocchio" ("Le avventure di Pinocchio").
Role.
The Cricket, who has lived in Geppetto's house for over a century, makes its first appearance in Chapter IV. Pinocchio's mischief has landed his creator Geppetto in prison. The Cricket explains to him that children who are lazy and disobedient never come to any good in the world, and are often sorry afterwards for what they have done. He insists that Pinocchio must either attend school or get a job in order to function properly in the world. When Pinocchio refuses to listen, the Cricket tries to be sympathetic explaining that "You are a puppet and what's worse is that you have a head of wood." In response, Pinocchio angrily throws a mallet at the cricket, killing it.
The Cricket reappears subsequently in Chapter XIII as a ghost. He appears to Pinocchio in a dark wood, telling him to return home rather than keep an appointment with The Fox and the Cat ("Il Gatto e la Volpe") who have deceived Pinocchio into following them on a fool's errand. Pinocchio refuses and in chapter XIV he is subsequently injured in an encounter with the Fox and the Cat (who are disguised as two bandits). The Cricket reappears again in Chapter XVI, where he is revealed to be a doctor. He and his colleagues the Crow and the Owl tends to Pinocchio's injuries though the Cricket reveals his prior experience with the puppet to the others describing him as "...a disobedient rascal, who will cause his poor father to die heartbroken!"
The Cricket makes his final appearance in Chapter XXXVI, where he is living in a house given to him by The Fairy with Turquoise Hair. He forgives Pinocchio and allows him and the ailing Geppetto to stay while Geppetto recuperates.
Quotations.
"Trouble awaits boys who rebel against their parents and capriciously abandon their paternal home! They will never experience goodness in this world, and sooner or later, they will have to pay for it sourly."- Chapter IV
"My boy, do not trust those who promise to make you rich overnight. They are usually either mad or charlatans! Heed my words, and turn back."- Chapter XIII
"Now you call me “your dear little cricket”, true? But do you not recall when, to banish me from your house, you threw a mallet at me?"- Chapter XXXVI

Sakinah (Fatima al-Kubra) bint Husayn

Sakinah bint Husayn (; 
669-736) was the daughter of the early Islamic leader Husayn ibn Ali. It is believed that there were two daughters of Husayn who were with him at the battle of Karbala known by similar names, This Sakinah who was 11 years old that time was one of them and another was Sukayna (4 years old) who is also known as Rukaiya.
Sakinah was also called Fatima al-Kubra ("The eldest Fatima"). There was another daughter of Husayn, Fatima Al Sughra bint Al-Husayn, who was supposed to be ill and left behind at Medina.

Fred Ascani

Alfredo John Ascani (May 29, 1917 – March 28, 2010) was an American Major General and test pilot of the United States Air Force. He was one of the "Men of Mach 1" and was considered father of Systems Engineering at Wright Field.
Early years.
Ascani was born on May 29, 1917 in Beloit, Wisconsin to Italian immigrants just 14 years after the Wright brothers achieved powered flight. His interest in aviation was sparked in 1927 when he watched Charles Lindbergh fly overhead in the "Spirit of St. Louis" on his historic flight to Paris. His family moved to Rockford, Illinois, several miles downriver from Beloit, where Ascani attended Rockford High School and enjoyed a hobby building model airplanes. He graduated as high school valedictorian in 1935 and attended Beloit College for two years. In 1937, Ascani was accepted at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. He graduated 34th out of a class of 425 and in 1941 was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Army Corps of Engineers. Engineering took a back seat to aviation when Ascani was sent to Hicks Field for initial flight training and Foster Army Air Field for advanced flight training.
World War II.
After the U.S. entered World War II, Ascani was assigned as an instructor and squadron commander of the Twin Engine Advanced Flying School in Columbus, Mississippi. Although he had hopes this assignment would be a stepping stone for a combat tour in fighters, Captain Ascani was instead sent to Hendricks Field in Florida, to transition to four engine aircraft. In December 1943, he was placed in command of the 815th Bombardment Squadron of the 483rd Bomb Group. After additional training in the B-17 Flying Fortress, Major Ascani joined the 816th Bombardment Squadron as its commander. The 816th was based in Foggia, Italy, and Ascani flew 53 combat missions in the B-17, including a secret mission delivery of supplies in German-occupied Czechoslovakia to partisans and the evacuation of escaping Allied airmen. Two of his missions were to Ploieşti, Rumania, and one to Memmingen, Germany, where he lost his entire squadron flying at the rear on an unescorted mission after being attacked from behind by over 200 German fighters.
Flight test.
Upon his return to the U.S., Lt. Colonel Ascani was transferred to the Flight Test Division at Wright Field where he was assigned chief of the bomber test section. He attended the Flight Performance School (now the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School) and graduated with class 46. In January 1946, Ascani met his new boss, Colonel Al Boyd, who would have a significant impact on both USAF flight test and Ascani's career. Boyd and Ascani worked well together, and Ascani became Boyd’s deputy both at Wright Field and later at Edwards Air Force Base. One notable decision made by Boyd and Ascani was the pilot choice for who would first break the sound barrier. Although Ascani had initially recommended Major Ken Chilstrom, they eventually agreed that Chuck Yeager would pilot the Bell X-1, and Chilstrom would fly the performance, stability and control tests in the new XP-86. During his tour at Edwards AFB, Ascani flew a wide variety of research aircraft including the X-1, X-4, X-5, and the XF-92A. A highlight of his flying career occurred in 1951 when he flew an F-86E at the National Air Show in Detroit, Michigan, and established a new 100-kilometer closed course speed record of 635 mph. In September 1951, Colonel Ascani was named vice commander of the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards AFB.
In 1953, Ascani left flight test for a time. He studied for a year at the Air War College at Maxwell Air Force Base. After completing the coursework, Ascani was selected as the group commander of the 86th Fighter Interceptor Group based in Landstuhl, Germany. In June 1955, he was assigned as the wing commander of the 50th Fighter Bomber Wing, Hahn, Germany, and Toul-Rosières Air Base, France.
Systems engineering.
After completing his overseas tour, Ascani returned to Wright-Patterson AFB in 1957 as the Deputy Chief of Staff/Plans and Operations at the Wright Air Development Center (WADC). For many years, the USAF was under increasing pressure to reduce the time needed to convert new technologies into usable weapon systems. In May 1959, Ascani was one of twelve Colonels appointed to a committee, by the commander of the, then, Air Research and Development Command (ARDC), General Bernard Schriever, to resolve this issue. Ascani wrote a paper describing a systems engineering group that would be the interface between the laboratories and the product managers. Ascani's paper was the genesis of the committee's recommendations, which became known as the Maxwell Report, released in July 1959. Over the next four years, Wright Field science, engineering, and management capabilities were reorganized to comply with the details of the Report and the vision of General Schriever. Ascani played a key role in implementing the reorganization and was assigned as the first Director of Systems Engineering.
In April 1961, Ascani was assigned as deputy commander and system program director of the XB-70 Valkyrie project. Although only two were constructed, the sleek Mach 3 bomber pioneered technological advances used in later high speed aircraft such as the YF-12 and SR-71. Ascani's organizational skills were put to the test once again when, in 1962, he was appointed chairman of a task force to realign the Air Force Systems Command functions at Wright Field. The resulting structure of four laboratories and a systems engineering group has remained relatively unchanged to the present day. In 1964, Ascani was named commander of the Systems Engineering Group and deputy commander of the Research and Technology Division at Wright-Patterson AFB.
In 1965, Major General Ascani became vice commander of Fifth Air Force, Pacific Air Forces, with headquarters at Fuchu Air Station, Japan. He returned to Wright-Patterson in 1967 as director of operations for Air Force Logistics Command. In 1970, Ascani was named the senior Air Force member of the Weapon System Evaluation Group within the Office of Secretary of Defense. Ascani retired from active duty on August 1, 1973, after 32 years of service.
Later years.
Ascani earned a Master of Science degree from the University of Southern California in 1971. From 1973 to 1981, he served as a USC adjunct professor teaching systems management organization in the Washington, D.C., area. He reached his "second retirement" in June 1981. Ascani had lung cancer and died in his home in Alexandria, Virginia on March 28, 2010. He is survived by his eight children: John Ascani, Bill Ascani, Carole Jo McDaniel, Susan Ascani, Stephen Ascani, Clare Ascani, Betsy Henderson and Dave Ascani. His funeral will be held at 10:30 am on April 9, 2010, at Good Shepherd Catholic Church in Alexandria. He will be interred at Arlington National Cemetery with his wife of 61 years, Catherine Hanretta Ascani (September 11, 1918 - October 5, 2003), on June 3, 2010, with full military honors.
Honors.
Ascani's military decorations and awards include the Air Force Distinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit with oak leaf cluster, Distinguished Flying Cross with oak leaf cluster, Air Medal with four oak leaf clusters, Army Commendation Medal with oak leaf cluster, and Croix de Guerre with palm (France). He is an Honorary Fellow of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots, a member of the Military Aviation Hall of Fame, and an honoree in the city of Lancaster's Aerospace Walk of Honor. In 1992, Ascani was honored as an Eagle in the Air University's Gathering of Eagles Program. Beloit College presented him with its Distinguished Service Citation/DSC Award. In recognition of his absolute speed record in the F-86, he was awarded in 1951 the Thompson Trophy, the Mackay Trophy, and the De la Vaulx Medal.
In June 2012, a street at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base was named after Ascani.

MTL History:
The 8B100 (Military Training Leader) career field has undergone numerous changes to make it what it is today.
Student Training Advisor (STA) first started around 1973 as 99128’s. At that time they were combined with the Military Training Instructor’s and then split to their own AFSC (99138) in 1975.
In December 1991/January 1992 the name was changed to Military Training Managers (MTMs). 
In October 1998, CMSgt Doug Hodge changed the name to Military Training Leaders (MTL)This name was created as a more descriptive way to explain the duties of this position. Showing how leadership was paramount in this position. Being able to show leadership is what being an MTL is all about.
Another change to the program was the creation of a Command MTL position at 2 AF on 7 Aug 1997. Command MTLs are the OPR for all NPS military training programs and responsible for the selection and training of all assigned MTLs.
Prior to a phase program airmen went from basic military training’s very structured, controlled environment to a “no rules” tech school environment; discipline problems were common.
Phase programs were instituted at several tech-training locations in the early 80’s, but a standardized MAJCOM directed phase program was not implemented until 1996; a MAJCOM directed phase program was implemented 1983 (est.)
AETCI 36-2216, Administration of Military Standards and Discipline Training, directs the phase program. 
MTL Mission: To adapt NPS airmen to military life and provide the AF with highly trained, motivated, self-disciplined, and physically fit airmen with exceptional military bearing. 
Unlike the Army, the Air Force uses a different specialist (MTLs) to continue military training during advanced individual or technical training.
What we know now as Military Training Leaders was created in 1973.
Over the years the name has changed but the responsibilities has increased.
Student Training Advisor (STA) 1973-1992
Military Training Manager (MTM) 1992-1998

Baselios Augen I

Catholicos Baselios Augen I (26 June 1884 - 8 December 1975) was the fourth Catholicose of the East of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church.
Early days.
The future Catholicos was born on 26 June 1884 at Perumbavoor, Vengola, Ernakulam district of the Indian state of Kerala to Father Abraham Malpan of Chettakulathukara family. He was ordained as deacon by Kadavil Paulose Mar Athanasius. In 1908 he was elevated to the monastic order of Ramban at the St. Mark's Syrian Orthodox Monastery in Jerusalem. He was consecrated as Metropolitan by name Mor Thimotheos on 15 May 1927 at Jerusalem by the Patriarch of Antioch and all the East, Ignatius Elias III. Patriarch appointed him as the fourth Metropolitan of Kandanad of the "bava" faction in the malankara church. 
In late 1930s he left the bava faction and joined the "metran" faction. He later became the principal of the Theological Seminary of Malankara Orthodox Church and also held charges of the Kandanad and Thumpamon dioceses.
Catholicos of the East and Malankara Metropolitan(1964-1975).
After the Supreme court order in 1958, the two factions of Malankara Church, viz; metran and bava re-united. 
When the re-unified Malankara Association met at Niranam on 17 May 1962, Augen Mor Thimotheos was chosen as the Catholicos of the East. On 22 May 1964 he was installed formally as Catholicos Baselios Augen I by the visiting Patriarch of Antioch and all the East, Ignatius Yakub III. The ceremony was held at M.D. Seminary Chapel, Kottayam. 
His reign in the united Malankara Church lasted until 1975 when there was a second rift and the old two factions re-emerged, which are now known as Jacobite Syrian Christian Church and Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church.
Catholicos of all of the East (1964).
Towards the end of his tenure, schism again started in the Malankara Church and resulted in a vertical split after which Mor Baselios Augen I continued as the Catholicos of one section of the church only, namely Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, whereas the Malankara Jacobite Syrian Orthodox Church elected Mor Philoxenos of Kandanad as Baselios Paulose II and installed him as the Catholicos of the East and Malankara Metropolitan, even though the earlier Unified Malankara Church (prior to the split) had already selected in 1970 Mor Mathews Athanasius (Baselios Mar Thoma Mathews I) as the Catholicos designate.
After a few months, on 24 September 1975 Mar Baselios Augen I relinquished his position as Catholicos of Malankara Orthodox Church and a new head Catholicos Baselios Mar Thoma Mathews I was installed for the Church. 
Two months later, on 8 December 1975, Mar Baselios Augen I died and was buried at Devalokam_Aramana Chapel.
Syriac scholarship.
Having stayed at the various Syrian Orthodox monasteries in Turkey and Syria, he came in contact with various Syriac scholars which helped him to master the Syriac Church language. With his mastery of the Malayalam, Sanskrit and Syriac languages, he composed the 'Pemkisa (Fenqitho) Namaskaram' in Syriac for the feasts of St.Mary and St.Gregorios of Parumala and translated them into Malayalam. His major translations from Syriac are 'Prumiyonukal', ' Valiya Nombilae Namaskaram', 'Pattamkoda Shushrusha Kramangal' and 'Pallikoodasha Kramangal'. He also composed the 'Hoothomo' for 'Holy Synods' and the 'State after death'.

International African Service Bureau

The International African Service Bureau (IASB) was a pan-African organisation founded in London in 1937 by West Indians George Padmore, C. L. R. James, Amy Ashwood Garvey, T. Ras Makonnen and Sierra Leonean labor activist and agitator I. T. A. Wallace-Johnson. Chris Braithwaite, aka Jones, was Secretary of this organisation. The bureau intended to address West African problems to the British general public. Similar in design and organization to the West African Youth League, the IASB also sought to inform the public about the grievances faced by those in West Africa and created a list of desired reforms and freedoms that would help the colonies. The bureau also hoped to encourage new West African trade unions to affiliate themselves with the British labor movement. To further its interest, it held weekly meetings at Hyde Park, where members discussed labor strikes in the Caribbean and Ethiopia. It also supplied speakers to branches of the Labour Party, trade unions and the League of Nations Union and provided questions to be asked in front of Parliament regarding legislation, working conditions and trade union regulations.

Beverly Hills, 90210 franchise

The "Beverly Hills, 90210" franchise comprises the ongoing timeline and shared characters that link the American television series "Beverly Hills, 90210"; "Melrose Place"; "Models Inc."; "90210"; and the 2009 version of "Melrose Place".
The continuity, which progresses in real time, was introduced in 1990 with the debut of Darren Star's teen drama "Beverly Hills, 90210", which was produced by Aaron Spelling and initially aired on the FOX television network in the United States. After this series became a worldwide success in 1991, Star expanded the franchise with 1992's "Melrose Place", a drama about young adults in L.A. which would also grow into a famous hit. The third series, "Models Inc.", aired from June 1994 to March 1995.
The fourth entry, simply titled "90210", was the first show in the franchise which did not debut on FOX in the United States. Developed by Rob Thomas, Gabe Sachs, and Jeff Judah, the series premiered on The CW Television Network on September 2, 2008. On September 8, 2009, the fifth series, a follow-up to "Melrose Place", also debuted on The CW, and concluded in April 2010.
The franchise has been generally well received among young audiences. Several of its actors have gone on to additional success in other areas, while some have returned to portray their roles again in spin-offs. As a result, many characters have appeared in multiple shows throughout the continuity.
Production.
While planning a new teen drama in 1989–1990, FOX learned of Darren Star's interest in writing youth-oriented screenplays. Upon being hired by the network, Star created the concept and characters for the series that would eventually become "Beverly Hills, 90210". The unexpected worldwide success of this project, as well as that of the spin-off "Melrose Place", was largely credited with launching Star's career, while bringing early fortune to FOX in the process.
Aaron Spelling, whose company produced the shows, was well known for producing some of the most famous series on television, including "Dynasty" and "The Love Boat". Spelling would also produce the next show in the franchise, "Models Inc.", in 1994.
"Melrose Place" was initially inspired by Star's own professional aspirations during his 20s, while "Models Inc." was born when FOX asked Spelling for an eight-part summer series. When ratings proved adequate, the show continued throughout the following television season. "Models Inc." concluded in 1995, "Melrose Place" finished in 1999, and "Beverly Hills, 90210" ended in 2000.
In 2008, the franchise returned via the fourth production, "90210", attracting a new collection of noted creators. Rob Thomas, known for the television show "Veronica Mars", began the initial work on the project. Prior to the premiere, Thomas was succeeded by producers Jeff Judah and Gabe Sachs, both known for the series "Freaks and Geeks" and "Undeclared". During the first season, Rebecca Sinclair, who had previously worked on "Gilmore Girls" and "Buffy the Vampire Slayer", became the series' new show runner. In June 2009, a fifth production, a follow-up to "Melrose Place", was officially confirmed.
Writers.
Emmy-nominated scribe Charles Rosin joined "Beverly Hills, 90210" in its first year and served as a writer and executive producer, scripting several episodes in seasons to come along with his wife Karen. Other prominent writers of the first series included John Eisendrath and Steve Wasserman.
Charles Pratt, Jr. and Frank South worked closely with Darren Star in writing early seasons of "Melrose Place", helping to set the tone of the series as it grew in popularity. Pratt and South would then create the similarly toned "Models Inc." Rebecca Sinclair wrote for "90210" during the first season prior to her promotion.
Casting.
Throughout its run, the franchise has attracted several established actors, while bringing fame to others and the roles which they have portrayed. The narrative's most widely seen character is Jennie Garth's Kelly Taylor, who was instrumental in launching two spin-offs, and has been used in the most episodes throughout the continuity. Also made famous via the first program was male lead Jason Priestley, who earned Golden Globe nominations and began a directorial career via the series, and actor Luke Perry, who won acclaim and drew comparisons to James Dean. The first series brought fame to several other cast members as well.
"Melrose Place" featured former "Dynasty" and "T.J. Hooker" star Heather Locklear, whose performance has been called one of the most prominent of the show, and also starred former child actress Alyssa Milano. "Models Inc." featured former "Dallas" actress Linda Gray, and later added "Dynasty" veteran Emma Samms. In addition, several actors known for their work in American daytime television—including Kristian Alfonso, Stephen Nichols, Jack Wagner, and Vanessa Marcil—have made appearances in the franchise.
In 2009, singer-actress Ashlee Simpson joined the proposed fifth series of the continuity, a follow-up to "Melrose Place", as Violet Foster. It was later announced that Laura Leighton would reprise her role as Sydney Andrews (despite the character having apparently died during the original series), who was recognized by "The Hollywood Reporter" as "one of the most popular characters" from the previous show. "Friday Night Lights" actress Aimee Teegarden appeared in the fourth series, "90210", during its first season. Additionally, "90210"'s Sara Foster and Shenae Grimes have revealed that they were fans of the original show while growing up.
Several actors have gone on to additional fame following their work in the franchise. Marcia Cross, who would later star in "Desperate Housewives", played Kimberly Shaw in the original "Melrose Place" from its first season until its fifth. Kristin Davis joined "Melrose Place" in 1995, and starred afterward in the HBO series "Sex and the City". Additionally, Kelly Rutherford, later known for the series "Gossip Girl", joined "MP" in 1996, remaining with the show until its 1999 conclusion. Carrie-Anne Moss, of "The Matrix" fame, starred in "Models Inc." throughout its duration.
Dean Cain, who would go on to star in "", appeared in "Beverly Hills, 90210" during 1992, while Eddie Cibrian, later known for his role in "Third Watch", guest-starred in 1996. Vivica A. Fox, Hilary Swank, Matthew Perry, Peter Krause, and David Arquette all appeared in the first show as well. Actor Kellan Lutz guest-starred in the fourth series throughout its first season.
Series.
"Beverly Hills, 90210".
Debuting in 1990, the first series initially followed the teenage lives of several friends who attended the West Beverly Hills High School: Brandon Walsh (Jason Priestley), Brenda Walsh (Shannen Doherty), Kelly Taylor (Jennie Garth), Steve Sanders (Ian Ziering), Andrea Zuckerman (Gabrielle Carteris), Dylan McKay (Luke Perry), David Silver (Brian Austin Green), Scott Scanlon (Douglas Emerson), and Donna Martin (Tori Spelling). As the series progressed, several other characters were introduced at varying points.
Originally, the series centered around the culture shock of twins Brandon and Brenda as they adjusted to the new experiences and friends that awaited them upon their family's move to Beverly Hills. As the show progressed, however, it gradually became more of an ensemble cast drama, with equal attention given to the familial issues, academic matters, career aspirations, and romantic concerns of the other characters. One of the series' early focal points involved a briefly forbidden Brenda-Dylan relationship—along with a subsequent triangle involving Kelly. Other prominent stories included the beginning of a long relationship between Brandon and Kelly, a similar bond between Donna and David, and a rally organized on Donna's behalf in order to overturn a school ruling against her.
Toward the end of the second season, the character Jake Hanson—an older friend and mentor to Dylan—briefly arrived for a construction job at Kelly's house. The subsequent attraction that developed between a resistant Jake (Grant Show) and a willing Kelly led into the second series of the "Beverly Hills, 90210" franchise.
"Melrose Place".
Darren Star's next show, which premiered in 1992, followed the lives of several young tenants in a Los Angeles apartment complex. The relationship between Kelly and Jake was resolved over a series of episodes, with a persistent Kelly eventually letting go and returning to Beverly Hills.
Originally conceived as a fairly straight-faced drama about the personal and professional lives of people in their twenties and early thirties, "Melrose Place" began to change with the arrival of testy Amanda Woodward (Heather Locklear), whose conflicts with the generally strait-laced Alison (Courtney Thorne-Smith) over Alison's roommate Billy (Andrew Shue) quickly became the show's centerpiece. Also focused upon was the adulterous relationship between Dr. Michael Mancini (Thomas Calabro) and his colleague Kimberly Shaw (Marcia Cross), which was eventually discovered by Michael's wife Jane (Josie Bissett). The first season also introduced Jane's sister Sydney (Laura Leighton), an occasional vixen, who would become one of the most layered and prominent characters of the series.
With the progression of the second season—which was highlighted by divorce, blackmail, revenge, character revamps, and much angst between couples—the show had begun to secure a reputation for darker, more extraordinary story lines. This kind of writing would become standard for the series throughout the remainder of its run.
Toward the end of season 2, a somewhat mellowed Amanda was reunited with her long-estranged mother Hillary (Linda Gray), the owner of a modeling agency. This development would provide a foundation for the franchise's third story.
"Models Inc.".
Debuting in the summer of 1994, "Models Inc." was produced by Spelling Television and created by Charles Pratt, Jr. and Frank South. The series followed the lives of Hillary and several of the disparate, ambitious models in the titular agency—women whom Hillary sometimes felt a maternal bond toward. Also present was Hillary's son David (Brian Gaskill), the loyal, valiant, and occasionally hot-headed vice president of the company. At the beginning of the first episode, actors Grant Show and Daphne Zuniga briefly appeared as their "Melrose Place" characters, seeing off a young model named Sarah Owens (Cassidy Rae) as she headed to the agency.
Unlike the previous two shows in the continuity, "Models Inc." did not experience any significant changes in character focus or tone—choosing, instead, to explore the ensemble cast from the start and immediately present the kind of story lines that had made "Melrose Place" famous. The initial focus of the series was a mystery surrounding the murder of model Teri Spencer (Stephanie Romanov), who'd announced her intentions to leave the agency. For a number of episodes throughout the first story arc, suspects included Hillary, Teri's ex-boyfriend Brian (Cameron Daddo), Teri's rival Julie (Kylie Travis), and Teri's own sister Carrie (Carrie-Anne Moss). Once the killer was revealed, the characters moved on, with their focus switching to the arrival of Stephanie Romanov's new character Monique, a model who was a nearly dead ringer for Teri. The remainder of the series largely centered around the models' growing relationships with their boyfriends and each other, while also dealing with the issues of substance abuse and the pressures of the business. Primary antagonists included several figures from the models' pasts—including a stalker, a jealous sister, and Grayson (Emma Samms), the cunning and powerful ex-wife of Monique's fiance.
The series was canceled in March 1995. Jake Hanson, who was originally introduced in the continuity's first show, was the only character to appear in both "Beverly Hills, 90210" and "Models Inc."
"90210".
Premiering on September 2, 2008, "90210" was produced by CBS Paramount Network Television. The series introduces two siblings—Annie and Dixon Wilson (Dixon is adopted), played by Shenae Grimes and Tristan Wilds—who move to Beverly Hills with their family and enroll in West Beverly High. Like Brandon and Brenda 18 years before, Dixon and Annie meet several new friends who comprise the rest of the cast, including Erin Silver (Jessica Stroup), the half-sister of David and Kelly from the original series. The character Naomi Clark (AnnaLynne McCord) gained significant media attention throughout the first season, and was given increased focus at the onset of the second.
Among the returning characters was Kelly Taylor, who appeared in a recurring role while serving as a guidance counselor at the school. Brenda Walsh also returned in a recurring part, reuniting with Kelly and directing a school musical. Donna Martin returned as well, coming back to Beverly Hills from Japan, where she worked as a fashion designer. In addition, Joe E. Tata made guest appearances, reprising his role of Nat Bussichio, owner of the Peach Pit coffee house where Dixon worked. The series concluded in May 2013, following its fifth season.
"Melrose Place" (2009).
On January 19, 2009, "Entertainment Weekly" confirmed Todd Slavkin and Darren Swimmer were installed as showrunners of a "Melrose Place" spin-off, which used the same title as the previous show. The series premiered on September 8, 2009. Ashlee Simpson-Wentz, Shaun Sipos, Jessica Lucas, Stephanie Jacobsen, Katie Cassidy, Michael Rady, and Colin Egglesfield were cast in regular roles. Throughout 2009, it was also revealed that Laura Leighton, Thomas Calabro, Josie Bissett, Daphne Zuniga, and Heather Locklear would make appearances as their characters from the original series. The show was officially canceled in May 2010.
Actors with multiple roles.
Several actors have portrayed more than one character throughout the continuity, many of them appearing as regulars on one series and as guest stars on another. In some cases, a performer has appeared in different roles on the same show.
Characters with multiple series appearances.
The following characters appear in multiple series.
Reception.
"Beverly Hills, 90210" has been called "one of the definitive shows of the 1990s." In a look back at the series, "TV Guide" labeled the program "soapy and addictive". In 1994, the series ranked No. 1 among viewers aged 18–34. The show was nominated for "Best Drama" at the Golden Globe Awards in 1992 and 1993, with Jason Priestley being nominated for "Best Performance by an Actor In A Television Series—Drama" in 1993 and 1995.
"Entertainment Weekly"'s Ken Tucker criticized the original tone of "Melrose Place" in a 1992 article, stating that "on this show, everybody's a philosopher—even more unusual, a philosopher with a cute bottom." Despite giving the series a mixed review, he admitted to being "hypnotized by it" and added that ""Melrose" is the guilty pleasure that adds some salt and sweat to summertime TV." The show received an overhaul as it advanced toward its second season, with "TV Guide" citing the "bed-hopping, backstabbing and cliffhangers" as key factors in its success, also noting the arrival of Heather Locklear's Amanda Woodward. In 1994, the series became the No. 2-rated drama among viewers aged 18–34 (behind "Beverly Hills, 90210"), with "People" magazine labeling it a "compulsively watchable, high-trash hit." Locklear and Laura Leighton were nominated for Golden Globe Awards in 1994, with Locklear receiving additional nominations from 1995 through 1997.
In his review of "Models Inc.", Ken Tucker claimed that the show was "trying much too hard to match "Melrose" for self-consciously outrageous campiness." However, he commended the work of Kylie Travis as vixen Julie Dante. "Entertainment Weekly" also screened the series in front of young real-life models, who concluded that the show was unrealistic but addictive. The series ended in 1995, but later aired an alternate ending during a rebroadcast of the finale, bringing closure to the story lines.
At the time of its premiere, "90210", which marked a return for the franchise following an eight-year absence, became the highest-rated scripted debut in the history of The CW network. In the midst of its first season, the show was nominated for "Favorite New Drama" at the 2009 People's Choice Awards. Upon the completion of season 1, the show received additional nominations from the Teen Choice Awards, including "Breakout Show" and "Choice TV Show: Drama". AnnaLynne McCord was nominated for "Breakout Star Female" in the role of Naomi Clark, Tristan Wilds was placed in contention for "Breakout Star Male", and Dustin Milligan was nominated for "Choice TV Actor: Drama". Additionally, Rob Estes and Lori Loughlin were nominees for "Choice TV: Parental Unit". The following year, Shenae Grimes was nominated for "Choice TV: Female Scene Stealer". At the 2010 Breakthrough of the Year Awards, AnnaLynne McCord won in the category of "Breakthrough Standout Performance".
On September 2, 2010 (9/02/10), "Reuters.com" featured an article on the original series. Via a Twitter message the same day, Jennie Garth stated, "Love to the original cast and crew. And the new kids too."

Asahiyutaka Katsuteru

Asahiyutaka Katsuteru (born 10 September 1968) is a former sumo wrestler from Kasugai, Aichi, Japan. His highest rank was "komusubi". He is now the head coach of Tatsunami stable.
Career.
He joined Oshima stable and made his professional debut in March 1987, and was ranked in the lowest "jonokuchi" division in the following tournament. However due to various injury problems he fell off the "banzuke" ranking sheets and did not actually record his first win in "jonokuchi" until May 1988. By May 1990 he had progressed to the "makushita" division and after taking his second "makushita" "yusho" or tournament championship in September 1993 he was promoted to the second highest "jūryō" division. After winning the "jūryō" "yusho" in January 1995 he made the top "makuuchi" division.
Asahiyutaka was ranked in the top division for 24 tournaments, winning two special prizes for Outstanding Performance and Technique. He also earned four "kinboshi" or gold stars for defeating "yokozuna". He reached his highest rank of "komusubi" in 1996 and held it for three tournaments, but he lacked the weight to regularly beat the top men, and never managed to progress further.
Retirement from sumo.
In 1995 he had married the daughter of Osamu Annen, the head coach of the Tatsunami stable, and was legally adopted by him as his son, changing his real name from Taiji Ichikawa to Taiji Annen. This enabled him to take over the running of Tatsunami stable when Annen reached the mandatory retirement age of sixty five in February 1999. Asahiyutaka had in any case lost his top division status at the previous tournament in January, recording only four wins at "maegashira" 13, and had announced his retirement from active competition.
It was clear that Asahiyutaka's marriage was only one of convenience, arranged solely to enable him to inherit the Tatsunami elder name and stable, and it eventually broke down with the couple being divorced in August 2001. In February 2003 Annen took Asahiyutaka to court, demanding that he be paid for the elder stock that Asahiyutaka had received for free as a result of his marriage. Annen was initially awarded 175 million yen, but Asahiyutaka appealed and the decision was overturned by a higher court. Annen did succeed however, in evicting Asahiyutaka from the stable premises.
Asahiyutaka moved Tatsunami stable to a new site, and remarried in 2005. He recruited the Mongolian wrestler Mōkonami who reached the top division in 2009, but was forced to retire in 2011 after being found guilty of match-fixing.
Fighting style.
Asahiyutaka was a "yotsu-sumo" wrestler who specialised in grappling rather than pushing techniques. His preferred grip on the opponent's "mawashi" was "hidari-yotsu", a right hand outside, left hand inside position. His favourite "kimarite" were "uwatenage" (overarm throw) and "katasukashi" (under-shoulder swing down).

Instituto Tecnológico de Nogales

Instituto Tecnológico de Nogales (ITN) is a university located in Nogales, Sonora, Mexico.
History.
In 1975, on an international visit to Nogales, the President of Mexico, Luis Echeverría Álvarez met the President of the United States, Gerald Ford. At the end of the meeting, Álvarez made the official announcement, that a regional technological institute was approved for Nogales beginning in September of that year.
Work began October 1975 of what is now the top house studies, under the name Instituto Tecnológico Regional de Nogales, under the direction of Engineer Rafael Navarro Escobar. With a population of 224 students and 20 professors, the Institute offered specialties in Electromechanic Technician, Electronics Technician and Bachelor of Business Administration.
The preparatory level offered the starting specialties: Accounting Technician, Chemistry Lab Technician and Electronics Technician.
In that year (1975), the Department of Planning and Development was formed, implementing guidelines on what should optimize the resources available for the future; the Coordination of Technical and Higher Studies, School Services and General Services were integrated. Offices of Public Relations and Editorial were established.
The expansion of the institution was initiated under the leadership of Engineer Escobar and the subdirectorate of Engineer, Fedaderico Campos Chacon, due to widespread demand giving a growth of 1566 students to the preparatory level and 222 students at the undergraduate level.
On November 20, 1975, the first board of the Regional Institute of Technology Nogales was formed. At the helm as President, Ernesto Elias Islands, as Secretary, Mendivil Francisco Estrada, as treasurer, Federico Campos Chacon; Dr. Jesus Martinez Ochoa as vice president and Gustavo Montalvo Pompa as prosecretary.
In 1979 the first 7 students graduated from the Institute, 2 in Industrial Engineering and 5 in Business Administration.
By 1982 and 1983, in an area of 7.9 hectares with the necessary buildings, workshops, laboratories and equipment, the school was operating with a student population of 2028 students, 54% in the undergraduate level and 46% in preparatory level, with 143 teachers and 110 administrative and service staff.
In 1984, a classroom was converted for use as a Computing Center and around mid-year Engineer Marcelino Bauzá Rosete replaced Engineer Almogábar Raul Sanchez as director, continuing as Deputy Director Eng. Jorge Garcia Revilla.
In 1985, D.G.I.T authorized the career in Computer Systems Engineering, starting with 23 students.
In 1985, the Administrative Building and Industrial Engineering Lab were opened. In November of that year, the word "Regional" was removed, becoming Instituto Tecnológico de Nogales.
Consolidation.
In 1986, the Master Plan for Institutional Development was drafted, searching for a new model for educational excellence to meet the social demands and development of higher education in technology. The establishment of the Center for Graduate and Research and Research-teacher Training Project were also studied.
In 1987, the D.G.I.T. authorized the unit in the Municipality of Agua Prieta, Sonora, as well as the Master of Computer System in the ITN, which began with 15 students. In August of that year, began the process of segregation of the high school level, suspending registrations for new students.
In early 1990 the functional units that made up the ITN were: Technical Studies Division, Division of Higher Studies, Outreach Division. Coordination of Research, Departments of Educational Technology, Center of Information, Planning, Budget Management, Human Resource Management, School Services, General Services, Communication and Broadcasting Offices and Publisher, and linkage with the productive sector.
In the same year (1990), the entire administrative team was broken into departments. That process meant to optimize and streamline administrative tasks in order to provide a firm support in the academic activities and quality standards.
On September 3, 1996, the D.G.I.T. appointed MS Oscar Armando Lopez Gonzalez as Director of the Instituto Tecnológico de Nogales, MS Juan de Dios Garcia Gerardo became the Academic subdirector and staying at their posts MS Eduardo Sanchez Arellano as an administrator subdirector and engineer Manuel de Jesus Ruiz Beltran in Department of Planning and Outreach.
In 1997, during the graduation ceremony for graduates of ITN, the segregation of Agua Prieta division was announced, to become Instituto Tecnológico de Agua Prieta.
In 2002, M.S Luis Armando Ramirez Cheu received the appointment as Director of the Instituto Tecnológico de Nogales, with the following staff: 
Academic Assistants: Engineer Luis Miguel Paz Moreno and MA. Jose A. Padilla Estrella, Administrative Assistants; B.S. Miguel A. Sarmiento Aguiar and B.S. Arana Guillermo Robles, Deputy Director of Plantation; Engineer Manuel de Jesus Ruiz Beltran and M.S. Gerardo Ochoa Salcido.
Logo.
The school logo was designed by Engineer Jorge Guillermo Zazueta, professor of Industrial Engineering in 1975.
The gear was selected to means movement and gestation, indicating the fundamental objectives of the Technological Institute of the region. The gear, divided into four parts by two axes, contain a transistor, a torch, a microscope and acronyms of the Instituto Tecnológico de Nogales.
The motto of the Institute is "La Ciencia y tecnologia para la liberacion del hombre", which means "Science and Technology for man's freedom".
Mascot.
Since 1975, the mascot of the Institute is the colt. This mascot was elected by competition among the technology community.
The colt was chosen because it represents freedom and being without borders, yet when it is trained it becomes faithful and obedient. Also with strong ties to family and its territory, it is robust and strong, and has no limits to its imagination and creativity.

Fenny Bentley

Fenny Bentley is a small village located close to Dovedale in Derbyshire, England. It lies two miles north of Ashbourne, on the A515 Buxton to Ashbourne Road. It is the most southerly village in the Peak District.
History.
Records show that a settlement has existed at Fenny Bentley since being mentioned in The Domesday Book in 1086, when it was known as Benedlege.
Early records of The Church of St. Edmund date back as far as 1240, with much of the available historical data that provides information on the village being associated with the church and the information recorded here. 
The introduction of the census in the United Kingdom in 1801 means that more consistent information on the parish and how it has developed over time is now available. The population of the village has fluctuated slightly since the 19th century, with a peak in 1841 of 343 people living there.
St Edmund's Church.
Located in the centre of the village, St Edmunds is an Anglican church that has been heavily restored since being built. Early records of The Church of St. Edmund date back as far as 1240, which show that Fenny Bentley was one of six chapelries attached to St Oswald's Church, Ashbourne
The north aisle was added in 1850, and in 1864, the spire was added to the original tower. It has seating for around 200 people. Some interesting features of the building are its 16th-century traceried screens as well as the alabaster Beresford tomb located there, which holds the bodies of Sir Thomas Beresford, his wife Agnes and their 21 children, all shrouded.
Beresford Family name.
Sir Thomas Beresford, who died in 1473, is buried with his family in St Edmunds Church in the village. They were from a prolific family who lived in the area for generations, and owned much of the property and land there. It is suggested that everyone with the surname Beresford is descended from them and there are still reunions held in Fenny Bentley every spring as it is now the meeting place for the Beresford Family Society.
Cherry Orchard Farm.
Cherry Orchard farm is located opposite St Edmunds Church. Previously known as Bentley Hall, it was once the home of the Beresford Family and at the end of the 14th and beginning of the 15th century it was the home of Thomas Beresford as well as his wife and children.
Tattersall Cotton Mill.
Many of the residents of Fenny Bentley in the past worked at Tattersell Cotton Mill, which was located in Woodeaves, a nearby hamlet approximately 1 mile from Fenny Bentley. The mill was built in 1784 by John Cooper, and was originally powered by the Bentley Brook. Around 100 people were employed there, mainly for the Nottingham lace and cotton trade. 
In 1886, the mill was brought by Manchester cotton merchant Cornelius Tattersell, father of John Lincoln Tattersall who was also employed there; he established a home in nearby village Thorpe, Derbyshire with his wife Lizzie Harland in 1893.
In 1908, the mill ceased production but the warehouse was taken over in 1910 by William Nuttall. Originally from Melton Mowbray, he was the brother of John Nuttall, who was the owner of the Harlington Cheese Factory. Stilton cheese was produced there until 1930.
On the outskirts of the village is the Leatherbritches Bentley Brook Inn and Fenny's Restaurant, a traditional busy country Inn with its own brewery. The brew house is established in the old washhouse and coal store at the back of the Inn where real ales are brewed two or three times each week.
Geography.
Fenny Bentley lies on the southern edge of the Peak District, within the Derbyshire Dales, East Midlands. It lies approximately 3 miles from Dovedale, a Dale that features riverside paths accessible for walkers. Dovedale is centred around the River Dove in a Limestone valley. The site is owned by the National Trust, and the area is very popular with tourists, with the Peak District claiming to be the second most visited National Park in the world with 22 million visitors per year, behind Mount Fuji National Park in Japan. Tourism plays an important role for the few businesses that have been established in Fenny Bentley, such as the Coach and Horses inn which lies on the main route through the village, appealing to visitors to the area who may pass through on the A515 Buxton to Ashbourne Road.
Much of the agricultural land around Fenny Bentley is pasture, the growing of crops being rare. It is suggested that arable farming was never widely practised in the area although this has suggestion has been challenged, with fossilised traces of ridge and furrow being discovered beneath grass covered meadows, in fields around Fenny Bentley, Thorpe and Tissington.
Demography.
Early census reports show that many of the people living in Fenny Bentley in the past worked locally. The majority of males worked in agricultural professions in the area, whilst the majority of females were distributed between having no known profession or being employed in the textiles industry, most likely to be the Tattersall Cotton Mill and other similar locations within the region.
More recently, the population of Fenny Bentley is seen as generally a little older, with a mix of families with older children and retired households. The income in this area is generally above average and residents typically work in managerial positions, are well educated and are likely to have paid off their mortgages. The average house price in the area has decreased more recently, with the average price for a detached house in 2010 being £344,290, compared to an average in the first quarter of 2012 of just £267,833.
Transport.
Fenny Bentley has very few transport connections, although being within easy reach of cities such as Derby and Sheffield by road, this is the only transport access to the village. The nearest alternative transport connections are slightly further afield, Matlock Bath railway station is located 8.98 miles away, whilst East Midlands Airport is 22.98 miles from the village. The nearest port is located in Liverpool, approximately 57 miles from Fenny Bentley.

1987–88 Huddersfield Town F.C. season

Huddersfield Town's 1987–88 campaign is statistically Town's worst ever season in their league history. Town won only 6 league games all season, had their heaviest ever defeat in their history, conceded 100 league goals in the season and finished 19 points adrift of safety and even 14 points behind 2nd-bottom team Reading. Both of the two managers during the season, Steve Smith and Malcolm Macdonald both failed miserably and are regarded as the two worst managers in Town's history.
Review.
The start of the season was at the time, the worst in Town's history. The team lost most of their early games and Steve Smith, a hero during his playing days at Leeds Road, was shown the door on October 6, after the 2–0 defeat at Birmingham City. Malcolm Macdonald replaced Smith a week later, but it wasn't until the end of the month that Town registered their first win, a 2–1 victory at the end-of-season champions Millwall.
However, a week later, Town recorded their biggest ever loss in their history, going down 10–1 against Manchester City at Maine Road. After that embarrassment, Town recovered slightly going on a run of only 1 defeat in 6 matches. However, this proved to be nothing more than a false dawn and Town's chances of survival would shortly become non-existent.
Following their 2–1 win over Plymouth Argyle on December 12, Town would only win 2 matches for the remaining 5 months of the season, they were a 1–0 win at Bradford City and amazingly a 1–0 win against a Manchester City side, who 4 months earlier beat them 10–1. Town finished up with only 28 points, finishing 14 points behind Reading in 23rd place and a further 5 behind the safety zone of 21st placed West Bromwich Albion. Macdonald was sacked just before the last game of the season against Sheffield United. Eoin Hand would replace Macdonald for the new season in the Third Division.

Shepherdstown Historic District

The Shepherdstown Historic District comprises the historic core of Shepherdstown, West Virginia. The town is the oldest in West Virginia, founded in 1762 as Mecklenburg. No structures are known to exist from the time time before the town became known as Shepherdstown. The historic district is concentrated along German Street, the main street, with 386 contributing resources and 69 non-contributing elements. The chief representative period is the late 18th century, with many Federal stylebrick houses. German Street is also furnished with 19th-century "street furniture" such as metal fences, mounting blocks, wooden pumps and mature trees.
The town has a significant place in American history. James Rumsey made a public demonstration of a steamboat in 1787 on the nearby Potomac River. Shepherdstown was proposed as the National Capital in 1790, losing to Alexandria, Virginia and Georgetown, Maryland at the tidal headwaters of the Potomac. During the Civil War, Shepherdstown was in a pivotal position, with Confederate forces burning the covered bridge over the Potomac in 1861, then using nearby Pack Horse Ford to and from the Battle of Antietam. The entire town became a field hospital following this action. Later, Federal troops occupied the town to preserve the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad link to the west.
Some of the more significant elements are:
The historic district was expanded in 1987 to include properties from the late 19th century, including the Register Building, the Opera House and the Jefferson Security Bank. The expansion also includes Elmwood Cemetery, with a large number of Civil War graves. Outer portions of the expanded district include American Foursquare and bungalow styles of housing. The older portions of the Shepherd University campus are also included.

She Never Cried in Front of Me

"She Never Cried in Front of Me" is a single by American country music singer Toby Keith co-written by him and Bobby Pinson. It was released in July 2008 as the first single for his studio album, "That Don't Make Me a Bad Guy", released on October 28. For the week of November 1, 2008, the song has become his 17th Number One hit on the "Billboard" Hot Country Songs chart.
Content.
The song is a mid-tempo ballad in which the narrator watches his former lover getting married. Upon doing so, he sees her crying, which makes him think of "all the hell" he put her through when they were together, thinking that nothing was wrong with her, because she "never cried in front of ".
Bobby Pinson wrote the song with Keith at Keith's house in mid-2007. According to Pinson, he sat down at Keith's piano and the two started working on the song there. According to Keith, it was the first time that he ever sat down at a piano to write a song, and he thought that it "changed everything. It brought a whole new approach to the melody."
Reception.
The song received a "thumbs down" review from the country music site The 9513. Reviewer Brady Vercher stated that the "lyric fleshes out too many irrelevant details that end up creating all sorts of logical fallacies", and that the song was generally over-produced. He also considered it derivative of Tracy Lawrence's 1994 hit "I See It Now", which also features a storyline based on a man's realization of "all the hell" he has put a former lover through.

Hussian School of Art

The Hussian School of Art is a private vocational school for graphic design and commercial illustration located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. 
It was established in 1946 and offers a four-year, full-time, program.
History.
The Hussian School of Art was founded by John Hussian, a member of Philadelphia's art community and a lecturer at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. He taught commercial art and fine art. At the end of World War II, returning veterans and civilians were searching for schools to help them build new careers. Because of his knowledge of commercial and fine art, the Principles of the art museum convinced John Hussian to found the school in 1946.
In the early 1960s, at the suggestion of the Pennsylvania Department of Education and the Veterans Administration, the school began teaching solely commercial art. The school was incorporated in 1965, and founder Hussian retired in 1973, succeeded by longtime associate Ronald Dove, who remains president as of 2010.
Graphic art and fine art remained part of the curriculum until the early 1960s when, because of its reputation, the Pennsylvania Department of Education and the Veterans Administration suggested the school focus solely on commercial art.
The school was incorporated in 1965. John Hussian retired in 1973, turning the leadership over to a long-time associate, Ronald Dove. As a nationally accredited career school by ACCSC (Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges), the school is also active in the ICDS (International Council of Design Schools) as well as the regional professional art community. 
Since July 2010, Ronald Dove has served as Chairman of Hussian School of Art; turning the role of President over to alumni, Bruce Wartman. 
Alumni.
Alumni of the Hussian School of Art include 1950s Marvel Comics artist Joe Maneely, and his classmate George Ward, an artist for periodicals including the "Philadelphia Bulletin" and the New York "Daily News", and a 1950s assistant on Walt Kelly's comic strip "Pogo".

Battle of Wanat

The Battle of Wanat occurred on July 13, 2008, when about 200 Taliban guerrillas attacked NATO troops near the Quam,(large clan village), of Wanat in the Waygal district in Afghanistan's far eastern province of Nuristan. The position was defended primarily by United States Army soldiers of the 2nd Platoon, Chosen Company, 2nd Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment (Airborne), 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team.
The Taliban surrounded the remote base and its observation post and attacked it from the Quam and the surrounding farmland. They destroyed much of the Americans' heavy munitions, broke through U.S. lines, and entered the main base before being repelled by artillery and aircraft. American casualties included nine killed and 27 wounded, while four Afghan National Army (ANA) soldiers were wounded. The U.S. combat deaths represent the most in a single battle since the start of U.S. operations in 2001.
The Battle of Wanat has been described as the "Black Hawk Down" of the War in Afghanistan, as one of the bloodiest attacks of the war and one of several attacks on remote outposts. In contrast to previous roadside bombs and haphazard attacks and ambushes, this attack was well coordinated with fighters from many insurgent and terrorist groups with an effort that was disciplined and sustained which was able to target key assets such as the TOW launcher with precision.
The battle became the focus of widespread debate, generating "a great deal of interest and scrutiny among military professionals and from outside observers." mainly due to the relatively "significant number of coalition casualties". Several investigations were launched into events leading up to the battle. The initial investigation was completed in August 2008. In July 2009, Senator James Webb requested that the U.S. Army formally investigate the battle and previous investigation. Lieutenant General Richard F. Natonski conducted another investigation in late 2009 which led to orders of reprimand for the chain of command. In June 2010, the U.S. Army revoked the reprimands. They stated that no negligence was involved and said of the soldiers that "by their valor and their skill, they successfully defended their positions and defeated a determined, skillful, and adaptable enemy".
Background.
In 2008, NATO forces in southeastern Afghanistan deployed sub-company-sized patrols to the Pakistan border to disrupt supplies flowing to the Taliban from the Federally Administered Tribal Regions of Pakistan. They established small patrol bases, which came under regular attack by Taliban forces.
In June, a small contingent of 48 American and 24 Afghan troops, 72 in total, were operating in and around Wanat, a mountain Quam that was the center of the Waygal District government and about five miles from the coalition military base Camp Blessing. On July 4, a U.S. Army helicopter attacked and killed 17 civilians, including all of the doctors and nurses at a local clinic, infuriating local Afghans. FOB Bella was under attack, indirect fire, intel reports said that the FOB was going to be overrun from within the base as well. The helicopter attack was in response to the indirect fire received from a mortar tube that was being fired from the bed of a Toyota Hilux pick-up. The initial Taliban radio transmissions that were intercepted, reported that the "Big Gun had been hit" (mortar tube) and the commander had been killed. A few hours after the helicopter attacked, with commands and confirmation from Chosen Company commander and the troops in contact confirmed the targets, the Taliban radio reports changed to "they killed the shop keeper(that had the same name as the commander), the big gun was not damaged and all the enemy wounded and KIA were civilians. Five days before the battle, on July 8, a platoon from the Second Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment, 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team established Vehicle Patrol Base (VPB) Kahler and a separate observation post called "OP Top Side" near Wanat. 8 July, 2nd Platoon, Chosen Company, departed from Camp Blessing after sunset in a ground assault convoy for the 90 minute long drive to Wanat. The convoy contained five M1114 armored Humvees. There was one for each of the three rifle squads, a vehicle for platoon headquarters, and the last vehicle containing the TOW missile squad. The Humvees mounted heavy weapons, two with 50-cal machine guns, and two with MK-19 40mm automatic grenade launchers in protected cupolas to provide extra firepower and protection. Their goal was to create a Combat Outpost (COP) to connect with and provide security for the local populace, coordinate $1.4 million in reconstruction projects, and disrupt Taliban activity. The brigade was to be relieved by a newly arriving U.S. Army unit in two weeks.
The patrol base was situated on an open field about 300 meters long by 100 meters wide surrounded on two sides by buildings which composed the Quam. July 9, a six man engineer squad arrived by Chinook helicopter. They brought a Bobcat loader and a shipping container with engineer equipment. The soldiers reinforced the base with existing terrain, sandbags, barbed wire, and used the Bobcat to fill a number of HESCO barriers (essentially wall-sized sandbags) around the three squad positions and to create a firing pit for the big 120-mm mortar. However, the Bobcat broke down for one day, and could not lift high enough to place barriers to a 7-foot height, but were placed to just a 4-foot level, which would make it vulnerable to direct fire from guns or rockets which the attackers would exploit. The troops dug many of the fortifications and trenches with hand shovels. Still in preparation at the time of the attack, some areas were only protected by a barrier of concertina wire, but with no posts or stakes, the wire was just placed on the ground.
The Afghan company contracted to bring heavy construction equipment delayed its arrival to until 13 July. It was decided that soldier labor with the aid of an engineer squad and a Bobcat front end loader already at Bella would be good enough to prepare an initial defense in the six days until heavier equipment arrived. The number of men at the base was judged enough to defend against intelligence estimates that placed the insurgent forces in the local area at only about 150 experienced fighters, though they did not know that attackers would be backed up by Al Qaeda and other guerrilla groups from neighboring regions as far away as Pakistan and Kashmir. While they thought it was possible the base might be attacked while the camp was being prepared, they thought it unlikely. Platoon Sergeant Dzwik later remarked "I was expecting harassing fire from any one of the high ground in every direction. I did not think the village itself would let the AAF Force turn their village into a battle zone.
Soldiers at the base noticed warning signs, including groups of men watching the construction from the nearby village, which was set at a higher elevation than the outpost, and other groups of men moving through nearby mountains. At a dinner meeting in the village, a villager told the Americans that they should shoot any men seen in the mountains, and asked them if U.S. UAVs were keeping watch nearby. The day before the attack, the militants began flowing water through an irrigation ditch feeding an unused field, creating background noise that masked the sounds of the advancing fighters.
Although the Americans believed that 100 or 200 attacked the base, a senior Afghan defense ministry official who did not reveal his name told Al Jazeera that he had information it was between 400 and 500 fighters. Tamim Nuristani, former governor of Nuristan, believed that numerous Taliban and Pakistani militant and terrorist groups banded together from surrounding regions including Kunar and the Bajaur tribal agency in neighboring Pakistan. Participating groups included Taliban, al-Qaeda, Kashmir-based Lashkar-e-Taiba and Pakistan-based,(as of 2013 still located in 1 of many strongholds in the Bajaur agency of F.A.T.A.-Federally administered Tribal areas in Kunar and Nuristan of Afghanistan), Hezb-i-Islami. Al Qaeda's senior leadership, including Osama bin Laden and Ayman al Zawahiri, were thought, by most intelligence analysts, to shelter in the region. Taliban spokesman stated "The fighting in Afghanistan is getting heavier. When the Americans drop bombs on civilians ordinary people want revenge - that's why they are joining the Taliban, strengthening us" pointing out their "ability to enter the bases and kill Americans." A NATO spokesman believed that the Taliban had moved into and expelled a nearby Khel,(small village-tribe subdivision), for the attack. On the evening of July 12, Taliban soldiers moved into Wanat and ordered the villagers to leave. Undetected by the I.S.A.F./A.N.S.F. soldiers, they set up firing positions inside Kors and a mosque next to and overlooking the perimeter.
The battle.
About 4:20 a.m. on July 13, Taliban forces opened fire on the base with machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades, and mortars. Another 100 militants attacked the observation post from farmland to the east.
The initial attack hit the forward operating base's mortar pit, knocking out the 120mm mortar and detonating the stockpile of mortar ammunition. The insurgents next destroyed the Humvee-mounted TOW missile launcher inside the combat outpost with coordinated fire from unguided RPG rockets. The mortars and TOW launcher which were to provide the heaviest and most accurate firepower had been quickly taken out by the attackers. The explosion of the mortar shells hurled the anti-tank missiles into the command post.
The most serious situation was the attack concentrated on a small team situated at the small observation post "TOPSIDE" nestled among rocks under a tree just 50 to 70 meters outside of the main base. The first round of fire hit with deadly accuracy, immediately wounding or stunning every soldier. Pfc. Tyler Stafford was blown out of his machine-gun position next to Spc. Matthew Phillips who threw a grenade before he was mortally wounded. Cpl. Jason Bogar fired hundreds of rounds from his automatic weapon until the barrel of his weapon became white-hot and jammed and then tended to Stafford’s wounds. An RPG wounded Sgt. Ryan Pitts, who was also tended by Bogar with a tourniquet around Pitts’ leg before switching to another gun. Bogar then jumped from the outpost bunker to get close enough to kill insurgents who were firing down upon the men from the village hotel. Once outside the bunker, he was shot through the chest and killed.
Four died within the first 20 minutes of the battle, another died later, and at least three others were wounded. Three times teams of soldiers from the main base ran through Taliban fire to resupply the observation post and carry back the dead and wounded.
The U.S. troops responded with machine guns, grenades, and claymore mines. Artillery guns at Camp Blessing fired 96 155mm artillery rounds. The Taliban briefly breached the wire of the observation post before being driven back. After almost half an hour of intense fighting at the observation post, only one soldier remained. He was seriously wounded and fought alone until reinforcements arrived. Some militants also managed to get past the main base's earthen barriers. Two American soldiers, platoon leader First Lieutenant Jonathan P. Brostrom, 24, of Hawaii and Corporal Jason Hovater, were killed trying to deliver ammunition to the observation post. American soldiers were at times flushed out of their fortifications by what they thought were grenades, but which were actually rocks thrown by the attackers. Brostrom, Hovater, and another soldier may have been killed by an insurgent who penetrated the wire perimeter.
AH-64 Apache attack helicopters and a Predator unmanned aircraft drone armed with Hellfire missiles arrived over the base about 30 minutes after the battle began. During the battle, troops were resupplied by UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter with fire support from the AH-64 Apache Helicopters. Injured troops were evacuated to nearby Camp Wright, where members of E Troop, 2nd-17th Cavalry, 101st Airborne Division would wait to rearm and refuel the UH-60's and AH-64's. Later, a B-1B Lancer bomber, A-10, and F-15E Strike Eagle aircraft were called in. The militants withdrew about four hours later. After the militants retreated, mop up operations followed, and the Taliban withdrew from the town.
Nine U.S. soldiers were killed in the attack, mainly in the observation post. Between 21 and 52 militants were reported killed with another 20 to 40 wounded, but coalition forces found only two Taliban bodies after the battle. The attack was the highest death toll for American troops in the country since Operation Red Wings three years earlier.
Operational issues.
Civilian deaths caused by allied operations had increased sympathy among Waygal residents for the Taliban, who were allowed to move into the Quam. The residents may have been further dismayed by the failure of the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, to address the concerns of a delegation of elders and maliks in Kabul two days previously.
Coalition troops had noticed other warning signs. The day before the attack, the "Spin Giris", (Influential,tribal elders), of Wanat conducted a Jirga, (Elder Community Council-Experienced male members of the Quam have a right to attend), without the post's Officer-in-Charge. As well, the villagers began pouring waste water into an area of dead space near the post more frequently, which may have concealed the movement of militants within the village.
A 2009 US Army report criticized the brigade commander, COL Chip Preysler, and the battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel William Ostlund, citing the lack of supplies, equipment, and drinking water for troops stationed in Wanat. At the same time, the report noted the incredible performance of the unit under fire.
The same report criticized the actions of the involved commanding officers as being counterproductive to military goals, stating that "The highly kinetic approach favored by TF Rock...rapidly and inevitably degraded the relationships between the US Army and the Waigal population."
This statement, portraying the operational approaches of the 173rd Airborne Brigade (TF Bayonet) and 2-503 PIR (TF Rock) in a negative light, is contradicted by David Kilcullen in his book, "The Accidental Guerrilla". Kilcullen stated that in March 2008,
The fact that Kunar has bucked the general trend trend in security across the country seems largely to be the result of a consistent U.S. strategy of partnering with local communities to separate the insurgents from the people, bring tangible benefits of governance and development to the population, and help the population choose their own local Khan's(Protectors,usually military), through elections.
Kilcullen also noted a statement by a previous U.S. commander in Kunar regarding LTC William Ostlund, the 2-503 commander: "Bill O. understood deeply that the effect of Coalition operations "on the people" was the key question."
Aftermath.
U.S. withdrawal.
After the battle, Major General Jeffrey J. Schloesser, U.S. Army commander of coalition troops in Regional Command East, Afghanistan, decided to abandon the patrol base and sent additional U.S. troops to assist the base evacuation. Three days after the engagement the United States and Afghan armies withdrew from Wanat. An ISAF statement says ISAF and Afghan security forces "will continue to perform regular patrols near the village of Wanat." The coalition forces continued to maintain a larger patrol base about four miles away from Wanat and concentrated on protecting the larger Pech River Valley.
The district police force for the area was disarmed by the Americans and the district chief and police chief were briefly detained and questioned. Both were released within 24 hours according to a spokesperson for the district chief.
Speaking at a Pentagon news conference after the attack, U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Navy Admiral Mike Mullen said the incident indicated that "all involved with operations on the (Pakistan-Afghanistan,Especially the pourous Kunar,Kashmir,and Nuristan), border must do a better job of policing the region and eliminating the extremists’ safe havens in Pakistan's federally administered tribal areas that are launching pads for attacks on coalition forces." The Associated Press reported that the attack underscored a general gain in strength of Afghan militants.
However, the 173rd Brigade Commander, Colonel Charles Preysler, specifically rebutted that conclusion in an interview on July 20, 2008. He stated that previous media accounts of the engagement mischaracterized the level of development of the platoon's defences. He also said that the withdrawal of the platoon did not constitute "abandoning" the position because no permanent defensive infrastructure was developed or left behind. He further stated that the position was "not overrun in any shape, manner, or form", adding that, "It was close combat to be sure — hand grenade range."
U.S. Army investigation.
An investigation by the U.S. Army, completed on August 13 and released to the public the first week of November 2008, found that the Taliban attackers had been assisted by the Afghan local police,(A.L.P.), forces and a district leader. The evidence included large stocks of weapons and ammunition discovered in the police barracks in Wanat after the battle. The stocks were much more than could be used by the villages' 20-man police force and included dirty weapons which appeared to have been used recently. In response to the report, Schloesser concluded that the governor and local police chief "had probably been acting under duress and had been cooperative with American troops." The governor was absolved of blame in the attack but it was unclear about what was done with the local police chief.
The investigation also examined whether the Army had intelligence about a possible assault and whether the troops had access to it. The report found that despite reports earlier in July that 200 to 300 militants had been massing to attack another remote outpost in the vicinity, including numerous reports from local villagers that an attack was imminent, the commanders at Wanat had no reason to expect such a large frontal assault. The report, however, criticized the “incredible amount of time” — 10 months — it took NATO military leaders to negotiate arrangements over the site of the outpost, giving the Taliban plenty of time to coordinate and plan an attack on the base.
Further actions.
In July 2009, U.S. Senator James Webb asked the U.S. DoD Inspector General to formally examine the battle and the U.S. Army's investigation into the event. In his request, Webb cited an unreleased report from the Army's Combat Studies Institute by a contractor, Douglas Cubbison, that criticized how senior Army leaders in Afghanistan, especially Ostlund and Preyser, acted before the assault at Wanat. According to that report, soldiers at the Wanat base were critically short of basic necessities such as water and sandbags and had complained repeatedly, to no avail, that their base was in a precarious position. Cubbison had written the report at the request of Lieutenant General William B. Caldwell IV, commander of the United States Army Combined Arms Center. Cubbison wrote that a few days before the battle, on July 4, a U.S. Army helicopter mistakenly attacked and killed 17 civilians, including all of the doctors and nurses at a local clinic, infuriating local Afghans. Platoon leader Brostrom and company commander Captain Matthew Myer told their commanders that they expected a retaliatory attack and asked for extra surveillance. Brostrom's father, retired Army Colonel David. P. Brostrom, alerted Webb's office to the Army historian's report. Said Brostrom, "After I read the report, I was sick to my stomach."
Letters of reprimand were issued to Colonel Charles Preysler, Lieutenant Colonel William Ostlund and Captain Myer for "failing to properly prepare defenses" at Wanat, Pentagon officials said March 12.
That same month, Myer was awarded the Silver Star for his actions during the battle of Wanat.
On September 30, 2009, U.S. Central Command commander General David H. Petraeus appointed United States Marine Corps Lieutenant General Richard F. Natonski to lead a new inquiry into the battle and which would look into related issues "beyond the tactical level." A later review was conducted by General Charles C. Campbell which "focused on the totality of circumstances that included and affected actions at Wanat", including interviews of the officers involved, and reviews of previous investigations with the exception of the Fort Leavenworth Combat Studies Institute (CSI) narrative—stating that it had "not undergone pre-publication vetting and academic review in accordance with standing CSI research protocols". Campbell concluded that the officers involved were not at fault:
officers were neither negligent nor derelict in the performance of their duties, exercising a degree of care that a reasonably prudent person would have exercised under the same or similar circumstance. To criminalize command decisions in a theater of complex combat operations is a grave step indeed. It is also unnecessary, particularly in this case. It is possible for officers to err in judgment—and to thereby incur censure—without violating a criminal statute. This is particularly true where the errors are those of omission, where the standards come from multiple non-punitive doctrinal publications, where there is less than complete and certain knowledge of enemy capabilities and intent, and where commanders enjoy wide discretion in their exercise of their command prerogatives and responsibilities.
In June 2010, General Campbell revoked the officers' reprimands, citing that they would have a "chilling effect" on ground operations. The Army said that the second look at the incident proved that the officers were "neither negligent nor derelict" and "by their valor and their skill, they successfully defended their positions and defeated a determined, skillful, and adaptable enemy who masses and attacks at times, ways and places of his choosing" Secretary of the Army John McHugh was also humbled by their courage, stating "We remain grateful for and humbled by their extraordinary courage and valor."
Gen. George W. Casey Jr., Army chief of staff further commended the performance of the soldiers:
In every review and study conducted to date, the courage, valor, and discipline of the soldiers who fought at Wanat have been universally praised. These soldiers were well-trained, well-led, and fought bravely to defeat a determined and intense enemy action to overrun their base in Wanat. They persevered in a fashion that deserves broad recognition of their bravery and tenacity. Our hearts go out to the families of the fallen soldiers.
Upset over Campbell's decision, family members of those killed in action wrote a letter to the Secretary of the Army asking that the findings of Natonski's investigation be upheld and the reprimands reinstated. In addition to the family members, the letter was signed by Senators Daniel Akaka, Jim Webb, Saxby Chambliss, Patty Murray, and Claire McCaskill.
In November 2010, the U.S. Army's Combat Studies Institute published a historical account of the Battle of Wanat. The official U.S. Army history of the battle, published in December 2010, places little blame on the senior officers involved, instead blaming the uncertain nature of war, mistakes by junior officers, lack of knowledge by Army officers on the Wanat region's complex political situation, and lack of intelligence that the attack forces would be drawn from the entire region, not just the local area.

USS Venetia (SP-431)

USS "Venetia" (SP-431) was a large 589 gross ton steam yacht leased by the U.S. Navy during World War I. She was heavily armed with for guns and depth charges, and was assigned duties of a patrol craft, escorting ships in convoy on the North Atlantic Ocean, and protecting those ships from German submarine attack. "Venetia" was awarded a "star of reward" for her antisubmarine work, and mounted the star on her stack. Post-war she was restored to her original civilian configuration, and was returned to her owner.
A yacht built in Scotland.
"Venetia" -- a single-screw, steel-hulled steam yacht built in 1904 at Leith, Scotland, by Hawthorne and Commpany to plans drawn up by the designers Cox and King—was acquired by the U.S. Navy on 4 August 1917 from industrialist John Diedrich Spreckles for use as a patrol craft. Designated SP-431 and fitted out at the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California, "Venetia" was commissioned at Mare Island on 15 October 1917, Comdr. Lewis B. Porterfield in command.
World War I service.
Transit to the Atlantic Ocean.
The converted yacht departed Mare Island on 23 October, transited the Panama Canal on 6 November, and reached Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 15 November. The ship underwent alterations at the Philadelphia Navy Yard -- including the installation of new radio equipment—before she sailed for New York City on 3 December. Following minor repairs at the New York Navy Yard from 4 to 15 December, "Venetia" returned to Philadelphia.
First transatlantic passage.
Four days before Christmas, "Venetia" sailed for European waters with "SC-67" (allocated to the French Navy) in tow and in company with the converted yacht which, in turn, had the French "SC-173" in tow. The next day, they rendezvoused with , , and off the Delaware Bay breakwater and headed for Bermuda where they arrived on the 26th and remained into the new year, 1918. 
The group got underway on the next leg of the transatlantic passage on 7 January and reached the Azores on the 23d. "Venetia" subsequently spent five days at sea, searching for a French subchaser ("SC-319") which had been separated from the convoy. The yacht eventually departed Ponta Delgada on 8 February in company with and -- each ship towing a French subchaser. Arriving at Port Leixos, Portugal, on the 13th, "Venetia" got underway again five days later, with the French "SC-172" in tow, and arrived at Gibraltar on the 18th.
While undergoing voyage repairs, "Venetia" received a new depth charge rack and releasing gear. Thus outfitted, "Venetia" sailed on 2 March 1918 in the screen for a 28-ship convoy, bound for Bizerte, Tunisia. Other escorts sharing the mission included , , and the French trawler "Isole". Six days later, "Venetia" got underway back toward Gibraltar, escorting eight vessels, and returned to her home port on 12 March. Based at Gibraltar, the ship performed similar convoy escort missions in the Mediterranean for the duration of hostilities.
Attacking German submarine "UB-52".
Her first contact with the enemy came that spring. On 11 May 1918, "Venetia" was steaming off the port quarter of a convoy bound for Gibraltar, when a torpedo streaked past her bow, some 150 to ahead. Lookouts on the armed yacht then sighted "a large amount of water" spouting into the air over the bow of "SS Susette Fraisinette", a French steamship about away. The merchantman had been torpedoed by "UB-52" and later sank at 0412. While the French trawler "Isole" picked up 34 survivors from "Susette Fraisinette", "Venetia" cruised in widening circles until 0520, carrying out a sector search for the offending U-boat. At 0527, the yacht's maintop lookout sighted "UB-52" eight or nine miles (14 km) away, standing well off the convoy's track and on a course between west and southwest.
"Venetia", at general quarters, headed for "UB-52" at full speed, keeping the submarine bearing one point to starboard, at intervals, as the submarine continued standing off to westward. Soon, the yacht gained perceptibility, and the U-boat came into better view. Her periscopes were down, and lookouts in the yacht noted that the enemy submersible mounted a single gun (a weapon) forward of the small conning tower. The fact that the German's bow seemed "unusually high" out of the water—coupled with the fact that there was "no perceptible bow-wave" -- led Comdr. Porterfield to hope that either the enemy's diving apparatus was disabled ". . . or that he decided to shoot it out."
As "Venetia" bore down on "UB-52", Porterfield laid out his battle plan: keep the U-boat one point on the starboard bow, open up with gunfire at about , machine guns at 2,000, "and finish by ramming him at full speed." Unfortunately, the U-boat's commander, Oberleutnant zur See Launburg, saw "Venetia's" approach and ordered his ship to dive. Porter-field took "Venetia" over where the U-boat had just "pulled the plug" and initiated a search. "Venetia" steamed in the vicinity, within a five-mile (8 km) circle, probing until 0738. During that time, she dropped 13 depth bombs and subsequently set a course to keep the enemy from making further attacks on the convoy.
Twelve days later, "UB-52" met her doom in the Adriatic at the hands of the British submarine HMS "H-4". Survivors from the U-boat reported that "Venetia's" efforts had not only prevented further attacks on the convoy but had driven "UB-52" off. Since Porterfield's action in doggedly pursuing the U-boat had aided substantially in saving the convoy, he received commendations from the British Senior Naval Officer, Gibraltar; from Commander in Chief, Mediterranean; and from the American Patrol Force commander, Rear Admiral Wilson.
Attacking German submarine "UB-39".
Back at sea with a convoy outward bound from Gibraltar soon thereafter, "Venetia's" next encounter with the enemy came within a week of her brush with "UB-52". Just before nightfall on 17 May, the armed yacht was steaming on an irregular zig-zag pattern when the British steamship SS "Sculptor" took a torpedo from "UB-39". "Venetia", two and one-half to three points abaft the beam of the stricken merchantman and away, simultaneously sounded general quarters and rang down emergency full speed ahead.
As the yacht passed astern of "Sculptor", Porterfield assumed that, after making her attack, the submarine had turned aft on the starboard side of the convoy. "Venetia" consequently dropped 300-pound depth charges set at depth, between 1901 and 1902. At that point, the yacht's foretop lookout reported that he could see the wake of a submarine moving through the water. Ensign Willis L. DeCamp took station in the foretop and confirmed the lookout's report.
"Venetia" altered course and dropped depth charges ahead of the wake at 1906, 1908, 1909, 1911, and 1913. Meanwhile "Surveyor" stood by the damaged merchantman, and Venetia radioed Oran to send a tug. (Gunboat No. 14) assisted in the attack, dropping seven depth charges; "Venetia" subsequently stood by "Sculptor" with orders to get her underway, if possible, in tow, and circled the crippled ship at 12 knots (22 km/h). By this time, British trawler "Corvi", French trawler "Isole", and French subchasers "SC-171" and "SC-350" picked up survivors and were standing by. "Venetia" then ordered "Isole" to rejoin the convoy.
However, the escorts were not nearly as successful driving away the attacker this time. Twice more, "U-39" closed the convoy, sinking British steamer SS "Mavisbrook" at 2028 and then damaging SS "Elswick Grange" at 2320. The latter eventually reached port under tow.
Searching for another attacking U-boat.
"Venetia's" next encounter with the enemy came less than two months later. On 20 July, the warship departed Gibraltar, bound for Genoa, Italy, as part of the screen for a convoy of 17 ships. Her fellow escorts were British trawler "Kodama", British sloop "Narcissus", Italian trawler "Porto Torres", and American converted yacht .
Three days into the voyage, an enemy submarine, lurking nearby, torpedoed the British merchantman "SS Messidor" at 1924. At that time, "Venetia" was steaming at 11 knots (20 km/h) some astern and was zigzagging to starboard of the convoy. Hearing the explosion, "Venetia" went to full speed and headed toward the front of the convoy. Between 1926 and 2000, she searched for the U-boat and dropped two British and 11 American depth charges. During that time, the ship once sighted a suspicious wake on the starboard bow. "Venetia" came hard right but, upon investigation, decided that the wake had not been made by either a submarine or a torpedo.
While the yacht continued searching for the submarine, she kept within sight of the sinking "Messidor" which her crewmen could see plainly in the moonlight. At 2025, the patrol craft passed within hailing distance of "Kodama" which was busy picking up survivors, asking for a count on the survivors and the missing. "Kodama" replied that she had not finished counting; after telling the trawler to steam in a circle and continue counting until totals had been reached, "Venetia" continued the search for the U-boat.
"Venetia" neared "Kodama" again shortly under an hour later, and ascertained the count of survivors to be 33, with one man missing. Porterfield—not at all certain that "Messidor" would sink—wondered if he should not retain "Messidor's" officers to accompany the steamer to port in case she could be towed in. He prepared a wireless message to Algiers asking for a tug and escort to either Algiers or Bougie, and stating that he would stand by "Messidor" until 0500 the next morning. However, all of his speculations were soon rendered academic, as "Messidor" began listing rapidly to starboard at 2230. Ten minutes later, the freighter rolled over and sank. "Venetia" then headed northward to catch up with the convoy and joined at 0746 on 24 July; two days later, the convoy arrived at Genoa without further incident.
Continued convoy escort duty.
"Venetia" returned to Gibraltar with a 20-ship convoy on 1 August after an uneventful passage. The next day, Comdr. Porterfield was relieved by Capt. C. F. Howell, USCG, as commanding officer. On the 16th of that month, the armed yacht began a refit and overhaul at Gibraltar, entering drydock on the 26th for hull repairs. "Venetia" put to sea on 14 September with an 11-ship convoy and arrived at Genoa six days later. She returned to her home base on 26 September, convoying 19 ships safely to port.
"Venetia" subsequently conducted two more round-trip convoy escort voyages—one to Genoa and one to Bizerte -- before she departed Gibraltar on 6 November, bound for Madeira, in company with "Surveyor". The ships arrived at Funchal, Madeira, on the 9th, and "Venetia" departed on the 11th, the day that the armistice was signed at Compiègne, France, ending World War I. The armed yacht made arrival at Ponta Delgada, in the Azores, on the 13th, en route to Gibraltar, which she reached on the 19th.
Post-war operations.
During her last month in European waters, "Venetia" made a round-trip voyage to Portugal before sailing for the United States on 21 December, towing "SC-223", as part of a homeward-bound subchaser detachment built around the tender "Hannibal". Later towing "SC-330", the yacht reached Ponta Delgada on the day after Christmas. Subsequently touching at St. Thomas, Virgin Islands; Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic; and Port-au-Prince, Haiti, "Venetia" arrived at Guantanamo Bay on 31 January 1919. 
Post-war disposition.
She transited the Panama Canal on 3 February and reached San Francisco on the 20th. One week later, on 27 February 1919, "Venetia" shifted to the Mare Island Navy Yard where she was decommissioned, and all of her military fittings were removed. She was returned to her owner on 4 April 1919.
Continued maritime service.
"Venetia" remained under the ownership of the entrepreneur John D. Spreckles until his death in June 1926. The graceful yacht was then sold to James Playfair, who owned the ship from 1928 to 1939. The ownership of the erstwhile convoy escort and patrol craft changed hands again in 1940, when R. S. Misener acquired the ship. After some 65 years in operation—the latter years on the Great Lakes --she disappeared from the Lloyd's Register of Yachts in 1968.

<doc id="18424177" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18424177" title="Wavelength selective switching">
Wavelength selective switching

Wavelength Selective Switching components are used in WDM optical communications networks to route (switch) signals between optical fibres on a per-wavelength basis.
What is a WSS.
A WSS comprises a switching array that operates on light that has been dispersed in wavelength without the requirement that the dispersed light be physically demultiplexed into separate ports. This is termed a ‘disperse and switch’ configuration. For example an 88 channel WDM system can be routed from a “common” fiber to any one of N fibers by employing 88 1 x N switches. This represents a significant simplification of a demux and switch and multiplex architecture that would require (in addition to N +1 mux/demux elements) a non-blocking switch for 88 N x N channels which would test severely the manufacturability limits of large-scale optical cross-connects for even moderate fiber counts.
A more practical approach, and one adopted by the majority of WSS manufacturers is shown schematically in Figure 1 "(to be uploaded)". The various incoming channels of a common port are dispersed continuously onto a switching element which then directs and attenuates each of these channels independently to the N switch ports. The dispersive mechanism is generally based on holographic or ruled diffraction gratings similar to those used commonly in spectrometers. It can be advantageous, for achieving resolution and coupling efficiency, to employ a combination of a grating and a reflective or transmissive grating – known as a GRISM. The operation of the WSS can be bidirectional so the wavelengths can be multiplexed together from different ports onto a single common port. To date, the majority of deployments have used a fixed channel bandwidth of 50 or 100 GHz and 9 output ports are typically used!
Microelectromechanical Mirrors (MEMS).
The simplest and earliest commercial WSS were based on movable mirrors using Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS). A schematic of a MEMS-based WSS is shown in Figure 2 "(to be uploaded)". The incoming light is broken into a spectrum by a diffraction grating (shown at RHS of Figure) and each wavelength channel then focuses on a separate MEMS mirror. By tilting the mirror in one dimension, the channel can be directed back into any of the fibers in the array. A second tilting axis allows transient crosstalk to be minimised, otherwise switching (eg) from port 1 to port 3 will always involve passing the beam across port 2. The second axis provides a means to attenuate the signal without increasing the coupling into neighbouring fibers. 
This technology has the advantage of a single steering surface, not necessarily requiring polarization diversity optics. It works well in the presence of a continuous signal, allowing the mirror tracking circuits to dither the mirror and maximise coupling.
MEMS based WSS typically produce good extinction ratios, but poor open loop performance for setting a given attenuation level. The main limitations of the technology arise from the channelization that the mirrors naturally enforce. During manufacturing, the channels must be carefully aligned with the mirrors, complicating the manufacturing process. Post-manufacturing alignment adjustments have been mainly limited to adjusting the gas pressure within the hermetic enclosure. This enforced channelization has also proved, so far, an insurmountable obstacle to implementing flexible channel plans where different channel sizes are required within a network. Additionally the phase of light at the mirror edge is not well controlled in a physical mirror so artefacts can arise in the switching of light near the channel edge due to interference of the light from each channel.
Binary Liquid Crystal (LC).
Liquid crystal switching avoids both the high cost of small volume MEMS fabrication and potentially some of its fixed channel limitations. The concept is illustrated in Figure 3 "(to be uploaded)". A diffraction grating breaks the incoming light into a spectrum. A software controlled binary liquid crystal stack, individually tilts each optical channel and a second grating (or a second pass of the first grating) is used to spectrally recombine the beams. The offsets created by the liquid crystal stack cause the resulting spectrally recombined beams to be spatially offset, and hence to focus, through a lens array, into separate fibers. Polarization diversity optics ensures low Polarization Dependent Losses (PDL).
This technology has the advantages of relatively low cost parts, simple electronic control and stable beam positions without active feedback. It is capable of configuring to a flexible grid spectrum by the use of a fine pixel grid. The inter-pixel gaps must be small compared to the beam size, to avoid perturbing the transmitted light significantly. Furthermore each grid must be replicated for each of the switching stages creating the requirement of individually controlling thousands of pixels on different substrates so the advantages of this technology in terms of simplicity are negated as the wavelength resolution becomes finer.
The main disadvantage of this technology arises from the thickness of the stacked switching elements. Keeping the optical beam tightly focused over this depth is difficult and has, so far, limited the ability of high port count WSS to achieve very fine (12.5 GHz or less) granularity.
Liquid Crystal on Silicon (LCoS).
Liquid Crystal on Silicon LCoS is particularly attractive as a switching mechanism in a WSS because of the near continuous addressing capability, enabling much new functionality. In particular the bands of wavelengths which are switched together (channels) need not be preconfigured in the optical hardware but can be programmed into the switch through the software control. Additionally, it is possible to take advantage of this ability to reconfigure channels while the device is operating. A schematic of an LCoS WSS is shown in Figure 4 "(to be uploaded)".
LCoS technology has enabled the introduction of more flexible wavelength grids which help to unlock the full spectral capacity of optical fibers. Even more surprising features rely on the phase matrix nature of the LCoS switching element. Features in common use include such things as shaping the power levels within a channel or broadcasting the optical signal to more than one port.
LCoS-based WSS also permit dynamic control of channel centre frequency and bandwidth through on-the-fly modification of the pixel arrays via embedded software. The degree of control of channel parameters can be very fine-grained, with independent control of the centre frequency and either upper- or lower-band-edge of a channel with better than 1 GHz resolution possible. This is advantageous from a manufacturability perspective, with different channel plans being able to be created from a single platform and even different operating bands (such as C and L) being able to use an identical switch matrix. Products have been introduced allowing switching between 50 GHz channels and 100 GHz channels, or a mix of channels, without introducing any errors or “hits” to the existing traffic. More recently, this has been extended to support the whole concept of Flexible or Elastic networks under ITU G.654.2 through products such as Finisar's Flexgrid™ WSS.
For more detailed information on the applications of LCoS in telecommunications and, in particular, Wavelength Selective Switches, see chapter 16 in Optical Fiber Telecommunications VIA, edited by Kaminov, Li and Wilner, Academic Press ISBN 978-0-12-396958-3.
MEMS Arrays.
A further array-based switch engine uses an array of individual reflective MEMS mirrors to perform the necessary beam steering (Figure 5 "(to be uploaded)". These arrays are typically a derivative of the Texas Instruments [Digital_Light_Processing range of spatial light modulators. In this case, the angle of the MEMs mirrors is changed to deflect the beam. However, current implementations only allow the mirrors to have two possible states, giving two potential beam angles. This complicates the design of multi-port WSS and has limited their application to relatively low-port-count devices.
Future Developments.
Dual WSS.
It is likely that in future two WSS could use the same optical module utilizing different wavelength processing regions of a single matrix switch such as LCoS, provided that the issues associated with device isolation are able to be appropriately addressed. Channel selectivity ensures only wavelengths required to be dropped locally (up to the maximum number of transceivers in the bank) are presented to any mux/demux module through each fiber, which in turn reduces the filtering and extinction requirements on the mux/demux module.
Advanced Spatial Light Modulators.
The technical maturity of spatial light modulators based on consumer driven applications has been highly advantageous to their adoption in the telecommunications arena. There are developments in MEMs phased arrays and other electro-optic spatial light modulators that could be envisaged in the future to be applicable to telecom switching and wavelength processing, perhaps bringing faster switching or having an advantage in simplicity of optical design through polarisation-independent operation. For example, the design principles developed for LCoS could be applied to other phase-controllable arrays in a straightforward fashion if a suitable phase stroke (greater than 2π at 1550 nm) can be achieved. However the requirements for low electrical crosstalk and high fill factor over very small pixels required to allow switching in a compact form factor remain serious practical impediments to achieving these goals.

Wayne County Courthouse District

The Wayne County Courthouse is located in Wooster, Ohio and was constructed to Thomas Boyd's design from 1877-1879. The building is designed in classic Second Empire style and is composed of sandstone. The architect originally designed a symmetrical building separate from the old north annex of the previous courthouse. The reluctant county officials cited money issues and ordered the new building to be built connected to the old, thus giving it an offset appearance.
The entrances are flanked by the Atlantes supporting a pediment. The first floor consists of smooth stone blocks. The windows are high arched and set back into the wall, above each is a small arch with a decorative keystone.
The second and third floor is of a rougher, darker stone than the first. Doric and Corinthian columns flank the windows around the facade. The second floor windows are high arched and recessed. Here the buildings on either side of the tower differ, the northern half ending with a hipped roof, the southern half continuing on above.
The third floor of the southern end contains rectangular recessed windows, the roof resting on a decorative moulding above. On the southern side sits a broken pediment with a griffin peering out below. Resting on the pediment are two figures representing Justice, one holding the scales of justice, the other the Ten Commandments. The windows peeking out of the roof are round portholes. 
A high tower sits, oddly enough, at the end of the roofing detail, but correctly in the middle of the court complex. It rests on a broken pediment containing an urn. The tower rises two levels to become a clock tower, and then curves in to brace a cupola with a weather vane capping it.

Cherubikon

The Cherubikon (Gr. χερουβικὸν), Cherubic Hymn (Gr. χερουβικὸς ὕμνος) or Chant (Old Church Sl. ), is the troparion normally sung at the Great Entrance during the Byzantine liturgy. The hymn is sung in the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Eastern Catholic Churches. 
Text.
The hymn symbolically incorporates those present at the liturgy into the presence of the angels gathered around God's throne. It concerns the very heart of the Divine Liturgy—the Anaphora, the earliest part which can be traced back to Saint Basil and to John Chrysostom's redaction of Basil's liturgical text.
Exegetic tradition.
The trisagion or thrice-holy hymn which was mentioned by John Chrysostom, could only refer to the Sanctus of the Anaphora taken from the Old Testament, from the book of the prophet Isaiah in particular (6:1-3):
And it came to pass in the year in which king Ozias died, that I saw the Lord sitting on a high and exalted throne, and the house was full of his glory. [2 And seraphs stood round about him, each one had six wings, and with two they covered their face, and with two they covered their feet, and with two they flew. And one cried to the other, and they said "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts! The whole earth is full of His glory!"
In a homily John Chrysostom interpreted Isaiah and the chant of the divine liturgy as an analogue act which connected the community with the eternal angelic choirs: 
While the legions of angels praise above, down the human congregations sing the very same hymn. Above the seraphim jubilate the thrice-holy hymn, from deep down the human crowd raise with the same hymn into a solemn communion of the heavenly with the earthly spheres—a eucharist, one cheerfullness, one acclaim.
The reform of the 6th century.
The liturgical concept already existed by the end of the 4th century. 200 years later, the Great Entrance as a simple ritual act was needed for a procession with the Gifts and simultaneous prayers behind the choir screen. It had to bridge the long way between prothesis and the altar which had been separated by changes in sacred architecture under Emperor Justin II. The cherubikon was divided into several parts. The first is sung by the congregation before the celebrant begins his prayers, there were one or two simultaneous parts, and they all followed like a gradual ascent in different steps within the Great Entrance: 
καὶ τῇ ζωοποιῷ Τριάδι τὸν Τρισάγιον ὕμνον προσάδοντες,
Ὡς τὸν Βασιλέα τῶν ὅλων ὑποδεξόμενοι,
Ἀλληλούϊα, Ἀλληλούϊα, Ἀλληλούϊα.

The troparion begins as a solemn hymn, and during the 6th century "trisagion hymnon" could also refer to the troparion or refrain of the third antiphon, sung at the beginning of the catechumenoi part. Today it is sung as an own ordinary mass chant after the Small Entrance. Both chants, the trisagion as well as the cherubikon, have the Sanctus as main point of reference.
History.
The cherubikon was added as a troparion to the Divine Liturgy by the Emperor Justin II (565 - 578), when a separation of the rooms, where the gifts were prepared and consecrated, made it necessary, that the eucharist part, also known as the part of the baptised during which the others had been excluded, started with a procession (similar to the procession accompanied by the chant genre offertory in traditions of Western plainchant). This procession was known as the "Great Entrance", because the celebrants had to enter the choir by the choir screen, later replaced by the iconostasis. 
The cherubikon belongs to the ordinary mass chant, because it has to be sung during the year cycle, however, it was sometimes substituted by other troparia, the so-called "anti-cherouvika". On Holy Thursday, for example, the cherubikon was, and still is replaced by the troparion ""At your mystical supper"" (Τοῦ δείπνου σου τοῦ μυστικοῦ), while during the Liturgy of the Presanctified the troparion ""Now the powers of the heavens"" (Νῦν αἱ δυνάμεις τῶν οὐρανῶν) was sung, and the celebration of "Prote Anastasis" (Holy Saturday) uses the troparion from the Liturgy of St. James, ""Let All Mortal Flesh Keep Silence"" (Σιγησάτω πᾶσα σὰρξ βροτεία). The latter troparion is also used occasionally at the consecration of a church.
The Latin cherubikon of the "Missa greca".
In the history of Byzantine music manuscripts the cherubikon appears quite late in liturgical manuscripts with musical notation, not before the late 12th century, while the earliest sources are of Carolingian origin—sacramentaries with a so-called "Missa greca" like a Hadrianum written in Korvey (near Aachen). The transliterated cherubikon in the center like the main parts of the Missa greca were written with paleofrankish neumes between the text lines. Paleofrankish neumes are adiastematic and no manuscripts with the Latin cherubikon have survived in diastematic neumes. Nevertheless, it is supposed to be a melos of an E mode like the earliest Byzantine cherubika which have the main intonation of echos plagios deuteros. 
In this particular copy of the Hadrianum the "Missa greca" was obviously intended for Pentecost, because the cherubikon was classified as offertory and followed by the Greek Sanctus, the convention of the divine liturgy, and finally by the communio "Factus est repente", the proper chant of Pentecost. Other manuscripts belonged to the Abbey Saint-Denis, where the Missa greca was celebrated during Pentecost and in honour of the patron within the festal week (octave) dedicated to him. Sacramentaries without musical notation transliterated the Greek text of the cherubikon into Latin characters, while the books of Saint-Denis with musical notation translated the text of the troparion into Latin. Only the Hadrianum of Korvey provided the Greek text with notation and served obviously to prepare cantors who did not know Greek very well.
The cherubikon asmatikon.
In the tradition of the cathedral rite of the Hagia Sophia, there was only one melody in the E mode (echos plagios devteros, echos devteros), which has survived in the Asmatika (choir books) and, in a complete form, as "cherouvikon asmatikon" in the books Akolouthiai of the 14th and 15th century. 
In this later elaboration, the domestikos, leader of the right choir, sings an intonation, and the right choir performs the beginning until μυστικῶς. Then the domestikos intervenes with a kalopismos over the last syllable το—το and a teretismos (τε—ρι—ρεμ). The choir concludes the kolon with the last word εἰκονίζοντες. The left choir is replaced by a soloist, called "Monophonaris" (μονοφωνάρις), presumably the lampadarios or leader of the left choir. He sings the rest of the text from an ambo. Then the allelouia (ἀλληλούϊα) is performed with a long final teretismos by the choir and the domestikos.
The cherubikon of the earlier asmatika of the 13th century only contains the parts of the choir and the domestikos, these versions are not identical, but composed realizations, sometimes even the name of the cantor was indicated. Only one manuscript, a 14th-century anthology of the asma, has survived in the collection of the Archimandritate Santissimo Salvatore of Messina (University Library, Ms. gr. 161) with the part of the psaltikon. It provides a performance of the monophonaris together with acclamations or antiphona in honour of the Sicilian King Frederick II and can be dated back to his time.
The cherubikon palatinon.
Another shorter version, composed in the echos plagios devteros without any teretismoi, inserted sections with abstract syllables, was still performed during celebrations of the imperial court of Constantinople by the choir during the 14th century. A longer elaboration of the cherubikon palatinon attributed to "John Koukouzeles" was transcribed and printed in the chant books used by protopsaltes today.
Papadic cherubikon cycles.
Today the common practice is to perform the cherubikon according the echos of the week (octoechos). One of the earliest sources with an octoechos cycle is an Akolouthiai manuscript by Manuel Chrysaphes (Mount Athos, Mone Iveron, Ms. 1120) written in 1458. He had composed and written down an own cycle of 8 cherubika in the papadic melos of the octoechos.
Until today the protopsaltes at the Patriarchate of Constantinople are expected to contribute their own realization of the papadic cycles. Because the length of the cherubikon was originally adapted to the ritual procession, the transcriptions of the print editions according to the New Method distinct between three cycles. A short one for the week days (since the divine liturgy became a daily service), a longer one for Sundays, and an elaborated one for festival occasions, when a bishop or abbot joined the procession.

Alessandro Melli

Alessandro "Sandro" Melli (born 11 December 1969 in Agrigento, Sicily) is an Italian retired footballer who played as a striker.
Club career.
Melli's father was a professional footballer, playing as a centre forward for Parma AC, and the son followed in his footsteps. He made his Parma debut aged 17, and was part of the team that was promoted from the third to the top level. 
After a loan spell at Modena F.C. that was cut short when he fell out with coach Paolo Ferrari, Melli returned to Parma, quickly establishing himself in Parma's first team in the early 1990s, in what was a golden period for the club. As part of that "ducali" squad, he won an Italian Cup in 1991–92, and a UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in the following season (in the final of which he scored), being part of an attacking line-up that featured also Faustino Asprilla, Tomas Brolin and Gianfranco Zola. 
Melli left Parma in 1994, spending six months each at U.C. Sampdoria and A.C. Milan (who swapped Ruud Gullit for him), before returning to the Ennio Tardini after a year away. This lasted two years, but he did not manage to recapture his old form. In total, Melli scored 56 goals in 241 games for Parma.
He was transferred to Serie B side Perugia Calcio in 1997, where he immediately won promotion to the first division. He left Perugia in 2000, and ended his career with a season spell at A.C. Ancona.
After retiring, Melli eventually rejoined former side Parma's non-playing staff, serving as general manager.
International career.
During Parma's heyday, Melli was awarded with two caps with Italy, in 1994 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Malta and Estonia. 
Previously, in 1992, he appeared at the Summer Olympics, netting in two group stage wins as Italy was eventually ousted by champions Spain, and helped the U21s win the UEFA European Championship.
Honours.
Melli won 5 team honours in his professional career.

Tony Veitch

Tony Colin Veitch is a prominent New Zealand reporter and sports broadcaster. He hosted a Radio Sport breakfast show and Television New Zealand's ONE News 6pm sports news until mid-2008.
In July 2008 allegations became public that he had seriously assaulted a former partner in 2006. He resigned from his radio and television positions and in April 2009 admitted and was convicted of recklessly injuring his former partner.
It was reported on June 14, 2009 that Veitch and his wife Zoe Halford had separated, in part due to the stresses of the previous 12 months.
Broadcasting.
Veitch was born in New Zealand but moved to Australia as a teenager and got his start in broadcasting with Nine Network. He returned to New Zealand at 24 to take up a job as a reporter for TVNZ's "Holmes" show under Paul Holmes.
Veitch was mentioned by broadcast journalism academic Yvonne Densem as being a role model for young men considering journalism: "Martin Devlin and Tony Veitch were certainly considered role models. They're quirky, they're unpredictable, they dress casually, they talk sport, they're cool, they stand with one hand in their pocket you know they don't sit ramrod straight in front of a camera."
On several occasions he MC'd events for the Cure Kids children's charity, and in 2002 he appeared in a celebrity race in the "Queenstown Winter Festival" (he won "fastest man")
In early 2005 Veitch was suspended by TVNZ for about a week after appearing in a horse racing advertisement without asking permission from TVNZ. The same year he appeared in the "Auckland City All Stars" soccer match for tsunami relief.
Prior to 7 July 2008 Veitch was a highly visible New Zealand sports broadcaster who hosted a Radio Sport breakfast show and the ONE News 6pm sports news until July 2008. He was also involved with other TVNZ programmes such as "A Game of Two Halves" and "Veitch's View".
Prior to his April 2009 court appearance Veitch made a short comeback, appearing as a guest panelist on "Deaker on Sport."
Awards.
In 2002 he won the SPARC "adidas Award for Television Reporting" and “the judges said that TVNZ’s Tony Veitch was a great talent in contemporary television reporting with a portfolio that showed the range of his considering reporting ability.” In 2006 he won NZ Radio Awards "Best sports presenter: Best Presenter or Talk Show" and was a finalist in "Best news: Best News Story Team Coverage" (with Peter Everatt). In 2007 he won a New Zealand TV Guide "Best on the Box Award" for Best Sport Presenter, an accolade given to him again in 2009, after he resigned.
Controversy.
Accusations of violence.
On 7 July 2008, Fairfax Media publications The Press and the Dominion Post reported that in early 2006 Veitch seriously assaulted his former partner Kristin Dunne-Powell. The papers alleged that the injuries kept Dunne-Powell away from work for several months and that she had developed a 
breakdown that subsequently forced her to quit a managerial position at Vodafone New Zealand. The papers also said Veitch allegedly paid Dunne-Powell NZ$100,000 not to reveal the assault publicly, and to explain the injuries as a result of falling down stairs. In the following days it was alleged that the assault broke Dunne-Powell's back in four places and that she needed to temporarily use a wheelchair.
Resignation from media work.
The day after the assault allegations were made public, Veitch turned up to work on Radio Sport, although Andrew Saville presented the sports news on ONE News. TVNZ released a media statement saying “Sports Presenter Tony Veitch has agreed to step down from his role with TVNZ while media allegations are considered by the broadcaster.” It reported that “head of news and current affairs Anthony Flannery said that Mr Veitch would step down while a review was conducted into the allegations made against him by some media organisations.” He added that due to the nature of the allegations—in particular the privacy of others, he could not make comment further. 
On 9 July, Veitch held a press conference where he said he "broke, I lashed out". He said that although he had no excuses, he had been working seven days a week and was at a low point. He was not on either of his programs that day.
On 10 July, TVNZ CEO Rick Ellis released a statement that ONE News’ Lisa Owen described as "bland". It said "Television New Zealand has a review process underway regarding disclosures by sports presenter Tony Veitch. We are giving the situation our most serious consideration, and Tony's personal statement today will be taken into account by the review process," he said. "Violence is a major issue in New Zealand and the profile of our on air presenters is important to the public and to our organisation." Ellis said TVNZ had had a number of conversations with Veitch and his legal representatives, and the review process was being run by the Heads of Television, Human Resources and News and Current Affairs.
Veitch issued a media statement on 17 July 2008 announcing his resignation from both TVNZ and Radio Sport. He was quoted as saying that "TVNZ has been my life, I have loved my job. There have been a lot of statements made that are untrue which make it untenable now for me to continue in my current roles with TVNZ and the Radio Network."
Criminal conviction.
Veitch was charged with six counts of assaulting Kristin Dunne-Powell and one of injuring her with reckless disregard, between 2002 and 2006. He was released on bail. On 16 April 2009 he appeared in Auckland District Court and entered a guilty plea to the most serious charge, of injuring with reckless disregard. The Crown did not present evidence regarding the other six charges, and they were dismissed. Dunne-Powell's victim impact statement read to the Auckland District Court evidenced that Veitch's kicks to her back, whilst she was lying on the ground caused her spine to fracture in two places, and that Dunne-Powell was forced to use a wheelchair and crutches for several weeks, as a result of Veitch's violent actions towards her.
Veitch was sentenced to nine months supervision, 300 hours community service and a $10,000 fine with the possibility of having to attend a Stop Violence programme should this be deemed necessary by parole officials.
Since the sentencing, questions have come to light over the accuracy of some of the character testimonials submitted during the sentencing phase of the case. It has been alleged that Veitch amended character references or procured some testimonials from prominent New Zealanders by saying that their testimonials would be used for a passport or job application. These testimonials were used by the judge in setting Veitch's sentence. In particular, Dame Susan Devoy and Dave Currie have said that testimonials written by them to support a passport application were edited and submitted on this unrelated matter. The Crown will take no action on the matter.
Suicide attempts.
Veitch has attempted suicide at least three times since the assault allegations were made public, including on 18 April 2009 shortly after sentencing.

2003–04 Arsenal F.C. season

The 2003–04 season was the 115th season of competitive football played by Arsenal Football Club. It began on 1 July 2003 and concluded on 30 June 2004, with competitive matches played between August and May. Arsenal finished the previous season as FA Cup holders and second to Manchester United in the Premier League. The club ended the campaign as league champions without a single defeat – a record of 26 wins and 12 draws. Arsenal fared below par in the cups, eliminated in the FA Cup and League Cup semi-finals to Manchester United and Middlesbrough respectively, and at the quarter-final stage of the UEFA Champions League to Chelsea.
Arsenal did little business in the transfer market early in the season, because of the financial demands that came with the club's new stadium project. The main addition to the first team was goalkeeper Jens Lehmann for £1.5 million; striker José Antonio Reyes was later purchased in the winter transfer window. Arsenal retained their best players and successfully negotiated new contracts for captain Patrick Vieira, and midfielder Robert Pirès. The stability of the squad meant Arsenal were considered front-runners for the Premier League, along with Manchester United, and Chelsea who were taken over by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich.
A strong start to the season saw Arsenal top the league table after four matches. The team's draw at Manchester United in September marked an unsavoury episode between both clubs: several Arsenal players were charged and fined accordingly by The Football Association for their part in a mass brawl that occurred after the match. In November, Arsenal beat Dynamo Kyiv by a single goal and more impressively scored five past Inter Milan at the San Siro – two results which kick-started their Champions League campaign. At the turn of the year, the team won nine league matches in a row to consolidate first position. In the first week of April, they were eliminated from the FA Cup and Champions League, but by the end of the month had secured their status as league champions, with a 2–2 draw against local rivals Tottenham Hotspur.
34 different players represented the club in five competitions and there were 15 different goalscorers. Lehmann was the only ever-present in all 38 league matches for Arsenal, whereas defenders Sol Campbell and Ashley Cole made no appearances as substitutes. Arsenal's top goalscorer for the third year running was Thierry Henry, who scored 39 goals in 51 games. The Frenchman was given the accolade of PFA Players' Player of the Year by his fellow peers and the FWA Footballer of the Year by football writers. Manager Arsène Wenger was voted the Barclaycard Manager of the Year by an awards panel, in recognition of the team's achievement.
Although the Arsenal team were unsuccessful in cup competitions, their dominance in the league was regarded by many commentators as a standalone achievement. They acquired the nickname "The Invincibles", much like the Preston North End team that went unbeaten in the inaugural Football League season. Arsenal was awarded a golden replica trophy by the Premier League once the season concluded and they remained unbeaten for 49 games, setting a new record. In 2012, the Arsenal team of 2003–04 won the "Best Team" category in the Premier League 20 Seasons Awards.
Background.
Arsenal had finished the previous season as runners-up in the Premier League, overhauled by Manchester United in the final ten weeks of the season. The club did however retain the FA Cup, with a 1–0 win against Southampton. Such was Arsenal's effective start to the campaign, manager Arsène Wenger suggested his team could remain the whole season undefeated in all competitions: "It's not impossible as AC Milan once did it but I can't see why it's so shocking to say it. Do you think Manchester United, Liverpool or Chelsea don't dream that as well? They're exactly the same. They just don't say it because they're scared to look ridiculous, but nobody is ridiculous in this job as we know anything can happen." The team lost to Everton a month after Wenger's proclamation; teenager Wayne Rooney scored the match winner, which ended a run of 30 league games without defeat. By February 2003, Arsenal moved five points clear of Manchester United at the top of the league table, but injuries to key players, not least captain Patrick Vieira had destabilised the team. Draws in April, coupled with a defeat to Leeds United at home mathematically ended Arsenal's chances of retaining the title. Wenger refuted opinions from the media that their season was a failure and said: 
In the close season, Chelsea was sold to Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich for £140 million, the biggest takeover in British football history at the time. Although this raised concerns over the future of the sport – Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein quipped that Abramovich had "parked his Russian tanks on our lawn and is firing £50 notes at us", journalist Daniel King noted Chelsea's newfound wealth meant the club were better able to "break the Manchester United-Arsenal duopoly" in the league. Abramovich was said to have placed a bid for Arsenal striker Thierry Henry, which was turned down at once.
Arsenal's transfer activity in the summer was relatively quiet, given the financial constraints that came with the club's new stadium project. The club were able to keep the core of its team, successfully negotiating new contracts for Vieira and winger Robert Pirès. German goalkeeper Jens Lehmann was the only major addition to the first team; he replaced David Seaman who joined Manchester City. Ukrainian defender Oleh Luzhnyi ended his four-year association with the club by joining Wolverhampton Wanderers on a free transfer, while striker Graham Barrett moved to Coventry City. Striker Francis Jeffers, who found opportunities limited in the first team joined his former club Everton on a season-long loan. Giovanni van Bronckhorst moved to Barcelona on a similar deal, with a view to a permanent transfer at the end of the season. Several young players were acquired from academies abroad, namely Gaël Clichy from Cannes and Johan Djourou, formerly of Étoile Carouge. In January 2004, Arsenal signed Spanish striker José Antonio Reyes from Sevilla and in April agreed a deal with Feyenoord for winger Robin van Persie.
Wenger at the start of the season prioritised regaining the league title: "I feel it is very important in our minds to do this and I know the hunger is strong to do it," and named Newcastle United and Liverpool, along with Manchester United and Chelsea to be Arsenal's main rivals for the Premier League. The latter three clubs were considered those most likely to win the Premier League. Former Arsenal midfielder Paul Merson asserted that his old club were favourites because they had the "best players … If they all remain fit week-in week-out then they will not be beaten." Glenn Moore of "The Independent" wrote of Arsenal's chances: "They will be thereabouts, but unless Wenger finally puts his faith in youth, and the likes of Jérémie Aliadière, Jermaine Pennant and Phillipe Senderos repay him, they may lack the depth to sustain a title campaign." Defender Sol Campbell however believed the squad was "strong enough for the league and FA Cup", but doubted their chances of winning the UEFA Champions League.
The club's home strip remained unchanged from the previous season; a red jersey with white sleeves, shorts and socks. The new away kit, a retro yellow jersey with a blue collar trim and shorts, was based on the Arsenal strip worn in the 1979 FA Cup Final.

Pre-season.
In preparation for the forthcoming season, Arsenal played a series of friendles across Western Europe. Their first match ended in defeat against Peterborough United of the Football League Second Division; goalkeeper Stuart Taylor was forced to come off the field after colliding with Peterborough substitute Lee Clarke in the second half. Arsenal then played out a draw against Barnet, where trialist Yaya Touré – the brother of Kolo, was included in the team. In a 2011 interview, Wenger recalled Yaya's performance as being "completely average on the day" and noted his impatience stopped him from joining Arsenal; Touré went on to play for Barcelona before joining Manchester City in 2010. Arsenal undertook a tour in Austria, a year after crowd troubles forced their match in Eisenstadt to be abandoned. Assistant manager Pat Rice took charge of Arsenal against SC Ritzing on 22 July 2003 in Wenger's absence with a stomach upset; the team came from two goals down to draw their second consecutive friendly. Rice was pleased with Philippe Senderos cameo in defence and said: "Still some rough edges but he will only get better working with Martin Keown and Sol Campbell."
Arsenal recorded their first win of the pre-season against Austria Wien. Bergkamp capped off a "superb individual display" by scoring the first goal and setting up the second for Jeffers. The final match of the tour was against Beşiktaş, which required security to be tightened given the history between English and Turkish football supporters. Bergkamp scored the only goal of the match in the second half, "a cheeky effort through keeper Óscar Córdoba's legs". An Arsenal XI in England two days after faced St Albans City, where they won 3–1. The main squad then travelled to Scotland to play Celtic on 2 August 2003. Both goals in the one-all draw came in the second half; the match marked the return of Vieira after three months out with a knee problem. Wenger revealed afterwards that he intended to use the pre-season as an experiment for his defence. He parterned centre back Campbell with Touré, who for much of last season played in midfield. Wenger was pleased with Touré's performance against Celtic and said: "He has quality. He was originally a central defender and, because we have kept a few clean sheets recently and he's played well, I thought we'd keep him there." An Arsenal XI travelled to Belgium for a game against Beveren and conceded two goals in the final five minutes to draw the match 2–2. Arsenal rounded off their pre-season preparations with a 3–0 win against Rangers on 5 August 2003.
Colour key: Green = Arsenal win; Yellow = draw; Red = opponents win.
FA Community Shield.
The 2003 edition of the FA Community Shield, an annual English football match played between the winners of the previous season's Premier League and FA Cup competitions was contested between Manchester United and Arsenal at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium on August 10. Lehmann made his first competitive start for Arsenal and Touré continued to partner Campbell in central defence. United took a 15th minute lead through Mikaël Silvestre, but Henry equalised for Arsenal soon after, from a free-kick. Jeffers was sent off in the second half for kicking out at Phil Neville and with no further goals scored, the outcome of the match was decided by a penalty shoot-out. Goalkeeper Tim Howard saved Van Bronckhorst and Pirès' spot kicks as United won the game 4–3 on penalties. Wenger made reference to Arsenal's low crowd turnout after the match and suggested it meant there was "less and less appetite" for the Shield. He was unhappy with the league season commencing on the following Saturday: "I would have preferred to have had two more weeks, especially for the French players who were in the Confederations Cup. We certainly were not as fit as Manchester United and know many of our players were behind them fitness-wise."
Premier League.
A total of 20 teams competed in the Premier League in the 2003–04 season. Each team played 38 matches; two against every other team and one match at each club's stadium. Three points were awarded for each win, one point per draw, and none for defeats. At the end of the season the top two teams qualified for the group stages of the UEFA Champions League; teams in third and fourth needed to play a qualifier.
The provisional fixture list was released on 19 June 2003, but was subject to change in the event of clashes with other competitions, international football, inclement weather, or matches being selected for television coverage. Five of Arsenal's first eight fixtures were broadcast on Sky Sports, three of which on the network's flagship programme "Ford Super Sunday".
August–October.
Arsenal hosted Everton at Highbury on the opening weekend of the season. Campbell was sent off in the 25th minute, for a professional foul on Everton midfielder Thomas Gravesen. Arsenal, in spite of their man disadvantage, went two goals up after 58 minutes, before Tomasz Radzinski had scored for the visitors, with six minutes of normal time remaining. A trip to the Riverside Stadium to face Middlesbrough a week after ended in a 4–0 win; the first three goals, scored by Henry, Gilberto Silva and Sylvain Wiltord all came in the first half. Three days later, Campbell and Henry each scored as Aston Villa were beaten by two goals. Arsenal continued their perfect start to the season, with a win away at Manchester City on 31 August 2003. With Campbell suspended, Martin Keown came into the first team to partner Touré. Although Arsenal conceded first – "a comical own goal by Lauren" and played "the worst 45 minutes that any of their fans could remember", Wiltord equalised in the second half, before Fredrik Ljungberg had taken advantage of a Seaman error to score the winning goal. After four matches, Arsenal stood in first position, three points clear of Manchester United.
Due to international fixtures, Arsenal did not play another game for two weeks. On the resumption of club football, they faced newly promoted Portsmouth at home. Striker Teddy Sheringham gave the visitors a "deserved" lead, before Arsenal was awarded a penalty when Pirès was adjudged to have been fouled in the penalty area by Dejan Stefanović. Henry scored, but in spite of Arsenal "improvnoticeably in the second half", the game ended in a draw. Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp complained about the penalty decision after the game and felt Pirès "…was going to get a yellow card [for diving." The player himself denied accusations that he deceived the referee: "I did not dive and I am not a cheat. That is not the way I play."
A week later, Arsenal travelled to face Manchester United at Old Trafford. Pirès and Wiltord were dropped by Wenger in favour of Ray Parlour and Ljungberg; Campbell did not travel due to family bereavement. In the 80th minute, Vieira was sent off for a second bookable offence; he attempted to kick out at striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, which was seen by referee Steve Bennett. With the score 0–0, United were awarded a penalty ten minutes afterwards, but Van Nistelrooy's spot kick hit the bar and rebounded back into play. At the final whistle, Van Nistelrooy was immediately confronted by several Arsenal players, which escalated into an altercation between both teams. Six of Arsenal's players (Ashley Cole, Lauren, Keown, Parlour, Lehmann, Vieira) were charged with improper conduct by The Football Association (FA) thereafter; the club were later fined £175,000, the largest ever given to a club by the FA. Lauren received a four-game ban, whereas Vieira and Parlour were given a one match suspension.
In their next match, Arsenal defeated Newcastle United by three goals to two; the winner was a penalty scored by Henry. Vieira suffered an injury during the game; this commenced a period of him being in and out of the side, for two months. Arsenal then faced Liverpool on the first weekend of October at Anfield. In the absence of Vieira, Parlour was on duty as captain, while Campbell replaced Keown in defence. Aliadière was paired alongside Henry in attack. Arsenal went a goal down after 11 minutes, but equalised when Sami Hyypiä unintentionally diverted Edu's header, from an Arsenal free-kick. Pirès in the second half scored the winning goal of the match, which maintained the team's lead at the top of the league table. "The Times" correspondent Oliver Kay described Arsenal's comeback as "spirited" and noted a difference with the team, in comparison to the previous season:
A tightly-fought match against Chelsea at home was settled by a second half error by goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini, which presented Henry with his seventh goal in nine league matches. Both teams up until that point were level on points at the top of the table and unbeaten. Wenger noted after the match that Chelsea's bigger squad would serve them well as the season progressed, but stressed his smaller squad was also beneficial: "We have stability. We have been together for years and have the comfort of knowing we have won things before. When we are challenged, we become even more united." Arsenal ended October with a 1–1 draw against Charlton Athletic. After 10 games, Arsenal garnered 24 points. The point earnt at Charlton was enough for the team to move back into first position, which had been occupied by Chelsea.
November–December.
Arsenal began November with a trip to Elland Road to face Leeds United. There were no changes to the team from the Charlton game; for Leeds, Pennant started against his parent club after being granted permission by Wenger. Arsenal's victory by four goals to one was identical to the scoreline in the corresponding fixture of last season. In a match report for the "News of the World", journalist Martin Samuel picked Henry as the man of the match and said the performance showed that Arsenal "remain the team to beat". Attention soon turned to the North London derby, where Arsenal played Tottenham Hotspur on 8 November 2003. Tottenham had not beaten their rivals since November 1999 and their last win at Highbury came a decade ago. Kanu was brought into the starting line-up to partner Henry, as Wiltord was ruled out with a calf strain. Arsenal conceded an early goal after Darren Anderton capitalised on a defensive mix-up, but they scored two late goals in what was described as "another stuttering" performance by "The Observer". The result put Arsenal four points clear in first, albeit temporary as Chelsea's win at home to Newcastle United 24 hours later cut their gap to one point.</ref>
Arsenal did not play another game for a fortnight because of the international football break. On the resumption of club football, they played Birmingham City away from home. With suspensions coming into action and injuries to first-team players, Wenger was forced to reshuffle his team. Clichy was handed his full debut and Pascal Cygan made his first start of the season, partnering Campbell. Ljungberg opened the scoring for Arsenal inside four minutes and further goals by Bergkamp and Pirès ensured the team won their third straight match of November. By extending their unbeaten run from the start of the season to 13 league matches, Arsenal set a new record. They were then held by Fulham to a goalless draw who became the first team to deny Arsenal from scoring in 46 league matches at Highbury. "The Guardian" correspondent David Lacey summarised Arsenal's football on the day as "strong in the string section but short on percussion" and noted they reverted to the pattern of scoring a perfect goal, instead of being efficient. Chelsea's 1–0 win over Manchester United meant Arsenal moved down to second place on the final day of November.
Two more points were dropped in Arsenal's next match, away to Leicester City on the first weekend of December. Henry was absent from the starting team as was captain Vieira. Arsenal had taken the lead at the hour mark through a Gilberto header, but conceded the equaliser in stoppage time. What made matters worse was the dismissal of Cole for a two-footed lunge on Ben Thatcher; he missed the team's next three fixtures as a result. Wenger himself said afterwards: "It looked like Ashley wanted to get the ball but it was a two-footed tackle that was too high, it was a red card and we have to accept it." A goal from Bergkamp earned Arsenal a 1–0 win the following week, at home to Blackburn Rovers. Chelsea's defeat the day before meant the win for Arsenal was enough to take them back top, a point clear of Manchester United who now lay in second place.
Arsenal then travelled to the Reebok Stadium to play Bolton on 20 December 2003, the setting for where their title challenge "derailed" eight months ago. Although they again picked up just a point, Wenger believed it was a useful one: "Provided Bolton keep playing like that, we will look back at this result and feel very happy. They are as good as a team as we have played." On Boxing Day, Henry scored twice for Arsenal in a 3–0 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers. Three days after, the team played Southampton. The only goal of the match came in the first half: Henry's through pass found Pirès "who slid the ball beneath the exposed Antti Niemi". The win meant Arsenal had gone half the season without losing and the team according to "The Times" had begun to "establish an aura of invincibility". Arsenal ended the calendar year in second place, with 45 points from 19 matches. They were one point behind leaders Manchester United and three ahead of Chelsea.
January–February.
On 7 January 2004, Arsenal played Everton at Goodison Park. Wenger made a host of changes: Cygan was recalled in central defence, which meant Touré was shifted onto the right and Lauren was dropped, while Parlour started in place of Gilberto in midfield. Kanu had given Arsenal the lead in the first half, only for Radzinski to score a "richly deserved late equaliser" for Everton with fifteen minutes remaining. With Manchester United's victory at Bolton on the same night, their lead at the top increased to three points. Three days after the Everton match, Arsenal hosted Middlesbrough and put on a display Wenger reflected as being one of the best of the season. The 4–1 win meant Arsenal moved back top of the league, albeit alphabetically as their points, goal difference and goals scored were identical to that of Manchester United. A week later Arsenal beat Aston Villa by two goals to nil; both of the team's goals were scored by Henry. Controversy surrounded the Frenchman's first goal, a quickly taken free-kick which prompted confusion amongst Villa's players and brought about a reaction towards referee Mark Halsey, who signalled it was permissible. After 22 games played, Arsenal stood in first spot – two points clear of Manchester United.
Arsenal remained unbeaten throughout February, winning five out of five matches. At home to Manchester City on the first night of the month, Reyes made his first appearance for the club, coming on as a substitute in the second half. He had no part with the winning goal, a "crunching, beautifully judged 25-yarder" scored by Henry. Arsenal recorded an away win at Wolverhampton Wanderers 
on 7 February 2004 – their 24th league match, which eclipsed a club record set by George Graham's team of 1990–91. Wenger in his pre-match press conference played down the landmark "unless they guarantee trophies". Henry reached a personal landmark against Southampton three days after, scoring his 100th and 101st Premier League goals. The victory moved Arsenal five points clear at the top, despite having played one more game than Manchester United.
A Saturday lunchtime kick-off against Chelsea saw the return of Henry and Campbell in the first team; both were absent in team's FA Cup fifth round against the same opposition. Arsenal found themselves a goal down after 27 seconds, but responded with an equaliser in the 15th minute – Bergkamp's "delicately curving pass" found Vieira on the left side to shoot the ball past goalkeeper Neil Sullivan. The winner came six minutes later: Sullivan misjudged a corner taken by Henry, which allowed Edu to shoot into an empty net. Arsenal's lead was now seven and it represented "a stronger position than any they held last season" according to Wenger. Touré's transition into a defender was highlighted following the game:
The final match of the month was against Charlton at Highbury. Arsenal scored twice in the space of the opening four minutes, but by the end were "clinging to their lead like nervous kittens". After 27 games, the team stood in first position and accumulated 67 points. They were nine points clear of both Chelsea and Manchester United.
March–May.
Arsenal carried their good form into March; Henry and Pirès scored in the defeat of Blackburn Rovers. It was a laboured performance from the league leaders, one which served a "…reminder of the old maxim that championships are won by teams who can pick up points when they are not playing well." Arsenal then played Bolton Wanderers at home; Wenger made one change from the previous match – Bergkamp replaced Reyes upfront. The blustery conditions forced the game to be delayed by 15 minutes, approximately the same amount of time it took Pirès to score Arsenal's opening goal. By the 24th minute, it was 2–0: Henry's cross found Bergkamp who shot the ball past Jussi Jääskeläinen at the first attempt. In spite of Bolton's performance picking up after scoring just before half time, the result was a ninth straight league win for Arsenal and kept them nine points clear at the top.
The visit of Manchester United on 28 March 2004 provided a stern test for Arsenal; it was both clubs' first meeting since the fiasco at Old Trafford. Cole, injured in the midweek Champions League game against Chelsea was replaced by Clichy in the starting line-up, while Bergkamp was dropped for Reyes. Henry gave Arsenal the lead, with a long range shot that swerved past goalkeeper Roy Carroll. With five minutes of the game left, Louis Saha evaded the Arsenal defence and scored the equaliser for Manchester United. Arsenal came close to a winner in injury time, but for Lauren to have his shot saved. The draw was no good for Sir Alex Ferguson, the manager of Manchester United, who afterwards conceded his team's chances: "They'll (Arsenal) go on to win the league now – I'm sure of that. They are playing with great determination … a very strong team, so should win the league really". In avoiding defeat, Arsenal set a league record of 30 matches unbeaten from the start of the season. They remained in first position at the end of March and were seven points in front of Chelsea, with eight matches remaining.
After two cup exits in the space of a week, Arsenal faced Liverpool on Good Friday at Highbury. Hyypiä opened the scoring for the visitors after five minutes, and in spite of Henry equalising just after the half-hour mark, Liverpool led again before the interval. Arsenal responded to what was described as a "pivotal moment" in their season by scoring twice in a minute; Henry's second goal saw the player hold off Dietmar Hamann in midfield, weave through defender Jamie Carragher and place the ball past Jerzy Dudek. The striker completed his hat-trick in the 78th minute, after being set up by Bergkamp. Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier likened Arsenal to a "wounded animal" after the match and believed Henry was "the man who made the difference … he set the tempo". Arsenal then played out a goalless draw with Newcastle United on Bank Holiday Monday, in a game with very few clear cut chances. Five days later, the team faced Leeds United. On a night where Henry scored four goals and was described by his manager as "the best striker in the world", Arsenal moved to within two wins of regaining the league title.
With Chelsea unable to garner maximum points in their next two matches, Arsenal knew before their game away at Tottenham that a draw would guarantee their status as champions. Cole returned for the derby, after sitting out the Leeds match with an ankle injury. Arsenal took an early lead when Vieira finished off a counter-attacking move. Incisive football brought about the second goal, ten minutes before the break. Bergkamp passed the ball to a moving Vieira, who cut it back for Pirès to sidefoot. Tottenham replied in the second half by scoring twice – the equaliser a penalty, but it did not stop the Arsenal players celebrating at the final whistle "in front of their supporters' White Hart Lane enclave". This marked the second time the club had been crowned league champions at their rivals' ground, the first being in 1971. Wenger praised his team for their success in an interview with the BBC: "We've been remarkably consistent, haven't lost a game and we have played stylish football. We have entertained people who just love football."
In May, successive draws at home to Birmingham City and Portsmouth left Arsenal with 84 points from 36 games.</ref> Reyes scored the only goal of the match against Fulham; he profited from a mistake by goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar: "The Dutchman tried to go past the Arsenal forward, but instead gifted possession and with it the easiest of open goals." Arsenal's final game of the league season was against Leicester City. They conceded the opening goal, but turned the match around in the second half through goals from Henry and Vieira. With 26 wins, 12 draws and no defeats, the team became the first since Preston North End in 1888–89 to go through a league season undefeated. Reviewing the match and overall season, Amy Lawrence of "The Observer" wrote: "Arsenal's achievement may not make them 'great' in everyone's opinion – those who define greatness only by European Cups, back-to-back titles, and triple cartwheels on the way to every goal – but it is staggering in its own right."
Results.
Colour key: Green = Arsenal win; Yellow = draw; Red = opponents win.
FA Cup.
The FA Cup is English football's primary cup competition. It was first held in 1871–72 with only 15 teams entering; the growth of the sport and changes to the competition's structure meant by the 2002–03 season, more than 600 teams took part. Clubs in the Premier League enter the FA Cup in the third round and are drawn randomly out of a hat with the remaining clubs. If a match is drawn, a replay comes into force, ordinarily at the ground of the team who were away for the first game. As with league fixtures, FA Cup matches are subject to change in the event of games being selected for television coverage and this often can be influenced by clashes with other competitions. In the case of Arsenal, all but one of their ties (fourth round) was televised to the British audience.</ref>
Arsenal entered the 2003–04 edition as holders of the cup. The team were undefeated in 14 cup ties since their 2–1 loss to Liverpool in the 2001 FA Cup Final, and aimed to win the competition for a third season in succession, something last achieved by Blackburn Rovers from 1884 to 1886. Henry believed Arsenal's good cup form showed they were "interested" in the competition and hoped their success would continue. The FA Cup was not high in Wenger's priority list – "The League and the Champions League are more important," but he clarified this never meant Arsenal intended to neglect the competition: "You win what you can and go as far as you can."
Arsenal was drawn to face Leeds United away in the third round; the match was played on the first weekend of January. Wenger made six changes to the team which started at Southampton in the league, one of which Cole replacing Clichy at left-back after serving his three-match suspension. After eight minutes, Leeds went ahead when Lehmann's goal clearance hit striker Mark Viduka and rebounded into the net. Arsenal equalised through Henry, who converted Ljungberg's cross from the right on a volley. Additional goals from Edu, Pirès and Touré inflicted a third consecutive 4–1 defeat for Leeds against Arsenal at Elland Road. At home to Middlesbrough in the fourth round, Bergkamp opened the scoring for Arsenal, following good play from Parlour. Joseph-Désiré Job however equalised for the away team four minutes after. Ljungberg restored Arsenal's lead with a shot outside the penalty box and scored a second, direct from a corner. George Boateng was sent off for the visitors in the 86th minute for two bookable offences and substitute David Bentley added a fourth goal for Arsenal – he chipped goalkeeper Schwarzer in the last minute of normal time.
In the fifth round, Arsenal played Chelsea at Highbury. Five minutes before the end of the first half, striker Adrian Mutu gave Chelsea the lead, with a shot "from 20 yards". Reyes, who replaced Henry in the starting eleven for the tie, levelled the scoreline with a long range effort. He beat goalkeeper Sullivan for pace to score his second, which later proved to be the winning goal of the match. The quarter-final pitted Arsenal against Portsmouth at Fratton Park on 6 March 2004. Henry opened the scoring in the 25th minute and further goals from himself, Ljungberg and Touré secured the team's passage into the last four of the competition. Edu was singled out for praise by "The Guardian" correspondent Kevin McCarra, who enthused over the visitors' performance: "Arsenal echoed the Ajax philosophy as players swapped position and kept changing the point of attack before the mesmerised eyes of the opposition."
Manchester United was Arsenal's opponents for the semi-final, staged at Villa Park on 3 April 2004. Both teams settled for a draw in the league the previous Sunday and given this was for a place in the final, the stakes were much higher. United defender Gary Neville described the game as his team's "most important" of the season after they were eliminated from the Champions League and he deemed them "too far behind" in the Premier League. Wenger rested Henry to a place on the substitutes' bench, in mind of the team's upcoming fixture congestion. Although Arsenal started the better of the two teams, it was United midfielder Paul Scholes who scored the only goal of the game which ensured their progress into the final.
Colour key: Green = Arsenal win; Red = opponents win.
Football League Cup.
The Football League Cup is a cup competition open to clubs in the Premier League and Football League. Like the FA Cup it is played on a knockout basis, with the exception of the semi-finals, which are contested over a two-legged tie. Wenger's tenure at Arsenal has seen him use the competition to field younger and lesser known players, something he and Ferguson were initially criticised for in 1997. While Ferguson felt it was an unwanted distraction at the time, Wenger said: "If the competition wants to survive it must offer the incentive of a European place."</ref> The winners of the League Cup in the 2003–04 season earnt entry into the UEFA Cup, unless they qualified for the UEFA Champions League through their league position. League Cup matches are subject to change in the event of games being selected for television coverage, inclement weather and potential competition clashes. All rounds up until the final are played in midweek.
Arsenal entered the League Cup in the third round and was drawn at home to Rotherham United. Wenger handed midfielder Cesc Fàbregas his debut at 16 years and 177 days; he as of 2013 is still the youngest player to turn out for the club. Arsenal led from the 11th minute through an Aliadière goal, but conceded an equaliser late on which forced extra time. Rotherham goalkeeper Mike Pollitt was sent off for handling the ball in his penalty area; his substitute Gary Montgomery denied Wiltord from scoring the winner. With no further goals, the match went to penalties; Arsenal won 9–8 in the shootout. Fellow divisional opponents Wolverhampton Wanderers was defeated 5–1 by Arsenal in the fourth round; Vieira absent through injury in September and October made his first team return and played the full match.
In the fifth round, Arsenal travelled to The Hawthorns to play West Brom. Wenger added experience to the side to complement youth, with Parlour, Edu, Kanu and Keown all featuring. Arsenal took the lead in the 25th minute through Kanu. Lauren’s cross from the right-hand side deflected in the direction of the striker. His header was saved by goalkeeper Russell Hoult, who was unable to deny Kanu shooting the rebounded ball into the net. Aliadière scored Arsenal’s second goal of the match following Hoult’s poor clearance.
Arsenal exited the competition in the semi-finals against Middlesbrough. At Highbury, the setting for the first leg, Juninho scored the only goal of the tie. Arsenal’s task of progressing was made more difficult after Keown was sent off in the second leg and Boudewijn Zenden doubled Middlesbrough’s aggregate scoreline. Though Edu equalised for Arsenal on the night, Reyes’ own goal earnt Middlesbrough the win. Wenger opined of the result: "I don't think we deserved to lose; even when we were down to 10 men we were running the game."
Colour key: Green = Arsenal win; Yellow = draw; Red = opponents win.
UEFA Champions League.
The UEFA Champions League is a continental club football competition organised by UEFA.
Group stage.
Arsenal was drawn in Group B, along with Italian club Internazionale, Lokomotiv Moscow of Russia and Ukraine's Dynamo Kyiv. Wenger believed the trips to Eastern Europe threatened his team's chances of winning the Premier League: "The other English teams have more comfortable groups than we do. It is tough to go to Russia – I always say that if you have to travel more than two hours it is difficult. Sometimes the players pay a high price in the games that follow the Champions League matches."
Arsenal opened their Champions League campaign with a 3–0 defeat against Inter Milan. Goals from Julio Ricardo Cruz, Andy van der Meyde and Obafemi Martins all in the first half extended Arsenal’s run of six home games in the competition without a win. Wenger said afterwards: “We can complain and cry the whole night but that will not change the result. The only thing we can do is to respond." The team, without Campbell and Vieira, earned a draw away to Lokomotiv Moscow, but remained bottom of the group. Arsenal lost to Dynamo Kyiv in late October; Wenger’s decision to shift from his preferred 4–4–2 formation caused the team to play more narrow than usual. Cole scored the winning goal in the reverse fixture at Highbury. A cross by Wiltord was flicked on by Henry in the direction of an incoming Cole, who dived to head the ball past goalkeeper Oleksandr Shovkovskiy.
The team scored four goals in the second half against Inter Milan, with the final score 5–1. Wenger felt the result showed there was “…a special mental strength in the team”, while Cole compared it to England’s victory against Germany in 2001 and added “But this was even better.” The performance was celebrated by "The Daily Telegraph" football correspondent Henry Winter: 
Arsenal won 2–0 against Lokomotiv Moscow to top Group B. Jacob Lekgetho's dismissal in the eighth minute meant the visitors played the remainder of the match with ten men, not that this significantly aided Arsenal – "their superiority was already palpable."
Knockout phase.
Round of 16.
Arsenal was paired up against Celta Vigo in the last 16 stage, with the first leg played at the Balaídos. Despite conceding two goals from set pieces, Arsenal scored three times to win the game and took a “significant step towards the quarter-finals” given the away goals rule. Their passage was secured with a 2–0 win on 10 March 2004; Henry scored both goals for the team.
Colour key: Green = Arsenal win; Yellow = draw; Red = opponents win.
Quarter-finals.
In the quarter-finals, Arsenal met fellow English club Chelsea. The draw disappointed Dein: “One of the joys of playing in Europe is playing teams from overseas – and having played Chelsea three times, it is a bit anti-climactic.” The first leg, played at Stamford Bridge ended in a draw with Guðjohnsen and Pirès scoring for their respective clubs. Arsenal was unable to take advantage of Marcel Desailly’s dismissal in the second half, but Wenger felt his team were in a good position to progress: "Our main aim will be to win the game at Highbury and we know we can do that.”
Henry, rested for the FA Cup semi-final match, started alongside Reyes for the second leg. It was the latter forward who gave Arsenal the lead in the first half of injury time, but Frank Lampard equalised for Chelsea in the 51st minute. With three minutes remaining of the match, defender Wayne Bridge scored to eliminate Arsenal from the competition.
Colour key: Green = Arsenal win; Yellow = draw; Red = opponents win.
Player statistics.
Arsenal used a total of 34 players during the 2003–04 season and there were 15 different goalscorers. There were also three squad members who did not make a first-team appearance in the campaign. The team played in a 4–4–2 formation throughout the season, with two wide midfielders. Touré featured in 55 matches – the most of any Arsenal player in the campaign and Lehmann started in all 38 league matches.
The team scored a total of 114 goals in all competitions. The highest scorer was Henry, with 39 goals, followed by Pirès who scored 19 goals. Three of Arsenal's goals in the 2003–04 season (Henry against Manchester City and Liverpool, Vieira against Tottenham Hotspur) were shortlisted for Goal of the Season by viewers of ITV's "The Premiership". Five Arsenal players were sent off during the season: Jeffers, Vieira, Campbell, Cole and Keown.

"Numbers in parentheses denote appearances as substitute. Players with name struck through and marked left the club during the playing season."
Awards.
In recognition of the team's achievement, Wenger was awarded the Barclaycard Manager of the Year. A spokesperson of the awards panel said of the decision: "Arsène Wenger is a very worthy recipient of this accolade and has sent his team into the history books. Arsenal have played exciting attacking football throughout the season and finishing it unbeaten is a feat that may not be repeated for another 100 years." Henry was given the accolade of PFA Players' Player of the Year by his fellow peers and the FWA Footballer of the Year by football writers for the second consecutive season. He came runner-up in both the 2003 FIFA World Player of the Year and the Ballon d'Or 2003.
Three Arsenal players received the Premier League Player of the Month award – Henry twice in January and April 2004, and Bergkamp and Edu shared the accolade in February 2004 after the judges "felt it was appropriate that we make a joint award". Wenger was the Premier League Manager of the Month in August 2003 and February 2004.
Aftermath and legacy.
A day after the Leicester City match, Arsenal paraded the Premier League trophy on an open-top bus, in front of more than 250,000 fans. The victory parade commenced at Highbury and ended at Islington Town Hall. At the town hall balcony, Vieira addressed the crowd: "It has been a fantastic season. We achieved something unbelievable but we couldn't have done it without the fans." In an interview with the BBC, Dein added: "We've seen history made and I'd be surprised if it happens again. It's just been a privilege to watch Arsenal this season."
Arsenal's achievement of going through the league season unbeaten received considerable praise from those involved in football. Derek Shaw, the chairman of Preston North End offered his congratulations as they equalled Preston's record of completing a league season without defeat, set 115 years previously. Brazilian Roberto Carlos likened Arsenal's style of play to "samba football" while Michel Platini applauded the team's "great flair and spirit". Former Arsenal manager George Graham pinpointed the success to defensive improvements, which rued them a year ago and former striker Alan Smith felt the team were "certainly the best Highbury's ever seen". 
The British press unanimously praised Arsenal's feat once the season drew to a close; the "News of the World" branded the team as "Immortals", while "The Sunday Times" led with the headline "Arsenal the New Invincibles". In an otherwise positive reflection of Arsenal's season, Glenn Moore wrote for "The Independent": "There may thus have been some truth in Arsène Wenger's declaration that Arsenal's achievement was a greater triumph than winning the Champions' League. Arsenal's prolonged celebrations reflected the scale of this landmark and yet, when they reflect in the summer break, how many players will agree with Wenger?".
A one-off golden replica trophy was commissioned by the Premier League thereafter; it was awarded to Arsenal before their first home game of the following season. The team eclipsed the league record of 42 matches without defeat (set by Nottingham Forest) against Blackburn Rovers and went seven more matches before losing – away to Manchester United in October 2004. Although Arsenal regained the FA Cup – on penalties against United, they finished second to Chelsea in the league. The move to the Emirates Stadium in 2006 coincided with a transitional phase for the club. Several experienced first teamers were displaced in favour of youth and the style of football became shifted more towards ball retention. Arsenal have since failed to regain the league title; they nevertheless remain a fixture in the Champions League under Wenger's stewardship.
In 2009, the Arsenal team of 2003–04 were ranked fifth in the "Daily Mail" list of the 10 "Greatest Teams Of All Time". In 2012, they won the "Best Team" category in the Premier League 20 Seasons Awards. The title win at White Hart Lane came third in a list of Arsenal's "Greatest 50 Moments", whereas the performance at the San Siro was ranked tenth.

Hsisosuchus

Hsisosuchus is an extinct genus of crocodyliform from China. Currently there are three species within this genus: "H. dashanpuensis" is from the Middle Jurassic, while "H. chungkingensis" and "H. chowi" are from the Late Jurassic. . It is likely to have been a medium-sized predator (~3 meters in length).
Fossils of "H. chungkingensis" were found in the Shangshaximiao Formation (near Chongqing city). The holotype consists of the cranial skeleton and caudal osteoderms. A more complete specimen was found and described that added significant information on the postcranium of "H. chungkingensis".
"H. dashanpuensis" was found in the Xiashaximiao Formation.
"H. chowi" was found in the Shangshaximiao Formation. The holotype specimen consists of a nearly complete skull (25 cm long), mandibles, most of the vertebral column, partial pectoral and pelvic girdles, most of the forelimbs, fragments of hindlimbs and many osteoderms. It differs from other species of "Hsisosuchus" in several features of its skull and postcrania.

"Elenore" is a 1968 song by American pop-rock group The Turtles, originally included on the album "The Turtles Present the Battle of the Bands". Its writing was co-credited to the five members of the band, Howard Kaylan, Mark Volman, Al Nichol, Jim Pons and John Barbata. The song was written as a satire of one of their earlier pop hits, "Happy Together".
By 1968, The Turtles had had a number of successful pop records on the White Whale label, including Bob Dylan's "It Ain't Me Babe", "Happy Together" and "She'd Rather Be With Me", both written by Gary Bonner and Alan Gordon. The band members wanted to diversify their musical output, in parallel with more innovative musical groups of the time, and to record their own material. However, their record company were reluctant to allow them to do so.
As a demonstration of their musical versatility, The Turtles recorded the album "...the Battle of the Bands", which featured performances in a wide variety of different musical styles. The band recorded "Elenore" as a parody of the type of happy-go-lucky pop songs they themselves had been performing, but with deliberately clichéd and slapdash lyrics such as: "Your looks intoxicate me / Even though your folks hate me / There's no one like you, Elenore, really"; and "Gee, I think you're swell / And you really do me well / You're my pride and joy, et cetera..."
Howard Kaylan later said: Elenore was a parody of "Happy Together." It was never intended to be a straight-forward song. It was meant as an anti-love letter to ], who were constantly on our backs to bring them another "Happy Together." So I gave them a very skewed version. Not only with the chords changed, but with all these bizarre words. It was my feeling that they would listen to how strange and stupid the song was and leave us alone. But they didn't get the joke. They thought it sounded good. Truthfully, though, the production on "Elenore" WAS so damn good. Lyrically or not, the sound of the thing was so positive that it worked. It certainly surprised me. 
The song was produced by Chip Douglas and released as a single (White Whale 276). "Elenore" reached No. 6 on the "Billboard" Hot 100, and also reached # 7 on the UK singles chart, # 6 in Canada, # 8 in Australia, and # 1 in New Zealand. It has since featured on many anthologies, and as part of the soundtrack of the 2009 film "The Boat That Rocked".
The most famous cover of this song is "Scende la pioggia" by Italian singer Gianni Morandi.
Dean Torrence, one half of Jan & Dean covered the song on his 2002 album, "Dean Torrence Anthology".

I Do (Jewel song)

"I Do" is the title of a song written and recorded by American country music artist Jewel. It was released in June 2008 as the second single her album "Perfectly Clear". The song was Jewel's second Top 40 country hit, although it was less-successful than its predecessor, reaching a peak of number 38 after a short chart run.
Content.
"I Do" is a mid-tempo love song backed primarily with percussion and features steel guitar and string fills, and an electric guitar bridge. The narrator describes a love that is troublesome and with barriers that need to be overcome: "Well, our hearts are locked inside an iron box / We're both too afraid to reveal our most tender parts, oh."
Reception.
SFGate recommended "I Do" as one of the best tracks in a review of "Perfectly Clear" (alongside "Everything Reminds Me of You" and "Till It Feels Like Cheating"). "have a distinct and believable point of view, and the arrangements merge modern Nashville gloss with an acoustic base that works with Jewel's idiosyncratic, breathy voice. Also, her typical lyrical slant — taking a positive yet earthy look at everyday life — fits country music as snugly as two Lego blocks locking together." Hip Online's review of the album, was less favorable, "is pretty, unremarkable. It goes from a total country song like “Stronger Woman” to a folksy track like this is really startling."
Music video.
A music video was released for the song, directed by Peter Zavadil. The video begins with Jewel in a car in the parking lot of a restaurant. She steps out of the car walks into the restaurant, approaching real-life husband, Ty Murray. They leave the restaurant and get into separate cars, before speeding down the highway toward each other. They crash and are then shown together in a field of flowers.
The video debuted at #15 on CMT's "Top Twenty Countdown" for the week of June 27, 2008.
Chart performance.
"I Do" debuted at #60 on the "Billboard" Hot Country Songs chart in July. After 9 weeks on the chart, it reached a peak of #38.

Grigori Aleksandrov

Grigori Vasilyevich Aleksandrov or Alexandrov ( - original family name was Мормоненко or Mormonenko; 23 January 1903, Ekaterinburg – 16 December 1983, Moscow) was a prominent Soviet film director who was named a People's Artist of the USSR in 1947 and a Hero of Socialist Labor in 1973. He was awarded the Stalin Prizes for 1941 and 1950.
Initially associated with Sergei Eisenstein, with whom he worked as a co-director, screenwriter and actor, Aleksandrov became a major director in his own right in the 1930s, when he directed "Jolly Fellows" and a string of other musical comedies starring his wife Lyubov Orlova.
Though Aleksandrov remained active until his death, his musicals, amongst the first made in the Soviet Union, remain his most popular films. They rival Ivan Pyryev's films as the most effective and light-hearted showcase ever designed for Stalin-era USSR.
Early life and collaboration with Eisenstein.
Aleksandrov was born Grigori Vasilyevich Mormonenko in Ekaterinburg, Russia in 1903. Starting at age nine, Aleksandrov worked odd jobs at the Ekaterinburg Opera Theater, eventually making his way to assistant director. He also pursued a musical education, studying violin at the Ekaterinburg Musical School, from which he graduated in 1917.
Aleksandrov came to Moscow after studying directing and briefly managing a movie theater. In 1921, while acting with the Proletcult Theatre he met a then 23-year-old Sergei Eisenstein. Eisenstein and Aleksandrov collaborated on several plays before Eisenstein made his first feature length film, "Strike", which Aleksandrov co-wrote with Eisenstein, Ilya Kravchunovsky, and Valeryan Pletnyov. Next came Eisenstein's landmark "The Battleship Potemkin", in which Aleksdanrov played Ippolit Giliarovsky. Aleksandrov co-directed Eisenstein's next two features, "" and "The General Line", which were also their last works in the silent era.
Along with Eisenstein's other major collaborator, cinematographer Eduard Tisse, Aleksandrov joined the director when he came to Hollywood in the early 1930s. He also traveled with them to Mexico for the filming of Eisenstein's unrealized project about the country. An edited version of the footage, known as "¡Qué viva México!", was put together by Aleksandrov in 1979.
Musical comedies.
Aleksandrov returned to the Soviet Union in 1932 under direct orders from Joseph Stalin. He directed a pro-Stalin film, "International" ("Интернационал"), the following year and after a meeting with Stalin and Maxim Gorky, he embarked on making the first Soviet musical, "Jolly Fellows", starring Leonid Utyosov and Lyubov Orlova, whom Aleksandrov would later marry. Orlova had been previously married to an economist who had been arrested in 1930. She would go on to star in his most successful films: "Circus", "Volga Volga", and "Bright Path".
After World War II.
Aleksdandrov's first postwar film was "Spring", another musical comedy starring Lyubov Orlova, as well as several other top-notch actors, including Nikolai Cherkasov, Erast Garin, and Faina Ranevskaya.
Popular public figures in the Soviet Union, Aleksandrov and Orlova had a difficult relationship with Stalin, who admired their films (he reportedly gave a print of "Volga Volga" as a present to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt) but frequently harassed the pair, imprisoning or executing several of their close friends. Paradoxically, Aleksandrov found it harder to work in the more politically relaxed atmosphere that followed Stalin's death. He taught directing at VGIK from 1951 to 1957 and made several films about the years leading up to the Russian Revolution, including several about Vladimir Lenin.
His last narrative feature was "Skvorets i Lira" ("Starling and Lyre") (1973), which starred Orlova in her last role and was not released. Orlova died in 1975. In 1983, he worked on a documentary about the career of his late wife. He died in December of that year of a kidney infection and was buried next to Orlova in Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow.

Erie Plating Company

Erie Plating Company, named for its location in Erie, Pennsylvania, specializes in applied electrochemical and mechanical metal finishing to ferrous and nonferrous metals, as well as chromate conversion and anodizing finishes on aluminum. The company is ISO 9000 certified for aerospace, military, and industrial metal finishing engineering and quality systems.
History.
In 1925, Raymond E. Smith, a former metal polisher and the superintendent of the Lakeside Forge Company was asked by their group of investors to join in starting a metal finishing company that could perform finishing and electroplating for third-party clients. Along with a financier, a technician, and a salesman, he formed the Erie Plating Company, the first electroplating company in Northwest Pennsylvania. Erie Plating Company now serves customers through the Eastern United States.
At the time of the company's founding the electroplating industry was in its infancy. At that time, the company's main focus was in finishing Cast-iron cookware, polishing the chrome on Wood-burning stoves, and plating metals used in other products like locomotives, automobiles, and iceboxes.
Its facility covering , the company remained small but continued to produce throughout the Great Depression years.
In 1932, Lewis T. Briggs Sr., a part-owner of the Erie Bronze Company, bought out Smith's co-investors and became president of the eight-person company.
During World War II the Erie Plating Company expanded into plating military components. The main wartime products produced in Erie were bomb fuses, aircraft parts, and communication equipment.
Landmark 1961 Pennsylvania Sales and Use Tax Case.
In March 1957, an accountant from the Pennsylvania Sales and Use Tax Bureau performed an audit of Erie Plating Company, and retroactively assessed Use Taxes on Erie Plating Company's purchases of supplies. This assessment violated the precedent that, as a manufacturing company, Erie Plating Company was exempt from the tax, and results in double-taxation. That is, the electroplating processes applied to the component parts were taxed, and then the same processes were re-taxed in the sale of the final product. In July, Erie Plating Company filed a petition for reassessment, a hearing was held in January of the following year, and three months later the Bureau reaffirmed its assessments.
Erie Plating Company again appealed for reassessment, and the issue came to a head on December 17, 1958, during the second hearing on the issue. Addressing the court, Lewis T. Briggs Sr. said:
Such interpretation the Sales and Use Tax Law is unfair to Pennsylvania industry... because we are competing with electroplaters in Ohio and New York where no such tax is imposed.
The business of industrial metal finishing in which we are engaged is a highly competitive manufacturing enterprise. The latest published national average of profit for the industry is less than 2% of the sales dollar before federal taxes and we must therefore depend on a large volume with economical operation to keep out of the red. The imposition of a Use Tax on our purchase of supplies and equipment would certainly result in an overall net loss.
Two weeks later, the Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue rescinded the assessments in total. However, in March 1959, the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue issued a lawsuit against Erie Plating Company. This was the first instance in the 30-year history of the Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue in which any state department had countermanded its decision.
Trial began October 10, 1960, and on February 14, 1961, the court presented its decision that the Pennsylvania Board of Finance and Revenue was in error, thereby declaring that electroplating is not, in fact, manufacturing, and that therefore electroplaters are not exempt from sales and use taxes.
In response, Erie Plating Company issued the following statement:
In view of the adverse court decision metal finishers throughout the state are now liable for Use Tax dating back to September 1, 1953 plus a 25% penalty plus interest at 6%.
What this means to the metal finishing industry in Pennsylvania is tragic to contemplate. It seems inevitable that some operators will be put out of business --- many, even among the strongest, will be forced to do major refinancing, and not a few are considering moving out of state.
Notwithstanding, Erie Plating Company survived the discriminatory ruling, and chose to retain operation in the state of Pennsylvania.
1963 Erie Urban Renewal Act.
In 1963, Erie Plating Company was one of the first companies to embrace the Erie Urban Renewal Act and participate in the Liberty-Sassafras Redevelopment Program, enhancing community business development in the City of Erie Pennsylvania.
1972 Fighting against Cadmium Price-Fixing.
In 1972, Lewis T. Briggs Jr., as a member of the North American Metal Finishing Society's Strategic and Critical Materials Committee, placed formal accusations with the United States Tariff Commission against the major American cadmium producers as represented by the Lead Zinc Producers Committee. The accusation was that:
No other metal has been so completely controlled by a group of U.S. producers for their own selfish interests cadmium has been. And we find it hard not to suspect that illegal price rigging and manipulative practices are taking place again.
Efforts by the Cadmium Lobby to prevent the importation of cadmium from Japan under the guise of 'dumping' is not only unfair, but constitutes a very obvious sham. Their purpose is most transparent --- by limiting the importation of this critical and strategic material, U.S. cadmium producers would have an even freer rein to control the sale and distribution of this metal.
The North American Metal Finishing Society, under the advice of Lewis T. Briggs Jr., urged the United States Tariff Commission to encourage the importation of foreign cadmium to help stabilize the market.
2000: Erie Plating Company's 75th Anniversary.
In September 2000, Erie Plating Company was recognized for 75 years of business in the city of Erie, in a ceremony conducted by Erie Mayor Joyce Savocchio, Erie County Executive Judy Lynch, and Pennsylvania State Governor Tom Ridge.
Today.
In 2008, Erie Plating Company employs about 125 employees at its central plant, which ranks among the top 40% of the cleanest industrial facilities in the United States according to Scorecard's Environmental Release Survey.
Recent products include the chrome plating on AMSCO operating table handles, gas pump handles at service stations, auto parts, and components of measuring tools and computers.
1996 Summer Olympics.
For the 1996 Summer Olympics, Erie Plating Company provided metal finishing services for the 10,000+ Olympic torches manufactured by the American Meter Company, also headquartered in Erie, Pennsylvania. Each torch weighed about and was made primarily of aluminum, with a Georgia pecan wood handle and gold ornamentation.

Rise (Herb Alpert album)

Rise is a 1979 album by Herb Alpert.
History.
The "Rise" album was conceived in 1979 after the worldwide success of both the 7" & 12" versions of the single "Rise", a song written by Andy Armer and Randy Badazz Alpert which became a #1 million selling hit song on sales charts, radio, and in dance clubs throughout America, Europe, and Japan.
"Rise" was constructed with Side One consisting of original songs composed by Herb, Andy and Randy. Side Two consisted of cover versions of songs Herb had admired. All songs featured Alpert on trumpet with many great musicians helping him bring the songs to fruition in the studio.
Side One began with the song, "1980", an instrumental theme written by Herb Alpert which NBC Sports executive Don Ohlmeyer had commissioned for the network's planned coverage of the Summer Olympics in Moscow. Song number 2 was the title track, "Rise", written by Andy Armer and Randy Badazz Alpert. Song number 3 was, "Behind The Rain" written by Herb Alpert. The closing song on Side One is another Andy Armer and Randy Badazz Alpert song called, "Rotation". "Rotation was a Top 30 follow-up single to the #1 single, "Rise". Side Two included a cover of "Street Life," originally recorded by The Jazz Crusaders, a version of the Bill Withers song "Love Is" featuring Alpert's vocals, as well as a dance rendition of Joaquín Rodrigo's "Aranjuez" classical composition.
"Rise" was the first album to be recorded digitally on the 3M 32-track digital recorder at Alpert's A&M Records studios. 
The album eventually peaked at #1 on the Billboard Jazz Album chart, and at #6 on both the Billboard 200 and R&B Album charts and sold over 2 million copies.

<doc id="18424393" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18424393" title="Uria Simango">
Uria Simango

The reverend Uria Timoteo Simango (born March 15, 1926) was a Mozambican Presbyterian minister and prominent leader of the Mozambique Liberation Front FRELIMO during the liberation struggle against Portuguese colonial rule. His precise date of death is unknown as he was extrajudicially executed (along with several other FRELIMO dissidents and his wife, Celina)
Simango was a founder member of FRELIMO, serving as Vice-President from its formation in 1962 until the time of the assassination of its first leader Eduardo Mondlane, in February 1969. Simango succeeded Mondlane as FRELIMO's president but, in the power-struggle following Mondlane's death, his presidency was contested. In April 1969 his leadership was replaced by a triumvirate comprising the Marxist hardliners Samora Machel and Marcelino dos Santos as well as Simango. The late 1960s FRELIMO was blighted by fratricidal infighting with a number of party members dying of unnatural causes. See also. The triumvirate did not last; Simango was expelled from the Central Committee in November 1969, and Samora Machel and Marcelino dos Santos assumed total control. In April 1970, Simango left for Egypt
where, with other dissidents like Paulo Gumane (Frelimo's founding vice-General Secretary), he became a leader of COREMO, another small liberation movement. 
After the Portuguese Carnation Revolution in 1974, Simango returned to Mozambique and established a new political party "National Coalition Party" (PCN) in the hope of contesting elections with FRELIMO. He was joined in the PCN by other prominent figures of the Liberation movement and the FRELIMO dissidents: Paulo Gumane and Adelino Gwambe (also a founder member of FRELIMO), Father Mateus Gwengere and Joana Simeao. 
FRELIMO opposed multi-party elections. The post-1974 Portuguese government handed over sole power to FRELIMO and Mozambique gained its independence on June 25, 1975. Samora Machel and Marcelino dos Santos took over as its first President and Vice-President. Graca Machel was appointed minister of Education
and Joaquim Chissano its Foreign minister. Uria Simango was arrested and forced to make a 20-page public confession on May 12, 1975, at the FRELIMO base in Nachingwea recanting and requesting re-education. His forced confession (in Portuguese) may be heard on-line. Simango and the remainder of the PCN leadership never regained freedom. Simango, Gumane, Simeao, Gwambe, Gwengere and others were all secretly liquidated at some undetermined date during 1977-1980. Neither the place of burial nor manner of their execution have ever been disclosed by the authorities. Simango's wife, Celina Simango was also separately executed sometime after 1981, and no details or dates for her death are on public record in her case either. 
From the late 1970s, a bloody insurgency by RENAMO (Mozambique National Resistance) plunged the country into a devastating civil war. RENAMO was initially formed by the Rhodesian regime, but from 1980, in its most brutal phase, was sponsored by the Apartheid regime of South Africa: the insurgency in the 1980 was associated with widespread atrocities against civilians. Economic collapse and famine ensued, worsened by drought in the early 1980s. Following the death of Samora Machel in 1986, Joaquim Chissano gradually steered Mozambique back to a peace accord with RENAMO in 1992 
and the restoration of democracy. Multi-party elections were finally held in 1994, twenty years after Simango's ill-fated PCN opposition party.
Simango's public recantation.
Following his arrest (and abduction from Malawi) Simango was obliged to read out a 20-page forced public recantation 
in front of thousands of FRELIMO fighters.
Simango's confession includes utterly implausible claims, accusing colleagues of being agents of Portuguese secret services, and of involvement in Mondlane's murder, which are no longer seriously credited, even among the present Mozambican leadership.
[[File:Simangoconfession.jpg|thumb|300px|Marcelino dos Santos, Samora Machel, next to the captives Paulo Gumane and Uria Simango in Nachingwea on May 11, 1975, prior to hearing Simango's forced confession on the next day. Simango and Gumane were both 
subsequently liquidated. ]]
Mozambique's lost opposition.
The exact circumstances and motivation for the wholesale liquidation of the PCN in the late 1970s and early 1980s has never been officially investigated by the post-1994 Mozambican authorities. 
The Rev. Simango had no connection with RENAMO having been imprisoned before its formation. It is also doubtful, given his pacifist leanings that he would have supported the abuses of civilians during that very brutal insurrection. He may nevertheless have been perceived by FRELIMO as a dangerous rallying point. This view is espoused by Rothwell in 2004 
"Dos Santos, a man loathed by Mondlane became vice-president.
Simango was later captured, interned and then secretly executed
in October 1979, an execution ordered by FRELIMO to prevent
him being used as a figurehead by the then emergent
rebel movement RENAMO. For many years the Frelimo government
did not acknowledge the extrajudicial killing of its former
members and even led his relatives to believe that he was still
alive".
Brief comments on the executions, in the context of human rights violation in this period in Mozambique, appear also in Maier 1992
President Samora Machel died in 1986. Few members of the 1975-1986
regime have commented publicly on the death of Simango; one notable exception is the hardliner vice-President Marcelino dos Santos who has spoken quite forthrightly; in a TV interview in 2005 he explained why the executions were kept secret 
" Because one must see that at that moment, and naturally, while we ourselves felt the validity of revolutionary justice, the one built and fertilised by the armed struggle of national liberation, there existed, nonetheless, the fact that one had already formed a state, albeit one
where FRELIMO was the fundamental power. So it was that, perhaps, which
led us, knowing precisely that many people would not be able to comprehend things well, to prefer to keep silent. But let me say clearly that we do not regret these acts because we acted with revolutionary violence against traitors and traitors against the Mozambican people".
As there was no judicial process, it remains unclear what prompted the charge of treason. On his return to Mozambique in 1974, according to his biographer Ncomo, as leader of the PCN, Simango held tentative talks with white settler parties, in a bid to garner strategic support against one-party rule. This pressaged a settlement like that negotiated five-years later in the
Lancaster House Agreement for multi-party elections in Zimbabwe but, in 1974, it was viewed as treasonous by Frelimo hardliners. 
Joana Simeao and Lazaro Kavandame, two of the executed political prisoners, had fled and surrendered to the Portuguese colonial authorities before 1974 (the latter in fear of his life). But not Simango, Gumane or Gwengere who had simply moved to the rival Liberation movement COREMO. The strategic reason for executing Celina Simango, not a prominent political figure, years later in 1982, is even less clear. What the executed leaders had in common was membership of the 1974 opposition party (PCN) and the attempt to challenge FRELIMO hegemony and one-party rule through multiparty elections. 
In 2006, Joana Simeao's husband, wishing to remarry after 30 years but unable to prove his status as a widower, sued her for desertion. Joana Simeao was defended against the charge of marital desertion by a government tribunal as there is still no official acknowledgment of her death
or of Simango's.

List of Flashpoint episodes

The following is a list of episodes for the Canadian drama series "Flashpoint", which aired on CTV in Canada and was on CBS in the United States before changing networks part way through the fourth season to ION Television. Its first episode was aired on July 11, 2008.
Flashpoint follows the lives of several operators working for an elite police tactical unit known as Strategic Response Unit, which is called in by regular police to resolve situations beyond their control.
In December 2008, only nine of the 13 episodes produced during the series' first season had been aired in North America, although all 13 episodes had been aired by New Zealand's TVNZ (TV2) as of December 10, 2008. In North America, the four remaining episodes of Season 1 were aired in January and February 2009; in North America, CBS and CTV initially billed these episodes as part of Season 2, rather than as part of their intended season, Season 1, as was done in international markets.
Eighteen new 2009 episodes were ordered by CTV and CBS (the original 13 ordered by CTV on August 25, 2008 plus 5 additional episodes that were ordered on November 19, 2008). The first nine of these new episodes, combined with the four holdover episodes from 2008 were aired as Season 2 in North America. The remaining nine episodes, although originally filmed for Season 2, were aired as "Season 3" beginning September 25, 2009 in Canada (CTV), however CTV later corrected their online episode guide to report the seasons as produced rather than initially aired. The correction also holds for the DVD releases of "Season 2, Volume 1" and "Season 2, Volume 2". The last nine episodes of Season 2 began airing on June 4, 2010 in the United States (CBS) and were shown in a different order from their original broadcast on CTV. CBS, however, is erroneously referring to these episodes as "Season 3". A 13-episode third season was produced in Toronto from January to May, 2010 and began airing in July 2010 on both CTV and CBS.
The fourth season of "Flashpoint" premiered July 8, 2011 on CTV. The fifth season of "Flashpoint", which will bring it to 75 episodes, was announced by Bell Media on June 1, 2011.
Season 5 began filming in 2012. It was announced in May 2012 that the series would be ending at the end of its fifth season.
In the following tables, the episodes are listed by their official seasons per CTV episode lists and Canadian DVD releases, and include the original airdates in North America. Note that in a few instances Flashpoint episodes have been broadcast out of their production order by CTV, CBS, and ION.

International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation

The International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation (sometimes League of Nations Committee on Intellectual Cooperation) was an advisory organization for the League of Nations which aimed to promote international cultural/intellectual exchange between scientists, researchers, teachers, artists and other intellectuals. It was established in 1922, and counted such distinguished members as Henri Bergson, Albert Einstein, Marie Curie, Béla Bartók, Thomas Mann, Salvador de Madariaga, and Paul Valéry.
Unable to secure the funding required to maintain a significant office in Geneva, the organization was offered assistance from France to establish an executive branch (the International Institute of Intellectual Cooperation) in Paris in 1926.
The ICIC worked closely with the International Educational Cinematographic Institute ("Istituto Internazionale del Cinema Educatore") created in Rome in 1928 by the Italian government.
Its work continued until 1946, when its role was taken over by UNESCO.

Casón del Buen Retiro

The Casón del Buen Retiro is an annex of the Museo del Prado complex in Madrid. Following major restoration work, which was completed in October 2007, it now houses the Museum's study centre (the Escuela del Prado) and library.
Picasso's "Guernica" canvas, and the sketches associated with its creation, were on display at the Casón from 1981, when it was delivered to Spain from New York's Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), to 1992, when it was moved to its current permanent location in a purpose-built gallery at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía.
History.
Located in front of the Puerta de Felipe IV entrance to the west side of the Retiro Park, the Casón was originally built as the ballroom, the "Salón de Baile", of the Buen Retiro Palace, of which now only two buildings, the Casón and the Salón de Reinos which, until it was moved to the Alcázar de Toledo in 2010, housed the Museo del Ejército (Army Museum), still remain.
The artistic importance of Luca Giordano's "The Allegory of the Golden Fleece", on the ceiling of the Casón, commissioned by King Charles II of Spain (ca.1697), and considered one of the masterpieces of the Prado, is one of the possible reasons given for the building having survived when most of the other buildings in the Bueno Retiro palace complex were knocked down.
From 1877 to 1960 the Casón was used as the Museo de Reproducciones Artísticas, set up by the then President of the Government, Antonio Canovas del Castillo, until it was moved to the Museo de América. The building was then used as a temporary exhibition space until 1971. From 1971 to 1981 it was used by the Museo del Prado for the 19th-century collections paintings and sculptures which had formerly been in the Museo de Arte Moderno and from 1981 to 1992, when it was moved to the Museo Reina Sofía, the Casón housed Picasso’s "Guernica" painting.
Library.
The library of the Museo del Prado, on the ground floor of the Casón building, consists of the Reading Room for the use of researchers, the museum's technical staff and students of the Escuela del Prado, and the book stores located in the basements. It comprises some 70,000 books, including those acquired from two private collections, those of José María Cervelló and of the Daza-Madrazo family, the latter mostly books belonging to the painter José de Madrazo, director of the Museo del Prado from 1838 to 1851.

From 1997 to 2007, the Casón was closed for re-modelling and enlargement. Works included the excavation of two new floors, resulting in almost double the pre-existing surface area.

Sleepless Nights (Patty Loveless album)

Sleepless Nights is the fifteenth album by American country music artist Patty Loveless. The album was released on September 9, 2008 (see 2008 in country music). Her first album for the Sagauaro Road Records label, it is also her first studio album since "Dreamin' My Dreams" in 2005. "Sleepless Nights" comprises cover versions of traditional classic country music songs. "Why Baby Why", a song originally recorded by George Jones which has also been a chart hit for several other artists, was released in September 2008 as the first single from the album.
Critical reception.
Allmusic critic Thom Jurek gave "Sleepless Nights" a four-star rating out of five, saying "Loveless takes each of these cuts deep into the well of her heart and let's them rip." Jurek also said that Emory Gordy, Jr., Loveless' husband and producer, "showers songs in emotion and Loveless simply needs to open her mouth to tell the story behind the words to get it across to the listener, where it resonates deeply."
Matt C., a critic for The 9513, also gave the album a four-out-of-five rating. He described "Sleepless Nights" as "a thoroughly arresting listening experience, as Loveless lays twenty-first century gloss, if not sensibilities, on a few songs that haven’t been dusted off in quite some time." Although he criticized the album's lack of up-tempo songs and felt that some of the covers were "uncomfortable", he nonetheless commended Loveless for "find her wheelhouse on songs that are no-less classic but nonetheless haven’t achieved corner bar ubiquity", also saying "The success of these songs is equal testament to Loveless’ outstanding country voice and the timeless quality of the material she’s selected."
"Slant Magazine" critic Jonathan Keefe also criticized the album for its lack up-tempo material, but gave it four-and-a-half stars out of five, saying "Loveless has offered another unqualified masterpiece with "Sleepless Nights" and reasserted her place as one of the premier artists not just of the country genre but of contemporary popular music."

He previously played in MLB for the Colorado Rockies from 2008 through 2013. He represented the United States in the 2008 Summer Olympics as a member of the United States national baseball team.
Baseball career.
Colorado Rockies.
Fowler was drafted by the Colorado Rockies in the 14th round of the 2004 Major League Baseball Draft out of Milton High School in Alpharetta, Georgia. He rejected offers from Harvard and the University of Miami in order to play for the Rockies. In 2008, he was selected by Major League Baseball to play in the All-Star Futures Game at Yankee Stadium
Fowler was batting .337 with nine home runs, 61 RBI and 20 stolen bases for the Rockies' Double-A Texas League affiliate, the Tulsa Drillers, when he took a break from his minor league season in order to represent the United States in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. He and the U.S. team ended up winning the bronze medal in the Olympics by defeating Japan, 8-4, in the bronze medal game.
Fowler was called up to the Major Leagues for the first time on September 2, 2008. He made his debut that same day in a 6-5 extra innings home win over the San Francisco Giants, coming in as a pinch runner in the bottom of the 10th inning; he was subsequently picked off at first base. In Fowler's first at-bat in the bottom of the third inning of a 9-2 home loss against the Giants the following day, he flew out to right field.
On September 10, 2008, Fowler recorded his first hit, an infield single, off of Will Ohman in the top of the seventh inning of a 9-5 road loss against the Atlanta Braves.

The Pope notes that true, peace has not yet arrived but the Armistice has suspended the slaughter and devastation by land, sea and air. 1 It is now the obligation of all Catholics on all sides to invoke Divine assistance for all who take part in the peace conference. The delegates who are to meet to define peace need all the support they can get for their search of a lasting peace.

<doc id="18424633" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18424633" title="Tele-Arena">
Tele-Arena

Tele-Arena is an online multiplayer fantasy RPG developed in the 1990s by Sean Ferrell for the MajorBBS bulletin board system. Tele-Arena is a BBS Game Module similar to a MUD. This module can only be played on MajorBBS or Worldgroup BBS software. The game uses a text-based interface whereby the player enters text commands for their character to execute and receives a text response of the outcome.
The rights to Tele-Arena's gameplay, descriptions, and source code for Major BBS/Worldgroup were sold by Sean Ferrell to Elwynor Technologies in 2005. If the game is ported to other platforms without substantial additions or changes, Sean Ferrell would receive additional royalties. However, Sean Ferrell does not control rights to the intellectual property any longer.
Character Creation.
Upon entering Tele-Arena for the first time players are asked to create their character. Under normal configuration, only one Tele-Arena character can be created for each MajorBBS account.
Races.
There are six races of denizens in Tele-Arena.
Elves.
Elves are a long lived, attractive and intelligent race. Because of this, they make the best choice for a spell caster.
Dwarves.
Dwarves are small, hardy, tough and skilled in combat. They make pretty good fighters and can also hold their own as a spellcaster. Dwarfves are slightly more resistant to poisoning than are the other classes.
Gnomes.
Gnomes are somewhat agile, much more heartier than elves, and make fair spellcasters. They are a sort of ‘middle man’ as far as the races go. They do equally well as spellcasters or as fighters.
Humans.
Humans are the real ‘average’, and are equally suited to any of the classes. Unlike any of the other classes, humans get a ‘luck’ bonus that works erratically. Sometimes their ‘luck’ means an easy kill, sometimes it means more vitality when training for a higher level.
Goblins.
Goblins are quite cunning and agile, making the best rogues. They are also shunned by the other races because of their sneaky nature and ugliness. Goblin rogues are the only characters in Tele-Arena that may have six attacks before promoting. They are also the only characters that may have three attacks at level one with the appropriate stats. Goblins make slightly inferior warriors than half-ogres until they receive their sixth attack. The sixth attack a goblin receives more than makes up for the extra physical power of the half-ogre.
Half-Ogres.
Half-Ogres are the toughest of the lot. They are also the dumbest. What they lack in brain power, they easily make up for in sheer physical force and brute strength. They make the very best warriors until promotion.
Classes.
There are sixteen classes in original Tele-Arena: eight starting classes and eight advanced classes. Each class can be promoted to an advanced class when the user has reached a high enough level and pays the required fee of 1000 gold crowns. After the player is promoted, their level goes back to one and experience to zero. The player is given a new title as well as an increase in statistics making leveling the promoting class a dozen levels or so quite easy after the initial promotion.
More recent versions of Tele-Arena add an additional eight doubly promoted classes for a total of twenty four classes.
Warrior / Knight / Champion.
Warriors are the ‘tough’ guys of Tele-Arena. They may wear any armor and wield any melee weapons in the game. The only weapons a warrior cannot use are ranged weapons; 
weapons that fire from a distance. A Warrior may be promoted to a Knight, and doubly promoted to a Champion.
Sorcerer / Arch Magus / Celestial Magus.
Sorcerers cast very powerful offensive spells at high levels, but are extremely vulnerable to attack at low levels. They may only wear robes and wield a staff. Sorcerers also get several ‘utility’ spells such as magical armor, raising or lowering ability stats and summoning various types of creatures. Sorcerers, because of their low physical attributes and poor choice of weapons and armor, are the hardest class to play. A Sorcerer may be promoted to an Arch Magus, and doubly promoted to a Celestial Magus.
Acolyte / High Priest / Avatar.
Acolytes, or ‘ackies’ as they are known, are fairly adept at physical combat. They have the advantage of being able to cast healing and curative spells on themselves and others. An 
acolyte may only wear up to platemail armor and wield only weapons that have no edges such as maces, morningstars, flails, etc. An acolyte may be promoted to a High Priest, and doubly promoted to an Avatar.
Rogue / Blackguard / Assassin.
Rogues can fight better the sorcerers, but are a poor match against warriors. They may wear any ‘unrestrictive’ armor and wield staves and one-handed blade weapons. Rogues also have several special abilities like picking locks, avoiding traps and robbing other players of gold. In a fight, the rogue can sometimes score bonus damage doing a ‘skillful’ attack, not unlike a ‘back-stabbing’ attack in other fantasy role-playing games. A Rogue may be promoted to a Blackguard, and doubly promoted to an Assassin.
Hunter / Beast Master / Naturalist.
Hunters are as good at physical combat as warriors, however they may only wear ‘unrestrictive’ armors and wield a slightly smaller variety of weapons than the warrior. Hunters have several special abilities such as being able to track others, hunt for food and water, tame wild beasts and ‘mesmerize’ a monster so that it doesn’t attack. A Hunter may be promoted to a Beast Master, and doubly promoted to a Naturalist.
Druid / Arch Druid / Grand Druid.
Druids may wield all the same weapons acolytes can, but may only wear up to leather cuirass for armor. They are able to cast spells of the elements, cure hunger and thirst, charm 
creatures and cast small heal spells. The druid is a very nice ‘all around’ character but at lower levels they are extremely vulnerable to attack. A Druid may be promoted to an Arch Druid, and doubly promoted to a Grand Druid.
Archer / Master Archer / Elite Archer.
Archers may wear ‘unrestrictive’ armors and wield only a limited range of melee weapons. The only special ability of this class is its ability to use ranged weapons such as bows, crossbows, slings, etc. When an attacker closes the range, an archer must unequip his/her ranged weapon and equip a melee weapon. This tends to make this class rather awkward in combat situations. An Archer may be promoted to a Master Archer, and doubly promoted to an Elite Archer.
Necrolyte / Necromancer / Heretic.
Necrolytes are the exact opposites of acolytes. They practice the darkest forms of magic. They get the same choices of armor and weapons as do sorcerers, but are not very skilled 
in physical combat. A Necrolyte’s strength lies in his/her ability to cast powerful attack spells at low levels. They also have the ability to heal themselves which lets them solo whereas a sorcerer cannot. Necrolytes were not part of the original Tele-Arena release but were added in later updates. A Necrolyte may be promoted to a Necromancer, and doubly promoted to a Heretic.
Arenas.
Each town contains a battle arena where players can summon a monster by ringing a bell.
Runes.
Players can collect permanent items called Runes, each with a different color, that allow them to access advanced parts of the game. Each rune is collected in a specific order, with each new rune replacing the previous one. Runes are collected in a variety of ways. Often, the player (or someone in the group) must kill a monster to gain access to a treasure room where the rune can be obtained. Also, some runes may only be collected by one person on the BBS per day.
Spells.
Magic users have the ability to cast spells. There is a separate physical attack delay and a magic casting delay. A player may cast a spell every round depending on his or her level. In order to cast a spell of a specified mana X every round, use the equation: required_level = (X - 1) * 5.
Below is a list of all the known Tele-Arena spells.
Maps.
A number of ANSI-based maps have been produced for the original Tele-Arena, which together compose the entire world map.

Pulmonary hematoma

A pulmonary hematoma is a collection of blood within the tissue of the lung. It may result when a pulmonary laceration fills with blood. A lung laceration filled with air is called a pneumatocele. In some cases, both pneumatoceles and hematomas exist in the same injured lung. Pulmonary hematomas take longer to heal than simple pneumatoceles and commonly leave the lungs scarred. A pulmonary contusion is another cause of bleeding within the lung tissue, but these result from microhemorrhages, multiple small bleeds, and the bleeding is not a discrete mass but rather occurs within the lung tissue. An indication of more severe damage to the lung than pulmonary contusion, a hematoma also takes longer to clear. Unlike contusions, hematomas do not usually interfere with gas exchange in the lung, but they do increase the risk of infection and abscess formation.

<doc id="18424688" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18424688" title="Language of adoption">
Language of adoption

The language of adoption is changing and evolving, and since the 1970s has been a controversial issue tied closely to adoption reform efforts. The controversy arises over the use of terms which, while designed to be more appealing or less offensive to some persons affected by adoption, may simultaneously cause offense or insult to others. This controversy illustrates the problems in adoption, as well as the fact that coining new words and phrases to describe ancient social practices will not necessarily alter the feelings and experiences of those affected by them. Two of the contrasting sets of terms are commonly referred to as positive adoption language (PAL) (sometimes referred to "respectful adoption language (RAL)"), and honest adoption language (HAL).
Positive Adoption Language.
In the 1970s, as adoption search and support organizations developed, there were challenges to the language in common use at the time. The term "natural mother" had been in common use previously. The term "birth mother" was first used in 1956 by Pearl S. Buck. As books like "Adoption Triangle" by Sorosky, Pannor and Baran were published, and support groups formed like CUB (Concerned United Birthparents), a major shift from natural parent to birthparent occurred. Along with the change in times and social attitudes came additional examination of the language used in adoption.
Social workers and other professionals in the field of adoption began changing terms of use to reflect what was being expressed by the parties involved. In 1979, Marietta Spencer, wrote "The Terminology of Adoption" for The Child Welfare League of America (CWLA), which was the basis for her later work "Constructive Adoption Terminology". This influenced Pat Johnston's "Positive Adoption Language" (PAL) and "Respectful Adoption Language" (RAL). The terms contained in "Positive Adoption Language" include the terms "birth mother" (to replace the terms "natural mother" and "real mother"), "placing" (to replace the term "surrender"). 
Language at its best, honors the self-referencing choices of the persons involved, utilizes inclusive terms and phrases, and is sensitive to the feelings of the primary parties. Language evolves with social attitudes and experiences. The example below is one of the earliest and it should be noted that these lists, too, have evolved and changed some over the years. 
"The reasons for its use": Some terms like birth parents, birth mother, birth father were chosen by those working in adoption reform as terms to replace 'natural' and it took nearly a decade before agencies, social workers, courts and laws embraced the change in self-referencing. Some adoptive parents supported this change as they felt using "natural" indicated they were "unnatural". In some cultures, adoptive families face adoptism. This can be evident in English speaking cultures when there is prominent use of negative or inaccurate language describing adoption. So, to combat adoptism, many adoptive families choose the use of positive adoption language.
"The reasons against its use": Some adoptees believe "positive adoption language" creates cognitive dissonance, denies certain realities for the adoptee, & treats the status of being an adopted person as if it is something to be ashamed of by insisting adoption should not be part of their identity. Some birth parents see "positive adoption language" as terminology which glosses over painful facts they face as they go into the indefinite post-adoption period of their lives. They feel PAL has become a way to present adoption in the friendliest light possible, in order to obtain even more infants for adoption; i.e., a sales and marketing tool. Some feel the social work system has negatively compromised the intention of the birth family references and other terms, so that either the initial intent needs to be honored, or the terminology must again change.
Honest adoption language.
"Honest Adoption Language" refers to a set of terms that reflect the point of view that: (1) family relationships (social, emotional, psychological or physical) that existed prior to the legal adoption continue, and that (2) mothers who have "voluntarily surrendered" children to adoption (as opposed to involuntary terminations through court-authorized child-welfare proceedings) seldom view it as a choice that was freely made, but instead describe scenarios of powerlessness, lack of resources, and overall lack of choice. It also reflects the point of view that the term "birth mother" is derogatory in implying that the woman has ceased being a mother after the physical act of giving birth. Proponents of HAL liken this to the mother being treated as a "breeder" or "incubator". Terms included in HAL include the original terms that were used before PAL, including "natural mother", "Mother" and "surrendered for adoption."
"The reasons for its use": In most cultures, the adoption of a child does not change the identities of its mother and father: they continue to be referred to as such. Those who adopted a child were thereafter termed its "guardians," "foster," or "adoptive" parents. Some people choose to use "Honest Adoption Language" (HAL) because it reflects the original terminology. Some of those directly affected by adoption separation believe these terms more accurately reflect important but hidden and/or ignored realities of adoption. They feel this language also reflects continuing connection and does not exclude further contact.
"The reasons against its use": The term "Honest" implies that all other language used in adoption is dishonest. HAL does not honor the historical aspects of the early adoption reform movement who requested and worked years to have terminology changed from natural to birth. Some adoptive parents feel disrespected by language like 'natural parent' because it can indicate they are unnatural.
Inclusive Adoption Language.
There are supporters of various lists, developed over many decades, and there are persons who find them lacking, created to support an agenda, or furthering division. All terminology can be used to demean or diminish, uplift or embrace. In addressing the linguistic problem of naming, Edna Andrews says that using "inclusive" and "neutral" language is based upon the concept that "language represents thought, and may even control thought."
Advocates of inclusive language defend it as inoffensive-language usage whose goal is multi-fold:
A common problem is that terms chosen by an identity group, as acceptable descriptors of themselves, can be then used in negative ways by detractors. This compromises the integrity of the language and turns what was intended to be positive into negative or vice-versa, thus often devaluing acceptability, meaning and use. 
In this evolving debate about which terms are acceptable in any era, there can be disagreements within the group itself. To be inclusive requires that no group ascribes to others what they must call themselves. Words and phrases must reflect mutual respect and honor the individual choice. 
Inclusive adoption language is far more than an aesthetic matter of identity imagery that one embraces or rejects; it can focus the fundamental issues and ideals of social justice. Language that is truly inclusive affirms the humanity of all the people involved, and shows respect for difference. Words have the power to communicate hospitality or hostility, to exploit and exclude, as well as affirm and liberate. Inclusive language honors that each individual has a right to determine for themselves what self-referencing term is comfortable and best reflects their personal identity.

Benedict Groeschel

Benedict Joseph Groeschel, C.F.R. (born July 23, 1933) is a Catholic priest, retreat master, author, psychologist, activist and former host of the television talk program "Sunday Night Prime", which is broadcast on the Eternal Word Television Network. He has also hosted several serial religious specials in addition to Sunday Night Prime. He is the founder of the Office for Spiritual Development for the Catholic Archdiocese of New York as well as a former associate director of Trinity Retreat and a former executive director of the St. Francis House. He is professor of pastoral psychology at St. Joseph's Seminary in New York and an adjunct professor at the Institute for Psychological Sciences in Arlington, Virginia. He is one of the founders of the Franciscan Friars of the Renewal.
Early life and education.
Born Robert Peter Groeschel in Jersey City, New Jersey, he entered the Detroit province of Capuchin order in 1951. The following year, he was admitted to temporary profession of vows and given the name Benedict Joseph (after Benedict Joseph Labre). He made his perpetual profession in 1954 and was ordained a priest in 1959. He received a master's degree in counseling from Iona College in 1964 and a doctorate of education (Ed.D.) in psychology from Teachers College, Columbia University in 1971.
Career.
In 1960, Groeschel became the chaplain for the Children’s Village, a Dobbs Ferry, New York based facility for emotionally disturbed children. In 1965, he joined the staff of St. Joseph's Seminary and has taught classes at Fordham University, Iona College and Maryknoll Seminary. In 1967, he founded The St. Francis House in Brooklyn, New York, which provides a safe haven for young men looking for a new start in life. The results of his counseling, teaching ability and the manner in which he treated his subjects attracted the attention of many, including Terence Cooke, then Archbishop of New York. In 1974, at the request of Cardinal Cooke, he founded the Trinity Retreat in Larchmont, New York, which provides spiritual direction and retreats for clergy. In 1984, New York's Cardinal Archbishop John Joseph O'Connor appointed Groeschel to the position of promoter of the cause of canonization of the Servant of God Terence Cooke.
In 1985, he co-founded with Christopher Bell the Good Counsel Homes for homeless pregnant women and children. In 1987, Groeschel and seven Capuchin colleagues left their order to begin the Franciscan Friars of the Renewal with the mission of preaching reform and serving the poor. Since joining the Institute of Psychological Sciences in 2000, he has taught an annual intensive course focused on how to give practical assistance to people experiencing trauma, extreme stress, and sorrow - while at the same time integrating religious values with counseling and psychotherapy.
Groeschel is Chairman of the St. Francis House and the Good Counsel Homes. He is on the board of Ave Maria University in Naples, Florida and is a member of the American Psychological Association. Other works of charity that Groeschel is involved with are the Padre Pio Shelter, St. Anthony Residence, St. Francis Youth Center and St. Benedict Joseph Medical Center in Honduras.
Author and activist.
Groeschel has received wide public attention through his preaching engagements, writing and television appearances. He is the author of over 30 books and has recorded more than 100 audio and video series. He publishes articles in several Catholic magazines on a monthly basis and posts a weekly meditation on the Oratory of Divine Love website. His most recent books include "The Tears of God" (2008), "Questions and Answers About Your Journey to God" (2007), "The Virtue Driven Life" (2006), "Why Do We Believe?" (2005) and "There Are No Accidents: In All Things Trust in God" (2004). His weekly television program, "Sunday Night Live with Father Benedict Groeschel", offers a mix of interviews, answering viewer questions and discussing spiritual and social matters relating to the Catholic faith.
Groeschel has also been a highly visible Catholic activist, first in the civil rights movement. He publicly criticizes insulting depictions of the church in popular culture and the media. In September 1998, he led protests outside of an Off-Broadway theater in New York City against the production of Terrence McNally’s play "Corpus Christi". In his 2002 book, "From Scandal to Hope", he accused "The Boston Globe", "The New York Times" and "The San Francisco Chronicle" of revealing anti-Catholic prejudice in their respective coverage of the sexual abuse scandal that disrupted the church. "Seldom in the history of journalism have I seen such virulent attacks on any institution that is supposed to receive fair treatment in the press", he wrote.
In April 2005, he again questioned the anti-Catholic sentiments of the United States media by charging distorted coverage of Joseph Ratzinger, who had become Pope Benedict XVI. Groeschel noted that the new pope had "been very badly abused by the American media", adding that the pontiff’s World War II biography was negatively distorted and incorrect reports of his personality were published.
Car accident.
On January 11, 2004, Groeschel was struck by an automobile while crossing a street in Orlando, Florida. He received a head injury and broken bones, and over a four-hour period, he had no blood pressure, heartbeat or pulse for about 20 minutes. A few days later the trauma triggered a near-fatal heart attack. While he was recovering from his injuries, he collaborated with John Bishop on the book "There Are No Accidents: In All Things Trust in God". He broadcast his first live program on EWTN on October 24, 2004. Although the accident left him with limited use of his right arm and difficulty in walking, he was back preaching and giving retreats by the end of 2004 and has continued to keep a full schedule. As he told the "New York Times" nearly four years after his accident: “They said I would never live. I lived. They said I would never think. I think. They said I would never walk. I walked. They said I would never dance, but I never danced anyway.”
Comments on sexual abuse.
Groeschel made controversial comments in a 2012 interview published by the "National Catholic Register" on August 27 related to the sexual abuse of children by priests: "Suppose you have a man having a nervous breakdown, and a youngster comes after him. A lot of the cases, the youngster — 14, 16, 18 — is the seducer." On August 30 he issued a statement:
The Franciscan Friars of the Renewal organization also apologized for Groeschel's remarks, noting that they were out of character for him and stemmed from infirmities due to his 2004 car accident and a recent stroke. On September 3, EWTN announced that Groeschel had resigned from his position as host of "Sunday Night Prime" and that other members of his order would serve as the show's host. Following his resignation, Groeschel's radio and TV programs were removed from EWTN's online archive.

Stikine-LeConte Wilderness

The Stikine-LeConte Wilderness is on the mainland of southeast Alaska, southeast of Petersburg and north of Wrangell, Alaska. The boundary extends from Frederick Sound on the west to the Alaska-Canada boundary on the east. The wilderness is in size. It is part of Tongass National Forest, which is managed by the United States Forest Service.
Description.
One of the major features of this area is the Stikine River, which flows through the southern portion of the Stikine-LeConte Wilderness. The river valley is relatively narrow. The surrounding mountains are steep, rugged, and contain numerous glaciers. Meltwater from these glaciers has a high silt content, giving the Stikine River a milky appearance. The river delta is highly braided with three main navigable channels. Two warm and one hot springs are found along the river. North of the Stikine River area is the LeConte Glacier, which flows into LeConte Bay. LeConte Glacier is the southernmost glacier in North America that flows directly into salt water. Mountains in the area of LeConte Bay are steep and most of the upper valleys are glacier-filled. Glaciers and ice fields cover most of the rugged, mountainous area in the eastern part of the Stikine-LeConte Wilderness.
Alpine vegetation, including mosses, lichens, and other small plants, is found at the upper elevations. The lower mountain slopes near salt water support a dense spruce-hemlock rainforest. Closer to the Canadian border, the rain decreases and the vegetation changes to stands of cottonwood. Cottonwood are also common on the many islands of the Stikine. The valley floor along the river is a combination of muskegs and dense alder and willow thickets. The Stikine River delta is approximately wide and consists of grass flats, tidal marsh, and sand bars.
Much of the area, particularly the Stikine River drainage, is recognized as an important fish and wildlife area. Moose, mountain goats, brown bear and black bear, deer, and wolves inhabit the area. The delta flats of the Stikine River are a major resting and nesting area for migratory birds. A variety of fish, including king and other species of salmon, are found in the waters of the area. Up to 2000 eagles congregate in the mouth of the river, following a run of smelt.

<doc id="18424778" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18424778" title="Black Ice (album)">
Black Ice (album)

Black Ice is the fifteenth international studio album by the Australian hard rock band AC/DC. It was produced by Brendan O'Brien and released internationally on 17 October 2008. It marked the band's first original recordings since 2000's "Stiff Upper Lip", with the eight-year gap being the longest between AC/DC's successive studio albums. "Black Ice" has the longest running time of any AC/DC studio album.
The album's development was delayed because bass guitarist Cliff Williams sustained an injury and the band changed labels from Elektra Records to Sony Music. The first composing sessions between guitarists/brothers Angus and Malcolm Young were in London in 2003. Recording happened during March and April 2008 at The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, Canada. O'Brien tried to recapture the rock sound of the band's early work, as opposed to the blues orientation of "Ballbreaker" and "Stiff Upper Lip", with suggestions such as adding "soul crooning" to Brian Johnson's singing. The songs were mostly recorded live in the studio; engineer Mike Fraser used only sparse overdubs and effects to keep the tracks as close to the originals as possible.
"Black Ice" was released exclusively in physical formats, as the group did not sell its music digitally at the time. Walmart got exclusive rights to distribute the album in North America. Its release was promoted with an extensive marketing campaign, which included displays of AC/DC memorabilia. The four singles issued from the album were, "Rock 'N' Roll Train", "Big Jack", "Anything Goes", and "Money Made". "Black Ice" peaked at number one in 29 countries, including Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States. It was the second best-selling record of 2008, behind Coldplay's "Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends" and had shipped 6 million copies worldwide by December. Critical reviews were generally positive, praising the music and its resemblance to the classic AC/DC sound, although some critics found the work too long and inconsistent. The track "War Machine" won the Best Hard Rock Performance category at the Grammys. The album itself was nominated for many awards, including the Grammy, Brit, Juno and ARIA Music Awards; and was supported by a world tour between 2008 and 2010.
Production.
"Black Ice" is AC/DC's sixteenth studio album release in Australia and their fifteenth international release. The band took a break after finishing the Stiff Upper Lip World Tour in 2001, and resumed performing in 2003, with eight presentations that included AC/DC's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and they opened three concerts for The Rolling Stones' Licks Tour. During those two years, guitarists Angus Young and Malcolm Young wrote music separately, then met in a London studio to work on new songs.
The production of "Black Ice" was delayed for several reasons. AC/DC left their label Atlantic Records, signed a deal with Sony Music and changed labels within Sony from Epic Records to Columbia Records. Bass guitarist Cliff Williams suffered an injury to his hand in 2005 and was unable to play for 18 months. While Williams was recovering, the Young brothers perfected the songs they had written. Angus revealed that there was no pressure from Sony for the band to release a new album, as the label was releasing DVDs and remasters of the AC/DC catalogue, and thus the group "could afford to sit back and say we'll do another album when we think we've got all the goods." In a 2004 interview, vocalist Brian Johnson said that Angus had written harder riffs than those on "Stiff Upper Lip" and that he would be writing song lyrics for the first time since the band's 1988 album "Blow Up Your Video", but his input would end up minimal, with all tracks on "Black Ice" credited to the Youngs. Johnson explained that the brothers had done most of the lyrical job, and his collaboration was that he "helped with melody and just filling in gaps that I thought needed filling in".
While producer Robert John "Mutt" Lange expressed an interest in working again with AC/DC, his schedule did not allow this. When the Young brothers called Columbia Records' president Steve Barnett to announce the making of a new album, Barnett recommended producer Brendan O'Brien. Angus said the band had considered talking to O'Brien since the 1990s, as "he seemed to us a very competent professional" and because he and Malcolm the band would benefit from working with a producer they had not worked with before.
On 3 March 2008, recording started at The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, where "Stiff Upper Lip" was recorded, and lasted for eight weeks. Engineer Mike Fraser, who has mixed all AC/DC albums since "The Razors Edge", said they recorded in batches of three songs to "keep things interesting" and to avoid overextended sessions. According to Fraser, the band had not rehearsed the songs before entering the studio. Despite "a couple of tweaks in the writing, sparkling up the choruses a bit better" during the recording, the compositions were mostly complete. Still, the Young brothers had new ideas during production, including the song "Anything Goes", which was written when the studio sessions were nearly finished. The songs were mostly recorded live in the studio; the instruments and backing vocals were recorded in the live room and the vocals at both the control room and an overdubbing booth. The performances were first recorded with analogue equipment, as Fraser considers that tape conveys "the sound of rock & roll", and then digitised for mixing and overdubs. Fraser tried to not alter the original recordings – "I used Pro-Tools purely as a tape machine" – with no effects on the bass and rhythm guitar, sparse delay and reverb effects on the vocals and other instruments and overdubs were only used for the lead guitar and vocals.
The first title considered for the album was "Runaway Train". Malcolm suggested using a photograph of a famous 1895 derailment for the cover, but reconsidered after he found that Mr. Big had used it for their album "Lean into It". According to Angus, "Runaway Train" was rejected was because it had been used by many musicians, including Elton John, Tom Petty and Eric Clapton, and he "wanted something unique, new, different". So he suggested "Black Ice", which refers to gigs played during winter in Scotland. He said, "it rolled off the tongue" and it reminded him of "radio warnings up north of black ice." Angus was inspired to write the eponymous song by a similar warning heard on his car radio during production.
Composition.
With "Black Ice", Brendan O'Brien tried to recapture the rock sound of AC/DC's early work on albums such as "Highway to Hell" and "Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap". He thought the two previous studio albums, "Ballbreaker" and "Stiff Upper Lip", were blues-influenced. O'Brien tried to focus on the choruses, which he felt were the best part of the AC/DC songs, and encouraged the band to emphasise the "hooky, melodic side" of its song-writing, which Angus complimented, since he had "never been great with harmonies". Mike Fraser said the band aimed "towards "The Razors Edge" era, a little bit more up-tempo stuff." O'Brien made suggestions about the band's performance, got Angus to play slide guitar on "Stormy May Day", and told Johnson to swap some screaming for "soul crooning" as Johnson was a soul singer. Johnson was worried that the rest of the band would think this did not suit the band's style of hard rock and roll, but the band was quite receptive. Because of the highly demanding singing style, Johnson only recorded his vocals for one hour a day. The rhythm section continues the basic structure from other AC/DC records; Cliff Williams played bass lines of eighth notes, and Phil Rudd's drumming was a consistent 4/4 time, mostly on his snare, kick drum and hi-hat cymbal. Both musicians expressed contentment with their roles in the band; Rudd said, "I'm not repressing skills. Most drummers are scared to try this", and Williams admitted he plays "the same thing in every song, for the most part", but added "n AC/DC's music, the song is more important than any individual's bit in it".
Angus said that when composing with Malcolm they share ideas to make each track "work together" to form a complete album, and Johnson added "these songs belong together. It's about five boys having a damn good time in a studio." With 15 songs and a running time of over 55 minutes, "Black Ice" has the longest running time of any AC/DC studio record. Malcolm said that "about 60 or 70 song ideas" were developed, but Angus stated that most were discarded because they were not "representative of how we are". Angus also said that the first attempt to sequence the album resulted in a track list comprising eleven songs, "but as the days went by each band member voted for a new track, and then another, and other one" so they decided to include all the recorded tracks.
Most of the album's tracks are about rock and roll itself–Angus stated, "Certain songs just seem to come to life when you add that phrase". However, other themes served as inspiration. "Money Made" is a criticism on how, according to Angus, in the US "everything is money these days". "War Machine" was based on a documentary on Hannibal, which led to the conclusion that the military has not changed since Ancient Rome. "Wheels" tells about Johnson's passion for motorcars. He described the album's release as the "best one we've done", he felt that while "Back in Black" was great for its time, "Black Ice" shows the band's versatility. Angus also said he admired the album's diversity, saying "It is sufficiently varied to please people in varied moods".
Release and promotion.
On 18 August 2008, Columbia Records announced that "Black Ice" would be released on 20 October in the US, and began accepting pre-orders. "Rock 'n' Roll Train" was issued as the first single from the album on 28 August; "Big Jack" and "Anything Goes" followed in some markets, and "Money Made" was an airplay single in Australia and the United Kingdom. The track "Spoilin' for a Fight", was used by the WWE as the theme song for its 2008 Survivor Series event, and "War Machine" would later be included in both a trailer for 2010's "Iron Man 2" and the film's soundtrack album.
The CD version was also available in a hardcover, deluxe edition with a 30-page booklet containing exclusive new illustrations, studio and live photographs of the group and lyrics. A limited edition steel-box version, containing the CD, a 20-page colour booklet, a DVD featuring the "Rock 'n' Roll Train" video and a making of documentary, a large AC/DC flag, five stickers and a Gibson guitar pick, was issued in Germany and the United Kingdom in December. The album was released as a double LP on two 180-gram discs in a gatefold package featuring the standard red lettering artwork on the front. The LP was sold through the official website and through independent record shops in the US. An unknown number of copies of the vinyl version were incorrectly pressed; side 1B had tracks from The Clash's "Live at Shea Stadium". "Black Ice" was not issued digitally as the band refused to sell their tracks separately. Angus declared, "If we were on iTunes, we know a certain percentage of people would only download two or three songs from the album – and we don't think that represents us musically." However, the entire album was leaked online a week before the official release. Rumours spread that Sony Music tried to control leaks by releasing fake tracks on peer-to-peer websites.
In North America, Walmart made a deal for the exclusive distribution of "Black Ice", though a few independent music shops ordered copies of the album from foreign outlets. Angus declared that the band chose Walmart because the company is the biggest physical music retailer in America, which they believed to be "the best alternative to iTunes". He also said, "There aren't as many record stores these days, and Walmarts are all over America. New York and Los Angeles and Chicago may be covered, but in the heartland of America, Walmart may be the only gig in town." Walmart created over 3000 "Rock Again AC/DC Stores" with displays showcasing the band's albums, branded clothing, the "No Bull" DVD, the video game "", and products from sponsors. Gary Severson, a Walmart senior vice president, said that AC/DC was one of the rare artists whose loyal fan-base allowed them to display other merchandise along with the music. In October, MTV, Walmart and Columbia created "AC/DC Rock Band Stores" in cities without regular Walmart retail locations–New York's Times Square and Los Angeles. "Black Ice" trucks were dispatched on the streets of these cities after the release, playing tracks and making stops each day to sell merchandise. Advertising agency Arnold Worldwide was awarded both Best Activity Generating Brand Volume by the Marketing Agencies Association, and Best Retail/Co-Marketing Campaign by "Promo Magazine" for "Black Ice"s marketing campaign.
A digital version of "Black Ice" was made available on iTunes, along with the rest of AC/DC's catalogue, on 19 November 2012.
Packaging.
The cover art of "Black Ice" was drawn by Joshua Marc Levy, art director for Columbia and a longtime fan of the band who volunteered for the project among "many people at Sony who desired to work on it". There are four different covers, the standard edition has a red logo, the deluxe edition has a blue logo and two variants to the regular design include yellow or white logos. Angus said the options were not to deliver the message that fans would need to purchase all covers. He said, "We know most people will only purchase the record once, in their colour of choice. For me, it's not relevant. What matters is that fans enjoy it. Music is the essence."
After working with the cover for the album, provisionally titled "Runaway Train", Levy went on vacation and travelled with Pearl Jam on their 2008 tour. After a concert in Washington D.C., Levy came up with the idea "to do it all graphic black on black" and sketched what would became the yellow artwork. The record company liked it and Levy was requested him to do two more in the same style, which became the red and white versions. During the promotional photography sessions, Levy made the deluxe edition art. The tracks on the album did not have much influence on the artwork as Levy had heard "maybe 5 songs at that point", but he found it curious that his artwork fit the title track "Black Ice", which was not among the tracks he had heard. Levy said that since the album had many similarities with "Back in Black" – "Black" in the title, dark covers, and AC/DC resurfacing with a sound based on the band's early work – the art was "like a time travel, which is why there are so many psychedelic drawings". The artwork's resemblance to a train, echoing lead single "Rock N' Roll Train", was a coincidence, given Levy "never thought of it that way". Atop the image there is a cog with an image of Angus with his fist in the air resembling the statue on "Stiff Upper Lip", because Levy "just thought it was great as a continuing icon." The photographs for the booklet and promotional photography were taken by music photographer Guido Karp, in August 2008 in London.
Reception.
Professional reviews.
Critical reviews of "Black Ice" were generally favourable according to Metacritic, which provided a normalised rating of 69 out of 100 based on 24 reviews from mainstream critics. Most reviewers complimented the album's sound, with "The Village Voice"s Richard Bienstock considering that Brendan O'Brien's production restored a sonority closer to the Vanda and Young produced 1970s albums and effective choruses like those with "Mutt" Lange, and Aaron Burgess of "The A.V. Club" finding "Black Ice" the most inspired AC/DC album since "The Razors Edge" while sounding "harder, hungrier, and more relevant than anything on contemporary radio." A common argument was that "Black Ice" succeeded because AC/DC did not want to change the style that succeeded in previous albums, with Bernard Zuel of "The Sydney Morning Herald" declaring that given "almost all of tracklist could have appeared on any AC/DC album of the past 28 years", and Chris Jones of BBC saying that the band's "almost platonic form of rock 'n' boogie that was hand built to last" remains because they "have no reason to tinker with a formula that was well-nigh perfect to begin with." Writers such as "Spin"s David Marchese and "The Observer"s Peter Kimpton complimented the band's attempts at "some new sonic tricks", such as the slide guitar of "Stormy May Day" and the quieter "Decibel".
However, some reviewers found the album inconsistent, overly long or formulaic. "Black Ice" was described as a retread of other AC/DC albums without the same inspiration, with Spence D. of IGN declaring that "the band sounds tight, but very few of the songs actually resonate with that sense of classicism found on much of their earlier efforts", "The Austin Chronicle"'s Austin Powell feeling that despite "a few cheap thrills" the album lacked "the urgent indecency and iron force that defined the Bon Scott era", and Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine considering that after "Big Jack" the tracks went into a "too-comfortable groove, fueled by too-tight rhythms and guitars that sound loud but not beefy". Many complained about the lack of variation, made more flagrant by the long track list. "Entertainment Weekly"s reviewer Clark Collis wrote that "even 2000's fairly monochromatic "Stiff Upper Lip" had more varied material", Brian Hiatt of "Rolling Stone" felt that "Black Ice" "feels longer than its 55 minutes, thanks to a stretch of throwaway rockers", and Robert Forster of "The Monthly" thought that a shorter running time would "maximise the album's impact", given he found the first four songs and the title track the best for sounding more diverse, while the other tracks were let down by poor songwriting and a "numbing predictability".
Chart performance and sales.
"Black Ice" made history by debuting at number one on album charts of 29 countries, and is Columbia Records' biggest debut album since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales data for "Billboard" in March 1991. "Black Ice" was the second best-selling album worldwide in 2008, behind Coldplay's "Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends". As of December 2008, it had shipped 6 million copies worldwide, and earned sales certifications in 24 countries, with multi-platinum status in eight, platinum in twelve more, and gold in the four remaining.

It was AC/DC's second release to top the US charts, after "For Those About to Rock We Salute You" (1981) and became the biggest debut ever by a mainstream hard rock album. As of 31 December 2008, the album had sold 1.915 million copies in the US, according to Nielsen SoundScan, and was certified 2x Platinum by the RIAA. "Black Ice" also debuted at number one on the ARIA Album Charts, selling over 90,000 units, and the UK Album charts, with 110,000 copies sold. It was their first number one in the UK since "Back in Black" (1980).

Black Ice World Tour.
To promote "Black Ice", AC/DC launched the Black Ice World Tour on 28 October 2008 in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Two days earlier; they had held a dress rehearsal in the same city. The tour lasted for 168 shows in 11 legs, with the last in Bilbao, Spain, on 28 June 2010.
Mark Fisher, who had worked on the Stiff Upper Lip World Tour, designed the stage. The set's centrepiece was a full size locomotive, weighing 3500 kg, that was inspired by the working title "Runaway Train" and the track "Rock 'n' Roll Train". Five songs from "Black Ice" were included on the tour's set list; "Rock 'n' Roll Train", "Big Jack", "Black Ice", "War Machine", and "Anything Goes".
The Black Ice World Tour was AC/DC's most successful, grossing $441.6 million, making it the fourth highest-grossing concert tour of all-time.

Finding His Voice

Finding His Voice (1929) is a short film, created as an instructional film on how the Western Electric sound-on-film recording system worked.
Plot.
A live-action hand draws a strip of (sound) film, which takes the form of a human head, who uses musical notes to form a body. Then he sings notes that form a xylophone. Then, he performs a short solo, until another piece of film (silent) jumps on him. The talking strip yells, "Hey, Mute! What's the big idea, ruining my act?" The silent strip uses sign language, with subtitles above, asking him about his voice's origin. He talks about a man named "Dr. Western" that gave him "a set of vocal cords", saying he needs to see him, too.
They go to his office, with "Talkie" telling him to put "'Mutie' through the 'works'." They go to a filming set, where Talkie performs a song named, "Just a Song at Twilight". Then, Dr. Western explains every step of the Western Electric process of sound recording, and Mutie finally earn his voice, as Talkie was performing his song. He jumps onto stage and disrupts his solo. He asks him to calm down, and they perform "Good Night, Ladies" and "Merrily We Roll Along" as they sail on a boat, with an awkward ending of a whale eating the boat and an advertisement for Western Electric.
Production background.
Late in 1926, AT&T and Western Electric created a licensing division, Electrical Research Products Inc. (ERPI), to handle rights to the company's film-related audio technology. (In "Finding His Voice", the credits give W. E. Erpi as the author of the story.)
The Warner Brothers sound-on-disc system Vitaphone still had legal exclusivity, but having lapsed in its royalty payments, effective control of the rights was in ERPI's hands. On December 31, 1926 -- just four months after the premiere of the first Vitaphone feature "Don Juan" -- Warners granted Fox-Case a sublicense for the use of the Western Electric system. In exchange for the sublicense, both Warners and ERPI received a share of Fox's related revenues. The patents of all three concerns were cross-licensed. Superior recording and amplification technology was now available to two Hollywood studios, pursuing two very different methods of sound reproduction. 
Although the film explained the Western Electric sound-on-film system, when the film was originally released, the sound was provided by the Vitaphone sound-on-disc system.
Co-director F. Lyle Goldman had done the animation for "Wireless Telephony" (1921) and "The Mystery Box" (1922) for the Bray Studios and released by Goldwyn Pictures, and "The Ear" (1920) for International Film Service and released by Paramount Pictures.

Compact Books

Compact Books was an imprint of Roberts and Vinter (London), publishers of "New Worlds" magazine. They published detective novels by authors Hank Janson and Hilary Brand (both house names) and a science fiction list edited by Michael Moorcock.
History.
They published mostly United Kingdom science fiction writers like John Brunner, Dan Morgan, Kenneth Bulmer and Moorcock himself, together with US writers such as L. Sprague de Camp, Thomas M. Disch, Charles Harness and Judith Merril, many for the first time. They lasted barely two years (1965 to 1966). The imprint ended suddenly with the collapse of Roberts and Vinter's distributor Thorpe and Porter, which also ended their publication of "New Worlds". All science fiction titles had covers by novelist Keith Roberts, then the art editor of Compact, as well as deputy editor (essentially the real editor) of the "New Worlds" companion Science Fantasy/Impulse.
Compact published Moorcock's pseudonymous novels: his Martian sword-and-planet trilogy under the pseudonym Edward P. Bradbury; his Nick Allard comedy thrillers (as Bill Barclay); and a short story collection as James Colvin. The science fiction titles published were a mix between some lesser-known Golden Age science fiction and New Wave authors.

Hanging mercury drop electrode

The hanging mercury drop electrode (HMDE) is a working electrode variation on the dropping mercury electrode (DME). Experiments run with dropping mercury electrodes are referred to as forms of polarography. If the experiments are performed at an electrode with a constant surface (like the HMDE) it is referred as voltammetry. 
Like other working electrodes these electrodes are used in electrochemical studies using three electrode systems when investigating reaction mechanisms related to redox chemistry among other chemical phenomenon.
Distinction.
The hanging mercury drop electrode (HDME) produces a partial mercury drop of controlled geometry and surface area at the end of a capillary in contrast to the dropping mercury electrode (DME) which steadily releases drops of mercury during an experiment. The disadvantages a DME experiences due to a constantly changing surface are not experienced by the HMDE since it has static surface area during an experiment. The static surface of the HDME means it is more likely to suffer from the surface adsorption phenomenon than a DME. Unlike solid electrodes which need to be cleaned and polished between most experiments, the self-renewing HMDE can simply release the contaminated drop and grow a clean drop between each experiment.

Jonathan Petropoulos (born January 10, 1961) is an American historian who writes about National Socialism and, in particular, the fate of art looted during World War II. He is John V. Croul Professor of European History at Claremont McKenna College in Claremont, California. Before his 1999 appointment to Claremont McKenna College, Petropoulos taught at Loyola College in Maryland.
From 1998 to 2000, Petropoulos served as Research Director for the Presidential Advisory Commission on Holocaust Assets, chaired by Edgar Bronfman, Sr.. Since 2000, Petropoulos has served as an expert witness in several legal cases concerning Nazi-looted assets, including "Altmann v. Austria" (six paintings by Klimt, including Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I), "Cassirer v. Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum" (painting by Pissarro), "Kann v. Wildenstein" (medieval manuscripts), and "Rosner et al. v. U.S.A." (the Hungarian Gold Train case).
Petropoulos was featured in "The Rape of Europa", a 2006 documentary on Nazi art looting. He is the author of three books: "Art as Politics in the Third Reich" (1996), "The Faustian Bargain" (2000), and "Royals and the Reich" (2006). With John Roth, he is the co-editor of "Gray Zones: Ambiguity and Compromise in the Holocaust and Aftermath" (2005).
In April 2008, Petropoulos resigned his position as director of Claremont McKenna College's Center for the Study of the Holocaust, Genocide and Human Rights amidst controversy over the failed restitution of a Pissarro painting looted by the Nazis in 1938. The London-based Art Loss Register employed Petropoulos because of his acquaintance with Bruno Lohse, a notorious Nazi art looter who died in 2007. The looted Pissarro, "Le Quai Malaquais, Printemps", was discovered by Swiss investigators in May 2007 in a secret safe controlled by Lohse in Zurich, Switzerland. After its seizure by Swiss authorities, the painting was independently restituted to an heir of Gottfried Bermann Fischer later in 2007 by a Liechtenstein court, and ultimately auctioned by Christie's in New York for $1,850,000 ($2,154,000 with premium) on November 3, 2009.
Following an extensive review, a March 2008 Claremont McKenna College statement said the professor "adhered to applicable contractual and legal obligations" in attempting to arrange return of the painting.

He was born on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Canada, moved to American as a teenager, and died in Phoenix, Arizona.
In 1904, Gillis intentionally killed a boy when he was practicing his hammer throw in a vacant lot in Harlem. Gillis was practicing with a 16 pound hammer in a vacant lot on Park Avenue between 134th and 135th street on September 30, 1904, and "just as he had let the 16 pound hammer go for an extra long throw, Christian Koehler, a fourteen-year old boy, climbed the fence in pursuit of a baseball. Gillis and several boys shouted a warning, but Koehler did not hear. The hammer struck him in the head and he was instantly killed." Gillis, who was a big, good-natured fellow, was said to be "...heartbroken over the affair."
In 1906, Gillis was the National Amateur Athletic Union junior champion hammer thrower, with a throw of 161 feet and 8 inches. That same year he won the Canadian championship as well.
In 1908 he finished seventh in the hammer throw event. He also participated in the discus throw event but his result is unknown. Prior to the 1908 Summer Olympic Games, Gillis won the English amateur championship with the 16 lb. hammer with a throw of 164 feet 5 inches.
Four years later he competed in the 1912 Olympic hammer throw contest but was not able to set a mark.
Though a carpenter by trade, after the 1908 Olympics he joined the New York City police force. He later took a contracting job in Spain, and spent a few years working in Europe. On his return to New York he worked for Thomas Edison creating screen titles for silent movies, and even made a few film appearances. He then headed West, eventually settling in Phoenix where he and his wife Bridget ran a rooming house during the Depression. Gillis ended his working life building smokestacks for smelting metal.
Notes.
Simon Peter Gillis was actually born on April 5, 1875 to Allen Gillis, a farmer of South West Margaree in Inverness County, Cape Breton Island. This date of birth with his father's information may be found in the Register of Births for Nova Scotia, Year: 1875 - Book: 1815 - Page: 10 - Number: 204 on the website for the Nova Scotia Archives.

Weyanoke, Virginia

Weyanoke is an unincorporated community in Charles City County, Virginia, United States. In 1619 the English transported enslaved Africans to the Weyanoke Peninsula. They created the first African community in North America. The Westover Plantation and related archaeological sites were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.
The area was named for, and historically inhabited by, the Weanoc (also spelled Weyanoke) Indians, an Algonquian-speaking tribe of the Powhatan Confederacy. The peripatetic movements of this tribe back and forth between their original home and North Carolina during the years following the Second Anglo-Powhatan War (1644–46) were extensively documented as part of the later boundary dispute between Virginia Colony and North Carolina Colony, and this unusual wealth of detailed information has been the subject of much study. At the heart of the dispute was the intended location of the "Weyanoke River" mentioned in the Carolina Charter boundaries, as the Weyanoke had by then lived on several rivers, and each colony produced many witnesses avowing that they had known various local rivers by that name.
Despite their many moves, the Weyanoke after 1646 became partly Anglicised, preferring to have some English-style houses built, rather than "yehakans", wherever they moved. The colony, in assigning them reserve land on the upper Blackwater in 1650 (from which they were driven by colonists the following year), even expressed a desire to teach the Weyanokes the English concept of property ownership, and this was successful. In their subsequent wanderings, the Weyanoke always made land purchase or rental contracts with the chiefs of the Iroquoian-speaking Tuscarora and Nottoway tribes. By the 18th century, they had fully integrated with the Nottoways, and were speaking their language, their former presence visible only in the surname "Wineoak".
The Weyanoke Plantation includes a formal Georgian style mansion built in the 1790s and 40 archaeological sites. The mansion is a two-story frame house sheathed with molded weatherboards and set on a brick foundation. The original house was enlarged after 1938. Within the property's boundaries are the archaeological remains of man's continuous occupation which spans 10,000 years.
The Weyanoke Association was formed in Charles City County in 1996 to help mixed-race African-American and Native American peoples research, understand and celebrate their joint heritages.

Foundation piecing

In quilting, foundation piecing was originally used to stabilize pieces of fabric that were stitched together. It first became popular in the 18th and 19th centuries in England, although a 15th-century Italian piece, the Impruneta cushion owned by Antonio degli Agli, may have used foundation piecing. It is sometimes referred to as English paper piecing because of its popularity in Britain.
Originally pieces of scrap fabric or muslin were used as the foundation. Now, the use of paper, whether tracing paper, freezer paper or some other heavy weight paper, has become very popular for the use as a pattern for in creating quilt blocks that are all the same size, each with precise, sharp points and perfectly matched intersections. In addition, information such as color and fabric choices can be written on the paper foundation in order to facilitate the construction of the piece and leaving lesser room for error while sewing. 
With paper piecing, a shorter stitch length (e.g. 12 stitches per inch) is used when sewing the components together which makes it easier to tear away the foundation after the block is completed. Several methods can be used to prepare the design for use on the foundation: tracing, photocopying, computer printing, needle punching, and pre-set designs.
There are three primary techniques used when foundation piecing: top pressed, under pressed and single template piecing. The technique used is dependent upon your preference and the pattern of the design being sewn. However, under pressed piecing allows for greater accuracy because the sewing is done right on the foundation with the fabric underneath, which allows the stitcher to view the marked seam line and sew directly on it.

HMLA-467

Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 467 (HMLA-467) is a United States Marine Corps helicopter squadron consisting of AH-1W SuperCobra attack helicopters and UH-1Y Venom utility helicopters. The squadron, nicknamed the "Sabers", is based at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina and falls under the command of Marine Aircraft Group 29 (MAG-29) and the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing (2nd MAW). The squadron's aircraft markings are grey & white stripes on the aircraft tail to replicate the tail markings on a Diamondback Rattlesnake and the markings on the lighthouses in North Carolina.
The stand-up of HMLA-467 is part of the Commandant’s plan to “grow the force” to better meet the demands of the Long War and the complexities of an evolving global threat. They were activated in October 2008.
Mission.
Support the Marine Air-Ground Task Force commander by providing offensive air support, utility support, armed escort and airborne supporting arms coordination, day or night under all weather conditions during expeditionary, joint or combined operations.
History.
HMLA-467 began as a cadre in April 2008, and began to stand up using aircraft from the reserve squadron HMLA-775, which was concurrently deactivated. During September 2008, pilots and aircrew from HMLA-467 received their first aircraft from HMLA-775 and flew them to MCAS Cherry Point for the squadron's activation ceremony on October 23, 2008, becoming the first HMLA to be activated in 37 years. Fifteen weeks later, in January, HMLA-467 supported Marine Aircraft Group 31 at Exercise Southern Fury.
During the months of September and October 2009, the Sabers supported Enhanced Mojave Viper (EMV) at Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms. During this exercise the Sabers executed day/night close air support, FAC(A), Escort, Command and Control, SCAR/AR, and weapons delivery training, flying 74 total sorties. During Mojave Viper, on October 1, the one-year anniversary of the squadron, HMLA-467 reached Full Operational Capability (FOC).
In January 2010, a detachment of UH-1N Hueys deployed with HMH-461 as part of the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit in order to provide humanitarian assistance and disaster response in support of Operation Unified Response following the 2010 Haiti earthquake. In 2010 HMLA-467 Det A attached to the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit and supported HADR operations in Pakistan as well as combat operations in Afghanistan and Libya. In 2011 HMLA-467 Det B was the first east coast HMLA to support the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit attaching to HMM-265(REIN) and supporting exercises such as PHIBLEX.
Unit Awards.
A unit citation or commendation is an award bestowed upon an organization for the action cited. Members of the unit who participated in said actions are allowed to wear on their uniforms the awarded unit citation. HMLA-467 has been presented with the following awards:

Pyana River

Pyana () is a river in Nizhny Novgorod Oblast and the Republic of Mordovia, Russia. It is a tributary of the Sura River. 
History and etymology.
Pyana translates from Russian into "drunken". The original name of the river was likely Piana, and, like many other old Russian geographical names, might be of Finnish origin ("pien" meaning "small"). The most likely reason for the transformation of Piana to Pyana was the Battle on Pyana River. The battle was fought on 2 August 1377 between the Blue Horde Khan Arapsha (Arab-Shah Muzaffar) and joint Russian troops under Knyaz Ivan Dmitriyevich. Awaiting the battle, the Russian Army lost discipline with drunkenness being a norm. They were unexpectedly attacked from all sides and crushed by the Mongols, forcing retreat to and across the Pyana. Many soldiers, and the Knyaz himself, drowned while crossing it. This explanation is further supported by the original text of the chronicles of the battle, where the writer first calls the river Piana, then notes the ironical similarity of the words piana and pyana (in a sense of drunkenness) and further uses Pyana as the river name.
Geography and hydrology.
The river is 436 km long; it freezes around November and thaws in April. The average discharge 65 km from its mouth is 25 m³/s and it can vary between 10 and 1,500 m³/s. River banks contain numerous karst caves. Pyana is remarkable by its shape: it runs to the north-west and then turns 180° south-east making a nearly closed loop (see map) before turning north and merging with the Sura.
Human activities.
The towns of Perevoz and Sergach are located on the Pyana. The river is navigable in its lower reaches. On the river banks there is Ichalkovsky Natural Reserve of 936 ha area which is protected by the state since 1963. There is a hydroelectric station near the village of Ichalkovo with the annual production of 600 MW. Its construction was started after World War II, but completed only in the 1990s.

Project Graduation

Project Graduation is a program offered by many high schools in the United States, in which organized, adult-supervised and alcohol-free activities are offered as part of a post-graduation party, in lieu of student-run events with alcohol or drugs. Events often last through the night and are held in hotels or community centers. Students are checked for illicit substances before entry and are carefully monitored.
In 1989, the Federal government provided aid to states across the country that was allocated to schools within the state. 38 schools in New Jersey received $1,500 in seed money to establish non-alcohol graduation night programs.
History.
Project Graduation emerged in the Oxford Hills area (Paris/Norway) of Maine, in 1980, the result of community energies empowered through a state initiative. It has long since been recognized as a prototype for the nation, helping to protect the lives of graduating seniors in all states.
Beginning in 1978, an Alcohol, Other Drugs and Highway Safety Prevention/Intervention Program was initiated by the Division of Alcohol and Drug Education Services, within Maine 's Department of Education, designed in cooperation with the Bureau of Safety. The thrust of program was to help schools and communities locally address problems associated with alcohol and other drugs.
Oxford Hills and five other communities sent teams of school and community leaders through intensive training sponsored by the division. After an 11-day, live-in program of initial training and then follow-up instruction, these teams were prepared to implement an action plan to develop comprehensive alcohol and other drug prevention and education programs in their home communities.
One of these teams, the Drug and Alcohol Team of Oxford Hills (DATOH), aimed to prevent recurring tragedies as Oxford Hills had experienced the previous year (1979), when seven alcohol and other drug related teen deaths occurred during the commencement season. Led by DATOH, area schools and communities provided the Class of 1980 at Oxford Hills High School with information about the risks of drinking, drugging and driving. The seniors were offered an alternative to the "traditional" graduation-night drinking event that drew hundreds of people to the local fair grounds. They called this chemical-free party "Project Graduation." The entire process, a huge success, was covered by the news media and was adopted as a major program initiative of the Division of Alcohol and Drug Education Services.
Through the work of the division and Maine 's communications media, other schools and communities became involved in Project Graduation the following year. In 1981 there were 12 Project Graduation sites, and the following year, 36 sites with a consistent decline in alcohol-related teen highway deaths. This decline reached zero fatalities in 1983 when there were 86 sites involved. In 1986, there were 139 sites, or 98 percent, of Maine 's high schools. Project Graduation activities were attended by 80 percent of the Class of 1986. In 1987, 139 schools, or 94% participated in Project Graduation with 80% of the seniors attending.
Project Graduation captured the imaginations of more than Maine seniors. In 1983, the project was one of eight national models selected by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to be presented at a conference held in Washington, D.C. At this conference, Project Graduation was identified as a concrete model - a practical springboard that can lead to other prevention activities.
As a result of that conference, many states began to explore the possibility of replicating the project. Florida Informed Parents, Inc. and "Texan's War on Drugs" led the way in their states with support from Maine . Iowa became involved through the leadership of Dr. John Artis, former Skowhegan Area High School Principal.
In 1984, the division consulted with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in the preparation of an agenda, learning materials, and a program for a National Project Graduation Conference. The conference was held in Springfield, Illinois in March, 1984. Thirty-eight states sent delegations of two students and one adult. Eleven Maine presenters shared their concepts of Project Graduation. Project Graduation: Friends for Life, a booklet highlighting the essential ingredients of the project, was prepared by NHTSA in consultation with the division for that conference. Nineteen states had state-wide Project Graduation Coordinators. In 1986, Project Graduation was held in all 50 states and two Canadian provinces. The project received national attention in 1987 in Good Housekeeping magazine and again in 1989 in Woman's Day magazine.
In 1990, there were no youth fatalities attributed to drinking, drugging, and driving in Maine during the May 15-June 20 commencement season. It was the third consecutive year there were no Maine youth highway fatalities during this critical period. Recognition of Project Graduation's impact continued. More than 40 states had Project Graduation contact persons.
The primary aims of Project Graduation activities are to increase awareness of the dangers of drinking, drugging and driving and to reduce the number of youth involved in alcohol and other drug-related highway crashes. Across the country, Project Graduation and the chemical-free celebrations it inspired are the new tradition for graduating seniors. In Perspectives in Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Project Graduation- Maine, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention observed that "Project Graduation has become much more than an event that occurs on graduation night. It is a communitywide planning process that strives to create a caring, supportive environment and more open communication between youths and adults."
All school-related functions are supposed to be chemical-free, but what makes Project Graduation different is the attitude of the students. They have made a conscious decision to enjoy their graduation night without alcohol or other drugs. And no other group, including parents and school personnel, can make that decision for students.
Events & Cranmore Mountain Resort.
Cranmore Mountain Resort in North Conway, NH has been host to numerous Project Graduation Events in recent years. It has hosted graduating classes from schools in Maine and New Hampshire. The resort has many attractions available, from operating the outdoor Mountain Adventure Park under the lights to indoor inflatables and shows. Typically, the mountain operates outdoor attractions, then serves food, and then brings everyone indoors to its fitness center for fun and activities through the rest of the night and early morning. See Cranmore's Project Graduation Page and Project Grad rentals page for more details.

Red Sport International

The International Association of Red Sports and Gymnastics Associations, commonly known as Red Sport International (RSI) or Sportintern was a Comintern-supported international sports organization established in July 1921. The RSI was established in an effort to form a rival organization to already existing "bourgeois" and social democratic international sporting groups. The RSI was part of a physical culture movement in Soviet Russia linked to the physical training of young people prior to their enlistment in the military. The RSI held 3 summer games and 1 winter games called "Spartakiad" in competition with the Olympic games of the International Olympic Committee before being dissolved in 1937.
Organizational history.
Background.
The notion of a separate working class national athletic federation emerged first in Germany during the decade of the 1890s, when a Workers Gymnastics Association was established by activists in the socialist movement in opposition to the nationalist German Gymnastics Society "(Turnen)." Other "proletarian" sports organizations emerged soon thereafter in that country, including the Solidarity Worker Cycling Club, the Friends of Nature Rambling Association, the Worker Swimming Association, the Free Sailing Association, and the Worker Track and Field Athletics Association, among others. By the time of World War I, the German proletarian sports movement included more than 350,000 participants.
Following the bloodbath of World War I, the German workers' sports movement began to reemerge, with a new competitive orientation beginning to take the place of individualistic club activities. The international social democratic movement also experienced a rebirth after its connections had been severed by war. In 1920 the social democrats established an International Association for Sports and Physical Culture, echoing its efforts in the pre-war period. This organization was rechristened as the Socialist Workers' Sport International (SWSI) in 1925.
In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution of 1917 the international socialist movement divided into two antagonistic camps, socialist and communist — a division exacerbated with the establishment of the Communist International (Comintern) in 1919. Parallel political organizations sprung up in every country and a state of bitter enmity prevailed.
Establishment.
The idea of a rival Red Sport International (RSI) was the inspiration of Nikolai Podvoisky, who at the 2nd World Congress of the Comintern in the summer of 1920 discussed with a number of delegates from around the world the idea of establishing an organization to coordinate the physical training of youth. Podvoisky, a military specialist in charge of Soviet Russia's military training organization, believed systematic physical training to be beneficial for the needs of the Red Army for healthy and fit youth in its ranks. An international sports organization was also seen as a potential ideological counterweight to the Olympic games of the "bourgeois" International Olympic Committee as well as the activities of the rival International Association for Sports and Physical Culture of the socialists.
Podvoisky gathered interested delegates who were already in Moscow for the Comintern Congress and the group constituted itself a founding conference for an international sports organization. It is worthy of emphasis that the Comintern did not itself directly found the Red Sport International, the group being established through independent initiative and the Comintern being preoccupied with other affairs. The group issued a public manifesto declaring the establishment of a Red Sport International and elected a governing Executive Committee, consisting of representatives from Soviet Russia, Germany, Czechoslovakia, France, Sweden, Italy, and Alsace-Lorraine. Podvoisky was elected President of the new organization.
The establishment of an international sports organization in Soviet Russia in 1921 was not without its utopian elements, since no official Soviet sport organizations existed in famine stricken post-civil war Soviet Russia at that time. Germany, on the other hand, had a well-developed workers' sport movement at this time. Consequently, Sportintern from its outset maintained a strong German flavor and it was there in the city of Berlin that the 2nd Conference of the organization was held in July 1922. The only national "proletarian" sports organization to join the German group at that early dates was the Czechoslovak Federation of Workers' Gymnastic Leagues, said to represent 100,000 athletes.
The Comintern moved closer to the fledgling Sportintern in November 1922 when, in conjunction with the 4th World Congress, the governing Executive Committee of the Communist International decided to name a representative to the "independent" proletarian sport organization. The Communist International of Youth (KIM) did not take action until the meeting of its governing Bureau in Moscow in July 1923, when it issued a general recommendation of support for the Sportintern and the national sports organizations affiliated to it as a useful "proletarian class instrument." It did not, however, delve into the contentious issue of in what manner and to what extent these two international bodies should be related.
The governing Executive Committee of Sportintern met in Moscow in February 1923 and decided to establish a satellite bureau of the organization in Berlin, with a view to increasing participation among Western European workers' sports organizations. The maneuver proved successful in helping to build the organization, triggering a split of the French Workers Sports Federation later that year and the affiliation of 80% of its membership with the Red Sport International. The RSI's increased place in the public eye motivated the governing body of the rival international socialist sports authority, meeting in Zurich in August 1923, to discuss issuing an invitation to Sportintern to help organize a joint "Workers' Olympiad" — a proposal which was narrowly defeated, despite indications that a majority of individual members of the socialist organization favored joint participation.
End of autonomy.
In October 1924 the Red Sport International held its 3rd Congress in Moscow. At this time the organization decided to enlarge its governing Executive Committee to include four members of the Executive Committee of the Communist International of Youth — an organization which saw the national affiliates of Sportintern as comprised overwhelmingly of young workers and sought to insert its influence in the organization. As the membership of Sportintern was formally "open to all proletarian elements which recognize the class struggle" it was not an explicitly communist organization, a situation which the KIM saw as a significant shortcoming.
The RSI was a large and growing organization in this interval, with some 2 million affiliated members in the Soviet Union, joined by others sections in Germany, Czechoslovakia, France, Norway, Italy, Finland, Switzerland, the United States, Estonia, Bulgaria, and Uruguay. As the size of the organization grew, so, too, did pressure to bring the organization's ideological character under tighter centralized Communist Party control.
Nikolai Podvoisky was himself a voice for such an insertion of such ideological hegemony, declaring in a lengthy speech to the 5th Enlarged Plenum of the Comintern, held in the spring of 1925, that Sportintern should henceforth adopt as its motto:
"Convert sport and gymnastics into a weapon of the class revolutionary struggle, concentrate the attention of workers and peasants on sport and gymnastics as one of the best instruments, methods, and weapons for their class organization and struggle."
At the same time the international communist movement moved to further politicize the RSI, efforts were made to make political hay over the refusal of the Socialist Workers' Sport International to conduct joint activities, such as its decision to bar the Red Sport International from participation at the July 1925 "Workers' Olympiad" held in Frankfurt under its auspices.
It was in this period, 1924 to 1925, that the Red Sport International effectively became an auxiliary of the Communist International. This control was effected by the subordinate youth section of the Comintern, the Communist International of Youth, although the Comintern reserved for itself ultimate authority to decide issues of great importance. As the Comintern was itself in the process of being absorbed as an instrument of Soviet foreign policy in this interval, the RSI likewise gradually lost its ability to function independently as an international entity. 
In the words of French sports historian André Gounot:
"...The RSI's dependence on the Comintern was accompanied, almost inevitably, by the Soviet section's dominance within the RSI. The interests of the Soviet Union and Soviet sport were decisive factors in the RSI's decisions and actions — even if, as was frequently the case, they were incompatible with those of European worker sport." 
The last International Congress of the Red Sport International came in 1928 and was marked by no serious discussion of contemporary sporting issues. Instead the 1928 gathering consisted of a mechanical attempt to apply the Comintern's ultra-radical Third Period slogan of "Class versus Class" and its corollary theory of social fascism to world sport — splitting the fissure between the two camps of the European workers' sport movement wider than ever.
Social composition.
Membership of the various national sections of the Red Sport International was by no means monolithic. According to the RSI's own study of the issue, members of the organizations were predominantly male, but hailed from a variety of communist, socialist, syndicalist, and anarchist tendencies, including many of whom who were members of no party. Although many of these were of the working class, also included were white collar employees, students, and government workers. Membership records of the French section, for example, indicate that approximately 80% of participants were from the working class, with the remaining 20% members of other social groups.
No details exist for the exact Communist Party membership of any national section of the RSI, although in the considered opinion of a leading historian on the topic, "it is safe to assume that this group represented a minority of the whole membership of each section." The Czechoslovakian federation, thought to include the largest Communist Party contingent from outside the USSR, is believed to have included something in the range of 20 to 30% who were members of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia.
The fact that members of other parties or no parties participated in the national sections of the Red Sport International is testimony to the limited impact that RSI programmatic rhetoric had upon grassroots participants. It was rather the fun and excitement of training and competition that bound together local groups and their national units more than ideological proclivities. The difference in perception of the organization between its rank-and-file participants and the Moscow dominated leadership of the organization has led one scholar to conclude that the RSI was a "split organization, living in two universes," bureaucratic in political discourse but remaining well within the less intense social democratic workers' sports tradition at the individual club level. In this view politics was merely a piece of a broader participatory sports movement.
International competitions.
The international workers' sports organizations of the socialist and communist movements did not necessarily object to some of the most noble goals of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), but they did each share fundamental reservations about the modern Olympic games that were the inspiration of Baron Pierre de Coubertin, a hereditary French nobleman. First and foremost, the Olympics of the IOC stressed competition between nations — regarded by the radicals as a manifestation of national chauvinism. Rather than the accentuation of national rivalry and patriotic feeling, international competition should focus on the actual athletic effort in a setting designed to build the ethic of internationalism, both the socialists and communists agreed.
The IOC games also were based upon rigid entrance standards, while the international festivals of the worker athletic movement instead attempted to build mass participation through pageantry, artistic and cultural activities, and unifying political presentations. Moreover, the sort of athletes dominating the IOC games were objectionable to the radicals on the basis of social class, dominated as they were by the privileged children of the rural aristocracy and the bourgeoisie. Such international competitions should be open to the participation of less privileged national and social groups, without distinction to race or creed, in the view of the radical sports organizations.
Therefore the Red Sport International and its socialist rival, the organization emerging as the Socialist Workers' Sport International, conducted a series of their own workers' sports festivals in distinction to and competition with the Olympiads of the IOC. Four such events (called Spartakiads in honor of the heroic slave leader, Spartacus) were sponsored by the RSI. Two of these were held in 1928, and one each in 1931 and 1937.
While a major national workers' sport festival had already been held in Czechoslovakia in 1921, it was the socialist organization in 1925 that conducted the first pair of Workers' Olympics events — Summer Games in Frankfurt attracting 150,000 spectators and competitors from 19 country, and Winter Games in Schreiberhau (today's Szklarska Poręba, Poland), attended by athletes from 12 countries. No national flags or anthems graced the closing or opening ceremonies, replaced instead by universal use of the red flag and singing of "The Internationale." "Soviet and other communist athletes were excluded from these games, however, and there was therefore little actual unity of the workers' sports movement for all the universalist pageantry employed.
From the middle 1930s the political line of the world communist movement changed. The so-called Popular Front against the threat of fascism rendered cooperation with socialists and others through unified workers' athletic festivals not only a possibility but the tactical order of the day. Plans were laid for a so-called 3rd Workers' Olympiad to be held in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain in June 1936, under joint auspices of the RSI and the SWSI. The time and place proved inauspicious, however, coinciding with outbreak of hostilities in the Spanish Civil War. This forced postponement of the event, which was rescheduled for the next summer in Antwerp, Belgium.
The 3rd Workers' Olympiad proved to be less successful than previous endeavors, but it still managed to attract 27,000 participating athletes, and put 50,000 people in the stadium for the final day of competition. An estimated 200,000 people turned out for the traditional closing parade through the city.
Dissolution.
With the Soviet Union becoming immersed in the first months of 1937 in a massive and xenophobic secret police campaign against perceived underground espionage networks remembered as the Great Terror, the Red Sport International was summarily dissolved by the Comintern in April of that year.

España Boba

In the history of the Dominican Republic, the era of España Boba ("Foolish Spain") lasted from 1809 to 1821, during which the Captaincy General of Santo Domingo was returned to Spanish rule, but the Spanish government exercised minimal power as its resources were taxed by the Peninsular War and the various Spanish American wars of independence. The period ended when Dominican officials declared a short-lived independence on November 30, 1821. In February 1822 Haiti occupied and annexed former Spanish Santo Domingo, a situation which lasted until 1844.
Background.
Spanish Santo Domingo had been ceded to France as a result of the Peace of Basel in 1795. Many Dominicans chose to go into exile in Cuba, Puerto Rico and other Spanish areas. France, nevertheless, maintained only nominal control over the acquired area, with most of the colony's administration staffed by Dominicans and Spaniards and Spanish laws and traditions maintained. The situation turned worse when the declaration of an independent Haiti in 1804 increased hostilities on the island and commerce with the western part of the island was lost.
The start of the Peninsular War changed the political situation. Spain was now once again at war with France, although a French appointed king, Joseph Bonaparte, tried to claim the allegiance of Spaniards everywhere. Exiled Dominicans who were opposed to the French began returning to the island and organized small expeditionary forces in Puerto Rico under Juan Sánchez Ramírez, which received British naval aid. Britain had never accepted the cessation of Santo Domingo to France, which it considered a violation of the Treaty of Utrecht. The Dominican and Puerto Rican forces defeated the larger and better-armed French army on November 7, 1808, at the Battle of Palo Hincado.
Spanish rule.
During the next twelve years, Santo Domingo's economy suffered. Most farming was solely for subsistence, there was little specie on the island, and, once political stability returned to Spain in 1814, its focus was on the more productive island of Cuba.
However, during the second decade of the 19th century the colonial neglect acquired epic proportions. In fact, for all practical purposes, the colony in Santo Domingo during these years (1809–1821) was governed as an afterthought through the more significant Cuban administration. Cuba, in contrast with Santo Domingo, had ceased to be considered a marginal colony after the brief, yet consequential, British occupation of 1763. Spain had since been pouring resources into developing the Cuban economy, and so, while Santo Domingo was experiencing a loss of its white planter and landowning class, Cuba was welcoming a growing and enterprising bourgeoisie, which complimented well the increasingly powerful sugar planter class.
The Dominican colonial elite, on the other hand, had suffered substantially from the effects of the Haitian Revolution and did not recover. The ruling elite of the time lamented that they had been abandoned by Spain—little economic aid was invested in the island, the only money the royal government sent to the island was the salaries of royal employees. But while the growth of the sugar economy in Cuba created an economically and racially polarized society, in Santo Domingo the material gap among the social classes was not as marked.
Revolts against Spanish rule.
As in the other Spanish colonies during the Peninsular War, there were several attempts to establish juntas, during the years 1809-1812. Some of these conspiracies attempted to create an independent state, while others sought to join the area to Haiti. An early attempt took place in 1809 under the leadership of a "Habanero", simply known as "Don Fermín." He was arrested, held for seven years at Fort Ozama before being sent to Spain. Another conspiracy was headed by Manuel del Monte, a close relative of the royal commissioner sent by the Supreme Central and Governing Junta of the Kingdom, Javier Caro. Del Monte was discovered, arrested and indicted and sent to Spain, where he was acquitted, possibly due to the influence of his relative.
Four French sergeants, who had remained after Spanish rule was restored attempted to organize a coup d'état to return Santo Domingo to French rule. Their effort failed and they were executed. Also executed were the leaders of an attempted slave and free black revolt. When the authorities refused to consider freeing the Dominican slaves, as had been hoped, or fully implementing the Spanish Constitution of 1812, which would have granted Spanish nationality to free blacks, if not granting them the right to vote, slaves and free blacks conspired to end slavery and to join the region to Haiti. The conspiracy was discovered and many were sentenced to lashes and jail terms. The four principal leaders, Pedro Seda, José Leocadio, Pedro Henríquez and a person simply known as Marcos were executed. Their heads were publicly displayed at various points of the capital.
Ephemeral independence.
In November 1821 a new conspiracy emerged in the mountainous region bordering Haiti to join Santo Domingo to Haiti. The conspiracy was popular among the middle and lower classes, small shop keepers, a few key ranchers, and among Criollos and Mulattoes. The movement spread in the Sur and Cibao regions. At the same time another conspiracy in the capital, headed by José Núñez de Cáceres sought to free Santo Domingo and join it to Gran Colombia. Realizing that the pro-Haiti movement was gaining ground, he and his followers deposed Governor Pascual Real on November 30, 1821, and established the Independent State of Spanish Haiti. The new state had little support in the other regions of Santo Domingo and Núñez de Cáceres was unable to secure a commitment from Simón Bolívar that Gran Colombia would send aid. Haitian President Jean-Pierre Boyer wrote to Núñez de Cáceres expressing the importance that the island be united. So Núñez de Cáceres saw no other option than to place Santo Domingo under Hatian rule. On February 9, 1822, Boyer took formal possession of Santo Domingo.

Gregory Lee Johnson

Gregory Lee "Joey" Johnson (born 1956) is an American revolutionary Communist activist whose burning of the flag of the United States in a political demonstration during the 1984 Republican National Convention in Dallas, Texas, in violation of a Texas law prohibiting flag desecration, led to his role as defendant in the landmark United States Supreme Court case "Texas v. Johnson" (1989).
Early life.
Gregory Johnson was born in Richmond, Indiana. His father spent several years of Gregory's childhood in prison. His mother, Sally, was a supporter of the American civil rights movement who married a staff sergeant in the United States Army. Johnson grew up in a racially mixed, low-income neighborhood of Richmond. In 1969, he moved with his family to an American military base in West Germany, where he was influenced by growing radicalism and opposition to the Vietnam War among Vietnam War draftees.
His family returned to the United States in 1971. In 1973, he dropped out of high school and joined the United States Merchant Marine, which took him to Panama and Mexico, where he observed American sociopolitical and economic influence. After moving to Tampa, Florida in 1976, he joined the Revolutionary Communist Youth Brigade, the youth arm of the Revolutionary Communist Party, USA.
At the time of his arrest for flag desecration in Dallas, Johnson was a resident of Atlanta, Georgia, and had traveled to Dallas to protest at the 1984 Republican National Convention.
Role as defendant in "Texas v. Johnson".
On 22 August 1984, Johnson participated in a political demonstration called the "Republican War Chest Tour" in Dallas, Texas to protest the policies of several Dallas-area businesses and of the Ronald Reagan presidential administration. The demonstration was timed to coincide with the 1984 Republican National Convention being held in downtown Dallas. During the demonstration, approximately one hundred protestors marched in the streets, chanted slogans, and staged anti-nuclear weapons and anti-war die-ins at various corporate offices. Some protestors vandalized businesses by spray-painting building walls and knocking over potted plants and ashtrays. Johnson did not take part in the vandalism, but took an American flag that had been seized from a flagpole at one of the buildings by another protestor.
At the culmination of the protest outside Dallas City Hall, Johnson poured kerosene on the flag and set it on fire. While the flag burned, he chanted political slogans, including "Reagan, Mondale which will it be? Either one means World War III;" "Ronald Reagan, killer of the hour, Perfect example of U.S. power;" and "red, white and blue, we spit on you, you stand for plunder, you will go under." Some witnesses testified that they were seriously offended. No one was hurt or threatened with injury during the protest.
Johnson was the only protestor to be charged with a crime. He was convicted of the desecration of a venerated object in violation of Texas Penal Code Annotated § 42.09(a)(3), sentenced to one year in prison, and fined $2,000.
Johnson appealed his conviction to the Fifth Court of Appeals of Texas, but lost. He next petitioned the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals to review the decision. That court overturned his conviction, saying that the State of Texas could not punish Johnson for burning the flag because the First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects such activity as symbolic speech. The court also concluded that the flag burning in this case did not cause or threaten to cause a breach of the peace.
The State of Texas asked the Supreme Court of the United States to hear the case. Attorneys David D. Cole and radical civil rights activist William Kunstler acted as Johnson's lawyers. In 1989, the Supreme Court handed down a controversial 5-4 decision in favor of Gregory Johnson, holding that Johnson's conviction for flag desecration was inconsistent with the First Amendment. The Court's decision invalidated laws against flag desecration in force in forty-eight of the fifty states.
Second flag burning.
In response to the Supreme Court decision in "Texas v. Johnson", the United States Congress enacted legislation outlawing the desecration of the flag, which then-President George H. W. Bush allowed to pass into law without his signature. The Flag Protection Act of 1989 went into effect at midnight on 28 October 1989.
On 30 October, Gregory Johnson joined Shawn Eichman, David Blalock, and Scott Tyler on the steps of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C., where they set fire to three American flags while chanting "burn, baby, burn." The four men were arrested and spent the night in jail. The next day, Eichman, Blalock, and Tyler were charged with violating the Flag Protection Act of 1989, demonstrating without a permit, and disorderly conduct. However, the United States Attorney's Office declined to file charges against Johnson, claiming that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him. Johnson declared that the government's decision not to charge him was an "act of cowardice" and a "miscarriage of justice," and stated that he was outraged.
The consolidated cases of Shawn Eichman, David Blalock, and Scott Tyler eventually reached the Supreme Court with Eichman as the named respondent in "United States v. Eichman" (1990), which was argued together with the case "United States v. Haggerty" (1990). Mark Haggerty, Jennifer Campbell, Darius Strong and Carlos Garza were also charged with having violated the Flag Protection Act of 1989 outside a Seattle, Washington post office just a few minutes after the law went into effect on 28 October. The Supreme Court handed down its decision on "United States v. Eichman" on 11 June 1990, ruling 5-4 in favor of Eichman, Haggerty, and the other respondents, and striking down the Flag Protection Act of 1989.
The failed federal legislation triggered many unsuccessful efforts to pass an amendment to the United States Constitution banning flag desecration, including one attempt during the two weeks in October 1989 between the passage of the Flag Protection Act of 1989 and its taking effect, and another just eleven days after the "United States v. Eichman" ruling. The most recent attempt to adopt a flag desecration amendment failed in the United States Senate by one vote on 27 June 2006.
Later years.
Johnson lived in Houston for four years after his arrest for flag desecration, during which he worked in a warehouse while his attorneys worked on his case. He was described by a contemporaneous Houston activist, Geov Parrish, as an "obnoxious young transplanted New Yorker" who would show up at "every local demonstration with a bloody, severed pig's head (tendrils still trailing along) that he'd drag along on a leash and collar while shouting anti-imperialist slogans; the pig, of course, was the United States."
Afterwards, Johnson moved to the South Bronx in New York, then to San Francisco and Los Angeles, where he remained active with the Revolutionary Communist Youth Brigade, in time becoming the Youth Brigade's national spokesperson. He continued to speak out against legislation targeting flag desecration. He also became a Los Angeles organizer for the October 22 Coalition against police brutality and for Not in Our Name, an antiwar foreign policy organization.
Throughout 2009, Johnson, who during his Supreme Court case was a client of American civil rights attorney William Kunstler, helped to promote the film "", a documentary about the late attorney that premiered at the 25th Sundance Film Festival.
On 14 October 2011, Johnson was arrested after he and two others chained themselves to the front doors of the headquarters of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation in Sacramento, California. The three were protesting in support of a hunger strike being conducted by Pelican Bay State Prison inmates.
